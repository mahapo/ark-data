[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" The Da ē va Cult in the G ā th ā s Addressing the question of the origins of the Zoroastrian religion, this book argues that the intransigent opposition to the cult of the da ē vas , the ancient Indo-Iranian gods, is the root of the development of the two central doctrines of Zoroastrianism: cosmic dualism and eschatology (fate of the soul after death and its passage to the other world). The da ē va cult as it appears in the G ā th ā s, the oldest part of the Zoroastrian sacred text, the Avesta, had eschatological pretensions. The poet of the G ā th ā s condemns these as deception. The book critically examines various theories put forward since the nineteenth century to account for the condemnation of the da ē vas . It then turns to the relevant G ā thic passages and analyses them in detail in order to give a picture of the cult and the reasons for its repudiation. Finally, it examines materials from other sources, especially the Greek accounts of Iranian ritual lore (mainly) in the context of the mystery cults. Classical Greek writers consistently associate the nocturnal ceremony of the magi with the mysteries as belonging to same religious-cultural category. This shows that Iranian religious lore included a nocturnal rite that aimed at ensuring the soul’s journey to the beyond and a desirable afterlife. Challenging the prevalent scholarship of the Greek interpretation of Iranian religious lore and proposing a new analysis of the formation of the Hellenistic concept of ‘magic’, this book is an important resource for students and scholars of History, Religion and Iranian Studies.

The two features of Zoroastrianism that gave it its distinctive characteristic for classical and Hellenistic Greek observers, namely its comprehensive dualism and eschatological doctrine, may be traced, as far as our evidence permits, to the uncompromising opposition of the poet of the G ā th ā s to the da ē va cult. In effect, as a religious-historical question, the emergence of these two features would otherwise remain without a satisfactory answer. The da ē vas are deities that preside over the fate of the soul and its passage to the beyond. Since mental life continues across the threshold of death and is determined in its quality by earthly existence, the da ē vas are thought to exercise power over the latter too. Their cult as it is described in the G ā th ā s seems to have had a specifi cally eschatological signifi cance. In any case, it is primarily on this ground that the poet attacks them. The repudiated deities pretend to control access to the blissful abode of the gods. On the other hand, their followers complain that Zarathu š tra’s ‘messenger’ prevents them from ‘seeing a š\u0004 a- ’, i.e. reaching the divine sphere, probably meaning both after death and in ritual ecstasy. 1 We have evidence that initiation to the mysteries of Eleusis or the status of the d ī ks \u0004 ita in the Vedas, for instance, was under-stood to be a consecration to death and, conversely, the initiate’s death was imagined to be like mystic celebrations. The assimilation of death to ritual initiation is ancient. 2 The rite devoted to the da ē vas apparently made use of ritual elements that are regularly associated with initiatory patterns of the mysteries and of the more ancient male clubs whose roots probably go back to Indo-European times. From a G ā thic verse (Y 30.6cc′) we learn that the mortals who take part in the da ē va cult ‘damage existence’ with their rite that involves the a ē šə ma- ‘rave or rage’. Every time the word ma š\u0004 iia- ‘mortal’ is used in the G ā th ā s in association with the da ē vas , it has a pejorative sense. We may safely go further, I believe, and be more specifi c about the reference of the word. The context of the usage suggests that what is meant by ‘mortal’ is the initiate of the da ē va cult. It is indeed curious that the inherited root (* d[e]iu ˆ - ) that in a number of Indo-European languages yields words related to diurnal sky, including divine"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"2 Introductionnames, should give in Iranian the word for malicious spirits. In the Avesta the word da ē va- is used to refer to noxious supernatural beings, somewhat akin to the bad variety of Hellenistic daim ō n . Its exact Vedic counterpart dev á - becomes the common noun for god, and when used as an adjective, it means celestial or divine. The Indo-European root also gives the divine names (nom. sg.) Vedic dy á us \u0004 pit ā , Gr. ze ú s p á ter and Lat. iup[p]iter . How can we understand the development whereby the apparently traditional gods are ‘demonized’ so massively, so peremptorily, that the divine appellation itself becomes the word for demon? But perhaps the question is badly posed; or to put it in another way, the puzzlement at the ‘demonization of the divine’ may be due to conceptual confusion. Our concept of god, which Christian the-ology adopted and passed on, derives largely from Plato. Archaic Greece had no idea of ‘god’, not even Hesiod’s Zeus is a ‘god’ in the post-Platonic sense; nor should we assume that ancient Iran did. Even if we could know noth-ing else about the da ē vas , it would be much more reasonable, comparatively speaking, to assume that these gods were functionally defi ned as a group and associated with a specifi c activity. In other words, da ē va- would not be a gen-eric divine appellation. In the Young Avestan texts, the word yazata- ‘worthy of worship’ is a title, seemingly emerging from a defi nite genre of ritual dis-course; but it is not an inclusive term. 3 The attempts made since the nineteenth century to come to terms with the problem of the ‘demonization’ of the da ē vas have not produced satisfactory results. The G ā th ā s are diffi cult to understand. Even where there is no gram-matical or syntactic problem, still the signifi cance and references of the text remain elusive. This is in part due to the historical isolation and poetic nature of the compositions. We do not quite know how to read the G ā th ā s. The sys-tematic comparison with the language of the Vedas and Sanskrit grammar and vocabulary more generally was instrumental in setting the study of the text on a sound linguistic basis. 4 Why should we not extend the comparison to the ideological sphere as well? This assimilation has in fact been the frame of a number of recent interpretations. ‘Je crois,’ declared Jean Kellens in his inaugural paper at the Coll è ge de France in 1994, ‘le temps venu d’un retour à la m é thode v é disante pure et dure pour é clairer le texte de l’Avesta et le texte dans son ensemble, c’est- à -dire non seulement sa langue, mais aussi les conceptions religieuses qui s’y expriment’. Kellens hopes to be able to show on this basis that ‘aucune intervention proph é tique n’a modifi é le cours de la religion iranienne’. 5 It is hard to suppress the suspicion that the research in its extension of the ‘Vedicizing method’ to ‘religious conceptions’ may not be beholden to a preconception. A common ‘language’ per se, even if this includes shared items of phraseology, does in no way permit one to infer a common religious thought inherited from the Indo-Iranian past. Kellens’ view of the matter is in part a reaction to the ‘traditional’ conception of the religion of the G ā th ā s, which made of them the founding document of a monotheistic religion issuing from the campaign of a sermonizing prophet. One needs no argument or elaborate work of interpretation to discover the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Introduction 3model that is behind this view. Scholars who have championed such a thesis have time and again compared Zarathu š tra with the (stereotyped) Hebrew prophet. The extraordinary extent to which the monotheistic enthusiasts are willing to go to support their thesis may be seen in Gershevitch’s meditations. 6 The question remains, however, whether the justifi ed rejection of the Biblical assimilation requires the placement of G ā thic religious thought within the Vedic horizon. The problem of the repudiation of the da ē vas in the G ā th ā s can hardly be separated from the question of their pre- or non-Zoroastrian status and function. This has to be the frame of research on the topic. Is the da ē va cult condemned because polytheistic gods, by defi nition, have no place in a mono-theistic religion, according to one thesis? Or, are the da ē vas ‘demonized’ because they are the accursed part of the pantheon, a structural requirement of the ‘dualistic logic’, according to another thesis? In either perspective, what the G ā th ā s have to tell us about the nature, pretensions and activities of the da ē vas necessarily becomes a matter of indifference. In the fi rst part of the book I argue that the approaches taken by scholars since the mid nineteenth century to account for the ‘demonization’ of the da ē vas , far from taking the G ā th ā s as their point of reference and orienta-tion, ignore the relevant passages or make them yield the expected meaning. If I am right that the question of the da ē vas in the G ā th ā s has never been posed outside these frames, should we not want to know what in the treat-ment of the question comes from these, e.g. what is a red herring? It is not always the whole thesis that one adopts but this or that component of it. The perspective of theodicy has no place in the G ā th ā s: it is not only historically stranded but also incapable of executing the function for which it is enlisted. The supposed G ā thic idea of ‘free will’ as a solution to the problem of evil ad maiorem Dei gloriam is a theological contribution of the Western scholar steeped in Christian theology, just as much as attributing the idea of ‘ingest-ing the god’ to Dionysiac omophagia is, practically assimilating the cult of the god to Christian sacramentalism. 7 The spectre of the comparison with the middle Vedic opposition of deva and asura , supposed to have been dispatched in the 1970s, haunts Kellens’ latest explanation of the ‘demonization’ of the da ē vas in La quatri è me naissance de Zarathushtra ( 2006 ). In the second part I discuss in detail the passages from the G ā th ā s that bear on the topic. I put forward new interpretations of a number of key G ā thic terms such as ξ x š ā ‘have disposition’ or xratu- ‘resourcefulness’. It will be seen that the opposition to the da ē va cult was current at the time of the com-position of the G ā th ā s. The da ē va cult is described in the G ā th ā s as having eschatological pretensions and involving ritual features that indicate, as I mentioned, a background in initiation-based male associations. The connec-tion with masculine esoteric rites must remain a hypothesis, but a plausible one nonetheless, in view of the convergence of comparative material. The cultic status and function of the G ā thic deities stand out clearly against the proposed thesis concerning the da ē va cult. In effect, they replace the da ē vas ."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"4 IntroductionThe generally admitted or readily acceptable characteristics of the two sets of deities mutually illuminate one another once they are placed in the per-spective proposed in this book: the da ē vas are repudiated essentially as the deities that (pretend to) provide access to the divine sphere, and are replaced by another cult, which consciously constituted itself in opposition to what it aimed to supplant. I critically discuss previous translations and interpretations in respect of grammar, syntax and sense. The interpretation proposed here is based on linguistic and syntactic analyses and aims at understanding the sense and signifi cance of the texts. My aim is to read them as a discourse . The inter-pretation makes use of comparative ideological data wherever possible. In the last part, materials from other sources, especially the Greek rep-resentations of the magi’s lore, are examined, mainly in the context of a discussion of the mystery cults. Admittedly, these provide only partial and indirect evidence, but their convergence is signifi cant. Classical Greek writers consistently associate the magi’s nocturnal rite with the mysteries, and the magus with fi gures such as the ‘mendicant priest’ and ‘initiator’ belonging to the mystic cultural fi eld. The ‘magician’ undoubtedly receives his profes-sional name from this association, which indicates the solidity of the con-nection. The Greeks had a more or less defi nite image of the mysteries. 8 This can be seen, for example, in the appropriation of the chthonic cult of Osiris and Isis extracted from its native royal-ideological frame. The comparison of the magi’s rite with the mysteries is explicit in a Pre-Socratic exegesis of an Orphic theogony, whose text is partially preserved in a charred papyrus found in Derveni in northern Greece. Likewise, we regularly fi nd the Greek ‘Zoroaster’ in the company of or otherwise associated with the ‘divine man’ such as Pythagoras or Empedocles, who, like Orpheus, travels to the under-world at will in quest of ‘true’ knowledge or departed souls. Now, the exist-ence of this whole constellation is a fact of literary evidence. The question is how to account for it and assess its signifi cance for our topic. Can it be a case of the Greek misunderstanding of an ‘alien wisdom’? I consider this view, which is prevalent among scholars who have considered the matter in one respect or another, and argue that it is untenable. If the suggested analysis of the relevant passages of the Derveni text is plausible, we have to admit that (its author thought that) the magi’s sacrifi ce, just like initiation to the mys-teries, had an eschatological signifi cance, and that the Derveni ‘ magoi ’ were Iranian ritual experts. 9 The capacity to make the world immortal at the end of times is attested for their rite in Greek philosophical sources. One would have to conclude, taking into account the Iranian evidence, that the magi’s lore included a nocturnal rite, probably both funerary and initiatory, which aimed at ensuring the soul’s journey to the beyond and a desirable afterlife. Of course, there were differences between the reported magi’s doctrines and the mystic ideology, the most important of which is the idea of redemp-tion from an ‘ancient guilt’ that seems to have been central in the mysteries but not present in our evidence about the magi’s ritual lore. But the absence may simply be due to the loss of pre-Zoroastrian traditions, since we fi nd a"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Introduction 5comparable idea in the Vedic myth of Yama and the Br ā hman \u0004 ic doctrine of sacrifi ce. 10 Yama the immortal accepts to die (a sacrifi cial death) in order to open the path to the realm of immortality for his mortal descendants: this apparently establishes a debt on the part of the latter. I will emphasize the masculine esoteric background of the mysteries in Greek literature (e.g. the apprenticeship of Orpheus with the Daktyloi), that is to say, the initiatory form of the mystery cults. The Greeks unquestionably had an authentic and relatively detailed knowledge of Zoroastrian eschatology. This is the frame in which the assimilation of the magos to the ‘divine man’ must be considered. The comparison of cultural items can be treacherous. One must know what the purpose of the comparison is and in respect of what it is being made. A comparison is a disciplined exaggeration in the service of knowledge. It lifts out and strongly marks certain features within difference as being of possible intellectual signifi cance, expressed in the rhetoric of their being ‘like’ in some stipulated fashion. Comparison provides the means by which we ‘re-vision’ phenomena as our data in order to solve our the-oretical problems. (Smith 1990 , p. 52) There is irrefutable evidence that the da ē vas were worshipped down to the Achaemenid time and beyond among some Iranian populations. The Avestan text of the N ē rangest ā n mentions and seems to permit the nocturnal ‘sacrifi ce of a wolf in the manner of da ē va -worshippers’. Evidently, Zoroastrian magi in some areas did perform chthonic rites dedicated to the da ē vas ; or, in any event, this practice was current at the time. Is it plausible to think that the Achaemenid da ē vas or the da ē vas of the N ē rangest ā n had nothing to do with the G ā thic da ē vas ? My purpose in considering the Greek evidence is simple: the Greeks knew a type of Iranian ritual that took place at night, had an eschatological signifi cance and, apparently, an initiatory pattern. I will argue against contemporary scholarship 11 that the reports and descriptions of the rite cannot be dismissed. The signifi cance of the Greek evidence has not been properly appreciated. This evidence indicates that eschatological concerns handled in special rites were a prominent feature of Iranian religious thought, and parallels the Avestan picture of the da ē va cult. Rivalry between gods and men The idea of rivalry between mortals and gods has received scant attention in the study of ancient religions. 12 This is surprising, since in many ancient cultures exchange in the widest sense was the basis of the relation with gods. In any system of exchange, disagreement and accusation of fraud are always real possibilities. It is certainly embarrassing to point to such phenomena in religion. If the essential dimension of religious life is the elevated sense of the sacred, bickering with the gods does indeed look unseemly. The"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"6 Introductionappropriate religious feelings, according to one phenomenologist of religion, are reverence and helpless awe ( mysterium tremendum ). 13 These feelings are supposed to have a cognitive function: they disclose the sacred and give access to the beyond. Self-interested manipulation of the divine is the b ê te noire of religion. The great German scholar Oldenberg fi nds the R \u0003 gveda thoroughly vitiated with magic and the acquisitive spirit. 14 The Vedic hymn, he notes with an obvious irritation, ‘lacks the eloquence of suffering’, hardly bespeaks the ‘warmth and the depth, the soft trembling of a pious heart’, and ‘knows little of the abysses of misery and guilt’ (Oldenberg 2004 , p. 3). Presumably, these defi ne in the scholar’s mind a ‘religious’ disposition. Thus, e contrario , Oldenberg underwrites Nietzsche’s view of Christianity. 15 It was only in the last few decades of the twentieth century that students of ancient religions conceded as a matter of principle the absence of any clear boundary between ‘religion’ and ‘magic’, each being, for not a few, fi rst and foremost a defi nition. 16 The feeling of dependence on invisible beings that are more powerful than humans is thought to be the psychological basis of religious experience. 17 Communication with these powers is possible, if not for everyone then at least for the qualifi ed few, which role determines their status and function in the society to which they belong. Every religion assumes that gods involve them-selves in human affairs. It is not clear, however, why some of these gods are solicitous while others are malicious. Religious knowledge allows humans to place themselves under the aegis of the former against the mischief of the latter. This is held to be the value of the peculiar knowledge. In return for the protection they extend, the benefi cent gods demand obedience and impose rules of conduct, ritual and ethical, and sometimes amuse themselves with the foibles of their prot é g é s. The hypertrophy of the sense of dependence on the divine seems to have overwhelmed in late antiquity the exchange basis of pagan religions. 18 Feelings of dependence and inadequacy have no inherent limits. Everything can be read as a sign of divine care, testing though it may be; misfortune only proves one’s own guilt. Thomas Mann’s Jacob, having received the news of his favourite son’s death, perches on a rubbish heap in his courtyard, and laments and hurls abuse at Yahweh for days on end. 19 At long last he calms down and, exhausted, refl ects on the fact that despite his offensive behaviour, the god has not reacted. This unresponsiveness he attributes to the almighty’s magnani-mous tolerance; and the inaccessibility of the deity is interpreted as the mark of his majestic stature. In Jacob’s mind, it infi nitely elevates Yahweh in all his positive attributes. 20 A disenchanted mind would have viewed the indifference as an indication of callousness or even of non-existence. Jacob’s god, on the other hand, is one with complete disposition over the world, which nothing other than his own discretion can discipline. Where the sense of dependence is absolute, it is hard to distinguish (resentful) helpless submission from rever-ence. In the ancient world this religious situation was anomalous. The religion and god of total submission would come later."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introduction 7 And why should a mortal not be able to stand up to the gods? In the Iliad 22.23, Apollo and Achilles do not spare each other’s feelings: ‘Nothing for you to fear, no punishment to come. Oh I’d pay you back if I only had the power at my command!’ But mutual mistrust and hostility between gods and mortals are in no way limited to the Greek world. There is no existence more fateful than that of Adam, and there is no god as unforgiving as the god of Genesis. ‘The Tree of Knowledge stood in the garden of God not in order to dis-pense information on good and evil, but as an emblem of judgment over the questioner’. 21 The taunting question that the Lord God addresses to Adam after his transgression, ‘where are thou?’ (Gen 3:10) is of course not a question at all; it reduces not just him but all his descendants to guilt-ridden silence. It is not meant to be answered by Adam in paradise, but reverberate forever in human existence. The word of God, as the shadow of the ‘creative word’, enters the fallen world of man as the judgement sus-pended over him. The human condition – earthly sufferings and death – is born in the Lord God’s curse. But this is not all. The justifi cation of the punishment visited on man is not to be sought only in Adam’s defi ance of the divine command. God’s malice is natural . It is a matter of protecting what makes him superior: ‘And the Lord God said, “Now that the human has become like one of us, knowing good and evil, he may reach out and take as well from the tree of life and live forever”’ (Gen 3:22). So, God drove Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. The meaning of the ori-ginal temptation is plainly stated by the serpent: ‘you will become as gods’ (Gen 3:6). It is, for the god, a matter of eliminating potential rivals. 22 It is not just mortals who appear petty in their rivalry with the gods; the latter are also compromised to no lesser a degree. Zeus contemplates destroying men time and again. We know from both Homer and Hesiod that the ‘god of justice’ never really liked humans. He views them with suspicion. They are belligerent and associated with the Titans, hence tainted. In the Iliad , every god fi nds at least one occasion to vent his or her hostility toward a hero, often mortally, and is in turn defi ed and sometimes belittled by his or her human adversary. But the most charac-teristic testimony on the rivalry between men and gods is due to the very insti-tution that brings them together. Such is the ironic pathos of the Greeks that sacrifi ce, the locus of mortals’ relation with the gods should be the reminder of their mutual suspicion and hostility. 23 Before the fateful event at Mekone, gods and men ate from the same table, the expression par excellence of recip-rocal trust and community ( Theogony 530ff.). 24 Men ‘lived like gods’ then ( Works 110ff.). 25 The ostensible antagonist of the supreme god at Mekone is Prometheus. He deceives the god ‘whose designs do not fail’. For Zeus ‘he laid out meat and entrails rich with fat in the hide, covering it in the ox’s stomach, while for men he laid out the ox’s white bones, which he arranged carefully for a cunning trick by covering them in glistening fat’ ( Theogony 530ff.). Zeus demands what is offered to men ( anthr ō poi ), and thereby seals the god’s share"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"8 Introductionof the sacrifi cial victim from then on. Is it because of the repulsiveness of the stomach ( gast ē r ) that Zeus rejects the part originally presented to the gods? But Hesiod says that Zeus’ intelligence did not fail him, for ‘he recognized the trick and did not mistake it, and he boded evil in his heart for mortal men, which was to come to pass’. From then on, man ( an ē r ) has to work hard for his food hidden in the belly of the earth, which only postpones the inevit-able evil of death, and requires the woman, the ‘pretty bane’, to procreate. For men ‘desirable things are hidden within evils while evils are sometimes hidden within desirable things and sometimes concealed by their invisibil-ity’. Thus ‘human existence is governed, through the gods’ “hiding” opera-tions, by a mixture of goods and evils, by ambiguity and duplicity’ (Vernant 1990 , p. 197). Zeus’ vengeful plan for the anthr ō poi is to suffer the human condition. The god, then, must have welcomed Prometheus’ cunning trick and seen through the deception ( apat ē ); but this did not lessen his rage: ‘wrath reached him to the spirit, when he saw the white ox-bones set for a cunning trick’ ( Theogony 550ff.). 26 Is he angry just because Prometheus has attempted to deceive him ( Theogony 537–41) or, more fundamentally, because the Titan’s fraud ( dolos ) is meant to benefi t men against the wishes of the god? Did Prometheus, the embodiment of foresight, count on the god’s wanting the humans’ share because it was offered to them ? This alone can explain Zeus’ anger: he is not angry because he has been tricked, something that the text explicitly rules out, but because Prometheus has sided with men against the gods. Prometheus counts on the supreme god’s hostility to men. In any case, it is more fi tting, for both protagonists, to imagine that the Titan aimed to deceive the god ‘whose designs do not fail’ with this calculation in mind rather than with ‘deceptive’ appearances. Zeus’ real antagonist is not the Titan but humans, for quite clearly at stake in the myth is the aetiology of not just man’s relationship with the gods but also his way of being. 27 Man is man to the extent that he has to work to prolong his transient life, which he owes to the ‘pretty bane’, and that his sole contact with the divine is through sacrifi ce, the occasion that primordially gave rise to his misery as the myth recalls. In the aetiological myth, the contestation between men and gods is the fundamental ground of the human condition. 28 In the Mah ā bh ā rata , K ā vya U ś anas is the sorcerer who knows the ‘secret of resurrection’. He acts as the purohita ‘chaplain’ for the asuras (demons), to whose fi ght against the devas (gods) he contributes by raising their slain in the war. This is how the Mah ā bh ā rata describes it: All the demons who were killed by the gods in the battle, K ā vya raised again by the power of his knowledge. They rose and recommenced the combat against the gods. On the contrary, the gods that the demons killed on the battlefi eld, Br \u0005 haspati, despite his wisdom, did not restore to life for he did not know the knowledge that K ā vya knew, the science of resurrec-tion, and because of it the gods suffered a great distress. 29"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Introduction 9 In their desperation, the gods turn to Kaca, the son of Br \u0005 haspati, and ask him to present himself as an apprentice to the sorcerer and learn the science from him. 30 Now, the sorcerer is in no way beholden to the asuras . 31 K ā vya is really a magician, characteristically independent, rather than a chaplain. It is not clear why he has sided with the asuras , but it is certainly signifi cant that what mediates his fraught relationship with the gods is his ‘science of resurrection’. What allows the magician to stand apart from the gods is this science, which he evidently possesses in his own right. This situation is reminiscent of the position of the r \u0005 s \u0004 is in the Br ā hman \u0004 as, where gods and men equally owe their (possible) immortality to sacrifi ce. The only difference is that, for men, death is the condition of access. 32 Only in spirit can mortals reach the divine sphere. The gods, having learned the way of sacrifi ce and thereby the access to paradise, try to keep it from men. It is only thanks to Yama, the discoverer of the path to the beyond, and the r \u0005 s \u0004 is , the inspired poets, that humans have a chance of becoming immortal. The Iranian magician-king Kavi Usan (or Usadan), the Pahlavi Kay Us, is also a rebel against the gods. Christensen compared his legend with his pre-decessor, the fi rst man and king Yima (Yim). 33 In Zoroastrian lore, both were born immortal but because of their rivalry with the gods were ‘changed’ 34 into mortal men. Both are builders of enclosures where men never age, and both while king rule over the seven ke š vars and are masters of ‘men and demons’ alike. Dum é zil, like Lommel, compares the Iranian fi gure with the Vedic K ā vya U ś anas, and argues for an Indo-Iranian prototype *Kavi *U ś an, a powerful magician who was especially known for his science of rejuvenation and (immortal) life. 35 The basic likeness of the Iranian and Vedic fi gures can-not be denied. Whether one must infer from it the existence of a common mythical character or, as Christensen maintains, see the Vedic fi gure as based on the Iranian Kavi Usan, who must have been originally a king in eastern Iran, 36 is not important for what is at issue here. The legendary magician-king Kay Us, just like the ‘fi rst man and king’ Yim, is an ambiguous hero who is fundamentally defi ned by his wanting to be god-like. It is certainly no coincidence that at stake in his diffi culties with the gods is his own immor-tality. In the Pahlavi accounts he owes it to Mazd ā , but this may well be a later adjustment. The fact that the magician-king is able to build a fortress ( D ē nkard 9, 22.4) where people do not age and the aged upon entry turn young clearly indicates that originally he had the power of life in his own right. The god did not grant him immortality but took it away, apparently because Kavi Usan aspired to extend his rule to the divine domain. Iranian Yima is ever only human; nonetheless he rivals Mazd ā not only in cosmo-gonic activities but also in the work of immortality. Jean Kellens argues that Yima’s refusal in the V ı \u0002 d ē vd ā d 2 to accept the da ē n ā (‘religion’) is in effect the refusal to die, to pass in spirit to the beyond. 37 On his own initiative, he established an immortal world through the exercise of his ‘magic’ power – ‘as long as he exercised his power’ (Y 9.5). Does the eventual failure of his project indicate the impossibility of corporeal immortality? In Zoroastrian"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"10 Introductionlore Yima is accused of an unpardonable wrong, which, one way or another, comes down to his rivalry with the god. 38 One may wish to interpret such rivalry myths as cautionary tales, thereby quickly reabsorbing into ‘religion’ the troublesome episodes. This is the way they are normally understood in the studies of ancient religions. The atti-tude to the phenomenon is in fact rooted in our ‘monotheistic’ mental habit. Hostility to the one almighty, benevolent god can only mean perversion or insanity. It had to be different within the polytheistic frame of ancient reli-gions. 39 The gods were playful and adventurous and could be counted on one against the other. The aetiological connections that the ‘rivalry myths’ have with the human condition 40 incline one to think that these myths also express something essential about the divine. I do not propose to explain what this might be, but it is certainly signifi cant that in many instances the point of contention is human mortality. It seems that a contentious relationship with the gods, on whose good will human happiness depended, was not a strange phenomenon in ancient myths and stories. The afterlife The images of existence after death in ancient religions are basically of two kinds. The type that is perhaps older depicts the afterlife as an unpalatable existence in a dreary underworld. This is the fate that awaits all humans regardless of their achievements, moral or heroic, in their earthly lives, as Athena explains to Telemachus in Odyssey 3. 236ff. In the Epic of Gilgamesh (the Old Babylonian version), annihilation seems to be the horrid outcome that is in store for Gilgamesh: ‘[spoken by the alewife:] Gilgamesh, where do you roam? / You will not fi nd the eternal life you seek. / When the gods created mankind / They appointed death for mankind, Kept eternal life in their own hands’. 41 It may be that ‘death’ refers to ‘ghostlike’ existence in the underworld. 42 In the Hebrew Bible, Sheol , the abode of the dead, is just like the Mesopotamian underworld, an abyssal pit, the ‘land of darkness’, permanently removed from the light of God (Job 10:21–22). The Homeric Hades belongs to this type (Gantz 1993 , pp. 123–35). Even the heroes are destined to go there: ‘the Achaeans... hurling down to the house of Hades, strong souls of heroes’ ( Iliad 1.3ff.). Book 11 of the Odyssey in which Odysseus relates his encounters in Hades gives us the canonical picture of the Homeric underworld (cf. Sourvinou-Inwood 1995 , pp. 17ff.). Achilles’ ghost reacts to Odysseus’ praise of him as one honoured like a god in life and the ruler of the dead in Hades in these words: ‘Nay, seek not to speak to me soothingly of death, glorious Odysseus. By god, I should rather slave on earth for another man – some dirt-poor tenant farmer who scrapes to keep alive – than rule down here over all the breathless dead’ ( Odyssey 11.547ff.). The images of the afterlife belonging to the second type portray a desir-able condition. But it is only vouchsafed to a privileged group. 43 The slain warriors of the Old Norse saga go to Valhalla where, just as they did in"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Introduction 11life, they fi ght and carouse. The race of heroes in Hesiod’s Works and Days , too, enjoys a privileged afterlife: ‘These dwell with carefree heart in the Isles of the Blessed Ones, beside deep-swirling Oceanus: fortunate Heroes, for whom the grain-giving soil bears its honey-sweet fruits thrice a year’ ( Works 170ff.). In Odyssey 4.332–592 Menelaus is exceptionally saved from death and transferred to Elysium, representing the ‘belief in an immortality for a select few in the epics’, according to Sourvinou-Inwood ( 1995 , p. 54), ‘an eschatological strand that was to develop signifi cantly in post-Homeric times and provide models of hope for the afterlife to ordinary mortals’. In Pindar’s Olympian 2 ( c .70), the same location is preserved for those who manage to keep themselves ‘pure’ in three incarnations. They thus join the race of her-oes. There are more or less clear indications that the initiates of the mystery cults imagined an afterlife of celebrations and festivals similar to those of the Eleusinian mysteries – but only for themselves. A privileged postmortem fate after a distinguished earthly career must have made sense, whether the latter was that of a hero, of an initiate, or of a morally upright person as we fi nd in Plato. The image of paradise in a R \u0003 gvedic hymn to Soma, the sacri-fi cial drink and deity, is virtually identical with what we fi nd in the Avesta: one is ‘made immortal’ in a ‘deathless undecaying world, wherein the light of heaven is set, and everlasting lustre shines... where are those waters young and fresh... where they move even as they list, in the third sphere of inmost heaven... where spirit’s food and refreshment are found... in that realm where joys and delights... and longings of desire are fulfi lled’ (RV 9 113.7ff.). Free movement, fulfi lment of every desire, inexhaustible refreshment, an ever-young, joyous existence – these ‘boons’ are requested from the god of a (probably) stimulating sacrifi cial drink. The (simulated) ecstatic experience of the drinker may be assumed to have given a foretaste of the heavenly bliss he expected from the god. In what it reveals about the particular type of rite that gave rise to the mentioned image of the afterlife, however, the signifi cance of the sacrifi cial drink cannot be reduced to the exalted state it induced. The earliest accounts of a desirable afterlife tell us that only the duly quali-fi ed were entitled to look forward to it. The ritual settings such as we fi nd in the R \u0003 gvedic hymn to Soma, in the mysteries, or in the G ā thic picture of the cult of the da ē vas , indicate an initiatory background, probably in the tradition of the masculine esoteric association. Some of the legends told of fi gures like Orpheus, Empedocles or Pythagoras, who were intimately associ-ated with the mysteries, are of the shamanistic type. 44 The most telling fea-ture that distinguishes the type is the visit to the underworld. 45 Our evidence comprises two sets of data that are more or less well established: images of the desirable afterlife restricted to a qualifi ed few, on the one hand, and, on the other, accounts of related rites with features such as secrecy, nocturnal celebration, eccentric behaviour and the ‘ecstatic’ state, sometimes induced by the consumption of drugs. They point to the aristocratic milieu of warriors’ associations – specifi cally their esoteric rites, initiatory and funerary – as the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"12 Introductionlikely provenance of individualistic eschatological concerns, documented, for instance, in the hieroi logoi of the mysteries or in the G ā th ā s. It seems that the most ancient Greek conception of the qualifi cation for a ‘blessed’ afterlife restricts the privilege to the heroic warrior. 46 Later, others too may look for-ward to the happy outcome, provided they are properly ‘purifi ed’. The scheme of ritual initiation is pivotal in both and connects the two, to judge from the Greek and G ā thic material. The presumed eschatological quest of the aristo-cratic warrior is consonant with his desire, refl ected in the epic, of having his exploits preserved. The warrior and the poet had a symbiotic relationship. It was the poet that ensured the ‘imperishable fame’ ( aphthiton kleos ) of the warrior and thus gave him a claim to immortality. In the Symposium (208c) fame is one way of attaining immortality. Watkins and Nagy have shown the Indo-European lineage of the phrase and the sentiment it expresses. 47 The locus classicus of the theme is the famous speech of Achilles to Odysseus in the Iliad (9.410ff.): For my mother the goddess, silver-footed Thetis tells me that twofold fates are bearing me toward the doom of death: if I abide here and play my part in the siege of Troy, then lost is my home-return, but my renown shall be imperishable; but if I return home to my dear native land, lost is then my glorious renown, yet shall my life long endure, neither shall the doom of death come upon me quickly. The fi fth-century doxographer Stobaeus ( Ecl. 1.41.60) has preserved an excerpt of Porphyry’s allegorical interpretation of the Odyssey as a descrip-tion of the career of the soul. The fate of the psych ē after death only comes into focus with the Pre-Socratics and the mysteries, but already in Hesiod, as I mentioned, the hero is given the privilege of a blessed afterlife. The theme of conquering death, of ‘return to light and life’, constitutes an important dimension of the hero’s career in Homeric Greece, as has been shown by Douglas Frame ( 1978 ) in his admirable book The Myth of Return in Early Greek Epic . It does not make much sense to try to distinguish shamanistic and warrior initiation types in Greek myths. In my opinion, the story of Orpheus’ Korybantic discipleship and certain features of mystic initiation make it very likely that the mysteries inherited their form from the mascu-line esoteric association, where the heroic concern with the fate of one’s soul must have been paramount. 48 Coalescence with specifi cally shamanistic motifs, or adoption of shamanistic techniques, could have taken place in the context of funerary rites. 49 The dead hero or the dying god gave the per-fect occasion to imagine the realm of the dead and seek the knowledge of the go ē s , that is to say, the adept of passage to the beyond. In the classical Greek mind, the magos belonged with the mantic initiator of the myster-ies, not only in respect of certain traits of their rites, but also insofar as the concern with the fate of the soul was a prominent feature of their respective ideological landscapes."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Introduction 13 Notes 1 Compare Pirart 1996 , pp. 6–7; Kellens and Swennen 2005 ; Cantera 2012 . 2 See Heesterman 1962 , pp. 8–11 for the d ī ks \u0004 ita and Bremmer 1983 , pp. 92–93 for the Homeric material. 3 See Kellens 2012b , pp. 471–72.

Kellens has of course modifi ed his views somewhat, but the G ā th ā s are still for him liturgical compositions addressed to deities, etc. within the religious horizon of the Vedic hymns.

See in particular Kellens 2007 , pp. 434–36. 6 Panaino ( 2004 , pp. 103–105) rightly insists on the religious dimension of the G ā th ā s and on the intention expressed therein to impact societal norms (whatever the scope of the impact may be).

Although Jonathan Z. Smith never discusses this topic, his non-hierophantic conception of ritual and religion is in my mind commensurable with the perspective adopted here. See in particular the essays in Smith 1988 . In his contribution to Hamerton-Kelly 1987, Smith describes his views in somewhat pro-vocative terms: ‘ritual is the realm of the “little”, the “petty”, the “trivial”... ritual is “no big deal”. The object of action that receives ritual attention is, more often than not, commonplace. The choice of this or that object for ritual attention often appears arbitrary. But what is of prime importance is its infi nite and infi nitesimal elaboration’ (Smith 1987 , pp. 194–95). 13 See Otto 1958 . 14 See Oldenberg 2004 , pp. 2–4. 15 Nietzsche’s god would ‘ only do wrong’, thereby freeing life from guilt: ‘it is not divine to take the punishment upon oneself – it is divine to take on the guilt ’ (Nietzsche 2005 , p. 80). 16 See Versnel 1991 . Compare Bianchi 1975 and Assmann 2006 , pp. 139–54, for the place of magic in Egyptian religious lore. ‘Magic, it is generally agreed today, refers to no objective reality; magic differs from religion as weeds differ from fl ow-ers, merely by negative social evaluation’ (Parker 2005 , p. 122). 17 See, for example, Bianchi 1975 , p. 33. 18 See Brown’s illuminating works on late antiquity and the emergence of the Christian church, e.g. Brown 1978 . The rise of the mortal ‘agents of the supernat-ural’ characterizes the period (Brown 1978 , pp. 11–26).

It wasn’t on its account that we were expelled from Paradise, but because of the Tree of Life, lest we eat of its fruit’ (Kafka 2006 , p. 82). 23 See Vernant’s admirable essay on Hesiod’s Prometheus in Vernant 1990 , pp. 183–201. 24 Compare Sourvinou-Inwood 1986 . I cannot agree with her interpretation of the commensality of men and gods as basically a negative motif, i.e. a fraught situ-ation of transgressing the boundaries of the human condition that only leads to bestiality. See note 28 below. 25 Vernant ( 1989 ) convincingly identifi es the men of ‘gold race’ from Works and Days with those who share the gods’ table before the dispute at Mekone in the Theogony . 26 See Gantz 1993 , pp. 152–66. Compare Vernant 1990 , p. 186: ‘He [Prometheus] “offers” to Zeus the portion of beef that seems appetizing but is, in reality, inedible. Zeus accepts this share that appears to be the best one and so is tricked (although this trickery is in effect an integral part of the metis Zeus has premeditated in order to undo mankind). Zeus is angry’. In fact, Zeus asks for the part that is ostensibly offered to men. The success of the cunning design should rule out anger on the part of the designer. How to understand Zeus’ anger? 27 Compare Rudhardt’s comment: ‘la crise de M é con è a d é j à commenc é , il y a d é j à contestation entre les hommes et les dieux, lorsque Prom é th é e intervient. L’objet de cette contestation doit ê tre ce dont l’action prom é th é enne va d é fi nir les modal-it é s, soit, pr é cis é ment, le sacrifi ce’ (Rudhardt and Reverdin 1981 , p. 28). The story ‘defi nes the status of man, midway between that of the beasts and that of the gods: It is characterized by sacrifi ce, fi re for culinary and technical operations, the woman seen both as a wife and as a bestial stomach, and cereal foods and agricul-tural labor’ (Vernant 1990 , p. 192). 28 Despite what has been claimed (e.g. Sourvinou-Inwood 1986 , p. 54) Sisyphus is not a trickster fi gure, for he is not a (foolish) rascal. Regarding the Plains Indians’ ‘Old Man-Coyote’, an archetypal trickster fi gure, see Harrod 1987 , pp. 54–65. Sisyphus’ crime in the Odyssey 11 is his attempt to escape death. This defi ance is the core of the myth, as Sourvinou-Inwood ( 1986 , pp. 50–51) acknowledges. For Sourvinou-Inwood ( 1986 , pp. 52ff.) the Sisyphus myth belongs to the type of story that limits human aspirations by articulating the boundaries of the human condition and setting out the dire consequences of wanting to transgress these. The punishment imposed on Sisyphus recalls his attempt to escape to the upper world and the futility of the adventure. ‘Myths of transgression help defi ne the normative’ (Sourvinou-Inwood 1986 , p. 57). This reading, in my view, over-states the similarities of the Sisyphus myth with those of Tityus and Tantalus. It assigns to it the intention of representing the place of humans in the cosmic order. ‘Thus the three “sinners” in Odyssey 11 illustrate the offenses of forbidden sex, forbidden food, forbidden life; as – among other things – paradigms of these"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Introduction 15transgressions they help articulate the existence of, and the need to respect, the cultural rules governing men’s relationship with the gods, life and death and each other’ (Sourvinou-Inwood 1986 , p. 55). This interpretation is an application of the general structuralist thesis (cf. Sourvinou-Inwood 1995 , pp. 20–21) of the so-called Paris School, which she shares: ‘It is in myth that the limits of the human condition and of proper behaviour and the exploration of its transgression are explored’ (Sourvinou-Inwood 1986 , p. 54). One must admit, for instance, that it is strange to include among ‘cultural rules governing men’s relationship with the gods’ a rule which forbids sex with a deity, presumably when it is initiated by a mortal, since gods regularly ravish mortals in myths. But Tityus is not a man at all. Nor is the ‘prohibition’ in any way meaningful. The myth of Tityus does not belong to the group of myths (of banishment) that may be understood as defi ning the human condition in reference to an ideal state, e.g. a very long life without toil, commensality with gods and hence eating the same type of food, and generation without sex. The opposite of current human diet (e.g. meat consumed at sacrifi ce and cultivated cereals) is the food shared with the gods in illo tempore ; the oppos-ite of procreation through sex is autochthonous generation that men ( anthr ō poi ) enjoyed before their falling out with the gods – and not sex with the gods. Compare Vernant 1990 , pp. 151–52, 173–75. How one should assess the signifi cance of the myths of a ‘past’ ideal state is not my concern here. In my mind, one detail of the Sisyphus myth, probably belonging to its earliest layer, points in a different direction. Sisyphus was apparently a universal king with unrestrained ambitions. The myth must have contained a circumstance that explained Sisyphus’ premature departure for Hades. When Ares captures the fugitive Sisyphus and hands him over to Thanatos, the cunning king asks to be allowed to speak to his wife. He then secretly orders her ‘to send no more sacrifi ces down to the king and queen of the realm of the dead’ (Ker é nyi 1974 , p. 76). When the netherworld rulers receive no libations and offerings for a long time they agree to let him go to the upper world in order to remedy the problem. Ker é nyi ( 1974 , p. 76) points out that it ‘seems from this tale that Sisyphos was not only a primaeval man but also a primaeval king and lord of almost the whole earth’. If Ker é nyi’s inference is accepted, Sisyphus’ status and his ambitions (notably to escape death) make him, like the Iranian fi gures I presently introduce, a rival of the gods. 29 See Dum é zil 1971 , p. 161. 30 See Dum é zil 1971 , pp. 160–76. 31 See Dum é zil 1971 , p. 175: ‘il se sent plus proche de Br \u0005 haspati, le chapelain des dieux, que des d é mons qu’il sert: maglr é la guerre, il accueil le fi ls de Br \u0005 haspati comme disciple et le prot è ge contre les d é mons que scandalise et inqui è te à juste titre cette pr é sence ennemie, et fi nalement il lui livre le secret qui jusqu’alors, à tra-vers lui seul, faisait la sup é riorit é des d é mons’. 32 See my discussion in the fi nal chapter. 33 See Christensen 1931 , pp. 79–80. 34 See Christensen 1931 , p. 75. According to the Pahlavi text M ē n ō g ı \u0002 Xrat, Yim, Fr ē d ō n and Kay Us were immortal but were deceived by Ahriman and ‘changed’ into mortals. The nature of the deception was related in the case of Kay Us in the now lost Su \u0006 dgar Nask, whose outlines is given in the Pahlavi D ē nkard 9, 22.5–6. The demon X ē š m corrupts the king’s soul and as a result he is no longer content with his sovereignty on earth but wants to rule over the heavens too. Hence he offends against the gods. 35 See Dum é zil 1971 , pp. 153–57, 173–205; Kellens 2000 , pp. 248–49. 36 See Christensen 1931 , p. 28 n. 2.

What is said about the nature of Yima’s sin in the G ā th ā s may be more substantial than the rather obscure Y 32.8. ‘Il est possible que la triple faute de Yima (Yt 19. 34–38) soit en rapport avec la triple extension de la terre... et elle a peut- ê tre consist é , dans la confrontation avec la diffi cult é , à soup ç onner Ahura Mazd ā de mensonge...

Even within the Zoroastrian frame represented in V ı \u0002 d ē vd ā d 2, the fi gure remains problematic: his divine commission does not include the immortalization of earthly creatures, which he undertakes on his own initiative. ‘L’homme Yima a successivement rejet é un plan divin et modifi é un autre’ (Kellens 2012a , p. 13). 39 Yahwism was not monotheistic by the standards of the later Judaism. See De Moor 1997 and Bott é ro 2000 . It was primarily characterized by an exclusive allegiance to one god. There was also a strong tendency toward exclusive worship among the Mesopotamian cities of the second millennium BC , since the worship was basically the daily maintenance of the gods in their cult images. See Bott é ro 2001 . Compare Assmann 2006 , pp. 65–70, 2008 , pp. 90–126 on the role of ‘revealed’ texts in recast-ing the question of the plurality of religious traditions in Abrahamic religions in terms of the opposition between ‘true’ and ‘false’ religions. 40 To add another tale about the diffi cult relationship between gods and men to our list, I recall the Mesopotamian myth of Atrahasis. See Dalley 1989 , pp. 1–38. The myth presumably ‘explained’ why the denizens of the Mesopotamian temple cities of the third millennium BC lived the way they did. The primary task of the citi-zenry, ‘offi cially’, was the service of the gods. But why present this as a settlement on the back of confl icts? In the myth, men remind themselves they are only human and not gods. This is, however, only one side of the issue. The settlement with the gods also gives humans a breathing space, to speak with Kafka. The ‘whole world of the gods’, he writes about the Greeks, ‘was only a way to keep that which was decisive at a distance from the earthly body, to provide air for human breath’ (Kafka 2006 , p. 127). 41 See Dalley 1989 , p. 150. 42 See Dalley 1989 , pp. 120–25. The snake that steals the plant of ‘rejuvenation’ in the Sumerian version (Dalley 1989 , p. 119) and thus thwarts Gilgamesh’s enterprise is not so much an infernal creature as a symbol of fate. 43 See Sourvinou-Inwood 1995 , pp. 49–56. 44 ‘The shaman is pre-eminently an ecstatic. Now on the plane of primitive religions ecstasy signifi es the soul’s fl ight to Heaven, or its wanderings about the earth, or, fi nally its descent to the subterranean world, among the dead. The shaman under-takes these ecstatic journeys for four reasons: fi rst, to meet the God of Heaven face to face and bring him an offering from the community; second, to seek the soul of a sick man, which has supposedly wandered away from his body or been carried off by demons; third, to guide the soul of a dead man to its new abode; fourth, to add to his knowledge by frequenting higher beings’ (Eliade 1958 , p. 95). I empha-size that at issue, e.g. in the mysteries, is not specifi c shamanic techniques such as climbing trees or ‘magic fl ight’, etc. but a character type, such as the ‘divine man’, that shares some of the abilities of the shaman. What genetic connection there might have been between the shaman of the north and central Asia and the yogi or the mantis can only be a matter of speculation. Compare Eliade 1964 , pp. 407ff.

Assimilation of certain elements of the sha-manistic ideology by warrior clubs is possible, but not genetic development of the M ä nnerbund rites from the shamanic initiation per se. See my discussion in the fi nal part of the book. 45 The Odysseus myth as we fi nd in the Odyssey may be understood as a visit to the underworld and return to life. See Frame 1978 . Versnel ( 1993 ) asserts the shaman-istic background of the myth against casting it as a simple initiatory scheme. ‘In the context of “eccentric” experiences there is quite a difference between the state-ment that Odysseus represents a youth during his initiation and the well-known theory that both fairy-tales and (a specifi c type of) myths, including the one of Odysseus, go back to shaman tales – the records of their ecstatic experiences in the “other world”’ (Versnel 1993 , p. 72 n.147). Compare Meuli 1935 , pp. 153ff. 46 See Sourvinou-Inwood 1995 , pp. 49–70. 47 See Nagy 1999 , pp. 26–41; and Watkins 1995 , pp. 68–93, pp. 173–78. 48 Compare Vernant 1991 , pp. 220–43. 49 See Vernant 2006 , pp. 321–32. Seasonal and fertility rites are a different matter. See Smith 1990 , pp. 91–104. Versnel and others see in the Babylonian New Year akitu a ‘reversal festival’, where the king is ritually humiliated, etc.; and more generally he understands the myth related in the Epic of Creation ( Enuma Elish ) as compris-ing the ‘scenario’ of the New Year ‘ritual drama’, whereby the restoration of the king and his sacred marriage ensures the renewal of the world. See Versnel 1993 , pp. 32–37. Smith ( 1978 , pp. 71–74) rejects this interpretation – rightly in my mind. The humiliated king, according to him, is not a ‘pious Babylonian king’ but an impious invader brought to submission, then restored by the god of the city, hav-ing declared his allegiance. ‘The Hellenistic Babylonian New Year festival is either a repetition of an earlier ritual typologically understood to describe the current situation of foreign domination, to have contemporary political as well as religious implications; or the text is a new, Hellenistic composition’ (72). Smith suggests to view apocalypticism as ‘wisdom lacking a royal patron’, where the disappearance of the ‘native’ royalty, which presided over the renewal of rightful rule and law in the land, leads either to ‘prophecy against foreigners rather than in favor of a spe-cifi c king’, or the ‘cosmicization’ of the king, ‘a thorough-going apocalypse’ (81).

"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" Part I Preamble The status of the da ē vas in the G ā th ā s is one of the major issues of Avesta scholarship. In the Young Avestan texts the word da ē va has the sense of demon, and the da ē vas have more or less the same nature as other mischievous supernatural beings. In the G ā th ā s, on the other hand, the word seems to designate divine beings, however much disapproved. The present consensus of scholars about the ‘original’ divinity of the da ē vas has a troubled history behind it, not just scientifi c debates but also ideological polemics. 1 This makes the agreement all the more signifi cant. What does it mean, though, and what exactly is at stake in it? What has been settled and what is still outstanding? In the conclusion to his book on the history of Avesta scholarship, La quat-ri è me naissance de Zarathushtra , Kellens gives an idea of where things stand today with regard to our topic: La situation, on en conviendra, n’est pas banale: qu’a-t-il bien pu se passer pour qu’un peuple renverse le titre de dieu en celui de d é mon? Notre itin é raire s’est achev é au c œ ur de cette question qui n’a jamais re ç u de r é ponse ad é quate. La d é monisation des daivas ne peut ê tre une par-ticularit é globalement iranienne... car il fut un temps o ù les Iraniens ont appel é leur dieux daivas , et certaines tribus sur la longue dur é e, comme en t é moignent l’inscription de Xerx è s au Ve si è cle avant l’ è re commune et l’onomastique sogdienne au IXe si è cle apr è s. (Kellens 2006 , p. 149) Kellens’ statement that the question of the Iranian treatment of the da ē vas has not been given an adequate answer to date requires utmost attention. Twelve years earlier he had dismissed the same ‘t é moins’ (Kellens 1994 , pp. 15–16) and asserted that the demonic status of the da ē vas is a ‘constitutive and fundamental fact of the language and religious mentality of the Iranians’ (Kellens 1994 , p. 26). According to Kellens in Le panth é on , the separation of Vedic Indians and Iranians is the formative event not just of their linguistic but also of their religious histories. The da ē vas were never Iranian gods. This position itself is at odds with his view of the matter a few years earlier in the Introduction to Les textes vieil-avestiques , where we read that the da ē vas , the"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"22 Part I: Preamble‘traditional gods of the Indo-Iranian pantheon’, were indeed the gods of the ‘G ā thic circle’ some time in its past, and that it is precisely their condemnation that constitutes the circle’s ‘religious innovation’ (Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 30). These signifi cant changes in Kellens’ view of the matter show its elusive nature. In this part I will analyse the terms and frames in which the question of the character of the da ē vas in the G ā th ā s has been posed in Avesta scholarship. The repudiation of the da ē vas in the G ā th ā s and the signifi cance of this condemnation have been broached in Western scholarship in four perspec-tives: the (1) monotheistic, (2) ahura -cult, (3) ethno-historical and (4) ritual-istic frames. I will examine them one by one in the following four chapters. We will see that all four are problematic, some more seriously than others, and fail to account for the G ā thic treatment of the da ē vas . The aim of the discussion is to be conceptually comprehensive with respect to the issues and claims raised in the four perspectives regarding the status of the da ē vas in the G ā th ā s . Notes 1 How else should one interpret Duchesne-Guillemin’s mention of his colleagues’ reli-gious persuasions in his compte-rendu of their views of Zarathu š tra (Duchesne-Guillemin 1995 , pp. 39–48)? He believes that their religious convictions are relevant for a proper evaluation of their debates.

It is the prophet’s business to denounce false gods and advocate the one true god, in analogy with the stereotype Biblical prophet. 1 If those who support this thesis have gone beyond this simple affi rmation and discussed the status of the da ē vas in the G ā th ā s, it has been for the purpose of proving their view against their opponents. For Bartholomae ( 1924 ) in Zarathu š tras Leben und Lehre , the basic innovation of Zarathu š tra is his replacement of polytheism with monothe-ism (Bartholomae 1924 , p. 12). But it is not just a matter of denouncing the inherited gods or renaming them (e.g. Agni becomes A \u0007 tar). More is needed if all associations with the inherited deities are to be dissolved. The very appellation ‘god’ is tainted. ‘Gods’ ( da ē vas ) become ‘false gods’. The word da ē va (‘god’) then gives way to ahura , also meaning ‘god’, recalled from obscurity by the prophet for the purpose of serving as divine appellation in his new religion. It is only later that the dualism of god and ‘false god’ (or idol: ‘G ö tze’) coarsens into that of god and devil (‘Teufel’). The introduc-tion of monotheism centred on Mazd ā is the fi rst stage of the ‘development’ of Zarathu š tra’s doctrine. But the second stage, that of dualism, already compromises the inchoate monotheism. ‘Das Gr ü beln ü ber die Herkunft des dem Menschen Sch ä dlichen, des B ö sen und Falschen in der Welt brachte den Propheten in Widerspruch zu der von ihm selber gelehrten monothe-istischen Weltanschauung mit dem einen guten Gott’ (Bartholomae 1924 , p. 13). Bartholomae understands Zoroastrian dualism as a solution to the problem of evil posed by Zarathu š tra’s monotheism, which is itself sim-ply assumed or rather conjured up through the assimilation of the ‘Iranian prophet’ to the fi gure of Biblical prophet: Zoroastrianism is ‘entitled’ to the description ‘monotheism’ just as much as Semitic religions and in particular Christianity (Bartholomae 1924 , p. 13). Apparently, for Bartholomae, the problem of the existence of evil in the world is irresolvable within the mono-theistic framework (see below). After all, even in the fi rst stage, the sup-posed monotheism is no sooner pronounced than withdrawn. The uneasy"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"24 Monotheistic thesisrelation between monotheism and dualism is in part due to the divergent motivations that inform them. Dualism is supposed to be the prophet’s answer to the question of the existence of evil. Having set up his one true god, Zarathu š tra realized that the existence of evil in the world remained unexplained; or if this is intellectualizing the issue, he did not want the slur of evil to taint the character of his benevolent god. Hence there had to be powerful dark forces and evil men that were responsible for the misery and cruelty one observed in the world. The exculpation of the one true god in the face of evil becomes an overriding concern as soon as it is noticed that a contradiction exists between his goodness and his uniqueness as an all-powerful god. In the perspective taken by Bartholomae and others who fol-low him, the thesis of monotheism gives rise to the dualistic justifi cation of the benevolent god, which nonetheless undermines the monotheism it was invoked to armour. As in the Augustinian theodicy, the postulate of the ‘free will’ is used in this perspective for exculpating the monotheistic god. The principle of free will is important for Augustine because it allows him to divert the responsibility for evil away from his God. 2 Free will is nothing if it is determined by external causes. The extent to which this principle is a theodicy motif can be seen in Augustine’s argument in De libero arbitrio that humans are not able to have a good volition in the absence of grace ( De lib. arb . 3.18.51). Humans do not have to be evil. If they are, it is their choice and responsibility, not God’s; but at the same time, they cannot be good on their own and require God’s grace to be so. They are responsible for their sins to the extent that they use the ‘good’ (e.g. free will) created by God for perverse ends. The original accus-ation raised against God is thus reduced to the seemingly manageable ques-tion: why does God create a creature with free will? The answer is: ‘because it is good’. It is true that this is a tautological answer, since everything God creates is good. Still, it diverts the original accusation, albeit at the expense of the perspicuity of the explanation: one exchanges a culpable God for a mys-terious God, which expresses nothing more than the limits of human intellect. But Augustine feels the weight of the question: why would a free creature turn away from its creator, and whence the perversion? But perhaps you are going to ask: since the will is moved when it turns away from an immutable good to a mutable good, from whence does this movement arise? It [the movement] is actually evil, even though a free will is to be counted among the good things, since without it no one can live rightly. For if that movement, that is, the will’s turning away from the Lord God, is without doubt a sin, how can we say that God is the author of the sin? Thus the movement will not be from God. From whence then will it come? If I respond thus to your querying – that I do not know – perhaps you will be disappointed – but nevertheless I would respond truly. For that which is nothing cannot be known. ( De lib. arb . 2.20.54)"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Monotheistic thesis 25 Augustine’s casuistry aside, his disowning of the fi nal question has its logic: the unmotivated turn away from God has to be either completely arbitrary or grounded in human nature. Augustine chooses the fi rst, since the second would again point the fi nger of accusation at God. Augustine’s doctrine of free will as a theodicy must be placed in the context of his battle against Manichaean dualism. 3 It is meant to justify the one cre-ator god. The concerns and motives of such a theodicy, whether purely dual-istic or ‘ethical’, or indeed a mixture of the two, are in no way native to the G ā th ā s. They are pressing only for a mind that is steeped in Judeo-Christian monotheism and is exercised by its theological problems. The scholar imports into the G ā th ā s the theodicy motif along with the assumption of G ā thic monotheism: an accused God must be as intolerable for the Iranian ‘thinker’ as it is for the Christian theologian. Then, the scholar will have to deal with the problem of reconciling monotheism with dualism, introduced in order to exculpate the one true God in the face of evil. From the beginning this problem, which obsesses the mind of the proponent of G ā thic monotheism, supplants the question of the repudiation of the da ē vas in the G ā th ā s, per-ceived as natural for a monotheistic religion. The trajectory of Plato’s the-ology from the Republic to the Laws shows the dualistic consequences of the concern with the problem of evil once the highest being is defi ned in moral terms. Under the pressure of the identifi cation of the ‘Good’ with the divine nous (cf. Philebus 22c), the monotheistic tendency of his philosophical out-look leads not to monotheism but to cosmological dualism. In the Republic 617e evil in the world is accounted to human freedom, but in the Laws 896e and 906a Plato seems to place the blame at the door of a cosmic evil, the rival of the good demiurge. Plato’s overriding moral-philosophical motive in forming his conception of the divine is well known. In the Timaeus 37a, for instance, he defi nes the good demiurge as ‘the best of everything which can be comprehended by thought and which is eternal’. This little statement is the birthplace, or perhaps the baptism, 4 of the concept of god, e.g. in Christian theology. The concern with the moral goodness of a god that has disposition over the world inevitably leads to the limitation of his powers. 5 Scholars working within Bartholomae’s frame emphasize the ‘ethical’ motivation that he sees underlying the dualistic ‘second stage’ and quickly pass over Zarathu š tra’s supposed monotheism, whose nature becomes ever more elusive. The affi rmation of G ā thic monotheism, if not simply assumed, is asserted on supposed typological grounds, as we will see in detail in the works of Pettazzoni and Gnoli. One can see how this obligatory double ref-erence creates formidable diffi culties in understanding the process of the ‘demonization’ of the ‘old gods’. The postulation of monotheism obliges the prophet to view the da ē vas as false gods, that is, non-existent; dualism, on the other hand, requires the existence of the ‘powers of darkness’ strong enough to stand their ground against the benevolent god. The interpreter thus feels pressed to dissolve the fi rst moment, i.e. monotheism, quickly whether by making it a ‘cultural background’ or assigning it to a different dimension,"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"26 Monotheistic thesis‘theological’, which is for all intents and purposes an empty tag. Then, the so-called ‘ethical dualism’ becomes the basic principle of understanding the ‘demonization’. Henning ( 1951 ) sees in ‘ethical dualism’ the differentia specifi ca of Zoroastrian religion. It seems to me [he says] that a dualism of this kind can have been built only on a pre-existing monotheism, on the belief that one God, a good God, was responsible for the world. For this reason I would claim that the religion in which Zoroaster grew up was purely monotheistic. Zoroaster’s religion (as are most dualistic movements) is best understood as a protest against monotheism . Wherever a monotheistic religion establishes itself, this protest is voiced – if there is a man with a brain in his head. Any claim that the world was created by a good and benevolent god must provoke the question why the world, in the outcome, is so very far from good. Zoroaster’s answer, that the world had been created by a good god and an evil spirit, of equal power, who set out to spoil the good work, is a complete answer: it is a logical answer. (Henning 1951 , p. 46) Zarathu š tra was ‘a man with a brain in his head’ (the ‘thinker’) who under-stood that two sides are needed, because it would be illogical to reckon the evil in the world to a benevolent creator. Or, to put it in another way: two sides are needed, of ‘equal powers’, if the good side is to be kept free of evil. Generally speaking, the idea that monotheism thought-through gives rise to a dualistic protest is a take-it-or-leave-it assertion. Obviously, one cannot say that monotheism as such leads to dualism. The primacy of the moral qualifi cation of the one god and the philosophical demand for the consist-ency of the proposed theodicy are the necessary conditions for the dualistic development. From the other side, not every dualism has developed from monotheism, as a protest against it. Manichaean and Marcionite dualisms, despite their differences, are based on the antagonism of creation and sal-vation: material life itself is evil. It is not the creator god that has to be defended against the charge of allowing evil to take place in the world. There is, on the one hand, the evil creator of the material world and, on the other, the saving god of ‘spirits’ imprisoned in matter – there are not two crea-tors, one benevolent and one malevolent. 6 The view that the one creator god stands in need of justifi cation (under Gnostic pressure) in the face of evil in the world and that this justifi cation consists in fi nding another agent (i.e. possessed of ‘free will’) to take on the responsibility for evil – this theodicy goes back to Augustine and his polemics against Gnosticism, and is foreign to the Avesta. Aside from this, Henning’s argument, strikingly formulated as it may be, runs into serious problems as soon as one tries to work out what this ‘protest’ implies. The perception of evil in the world under the conditions stated above"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Monotheistic thesis 27leads to the postulation of an evil or mischievous cosmic creator (whether beside the good one or uniquely). That Augustine thought he could solve his theodicy problem by invoking man’s free will – making man responsible – should not be taken as a contrary proof. 7 In any case, the Augustinian pos-tulate of free will is not oriented to the ‘moral dignity’ of man. The idea that the specifi c ‘moral’ achievement of Zarathu š tra is his ‘noble vision of Man as the arbiter between Good and Evil’ (Henning 1951 , p. 45) is a philosophically and historically stranded conception. In Henning’s account of the religion of the G ā th ā s, we in fact have two postulates, one of monotheism, and one of the protest against it. Henning takes over the fi rst, which he rightly fi nds at odds with the dualistic belief ‘in two highest beings, the Good God, and the Evil antitheos’ (Henning 1944 , p. 291), but instead of letting it go he turns it into the background of the ‘prophet’s mission’. How should we understand the repudiation of the da ē vas in this scheme? If in fact there was a theodicy need for an accursed ‘antitheos’, why not let the da ē vas play that role, since there are clear expressions of their condemnation in the G ā th ā s? The reason seems to be that for Henning the ‘background monotheism’ of the prophet’s mission was a ‘recently’ developed condition: an emerging monotheism that is fi nally accomplished by the prophet, who at the same time ‘reacts’ to this monotheism by developing a radical dualism. 8 Henning sees in the ‘entities’ associated with Mazd ā the trace of an earl-ier polytheistic condition. Emphasizing that the move from polytheism to monotheism cannot be viewed as an evolutionary process but requires a ‘negation or a revolution’, Gnoli ( 2009 , p. 99) believes that something like Henning’s thesis would be a ‘plausible response to the problem of the rela-tion between monotheism and dualism in Zoroaster’: ‘de voir dans le dual-ism une r é action contre un monoth é isme in fi eri et dans la condemnation des daivas l’aboutissement d’un monoth é isme r é alis é par n é gation de l’ancien polyth é isme, gr â ce à l’ œ uvre d’un r é formateur religieux’. The condemnation of the da ē vas that one fi nds in the G ā th ā s would, then, have to be interpreted as a coup de gr â ce on polytheism delivered by the ‘prophet’. If so, one would expect to see in the G ā th ā s two simultaneous and only seemingly contradict-ory impulses: accomplishing the monotheistic tendency and, at the same time, exculpating the recently elevated god in the face of evil. There should be, on one side, a negation of the polytheistic gods, the da ē vas , and on the other, an affi rmation of the existence of an evil ‘antitheos’ who can be blamed for worldly misfortunes. If these two really constituted the raison d’ ê tre of the prophet’s mission, one would have to deem that he did not articulate that mis-sion in the G ā th ā s. The condemnation of the da ē vas that one fi nds throughout the G ā th ā s is for specifi c acts (e.g. Y 32.3), which presupposes their existence in some sense. As the ‘bad intuition’ ( aka- mainiiu- ), Henning’s evil antitheos has deceived the da ē vas , we are told in Y 32.5; the da ē vas in turn cheat the mortal out of ‘good life and immortality’. 9 Why place the da ē vas as mediators between mortals and the ‘deceitful intuition’ ( dr ə guuan \u0004 t- mainiiu- )? How does one account for this, that the equally powerful antitheos whose existence one"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"28 Monotheistic thesiswants to affi rm is placed for his worldly activity in a relationship of depend-ence with ‘false gods’ whose existence one wants to deny? Gershevitch feels more strongly than Henning that Zarathu š tra’s monothe-ism has to be maintained alongside his ‘ethical dualism’ as an equally import-ant ‘tenet’. In 1959, in the ‘Introduction’ to his edition of the Mihr Ya š t, he thought he could resolve the tension between the two ‘tenets’ by shunting them off to different dimensions: ‘these two tenets pertain to an ethical dualism tempered by a monotheism which is centered in Ahura Mazd ā ’ (Gershevitch 1959 , p. 9). The idea of a dualism ‘tempered’ by monotheism is so obscure that he abandons it a few pages later where he elaborates further the constitu-ents of each dimension. Here Gershevitch moves closer to Henning’s position, except that unlike the latter, who had ‘understood’ monotheism as a system overcome in ethical dualism, Gershevitch happily juxtaposes them: ‘a dual-ism on two planes, involving opposition respectively between “Truth” and “Falsehood” on the one hand, and Spənta and Aŋra Mainyu on the other; a monotheism centered in Ahura Mazd ā h, who has created, or emanated, seven supernatural aspects of himself, the Entities’ (Gershevitch 1959 , p. 12). The other ahuras are assimilated to Mazd ā as his ‘emanations’. Gershevitch thus constructs a self-styled monotheism. 10 The juxtaposition of the two seemingly heterogeneous religious views is made explicit in his article of 1964: ‘Two reli-gions, therefore, appear to have been syncretized by the prophet: a mono-theism centered in a god of whom Truth is an emanation, and a dualism in which Truth is primordial’ (Gershevitch 1964 , p. 12). 11 The embarrassing ‘evil spirit’ who is ‘opposed’ to ‘god’s creative organ’ as a ‘destructive organ or agent’ is the prophet’s solution to the problem of ‘adapting’ his monotheism to the dualism of truth and falsehood. ‘Naturally not even Zarathu š tra could amalgamate a dualism with monotheism without incurring inconsistencies. But the system he achieved displays cohesion and structural balance, and complies with the most exacting rational, ethical, and spiritual aspirations’ (Gershevitch 1959 , p. 47). One wonders what the ‘inconsistencies’ might be, given the comprehensive reassurance that follows their admission. For Gershevitch, Zarathu š tra’s monotheism means the rejection of the da ē vas as ‘false gods’. Their ‘reality’ is that of their worshippers’ belief in them. Here is how he sees this idea expressed in the G ā th ā s: [The prophet] granted them existence... only as thoughts, conceived by erroneously thinking men (“worst men” 12 ) who had taken for guideline original Evil Thought. Even erroneous thinking, by defi nition, amounts to choosing, to a rejection of what is correct. The gods, therefore, exist-ing as thoughts, had it in them to think , i.e. choose. This is why in Ys 30.6 Zoroaster can say that the gods themselves chose wrongly. Being thoughts, however wrongly conceived, they could have bethought them-selves within their human thinkers’ minds, and opted for extinction by rejecting their wrong conception. (Gershevitch 1975 , p. 80)"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Monotheistic thesis 29 Having declared that the reality of the da ē vas is that of their conception in the minds of their worshippers, Gershevitch wants them nevertheless to be able to ‘think’ themselves into some form of existence (apparently capable of refl ection) in order to ‘opt for extinction’ (their own) because of their human hosts’ ‘wrong conception’ of them – whatever this sequence might mean. The da ē vas have to be, on the one hand, mere ‘thoughts’, so that one can sensibly speak of monotheism, and, on the other, agents of sorts capable of being blamed, etc., since otherwise Gershevitch’s theorizations completely lose touch with the text. Hence the incomprehensible ‘thoughts’ that ‘bethink’ themselves in and out of existence. 13 Despite small variations in his opinion throughout the years, Gershevitch has always viewed the ‘elaboration’ of a dualism based on the opposition of truth and falsehood and its ‘adaptation’ to monotheism as Zarathu š tra’s specifi c contributions. The prophet ‘found’ the Mazdaean monotheism and ‘elaborated’ the fundamental dualism of truth and falsehood (Gershevitch 1959 , p. 47). Henning thought that Zoroaster conceived his dualism as a pro-test against monotheism. For Gershevitch it is a question of ‘adapting’ it to the monotheistic system that the prophet ‘found’. In his fi nal publication on the matter he put it somewhat differently: That Zoroaster built his doctrine on a pre-existing monotheism, has been self-evident from the moment Henning ( 1951 ), p. 46, explained why any other origin is out of the question. 14 But whereas Henning called Zoroaster’s religion a ‘protest’ against monotheism, I should prefer to call it a stunning solution of the impasse inherent in monotheism. (Gershevitch 1995 , p. 5) The ‘inherent impasse’ of monotheism is the existence of evil in the world; 15 and the ‘stunning solution’ consists in the introduction of the notion of free will and the opposition of a destructive agent to the benevolent god. Since the point is not to explain the origin of evil in the world or enhance man’s ethical stature, 16 but to exculpate the benevolent god, Gershevitch’s ‘stunning solution’ should imply the limitation of the power of the god by an equally powerful ‘evil spirit’. Zarathu š tra discovered the dualistic solution ‘en route of his heading, confi rmed monotheist as he was, for the highest of goals, that of safeguarding the perfection of God one and only from being maligned on account of the existence of evil and wrong’ (Gershevitch 1995 , p. 6). Freedom of choice in this scheme is not the ground of the ‘dignity of man’ but may at most be understood as the condition of the potency of the malevolent spirit, for it has to be explained why, despite his being the creator of man, the benevolent god cannot secure his creature’s making the ‘right choice’, i.e. to side with his creator. Gershevitch, however, wants to resist the inevitable consequence of the exculpation: the restriction of the good god’s power. In The Avestan Hymn to Mi θ ra , Gershevitch ( 1959 , p. 46) maintains that although the ‘Fiendish Spirit’ is begotten, like his good twin, by Mazd ā , his"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"30 Monotheistic thesisbecoming evil is subsequent to his ‘emanation’ and only due to ‘insubordin-ation’, which implies free will. In this way, he believes, both monotheism and moral perfection of the one god are preserved. But he must have felt he had not satisfactorily discharged the issue, since in 1964 he has his imagination contribute further to the picture. The conclusion the Fiendish Spirit, too, was an emanation of Ahura Mazd ā h’s is unavoidable. But we need not go so far as to assume that Zarathu š tra imagined the Devil as having directly issued from God. Rather, since free will, too, is a basic tenet of Zarathu š trianism, we may think of the ‘childbirth’ implied in the idea of twinship as having con-sisted in the emanation by God of undifferentiated ‘spirit’, which only at the emergence of free will split into two ‘twin’ Spirits of opposite alle-giance ... the fact that the Fiendish Spirit had chosen Falsehood would all but obliterate his original connection with God. (Gershevitch 1964 , p. 13) I take it that the ‘emergence of free will’ takes place in the ‘undifferen-tiated spirit’, although the formulation is unclear. Free will exculpates the god through inserting an ontological nullity between him and his ‘emanation’ turned evil. But the idea operates under diffi cult conditions: it is not just the moral integrity of the god that has to be protected but also his being the unique source of all there is, his absoluteness. Thus, somehow ‘free will’ has to split itself and give rise to two free wills, which go on to constitute the twin spirits. Aside from the obvious problem that none of this is found in the G ā th ā s, it is just bad philosophizing. The will is, according to its concept, uni-tary. 17 In any case, Gershevitch abandons this idea, too, and fi nds yet another role for his ‘free will’. Thought, mainyu in Gathic, is twinship, a single fertilized egg dividing, seeing that good or right for example are un think able, except against the foil of evil and wrong ... He [Zarathu š tra] can have no doubt that noth-ing would have been easier for God than to see to evil and wrong never come into existence. But had God seen to this, his name would not have been Mazd ā and Man would have been unthinking as are hens, turnips or stones. Hence only dualism , so the perceptive discoverer of it informs us in Yasna 30.3, can avail to render monotheism truly impregnable to maligners: there can be no Sp ə nta Mainyu, except against the foil of A ŋ ra Mainyu. (Gershevitch 1995 , p. 6) It is dualism as such that is needful in the mind of Gershevitch’s Zarathu š tra and not the free will per se: without oppositional concepts man would be like hen or turnip, whereas God wanted him to be a thinking creature. 18 It is unclear why Gershevitch believes without binary moral concepts man would"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Monotheistic thesis 31be reduced to a turnip, or, less dramatically, why these concepts defi ne man’s thinking as such. In any case, the ‘stunning solution’ would work only if one could show that the existence of what is bad is necessary for moral-conceptual clarity, e.g. that the concept of evil necessitates the existence of evil, which is, of course, not possible. Moral exculpation of the one god inevitably leads to the restriction of his power and, if effected dualistically, to the negation of his uniqueness. The existence of evil can become an accusation against a creator god only in the frame of a moralistic monotheism. Historically, this happened in the context of Gnosticism. Now, we fi nd no trace of this situation in the G ā th ā s; there is no inkling here that the supreme god might be suspected of complicity with evil. Not every form of opposition (e.g. ‘dualism’) is oriented to restoring the moral integrity of the one god. Gnoli continues to put the relation of dualism and monotheism in the perspective of a monotheistic system in need of theodicy. In his 1980 book Zoroaster’s Time and Homeland , he sees in the G ā th ā s a conception of dualism that is closely connected with the monotheistic faith, not in the sense, as it has been said, that this dualism is a protest against monotheism but in the sense that it is a natural consequence of it, owing to the necessity of explaining the evil that is in the world. In every monotheism there is the germ of a dualism that it is hard to confi ne within merely moral bounds. (Gnoli 1980 , p. 182) The existence of evil in the world can be reconciled with monotheism only by way of dualism. It is not clear what Gnoli means here by ‘moral bounds’: that ‘ethical dualism’ ineluctably ends up in ‘theological dualism’? In any case, Gnoli understands G ā thic ‘dualism’ to be grounded in the justifi cation of the monotheistic god in the face of worldly evil. Thirty years later, he restates the ‘moral’ motivation of justifying the unique god: Le refus net et conscient de toutes les divinit é s du polyth é isme par une personnalit é qui enseignait un dualisme é thique radical pr é supposait vraisemblablement la n é gation de toutes les divinit é s, en tant que fausses divinit é s, et é tait dirig é contre une religion qui é tait v é ritablement et pure-ment polyth é iste et peut ê tre aussi à l’encontre d’autres monol â tries de type diff é rent, soit que c’ é tait implicite à la religion nouvelle, qui, cara-ct é ris é e par un monoth é isme total, voulait ainsi donner une r é ponse au probl è me de l’origine du mal. (Gnoli 2009 , p. 100) Does the monotheism that starts with a total negation of polytheism save its basic character once it is forced to accommodate an anti-god? One has to agree with Kellens ( 2006 , p. 110) when he describes Henning’s ‘dualism’ as ‘une religion à part enti è re’. The dualistic solution to the problem of evil"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"32 Monotheistic thesisgenerally leads to the dissolution of the monotheism it was supposed to immunize. No sooner is the one true god proclaimed against ‘the polythe-ism of the traditional religion’ (Pettazzoni 1954 , p. 7) than he (Pettazzoni: ‘Principle of Good’) fi nds himself in mortal strife with an equally power-ful anti-god (‘Principle of Evil’). If the rejection of the ‘traditional gods’ as false in favour of the one true god is the mark of monotheism, 19 admitting a fundamentally independent adversary, whatever one cares to call it, is its abrogation, unless one is happy to manipulate defi nitions to make them fi t one’s purposes. In his 2009 article, Gnoli more or less takes the same pos-ition on dualism as he earlier had in Zoroaster’s Time and Homeland ( 1980 , pp. 183–85) in his discussion of Pettazzoni’s view. ‘En effet, le dualisme ne serait ainsi pas la n é gation du monoth é isme, mais le monoth é isme lui-m ê me, sous ses deux aspects oppos é s et contraires. Il ne serait pas non plus ant é rieur au monoth é isme, mais en serait plut ô t le refl et’. It is not dualism in general that is at issue here but a dualism that is meant as a solution to the problem of evil in the world. This is the raison d’ ê tre of ‘ethical dualism’ according to Henning, Gershevitch and Gnoli himself. ‘The answer which Zoroaster gave to this eternal problem... resides in the clearly dualistic conception of his monotheism’ (Gnoli 1980 , p. 184). But the dualistically exculpated god is no longer monotheistic because he loses his exclusive disposition over the world. Goethe’s ‘extraordinary saying’ applies here too: ‘nemo contra deum nisi deus ipse’. 20 In Gnoli’s opinion, the distinction between, on the one hand, the (supposed) G ā thic ‘opposition of the two principles of A š a and Drug, between which the two Mainyus who come from Ahura Mazd ā make their choice’, 21 and, on the other, ‘the simple opposition between Ahura Mazd ā and Angra Mainyu’ (Gnoli 1980 , p. 210) forestalls the charge of incompati-bility of monotheism and dualism. I will presently argue that the distinction between an ‘ethical’ dualism and a ‘metaphysical’ one is meaningless in the frame of the problem of evil where dualism is supposed to do its service. The epithet ‘ethical’ in Gnoli’s scheme is in reality meant to protect the imperilled ‘total monotheism’. 22 Gnoli places the prophet’s activities in a post-polytheistic condition where religious life is mainly defi ned by ‘monolatry centered on the fi gure of Ahura Mazd ā ’. Zoroaster would introduce an ‘authentic monotheism’ character-ized by a ‘radical ethical dualism’, and to this phase also belongs ‘the con-demnation of the da ē vas as gods and that, too, of the ancient polytheism’ (Gnoli 2009 , p. 102). 23 The notion of ‘ethical dualism’, for Gnoli as well as Gershevitch, is supposed to convey the idea of a dualism based on a ‘free choice’ between good and evil or truth and falsehood, fi rst exercised by the two primordial spirits, as opposed to the ‘metaphysical or ontological dual-ism’, where good and evil spirits pre-exist their choice. 24 The problems with this construction are as follows. First, the proponents of this distinction are yet to give us an acceptable account of its existence in the G ā th ā s. Here is Gnoli’s version:"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Monotheistic thesis 33 I am convinced, as Gershevitch ( 1964 , 13) amongst others maintains, that the basis of the reality of the two Spirits is their ‘choice’, and this is a widely accepted interpretation... If it is true that the two Spirits exist in consequence of their choice, which, as Gershevitch ( loc. cit .) rightly says, ‘is the prototype of the choice which faces each man as he decides between following the path of Truth or that of Falsehood’, it is just as true that their natures derive from the choice that they have made and not vice versa. (Gnoli 1980 , p. 213) The task of argument is discharged by the appeal to an authority and to the wide acceptance of the idea. But these do not make the idea of a ‘choice’ being the ‘ basis of the reality ’ of the agent, the idea of the agent’s ‘ existing in consequence ’ of its ‘choice’, any less incomprehensible. The words ‘reality’ and ‘existence’ have to be given completely new meanings for these statements to have any sense. If, further, the ‘nature’ of each ‘Spirit’ is formed as a result of its choice, what possible motive can one think for each to make its self-constitutive choice? But even this way of putting the matter is artifi cial. The right choice (of Truth) and the wrong choice (of Falsehood) are not symmetrical, since the latter is always an imputation, and hence subject to dispute and justifi cation. Why did ‘the prototype’ of the evil man choose ‘Evil’ or the ‘path of Falsehood’? 25 If not completely arbitrary and not externally compelled, this choice must be grounded either in the will to evil, i.e. in an evil nature, or, alternatively, in the failure to make the good the principle of one’s choice, i.e. in a defective nature. In either case, the idea that the choice grounds the ‘nature’ is simply wrong. An aboriginal choice that produces a good or bad nature is unintelligible. 26 Second, the advocates of ‘ethical dualism’ have an unexamined view of terms like ‘ethical’, ‘truth’, ‘falsehood’, and so on. Humans are beings with free will who have to make a choice between truth and falsehood, or good and evil. 27 The simplicity of this picture is specious: one never chooses between good and evil. As I have already mentioned, the non-diabolical ego always chooses ‘good’ and never ‘evil’. It is the content of the choice that allows a meaningful determination of its goodness or wickedness by an observer. Ethical qualifi cation pertains only to a concrete maxim. Aside from this prob-lem, there is the diffi culty that seems to be general in the fi eld: the adjective ‘ethical’ (e.g. Gnoli 1980 , p. 204) is used simply as a positively marked term, vaguely evoking modern humanistic sensibilities. Third, in the G ā th ā s the reason for the imputation of the wrong choice to the da ē vas is clear: they lead men away from the good life and immortality (Y 32.5), having been confused or deceived themselves (Y 30.6). The perspective is that of the mortals; the interest expressed therein is that of the mortals. The ‘benevolent’ gods commit themselves to the ‘better (thought, word, action)’, the ‘malevolent’ deities decide for the ‘bad (ones)’ (Y 30.3). 28 Presumably, the former promote a pleasant earthly life and afterlife for mortals, while the latter"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"34 Monotheistic thesiscause ‘ruination’ (Y 30.4). How is this picture related to the philosophically questionable conception of a free choice between good and evil grounding the reality of the two spirits? 29 Since ‘the condemnation of the da ē va is the work of Zoroaster’ (Gnoli 1985 , p. 56), Iranian religion(s) that preceded him had to be polytheistic (Gnoli 1985 , p. 57), ‘comparable’ to Vedism. And we have the testimony of the Young Avestan texts for the post-Zarathu š tra polytheism. Against this background, the impression that the G ā th ā s give is indeed one of mythological auster-ity. For the mind thus impressed it is but an easy step from the focus on the supreme god in the G ā th ā s to the idea that these poems represent a ‘mono-theistic’ religion ‘comparable’ to that of Hebrew prophets. 30 The da ē vas have to be repudiated as ‘false gods’, since, after all, Zoroaster is a monotheistic prophet. Contrary facts can always be accommodated one way or another; and the formidable diffi culties that the G ā th ā s present to the work of compre-hension are an alibi for tendentious interpretations. 31 The so-called dialect-ical scheme (‘commun é ment admise’ 32 ) has, among other defects, this one in particular, that one does not know what exactly the elusive ‘G ā thic’ moment is supposed to represent other than the ill-considered monotheism that the scholar provides himself. Interpretive and conceptual problems that the the-sis produces are sidestepped in favour of pseudo-historical questions: ‘how is polytheism in general overcome?’ One appeals to Pettazzoni’s thesis that only a historical prophet through a religious revolution can bring polythe-ism to end. And how did the supposed G ā thic monotheism (the ‘unsuccessful monotheism’) give way so pathetically to a resurgent polytheism despite its being armoured by ‘ethical dualism’? All manners of paradox can enliven the ‘historical’ account: les dieux surv é curent à la r é volution monoth é iste de Zarathoustra et cela, paradoxalement, de deux mani è res diff é rentes et con-trast é es: ou bien devenant des d é mons, comme Indra... et donc en s’ajoutant au pand é monium mazd é en, ou bien en devenant des Yazata, c’est- à -dire des ê tres inf é rieurs à Ahura Mazd ā , mais toujours dignes de culte’ (Gnoli 1980 , p. 205). ‘Paradoxically’ means: whether or not one can explain why some gods were demonized and others were not, such is the testimony of history; after all the yazatas are honoured in Zoroastrianism while the da ē vas are reviled. 33 The brief moment of monotheism – in which the ‘ancient gods of polytheism’ are ‘denied’ as such, that is to say, rejected as ‘illusions ou chim è res qui é tai-ent seulement le fruit de l’ignorance et des mauvais choix de l’homme’ (Gnoli 1985 , p. 58) – can withdraw behind the stage where the historical drama unfolds into the inscrutability of a defi nition. Monotheism is monotheism, and already contains all the ‘natural consequences’ of its defi nition. ‘La con-damnation des da ē va est la cons é quence naturelle de l’affi rmation d’une id é e monoth é iste, parce que les da ē va ne sont autres que les “dieux”, c’est- à -dire les divinit é s d’un panth é on d’une ou plusieurs religions polyth é istes’ (Gnoli 1985 , pp. 56–57). The G ā th ā s cannot tell us anything about the repudiation of the polytheist gods that we do not already know from ‘monotheism’, which by defi nition makes them ‘Hirngespinste’. 34"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Monotheistic thesis 35 Gnoli’s picture of the G ā thic treatment of the ancient gods comes in its essential features from Herman Lommel’s work Die Religion Zarathustras ( 1930 ). Lommel sees in the G ā th ā s a monotheistic religion advocated by a his-torical prophet who turned against ancient Iranian gods. ‘Da ß Ahura Mazda Gott ist, und zwar der Gott und nicht einer von vielen, ist der Kernpunkt’ (Lommel 1930 , p. 11). But the essence of this monotheism, here too, remains elusive. That Ahura Mazd ā is a creator ‘most clearly stands out’ in the G ā th ā s, but he ‘has not created everything’. ‘Auch ist Ahura Mazda des Richter beim Weltgericht am Ende der Zeiten. Aber nicht er allein, und wie beim Gericht, so wirken auch bei der Sch ö pfung seine hohen Geister mit’ (Lommel 1930 , p. 12). The signifi cance of Zarathu š tra’s ‘rejection’ of the da ē vas is no less diffi cult to determine. The word is etymologically related to the Vedic deva- ‘god’, Latin deus , etc., but in the Young Avestan texts it clearly means ‘Teufel’ (Lommel 1930 , p. 90). The word undergoes a reversal of value in Iran, accord-ing to Lommel. There must have been an in-between stage where the word no longer meant ‘god’ but had not yet assumed its eventual meaning ‘demon’. At this transitional stage it must have meant ‘G ö tze’. ‘Und so ist es in der Tat’ (Lommel 1930 , p. 90). Lommel believes that this usage is attested in the G ā th ā s (e.g. Y 32.3). ‘Die Verehrung der Daivas aber ist der alte G ö tterkult, der dem Zarathustra als G ö tzenverehrung und Teufeldienst sich darstellte’ (Lommel 1930 , p. 91). But more frequently the word is used to denote demonic, anti-divine beings: ‘Es its verwendet wie ein feststehender, anerkannter und eingeb ü rgerter Ausdruck f ü r das Schlimme, Verabscheuungsw ü rdige, und der Prophet gebraucht das Wort, das seinem Volk bisher das h ö chste Heilige ausdr ü ckte, so, als ob die von ihm daran vorgenommene v ö llige Umwertung schon allgemein vollzogen und in aller Herz und Sinne eingepr ä gt w ä re’ (Lommel 1930 , p. 91). Zarathu š tra is thus responsible for the revaluation of the word from ‘god’ to ‘demon’. It is not easy to understand, however, how the gods denied, that is, turned into G ö tzen, can subsequently develop into Teufel. Moreover, each of these two notions as the equivalent concept of the G ā thic da ē va presents its own problems. The circumspection that Lommel shows in articulating the nature of the treatment of the da ē vas in the G ā th ā s displays his diffi culty to come to grips with the issue. ‘Die Existenz der alten G ö tter hat Zarathustra nicht geleugnet, aber er hat sie f ü r schlecht erkl ä rt, und zwar offenbar besonders weil ihr Kult ihm als Verirrung und Greuel erschien’ (Lommel 1930 , p. 93). Here, it seems, Lommel thinks that Zarathu š tra does not deny the existence of these supernatural beings after all, that he does not reduce them to mere G ö tzen, but declares them noxious, etc.; and if this involves a denial of their divinity, it is because these supernatural beings are ‘bad’. The fact that Lommel is willing to use the term ‘Teufel’ for such beings has more to do with the natural disposition of the proponents of the mono-theistic thesis to assimilate the Iranian ‘prophet’ to the Hebrew stereotype than with what can be learned from the G ā th ā s. Just as the denial of polythe-istic gods is a ‘natural’ consequence of monotheism, so too is the assimila-tion of the abhorred supernatural beings to the Devil. Received conceptions"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"36 Monotheistic thesisunderlying automatic understanding leave no room for genuine engagement with the text as a discourse. Casting the da ē vas as ‘Teufel’ already tells one why they are condemned, which is the reason why Lommel feels no need to analyse the two crucial passages (e.g. Y 30.6 and 32.5) in this respect. I have argued that in keeping with the intention of the monotheistic inter-pretation of the G ā th ā s the only signifi cance one can give to ‘ethical dualism’ is that it is motivated by the concern to vindicate the goodness of the one true god in the face of worldly evil, as ‘une r é ponse au probl è me de l’origine du mal’ (Gnoli 2009 , p. 100). As for what this goodness consists in – this question should be put to Gershevitch and others who generally share his views. The ‘condemnation of the da ē vas qua divinities’ belongs, according to Gnoli, with this ‘authentic monotheism characterized by a radical ethical dualism’. Whether one can in fact describe the treatment of the da ē vas in the G ā th ā s as a denunciation of Hirngespinste is of no real consequence for the adherents of the monotheistic thesis, for the denunciation is deducible from the defi nition of monotheism. One way or another, they conjure away the embarrassing problem of a monotheistic religion attributing serious power of mischief to ‘false gods’. I think it is also clear that, from before Bartholomae to Duchesne-Guillemin 35 and Gnoli, the thesis of G ā thic monotheism con-stantly invokes the analogy of the Biblical prophetic tradition. This thesis is present in the works of its champions either as an assumption (‘admit-ted by all’) or as a polemical cause that the advocate feels he should defend against the detractors. It is never examined in reference to G ā thic texts with-out prejudice. Generally speaking, Narten’s description is apt: ‘Bemerkenswert ist, da ß die Gathas einerseits deutlich die Einzigartkeit Ahura Mazd ā s erkennen lassen, worin man eine monotheistische Tendenz sehen k ö nnte, da ß andererseits aber eben doch auch weitere g ö ttliche Wesen neben Ahura Mazd ā genannt wer-den, also der Polytheismus nicht grunds ä tzlich abgelehnt wird’ (Narten 1996 , p. 72). Beyond this sound scepticism one can also question what knowledge is gained by insisting that the G ā th ā s are ‘monotheistic’ when one does not even know in what exact sense this term is being used. Should one start with inquiring into the unquestionable existence of ‘other divine beings’ beside the supreme god, or with the question whether the ‘unique’ status of the supreme god could be understood as that of the exclusive recipient of sacrifi ce? Narten ( 1996 , p. 72) suggests that perhaps the ‘other divine beings’ owe their existence to the pressure of the Indo-Iranian polytheist sacrifi cial tradition. This ‘rit-ual’ (‘auf ritueller Ebene’) explanation still leaves the question of the sense of the ‘uniqueness’ (‘Einzigartigkeit’) of the supreme god open. 36 By contrast, in Le panth é on , Kellens ( 1994 , pp. 118–22) thinks that the uniqueness of Ahura Mazd ā asserted in the G ā th ā s is specifi cally sacrifi cial: these ‘liturgical com-positions’ extend to the ritual sphere the inherited cosmogonic and eschato-logical pre-eminence of the god. I will discuss these issues in due course: whatever criticism one may have of Kellens’ views, they are articulate and hence amenable to analysis, in contrast with the monotheistic interpretation"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Monotheistic thesis 37of the G ā th ā s. The monotheistic thesis undermines all serious study of the status of the da ē vas in the G ā th ā s, since everyone knows what monotheism is: there is only one true god; all other pretenders are false. If the scholar feels he or she has to say something or other on the issue for whatever reason, it is just to assert ex cathedra that the ‘polytheistic gods’ are mere Hirngespinste, appearances to the contrary notwithstanding. Notes 1 The Semitic analogy gradually replaced in the Western reception of Zoroaster the hostile contrast drawn by the Christian writers of the early modern period. According to Herrenschmidt ( 1987 ), the decisive date in the history of the reception is the pub-lication of De Religione Persarum in 1700: ‘Once and for all Europeans had the same vision of Zoroaster as they did of the prophets of Israel... Zoroaster the Prophet is Zoroaster the writer. The view still remains with us’ (Herrenschmidt 1987 , p. 214). By ‘writer’ she means ‘thinker’. One way or another, the Semitic shadow has been a constant of the monotheistic view of Zarathu š tra and Zoroastrianism. The idea of ‘Zoroaster’s imposture’ was the eighteenth century’s way of reconciling the mono-theistic interpretation of Zoroastrianism and the belief in the exclusive authenticity of Judeo-Christian monotheism (Herrenschmidt 1987 , pp. 217–19). 2 Compare Nietzsche 2005 , p. 181: ‘The notion of will was essentially designed with punishment in mind, which is to say the desire to assign guilt ’. 3 See Blumenberg 1983 , pp. 125–36. 4 Plato’s statement may be traced in some respects to the moralistic criticisms of Homer’s gods by a number of Pre-Socratics, e.g. Xenophanes of Colophon. ‘For the fi rst time, speaking about the divine is dominated by postulates of what is fi tting’ (Burkert 1987 , p. 308). 5 In the extreme it will lead to the elimination of God, better dead than tainted, ‘athe-ism ad maiorem Dei gloriam ’. See Marquard 1989 , pp. 38–63. 6 See, for example, Jonas 1958 : for a summary, pp. 42–47; for Marcionite version, pp. 130–46; for Manichaeism, pp. 206–37. 7 Dualism is philosophically more robust. The free will argument only constantly shifts the problem and creates a tangled mess. Compare Blumenberg 1983 , pp. 127–36. ‘Marcion wanted a god who did not need to contradict himself by creating man in such a way that he would have to deliver him from his lost state... by producing a world that, in spite of his omnipotence, in the end allows the announced design of salvation to accrue only to a few men. Marcion wanted to place his foreign God, free of the burden of responsibility for the world, entirely and without restriction on the side of man’s salvation’ (Blumenberg 1983 , p. 130). Augustine’s solution is meant to be an ‘overcoming’ of the Gnostic charge against the monotheistic God of creatio ex nihilo , which means it also has to answer the question of ‘the ori-gin of what is bad in the world’ (Blumenberg 1983 , p. 132). The background of Augustine’s solution is Gnosticism, without which it would not be understood. One may put it like this: dualism addresses the existence of evil; the Augustinian doc-trine of free will addresses the dualistic (Gnostic) solution on behalf of the creator God. ‘With a gesture just as stirring as it was fateful, (Augustine) took for man and upon man the responsibility for the burden oppressing the world. Now, in the aftermath of Gnosticism, the problem of the justifi cation of God has become over-whelming, and that justifi cation of God has become overwhelming, and that justi-fi cation is accomplished at the expense of man, to whom a new concept of freedom is ascribed expressly in order to let the whole of an enormous responsibility and guilt be imputed to it’ (Blumenberg 1983 , p. 133). To some extent, Augustine takes"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"38 Monotheistic thesisover the language of ancient philosophy, which makes no distinction between moral wickedness and natural misfortune. Nothing better than the idea of an inherited original sin shows that in Augustine the doctrine of free will is not meant to assert man’s ‘moral dignity’ but to affi rm God’s inculpability for worldly evil. 8 Henning 1944 , p. 292: ‘The Ethical Dualism of Zoroaster is most easily understood as the reaction against a monotheism which, it seems, had sprung up in his country on the basis of the original Iranian polytheism. Primitive Polytheisms commonly tend to develop into monotheisms, by stressing a single personality of the pan-theon while the other deities fall into insignifi cance and become subordinated to the One God as his angels or archangels. It seems likely that such a stage in the religious development had already been reached before Zoroaster’. This ‘process’ of elevation of one god of the pantheon to the status of the sole god is prob-lematic. No commonly acknowledged monotheistic religion can be understood to have emerged through this process. Nor is a pantheon a Masonic Lodge where every member stands on the same level. The supremacy of one god in a pantheon may well be a structural feature, not a sign of a ‘development’ to monotheism. It is true that in ancient Greece local cults always attached themselves to one par-ticular deity, but this phenomenon can in no way be viewed as a tendency toward monotheism. See Versnel 2011 , pp. 23–149. In Vedic India, the rise of Indra did not produce any monotheistic pressures. Yahwism was a monolatry with a polit-ical intent, like other monolatries of the Levant in the fi rst millennium BCE , and the emergence of Hebrew ‘monotheism’ (e.g. in so-called Deutero-Isaiah) should probably be understood against the background of the political situation of the Exile. Compare Assmann 1997 , pp. 23–54, 2006 , pp. 77–80. The political element, i.e. the formation of the Islamic state in Medina, played a fundamental role in Islamic theology. 9 I cannot accept Panaino’s presentation of the issue in Panaino 2004 . The condem-nation of the da ē vas ‘est le corollaire logique à une id é e typiquement zara θ u š trienne’ (Panaino 2004 , p. 114). These ‘ancient gods of Indo-Iranian polytheism’ (115) are defi ned by ‘absolute negativity’ (Panaino 2004 , p. 136). Their ‘non-existence’ in the ‘vital dimension’, however, does not mean they are not present in the ‘mental domain’. ‘Certes, les Da ē uua ne sont pas é limin é s, mais leur pr é sence se cantonne au niveau mental... Les liens entre An \u0004 gra Mainiiu et les Da ē uua avec le concept de negation de la vie... conf è rent aux forces du mal une dimension extra-mondaine, sorte d’hallucination de la pens é e’ (Panaino 2004 , p. 117). Does not the ‘negation of life’ imply the power of its agents to infl uence the world, their worldly existence, then, be it ‘parasitical’, be it by way of ‘pseudo-cr é ation’ or ‘cr é ations inf é rieures’ (136)? Does the ‘Mainiiu B é n é fi que’ address a ‘hallucination’ in Y 45.2 (see his own translation in Panaino 2004 , pp. 129–30)? Are the da ē vas of Y 30.6 (his trans-lation in Panaino 2004 , p. 120) ‘chim è res’? If the da ē vas exist only in the ‘mental domain’ (is it any different for Mazd ā and other gods in the G ā th ā s?) – does this make them less ‘real’, Gershevitch’s Hirngespinste ? 10 The reduction of the G ā thic ‘entities’ to ‘aspects’ of the one true god, or the hypos-tases of his activities, is Gershevitch’s way of dealing with these divine beings. This view of the ‘entities’ is not just found in Gershevitch. Maria Wilkins Smith, Duchesne-Guillemin and Martin Schwartz (the latter two with some variations) share the view. Schwartz maintains that Ahura Mazd ā forms a ‘divine triad’ with A š a and Vohu Manah, and sometimes calls the triad ‘the three aspects of the Divinity’ (Schwartz 1998 , p. 167). Kellens ( 2000 , p. 52) justifi ably comments: ‘This interpretation is an example... of the incurable tendency of Western scholar-ship to make its own Mazdean theology’. Parpola ( 2002 , pp. 89–91) uses this idea to relate the G ā th ā s to the ‘ecstatic cult’ of the Mesopotamian A šš ur, ‘a mono-theistic God’ whose cult was ‘associated with mysticism’. Zarathu š tra becomes one of ‘the Median princes who were brought up by the Assyrians to train them"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Monotheistic thesis 39for state service as high offi cials and to brainwash them to loyalty to Assyria’. An important plank of the programme would have been the inculcation of ‘the esoteric monotheistic religion of the Assyrians’, which the brainwashed prince-cum-prophet duly conveyed in his G ā th ā s. See also Parpola 2004 – 2005 , p. 18. I cannot discuss these idiosyncratic views in detail, such as the notion that A šš ur was a monotheistic god. See, for instance, Van Seters 1997 and Assmann 2006 , pp. 65–80. Mysticism depends on canon (i.e. sacred writing) and interpretation, both absent from Mesopotamian religious thought. One should note, in any event, the strange places to which the meditations of an enthusiast of G ā thic monothe-ism may lead. 11 Gershevitch’s defi nition of monotheism as ‘worshipping only one god’ (Gershevitch 1964 , p. 12), to which he himself does not adhere, is unusual; or one should say it is unusual if it means just what it says rather than the belief in the uniqueness of the godhead. But when he writes ‘Zoroaster’s sole god, Mazd ā ’, for example, he does not mean the one god Zoroaster worships but the one god there is to worship: ‘when Zoroaster inveighs against the gods... he inveighs not against demons but against polytheism ’ (Gershevitch 1975 , p. 80). 12 This supposed G ā thic expression owes its existence to Gershevitch’s interpretation of Y 32.4a–b. See my discussion of the passage in the second part. 13 In view of the reception of Gershevitch’s conception of the da ē vas in the G ā th ā s, one should think that these sentences would have attracted some critical scru-tiny from scholars, in particular from the adherents of the monotheistic thesis. Gershevitch is convinced in the manner of a dogmatic believer that G ā thic religion is monotheistic, hence the da ē vas have to be false gods. But then what to do with the passages that seem to grant them agency? Gershevitch’s translations of G ā thic texts are tendentious (Gershevitch 1986 , pp. 88–92), sometimes beyond plausibil-ity. Since the religion of Mazd ā is monotheistic, Y 31.4a2′ mazd å sc ā ahur åŋ h ō has to be understood as ‘hendiadyadic Mazd ā h-and-Thy-Lords’ (Gershevitch 1986 , p. 91). Since Zarathu š tra is a ‘prophet’, and a ‘prophet’ spreads the gospel of the one true god and, apart from his livelihood, is only after spiritual fulfi lment, Y 46.19c–d′ ahm ā i m ī ž d ə m hanant ē ... man ə\u0002 .vist ā i š mat ̃ visp ā i š g ā uu ā az ī must say ‘who-am(meanwhile, by spreading Thy gospel,)-wage-earning two pregnant cows, in addition to every-conceivable spiritual-acquisition’ (Gershevitch 1986 , p. 89). 14 I have quoted the text of Henning Gershevitch refers to here in my discussion of Henning. Obviously, the reference to Henning’s supposedly authoritative explan-ation (‘why any other origins is out of question’, etc.) is Gershevitch’s way of unburdening himself of the task that no one seems to want to take up: demon-strating the reality of G ā thic monotheism, background or foreground. 15 Compare Panaino 2004 , p. 114: ‘le probl è me principal [de le monoth é isme] se trouve dans la n é cessit é d’expliquer l’origine du mal’. 16 Contra Gnoli 1980 , p. 182: ‘He (i.e., Zarathu š tra) gives the utmost signifi cance to man’s moral choice and hence to his dignity and freedom’. 17 ‘“Willing, if it is not to be a sort of wishing, must be the action itself. It cannot be allowed to stop anywhere short of the action.” If it is the action, then it is so in the ordinary sense of the word; so it is speaking, writing, walking, lifting a thing, imagining something’ (Wittgenstein 2001 , §615). 18 Thus Gershevitch reads Zarathu š tra’s mind reading Mazd ā ’s mind, since none of this is found anywhere in the texts. It is unclear what Gershevitch means by ‘good’, ‘evil’, etc., or even whether he means the concept of good, etc. That ‘good is unthinkable without the foil of evil’ seems to suggest that he has, at least here, their concepts in mind. Whatever one thinks of this statement, that the concept of good implies the concept of evil hardly justifi es God in the face of the exist-ence of misfortune and wickedness, which was at issue. Gershevitch also seems to think that the statement that closes our citation is the equivalent of the one we just"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"40 Monotheistic thesisconsidered. That ‘there can be no Sp ə n \u0004 ta Mainyu, except against the foil of A ŋ ra Mainyu’ is simply wrong. Just because a concept may imply its opposite does not mean that the thing that is known through the fi rst necessitates the existence of the thing that is known through the second. Descartes ( 1985 , pp. 93–120) thought that the concept of the ‘supremely perfect being’, i.e. ‘God’, implies its necessary existence, as one of the attributes that belongs to the perfect being (the version in Axiom 10, Second Replies). Kant showed that existence is not a predicate, e.g. which may be implied in the concept of a thing (Kant 1996 , pp. 582–86). 19 Compare Assmann 2003 . 20 See Blumenberg 1983 , pp. 523–56. 21 See also Eliade 1978 , p. 310: ‘Ahura Mazd ā is the father of... Spenta Mainyu. But this implies that he also engendered the other twin Angra Mainyu’. Aside from other problems with this inference, it is not even clear that the ‘most vitalizing spirit’ ( mainiiu- sp ə\b ni š ta- ) of Y 30.3–5 is not Mazd ā . 22 The ‘ethical loftiness’ (Gnoli 1980 , p. 191) of the idea of free choice, whatever one may think of this historically stranded idea, has nothing to do with the problem of evil that a ‘total monotheism’ has to face, save the function, theoretically possible, of giving foothold to the anti-god in the good god’s creation, as mentioned in the discussion of Henning. But one has to be careful. The whole language of ‘free choice’ as intended by interpreters like Gershevitch and Gnoli is misleading. The belief that there is a lofty ethical motivation (i.e. of affi rming man’s moral dignity) behind the G ā thic ‘choice’ is a construction of the scholar with no basis in the G ā th ā s (see my discussion of Y 30.3 in the second part). 23 See also Gnoli 1980 , esp. pp. 130–36, 1985 , pp. 48–50, 1996 , pp. 576–81. Gnoli’s position is the best proof that the monotheistic thesis is a Biblical conception: a prophet advocating morality in the face of empty ritual, centred on the rejection of false gods in favour of the one true god – with all the attendant drama. I do not think that this picture of the Hebrew religion, or of Abrahamic religions more generally, is that of the experts of the fi eld, but it seems to be the stereotype that Gnoli has in mind: ‘Je suis convaincu que, si nous ne comprenons pas la force et la nouveaut é de ce personnage historique, noun nous coupons de la possibilit é de p é n é trer dans l’esprit du mazd é isme... Et cela est en harmonie avec le fait que le message de Zoroastre est essentiellement caract é ris é par son monoth é isme et son dualisme – l’un intimement en rapport avec l’autre – car j’estime que l’on doit partager la th è se de R. Pettazzoni, selon laquelle le monoth é isme d é rive toujo-urs d’une r é volution religieuse dans un sens antipolyth é iste... r é volution qui n’est pas concevable sans l’action de puissants personnages historiques’ (Gnoli 1985 , pp. 48–49). Everything fi ts together as in a jigsaw puzzle. Can there be any question that a monotheistic prophet could have any view of the gods other than as false idols? Whatever the data of the reference text, the answer is given in advance. 24 See Gnoli 1996 , pp. 576–77 and Gershevitch 1964 , pp. 13–16. 25 See below for a discussion of the spurious idea of the choice of an immortal entity as the prototype of human choice. 26 Where does one fi nd, whether in philosophy, mythology, or common sense, such a strange notion? For Eliade, both ‘Good and Evil, the holy one and the destroying demon, proceed from Ahura Mazd ā ’, a typical theology based in the ‘mythico-rit-ual systems of bipartitions and polarities’, ‘systems that accounted for the cosmic rhythms and the negative aspects of reality and, fi rst and foremost, for the exist-ence of evil’ (Eliade 1978 , pp. 310–11). That evil too has proceeded from God does not create any moral responsibility for Him, according to Eliade, ‘since Angra Mainyu freely chose his mode of being and his malefi cent vocation’. But Eliade immediately dismantles the nexus he has created to accommodate what he takes to be the data of G ā thic theology: ‘On the other hand, Ahura Mazd ā , in his omnisci-ence, knew from the beginning what choice the Destroying Spirit would make and"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Monotheistic thesis 41nevertheless did not prevent it; this may mean either that God transcends all kinds of contradictions or that the existence of evil constitutes the preliminary condition for human freedom’ (Eliade 1978 , p. 310). The existence of evil is either a matter of indifference to the god, who is beyond good and evil, or necessary for human freedom, so deemed presumably by the god. What, then, is the purpose of the story of a primordial being ‘choosing evil’? What is the point of positing a dubious idea, or at least – one must admit this much – an idea that is so obscure? 27 Schmidt ( 1975 , p. 5), too, thinks that the ‘doctrine of free will’ is ‘one of Zarathustra’s most revolutionary ideas’. 28 Detailed treatment of these texts is found in the second part. 29 The misconception is a constant in Gnoli’s work. ‘[L]a nature de ce dualisme, qui oppose à l’Esprit Bienfaisant (Sp ə nta Mainyu) l’Esprit Mauvais (Angra Mainyu), est essentiellement morale, en ce qu’elle se fonde sur la conception du choix. Le dualisme g â thique est le fruit d’une pens é e philosophique et é thique; le sens de la r é volution religieuse de Zoroastre se trouve en cela: c’est une r é volt contre une religion formaliste et ritualiste en faveur d’une religiosit é int é rieure et du droit de l’individu à se soustraire aux r è gles de la tradition et à son imp é ratif ’ (Gnoli 1985 , p. 50). These words are surprising from the pen of a historian. The ‘sense’ of the Zoroastrian ‘revolution’ is the rejection of traditional ritualism and legalism in favour of an individualistic ethics of choice and spirituality. It is hard to determine whether this term-for-term opposition of the new religion to what Gnoli takes to be the nature of ‘traditional’ religiosity is an analytic expansion of the notion of ‘revolution’ as such, or whether he thinks that the ideas of ‘interior religiosity and right of the individual to opt out of traditional norms’ are aspects of the supposed G ā thic doctrine of free choice. As a general proposition, the latter is of course a chimera, since the consequences of the dualistic choice totally overwhelm the eth-ical freedom supposed in the individual, who, in heeding the new conception of individual freedom, would also pay close attention to the admonitions regarding the dire outcome of making the wrong choice. The historian feels he has to give some recognizable feature (i.e. anti-ritualist, etc.) to his ‘ethical’ religion even if it fl ies in the face of historical sense. 30 See, for example, Gnoli 1985 , pp. 50–51. The advocates of the monotheistic thesis never tire of comparing their Zoroaster with the Biblical prophet. 31 See Henning 1951 , p. 14: ‘Inevitably, there is a large number of words in the Avesta whose meanings are unknown, and a further large number whose meanings are imperfectly known; and such unknown or imperfectly known words are particu-larly numerous in the G â th â s. Then there are the words whose meaning is not in doubt; but even they, as all words, have a certain range of meaning, and from that range one can select an eccentric meaning. Now if one attributes an entirely arbitrary set of meanings to the unknown words, in such a way that this set of meanings is consistent within itself and conforms to a preconceived notion of the contents of the G â th â s, and if one proceeds to select suitable extreme meanings for the known words, one can translate the G â th â s (or for that matter any ancient text that carries a suffi cient number of unknown words) in any way one likes’. There is no point in reading ‘an ancient text’ if one has no intention of fi nding one’s way to its sense, understanding it as a discourse , that is to say, an expression of a conscious engagement with the world that defi ned its mental horizon. Students of ancient religions and myths cannot do without this horizon, their rhetorical statements to the contrary notwithstanding. On the other hand, one should certainly be alarmed once one’s image of a different Weltanschauung curiously resembles a stereotype of one’s own tradition. See Versnel 1990 , pp. 1–35. 32 Gnoli ( 1985 , p. 55) sketches the scheme in the following terms: ‘polyth é isme du type v é dique; condamnation de ce polyth é isme par Zoroastre; restauration par-tielle de ce polyth é isme en des synth è ses sacredotales successives, d’abord par les"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"42 Monotheistic thesispr ê tres avestiques et ensuite par les Mages m è des’. Why was the moment of purity so short lived? Answer: the elevated message was utterly incomprehensible to the contemporaries (so Gershevitch), who forthwith proceeded to rid themselves of its core principles of monotheism and ethical dualism. Why keep the name then? 33 In Zoroaster in History Gnoli prefers Burrow’s account of the divergent fates of the da ē vas and the gods of the Young Avestan pantheon: the former had a foreign origin, etc. See my discussion of Burrow in Chapter 3 . 34 Gnoli approvingly paraphrases Gershevitch: ‘Zoroaster condemned the da ē vas as such, as “Hirngespinste”, because he was a monotheist’ ( 1980 , p. 79 n.124). 35 See Duchesne-Guillemin 1953 , p. 13: ‘Sa pr é dication passionn é e, exclamatoire, est tout anim é e par la pr é sence qu’il sollicite et adjure sans cesse, et qui se r é v è le. Elle nous rappelle le ton des proph è tes d’Isra ë l. Zarathustra sait que Dieu parle par sa bouche’. See also Duchesne-Guillemin 1953 , pp. 71–84. 36 The status of Mazd ā , the nature of the G ā th ā s, and the question of the supposed G ā thic ritual are bound together. In my view, the most promising perspective on these issues is the following statement: ‘Toutes les actions r é alis é es par les “divin-it é s” inf é rieures du panth é on mazd é en sont li é es au projet eschatologique d’Ahura Mazd ā ’ (Panaino 2004 , p. 117). On the other hand, as I have mentioned, Panaino’s desire to save ‘le monoth é isme vieil-avestique’ is questionable.

"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 2 Ahura-cult thesis A number of scholars have tried to account for the repudiation of the da ē vas in the G ā th ā s within the frame of a postulated ahura cult. This so-called ‘ ahura theory’ was explicitly formulated in Martin Haug’s Essays on the Sacred Language, Writings and Religion of the Parsis fi rst published in 1862. Haug ( 1884 , pp. 267–76) notes the parallel but inverted fate in ancient India and Iran of the devas / da ē vas and the asuras / ahuras . Whereas Vedic India continues to use the term deva in its presumed Indo-European sense (‘god’), in Iran the term comes to designate, fi rst, a ‘bad god’ and eventually a ‘demon’. Conversely, while in India the term asura ends up by the late Vedic period as a categorial name for anti-gods, in Iran ahura develops an exclusively positive meaning, being used especially of the Iranian supreme god Mazd ā . It is true that these two semantic developments do not unfold within the same chronological frame; nonetheless, in view of the parallel inversions, Haug found it hard to view them as independent from each other. He proposed placing these seemingly parallel developments in a historical setting of socio-ethnic confl icts between Vedic Indians and inchoate Iranians, where ethno-cultural differences become a vehicle for a socio-economic antagonism between the warlike nomadic Indians and the pacifi c sedentary Iranians. The reaction of the Iranian victims of the Indian cattle-raids is the demonization of the latter’s gods, the devas . Thus develops the Iranian religion of the ahuras . Although Haug views Zoroaster as a monotheistic prophet who grafted onto his ‘theological monotheism’ a ‘philosophical dualism’ (Haug 1884 , pp. 301–305) as a work of theodicy, the condemnation of the da ē vas is not his prophetic achievement. In this way Haug effectively decouples the question of Zoroaster’s monotheism from the G ā thic repudiation of the da ē vas . Although in Haug, too, the assimilation of Zoroaster to the fi gure of Biblical prophet frames the interpretation of the G ā th ā s (Haug 1884 , pp. 294–308), the removal of the da ē vas from the ambit of the topic of monotheism opens a theoretical perspective different from the one considered in the previous chapter . A number of French and Swedish linguists and students of ancient reli-gions adopted this thesis to various degrees starting from the 1920s. Antoine Meillet ( 1925 , pp. 64–73) relocated the fault line of the socio-theological"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Ahura-cult thesis 45confl ict inside Iranian society itself. The G ā th ā s are an expression of the views and aspirations of pastoral and agricultural folks in the face of aris-tocratic masters. Mazd ā and the associated ‘active forces that preside over each activity’ in particular express the interests of the ‘working men’ who require ‘an orderly, peaceful society’ in order to ‘benefi t from their activities’. ‘On est bien plut ô t en face de vieille opposition des riches et des pauvres, des aristocrates et des cultivateurs. C’est cette opposition qui, seule, rend compte de l’importance dominante attribu é e par le zoroastrisme ancien à la doctrine de la r é tribution apr è s la mort’ (Meillet 1925 , p. 71). If I understand this last point correctly, the notion of an eschatological retribution is a reli-gious weapon in the class struggle, a sort of spiritual compensation for rela-tive socio-political and martial impotence. Kellens ( 2006 , pp. 80–81) rightly points out that the pastoralist vocabulary does not in itself make the G ā th ā s ‘le programme du parti paysan’. Meillet’s social explanation of Zoroastrian eschatology is perhaps somewhat crude, but one cannot dismiss the ques-tion of the social aspect of the condemnation of the da ē vas . Kellens ( 2006 , pp. 80–81) maintains that Meillet’s ‘antagonism between the poor and the rich’ is an arbitrary hypothesis, and that there is no clear expression in the G ā th ā s of an opposition to warlike activities as such. Although the terms Meillet uses to articulate the question of the social dimension of the condem-nation of the da ē vas in the G ā th ā s are not ideal, one cannot accept Kellens’ wholesale rejection of the issue. If it turns out that the G ā thic term a ē šə ma- ‘fury’ is specifi cally associated with a certain type of masculine society, per-haps of Indo-European origins, as has been claimed by Wikander ( 1938 , pp. 30–41, pp. 57–66) and Widengren ( 1969 , pp. 39–43, pp. 82–85), the social settings of the cult of the da ē vas may well be signifi cant in the condemnation of these gods. 1 Did the cult of the da ē vas have an initiatory pattern? In any case, the cult must be understood as an institution. Although in his La quat-ri è me naissance ( 2006 ) Kellens gives up his earlier (Kellens 1994 , pp. 82–84) idea that the da ē vas were never considered gods by Iranians and only ever played even in the G ā th ā s the role of ‘the accursed part of the pantheon’, he still seems reluctant to acknowledge the historical reality of an Iranian da ē va cult (see my discussion in Chapter 4 ). The view that the G ā th ā s are liturgies whose themes and terms must refl ect ritual phenomena is a hypothesis that unnecessarily narrows our view. Benveniste ( 1929 ) says virtually nothing about the da ē vas in the lectures he delivered at the Sorbonne in 1926. His main interest there was the accounts given by classical authors of three ‘Iranian religions’: the nature-worship of the ancient Persians found in Herodotus, the Cappadocian Mazd ā -worship in Strabo and Zurvanism in Plutarch. None of these is ‘Zoroastrian’ accord-ing to him, which means that they are different from the G ā thic religious view characterized by monotheism, ‘cosmic dualism’, the rejection of blood sacrifi ce and the affi rmation of moral purity (Benveniste 1929 , pp. 25–26). Zarathu š tra’s ‘religious reform’, Benveniste says, replaces the worship of natural phenomena with that of ‘moral abstractions’. Cosmic dualism"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"46 Ahura-cult thesispresumably means a dualism that embraces every aspect of life, although the two manifestations Benveniste mentions, the exposure of the corpse and destruction of ‘demonic’ creatures are not found in the G ā th ā s. It is not clear in what sense Benveniste considers G ā thic Mazdaism to be mono-theistic. Zurvanism, according to him, is not only the source of Mi θ raism and Manichaeism but also of Mazdaism: ‘It may be said without exagger-ation that Mazdeism is dualistic in so far as it is Zervanite’ (Benveniste 1929 , p. 116). The indirect remark he makes about the da ē vas seems to suggest that their repudiation should be understood in the context of a split and hostil-ity between the adherents of the ahura cult and those of the da ē va cult: the ‘name “the Lord Wisdom” indicates a being of the family of the Asuras, who were known through the Vedic texts in which they become evil spirits, as in Iran the ancient name of “god” (daiva) became that of the demon’ (Benveniste 1929 , p. 40). This view of the origins of the ‘demonization’ of the da ē vas is prima facie at odds with the thesis of the Zurvanite lineage of Mazdaism. For if the ‘cosmic dualism’ of the latter is a sign that it evolved from Zurvanism, which is supposed to have separated Iranian religions from their Indo-Iranian origins in pre-history, why do the G ā th ā s repudiate the da ē vas , the ancient Indo-Iranian gods? Should they not rather condemn the ‘evil spirit’ (alone), the harmful progeny of the ‘Endless Time’? The account given in the G ā th ā s of the ‘hostile’ or ‘deceitful intuition’ (Y 30.3–5) seems to place this being in the primordial times interacting with the da ē vas ; another passage (Y 32.5) explicitly says that it is the latter that bring the deceitful intuition’s primordial determination to bear on the destiny of man. It is thus the da ē vas that seem to be active in the human world. Why would a monothe-istic religion resuscitate false gods and integrate them into its cosmic dualism to play the role of the intermediary, where the ‘evil spirit’ is presumably quite capable of playing the antagonistic role? It is hard to reconcile the two the-ses: on one side, the Zurvanite genealogy of Mazdaean dualism and, on the other, the ahura -cult background of Mazdaean monotheism. 2 In his short article ‘Hommes et dieux dans l’Avesta’ ( 1967 ) Benveniste emphasizes the Indo-European origins of the Avestan expression ‘daivas + martyas’, and argues that the fact that it is still found as a formulaic phrase in the Young Avestan texts shows that in the G ā th ā s it still has its original sense of ‘gods and mortals’. If so, the G ā thic repudiation of the da ē vas can-not be interpreted as a condemnation of demons. Are these ancient Indo-Iranian deities the gods of a rival Iranian religion? The ‘fragmentising view’ of Benveniste (De Jong 1997 , pp. 44–49, pp. 63–66) might incline one to this interpretation. Whatever ‘repudiation’ may mean – condemnation or neg-ation? 3 – Benveniste’s position in 1967 is clearly at odds with his 1926 thesis of the Zurvanite origins of Iranian religions. The Iranian da ē va cult, one may speculate, must have bypassed the Zurvanite break. But the problem with this interpretation is that the G ā thic passages (e.g. Y 33.2–4, 46.1, 46.5–6) where one expects that the alien nature of the da ē va cult should be signalled rather affi rm the native status of its devotees (the ‘deceitful’ 4 ); they belong to the"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Ahura-cult thesis 47same community or social group as Zarathu š tra does. More importantly, it seems to me, again, that the da ē vas have an endemic position in the picture given of them in the G ā th ā s and are not repudiated as gods of outsiders. The integral status of the da ē vas is a problem for any approach that views them as ‘alien’ gods, whether this adjective is understood in an ethnic, cultic or histor-ical sense, or a combination of the latter two, as in the schemes of Benveniste, Nyberg and Duchesne-Guillemin. In a 1934 publication Benveniste explicitly gives his support to the ahura -cult thesis in a discussion of a number of Avestan words (e.g. ahura.t ka ē š a- or ahura. δ ā ta- ) in which ahura seems to be used as a divine appellation (Benveniste and Renou 1934 , pp. 42–49). These ‘traces’ of an ancient ahura cult, however, are specious: far from proving the existence of an ahura cult, their interpret-ation as ‘traces’ relies on the thesis (so Narten 1996 , p. 78). The fi rst occurs in a context (the Zoroastrian profession of faith, the frauuar ā n ē ) that leaves virtually no doubt that the term ahura in fact refers to Mazd ā . 5 There is no question that the name Ahura Mazd ā throughout the Avesta is understood as a composite name made of two words. 6 This means that only one of its components can participate in the composition of compounds that refer to the god. 7 Thus there are good linguistic grounds to view ahura. δ ā ta- as a dou-ble of mazda δ ata- . Kellens ( 1994 , p. 31) maintains that the choice between the two words is ‘uniquement dict é par la m é trique’. Benveniste implicitly arranges this ahura religion chronologically in relation to the ‘Zoroastrian Mazdaism’ but does not explore the implications of this arrangement for his earlier thesis of a Zurvanite break. One way or another, Benveniste and other adherents of the ahura -cult thesis believe that ‘Iranian religions’, despite their fragmentary nature, have a common origin, which marks them as specifi cally Iranian. To say that they are all non-Indic is more than just a statement of an ethnic fact; it describes a fundamental religious break. The question is how to interpret this constitutive threshold. Henrik S. Nyberg, the scholar of Semitic languages at the University of Uppsala, was active around the same time as Benveniste. We owe to his monu-mental work Die Religionen des alten Iran ( 1938 : German edition) the sharp-est formulation of the ahura -cult thesis. Despite the fact that there is not just one Iranian religion (he counts four), as the title of Nyberg’s work makes clear, the ahura -cult thesis seems to make it possible to ground them all in a constitutive opposition. Das arische Altertum kannte Asura ( iranisch Ahura) als eine Klasse von Gottwesen, die einer andern Klasse mit dem Namen Daiva (indisch Deva, iranisch Da ē va) nebengeordnet war. In der religi ö sen Geschichte der Arier haben diese beiden G ö ttergruppen um die Herrschaft gek ä mpft. Die Entwicklung ist so verlaufen, da ß in Indien die Devas siegten und die Asuras zuerst zur ü ckdr ä ngten, sp ä ter verdr ä ngten und auf die Stufe der D ä monen herabdr ü ckten, w ä hrend dagegen in Iran die Ahuras den Sieg davontrugen und die Da ē vas zu D ä monen herabdr ü ckten. Nach aller"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"48 Ahura-cult thesisWahrscheinlichkeit haben alle G ö tter der Lichtwelt in Iran von Anfang an den Namen Ahura gef ü hrt. (Nyberg 1938 , p. 96) The origins of the religious break between Iranians and Indians should not be sought in the history of ethnic confl icts but in the history of religions. In the Indo-Iranian religious world there were two ‘classes’ of divinities, the dai-vas and the asuras , and these two groups fought for supremacy. While in India the former prevailed, in Iran they succumbed to the latter. At one stroke, Nyberg accounts for the intriguing parallel, but inverse, semantic develop-ments of the two divine designations and the specifi cally Iranian identity of his four religions (Achaemenid, Magian, Mi θ raist and G ā thic). In this reli-gious-historical perspective, the rejection of the da ē vas and the elevation of the ahuras are coeval with Iranian religious culture (Nyberg 1938 , pp. 96–97). The attraction of this schema has been strong for those who reject the revolu-tionary nature of G ā thic religious thought. In the 1990s Kellens thought that the ‘demonization of the daiva- founds the Iranian cultural entity and goes back to the time of the breakup of the Aryans into two distinct branches’ (Kellens 1994 , p. 30), despite the fact that he generally rejected the thesis of an Iranian ahura cult. Behind its symmetrical simplicity, however, Nyberg’s position contains intractable diffi culties. The supposed struggle of the Indo-Iranian period between the two divine groups is really an empty postulate because, on the Indian side, the demonization of the asuras is a late Vedic development and thus could not have occurred in the time frame in which Nyberg places it. 8 Also, on the Iranian side, the ‘demonization’ of the da ē vas does not seem to have been a pan-Iranian phenomenon. Among a number of pieces of evi-dence, we have Xerxes’ so-called Daiva Inscription where he boasts of having banned the ‘daiva cult’ during an expedition. There is no point in interpreting the ‘daiva’ of this text to mean anything other than what it denotes so that it would suit one’s purposes. Nyberg himself acknowledges ( 1938 , p. 339) the existence of an Iranian da ē va cult refl ected in the da ē vic triad Indra, Saurva and N ā ŋ hai θ ia of the V ī d ē vd ā d. 9 It seems that in Nyberg’s work, the Ur-religious-historical dualism of the ahuras and the da ē vas is a manifestation of a theoretical perspective that makes dualism the horizon of ‘Iranian religions’. ‘Die Vorstellungen von den Zwillingen bilden also den Bestandteil einer traditionellen Theologie, die es vor Zarathustra in der Gathagemeinde gab’ (Nyberg 1938 , p. 104). This generalized dualism has for him a constant point of reference: Zurvanism. ‘Der Himmelsgott Ahura Mazd ā h ist in dieser von Zarathustra ü bernom-menen Theologie eine dem Zurv ā n des Westens parallele Erscheinung, er vertritt den Urvater in dem Zwillingsmythos des Ostens, w ä hrend Zurv ā n ihn in dem des Westens vertritt’ (Nyberg 1938 , p. 105). In the theology of the Gathagemeinde, Ahura Mazd ā is a ‘deus otiosus’, just as Zurvan is in the Magian religion of Western Iran. The ‘real creator of the good world’ is the"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Ahura-cult thesis 49‘effective Mainyu’. Zarathu š tra more or less perpetuates this situation; his Ahura Mazd ā is the creator of ‘all things’ through the ‘effective Mainyu’. The real antagonism in the G ā th ā s is that of the ‘effective Mainyu’ and the ‘hostile Mainyu’. The dualistic frame is inherited, but its transposition in terms of an ‘ethic of good and bad’ is the specifi cally G ā thic achievement, which defi nes the eschatological perspective of Zoroastrianism (Nyberg 1938 , pp. 226–32). Nyberg emphasizes the ‘ethical nature’ of the dualism by contrasting it with both ‘physical’ and ‘metaphysical’ ones. Die Aufteiling in Gut und B ö se, die f ü r unsere Welt charakteristisch ist, ist nicht dadurch zustande gekommen, da ß die einen gut und die andern b ö se geschaffen wurden, sondern sie beruht auf einer urzeitlichen Wahl. Sie ist ethischer Nature. Es hat einst im freien Ermessen der Wesen gestanden, zwischen Leben und Nicht-Leben zu w ä hlen. (Nyberg 1938 , p. 105) The contrast with ‘metaphysical dualism’ is problematic, though, since, if the primordial ‘determination ( dad- )’ by the two ‘Mainyus’ of ‘life and ruin-ation’ (Y 30.4) does not count as ‘metaphysical’, nothing would. 10 If the choice between ‘good and evil’ for mortals in fact amounts to the choice between ‘living and ruination’, as Nyberg has it, then the symmetry with the myth-ical model breaks down. For in contrast to the immortal beings, mortals by defi nition choose living, just as ruination by defi nition is always the choice of one’s adversary. Among the mortals, the will to self-ruination or general destruction would only be imputed and never acknowledged. On the other hand, the idea of a will to evil as such, of choosing an evil maxim, and not simply a malum defectus (a failure of the will to make the good the ground of its choice) – if this idea is implied in the primordial choice of an immortal being, as it appears in Nyberg’s view of it, such a wilful choice of evil would be incomprehensible without positing an evil nature behind it, for an immor-tal being in contrast to mortals has no incentive in choosing ‘life’ or its oppos-ite. 11 The choice of evil for such a being would be either completely arbitrary or in accordance with its nature. In either case, it would have nothing ‘ethical’ about it. In short, the primordial ‘choice’ of the two ‘spirits’ cannot be under-stood as the ‘model’ of an ethical choice for mortals. As far as mortals are concerned, the dualistic admonition addressed to them to choose life (and not destruction of life) is really asking them to side with the author of the address. We know that the G ā thic choice of ‘life’ in no way implies naturist pacifi sm, so that, e.g. understood as abstention from killing, ‘life’ could become a con-crete value for the will. In the absence of this concrete sense, ‘life’ cannot be an object of the will but the name one may give to the side one has taken. Nyberg shows no real interest or curiosity in the question of the treatment of the da ē vas in the G ā th ā s. The general dualist frame of analysis together with the idea of an ethical transposition of dualism decides their fate in Nyberg’s work. In the generalized dualism that Nyberg posits, the cause of"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"50 Ahura-cult thesisthe antagonism is incidental, and hence no thought is given to it. The ahuras are at war with the da ē vas – for supremacy. It seems natural enough for the two classes of gods to vie for the upper hand. And since in Iran the ahuras became ascendant, the da ē vas had to be demonized. What requires atten-tion, in Nyberg’s mind, is that G ā thic dualism is not a confrontation of two ‘natures’, one good and one bad, but grounded in the ‘ethical’ choices of the two ‘spirits’, one supposedly choosing living and the other ruination. This ‘ethical dualism’ makes one side not just bad but also morally culpable, since ‘in freedom’ it has chosen to destroy life. It is this choice, in Nyberg’s account, with which each mortal in turn is confronted and for which he is accountable at the end of his life. But we have seen that the ‘choice’ between living and ruination can constitute an ‘ethical’ perspective neither for mortals nor for immortals. According to Duchesne-Guillemin ( 1953 , pp. 22–29) there were two basic Iranian religious systems: an ahura cult and a da ē va cult. Zoroastrianism is a development of the former, which is characterized by monotheism centred on the fi gure of Ahura Mazd ā (Duchesne-Guillemin 1953 , p. 28). The ele-vation of Mazd ā may be considered a result of the activity of Zarathu š tra, whose teachings are found in the G ā th ā s (Duchesne-Guillemin 1962 , p. 145). But since we cannot be sure whether the Achaemenid religion was infl uenced by Zarathu š tra’s views, we are not in a position to judge which of the G ā thic teachings are specifi cally his. Nonetheless, it seems possible to recognize in the prophet’s teachings a ‘m é lange original de dualisme et de monoth é isme’ (Duchesne-Guillemin 1953 , p. 55). The condemnation of the da ē vas is a trad-itional position of ahura religion, and merely taken up by Zarathu š tra, who ‘accentuates this movement... by absolutely interdicting any cult that had non- ahuras as objects’ (Duchesne-Guillemin 1962 , pp. 190–91). This presum-ably means that there were still da ē va -worshippers active in Zarathu š tra’s time and land. 12 The post-G ā thic rehabilitation of the pre-Zoroastrian ahuras , according to Duchesne-Guillemin, takes place in accordance with the social-functional differentiation of the Indo-Iranian pantheon. 13 Ahuras , the gods of the fi rst social function, the sovereign-priest, are admitted back into the cult, albeit strictly subordinated to Mazd ā , but the da ē vas , the gods of the warrior class, are kept out, as are those of the third function. But if in fact this selection criterion lies at the basis of the post-G ā thic pantheon it must also be the one that had originally separated the followers of the two original cults: ‘La condemnation des anciens dieux, r é duits en Iran à se confondre avec ces d é mons, para î t ê tre œ uvre cl é ricale, puisqu’elle porte exclusivement... sur les dieux des deux fonctions non sacredotales’ (Duchesne-Guillemin 1962 , p. 190). In other words, the post-G ā thic pantheon restores the gods of the pre-Zarathu š tra ahura cult. By in part drawing on the Vedic characteristics of the asuras , Duchesne-Guillemin points in particular to two specifi c features of the ahura : the ahuras are the guardians of arta , the true order, and pos-sess the magic creative power m ā y ā . Zarathu š tra is an inheritor of the ahura cult and as such could not but condemn the da ē vas . ‘The word da ē va seems"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Ahura-cult thesis 51to signify three things’: (1) in the ancient formula ‘daivas + martyas’, it does not seem to have a pejorative sense and simply means ‘god’; (2) it could also mean ‘demon’ and be used of supernatural beings whether of Indo-Iranian (e.g. Gandvrwa) or Avestan (e.g. Apao š a) origins; (3) but in the majority of the cases, ‘ da ē va est synonyme de non- ahura . C’est dans cette acception que d’anciens dieux sont d é sign é s (dans l’Avesta r é cent) comme da ē vas ... Il est remarquable – et certainement essentiel – que tous sont d’anciens dieux des 2 e et 3 e fonctions’ (Duchesne-Guillemin 1962 , p. 190). The da ē vas are the ancient (i.e. Indo-Iranian) gods of the second and third social functions, which explains, in Duchesne-Guillemin’s mind, why their repudiation may be thought to have been the work of the exponents of the sacerdotal class. In Duchesne-Guillemin’s view, the G ā thic ‘monotheism’ is the exclusive worship of Mazd ā ‘avec son escorte’, the ‘entities’ (Duchesne-Guillemin 1962 , p. 145), called Aməš\ta Spən\u0005ta in the Young Avestan texts. Where do these entities come from, and is there a principle that presides over their list? According to him, ‘ce principe appara î t, d è s qu’on s’avise, avec Dum é zil, que cette liste est parall è le à celle des fonctions sociales et des dieux qui les repr é sen-tent’ (Duchesne-Guillemin 1962 , p. 200). The same tripartite ideology ‘permet d’ é lucider compl è tement la s é rie des objets mat é riels patronn é s par les entit é s’ (Duchesne-Guillemin 1962 , p. 202). The Dum é zilian scheme fully accounts for the existence, function and order of the entities. Moreover, comparative data allows us to name the ‘suppressed’ (or, in Dum é zil’s words, ‘substituted’) Indo-Iranian gods (or, in any case, their Indo-Aryan epigones) behind the entities: Vohu Manah is Mitra; A š a is Varun \u0004 a; X š a θ ra is In \u0004 dra; Haurvat ā t/Amvrvt ā t are the two N ā satyas; and the trivalent A \u0007 rmaiti is the goddess of fecundity. The list ‘ é num è re, dans leur ordre, les trois fonctions sociales: sou-verainet é (en ses deux aspects), guerre, f é condit é ’ (Duchesne-Guillemin 1962 , p. 201). The suppression of the ‘gods’ in favour of the ‘entities’ is declared to be the work of Zarathu š tra. ‘Disposant d’un double syst è me traditionnel de dieux et d’entit é s...

It is, at least in part, due to the desire to harmonize the perceived dualism and monotheism in the G ā th ā s, which in 1953 he ‘credits’ to Zarathu š tra in the form of a ‘m é lange original de dualisme et de monoth é isme’. The system constituted by the one true god and the ‘entities’ as his ‘aspects’ defi nes a comprehensive monotheism, a monar-chical monotheism as it were. Just as the Indo-Iranian king is supposed to have united in his person all the three functions, 15 so through his ‘aspects’ Mazd ā is a universal god, and thereby the one god. On the other hand, one cannot account for the radical G ā thic dualism within this system, hence the role of the thesis of a pre-Zarathu š tra anti- da ē vic ahura cult. We then have a confusing situation: the da ē vas , the non- ahura gods of the second and third"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"52 Ahura-cult thesisclasses, are at one and the same time rejected – precisely because they are not the gods of the fi rst class, the ahuras – and functionally accommodated in the system of Aməš\ta Spən \u0004 ta entities. Although ‘ignored’, Mi θ ra and Aryaman, two Indo-Iranian ahuras according to Duchesne-Guillemin, ‘are never called da ē vas ’ because they belong to the fi rst function (Duchesne-Guillemin 1962 , p. 190). Does this mean that the ancient ahuras are in some sense less repu-diated than the da ē vas in the G ā th ā s? 16 He further adds to the confusion by declaring that the ahuras in the G ā thic expression ‘Mazd ā + ahuras ’ are probably the entities ‘qui n’avaient pas encore re ç u leur d é signation collect-ive d’immortels salutaires’ (Duchesne-Guillemin 1995 , p. 46). 17 As an expo-nent of the ahura cult, Zarathu š tra ‘accentuates’ that tradition by ‘absolutely interdicting’ the cult of the da ē vas , the non- ahura gods of the non-sacerdotal classes, but at the same time he is contemptuous of the ahuras since he is the prophet of the one true god; despite all this, in yet another twist, he function-ally admits the non-sacerdotal gods into the Mazdaean pantheon in the form of ‘entities’, who appear as the ahuras in the G ā th ā s: the two ‘traditional’ ahuras (the counterparts of Varun \u0004 a and Mitra) plus the rehabilitated gods of the non-sacerdotal classes in their functionally equivalent ‘entity’ forms. One major contributor to this conceptual confusion is the double application of Dum é zil’s scheme: once in order to account for the list of the entities, as Dum é zil ( 1986 , pp. 43–51) does himself, and once in order to place the G ā thic condemnation of the da ē vas in the frame of the thesis of a pre-Zarathu š tra ahura cult. Dum é zil, too, tries to explain the Avestan pantheon along the same lines as Duchesne-Guillemin’s ahura -cult thesis. The difference is that Dum é zil sees the clerical ejection of the non-sacerdotal gods as a post-G ā thic development. Ainsi les th é ologiens qui, quelques g é n é rations sans doute apr è s Zoroastre, ont r é introduit les dieux fonctionnels dans la religion r é form é e, n’ont retenu comme dieux que ceux de la premi è re fonction... ils ne pouvai-ent concevoir la purifi cation de la religion, la “r é forme”, que comme l’extension à tous les niveaux de l’id é ologie et de la morale propres au leur.

(Dum é zil 1986 , pp. 42–43) This of course leaves open the question of why the da ē vas are condemned in the G ā th ā s and, if the ‘typical examples’ are post-G ā thic additions, the question of the identity of the G ā thic da ē vas . Dum é zil’s post-G ā thic clerical intervention, just like Duchesne-Guillemin’s pre-G ā thic one, remains ad hoc . His psychological explanation is unconvincing. The supposed ‘threat’ from the non-sacerdotal gods – does it pertain to their character and activities or their identity? In the latter case, it is never considered a ‘threat’ elsewhere in"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Ahura-cult thesis 53the Indo-European areas, and, if the ‘tri-functional ideology’ has any mean-ing, this has to be the legitimation of a hierarchical tripartite society and pantheon. The elimination of two tiers of the pantheon is incomprehensible within this frame. In the former case, not only does this ‘revolution from above’ (Dum é zil 1986 , p. 120) spawn new non-sacerdotal gods, e.g. Drv ā sp ā and G ə u š urvan (Dum é zil 1986 , p. 118), it also reassigns warrior functions, left in search of an agent by the ejection of Indra, to a god of the fi rst func-tion, Mi θ ra, assisted by a second-function god V ə r ə θ ra γ na (Dum é zil 1986 , pp. 118–21). This shows that the ‘threat’ can no more be accounted to the type of activities of the non-sacredotal gods. Moreover, as can be seen from the list Pirart ( 2008 , p. 39) gives of the Avestan deities that preserve their Indo-Iranian status, not all the supposed Indo-Iranian gods of the non-sacerdotal classes are demonized in the Young Avestan texts, e.g. V ā ta, Vayu, Haoma. 18 If Dum é zil never wants to know about the motivations behind the G ā thic condemnation of the da ē vas , which must be one of the important aspects of ‘la r é forme zoroastrienne’, it is because for him, too, the ‘pure Zoroastrianism’ is monotheistic. In the G ā th ā s ‘o ù le monoth é isme r è gne absolument, o ù , sous Ahura Mazd ā , aucune des personnes divines dont les noms sont aussi v é diques n’a é t é retenue, ni comme dieu ni comme d é mon’ (Dum é zil 1986 , p. 41), there is no reason to ask why certain gods are repudiated, since ‘mono-theism’ acknowledges only one god. 19 Dum é zil’s appeal to the psychology of the ‘prophet’ is tautological. ‘Zoroastre, en bannissant tous les anciens dieux fonctionnels au profi t du Dieu unique, n’a pas voulu perdre une philosophie dont il continuait d’appr é cier la valeur, celle qu’exprimait leur multiplicit é et leur rapports’ (Dum é zil 1986 , p. 147). 20 In contrast to Dum é zil, the ahura -cult thesis makes the repudiation of the da ē vas a fact of the cultural milieu where Zarathu š tra steps onto the historical stage, a repudiation that, effected by the clerical proponents of the ahura cult, becomes a constituent of the intellectual tradition that the ‘reformer’ inher-its. Duchesne-Guillemin believes that the ‘reason’ for the rejection must be sought in the ‘fact’ that the da ē vas belong to the non-sacerdotal classes. 21 In the frame of Dum é zil’s theory of tripartite ideology, this would be a very odd development. As I mentioned, this ideology legitimates the tripartite struc-ture of the pantheon no less than the tripartite division of society; or rather it explains the former as a refl ection of the latter. Duchesne-Guillemin acknow-ledges this when he takes up Dum é zil’s account of the tripartite ideology. The Dum é zilian explanation of the G ā thic repudiation of the da ē vas leads to an impasse. Mary Boyce is as committed to the ahura -cult thesis as the scholars we just considered: ‘Before Zoroaster preached, such antagonism existing between the adherents of ahuras and da ē vas had probably not prevented the prudent man from offering sacrifi ces to both’ (Boyce 1975 , p. 251). It is true that even before Zoroaster these ‘gods’ were rejected by the adherents of the ahuras , she suggests, but this condemnation had not yet found its way to cult practice. The ‘most diffi cult point of Zoroaster’s new doctrines for the people at large"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"54 Ahura-cult thesisto accept was his utter rejection of the da ē vas . He himself acknowledged the power and ubiquity of their wicked company, the da ē vad ā t ; and he showed therefore the greatest courage, as well as the utmost faith in Ahura Mazd ā , in defying them and denying them all worship’ (Boyce 1975 , p. 251). His ‘offer-ing hope of salvation to every morally good person’, no matter how humble, offended the aristocratic establishment. The emphasis on the ‘moral quality’ of the faithful and making this the condition of salvation decided the fate of the ‘materialistic’ da ē vas . What gave the coup de gr â ce to these ‘warlike’ gods must have been this new, specifi cally Zoroastrian, doctrine of salvation. Although Boyce never makes the dependence of salvation on moral goodness the frame of her account of the G ā thic rejection of the da ē vas , she does expli-citly link ‘morality’ and salvation. This allows her to maintain both the thesis of a pre-Zarathu š tra, anti- da ē vic ahura cult and the ‘revolutionary’ character of Zoroastrianism. Some ‘opposition between the ethical Asuras and Indra was felt already in the Indo-Iranian period, and the times of the great migrations probably intensifi ed awareness of this’ (Boyce 1975 , p. 252). For Boyce, Zarathu š tra is an inheritor of the ahura religion and ahuric rejection of the da ē va cult because of its encouragement of ‘unethical’ practices. It is stated ‘in Pahlavi literature’ that the adherents of the cult ‘did not believe in moral rewards and punishments, which suggests that the Da ē va-worshippers had the sim-ple materialistic outlook of the Vedic devotee of Indra, seeking happiness here and hereafter through divine favours accorded him in direct return for his offerings’ (Boyce 1975 , p. 252). One could fairly say that in her account the basis of the repudiation of the da ē vas is their warlike nature and their worshippers’ amoral conception of the desirable life and salvation, which is reduced to a kind of barter. Morality is thus the ground of condemnation of the da ē vas . Instead of propitiating them, as continued to be the practice of even ahura worshippers, one must fi ght them and their followers. Indeed, Boyce could have referred to a number of passages in the G ā th ā s that show in just how thoroughgoing a fashion the combat against the ‘powers of dark-ness’ 22 was conceived. Y 46.4 praises the one who deprives the ‘adherent of deceit’ of his power and livelihood; 46.6 says association with the ‘deceitful’ will deliver one to the bonds of druj ; and 46.8 wishes misery for the deceitful. Y 53.9 looks forward to an a š\u0004 auuan- ahura- depriving those who have made the ‘wrong choice’ ( du ž uuar ə na- ) of their ‘livelihood and liberty’. However, the idea that the qualifi cation for salvation involves more than just being ritually adequate (as in the Vedic doctrine) remains, in my mind, a supposition in Boyce’s work. 23 Neither opposition to war and bloodshed as such nor G ā thic ‘anti-ritualism’ (which she certainly does not espouse, as opposed to Gnoli, for example) can be regarded as the substance of what she means by ‘ethical’. This leaves only the ‘values’ of the ‘peaceful pas-toralist tribes in search of settlement’ – more or less the same values that Bartholomae ( 1924 , pp. 16–17) saw refl ected in the ‘third stage’ of the devel-opment of Zarathu š tra’s doctrine – opposed by the ‘ruthless, predatory’"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Ahura-cult thesis 55warriors ‘delighting in combat for its own sake and for the booty it could bring’. 24 These warlike bands ‘would naturally have worshipped the unscru-pulous Indra, warlike and bountiful, whereas settled peoples were much more likely to have offered their heartfelt prayers to the Ahuras, guardians of order and peace’ (Boyce 1975 , p. 252). The ahuras are the ‘guardians of order and peace’ hence they are ‘ethical’. An elective affi nity between a way of life and a certain type of deity has some plausibility as a general proposition. But the problem is that Boyce uses it to conjure up germane gods for the two types of existence that she imagines must have defi ned by and large the Iranian popula-tions of the end of the second millennium BC . The peaceful people must have had ‘ethical’ gods, and the warlike people ‘unethical’ ones. But Zarathu š tra repudiates da ē vas and not Indra alone. The Vedic N ā satyas are not primarily warriors but saviours, especially eschatological. 25 Boyce wants to infer from the ‘unethical’ nature of Indra 26 not only that the defi ning characteristic of the da ē vas was their warlike nature but also that this was the reason why they were rejected by the ‘ethical’ ahura worshippers. In fact, Boyce’s extension of the ‘unethical’ quality of Indra (and Š arva) 27 to the da ē vas must be based on her thesis of an Iranian cult of the ‘ethical Ahuras’ (i.e. the guardians of peace and order, the ‘benefi cent’ gods of peaceful tribes), which requires in the da ē vas , rejected in the G ā th ā s, the opposite quality. In her later work she somewhat revises her interpretation of the pre-Zoroastrian da ē va . It no longer refers to a warlike divinity but seems to be a general term for ‘god’ that subsequently acquired its pejorative meaning through its being used as divine appellation by warlike worshippers. It seems likely that already before Zoroaster’s own day there was a strong consciousness among the law-abiding ‘Avestan’ people of being above all ahura-tkae š a , ‘adhering to the teaching of the Ahuras’, while they may have looked on their more warlike fellows as indiscriminate ‘worshippers of the gods’, daevayasna ; and that it was through this contrast that the meaning of the word daeva ‘god’ came to stand particularly for those div-inities whom warriors most venerated. (Boyce 1992 , p. 72) Boyce carries the later usage of the title ahura to the G ā th ā s (Boyce 1975 , pp. 40–52). 28 According to her, behind the G ā thic phrase ‘and (other) ahuras ’ in Y 30.9 and 31.4 ‘can only be Mi θ ra and *Vouruna Ap ą m Nap ā t’ (Boyce 1975 , p. 195, cf. p. 23), who together with Ahura Mazd ā constitute the ahura class of gods. As far as I can see, she bases this assertion on four dispar-ate fi ndings. First, aside from Mazd ā , the title ahura is used of Mi θ ra and Ap ą m Nap ā t in the Young Avestan texts. 29 Second, in the R \u0003 gveda, Mitra and Varun \u0004 a are the guardians of Rta , Avestan aš\u000ba , the ‘moral order’ (Boyce 1975 , p. 32). In the Avesta, however, neither Mi θ ra’s nor Ap ą m Nap ā t’s link with aš\u000ba is signifi cant in their character. Third, ‘the ancient Indo-Iranian asuras all personify abstract concepts’ (Boyce 1975 , p. 23): mitra- means ‘covenant,"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"56 Ahura-cult thesisloyalty’ (Boyce 1975 , p. 25), varun \u0004 a- ‘binding utterance, oath’ ( 1975 , 34), medh ā \u000b - (which she maintains is the Vedic counterpart of mazd ā - ) ‘insight, wisdom’ (Boyce 1975 , p. 39). The second and the third translations (so also Thieme 1970 , p. 411 ‘Wahrheitswort’, and p. 409 ‘Weisheit’, respectively) are controversial. 30 Fourth, one of the cosmic activities of Varun \u0004 a is said in the R \u0003 gveda to be the production of rain (Boyce 1975 , p. 33), so this Vedic god has to be the Avestan Ap ą m Nap ā t. Whatever the value of each, they are not probative for her thesis in the face of the lack of G ā thic evidence: why is no mention made of them in the G ā th ā s? 31 Y 43.3 mentions an ahura that is clearly not Mazd ā . 32 According to Boyce’s thesis, this must be either Ap ą m Nap ā t or Mi θ ra: but why the reticence in naming the god? Moreover, why use the plural instead of the dual in Y 30.9 mazd å sc ā ahur åŋ h ō ‘Mazd ā and (other) ahuras ’, if there are in fact only two ‘other ahuras ’ – a perfect occa-sion for using the dual? 33 I have not questioned so far the validity of the thesis of an ahura class of gods. From the beginning, this thesis was no more than an assumption. 34 The Vedic scholars who were attentive to the semantics of the usage of asura in the R \u0003 gveda, like Oldenberg, noticed that in the earlier hymns (the so-called Family Books) the term does not have a negative meaning and that it is especially used of the gods that possess the m ā y ā . 35 Accordingly, Oldenberg thought that the semantic developments of asura / ahura and deva / da ē va in ancient India and Iran were independent. He also rejected the idea that asuras formed a specifi c class of beings in the oldest part of the Vedas (Oldenberg 2004 , pp. 45–51, pp. 85–88, pp. 141–50). The certainty that the term asura is not a categorical designation came in 1986. After a thorough examination of the Vedic and Br ā hman \u0004 ic material Hale concluded that in the earliest parts of the R \u0003 gveda, asura means ‘lord’ or ‘leader’ and does not designate a particular kind of being, and that it is used only in the singular (or dual) and never in the plural (Hale 1986 , pp. 52–53). The change of connotation from the posi-tive to the negative seems to be underway in the S ā maveda , where it is close in meaning to the word d á syu– , but the four occurrences of asura in the singular are still positive (Hale 1986 , p. 130). ‘ Á sura- had the basic meaning “lord” in the Indo-Iranian period and continued to have this meaning in the RV. But by the time of the composition of the Br ā hman \u0004 as it had taken the meaning of “demon” or “anti-god”. It is probable that some already extant concept of demon served as a model for at least part of this developing meaning’ (Hale 1986 , p. 135). Hale plausibly suggests that this ‘model’ was the d á syu- and d ā sa- , referring to peoples who seem to have been the enemies of the Vedic Indo-Aryans. 36 His conclusions make the ahura -cult thesis untenable as they remove its mainstay, that is to say, the presence of an asura type of gods in the oldest layer of the Vedic tradition. Hale in effect shows that (1) the term develops its negative meaning in the attested Vedic period, 37 and that this development is not in the context of a religious-historical interaction with the devas ; and (2) it comes to denote a category of supernatural beings in the later Vedic period in a kind of semantic coupling with the terms dasyu- and"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Ahura-cult thesis 57 d ā sa- that designated the human enemies of the Aryans, so that correspond-ingly asuras become the enemies of the devas . 38 He thus offers a convincing, comprehensive account of the formation of the demonic class of asuras in the later Vedic period. Since from the beginning the ahura -cult thesis had relied on the supposed Vedic evidence, with the disappearance of the latter, the the-sis collapses; or, so it should. The scholars who deny the reform aspect of Zoroastrianism, however, have found it diffi cult to let go of the idea of an interaction between the semantic developments of the Indian and Iranian couples. While acknowledging the conclusions of Hale’s study and its implications for the interpretation of the G ā thic repudiation of the da ē vas , Kellens ( 2006 , p. 147) is reluctant to accept the independence of the two ‘demonizations’, which he fi nds ‘intellectually diffi cult to accept’. The reluctance is understandable, because if there are no grounds to think that the G ā th ā s continue a pre-Zoroastrian tradition that in doctrine and cult repudiated the supposed Indo-Iranian * daivas , one would have to come to terms with the historical reality of an Iranian da ē va cult, and consider the condemnation of these deities in the G ā th ā s against that histor-ical background. Narten ( 1996 , p. 65) succinctly formulates the ineluctable consequence: ‘F ü r Zarathustra, den ü berzeugten Verehrer Ahura Mazd ā s und seiner g ö ttlichen Helfer, waren die Da ē vas, die anderen G ö ttter, zweifel-los ebenso existent’. 39 And in fact there is historical evidence that the da ē vas were worshipped among Iranian-speaking peoples. Whatever the origins and the process of the ‘demonization’ of these ancient gods, its sheer extension, in view of the vastness of the territory and the imaginable diffi culties inherent in any form of religious ‘conversion’, require explanation. It may seem that in the process the divine appellation itself (or one of the Iranian words for god) is discredited. In any case, it has been the perspective of many scholars that the word da ē va is a general term meaning god. The question whether the process ‘originated’ in the G ā th ā s does not belong to the order of histor-ical knowledge. Nothing in history has a simple origin. The idea that a new intuition of the divine formed in the mind of a noble prophet is at the origin of Zoroastrianism, or of any other religion for that matter, should be left to hagiographic tracts. This is not to deny the role of the charismatic individ-ual, which is plausible enough as an important factor in the formation of the movement whose effects are more or less known historical facts. But the whole picture of a noble prophet heeding the word of the one true god and admonishing his fellows and inviting them to the new faith, etc. – this Biblical costume drama does not belong to the G ā th ā s. Zarathu š tra’s god is not distin-guished from the da ē vas by his being morally ‘good’, as Narten maintains: Zarathustras Ablehnung des Da ē vas und des Da ē va-Kultes ist – zumind-est so, wie es die Gathas darstellen – im wesentlichen ethisch bedingt. F ü r Zarathustra is der Gott, den er verk ü ndet, die Verk ö perung des Guten. Entsprechend sind auch die Menschen, die Ahura Mazd ā verehren, gut. (Narten 1996 , p. 82)"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"58 Ahura-cult thesis This ‘explanation’ of the G ā thic rejection of the da ē vas amounts to no more than a nomenclature, since no account is given of what is understood by ‘good’ or ‘bad’. 40 Just as in Boyce and Gnoli, one suspects modern humanistic sentiments behind the adjective ‘ethical’ and hence the explanation that relies on it. The question of the ethical character of Zoroastrianism, and in particu-lar its supposed ethically inspired rejection of the Indo-Iranian da ē vas , is a pseudo-problem so long as one does not say what one means by ‘ethical’. Saying that the da ē vas are repudiated because they are ‘evil’ or ‘unethical’, supposedly showing the ethical nature of the religion, does not elucidate anything. The picture given by Narten and others relies on the transparency of the notion of ‘good’, to which the ‘ethical’ rejection of the da ē vas refers. Again, in what sense is Zarathu š tra’s god the embodiment of ‘Good’? Far from illuminating the G ā thic ideological horizon, terms like ‘ethical’, ‘free choice’, ‘good’ help create a substitute universe where everything is simultan-eously transparent and inscrutable, since everyone knows what the good is, that choice creates responsibility, etc., which automatically ‘explains’ – e.g. the da ē vas are repudiated because they are ‘evil’ – what one wants to explain. We have seen how this whole procedure, as soon as it commits itself even in the most passing way to the givens of the text, to the words of the G ā th ā s, runs into irresolvable diffi culties. Once one equates the ‘good’ with ‘living’, as Nyberg does, it becomes impossible to describe as ‘ethical’ the primordial ‘choice’ of the two spirits; and once we restore the mythical dimension of the ‘choice’ and set out its implications, the supposed distinction between the ethical and the metaphysical becomes meaningless. As for the mortals’ choice of ‘life’, we saw that this choice can in no way be described as ethical, since there cannot be an ethical action without a concrete maxim that directs it, and ‘life’ does not constitute a concrete value in the opposition of ‘life and ruination’. The term ‘life’ in the G ā th ā s does not belong to a moral discourse but to a religious confrontation that seems to be primarily over eschatological issues. For Boyce, the ahuras are ‘ethical’ because they promote ‘peace and order’, that is to say, the values of the peaceful pastoralists as opposed to the warlike gods of the nomadic warrior bands, the da ē vas . The term ‘ethical’ is then redundant, so much so that its usage only arouses the suspicion that it means something more elevated than merely the maintenance of peace and order, since, after all, this can also be achieved by Machiavellian means. One is then free to understand this ‘something’ as one pleases, in keeping with one’s modern humanistic sentiments, and feels no need to render any account of it. There is no point trying to imagine what the author could mean by the extra ‘something’ that the term ‘ethical’ should signal. One can only analyse and criticize what is articulated.

See Boyce 1992 , pp. 38–39: ‘In the Rigveda, by contrast, the word marya survives only used in laudatory fashion of chariot-riding gods, notably of the band of youthful Maruts’. It is reasonable to think that the term was originally used by the Indo-Iranians as the designa-tion for members of warrior bands. See also Heesterman 1962 and Parpola 1997 , pp. 195–96. 2 See Benveniste 1929 , pp. 39–40: ‘[W]e have strong reasons for thinking that this very ancient god was merely utilised and brought into prominence by the Zoroastrian reform... His abstract name, Mazd â h, is prior to the reform, to which he does not even owe the essential r ô le which has developed upon [sic] him’. 3 Benveniste ( 1967 , p. 146) writes: ‘Pour Zarathu š tra, les daivas sont encore les “dieux” de la vieille religion, dieux honnis certes, mais dieux r é els et qui avaient leurs fi d è les’. The da ē vas are ‘real gods’ in so far as they have ‘their faithful’. The question is whether they are considered in the G ā th ā s to be ‘bad’ gods or only ‘false’ gods, who are worshipped by (adverse) other groups, and ‘real’ in this sense. The thesis of G ā thic monotheism requires the latter interpretation. 4 Cf.

I take this to imply that the follower of druj practices the da ē va cult, so Narten 1996 , p. 83: ‘Die Verehrer der Da ē vas hingegen (i.e. the a š\u0004 auuan- ), der nach Zarathustras Auffassung ausnahmlos “schlechten” G ö tter, sind ihrerseits ebenfalls schlecht, es sind Menschen, die dr ə guuan \u0004 t- “trughaft, Anh ä nger des Trugs” genannt werden’. 5 The Zoroastrian profession of faith uses both components: frauuar ā n ē mazdaiiasn ō zara θ u š tri š v ī da ē uu ō ahura.t ̃ ka ē š ō ‘I declare my choice of being a Mazd ā worshipper in the manner of Zarathu š tra, a denouncer of the da ē vas , an adherent of the doc-trine of the ahura ’. Is the presence of two words that refer to the god just a matter of having both components of the divine name in the all-important Zoroastrian ‘con-fession’? In other words, do mazdaiiasna- and ahura.t ̃ ka ē š a- mean the same thing? Or, are they complementary? What, then, does each signify? Compare Narten 1996 , p. 79; Pirart 2012 , pp. 181–96. 6 See Kellens 1984 , pp. 133–36. 7 See Narten 1996 , pp. 78–81. She pertinently observes: ‘Nun werden beide W ö rter von den Gathas an bis ins j ü ngere Avesta hinein auch einzeln zur Bezeichnung Ahura Mazd ā s verwendet’ (Narten 1996 , p. 78). As for the dvandva mi θ ra.ahura b ə r ə zan \u0004 ta ‘Mi θ ra and Ahura, the majestic two’, I fi nd Narten’s remarks convincing. That ahura in the expression refers to Mazd ā may be inferred from its occurrence in a typical formula of reverence yazamaide ‘we worship’ at the end of the Mihr Ya š t, the hymn to Mi θ ra, where it was felt that the name of the supreme god had to be included in the fi nal statement of worship. This inference becomes a virtual certainty once one observes that the order of the components is reversed in the passages from the Yasna: ‘das G ö tter-namenkompositum wurde dort sozusagen mazdayasnisch korrigiert, indem man den Namen Ahura Mazd ā s an den Anfang stellte’. The reversal of the order ( ahura.mi θ ra ) in the face of the dvandva ‘rule’ (the word with fewer syllables precedes) indicates that the term ahura indeed refers to the supreme god. 8 I will come back to the question of the existence of an Indo-Iranian divine class of asuras . 9 The mention of the three da ē vas in the V ī d ē vd ā d shows, according to Nyberg’s the-sis of a West-Iranian Magian religion, that the ancient Medes ‘ urspr ü nglich das-selbe altarische Pantheon gehabt haben, wie die Arier von Mittani .

It is not clear, though, how these da ē vas man-aged to survive among the ‘ancient Medes’ even after the Indo-Iranian split. 10 Y 30.4 in Panaino’s translation: ‘Alors, le fait que ces deux Mainiiu se confrontent, d é termine, en principe, la vie ( gaiia- ) et la non-vie ( ajii ā ti- ), de mani è re qu’ à la fi n, la pire existence soit celle des partisans de la Tromperie ( druj- ), mais que la tr è s Bonne Pens é e (appartienne) au partisan d’A š a’ (Panaino 2004 , p. 119). 11 Life and non-life cannot form the evaluative horizon of an immortal being, by defi nition. The perspective adopted in the G ā th ā s on the ‘primordial choice’ of the two ‘spirits’ is that of the mortals. Nothing is said about the motivation (or inten-tion) of the two immortal beings. In the absence of this knowledge, all talk of an ‘ethical model’ in the sense implied by Nyberg and others is impertinent. What is contained in the primordial ‘Good’ and ‘Evil’? 12 What Kellens ( 1994 , p. 29) says about Duchesne-Guillemin’s, Boyce’s and Mol é ’s handling of the da ē va question in the G ā th ā s is apt: for them ‘la condemnation des *daiu ˆ as est à la fois l’oeuvre de Zara θ u š tra et ant é rieur à lui’. ‘Absolutely interdict-ing’ could well be a move in this game of maintaining the ‘prophet’ in his tradition-ally recognized status (with all its insignia: ‘monotheism’ and ‘dualism’), which has, however, become honorary. 13 In his 1953 book, the readmission of the ahuras , as opposed to the da ē vas , to the pantheon was understood by Duchesne-Guillemin more in terms of the force of a tradition: ‘S’ils [i.e., Indra, Sarva, N ā ha θ ya] ne sont jamais rentr é s en gr â ce, c’est que leur d é ch é ance datait d’avant celle de Mi θ ra, d’avant le temps du proph è te’ (Duchesne-Guillemin 1953 , p. 28). 14 See Dum é zil 1986 , p. 49: ‘la liste des Entit é s appel é es à devenir les Amv š a Spvnta a é t é substitu é e par la th é ologie r é form é e à une liste de dieux des trois fonctions toute voisine de celle qui avait cours chez les futurs Indiens’. 15 See Gonda 1959 , pp. 172–80. 16 One might also ask whether ‘being ignored’ here means something different from ‘being attacked’ (Duchesne-Guillemin 1948 , p. 145) or ‘an intentional, passionate, hostile silence’ (Duchesne-Guillemin 1953 , p. 15). 17 Somewhat different is the reference of ‘ ahuras ’ in 1962: ‘Ahura Mazd ā r é sume en soi toute la souveraint é , toute l’ahurit é . Cependant, on dit encore (Y 30.9) “les ahuras ” pour d é signer, avec lui, A š i, Srao š a, Ra š nu, les Am əš a Sp ə n \u0004 tas, toutes les entit é s’ (204). What is the signifi cance of ‘cependant’ in the last sentence? 18 See also Kellens 2000 , pp. 49–51. 19 See Versnel 1990 , p. 22. 20 Dum é zil’s monotheistic apology ( 1986 , p. 147) is prompted by Gershevitch’s remark ( 1959 , p. 48) on ‘Dum é zil’s theory’ of the substitution by Zarathu š tra of the old gods with the ‘entities’ in his Naissance d’Archange : ‘The prophet was, of course, much too honest to bring in Mi θ ra by the back door, e.g., by substituting him for one of the Am əš a Sp ə n \u0004 tas, or adding him to their number. Such “substitutions” or “adjustments”... as part of the working method of a prophet of Zarathu š tra’s stature and integrity... are unthinkable’. How can Gershevitch be so certain of Zarathu š tra’s psychology? The reason is simple: the ‘prophet’ is his Zarathu š tra. 21 His view was different in Ormazd et Ahriman , where it seems that the disfavour the da ē vas suffer does not have much to do with the rejection by the ahura -cult doctors of the non-sacerdotal gods. Here, the ‘rejection’ of the da ē vas results in no more than, for example, ‘le remplacement d’Indra par Vr ̥ θ ra γ na, lequel est un Indra d é guis é sous l’une de ses é pith è tes constante’ (Duchesne-Guillemin 1953 , p. 24). 22 See Boyce ( 1975 , p. 85): ‘the gradual debasing in Zoroastrian usage of the word da ē va from “god” to “false god” and thence to “demon” led to this becoming the term in Zoroastrianism for the powers of darkness’. A ‘false god’ cannot mean"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Ahura-cult thesis 61here an imaginary god. Rather, a da ē va is a powerful supernatural being whom one should not consider a ‘god’ because he is unethical. 23 See, for example, Boyce 1975 , p. 279: ‘Here [i.e. legends of Zoroaster’s childhood] as elsewhere the prophet’s hostility to d ē v worship is represented as founded solely on what he regarded as the wickedness of the beings who were venerated, and not on the manner of their cult’. 24 ‘And if the men who carried out the raids were wicked, how could the gods whom they worshipped, and who seemingly granted them these cruel successes, be good? And, if not good, how could they have their being from Mazda, himself wholly good? By some such steps, it seems reasonable to suppose, Zoroaster was led to active denunciation of the “Daevas”, with at their head, as the Young Avesta shows, the probably by then great Indra’ (Boyce 1992 , p. 72). Active opposition to cruelty and warlike activity (cattle-raiding?) is the basis of the prophet’s ‘active’ rejection of the ‘gods’. The qualifi cation ‘active’ marks for Boyce the prophet’s specifi c contribution to the ‘ahuric doctrine’. Compare Duchesne-Guillemin’s view of Zoroaster’s opposition to cruelty and promotion of sedentary life: ‘En somme, l’action bonne se r é sume à soigner le b œ uf et à le d é fendre; il s’y ajoute le devoir positif d’ é tendre, aux d é pens du nomade, le domaine des pr é s fertilis é s’ (Duchesne-Guillemin 1953 , p. 12). 25 See Frame 1978 , pp. 125ff.; Parpola 2004 – 2005 , pp. 20ff.; Got ō 2006 . The back-ground of the two A ś vins is perhaps in the institution of chariotry, i.e. ‘the deifi ed chariot team’, as Parpola ( 2004 – 2005 , pp. 6ff.) maintains. 26 Compare S ö hnen 1997 . The reduction of Indra to a war god is based in ‘misunder-standing’ and ‘prejudice’, according to S ö hnen: ‘Indra is nowhere in the R \u0003 gveda in opposition to the ethical ideals as personifi ed in the shape of the A \u0007 dityas’ ( 1997 , p. 236). 27 Boyce herself admits that this is not the only quality of the Vedic Indra. See Boyce 1975 , p. 83. In fact, it is not even the defi ning quality of this Vedic god. Nor is In \u0004 dra opposed to the ‘moral order’. ‘The essential affi nity of In \u0004 dra and Varun \u0004 a , which leads to the formation of the dvandva In \u0004 dr ā -Varun \u0004 ā , consists in the fact that both of them punish those who sin against truth and in particular break their contrac-tual word’ (Thieme 1960 , p. 311). See also Gonda 1975 , pp. 114–22 and Oldenberg 2004 , p. 90, pp. 141–50. Oldenberg’s pages on the term ‘ asura ’ are insightful: ‘This word Asura , which denotes in the later Vedic language almost exclusively a being hostile to gods, appears moreover in the older texts, in fact, predominantly, as an epithet of gods... it is not used for all gods with the same preference; it may be far from the opposite of the word deva , yet by no means synonymous with the word deva ... where it is used for gods, [it] does not simply have the meaning of “god” or “lord”; rather it must have meant for the consciousness of the Vedic poets some-thing like the “owner of a secret power”’ (Oldenberg 2004 , pp. 85–87). 28 Compare Duchesne-Guillemin 1995 , p. 46. 29 On Ap ą m Nap ā t see Oettinger 2009 and Kellens 2012 , pp. 476–81. 30 One should note the circularity of this argument: one must already know who the ahuras are, and that the ahuras are personifi ed abstract concepts, so that the abstractness of a divine name may be used as, at least partial, proof of its bearer’s ahura status. See Kuiper 1976 and compare Hintze 2012 , pp. 67–69. 31 See Narten 1996 , pp. 74–75. 32 This ahura is, in my view, Sraoša. 33 See also Narten 1982 , p. 62. 34 Witzel ( 2001 , pp. 8–9) still believes that the opposition between the asuras and the devas was the main feature of the ‘early IIr. religion’. 35 See Macdonell 1897 , p. 156, and Eliade 1978 , p. 200: ‘In the Vedas the title asura is used as an epithet for any god, even for Dyaus and Indra (the latter is named “Sovereign of the Asuras” in AV 6. 83. 3). In other words, the term asura refers"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"62 Ahura-cult thesisto the specifi c sacred powers belonging to a primordial situation, especially that which existed before the organization of the world. The young gods, the Devas, did not fail to take over these sacred powers; this is why they enjoy the epithet asura ’. 36 See Hale 1986 , pp. 169–71: ‘The distribution of the words d ā sa- , d á syu- , and á sura- in the “demonic” sense is also quite remarkable. The texts in which the last of these three appears are almost devoid of the fi rst two. It looks very much as if á sura- in its new meaning replaced the other two terms... It should be noted how similar the confl ict of gods and asuras is to the confl ict of the Aryans and the dasyus. In both cases the confl ict seems to arise because the asuras or dasyus have something which the gods or Aryans want’. See Bailey 1959 , pp. 107ff. Compare Parpola 1997 . Parpola maintains the D ā sas were the ancestors of the Sakas, and associates them with the Bronze Age archaeological cultures of Bactria and Margiana such as Gonur-Tepe. 37 See Narten 1996 , p. 68. 38 Compare Heesterman’s analysis ( 1993 , pp. 126–37) of the sacrifi cial dynamics of the ś rauta fi res and the emergence of the ś rauta ritual. ‘The divide between the two types of sacrifi ce, then, is not the one between vegetal and blood sacrifi ce but that between the (at least in principle) fi xed ś ā l ā , the hall where the lordly asuras stayed, and the mobile laager of the soma d ī ks \u0004 ita moving about, like the devas , “on wheels” with his carts and cattle’ (Heesterman 1993 , p. 132). The magnate of the hall ‘should be “well-to-do ( pus \u0004 t \f a ) like an asura ”. Incidentally, this may also throw light on the br ā hman \u0004 as’ statement that he who removes the fi re... scatters sacrifi ce and cattle or is even guilty of manslaughter. Rather than terminate a sac-rifi cial fi re – what is regularly done at the end of a sacrifi ce – it suggests the forcible removal of the wealthy magnate’s fi re and cattle. Being “like an asura ”, the latter is not likely to give in without a fi ght that may well end in manslaughter. Here we have come full circle and are back again with the asura -like magnate “sitting in his ś ā l ā ” and challenged on his place of sacrifi ce by the “gods [ devas ] driving about on wheels” who are after his fi re and cattle’ (Heesterman 1993 , p. 137). 39 And further: ‘Die Da ē vas waren in Kern zweifellos G ö tter des indoiranischen Pantheons, die in Iran weiterhin verehrt wurden’ (Narten 1996 , p. 82). Narten her-self was a proponent of the ahura -cult thesis (cf. Narten 1982 , p. 62). The existence of an ahura cult in ancient Iran was a reasonable assumption consistent with the idea, inferred from the supposed existence of a Vedic asura class, that there must have been such a class of gods in Indo-Iranian times, which was then thought to stand in the background of ‘Zarathu š tra’s reform’ (cf. Narten 1996 , p. 67). 40 No ‘moral’ impulse understood in the modern deontological sense (e.g. subject-ing the maxim of an action to the test of universalizability, as in Kantian ethics), underlies any ancient religious thought.

The word asura never designates a class of deities in the Veda; and no god given the title asura (‘lord’) ever becomes a demon (Burrow 1973 , pp. 127–29). Nonetheless, Burrow maintains that the repudiation of the da ē vas , as a fact of the ‘religious history of Iran’, 2 must be placed in the context of a hostile confrontation with the Indo-Aryan worshippers of the devas . Thus the religious dimension of the ethnic confl ict between Iranians and Indians should not be imagined in the common Indo-Iranian period, where the religious-historical animosity of the two ‘classes’ of gods is supposed to have given rise to antagonistic grouping of the human proponents of each, forming eventually the Iranian and Indian branches, but in the period, following the settlement of the Indo-Aryans across the northern Iranian plateau from the north-west of the Indian subcontinent to the north-west of Iran, when immigrating Iranian tribes were driving south in stages from Central Asia along the plains east of the Caspian and taking control of the hitherto Indo-Aryan territories. The basics of the account are simple. Although becoming politically ascendant in the territory that would eventually take its name from their self-designation, the recently settled Iranians here and there accepted the gods of the culturally more advanced Indo-Aryans into their pantheon. The key idea is that the da ē vas were never Iranian gods, but borrowed, especially by some eastern Iranian princes, for some period before the appearance of Zarathu š tra, ‘uncompromisingly condemned’ by the latter and fi nally turned into demons by his epigones. The thesis of the non-Iranian origins of the da ē vas allows one, according to Burrow, to account for the post-G ā thic membership of the Zoroastrian pantheon, whose list, as given in the Ya š ts and other places, Burrow ( 1973 , p. 130) assumes to be complete. Since there is no da ē va among the gods of the Iranian pantheon, there would be no contradiction between Zarathu š tra’s uncompromising repudiation of the da ē vas and the restoration of the old Iranian gods to the pantheon: these were never condemned by Zarathu š tra."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"66 Ethno-historical thesisBurrow thus explains the nature of the Zoroastrian rejection of the da ē vas : they are alien gods of a hostile people, hence nefarious. The rare evidence of a da ē va cult among Iranians (e.g. the Sogdian theophoric names containing the word da ē va 3 ) can be understood as the remnants of a borrowed alien cult (Burrow 1973 , p. 134). On the other hand, the ‘Iranian word for “god” was not daiva- but baga- . This can safely be assumed on the strength of the distri-bution of the word in the various Iranian languages: OPers. baga- , Av. baγa- , Sogd. BG- , etc.’ (Burrow 1973 , p. 130). The antiquity of the term as a divine appellation is shown by its presence in the Slavonic (OSl. bogu ̌ ‘god’), which is not ‘considered a loanword from Iranian’, proving its thoroughgoing inte-gration. If this word was replaced in the later Avestan literature by the word yazata , it was in order to signal the subordinate status of the old gods vis- à -vis Ahura Mazd ā . Kellens’ dismissal of Burrow’s ‘hypothesis’ as ‘une pure intrigue historique’ (Kellens 2006 , p. 146) is unfair. The objections that Kellens raises against Burrow’s account are either irrelevant or relative to one’s interpretive frame. The question, which Kellens rightly puts to all interpretations of the G ā th ā s that combine the ahura -cult thesis with monotheism – ‘why would Zarathu š tra, in order to affi rm monotheism, revile the da ē vas , long since demonized, instead of the ahuras of the national polytheism?’ (Kellens 2006 , p. 107) – would miss its mark here since Burrow does not claim that G ā thic theology is monotheistic. In fact, he explicitly says that Zarathu š tra never condemned the gods of the Iranian pantheon. Whether this is an acceptable interpretation of the G ā th ā s is not at issue here. The names of the da ē vas mentioned in the V ī d ē vd ā d (Indra, Saurva and N ā ŋ hai θ ya), Kellens says, ‘sont ceux de d é mons iraniens correspondant à des dieux indiens’ (Kellens 2006 , p. 107). Burrow does not deny that these names show genuine Iranian phonetic features, but he thinks that the conclusion Kellens wants to draw from this linguistic evi-dence – that they cannot be Indo-Aryan gods – does not necessarily follow. According to Burrow, these were among the principal gods that Indo-Aryans worshipped in eastern Iran when Iranians took political control of this area (Burrow 1973 , p. 128), and the typically Iranian development of the sibilants is due to the change in the language of the Indo-Aryans living in this area, ‘similar to that in Iranian’ (Burrow 1973 , p. 132). The relatively late evidence of da ē va worship (i.e. Xerxes’ inscription or the Sogdian theophoric names) is not troublesome for Burrow’s account. Whether da ē va worship indicates an Indo-Aryan tradition continued by the descendant Indo-Aryan societies (Burrow 1973 , p. 136) or is an Iranian cult adopted from Indo-Aryan popula-tions settled in the whole northern Iranian plateau and areas to the north-east even beyond the Oxus – either way, Burrow’s account can accommodate the da ē va -cult evidence. The remaining objection from Kellens’ list is too impres-sionistic to be compelling: ‘L’ensemble du domaine linguistique iranien sem-ble avoir é prouv é des diffi cult é s à dire “dieu”, m ê me si baga est largement r é pandu. Tout se passe comme si la d é ch é ance du mot daiva avait cr éé une case vide dans la titulature divine’ (Kellens 2006 , p. 107). Kellens himself"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Ethno-historical thesis 67thought in 1994 that the word baga was indeed the Iranian word for god, and he even believed he found it in the G ā th ā s as one of the exponents, along with Mazd ā , the ‘entities’ and the da ē vas , of the han \u0004 t , ‘being’, supposedly the word for divinity (Kellens 1994 , p. 117). The geographic and chronological extension of the attestation of baga makes it diffi cult not to think that this word was in some way the Iranian term for god. The Avestan exceptionalism would then have to be explained as a doctrinal intervention, although baga is perhaps attested once with the meaning god in the G ā th ā s, in the enigmatic passage (Y 32.8), which describes the ‘wrongs’ that presumably precipitated Yima’s downfall. In any case, the idea that in general Iranians had diffi culties with how to say ‘god’ does not seem reasonable to me. Even more problem-atic is to want to ground this supposed diffi culty in the malaise created by the ‘d é ch é ance’ (decline) of the word da ē va , the erstwhile term for god. The view that the repudiation of this or that god or even a whole pantheon should lead to the denigration of the divine appellation itself is, at best, a hypothesis in need of proof. I cannot think of a single historical instance that would make it credible. If Kellens’ objections by and large miss their target, is Burrow’s thesis acceptable? In other words, are the key claims, namely that the da ē vas were never Iranian gods and that the word da ē va never designated divinity in any Iranian language, valid? These claims certainly fi nd a comfortable place in Burrow’s account of ‘historical interactions’ between the Indo-Aryan and Iranian populations from around the middle of the second millennium BC to the Achaemenid times, but this account cannot establish their validity. As far as I can see, Burrow gives two reasons for his claim that the da ē vas were not Iranian but only ever Indo-Aryan gods. One is that their attested respective pantheons have hardly any god in common and certainly do not share any ‘important’ god (Burrow 1973 , p. 131). The qualifi cation ‘important’, I sup-pose, is a matter of interpretation, but one can legitimately question whether deities like Haoma and Vayu, beside minor ones, are not ‘important’. Were these deities, who kept their status in both pantheons, Indo-Iranian gods? If so, the old problem of the selection criteria for the membership of the Avestan pantheon returns, not to mention the added question of the reason for the survival of some but not all the ancient gods as common deities. The whole issue is thereby shifted back in time, i.e. prior to Zarathu š tra. The prob-lem is especially acute with respect to Mitra/Mi θ ra. Burrow himself acknow-ledges it, but the way he sets about resolving it is not really satisfactory: ‘this god is so much more important in the Iranian scheme of things than in the Vedic (and presumably Proto-Indoaryan), that the correspondence could be ignored’ (Burrow 1973 , p. 131). That Mi θ ra was ‘so much more’ important for the Iranians than Mitra was for the Indo-Aryans, even if true, does not mean that Mitra was not important for the latter, which is obviously incor-rect, especially in view of his close association with Varun \u0004 a. Mitra is, after all, one of the deities mentioned in the Mitanni treaty, however one cares to interpret the list. In Burrow’s account, if the Indo-Aryan word for ‘god’ was"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"68 Ethno-historical thesisadopted by the Iranians as the term for harmful deities and then demons, it was because ‘it could easily appear to the Iranians and to Zoroaster that the da ē vas , taken as a whole, were a different set of gods from their own’ (Burrow 1973 , p. 131). But vilifying the da ē vas (the Indo-Aryan gods) meant reviling the ‘Iranian gods’ that happened to hold the membership of both pantheons. This could not have been lost on religious experts. Could one imagine such a casual attitude (‘taken as a whole’) in a priest with respect to so grave an issue as blasphemy? History also testifi es against the plausibility of the thesis that the Iranians vilifi ed the gods of their enemy, 4 which is, generally speaking, out of place in the ancient world in any case, save in the Abrahamic religions. 5 Burrow maintains that the word da ē va is a loanword from Indo-Aryan that was adopted by the ‘less developed’ Iranians once they took over the territory already settled by the Indo-Aryans: ‘the Iranian princes in this area respected the old religion and its representatives, and to a large extent adopted those cults’ (Burrow 1973 , p. 131). The plausible reconstructed picture does not prove that da ē va is a loanword but only accommodates this claim. How to prove that the word da ē va is a loanword? Burrow uses the argument that Gray ( 1927 ) had made in his article on lexical dualism in the Avesta: for a good number of things Avestan has two (or more) terms, one with a positive value (‘Ahurian’) and the other with a negative value (‘Daevian’). A ‘signifi cant pat-tern emerges’ when the two vocabularies are examined from an etymological perspective: ‘the “ahurian” words as a general rule are the ones that have the widest representation throughout the Iranian languages, while the “dae-vian” words have in many cases either no other cognates in Iranian, or are represented only in a few marginal dialects’ (Burrow 1973 , p. 132). Such is the conclusion of Gray’s study according to Burrow, who extends it in the direction of his own thesis: ‘it is possible’ that a certain number of Indo-Aryan words ‘formed a starting point’ for the ‘da ē vian vocabulary’ (Burrow 1973 , p. 133). He mentions the ‘da ē vian’ words karəna- , aš(i)- , hunu- , gah- and gərəδa- , which have Vedic cognates. These indicate (Burrow: ‘there is no doubt’) that the ‘nucleus’ (Burrow 1973 , p. 133) of the da ē vian vocabulary consists of Indo-Aryan loanwords, to which da ē va itself may be added, all of which have a negative value, as might be expected in view of their provenance in a hostile culture. Burrow’s rendition of Gray’s conclusions is misleading, however. The ‘sig-nifi cant pattern’ that emerges from Gray’s study is not that of the Avestan terms which are solidly Iranian vs. those which are isolated or marginal in Iranian languages and have Vedic cognates, but rather that of the Avestan words which have Modern Iranian cognates vs. those that are archaic, i.e. have only Indo-European cognates. A ‘survey of the geographical distribu-tion of the words under consideration seems to justify the conclusion that in the majority of cases the Ahurian terms fi nd cognates in several Modern Iranian dialects, and often outside Iran as well; the Da ē vian words, on the other hand... fi nd cognates only outside the Modern Iranian area, except for a few in the Pamir dialects’ (Gray 1927 , p. 434). In other words, the ‘Ahurian’"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Ethno-historical thesis 69Avestan terms generally have an Iranian future while the ‘Da ē vian’ ones show at best a marginal Iranian existence and are linguistically archaic. One must also note that many ‘Ahurian’ terms do have Vedic cognates: verbal roots like ai , gam , č ar , tak , θβ ar ə s , zan , mru ; and nouns like ā h- , manao θ r ī - , zasta- , etc. 6 One could very well appeal to the wide distribution of the word da ē va in the sense of demon in Iranian languages and claim that the reason for the obso-lescence of the ‘Da ē vian’ terms is precisely their compromised status. One can even accept all the premises of Burrow’s picture but turn the terms of the argument around: ‘archaic’ terms (i.e. understandable but more or less defunct among eastern Iranians) were initially harvested by the Zoroastrian priests from Indo-Aryan to represent ‘Da ē vian’ phenomena for the purpose of clearly marking off these phenomena in (the sacred) language, etc. This account fi ts as well as Burrow’s own with his thesis of the Indo-Aryan nucleus of the Da ē vian vocabulary. In my mind, what fi nally makes Burrow’s thesis of the purely Indo-Aryan origins of the da ē vas and the word da ē va unacceptable is the lack of all textual evidence of hostile confrontations between the arriving Iranians and the settled Indo-Aryans and the association of these supposed confrontations with the con-demnation of the da ē vas . I do not deny that this scenario is plausible, but were it the reason behind the Zoroastrian condemnation of the da ē vas , would it not somehow be refl ected in the G ā th ā s? Burrow tries to forestall this objection by claiming that the ethnic confl ict was exhaustively expressed in religious terms, and since both Iranians and Indo-Aryans called themselves ‘Aryan’, the Avesta had no distinctive term to refer to the Indo-Aryans. 7 The Avesta (Yt 13.143–44) uses ethnic terms to refer to various apparently Iranian peoples that converted to Zoroastrianism: Aryan, Tu \u0006 rian, D ā hian, S ā nian (probably eastern Saka peoples) and Sarmian (probably Sarmatians). Are we to assume that there was no dia-lectal or tribal differentiation among the Indo-Aryans, and they all referred to themselves as ‘Aryan’ tout court ? 8 Further, Vedic poets had no trouble referring to ‘enemy Aryans’ beside the D ā sas and Dasyus: why suppose it for the Avestan composers? Finally, the idea that one should be at a loss to refer to a hostile people because the latter refers to itself with the same ethnic term as one’s own people – this idea simply beggars the imagination. The whole religious edifi ce is supposed to be built on the basis of this ethnic hostility; nonetheless, one cannot point to this basis, express it in one’s sacred language, because of the identity of the ethnic terms of self-reference. As for the idea of an exclusively religious expression of the enmity: it is just an ad hoc postulation unless one can put for-ward the reason behind it, which is not to be found in Burrow’s account. The hypothesis of the suppression of the ethnic roots of Zoroastrian dualism or, at any rate, of the G ā thic condemnation of the da ē vas , is all the more unacceptable as the Avesta does not seem to have any problem expressing an ethnic (‘Aryan’) self-affi rmation. Whatever might have been the dynamics of the interaction between Indo-Aryan ethnicity and the cult of the da ē vas among Iranians, the reduction of the latter to the former (as to its ‘origins’), that is to say, the ‘explan-ation’ of the latter in terms of the former, is a petitio principii ."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"70 Ethno-historical thesis Notes 1 Compare Parpola 2002 , p. 73, pp. 85–91.

As far as the history of the word asura- in Sanskrit is concerned, what he said is perfectly true, but he was wrong about the da ē vas since those principal da ē vas mentioned above (i.e., Indra and N ā satya from the Mitanni treaty) are undoubtedly ancient gods who have been turned into demons’ (Burrow 1973 , pp. 128–29). 3 See Henning 1965 , pp. 253–54, and further in the next chapter . 4 See Briant 2002 passim . 5 See, e.g. Assmann 2006 , pp. 55–62 and Sloterdijk 2009 . 6 From 28 Ahurian terms in Gray’s survey, 18 are ‘common in Iranian’ and only 3 ‘archaic’, while only 4 out of 23 Da ē vian terms are ‘common in Iranian’ and 16 ‘archaic’ (Gray 1929 , p. 440). 7 ‘The Avesta has no ethnic term to denote the Proto-Indoaryans, which is not sur-prising since both they and the Iranians called themselves Aryans and spoke closely related languages.

"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 4 Ritualistic thesis Jean Kellens has developed a ritualist perspective on the G ā thic condemnation of the da ē vas . Although, as we presently see, he has signifi cantly changed his view of the matter twice, his general approach has remained more or less the same. This approach is in turn based in Kellens’ theory of Mazdaism (or Zoroastrianism), which has two distinct features. First, he rejects the historicity of Zarathu š tra and the ‘revolutionary’ nature of Zoroastrianism (which he equates with ‘prophetic’ apparently understood in the Biblical sense). Kellens’ position is the direct opposite to that of Nyberg, who reads the G ā th ā s as a kind biographical record of Zarathu š tra’s activities. Je ne vois dans les textes avestiques anciens ou r é cents aucune innov-ation doctrinale assez consid é rable pour imposer l’id é e qu’une interven-tion proph é tique a fait d é vier l’ é volution naturelle et r é guli è re du syst è me religieux depuis les temps indo-iraniens... Accepter ou d é nier l’existence historique de Zarathushtra conduit inexorablement à construire deux mod è les explicatifs du zoroastrisme radicalement diff é rents. (Kellens 2001 , pp. 171–72) The denial of the historicity of Zarathu š tra, on the one hand, and the essential affi nity of Mazdaean and Vedic religious systems, on the other, are logically interdependent, according to Kellens. Either one categorizes Zoroastrianism as a prophetic religion, in which case it needs a ‘prophet’; or one interprets it as a ‘natural and regular evolution’ of the Indo-Iranian sys-tem and, accordingly, Zarathu š tra becomes a ‘mythic’ fi gure. 1 Second, Kellens views the G ā th ā s as a purely liturgical text, that is, a text composed for the purpose of ritual recitation and addressed to divinities. In an article he wrote with Pirart, they put it in the following way. D’une mani è re g é n é rale, nous sommes surpris de la r é sistance que ren-contre la d é fi nition des G â th â s comme texte liturgique... L’un d’entre nous (i.e. Kellens) a parl é de rituel sp é culatif... En dissertant sur le rituel, les G â th â s en d é voilent le fondament sp é culatif et disent beaucoup de choses qui ne sont pas d’ordre strictement rituel. Ce qui, pour nous, n’est"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"72 Ritualistic thesispas n é gociable, c’est que les G â th â s sont des textes compos é es pour servir de r é citatif à une c é r é monie liturgique et non des textes doctrinaux qui ont fi ni servir de r é citatif liturgique. (Kellens and Pirart 1997 , pp. 64–65 n. 62) 2 Kellens does not merely think that the G ā th ā s had a ceremonial function. As far as we can tell, all archaic Indo-European poetry consisted of oral com-positions that were performed in different types of festivals. 3 But ‘ceremony’ is not the sense in which Kellens understands the postulated G ā thic ritual. The G ā th ā s must be understood in the horizon of the Vedic type of sacri-fi cial hymns, oral compositions offered to specifi c deities, celebrating their powers and achievements, and through recalling these, empowering the gods, contributing to the cosmic order, and procuring rewards for the sacrifi cer. 4 Nonetheless, according to Kellens, the G ā th ā s are more than just eulogies to divinities. They contain ‘a refl ection on the ritual and on the human con-duct in the frame of the ritual’ (Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 17). The poet ‘speculates’ about the structure and powers of ritual and about the proper ritual conduct that ensures the proper functioning of the ritual. All seemingly ordinary words such as ‘existence’ or ‘power’ should be understood as terms referring to the ritual sphere. The ritual function of the G ā th ā s strictly deter-mines not just their themes but also their concepts and metaphors. 5 Ritual is the universal reference of the motifs present in the G ā th ā s. 6 In the Introduction to his and Pirart’s edition of the Old Avestan texts (Kellens and Pirart 1988 ), Kellens maintains that the only time (in Y 43.5–15, according to them) Zarathu š tra appears in the fi rst person in the G ā th ā s he has the role of ‘l’inspirateur du rituel g ā thique. Il fait, en repr é santant de sa commun-aut é , le choix de l’ é tat d’esprit qui est le fondement du bon rituel... il ensei-gne le principe de ce bon rituel’ (Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 21). In the same way, the fault with which the ‘G ā thic circle’ reproaches the da ē vas has to do with the wrongfulness ( a ē nah- ) of the ritual that these ancient gods carelessly ‘accept’ (Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 31; cf. Humbach 1957 ). The ‘wrongful-ness’ of the ritual, according to Kellens, should be understood as its technical incorrectness. The da ē vas are not foreign gods for G ā thic society but deities it worshipped in its past. 7 In fact, at the time the G ā thic circle introduces its ‘religious innovation’ there are Mazdaean groups who still make offer-ings to these ‘traditional gods of the Indo-Iranian pantheon’ (Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 30). ‘To some extent, they are more of a victim than a villain’ since, confused by the ‘illusion that comes over them’, they ‘do not properly distinguish between the good and the bad state of mind that determine in the faithful the choice of sacrifi cial conduct’ (Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 31). The historical reality of the da ē vas is affi rmed; they are rebuked because they indiscriminately accept all and any sacrifi ce offered to them.

Les da ē uua ont encore une place dans l’univers divin. (Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 31) The da ē vas are still gods, if already on their way to being replaced by the specifi cally G ā thic gods ‘issus de l’all é gorie’ (Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 31). In their commentary to the G ā thic texts, Kellens and Pirart ( 1991 , p. 78) fi nd further extenuating circumstances for the failure of the da ē vas . These ‘trad-itional gods’ are ‘victimes d’une illusion qui provient du fait que les deux é tats d’esprit sont indistincts au niveau de la pens é e et de la parole’. The refer-ence to the ‘indistinctness’ of the ‘two states of mind’ at the level of thought and speech comes from Kellens and Pirart’s interpretation of Y 30.3, the so-called Twins stanza. According to them, this stanza has nothing to do with myth but is an analysis of the ‘psychology’ of ritual conduct. 8 Apparently, it is as important for the gods as it is for mortals to make a distinction between the two states of mind in which the sacrifi cial offering is made to them. The rebuke given to the da ē vas in the G ā th ā s has to do with their carelessness or lack of insight. I should like to quote in full the passage where Kellens and Pirart discuss this whole affair, a discussion that closes with a signifi cant admission of incomprehension. Ce qui s’y trouve en germe, ce n’est pas le dualisme (sinon d’une mani è re tr è s lointaine), mais une psychologie, qui, ne concevant encore ‘l’existence de la pens é e’ que comme manifestation de l’activit é rituelle, s’interroge sur le processus cach é par lequel l’homme fait le choix d’une conduite, qui ne devient perceptible et ne r é v è le son 9 caract è re positif ou n é gatif qu’au moment o ù elle se traduit en acte. Elle affi rme que le moteur initial de ce processus est le mainiiu . Facult é critique pour les hommes, qu’il partage en deux camps, il l’est aussi pour les dieux. Leur puissance est mise à l’ é preuve d’un redoutable exercice de clairvoyance. Les da ē uua é chouent: le mainiiu est donc à l’origine de ce clivage entre les dieux qui constitue la grande question des G ā θ ā . 10 Pouquoi fallait-il, dans le syst è me g â thique, mettre aux c ô t é s des hommes qui font le choix d’un mauvais rituel, des dieux qui l’aaceptent? Il est d’autant plus diffi cile de r é pondre à cette question que l’explication donn é e à la d é faillance divine, l’illusion, para î t é trangement courte. (Kellens and Pirart 1991 , p. 44) The fault of the da ē vas must have to do with ritual – as a matter of prin-ciple – so Kellens and Pirart postulate a woefully incorrect ritual practice as the grounds of the rebuke levelled at the ‘traditional’ gods by the ‘G ā thic cir-cle’. One would expect that once the ‘postulate’ has led to an impasse it should be abandoned. Instead, Kellens and Pirart put the puzzling question their postulate has created to the text, which seems to them ‘strangely’ inadequate"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"74 Ritualistic thesisin providing an answer: why blame the gods for the mortals’ choice of inappro-priate ritual? It seems that not only mortals but also gods have to be adepts of ritual practice, and in particular, they, too, have to be able to see into the ‘hidden process’ of ritual, into its ‘psychological’ grounds, and distinguish therein the right ‘state of mind’ from the wrong one. It is not clear why the gods have to do this and, more importantly, what constitutes the ‘wrong state of mind’. What does characterize the rightness of the right state of mind, and what the wrongness of the wrong state of mind? Kellens and Pirart can give only a tautological answer to this question. In the event, the ‘traditional’ gods fail to distinguish between the right and wrong states of mind, whatever these may be, as they fall victim to an ‘illusion’. As already mentioned, for Kellens and Pirart, the ‘illusion’ has to do with the ‘fact that the two (ritual) states of mind are indistinct at the levels of thought and speech’ (Kellens and Pirart 1991 , p. 78). This conception of the nature of the ‘fault’ com-mitted by the da ē vas corresponds to a theoretical exigency that determines Kellens’ position: the rejection of the ‘moralistic’ approach to the G ā th ā s and to the repudiation of the da ē vas in particular. Generally speaking, one can only agree with Kellens’ rejection of this approach, taken by most scholars of the fi eld, which is ultimately an automatic assimilation of the G ā thic ideas to stereotyped Biblical images and modern humanistic sentiments. But Kellens’ reduction of all G ā thic ideas (e.g. fault of the da ē vas ) to matters of ritual leads to unacceptable conclusions. Kellens and Pirart understand the failure in question as the discredited gods’ lack of insight, the inability of the da ē vas to perceive the psychological grounds of ritual practice. It is not a moral issue and has nothing to do with a choice between good and evil. It is not that these ‘gods’ make the ‘wrong’ choice, but being unable to have an insight into the ‘hidden processes’ of rit-ual conduct, they cannot tell the difference between the correct and incorrect ritual. Since, according to the two scholars, the ‘positive or negative character’ of the ritual choice is only ‘revealed’ at the level of ‘gesture’ (‘acte’), would one have to conclude that the ritual offered to them does not involve gesture? Can there be a ritual with no ‘gesture’? If not, in what sense should one under-stand the da ē vas ’ failure to distinguish between correct and incorrect ritual, since the ‘gestures’ should allow them to inform themselves about its ‘positive or negative character’? 11 Or, if one places the emphasis on the fact that some gods are apparently capable of making the distinction while the da ē vas are not, one may conclude that the latter fail to see through the gesture to the thought or intention that animates it, to interpret correctly the gesture and perceive the intention motivating it. It is the ritual intention (again, whatever this may mean) that fi nally makes one type of ritual acceptable and the other abhorrent. It is a matter of hermeneutic failure on the part of the da ē vas . I have already pointed to Kellens and Pirart’s own admission of the appar-ent absurdity: why indeed should the worshipper’s fault be visited on the gods with such unforgiving hostility? This is the fi rst diffi culty. The second, per-haps more important, problem in their account is that we simply have no"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Ritualistic thesis 75idea what makes a ritual choice either correct or incorrect. These two diffi cul-ties in effect make their theory amount to postulating an unknowable factor in order to explain the explanandum in an incomprehensible way. Finally, the whole hermeneutic construction is specious. The difference of ‘choice’ is, according to their account, registered on the level of ritual practice, 12 which allows an evaluation of the positive or negative character of the choice. But the idea that ritual gesture is in some sense more positive (more real) than rit-ual thought or ritual speech is illusory. As their paraphrase of Y 30.3, given above, shows, they treat ritual as if it were a pragmatic (or mundane) action whose evaluation depends on the ascertainment of the intention behind it. At the deepest and most hidden level (‘stade’) lies the intention or thought, least amenable to perception, hence least positive. There is, then, the level of speech, where the intention is embodied in words, e.g. given the materiality of public statement and the security of public scrutiny, but still liable to manipu-lation, disavowal of consequences, disclaimer of being misunderstood, etc. At the most manifest level is the positive act, where the intention is fi nally revealed and becomes a ‘reality’, as real and solid as the world. It is only at this level that one can ‘really’ know what to make of the thought that moti-vated the new constituent, however tiny, of the world. Now, whether or not this scheme is generally realistic or valuable, it is inappropriate for the ritual situation. Ritual speech is no less manifest or real than ritual gesture. Ritual thought is as perceivable (for its divine interlocutors) as ritual speech and ges-ture. Ritual ‘choice’ is not something hidden, a psychic intention that always holds itself back in some supposed interiority from where it organizes the ‘ritual conduct’. In short, there is no such thing as the ‘psychology of ritual activity’ in the sense that Kellens and Pirart intend it. Perhaps in part because of these diffi culties, Kellens abandoned this scheme a few years later. In Le panth é on de l’Avesta ancien and other publications of the 1990s, Kellens makes his ritualist understanding of the G ā th ā s more thoroughgoing. The ritual function semantically stamps virtually all G ā thic concepts. If the G ā th ā s are liturgical compositions, all the concepts there must be technical terms of ritual. 13 In Le panth é on Kellens rejects the historical reality of the da ē vas : they are not ‘traditional gods’ but merely the ‘accursed part’ in the ritual rhetoric of the G ā th ā s: ‘il ne fait aucun doute que le corps des da ē uuas constitue la part maudite du panth é on’ ( 1994b , p. 82). On the one hand, he discounts the few extant historical facts that may point to an ancient Iranian da ē va cult ( 1994b , pp. 15–17, p. 125). Two of these in particular are signifi cant and their dismissal is in my mind unacceptable. In his article ‘A Sogdian God’ ( 1965 ) Henning had drawn attention to two Sogdian personal names that bear the word δ yw (i.e. da ē va ), which in all probability proves that ‘the Da ē vas maintained themselves as divinities, at least in a part of Sogdiane’ (Henning 1965 , p. 253). One, a king’s name, is found in the Mugh documents: Δ ē w ā š t ī č meaning something like ‘divine’. The second is the name of a prince of a territory known in the ninth century as Usru \u0006 š ana, immediately north of the mountainous regions along the upper course of Zarafshan river, who served"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"76 Ritualistic thesisas a general in the Khalif ’s army: Abu’l-Sa ǰ D ī wd ā d b. D ī wdast. His grand-son too bore the name D ī wd ā d. The word means ‘(having) god (as) creator’ (Henning 1965 , p. 254). Kellens rejects them as evidence of da ē va worship by an Iranian people because of their paucity, lateness and marginal provenance: ‘la disproportion est é vidente entre l’importance du fait et l’inconsistance des donn é es qui en t é moignent’, and concludes: ‘Il n’y a aucune attestation s û re, dans les langues iraniennes, d’un mot original * daiu ˆ a- signifi ant “dieu”’ (Kellens 1994b , p. 17). But this last statement is incorrect; and the existence of a solid attestation of a da ē va cult among at least some Iranian peoples places the Sogdian names in a different light. In one of his inscriptions, the Achaemenid king Xerxes denounces the worship of the ‘daiva’ and recounts one of his campaigns against their cult. None of the objections that Kellens raises against the Sogdian onomastic evidence can be raised against Xerxes’ inscription, XPh 35–41: a n tar ait ā dahy ā va ā ha t yad ā tiya paruvam daiv ā ayadiya n pas ā va va š n ā A h uramazdah ā adam avam daivad ā nam viyakanam ut ā patiyazbayam daiv ā m ā yadiyai š a n yad ā y ā paruvam daiv ā ayadiya n avad ā adam A h uramazd ā m ayadaiy art ā c ā brazmaniy 14 in these countries there was (a place) where previously the da ē vas were worshipped. Subsequently, in accordance with the will of Ahura Mazd ā , I destroyed that da ē va -sanctuary and made the (religious?) declaration: ‘the da ē vas may not be worshipped!’ Where previously the da ē vas were worshipped, there I worshipped Ahura Mazd ā (with holy twigs?). Those who maintain that Xerxes’ daiv ā are not the da ē vas , the ancient Iranian gods, must bear the burden of proof. 15 In Le panth é on Kellens argues that in the inscription Xerxes is either aiming at a foreign cult, or ‘more probably’ the king ‘pratique l’amalgame dans le cadre d’une pol é mique mineure interne au mazd é isme et qui concerne le rituel, 16 é tant donn é que c’est l’acte d é fi ni par yad qui est en cause’ (Kellens 1994b , p. 125). Both of these scenarios are improbable. If the king were aiming at a ‘culte é tranger’ he would have called their gods by their proper names. As for the second one, it is just the extension of Kellens’ view of the status of the G ā thic da ē vas to the Old Persian daivas . Whether or not this view is justifi ed in the case of the G ā thic da ē vas (I will come back to this below), it cannot be automatically applied to a royal pronouncement. Why, indeed, does a ‘pol é mique mineure interne au mazd é isme’ deserve the ‘honor’ of a royal pronouncement while the elimination of a ‘culte “pa ï en” r é siduel n’aurait probablement pas m é rit é les honneurs de l’ é pigraphie offi cielle et l’envoi de multiples duplicata’ (Kellens 1994b , p. 125)? 17 We have to accept the testimony of the data as they appear until sound arguments to the contrary are at hand.

I give the argument in full: Si les da ē uuas ont é t é les dieux traditionnels de l’Iran pr é zoroastrien, le mouvement de r é action polyth é iste que l’on veut bien reconna î tre dans l’Avesta r é cent para î t é trangement fond é sur un double processus: r é ha-bilitation des divinit é s r é pudi é es par Zara θ u š tra d’une part, conserva-tion, voire durcissement, de l’id é ologie anti-da ē uua d’autre part. Il est bien diffi cile de se repr é senter comment a pu se produire une telle fracture entre les individus divins et le titre qui les a d é fi nis. (Kellens 1994b , p. 15) How could the Iranian divine appellation da ē va become an accursed desig-nation while some of the condemned gods are admitted back into the (new) pantheon? One must concede that prima facie this is a cogent argument if G ā thic da ē va means god in general. It is in particular devastating for the monotheistic interpretation of G ā thic religious thought. Zarathu š tra repu-diates as G ö tzen or Teufel the ancient Iranian ‘gods’ but, soon after, some of these gods who are not alien to the spirit of the Zoroastrian reform are rehabilitated while the divine appellation itself is demonized; and, taxing our imagination further, for one reason or another this new polytheistic religion thinks of itself as following the teachings of the founding prophet although it gives up his central message: monotheism. 18 If, however, G ā thic da ē va does not mean god tout court but perhaps a special kind of divinity, Kellens’ objection loses its force. The G ā th ā s, in other words, denounce not the ‘gods’ in general but the da ē vas for a specifi c reason, namely that these gods have failed to per-form their (traditional) function. 19 I leave the matter for the next chapters. The second argument Kellens gives against the reality of the da ē vas is the seemingly chaotic nature of the ensuing ‘rehabilitation’ process. Ceux qui consid è rent la d é monisation de tous les dieux traditionnels comme l’acte fondateur du monoth é isme zoroastrien se trouvent par l à -m ê me confront é s à une rude t â che.

(Kellens 1994b , pp. 19–20) Again, while his objection hits home against the monotheistic interpret-ation of the G ā th ā s, it becomes questionable, to say the least, in the frame mentioned above. 20 It is true that the G ā th ā s are silent about the gods of the Young Avestan pantheon – but what does this silence mean? That they are rejected? Not necessarily: most Vedic hymns are addressed to specifi c"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"78 Ritualistic thesisgods – could we conclude that other Vedic gods are thereby denounced? We do not as yet have a clear idea of what the central concerns of the G ā th ā s are; and we do not know whether in the light of these the silence would be under-standable in ways other than rejection. It is thus pointless to speculate about the meaning of the silence, whether it is hostile or not. Kellens points out two relevant facts. The divine appellation most extensively attested in the Iranian languages from the sixth century onwards is * baga- ‘provider’. But this is not the case in the extant Avestan texts, where its few occurrences do not seem to have the general sense of deity (see Kellens 1994b , p. 24). Its absence in the general sense is, according to Kellens, diffi cult to understand, which could mean either that the Avesta ‘is unaware of it’ or, ‘more probably’, ‘refuses to use it’ (Kellens 1994b , p. 25). He asserts that this refusal could be due either to its ‘too general and therefore imprecise’ a sense, which makes it ‘without theological interest’, 21 or its being made ‘an object of taboo’ (Kellens 1994b , p. 25). Does, however, the virtual absence of * baga- in the G ā th ā s (the only possible occurrence is in Y 32.8), which is the most widespread Iranian word for god, mean that the G ā th ā s have diffi culty saying ‘god’? Not so, according to Le panth é on . Even if the word da ē va is discounted as a divine appellation in the G ā th ā s, as it is in Le panth é on , this does not mean that no word for god was available to the poet. As far as the da ē vas (*daiṷ a-) are concerned, their ‘demonization’ is coeval with the formation of the ‘Iranian cultural entity’ (Kellens 1994b , p. 30), and thus the negative sense of the word in the G ā th ā s has to be explained in some way other than the supposed monotheistic reform of the traditional religion. 22 As for the bagas , they are not really absent in the G ā th ā s but disguised, as it were, under the term han \u0004 t- , the present participle of the verb ξ ah ‘be’. ‘Ils constituent une cat é gorie divine inclue, avec Mazd ā , les entit é s et les da ē uuas, dans celle des han \u0004 t , qui englobe la totalit é des com-posantes de l’univers divin. C’est à ces bagas sans noms et sans titre explicites que le chantre s’adresse lorsqu’il proc è de à une invocation à la 2 è me du pluriel avec 3 è me personne du nom d’Ahura Mazd ā ’ (Kellens 1994b , p. 117). I have argued elsewhere that Kellens’ view of the present participle is problematic. 23 We have no reason to think that the anonymous second person plural invoca-tion of deities in the G ā th ā s has a reference other than the so-called ‘entities’, whether the name of Mazd ā is mentioned in the second (Kellens 1994b , p. 105) or third (cf. Kellens 1994b , p. 107 24 ) person, which is probably also true of the term ahura- ‘lord’ in the plural. 25 Still, we must note that Kellens puts the da ē vas in the category of gods without further ado, albeit as the accursed part of the divine world. In order to eliminate the ‘Zoroastrian reform’, i.e. to level as much as possible the pre- and post-Zoroastrian religious thoughts, he makes the ‘demonization’ of the da ē vas a pan-Iranian phenomenon. 26 In identifying the question of the (historical reality of the) ‘Zoroastrian reform’ with that of ‘Zoroastrian monotheism’ (Kellens 1994b , p. 34), Kellens makes the task of negating the former easy for himself. The rejection of the reform character of Zoroastrianism and the affi rmation of the mythic status of Zarathu š tra, two related, constant preoccupations of Kellens (cf. 2001 , p. 178) are presented"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Ritualistic thesis 79by him as inevitable consequences of the untenability of the monotheistic interpretation of the G ā th ā s. He never questions whether the repudiation in the G ā th ā s of the da ē vas as Iranian gods may not be understood, religiously and not just ritualistically, in ways other than a monotheistic rejection. This is indeed a paradox since he takes over the logic of e.g. Pettazzoni and Gnoli: monotheism, a fruit of anti-polytheist revolution, is not conceivable without the action of a ‘strong historical personality’. Gnoli affi rms G ā thic monothe-ism and hence the reality of the religious revolution that introduces it; Kellens denies G ā thic monotheism and believes that the question of the ‘Zoroastrian reform’ and hence the reality of an Iranian da ē va cult is thereby settled in the negative. One can see that without this ‘logic’ there is no reason to think that the denial of monotheism must lead to the dismissal of the claim that the G ā th ā s contain new religious thoughts or, perhaps more prudently, that they express in a particularly intense fashion certain religious concerns that under-lie the turn against the da ē vas . The condemnation of the da ē vas may express something essential about the G ā th ā s. In Le panth é on Kellens proposes to understand the treatment of the da ē vas in the frame of the ‘rhetoric’ of a ‘ritual triage’. I quote his text in full: Que les da ē uuas soient bien les dieux du ž d ā h ne peut gu è re ê tre mis en doute vu le passage de 30.3... Les voici donc doublement victimes de l’avis religieux des hommes ( mainiiu- ): non seulement ceux qui ont le bon avis ne pensent pas qu’ils sont spen \u0004 ta , qualit é r é serv é e à Mazd ā , mais eux-m ê mes se trouvent incapables de faire la diff é rence entre le bon et le mauvais avis et acceptent en cons é quence le mauvais rituel. Les da ē uuas ont pour r ô le d’ ê tre victimes du tri rituel. Ils sont cette part du panth é on qui est indigne du sacrifi ce et dont l’exclusion va de pair avec l’hommage rendu aux bonnes divinit é s. Ils apparaissent pour ê tre chass é s, ce qui est le lot des d é mons. Les G ā θ ā ne requi è rent nullement qu’ils soient en voie de d é monisation, mais les pr é sentent comme les dieux mauvais dont le rejet est n é cessaire pour que le sacrifi ce ne soit pas, du fait de leur pr é sence, frapp é de souillure et d’impi é t é . Le texte de la liturgie g â thique fonctionne parfaitement si nous reconnaissons que les da ē uuas y sont les d é mons qu’ils ont toujours é t é dans le monde iranien. (Kellens 1994b , p. 84) Aside from the questionable suppositions Kellens makes in his interpretation of the relevant texts (e.g. Y 30.1–6 or Y 45.1–3), which I will discuss in due course, the very idea of the da ē vas as the necessary object of a ritual triage presents a number of serious diffi culties. The apparent cause of their repudiation, namely, according to Kellens, their failure to distinguish between correct and incorrect rituals, etc., is, as we have already seen, dubious. The whole hermeneutic construction of the ritual situation is seen to be untenable once analysed. Further, the coupling of this apparent cause with the ‘structural’ cause of triage makes the former arbitrary. If indeed the rejection of the"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"80 Ritualistic thesis da ē vas is ‘necessary’ for the ritual (‘whose exclusion goes together with the homage rendered to the good deities. They appear only to be chased away... whose rejection is necessary’, etc.), any apparent cause will do – why imagine their lack of insight into the grounds of correct ritual, so cumbersome as we have seen? Is their ‘coming to the sacrifi ce’ a fact (i.e. that is what they do) or a requirement, i.e. an element of the theatre of ritual triage? Is it only their rejection that is necessary or both their coming and rejection? The suspicion that the latter (the ‘structural’ role) is meant seems justifi ed 27 in view of what Kellens says about the necessity of the fi ction of an adversary in dualism: the human worshippers of the da ē vas in the G ā th ā s are a dualistic ‘invention’: Pour le dualisme, l’ennemi est une n é cessit é doctrinale. Si la realit é n’en procure pas, il faut s’en forger et la fi ction peut y pourvoir. Il est possible que l’adversaire et son in é vitable d é faite ait é t é fi gur é e d’une mani è re ou d’une autre dans la liturgie g â thique, comme dans le mime que nous a paru supposer la derni è re G ā θ ā , et que les contrastes et les ex é crtions du texte s’adressent à des repr é sentations conceptuellement n é cessaires, mais purement symboliques, du mauvais parti. Il faut cependant recon-na î tre que les G ā θ ā rec è lent des d é tails qui s’expliquent mal autrement que par la r é alit é concr è te... Ceci invite plut ô t à voir dans les adorateurs des da ē uuas de bons mazd é ens victimes de l’amalgame qui consiste à assimiler la plus l é g è re d é viance au mal absolu. (Kellens 1994b , p. 86) If the ‘faithful of the demons’ are only slightly different Mazdaeans (whose ritual is ‘slightly deviant’?) and in fact the victims of a tendentious ‘amalgam-ation’, and if their casting as the evil adversary is ‘une m é thode pol é mique inh é rente à la doctrine dualiste’ (Kellens 1994b , p. 86), what prevents the same dualistic logic from also spawning divine players? Just as ‘good Mazdaeans’ are cast, by the necessity of the dualistic logic, as drugvan \u0004 t on the grounds of ‘la plus l é g è re d é viance’, so too, by the same logic, there have to be ‘accursed gods’, whatever the apparent cause of their ‘demonization’. For Kellens the real cause of their repudiation lies in the logic of dualism, which casts them as the necessary victim of ritual triage and the imputed ‘gods’ of the dualisti-cally appointed enemy. ‘Dans la th é ologie des G ā θ ā , les da ē uuas jouent un double r ô le: ils sont les victimes du tri rituel qui cristallise le confl it dualiste de la vie religieuse et, lieu g é ometrique des r é pulsions, ils sont l’argument ultime de la condamnation pol é mique’ (Kellens 1994b , p. 87). If the logic of dualism as such explains the ‘demonization’ (or indeed the existence) of the da ē vas and the condemnation of their faithful, why then pay any attention to the content of G ā thic texts on these subjects? In Le panth é on Kellens ends up constructing a parallel account which, instead of illuminating G ā thic texts, follows its own course. How else could we understand the fact that he says nothing in Le panth é on about the stanza (Y 32.5) where a specifi c wrong is ascribed to the da ē vas ?"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Ritualistic thesis 81 Kellens eventually abandons his denial of the historical reality of an Iranian cult of the da ē vas , or so it seems. Before turning to his most recent publications, I would like to stress and retain Kellens’ valid criticisms of the monotheistic interpretation of the repudiation of the da ē vas . In the frame of this interpret-ation, the principle presiding over the formation of the Avestan pantheon is not clear; neither is the reason why, following the ‘rehabilitation’ of some of the gods, the supposed appellation by which these gods were previously called remains an accursed word. In the monotheistic perspective, as Kellens rightly observes (Kellens 1994b , p. 33), not even Burrow’s thesis of the da ē vas as alien gods seems coherent: why attack (only) these gods (handicapped to some extent, one supposes, by their being the enemy’s gods) and not the indi-genous Iranian gods, e.g. the bagas ? Kellens, of course, never questions the presumed link between monotheism and the reality of an Iranian cult of the da ē vas : monotheism is always a religious revolution led by a strong historical personality, a prophet, against polytheism. In the G ā th ā s the false gods of the polytheistic pantheon are collectively called the da ē vas , the ancient Indo-European word for god. His overriding theoretical interest in eliminating the ‘reform moment’, levelling out the history of Mazdaean religious thought, and affi rming the mythic status of Zarathu š tra, makes him take over this link, raising it to the level of logic. If the monotheistic thesis proves untenable, the rest of the ‘historical’ prejudice will fall with it: Zarathu š tra is only a mythic fi gure and the da ē vas are only personae of the ritual, etc. Can there be no rea-son for repudiating the da ē vas other than monotheistic zeal? Could the da ē vas not have been a part of the Iranian pantheon, defi ned by a specifi c function? After all, functional specialization (‘mode of action’, ‘sphere of activity’ 28 ) of the members of pantheons is a normal phenomenon in myths and religions. In any case, Kellens articulates a new view of the matter in his La quatri è me naissance de Zarathushtra . As a result, in part, of his revision of the value of the evidence of the cult of the da ē vas (Kellens 2006 , p. 146), Kellens gives up the ‘link’ between monotheism and the ‘demonization’ of the da ē vas in the G ā th ā s: ‘Le lien entre la d é monisation des daivas et la fondation du monoth é isme centr é sur Ahura Mazd â n’a aucun caract è re de n é cessit é et ne para î t logique que parce que le deuxi è me est pr é suppos é r é el’ (Kellens 2006 , p. 147). He then faces a peculiar diffi culty. On the one hand, he wants to maintain his mythic model against the historical model of Zarathu š tra and hence against the idea of G ā thic religious innovation, and, on the other hand, seemingly acknowledg-ing the historical reality of an Iranian da ē va cult, he has to develop a scheme to explain how the ‘demonization’ of the ancient gods occurred. The point of convergence of these two perspectives is, according to Kellens, the question of whether the turning of ‘a people’ against its gods is thinkable in the absence of any religious innovation. But his formulation indicates that Kellens ( 2006 , p. 149) does not want to take the measure of the problem fully: ‘qu’a-t-il bien pu se passer pour qu’un peuple renverse le titre de dieu en celui de d é mon?’ Although he acknowledges the reality of an Iranian da ē va cult, he makes the"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"82 Ritualistic thesis word da ē va and not the gods it designates the object of ‘demonization’. He does not ask: how to explain the Iranians’ rejection of their gods in a way other than through a historical event (e.g. religious revolution)?, but: how to conceive a complete reversal of the sense and value of the word god into the word demon in the absence of all conscious innovation? In order to do this, Kellens revives an opinion formulated by Haug (Kellens 2006 , pp. 27–28) about the ‘lexical inversion’ whereby the god of the Indians ( deva ) becomes the Iranian demon ( da ē va ) and the god of the Iranians ( ahura ) becomes the Indian demon ( asura ). ‘Il reste que l’ind é pendance des d é monisations indi-ennes et iraniennes est intellectuellement diffi cile à admettre, quoiqu’il s’agisse d’une possibilit é th é orique d’autant plus acceptable qu’on n’a jamais pu les corr é ler d’une mani è re qui ne par û t pas arbitraire’ (Kellens 2006 , p. 147). 29 It is not merely based on a kind of intellectual hunch – which it seems to be at fi rst sight – that Kellens is reluctant to give up the supposed correlation between the two processes of ‘demonization’. I argued above that Hale’s work has discredited any such link. But even before him, astute scholars of the Vedas such as Oldenberg had questioned it. And the reason is not hard to understand. The two processes are not sym-metrical, neither chronologically, nor, more importantly, in respect of the objects they operate on. No Vedic god ever becomes a demon. The later Vedic ‘demonization’ is really that of the word asura , which is subsequently used of the enemies of the gods. This is not the case with the da ē vas . It is not that the term da ē va in Iran, just like the term asura in India, changes its value from positive to negative, and is subsequently used as a term of abuse to designate the gods of any other peoples whatsoever. Kellens ( 2006 , p. 149) seems to acknowledge this when he writes: ‘il fut un temps o ù les Iraniens ont appel é leur dieux daivas , et certaines tribus sur la longue dur é e, comme en t é moig-nent l’inscription de Xerx è s au V e si è cle avant l’ è re commune et l’onomastique sogdienne au IXe si è cle apr è s’. Nonetheless, this acknowledgement in no way informs his scheme, which answers a quite different question, namely, how is it possible that a term meaning god becomes a term meaning demon? It seems that for Kellens, despite his statement, the ‘daiva’ of Xerxes’ inscription does not and cannot designate (certain) Iranian gods but is in fact a term of abuse used to refer to unapproved deities. 30 He dissolves the historical reality of a religious alienation into the semantic process of (certain?) words developing one or the other of their opposite (potential) meanings through (stereotype) usage. It is not clear whether this process can happen to any word, given that it occurs in ‘formulae’, i.e. formulaic contexts, or to a certain category of words marked by defi nite characteristics: whether the ‘semantic amphipolarity’ in question ‘est inh é rente ou d é termin é e par le contexte, voire l’insertion formu-laire’ (Kellens 2006 , p. 151). In my mind, the issue of the ‘bipolarity’ of words as such is an artifi cial topic and without any explanatory value. Neither words nor their usage are bound by Kellens’ implied binary logic. Whether d á syu- /* dahyu- develops a negative or a positive value on the Indian or Iranian side, for example, has nothing to do with the ‘semantic amphipolarity’ of the word"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Ritualistic thesis 83but, for instance, with the pragmatics of confl ictual situations, in reference to which they may become marked and perhaps eventually develop into abso-lute evaluative markers, e.g. independently of the actual context, as happened to dasyu . Certainly, Iranian * dahyu- has neither positive nor negative value in itself. 31 Kellens’ description of the usage of the word martiya- ‘mortal’ or ‘man’ in the Old Persian texts in no way supports his thesis. ‘En vieux-perse, le sens est neutre quand martya d é signe l’homme en tant que mortel, amphipo-laire quand c’est l’homme en tant qu’individu, n é gatif s’il s’agit des usurpa-teurs, positif s’il s’agit des sept conjur é s ou des artisans du palais de Suse’ (Kellens 2006 , p. 151). Describing martiya- as ‘amphipolaire’ because it has a negative connotation when it appears in an admonition or imprecation and a positive one when in a praise – what is it supposed to show? ‘Tant les mots indiens que les mots iraniens conservent la marque plus or moins accus é e d’un caract è re originellement amphipolaire. Il en r é sulte que les deux domaines ne se diff é rencient pas par les inversions de polarit é ... mais par la perte progressive et parfois inverse de l’amphipolarit é ’ (Kellens 2006 , p. 152). The amphipolarity is an original characteristic of (certain) words. It is not that there is ‘a reverse process of polarisation’ (so Humbach 1991 , vol. 1, p. 23) pushing the word to one extreme or the other, but it is a question of the word losing its original amphipolarity and retaining only one of its polar meanings, and this may happen to the word in opposite semantic directions in different contexts. Even granting the (rather artifi cial) notion of an ori-ginal amphipolarity of (certain) words, 32 should we not want to know what these contexts were that determined the opposite semantic developments? It is these contexts that should explain the actual meaning/value that a supposed ‘amphipolar’ word retains. And if so, are we not referred back to historical practices and institutions? Kellens ( 2006 , p. 152) continues: ‘L’amphipolarit é s é mantique, que les Indiens et les Iraniens pratiquaient pareillement à l’aube de leur histoire, est un ph é nom è ne global affectant entre autres le vocabu-laire qui touche au c œ ur de la conscience religieuse et ethnique’. This frame of mind only leads to a petitio principii : the opposite values of deva / da ē va and asura / ahura ‘prove’ the semantic amphipolarity, which is postulated to ‘explain’ the phenomenon. ‘Il n’est donc pas de bonne m é thode d’expliquer au coup par coup les exemples qui en t é moignent... On voit bien que, dans ces conditions, l’accident historique ou th é ologique é choue à en (i.e. oppos-ite semantic developments) rendre compte’ (Kellens 2006 , p. 152). What does the phrase ‘under these conditions’ refer to: the ‘semantic amphipolarity’ that the Iranians and Indians are supposed to have ‘practised at the dawn of their history’? The primordial ‘practice of amphipolarity’ is the pseudo-his-torical transposition of the ‘original semantic amphipolarity’; and both are the marker of the potency of theory to ‘explain’ evaluative development of words, where empirical, concrete explanations necessarily fail. Compared to the explanatory power of such amphipolar semantics and pragmatics, taking place in the quasi-transcendental stage of a language or a history, historical or theological circumstances are at best insignifi cant accidents. Kellens’ reference"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"84 Ritualistic thesisto the work of Renou ( 1939 , pp. 161–235) is malapropos. By ‘contre-partie’ Renou simply means the juxtaposition of statements containing favourable and unfavourable terms: ‘Le type le plus clair est par example la combinaison de deux pri è res, l’une demandant qu’un bien soit octroy é à l’homme, l’autre qu’un mal lui soit é pargn é ’ (Renou 1939 , p. 162). 33 No sooner has Kellens admitted the reality of an Iranian cult of the da ē vas than he turns it into a question of the semantic amphipolarity of the word da ē va . 34 But even so, he cannot completely dispense with historical determin-ations. In yet another formulation, the amphipolar quality of (certain) Indo-Iranian words is no longer ‘original’, whatever this may mean, but a product of the ‘rhetorical’ practice of ‘contre-partie’: ‘On peut admettre que tous les mots envisag é s é taient à l’origine neutre ou unipolaire, que leur amphipo-larit é s’est constitu é e à l’ é poque indo-iranienne commune comme effet de la rh é torique de “contre-partie” et s’est r é sorb é e de mani è re ind é pendante en Inde et en Iran’ (Kellens 2006 , pp. 152–53). Is this ‘rhetoric of contrareity’ a specifi cally Indo-Iranian patrimony? One can see why Kellens feels that he has to adopt such a contorted position: admitting anything resembling a reli-gious innovation would mean to him giving up his in-principle rejection of the historical reality of Zarathu š tra and of the ‘Zoroastrian reform’. 35 He cherishes the opportunity to display his irreverence: ‘L’accident de langage est la meillure explication que l’on ait donn é e de la d é monisation des dai-vas, à condition de bien identifi er les facteurs qui l’ont provoqu é ’ (Kellens 2006 , p. 153). ‘Accident’ (even linguistic) by defi nition belongs to the empir-ical sphere; it should be a matter of presentation and not of postulation. As I have already mentioned, the postulate of a formative amphipolarity of (Indo-Iranian) words is artifi cial, and the best proof of this is that Kellens cannot make up his mind where to lodge it. As for the ‘factors’ that provoked the ‘demonization’ of the da ē vas , one may justifi ably think that they are for the most part ‘rhetorical’ or ‘poetic’ practices, based on Kellens’ own state-ments. And what are these about ? It is possible to defer the reference to and the analysis of the content of the poetic practice, but not indefi nitely. It is not clear to me why Kellens thinks that an affi rmation of G ā thic innovation would automatically mean a denial of the mythic status of Zarathu š tra, to which he is attached. Does the legendary nature of Orpheus prevent ‘Orphic life’ from being a distinctive religious movement, with its peculiar concerns and ideology? 36 According to Kellens’ scheme, the word da ē va does not desig-nate any specifi c god or a group of gods; it is a demonizing term one uses to refer to deities one abhors, having lost its ‘original amphipolarity’. But even if one grants this view, it only takes us back through a tortuous path to the still unanswered question: why do the G ā th ā s abhor the deities they call the da ē vas ? Kellens’ solution of the question of the ‘demonization’ of the da ē vas is really a suppression of the problem. The usage of the term da ē va becomes simply a matter of theological abuse. This is one way of understanding his position. On the other hand, if Kellens in fact believes that behind the da ē vas are disapproved Iranian gods, that is, if he does not want to conjure away"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Ritualistic thesis 85the process of ‘demonization’, he is perforce ascribing to the word da ē va the power to demonize deities, to produce religious realities. Would the ‘demon-ization’ be an empirical or a ‘transcendental’ event? If the former, when, under what circumstances, did it take place? We should turn to the G ā th ā s. Notes 1 Panaino’s position on the issue in Panaino 2004 , pp. 103–105 seems reasonable to me, especially: ‘il faut conclure que si Zara θ u š tra est le produit d’un mythe (et non le fruit d’une mythisation d’une r é alit é ), ce mythe a é t é invent é par quelqu’un qui à son tour, en composant les G ā θ ā , aurait eu comme nom de plume celui de Zara θ u š tra’ (Panaino 2004 , p. 104). I would not give the question of the historical reality of Zarathu š tra as much importance as Panaino does, however. 2 I should like to note in passing Kellens’ presentation of the issue in terms of binary oppositions: the G ā th ā s must be either doctrinal or liturgical; since they are obvi-ously not the former, they have to be the latter, hence the ‘surprise’. As long as we do not have an explicit account of what this ritual was like or meant, the affi rmation only serves the end of reducing the content of the compositions to matters pertain-ing to ritual, which is understood, be it implicitly, on the Vedic model. ‘Our limited comprehension of the G ā th ā s’ gives rise to ‘illusions’ (Kellens 2001 , p. 178) – that is, ‘prophetic’ illusions. Compare Kellens 2011 , pp. 73–79 and pp. 109–113. According to this text (Kellens 2011 , p. 78), ‘les th é ologiens de l’Avesta r é cent s’en (i.e., Srao š a le briseur d’obstacle) sont forg é une conception radicalement neuve, justifi é e à tort ou à raison par l’ex é g è se des G â th â s et int é gr é e à une formidable innovation: la doc-trine des â ges du monde, dont, selon eux, les G â th â s font le r é cit’. See also Kellens 2012 , pp. 483–85. Most recently (in his 2011/2012 Coll è ge de France lectures) Kellens suggests that each of the G ā th ā s was recited during one of the fi ve ratus of the day. The recitation of the second G ā th ā took place at night, for instance, while that of the fi rst came just before the sunrise (February 3, 2012). ‘Les G â th â s pr é sentent un cursus rituel complexe et savant. Le but de ce rite tel qu’il est d é crit à la fi n du Y 34 est (m é taphoriquement ou pas) le fait de suivre un chemin, une course, pour gagner le prix de l’immortalit é . Ainsi, eschatologie, en apparence introuvable dans le texte, est indissociable du rituel car elle est la fi nalit é de celui-ci’ (December 16, 2011). How does this daily service relate to the ‘eschatological fi nality’ of the G ā thic ritual? Kellens characterizes the Avestan doctrine of the ages as a ‘formidable innovation’, which presumably took place in the context of G ā thic eschatology. The question that naturally arises is how to account for the central place of eschatology in the G ā th ā s. 3 See Nagy 1990 , pp. 18–82; Graf 1993 , pp. 142–75. 4 See Kellens 1994a , 2000 , pp. 101–102, 2007 , pp. 434–36, 2009 , p. 268. Compare Gonda 1975 , pp. 83–91, pp. 105–13. That G ā thic ritual was thought to contribute to cosmic order is a theoretical supposition and based on, e.g. Eliade’s general theory of sacrifi ce. So far not a single line from the G ā th ā s has been adduced to support this view. Assmann ( 2006 , pp. 139–54) shows that in Egypt ritual could serve such a cosmic-regenerative function. Falk ( 1997 , esp. p. 80) argues that the ‘R \u0003 gvedic ritual’ (i.e. ‘the standard Indra/Agni complex’) took place at the beginning of spring ask-ing the gods for the swelling of rivers with waters, and not at the winter solstice for the return of longer days or as a New Year ritual. 5 In a sense, concepts and metaphors are condensed discourses. It does not go with-out saying that the words occurring in a stereotyped discourse are semantically determined by the function that the discourse serves. Compare Nietzsche’s remarks on the ‘concept’ of punishment, in Nietzsche 1994 , p. 57. See also Blumenberg 1997 , pp. 81–102."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"86 Ritualistic thesis 6 Compare Panaino 2004 , pp. 36–47. He questions Kellens’ tendency to reduce the religious thought of the G ā th ā s to matters of ritual, and gives central place to eschatology in the G ā th ā s. Panaino ( 2004 , p. 43) also suggests an initiatory-drama pattern for the supposed G ā thic ritual. See my discussion of the pattern in the last part. Panaino concludes: ‘critiquer et excluer le rituel da ē uuique a é t é l’effet d’une r é fl exion sur la r é alit é et le sens du sacrifi ce’ (Panaino 2004 , p. 46). But does this refl ection only lead to the affi rmation of a stereotyped defi nition of sacrifi ce? ‘Le sacrifi ce, instrument garant de l’ordre cosmique et sa reproduction, con ç u sur le mod è le de l’acte cr é ateur d’Ahura Mazd ā ; ainsi, la fonction du sacrifi ce est de soutenir et de reproduire l’ordre de l’univers ainsi que de garantir au sacrifi ant et à sa communaut é une r é compense ( mi ž da ), leur bien- ê tre pr é sent et futur’ (Panaino 2004 , p. 43). 7 This must mean that these gods formed a defi nite group, i.e. the word da ē va is not a generic term for god. 8 See my detailed discussion of the stanza in the following part. 9 Their text has ‘sont’, which is obviously a typographic mistake. 10 Here the text refers to a footnote (no. 44) from their Introduction (Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 32) where they acknowledge that the ‘difference of nature’ between the G ā thic ritual and that of its adversaries is ‘postulated’ by the two scholars in order to ‘explain’ the disfavour in which the da ē vas fi nd themselves. ‘Nous nous rendons bien compte que, si nous ne postulons pas une diff é rence de nature entre le syst è me g â thique et celui de ses adversaires, nous laissons inexpliqu é le discr é dit qui frappe les da ē uua, car il ne va pas de soi que la condamnation des pratiques entra î ne la mise en question de ceux à qui elles s’adressent (la querelle aurait pu se traduire par une controverse sur la volont é des dieux)’. Their reasoning for the postulation of a wrongful ritual practice, which is supposed to make comprehen-sible the G ā thic rebuke of the traditional gods, escapes me. Does not the statement that is introduced by ‘for’ undermine the postulate? Is the ‘nature’ of ritual some-thing different from ritual ‘practices’? In any event, this ‘explication’ places them before another riddle: ‘Nous faisons la constatation que les G ā θ ā ne disent pas comment l’existence du mauvais rituel met en cause la responsabilit é des da ē uua’. But why postulate the ‘wrong ritual’, and suppose it to be the ground of the con-demnation, if it cannot make comprehensible what it is meant to explain? What then motivates the postulation? 11 Their ‘paraphrase’ of Y 30.3 is: ‘Les deux é tats d’esprit, initiaux parce qu’ils sont le fondement des trois niveaux de la conduite rituelle (pens é e, parole, acte), sont r é put é s ê tre des songes jumeaux au stade de la pens é e... ils sont jumeaux parce qu’il est diffi cile de les distinguer l’un de l’autre. Pourtant, si insaisissables et indis-tincts qu’ils soient, au moment de l’acte rituel, l’un inspire le bon acte, l’autre le mauvais, et certaines divinit é s sont capables de les distinguer, d’autres non’ (Kellens and Pirart 1991 , p. 43). 12 I refer to their hermeneutic construction of the ritual situation, according to which the ritual intention ‘ne devient perceptible et ne r é v è le son caract è re positif ou n é gatif qu’au moment o ù elle se traduit en acte’ (Kellens and Pirart 1991 , p. 44). One can reconstruct one and only one meaning for identical actions in identical contexts at any one time. If the intention is to be manifested in action, as their statement avers, one would have to conclude that different intentions must lead to different actions. On this set of assumptions, the da ē vas are bad hermeneuticians. See Honneth and Joas 1988 , pp. 59–69. 13 The effect and outcome of this method can be seen in Kellens’ understanding of the G ā thic x š a θ ra- ‘power’ as ‘emprise rituelle (sur)’, ‘hold over’ the divinity to which the ritual is addressed (Kellens and Pirart 1990 , p. 232). The formidable dif-fi culties of translation that their ‘methodological’ choice creates do not discourage them. They translate (Y 37.2) ahii ā x š a θ r ā c ā maz ə̄ n ā c ā hauuapa ŋ h ā i š c ā as ‘gr â ce"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Ritualistic thesis 87 à l’emprise sur lui, à sa grandeur et à ses savoir-faire’. The genitive pronoun refer-ring to an agent in two instances yields a subjective sense and in one (‘power’) an objective sense, in a statement that is clearly about the god’s virtues. In the face of the syntax and sense, Kellens maintains his ‘methodological position’ that x š a θ ra- is everywhere a technical ritual term. In the ‘domaine exclusif d’une litur-gie é troite et homog è ne’ (Kellens 1990 , p. 99), terms can only have ritual meanings. ‘Bien entendu, ceci est une position m é thodologique qui demande à ê tre corrig é e à tout moment à l’ é preuve des faits... Prenons l’exemple de x š a θ ra- ... Ce n’est pas que nous pension que x š a θ ra- ne puisse avoir des signifi cations analogues à celles, par exemple, de son é quivalent vieux-perse, mais nous doutons qu’elles apparais-sent dans les textes. Effectivement, le sens “emprise magique du sacrifi ant sur la divinit é “ et lui seul semble en mesure de rendre compte sans diffi cult é de toutes les attestations de x š a θ ra- . Reste une exception à la fois incertaine et remarquable’ (Kellens 1990 , p. 99). The ‘uncertain’ exception is the occurrence in Y 37.2 men-tioned above. Kellens abandons this ‘methodological position’ – silently for the most part. The only place that I am aware of where he addresses his revision is the following. ‘Mon sentiment personnel est que ks \u0004 atr á - / x š a θ ra- est l’un des mots indo-iraniens que nous comprenons le moins bien. Pirart et moi (TVA II 1990, 232), sur une suggestion de Humbach ( 1959 , II 86), en avons fait l’emprise rituelle, entre autre parce que ce sens est compatible avec la r é versibilit é ... Le sacrifi ant exerce l’emprise sur la divinit é et la divinit é conc è de au sacrifi ant que l’emprise soit exerc é e sur elle’ (Kellens 2002 , pp. 439–40). The ‘reversibility’ of an instrument or a course of action with respect to two agents (see Wackernagel and Debrunner 1954 , pp. 701–706 for the suffi x -tra ) can hardly mean one party wields it and the other allows itself to undergo it. Kellens continues: ‘Mais j’ai toujours dout é , contrairement à Pirart, que le champ s é mantique du mot s’arr ê tait l à (voir TVA III 1991, 140). J’ai n é anmois adh é r é à la traduction syst é matique de x š a θ ra- par “emprise-rituelle” parce que notre principe commun é tait de refuser les polys é mies de commodit é et qu’un reste de dum é zilianisme m’inclinait à penser que le x š a θ ra- é tait trifonctionnel et que celui de premi è re fonction devait correspondre à cela’ (Kellens 2002 , p. 444). The ritualist distortion of the G ā thic term goes unnoticed. 14 See Herrenschmidt 1993 , pp. 48–49, who proposes reading * art ā hac ā for art ā c ā ; and Schlerath and Skj æ rv ø 1987 on brazmaniy(a) . The OP text is cited from Kent 1953 , p. 151. 15 See Boyce 2001 , p. 56: ‘Old Persian “daiva” corresponds to Avestan “daeva”, and these lines show the religious struggle initiated by the prophet in eastern Iran being carried on centuries later by his followers in the west’. See also Zaehner 1961 , p. 159: ‘The daivas mentioned in the inscription can scarcely be other than the da ē vas whom Zoroaster so vigorously attacks in the G ā th ā s ’. Gnoli’s translation ( 1980 , p. 78) of the fi rst statement (‘and amongst these countries there was (one) in which previously the daivas were worshipped’) cannot be right, since the anaphoric avam (‘that’) in the following statement qualifi es daivad ā nam (‘daiva-temple’). 16 How to know the controversy concerns the ritual? 17 The idea that the inscription may be viewed as a ‘restoration of royal cult’ lacks all basis. It should not be a question of coming up with an idea that has some general plausibility (i.e. common diffi culties attending royal succession) that allows one to make the facts (i.e. the ‘daiva’) suit one’s purposes. 18 As Kellens ( 1994b , pp. 12ff.) points out, the diffi culty of this account is especially acute in the frame of the traditional dating of Zoroaster. The ‘account’ that, e.g. Gershevitch ( 1964 , pp. 26–32) gives of the supposed process of the perversion of the monotheistic message of the prophet by his ‘epigone’ and later by the Magian priesthood of western Iran is a historical romance. In no other fi eld of historical studies would such an account be taken seriously – why should it be here, just because relevant historical evidence is scarce?"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"88 Ritualistic thesis 19 I emphasize again that the notion of ‘god’ as we generally understand it comes from Platonic philosophy. It is a concept that does not exist in ancient religions. 20 In his 2010/2011 lectures at Coll è ge de France, Kellens, taking his departure from the observation that most of the deities of the Avesta do not have Vedic coun-terparts, offers a different perspective on the pantheon: ‘le syst è me religieux de l’Avesta dans son ensemble permet la th é ogen è se. C’est la vigueur, l’inventivit é et la permanence du processus de th é ogen è se qui rend compte des divergences entre le panth é on v é dique et panth é on mazd é en, mais aussi entre le panth é on de l’Avesta ancien et celui de l’Avesta r é cent. Ce qui caract é rise celui-ci par rapport à celui-l à , c’est la multiplication des dieux. La plupart des dieux é tant nouveaux, la multiplication n’est pas la marque du retour au pass é polyth é iste, mais le produit continu de la th é ogen è se’ (Kellens 2012 , p. 484). 21 This is his position in Kellens 2012 , p. 471. 22 The thesis of the constitutive demonization of the da ē vas allows Kellens ( 1994b , p. 33) to confront the monotheistic camp with yet another ‘damning paradox’: ‘pour affi rmer le monoth é isme, Zara θ u š tra s’en prend non aux ahuras ou aux bagas , mais aux daivas , qui sont ou d’antiques d é mons, ou les dieux de l’ennemi’ (according to Burrow). 23 See Ahmadi, forthcoming . 24 ‘Le premier type associe à Mazd ā les entit é s exclusivement, le second n’est attest é s avec abondance et clart é qu’au moment du tri des dieux i š an \u0004 t (de 29.1 à 31.2, 45.1, 53.4–7), ce qui signifi e qu’il s’adresse à un ensemble divin plus vaste que celui con-stitu é par Mazd ā et les entit é s et qui inclut, en tout cas, les d é mons. Il est clair à pr é sent que les bagas ne peuvent ê tre tacitement pr é sents dans l’Avesta ancien que s’ils sont compris eux aussi dans l’extension maximale du monde divin que d é fi nis-sent i š an \u0004 t et han \u0004 t ’ (Kellens 1994b , p. 107). I will comment on the passages Kellens mentions in the next chapters, but even if it turns out that i š an \u0004 t is an inclusive divine category in the G ā th ā s ( han \u0004 t is illusory in my mind), it is not possible ipso facto to conclude that it coincides with (Kellens 1994b , p. 117), or includes (Kellens 1994b , p. 107), the baga . We have no evidence whatsoever that the Iranian baga elsewhere includes the da ē vas . The ‘ritual triage’ argument is considered in the text. As for the baga being included in the i š an \u0004 t , this is a supposition with no clear textual evidence. 25 See Narten 1996 , p. 64. 26 But even in this frame it is not easy to level out the two sides: how to explain the degeneration of a part of the pantheon (with a seemingly important ritual func-tion) into the grotesque fi ends of the later Zoroastrian literature, e.g. V ī d ē vd ā d? For whatever number of centuries the da ē vas maintain their divine status as a part of the pantheon, albeit accursed (such is their G ā thic role, according to Le pan-th é on ), then in the course of a few centuries in the context of Zoroastrianism they degenerate into supernatural ruffi ans and perverts (e.g. V 8.31–2). Whence such a metamorphosis? 27 Kellens fi rst postulates the ‘wrong ritual’ as the grounds of the repudiation of the da ē vas ; then, not being able to say in what the wrongness consists, he conjures away the whole problem. The emptiness of the adjective signifi es that it is a struc-tural feature of the G ā thic ritual dualism. 28 See, for example, Detienne and Vernant 1978 , pp. 177–213. 29 The reasoning escapes me: since thus far no substantial proof has been produced for the correlation of the two processes, the theory that nonetheless postulates the correlation – because it is intellectually diffi cult to admit it as a coincidence – has to sound all the more plausible. But theory should explain real events or in any case phenomena admitted as real, and not conjure scenarios against evidence and pretend it is explaining independent data."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Ritualistic thesis 89 30 The alternative is: the word da ē va is demonized and thereby its references become demons. But this is singularly monstrous. 31 Compare Watkins 1995 , pp. 311–12. 32 In my mind, when all is said and done, this ‘amphipolarity’ of words is con-structed to serve a theoretical programme (i.e. denying at all cost the historical reality of the ‘Zoroastrian reform’, in any sense of the term). And when Kellens (see further in the text) talks about ‘the semantic amphipolarity that the Indians and Iranians practised at the dawn of their history’ – the whole thing sounds like mythifi cation. Besides, one wonders what ‘practising semantic amphipo-larity’ means and how it squares with describing words as being semantically amphipolar. 33 What Renou says about the unstable arrangement of the Vedic pantheon or the role of sacrifi ce therein (e.g. the reversibility of ritual procedures as means of power), etc., is not, at least prima facie , relevant for the G ā thic material. 34 See Kellens 2006 , p. 153: ‘Les inversions indo-iraniennes de polarit é ne sont la con-s é quence ni d’une dissension ethnique ni d’un coup d’ É tat th é ologique. Elles d é cou-lent pareillement, mais ind é pendamment, d’un vieux trait de langue et de po é sie en d é fi nitive assez superfi ciel’. Here, in the second variant, Kellens thinks that the polarity of a da ē va is both a matter of language and poetic practice. Kellens’ dic-tion ‘theological coup d’ é tat’ for referring to religious innovation shows what he thinks of the idea, and one can imagine his pleasure in writing ‘en d é fi nitive assez superfi ciel’! 35 Compare Swennen 2009 , p. 311. 36 See my discussion in Part III, with references.

"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" pageThis intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" Part II Preamble Recent scholarship has emphasized the central place of ritual in the G ā th ā s. 1 This emphasis is well justifi ed. That we know what the purpose of the supposed G ā thic rite (why only one?) was, what its signifi cance might have been; that the G ā th ā s themselves were liturgical texts (like the Yasna Hapta ŋ h ā iti (YH) or the text of a ritual drama); or that sacrifi ce generally aims at a kind of restoration of the pristine world or time – these assertions and others like them are yet to be demonstrated. Even if the ‘result of the yasna ritual’, as Skj æ rv ø ( 2007b , p. 119) maintains, is ‘the re-ordering and rebirth of the cosmos’ – an opinion which is as much based on Eliade’s theory of sacrifi ce as on a possible interpretation of a number of Pahlavi texts – still this says next to nothing about the supposed ‘G ā thic sacrifi ce’. 2 Just because we fi nd in the G ā th ā s the idea that Mazd ā ‘fashioned’ the world ‘by means of thought’ (e.g. Y 31.11) we cannot conclude without further ado that ‘G ā thic sacrifi ce’ must somehow imitate this act of creation – unless one assumes that this is the function of sacrifi ce in general. 3 Herrenschmidt, too, subscribes to the view in question. ‘In Mazdean Iran, ritual functions as the repetition of the god’s cosmogonic activity and reproduces the exact order of divine creation. It is characterized by exact order in its language, gestures, and speech’ (Herrenschmidt 2003 , p. 16). 4 The problem with this view is that taken in a vague sense it seems to have a general plausibility; after all, every ritual must have a sense and purpose, and if there was in fact a ‘G ā thic rite’, it must have had the signifi cance that one can fi nd in later Zoroastrian tradition, which is, further, supported by the theory of sacrifi ce – so the reasoning goes. 5 Thus the question of ritual in the G ā th ā s is never genuinely raised. Why, indeed, assume there was only one type of G ā thic ritual? The picture of the da ē va cult we fi nd in the G ā th ā s marks out an authentic (that is to say, scrutable) way to the question of ritual in the G ā th ā s. The cult is repudiated both in its form and in its pretensions, but precisely, it seems, in the name of what it holds out as its purpose. The G ā thic deities are declared to be superior to the da ē vas and their mortal followers (Y 34.5 and 45.11) – but in respect of what? The character of the da ē vas that emerges from the G ā th ā s is more or less clear. Our knowledge of the G ā thic conception of these gods comes almost entirely from two passages: Y 30.1–6 and Y 32.1–5. In both of"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"94 Part II: Preamblethese passages the poet frames his mythological discourse about primordial things with notices of his own privileged status and role. In neither of these texts do G ā thic deities appear in the second person (i.e. in the vocative): the (implied) interlocutor seems to be human. But it is not merely on grammatical grounds that we must envisage human addressees for the poet’s discourse. More importantly, what is said can be of interest only to them. Something needful, vital, something ‘to be heeded’ ( mazd ā θ ā ), is presented to the ‘mindful ones’ ( hum ą zdr ā ). It is in this context that the reason for the condemnation of the ancient gods is expressed. Based on the repudiation one may conclude that the da ē vas had, already before Zarathu š tra, assumed a defi nite function, in whose discharge they have failed in the poet’s eyes. Two stanzas, Y 44.20 and 48.11, seem to recall the traditional view of these gods, against which the poet takes a stance. Stanzas Y 34.5 and 45.11 declare the superiority of G ā thic deities to the da ē vas , which logically precedes Y 27.13, the acknowledgement of Mazd ā as the guiding and protective god of life and salvation. I discuss the texts from Y 30 in Chapter 5 and leave those of Y 32 for Chapter 6 . Notes 1 See in particular the contributions in Stausberg 2004 . Skj æ rv ø strongly believes in the pivotal role of ritual in the G ā th ā s. See Skj æ rv ø 2003 , 2007a , 2007b . See also Herrenschmidt 2003 ; Kellens 2011 ; Cantera 2012 . 2 Skj æ rv ø ( 2003 , pp. 189–90) follows Mol é ( 1963 ) in maintaining that the G ā th ā s describe the scenario of a ritual drama (Skj æ rv ø : ‘ritual procedure’) whose purpose is the re-creation of the pristine order world, e.g. by combating the forces of evil. There is a ‘second level of meaning’ in sacrifi ce beyond ‘a gift exchange with the gods’, according to Lincoln ( 1981 , p. 69): ‘it also acts for the benefi t of the whole world as a reenactment and recreation of the fi rst sacrifi ce, the memory of which is preserved in myth. This primordial sacrifi ce served to create the world, and it is the prototype not only of all sacrifi ce but also of all creative action. Each sacrifi ce makes that fi rst offering real again and reestablishes the entire creation’. 3 Compare Skj æ rv ø 2007a , pp. 61–64. 4 The phrase ‘exact order’ seems to have two different senses in the two statements where it appears: substantive order and sequential orderliness of a procedure, respectively. If I am correct about the fi rst, I wonder what the statement, ‘ritual reproduces the exact order of divine creation’, could possibly mean, and to what it actually refers. 5 This conception of G ā thic ritual is an ‘application’ of a theory that rouses minimum amount of questioning, since the theory does most of the work: ritual by defi nition follows a strict order; it is naturally performed for a purpose; its purpose is to refresh the order.

It is the choice that determines one’s existence not only in this world, but also beyond death in the ‘mental state’. The concluding stanza, Y 30.11, scarcely leaves any doubt as to the eschatological perspective of the discourse. The obscure Y 30.9 seems to point to a project of the renovation of the world, to a universal eschatology, then, but it contains much that is incomprehensible. If in fact such a view is justifi ed, two questions naturally arise: what does this renewal mean, and what are its mechanisms? In this context belongs the question of the cosmic role of sacrifi ce in the G ā th ā s. One must give due consideration to the antagonistic dualism of this context. In the terms that J. Z. Smith uses, the frame of the question must probably be the ‘utopian’ worldview, and not the ‘locative’; the latter is cast in the language of ‘confi dence’ while the former in that of ‘salvation’. 1 In any case, it is in the concern with the fate of the soul that eschatology is present in Y 30. In the poet’s thoroughgoing opposition to the da ē va cult we may fi nd the fulcrum of a historical explanation of Zoroastrian cosmic dualism and eschat-ology. The role that the ‘benefi cent spirit’ ( sp ə n \u0004 ta- mainiiu- ) plays in the econ-omy of the spiritual powers in the G ā th ā s, namely the source of Zarathu š tra’s ‘true’ knowledge (of primordial things), on the one hand, and, on the other, the parallel role ascribed to the ‘deceptive spirit’ ( dr ə guuan \u0004 t- mainiiu- ) in the da ē va cult, suggest that the concrete reality behind the ‘deceptive’ or ‘hostile spirit’ ( an \u0004 gra- mainiiu- ) is the da ē va cult. The two spirits (but not the idea of a supernatural source of knowledge) must be a G ā thic innovation. The poet undermines the ‘actions’ of the da ē va cult at its source: they are not grounded in ‘true’ but ‘deceptive’ knowledge, and only lead to ‘ruination’.

The syntax of this stanza presents only two problems. As far as I know, all the scholars translate the emphatic particle o c ī t ̃ as ‘even’, and accordingly understand the relative phrase as something like: I am going to declare these (things) that should be heeded even by those who already know (them). Insler ( 1975 , p. 33) has: ‘I shall speak of those things which are to be borne in mind – even by one who already knows’, etc. Is the poet reminding his listeners of something they already know? The content and tone of the discourse makes this very unlikely. Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 123) gives: ‘I shall proclaim (now)... such (things) which You shall report to (Him) who already knows (them)’, etc. Kellens and Pirart ( 1988 , p. 110) have: ‘Je vais dire... les louanges que m ê me le savant doit prendre en compte’, etc. Panaino ( 2004b , 119) has: ‘les connaissances qui (appartiennent) à celui qui (d é j à les) conna î t’. The emphatic particle draws attention to the word to which it is attached. This is its primary signifi cance, and only occasionally has the concessive meaning of ‘even’. Here there is no reason to understand it in the latter sense, especially because the resulting statement becomes rather awkward: telling certain things to someone (divine or human) who already knows them. The awkwardness is even more pronounced in Humbach, and Kellens and Pirart, since they take the interlocutors to be divine beings. Is the poet excusing himself for being repetitive? The perfect participle v ī duuah- ‘the knowledgeable one’ does not refer to someone who knows a particular thing, so that in our stanza it would mean the one who already knows the things the poet is about to announce. The term designates a specifi c type of being, divine or human. The v ī duuah has access to a special kind of knowledge. The type is also found in the Vedas and Homeric and Hesiodic poems. In Y 31.17 we fi nd: ‘which of the two, the a š\u000f avan or the drugvan \u0004 t , convinces (?) more, let a knowledgeable one tell (another) knowledgeable one ( v ī duu å v ī du š ē mraotu \u0006 )’, etc. Y 31.6 is specifi c about the type of ‘knowledge’ that is at issue: ahm ā i a ŋ hat ̃ vahi š t ə m y ə\u000e m ō i v ī duu å vaoc ā t ̃ hai θ ī m m ą θ r ə m yim hauruuat ā t ō a š\u0004 ahii ā am ə r ə t ā tasc ā mazd ā i auuat ̃ x š a θ r ə m hiiat ̃ h ō i vohu \u0006 vax š at ̃ mana ŋ h ā ‘may the best thing be for him , the knowledgeable one, who would tell me the true formula, (namely) that of integrity, a š\u0004 a and immortality, (that is,) for Mazd ā (the best thing which is) the (divine) power that (one) will have made grown for him by good thinking’. The v ī duuah knows the ‘true’ formula. Thus in Y 30.1, the phrase hiiat ̃ c ī t ̃ v ī du š ē characterizes and signals the kind of discourse that the poet is about to deliver, and indirectly recalls the privileged status of the poet himself. It is the knowledge of ultimate things that the poet is going to impart to his listeners: of the beginnings and the end, and of what one should do in the meantime, the side one has to take, in order to have a good life and a blissful afterlife. Humbach and Kellens and Pirart maintain that the vocatives i šə n \u0004 t ō and hum ą zdr ā refer to divine beings. 2 If this were true this stanza would be com-pletely isolated from the rest of Y 30, which (1) hardly has any interest for"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"The choice 99immortal beings, and (2) cannot be described as ‘liturgical praises of the yasna- (and vahma- ) type’. The interlocutors of Y 30.2 are human beings, as we will see; it continues the previous stanza, with the fi nite verbs in the second person plural. Humbach and Kellens give no specifi c reasons for taking the interlocutors as divine beings; their only reason is that since, according to them, the G ā th ā s are liturgical compositions of the Vedic type, the interlocu-tors must be divine. This affi rmation is not adequate, as it does not take up in situ the task of demonstrating the suitability of the assignment. Humbach’s translation in particular hardly makes sense: nondescript divine beings (or the ‘Ahuras’, according to his commentary in Humbach 1991 , vol. 2, p. 45), are addressed and asked to report the hymns of praise and prayers on offer to Mazd ā who already knows them. Why is the supreme god himself not pre-sent? Is a š\u0004 a absent, too, since its name is mentioned in the third person? The image of some gods being asked to convey to Mazd ā the hymns meant for the god is particularly out of place in the G ā th ā s, where Mazd ā is the ever pre-sent, if not exclusive, divine interlocutor of the poet. As for my second point: which of the stanzas of Y 30 may be reason-ably described as ‘praises and worshipful words’ (Humbach) or ‘praises of vahma- and yasna-type’ (Kellens and Pirart)? Kellens and Pirart ( 1991 , p. 45) make mazd ā θ ā somehow dependent on staot ā c ā ‘praises’ as a kind of attribu-tive, and account for the coordinating particle by assuming that staot ā c ā ... yesnii ā c ā is elliptical for *staot ā yesnii ā c ā vahmii ā c ā . But it is not necessary to do this. The o c ā attached to ‘praises’ coordinates staot ā o ... yesnii ā c ā va ŋ h ə\u000e u š mana ŋ h ō with mazd ā θ ā , thus giving due weight to the fact that mazd ā θ ā is further specifi ed by the attributive relative and thus distanced from the other two accusative complements of the verb, which, moreover, occur in a differ-ent verse line. The poet says: I am going to give you the knowledge of ultim-ate things, a knowledge that should be committed to mind, the kind that a v ī duuah has access to; and also offer praises and worshipful words to Mazd ā and a š\u0004 a . Kellens and Pirart ( 1990 , p. 301) suggest that vahma may designate a ritual phase complementary to yasna : ‘ d’apr è s la structure du YH (my ital-ics), il semble que le vahma consiste à r é citer des formules de demande et d’ é loge’. In the commentary to their translation of the Older Avestan texts, they further write: ‘si 35.7 ahurahii ā ... mazd å yasn ə mc ā vahm ə mc ā d é fi nit la c é r é monie d’hommage haptah â tique, é tant donn é que l’ensemble 37–39 est intrins é quement d é fi ni (my italics) comme le yasna , 40–41 constitue implic-itement, mais n é cessairement, la phase du vahma .

The text of Y 37–39 is a composition of yasna -type because its units are framed by the liturgical yazamaid ē ‘we worship’, which occurs seventeen times in this text, and is confi ned, in the Old Avestan texts, to these three YH chapters (Hintze 2004b , p. 295). 3 This is why Kellens and Pirart say it ‘is intrinsically defi ned as yasna ’. The Yasna Hapta ŋ h ā iti not only was"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"100 The choiceplaced at the centre of the Yasna collection of texts (72 sections) but, ‘being the worship text par excellence, offered the model for many of the yazamaide -formulae in the YAv. parts of the Yasna’ (Hintze 2004b , p. 299). In fact, after a careful analysis (Hintze 2004b , pp. 311–16) of the uses of the word yasna in the Young Avestan texts from the Yasna and Visperad collections, Hintze concludes that ‘where yasna- denotes a text in Av. passages it is referring to the Yasna Hapta ŋ h ā iti... while the ritual function of the Gathas does not emerge clearly, that of the Yasna Hapta ŋ h ā iti is obvious... the YH is the text of worship par excellence, being entirely dedicated to the worship and praise, yasn ə mc ā vahm ə mc ā in the language of the YH, of Ahura Mazd ā and his spiritual and physical creations’ (Hintze 2004b , p. 315). 4 The later Avestan tradition knows the yasna -type liturgy from the three YH sections (Y 37–39), which are transparently a text of liturgical worship. And, according to Hintze, and Kellens and Pirart, the only text we may with some confi dence identify as vahma- type is Y 40–41. On the other hand, generally speaking, we have vir-tually no idea of the supposed ‘ritual function’ of the G ā th ā s. Hintze’s state-ment that ‘the ritual function of the Gathas does not emerge clearly’ is, to my mind, an understatement. Cantera ( 2012 , p. 227) asserts that the arrange-ment of the G ā th ā s ‘depends on the ritual exactly like the arrangement of the YH ’. Perhaps. Given that Y 30 neither self-evidently (in the actual content) nor in comparison with the only composition of the yasna -type (i.e. Y 37–39 marked by the ‘we worship’ formula) about which we have any knowledge can be described as ‘praises of yasna -type’, by what measure can we consider the stanzas of Y 30 to be so? Kellens and Pirart’s interpretation of the syntax ( t ā ... y ā ... staot ā o ) is one possibility, but not the only one. The phrase t ā ... y ā mazd ā θ ā hiiat ̃ c ī t ̃ v ī du š ē emphasizes ‘things to be committed to mind’ both syntactically and by characterizing the kind of things in question, namely the kind that a v ī duuah has access to. Along with his discourse about the ultimate things, the poet also offers praises and worshipful words ‘inspired by good thinking’ to Mazd ā and a š\u0004 a . If we assume that with staota- and yesniia- the poet is referring to traditional types of ritual discourse, 5 one may speculate that perhaps in mentioning them (what is the signifi cance of the restriction ‘inspired by good thinking’?) he is discharging an offi ce by declaring it ful-fi lled or perhaps recalling his social function and underlining his privileged status. Note the restriction ‘inspired by good thinking’ placed by the poet on the traditional genres, e.g. stut -type. He differentiates himself from traditional priests. The relative phrase Y 30.1c′ can be understood in two ways: the relative pronoun either refers to dar ə sat ā , ‘(things) to behold’ or perhaps ‘beautiful (things)’, itself the object of the principal verb vax š iia– , or it refers to a š\u0004 a- imme-diately preceding it. 6 The diffi culty with the fi rst alternative is that one would not know what to do with raoc ə\u000e b ī š . Insler, who seems to interpret dar ə sat ā as a gerundive, translates the instrumental plural raoc ə\u000e b ī š ‘throughout your days’: ‘which things are to be seen in joy throughout your days’ (Insler 1975 , p. 33). But then this would be the only instance in the G ā th ā s that raocah- has"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The choice 101a quotidian sense. In all its other occurrences it refers to celestial regions. The interpretation (by Humbach and Insler) of dar ə sat ā as a gerundive is also problematic. I prefer Kellens and Pirart’s analysis ( 1991 , p. 45), which makes of y ā a relative pronoun (inst. neuter) referring to a š\u0004 a and governed by the fi rst person present uruu ā z ā ‘I rejoice’. The phrase dar ə sat ā raoc ə\u000e b ī š describes a š\u0004 a– , introduced in the relative phrase, and in the instrumental by case attraction (cf. Oettinger 1986 ). As Kellens and Pirart write ( 1991 , p. 45), it is hard to get a fi rm grip on the sense of the inst. pl. raoc ə\u000e b ī š . It is probably a complement of a š\u0004 a- describing the circumstances under which it is imagined. The adjective dar ə sata- means something like ‘pleasing to see’ or simply ‘beautiful’. The rela-tive phrase would then mean something like: the beautiful ( a š\u0004 a ) bathed in the heavenly lights in which I rejoice. Again, in the phrase, the poet says something about himself, too, and tacitly offers his capacity and experiences as a basis for the veracity and authority of his discourse.

Behold with an enlightened mind the two choices before your discernment, so that, before the great reckon-ing, each man may announce it (i.e., his choice) in the expectation of (the reckoning). Y 30.2c′ has an excessive syllable. Kellens and Pirart ( 1991 , p. 46) suggest that n ə\u000e is a contamination from Y 51.6 a θ ā n ə\u000e sazdii ā i (so too Insler 1975 , p. 164). As it will become clear below, syntactic and semantic considerations also oblige us to remove it. The better attested ā uuar ə n å chosen by Geldner (e.g. * ā uuar ə nah- in the plural) is troublesome. It is formed from ā + √ var ‘choose, select’, attested also in Sanskrit (see AW , col. 1360; cf. EWA , vol. 2, p. 511). Insler ( 1975 , p. 163) interprets the word as the dual accusative of a presumably masculine na -stem noun (‘the two choices’) without, however, commenting on the attested endings, following Bartholomae ( AW , col. 333) and Reichelt ( 1911 , p. 222: ‘confession of faith’) among others. The form should then be ā uuar ə n ā , which is given only in Mf2 and C1 among the good manuscripts (see Kellens and Pirart 1991 , p. 46). For ā uuar ə n å , both feminine n ā -stem and neuter nah -stem are possible. Kellens and Pirart dismiss Kuiper’s explanation ( 1978 , pp. 25–28) of the replacement of – ā by – å , since, according to them, the confusion between the two attested endings at the end of a word occurs only in the case of hizuu å /hizuu ā (Y 45.1, 51.3), i.e. at the internal boundary of a compound. However, Kellens himself ( 1994a , pp. 60–61: ‘par la faute graphique’) considers such an explanation for hizuu å . ā uu ə r ə t ō , replacing either *hizu \u0006 –v ā uu ə r ə t ō or the instrumental *hizuu ā followed by the adjective * v ə r ə t ō . The ‘graphic’ explanation (‘une scriptio continua abusive’) seems to me, even for the latter, not as plausible as the phonetic one. Liturgical"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"102 The choicerecitation provides the phonetic environment for the confusion in question: an open vowel followed by a rounded (semi-) vowel (‘v’ or ‘u’). The genitive v ī ci θ ahii ā is considered as subjective by scholars: ‘the two choices of decision’ (Insler 1975 , p. 33), ‘the two parties (?) between which one must discern’ (Kuiper 1978 , p. 26), ‘les pr é f é rences qui r é sultent du dis-cernement’ (Kellens and Pirart 1988 , 110), ‘the invitations resulting from the discrimination of each single man’ (Humbach 1991 , vol. 1, p. 123), ‘die bei-den Wahlm ö glichkeiten, die zur Entscheidung stehen’ (Lommel 1930 , p. 221). The word v ī ci θ a- ‘discernment’ may be understood either as a faculty or an activity. Lommel, Kuiper, Insler and Gnoli ( 1980 , p. 182) rightly understand the genitive in the possessive sense, i.e. the two choices belonging to, falling to, or before (the power of) discernment. In this rendition, v ī ci θ a- has the sense of ‘faculty’. In Humbach’s, and Kellens and Pirart’s version, it is under-stood more as an activity or possibly an accomplishment (Kellens 1994a , p. 65: ‘l’acte de discrimination’). The problem is: where does one place such an accomplishment? Who carries out this discernment between the two choices? Is it the individual whosoever that distinguishes between the two choices? This cannot be right, since it precisely requires the extraordinary knowledge that is only available to the poet. Is it, then, that the interlocutors are asked to note the result of the activity of discernment accomplished by the poet? This is in fact what Kellens and Pirart ( 1991 , pp. 203–204) are committed to, since for them the verb v ī + ξ ci does not mean ‘picking out, selecting’ but ‘distinguish-ing between’. In Le panth é on Kellens ( 1994a , p. 65) gives a particular sense to ā uuar ə n å , which he assimilates to varana– , without analysing its form, how-ever. It is, according to him, a constituent of the ritual triage of the gods: ‘d é claration de pr é f é rence-rituelle’. In this, varana- seems to be an already positively marked ‘choix’. 7 If so, there cannot be a ‘bad choice’. On the other hand, the semantics of v ī ci θ a- (‘distinguish between’) posited by Kellens and Pirart ( 1991 , p. 46) prevent ā uuar ə n ā (or ā uuar ə n å ) from being the object of a positive act of choosing. Finally, even if ā uuar ə n ā is understood as a dual with a neutral meaning – thus, ‘observe well the two ritual choices that are put to you and declare your hands’ – what the poet urges his audience to do, namely, to take note of and distinguish between the two choices, seems to be at odds with the general condemnation, according to Kellens’ theory, of the ‘bad rit-ual’ in the G ā th ā s. In effect, ‘ritual preference’ is not a matter of choice. 8 The ‘ritual triage’ (the phrase Kellens uses in Le panth é on ) presumably eliminates the uninvited ‘divine guests’ ( i š an \u0004 t- according to Kellens’ interpretation of this term) rather than giving them a chance to choose the ‘good ritual’, be it theatrical (see Chapter 4 ). I will argue further down that the semantics of v ī + ξ ci proposed by Kellens is untenable. The idea that the attention of the interlocutors is drawn not to the ‘best things’ which the poet announces and encourages them to make their own, but to the two (ritual) choices, one correct and one incorrect, has to confront a formidable challenge. Kellens and Pirart see in 30.2aa′ vahi š t ā ... mana ŋ h ā the name of vohu- manah- ‘good thinking’, but since the two main verbs already"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"The choice 103have their instrumental of means, they translate it as describing the grounds of the actions expressed in the verbs: ‘Gr â ce à la tr è s divine Pens é e, é coutez de vos oreilles et regardez de votre vue’ (Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 110). So does Panaino ( 2004b , p. 119): ‘ É coutez de (vos) oreilles et regardez de (votre) vue gr â ce à la Pens é e la Meilleure (Vahi š ta Manah) les (deux) pr é f é rences’, etc. Although formally possible, this analysis is unlikely in view of Y 45.5. I do not discount the possibility that the suggestive presence of the constituents of the name of the god vohu- manah- is intended. But, in my view, the mean-ing of the verse is something like: ‘listen with your ears to the best things! Observe with a clear mind’, etc. (so Insler, Kuiper, Lommel, and Humbach, see above). Y 45.5 expresses the images and ideas found in Y 30.2 in a more explicit way. The poet’s conception of his own position and activity, and the stakes involved in the ‘choice’ are made explicit. Y 45.5 at ̃ frauuax š ii ā , hiiat ̃ m ō i mraot ̃ sp ə n \u0004 t ō .t ə m ō vac ə\u000e sru \u0006 idii ā i, hiiat ̃ mar ə ta ē ibii ō vahi š t ə m y ō i m ō i ahm ā i, s ə rao šə m d ą n caiiasc ā up ā .jim ə n, hauruu ā t ā am ə r ə t ā t ā va ŋ h ə\u000e u š mainii ə\u000e u š , š\u000b iiao θ an ā i š mazd å ahur ō Now, I am going to pronounce the word that the most vitalizing Mazd ā Ahura tells me, so that it is heard, (the word) that is the best for my men. Those who give him obedience and respect will accede to integrity and immortality through actions informed by the good intuition. The two aorist verbs d ą n and up ā .jim ə n are in the subjunctive; the relative clause expresses the condition of the action described in the main clause: ‘those who do... will have achieved...’ The aorist focuses attention on the action as such (rather than the circumstances of its unfolding). Thus the two actions describe a general relation, a conditional situation; and the audience is told that the attainment of the state they presumably desire is consecutive to the action urged by the poet. The eschatological context is unmistakable. It is the interest of the mortals that is being addressed. The poet sees himself as the conduit of the divine word and invokes the authority of the god for his discourse. The ‘good intuition’ belongs to the poet (see below). The two nouns s ə rao š a- ‘obedience’ and caiiah- ‘respect’ (or ‘attentive regard’) are derived from verbs of perception √ sru ‘listen’ and √ ci ‘perceive’. 9 Obedience and respect for the god is in effect obedience and respect for the poet and his word (hence the implied authority of the poet in Y 30.2a–b: listen to the best words that I am going to tell you! Perceive with a clear mind the two choices before your discernment!). The ‘word that is the best for mortals’ is the knowledge of the way to immortality and integrity. We will see that the eschatological horizon of the poet’s activity is also present in Y 30. The phrase nar ə\u000e m.nar ə m x v ax \u000b ii ā i tanuii ē has been interpreted in two ways. It is obviously an adverbial phrase – but which action does it modify? Gnoli"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"104 The choice( 1980 , p. 182), Insler ( 1975 , p. 33) and Kuiper ( 1978 , p. 26) relate it to ā + va ē na- ‘see’. Lommel ( 1930 , p. 221) relates it to the participle baodan \u0004 t- from ξ bud ‘be alert, awake’, as do Kellens and Pirart ( 1988 , p. 110). The adverbial, in either case, individualizes the members of the audience addressed collectively. I prefer the second reading. The emphatic, individualizing signifi cance that the phrase has seems malapropos in ‘perceive with an enlightened mind the two choices’, where ā + va ē na- has, in any case, its perfectly appropriate com-plement in suc ā mana ŋ h ā . On the other hand, the individualizing emphasis is understandable if the stake is the destiny of each person. The existential con-dition of the audience is portrayed by the phrase par ā maz ə\u000e y åŋ h ō ... baodan \u0004 t ō pait ī ‘before the great reckoning... in the expectation of (it)’. baodan \u0004 t ō pait ī literally means ‘expecting’, ‘being ready for’ or ‘being alert to’. 10 The literature on the noun y ā h- is substantial. Bartholomae ( AW , col. 1291) translates it with ‘Krise, Entscheidung, Wendepunkt’, but does not give its etymology. Lommel ( 1930 , p. 221) accepts the meaning ‘Krisis’ with some reservation. Kuiper ( 1960 , pp. 250–52), while assuming it has an eschato-logical meaning in the G ā th ā s, interprets it in the context of two Ya š t pas-sages (Yt 11.3 and Yt 13.108) as having the sense of a ‘verbal contest’. He considers this usage to be older than the supposed eschatological one. If so, one could relate it to the root ξ y ā ‘request, demand’. With some hesitation, Kuiper ( 1978 , p. 26) translates the word in Y 30.2 as ‘test’. 11 Kellens and Pirart believe that the meaning of a verbal challenge is appropriate for its occurrence in Y 46.14, but generally stay with the meaning close to its supposed etymol-ogy: ‘demande, interpellation’ (Kellens and Pirart 1990 , 293). 12 The G ā thic usage, however, points to a narrower sense: ‘Il semble bien que le y ā h g â thique soit en tout cas une sorte d’ é preuve pour les fi d è les’ (Kellens and Pirart 1991 , p. 138). Schmidt ( 1968 , pp. 177–80) derives y ā h- from ξ y ā ‘travel, race’, a term of chariot racing meaning ‘Gang’ and ‘entscheidender Gang’ and even-tually ‘Entscheidung’. Insler ( 1975 , p. 163–64) derives it from ξ y ā ‘request’ and maintains that it is a word of ‘legalistic origins’: ‘I understand y ā h - to mean “retribution”, and the word pointedly refers to the time when the truth-ful and the deceitful shall have their fair share, a repeated major theme of the G ā th ā s’. These scholars interpret G ā thic y ā h- as having an eschatological sig-nifi cance, or, at least in the case of Kellens and Pirart, the sense of a challenge to prove one’s faith. There is also a ritual interpretation of the word. Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 2, p. 121) maintains that the word is synonymous with y ā ta- ‘share’, but could also mean ‘distribution of shares’. Accordingly, he understands par ā maz ə\u000e y åŋ h ō as ‘“before the great share” (local), or: “before the great sharing (of good things)” (temporal)’. Following Narten ( 1986 , pp. 149–55), Hintze ( 2007 , pp. 130–31) translates the word as ‘appeal’. Narten ( 1986 , p. 152) argues that Y 36.2 mazi š t ā i y åŋ h ą m ‘for the greatest of the appeals’ refers either to the appeal made by the participants to the heavenly fi re to join the ritual fi re, or to the whole Hapta ŋ h ā itic ceremony. Hintze suggests that the G ā thic usage of the term may very well refer to this ceremony or, in any case,"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"The choice 105to an ‘ appeal-ceremony’. Thus in Y 30.2 ‘the expression “before the great appeal”... which used to be interpreted in an eschatological sense, could anticipate Yasna Hapta ŋ h ā iti if the traditional arrangement of the YH (Y 35–41) after the Ahunavait ī Gatha (Y 28–34) is original’ (Hintze 2007 , p. 130). She accepts Humbach’s ( 1952 , p. 18) semantic convergence of the word with maga– , understood as ritual gift-exchange: ‘ maga - and y ā h - belong to the same semantic fi eld, in which maga– , denoting the ritually enacted gift-exchange, is the more general term while y ā h- refers more precisely to the human entreaties directed to the deity’ (Hintze 2007 , p. 131). The basis of the ritual interpret-ation is the assimilation of the G ā th ā s to the Yasna Hapta ŋ h ā iti, both in concept and, it seems, in function. In my mind, the appropriateness of the assimilation is yet to be demonstrated. We do not know the ‘original’ relation (and not simply the post facto arrangement 13 ) of these two compositions. The latter is patently a liturgical text. This is not true of the former. That they are two different types of discourse is undeniable: the absence of the da ē vas in the YH is of fundamental importance. 14 The G ā thic references to the known types of ritual composition ( vahma , yasna , stut ) place the G ā th ā s in the same cultic-mythic horizon as the YH, but do not prove that the former were com-posed for liturgical usage of a similar type. A (possible) non-liturgical type of discourse would have necessarily used ‘traditional’ images and concepts, for example, those of the priestly offi ce, for (possibly) different, in part ideologic-ally determined, ends. 15 Would we not misperceive the apparently different type of ceremonial discourse if we insisted on assimilating it to the ‘trad-itional’ types on the grounds that we fi nd identical cultic references, without worrying about what these actually are in each discursive context? Rejection of the ritual interpretation of y ā h- does not mean, of course, that the eschato-logical one should be admitted just because it is generally accepted. What everyone accepts in the word is that it designates an event of vital importance. The question of the origins of the word – its etymology and the type of activity where it ‘originally’ belonged – is secondary to that of its usage when it comes to its signifi cance. The right question to ask is: how to understand the sense of urgency that is clearly present in the stanza? Let us fi rst quickly look at the (possible) answers the proponents of ritual interpret-ation may give to this question and then see what the text and the context can tell us. Kellens realized in Le panth é on that their earlier interpretation of y ā h- (Kellens and Pirart 1991 , p. 138, quoted above) is at odds with his ‘liturgical’ understanding of the G ā th ā s, whose interlocutors must be divine beings. This means that in Y 30.2, the gods are asked to make their ‘ritual choice’, one by one, before the great y ā h- ‘interpellation’, which can only be a ritual event. According to Humbach, this event should be understood as the equivalent of maga- ‘ritual gift-exchange’, or perhaps the fi nal stage of the maga- cere-mony when the actual exchange of gifts takes place. This ceremony and its fi nale are presumably a regular event, so the word maz- ‘great’ does not mark a special occurrence but signifi es a ritual-internal climax, a kind of hyperbole. Thus the gods are asked to make their ritual choice and make it known before"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"106 The choicethe climax of the ritual, which consists, according to Humbach, in mutual offering of gifts between the gods and their mortal worshippers. Either, the sense of urgency is theatrical bombast; or, the ‘gifts’ in question have a singu-lar importance; after all, we know that, generally speaking, rituals can have cosmological or eschatological functions. 16 This functional link to the extra-ritual dimension is made explicit by Hintze for y ā h- in Y 30.2 via, however, the YH. As we saw, she has the word refer either to the YH fi re-consecration, or to the YH ceremony as a whole. Hintze points out the link made between the word and vahi š ta- mi ž da- ‘best reward’ in Y 49.9, where it is said (in her trans-lation) ‘in the appeal(-ceremony) those who are yoked together with truth have yoked their beliefs (in the race) for the best prize’ (Hintze 2007 , p. 131). This passage, it is true, could as easily be interpreted eschatologically. But the important point for her is the link with the ‘best prize’. She then moves to the YH, more explicitly to Y 40.1–2 and 41.5–6. ‘The nature of the “best prize” is stated explicitly and in detail at the end of the YH. It ( mi ž da- ) is meant to benefi t both the spiritual and the material life and consists of everlasting communion with both the Wise lord and Truth (Y 40.2, 41.6). Furthermore, the “prize” includes fellowship with truthful and truth-desiring men as well as with non-violent herdsmen... The mi ž da- is given by Ahura Mazd ā to the worshippers in exchange for the “offerings” ( ā d ā - Y 40.1) presented by them in the ceremony of the Yasna Hapta ŋ h ā iti ’ (Hintze 2007 , p. 131). That the traditional (i.e. Indo-Iranian) ritual ended with a ‘demand’, made by the poet-priest on behalf of his client, for such things as fertility, long life, and prosperity is not at issue. 17 The word mi ž da- is the Iranian word for ‘reward’ both spiritual and material; its meaning seems to be context-independent, which means that its occurrence does not indicate one particular context (e.g. ritual) as opposed to another (eschatological). 18 The question is whether y ā h- in the G ā th ā s in fact refers to the YH ceremony, where the sense of urgency it has in the G ā th ā s receives its justifi cation in the vital importance of the goods exchanged. Hintze’s interpretation of the co-occurrence of y ā h- and mi ž da- in Y 49.9 is dependent on her assumption that the former refers to the YH, and does not prove it. The eschatological interpretation of y ā h- has, in my mind, a basis in the text. The infi nitive of purpose with its complement ahm ā i sazdii ā i can be analysed in only one way. The verb ξ sah ‘announce, declare’ (OP ξ θ ah ) is a transitive verb. The phrase can hardly mean, as Insler ( 1975 , p. 33) has it, ‘to declare yourselves to Him’, meaning the god, or as Kellens and Pirart ( 1988 , p. 110) have it, ‘pour qu’il se d é fi nisse’. 19 Insler’s claim that the two infi nitives sazdii ā i and sast ē derived from the verb ξ sah are ‘consistently employed medio-pas-sively in the sense “declare oneself, to announce oneself ”, with the dat. of the person addressed’ (Insler 1975 , p. 164) is not borne out by the usage. 20 The appearance of the accusative complement of an infi nitive of purpose in dative form is attested also in Y 44.17 ( sar ō i bu \u0006 ž dii ā i ), 46.12 ( raf ə δ r ā i... sast ē ) and twice in 49.3 ( ahm ā i var ə n ā i... su \u0006 idii ā i, t ̃ ka ē š ā i r ā š aiie ŋ\u000b h ē ). 21 Thus Y 30.2cc′ has to mean something like ‘in order to announce it (masculine ahm ā i referring to"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The choice 107the ‘choice’) in the expectation of the great y ā h ’. s ə\u000e n \u0004 gha- ‘declaration’ is from the same root as sazdii ā i and seems to be regularly used in the G ā th ā s with a clear eschatological valence. The ‘declaration’ (of the wrong choice) can lead to the house of druj : Y51.14cc′ y ə\u000e ı \u0002 š s ə\u000e n \u0004 gh ō ap ə\u000e m ə m dru \u0006 j ō d ə m ā n ē ā d ā t ̃ ‘the declaration that in the end will have placed them (the Karapans) in the house of druj ’. In Y 32.6, after evoking the ‘wrongs’ of Yima, the poet exclaims his wish that his ‘declaration’ is heard in the divine sphere: 6cc′ θβ ahm ī v ə\u000e mazd ā x š a θ r ō i × a š\u0004 ā .yec ā s ə\u000e n \u0004 gh ō v ī d ą m ‘let (my) declaration (of the right choice) be manifest for you in your kingdom, O Mazd ā , (for you) and for a š\u0004 a ’. 22 Now, it is precisely the choice for one or the other side that is at stake in the mytho-logical account given in Y 30.3–6. The ‘choice’ determines, as we will see, whether one will be an a š\u0004 avan or a drugvan \u0004 t and, accordingly, what kind of existence one will have upon death. The unmistakable sense of urgency that the time ‘before the great y ā h ’ has, where, in expectation of it, each person must make the fateful ‘choice’, leading either to bliss or ruination – this sense of urgency, in my mind, makes sense only if the ‘great y ā h ’ is the kind of reck-oning that bears on a whole life. Y 30.3 at ̃ t ā mainiiu \u0006 pauruii ē , y ā y ə\u000e m ā x v af ə n ā asruu ā t ə m manahic ā vacahic ā , š\u000b iiao θ an ō i h ī vahii ō ak ə mc ā å sc ā hud åŋ h ō , ə r əš v ī š\u000b ii ā t ā no ī t ̃ du ž d åŋ h ō (Behold,) then, the primordial intuitions, the twins, which are revealed by (divination through) sleep; in (realm of) thought and in (realm of) word, (as well as) in (realm of) action, the two (thoughts, etc. are) one good and one bad: the benevolent ones choose rightly from these two (thoughts, speeches, actions), (but) not the malevolent ones. The fi rst two verse lines of this stanza have ever been a topic of controversy. Every word in these two verse lines gives itself to more than one grammatical assignment; and, as far as I know, fi ve basic syntactic arrangements have been proposed by scholars, some more plausible than others. Before Kellens and Pirart ( 1988 , p. 110) proposed to read t ā mainiiu \u0006 in the accusative, it was generally understood as nominative. Insler ( 1975 , p. 33) translates 3aa′: ‘Yes, there are two fundamental spirits, twins which are renowned to be in confl ict’. Gnoli ( 1980 , p. 207) translates: ‘In the beginning the two Spirits who are twins were perceived in a dream’. Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 123) gives for 3a-b′: ‘These (are) the two spirits (present) in the primal (stage of one’s existence), twins who have become famed (manifest-ing themselves as) the two (kinds of) dreams, the two (kinds of) thoughts and words, (and) the two (kinds of) actions, the better and the evil’. Insler’s and Humbach’s translations are problematic. The (demonstrative) pronoun t ā can correlate with y ā (as in Gnoli’s) or refer to an antecedent, but it can-not mean ‘there are’ as in Insler’s translation. In Humbach’s text, one is not certain whether the pronoun (‘These’) refers, as a demonstrative pronoun,"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"108 The choiceto the two spirits – presenting them to the audience, which would be rather awkward given the nature of the object of the presentation 23 – or to an ante-cedent, which, given the context, can only be the ‘two choices’ from the pre-vious stanza. This latter possibility cannot be dismissed. Gnoli’s translation is quite plausible if we make three adjustments. The adverb of time ‘in the beginning’ does not relate to asruu ā t ə m (i.e. it is not the dream that is inaug-ural!) but places the two spirits in primordial times; 24 the aorist verb does not signify past tense but presents the action it denotes from the outside, reduced to a fact; and x v af ə n ā cannot be read ‘in a dream’ as if a particular event is meant, but ‘by dream’, i.e. dream as a means of gaining (a special kind of) knowledge. Thus, in Gnoli’s scheme, the fi rst verse line should be understood as something like: ‘the two Spirits of the primordial times who are twins are perceived by dream’. It is hard to see, however, what role at ̃ may be given in Gnoli’s text, since the sentence has nothing exclamatory about it. at ̃ could also signify continuation or resumption of a thought across stanzas (e.g. Y 34.2, 3, 43.10), but the inaugural nature of the translated sentence rules this out. And it cannot have, in Gnoli’s scheme, either an emphatic value or a disjunctive value: when the article has any of these roles, the theme persists across the stanzas and the particle is used to signal, in the fi rst case, a signifi -cant development, a conclusion (e.g. Y 31.10, 34.14), and, in the second, a noteworthy change (e.g. of protagonist: Y 43.8). Kellens and Pirart revisited the stanza in their article ‘La strophe des jumeaux’ ( 1997 ) and inventoried various points of controversy, whether syn-tactic or semantic, and, with two caveats, reaffi rmed their translation in Les textes vieil–avestiques ( 1988 , p. 110): ‘(Je vais dire aussi) les deux é tats d’esprit fondamentaux qui sont connus pour ê tre des songes jumeaux lors de la pens é e et de la parole. Lors de l’acte (rituel), ce sont le meilleur (acte) et le mauvais (acte). Entre ces deux ( é tats d’esprit), les g é n é reux distinguent bien, non les avares.’ According to their compte-rendu in ‘La strophe’ (Kellens and Pirart 1997 , pp. 37–38), there are three morphological ambiguities bearing on the forms of paouruii ē (nom. acc. dual or loc. dual?), manahi ° vacahi ° š\u000b iiao θ an ō i (nom. acc. dual or loc. sing.?), and x v af ə n ā (nom. acc. dual or inst. sing.?). There is, further, the question of how to understand 3a–b′ syntactically. Is 3a′ a subordinated relative clause? What is h ī in form and value (Kellens and Pirart 1997 , pp. 43–50)? In ‘La strophe’, they prefer to read vax š ii ā ‘I am going to say or speak’ (the verb of the main clause, according to them, by per-sistence from 30.1a) as directly governing the relative clause, too (Kellens and Pirart 1997 , p. 50): ‘il est possible et peut- ê tre necessaire d’accorder à la rela-tive la fonction d’un second accusatif: “je vais dire des deux mainiiu \u0006 premiers qu’ils ont é t é entendus...”’. Also, h ī is an enclitic pronoun (nom. dual) and as such it should take the second position in the sentence. What does it refer to? Finally, there are semantic ambiguities with regard to fi ve terms (Kellens and Pirart 1997 , pp. 60–61): mainiiu- (is it a mythic entity or a human/divine fac-ulty?), paouruuia- (understood in a temporal or a hierarchical sense?), y ə\u000e ma- (understood in a literal or a metaphorical sense?), x v af ə na- (characterization"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"The choice 109of the two intuitions, extension of the ritual triad of thought, speech, gesture, or the means of knowledge governed by asruu ā t ə m ?), asruu ā t ə m (understood in past or present tense?). The pronoun h ī has always been a thorn in the side of translators. As far as I can see, Humbach, taking ‘dream’ as an extension of thought, speech and action (all in the nom. dual), translates 3a-b′ as if h ī did not exist (Humbach 1991 , vol. 1, p. 123). So too does Lommel ( 1971 , 41): ‘Und diese beiden ersten Geister, welche als Zwillinge durch einen Traum vernommen wurden, sind ja im Denken, Reden und Handeln das Bessere und das Schlechte’. Perhaps they think the pronoun has an emphasizing role. Gnoli ( 1980 , 207), following Gershevitch ( 1964 , p. 32), interprets the pronoun as a gen. dual referring to mainiiu \u0006 , ‘their ways of thinking, speaking and acting are two: the good and the bad’. Gershevitch later comes to think that h ī is an acc. masc. dual pro-noun ‘resumptive’ of the ‘two spirits’ and speculates that the ‘resumption... would to native listeners have been very welcome because the h ī , prevented the Old Iranian enclitic syntax from referring to the noun to which it is attached if the latter stands in the same case, number and gender, would force them to recognise in it an accusative which was masculine and not neuter, and thereby to direct their minds back to the two spirits’ (Gershevitch 1995 , p. 17). Insler ( 1975 , p. 33), too, makes the pronoun masculine, but a nominative one, referring to the two spirits: ‘In thought and in word, in action, they are two: the good and the bad’. Since the pronoun, according to its form (cf. Beekes 1988 , p. 139), is a neuter (or feminine), it cannot have mainiiu- as ante-cedent (contra Panaino 2004b , p. 119). Y 30.3b′ ak ə m o must thus be a neuter adjective, and not – the other formal possibility – masculine in the accusative. The pronoun h ī refers to a neuter antecedent. Kellens and Pirart ( 1997 , pp. 50–51) suggest for the antecedent of the pro-noun three possibilities: varana- , srauuah- , and the joined manah- and vacah- . The second one can be set aside since it requires the implausible development of the ‘account of the two intuitions’ ( srauuah- ‘account’) into the ‘two accounts’. The fi rst and the third options seem possible within their syntactic scheme. Although the immediate context perhaps favours the third one, the syntax seems to speak for the fi rst. In their earlier translation, Kellens and Pirart ( 1988 , p. 110) in effect render 3b′: ‘in the moment of ritual gesture, the two ritual gestures are the good one and the bad one’. The locative of time, which describes the circumstance (of the event), seems redundant, since in their view š\u000b iiao θ ana- ‘enactment’ is per se ‘ritual gesture’. The restriction by way of the locative is thus awkward. Now, if one goes with the third possibil-ity they propose in ‘La strophe des jumeaux’ ( 1997 ), the sense of 3b′ would be something like ‘in action, however, thought and speech reveal themselves to be the good one and the bad one’. The two qualifying neuter terms vahiia- ‘better’ and aka- ‘bad’ are in the singular, whereas one would expect them to be in the dual if each were modifying the subject, ‘thought and speech’. If we took varana- ‘choice’ as the antecedent of the pronoun we would have: ‘in action, the two choices reveal themselves to be the good one and the bad"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"110 The choiceone’. Note that it cannot be said that it is (only) in action that the choice can be bad or good, but that it reveals itself to be good or bad in action. The choice is obviously fi rst and foremost a mental event. It is also a phenomenon of speech. One can choose to speak truthfully or deceitfully. But ‘deception’ is, if not a mere imputation, something that is only revealed ‘in action’. In the latter case, one may act in such a way that belies one’s claim to truthful-ness. Hence, whether ‘choice’ or ‘thought and speech’, the context has to be understood in such a way that it would make sense to say that as opposed to the realms of thought and speech the realm of action ‘reveals’ one’s inten-tions (or claims), where they may then be qualifi ed as bad or good. One has to admit that this opposition between indeterminable thought and word on the one hand and revelatory action on the other hand is out of place in ritual. Kellens and Pirart’s hermeneutic scheme cannot be placed in the ritual sphere, to which they are nonetheless committed. So, which one, ‘choice’ or ‘thought and speech’, is better suited for their syntactic scheme? It seems to me that beside the syntax of 3b′ the sense of the two statements contained in 3a–b′ favours ‘choice’. If we take 3b′ as an independent phrase then 3a–b consists of an accusative phrase qualifi ed by a relative clause. Kellens and Pirart ( 1988 , 110) take paouruii ē as an acc. dual of the adjective paouruiia- ‘former, fi rst’ (cf. Sanskrit pu \u0006 rvy á - ‘ancient, former’), whose expected form is *paouruii ā . 25 According to Hintze ( 2007 , pp. 112–13) this is improbable since the ending –ii ā is regularly present in the Older Avesta, and so she fi nds the assumption of a ‘graphic aberration’ –ii ē unconvincing. Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 123) reads it as a locative, and understands it in the attributive sense (Humbach 1991 , vol. 2, p. 48). If paouruii ē is a locative, it can hardly be taken in the attributive sense, since paouruiia- is never a substantive in the G ā th ā s. It would have to represent an elliptical phrase, e.g. primordial creation. Hintze ( 2007 , pp. 112–13), follow-ing Narten ( 1986 , p. 139), reads Y 36.1 paouruii ē as a loc. sing., and main-tains that it is used adverbially in the YH text. If this were the case, in Y 30.3 one would have to take t ā mainiiu \u0006 in the nominative, so that the adver-bial paouruii ē ‘in the beginnings’ would bear on the elliptical verb ‘be’ rather than on ξ sru ‘hear’: ‘these twin intuitions (exist) in the beginnings, which are revealed’, etc. For reasons that become apparent below, this is not a plaus-ible syntactic analysis of Y 30.3aa′. The simplest solution is to read paouruii ē as an acc. dual adjective (with de Vaan 2003 , p. 423, and Kellens and Pirart 1997 , p. 61). The ending –ii ā (along with –iia ) is regularly rendered –iie in the Young Avestan texts (see Hoffmann and Forssman 2004 , p. 85). The assumption of a Young Avestan infl uence on the morphology of a supposed *paouruii ā is dismissed by Narten and Hintze as ad hoc, since this would be the only case of such an infl uence for a –ii ā ending in the G ā th ā s (Narten 1986 , p. 139; Hintze 2007 , p. 112). Be that as it may, it is impossible to read Y 44.19 + paouruii ē in any role other than nom. sing. f., that is, for *paouruii ā . If so, we have to accept paouruii ē as the G ā thic graphic form of *paouruii ā , e.g. of nom. acc. dual *paouruii ā ."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"The choice 111 Thus, in accordance with Kellens and Pirart’s scheme, one could translate Y 30.3a–b in this way: ‘I am going to speak about the two primordial intui-tions that are famed as twin dreams in thought and speech’. 26 The a that is attached to the verb ( asruu ā t ə m ) should probably be understood as the post-positive emphatic particle ā (so Insler 1975 , p. 165), since the augment is very rarely attested in the G ā th ā s. The adjective ‘twin’ ( y ə\u000e m ā ) is supposed to imply a state of indistinction. If we take 3b′ as having a contrastive value, one may perhaps speculate that the use of the word ‘dream’ ( x v af ə n ā ) for describing the two primordial intuitions has to do with the fact that dreams are inscrut-able: one cannot perceptually inspect a dream image, unlike objects in the perceptual fi eld. Whether the phrase y ə\u000e m ā x v af ə n ā is taken as an instrumen-tal governed by asruu ā t ə m or as an attributive in the nominative, it describes the two intuitions as these are known in ‘legend’ ( y ā y ə\u000e m ā x v af ə n ā asruu ā t ə m ‘that are famed as the twin dreams’ or ‘famed for being the twin dreams’). Thus, in Kellens and Pirart’s scheme, one would get something like: ‘the two intuitions that are famed for being the twin dreams in thought and in speech’. Kellens and Pirart ( 1990 , p. 41) prefer to take the locative terms manahi(c ā ) vacahic ā in the sense of ‘in the moment of thinking and speaking’ (‘locatif libre de temps’), because they think that G ā thic ‘thought’, ‘word’ and ‘action’ are always ritual. As I said, their hermeneutic scheme is hardly compatible with this assumption. The whole idea of a progression of the ‘state of the mind’ in stages from dream through thought and speech to the manifest real-ity of action, if these terms are understood in the context of ritual, must be illusory. Surely, speech is as manifest as gesture in sacrifi ce, and if the latter could be good or bad (i.e. correct or incorrect), so can the former. Why could not the correct and the incorrect ritual speeches be distinguished from one another? The same goes for ‘ritual’ thought: it is, after all, the ‘undeceivable god’ (Y 45.4 n ō it ̃ di β ž aidii ā i ‘not to be deceived’) for whom the priest stages the sacrifi ce. If one accepts the basic syntactic scheme of the two scholars, the locative terms may be plausibly interpreted as the poet’s gloss on the legendary char-acterization of the primordial intuitions. Thus Y 30.3a–b can be translated as follows: ‘(I will also speak about) the two primordial intuitions that are famed as twin dreams, that is, in respect of thought and speech’. The gloss presents the primordial situation in terms relevant to practical contexts. The two intui-tions are indistinguishable in the thought and speech they inspire because these are inscrutable as to their real value. Truthful thought and truthful speech are for the moment mere claims. In the previous stanza (Y 30.2) the poet had already called on his audience’s power of distinction ( v ī ci θ a- ) and vigilance in making their choice ( ā uuar ə na- ), really, in taking sides. Now, with his gloss, he would be putting things again in that perspective; in it, one might conjecture, the poet counsels vigilance: ‘beware, in thought and speech one is liable to confusion between the two intuitions’. For his audience the primordial intui-tions are present as the fundamental decision or ‘choice’ ( varana- ) each makes for one side or the other. Where the most vital question is answered, namely"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"112 The choicethat of good life and immortality, the actions inspired by the two intuitions decide everything (cf. Y 32.5 and 42.5). The choice of the good intuition is the good choice and the choice of the bad one the bad. In action, in taking sides, the basic choice ( varana- ) reveals itself as good or bad. One may, then, translate Y 30.3a–b′ as follows: ‘(I will also speak about) the two primor-dial intuitions that are famed as twin dreams, (that is), in respect of thought and speech. In action, (however) the two (choices show themselves to be) the good one and the bad one.’ One has to set aside the ritualistic framework of interpretation. This translation, which, I think, is the best one can do with the basic param-eters proposed by Kellens and Pirart, is not, however, satisfactory. There are three problems with it. The supposed antecedent of h ī is not present in the text, unless one assumes the neuter * ā uuar ə nah- as the base of ā uuar ə n å in Y 30.2b, which is ruled out even by Kellens and Pirart themselves in favour of the masculine ā uuar ə na- . But there is a more serious diffi culty. The stanza begins by emphatically drawing attention to the two intuitions. Should the pronoun refer to an antecedent beyond its immediate context (i.e. to the two choices rather than the two intuitions), one would expect a formal indication of the change of focus. There is no sign that the thematic boundaries set by the fi rst and the last verse lines are breached in the middle verse. Hence, given this factor and the fact that, as to its form, h ī can only refer to a dual feminine or neuter antecedent, we are left with only the three neuter nouns present in the verse itself. This also means that the three nouns cannot be in the nomina-tive since this would make the pronoun redundant. That the two intuitions should be characterized as ‘dream’ or ‘sleep’ is strange, whether the phrase is rendered ‘twin spirits famed as two dreams’ or ‘two spirits famed for being twin dreams’ or ‘twin spirits famed for their sleep’. I do not fi nd Insler’s ( 1975 , p. 165) attempt to produce an alternative meaning for x v af ə na- convincing. He translates the word as ‘rivalry’ from a supposed IIr. * svapni- ‘rivalry’ and unrelated to Vedic sv á pna- ‘sleep’. The two passages from the R \u0003 gveda he cites to support his proposed word, however, are not probative. It is not clear to me why Insler thinks the meaning ‘ill rivalry’ for dus \u0004 v á pnya- fi ts RV VIII 47.14ab better than ‘nightmare’, which is the usual translation (e.g. Geldner: ‘b ö ser Traum’): y á c ca g ó s \u0004 u dus \u0004 v á pnyam \r y á c c ā sm é ‘what nightmare exists among our cattle and among ourselves’. In fact, the context (14–17) makes the meaning ‘nightmare’ quite acceptable, more fi tting, in any case, than ‘ill rivalry’, since in the subsequent lines (15–17) the speak-ers ‘consign whatever nightmare’ ( dus \u0004 v á pnyam \r sarvam... pari dadmasy [15] or sam \r nay ā masy [17]) to Trita Aptya; and more signifi cantly in 16 the god-dess Dawn, with Trita and Dvita, is asked to ‘carry away the nightmare’ ( us \u0004 o dus \u0004 v á pnyam \r vaha ). 27 Insler’s IIr. * svapni- ‘rivalry’ simply has no secure basis. Gershevitch’s ( 1995 , pp. 17–18) solution of replacing ‘sleep’ with ‘endowed-with-own-motivation’ or ‘moving (in the sense of behaving) on his own, inde-pendently of the other’, amounting to ‘free will’, is tendentious. He analyses x v af ə na- as x v a–pn–a (a possessive compound?) with x v a meaning self or own"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"The choice 113and built on the zero grade of the root p(h)an found in Vedic. But this root is not attested in Avestan. Besides, even if the basic meaning of ‘self-moving’ is granted, we are still far from the ‘free will’ desired by Gershevitch. The ‘two self-moving primordial spirits’ can mean no more than the ‘two independent primordial spirits’, and this says no more than the ‘two primordial spirits’, the primordial two. Bartholomae’s ‘durch ein Traumgesicht’ (in Kellens and Pirart 1997 , pp. 38–39) and Gnoli’s ‘in a dream’ ( 1980 , p. 207) are basically right. As I said above, x v af ə n ā is best interpreted as an instrumental of means governed by asruu ā t ə m . The idea that sleep and dreams can be a gateway to the beyond or to the beginnings, a kind of second sight, is widespread in the ancient world. In Br \u0005 had ā ran \u0004 yaka Upanis \u0004 ad 4.3.7–9, the ‘self ’ is described as ‘remaining ever the same... having fallen asleep, he transcends this world’. Sleep is a ‘third twi-light state’ of consciousness. ‘Standing in this twilight state, he sees the [other] two, that of this world and that of the other world. Now, however, when he approaches the state [of consciousness] of the other world, he fares forth [toward it] and descries both evil and joyful things’ (Zaehner 1992 , p. 82). In archaic Greece, both ‘mythically and historically, the divinatory procedure of incubation, “the most ancient form of divination”, seems to have been espe-cially highly valued’ (Detienne 1999 , p. 63, the cited phrase is from Plutarch). Divination through sleep, as Detienne shows, is fi rmly embedded in the pre-classical Greek culture where mantic cognition was the privileged form of knowledge, since it alone gave access to the ‘true’ source of worldly events. In its poetico-religious role, Al ē theia ‘truth’, just as much as ‘memory’, was both the means of acquiring mantic knowledge and the basis of the poetic speech that directly embodied the power of the beyond. By ‘reciting the myth of emergence’ in his Theogony , Hesiod collaborates ‘in setting the world in order’ (Detienne 1999 , p. 45). 28 This knowledge was the reserve of certain social types: the inspired poet, the diviner and the king of justice. The mantic know-ledge of these fi gures was ‘a form of divinatory omniscience. The formula defi ning their powers was the same; it was knowledge of “all things that were, things to come and things past”. For the poet, remembrance came through a personal vision that ensured direct access to the events his memory evoked. His privilege was to enter into contact with the other world, and his memory granted him the power to “decipher the invisible”... It [i.e. memory] was... a religious power that gave poetic pronouncements their status of magicoreli-gious speech’ (Detienne 1999 , pp. 42–43). Just like his twin brother Thanatos ‘Death’, Hypnos ‘Sleep’ is an entering into the world beyond. The procedure for incubatory consultation with Trophonius the Nurturer at Lebadaea per-fectly expresses the link between memory, sleep and death in respect of man-tic knowledge. ‘Before entering the oracle’s cave, the person who has come to consult it drinks from the springs of L ē th ē and Mn ē mosyn ē . When he drinks the water of L ē th ē , he becomes like a dead person, but through the water of Mn ē mosyn ē , which works as an antidote to L ē th ē , he retains the privilege of remembering everything and thus acquires the ability to see and hear in a"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"114 The choiceworld where ordinary mortals can no longer do so’ (Detienne 1999 , p. 84). 29 In ancient India, too, the inspired poets had a privileged access, in the form of visions and words, to things divine and the realm beyond time; and there, too, their effi cacious speech carried the power of truth, especially valued for its ability to restore life beyond death. 30 In the G ā th ā s, mainiiu- seems to be the means of access to the divine sphere. It is the faculty of intuition of the ‘true’ sources of earthly life and, as such, embodies the power of these sources. Thus the idea that sleep or dream can be a means of revelation of divine things and primordial conditions is completely at home in the ancient world and in the Indo-European context. If x v af ə n ā is read in the instrumen-tal, y ə\u000e m ā ‘twin’ will have to be the epithet of mainiiu \u0006 . We may translate Y 30.3 aa′: ‘(Behold) then the primordial intuitions, the twins, which are revealed by (divination through) sleep’. The epithet perhaps signifi es that the two intui-tions are equally ‘primordial’, hence independent from each other, and not necessarily that they are of common origins – although, obviously, this can-not be ruled out. In any case, despite the wishes of the enthusiasts of G ā thic monotheism, the question whether Mazd ā is the progenitor of the twins fi nds no answer in this stanza. Whether the main verb of the fi rst verse is vax š ii ā ‘I am going to talk about’ from the fi rst stanza or auua ē nat ā ‘behold’ from the second is hard to determine. I prefer the latter because I see no reason to bypass it for the former. Besides, the dual object of ‘behold’ in Y 30.2, namely ‘the two choices’, seems to be extended in some sense in the theme of ‘the two intuitions’, and thus the particle at ̃ may be understood as signalling the per-sistence of the verb auua ē nat ā . ‘Behold the two choices... (behold) then the two intuitions (that fi rst made those two choices)!’ Y 30.3bb′ must be an independent sentence. The priestly exegetical trad-ition, as it appears in Pahlavi and Sanskrit translations of the verse line, 31 and a number of Western scholars understand it as a parenthetical state-ment. Bartholomae integrates it with the fi rst verse line: ‘Die beiden Geister zu Anfang... (sind) das Bessere und das B ö se in Gedanken, Wort und Tat’ (in Kellens and Pirart 1997 , pp. 38–39), and reads the triad thought, speech and action in the locative. Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 123), too, reads the two verses 3a-b′ as a unit, and the triad in the nominative. Insler ( 1975 , p. 33) translates: ‘In thought and in word, in action, they are two: the good and the bad’, with h ī in the nominative masculine, referring to the two intuitions. I have already given my reasons why I think Y 30.3bb′ should be understood as an independent sentence. The fi rst p ā da has one extra syllable; so, Monna ( 1978 , p. 17) and Kellens and Pirart ( 1988 , p. 110) remove the fi rst c ā . As we have seen, Kellens and Pirart read 30.3b with 30.3aa′. Their reason for break-ing up the verse is that ‘le pronom enclitique du vieil-avestique g â thique est un indicateur d’initialit é . Il suit n é cessairement et sans aucune exception le pre-mier mot d’une proposition... D è s lors, š\u000b iiao θ an ō i est n é cessairement le pre-mier mot d’une ind é pendante’ (Kellens and Pirart 1997 , pp. 47–48). In fact, however, the authors go on in a footnote (no. 26) to qualify this statement with a list of ‘deviations’ variously accounted for (see below). Kellens and"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"The choice 115Pirart maintain that what gives philology (and, in the event, the translation of the Avesta) scientifi c status are the more or less general rules. These rules block out ideological interferences and the temptation to subject the ancient text to the requirements of ‘good sense’, which is necessarily our sense. In their translation of the Old Avestan texts, they consistently use another ‘rule’ they think they discover in the work of Klein. This rule, too, has to do with syntax. Les relev è s de Klein pour la R \u0003 S et ceux de Pirart pour le vieil-avestique montrent sans ambiguit é que, dans une coordination à trois é l é ments, il n’y a que quatre dispositions possible de la particule o c ā : avec chaque é l é- ment (Ac ā Bc ā Cc ā ), avec les deux derniers (ABc ā Cc ā ), avec le dernier seul (ABCc ā ) et avec le premier seul (Ac ā BC). La confi guration Ac ā BCc ā doit ê tre consid é r é e comme exclue (Klein, DGR I, 207). (Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 9) By the same token, ABc ā C and Ac ā Bc ā C should be ruled out. It would seem, then, that the reading of bb′ as an independent sentence contravenes not only the ‘rule’ about the position of the enclitic but also that of coordin-ation by means of the coordinating particle c ā . Kellens and Pirart’s representation of Klein’s fi ndings is not quite correct, however. These are the relevant observations of Klein ( 1985 , vol. 1): There are six passages in which ca follows each term of a conjoined set consisting of three members. Three of these are from the Tenth Man \u0004 d \u0005 ala and represent the beginnings of the tendency seen in later Sanskrit to construct elaborate seriations involving ca [p. 162, my italics]. [...] Semantically, the X ca Y ca Z ca passages fall into the same general categories which we have already seen elsewhere [p. 163, the categories are antonymous, complementary, synonymous terms, units of time, proper names: cf. Klein 1985 . vol. 1, pp. 141–52]. [...] The residual group in which ca appears most frequently consists of eight passages of the type (W) X Y ca Z ca [p. 195, my italics]. Next in frequency among the residual ca syntagms is the type X 1 ... X n-1 ca X n in which the particle occurs a single time between the penultimate and fi nal member of a series consisting of at least three terms. Six of these show the confi guration (W) X Y ca / Z with an X Y ca construction in one p ā da and additional term in a subsequent p ā da... the sequence X / Y ca Z is seen only twice . [...] Four additional passages show an entire three-term sequence within a single p ā da and in two the sequences is spread over three p ā das with one term in each [p. 198, my italics]. A third residual syntagm attested in fi ve"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"116 The choicepassages is W ca X ca Y (Z)... all three metrical possibilities for three-term sequence are encountered: X ca Y ca Z, X ca Y ca / Z, and X ca / Y ca Z; predictably, the second type is the most frequent... [...] In virtually every instance a semantic or formulaic basis can be found for analyzing the sequence into smaller components, yet in each case the terms seem to represent an integral series of conjoined subjects or objects [p. 205, my italics]. [...] In three passages X ca Y Z ca appears [p. 207, my italics]. The only possible position of ca within three-term structures not so far observed is X ca Y Z. There is one passage which can be categorized in this way [p. 208, my italics]. And there are eighteen passages containing X Y Z ca pattern (Klein 1985 . vol. 1, pp. 86ff.). Proportionally, the number of occurrences of the patterns allowed by Kellens and Pirart’s rule is only slightly larger than that of those disallowed by their rule. The pattern ABc ā C excluded by their ‘rule’ has the highest number of occurrences after ABCc ā . Moreover, as can be expected with any syntactic rule, the integrating function of the coordinating particle interacts/combines with other factors of (sub-clausal) cohesion, in particu-lar metrical and semantic (cf. Klein 1985 , vol. 1, pp. 151–53). Lexical (and phrasal) integration by means of the coordinating particle is especially sen-sitive to p ā da and verse boundaries and to semantically signifi cant combin-ations, e.g. complementary terms, etc. Another way of putting it is to say that the poetic and formulaic structures are determining factors in the actual usages made of the coordinating particle. There are no such things as excep-tionless syntactic rules that are automatically applied. As for the ‘rule’ of the obligatory second positioning of the enclitic in the sentence, it, too, interacts with poetic and formulaic factors. Kellens and Pirart themselves mention a few of these: Les mots coordonn é s ou en asynd è te peuvent ê tre accompagn é s, comme en v é dique, de la r é p é tition d’un pronom enclitique (Y 36.4, 38.5, 48.6). Il est aussi possible que le pronom enclitique ne soit pr é sent que la second fois (36.2,5). Un fais formulaire (r é p é tition d’une formule fi g é e ou toute faite) peut d é roger à la r è gle. (Kellens and Pirart 1997 , p. 48 no. 26) Now, our verse line (Y 30.3bb′) can readily be classifi ed under either of these last two ‘exceptions’. The triad of thought, speech and action may cer-tainly be understood as a (doctrinal) formulaic unit in the G ā th ā s. This could have encouraged the elliptical construction we see in the verse where the syn-tagm h ī vahii ō ak ə mc ā applies to each of the triad members. In other words, the syntagm is suppressed in the case of the fi rst two members but clearly"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"The choice 117implied by dint of their formulaic bond (and identical doctrinal status) with the last. Thus, in full propositional form, Y 30.3bb′ should read: *manah ī h ī vahii ō ak ə mc ā vacah ī h ī vahii ō ak ə mc ā š\u000b iiao θ an ō i h ī vahii ō ak ə mc ā ‘in area of thought, two (kinds), the good one and the bad one; in area of speech, two (kinds), the good one and the bad one; in area of action, two (kinds), the good one and the bad one’. 32 This formula puts the matter in the perspective of the present, which does not mean that the terms have no mythological sta-tus. ‘Bad thought’, ‘bad speech’ and ‘(bad) action’ take part in the ‘deception’ of the da ē vas in Y 32.5. In the G ā th ā s, it is always in respect of one of these (thought, speech, action) that the ‘choice’ is pressed on the mortal, and that the ‘choice’ of the da ē vas is condemned and that of the ‘benevolent’ gods or mortals is commended; mainiiu- is the object of ‘choice’ only for the inspired poet (Y 43.16). The last verse of the stanza should be straightforward since its syn-tax is clear. Nonetheless, most of the translators are, I think, incorrect in their understanding of the semantics of the verb v ī š\u000b ii ā t ā . Lommel ( 1971 , p. 41) translates: ‘zwischen diesen beiden haben die Rechthandelnden rich-tig entschieden, nicht die Schlechthandelnden’. Bartholomae ( AW , col. 441) gives two equivalent translations of the verb v ī + ξ ci + ə r əš in the mid-dle voice: ‘sich richtige entscheiden, die richtige Wahl treffen zwischen’. Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 123) translates the verse: ‘And between these two, the munifi cent discriminate rightly, (but) not the miserly’. Kellens and Pirart ( 1988 , p. 110) give: ‘Entre ces deux ( é tats d’esprit), les g é n é reux distinguent bien, non les avares’. Insler ( 1975 , 33) has: ‘And between these two, the ben-efi cent have correctly chosen, not the malefi cent’. Insler’s and Bartholomae’s are closer to what I consider to be the right meaning: the verb v ī + ξ ci ‘set apart’ plus the adverb ə r əš ‘rightly’ does not mean ‘correctly distinguish (between)’ but ‘rightly pick (from)’. In a number of passages the verb v ī + ξ ci means ‘discern’, with an internal/implied object or two accusatives. But, contrary to Kellens and Pirart’s assertion ( 1991 , p. 204), its government does not require two accusatives. It so happens that for the (ideological) purpose of expressing a comprehensive and antagonistic set, dualistic complement is privileged. The dualistic complement presents the authoritative distinction: the two that matter. The one who does v ī + ξ ci + two accusatives A and B does not ‘distinguish between A and B’ but ‘sets apart, singles out, A and B’, i.e. discerns A as well as B. In Y 31.5aa′ tat ̃ m ō i v ī cidii ā i vaoc ā , hiiat ̃ m ō i a š\u0004 ā d ā t ā vahii ō ‘tell me the bet-ter (rule) that you have established for me for the reason of a š\u0004 a so that I may discern (it)’, the infi nitive ‘to discern’ has one direct object: from a set of rules, tell me the one that is best for attaining a š\u0004 a so that I can discern it, pick it. 33 Y 49.6 fr ō v å fra ē š ii ā , mazd ā a š\u0004ə mc ā mru \u0006 it ē y ā v ə\u000e xrat ə\u000e u š , x š m ā kahii ā ā .mana ŋ h ā ə r əš v ī cidii ā i, ya θ ā ī sr ā uuaiia ē m ā t ą m da ē n ą m, y ā x š m ā uuat ō ahur ā"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"118 The choice I urge you, O Mazd ā and a š\u0004 a , to express your intentions (or insights), which (are those) of your resourcefulness, so that we could make them heard for the purpose of correctly discerning the da ē n ā that belongs among your kind, O Ahura.

One can also set apart, discern, one item from a group. In fact, this is the basic meaning of the verb. One goes wrong when one reads the implied dualistic set into the semantics of the verb as such: because the ideologically constructed set contains two elements, recognizing both one and the other is the same as distinguishing between them. But this latter sense is superfi cial, owing to the particularly signifi cant pairs, i.e. an antonymous pair. There may be other types in the set too (cf. Y 33.1), but what is of vital importance is the recognition of the a š\u0004 avan and the drugvan \u0004 t (cf. Y 46.5–6).

If Kellens and Pirart were right about the government of the verb, the dual pronoun should have been in the accusative. In effect, the verse line says: among the two terms from each set the benevolent picks the right one; the necessarily single object of picking is internal to the verb. Here too we fi nd that the set is signifi cantly dualistic. The failure of the malevolent is not ‘incorrectly distinguishing between’ the two terms but ‘not picking the right one’, which is tantamount to choosing the bad one. Such is the logic of the dualism. The verb v ī š\u000b ii ā t ā is an injunctive aorist. The process denoted by the verb is viewed externally as a fact. It expresses something about the two subjects, namely their relation to the verbal idea. The circumstances of the action are a matter of indifference. Traditionally and in Western scholarship, the emphatic dual pronoun å sc ā is understood to refer to the two intuitions (cf. Panaino 2004b , pp. 107–109). As to its form, the genitive pronoun can be masculine, feminine or neuter. However, as far as the syntax is concerned, there is no basis to think that its antecedent is not ‘the two’ thoughts, etc. of the preceding verse line. Every time the object of the ‘choice’ of the mortals or immortals is explicitly stated, even for the primordial intuitions themselves (Y 30.5), it is always one of the triad and never ‘intuition’. The traditional interpretation of the genitive dual pronoun aii å in 30.6 as referring to the two intuitions relies on the like inter-pretation of this stanza.

Then, he articulates the dimensions where the choice is operative, namely in thought, word and action. Finally, he says the benevolent chooses the good alternative of the respective sets (good thinking, good speech, good action), and the malevo-lent the bad alternative. In Y 30.6 the da ē vas choose the worst thought. In the G ā th ā s, the gods or mortals always choose between good and bad thoughts, etc. – never between the two primordial intuitions – and are accordingly praised or repudiated. The epithets hud ā h- and du ž d ā h- in Y 30.3cc′ do not necessarily refer to divine beings, contra Kellens and Pirart ( 1991 , p. 47). The context (Y 30.2) in fact inclines one to think that they include both categories. The possessive adjective hud ā h- < hu + da ˀ ah- cannot mean generous, i.e. ‘who has many gifts’, but ‘who gives good things’ and is thus benevolent or benefi -cent (so de Vaan 2003 , p. 430). This shows, again, that the condemnation of the ‘malevolent’ is not aimed at the failure to distinguish between correct and incorrect ritual doctrines, but at picking the bad alternative of the dual sets (thought, word, action) and thus becoming malevolent.

There are two ways of translating Y 30.4a–b. One can make hiiat ̃ a relative pronoun introducing an independent statement, which, by way of an elliptical anaphoric pronoun, is the subject of dazd ē ga ē mc ā ajii ā t ī mc ā ‘constitutes life and ruination’.

So one can translate: ‘And so, (the fact) that the two intuitions confront each other originally constitutes life and ruination’. The fact that these two intuitions exist and are active in the same domain is responsible for the worldly condition where there is both life and ruination. The fact of their coming together produces the present condition of existence. One can also read hiiat ̃ as the relative adverb ‘when’ heading a subordin-ate clause.

In this scheme it makes better sense, I think, to have the adverb paouruu ī m ‘origin-ally’ modify h ə\u000e m... jasa ē t ə m ‘confront each other’. The event of their con-frontation is primordial and prompts each to produce its kindred condition (as a weapon?). Insler’s ( 1975 , pp. 166–67) analysis of the two verbs is mis-taken: ‘ dazd ē must be 3du. imperf. (or perf.) of d ā , fully parallel to the pre-ceding jasa ē t ə m ’ (Insler 1975 , p. 166). The former is a sing. ind. present and the latter a dual inj. present (see Kellens and Pirart 1991 , p. 45 and Humbach 1991 , vol. 2, pp. 49–50). The o c ā attached to ya θ ā in 4b′ should probably be removed in view of the excessive syllable. Y 30.4b′–c′ would then be a completive clause: ‘in such a way that in the end the worst existence will be (that) of the drugvan \u0004 ts , but (that of) the best mind (will be) for the a š\u0004 avan ’. Otherwise 4 b′–c′ would be a subordinate clause, introduced by a relative adverb ( ya θ ā c ā ) and coordi-nated with the two conditions stated in Y 30.4b: ‘and how in the end existence will be: the worst one (will be that) of the drugvan \u0004 ts , but (that of) the best mind for the a š\u0004 avan ’. Kellens and Pirart ( 1991 , p. 48) have remarked that the two expressions of the fi nal conditions of the drugvan \u0004 t and of the a š\u0004 avan may be brachylogic: ‘il faut comprendre * a ŋ hu š aci š tahii ā mana ŋ h ō ... a ŋ hu š vahi š tahii ā mana ŋ h ō ’ (Kellens and Pirart 1991 , p. 48). If so, one must under-stand the ‘best mind’ and the ‘worst mind’, contra Kellens and Pirart, not as two dimensions of ‘ritual existence’ but as two modes of (mental) existence after death. Y 43.3, among others, specifi cally sets ‘this existence possessed of bone’ apart from the existence ‘of the mind’ in a transparently eschatological context. 35 It is a question of two postmortem modes of existence, the best and the worst. The question of the events and conditions described in the stanza is not easy to answer. Is it an aetiological myth that the stanza relates, so one should understand the confrontation as unfolding in primordial times, or an existen-tial psychology, taking place in every human life, or even a kind of fundamen-tal analysis of the ritual psyche engaged in the course of the ritual underway? Earlier translations use the past tense, presumably to indicate mythical times. Lommel ( 1971 , p. 41) has: ‘Und als diese beiden Geister zurest zusammenka-men, schufen sie Leben und Nichtleben’. Insler ( 1975 , p. 33) translates: ‘Furthermore, when these two spirits fi rst came together, they created life and death’. Both verbs in question are of course in the present. Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 124) has: ‘and when these two spirits confront each other (to vie for a person), then (that person) decides (of what nature will be) the primal (stage of his existence): vitality and lack of vitality, and (on the other hand) of what nature (his) existence will be in the end’. The present tense, it seems, sup-ports the existential reading of the event: the confrontation takes place in the psyche of each individual and, depending on which way the person decides, determines his life condition and his destiny in the afterlife. I am not sure what the ‘primal stage of existence’ means. The only way it makes any sense in the translated text is something like: the ‘basic conditions of existence’. We"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"The choice 121should also note that as the translated text stands, one expects to see that the basic conditions would be dissociated (‘vitality or lack of vitality’ depending on the decision of the individual) and not associated with one another. Kellens and Pirart ( 1991 , p. 48) note the fact that the verbs are in the pre-sent, too, and conclude from this ‘que les faits é voqu é s ne se sont pas d é roul é s dans le pass é – il n’y a pas de “mythe des deux esprits”, etc.’ Their translation (Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 111) refl ects their view that it is the psychology of ritual that is at issue in the stanza: ‘Or, le fait fondamental que ces deux é tats d’esprit se confrontent soumet la vie et l’impossibilit é de vie à ce que, fi nale-ment, l’existence (de la) pire (Pens é e) soit celle des partisans de la Tromperie, et à ce que (l’existence de) la tr è s divine Pens é e appartienne au partisan de l’Harmonie’. It is not clear to me what Avestan word they have in mind for ‘fact’. I suppose we at least know it is a neuter, since the adjective paouruu ī m has to be understood in the nominative. Their translation of the sequence, dazd ē + accusative + ya θ ā ‘subject the accusative to the fact that’ requires reading the relative adverb as a kind of dative marker, turning the whole rela-tive clause into a dative phrase, which is ad hoc. 36 And what about the two accusatives ‘la vie et l’impossibilit é de vie’ – what do they mean? What does it mean to ‘subject these to the fact that fi nally the existence of the worst thought will be that of the partisans of deception, etc.’? Les deux é tats d’esprit sont fondamentaux parce que leur confrontation a pour r é sultat que le stade initial de la conduite rituelle, la pens é e, qu’elle se manifeste ou non de fa ç on perceptible ( ga ē mc ā ajii ā t ī mc ā ), se traduit, soit par une mauvais existence rituelle, soit par une bonne. (Kellens and Pirart 1991 , p. 43) Somehow ga ē mc ā ajii ā t ī mc ā (literally: ‘life and non-living’) means ‘whether in a perceptible or an imperceptible manner’. It is even more mysterious how the ‘initial stage of ritual conduct, thought,’ has become the protagonist of the stanza. The question remains: do the verbs in the present make it necessary to dis-card the mythological view of the stanza, as Humbach and Kellens and Pirart maintain? Firstly, the G ā thic present, when used in relating an event, does not necessarily imply that the event is taking place in the present. Past events may be narrated in the present in order to enhance their dramatic ‘presence’. Secondly, if the G ā thic verbal system is characterized primarily by the distinc-tion of aspect (the present vs. the aorist), then the verbal idea expressed in the ‘present’ does not simply refer to the present regardless of the context. As a general rule, the aorist expresses the process denoted by the verb externally : the process is reduced to a fact, or a moment in the process is highlighted as the signifi cant fact. The present represents the process internally as ongoing, i.e. qua duration, whether continuative or as repeated events. The verb in the present draws attention to the circumstances, the development, and features of the process. This so-called ‘durative aspect’ of the present obviously has an"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"122 The choiceelective affi nity with the present tense, or rather, can take on the additional role of expressing the present tense. But the consideration of this role, espe-cially in the case of the third person, must be subject to the discursive con-text. 37 Finally, the question of whether the verbs in the present describe an actual process or a mythical (or historical) phenomenon has to be decided in situ . Let us then examine our text in view of this question. The nom. acc. neuter adjective paouruu ī m is best interpreted adverbially. I pointed out above that the adjective *paouruiia- means ‘fi rst, primitive, former’. In none of its G ā thic occurrences does the adjective (or the adverb formed from it) have the sense of the hierarchically bottommost. Used as an adverb paouruu ī m means ‘primordially, originally, fi rst, in the beginning’. I think the point is important and bears emphasis. It rules out both Humbach’s ‘primal stage of one’s existence’ and Kellens and Pirart’s ‘le fait fondamen-tal’. Rather, the adverb tells us that the action it modifi es takes place in the beginning of a process or a career. What kind of process could this be? The confrontation of the two intuitions takes place ‘in the beginning’, and the result is the constitution of ‘life’ on the one hand and ‘non-living’ on the other. One could take the completive clause in the subjunctive as expressing the envisaged ends of the opposing constitutions: e.g. one establishes life and the other non-living in such a way that the worst existence would be that of the drugvan \u0004 t while the best existence would fall to the a š\u0004 avan . The opposition in the original constitution is somehow related to the fact that each individual faces a choice between two possible destinies. There is a connection between the opposing constitutions and the two eventualities. ga ē mc ā ajii ā t ī mc ā are antonymous abstract nouns. The fi rst one means ‘living’, not the capacity to live, but actual living; the abstract noun in –ti opposed to it, with the privative a– , means ‘non-living’, that is, existing in a way that does not qualify as ‘liv-ing’. They describe existence as such viewed from a dualistic perspective. If so, one must ask: what interest is in view in the perspective that describes exist-ence in terms of living and non-living? Every mortal, presumably, values liv-ing both here and beyond death, be it, in the latter case, in a mental state. The poet claims for his own worldview the support of man’s most fundamental desire: a fl ourishing life and a blissful afterlife. The followers of the traditional religion and its gods will have the worst (mental) existence, the continuation of their earthly ‘non-living’. 38 Non-living does not mean nothingness but an abhorrent existence. A certain way of life is simply equated with ‘living’, lead-ing to the best mental existence ‘in the end’. The tendentious appeal to ‘life’ against tradition or, in this case, a religious tradition, is understandable. It does not mean, however, that the poet is insincere where he describes the ways of his opponent as ‘non-living’ or ruination. But one cannot ignore the rhet-orical or ideological dimension of the imputation. The placement of his own view under the sign of ‘life’ is, in my mind, a sure indication of the poet’s revolutionary self-conception. Such is the mental setting that he wants to establish, and within whose frame he urges his listeners to make the ‘right choice’. The subjunctive mood of the verb ξ ah ‘be’ in the subordinated clause"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The choice 123portrays envisaged conditions, two eventualities, which must be placed in the frame of the poet’s conception about his own activity. The poet’s presumed audience is urged to make the right ‘choice’. It is this choice that connects the dualistic description of existence to the two eventualities, and operational-izes, as it were, the poet’s religious view. The opposing conditions of existence and the implied choice together lead to the two eventualities. I think this is the correct way of understanding the sense of the subordinate clause in the subjunctive. The ‘choice’ that the mortal faces here and now is thus placed against the poet’s extraordinary knowledge of the invisible, the primordial and fi nal conditions of existence. The anomalous o c ā attached to ya θ ā , which is thought to be, for the reason of meter, a later insertion, shows in a way that the later tradition perceived the discontinuity between the opposing condi-tions of existence and the eventualities, but instead of understanding it in terms of the intervening ‘choice’, took the eventualities as a fi nal constitution on a par with the two primordial ones. As far as I can see, there is no plausible way to interpret the confrontation of the two primordial intuitions solely as a psychological confl ict in the career of an individual life (Humbach). The poet reveals the truth about existence, in the light of which he invites his audience to make the right choice. This truth is necessarily primordial. The authority of the poet is based on his ability to see the origins of existence, how things are constituted in the beginnings. It can hardly be otherwise. 39 As for the possibility of a ritual ‘career’ (Kellens and Pirart), it is based on questionable assumptions. The ritual interpretation of ‘existence’ should be set aside. The whole construction of the ‘stages of rit-ual conduct’ is spurious, as I have argued. What, indeed, is ‘ritual existence’ – the episode in the participant’s life framed by the beginning and end of a rite, or the course of the rite itself ? How to imagine the ‘ritual existence’ ending in a condition characterized by the ‘best mind’ or the ‘worst mind’? If the ‘worst existence’ was only ‘une mauvaise existence rituelle’, could not things turn out differently (for one) in the next sacrifi ce? How, then, to understand the evidently incomparable gravity of the ‘fi nal’ conditions? How does one rec-ognize the good or bad ritual existence ‘in the end’: perfectly executed on the one hand and marred with mistakes on the other? Do these produce, respect-ively, the best mind and the worst? Is not ‘thought’ or ‘mind’, whether good or bad, supposed to be the basis of ritual conduct, and not its outcome? As one can see, the problems associated with this interpretation are not limited to the rather implausible rendition of ‘living and non-living’ as whether ‘elle [la pens é e] se manifeste ou non de fa ç on perceptible’. At every turn, the words and phrases are stamped with presumed meanings. In the end, the stanza says what it is meant to say: the correct ritual is based in one mental state and the incorrect ritual in the opposite – and ends up, too, with one or the other. The conditions described in Y 30.4cc′ are those of the afterlife. The word ap ə\u000e ma- ‘the last’ is consistently used in the G ā th ā s to describe the end of (embodied) existence or creation. It seems to have an exclusively eschato-logical signifi cance. The drugvan \u0004 ts ‘in the end’ reside in the ‘house of druj ’,"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"124 The choicewhose postmortem status is evident, for example, from Y 49.11, Y 46.11 (for eternity), and Y 31.20 (fi nal lot: a lasting period of darkness, etc.). 40 The stake of the ‘choice’ between the two ways of being is explicitly articulated in this stanza. The concern with the fate of the soul beyond death frames the treat-ment that the da ē vas receive in the G ā th ā s (see below). It is scarcely possible to overstate the importance of this eschatological perspective. Here too, like in the previous stanza, the poet skilfully handles two per-spectives: that of the mythical beginnings and that of the demand that the primordial constitution makes on each individual. He does this by projecting the two opposing ways of existence into the eschatological future. The dual-istic beginning of the conditions of existence is connected with the two pos-sible outcomes by way of the choice ( ā uuar ə na- ) that each man makes. The unstated ‘choice’ is the link between the unique beginning and the multiple ends, in the context of the concern that each individual has ( nar ə\u000e m.nar ə m x v ax \u000b ii ā i tanuii ē ) with the fate of his or her soul after death. The gravity of the tone that the reader fi nds in Y 30.4 is not out of place. Behind the world as ‘life and non-living’ stands an eschatological concern. One may want to use ‘ethical’ to describe each person’s choice in the light of which her or his post-mortem fate is determined, insofar as the regulation of conduct according to a precept may be termed ‘ethical’. But there is no independent refl ection here on the part of the individual about what in the situation constitutes a meritorious and what a culpable act. The ‘choice’ is in reality siding with one party against another, framed by the poet’s representations, and motivated by the desire for a pleasant existence (here and) beyond. As I have emphasized, orientation to an abstract, universal ‘good’ is a notion of modern moral phil-osophy. Such a perspective is out of place in the ancient world.

One of the protagonists chooses a š\u0004 a ; the opposing one chooses to do the worst (acts). Doing the worst acts and pursuing a š\u0004 a seem to be set against each other as the contents of the choices that the two antagonists make. How should we understand this? Pursuing a š\u0004 a implies ‘satisfying’ Ahura Mazd ā , hai θ ii ā i š š\u000b iiao θ an ā i š ‘with true acts’. Doing the ‘worst acts’, on the other hand, involves turning away from a š\u0004 a .

Y 32.5). The primordial choices of the two intuitions mark out the choices available to mortals. I do not think there can be any question that in these two primordial intuitions we must see two ‘mythological’ characters. In the YH, Y 36.3, mainiiu- sp ə\u000e ni š ta- ‘the most vitalizing intuition’ is used as an epithet of the heavenly fi re, ‘Ahura Mazd ā ’s fi re’ (see Hintze 2007 , pp. 132–33). In the G ā th ā s, however, the term can refer to a specifi c capacity of Mazd ā , and, in one case, in the stanza before us, is used as a synecdoche to refer to the god himself. One should note that the poet does not turn to Mazd ā as an interlocutor until Y 30.7. In the meantime, he gives a ‘knowledgeable’ account of the beginnings and the possible ends, sharpened into a dichotomy, the conditions that defi ne earthly existence. What is this specifi c capacity of the god that is signifi cantly used here as a synecdoche? Choosing a š\u0004 a has a particular meaning for mortals. The perspective adopted in this stanza on the activity of the two intuitions is framed by the ‘decisive choice’ ( ā uuar ə na- ) between life and ruination put forward in the previous stanzas. This is signalled by the syntactic construction: inj. aor. of √ var ‘choose’ + infi nitive of √ varz ‘do, carry out’. The diffi culties of this stanza are all conceptual. The syntax is clear. Insler ( 1975 , p. 33) reads the fi nite verb varat ā in the past tense. But the aorist is used to represent the verbal idea as an accomplished act; the time of the action is a matter of indifference. Humbach in effect substantivizes the adjective ‘worst’: ‘Of these two spirits, the deceitful one chooses to do the worst (things)’ (Humbach 1991 , vol. 1, p. 124). Kellens and Pirart read ‘action’ for the noun in ellipsis: ‘Celui d’entre ces deux é tats d’esprit qui est partisan de la Tromperie choisit d’accomplir les plus mauvais (actes ritu-els)’ (Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 111). The worst act means the worst ritual act, just as , hai θ ii ā i š š \u000b iiao θ an ā i š means ‘par des actes cultuels’ (Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 111). In view of the parallel opposition in Y 51.13, one can be more or less certain that the elliptical noun is indeed š\u000b iiao θ ana- ‘action’ or ‘enactment’. Thus we have three sets of opposed terms: a š\u0004 a versus druj , the most vitalizing intuition versus the drugvan \u0004 t intuition, and the ‘true actions’ versus the ‘worst actions’. Once again, one should not lose sight of the dis-cursive frame established in the previous stanza: the choice between living and ruination. Now, Kellens and Pirart’s interpretation of hai θ iia- as cultic is based on a questionable analysis of the function of the present participle han \u0004 t- ‘being’. I have argued elsewhere that the term hai θ iia- ‘true’ is con-nected with eschatological motifs in the G ā th ā s. 42 The ‘true act’ is an act that is based in the primordial arrangement of the world and hence eschatologi-cally effi cacious, just as the ‘true formula’ (Y 31.6) is a formula that secures immortality, integrity and a š\u0004 a . 43 We should now discuss the terms sp ə n \u0004 ta- mainiiu- and sp ə\u000e ni š ta- mainiiu- . mainiiu- designates not just a certain disposition or ‘force’ (see EWA , vol. 2, p. 313 for Vedic many ú - ‘erregter Sinn, Eifer, Leidenschaft, Affekt, Wut’) but also a form of knowledge, namely an insight into the beginnings, that is to say,"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"126 The choiceinto the divinely constituted world.

I propose to read kaii ā as the fi rst person singular of the thematic present stem kaiia- ‘to perceive’ from √ kai ̯ /ci < PIE * √ k w o/ei . Although this root is otherwise unattested in verbal form in the G ā th ā s, it does have a Vedic equivalent ( EWA , vol. 1, p. 531), which seems to be in competition with √ cit ‘to perceive, observe’ ( EWA , vol. 1, p. 547). The root is represented in the G ā th ā s by caiiah- ‘attention’. If we take kaii ā as a fi rst person verb it has to satisfy a few syntactic and semantic criteria. The subject of the verb is the priest who accomplishes the action denoted by the verb with a mental activity or state ( mana ŋ h ā ); the action is mentioned in the context of similar achievements that display the priest’s credentials. The adjective ə r ə zu \u0006 š is in the accusative (plural) and qualifi es the implied pa θ ō ‘paths’ mentioned in the previous stanza. ‘Straight paths’, perhaps in part of Indo-European lineage, 44 represent either the means or the object of Zarathu š tra’s intellectual activity in the G ā th ā s, and seem to connote the effi ciency of his knowledge. In the context it almost certainly means straight paths of vitalization. From Y 43.2 we may gather that the attainment of the cognitive power that lies at the basis of the supreme god’s creative activity ( maniiu- ) is the fundamental mark of Zarathu š tra’s privileged status. The ablative form in general signifi es the origin of a movement or, when used more abstractly, the basis of a view or mental activity. The postposition ā emphasizes the basal nature of the intuition, which the next verse signals again with ahm ā t ̃ . 45"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"The choice 127 In ‘Un avis sur vieil-avestique mainiiu- ’, Kellens ( 1990 ) examines in some detail the usages made of the term mainiiu- in the Older Avestan texts. There are two passages that, according to him (Kellens 1990 , p. 101), provide decisive evidence for the meaning of the term: Y 31.7 and 43.16. Ce peut diffi cilement ê tre un hasard si, à deux reprises, le mot mainiiu- se trouve dans la proposition qui annonce ou signale a posteriori un dis-cours direct caract é ris é ayant pour pivot le verbe m ê me dont il d é rive, man , employ é à la 1 è re sing. inj. aor. dans l’expression de la co ï ncidence. Comment ne pas en conclure que mainiiu- d é signe l’acte m ê me qui con-siste à faire une d é claration de co ï ncidence en m ə\u000eŋ h ī ? (Kellens 1990 , p. 102) The phrase t ā ... mainiiu \u0006 in Y 31.7c refers to the following ‘consecutive dec-laration’ (starting with Y 31.8a ‘I think, O Mazd ā , that you are the fi rst’) of the stanzas 8 to 10, all of whose second p ā das are short by one syllable (Kellens 1990 , pp. 101–102). Kellens translates Y 31.7cc′ t ā mazd ā mainiiu \u0006 ux š ii ō y ə\u000e ā nu \u0006 r ə\u000e mc ī t ̃ ahur ā h ā m ō : ‘ ô Ahura Mazd ā , continue à t’accro î tre par ce mainiiu , toi qui es pourtant jusqu’ à pr é sent le m ê me’ (Kellens 1990 , p. 101). In my opinion, this analysis is mistaken. In 31.7cc′ and 31.8aa′ we have two formulations of the idea that Mazd ā is immortal, the fi rst in refer-ence to the god’s primordial creation by mental power, the second in reference to the poet’s access to things primordial , things divine. Y 31.7cc′ should per-haps be translated: ‘by means of that creative intuition (or conception), O Mazd ā Ahura, you thrive, (you) who are the same to the very present’. The god is unaffected by the passage of time; he exists beyond time. Y 31.8aa′ at ̃ θβ ā m ə\u000eŋ\u000b h ī paouruu ī m mazd ā yazu \u0006 m st ō i mana ŋ h ā means: ‘thus I intuit you in my mind, young that you are, to (have) be(en) the fi rst’. Hence, the word mai-niiu- in 31.7c does not refer to any ‘direct discourse’ but to the mental power of the god (Y 31.7aa′) yast ā man \u0004 t ā pouruii ō raoc ə\u000e b ī š r ō i θβ ə n x v ā θ r ā ‘the fi rst who conceived that the free expanses be fi lled with heavenly lights’. The word mainiiu- seems to designate a mental power (‘conception’ or ‘intuition’) that has a creative force, especially when used of the god. In Y 43.16 mainiiu- does not refer to the preceding formulations of the ‘view’ that ‘Mazd ā est sp ə n \u0004 ta ’, but names the mental force that ‘visits’ the poet and allows him to obtain insight into the invisible, set out in Y 43.3–15. Insler ( 1975 , p. 63) sees ‘the vir-tuous spirit of the lord’ in the unspecifi ed third person sing. ‘(...) visits’ in the refrain Y 43.5 (7, 9, 11, 13, 15) bb′ hiiat ̃ m ā vohu \u0006 , pair ī .jasat ̃ mana ŋ h ā . I cannot go into an analysis of this passage.

For the poet, ‘the vitaliz-ing intuition’ of the god is not just a power of observation into the invisible but also a power of vitalization, just as it is for the god in Y 31.7cc′."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"128 The choice The symmetry of the primordial creation and the end of existence, whether it is a question of the fate of the soul or the earthly conditions of life, is implied in the notion of the ‘intuition that is vitalizing’. The knowledge of the beginnings is necessarily knowledge of the end, since it is an insight into the true source of time and existence. Just like the archaic Greek ‘memory’, i.e. the knowledge of the past, the present and the future, the G ā thic ‘vital-izing intuition’ gives access, beyond time, to the divine source of things. The poet’s insight into the primordial and fi nal times is a divine power, which can, just because it is in contact with truth, produce ‘good’ (e.g. ‘vitalizing’) thought, speech and action. In the same way, the mainiiu- of druj has the power to harm and destroy existence. 46 One cannot emphasize this strongly enough. The supreme god is intuited to be ‘vitalizing’ not just because of his original creative act but also – and, one should say, more importantly, as far as the interest of mortals is concerned – because he has made eschatological arrangements.

In another stanza this symmetry is again emphasized.

The ‘most vitalizing intuition’ in this stanza seems to refer to the divine power of securing the desired eschatological outcome. Mazd ā ’s vitalizing intuition is thus bivalent: if it embodies the god’s creative force, it is, in the poet, also the"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"The choice 129divine capacity of ‘seeing’ the primordial events and fi nal things, the faculty that underlies ‘true’ actions which pursue the (eschatological) vitalization of (one’s) existence. The meaning of resolutely embracing Mazd ā , the ‘most vitalizing intuition’, by ‘true acts’ should be placed against this conceptual nexus. Desiring a š\u0004 a for the mortals involves satisfying the god who carries their eschatological hopes. ‘Woe!’ would be the ‘last word of existence’ for those who do not apply the formula (i.e. effi cacious formula) as Mazd ā conceives and articulates it (Y 45.3). And the poet mediates between the divine and mortals. The expression dar ə sa- a š\u0004 ahii ā used in Y 32.13 can hardly have any other meaning than attaining the divine sphere, which means that, at least in one respect, a š\u0004 a is understood to be associated with a condition that is the object of eschatological longings. 48 It stands out clearly, against this background, that the ‘worst acts’ are those that, among others, frustrate eschatological expectations. 49 With their powers the karapans and the Kavis ‘yoke the mortal with bad actions ( ak ā i š š\u000b iiao θ an ā i š ) in order to destroy (his) existence, whom their own da ē n ā and their own uruuan enrage when they come to the Collector’s Bridge: forever ( yauu ō i v ī sp ā i ) guests at the House of druj ’ (Y 46.11). I have already alluded in this connection to Y 51.13, where it is said that the drugvan \u0004 t ‘thanks to his own actions and (the words) of his tongue has disappeared from the path of a š\u0004 a ’. The eschatological imagery used in this stanza shows in what sense one should understand the phrase ‘path of a š\u0004 a ’. ‘Bad action’ is not an instance of ‘Evil’, whatever this means. It is bad because, in particular, it undermines the mortal’s desire to accede to the divine sphere beyond death. 50 Y 30.6 aii å n ō it ̃ ə r əš v ī š\u000b ii ā t ā , da ē uuacin ā hiiat ̃ ı \u0002 š ā .d ə baom ā × p ə r ə s ə mn ə\u000e n \u0004 g up ā .jasat ̃ , hiiat ̃ v ə r ə n ā t ā aci š t ə m man ō at ̃ a ē šə m ə m h ə\u000e n \u0004 duu ā r ə n \u0004 t ā , y ā b ą naii ə n ahu \u0006 m mar ə t ā n ō 51 Even the da ē vas do not pick correctly from those two since the deceiver comes over to them while they are deliberating. As they choose the worst thinking they rush headlong to a ē šə ma , with which mortals sicken existence. This stanza, along with Y 32.5 and the diffi cult 44.20, is crucial for understanding the G ā thic view of the da ē vas . The use of the enclitic emphatic particle o cin ā , employed in negative state-ments, is signifi cant. We should try to get the nuance right. As far as I am aware, there are two views among scholars about the sense of the term; and, within the second group, two shades of meaning can be distinguished. Insler ( 1975 , p. 33) and Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 124) have the negative emphasis bear on the act of discrimination, so Humbach: ‘The da ē vas do not at all discriminate rightly between these two (spirits)’. For the second view, the par-ticle emphatically foregrounds the da ē vas in their failure, and not the failure itself. Thus Bartholomae ( AW , col. 441) has ‘auch’; Lommel ( 1971 , p. 42):"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"130 The choice‘Zwischen diesen beiden haben sogar die G ö tter nicht richtig unterschieden’; and Kellens and Pirart ( 1988 , p. 111): ‘Entre ces deux ( é tats d’esprit), les (mau-vais) dieux surtout ne distinguent pas bien’; and Humbach ( 1957b , p. 308): ‘zwischen diesen beiden scheiden auch die Da ē vas nicht richtig’. It seems that the emphasis on the ‘gods’ may be understood with two different nuances: ‘not even the gods rightly discerned’, etc., or ‘the gods in particular did not discern rightly’, etc. 52 The question is whether we should read the emphatic particle o cin ā as foregrounding the culprit in their failure or as singling out a particular group in relation to a failure. In the fi rst case, the poet is emo-tionally involved, the outrage palpable and possibly fresh. By contrast, in the second case, the sentence rather assumes the tenor of a report or something akin to it. Although the act of singling out the da ē vas for a special mention obviously points to the importance that their failure has for the poet, it also conveys a sense of distance between the poet and their wrong, whether one would like to see the distance in a temporal or psychological sense. The aor-ist aspect of the verb v ī š\u000b ii ā t ā ‘set apart, discern’ expresses the failure as a fact while up ā .jasat ̃ ‘come over’ in the injunctive present draws attention to the process, the circumstances of the failure. The genitive pronoun aii å is necessarily partitive, so the verb v ī + ξ ci has to be understood with an implied direct object, which agrees with its usage elsewhere in the G ā th ā s. The verbal phrase aii å n ō it ̃ ə r əš v ī š\u000b ii ā t ā thus means ‘do not pick rightly from these two’. I have already discussed this point. It is very important to have it fi rmly in view. Humbach’s ( 1957b , p. 308) transla-tion of the phrase, ‘zwischen diesen beiden scheiden... nicht richtig’, is prob-lematic; so, too, the others given above. Thus the point being made is that the gods do not pick the right one from the dual set, and not that they do not discriminate correctly between the two. It is not a question of the power of discrimination, of a failure due to feeblemindedness, but the wrong choice, which, viewed from the mortals’ perspective, is ruinous. Yet, most scholars have translated and understood the phrase in the former sense (see above). Insler ( 1975 , p. 33) is an exception in this regard: ‘The gods did not at all choose correctly between these two’. Kellens and Pirart ( 1990 , p. 217) analyse ā .d ə baoman- as ‘( ā + ) dbu (/ 1 dab )’ and translate ‘illusion, é garement’. Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 2, p. 52) points out that this would be ‘an unusual formation’, and suggests to read ā o as a post-positive particle of emphasis. The particle would, then, keep the focus on the da ē vas in a presumably changed discursive frame. Kuiper ( 1973 , pp. 201–202) argues that ā o should be read as a verbal prefi x with up ā .jasat ̃ , with which Insler ( 1975 , p. 167) agrees, following Geldner in interpreting d ə baoman- as an agent noun ‘deceiver’, a reference to the drugvan \u0004 t mainiiu . Geldner’s and Insler’s view is attractive. It is true that the great majority of the Indo-Iranian stems in man are neuter action nouns, but masculine agent nouns in man , accented on the suffi x, are also regularly attested in Vedic (Wackernagel and Debrunner 1954 , pp. 760–62); according to Whitney, ‘in several instances, a neuter and a masculine, of the one and the other value and accent, stand side"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"The choice 131by side’ (Whitney 2005 , p. 437). It is possible that certain neuter nouns are turned masculine to serve as agents of the actions denoted by the original neuter. In any case, the subject of the verb upa + ξ gam ‘come to’ in the Avesta is a person or a personalized abstraction (see AW , col. 497). Of course, we still have to ask what the nature of the deception is. What Y 32.5 and 44.20 tell us about this topic partly overlaps with the material in Y 30.6 and partly supplements it. The picture that emerges from these stanzas is that of a sys-tematic ideology, which, as we will see, will explain the G ā thic repudiation of the da ē vas . The shift from the aorist ( v ī š\u000b ii ā t ā ) to the injunctive present ( up ā .jasat ̃ ) is not insignifi cant, despite Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 2, p. 52), and Kellens and Pirart ( 1990 , p. 75). Having admitted the aspectual opposition between the aorist and the present, one cannot deny all signifi cance to their juxtaposition. Here (and, e.g. in Y 31.9–10) one fi nds the present in a subordinated clause and the aorist in the main. We must fi rst of all reject the idea that one can tell the (relative) time (i.e. tense) of the reported event from this verbal distribution. 53 Whether one should place the da ē vas ’ failure in past or present time cannot be determined by the use of the present in the subordinate clause. The present verb of the subordinate does not prevent the placement of the da ē vas ’ failure, and with it their deliberation, in the ‘past’ if the event should be understood as a mythological phenomenon – ‘past’, of course, meaning the time of myth. The aorist in the main clause recounts an event as a momentous fact; the pre-sent of the subordinate clause draws attention to the circumstances that attend the reported fact, i.e. as it unfolds. The middle present participle p ə r ə s ə mn ə\u000e n \u0004 g ‘(while) consulting’ describes the gods in situ . In the subordinate clause one is given a view into the circumstance whereby the outcome reported in the main comes about. In any case, the mythic ‘past’ is also present precisely as a momentous fact. Also, I do not think we can understand this circumstance in any other way than as a mythological episode. From the comparison of this stanza with Y 32.3–5 and Y 44.20, one is inclined to consider the episode as belonging to a well-defi ned story. Humbach ( 1957b ) interprets the ‘decision’ of the da ē vas , ‘put before them by men’, as one bearing on the kind of ritual offered to them. The passage, according to him, speaks of ‘einer Entscheidung, vor die die Da ē vas immer wieder von den Menschen gestellt werden: Sollen sie sich dem Opfer der Truhaften oder dem der Wahrhaften zuwenden?’ (Humbach 1957b , p. 303) The emphasis on ‘again and again’ is meant to drive home the ritual nature of the decision to be made by the gods time and again. This picture, however, is questionable. The aorist cannot be that of the so-called habitual action, in part because it is juxtaposed with the verbs in the present, but more import-antly because of the evidently momentous nature of the decision. The present form of the verb and the participle of the relative clause does not indicate the ‘real present’ but the circumstances of the action expressed in the main clause. An opposition of aspects is at issue here. Moreover, if by ‘choice’ the poet merely meant the choice between two kinds of rite – if this were the meaning"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"132 The choiceof the ‘choice’ – he would have no doubt so expressed himself. The decisive choice at stake in these stanzas is before the mortals and not the gods. To put it in another way: the wrong (ritual) choice of the da ē vas , made in primordial times, matters because it affects the vital interests of the mortals across the threshold of death and in the beyond. 54 The word mar ə t ā n ō has been analysed in three ways. Bartholomae ( AW , col. 1148) reads it as the gen. sing. of mar ə tan- ‘sterblich; Mensch’. Kuiper ( 1957 , p. 94 n.27) maintains that the word is in the genitive, which is, more-over, required by the context. Kellens and Pirart ( 1991 , p. 49), too, make it a genitive, but from a different stem: ‘ mar ə t ā n- du type m ą θ r ā n- ’, which they ( 1990 , p. 282) translate ‘chef des hommes’. Lommel ( 1971 , p. 42), Humbach ( 1957b and 1991 , vol. 2, p. 52), de Vaan ( 2003 , p. 590) and Hoffmann and Forssman ( 2004 , p. 144) read it as a nominative plural of mar ə tan- ‘mortal’. Insler ( 1975 , p. 168) makes it an accusative plural. Thus Kuiper, Insler, and Kellens and Pirart have to make the da ē vas the subject of b ą naii ə n ‘sicken, affl ict’. Insler ( 1975 , p. 33) translates Y 30.6cc′: ‘they then rushed into fury, with which they have affl icted the world and mankind’; and Kellens and Pirart ( 1988 , p. 111): ‘ils courent ensemble vers la Rage, dont ils infectent l’existence (rituelle) du ma î tre d’hommes’. Y 44.20 and Y 49.4, where, signifi cantly, we fi nd both words da ē uua- and a ē šə ma– , seem to use the latter as a specifi c type of ritual. I will consider these two stanzas later; suffi ce it to point out here that in both Y 44.20 and Y 49.4 it is not the da ē vas but the mortals that foster and organize the a ē šə ma . Thus it seems to make better sense to read mar ə t ā n ō in the nominative: ‘they (the da ē vas ) rush headlong to the a ē šə ma (rite), with which men sicken existence’. The word ahu- (Vedic á su- ) means ‘existence’ or ‘Leben’, but not ‘the world’, as Insler ( 1975 , p. 33) and Schwartz ( 2003 , p. 216) translate it. 55 In all its Older Avestan occurrences it seems to have the sense of a state and not that of an entity. Two idiomatic usages are made of it in the G ā th ā s. In the YH we fi nd a third one, uba- ahu- ‘both states’, referring to the corporeal exist-ence and mental existence. Lommel ( 1930 , pp. 101–105, pp. 120–29, p. 144), Narten ( 1986 , pp. 290–95) and Hintze ( 2007 , p. 73) understand the expression as referring to the physical and spiritual dimensions of earthly life, based in a (quasi-Cartesian) doctrine of body and mind. On the other hand, Narten ( 1986 , p. 291) acknowledges that in a number of YAv. passages, the oppos-ition between ‘this existence’ or ‘corporeal state’ and the ‘mental state’ is that of the earthly life and the afterlife. It is indeed diffi cult to interpret, e.g. Yt 10.93 or, especially, HN2 16.34 in any other way: Yt 10.93 va ē ibiia n ō ahubiia nipaii å ā i mi θ ra vouru.gaoiiaoite aheca a ŋ h ə\u000e u š y ō astuuat ō yasca asti manahii ō ‘O Mithra of wide pastures, protect us in both existences: this existence which (is) possessed of bone and (the one) that is of the mind’; HN2 16.34 astuuatat ̃ haca a ŋ haot ̃ manah ī m auui ahu \u0006 m ‘from the corporeal existence to the men-tal existence’, which describes the status of the soul just arrived at Mazd ā ’s abode. However, Narten rejects this ‘eschatological’ interpretation for the Old Avestan texts."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The choice 133 The G ā thic locution ‘corporeal and mental states’ seems to correspond to the YH ‘two states’: Y 28.2 ahuu å astuuatasc ā hiiat ̃ c ā mana ŋ h ō ‘of two states, the one possessed of bone and the one of the mind’; and Y 43.3 ahii ā a ŋ h ə\u000e u š astuuat ō mana ŋ hasc ā ‘of this state possessed of bone and (that) of the mind’. In this last phrase ‘this possessed-of-bone state’ is differentiated from the existence ‘of the mind’. Thus we should understand the expression not in the sense of Cartesian dualism but as referring to the life that is embodied, here, and the life that is (only) mental, hereafter. In one YH passage, ‘this exist-ence’ is distinguished from the ‘existence of the mind’: Y 40.2 ahm ā ic ā ahuii ē manax \u000b ii ā ic ā ‘for this life and the mental one’. The G ā th ā s, too, use the term ‘this existence’ by itself (e.g. Y 30.9, 34.6, 45.3), where it signifi es the earthly existence as opposed to the state beyond death. Y 45.3 seems to confi rm this meaning of the term.

It is artifi cial to dissociate ‘this existence’ of the fi rst verse from the ‘existence’ of the last verse, as Kellens and Pirart ( 1988 , p. 155) do, having the fi rst refer to the ‘ritual state’ and the second to the ‘profane state’. The resulting scenario would become hard to imagine. The G ā thic adjective astuuan \u0004 t– , usually translated as physical or corporeal, literally means ‘possessed of bone’, i.e. the state of existence possessed of bone. It does not mean the physical dimension of life, next to which we would have a mental dimension (cf. Panaino 2004b , pp. 121ff.). The ‘existence possessed of bone’ refers to the earthly life and the ‘existence of the mind’ refers to the state of existence beyond ‘this state’. In the second specifi c usage, ahu- is qualifi ed by the adjective paouruuiia- ‘prior or previous’. Now, as I argued, this adjective does not mean ‘fundamen-tal’ in the architectonic sense, but expresses priority in a sequence, which may be absolute. It has, then, the sense of the ‘previous’, and absolutely, ‘primor-dial’, ‘fi rst’, ‘best’. Insler ( 1975 , p. 132) understands ahu- paouruuiia- as ‘the foremost existence’, and maintains that it refers to ‘the time when the rule of truth and good thinking... shall be brought to realization on earth (cf. Y 30.7–8), when deceit shall be destroyed forever (cf. 48.1–2)’. He further thinks that ahu- paouruuiia- is equivalent to ‘the good form of existence’ (Y 48.2d a ŋ h ə\u000e u š va ŋ v h ī ... ā k ə r ə iti š ), ‘the best existence’ (Y 44.2b a ŋ h ə\u000e u š vahi š tahii ā ), and the ‘splendid existence’ (Y 34.15c f ə ra šə\u000e m ahu \u0006 m ); and that they are all to be placed in the future. The adjective can certainly be understood in Insler’s"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"134 The choicesense, but the placement of ahu- paouruuiia- in the future would have to be taken in the sense of some kind of restoration of a ‘primordial state of exist-ence’. From Y 28.11c ′ y ā i š ā a ŋ hu š pouruii ō × buuat ̃ ‘by means of which the primordial state of existence will have taken place’, 56 we know that the ‘prim-ordial existence’ has a normative value, since it was ‘created’ (e.g. Y 44.3–5) by the supreme god. The verb buuat ̃ is in the subjunctive aorist expressing an envisaged phenomenon. Thus Humbach’s hesitation ( 1991 , vol. 2, p. 29) as to whether to translate ‘prime existence’ or ‘primal existence’ depending on whether to place the event in the future or the past may be resolved. The occurrence of ahu- in Y 30.6c′ does not seem to belong to any of these two usages. But I think the context (Y 30.7–9) makes it likely that it should be understood as referring to earthly existence, which is perhaps the damaged continuation of the ‘primordial state’ (cf. Y 45.1). The nominative mar ə t ā n ō marks a break with the previous topic. The men who sicken existence with the a ē šə ma will be seized and punished, and ‘this existence’ (Y 30.9 ī m... ahu \u0006 m ) made ‘splendid’ ( f ə ra šə\u000e m ), by those ‘who will deliver the druj into the hands of a š\u0004 a ’ (Y 30.8c′). The genitive pronoun a ē šą m in the verse line Y 30.7cc′ a ē šą m t ō i ā ā ŋ hat ̃ , ya θ ā aiia ŋ h ā ā d ā n ā i š pouruii ō can hardly refer to the da ē vas , con-tra Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 124): ‘so that through their (the da ē vas ) being fettered in iron, (existence) will be Thy prime one’. Insler ( 1975 , p. 35) main-tains that it refers to the ‘faithful’, whom he sees behind utaiiu \u0006 iti š ā rmaiti š , and reads p ō i ‘to protect’ for t ō i : ‘He shall be here for the protection of these (faithful), just as He shall be the fi rst (to do so) during the requitals with the (molten) iron’. His reason for making this change, however, is not sound (see Insler 1975 , p. 170). Mazd ā ’s being the subject of the verb ( jasat ̃ ) in the fi rst verse does not require his being so of another verb in the last. Lommel ( 1971 , p. 45) makes the ‘powers’ (M ä chten) mentioned in the fi rst two verses the antecedent of the pronoun, and ā rmaiti- the noun underlying the adjective pouruii ō , which would have to be then read in the feminine: ‘so da ß sie bei deinen Vergeltungen durch das (geschmolzene) Erz die erste von diesen (vor-genannten M ä chten) sein wird’ ( 1971 , p. 42). The added gloss 57 aiia ŋ h ā makes it likely – the discrepancy in the number notwithstanding – that ā d ā na- was understood to be the cognate of either ā d ā na- ‘enchainment’ or ā dh ā na- ‘bri-dle’ (see Humbach 1991 , vol. 2, p. 53). The genitive pronoun a ē šą m refers to the ‘mortals’ of Y 30.6c ′, and the underlying noun of the adjective pouruii ō is ahu– , ‘for the sake of it’ ( ahm ā i o ) the god ‘comes’ ( jasat ̃ ) in the fi rst verse, and it ( ahu- ) is the benefi ciary of dad ā t ̃ ‘gives’ in the second verse line. The direct object of ξ gam ‘come’ is either in the accusative or locative, not in the dative (e.g. Y 43.1). When the verb has no complement, it has the sense of ‘arise’ or ‘arrive’ (e.g. Y 30.8, 31.14, 48.11), and its possible dative com-plement expresses the reason for ‘arising’. 58 Y 51.10cc′ maibii ō zbaii ā a š\u0004ə m va ŋ huii ā a š\u0004ı \u0002 gat ̃ .t ē means ‘I invoke a š\u0004 a with good a š i to come for me’, i.e. for my sake, and not ‘de venir à moi’ (Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 183), ‘to come to me’ (Humbach 1991 , vol.1, p. 188), etc. Hence, Y 30.7cc′ should be translated: ‘with the enchainment of these (men), (existence) will be yours as the fi rst one"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"The choice 135(was)’, or: ‘with the enchainment of these (men), (existence) will be like your primordial one (was)’. 59 Y 30.6 explicitly associates the da ē vas with a certain type of ritual char-acterized by a ē šə ma- ‘fury’, since the accusative object of a verb of move-ment almost always denotes a concrete phenomenon. 60 If I am correct about the nuance of the emphatic particle o cin ā ‘not even’ in the stanza, the poet is repudiating the da ē vas in opposition to the traditional view of these ‘gods’, or at least in opposition to a certain tradition still thriving at the time. Y 29.4 confi rms that the da ē va cult was very much active and widespread when the G ā th ā s were composed. In fact, it seems like the poet expects that it will con-tinue to exist in the future.

He, the lord, discerns (whatever has been done before and whatever may be done henceforth in respect of a š\u0004 a and druj ). As he may wish, so shall it be for us. The neuter noun sax v ā r ə\u000e (acc. pl.) has been related to both ξ s ā h ‘instruct’ (Kellens and Pirart 1990 , p. 314) and ξ sac ‘be able’ (Hoffmann and Forssman 2004 , p. 153; Hintze 2007 , p. 178). I tend to agree with Hintze’s view that the semantics of the verb ξ varz ‘do, exercise’ must be taken into account, although in Y 45.3 the same verb has the sense of verbal performance whose object is a ‘formula’ ( m ą θ ra- ). It is best to understand the word in the broadest sense of ‘performance’, including things thought. Kellens and Pirart ( 1991 , p. 36) suggest that the two obscure terms pair ī .ci θ ī t ̃ and aip ī .ci θ ī t ̃ are adverbs consisting of two adverbs of time pair ī and aip ī ‘portant l’agr é gat particulaire c ī t ̃ + ī t ̃ ’. The particle ī t ̃ must be distributive here, as in, for example, Y 39.3. They explain the fricative - θ - by the ‘sandhi d’ é poque ortho é pique’ (Kellens and Pirart 1990 , p. 126). The fricativization of the intervocalic dental is regu-lar in Young Avestan. There is one certain case ( AW , col. 860: ‘zuvor’) where pair ī is used as an adverb of time meaning ‘hitherto’. Given the coordinated construction and the modes (perfect v ā uu ə r ə z ō i , subjunctive var əš ait ē ) in which the verb ξ varz is used, one has no choice but to admit that aip ī is an adverb of time meaning something like ‘henceforth’. Kellens and Pirart ( 1988 , p. 108) and Hintze ( 2007 , p. 178) integrate the adverbials into the two relative phrases: y ā ... v ā uu ə r ə z ō i pair ī .ci θ ī t ̃ ... y ā c ā var əš ait ē aip ī .ci θ ī t ̃ . But what to make of o c ī θ o < c ī t ̃ ? 61 It cannot be the singular neuter indefi nite pronoun (Ved. cid ), since its only possible antecedent sax v ā r ə\u000e ‘performances’ is in the plural. As far as I can see, the only possibility is the one suggested by Kellens and Pirart ( 1990 , p. 242), namely to read c ī t ̃ as the"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"136 The choiceemphatic particle. In Y 46.5 the adjective v ī cira- has verbal force and governs two direct objects. 62 It is possible that here, too, it has a direct object, sax v ā r ə\u000e , which it shares with mairi š ta- . Still, if ī t ̃ is indeed a distributive particle, the coordinating o c ā in 4b′ remains problematic. Y 30.8 uses the term a ē nah- ‘wrong’ to characterize the action of men who take part in the a ē šə ma rite, dedicated to the da ē vas (Y 30.6c). In other pas-sages, too, where the da ē vas , along with their mortal followers, are described as participating in a wrong ‘action’ (cf. Y 32.3), this term almost certainly refers to the condemned ritual. Y 29.4 asserts the disposition of Mazd ā over how ‘it will be for us’. This expression, in my mind, has a specifi c reference. Although the adverbial ap ə\u000e m ə m ‘fi nally’ is not used here, the disposition that Mazd ā is said to have must refer to the fate of the soul, as in Y 48.4 (see Chapter 6 ), which will depend on how one shapes one’s da ē n ā . The ‘dis-cernment’ (from v ī + ξ ci ‘set apart’) that Ahura exercises brings to bear the authoritative opposition of a š\u0004 a and druj on the da ē n ā (e.g. Y 30.11 and 46.5). In Y 30.11 Mazd ā ’s ‘rules’ determine both the ‘access and ban on access’ to the divine sphere ( x v ī tic ā ə\u000e n ə it ī ) and ‘that long withering is for the drugvan \u0004 ts but vital energies for the a š\u0004 avans ’ ( hiiat ̃ c ā dr ə guu ō .d ə bii ō ra š ō sauuac ā a š\u0004 auuabii ō ). It is ‘(by abiding) with these (rules)’ that ‘things will be according to (your) wish’ ( at ̃ aip ī t ā i š a ŋ hait ī u š t ā ). The poet addresses the ‘mortals’ ( ma š\u0004 ii åŋ h ō ) in this stanza; and, clearly, their ‘wish’, which will be satisfi ed once they learn the god’s rules, has to do with the afterlife. In Y 30 the poet-seer pronounces his dualistic image of human existence, which he claims he has acquired through his insight into the primordial arrange-ment of things. The doctrine connects the beginnings with the end of things. The urgency of the ‘decisive choice’ 63 pressed on each person has to do with the fact that he or she in ‘choosing’ one or the other of the pairs in each dual set (thought, word, action) decides his or her fate in the afterlife. The primor-dial ‘choice’ made by Mazd ā and the drugvan \u0004 t mainiiu , respectively, of ‘good’ (thought, word, action) and ‘bad’ (thought, word, action) is not the prototype of the mortals’ choice. Rather it establishes the conditions of mortal existence and hence the dualistic ‘choice’ that each person faces. Now, this eschatological doctrine explicitly refers to the da ē vas and their cult against which it asserts itself. The poet incorporates these gods into his doctrine and evaluative scheme, where they are subordinated to the drugvan \u0004 t mainiiu and ipso facto condemned. The agonistic reduction makes it likely that the idea of a primordial ‘bad’ mai-niiu is an original contribution of the poet. The concrete reality behind the new dualistic doctrine is the da ē va cult and the poet’s total opposition to it. What is the basis of this opposition? One would have to know what the purpose of the da ē va cult is. We turn to this question in the following chapter.

See also Smith 1978 , pp. 67–87, pp. 190–207. 2 See Kellens 1994a , pp. 59–61, pp. 80–87, pp. 117–19. 3 Cantera ( 2012 , p. 219) divides the YH into three sections: the introductory Y 35; the ritual core Y 36–39; and the concluding Y 40–41: Y 36 ‘seems to mark the beginning of the ritual action accompanied by YH , the offering of meat to the fi re, with the consecration of the fi re on which the victim is going to be placed’. 4 See also Cantera 2012 , pp. 226–27: ‘The YH is a ritual text with direct references to the ritual action it served. Since this ritual action disappeared as a consequence of abandoning animal sacrifi ce, such references are no longer easy to understand completely, but sometimes they can still be recognized’. The thesis is interesting; if true it would explain why no ritual action takes place between Y 36 and 59. See Panaino 2004b , pp. 51–75 for an alternative account of the absence of ritual acts (‘l’int é riorisation du rituel’) during the recitation of the mentioned texts. See Kotwal and Boyd 1992 , pp. 112ff. The problem with Cantera’s thesis is that if indeed the yasna ritual originally included the sacrifi ce of an animal (for which one must rely on interpretation of allusive references in the text, e.g. Y 37.3, according to Cantera), one has to explain why it was ‘abandoned’, i.e. the historical circum-stances of its removal from the ritual, otherwise it becomes an ad hoc assumption. Compare Hintze 2012 , pp. 49–50. 5 Compare Y 34.12 kat ̃ t ō i r ā zar ə\u000e kat ̃ va šī k a t ̃ v ā stu \u0006 t ō kat ̃ v ā yasnahii ā sru \u0006 idii ā i mazd ā ‘O Mazd ā ! Which address (?) is for you? Which do you wish to hear, that of praise or that of consecration?’ Here again, toward the end of the fi rst G ā th ā , the poet refers to two types of discourse that may be addressed to the god: stut -type and yasna -type. In my mind, this shows that Kellens and Pirart’s syntactic analysis of staot ā c ā ... yesnii ā c ā as elliptical for *staot ā yesnii ā c ā vahmii ā c ā is gratuitous. See also Y 50.9. Insler ( 1975 , p. 33) interprets the two words as instrumental, and pro-duces a disjointed statement: ‘I shall speak of those things which are to be borne in mind – even by one who already knows – through both praise and worship for the very Wise Master of good thinking and for truth’, etc. 6 Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 2, p. 47) seems to posit uruu ā za- ‘delightful’, which, substan-tivized, would give the neuter plural ‘delightful things, the introduced antecedent of the relative pronoun: ‘(I shall proclaim) what delight (is) to be seen through the lights’ ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 123). 7 About 45.1dd′ ak ā varan ā dr ə guu å hizuu å . ā uu ə r ə t ō Kellens ( 1994a , p. 65) writes: ‘Il semble que les vers dd’... constituent une formule s é par é e et que c’est la force d é pr é cative de celle-ci qui va magiquement op é rer le tri: “Puisse celui qui donne de fausses d é fi nitions ne pas affaiblir le second é tat!” Il reste au chantre à constater l’effet de sa formule: “En fonction de ce choix (de nous) mauvais (pour lui), voici le Trompeur é cart é -du-sacrifi ce par la langue”’. 8 But who exactly is the addressee of the exhortation? According to Kellens’ ‘litur-gical’ interpretation of the G ā th ā s, it has to be the gods. One must admit that the notion that it is the gods that are being required to ‘declare’ their ritual choice is rather strange. 9 Incidentally, compare Thomas Mann’s comment in ‘ Joseph and His Brothers : A Lecture’: ‘If I were to state what I personally understand by religiosity I would say that it is attentiveness and obedience ’ (in Assmann 2006 , p. 215 n. 62). 10 Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 2, p. 48) gives interesting parallel Vedic phrases with pr á ti + budh , with the same meaning. His assumption of verbal government of nar ə\u000e m.nar ə m x v ax \u000b ii ā i tanuii ē by v ī ci θ a- is, however, artifi cial and without much sense: ‘invitations resulting from the discrimination of [acc.] each single man’ (Humbach 1991 , vol. 2, p. 47)."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"138 The choice 11 It is unclear here whether ‘test’ is derived from ‘travel’, as it is in a 1973 article (Kuiper 1973 , p. 183–86), or from ‘request’. 12 In his 2011/2012 lectures at the Coll è ge de France Kellens interprets it as the man-datory ritual section of ‘ é num é ration des noms propres’ (January 6, 2012). 13 Compare Kellens 2011 , pp. 63ff. and Cantera 2012 . 14 Compare Hintze 2012 , p. 49: ‘The ritual thus anticipates the state of perfection, described in Avestan as fra š ō .k ə r ə ti and pertaining to the end of time, when all Evil will be completely removed from the material world. From that point of view, it makes sense that Evil is not mentioned in the Yasna Hapta ŋ h ā iti because it does no longer exist in that special ritual moment. This interpretation derives support from the Gathas, in which the Yasna Hapta ŋ h ā iti is embedded, for the theme of “perfection,” fra š ō .k ə r ə ti , recurs at the end of each of the fi rst three’. But if so, can the ‘ritual moment’ mirroring the fi nal restoration of the material world precede any of the G ā th ā s, where combat against evil is underway? 15 See Panaino 2004b , pp. 66–75, pp. 95–105. Compare Kellens and Pirart 1997 , p. 51. I do not think the presence of the da ē vas may be understood as merely a genre requirement (‘praise and blame’), neither does Panaino ( 2004b , pp. 81–82). 16 See, for instance, Eliade 1985 , pp. 17–34, pp. 51–92. 17 See Hintze 2004a . 18 But compare Kellens 2011 , pp. 119–20, pp. 128–29. 19 But then compare Kellens and Pirart ( 1990 , p. 315), where they seem to classify the infi nitive as requiring an accusative complement. 20 See Kellens 1994b , p. 49. Insler’s translation of sast ē in Y 30.8 is in particular arti-fi cial: ‘the rule shall take place in order to announce itself to those’, etc. What does this mean? Compare Kellens 1994b , p. 55. 21 Compare Kellens 1994b , p. 53, who classifi es Y 44.17 and 49.3 as ‘infi nitive gov-erned adjectivally’. 22 See also Y 51.7: ‘O Mazd ā give me... immortality and integrity... and strength and youthful robustness when the declaration takes place ( s ə\u000eŋ\u000b h ē )’. 23 Since, generally speaking, for Humbach the gods are the interlocutor of the poet, are the ‘twins’ presented to them? 24 Gershevitch ( 1964 , pp. 32–33) maintains that the ‘locative’ paouruii ē from the adjective paouruuia- cannot mean ‘in the beginning’ but, used adverbially, has to be ‘at fi rst, fi rstly’. Accordingly, he translated the fi rst verse: ‘Firstly the twin Spirits [ lit. the two Spirits who (are) twins] were revealed (to me), each-endowed-with-own-wish (= free will)’. The adverb has to bear on ‘revelation’: the Spirits were at fi rst revealed. What could this mean? The same form ( paouruii ē ) of the adjective occurs in Y 45.2, again attached to the dual mainiiu \u0006 : 45.2aa′ at ̃ frauuax š ii ā a ŋ h ə\u000e u š mainiiu \u0006 paouruii ē . However one interprets the form (whether a locative or a nom. acc. dual), it cannot be separated from the ‘two intuitions’. Gershevitch makes it an adverb: ‘I shall mention fi rstly of the world the two Spirits’. This is problematic. ahu- does not seem to have a concrete sense (the ‘world’) in the G ā th ā s, but always an abstract meaning: ‘existence’ or ‘state’. The object of the ‘proclamations’ ( at ̃ frauuax š ii ā ) of the fi rst six stanzas is each time marked as ultimate, elevated: 45.1 ī m (ratu \u0006 m)... ci θ r ə\u000e ; 45.2 a ŋ h ə\u000e u š mainiiu \u0006 paouruii ē ; 45.3 a ŋ h ə\u000e u š ahii ā paouruu ī m... m ą θ r ə m ; 45.4 a ŋ h ə\u000e u š ahii ā vahi š t ə m ; 45.5 vac ə\u000e ... vahi š t ə m ; 45.6 v ī span ą m mazi š t ə m . There can hardly be any doubt that paouruii ē belongs with mainiiu \u0006 . Later he cor-rects himself, reading mainiiu \u0006 paouruii ē as nom. acc. dual: ‘the two primordial thoughts’ (1995, p. 17). 25 See de Vaan 2003 , pp. 422–24, for the edition to paouruii ē (PY) as opposed to Humbach’s and Kellens’ pauruii ē (SY). The adjective *paouruiia- regularly means ‘fi rst, primitive, former’. Bartholomae ( AW , col. 874) gives: ‘“der erste, primus,” nach Zeit und Ordnung’, that is to say, what comes before or fi rst in a sequence. For its Vedic counterpart pu \u0006 rvy á - Mayrhofer ( EWA , vol. 2, p. 157) has: ‘vormalig, fr ü her"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"The choice 139dagewesen, fr ü hest, vorz ü glichst,’ and for the adverb pu \u0006 rvy á m he has: ‘zuerst, fr ü her, zuvor’. Thus the Vedic adjective means ‘what precedes’, comparatively or absolutely, in a sequence, and from the latter sense it naturally develops the meaning ‘excellent, prime’. The G ā thic adjective apaouruiia- is ‘without precedent’. In none of its G ā thic occurrences does the adjective (or the adverb) have the sense of the hierarchical fun-dament. Used as an adverb paouruu ī m means ‘primordially, originally, fi rst, in the beginning’. I think the point is important and has to be stressed. Thus the adjective, contra Humbach, Kellens and Pirart, cannot mean ‘fundamental’. 26 The translation given in the text agrees with one of the two ‘variants’ they consider ‘les seuls choix raisonnables’ (Kellens and Pirart 1997 , p. 63). In the alternative variant the sense of x v af ə n ā is completely artifi cial: ‘les mainiiu (jumeaux) origi-nels/ fondamentaux qui sont connus / ont é t é connus pour leur sommeil (jumeau) au moment de penser et de dire’ (Kellens and Pirart 1997 , p. 63). What information are we given by ‘the two spirits that are known for their sleep during thought and speech’ or even ‘in respect of thought and speech’? That at the level (‘stade’) of thought or of speech in the ritual the two spirits are ‘sleep’ or ‘dreaming’, but then become active at the level of gesture? None of this makes much sense. 27 As for RV X 36.4ab gr ā v ā vadann á pa r á ks \u0004 ā m \r si sedhatu dus \u0004 v á pnyam \r n í rr ̥ tim \r v í ś vam atr í n \u0004 am , neither the associated negative terms nor the remedy against them (the ‘ringing pressing-stone’) to which the poet appeals makes Insler’s ‘ill rivalry’ more attractive than ‘nightmare’. See also Kellens and Pirart 1997 , p. 58. 28 ‘Like Mn ē mosyn ē , Al ē theia is the gift of second sight: an omniscience, like mem-ory, encompassing the past, present, and future. The nocturnal visions of dream, called Al ē thosyn ē , cover “the past, the present, and all that must be for many mortals, during their dark slumber”. And the Al ē theia of the Old Man of the Sea is knowledge “of all divine things, the present and the future”. As a power of prophecy, Al ē theia sometimes replaces Mn ē mosyn ē in certain experiences of incubatory prophecy, as in the story of Epimenides. Thus magus spoke with Al ē theia , accompanied by Dik ē , during his years of retreat, in the cave of Zeus Diktaios’ (Detienne 1999 , p. 65). The cited passages are from Euripides, Iphigeneia in Tauris and Helena , respectively. See further Detienne 1999 , p. 45: ‘In Hesiod’s poem we fi nd the most ancient representation of a poetic and religious Al ē theia . What is the Muses’ function according to the theology of speech deployed in the Theogony ? The Muses proudly claim the privilege of “speaking the truth” ( al ē theia g ē rusasthai ). The meaning of this Al ē theia is revealed by its relation to the Muses and to memory, for the Muses are those who “tell of what is, and what is to be, and what was before now”; they are the words of memory. The very context of the Theogony thus already indicates a close connection between Al ē theia and mem-ory and even suggests that one should understand these two religious powers as a single representation’. See Vernant 2006 , pp. 139–53 for the myths around the link between memory and death in ancient Greece. See also Gernet 1981 , pp. 220–26 on the notion of decisive proof. Under certain conditions, visions and words could immediately reveal the ‘real’ (e.g. beyond time) origins of existence, and this reve-lation was always vouchsafed to specially privileged fi gures such as inspired poets. The belief in the mantic power of dreams, and in the equivalence of sleep and death with respect to occult knowledge, is also found among the ancient Celts and ancient Germans. See Eliade 1964 , pp. 382–84. 29 Detienne ( 1999 , p. 123) cites the following tradition about Epimenides, the ‘magus’: ‘During the day Epimenides lay down in the cave of Zeus Diktaios and he slum-bered in a deep sleep for many years; he conversed in his dreams with the gods and spoke with Al ē theia and Dik ē ’. 30 See Malamoud 1996 , pp. 195–206. Thompson 1998 on the notion of satyakriy ā ‘truth-act’ and its relation to the fi gure of the inspired poet is very important. The utterance of effi cacious speech is immediately its realization.

Oracular speech does not refl ect an event that has already occurred; it is part of its realization... while the visions of dreams in which words were not realized ( akraanta ) were opposed to dreams that did “accomplish the truth” or “realize reality” ( etuma krainousin )’. 31 Both Pahlavi and Sanskrit translations of the verse treat it as an independent state-ment. The Pahlavi translation with the gloss (Kellens and Pirart 1997 , p. 34) reads: ‘ meni š n ud g ō wi š n ud kuni š n ā n ī har d ō az weh ud az–iz wattar ( ē k ā n ī weh men ī d ud guft ud kard ud ē k ā n [ ī ] wattar) ’: ‘thinking and speaking and doing, they that were two, one [picked?] from the good and one from the bad (one was the one who thought and spoke and did what is good, and one was the one who [thought and spoke and did] what is bad)’. Incidentally, the ‘good’ and the ‘bad’ in the Pahlavi translation seem to describe the members of the triad and not the spirits ( m ē n ō g ) – according to the gloss in any case. Neryosang’s Sanskrit translation (Kellens and Pirart 1997 , p. 35) reads: ‘ manasi ca vacasi ca karman \u0004 i ca tad dvitayam uttama ṁ ca nikr ̥ s \u0004 t \f a ṁ ca’ : ‘in thinking and speaking and doing, those two [spirits] are the best and the corrupted’. 32 Compare Kellens and Pirart 1997 , p. 49: ‘Dans une construction sujet + attribut, le locatif ne peut ê tre que strictement circonstanciel. Il faut comprendre que h ī est bon ou mauvais au moment de penser, au moment de dire, au moment de faire’. I have already pointed out the diffi culties this ‘rule’ gives rise to for their interpret-ation of Y 30.3a–b′. 33 Kellens’ translation of the three infi nitives in Y 31.5 undermines his proposed semantics of the verb, requiring for it a different object, for which the syntax does not provide: ‘ tat ̃ m ō i v ī cidii ā i vaoc ā ... v ī duii ē ... m ə\u000e n \u0004 c ā daidii ā i “dis-moi la (stipula-tion-d’alliance), afi n que je fasse (correctement) la diff é rence entre elle (et celles de la Tromperie), que je la connaisse et que je la m é dite”’ (Kellens 1994b , p. 55). 34 See Ahmadi 2012a . 35 See Ahmadi 2013 . 36 Their supporting material (Y 34.5a′) does not seem cogent to me: ya θ ā in this stanza ( ya θ ā v ā hahm ī ‘or as I sleep’) does not ‘suppl é e un datif nominal’ (Kellens and Pirart 1991 , p. 48). I discuss this phrase in due course below. 37 See Gonda 1962 for Homeric and Vedic examples and analysis. 38 Although Y 53.6 is badly damaged (see Kellens and Pirart 1991 , pp. 270–72), it perhaps describes the departure of the soul of the drugvan \u0004 t for the ‘house of druj’ ( dru \u0006 j ō hac ā r ā θ ə m ō ) where it will lead a ruined ‘mental existence’ ( ā manah ī m ahu \u0006 m m ə r ə n \u0004 g ə duii ē ).

See Gonda ( 1962 , pp. 197–98) for a discussion of the Vedic cognate, where he cites Benveniste’s opinion that the term p á nth ā - does not simply designate a track or way but ‘un franchissement’, that is, a perilous passage. ‘The actions of the tongue’ evoked here must be related to the context of Y 48.1.

If OP art ā c ā from Xerxes’ so-called Daiva Inscription is indeed for art ā hac ā , as Herrenschmidt ( 1993 ) maintains, it will be a further proof of the antiquity and formulaic nature of the phrase. As Skj æ rv ø (Schlerath and Skj æ rv ø 1987 ) has observed, the phrase is not translated in the Elamite ( ir–ta–ha–ci ) and Akkadian ( arta– šá ́ - ) versions of the OP text. ‘The normal word-order in Old Persian’, Skj æ rv ø writes, ‘is for hac ā to precede its noun’ (Schlerath and Skj æ rv ø 1987 ). 44 See Detienne 1999 , pp. 130–31 for a short discussion of the ‘path of truth’ in Parmenides, who has a privileged access to Al ē theia and, like the diviner and magus, is the ‘one who knows’. Detienne gives further bibliographic information on the topic. The connection between the poet’s ‘insight’ and salvation (‘return to life’) is brought out for archaic Greek material by Frame 1978 , pp. 1–33. See my discussion of the topic in Part III of this book. 45 The ablative + ā construction is generally used in Indo-Iranian to indicate the interval covered by a movement. The word in the ablative can be either the point of departure or that of arrival. Thus the construction could mean ‘all the way from X’ or ‘all the way to X’. The reversal in the sense of direction the ablative normally has (from ‘from out of ’ to ‘up to’) in the latter case must have been con-sequent to the regular use of the construction for indicating the interval covered by a movement, emphasizing the thoroughness of the coverage. Hence, the construc-tion signals the point of orientation, whether it implies movement (‘all the way up to a location’) or not (‘at a location’). In our passage, the priest’s attentive grasp of the straight paths is said to originate in the best intuition. It not only informs us about the special nature of the perception but, indirectly, also about the privileged position of the seer. 46 One can see that the account of the two primordial intuitions given in Y 30.3–5 has to be mythological, and not just psychological, as some scholars have it. Without its divine source related (‘realized’) in the myth, the poet’s speech is powerless. 47 The italic is due to the foregrounding of sp ə n \u0004 t ə m ‘vitalizing’ and thus belongs to the G ā thic text.

"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" 6 The da ē va cult Yasna 32 is a discourse on the da ē vas and their cult. 1 Unfortunately, it contains a number of crucial obscurities, lexical and otherwise. Thematically, it comprises two sections. The fi rst part (32.1–8) is on (1) the character of the da ē vas (32.1–5), and (2) Yima’s involvement in their cult (32.6–8). The remaining part (32.9–15) is about the actual da ē va cult, i.e. its features and priests, and, seemingly, the contemporary situation, especially if the mysterious gr ə h \" ma- turns out to be the name of a person. The last stanza Y 32.16 is hopelessly diffi cult to decipher. If by ‘character’ of the da ē vas one means the purpose and features of their cult, Y 32 is an exposition of their character. It appears from the fi rst stanza that these gods were traditionally viewed as controlling access to the divine sphere. Their cult is primarily dedicated to the ‘pursuit of immortality’, if one may rely on Y 48.1. Apparently, Yima, the Iranian counterpart of the Vedic psychopomp Yama, also took part in the da ē va cult. We can only wish we could more exactly know what is conveyed about him in Y 32.8bb′. A few decades ago, Kellens ( 1984b ) put forward the interesting idea that Yima, too, was the collector and guide of human souls to the realm of the dead and argued that he is behind the phrase cinuuat ō p ə r ə tu- ‘Bridge of the Collector’, the bridge that leads to the beyond. This means that the image of the bridge to the beyond must be pre-Zoroastrian. Hence Yima’s connection with the da ē va cult associates the da ē vas with eschatological functions. I mentioned at the end of the last chapter that the da ē va cult is the concrete reality behind the dugvan \u000f t mainiiu . If so, Zoroastrian dualism is grounded in the opposition to the da ē va cult. Just as the ‘good’ mainiiu is the divine source of Zarathu š tra’s extraordinary knowledge, the ‘bad’ mainiiu is thought to be the ‘deceiver’ of the participants of the da ē va cult; or, more exactly, it is in this way that the proponent of the new doctrine presents the ancient cult. The fact that the ‘bad’ mainiiu has not yet assumed in the G ā th ā s its later more or less fi xed epithet an \u000f gra- (or later ‘ a ŋ ra- ’) ‘hostile’ probably indicates that it is concep-tually inchoate. Zarathu š tra (the poet of the G ā th ā s, in any case) seems to be responsible for this conceptual development and the doctrine that is based on it. Invoking the oppositional nexus and the eschatological role of the da ē vas , one may put forward the hypothesis that Mazd ā and other G ā thic deities,"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The daēva cult 147especially A \u0007 rmaiti, took over the eschatological function of the da ē vas . I have argued in an article that this is how the Ahuna Vairiia may be understood, namely the appointment of the supreme god as, among others, the dispenser of the ‘soteriological measure’ ( a ṣ̌ ā t hac ā ratu- ). 2 In a Young Avestan exegesis of the stanza, Mazd ā is described as the ‘guide’ ( fradax š tar- ) for the mind, which is already to be found in the G ā th ā s (cf. Y 51.3). In the V ī d ē vd ā d 19.29 the god is the creator of the ‘bridge’ that leads to paradise ( cinuuat .p ə r ə tu- mazda δ ā ta- ), and the da ē n ā is the psychopomp (V 19.30). In the late Vi š t ā sp Ya š t (32–33), Mazd ā and the Am əṣ̌ a Sp ə n \u000f tas guide the soul to Mazd ā ’s ‘house of welcome’ for a ‘long blissful existence in the mental state’ ( manahiieheca a ŋ h ə̄ u š dar ə γ ā i hauua ŋ\u000b h ā i ). 3 In these passages we clearly see how Mazd ā and other G ā thic gods have assumed the function that one may think to have belonged to the da ē vas and their cult. In the G ā th ā s we discover signifi cant fragments of the process of replacement of the da ē vas by G ā thic deities in fi eri .

Humbach makes it a vocative: ‘The family entreats, the community along with the tribe (do so) in my recital, O you Da ē vas , (entreating) for His, the Wise Ahura’s favour’ (Humbach 1991 , vol. 1, p. 132). So does Insler ( 1975 , p. 45): ‘At my insistence, ye gods, the family, the community together with the clan, entreated for the grace of Him, the Wise Lord’. Insler refuses to read da ē uu ā in the nominative because these gods ‘never sought to serve AhM., only the evil spirit, and this was their great offense and the fi rst ruin of the world’ (Insler 1975 , p. 196). The repetition of the genitive pronoun ahii ā , however, makes this analysis improbable. It is not clear from their translated texts, nor from their comments (Humbach 1991 , vol. 2, p. 77; Insler 1975 , p. 196), what role they give to Y 32.1b ahii ā . Kellens and Pirart ( 1991 , p. 81) and Schwartz ( 2006 , p. 469) read da ē uu ā in the nominative. According to them, the repetition of the pronoun anticipating the name of the god is used to coordinate the subjects. Kellens and Pirart further maintain that the mat + instrumental construction in Y 32.1a′ ‘d é limite, dans le groupe des sujets, le sous-groupe positif, de telle sorte que la circonstance exprim é e par le locatif libre mahm ī man ō i ne vaut que pour da ē uu ā ’ (Kellens and Pirart 1991 , p. 81). They seem to think that the evaluative differentiation between the da ē vas and the human groups must somehow be refl ected in the"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"148 The daēva cultsyntax, and make it the role of mat + instrumental, which is merely a sociative construction (Kellens and Pirart 1990 , p. 3). The purpose of the differentiation is to signal that the adverse phrase mahm ī man ō i ‘ à ma grande irritation’ only applies to the ‘gods’. According to them and Schwartz, the direct discourse of Y 32.1cc′ is uttered by all the named subjects, but the syntax and sense of the utterance is differently interpreted by these scholars. Schwartz ( 2006 , p. 469) translates 32.1cc′: ‘We will be Thy messengers, hold-ing back those who are inimical to You’, reading d ā raii ō as an infi nitive ‘to hold’ (so Hoffmann and Forssman 2004 , p. 242, and Lommel 1971 , p. 60). However, such an oath would be paradoxical for the da ē uuas (demon-gods, and adjectivally, their worshippers)... the da ē uua -camp, in pretend-ing to promote the Mazdean mission, can declare their true nature and agenda, i.e. obfuscation. And, using ξ dar for ‘uphold, hold as intimate’ (thus Y46.3, Y46.5, and Y49.2), rather than (e.g. Y46.7) ‘hold back’, the pretenders voice their true intention to embrace Mazd ā ’s enemies. Thus Y32.1 contains a sincere oath by righteous members of society, as well as the duplicitous ( daibit ā na- ‘double-meaning’) counterfeit by the society which represents the da ē uuas . (Schwartz 2006 , p. 469) There are two problems with this interpretation. In the fi rst place, there is no indication here or elsewhere in the G ā th ā s that the name of the ‘gods’ is also used as a descriptive adjective to refer to their worshippers. It seems to me, rather, that Schwartz is forced to see behind da ē uu ā human subjects because he places all the supplicants in one group and thus homogenizes them at some level. The Y 32.1cc′ utterance is accordingly placed in the mouths of all these subjects. On the other hand, there must be a way of marking the requisite difference between the utterance of the true worshippers of the supreme god and that of the duplicitous pretenders. Schwartz makes the semantically ambivalent ξ dar ‘hold’ perform the role of differentiating between the ‘righteous members of society’ and the ‘ da ē uua -camp’. The lat-ter, he argues, intends to be understood as saying ‘we want to be your messen-gers, too, holding back your enemies!’, but, in using the treacherous verb, it betrays itself: ‘we embrace your enemies!’ Analysing the word in the nomina-tive, Schwartz sees in the stanza, not a ‘recalling of the wrong choice’ that the gods made (so Insler), but an unintended staging of the deception intended by the worshippers of the da ē vas . According to him, the righteous group is approvingly answered in Y 32.2 while the duplicitous one is rebuked in Y 32.3 and Y 32.12. 4 The groups are, in fact, differentiated and addressed accord-ingly by the supreme god. In 32.2 Mazd ā addresses the human supplicants: ‘to them ( a ē ibii ō )... Mazd ā Ahura replies’, etc. The da ē vas are addressed sep-arately in Y 32.3, whether by Mazd ā or by the poet on behalf of the god. This opposition may refl ect the speech situation of the original address in 32.1: the human supplicants are only allowed an indirect speech, mediated by the"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"The daēva cult 149poet himself, while the ‘gods’ are given a direct speech, the content of which, moreover, shows that it cannot have ordinary mortals as the subject. As we saw, the genitive pronoun coordinates all the supplicants in respect of the request for heavenly bliss made to Mazd ā . It is not plausible, even if Kellens and Pirart’s rendition of mahm ī man ō i is accepted, that the differentiation of the human groups and the da ē vas solely serves the purpose of expressing the poet’s selective disapproval ( mahm ī man ō i ). 5 The phrase must rather signal the differentiation of the subjects in respect of the direct speech. Our analysis of the content of the direct speech will make it clear that it is only the da ē vas that speak in Y 32.1cc′. Kellens and Pirart ( 1988 , p. 118) read d ā raii ō as an injunctive present, and translate the direct speech in 32.1cc′: ‘Nous voulons ê tre tes messagers; con-tinue à retenir ceux qui vous sont hostiles’. This interpretation is unlikely. A volitive expression on one’s own behalf is liable to be construed by a superior interlocutor as a presumption, unless accompanied by a mitigating statement. The infi nitive d ā raii ō would provide such a statement, tactfully pointing to the god’s interest being served. If the word is understood in the injunctive, the suspicion of possible presumption is in fact confi rmed. Moreover, the injunct-ive statement ‘continue to hold back your enemies!’ is a nonsensical ( unsinnig ) utterance. Kellens and Pirart’s attempt at producing a sense for it by imagin-ing a fi tting context, according to their own admission, ends in failure. Le demande faite à Mazd ā (1cc′), en opposant ceux qui sont mis en route et ceux qui sont retenus immobiles par le grand dieu, implique la soumis-sion à un jugement. Or, curieusement, ce jugement, Mazd ā ne le rend pas dans sa r é ponse. Il ne faut y voir rien d’autre qu’un effet de style offrant à l’auditeur un petit suspense convenu. (Kellens and Pirart 1991 , p. 77) It is hard to see what convention they have in mind. The word dū ta- , usu-ally translated as ‘messenger’, 6 has a specifi c sense in the G ā th ā s. Although it occurs only twice, the contexts are signifi cant. The ‘messenger’ controls the access to the divine sphere. In Y 32.13 the ‘messenger’ of the supreme god’s man θ r ā n (the bearer of divine formulae) is said to be able to hold back unnamed but obviously hostile aspirants from ‘seeing a ṣ̌ a ’: Y 32.13cc′: θβ ahii ā m ą θ r ā n ō dū t ə4 m, y ə\u0010 ı \u0002 š p ā t dar ə s ā t a ṣ̌ ahii ā . 7 The expression ‘seeing a ṣ̌ a ’ must mean acceding to the abode of the gods. The place where the soul enjoys the supreme god’s bliss, and the domain of a ṣ̌ a in Y 32.13 must be semantically equivalent to Mazd ā ’s blissful domain in Y 32.1. In both, access to the divine sphere is at issue. The agents of the direct speech in Y 32.1cc′ ask Mazd ā to let them be his ‘messengers’ so that they may hold back those who are hostile from the god’s domain. Perception of the invisible, or knowledge of things divine, is the restricted privilege of particular social types in ancient societies. The restriction must be all the more stringent when it is a question of the control of access to the divine sphere. It is thus impossible to imagine that"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"150 The daēva culthuman groups at large have such a pretension, expressed approvingly by the poet whose position would then be undermined. In fact, Mazd ā ’s reply in Y 32.2 to the human supplicants hardly leaves any doubt that no such claim is understood to have been made by the latter. On the other hand, as we will see, the charges laid against the da ē vas in 32.3–5 have to be understood in refer-ence to their claim in 32.1cc′. These observations also shed light on the troublesome mahm ī man ō i . If the da ē vas are the exclusive subject of the direct speech in Y 32.1cc′, one may rightly expect that this is indicated in mahm ī man ō i . Kellens and Pirart give man ō i a negative connotation (‘irritation’) expressing the poet’s attitude toward the da ē vas ’ impertinent request. But the knowledge conveyed in Y 32.1cc′ requires a special mode of cognition, i.e. the poet’s privileged power of insight into the invisible. Derivatives of the roots meaning ‘perceive’ or ‘con-ceive’ (e.g. mainiiu- or cisti- ) are used to express this cognitive privilege in the G ā th ā s. It is the regular practice of the poet to declare the means by which he has come to the possession of his supernatural knowledge (leaving aside the many instances of direct communication by the god): e.g. Y 30.3a′ x v af ə n ā ; 31.8a m ə̄ŋ\u000b h ī ; 32.1b man ō i ; 43.2c′ sp ə̄ ni š t ā mainiiū ; 44.2e mainiiū ; 47.2d cist ī ; 51.21 cist ī ; etc. Given the convergent data, it makes more sense in my mind to understand mahm ī man ō i in the sense of ‘in my vision’, or, in any case, as referring to an availing attunement of the mind. The locative case, instead of the expected instrumental, may be explained by the fact that mahm ī man ō i plays the role of a gerundive, i.e. articulating the circumstances. 8 Y 32.2 a ē ibii ō mazd å ahur ō , s ā r ə mn ō vohū mana ŋ h ā x š a θ r ā t hac ā pait ī .mraot , a ṣ̌ ā hu š .hax ā x v ə̄ nuu ā t ā sp ə n \u000f t ą m v ə̄ ā rmait ī m, va ŋ v h ī m var ə maid ī h ā n ə̄ a ŋ hat To them, Mazd ā Ahura, the loyal friend, joined with the sun-drenched a ṣ̌ a through (or: along with) good thinking, replies from (his) realm: ‘we choose your vitalizing, good attunement (A \u0007 rmaiti). Let her be with us!’ Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 132) translates the middle participle s ā r ə mn ō ‘shel-tered by’ and in his comments he equates this meaning with ‘associated with’. So Y 32.2a′ becomes: ‘sheltered by [associated with] good thought’ or ‘shelter-ing Himself with good thought’ (Humbach 1991 , vol. 2, p. 78). But these two translations are not the same thing. Humbach thinks that the Avestan ξ sar is a cognate of the Vedic ξ ś ar , which gives ś á rman- , referring generally to a pro-tective cover. Mayrhofer ( EWA , vol. 2, p. 620) gives the following meanings for it: ‘Schirm, Schutzdach, Decke, Obhut, Zufl ucht’. In the Avesta, however, ξ sar means ‘join, unite’. Bartholomae ( AW , col. 1563) gives ‘vereinigen’ for the verb, and ‘Vereinigung, Verbindung’ ( AW , col. 1564) for the root noun sar- . Lommel ( 1971 , p. 60), Insler ( 1975 , pp. 196–97), Narten ( 1986 ), Kellens ( 1974 , pp. 390–92), Hoffmann and Forssman ( 2004 , p. 138), and Hintze ( 2007a , p. 353) translate the noun as ‘union’. Humbach’s derivation of one"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"The daēva cult 151sense from the other is artifi cial: ‘The mid. of the pres. sara- has the recipro-cal meaning of “to be in mutual shelter with” > “to be associated with”, etc.’ (Humbach 1991 , vol. 2, p. 78). The noun regularly appears in constructions with dependents either in the genitive or instrumental, e.g. Y 35.8 a ṣ̌ ahii ā ... sair ī ‘union with a ṣ̌ a ’, Y 44.17 sar ō i... hauruu ā t ā am ə r ə t ā t ā ‘union with integ-rity and immortality’. Thus the participial phrase s ā r ə mn ō vohū mana ŋ h ā ... a ṣ̌ ā ... xv ə̄ nuu ā t ā means ‘united with sun-drenched a ṣ̌ a through good think-ing’ or ‘joined with good thinking and the sun-drenched a ṣ̌ a ’. The instrumen-tal a ṣ̌ ā ‘with a ṣ̌ a ’ is almost certainly comitative, and the epithet ‘sun-drenched’ evokes a place, the divine sphere. The adverbial x š a θ r ā t hac ā is, in my mind, misunderstood in the litera-ture. Lommel ( 1971 , p. 60) translates it ‘aus seiner Herrschermacht heraus’; Insler ( 1975 , p. 45) ‘as befi ts His rulership’; Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 132) ‘in accordance with (His) power’; Kellens and Pirart ( 1988 , p. 118) ‘ à cause de l’emprise (rituelle)’. The construction abl. + hac ā , however, seems to have a specifi c sense in the Old Avestan texts. The preposition is derived from ξ hac ‘associate with, follow’ and has a cognate in the Vedic adverb s á c ā ‘zusam-men, mit, zugleich, dabei, bei’ ( EWA , vol. 2, p. 688). When used with verbs implying movement in the Young Avestan texts, the construction concrete abl. + hac ā means ‘from X’, where ‘X’ is a noun with a concrete sense. In the Old Avestan texts, however, the construction does not have this sense; here, except in two instances, one could translate the construction as ‘in accordance with X’, where ‘X’ is (understood to be) an abstract noun. This is in fact the usual translation of the phrase. The two exceptions are crucial. One is found in the YH: Y 37.2 y ō i g ə̄ u š hac ā š\u000b iiein \u000f t ī , which Hintze ( 2007a , p. 168) translates ‘who are on the side of the cow’. 9 Following Bartholomae ( AW , col. 1706), Hintze ( 2007a , p. 169) maintains that the ‘verb š i “to dwell” is used metaphorically... The combination of š i with the postposition ā or hac ā and the ablative case is a fi gure for being “on someone’s side” and literally means “to dwell from someone’s point of view”’. This explanation is unlikely. The ‘literal’ mean-ing, if it were to develop into the ‘metaphorical’ one, has to be understood in the sense of ‘dwelling next door’. The YH verbal phrase does not mean something like ‘to have the cow’s viewpoint’ but, according to Hintze, ‘to be on the side of the cow’, i.e. to be ‘committed to care for the cow’ (Hintze 2007a , p. 169). Thus, it is not the verb that is used metaphorically but the whole verbal phrase ξ š i + the abl. + hac ā . If so, the abl. + hac ā must mean something like ‘next to the abl.’ or ‘near the abl.’ or ‘at the abl.’ ‘Dwelling next to something’, when used metaphorically, becomes ‘standing by something’. This sense of the abl. + hac ā as ‘next to the noun in the ablative’ seems to be confi rmed by the second exception: Y 44.17b–c ka θ ā mazd ā zar ə m car ā n ī hac ā x š m ā t ā sk ə it ī m x š m ā k ą m ‘O Mazd ā , how could I make my aspiration to be with you into (being in) your company?’ Hoffmann and Forssman ( 2004 , p. 53) analyse ā sk ə iti- < * ā sk ə ti- < * ā -skti- , and translate ‘Gefolgschaft’. The masculine noun zara- means ‘aspiration, striving’. Bartholomae ( AW , col. 1670) gives ‘Streben, Ziel’ and links it with the Vedic h á ryati ‘er strebt nach’."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"152 The daēva cultFor Vedic ξ har Mayrhofer ( EWA , vol. 2, p. 804) has ‘sich freuen, Gefallen fi nden, gern haben’, and for haryat á ‘begehrenswert, erw ü nscht’. Here the abl. + hac ā must have the meaning ‘aupr è s de vous’ or ‘with you’. The conven-tional translation of the construction as ‘in accordance with’ may be under-stood to have developed from the sense of ‘being oriented toward’, and this latter from ‘being at’ a location. Thus Y 32.2 x š a θ r ā t hac ā would mean being present at his kingdom: the god replies from his kingdom. Now, we are in the fortunate position of being able to verify this meaning. In Y 32.2 we fi nd the supreme god joint with a ṣ̌ a in his kingdom addressing the mortals’ desire to accede to the god’s abode – mortals who are asked for their attunement to the divine, presumably as the condition of succeeding in their quest. The situation is identical in Y 49.5 Y 49.5 at huu ō mazd ā ī ž ā c ā ā zū iti š c ā y ə̄ da ē n ą m vohū s ā r əš t ā mana ŋ h ā ā rmat ō i š kasc ī t a ṣ̌ ā huz ə̄ n \u000f tu š t ā i š c ā visp ā i š θβ ahm ī x š a θ r ō i ahur ā But the noble man of divine attunement, whoever he might be, O Mazd ā Ahura, who joins his vision-soul to a ṣ̌ a by means of good thinking, (is like) refreshment and libation (that reach you), with all these he (will be) in your kingdom. 10 The point of assimilation to ‘refreshment and libation’ is not necessarily that the noble man (i.e. his soul 11 ) becomes a sacrifi cial offering, but that just as the traditional sacrifi cial offerings reach the gods, so too the soul of the properly attuned person, although the ‘sacrifi cial’ sense may be a plausible inference. The locative θβ ahm ī x š a θ r ō i here all but guarantees that Y 32.2b x š a θ r ā t hac ā has a locative sense, i.e. the god replies from his kingdom, where the attuned soul is received. Generally speaking, ā rmaiti- seems to designate the proper disposition of the faithful toward the supreme god, or perhaps divinity as such, in the G ā th ā s. It has been translated as ‘Denken, wie es sich geh ö rt, rechtes, dem g ö ttlichen Gebot und Willen sich f ü gendes Denken, Frommergebenheit’ ( AW , col. 335); ‘pens é e qui prend justement en consid é ration, qui honore comme il convient, d é f é rence’ (Kellens and Pirart 1990 , p. 219); ‘Rechtgesinntheit’ (Hoffmann and Forssman 2004 , p. 289); ‘right-mindedness’ (Hintze 2007a , p. 334); ‘piety’ (Insler 1975 , p. 45); ‘F ü gsamkeit’ (Lommel 1971 , p. 60).

There might even be some form of association between ā rmaiti and the earth, but the nature of this association is far from clear and, more importantly, it does not seem to be conceptually signifi cant in the G ā th ā s. Female deities are generally associated with the earth, waters, fertility and the domestic sphere; and the G ā thic goddess does seem to have an affi nity with the promotion of ga ē θ ā - ‘living creature’ (Y 43.6, 46.12, possibly 44.10), but this is not exclusive (cf. Y 46.13). The mythological stereotype, however, is hardly an adequate basis for seeing the ‘genius of the earth’ behind G ā thic ā rmaiti as its primary meaning. What could Y 32.2cc′ possibly mean if we read the ‘genius of the earth’ for ā rmaiti- ? In fact, this verse proves that the word must be understood in the sense of a certain mental disposition of mortals toward the gods. The plural genitive pronoun v ə̄ in the verse certainly has a possessive sense. Even if divinized, here and elsewhere in the G ā th ā s, ā rmaiti- preserves its abstract meaning in the activities the goddess performs or patronizes. It has been remarked time and again that it is diffi cult to decide for each particu-lar occurrence whether a divinized abstraction is personifi ed or designates a sacred capacity. In either case, one cannot presume that the term refers to just one type of activity. In two passages (Y 33.13, 43.1), A \u0007 rmaiti seems to have a psychopompic role, embodying the attunement of the mortals to the divine sphere; and in two (Y 32.2, 43.16), the wish is expressed that she be present in the heavenly realm. It is also by virtue of the proper mental disposition of the worshippers ( ā rmaiti- ) that Mazd ā receives (ideal) youthful strength ( t ə uu ī š i- ): Y 33.12a-b′ us m ō i uz ā r əš uu ā ahur ā , ā rmait ī t ə uu ī šı \u0002 m dasuu ā / sp ə̄ ni š t ā mainiiū mazd ā , va ŋ huii ā zauu ō ā d ā ‘Appear to me, O Ahura Mazd ā , through the most vitalizing intuition! Take youthful strength through (my) attunement (and) vivacity through the sacred offering!’ It seems, then, that ā rmaiti- is the proper disposition of mortals toward the gods that both ensures their own access to the divine sphere and invigorates the gods. In Y 33.13 A \u0007 rmaiti is asked to ‘conduct home’ the ‘vision-souls’ because of the vitalizing a ṣ̌ a .

In Y 51.17 the poet wishes that Mazd ā make vigorous Fra ṣ̌ ao š tra’s ‘vision-soul’ so he may attain the g ə r əž di- (a state of intense desire?) for a ṣ̌ a .

To repeat: mundane and ritual observances shape one’s da ē n ā , which in turn seals one’s destiny after death. It seems, then, that the ‘vision-soul’ is the faculty of a special kind of per-ception, namely, that of the insight that guides one to the divine sphere. 19 Y 43.1 is best analysed in the following way. Y 43.1 u š t ā ahm ā i, yahm ā i u š t ā kahm ā ic ī t vas ə̄ x š aii ą s, mazd å d ā ii ā t ahur ō utaiiū it ī , t ə uu ī šı \u0002 m gat .t ō i vas ə m ī a ṣ̌ə m d ə r ə idii ā i, tat m ō i d å ā rmait ē r ā ii ō a ṣ̌ı \u0002 š , va ŋ h ə̄ u š ga ē m mana ŋ h ō Happy is he, whosoever, for whom Mazd ā Ahura, having absolute dis-position (over it), fulfi lls (his) wish!

O A \u0007 rmaiti, give that to me (and) the rewards of (divine) opulence (and) the life of good thinking. The neuter pronoun tat is an anaphoric pronoun, referring to d ə r ə idii ā i and gat .t ō i . 20 The infi nitive does not mean here ‘to uphold’ (contra Insler 1975 , p. 61: ‘in order to uphold the truth’) but ‘to hold’. 21 The wish to ‘embrace a ṣ̌ a ’ and ‘reach youthfulness and robust strength’ is eschatological; it must be a fi gure of the desired afterlife. The adjective used of a ṣ̌ a in Y 32.2, x v ə̄ nuuan \u000f t- , means ‘possessed of the sun’ or simply ‘sunny’, strongly suggesting spatial contiguity or proximity; in any case, it is a topographic qualifi cation. It indicates the divine space, the abode of the gods, just as much as raoc ō ŋ huuan \u000f t- ‘possessed of heavenly lights’, used in Y 37.4 of a ṣ̌ a , does. 22 In Y 43.16d–e′ the poet expresses his"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"The daēva cult 155wish that A \u0007 rmaiti be present in the ‘sun-drenched kingdom’: x v ə̄ n \u000f g.dar ə s ō i, x š a θ r ō i x \u000b ii ā t ā rmaiti š / a ṣ̌ı \u0002 m š\u000b iiao θ an ā i š , vohū daid ī t mana ŋ h ā ‘Let A \u0007 rmaiti be present in the sun-drenched kingdom!

Kellens maintains that the genitive determination is objective: ‘qui voit le soleil = expos é au soleil’ (Kellens and Pirart 1991 , p. 169). Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 156) does not admit the compound and translates the phrase x v ə̄ n \u000f g.dar ə s ō i ‘in the view of the sun’, reading it with the previous verse line. Lommel ( 1971 , p. 100: ‘sonneblickenden’) and Insler ( 1975 , p. 65: ‘who has the appear-ance of the sun’) understand the genitive in the subjective sense, Kuiper ( 1964 , p. 120) in the objective sense. 24 From its usage in Y 32.13, one can gather that dar ə sa- has the sense of ‘(act of) seeing’ rather than ‘look’ or ‘appear-ance’. Thus the genitive in x v ə̄ n \u000f g.dar ə sa- should probably be understood in the objective sense. Whether the possessive adjective is used of the ‘kingdom’ or of the god (in ellipsis) makes no difference to the point made here. In either case the epithet indicates the divine sphere. The poet wishes that A \u0007 rmaiti be present in the divine kingdom and give his reward, e.g. ascension to the divine sphere. This is reminiscent of Y 32.2. In Y 43.1, as we just saw, the poet asks her, among others, for god-like existence ( a ṣ̌ə m d ə r ə idii ā i ). In Y 32.1 the mor-tals ask Mazd ā for the bliss or joy that the god grants. 25 Mazd ā ’s reply to this request in 32.2cc′ shows that the god understands this request to be that of access to the divine sphere, and that he cherishes the prospect of the presence of the goddess that stands for the supplicants’ divine attunement. It seems, then, that ā rmaiti- is the proper disposition of men toward the gods that both ensures their own access to the divine sphere and invigorates the gods.

Gershevitch believes that this stanza proves his monotheistic interpretation of the G ā th ā s – followed by other adherents of the thesis. 26 There is a gen-eral consensus among scholars about the syntax of Y 32.3a–b′, if not about its sense; and the testimony of the Young Avestan texts seems to support the"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"156 The daēva cultcommon view. Gershevitch’s translation is more or less representative of this view: ‘But you gods all are a manifestation of evil thinking, and he who so-much worships you (is a manifestation) of falsehood and dissent’ (Gershevitch 1975 , p. 79). Insler ( 1975 , p. 45) has: ‘But ye gods – as well as the one who worships you – all of you are the offspring stemming from evil thinking, deceit and disrespect’. And Lommel ( 1971 , p. 60) translates: ‘Aber ihr G ö tter alle seid Same (Abk ö mmlinge) aus schlechtem Denken, und wer euch hoch verehrt aus L ü ge und Hochmut’. Kellens and Pirart ( 1988 , p. 119) give: ‘Vous, tous les (mauvais) dieux, et le chef qui vous fait cons é cration, vous ê tes la mani-festation m ê me de la mauvaise Pens é e, de la Tromperie et de la N é gligence’. The usage ‘noun in the ablative + ci θ ra- + be’, where ci θ ra- is a noun meaning either ‘manifestation’ or ‘essence’, seems to be attested in the Young Avestan texts, FrW 10.40: sp ə n \u000f t ā t haca mainiiaot zara θ u š tra a ē šą m ci θ r ə m vahi š t ā at ca mana ŋ hat ‘their (i.e. the souls of the righteous) seed or apparition (is) from the vitalizing intuition, O Zarathu š tra, from the best thinking’, and, albeit with another verb, in Yt. 13.87: yahmat haca fr ā θβ ə r ə sat n ā f ō airiian ą m dax \u000b iiun ą m ci θ r ə m airiian ą m dax \u000b iiun ą m ‘from whom (i.e. Gaya Martan) (Mazd ā ) fash-ioned the families of the Aryan nations, the essence or apparition of the Aryan nations’. 27 The ablative case can certainly convey the sense of origination. This sense is clearly present, for example, in these two passages: the apparition or essence of the Aryan nations originates in, comes from, Gaya Martan, etc. The singularity of ‘apparition’ together with the plurality of ‘Aryan nations’ that determines it probably indicates that the phrase expresses a speculation about the ‘true’ origin of the worldly phenomenon in question (cf. Yt 13.87). Is the supposed idiomatic usage adopted from the G ā thic Y 32.3 or does it underlie the latter? Or, a third possibility, are the two independent from each other? If the second scenario is right, the idiom must have already developed into a fi xed formula in the G ā th ā s, since it escapes the rule of the agreement of the subject and the attribute in case, number and gender. As far as I know, only Kellens and Pirart have acknowledged the grammatical anomaly of the syntax of Y 32.3aa′, without, however, analysing it any further. ‘L’emploi de l’adj. ci θ ra- , comme substantif neutre attribut du sujet et r é gissant l’ablatif, est in é dit et il nous para î t sage de consid é rer qu’il n’existe aucune interpr é tation s û re: notre traduction n’est rien d’autre qu’une approximation incertaine’ (Kellens and Pirart 1991 , p. 82). If, by contrast, the fi rst interpretation is correct, it would mean that the use of the idiom ‘the abl. noun + ci θ ra- (determined genitivally by a plural subject)’ to express a relation of primordial origination is due to the fact that Y 32.3aa′ was understood by the Mazdaean tradition as a state-ment about the origins of the da ē vas . This understanding of the context is, of course, completely warranted. Now, in this context, one can analyse the verbal phrase yū š da ē uu ā v ī sp åŋ h ō ak ā t mana ŋ h ō st ā ci θ r ə m in two ways: either one makes the ablative noun the complement of the verb and ci θ r ə m an adverb, or one makes ci θ r ə m the attribute of the gods (and the ‘great one’), governing the ablative noun. Read in the latter way, the construction would then become an authorized idiom for expressing genealogical relations."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"The daēva cult 157 It seems to me that the second picture is implausible. First, the adjective ci θ ra- , in its other occurrences in the G ā th ā s, shows no tendency toward acquir-ing the meaning and the grammatical role it is supposed to have in Y 32.3aa′. In all the other passages (Y 31.22, 33.7, 44.16, 45.1) where it occurs, the word is an adjective and means something like remarkable (abstract) or luminous, splendid (concrete). Moreover, the Indo-Iranian stems in ra (e.g. cit-ra ) are either adjectives or concrete nouns, many of these substantivized adjectives. 28 What reason is there to assume that ci θ ra- is a noun with an abstract meaning like ‘appearance’ or ‘manifestation’ in Y 32.3? Second, even if the supposed idiomatic use of the word as an abstract noun (i.e. for expressing a ‘true’ rela-tion of origination) is allowed, one still cannot see why it should contravene one of the most basic rules of the grammar, the agreement of the subject and the attribute. The two Young Avestan instances are grammatically impeccable, and in each of them ci θ r ə m seems to have a concrete sense, whether appar-ition or seed. Finally, if we look past the anomaly one way or another, we would still have to resolve a formidable problem of sense, as ci θ r ə m applies not only to the gods but also to ma š the ‘great one’. One has to come up with a sense of origination that can reasonably apply to both the gods and a mortal. 29 The sense of a spiritual genealogy would not satisfy the proponents of the monotheistic thesis, as Y 32.3a–b′ is supposed to be, in their opinion, the G ā thic statement regarding the ontological nullity of the gods of poly-theism, which are nothing but ‘ thoughts , conceived by erroneously thinking men’ (so Gershevitch 1975 , p. 80). Hence, ma š ‘the great one’ must also be merely a ‘thought conceived by erroneously thinking men’. Note also that in the two Young Avestan passages cited above, ci θ r ə m is used to express a real relation of origination: both the ‘souls of the righteous dead’ and the ‘Aryan nations’ are real entities in the sense that an adherent of the monotheistic the-sis would not accept for the da ē vas . In any case, it is hard to see what sense would be appropriate for the supposed shared attribute other than that of a metaphorical ‘manifestation’, in the verbal sense of this term. 30 Again, ci θ r ə m in Y 32.3a′ cannot have a concrete sense, which is the only sense attested for it as a noun in the Young Avestan texts – if for no other reason than the fact that it is supposed to be shared by the gods and their mortal worshipper. At the same time, one cannot see how ci θ r ə m ‘appearance’ can have a verbal sense, i.e. in the statement ‘you all, the gods and the leader who worships you, are a manifestation of bad thought’. 31 Nothing better than Gershevitch’s and Kellens and Pirart’s translations prove this abortive sense: they translate the ablative as if it were a genitive. The problems involved in this analysis of the syntax of Y 32.3a–b′ are too formidable, and the reading should therefore be abandoned. The usage of ci θ ra- as a noun in some of the Young Avestan pas-sages may perhaps be traced to the G ā thic Y 32.3. If so, it seems to be due to a misunderstanding: while the sense of the stanza and the context was rightly understood, the syntax of Y 32.3aa′ was incorrectly analysed. If, on the other hand, the Young Avestan sense of the noun ci θ ra- is independent from the G ā thic verse, this latter was wrongly assimilated to a familiar usage."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"158 The daēva cult The fi rst syntactic scheme mentioned above, i.e. ξ ah ‘be’ with an ablative complement in the sense of ‘being from or grounded in the noun in the abla-tive’, creates no grammatical problem. The verbal phrase ‘ us + ξ st ā + ablative complement’ is attested only in Yt 8.32 ( us a δ ā t hi š t ā t satauua ē s ō ... zraiia ŋ hat haca vouruka ṣ̌ ā t ), but it is considered unproblematic because the sense of ‘a star rising from a sea’ is natural enough. The semantics of the verbal phrase seems to require the ablative complement, although the verb does not really mean ‘rise’ but ‘stand up’. The composer could have used the more straight-forward us + ξ ar ‘rise up’ ( AW , col. 183) to convey the supposed meaning, but the peculiar nature of the locution ‘standing up from the sea’ does not undermine the phrase. 32 Thus the fact that a particular usage is attested only once in a small corpus does not by itself make it questionable, even where, as in this example, a verb that is more ‘naturally’ suited to a complement in the ablative is available. In any case, as far as the grammar is concerned, the two YAv. passages (FrW 10.40 and Yt 13.87) cited above prove that a concrete subject can in fact have a purely ablative predicate. 33 There can thus be no formal objection to the reading (concrete subject + ξ ah ‘be’ + the ablative complement) proposed here. The ablative case is commonly used to express provenance from a source, physical or mental. Y 32.3a–b is an aetiology of the downfall of the da ē vas , well understood by the Mazdaean tradition, just as Y 32.3b′–c′ is a statement about where they end up. In the ancient thought, Greek no less than Iranian or Indian, an account of the origin (‘myth’ or, in the post-archaic Greece, ‘physics’) of a phenomenon explains its manner of existence. 34 The phrase ‘the da ē vas are from bad thought’ means that their way of existence is occasioned or caused by bad thought. If this is the meaning the poet wants to convey; if, in other words, the poet is making known the ‘truth’ about the da ē vas , the ground of their manner of being, his expression is quite understandable. The da ē vas ’ very being is grounded in bad thought. Now, we have a positive evi-dence for this determination of the da ē vas by bad thought: Y 30.6b′ v ə r ə n ā t ā aci š t ə m man ō ‘(the da ē vas ) choose the worst thinking’ and Y 32.5bb′ hiiat v å ak ā mana ŋ h ā y ə̄ n \u000f g da ē uu ə̄ n \u000f g akasc ā mainiiu š ‘as bad intuition (has made) you into the da ē vas that (you are), thanks to (or: by means of) bad thought’. Thus the meaning of Y 32.3a–b is something like: ‘but you all, the da ē vas and the great one who worships you, are clearly grounded in bad thinking’. One can read Y 32.3b′ drujasc ā pairimat ō i š c ā either in the ablative with ak ā t mana ŋ h ō or in the genitive determining š\u000b iiaom ą m ‘actions’. The former has nothing in its favour. Insler ( 1975 , p. 45) and Kellens and Pirart ( 1988 , p. 119) read it in this way without any justifi cation. 35 The ‘actions of negli-gence’ ( pairimat ō i š o š\u000b iiaom ą m ), on the other hand, may be contrasted with Y 51.21aa′ ā rmat ō i š ... š\u000b iiao θ an ā ‘by means of action inspired by (divine) attune-ment’, which characterizes the ‘vitalizing man’ ( nar- sp ə n \u000f ta- ). 36 According to Y 43.2–3, the action of the vitalizing man consists in ‘teaching’ the mortals about the straight paths of ‘vitalization of both this corporeal life and the spiritual one’. I have argued elsewhere that the ‘vitalization of existence’"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"The daēva cult 159is an eschatological phenomenon. The image given of the ‘living creatures possessed of vitality’ in Yt 19.11–12 is, in my mind, a G ā thic one: Yt 19.12 bun ga ē θ å amar š\u000b an \u000f t ī š y å a ṣ̌ ahe × sauua ŋ v hait ī š ni š .tat paiti drux š n ā š aite ya δ at ai β icit ja γ mat a ṣ̌ auuan ə m mahrka θ ā i aom ci θ r ə mca st ī mca... ‘The living crea-tures of a ṣ̌ a will become immortal, possessed of vitality. Druj will be banished to the very place whence he had come with the purpose of making mortal the a ṣ̌ avan , him, (his) apparition and (his) being’. Druj personifi es the forces of death, disorder and deceit, and brings, in the G ā th ā s, destruction to the liv-ing creatures of a ṣ̌ a : Y 31.1bb′ y ō i uruu ā t ā i š druj ō a ṣ̌ ahii ā ga ē θ å v ī m ə r ə n \u000f cait ē ‘(those) who by means of the stipulations of druj destroy the living creatures of a ṣ̌ a ’. Both genitives must be subjective. The followers of druj , end up as ‘guests in the House of druj ’ (Y 49.11), that is to say, condemned to ‘lasting darkness and foul food’ (Y 31.20). The turn away from a ṣ̌ a and toward druj (Y 32.12) leads ‘in the end’ to the House of druj (Y 51.13–14). Opposed to the ‘actions of druj ’ are the ‘true actions’ (Y 30.5) with which the a ṣ̌ avans (those ‘who choose a ṣ̌ a ’) ensure for themselves the best mental state (Y 30.4–5), i.e. a blissful afterlife. Whatever other dimensions the opposition of a ṣ̌ a and druj may have in the G ā th ā s, and more generally in Iranian religious thought, the eschatological one is an important one, and, in the G ā th ā s, it seems to be the basic preoccupation. Kellens ( 1995 , pp. 32–38) has written important pages about the eschatological valence of ‘being an a ṣ̌ avan ’ in the Avesta, which he terms ‘l’artavanit é ’. Just as following druj in this life condemns the soul to a tormenting existence in the ‘House of druj ’ beyond death, so, in diametrical opposition to it, ‘artavanity’ (perhaps one may call it the ‘state of sanctity’) gives the soul access to the ‘sun-drenched (abode of) a ṣ̌ a ’. 37 It is in this context that we must understand drujasc ā pairimat ō i š c ā š\u000b iiaom ą m ‘actions inspired by druj and negligence’. These are the actions that, among others, lead ‘in the end’ to the House of druj and make one estranged from the divine and from the blissful destiny that ā rmaiti- ‘attunement’ makes possible for the soul. Bartholomae ( AW , col. 761), Lommel ( 1971 , p. 60) and Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 132) read š\u000b iiaom ą m in the nominative and aip ī as an adverb ‘like-wise’: respectively, ‘desgleichen auch die (eure) Taten, durch die ihr schon lang bekannt seid auf dem siebenten Kreis der Erde’; ‘auch eure Taten, durch die ihr bekannt wurdet in dem Siebentel der Erde, sind gegens ä tzlich (gegen eure Worte der Ergebenheit)’; and ‘as well as the activities of deceit and con-tempt, for which you again and again have become notorious in (this) sev-enth (of the seven climes) of the world’. They all depend on a problematic interpretation of aip ī ( AW , 82–83). The only meaning that is certain for this term in the Avesta, whether as a preposition or verbal prefi x, is ‘onto’ or ‘at’, always implying a relation of contiguity with the object of the verb, which can be in either the accusative or locative. The adverbial uses Bartholomae lists are highly controversial, to say the least. It is probably used as an adverb of time (‘henceforth’) in Y 29.4. 38 Its two occurrences following p ə r ə θ u in Yt 8.40 and Y 10.44 ( p ə r ə θ u aipi ) are hard to interpret. Pirart ( 2006a , 92, p. 120) seems to read p ə r ə θ u once in the locative (Yt 8.40: ‘se distribuent en de larges"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"160 The daēva cultrivi è res’) and once in the instrumental (Yt 10.44: ‘arros é e d’une large rivi è re’). Gershevitch ( 1959 , pp. 197–99) believes the usage is similar to OP dū raiy api ‘afar’ and translates p ə r ə θ u aipi ‘abroad’. But OP dū raiy is in the locative, which shows the attraction of the preposition for this case in Iranian. 39 In any event, there is no clear evidence for an adverbial use of aip ī meaning some-thing like ‘auch’ or ‘desgleichen auch’, as opposed to Vedic, where it is preva-lent (cf. EWA , vol. 1, p. 86). Kellens and Pirart ( 1991 , 83) interpret š\u000b iiaom ą m as a locative: ‘la seule fa ç on de rendre compte sans diffi cult é de aip ī consiste à en faire la pr é verbe de ah , dont la forme personnelle, sousentendue, persiste depuis a... D è s lors, š\u000b iiaom ą m doit ê tre consid é r é comme le loc. sing. r é gi, selon un usage courant, par aip ī +ah “collaborer à loc.”’. The two occurrences of aip ī in Y 30.11 and 32.8 with a locative are important but cannot prejudge the case in 32.3. 40 In any event, in Y 30.11 c′ at aip ī t ā i š a ŋ hait ī u š t ā ‘then, (by abiding) with these (rules), things will be according to (your) wish’, and probably in Y 32.8cc′ a ē šą mc ī t ā ahm ī θβ ahm ī mazd ā v ī ci θ ō i aip ī ‘O Mazd ā , I follow your decision regarding these (wrongs)’, aip ī is a preposition and not a verbal prefi x. If, in fact, in Y 32.3 it is a verbal prefi x ( aip ī + ξ ah ) the kind of contiguity with the complement that the verb should convey must have the sense of ‘ending up at’ since a virtual career is being described: the manner of being that originates in bad thought ends up in actions of druj and negligence, hence the accusative signifying the endpoint of a displacement. 41 Moreover, š\u000b iiaom ą m has the regular G ā thic nom. acc. pl. form of man stems. 42 The only certain word with -m ą m ending in the locative is Y 46.16 var ə d ə m ą m . Finally, reading š\u000b iiaom ą m as a locative leaves the following relative pronoun y ā i š without an explicit antecedent. The da ē vas and the ‘great one’ who worships them, having taken their bearings from bad thought, end up being involved in actions of druj and negligence, for which they become notorious. Nevertheless, Kellens and Pirart’s proposal to read š\u000b iiaom ą m as a locative is also quite plausible, should aip ī be a preposition. In this case, the antecedent of the relative pronoun y ā i š would have to be a ē nah- (Kellens and Pirart 1991 , p. 83), which anticipates the persistent mention of the word in the section Y 32.6–8. The theme of these four stanzas (Y 32.3 and 32.6–8) is the repudiation of the ‘wrongs’ ( a ē nah- ) for which the perpetrator has become known ( ξ sru ) the world over. If one accepts, as seems reasonable, the lexical and thematic nexus that connects the four stanzas as a basis for reading a ē nah- into Y 32.3cc′ as the antecedent of the relative pronoun, then with all the more reason one should admit that the ‘wrongs’ committed by Yima, according to Y 32.8, have to do with taking part in the da ē va cult, for which, like the ‘great one’ ( maz- ) of Y 32.3, he has become notorious ( ξ sru ). The ‘one with many wrongful acts’ ( × pouruua ē n å 43 ) of Y 32.6 may refer to Yima, who wants to make himself famous with wrongful acts: Y 32.6aa′ × pouruua ē n å ə̄ n ā x š t ā y ā i š sr ā uuahiieit ī yez ī t ā i š a θ ā ‘(wrongs) by which the one with many wrongful acts becomes famous, if thus (acquired it is deserved)’, etc. Y 32.8bb′ seems to state some-thing specifi c about the ‘wrongs’ with which Yima is charged.

The last three words are semantically ambiguous. g ā u š must be a fi nite verb, and not, e.g. the genitive of gao- ‘cow’, or else a fi nite verb has to be provided for the relative clause. Humbach’s translation is not only abstruse as to its sense, but also syntactically questionable, for he reads cix š nu š a- as the fi nite verb of the clause without further ado: ‘the ox, who tried to satisfy the mortals, our (people), in swearing by God’ ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 133). But Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 2, p. 82) also suggests that the word may be from an s-aorist stem of gu/gau meaning ‘fail’ or ‘commit a sin’ (cf. Hintze 1994 , p. 88 n. 56: ‘s ü n-digen, fehlen’). x v ā r ə mna- may be from ξ x v ar ‘eat’ ( AW , col. 1865; perhaps more generally ‘take’, see Bailey 1971 , pp. xxvi–xxvii) or from ξ x v ar ‘be fi t-ting’ (attested in Persian among others, see Bailey 1971 , p. xxviii), 44 depending on which baga- could be either ‘(sacrifi cial) share’ or ‘god’. If the latter is the correct interpretation, what could the participial phrase bag ā x v ā r ə mn ō mean? Is it a question of self-apotheosis: ‘(Yima) who wishing to satisfy the mortals (i.e. worshippers of the da ē vas ), having placed himself in the position of a god, failed our (people)’? In the various legends of Yima we fi nd direct and indirect support for such a view of his fateful sin. 45 The G ā thic daibit ā n ā is a troublesome term that occurs only twice in similar contexts. In both of its occurrences it seems to be an adverb. Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 2, p. 78) analyses it into the adverb daibit ā (Ved. dvit ā ) plus the particle -n ā , and believes it means ‘again and again’. Mayrhofer ( EWA , vol. 1, p. 767) translates dvit ā \u000b ‘nach wie vor, jetzt wie fr ü her, jetzt wie immer, ein witeres Mal’. Kellens and Pirart ( 1990 , p. 263) rightly point out that this meaning does not seem appropriate for daibit ā in Y 49.2, where ‘the context’, accord-ing to them, suggests ‘ à double titre’. The G ā thic adjective daibitiia- certainly means ‘the second’ just as YAv. bitya- , OP duvit ī ya- and Vedic dv ī tya- . 46 Like its Old Persian counterpart, 47 the G ā thic adverb daibit ā should be translated ‘in two (ways)’ or ‘twofold’: Y 49.2 t ka ē š ō dr ə guu å daibit ā a ṣ̌ ā t r ā r əš ō ‘the drugvan \u000f t teacher abandons a ṣ̌ a in two ways’. Humbach’s transla-tion of the adverb as ‘again and again’ is arbitrary and ill suits the context. The two ways that the drugvan \u000f t teacher abandons a ṣ̌ a are stated in the aorist, i.e. presented as ‘facts’: Y 49.2c–d′ n ō it sp ə n \u000f t ą m d ō r əš t ahm ā i st ō i ā rmait ī m / na ē d ā vohū mazd ā fra š t ā mana ŋ h ā ‘He neither embraces the vitalizing A \u0007 rmaiti to be his, nor consults with Good Thinking, O Mazd ā ’. 48 If so, daibit ā n ā can-not be an adverb of time, ‘vor langem’ ( AW , col. 761), and does not mean ‘again and again’ (Humbach 1991 , vol. 1, p. 132); nor does it imply duplicity as in ‘gegens ä tzlich’ (Lommel 1971 , p. 60) or facing two fronts as in ‘ à double port é ’ (Kellens 1994a , p. 83). 49 As to its form, daibit ā n ā can be analysed in two ways. The suffi x na can make adjectives from adverbs in Indo-Iranian, as in the Sanskrit pur ā n \u000f á ‘ancient’ or sam ā n á ‘like’. The adjective *daibit ā na- must then mean ‘the two’: nom. acc. voc. dual *daibit ā n ā ‘the two’. In this form, it could have then developed an adverbial nuance, perhaps when used by itself (i.e. elliptically) referring to sig-nifi cantly coupled entities, eventually becoming an adverb, in the same form, meaning something like ‘together’.

A ṣ̌ a is clearly the motivation here (and elsewhere) for prevailing over druj . Kellens and Pirart’s reason ( 1991 , p. 221: ‘l’accumulation des instrumentaux nous paraissait suspecte’) for reading a ṣ̌ ā .druj ə m ‘le trompeur de l’Harmonie’ is not cogent. The subject of both subjunctive verbs is A \u0007 rmaiti. Insler’s impersonal ‘one’ ( 1975 , p. 91) is not the best option in view of the textual evidence. I just cited Y 49.2, where it is said that one of the two reasons the follower of druj falls away from the path of a ṣ̌ a is his failure to turn to A \u0007 rmaiti. But we have plain evidence in Y 49.4 and Y 51.21 for the interpretation proposed here. In the former, du š .xra θβ ā ‘the imbeciles’, who ‘increase a ē šə ma and bondage’, are said to ‘make of the vision-soul of the drugvan \u000f t (the way) to the da ē vas ’ (49.4dd′ t ō i da ē uu ə̄ n \u000f g d ą n y ā dr ə guuat ō da ē n ā ). 50 I n Y 51.13, the ‘negligent’ da ē n ā is instrumental in making the follower of druj ‘disappear’ from the ‘path of a ṣ̌ a ’.

In fact, this stanza must be considered a conceptual expos é of ā rmaiti- ‘attunement’. In my mind, the two concluding stanzas of Y 48 leave no doubt as to the identity of the subject of 48.1: 48.11a–b′ kad ā mazd ā a ṣ̌ ā mat ā rmaiti š jimat x š a θ r ā hu šə iti š v ā strauuait ī ‘when will A \u0007 ramiti come along with a ṣ̌ a , thanks to (your?) power, O Mazd ā , (A \u0007 rmaiti) who provides a choice place of residence and pasturage?’"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"The daēva cult 163 The relative phrase Y 48.1b is admittedly diffi cult to decipher because the form and meaning of ą sa š ut ā are unclear. In view of the excessive syllable of the p ā da the a between the two sibilants may be taken as a glide and metrically null. 52 This would give us * ą s š ut ā , which can be analysed into ą s + š ut ā , the fi rst as the root of an \u000f gra- ‘hostile, noxious’ ( AW , col. 104), also attested in the G ā th ā s in ą sta- ‘misfortune, harm’, and the second as the action noun * š\u000b uiti- from ξ š\u000b (ii)u ‘set in motion’ ( AW , col. 1714: ‘sich in Bewegung setzen’) in the locative (see Insler 1975 , p. 285), or as the n. pl. of the past participle * š\u000b uta- . Schwartz ( 2006 , p. 481) chooses the latter option and substantivizes * š\u000b ut ā as ‘things enacted’ and translates the compound * ą s š ut ā as ‘the enactments of malice’. 53 Lommel ( 1971 , p. 153) reads instead * ą s š ut ā as the third sing. medio-passive of ξ nas ‘attain’, which he seems to think is from an is \u000f -aorist stem. He translates Y 48.1b–c′: so da ß was zweifach f ü r die Unsterblichkeit vorausges-agt ist, von G ö ttern und Menschen erlangt wurde’, subordinated to Y 48.1aa′ by hiiat . The problem is that he takes ad ā i š (‘mittels der Vergeltungen’) as the inst. pl. of ad ā - . Narten ( 1986 , pp. 104ff.) has shown that ad ā i š should be read ad- ā i š , where the fi rst is the sandhi form of at . The syntactic structure of the stanza is as follows. Y 48.1a–c′ ( yez ī ...) and 48.1dd′ ( at ...) are related to each other as protasis and apodosis, both in the subjunctive aorist: ‘when X will have occurred, then Y will happen’. Y 48.1a–c′ itself consists of a main clause, Y 48.1aa′ and two subordinated relatives, Y 48.1 b and Y 48.1b′–c′. hiiat , a causal adverb, subordinates Y 48.1b as the explanation of the treat-ment of the ‘utterances (of the gods and mortals)’ in Y 48.1aa′, signalled by ad o . The meaning of * ą s š ut ā tells us in what sense we should understand the instrumental o ā i š , whether positively, ‘by these’, or negatively, ‘despite these’. Y 48.1b′–c′ is subordinated by means of the attributive relative y ā referring to o ā i š : ‘these (words) that are uttered in pursuit of immortality’, etc. As I men-tioned, * ą s š ut ā can be either a nominative or a locative, telling us the sense in which the instrumental o ā i š should be understood. If the word is a locative, Y 48.1b would mean something like: ‘since (those words are uttered with the intention of) mobilizing harm’, the locative being that of the mindset. 54 If * ą s š ut ā is a nominative, it must be a descriptive adjective, and the sense of the p ā da is: ‘since (those words are) harm-mobilizing, i.e. potent in their harm’. In either case, it is clear that the ‘words’ are understood as an obstacle. They are potent forces for druj . I prefer the nominative reading because it is more straightforward. The instrumental sauu ā i š can be understood in three ways: extension of time (Insler 1975 , 48), motivation for action (Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 168), and the instrumental of means (Lommel 1971 , p. 149; and Humbach 1991 , vol. 1, p. 176). There are two neuter nouns in the G ā th ā s from ξ sū ‘vitalize’: sauua- and sauuah- . Kellens and Pirart ( 1990 , p. 313) suspect they constitute a heteroclitic paradigm. This does not seem right to me. Scholars have generally translated these two words as if they were synonymous. 55 Their usage, how-ever, indicates otherwise. sauuah- seems to be consistently used in an abstract, even close to a verbal, sense. 56 Thus, for example, in Y 34.3 hud åŋ h ō sauu ō"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"164 The daēva cult‘vitalization of the benevolent’, the genitive is objective; and in 43.3 y ə̄ n å ə r ə zū š sauua ŋ h ō pa θ ō s ī š ō it ahii ā a ŋ h ə̄ u š astuuat ō mana ŋ hasc ā ‘who may teach us the straight paths of vitalization of this corporeal existence and (the one) of the mind’, sauuah- has a verbal force. 57 By contrast, sauua- has a concrete sense, something like ‘vital energy’, which the gods make available to mortals.

Thus in Y 44.12 the drugvan \u000f t (perhaps the drugvan \u000f t , i.e. an \u000f gra- mainiiu- ?) is said to want ‘to interpose himself between me and the vital energies that you provide’ ( y ə̄ m ā dr ə guu å θβ ā sauu ā pait ī . ə r ə t ē ), which makes him ‘noxious’ or ‘hostile’ ( an \u000f gr ō ). 59 The instrumental sauu ā i š in Y 51.15 expresses the motivation for the allocation (of praise?) made to the gods: t ā v ə̄ vohū mana ŋ h ā a ṣ̌ ā ic ā sauu ā i š ciuu ī šī ‘these are allocated to you through good thinking, and to a ṣ̌ a , for the sake of the vital energies’, i.e. so that you make available to us the vital energies. Thus there can hardly be any doubt in which sense the instrumental sauu ā i š should be understood in Y 48.1dd′: ‘then, O Ahura, she will increase your veneration for the sake of the vital energies’. A coherent picture emerges of what it is to be ‘hostile’ ( an \u000f gra- ) if we com-pare Y 48.1 ą sa š ut ā ‘(words that are) harm-mobilizing’ with Y 44.12 huu ō ... an \u000f gr ō y ə̄ m ā dr ə guu å θβ ā sauu ā pait ī . ə r ə t ē ‘he is hostile, the follower of druj who (is so minded) to interpose himself between me and the vital energies you provide’ on the one hand, and on the other, with Y 32.3 drujas o ... š\u000b iiaom ą m ‘the actions of druj ’ perpetrated by the da ē vas and the ‘great one’. Apparently, the mortals require the ‘vital energies’ if their souls are to reach the divine sphere (Y 45.7). Now, the hostile follower of druj prevents these vital energies from reaching the desirous. A \u0007 ramiti is to eliminate this threat, overcome druj for the sake of a ṣ̌ a , in the face of the harm-mobilizing words of the da ē vas and (their) men. She will then make the veneration of the supreme god thrive so that the vital energies make their way to the mortals.

One of the meanings Bartholomae ( AW , col. 1165–66) gives for the present stem m ī m- with the verbal prefi x fr ā is ‘als Norm aufstellen’. This seems to be the exact sense that the subjunctive verb has in this stanza. Neither Gershevitch’s ‘you have ordered’ ( 1975 , p. 79) nor Kellens and Pirart’s ‘vous permettez’ ( 1988 , p. 119) seems quite right. The da ē vas ‘establish the measure’ for actions that aim at a certain purpose. One has to keep this in mind. The specifi c sense in which the words are to be understood cannot be separated from the context, not just that of the stanza but also that of the issue. The ‘purpose’ for which the da ē vas pretend to give the measure, as we have already seen and will see again, stated explicitly in the next stanza, is ‘good life and immortality’. We must be wary of making the censured ‘actions’ into an empty vessel that the scholar may fi ll with his or her own moral sentiments. The adjective aci š t ā ‘worst’ has been interpreted as describing the ‘men’ (so Gershevitch 1975 , p. 79; and Insler 1975 , p. 45) or substantivized as the direct object of dan \u000f t ō (so Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 119: ‘de tr è s mauvais dons’). Lommel ( 1971 , p. 60) and Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 132) rightly read it as quali-fying the (elliptical) ‘actions’ from the previous stanza, referred to in this stanza with o t ā . Despite the common view, however, dan \u000f t ō cannot refer to the actions of the men; rather, it describes the establishment by the da ē vas of the models for the men’s actions. Lommel ( 1971 , p. 60) translates Y 30.4aa′: ‘Indem ihr das befehlt, was ganz schlecht ist, so da ß die Menschen, die es tun’; Gershevitch ( 1975 , p. 79): ‘Through-the-fact-that you have ordered these (deeds, by) doing which the worst men’; Insler ( 1975 , p. 45): ‘Insofar as ye authorize these actions, which the worst mortals (then) serve’; Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 132): ‘insofar as you order those worst (things), (by) offer-ing which the mortals’; Kellens and Pirart ( 1988 , p. 119): ‘Aussi longtemps que vous permettez les (torts) que les (mauvais) hommes... apr è s avoir fait"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"166 The daēva cultde tr è s mauvais dons’. The participle dan \u000f t- is from ξ d ā ‘set or give’. The verb does not have the sense of committing an action, contra Lommel and Gershevitch. Also it does not mean, despite Insler, ‘attend to’ or ‘serve’, which is rather ξ v ī d ( AW , vol. 1320 ‘dienend ehren’; see Hoffmann and Forssman 2004 , pp. 220–22) with the object in the dative (see Kellens and Pirart 1990 , p. 305). The participle is formed from an aorist stem (cf. Beekes 1988 , p. 193; Hoffmann and Forssman 2004 , p. 226) expressing an accomplished action, a ‘fact’; here it represents the background of the actions in the present. Thus ‘doing’, ‘offering’, ‘then serve’ are untenable. Kellens and Pirart ( 1990 , pp. 75–77) maintain that the aorist conveys a relation of anteriority in such a structure. In their scheme the sense of the verse would become something like: the da ē vas , having received ‘the worst (ritual) gift’ from their worship-pers, who have thus endeared themselves to them, allow these men to commit wrongful things. In my mind, this view is not right, although it is true that the ‘actions’ in question here refer to rites. Their interpretation is based on their theory of the fault of the da ē vas , i.e. the indiscriminate acceptance of ritual offerings. 60 The verb ξ m ā does not mean ‘permit’ or ‘allow’ but to ‘measure, measure out, establish measure’, and at a pinch, ‘order’. Once one restores the right meaning of the verb, the participial ‘(after) having made very bad gifts’ becomes senseless: one would be at a loss to explain its relevance. The sense of the stanza, once again, is not that the da ē vas are coaxed into permit-ting their worshippers to do wrongful things. It is not the mortals who cajole the gods, but, according to Y 32.5, the other way around. As I mentioned above, the adjective aci š t ā belongs with the elliptical ‘actions’ (cf. Y 30.5), and not with the imagined ‘gifts’. Thus dan \u000f t ō must be vocative rather than nominative. The subjunctive aorist vax šə n \u000f t ē is diffi cult to interpret. The subjunct-ive mode of fram ī ma θ ā is dictated by the conjunctive structure y ā t yū š t ā fram ī ma θ ā ... (Y 32.5) t ā d ə b ə naot ā ... ‘As long as you authorize these... (Y 32.5) You deceive...’. This structure seems to have attracted the fi nite verb in the relative clause. If so, the mode of vax šə n \u000f t ē has no signifi cance. Also, the fact that for ξ vax š ‘grow’ the aorist vs. present opposition coincides with the tran-sitive vs. intransitive opposition makes it hard to decide, if no other indicator is forthcoming, whether the use of the aorist is not simply a by-product of the requirement for a transitive verb. Lommel ( 1971 , p. 60), Gershevitch ( 1975 , p. 79), Insler ( 1975 , p. 45) and Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 132) read vax šə n \u000f t ē as an intransitive verb, presumably based on its voice. Except for Insler, these scholars translate Y 32.4b as something like: the mortals increasingly endear themselves to the da ē vas . 61 Insler understands the p ā da to mean that the num-ber of the followers of the da ē vas increases, perhaps because the actions that the latter authorize are popular. Accepting the sense of ‘growing endearment to the da ē vas ’ for the verbal phrase vax šə n \u000f t ē da ē uu ō .zu š t ā , one may trans-late Y 32.4a–b: ‘insofar as, having established (them), you authorize these worst (actions), with which the mortals may grow (in being) da ē va -endeared’. However, aside from the fact that the aorist seems to be used exclusively as a"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"The daēva cult 167transitive verb, there are two serious problems with this interpretation. First, one expects the complement da ē uu ō .zu š ta- to be in the accusative (i.e. the sub-ject grows in relation to or in respect of the complement), as seems to be the case in Y 33.10, and not in the nominative, which would be merely an adjec-tive of the subject. Second, in the face of the existence of a present stem, one cannot see why an aorist (whether perfective, punctual, momentaneous, gno-mic, etc.) is used to express an inherently durative process, even if this is not, strictly speaking, a question of aspect but the objective nature of the action denoted by the verb. 62 Insler separates this stanza from the following one and subordinates Y 32.4aa′ to 4b: ‘Insofar as ye authorize these actions, which the worst mortals (then) serve, those agreeable to (you) the gods shall increase’. The present participle cannot function as a fi nite verb; it describes, like a rela-tive clause, the subject’s condition, which accompanies or is a background to the action expressed in the fi nite verb. Thus y ā ma ṣ̌ ii ā aci š t ā dan \u000f t ō cannot mean ‘which the worst mortals (then) serve’. Aside from this, the translated text has no determinable sense. Ostensibly it means something like: the gods’ authorization of the ‘actions’ occasions the increase in the number of their followers (why the future tense?). But if so, the ‘actions’ cannot be all that bad, neither for the mortals, who obviously fi nd some form of satisfaction in them, nor for the gods, whose devotees and hence offerings swell. The ‘actions’ are described in the previous stanza (in Insler’s translation) as ‘hateful’, for which the gods are known the world over. Everything said about the gods and the actions they authorize is negative in Y 32.3–5. Against this background, what is the sense of the utterance : ‘insofar as ye authorize these actions... those agreeable to (you) the gods shall increase’? Are the gods meant to understand this as a rebuke? Kellens and Pirart translate the middle-voice vax šə n \u000f t ē as a transitive verb ( 1988 , p. 119: ‘les (torts) que les (mauvais) hommes... accroissent à leur b é n é- fi ce’). The middle voice indicates the refl exive nature of the action, which they represent as ‘for their own benefi t’. But this is ambiguous. Given the negative portrayal of the character of the da ē vas and the actions they institute, the meaning of the fi nite verb vax šə n \u000f t ē can be either that the men befriended by the da ē vas reap the benefi ts of the condemned actions, whatever they might be, against the interest of (righteous) others, and hence, this being understood, the discourse preserves its negative tenor; or that the ‘rewards’ themselves are negative even for the recipient. The former interpretation has G ā thic evi-dence: Y 34.8, 46.1–2, 47.4, 49.1. Nonetheless, I think the latter understand-ing is the right one. This means that vax šə n \u000f t ē has a negative signifi cance, or more accurately, a neutral value: the nature of the reward is determined by the nature of the action. A neutral sense for the verb is attested in Y 44.3dd′ k ə̄ y ā m å ux š iieit ī n ə r ə fsait ī θβ ā t ‘who is the one by which the moon now waxes (now) wanes?’ In Y 32.5aa′, that is to say, in the main clause to which Y 32.4 is subordinated, the ‘gods’ are accused of cheating the mortals out of ‘good life and immortality’. Firstly, there is no basis to think that the ‘mortal’ in Y 32.5 constitutes a different category from the ‘mortals’ in Y 32.4, who are"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"168 The daēva cult‘befriended by the gods’. Y 32.5aa′ states the outcome of their engaging in the ‘worst actions’ instituted by the da ē vas : loss of good life and immortality. This is the ‘benefi t’ they reap. Secondly, the conjunctive structure makes the direct sequencing of Y 32.4a–b and Y 32.5aa′ ineluctable, for the conjunctive par-ticle *t ā d opening Y 32.5 has to refer to the situation described in Y 32.4a–b, and not to 32.4b′–c′, which elaborates further that situation. 63 In other words, Y 32.5aa′ is the direct outcome of the situation described in Y 32.4a–b, iron-ically expressed in vax šə n \u000f t ē ‘will have grown on their own account’. The aorist verb should then be understood in a terminative sense: what the gods estab-lish and measure out, their mortal followers bring to fruition to their own det-riment. The outcome also reveals what is meant by the ‘worst actions’: actions that undermine the desirable existence, earthly and beyond. The sense of the participial phrase mazd å ahurahii ā xrat ə̄ u š nasiian \u000f t ō is obscure. Gershevitch’s translation of xratu- as ‘commandment’ is ad hoc . 64 Other scholars have translated the word with ‘intelligence’ (Kellens and Pirart), ‘intellect’ (Humbach), ‘will’ (Lommel and Insler), ‘Geisteskraft’ (Hoffmann and Forssman 2004 , p. 294). Bartholomae ( AW , col. 535) gives two series of meanings: ‘Wille, Absicht, Plan, Ratschluss’ and ‘Gesiteskraft, Einsicht, Verstand, Ged ä chtniskraft, Weisheit’; and places the Y 32.4 occurrence under the former category. Mayrhofer ( EWA , vol. 1, p. 407) gives ‘Geisteskraft, Willenskraft’. Its verbal root is unclear (see Wackernagel and Debrunner 1954 , p. 474). In the Middle Persian xrad means reason or wisdom. It is signifi cant that, although it is an important concept in the G ā th ā s, xratu- is absent from the YH. In the G ā th ā s it is positively marked. In Y 48.10, karapans and the ‘malevolent power holders in the nations’, using an intoxicating liquor, sicken men with malice and ‘effi caciously’ (inst. xratū ). But here it is used ironically. 65 The genitive in Y 48.3 va ŋ h ə̄ u š xra θβ ā mana ŋ h ō ‘by the resourcefulness of good thinking’ is subjective. Y 34.14 x š m ā k ą m hucist ī m... xrat ə̄ u š probably means ‘the availing insight of your resourcefulness’, i.e. the genitive is subject-ive, and not objective as Insler ( 1975 , p. 59) has: ‘the good understanding of your will’. The occurrence of xratu- in Y 48.4 is instructive.

(His da ē n ā ) follows his inclinations, wishes and choices’. 66 The ‘vision-soul’ or da ē n ā being the way to the divine sphere, it should matter to the mortal how it is shaped, whether it is ‘good’ or ‘bad’. And the poet clearly wishes to impress on his audience that this (i.e. whether it is good or bad) depends on the quality of one’s thought, word and action, the doctrinal triad. Insler’s translation ( 1975 , p. 91) of Y 48.4dd′ more or less captures the sense"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"The daēva cult 169of the Avestan text, although his understanding of xratu- is not correct, in my mind: ‘(But) when Thy will shall be done, the end shall be different (for each)’. 67 Humbach’s translation does not make much sense ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 177): ‘Finally, he will be (recorded) in Thy intellect here and there’; neither does Kellens and Pirart’s ( 1988 , p. 169): ‘Du point de vue de ton intelligence, la fi n sera diverse!’ Y 48.4d′ means something like ‘in the end (things) will be in different ways’, being understood that it is one’s fate that is at issue, and that the outcome will be individually determined according to how one has shaped one’s da ē n ā . Mayrhofer ( EWA , vol. 2, p. 34) gives for the Vedic cognate ( n ā n ā ) of nan ā ‘auf verschiedene Weise, von verschiedenen Seiten, da und dort, jeder f ü r sich’. Thus the meaning of ap ə̄ m ə m nan ā a ŋ hat is: the outcome will be different for each depending on the shape of one’s da ē n ā . The soul either ends up in the ‘house of welcome’ or the loathsome ‘house of druj ’ (cf. Y 51.14). The admonitions and promises made by the poet (on behalf of Mazd ā ) regarding the afterlife, e.g. how one’s fate depends on the way one shapes one’s da ē n ā , are not made in vain. Mazd ā has the power to make good those promises and admonitions, bring them to conclusion. The locative phrase θβ ahm ī × xrat ā u must thus mean: ‘(the outcomes lying) within your power to bring to pass your designs’. One’s fate being within Mazd ā ’s power of bringing affairs to their appointed ends, e.g. making good the poet’s promises and admonitions, the end will be different for each depending on how one has shaped one’s da ē n ā . The locative phrase states the condition of the verbal phrase in the subjunctive. Conversely, du š .xra θβ ā ‘imbeciles’ in Y 49.4 are those who are incapable of realizing their desired end, or perhaps, as Y 32.4 tells us, are those who deprive themselves of Mazd ā ’s effi cacious power of accomplishing their desire for immortality. 68 Instead, t ō i da ē uu ə̄ n \u000f g d ą n y ā dr ə guuat ō da ē n ā ‘they make of the drugvan \u000f t ’s da ē n ā the way to the da ē vas ’ (Y 49.4dd′), instead of the way to Mazd ā ’s blissful abode. In Y 32.4, the desired end for which one should want Mazd ā ’s resourcefulness is explicitly stated: a ṣ̌ a . Depriving oneself of Mazd ā ’s power is tantamount to nasiian \u000f t ō a ṣ̌ ā at c ā ‘disappearing from (the path of) a ṣ̌ a ’. I have already pointed out that the fi gure of ‘path of a ṣ̌ a ’ may be understood as a metonymic designation of the divine sphere. A ṣ̌ a in Y 43.12aa′ hiiat c ā m ō i mrao š a ṣ̌ə m jas ō fr ā x š n ə n ē must refer to something concrete, as the locative or accusative complement of √ gam ‘come’, whether simplex or with the verbal prefi x ā or aib ī , has a concrete sense in the G ā th ā s when the subject is a person. A translation, therefore, such as that of Lommel ( 1971 , p. 99): ‘Zum Wahrsein gehe’; of Insler ( 1975 , p. 65): ‘Thou hast come to the truth in thy discernment’; or of Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 155): ‘With foresight thou reachest truth’, aside from the problem of sense, would be anomalous as far as the semantics of the particular usage of the verb is concerned.

Y 32.5 is the core of the G ā thic doctrine, not just of the da ē vas but, e contrario , also of the divine. The relative phrase Y 32.5c′ is diffi cult to decipher. Scholars generally read x š aii ō as a nom. sing. of x š aiia- ‘ruler’ (according to Insler 1975 , p. 45; Kellens 1984a , p. 65; and Humbach 1991 , vol. 2, p. 80) or ‘expert’ (so Gershevitch 1975 , p. 79), but do not give any analysis of its form. As Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 2, p. 80) remarks, it seems to be attested in Yt 13.18 h ō a ŋ h ā iti zazu š t ə m ō x š aii ō ‘he will become the most victorious ruler’, where one would expect, were it the present participle, x š aii ą instead (cf. de Vaan 2003 , p. 390–91). The regular G ā thic form of the latter is x š aii ą s . One may justify the existence of x š aiia- ‘ruler’ next to the regular G ā thic x š aiian \u000f t- by the fact that the present participle cannot be the subject of a fi nite verb (or the antecedent of a relative pronoun) on its own. So, in effect, x š aiian \u000f t- could not mean the ‘ruler’. Nonetheless, the nominative reading of the form is problematic. The usual translation of Y 32.5c′ is ‘by reason of which a ruler (or the Ruler) recognizes (or marks or identifi es) a deceitful person’, where the relative pronoun y ā ‘by which’ refers to aka- vacah- ‘bad word’. The verb √ cit means ‘to recognize’ e.g. the complement in the accusative. Its Vedic cognate √ cet ‘recognize, note’ has both cognitive (‘observe’) and intersubjective (‘acknowledge’) senses (see EWA , vol. 1, pp. 547–48). In the G ā th ā s, however, √ cit has the former sense only in Y 51.5, where it is qualifi ed by the adverb ə r əš ‘rightly’: y ə̄ d ā θ a ē ibii ō ə r əš ratū m x š aii ą s a ṣ̌ iuu å cist ā ‘(resourceful pastor), the holder of reward, who, having disposition over (life), correctly recognizes the measure for those who abide by the law’. In all other occurrences in the G ā th ā s the verb means ‘to acknowledge’. In the middle voice and without a direct object, it has a refl exive sense, i.e. ‘get oneself acknowledged as the nom. or for the dat.’: Y 51.11cc′ k ə̄ v ā va ŋ h ə̄ u š mana ŋ h ō acist ā mag ā i ə r əš uu ō ‘which upright one has got himself recognized for the gift due to good thinking?’ and 32.11a′b y ō i dr ə guuan \u000f t ō mazb ī š cik ō it ə r əš a ŋ v h ī š c ā a ŋ hauuasc ā ‘the masters and mistresses who have got themselves recognized as followers of druj by their great (wrongs)’, i.e. are known for being the followers of druj , etc. When the verb has an accusative complement, it means ‘acknowledge the acc.

Thus, if x š aii ō is a nominative term, Y 32.5c′ should mean something like ‘(the bad speech) by means of which the ruler acknowledges the follower of druj (as the facilitator of immortality?)’ or ‘by means of which the ruler acknowledges (= appoints)"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"The daēva cult 171the follower of druj ’. In any case, the usual translation of the relative phrase, which takes fra + √ cit to mean ‘identify’, should be ruled out. One can analyse Y 32.5c′ differently. x š aii ō may be taken as an infi nitive of the present stem x š aiia- ‘have disposition over’ in ah . v ə r ə zii ō from Y 30.5 and d ā raii ō from 32.1 are certainly infi nitives; sauuaii ō from Y 51.9 and auu ō from 32.14 may also be (cf. Hoffmann and Forssman 2004 , p. 242). If x š aii ō is an infi nitive governed by fra + cinat- , the subject of the verb would have to be either aka- mainiiu- or, more likely, š\u000b iiao θ ana- , and the relative pronoun probably refers to aka- vacah- : ‘(the bad speech) with which the action of druj (or the bad intuition) appoints a follower of druj to exercise power’. Now, it is true that the next three stanzas (Y 32.6–8) are about Yima; and given that he is the archetypal magico-religious ‘ruler’ in Iranian myth-ology, 69 one would be tempted to make this p ā da into a short (tendentious) notice about the source of Yima’s ‘power’, who is described as × pouruua ē n å ‘possessed of many wrongs’ in the following stanza. 70 The relative phrase does not relate a mythical episode but states a general fact about the ‘bad word’, the power of the ‘bad word’: it is used by the ‘bad action’ (i.e. bad rite) to appoint a follower of druj to ‘rule’. An implied object is inherent in the semantics of ξ x š ā ‘rule, have disposition over’. This raises the question of the object of x š aii ō in Y 32.5. What is it in this passage over which the fol-lower of druj has disposition or perhaps pretends to have disposition? From two other passages, which I will discuss in detail presently, we know that the da ē vas are known to have ‘exercised the power’. It is not a general form of power that is meant here but a special kind of power, namely the power of ‘life’. In Y 44.20 the poet asks Mazd ā : ci θ ə n ā mazd ā hux š a θ r ā da ē uu ā åŋ har ə̄ ‘O Mazd ā , have the da ē vas ever exercised a salutary power?’ We should recall what is said of the ‘utterances’ of the da ē vas and their followers in pursuit of immortality in Y 48.1: they mobilize harm and misfortune. Despite these, it is asserted that A \u0007 rmaiti will prevail over druj and the ‘veneration’ ( vahma- ) of Mazd ā will grow for the sake of the ‘vital energies’ ( sauua- ), which, as I argued, have an eschatological function. In Y 48.4, we saw that the supreme god’s power to bring things to their appointed ends ( θβ ahm ī × xrat ā u ) stands as the guarantee of the effectiveness of the words of the poet regarding the shape of one’s da ē n ā . 71 The good da ē n ā will lead to ‘ a ṣ̌ a possessed of vital-ity’ (51.21 da ē n ā a ṣ̌ə m sp ə̄ nuuat ), while the ‘bad da ē n ā ’, that is to say, the ‘negligent da ē n ā of the follower of druj ’, is bound to ‘make his soul rage in the face of the Collector’s Bridge’ (Y 51.13 yehii ā uruu ā xraodait ī cinuuat ō × p ə r ə t ā u ā k å ). The hope the follower of druj places in the da ē vas (Y 49.4) in pursuit of immortality must be illusory. This dualistic doctrine of the role and fate of the da ē n ā is in the background of Y 48.4. Any doubt as to the eschatological horizon of the issue raised in this stanza would be artifi cial. Now, in the following stanza, Y 48.5, the poet turns to A \u0007 rmaiti (recall Y 48.1): Y 48.5a-b′ hux š a θ r ā x šə̄ n \u000f t ą m m ā n ə̄ du šə .x š a θ r ā x šə̄ n \u000f t ā va ŋ huii å cist ō i š š\u000b iiao θ an ā i š ā rmait ē ‘O A \u0007 ramiti, let those with salutary power exercise the power with actions inspired by good insight, do not let those with nefarious"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"172 The daēva cultpower exercise the power for us!’ The object of ξ x š ā , over which the sub-ject has disposition, if explicitly present, appears in the genitive (Y 31.19, 32.15, 44.15, 48.9, 50.9). These occurrences have two features in common. The verb is in the present, and the object is a specifi c matter, never a per-son. The verbal or participial phrase states that the subject has disposition over the matter in the genitive. Only in the OP inscriptions (e.g. DNa.19: adam š ā m patiyax š aiyaiy ‘I ruled over them’) do we fi nd the present stem in the middle voice and the verbal prefi x pati with the person in the genitive as the object of the exercise of power. It is clear that here political rule is meant: the king has power over a population and a territory. It has the same form and meaning in Yt 19.26, 28, 31: yat x š aiiata paiti bū m ī m haptai θ ii ą m da ē uuan ą m ma ṣ̌ ii ā n ą mca ‘so that he ruled over the da ē vas and men in the (whole of) seven-sectioned land’. In Yt 19.66, too, the implied object of the political power is territory: y ō auua δ ā t frax š aiieit ē ‘who expanded his power from there’. In contrast to other G ā thic passages, the verb in Y 48.5 is in the aorist stem and its indirect object is a person. The context does not allow the interpretation of the verb ξ x š ā in the political sense. Moreover, the fact that the verbs are in the aorist cannot be insignifi cant. The action denoted by the aorist verb is viewed from the outside, ‘reduced to a fact’; the statement in the aorist expresses a wish with regard to a momentous fact rather than any specifi c, unfolding circumstance. This would hardly be an adequate way of stating one’s wishes about an ongoing condition, i.e. political rule. On the other hand, the discursive context leaves scarcely any doubt that the nature of the power at issue is, generally speaking, ‘existential’ in the absolute sense: disposition over existence as such, 72 which perhaps in the present context may be legitimately interpreted as eschatological. The du šə .x š a θ r ā are the da ē vas and the ‘hostile’ ( an \u000f gra- ) mortal followers of druj whose speech mobilizes harm and blocks the vital energies that Mazd ā makes available for the right-eous ( d ā θ a- ) mortals (Y 44.12, 48.1, 51.5), the speech with which the da ē vas and their devotees conspire to prevent the latter from attaining to the divine sphere (Y 32.1). The ‘power’ of their followers only leads to the ‘house of the worst thought’ (Y 32.13). By contrast, the hux š a θ r ā exercise a salutary power of life, and in particular across the threshold of death.

If it is indeed from this root, it can hardly mean ‘block’ as Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 2, p. 161) has it. De Vaan ( 2000 , p. 83) derives the verb from IIr. * √ pik ‘dr ü cken, kneifen’, giving Avestan present stem * pici ̯ a- ‘falsch opfern’ or ‘schlecht behandeln’. Its negative semantics are based in G ā thic rhetoric against the da ē va cult, where the term is used to describe a (characteristic) ritual gesture with a polemical intent. Thus in Y 44.20 the verb means: ‘eine falsche Opferhandlung verrichten’, and in Y 50.2 the participial: ‘die die Sonne kneifen’, where ‘kneifen’ ‘really’ means ‘abkneifen, durch falsches Kneifen mi ß handeln’ (de Vaan 2000 , p. 84). Thus, according to de Vaan’s hypothesis, the verb stigmatizes the da ē va cult by synecdoche. This means that its usage must naturally be limited to two occasions: the original one, where the verb describes in a tendentious way a specifi c ritual gesture; or the generalized one, in which the term refers to the deprecated cult or sacrifi ce in toto , as in de Vaan’s ‘eine falsche Opferhandlung verrichten’. Now, the usage ‘die Sonne kneifen’ is semantically stranded in this scheme. It obviously makes no literal sense. What could the phrase ‘abuse the sun by a false pinch’ mean? It is not even completely clear to me whether in de Vaan’s estimation, in the postulated literal sense, the verb describes a (deprecated) gesture or is used polemically to deprecate a gesture. De Vaan ( 2000 , p. 84) argues that the same term is also found in Yt 14.19 pi š at ō upara.na ē m ā t against Bartholomae ( AW , col. 907), followed by Pirart ( 2006a , p. 166), who derives it from IIr. √ pi š ‘crush’ (Ved. √ pis \u000f ). 74 Since the phrase describes the fl ight of a bird of prey, if the participle should be read as *pi š\u000b iian \u000f t- , it makes better sense in my mind to translate the phrase as ‘fronting from above’, i.e. a bold gesture, rather than ‘pinching from above’. 75 Thus the expression huuar ə̄ pi š iian \u000f t- must mean something like ‘facing the sun’. If the phrase refers to an actual gesture, it could describe a symbolic action of the da ē va cult that is in some sense characteristic or otherwise signifi cant, i.e. refers to a doctrine. In my opinion, the expression is a self-description of the da ē va cult and has an ecstatic and/or eschatological meaning: to reach the heavenly sphere. That ‘facing the sun’ refers to an adversely viewed cult seems to be confi rmed by Y 32.10, where the offi ciating priest is accused of enfeebling the poet’s hymns: Y 32.10a-b huu ō m ā n ā srauu å m ō r ə n \u000f dat , y ə̄ aci š t ə m va ē na ŋ\u000b h ē aog ə d ā / g ą m a š ibii ā huuar ə c ā ‘he enfeebles my utterances, the man who utters the worst things in order to see with his eyes the sun and the cow’. 76 The full (agonistic) context of the usage of the phrase is apparent in Y 50.2a–c′ ka θ ā mazd ā , r ā nii ō .sk ə r ə it ī m g ą m i š as ō it / y ə̄ h ī m ahm ā i, v ā strauuait ī m st ō i usii ā t / ə r əžə ji š a ṣ̌ ā , pouru š ū huuar ə̄ pi š iiasū ‘how may the man living rightly because of a ṣ̌ a among the many who face the sun ask for the joy-giving cow, (the man) who would want her, possessed of pasturage, to be for him?’ The expression ahm ā i... st ō i ‘to be for him’ means ‘to make available to him what he wants’, e.g. ‘joy’. It is almost certain, again, that this ‘joy-giving cow’ is the sacrifi cial animal, which would have been ‘mistreated’ by the kavi along with those ‘who greet the sun’ (cf. Y 32.14)."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"174 The daēva cult The same question is asked in Y 51.5, but here the ‘cow’ is described dif-ferently: Y 51.5 a–b′ v ī sp ā t ā p ə r ə s ą s ya θ ā , a ṣ̌ ā t hac ā g ą m v ī dat / v ā strii ō š\u000b iiao θ an ā i š ə r əš uu ō , h ą s huxratu š n ə ma ŋ h ā ‘asking all these (and also:) how the pastoralist, being elevated in his actions and effi cacious in his worship, acquires the a ṣ̌ a -bound cow’. The phrase a ṣ̌ ā t hac ā describes the cow. Lommel reads it as an adverb: ‘wie dem Wahrsein gem äß der Kuh teilhaftig wird der Viehz ü chter’ ( 1971 , p. 173). Is the poet indirectly preaching about the proper way of acquiring cattle (e.g. not stealing)? The striking parallelism between Y 51.5 and 50.2 obliges us to understand a ṣ̌ ā t hac ā as an adnominal. Besides, as we have seen in the G ā thic passages just discussed, the concern expressed with regard to the cow is consistently with her ritual treatment and not about how she is acquired. The question, ‘how does a pastoralist in accordance with truth fi nd a cow?’ is rather artifi cial on different levels. 77 The phrase has to be an adnominal. Kellens and Pirart ( 1988 , p. 182) translate a ṣ̌ ā t hac ā g ą m ‘la Vache harmonieuse’. The basic question about a ṣ̌ ā t hac ā is whether a ṣ̌ a- is to be understood in a concrete sense, for instance, as a metonym for the divine sphere, or in an abstract sense, e.g. order or truth. The probable equivalence of a ṣ̌ ā t hac ā g ą m and r ā nii ō .sk ə r ə it ī m g ą m speak for the former. As I argued, the adnominal a ṣ̌ ā t hac ā means something like ‘being oriented to (the domain of) a ṣ̌ a ’ just as Y 53.6 drū j ō hac ā seems to mean ‘being oriented to (the house of) druj ’. The cow that gives joy is the cow that facilitates access to the divine sphere. A \u0007 rmaiti is metonymically the indirect object of urū d ō iiat ā , to whom the pronoun h ī m also refers. urū d ō iia- is from ξ rud ‘block, hinder’ (so Kellens and Pirart 1990 , p. 311), and not from ξ rud ‘lament, moan’ (so AW , col. 1492; Hoffmann and Forssman 2004 , p. 292). The neuter noun ą nman- ‘breath’ occurs three times in the G ā th ā s. In Y 30.7, A \u0007 rmaiti is said to give ‘breath’ to ‘existence’ ( dad ā t ā rmaiti š ą nm ā ), while youthfulness ( utaiiū iti- ) gives it form. She provides the ‘breath’ to Mazd ā : Y 45.10a–c′ t ə̄ m n ə̄ yasn ā i š , ā rmat ō i š mima γ š ō / y ə̄ ą nm ə̄ n ī , mazd å sr ā uu ī ahur ō / hiiat h ō i a ṣ̌ ā , vohuc ā c ō i š t mana ŋ h ā ‘by means of consecrations inspired by A \u0007 rmaiti we seek to please him, Mazd ā Ahura, who is known for the breath that she allocates to him because of a ṣ̌ a and through good thinking.’ It is not completely clear in what exact sense the instrumentals must be understood in this sentence, but the relative pro-noun hiiat cannot refer to anything else than ą nman- ‘breath’, and c ō i š t ‘allo-cates’ can hardly have any other subject than A \u0007 rmaiti. ą nm ə̄ n ī is not a locative form (contra AW , col. 359; and Hoffmann and Forssman 2004 , p. 143) but an instrumental (so Kellens and Pirart 1990 , p. 220; and Tremblay 1996 , p. 119). Humbach’s translation of Y 45.10bb′ hardly makes any sense: ‘the Ahura who in the wind is heard (as being) the Wise One’ ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 166); Insler’s is no better: ‘the Lord who is famed to be Wise in His soul’ ( 1975 , p. 77). The reason why the supreme god is famous for the breath that he receives from A \u0007 rmaiti is perhaps given in Y 30.7: when Mazd ā ‘comes for the sake of ’ exist-ence ‘A \u0007 rmaiti gives it breath’; a phrase that is to be understood, I think, in an eschatological sense: 30.7cc′ a ē šą m t ō i ā ā ŋ hat , ya θ ā aiia ŋ h ā ā d ā n ā i š pouruii ō"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"The daēva cult 175‘with the enchainment of these (mortals), (existence) will be yours as the fi rst one (was)’ or ‘with the enchainment of these (mortals), (existence) will be like your primordial one (was)’. Perhaps, more generally, the ‘breath’ that A \u0007 rmaiti allocates to the divine sphere is that of the sacrifi cial ‘cow’. Thus the connec-tion between ‘breath’ and A \u0007 rmaiti is intimate. In Y 44.20, ‘breath’ must be a synecdoche for A \u0007 rmaiti. The subject of the infi nitive fr ā da ŋ\u000b h ē ‘to promote’ in Y 44.20ee′ seems to be A \u0007 ramiti. In Y 44.10 it is A \u0007 rmaiti that, accompanied by a ṣ̌ a , promotes ‘my living creatures’. Thus, here too, the instrumental a ṣ̌ ā should probably be understood in the comitative sense. The poet says that the kavi uses a ē šə ma to block the passage of A \u0007 rmaiti. Again, it seems that at stake is a certain form of ritual. According to Y 32.14, the ‘Kavis put their resourcefulness in his (i.e. the follower of druj ) bondage... when they place themselves in the service of a drugvan \u000f t and when the sacrifi cial cow is ill-treated ( g ā u š jaidii ā i mrao ī ) in order to assist the one who infl ames the fi re-proof ( haoma twigs)’. 78 Whether one interprets mrao ī as derived from ξ mrū ‘ill-treat’, attested in mrū ra- ‘gruelling’ ( AW , col. 1197), with Kellens and Pirart ( 1990 , p. 289), or from ξ mrū ‘say’, the ritual context is unmistakable. In Y 29 the mysteri-ous ‘Soul of the Cow’ complains of a ē šə ma , cruelty and bondage, etc. that have held her in ‘captivity’, and asks for ‘good pastoral work’ from the gods (Y 29.1), and then turns to a ṣ̌ a for the ‘measure’ ( ratu- ) of its existence (Y 29.2). Although no ‘measure’ is provided for the cow – for she is created for the breeder and the pastoralist (Y 29.6) – t ə̄ m ā zū t ō i š ahur ō m ą θ r ə m ta š at a ṣ̌ ā hazao š ō mazd å gauu ō i x š uu ī d ə mc ā ‘in harmony with a ṣ̌ a , Mazd ā Ahura has constructed for the cow the formula of libation and the milk’ (Y 29.7). Apparently, this provision satisfi es the ‘Soul of the Cow’ since the further complaint it makes is not about the lack of ratu- but about the ‘ineffective word’ of a ‘powerless man’ who is charged with bringing it to the mortals (Y 29.7–9). The dative gauu ō i marks the benefi ciary of the formula, not in the sense that the ritual is conducted for the cow – this, at any rate, is how I understand Y 29.6bb′ 79 – but insofar as it fi nds relief from a ē šə ma , etc., that is to say, from a certain kind of ritual, for releasing the cow (its soul?) to the ‘pasture’ of a ṣ̌ a and good thinking. The ‘formula of libation and the milk’ is to be given to the ‘mortals’ ( mar ə ta ē ibii ō ). Does the ritual that makes use of the ‘formula’ replace another form of ritual, whose elements constitute the substance of the complaint by the ‘soul of the cow’? Does the milk replace the blood of the cow? In any case, the cow that is denied to ‘those who greet the sun’ and their priests is not the cow in the fi eld but the ‘cow’ in a ritual role. The passage of A \u0007 rmaiti (to the divine sphere, cf. Y 32.2) and the ‘joy-giving cow’ are elements of a drama, in which the da ē vas are the antagonist. The a ē šə matic sacrifi ce of the ‘cow’, and the neglect and ritual blocking of the ‘vitalizing’ A \u0007 rmaiti by the ‘many who greet the sun’ and the traditional priests who offi ciate at their rituals – these ‘worst acts’ are constituted by the da ē vas and taken up by their mortal followers on their own account (Y 32.3–4), which makes them du š .xra θβ ā ‘imbeciles’ (Y 49.4), that is to say,"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"176 The daēva cultwho are incapable of realizing their desired end. We can appreciate, then, the full signifi cance of the poet’s (perhaps) rhetorical question in Y 44.20: ‘O Mazd ā , have the da ē vas ever exercised a salutary power?’ Have they ever pro-moted and protected ‘life’, whether in its corporeal state, across the threshold of death, or in its mental form? The ‘power’ that the poet has in mind in the wish he expresses to A \u0007 rmaiti in Y 48.5a–b′ is the power of life, of ensuring ‘life’ (in the face of ruination), in particular, given the context, the power of achieving the desired eschatological outcome: blissful existence in the divine sphere (Y 32.1). Let us go back to Y 32.5. Although the infi nitive x š aii ō ‘to exercise power’ is from the present stem, it must have the sense of ‘disposition over life’, which we discovered in Y 48.5aa′. Thus, if I am right, Y 32.5c′ is not about a particular follower of druj , e.g. Yima, but is a kind of defi nition of aka- vacah- ‘bad word’: it is used to appoint a follower of druj to the position of power over life in general, in earthly life and beyond, and across. The da ē vas aspire to this power. They intend a double deception. On the one hand, they approach Mazd ā with the offer of holding off from the divine sphere those who are ‘hostile’. On the other hand, they pretend that the actions they authorize and are involved in ‘together with (their) men’ (Y 32.3–4), and the words they utter ‘together with (their) men in pursuit of immorality’ (Y 48.1), can secure access to the divine sphere (cf. Y 44.20). Thus they deceive the mortal away from ‘good life and immortality’: Y 32.5aa′ t ā d ə b ə naot ā ma ṣ̌ı \u0002 m, hujii ā t ō i š am ə r ə t ā tasc ā . Benveniste ( 1975 , pp. 87–95) has shown that the Indo-Iranian abstract nouns in -ti denote actual actions, while those in -tu have the sense of intention or capacity for action, or are sometimes concretized as means or aims of action. The charge made against the da ē vas tells us three things: that ‘good life and immortality’ constitute an object of longing for mortals; that together they defi ne a comprehensive set; and that the distinction made between them must be signifi cant. am ə r ə tat ā t- has to be positively marked, since we know that even the followers of druj continue to exist after death: a ‘lasting period of darkness’ (Y 31.20) in the ‘house of druj ’ (Y 51.14). Thus ‘immortality’ neither means simply existence after death nor long earthly life. This latter interpretation has no textual or con-ceptual basis. ‘Immortality’ is a divine condition: 34.1a–b′ y ā š\u000b iiao θ an ā y ā vaca ŋ h ā , y ā yasn ā am ə r ə tat ā t ə m / a ṣ̌ə mc ā taibii ō d åŋ h ā , mazd ā x š a θ r ə mc ā hauruuat ā t ō ‘the action, the word, the worship by which you, O Mazd ā , establish for yourself immortality, a ṣ̌ a and the power over completeness’. The integrity of the corporeal form (the ‘togetherness’ of its constituents) is intimately associated with ‘immortality’. In Y 32.1 the da ē vas ask Mazd ā for the divine ‘bliss’, and in Y 48.1, together with their mortal followers, they seek ‘immortality’. The ‘immortality’ of which the da ē vas deprive their followers is evidently the blissful existence in paradise, where signifi -cantly a ṣ̌ a is found. 80 The exact meaning of hujii ā ti- is diffi cult to determine. Nonetheless, the appreciative prefi x and the presence of the coordinated ‘immortality’ indicate that it probably signifi es a good earthly life. Together,"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"The daēva cult 177they seem to constitute the totality of conditions desired by the mortals. We saw that in Y 44.20 the poet asks whether the da ē vas ever exercised a salu-tary power, which in the light of our analysis of ξ x š ā may also be put in another manner: have the da ē vas ever been able to secure the desirable exist-ence? For the da ē vas to ‘exercise deception’ ( d ə b ə naot ā ) there must be a dis-semblance, a pretence, on their part. The pretence is: they give access to the divine sphere and perhaps secure good life on earth. The poet’s knowledge of the constitution of human existence and its possible fi nal states, which is the basis of his discourse on the proper conduct, comes from the ‘vitalizing intuition’ and is thus ‘true’ and ‘effi cacious’. By contrast, the pretension of the da ē va cult is grounded in untruth, in deception; its ultimate source is the ‘deceiver’, the ‘harmful intuition’. The rejection by the poet of the G ā th ā s of the ritual that is offered to the da ē vas is rooted in this comprehensive opposition, and not merely in the incorrectness of the ritual, whatever this might mean. The da ē vas deceive those who place in them their hope for the desired existence. It is Mazd ā and the G ā thic gods, in particular A \u0007 rmaiti, who possess the ‘measure’ ( ratu- ) of the desired conditions of existence. In two articles I have argued that this is the meaning of the Ahuna Vairiia (Y 27.13) and that it is in this sense that it is understood in the YAv. exegesis of the prayer (Y 19). 81 In Y 43.6 A \u0007 rmaiti gives the ‘measure’ to the righteous, behind which stands the ultimate guarantee of its effectiveness: Mazd ā ’s xratu- ‘resourcefulness’: Y 43.6d–e′ a ē ibii ō ratū š , s ə̄ n \u000f ghait ī ā rmaiti š / θβ ahii ā xrat ə̄ u š , y ə̄ m na ē ci š d ā baiieit ī ‘A \u0007 rmaiti announces for these (righteous ones) the measures of your resourceful intelligence, which nothing frustrates’. 82 Mazd ā is not just the creator god but also the vitalizing god: 51.16c sp ə n \u000f t ō mazd å ahur ō ‘Mazd ā Ahura (is) the vitalizing one’. The causal conjunctive hiiat ‘as’ perhaps also signals a temporal arrange-ment in the situation that has made the da ē vas into what they are. Hence, what is described in the subordinate clause Y 32.5bb′ explains the action of the da ē vas in respect of the ‘mortal’ both as a fact (see below) and as having been taking place since primordial times. This interpretation seems probable to me because of what we are told in Y 30.6, and more generally Y 30.3–7. The deception of the da ē vas originally occurs in the mythical past and is the reason why they act the way they do toward the ‘mortal’. The poet’s explan-ation of the wrongful conduct of the da ē vas indicates a revaluation of these gods: he sets against the traditional view of these gods his ‘true’ knowledge of the primordial events. Y 32.5b–c (i.e. the explanation of the conduct of the da ē vas ) is in fact with-out a verb. What is the elliptical verb? 83 Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 133) trans-lates the clause: ‘because the evil spirit along with evil thought (had lured) you, the da ē vas , (away from them), (the evil spirit) as well as the action (inspired) by the evil word’. Given the use of the noun o d ə baoman- in Y 30.5 in respect of the same event, one might consider ξ dab ‘deceive’ as an obvious candi-date. Insler ( 1975 , p. 45) and Humbach carry the two ablatives along with the verb. 84 The problem would then be how to understand the idea of ‘evil spirit"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"178 The daēva cultand action’ depriving the da ē vas from ‘good life and immortality’. If we take the couple ‘good life and immortality’ as defi ning a comprehensive set, ‘good life’ has to signify earthly life, the good life of this world, as opposed to the immortal (i.e. divine) state, to which one aspires beyond death. In Y 32.1, as we saw, the da ē vas are portrayed as seeking Mazd ā ’s ‘bliss’, and in Y 48.1 they are explicitly portrayed as ‘in pursuit of immortality’, a divine condition and not just perpetual existence. It seems, then, that there is good ground to read ‘immortality’ as the ablative complement of the supplemented verb ‘deceive’ in the subordinated clause Y 32.5b–c. However, since the term is embedded in a complementary set in Y 32.5a′, if carried, it has to be accompanied by ‘good life’. Humbach’s translated text, then, implies that the da ē vas had at some stage an earthly existence. It is true that we have a tradition (e.g. Y 9.15) according to which the da ē vas are supposed to have been driven ‘under the earth’ ( z ə mar ə .gū z- ) by Zarathu š tra’s recitation of the Ahuna Vairiia . But this does not necessarily imply – even if the term z ə mar ə .gū z- must be under-stood literally rather than, say, in the sense of ‘damned’ 85 – that the da ē vas were earthlings. There is also another tradition according to which the da ē vas once mingled with men: in Y 9.15 it is said that prior to their being driven underground they went about the earth in human form ( v ī r ō .rao δ a- ). This is in all probability from a time that they had already become demons or some such thing. In the Zamy ā d Ya š t (Yt 19), the primordial universal kings are said to have ruled over da ē uuan ą m ma ṣ̌ ii ā n ą mca y ā θβ ą m pairikan ą mca s ā θ r ą m kaoii ą m karafn ą mca ‘the da ē vas and men, sorcerers and sorceresses, tyrants, Kavis and Karapans’ (Y 19.26, 28, 31). But one can hardly draw any conclusion from this list regarding the earthly status of the da ē vas . The point is rather that these kings brought the whole hostile world under their con-trol. To the age-old comprehensive set of ‘gods and men’, which now means ‘demons and men’, are added other religiously signifi cant hostile groups. But none of this implies that the da ē vas are conceived as earthlings in the G ā th ā s. The very notion of da ē uuaiiasna- ‘ da ē va -worshipper’ ( AW , col. 670) implies the otherworldly status of the da ē vas : one ‘worships’ them the same way as one does the ‘gods’: by offering praise and sacrifi ce. In Yt 5.94–95 they are portrayed as helping themselves ( paiti.v ī s ə n \u000f te ) to the sacrifi ce offered by the ‘ da ē va -worshippers’ to the goddess Ardv ī Sur ā An ā hit ā after sunset. The da ē vas are otherworldly in the G ā th ā s. ‘Good life and immortality’ together constitute human aspirations. All this leaves the question of the missing verb unanswered. 86 The choice of ξ dab ‘deceive’ for the clause relies not just on the immediate context but also on Y 30.6. Nonetheless, I believe that Kellens and Pirart ( 1988 , p. 119) are right to argue for ξ d ā ‘set’. As they explain, the verb regularly takes two accusatives with the meaning of ‘making X into Y’. 87 The addition of the verb (e.g. d ą n ) also rectifi es the defective meter of Y 32.5b′, if in fact it is defective. But, more importantly, the sense of the phrase with ξ d ā would perfectly fi t with what we learn from Y 32.3, where the da ē vas are said to be what they are because they are grounded in ‘bad thought’, which also explains their"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"The daēva cult 179involvement in the action(s) inspired by druj . The action in question seems to be related to a ē šə ma ritual. As we saw in Y 44.20, the a ē šə ma rite of those ‘who greet the sun’ conducted by the kavi and other cult offi cials is the frame of the question the poet puts to Mazd ā : have the da ē vas ever exercised a salu-tary power ( hux š a θ r ā )? In Y 30.6 we are told that ‘as the da ē vas choose the worst thinking they rush to a ē šə ma ’, and in the course of the ritual, together with their mortal devotees, utter ‘harm-mobilizing’ ( ą sa š ut ā ) words ‘in pur-suit of immortality’ (Y 48.1). The da ē vas assert their claim to have disposition over access to the divine sphere in Y 32.1. We can see that Y 32.5c′ represents the nature of the illusion to which the da ē vas succumb, namely the pretension to the position of power over (desirable) life. The ‘bad thinking’ from which they proceed (Y 32.3aa′) is in fact the ground of ruination, and the ‘bad intu-ition’, their ‘Deceiver’ in Y 30.6, ‘in the end’ delivers the followers of druj to the ‘worst existence’ (Y 30.4). On the other hand, the d ā θ a- ‘righteous’ receives the ratu- ‘measure’, which gives access to the divine sphere ( a ṣ̌ ā t hac ā ). Now, just as there is the pretence , staged in the a ē šə ma ritual, that the da ē vas do have disposition over life in all its dimensions, i.e. worldly, otherworldly and in transition, so, too, one pretends that the followers of druj are in the pos-ition of receiving the ‘measure’: Y 32.10a–b′ huu ō m ā n ā srauu å m ō r ə n \u000f dat , y ə̄ aci š t ə m va ē na ŋ\u000b h ē aog ə d ā / g ą m a š ibii ā huuar ə c ā , yasc ā d ā θ ə̄ n \u000f g dr ə guuat ō dad ā t ‘he enfeebles my poems: the man who utters the worst (words) in order to see with his eyes the cow and the sun, and the one who places the followers of druj in the position of the righteous’. Wrongly impressed by the references in the following verse line to devastation of pasture and hostility displayed against the a ṣ̌ avan , Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 134) and Insler ( 1975 , p. 47) think Y 32.10b′ describes a quasi-political situation: respectively, ‘and who makes the just (into subjects) of the deceitful one’, and ‘the one who has set the deceitful against the just’. The word d ā θ a- seems to have a specifi c sense in the G ā th ā s: the one who is entitled to receive the ‘measure’. It is set, in a dualistic comprehensive set, against ad ā θ a- : Y 46.15bb′ d ā θ ə̄ n \u000f g v ī caiia θ ā ad ā θ ą sc ā ‘discern the righteous ones and the unrighteous ones’. In Y 51.5, the ‘resourceful pastoralist’ identifi es for the d ā θ a- the ‘measure’ ( ratu- ). And in Y 28.10, the d ā θ a- is described as ə r ə θβ a - ‘who is in accordance with the meas-ure’. I have tried to show elsewhere the eschatological valence of ‘measure’. 88 Thus the meaning of Y 32.10b′ is the condemnation of the one who pretends that the followers of druj are in a position to entertain the hope of attaining ‘good life and immortality’. The word š\u000b iiao θ an ə m in Y 32.5c is in the nominative, and should probably be understood to refer to the deprecated ritual. The relative phrase in the accusative y ə̄ n \u000f g da ē uu ə̄ n \u000f g ‘(those) who (are) the da ē vas ’ emphatically recalls the identity of the addressee. It is assimilated to the enclitic v å ‘you’ in the accusative. The poet regularly emphasizes the da ē vas in their failure: Y 30.6 da ē uu ā cin ā ; Y 32.3 da ē uu ā v ī sp åŋ h ō ... ci θ r ə m ; Y 32.5 v å ... y ə̄ n \u000f g da ē uu ə̄ n \u000f g ; Y 44.20 ci θ ə n ā ... da ē uu ā .

We declare you superior to all the xrafstar da ē vas and the mortals. Formally, the action noun ī š ti- can be from four different roots. Kellens and Pirart ( 1990 , p. 224) consistently derive it from √ yaz ‘offer (sacrifi ce)’, cognate of Vedic is \u000f t \u0011 í - , and translate it ‘mani è re sacrifi cielle, rite’. It can also be derived from √ is ‘be capable’. Lommel ( 1971 , p. 87: ‘Macht’), Insler ( 1975 , p. 55: ‘mastery’) and Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 140: ‘command’) generally derive ī š ti- from √ is . The other two formal possibilities are √ i š ‘seek, desire’ (cf. EWA , vol. 1, p. 270) and √ i š ‘set in motion’ (cf. EWA , vol. 1, p. 271). The noun occurs eleven times in the G ā th ā s but not a single time in the YH. The reason for the consistency of the translations despite the number of formal possibilities is not hard to determine: the word occurs three times with both vohu- manah- and x š a θ ra- , four times with the former and twice with the latter. The least one can say is that it has an elective affi nity with these concepts. In its four collocations with vohu- manah- , ī š ti- is determined by it in the genitive (Y 46.2), ‘allocated’ ( √ ci š ) by it (Y 46.18), ‘esteemed’ by it (Y 32.9), and made available through it (Y 49.12). It is thus an activity or a phenomenon that is available thanks to ‘good thinking’. In this respect it is like x š a θ ra- , 90 with which it is intimately associated: once, in the genitive, it determines x š a θ ra- (Y 51.2), and once is determined by the latter in the genitive (Y 48.8). In Y 48.8aa′ k ā t ō i va ŋ h ə̄ u š , mazd ā x š a θ rahii ā ī š ti š ‘O Mazd ā , which ī š ti- does your good power make available?’, both ‘command’ (Humbach 1991 , vol. 1, p. 178: ‘the command of Thy good power’) and ‘power’ (Insler 1975 , p. 93: ‘the power of Thy good rule’) sound somewhat pleonastic. In Y 51.2 d ō i š ā m ō i i š t ō i š x š a θ r ə m ‘I will show you the power of my ī š ti- ’, Humbach’s ‘the power of my command’ ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 186) makes sense if understood as ‘the power that I command’. Kellens and Pirart’s ‘je vais montrer l’emprise de mon rite’ ( 1988 , p. 181) is plausible, but then ‘rite’ hardly makes sense in Y 48.8: ‘what is the ritual that your good power makes available?’ Kellens and Pirart ( 1988 , p. 170) read x š a θ rahii ā ī š ti š as an objective genitive: ‘Quel est, ô Mazd ā , le rite qui donne la divine emprise sur toi?’ This reading is based on their interpretation of x š a θ ra- as the ‘hold’ on the divinity to which sacrifi ce is offered, which I have already discussed.

Y 48.8aa′ k ā t ō i va ŋ h ə̄ u š , mazd ā x š a θ rahii ā ī š ti š means ‘O Mazd ā , what control does your good power make available (to me)?’ Therefore Y 34.5a–b means: ‘Which power do you possess, O Mazd ā , what mastery (do I exercise), thanks to good thinking and because of a ṣ̌ a , for (my) enactment or as I sleep?’ 93 The meaning of š\u000b iiao θ an ā i... ya θ ā v ā hahm ī ‘for (my) enactment or as I sleep’ is not easy to decipher. The two terms must form a signifi cant pair, but the phrase could hardly mean ‘day and night’. This would be a strange cir-cumlocution marred with an incomprehensible disparateness of components. We have two clues to unravel its mystery: ī š ti- and drigu- . Let us go back to the former. There are three occurrences of the word that are particularly instruct-ive. In Y 32.9 the poet complains about the ‘announcements’ of the ‘one with bad doctrine’: 32.9a–b′ du š .sasti š srauu å m ō r ə n \u000f dat , huu ō jii ā t ə̄ u š s ə̄ n \u000f ghan ā i š xratū m / ap ō m ā ī š tim apaiian \u000f t ā , b ə r ə x δ ą m h ā it ī m va ŋ h ə̄ u š mana ŋ h ō ‘the one with bad doctrine enfeebles my words: with his announcements concerning life, he binds my resourcefulness and control, which is nonetheless esteemed by good thinking’. The announcements of the bad doctrinaire just as, e.g. the ‘words’ of Y 48.1, have the power to enfeeble. Here, though, the nature of the enfeeblement is specifi ed. It is clearly a magico-religious harm. The poet complains of his discourse ( srauu å ) being ‘enfeebled’. The verb ξ mard ‘enfee-ble’ more exactly means something like ‘render without force’ (cf. Kellens and Pirart 1990 , p. 282: ‘rendre sans force, corrompre’). Mayrhofer ( EWA , vol. 2, p. 386) translates its Vedic cognate mrad ‘sanft machen, weich machen’. The poet’s complaint is that his discourse is rendered ineffective to achieve its goal. The expansion, Y 32.9a′–b′, of the opening clause, Y 32.9a, further articulates the point in a general statement. We saw that xratu- designates in general the power to achieve a goal, and that ī š ti- is the control that the poet exercises in particular over x š a θ ra- , which is made available to him through ‘good thinking’. These two faculties are held back from their goal by the bad doctrinaire’s utterances. The verb apa + ξ yam literally means ‘hold away’ the accusative (cf. EWA , vol. 2, p. 399; Hoffmann and Forssman 2004 , p. 316), obviously from a goal. Humbach’s translation of apaiian \u000f t ā with ‘robs’ ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 134) is misleading, Lommel’s ‘verhindert’ ( 1971 , p. 61) perfect. It is the x š a θ ra- acquired through vohu- manah- that the poet has in mind when he talks about his ‘control’. The connection between these three may be gathered in more detail from Y 51.18–19."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"182 The daēva cult Y 51.18 t ą m cist ī m d ə̄ j ā m ā sp ō , huu ō .guu ō i š t ō i š x v ar ə n å a ṣ̌ ā v ə r ə n \u000f t ē tat x š a θ r ə m, mana ŋ h ō va ŋ h ə̄ u š v ī d ō tat m ō i d ā id ī ahur ā , hiiat mazd ā rap ə̄ n tauu ā J ā m ā spa Hauguva chooses...

The two participial phrases describe the subject of dazd ē ‘acquires’. The instrumental gaiiehii ā š\u000b iiao θ an ā i š can be governed either by the verb just mentioned or by an attributive. But, given the positioning of the phrase and the conceptual implications, the latter is in all probability the correct interpretation. The genitive in the phrase must be objective. The power in question is better because the actions it underlies promote life. The signifi cance of ‘existence’ ( ahu- ) is prima facie ambiguous in the stanza. But we know that da ē n ā has a psychopompic role (cf. esp. Y 31.20, 33.13, 46.11, 51.13, 51.21, 53.2, 53.5). It is therefore almost certain that at issue is existence in the divine sphere. The conception of ‘control’ that J ā m ā spa adheres to out of his interest for a ṣ̌ a is the one that requires him to make his own the power of good thinking. Mazd ā grants this ‘supportive’ power (cf. Y 50.1). ‘Life’ ( gaiia ) must be understood in the same unrestricted and positive sense as in Y 30.3. 95 As a concept, ī š ti- means ‘control’ of the power of good thinking for the purpose of promoting life. The eschatological orientation of ‘control’ is emphasized in Y 53.1a-c′′ vahi š t ā ī š ti š sr ā uu ī , zara θ u š trah ē / spit ā mahii ā yez ī h ō i, d ā t ā iiapt ā / a ṣ̌ ā t hac ā ahur ō , mazd å yauu ō i v ī sp ā i. ā , huua ŋ h ə uu ī m ‘It will be known that Zarathu š tra Spit ā ma’s is the best control, should Ahura Mazd ā give him soteriological award and eternal blissful existence (or: since Ahura Mazd ā will make eternal blissful existence the a ṣ̌ ā t hac ā award’. huua ŋ h ə uuiia- is a particular state of being, namely blissful existence in paradise. 96 Narten ( 1986 , pp. 238–41) underwrites the common understanding of drigu- ‘needy’. 97 ‘Auch an den Beiden Gatha-Stellen l äß t sich die Annahme, da ß mit drigu- ein macht- und besitzloser Mensch gemeint ist, vertreten’ (Narten 1986 , p. 239). The socio-economic valence of the word perhaps fi nds support in the passages, e.g. Y 34.5 and Y 50.1, where the poet seems to describe his social condition. It does not seem, however, that the depressed social condi-tion as such is considered to produce entitlement. Rather, it must be the basis for approaching the gods for ‘protection’; but exactly in what sense ‘neediness’"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"The daēva cult 183is understood is not easy to determine. It does not seem to be in the sense of ‘in need of socio-political protection’, or at least only in this connection. Of course, the specifi cally magico-religious ‘power’ could have been mobilized for worldly ends. The turn to personalized invisible powers on the part of the helpless in the face of oppressive conditions is, according to a philosopher, the core impulse behind myth. 98 The inspired poet would bring these forces to bear on behalf of the ‘needy’. But the G ā th ā s do not allow us to restrict the ‘protection’ that the gods are asked to provide to the mundane. In fact, the worldly intervention of the protective gods is there, but for the most part as a background. Ancient conceptions of deities and of their relation to men are generally religious transpositions of socio-political relations. 99 Eschatology, too, makes use of the vocabulary of societal conditions, its familiarity, and its emotional resonance. The importance of pastoral terms in particular, like v ā star- , is a general phenomenon of ancient religious thought. The contro-versy over the ‘metaphorical’ use of, e.g. v ā star- only proves the inappropri-ateness of our perspective. Is it in the ‘metaphorical’ sense where used of a protective god? The question seems to be badly formulated. The history of religions, anthropology and comparative sociology of reli-gious behaviour allow us to reconstruct in some measure the conceptual uni-verse to which we must assume the term belonged – at our risk, of course, but we have no other choice. What, indeed, does the ‘pastoralist’ have to do with the protection asked for one’s soul once it is separated from the body, whether in ritual, while asleep, or at death? Is it because the soul is on its own that it is in need of protection – in all these cases a situation of helplessness being at hand? Is it because the lowly, let us say, has not been able to ensure through fi tting, lavish sacrifi ce the good will of the gods either for his earthly existence or for the fi nal journey of his soul? The juxtaposition remains puzzling: Y 50.1 kat m ō i uruu ā , is ē cahii ā auua ŋ h ō k ə̄ m ō i pas ə̄ u š , k ə̄ m ə̄ .n ā θ r ā t ā vist ō anii ō a ṣ̌ ā t , θβ ā t c ā mazd ā ahur ā azd ā zū t ā , vahi š t ā at c ā mana ŋ h ō Does my soul dispose of any help whatever? Which protector other than a ṣ̌ a and you, O Mazd ā Ahura, and Good Thinking is assuredly there for me and for my (sacrifi cial?) animal at the time of invocation (for help)? The adverb azd ā ‘assuredly, obviously’, despite its position, naturally modifi es the verbal adjective vist ō ‘found’. The reference of the action noun zū ti- ‘invocation’, from √ zū ‘call, invoke’, is obscure. The Vedic cognate √ hav means ‘call on’, e.g. the gods, so ritual invocation of the gods, but it can also be used in non-ritual contexts, according to Mayrhofer ( EWA , vol. 2, pp. 809–10). 100 In the G ā th ā s, however, the verb is consistently used to call on deities, especially for ‘help’, whether this is explicitly stated (Y 49.12) or not (Y 51.10). Thus, as Kellens and Pirart ( 1991 , p. 241) have remarked, the action noun"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"184 The daēva cult zū ti- governs the implied auuah- ‘help’. This shows that the two juxtaposed questions, Y 50.1aa′ and 1b–d′, cannot be separated. One might think that the reason for coupling the two questions is to underline the twofold character of the function of the protective gods, worldly and eschatological, but the notion of auuah- does not seem to be used in a non-cultic context in the G ā th ā s. Nonetheless, the temporal locative zū t ā ‘at the time of invocation (for help)’ need not, and in fact should not, be taken in the restrictive sense of ‘during invocation’ – not: ‘who is there to protect me during ritual invocation?’, but: ‘who is there for sure at the time of invocation, so I can ask for help?’ The ‘help’ is probably sought for the soul especially when in need of protection, i.e. separated from the body. Y 46.2 presents a similar situation: the neediness of the poet is presented in socio-economic terms, and on this basis, the boon-granting god is approached for ‘help’, which is nearly viewed as compensation. Although the exact nature of this ‘help’ is not specifi ed, it is related to the ī š ti- ‘control’ that good think-ing allows the poet to exercise.

Behold (then) (my) control, (in adherence) with a ṣ̌ a , available through good thinking! Whether caguu å is from caguuah- or caguuan \u000f t- (Kellens and Pirart 1990 , p. 240), it is in the nominative, and so cannot be related to the vocative ahur ā . This means that the enclitic neuter pronoun ī t does not refer to the complaint but to giving raf ə δ r ə̄ m ‘help’ (contra Lommel 1971 , p. 132; Insler 1975 , p. 81; Humbach 1991 , vol. 1, p. 168; Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 158). The adjective caguu å modifi es frii ō ‘friend’, both in the nominative. The genitive va ŋ h ə̄ u š ... ī š t ī m mana ŋ h ō is subjective: the poet’s ‘control’ is available to him through good thinking. From other passages considered above, in particular Y 51.2b′ d ō i š ā m ō i i š t ō i š x š a θ r ə m , we know that the object of control is x š a θ ra- ‘power’. The help the poet seeks is in fact magico-religious power, thus turning his mundane powerlessness to good account. 101 The instrumental a ṣ̌ ā is not the complement of ā xs ō but of ī š t ī m , an action noun with verbal force. Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 168) makes a ṣ̌ ā an attributive: ‘Look upon the vigour of good thought, (inspired) by truth’. For Insler ( 1975 , p. 81), it is a comitative instrumental: ‘Let me see the power of good thinking allied with truth!’ His analysis, however, is unacceptable, based on a vague (unexamined) sense of"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"The daēva cult 185 ī š ti- ‘control’. The instrumental has the sense of an authorising reference: it expresses the ground of ‘controlling’ the power that the protective god grants (cf. Y 51.18–19). Three times, as we said, drigu- ‘needy’ occurs in the G ā th ā s, and each time we fi nd it in close connection with the power ( x š a θ ra- ) of the protective god. In Y 27.13 the power that the protective god, Mazd ā Ahura, receives through good thinking makes him a pastor of the needy ones ( va ŋ h ə̄ u š dazd ā mana ŋ h ō ... x š a θ r ə mc ā ahur ā i. ā yim drigubii ō dadat v ā st ā r ə m ). 102 The Ahuna Vairiia was understood by the Young Avestan tradition as the acknowledge-ment of Mazd ā as the guiding and protective god, with an eschatological sig-nifi cance. In Y 27.13, ratu- a ṣ̌ ā t hac ā places the appointment in the perspective of eschatology. In Y 53.9 the subjunctive aorist verb d ā h ī expresses an envis-aged action, taking place presumably in the future once and for all: Y 53.9d-d′′ tat mazd ā tauu ā x š a θ r ə m, y ā ə r əžə jii ō i d ā h ī , + drigauu ē vahii ō ‘that power is yours, O Mazd ā , with which you will have made it better (i.e., best) for the needy who lives rightly’. The protective god’s ‘power’ is placed here in direct relationship with eschatology. The subjunctive d ā h ī is not from ξ d ā ‘give’ but from ξ d ā ‘set, place’. Yet, as far as I know, all the scholars understand it in the former sense. Bartholomae ( AW , col. 778) translates: ‘du dem rechtlebenden Armen das bessere Los verschaffen wirst’; Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 194): ‘Thou mayest grant the better (part)’; Insler ( 1975 , p. 113): ‘Thou shalt grant what is very good’; Kellens and Pirart ( 1988 , p. 191): ‘tu veux bien faire le meilleur don’. We fi nd the same particular usage of the comparative vahii ō as the direct object of ξ d ā ‘set, place’, with a dative of person as the benefi ciary and the divine x š a θ ra- ‘power’ as the instrumental of means, in Y 51.6, where the eschatological frame is unmistakable. 51.6 y ə̄ vahii ō va ŋ h ə̄ u š dazd ē , yasc ā h ō i v ā r ā i r ā dat ahur ō x š a θ r ā mazd å , at ahm ā i ak ā t a š\u000b ii ō y ə̄ h ō i n ō it v ī d ā it ī , ap ə̄ m ē a ŋ h ə̄ u š uruua ē s ē Who makes it better than good by his power for the one who accedes to his will, but worse than bad for the one who would not venerate him, at the last turn of existence, (is) Ahura Mazd ā ’. 103 The expression ‘set in place what is better than good for the one, and for the other worse than bad’ recalls Y 48.4 ‘things being within your power of achieving your intended ends ( xratu- ), the outcome will be different for each depending on the shape of their da ē n ā ’. In Y 53.9, the divine power clearly serves eschatological ends. One can see that drigu- ‘needy’ is not merely a socio-economic category but has taken on a defi nite eschatological sense: the needy is the one who is in need of the protective god’s power ( x š a θ ra- ) of making it ‘better than good’ for him, who lives rightly and adheres to the god’s teachings.

This is clearly wrongheaded, both as a general proposition and as a G ā thic statement in particular, in view of the doctrine of ‘power’ and its relation with ‘good thinking’. Good thinking is what makes possible the poet’s con-trol of the divine power, and it is through good thinking that this power is exchanged between the supreme god and his worshippers. A ṣ̌ a , on the other hand, is the ground on which the protective god’s intervention is requested, the reason for the god’s exercise of power on behalf of the ‘needy’ and for the poet’s exercising control over that power. 104 This is the frame in which we have to place the puzzling phrase š\u000b iiao θ an ā i... ya θ ā v ā hahm ī ‘for (my) enactment and as I sleep’. Insler ( 1975 , p. 222) edits the verb to ahm ī , represented only by poor Indian manuscripts (e.g. J3, L13, O2), and interprets ya θ ā v ā ahm ī as a parenthetical emphasis of the poet’s status: ‘as I indeed am’ (Insler 1975 , p. 55). This forces him to have θ r ā ii ō idii ā i governed by a noun, i.e. š\u000b iiao θ ana- , which is otherwise unattested except perhaps in the case of nouns in ti . 105 Our phrase cannot mean ‘during wakefulness or as I sleep’. It is not any action whatsoever that is commended to the divine protection. The repudiation of the da ē vas tells us what action the poet has in mind in Y 34.5. It is the action that is diametrically opposed to the one we encounter in Y 32.4–5, the ‘worst action’ that deprives man of the resourcefulness ( xratu- ) of Mazd ā and leads him astray from the path of a ṣ̌ a . In this way, man is cheated out of ‘good life and immortality’. In Y 30.5, the poet’s action is specifi ed as hai θ iia- š\u000b iiao θ ana- ‘true action’, which pleases Mazd ā , and for whose ‘measure’ one should look to the protective god (Y 27.13). In Y 51.19 it is described as the action that promotes life ( gaiiehii ā š\u000b iiao θ ana- ), where ‘life’ connotes the valued (mental) existence. More immediately, the ‘action’ of Y 34.5 is already introduced and described in 34.2bb′ sp ə n \u000f tax \u000b ii ā c ā n ə r əš š\u000b iiao θ an ā , yehii ā uruu ā a ṣ̌ ā hacait ē ‘the action of the vitalizing man whose soul is associated with a ṣ̌ a ’. Whether the ‘vitalization of existence’ (Y 43.2–3) is oriented to the ‘best (mental) exist-ence’ in the divine sphere or to a ‘true state of being’, apparently on earth, made ‘splendid’ by the power of the protective god (Y 34.15), it is a pro-gramme that involves the vitalizing man in situations of strife with the forces of druj , both supernatural and mundane. The all-embracing nature, indeed the cosmological dimension, of this combat between the ‘vitalizers’ of exist-ence ( sao š iian \u000f t- ) and the ‘partisan of druj ’ is sketched in Y 46.3–4: kad ā mazd ā , y ō i ux š ā n ō asn ą m / a ŋ h ə̄ u š dar ə θ r ā i, fr ō a ṣ̌ ahii ā fr ā r ə n \u000f t ē / v ə r ə zd ā i š s ə̄ n \u000f gh ā i š , sao š iian \u000f t ą m xratauu ō /... at t ə̄ n \u000f g dr ə guu å , y ə̄ n \u000f g a ṣ̌ ahii ā va ž dr ə̄ n \u000f g p ā t / g å fr ō r ə t ō i š, ... du ž az ō b å h ą s, x v ā i š š \u000b iiao θ an ā i š ah ə̄ must ō / yast ə̄ m x š a θ r ā t , mazd ā m ō i θ at jii ā t ə̄ u š v ā / huu ō t ə̄ n \u000f g fr ō .g å , pa θ m ə̄ n \u000f g hucist ō i š carat "},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"The daēva cult 187 When will the bulls of days, the effi cacious powers of the vitalizers, rise in support of the existence of a ṣ̌ a with thriving (?) declarations?

He who deprives him (the drugvan \u000f t) of power and the capacity to live will make these (oxen) the vanguards of the fl ight of good insight’. 106 For his perilous ‘action’ against the forces of druj, the vitalizing man needs the protective power of the supreme god (cf.

Sleep puts the poet in touch with the invisible origins of existence; it is, as we saw, a privileged medium of true knowledge. But the possession of ‘second insight’, that is, the vision of the invisible, is also a source of danger. Just as the soul needs guidance and protection upon entering the realm of the dead in archaic Greek literature and in the mystery religions, and in Vedic literature, so, too, does the G ā thic poet, because of the very nature of his activity. The invisible is both the source of true knowledge and a perilous realm. Thus ya θ ā v ā hahm ī ‘or as I sleep’ does not refer to death or actual sleep (or ecstatic seiz-ure), but to any of these as a state of being in contact with the invisible. 107 The dual determination of the role of the poet, namely as the man of divine intu-ition and vitalizing action, is also refl ected in Y 34.2, which confi rms the sense proposed here for ‘as I sleep’: 34.2a–b at c ā ī t ō i mana ŋ h ā , mainii ə̄ u š c ā va ŋ h ə̄ u š v ī sp ā d ā t ā / sp ə n \u000f tax \u000b ii ā c ā n ə r əš š\u000b iiao θ an ā ‘all the (primordial) determinations (are) yours, both (those) of the good intuition (apprehended) by thought and (those) of the vitalizing man (accomplished) by action’.

The enclitic t ō i must be genitive, not dative, contra Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 125.

Mortals have always looked to the gods for attaining their ultimate desires. Life is not just an absolute value for man, against which everything is meas-ured, but also a constant source of anxiety, something that can be easily taken away from him.

The G ā thic gods are considered super-ior to the traditional gods. A common measure is implied in the comparison. Obviously it is not a question of one group of deities being merely imaginary, or even being less ‘godlike’, whatever this might mean. Unfortunately, the adjective xrafstra- used here and elsewhere of the da ē vas has resisted ana-lysis, so one cannot be certain of its exact meaning and reference, but it is a term that in the G ā th ā s has a special affi nity with the da ē vas . 108 In any case, the common measure is more or less clear. The G ā thic gods are superior to the da ē vas and their mortal devotees in providing the knowledge and action (the measure and power) necessary for the desirable life. The turn away from the da ē vas is underway at the time of the composition of the G ā th ā s. Both the antagonism between the followers of the G ā thic doctrine and the adherents of the da ē va cult, and the formation of a new community based on the new thought are signalled in Y 45.11.

The instrumental pronoun t ā from Y 45.11a probably refers to ahm ā i st ō i from the previous stanza. The nominative apar ō must be among the introduced antecedents of the opening relative pronoun. Kellens and Pirart ( 1990 , p. 201) understand it in a temporal sense: ‘qui vient en second place, ult é rieur’. So do Bartholomae: ‘posterior’ ( AW , vol. 76) and Mayrhofer: ‘hinterer, sp ä terer’ ( EWA , vol. 1, pp. 83–84). The Old Persian adverb aparam certainly means ‘subsequently or later on’ (cf. EWA , vol. 1, p. 83). Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 167) translates the adjective ‘the other one’ and maintains that it refers to Zarathu š tra. This implied reference is quite possible. His supposed activity entails a change in current religious practices and beliefs, which may be what is meant in his being described as apar ō ‘the one coming after’. But he is also said to be the da ē n ā of the master of the house, who thus plays a salvifi c role.

A confrontation with the cult of the da ē vas could not have been confi ned to matters of rite in the narrow sense. Their relation with the da ē vas , clearly refl ected in the G ā th ā s, had to be the ground of the authority the karapans claimed for themselves. These ancient Iranian priests presided, perhaps indirectly, over the norms of communal life. But these norms, like any set of social norms, had to be biased in the interest of a section of the community, 111 whose scope had now perhaps expanded to embrace settled confederations of tribes ( dax \u000b iiu- ). Elective worship of a part of the pantheon by particular sections of society, however defi ned, 112 was a regular phenomenon of the ancient world. The ‘good life’ thus had its social markers, as it always does. The mortals associated with the da ē vas and their cult, and apparently repudiated because of it, could not mean the whole (male population of) society. The specifi c features of the da ē va cult, such as the (imputed) ‘cruel’ treatment of the sacrifi cial victim or the consumption of ‘intoxicants’, and generally its characterization as ‘fury’ ( a ē šə ma- ) and its stated purpose (or pretension) of attaining immortality (cf. Y 48.1, but also the description in Y 32.10a′b 113 ) make it very likely that we are dealing with a specifi c type of rite. 114 In fact, as we will see later, the da ē va cult was a noctur-nal sacrifi ce. This type of rite was anomalous among Indo-European festivals and rites; or more precisely, it was dedicated to the realm of the dead and the passage to the beyond. The Zoroastrian ‘profession of faith’ (Y 12, Yt 13.89) preserves the funda-mental importance of the turn against the da ē va cult for the new doctrine. 115 In Yt 13.89 Zarathu š tra’s frauuar ā n ē is prefaced with y ō paoirii ō st ō i š astuuai θ ii å staot a ṣ̌ə m n ā ist da ē uu ō ‘who among beings possessed of bone fi rst praised a ṣ̌ a and reviled the da ē vas ’. The double gesture defi nes the threshold of the religion. Praising a ṣ̌ a requires reviling the da ē vas . The faithful in frauuar ā n ē (Y 12.1) repeats Zarathu š tra’s founding gesture: to practise the cult and doc-trine of Ahura Mazd ā in the manner of Zarathu š tra is to be v ī da ē uu ō ‘reject-ing the da ē vas ’. As Benveniste ( 1970 , pp. 41–42) points out, the adjective is shorthand for the formula (Y 12.6) da ē uu ā i š sar ə m v ī mruii ē ‘I renounce the company of the da ē vas ’ or ‘I renounce all association with the da ē vas ’. The expression points to the da ē va cult and its basic conception as the company of the da ē vas and their worshippers. In effect, the formula says: I do not take part in the cult of the da ē vas . This must have been its original meaning. ‘Il faut remonter à la pr é dication des G ā th ā s (e.g., Y 49.3 – A.

Lommel’s interpretation of mahm ī man ō i is unlikely: ‘Es ist, wie ich glaube, ein Ausdruck daf ü r, da ß die prophetische Schau dieser ersten Strophen ein Phantasiest ü ck ist’ ( 1971 , p. 63). It is not clear to me from his translation whether he thinks that the da ē vas are the sole subject of the direct speech: ‘Nach seinen, des Weisen Herrn, Freuden begehrte der Sippengenosse und auch seinen (Freuden) die Dorfgemeinschaft nebst dem Gastfreund, nach seinen (Freuden begehrte) die G ö tter, so denke ich mir (und sprachen): Deine Boten wollen wir sein, um die abzuhalten, welche euch befeinden’ ( 1971 , p. 60).

Varun \u000f a ‘resides in and watches over the Cosmic Order ( R \u0003 t á ), which is said to be “fi xed and hidden where they unharness the horses of the sun”’ (Kuiper 1964 , p. 107). It is, however, another thing to limit the bliss promised to the a ṣ̌ avan to a mystical vision of the ‘sun in the rock’. ‘Just as Mitra and Varun \u000f a, as lords of the cosmic mystery, knew the secret of “the sun in the rock” and were, therefore, “sun-seers”, so, with the transfer of the epithet from the lord to his domain, Ahura Mazd ā ’s x š a θ ra- is called “sun-seeing” in the Gathas’ (Kuiper 1964 , p. 120). But this supposed trans-fer is hardly meaningful: a ‘domain’ cannot have a mystical vision of ‘the sun in the rock’. 25 Compare Y 49.8: ‘Make the most joyful union with a ṣ̌ a happen for Fra ṣ̌ ao š tra and me in your divine kingdom for ever – this I ask you, O Mazd ā Ahura!

As far as Zoroaster was concerned, the mean-ing of da ē va- remained the same: he condemned all of them... for the very reason they were the gods of polytheism... As Gershevitch rightly points out, they existed as “thoughts, conceived by erroneously thinking men”... Therefore the semantic development of Iranian daivas from “gods” to “demons” still holds good. It gets its origin from Zoroaster’s condemnation of all the gods, manifestation of evil thinking ( Y . 32, 3) or “Hirngespinste”, as Gershevitch writes’.

How is ‘as (also) the enactments of malice’ related to the rest of the sentence? Does it describe the effect of ‘the duplicitous things’? What is the syntactic function of hiiat  ? 54 Insler ( 1975 , p. 91), Kellens and Pirart ( 1988 , p. 168) and Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 176) read hiiat as an adverb of time (‘when’); hence, in their view, 48.1b describes a period or an event, accompanying or providing the context of the action that unfolds in 48.1aa′. Kellens and Pirart do not translate ą sa š ut ā . Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 2, p. 196) interprets it as the loc. sing. of a hapax ą sa- š\u000b uiti- ‘setting in motion [apportionment] of the (due) share’, admitting the excessive syllable. However, the convergence of two considerations, namely, the regular insertion of a glide between sibilants and the metric excess of the p ā da, makes Humbach’s interpret-ation of the form unlikely. Insler thinks that hiiat ‘can only refer back to * ā d in the sense of “after this present time which...”’ (Insler 1975 , p. 285). Thus he translates ad ā i š ... hiiat * ą s š\u000b ut ā ‘during the times after this (present) one which is under the workings of evil’, taking the instrumental o ā i š as indicating an extension of time. Insler seems to make hiiat perform two functions at the same time: time adverb and relative pronoun. 55 Kellens and Pirart ( 1990 , p. 313) translate ‘opulence’; Lommel ( 1971 , p. 97, p. 149) translates ‘Heil’ and, occasionally, ‘Vorteil’ or ‘Nutzen’, but without making an distinction between the two G ā thic words; Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, e.g. p. 176), ‘benefi t’; Insler ( 1975 , e.g. p. 35), ‘salvation’. 56 See Wackernagel and Debrunner ( 1954 , pp. 219–35). The verbal sense that the Avestan stems in ah , Sanskrit as , can have is especially clear in the case of their use in the bahuvr ī hi compounds such as hu-manah ‘well-minded’ or du š -manah ‘ill-minded’, etc. 57 The appearance of sauuah- in the plural in Y 28.9 x š a θ r ə mc ā sauua ŋ h ą m ‘and power over vitalizations’ does not create any problem for the interpretation pro-posed here.

Why ‘despite’, since the gods themselves ‘order’ the actions? Is conformity with ‘Good Mind’, etc., a value for the da ē vas , in which case alone the ‘despite’ utterance would have any sense? One must admit, given Gershevitch’s enthusiastic ‘defense’ of the monotheism of the G ā th ā s, that these stanzas stage a burlesque play: the ‘prophet’ apostrophizes the ‘gods’ that do not exist and accuses them of ‘ordering’ actions that lead to men’s loss of life, for which the gods are held responsible. 65 See Ahmadi 2014a . 66 Although I follow Hintze’s analysis of the syntax in the main, the translated text is mine. 67 Insler’s translation of the 4a–c′ is, however, both syntactically and conceptually confused.

Nothing in the Avestan text warrants this provision. 6 8 sao š iian \u000f t ą m xratauu ō in Y 46.3 is ‘the vitalizer’s mental capacity to achieve the desired or appointed end’ (in the plural).

Yima’s ‘power’ is divine not just because it is demiurgic but also by virtue of its capacity to make the living immortal, to make the living coin-cide with its concept, as it were.

To make a case for auto-deception, however, is a tall order, which Insler certainly does not make. In his translated text, the ultimate culprit is ‘evil thinking’. aka- or an \u000f gra- mainiiu- seems to be coeval with Mazd ā (Y 30.3–5). The da ē vas are deceived by an \u000f gra- mainiiu- (Insler 1975 , p. 33). The suggestion that at issue is a ‘moral’ failure (‘evil thinking’) is specious.

But OAv. ξ ci š ‘allocate’ does not take the accusative of person. 87 See Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 119: ‘parce que le mauvais é tat d’esprit et le (mau-vais) acts (rituel), à cause de la mauvaise Pens é e et de la mauvaise parole, (ont fait) de vous les (mauvais) dieux’.

In his lectures at the Coll è ge de France 2011/2012, Kellens translates the stanza: ‘Quel est votre pouvoir?

The initial fricative would mean that the term spread from Scythian to other Iranian languages. Did it not already exist in these languages? Despite historico-linguistic diffi culties (see Hintze 2007b , 179–80), the phraseo-logical similarities in the Vedic and Avestan passages where the word occurs is overwhelming. ‘The formula r ā y ā par ī n \u000f as ā is no doubt identical with the Avestan formula ( ahe/mana/ åŋ h ą m ) raiia x v ar ə na ŋ haca and goes back to Indo-Iranian times’ (Lubotsky 2002 , p. 193). If Lubotsky’s hypothesis is accepted, 51.18aa′ would become: ‘J ā m ā spa Hauguva chooses dominions (and) this conception of control’. See also Kellens 2012 , pp. 480–81, in which he suggests that the word may represent ‘la transfi guration divine de l’aliment sacrifi ciel’. 95 The term gaiia- ‘life’ seems to be used in the OAv. texts to designate (primal) mental existence, which is subsequently embodied, astuuan \u000f t- ‘possessed of bone’, and upon death returns to the mental state. In Y 41.3 it is set in a complementary position to ast ə n \u000f t ā t- ‘boney state’. In Y 30.4 it is opposed to ajii ā ti - ‘non-life’, both coming into existence ‘in the beginnings’ as the result of the confrontation of the two creative ‘intuitions’. It is thus positively marked as such, and, if one is permitted to see the opposed terms in the light of the cosmogony attested in the later sources, ‘life’ and ‘non-life’ refer to the underlying ‘mental’ existence, i.e. life in all its three phases. In other words, gaiia - is the (mental) life that was originally constituted by Mazd ā and to which one may return upon death by way of good thinking. By contrast, ajii ā ti- is the vitiated mental state. The sense of (desirable) mental existence seems appropriate in Y 51.19. 96 See Kellens 1995 , pp. 30ff. 97 Compare Lommel 1968 , pp. 127–29. 98 See Blumenberg 1983 . What humans accomplish through their work of/on myth is the ‘reduction of the absolutism of reality’ (Blumenberg 1983 , p. 7). ‘Precisely to transform the original emotional tension of a “savage terror” into distance, to elaborate it as something concretely perceptible, is part of the function of rites and of myth’ (Blumenberg 1983 , p. 62). ‘Signifi cance is generated not only by intensifi cation but also by power depletion. By intensifi cation, as a supplement to positive facts, to naked data... by power depletion as the moderation of some-thing intolerable... Signifi cance also arises as a result of the representation of the relationship between the resistance that reality opposes to life and the summoning up of energy that enables one to measure up to it’ (Blumenberg 1983 , p. 75).

They see that a ṣ̌ ā vohū mana ŋ h ā cannot be taken as the instrumental of means where ‘power’ and ‘control’ are invoked pre-cisely as the means of protection. The automatic translation of the two ‘entities’ in the instrumental as the means is grounded in the lack of conceptual clarity. 105 See Kellens 1994a , p. 53. 106 See Ahmadi 2014a . 107 Compare Detienne 1963 , p. 43–46, pp. 73–85 and Bremmer 1983 , pp. 70–82. 108 See AW , col. 538 and EWA , vol. 1, p. 409. It could have originally been a descrip-tive term, e.g. for a characteristic ritual gesture or function. Mayrhofer is sceptical of relating xrafstra- to Vedic krap ‘jammern, fl ehen, traurig sein, sich sehnen’ ( EWA , vol. 1, p. 409), meaning something like ‘j ä mmerlich’, since the Young Avestan usage does not bear out this meaning. But this is not an adequate ground for dismissing the relation. It could have developed its hateful sense precisely as a result of its formulaic association with the word da ē va . Moreover, Vedic krap does not just mean ‘wail, lament’ but also ‘supplicate, yearn’. We know that the ‘ da ē vas and the men’ yearn for the bliss of Mazd ā , for the divine sphere. In Y 28.5, xrafstr ā could either be an instrumental qualifying hizū - ‘tongue’ (cf. Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 106) or a vocative plural (so Humbach 1991 , vol. 1, p. 118) prob-ably referring to the da ē vas . In neither case, however, does it necessarily have the meaning ‘fi erce’ (Humbach) or ‘affreuse’ (Kellens and Pirart).

Hoffmann and Forssman ( 2004 , p. 184) maintain that it is rather a reduplicated present from ξ var ‘choose’. De Vaan ( 2003 , p. 378) points out that the ‘long reduplication can only be explained from a laryngeal-initial root’, thus from ξ var ‘enclose’ < * H uˆ ar . He further makes the point that, since there is already a nasal present from the root in Avestan, it is more likely that v ā ura- is a perfect stem. In this case, however, the secondary middle ending would be anomalous. It is perhaps best to interpret it as a reduplicated present from ξ 1 var . The specifi cally ritual usage and sense in which Kellens understands the verb is based on his theory of ritual triage. In view of Y 33.5, one should probably read s ə rao šə m... mazi š t ə m together, the direct object of v ā ur ō imaid ī . an ā m ą θ r ā may refer to the following stanza, Y 28.6. va ē d ə mn ō governs the coordi-nated manasc ā vohū and g ā tū mc ā ahur ā i . s ə uui š t ā i... mazd ā i is the dative comple-ment of v ā ur ō imaid ī , the benefi ciary of the action. Y 28.5 can thus be translated: ‘when will I see you, O a ṣ̌ a , having found good thinking and the way to Ahura? With this formula (spoken) with the tongue (i.e. audibly), which is xrafstra- , we embrace the greatest hearing in honor of Mazd ā , the most vitalizing one’.

Bailey ( 1970 , pp. 25–30) main-tains that the adjective means something like ‘biting’ or ‘stinging’, later defi ning a category of animals, e.g. in the D ē nkard . But neither the formal analysis (Bailey 1970 , p. 27) nor making the later (Pahlavi) usage the basis of the earlier (G ā thic) meaning is convincing. I fi nd Insler’s translation of Y 28.5b′–c′ incoherent: ‘With a fi erce tongue we would turn the greatest obedience to the most powerful Lord through the following prayer’ (Insler 1975 , p. 25). What is the ‘fi erce tongue’ doing in a prayer to the supreme god? Humbach ( 1991 , vol. 1, p. 118) has: ‘Through this formula we would receive the Greatest One, O you evil beasts, with (our) tongue’. The address would make sense (in view of 28.6 dar ə g ā iiū ... aoj ō ŋ huuat raf ə n ō ... y ā daibi š uuat ō duua ē šå tauruuaii ā ma ) if made to the da ē vas . In any case, the meaning of xrafstra- remains obscure. Nonetheless, if one allows a connec-tion with Vedic ξ krap ‘jammern’, formal diffi culties aside, the imaginable ritual function of facilitating the passage to the beyond and its being related to the funerary gesture of wailing are reminiscent of the semantics of the archaic Greek go ē s .

Compare Y 46.10 where the poet describes himself as one who wishes to rally people to the vahma- of the gods. 110 See, for example, Boyce 1982 on the role of the (diaspora) magi. 111 See Clastres 1989 , pp. 189–218. 112 Compare, for example, Parpola 2002 , p. 61: ‘Among the singer families of the R \u0003 gveda, it is especially the K ā n \u000f vas and the Atris – and the Vasis \u000f t \f has of the 7 th book, whose special deity is Varun \u000f a, also mentioned in the Mitanni treaty – that worship the A ś vins’. In ancient Mesopotamia, jurisdictions and cultic rights of the gods were defi ned in reference to the city boundaries, but also on certain occasions had to do with their functions. See Bott é ro 2001 . In Egypt, after the unifi cation of Lower and Upper Egypt, social function was the important basis of elective relationship with the tutelary god, but cult was still very much local-ized. See Assmann 2003 , pp. 121ff, pp. 204ff. In archaic and classical Greece, gen-der was an important factor of differentiation in the cult, but special rites with appropriate deities existed for important activities or events, e.g. war, childbirth or tribal initiation. See Burkert 1987 . 113 See my discussion in the fi nal part. 114 Cantera ( 2012 , pp. 226–27) sees in the arrangement of the G ā th ā s and the YH in the yasna ritual indications of the eschatologico-ecstatic structure of the ‘original’ rite that involved animal sacrifi ce: ‘The ritual represents a journey. It starts with the slaughtering of the cow, after the Ahunauuait ī G ā θ ā and before the YH , and with the identifi cation of the victim’s offered meat with the body of the sacrifi cer ( Y. 37.3), and it ends with the union of the sacrifi cer’s soul with his vision-soul in the nuptial hymn of Y . 53’ (Cantera 2012 , p. 227). Kellens and Swennen ( 2005 ) have a similar opinion; otherwise, Panaino 2004 , pp. 51–75. 115 See Benveniste 1970 , pp. 37–42.

"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":" pageThis intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":" Part III Preamble The G ā thic passages devoted to the da ē vas give us limited but fairly clear information about the character of these ancient Iranian gods. Uncertainty may remain, however, about the signifi cance of their cult that our analysis of the G ā th ā s has suggested. Comparative material can help reduce this uncertainty to some extent. Inevitably, the available sources decide the type of questions we can ask. Aside from Iranian evidence, there are, of course, classical and Hellenistic Greek sources. As it happens, the most directly useful are concerned with ritual. This is not a bad thing. A foreign observer is more prone to error and misconception in understanding abstract ideas than those associated with stereotyped actions, especially actions tied to familiar or typical situations, the intended purposes of which can be stated more or less simply. It seems reasonable to assume that the Greeks acquired their knowledge of Iranian religious doctrines in good part from questioning the meaning of the magi’s ritual lore. The Greek representation of Iranian religious thought, however, often distorts its subject matter and is fragmentary, especially before the classical period. In treating it as a source, we thus have to be willing to resort to argumentation and imagination in a more basic way than, for example, the exposition of a doctrine would require. Nonetheless one can reasonably rely on the cumulative weight of the converging evidence in Greek literature about the magi’s lore, which sets limits to the fi eld where an acceptable interpretation of the magi’s doctrines may be sought. Along the way, we analyse and eliminate competing interpretations of the relevant data. The person who takes part in a rite has a motive for doing so, which, how-ever idiosyncratic it may be in some respects, draws on and hence expresses a certain tradition. An invented myth is oxymoronic; just as, on the other hand, the notion of a pristine myth is artifi cial. 1 Ritual and myth interact, and carry a meaning for the actor, whether or not this meaning is deemed illusory by the external observer. Kirk rightly points out ‘that no ritual, for all practical purposes, is performed without some kind of underlying motive and belief... Either the ritual is related to current needs and interests, or it is interpreted as explaining something about the traditional past itself ’ (Kirk 1981 , p. 55). Ritual recalls an immemorial past, be it implicitly, and relies on a tradition"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"204 Part III: Preambleor traditions, for which it claims the authority of the founding beginnings. Nonetheless, traditions are not static, and foreign traditions are adopted and adapted, and become native. 2 The more marginal or innovative a ritual trad-ition, the more its adherents must be conscious of its supposed raison d’ ê tre. 3 They adhere to it because it carries a ‘meaning’ for them, which immediately resonates with their way of acting and thinking 4 and is partly refl ected in the transformations they effect in related myths. 5 Myth ‘stamps’ a whole range of situations with a defi nite and communicable signifi cance. The gods are not so much objects of inward faith as participants in a comprehensive programme of life. 6 The calendar of festivals is the most signifi cant manifestation of this programme. 7 In this perspective, a ritual–myth complex articulates a way of relating to the world – in certain respects. 8 Both in composition and intention a ritual is manifold, but synchronically one may presume it embodies a sense, brought to light by the analysis of its features in, e.g. a comparative context. The mystery cults comprise a ‘family’ that carried in the Greek eyes defi nite features and meaning, in particular securing a happier afterlife through initiation. 9 If late archaic and classical Greeks consistently assimilated the magi’s rite to the mystic initiation, one can at least suppose that they perceived signifi cant similarities between the two. The extant Greek testimonies about the magi’s lore – fragmentary and at times elusive but nonetheless informative – give support to our suppos-ition. Scepticism regarding the Greek refl ection of other cultures (of ‘alien wisdom’ 10 ) is to some extent justifi ed, but perhaps one looks for the wrong thing in the wrong place. 11 We should expect that, just as the highest Iranian sky god in Herodotus is ‘Zeus’, 12 so too will Iranian ritual lore have been assimilated to a Greek type. In both cases, the operation is bound to produce misunderstanding, and obviously, the more complex the ‘alien’ idea the more distortion there will be in its interpretatio graeca . Nevertheless, the distorted picture is not arbitrary. The question is how to understand and benefi t from this non-arbitrariness. Admittedly, what will follow is an essay, an attempt to shed the light of an available suggestive source on the magi’s traditions and, ultimately, on the character of the da ē vas . The connection made in Greek sources dating from the end of the sixth century onwards between the magi’s practice and the myst ē ria has been ignored for the most part by students of Zoroastrianism. I will argue against the current view of the relation between the mageia and ‘magic’ in Hellenistic wisdom. The borrowed name does not merely refl ect cultural hostility availing itself of a ready abusive term based in national enmity, or the magician’s desire to give his craft the semblance of an exotic wisdom. 13 The adoption of the name must be viewed against the background of the assimilation of the magos to the ‘divine man’ and other terms from this semantic fi eld. In an important sense, the Greek Zoroaster is an Orpheus. The philosophical disparagement of the mageia applied to the whole ideology of mystic initiation as a doctrine of salvation, with which philosophy apparently competed (Plato, Phaedo 66d–70c)."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Part III: Preamble 205 Notes 1 Compare Vernant 1990 , pp. 211–15. See Vernant 1990 , 226–60 and Graf 1993 , pp. 35–56 for short accounts of the approaches to myth and ritual in the twentieth century. According to the so-called myth-and-ritual theory, particular myths account for the origins of the rites associated with them, or else are the specifi c stories behind the rites. See Versnel 1993 , pp. 20–48. According to Versnel, there are rituals without a myth and myths without a ritual. But if myth is generally understood as a mode of intelligibility, a way of organizing human experience in its most vital moments and basic architecture (see Vernant 1990 , pp. 224–26), there can hardly be an important ritual without a myth, that is to say, a traditional tale with a signifi cance generalized across a culture. Compare Burkert 1979 , pp. 1–58. Burkert programmatically reduces associated pairs of myth and ritual to common origins. ‘“Myth” means telling a tale with suspended reference, structured by some basically human action pattern; ritual is stereotyped action redirected for demonstration. Thus both are dependent on action programs, both are detached from pragmatic reality, both serve communi-cation’ (Burkert 1979 , p. 57). For the meaning of ‘displacement from the pragmatic context’ see Burkert 1987 , pp. 154–55. The ‘question “Where from?” remains a legit-imate or even necessary complement to functional and structural interpretations’ (Burkert 1987 , p. 160). But genetic explanations of myth and ritual are always contro-versial. Vernant ( 1990 , pp. 183–202) rejects the idea that behind the symbolic action of Prometheus at Mekone in Hesiod are Palaeolithic hunting customs. Smith ( 1987 , p. 196ff.) questions, more generally, the idea that hunting lies at the origins of sacri-fi ce on the grounds that every attested sacrifi ce is that of a domesticated animal and belongs to a pastoralist or agrarian society. In Creation of the Sacred , Burkert ( 1996 ) places sacrifi ce and more generally religion squarely in an evolutionary perspective. Sacrifi ce is the demonstrative transposition of the survival strategy of ransoming a valuable possession or part in the face of a predator. The same fundamental anxiety (of survival) is addressed in both situations. 2 Compare Parker 2005 , pp. 375–76 on Attic festivals: ‘The festival cycle was rooted in a belief in that special time [of myths]. Almost all festivals were held to have their origin then or to commemorate occurrences during it. The details of that origin or of the occurrence commemorated mattered less than the belief that the festival did indeed derive its power and legitimacy from the special time’. On the other hand, ‘a whole succession of Attic festivals acquired new myths of origin during the fi fth or fourth centuries... poets and other men of words were free to suggest improvements and new connections. What they could not do was to cut the umbilical cord linking the festival to the “generation of heroes”’. See also Assmann 2006 , pp. 122–38. 3 See Turcan’s remarks on the cult of Mithras in Turcan 1981 . 4 See Wittgenstein 1969 , §204: ‘Die Begr ü ndung aber, die Rechtfertigung der Evidenz kommt zu eindem Ende; – das Ende aber ist nicht da ß uns gewisse S ä tze unmittelbar als wahr einleuchten, also eine Art Sehen unsrerseits, sondern unser Handeln , welches am Grunde des Sprachspiels liegt. (Giving grounds, however, justifying the evidence, comes to an end; – but the end is not certain propositions’ striking us immediately as true, i.e., it is not a kind of seeing on our part; it is our acting , which lies at the bottom of the language-game.)’ Compare Wittgenstein 2001 , §217, §325: ‘Was die Menschen als Rechtfertigung gelten lassen – zeigt, wie sie denken und leben. (What people accept as a justifi cation – shews how they think and live)’; and §326: ‘Wir erwarten dies und werden von dem ü berrascht; aber die Kette der Gr ü nde hat ein Ende. (We expect this , and are surprised at that . But the chain of reasons has an end.)’ 5 See Blumenberg 1983 , pp. 59–112, pp. 215–62. One aspect of the ‘work on myth’ is the transformation of myth, such as the one we must assume for the Orphic Dionysus. See Graf and Johnston 2007 , pp. 66–93."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"206 Part III: Preamble 6 This, of course, does not mean that the Greeks did not ‘believe in’ their gods. Inward faith, a rather modern (Protestant) phenomenon (if we are to accept Hegel’s picture), is rarefi ed and even alienated from the world. Compare Versnel 2011 , pp. 539–59; Parker 2005 , pp. 378–79. 7 See Burkert 1985 , pp. 225–27. The local particularism of both the calendars and the cults shows the communal embeddedness of the Greek gods. Compare Vernant 1990 , p. 224. 8 See Versnel 1993 , pp. 48–88. 9 Compare Seaford 1986 , p. 12; Sfameni Gasparro 1985 , pp. 1–19. 10 See Momigliano 1975 . 11 See Vasunia 2007 , pp. 251–52. 12 See De Jong 1997 , 96–98. I wonder if this Zeus is not Mi θ ra rather than Ahura Mazd ā . On the Greeks’ appropriation of foreign religious lore (e.g. the cult of the Phrygian Kybele), compare Sfemani Gasparro 1985 , pp. 9–25. 13 To judge from the Greek Magical Papyri, ‘magic’ as a term of self-description is not the most popular; nor is it uniformly used by the various genres contained in the collection. Rather, it is used at the most refl ective level (Betz 1982 , p. 163: ‘the most ambitious level of magical literature in the strictest sense of the terms’) where philosophical speculation about the nature and purpose of magic is rife. ‘It is at this higher cultural level in the PGM that we fi nd the terms mageia (“magic”), magikos (“magical”), and magos (“magician”) as designations of magic as a whole. But in other sections other terms are used’ (Betz 1982 , p. 164). Works cited Assmann , J 2006 , Religion and Cultural Memory , Stanford University Press , Stanford, CA .

Unfortunately, the G ā th ā s are not forthcoming in this respect. The passages that might be interpreted as pointing to a nocturnal nature for the da ē va cult can as well be understood otherwise. Y 32.10 y ə̄ aci š t ə m va ē na ŋ\u000b h ē aog ə d ā g ą m a š ibii ā huuar ə c ā ‘who utters the worst things in order to see with his two eyes the sun and the cow’ does not necessarily indicate that the deprecated rite takes place at night. The phrase ‘to see the sun and the cow’ could be an eschatological trope. 1 Beyond this, as I discussed earlier, there are the somewhat cryptic Y 44.20 y ō i pi š iiein \u0004 t ī and 50.2 pouru š ū huuar ə̄ pi š iiasū , probably meaning something like ‘who face the sun’, etc. Here too, the implication of a nocturnal rite is far from certain. In Y 44.20 the ‘sun-greeters’ are denied the ‘cow’, which they, along with the cult offi cials, subject to the a ē šə ma . ‘Facing the sun’ seems to describe a signifi cant idea or a gesture, perhaps expressing an essential element of the doctrine of the cult. It is of course possible, generally speaking, that the description (understood as ‘greeting the sun’) merely points to the nocturnal nature of the rite. Nonetheless, I do not think that ‘facing the sun’ is a temporal trope. The ‘sun-greeters’ appear in both contexts with the ‘cow’, which almost certainly carries eschatological expectations. Those who face the sun also seek the cow (see my discussion of Y 44.20). In other words, ‘facing the sun (and wanting the cow)’ seems to belong with ‘seeing the sun and the cow with his eyes’, perhaps the poet’s manipulation of this latter phrase. 2 The original phrase, then, must be a self-description of the worshippers of the da ē vas , signifying their eschatological hopes. The later negative connotation of a š i- ‘eye’ may well be a result of the poet’s insertion and revaluation of the original phrase in his own discourse. It is therefore safe to say that we do not fi nd any direct reference to the nocturnal nature of the da ē va cult in the G ā th ā s. There is, however, one passage from the G ā th ā s that seems to associate the da ē vas with the night. It is Y 34.9, where certain unnamed undesirable elements are described with two adjectives xrafstra- and auruna- . The context makes it clear that the underlying noun is da ē uua- . 3 Swennen ( 2003 ) has shown that the second adjective is the cognate of Vedic arun \u0004 á - meaning ‘red’. On the other hand, whatever the term literally means in G ā thic, the meaning of the"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"210 Chthonic features of the daēva cultepithet goes beyond its etymological chromatic sense. In Vedic the feminine form of the adjective arun \u0004 ī - is exclusively used of the goddess Dawn ( us \u0004 á s- ). Based on this usage, designating the red colour of the dawn, the adjective ‘en vient à d é signer Us \u0004 as elle-m ê me, puis toute la p é riode de temps que celle-ci repr é sente’ (Swennen 2003 , p. 87), that is to say, the crepuscular periods. The secondary signifi cance of the adjective to refer to crepuscular phenomena is clear in its usage in relation to the nocturnal wolf (Swennen 2003 , p. 88) and the sacred drink soma (Swennen 2003 , pp. 89–90), even if in this case the twigs of the plant, its fl ower, or its juice may be reddish. The G ā thic dichotomiza-tion of the Indo-Iranian cosmology into the absolute opposition between the realms of light and darkness inevitably relegated the crepuscular phenomena, which presumably had a sui generis signifi cance, to the nocturnal sphere. The epithet auruna- used of the da ē vas , which must be traditional, places their cult in the dark of night close to or bordered by the twilight period(s). 4 The famous passage from the A \u0007 b ā n Ya š t (Yt 5.94) prima facie justifi es thinking that the da ē vas received their worship at night: ar ə duui sūre an ā hite k ə m i δ a t ē zao θ r å bauuain \u0004 ti yas ə tauua frabar ə n \u0004 te druuan \u0004 t ō da ē uuaiiasn åŋ h ō pasca hū fr ā š m ō .d ā it ī m ‘A r d v ī Sūr ā An ā hit ā , what becomes of the libations that drugvan \u0004 t worshippers of the da ē vas offer you after sunset?’ If we take this text at face value, it shows not only that the da ē va cult takes place in the dark of night but also that the worshippers of the da ē vas offer libations to a Zoroastrian deity. The goddess does not count herself among the da ē vas , though, since in 5.95 she replies that it is the da ē vas and not her that receive the libations offered after sunset. The conclusion Kellens ( 1994 , p. 86) draws from this constellation is strange: ‘Ce texte int é ressant atteste qu’ à l’ é poque o ù il fut r é dig é , les da ē uuas é taient la r é f é rence oblig é e de toute r é probation religieuse, f û t-elle inspir é e par le plus mince particularisme’. The worship-pers in question, too, are Mazdaean, according to Kellens, and their cult of the da ē vas is only a maliciously intolerant accusation. But this interpret-ation covers over the text. The term of reprobation is drugvan \u0004 t , ‘the follower of druj ’; da ē uuaiiasna- ‘worshipper of da ē va ’ must be primarily descriptive, however pejoratively understood in the context. 5 Further, there is no question that in the YAv. texts, and even in Pahlavi texts, 6 the two da ē uuaiiasna- and mazdaiiasna- are understood to be mutually exclusive (cf. V 7.36) precisely insofar as they describe two different types of da ē n ā ( da ē n ā - ). 7 It is this recip-rocal exclusion that ultimately explains the vilifi cation da ē uuaiiasna- incurs. That da ē va -worshippers make offering to a goddess who does not count her-self among them shows that the term da ē va has a restrictive sense for those who practise the cult, and that, in all likelihood, the nomenclature signifi es a particular group of divine beings. I do not see any reason why one should discount this evidence of the nocturnal nature of the da ē va cult. Of course, the text does not imply that the ritual is an occurrence that takes place every night, but only that the da ē va cult is nocturnal, that this is a characteristic of the cult, and that it signifi cantly distinguishes the cult from other type(s) of sacrifi ce."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Chthonic features of the daēva cult 211 The videvdad sade rite takes place at night. The ceremony receives its name from the text called V ī d ē vd ā d, the ‘law of the abjuration of the da ē vas ’, 8 whose chapters are inserted into the texts of the visperad service. No ritual gesture accompanies the nocturnal recitation. The service stands out in these respects among the Zoroastrian priestly rituals. 9 The fact that the rite is cel-ebrated at night must be related, as the title of the recited text makes clear, to the nocturnal nature of the da ē vas . 10 The N ē rangest ā n also associates the da ē vas with the night and darkness. In a chapter on the Ebsrusrim G ā h (the period from the appearance of stars to midnight), the Pahlavi commentator says that the ritual worship, performed by a single man, may continue into the night but only in the company of fi re, otherwise it would be an act of the da ē va cult. Ka yazi š n ē w-t ā g kun ē d p ē š -r ō z ud š ab baw ē d ā tax š pad nig ē ri š n sar fr ā z kun ē d d ē w- ē zag ī h ī tan ā puhlag ā n ‘if one performs a rite of worship by himself (having started) the previous day and (in the meantime) it will have become night, (and) he deliberately lets the fi re go out, (then the rite would be) an act of the da ē va cult of the damned’ (N 33.5). 11 The blazing fi re is obvi-ously the condition of the concession made to the solitary worshipper. 12 In N 50.5 a quoted Avestan text states that the da ē vas ‘lick’ (*ra ē zaite ) the liba-tion that is spilled ‘in the dark of dusk’ (* upa.naxturu š u *t ą θ ra ē š u ). Another Avestan text, although corrupt, clearly teaches that the libation poured in the dark will not reach the (unspecifi ed) god: m ē za ō θ r å *yein \u0004 te (*an \u0004 tar ə ) ra ō cahe n ō it an \u0004 tar ə t ə mahe ‘the libations (poured) in the light of day come to me, not (those poured) in the dark’ (N 50.3). 13 The da ē vas are fundamentally nocturnal and associated with darkness. In De Iside et Oriside , Plutarch gives a short description of apotropaic gloomy offerings ( apotr ó paia ka ì skythr ō p á ) made to Ahriman, which, he says, are prescribed by Zoroaster. The proceedings take place in the dark. ‘He taught that votive- and thank-offerings should be made to Horomazes, but gloomy offerings to Areimanius, and those intended to avert evil. For they pound a certain herb called om ō mi in a mortar, invoking Hades and darkness, and then after mixing with it the blood of a slain wolf, they take it out to a sunless spot and throw it away’ (Plutarch, De Iside et Oriside 46). 14 Zaehner ( 1972 , pp. 13–16) sees in this text a real description of the ritual of ‘devil-worshippers’, similar to a ‘black Mass’. He characteristically fi nds for the lugubrious sacrifi ce a ‘suggestive’ parallel in Christian lore, which should, in his estimation, make the procedure intelligible. ‘These devil-worshippers are identical with the “sorcerers” of the D ē nkart who did not believe in rewards and punishments and worshipped the demons’ (Zaehner 1972 , p. 14). The ‘religion’ ( d ē n ) of ‘demon-worshippers’ ( d ē v ā sn ) is identical, according to Zaehner, with the ‘religion of sorcerers’ (Zaehner 1972 , p. 15). The idea of a sorcerers’ religion is taxing enough, but that mortal antagonism to a ‘pro-scribed sect’ of sorcerers should become one of the founding aspects (if not the founding moment) of a bona fi de religion, i.e. mazd ē sn , is simply reck-less. 15 Nor, indeed, does one fi nd any basis for the alleged identifi cation in the D ē nkard , which typically sees sorcery behind the supposed attraction of the"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"212 Chthonic features of the daēva cult d ē v ā sn (see the quoted Pahlavi texts in Zaehner 1972 , pp. 30–31). The unright-eous rite of the sorcerer that serves the da ē vas is obviously quite different from a ‘religion’ of sorcerers. In any event, at issue in Plutarch’s account is not a separate religion but a specifi c rite, apparently performed by the Zoroastrian magi. Puzzlingly, the reported text also states that it is Zoroaster himself who has prescribed the ‘gloomy offerings’. This could simply mean, of course, that making such offerings is a practice of the magi, who consider themselves follow-ers of Zoroaster. De Jong ( 1997 , p. 179) maintains that Plutarch’s source for his description of the ‘da ē vic ritual’ must have been ‘Zoroastrian polem-ics against a nonexistent group of devil-worshippers’. Are these the source, too, for his making Zoroaster the author of the apotropaic prescription? Impossible. 16 Boyce and Grenet ( 1991 , pp. 168–71) suggest relating Plutarch’s ‘gloomy offerings’ to the ritual burial of pots mouth downward discovered in the areas of the Late Bronze Age Andronovo culture in the steppes, e.g. Sinta š ta, and in the precincts of a temple in the Greek Bactria. These burials seem to indicate chthonic rituals. Dark or sunless spots where, according to Plutarch, the libation is poured, are typically associated with the da ē vas , e.g. in the form of the ‘cave’. In V 3.7 the dwelling of the da ē vas is described as the ‘cave of druj ’ ( druj ō g ə r ə δ a- ). Still, the apotropaic procedure in De Iside et Oriside 46 may look somewhat artifi cial and rouse the suspicion that it is put together to correspond to the perceived dualism of Zoroastrianism. If the good god’s evil rival is independently powerful (cf. Plutarch, De Iside et Oriside 45), then ‘wisdom’ bids one come to terms with the dark power by appropriate means. 17 For Plutarch, the measures taken had to include the strange chthonic mixture, whether or not there was any evidence for it, just as (for Hermodorus) the magi’s procedure had to come from Zoroaster since he was their authority. Nonetheless, Plutarch could have merely interpreted the ritual as apotro-paic in accordance with his own dualistic cosmology, and the description of the chthonic rite may well be authentic. The lugubrious libation contain-ing the blood of a slain wolf may not be so strange after all. 18 An Avestan text in the N ē rangest ā n seems to attest to wolf sacrifi ce: ratufri š v ə hrkaii ā k ə hrpaca paiia ŋ haca ha δ ō v ī span ą mca da ē uuaiiasn ą m tanu.p ə r ə θ an ą mca ha θ ra bao δ a ŋ ha *frauruua ē saii å ‘One satisfi es the ratu with both the milk and the body of a wolf, like (those) of the da ē va -worshippers and of the damned, with (or at the instant of) the perception of the forward-turn (?)’ (N 41.3). 19 The Pahlavi commentator apparently misunderstood the obscure description that closes the Avestan statement.

Kotwal and Kreyenbroek suggest that it has to do with the offering of a ‘bad’ creature, ‘whose “defeat” is symbolized by cutting off part of its tail’ and once this is done ‘it is acceptable to the Yazads’ (Kotwal and Kreyenbroek 2003 , p. 181 n. 712). This explanation is unlikely. If the creature is bad, it remains bad no matter what, and hence unfi t as an offering to the ‘gods’. The third person pronoun of the gloss ( kū- š , etc.) is in the singular, whereas the pronoun in the phrase it is supposed to elucidate 21 is in the plural ( ka- š ā n , etc.). Do they have the same antecedent, namely the wolf ? If they do, the only explanation would be that the phrase ka- š ā n , etc. is reporting what the d ē w ē sn ā n do with their wolves; the gloss then reverts to the singular gurg of the opening. But I do not think this is the right reading of ka- š ā n , etc. The adverbial pad tars ā g ā h ī h generally means ‘respectfully’ or ‘obedi-ently’, but here (and in N 41.1, the only other passage in the text where it appears) it signifi es cautious approach as before an uncanny power. In fact, chapter 41 seems to be about sacrifi ce of the female wolf. N 41.1 does not specify the victim but only gives its sex: n ā irik ā - , Pahlavi n ā r ī g , ‘female’. N 41.2 rejects the sacrifi ce of span- ‘dog’ presumably as a substitute for the wolf: Sag n ē kirb n ē p ē m [ rad ī h ā . Abarag guft h ā d * bun andar n ē hili š n . Here, as in N 41.3, Kotwal and Kreyenbroek read bun for bwny of the manuscripts. They translate N 41.3 ka- š ā n h ā n ī ab ā g * bun fr ō d wa š t est ē d : ‘when their extremity has come down’ (Kotwal and Kreyenbroek 2003 , p. 181), where ‘their extremity’ is for the literal ‘the lowest part that is with them’ (Kotwal and Kreyenbroek 2003 , p. 181 n. 711). Neither the literal translation nor the whole phrase in translation makes much sense. The verb fr ō d + wa š tan ‘turn downward’ implies an upside down position or, in any case, a lowering of something from its normal position, which their translated text hardly conveys. Serious problems also dog their rendition of N 41.2 h ā d * bun andar n ē hili š n : ‘One should not leave its extremities (on the body)’ (Kotwal and Kreyenbroek 2003 , p. 179). Rather, they should have translated: ‘one should not leave its bottom’, because when used of the body, Pahlavi and Persian bun , generally meaning ‘base or basis’ (cf. Avesta buna- and Vedic budhn á - ‘bottom, ground’), means ‘bottom’ and not ‘extremities’ or ‘extremity’. But what does the translated phrase mean then? Comparing N 41.2 and 41.3, it seems like what is being said in N 41.2 is that the ritual treatment of the wolf is not permitted apropos the dog. The sense of the Pahlavi phrase in N 41.2 depends on that of N 41.3, which itself stems from a misunderstanding of the corresponding Avestan text. The Pahlavi word bun does not just mean ‘base’ but also ‘tree trunk’. The manuscript’s bwny can well be ‘bun- ē ’: ‘a tree trunk’. Hence the phrase from N 41.3 would become: ka- š ā n h ā n [ ī ] ab ā g bun- ē fr ō d wa š t est ē d . The connect-ive particle ī is extraneous and due to an automatic assumption of the idiom-atic construction ‘ ā n ī + qualifi er + noun’. The phrase can then be translated: ‘when they (i.e. the d ē w ē sn ā n ) have it (i.e. the wolf) turned upside down by means of a tree trunk’, i.e. stake the animal upside down. 22 N 41.2 h ā d bun- ē"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"214 Chthonic features of the daēva cultandar n ē hili š n must then mean something like ‘one should not leave (a dog) with a stake inside’ or ‘one should not set a stake inside (a dog)’. It is not clear to me how the gloss ( kū- š , etc.) in N 41.3 is related to what precedes it. Perhaps it only makes explicit a detail of the treatment and is not meant as its elucidation in toto . The Pahlavi translator seems to have read bao δ a- ‘scent’, instead of bao δ ah- ‘perception’, Pahlavi b ō y ( bwd ) ‘scent’, which he must have understood to indicate ‘incense’, as b ō y sometimes means. Then, another commentator, perhaps Abarag (from N 41.2), sought to rectify what he took to be an orthographic lapse, understood bōy to be bun , and added a vertical stoke to get bwny ( bun- ē ) ‘a stake’, encouraged by the Pahlavi fr ō d wa š t est ē d which supposedly translates * frauruua ē saii å . He then relied on the ghost treatment of the female wolf to reason why the bitch cannot be sacrifi ced, in the absence of any Avestan indication, as if the issue were the manner of sacrifi ce. 23 One can see that the Pahlavi description of the rit-ual treatment of the animal is worthless. On the other hand, what seems indisputable is that sacrifi ce of a wolf is considered a normal feature of the da ē va cult, and was apparently still practised when the Avestan texts of the N ē rang ē st ā n were composed. 24 Further, the Avestan authority obviously thinks the chthonic rite is an acceptable practice in Zoroastrian perspective, and the Pahlavi commentators do not fi nd it shocking, even with the explicit mention of the da ē va cult as its provenance. The sacrifi ce, as I said, could hardly have been meant for the ‘Yazads’. It is indeed astonishing that the rite made its way past the orthodox guardians of Zoroastrian dualism, appar-ently a survivor from the time when ‘Zoroastrian’ magi still sacrifi ced to the da ē vas . One must note that in ethnographic literature, the ritual killing of wild animals is particularly associated with initiations into secret societies. 25 Notes 1 See Frame 1978 , pp. 46–47, pp. 89–95. Frame shows the intimate relation of the ‘sun symbolism’ with the theme of ‘return to light and life’ in archaic Greece. The same theme is found in Vedic rescue stories of the N ā satyas. In RV 1.112.5 they lift up Vandana (from the grave) ‘so that he may see the sun’ ( sv à r dr ̥ ś é ). See Parpola 2004 –2005, p. 30. The Homeric motif of return to light and life uses terms (e.g. noos ) derived from PIE * nes , which also underlies Ved * nasat í - ‘return home safe’ and n ā satya- . The eschatological signifi cance of these terms seems to be related to their idiomatic usage in chariotry, e.g. to refer to the charioteer who ‘brings home’ his team partner, the chariot warrior. See Parpola 2004 –2005, p. 12. Importantly, the association of ‘cattle’ with the sun in Greek myths regularly occurs in contexts of the hero’s visit to and return from the underworld. Indirect arguments that I will present in due course may make this interpretation more attractive. Compare Got ō 2006 , pp. 205–11. Gershevitch ( 1975 ) arrives at a similar reading of the phrase but on a different basis: ‘one may confi dently say that “seeing the cow and the sun” was an idiom, perhaps even an idiom invented ad hoc by Zoroaster, for “going to Paradise”’ (Gershevitch 1975 , p. 79). His suggestion that the G ā thic phrase is a manipulation of a traditional idiom ‘may he go to Hell’ refl ected in Y 9.29 m ā z ą m va ē n ō it a š ibiia m ā g ą m va ē n ō it a š ibiia ‘may he not see the earth with his evil eyes, may he not see the cow with his evil eyes’ is unconvincing. If this curse says"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Chthonic features of the daēva cult 215‘may he go to hell’ and not simply ‘may he die’, then ‘seeing the earth and the cow’ must mean going to paradise, and not simply continue living – but how? How can ‘seeing the earth and the cow’ mean ‘going to paradise’? This is the question that Gershevitch has to answer. His reasoning is confused, since when it comes to explaining why sun must replace earth in the paradise formula, he asserts that ‘see-ing the earth and the cow’ does not mean ‘seeing the paradise’. But then what does it mean, whose negation should mean ‘going to hell’? ‘A poet intent on extract-ing from it an antonymous idiom for “going to Paradise” could not have con-tented himself with omitting the word not . For there would still have remained the word earth to exclude the Paradise. The word earth had to be replaced with a word denoting something higher up than the earth’ (Gershevitch 1975 , p. 79). Gershevitch seems to say, after all, that Y 9.29 idiom means ‘may he die’ and, as a curse, only implies ‘may he go to hell’. But this will require that ‘seeing the earth and the cow’ simply mean ‘continue living’. If so, why should the poet carry ‘the cow’ into his paradise formula, since it would have no connection with paradise, and, idiomatically used with the earth, it would recall earthly existence and thus spoil the paradise formula? 2 If so, perhaps the poet is punning with the phrase ‘facing the sun’ > ‘fronting the sun’ > (Humbach’s) ‘blocking the sun’. 3 See Kellens and Pirart 1991 , p. 118. 4 Swennen ( 2003 , p. 92) sees expressed in Y 34.9cc′ a ē ibii ō ma š a ṣ̌ ā siiazdat , yauuat ahmat aurun ā xrafstr ā the idea that just as the bad chief draws away his people from ‘les harmonies’, so our good chief draws away the demons from us. He explains the strange ‘harmonies’ poetically: ‘l’art du po è te consiste à é tablir sa comparaison avec une habilet é telle qu’il lui suffi t d’ é noncer la compl é ment direct du deuxi è me membre de la comparaison pour faire tenir toute la phrase. Le strat-ag è me ne peut fonctionner que si la comparaison repose sur un total parall é lisme syntaxique’ (Swennen 2003 , p. 92). The ‘total parallelism’ demands an accusative ‘demons’ matching the accusative ‘harmonies’. But the plural a ṣ̌ a may rather be due to (the poet’s desire to emphasize) the individuated relation between the indi-vidual and the presumed goal, i.e. attaining the a ṣ̌ a : the chief takes from the men of bad action their a ṣ̌ a that they each so desire. In any case, the translation of a ṣ̌ a as harmony makes not much sense. A vexing problem with Y 34.9cc′ is the subjunctive mode of the verb. Swennen says nothing on the issue, but it is obvi-ously troublesome. In what way should the subjunctive siiazdat  be interpreted? See Ahmadi 2014 . 5 See Benveniste 1970a , p. 9. 6 See Zaehner 1972 , p. 16. 7 Compare Y 49.4 and Y 51.13. 8 See Benveniste 1970b , pp. 37–42. 9 See Boyce 2001 , pp. 156–57 and Skj æ rv ø 2007 for a synoptic view of the text, its manuscript traditions and Western scholarship, and its content and ritual. 10 Compare Skj æ rv ø 2007 , pp. 120–22; Cantera 2013 , pp. 89–92. 11 See Kotwal and Kreyenbroek 2003 , p. 148, my translation. 12 N 33.4 has: pad š ab ka yazi š n ē w-t ā g kard u- š r ō z pad-i š ab ā z baw ē d ‘if a man, being single-handed, happened to perform ritual worship at night, for him his day would still be’, i.e. the ‘day’ would continue for him.

Compare Boyce and Grenet 1991 , pp. 456–60, who take Plutarch’s description of the ‘chthonic’ offerings at face value. Horky ( 2009 , pp. 79ff.) argues that the text that contains the description of the rite (‘For they pound’, etc.) comes from the Platonist Hermodorus of Syracuse, but the narra-tive is due either to Plutarch or to a contemporary Persian (Horky 2009 , p. 79 n. 119). 15 Compare Benveniste 1970b , p. 42: ‘Les daivas que le fi d è le abjure en se d é clar-ant v ī -da ē va - sont é videmment les daivas - dieux que Zara θ u š tra a combattus, les “dieux” de l’ancien culte, et nullement les daivas - d é mons des â ges plus r é cents. C’est à l’acte d é cisif de Zara θ u š tra, sa rapture avec les daivas - dieux, que se r é f è re la profession de foi zoroastrienne, car c’est cette rupture qui instaure la croyance nouvelle’. 16 How does the attribution of the apotropaic rite to Zoroaster serve the supposed polemical intent of the Zoroastrian source? How does one conclude from this attribution that the rite is imaginary? More importantly, how does one reconcile the imaginary nature of the rite with the supposed hortatory aim of the text? One conjures up a non-existent rite in order to admonish the listeners not to follow it? 17 ‘For if nothing comes into being without a cause, and if good could not provide the cause of evil, then nature must contain in itself the creation and origin of evil as well as good’ (Plutarch, De Iside 45, in De Jong 1997 , p. 162). ‘This is the view of the majority and of the wisest; for some believe that there are two gods who are rivals, as it were, in art, the one being the creator of good, the other of evil’ (Plutarch, De Iside 46, in De Jong 1997 , p. 163). 18 Compare Parpola 1997 , p. 195: ‘A golden head of a wolf from Altyn Tepe, four wolves on a golden drinking bowl from Quetta, and seals from Margiana suggest that this feared predator might have been an important totemic animal for the aris-tocratic elite of the Bronze Age cultures in the northern and eastern parts of the Iranian Plateau’. 19 See Kotwal and Kreyenbroek 2003 , p. 178, my translation. The manuscript (G 42) has frauruua ē iio . Kotwal and Kreyenbroek’s emendation must be (in part) based on the Pahlavi translation of the term ( fr ō d wa š tan ). They thus postulate a feminine noun: * frauruua ē s ā - . Obviously, the rite is not understood to be imaginary, and in fact it is thought to be appropriate in some ritual context ( ratufri- ), if not as offerings to the yazata- . The phrase ‘like (those) of all the da ē va -worshippers, etc.’ is descriptive, and is not meant to condemn the practice (here). In any case, it is hard to see how from this text one could conclude that the rite is understood to be imaginary. 20 See Kotwal and Kreyenbroek 2003 , p. 180. The translated text in square brackets is theirs. 21 Compare Kotwal and Kreyenbroek 2003 , p. 181 fn. 714: ‘Possibly the comment is added because the explanation was expected to seem strange to most people’. 22 It is interesting to note that the pistachio tree is also called wan (= bun ) ī gurg ā n ī g in Pahlavi. 23 What is described in the Pahlavi text seems like a chthonic sacrifi ce, even if it is not found in the Avestan original. The animal is staked upside down probably in a pit. A Kizzuwatnean wise woman describes her sacrifi cial technique for ridding one from sin in exactly the same terms: ‘When the night falls, the petitioner digs a hole in the ground and kills a piglet, “‘sicking’ it downward” so that its blood fl ows into the pit’ (Collins 2006 , p. 175). 24 Compare Turcan 1981 , pp. 346–48. 25 See Smith 1987 , p. 204."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Chthonic features of the daēva cult 217 Works cited Ahmadi , A 2014 , ‘ Y 34.9 a š\u0004 ā and Other Unexpected Plurals in the G ā th ā s ’, Indo-Iranian Journal , vol. 57 , pp. 61–72 .

The rule among the Vedic Indians, Romans, Greeks and Iranians is that sacred rites are generally diurnal events, even if they continue into the night, as in a number of Greek festivals. 1 Daybreak is the standard time for the commencement of festivals and sacrifi ces, whether simple daily offerings or more elaborate ceremonies. In Vedic India, the night seems to be ritually signifi cant in two connections. One is in relation to Rudra. The bull-Rudra is sacrifi ced in the woods out-side the village at midnight. No part of the victim may be brought back. In this way, the Rudra of the cattle is removed from the settlement and made to join the Rudra of the wilderness, where it belongs ( A ︊ ś val ā yana Śrauta Sutra 4.8.31, 33). Rudra is a fi erce god; the wilderness belongs to him, and perhaps the night. He has a strong affi nity with the serpent. The red colour of his skin is the colour of the clothes of the person condemned to death. The bull sac-rifi ce must have a propitiatory function, but it also dispels the danger of dis-solution from within society: the active principle of destruction that is said in Śvet ā ś vatara Upanis \u0004 ad 3.2 to ‘dwell within all creatures’. 2 But Rudra is also as brilliant as the sun, the ‘best physician of physicians’, and the divine protector and ‘lord of the cattle’. Generally speaking, this double nature is not surpris-ing for a god. Apollo is both the bringer of plague and the healer; Dionysus both induces madness and cures it. But it seems that, to a great extent, the protecting and healing Rudra in the R \u0003 gveda (e.g. RV 1.114, 2.33) is merely the dangerous Rudra propitiated and thus prevented from causing disease among the cattle and injury to men. 3 The epithet ‘healing’ is a proleptic device or contains a euphemistic request. In any event, in the Br ā hman \u0004 ic doctrine of sacrifi ce the Rudras do not seem to be important, perhaps no more than other gods, 4 and are generally isolated. 5 In short, the midnight bull sacrifi ce refl ects the nature of the god and is meant to eliminate his destructive power. All regular and occasional Vedic sacrifi ces (e.g. great soma ceremonies) are diurnal events. But the day ceremony stretches into the evening in the Atir ā tra with scheduled nightly recitations. The nocturnal Atir ā tra continues the Jyotis \u0004 t \f oma day. It is possible that the cycle represents the lifetime, since at the dawn of the following day the ā ś vina ś astra is recited for the N ā satyas,"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"220 The nocturnal ritethe (eschatological) saviours, suggesting funerary connections and, in par-ticular, the safe ascension of the dead to heaven ‘like the Suparn \u0004 a’ ( Kaus \u0004 ī tak ī Br ā hman \u0004 a 18.4). 6 While many gods are invoked during the day, the night is totally dedicated to In \u0004 dra, who is not afraid of the night and death, and fi ghts the asuras or kills Vr \u0005 tra to bring the light and space. Only the chandas ‘meters’ and soma , the sacred drink, help the god. ‘The verses accompanying the offerings should contain the keywords andhas , mad , and p ī ta ( Aitareya Br ā hman \u0004 a 4.6.3; Kaus \u0004 ī tak ī Br ā hman \u0004 a 17.7.11), a clear reference to the Soma which In \u0004 dra is thought to consume. The priests have to stay awake because “wakefulness means light” ( Kaus \u0004 ī tak ī Br ā hman \u0004 a 17.7,13f.)’. 7 The texts recited in the Atir ā tra ceremony were ‘discovered’ and ‘recited’ in primordial times by Praj ā pati, according to Pa ñ cavim \r ś a-Br ā hman \u0004 a (1.4), in order to ‘accomplish’ ahor ā tra , the sequence of day and night, that is, the basic temporal reference for Vedic ritual. ‘[C]’est par la force inh é rente aux paroles du r é cit que le Veda fait de cet é v é nement qu’il r é alise cette partie de la gen è se’ (Malamoud 2002 , p. 60). The cosmogonic myth (of Indra or Praj ā pati) associated with the rite is transparently an ex-post rationalization of the nocturnal soma ritual that must have involved composition of inspired poetry. 8 According to Oldenberg ( 2004 , pp. 251–55), in the R \u0003 gvedic period a sacri-fi ce priest also performed rites of a ‘magical’ kind. Liturgical hymns recited at sacrifi ces no less than magical formulae handle invisible powers and, out-bidding magic in scale, are supposed to contribute to the orderly functioning of the visible world. 9 The basis of this homogeneity is the enigmatic brahman embodied in the ancient formulae, which in the Br ā hman \u0004 as and later literature is the ‘power’ underlying the system of correspondences. 10 There is no con-ceptual difference between a rite dedicated to the gods and a ritual enacted in the interest of manipulating invisible powers in general. In fact, if one adopts the perspective of the later Vedic developments, the divine belongs with these powers. 11 It is not just the structured universe (e.g. the strife between the forces of r \u0005 ta and nirr \u0005 ta ) that limits the power of the gods. From the beginning (cf. Oldenberg 2004 , p. 186), the virtual identity of liturgy and magic prepares the eventual disappearance of deities in the Upanis \u0004 ads . 12 The Atharvaveda, a col-lection of hymns intended mostly for everyday usage and for the performance of magical incantations and charms of various types, 13 already dispenses with the idea of divine agency. In some of the more speculative sūktas , one even fi nds hymns accompanying rites for escaping death or for transforming the sacrifi cial substance into the highest being so as ‘to achieve the fulfi llment of the sacrifi cer’s aspirations, i.e., survival in heaven, divine existence’ (Gonda 1975 , p. 291). 14 The fundamental idea of the effi cacy of sacrifi ce leads to speculation on the mechanisms of ritual and the supposed powers on which it bears. 15 This is the direction of the Vedic thought, which relentlessly presses the idea to its logical conclusion. It must have been sacrifi ce that allowed the gods to win immor-tality and their place in heaven. They subsequently tried to keep the secret of sacrifi ce from humans. Having found their way to that secret, thanks to the"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"The nocturnal rite 221 r \u0005 s \u0004 is , men become the partner of the gods. Both pursue the same ends through sacrifi ce: ‘immortality and residence in the celestial world’. 16 But death will have its share: unlike the gods, men have to surrender their bodies. 17 ‘It is, thus, a deferred immortality that is enjoyed by humans’ (Malamoud 1996 , p. 204). 18 Why should man seek the help of the gods and not avail himself of the effi cacious power on which they themselves rely? It is interesting that the effi cacy of sacrifi ce is fundamentally seen within the horizon of achieving immortality. This does not mean, of course, that earthly goods do not appear among things sought by the sacrifi cer. They constitute the bulk of desired objects in the R \u0003 gveda (Oldenberg 2004 , pp. 181–86; Gonda 1975 , pp. 108–13). But, naturally, the effi cacy of sacrifi ce needs not limit itself to such things and could and should press toward the ultimate desired object, the attainment of divine status. 19 The victorious sacrifi cer of the v ā japeya climbs up the sacri-fi cial post along with his wife toward the wheel-shaped cake placed on top, which is understood to represent the sun and the heavenly sphere where the gods reside. The meaning of the symbolic act is clear. 20 All Roman cults, whether sacra publica or sacra privata , were a communal affair with the head of the community, the magistrates or paterfamilias, mak-ing the offerings in festive gatherings on behalf of the participants from the city or the household. 21 Sacrifi ces typically began at daybreak and, depending on their nature, could last the entire day and sometimes even into the even-ing. In civic sacrifi ces the offering speech always contained the phrase ‘for the Roman people’. In general, the prayer stated who made the offering, who its recipient was, and who the intended benefi ciary (Scheid 2007 , p. 266). The culmination of the offi cial banquets in honour of the named deities was the sacrifi cial meal, shared by the participants both human and divine, albeit with a courteous lag on the part of the former. The exception with regard to the sharing of food were the sacrifi ces made to the gods of the underworld, which were completely burnt. 22 This same practice of holocaust is also found in the case of magic sacrifi ces, ‘since they were generally aimed at Underworld gods’ (Scheid 2007 , p. 267). Magic sacrifi ces for the purposes of divination or defi xiones (binding magic) are also exceptional in another respect: they were enacted at night and in secret (Scheid 2007 , p. 262). The nocturnal nature of these seemingly latecom-ers into the world of Roman sacrifi ce cannot be, however, due only to the fact that the divine partner, called p á rhedros in Greek, was chosen from among the gods that were associated with the underworld. 23 The partners were regu-larly picked from the mystery gods (Osiris, Dionysus, Demeter, Persephone, etc.) or associated with them (e.g. Hermes, Adonis). The timing of the rite is obviously related to the underworld connection of the gods. Some of the magical ceremonies were felt to be nocturnal by nature, such as those of bind-ing magic with voodoo dolls or requests for oneiric revelation ( oneirait ē ton ), and were thus duly held at night. But even erotic spells ( philtrokatadesmos ) were enacted at night. In the fi rst part of Theocritus’ second Idyll, one fi nds a depiction of a rite of erotic magic. ‘In the middle of the night, under shining"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"222 The nocturnal ritemoon, two women are practicing magic, Simaitha and her slave Thestylis. The goal of the rite is to win back the love of a young man, Delphis, who was for a time the lover of Simaitha, but has henceforth turned to other lovers’ (Graf 1997 , p. 176). The magician did not limit himself to traditional Greek or Roman deities. In a sense, the important point was ensuring the cooperation of a power-ful god. One magician, recorded in the Greek Magical Papyri, invokes the Israelite god: ‘I am your prophet Moses, to whom you conveyed your mys-teries celebrated by the Israelite’ (Betz 1992 , p. 103). The reference to the mysteries even in invoking a Semitic god is signifi cant. The literate magician tends to view his nocturnal rite as a kind of mystery cult. 24 It is this mystic pedigree that explains the nocturnal and secret character of magical rite and, more importantly, its method: initiation to the ‘mysteries’ of a god. Thus the nocturnal character here is programmatic and basic. To be sure, not every magical rite took place at night; there were various types (Graf 1997 , pp. 118–233). But there cannot be any question that magic, e.g. in the Greco-Roman world throughout Hellenistic and Imperial periods, fundamentally conceived of itself in reference to the mageia and the mysteries. 25 The association of the mystery cults with nocturnal celebration was a commonplace, as we will see, so magic, too, was archetypically viewed as nocturnal, even though the actual rites were not necessarily so. All in all, night was the favourite time of the magician – at least this is how the matter is represented in literary sources. There is another important difference between traditional Roman sacrifi ce and the rites of the magician, who seems to have led a marginal and inse-cure existence in Hellenistic and Imperial Rome. 26 Public sacrifi ce ‘was a ban-quet, which offered men the opportunity to become familiar with their divine counterparts, to defi ne their respective qualities and status, and, together, to address the matters in hand’ (Scheid 2007 , p. 270). The social function of pub-lic sacrifi ce is fundamental, if not as important as the religious dimension. 27 Magical rite, in contrast, is oriented to specifi c aims of private individuals and serves no social function. In this, it is true, magic has certain affi nities with votive prayers, 28 but the votive aspect is also present in the mystery cults and should be understood within this context. On the one hand, where magic is not directed to more or less utilitarian goals, the practitioner seeks in his rite the ‘extraordinary experience’ of divine epiphany or revelation, the type of experience reported for the mystery cults. On the other hand, what defi nitively sets magical rite apart from the ordinary votive prayer – and again shows the telestic affi nity of the former – is that, whereas the latter is fundamentally sup-plicatory in character, 29 a sense of entitlement to the object sought accompan-ies the former (cf. Dickie 2001 , pp. 27ff.). The expectation must be grounded in the conception of initiation and the perception of its effi cacy. Referring to the ‘assistant daim ō n ’, the magician Pnouthis writes in his epistle: ‘He will serve you suitably for whatever you have in mind, O blessed initiate of the sacred magic, and will accomplish it for you’ (in Betz 1982 , pp. 168–69). The idea that magic involves the coercion of deities, which is generally true, is perhaps"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"The nocturnal rite 223misleading in the case of magical practices of the ancient Mediterranean world. The basic ideology of these practices is adopted from the mysteries, not just in what concerns behaviour and doctrine but also in attitude. 30 The transgression of the boundaries between men and gods in ‘magic’ – com-pletely anomalous in the perspective of the traditional piety, eusebeia , which is basically the keeping of a respectful distance from the gods 31 – suffuses the intellectual milieu of the mystery-type initiation, where the possession of a special knowledge serves to underwrite the magician’s pretension to a god-like status. 32 The seers and founders of the mysteries, from Orpheus to Melampus and Dardanos, are the true ancestors of the magician. 33 Notes 1 I do not deal with the pannychis in this book. A number of important Greek fes-tivals, such as the Panathenaea , continued into the night, although it is wrong to say that they ‘culminated’ at night. See, for example, Parker 2005 , pp. 166–71. The only signifi cant thing that can be said about the pannychis in general is that it was women-oriented – in a number of them (e.g. the Brauronia or Tauropolia ) virgins had the lead role – and was therefore characterized by the loosening of societal norms. The Eleusinian mysteries, on the other hand, are nocturnal in concep-tion, despite diurnal events such as the escort of Iacchus on Boedromion 20 from Athens to Eleusis. See Clinton 1993 . 2 See Dani é lou 1991 , pp. 192–94. The Rudras are also said to be the ‘forms of the life energy’ whose departure from the body causes lamentation, hence their name: ‘causes of tears’, according to Br \u0005 had ā ran \u0004 yaka Upanis \u0004 ad 3.9.1. 3 See Oldenberg 2004 , pp. 111–12. 4 See L é vi 1898 . 5 Taittir ī ya A ︊ ran \u0004 yaka (V.8.4.5) ‘distinguishes besides gods, fathers (manes) and men, a fourth special class, “the Rudras”’ (Oldenberg 2004 , 111). 6 See Parpola 2004 – 2005 , pp. 33–34. 7 See Falk 1989 , p. 81. In the R \u0003 gveda (RV 9.8.9) the priests drink the soma in their daily rite that they imagine had been offered to Indra the previous night. Falk ( 1989 , p. 82) concludes ‘that in the old ritual Indra was offered Soma at night, when he needed it most, during his fi ght against Vr \u0005 tra, killing the demon and thereby creating the unfolded world with its space, light, and water. Indra is the original drinker of Soma and no other god but Indra is praised in the night dur-ing the Atir ā tra. Therefore the Atir ā tra form of the ś rauta Soma sacrifi ce seems to refl ect much more of the R \u0003 gvedic customs concerning Soma than does the usual Agnis \u0004 t \f oma, which does not associate Soma with the night’. 8 ‘There are several stanzas proving that the poet, feeling wide awake, associates his ability to formulate with the infl uence of Soma. RV 9.96,18 calls Soma a maker of seers, r \u0005 s \u0004 ikr \u0005 t ; in RV 8.44,29 Agni is said to be awake like an inspired poet... In RV 9.97,37 Soma is called j ā gr \u0005 vi and v í pra side by side’ (Falk 1989 , p. 80). 9 ‘Seen in this light, the Veda is a vast magical synthesis expressed in symbolic terms. The images of the Veda have a ritual signifi cance in themselves; they bring about the ordered functioning of a universe which is itself conceived as the scene of a vast sacrifi ce, the prototype of man-made sacrifi ces’ (Renou 1968 , pp. 17–18). 10 See Renou 1968 , p. 10; Heesterman 1993 , p. 54. 11 Compare Hubert and Mauss 1964 , pp. 81–94. 12 Normal cult follows a rigid pattern, but not so the practice of magic, which has to be responsive to the case at hand.

The divinity is, in relation to the sacrifi ce, a subordinate factor, a kind of means to an end: in order that the sacrifi ce might be complete, there must also be a divinity, one who receives the oblation. But it is not the divinity who produces the results of the sacrifi ce; rather it is a force that emanates from the sacrifi ce itself ’ (Malamoud 1996 , p. 224). 16 See Malamoud 1996 , p. 203. 17 See L é vi 1898 , pp. 102–107. 18 Compare Hubert and Mauss 1964 , p. 91. 19 See Bodewitz 1999 , pp. 221–22; compare Kellens and Swennen 2005 . 20 See Parpola 2004 – 2005 , pp. 50–51; Eliade 1958 , pp. 77–80. 21 See Dum é zil 1966 , pp. 529–92. The same is true of Greek sacrifi ce, as Rudhardt says: ‘Ce n’est pas un individu qui sacrifi ce, mais une communaut é – serait-ce par l’interm é diaire d’un seul repr é sentant. Cette communeaut é peut ê tre un groupe familiale ou politique; elle peut ê tre une arm é e; elle peut ê tre un groupement priv é ’ (in Rudhardt and Reverdin 1981 , pp. 132–33). 22 Similarly, in the Greek sacrifi ces whose recipients were the underworld gods, such as sphagia (a pre-battle blood-sacrifi ce), no part of the victim was eaten. The seer who conducted the sacrifi ce used it especially for obtaining omens, which included divination from the intensity of fi re when gallbladder and urinary bladder of the victim were burnt, and possibly divination from the partially burnt sphagia . See Henrichs 1981 , pp. 213–16. 23 See Nock 1972 , pp. 190–94. Helios, Selene and Hecate are regularly invoked in the Greek Magic Papyri. See Betz 1992 . But Apollo, too, is present, naturally as the god of divination. Sometimes the invoked powers are left anonymous: ‘the inhabitants of Chaos and Erebos... masters of things not to be seen, guardians of secrets’ etc. Still, these powers obviously belong to the underworld: ‘leaders of those beneath the earth’ (Betz 1992 , p. 127). But the typical deities were Hermes and Osiris. See Betz 1982 , pp. 165–66. See Parker 2005 , pp. 126ff. for the Greek magical practices such as curses (including political!) mostly from the end of the fourth century BC . 24 See Graf 1997 , pp. 89–117. One hardly fi nds a ‘magic’ text before the late Hellenistic period, that is, around the time of the ‘disappearance of the charismatic specialists’ (Graf and Johnston 2007 , p. 142). Did the magician replace the itinerant purifi er? Compare Betz 1982 , p. 164: ‘There is a clear tendency in some texts to interpret magic in terms of the mystery cults. The whole of magic as well as its parts can be called myst ē rion ... the magician is the “mystagogue” ( mystag ō gos ). Furthermore, handing over the magical tradition to a student becomes the purpose of a mystery-cult initiation’. 25 Compare Dickie 2001 , pp. 33–43, pp. 124–41. 26 See Dickie 2001 , pp. 142–201. 27 Plato’s comments in Laws 738d, 771d–772a, 828bc on these two aspects seem to have general validity. 28 See Hickson Hahn 2007 , pp. 235–48 for a survey of various types of prayer in Rome. 29 ‘Although sacrifi ce was certainly the heart of Roman ritual, sacrifi ce without prayer, as Pliny the Elder commented, was useless.

As in those mute paintings and relief sculptures, there would be no clue whether the intent was petition, oath, or thanksgiving. The term “supplication” ( supplicatio ) illustrates this problem well. The Romans used the same word to identify public days or prayer and offering for propitiation, expi-ation, and thanksgiving...

In his Apology (26.6), Apuleius defi nes the ‘magus’ as ‘someone who, through the community of speech with the immoral gods, possesses an incredible power of spells for everything he wishes to do’ (in Graf 2002 , p. 93). 32 See Vernant 1990 , pp. 116–19. The general attraction of Heracles is rooted in the hero’s victory over death. ‘Heracles has broken the terrors of death; as early as the fi fth century it was said that his initiation at Eleusis protected him from the dangers of the underworld’ (Burkert 1985 , p. 211). ‘The Dioskouroi are above all saviours, soteres ’, who rescue those who appealed to them from mortal dangers (Burkert 1985 , p. 213). Divine agents with specifi c characteristics and life stories are called on for the purpose of averting death or attaining divine status. This constellation has well-defi ned particular features. It involves, among other things, mystery initiation. ‘The Dioskouroi, like Heracles, were also said to have been initiated at Eleusis and were seen as guiding lights for those hop-ing to break out of the mortal sphere into the realm of the gods’ (Burkert 1985 , p. 213). 33 See Burkert 1972 , pp. 147–65; Parker 1983 , pp. 207–14; Betz 1982 , p. 166.

"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":" 9 The Greek mysteries The mysteries, with the exception of Mithraism, 1 are a Greek phenomenon, even if they adopted certain elements from the Near East. 2 Nocturnal celebration is a basic dimension of the mystery cults, and because this was so characteristic, the nightly rite became almost synonymous with initiation into the mysteries in classical literature. 3 The prominent atheist of the fi fth century, Diagoras of Melos, ‘revealed the Eleusinian mysteries to everyone “and thus made them ordinary”. In the light of day the nocturnal ceremonies are nothing’ (in Burkert 1985 , p. 316, the quoted text is from Krateros). All the important mysteries of the Greek world, namely Eleusinian, Dionysiac and those of Isis and Kybele, were celebrated at night (Burkert 1985 , p. 91, pp. 96–97; Sfameni Gasparro 1985 , p. 11 n. 21, p. 17, p. 20). The teletai that Dionysus brings in the Bacchae 485–6 are nocturnal. The dark of night is plainly associated with the secrecy of these rites in the testimonies. ‘Eleusinian iconography depicts, one might almost say, torches, torches, and nothing but torches. At this point the veil of secrecy descends’ (Parker 2005 , p. 350). The timing, however, had a wider signifi cance than the requirement of secrecy, ensuring and refl ecting the initiate’s privileged status. The night-time belongs to the gods of the underworld, who were assumed to determine the fate of the soul. 4 Herodotus writes that the ‘Egyptians say that Demeter and Dionysus are the rulers of the underworld’ (Herodotus, Hist. 2.123). The mystery gods (Isis and Osiris) are simply introduced as rulers of the underworld. 5 The nocturnal character of the mysteries, as we will see, is related to the eschatological function of the cult deities. 6 Two details about what took place during the ‘sacred nights’ at Eleusis were exposed in a Gnostic treatise, which the Christian theologian Hippolytus reports in his Refutation 5.8.39ff. One passage reads: ‘the hierophant, at night in Eleusis, celebrating the great and unmentionable mysteries beneath a great fi re, cries aloud, saying: the reverend goddess has born a child, Brimo Brimos, the strong one has born a strong child’, probably meaning that Dionysus is born from Persephone. 7 The claim made by various writers on behalf of the celebrations at Eleusis was that the mysteries take from death its terror and guarantee a happy afterlife. 8 The myst ē s stands to gain not just an ‘extraor-dinary experience’, namely the joyful vision of the divine Kore, but also a"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"228 The Greek mysteriesprivileged status in the afterlife. 9 ‘Thrice blessed are those mortals who have seen these rites and thus enter into Hades: for them alone there is life, for the others all is misery’ (Sophocles frg. 837 from the lost tragedy ‘Triptolemos’, in Burkert 1985 , p. 289). How did the myst ē ria achieve this? Apparently the ‘great, admirable, most perfect epoptic secret’ that was revealed ‘in silence’ at Eleusis, according to the other detail from the Gnostic treatise, was the showing by the hierophant of a ‘reaped ear of corn’ (Burkert 1987 , p. 91). 10 Sourvinou-Inwood argues that this ‘revelation’ brings the search for the god-dess to its climactic end and is tantamount to the epiphany of the queen of the underworld. 11 Whatever the supposed meaning of the scene may have been, it must have carried a particular message, and not just a feeling of ‘exhilaration’, for the participants (cf. Parker 2005 , p. 352). The texts that talk about the experience of the mystai and epoptai (‘watchers’ who were already initiated) assert that mystic blessedness consists, not in emotional exultations that may have accompanied the event, but according to Aristotle, ‘in the act of “seeing” what is divine’ (in Burkert 1987 , p. 93). The ‘seeing’ must be the experiential seal of the crucial knowledge. The moment of revelation had a symbolic reality, the myth realized in an emphatic experience, adding the weight of experience to the doctrine concerning the divine care and prom-ise of salvation. 12 The presence of the ‘gods of deliverance’ (Plato, Republic 366a: lysioi theoi ) confi rms their intimacy with the initiate, signals their will-ingness to ‘release’ or otherwise help the initiate, and thus warrants the ini-tiate’s hope for a privileged afterlife. 13 The elements of the ritual, including the ear of corn, could have been, and indeed probably were, inherited from various sources and chronological layers, and given new meanings within the new system. 14 Perhaps the ear of corn became the symbol of new life emer-ging in the dark bowels of earth. One can compare with this the unveiling of the large phallus in a winnowing basket, liknon , to the initiate in Dionysian orgia . The presentation per se could not have been a revelation of some awe-some secret, 15 although it is evidently a hierophantic scene, to judge from the fresco of the Villa of the Mysteries at Pompeii. ‘The liknon with phallus appears much earlier in Bacchic contexts, but without any special “mystic” connotations... phallus processions had always been present in the worship of Dionysus’ (Burkert 1987 , 96). Even beyond the horizon of its employment in the Dionysian festivals, one can imagine that the ‘sacred object’ was used, rather transparently, in some puberty ritual as the symbol of virility, fi nding its way eventually into the Bacchic ceremonies. 16 But this sort of archaeology is illuminating as long as one can bring together the fi ndings and reconstruct the actual traditions behind the mysteries; otherwise it only leads to confu-sion. The revelation must be understood symbolically. Both the Bacchic telet ē and the initiation to Isis took place at night. 17 The candidate was confronted with horrifying phenomena, then reassured and blessed, and in the following day was received by the admiring crowd, the ‘blessed chorus’ ( thiasos ). Demosthenes, in his invective against Aeschines, describes a Bacchic nocturnal ceremony, conducted by the latter’s mother, at"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"The Greek mysteries 229the climax of which the initiates were ‘raised up’ to their feet and exclaimed ‘I escaped from evil, I found the better’ (Demosthenes, Discourses 18.259). The sins or impurities thus purged could have been any number of things. 18 As for the mystery of Isis, we have the famous passage from Apuleius’ Metamorphoses describing in all probability his own experience at a noctur-nal initiation: ‘I approached the frontier of death, I set foot on the threshold of Persephone, I journeyed through all the elements and came back, I saw at midnight the sun, sparkling in white light, I came close to the gods of the upper and the nether world and adored them from near at hand’ (Apuleius, Metamorphoses 11.23.6–8). ‘Experiencing’ deathlike conditions in the passage belongs not to rhetoric but to the fundamental ideology of the mysteries. The search for Kore at Eleusis was also a descent to Hades (see Sourvinou-Inwood 2003 , p. 34). Seeing the sun at midnight is enigmatic; one feels more is said in the phrase than merely expressing some kind of intellectual illumination. Is it an image of the descent into the underworld, where the sun spends the night? 19 The dimension of death is pervasive in the mysteries. 20 ‘The mysteries of Isis are to be accepted, the priest says, “in the form of a voluntary death and salvation by grace”... the day following the night of initiation is reckoned as a new birthday; Isis has the power to change fate and to grant a new life’ (Burkert 1987 , p. 99). 21 The Greek assimilation of Egyptian Osiris and Isis to the mystery cults is signifi cant. Burkert suggests that in the background of this reception lurked a cross-cultural misunderstanding. Generally, in Greek eyes, Egypt was the place of divine wisdom vouchsafed to priests adept in special rituals. 22 But what made the ritual of Osiris particularly mystery-like for classical Greeks, says Burkert, were its nocturnal character and the lamentations 23 that accom-panied it. Eumolpus, the mythical ancestor of the hierophants is etymologic-ally “fair singer”, and an epitaph speaks of a hierophant “pouring forth a lovely voice: it is generally and plausibly supposed that within the telesterion there was some intoning of “sacred cries” but little if any discourse in prose’ (Parker 2005 , p. 352). The adoption of the cult of Isis in the form of myst ē ria was so self-assured that ‘authentic Egyptian mysteries’ were suspected behind the mysteries of Eleusis and even those of Dionysus. The sanctuaries of Isis began offering initiation to ‘those who had the desire and the means’ for a more intimate, personal relation with the goddess (Burkert 1987 , pp. 40–41). Intimate and reassuring contact with underworld deities is the hallmark of all the mysteries. One should appreciate the singularly strong bias that the noc-turnal ‘lamentation’ of the cult of Osiris must have exercised on the Greek mind that saw in it a mystery cult. Archaic and classical Greeks tended to view a ritual contact with underworld gods celebrated at night and involving initiation-type proceedings as a mystery cult. But what was the basis of the perception of ‘initiation’ in the worship of Isis? Here, too, there must have occurred a ‘cross-cultural misunderstanding’. Initiation in general enacts a change of status. In some sense, the initiate dies and is reborn as a new being. 24 In the myth of Osiris, the dying god gives rise to"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"230 The Greek mysteriesa new (form of) life; and this myth is basic to the cult. The lamentations in the Egyptian ceremony may be for the sufferings of the god, but more likely are meant to facilitate the passage to the realm of death. The theme of death and subsequent triumph would have made the worship of Osiris seem like a mys-tery initiation. Herodotus ( Histories 2.171) says that Egyptians call the drama of the suffering and dying god represented in nocturnal rituals of mourning the ‘ myst ē ria ’. 25 This content qualifi ed the cult of Isis and Osiris as a form of mystery rite for the famous Greek historian of the fi fth century BC . He then famously declines to say more; but in designating the cult of the Egyptian gods myst ē ria , Herodotus has been less discreet than he believed. The passage to the realm of the dead appears to have been the fundamental dimension of initiation to the mysteries, probably evoked or perhaps enacted in a sche-matic way in the nocturnal celebrations (cf. Parker 2005 , p. 354). ‘These are the mysteries,’ writes the Christian apologist Clement of Alexandria (second–third centuries AD ), ‘to put it briefl y, murder and burial’ ( Protrepticus 2.19). The Latin Christian apologist of the fourth century AD, Firmicus Maternus, has described a mystery scene which appears to be from the cult of Isis (or perhaps of Dionysus). 26 The fate of the initiate seems to be likened to that of the ‘saved’ god. After days of lamenting before an idol, the priest anoints the throat of the participants and whispers: ‘Be confi dent, mystai , since the god has been saved, you too will be saved from your toils’ (Firmicus Maternus, De errore profanarum religionum 22). 27 It is not clear prima facie from what the god is rescued. Neither Osiris nor Attis 28 ‘returns’ to earthly life; and the Orphic Dionysus does not end up on the throne of Zeus, for which he was destined before his murder at the hands of the Titans. Kore is not saved from death either: in Greek literature being raped by Hades ‘means simply to die’. 29 Burkert points out that the theme of the ‘dying god’ per se was obviously not enough to make a cult fi t for mystic initiation. The cult of Heracles never developed into the mysteries. 30 Nor can the salvation promised to the initiate be some type of resurrection. None of the mysteries makes such a claim. The key factor seems to be the underworld status of the deity. 31 Osiris does not return from the realm of the dead, but becomes the ‘god of the dead’. If the cult Firmicus Maternus had in mind was that of Isis and Osiris, the ‘saved god’ had to be the god ‘justifi ed’. The deceased Egyptian before the divine panel that decides his fate hopes to receive ‘justifi cation’ and thereby a pleasant postmortem existence. 32 No hope of return to life is implied. ‘Osiris is not a resurrected god, but one who in death achieves a new form of existence in the beyond through the triumph and piety of his son, thus becoming the archetype of all deceased persons’ (Assmann 2001 , p. 145). Initiation to the mysteries of Isis promised a blessed afterlife, not resurrection. 33 This tallies with what Cicero says about the gains of the initiate of Demeter: ‘how to live in joy, and how to die with better hopes’ (in Burkert 1987 , p. 21). The idea of receiving ‘justifi cation’ through initiation is also at home in the mystery cult of Dionysus, if it is the mysteries of this god that Firmicus described. The Orphico-Dionysiac myth of Dionysus, son"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"The Greek mysteries 231of Persephone, murdered by the Titans, lies behind the instructions the dead receive in the form of inscriptions on gold leaves for their afterlife journey. As ‘a god of eschatological mysteries, he becomes powerful to aid the indi-vidual to a better lot in the afterlife’ (Parker 2005 , p. 315). The dead from whose graves these leaves, mostly from the fourth century, have been recov-ered were initiates of the mysteries of Dionysus. 34 Pindar (frg. 133) speaks of Persephone accepting ‘compensation for ancient grief ’ from the dead; 35 ‘this grief of the goddess for which men bear the guilt can only be the death of her child Dionysos’ (Burkert 1985 , p. 298). The Orphico-Dionysiac doc-trine of the ‘ancient guilt’ that every human inherits from his or her Titanic origins (humans are made, according to the myth, from the soot remnant of the Titans struck by Zeus’ lightning) and the need of redemption from that guilt through initiation goes back in some form to at least the seventh century BC . 36 The initiate is not ‘saved’ by being likened to the god Dionysus (who is ‘restored’ in some versions of the myth 37 ), even though one could plausibly maintain that the ‘divine model’ is in some sense resurrected. 38 Rather, the ini-tiation has the value of removing ‘pollution’ (or guilt) through justifi cation, understood in a broad sense. 39 The only bacchic ‘initiations’ that are clearly attested in Attica are a specialized form, the ‘orphic-bacchic’ rites administered, to both sexes, by ‘orpheus-initiators’. The formal purpose of these was to secure well-being in the afterlife, but they included bacchic ‘play’, and some may have undergone them chiefl y with a view to more immediate enjoyment. (Parker 2005 , p. 325) The initiate is reminded on the gold lamellae from Pelinna (modern Palaiogardiki) in the late fourth century BC : ‘tell Persephone that the Bacchic One himself released you’. Similarly, the leaves recovered from a tumulus at Thurii speak on behalf of the deceased: ‘I come pure from the pure, Queen of the Chthonian Ones... I also claim to be of your happy race. I have paid the penalty for unrighteous deeds... Now I come as a suppliant (feminine) to Persephone’. 40 As for the mysteries of Eleusis, Burkert reminds us that the ‘catchword is not “rescue” or “salvation” but “blessedness”, and it is taken to refer to the afterlife more than anything else: the “other gift” of Demeter, besides the bringing of grain, is the promise of a privileged life beyond the grave for those who have “seen” the mysteries’ (Burkert 1987 , p. 21). Certainly, the experience the initiates had during the ‘sacred nights’ must have formed in their mind an integral part of the overall assurance that the mysteries offered. But that unique experience in itself, even if repeated on a number of occa-sions, cannot be the basis of the peace of mind that the mysteries are sup-posed to have provided. 41 Plutarch ( Non posse 27) pokes fun at the hopes of the initiates, who ‘believe that certain rites of initiation and purifi cation will relieve them: once purifi ed, they believe, they will go on playing and dancing in Hades in places full of brightness, pure air and light’. Plutarch apparently"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"232 The Greek mysteriesthought that initiation was tantamount to ‘purifi cation’, but a special kind: it makes the initiate entitled to expect a blissful afterlife. ‘Blessed is he who has seen these things before he goes beneath the hollow earth, for he under-stands the end of mortal life and the beginning of a god-given life’ (Pindar, frg. 137). 42 The mystery gods made it possible for the initiate to ‘justify him- or herself, ‘release’ him- or herself from a certain guilt, 43 and thus become fi t for a blessed state. ‘Like the Eleusinian mysteries, although on a much lar-ger scale, Dionysus promised his followers a happy afterlife’ (Henrichs 1981 , p. 160). 44 Purifi cations were also offered for the ills of this life, such as madness. 45 Ritual incantation is used for both summoning the dead and curing ills in the Oresteia of Aeschylus. 46 Plato ( Republic 364e–365a) mentions that the itin-erant initiators offered ‘special rites for the dead’ beside the purifi cations for remission of sins for the living. The distinction between the rites for the dead and those for the living is worthy of attention. If Plato’s reference to the ‘hub-bub of books of Musaeus and Orpheus’ that the mystery priests produced as the basis of their ritual purifi cation describes a general phenomenon, there must have been an explicit doctrine or mythic account behind their proce-dures, and hence some form of homogeneity. Nonetheless, the peregrinating purifi er’s was a private craft and naturally subject to improvisations and myr-iad variations. 47 In his book on the infl uence of the Near Eastern myths and rituals in the Greek world from the eighth to the sixth century BC , The Orientalizing Revolution , Burkert connects the Hellenic fi gure of the purifi er to the Near Eastern type of the itinerant healer. Homer ( Odyssey 17.384ff.) classifi es the seers and doctors as migrant ‘craftsmen’, the Greek counterpart to the Eastern fi gure of ‘seer’ who appeared in the Greek world during the ‘orien-talizing period’ and was active there in various sectors from construction to medicine. Hepatoscopy (divination by way of inspecting the liver of an immolated animal), the Mesopotamian divination, becomes in the course of the seventh and sixth centuries the dominant form of divination in Greece. 48 There is evidence that a number of Greek ritual healings, seemingly both in conception and practice, have almost exact Mesopotamian precedents (Burkert 1992 , pp. 55–87). Epimenides purifi ed Athens from pollution around 600 BC . Diotima could delay through appropriate rituals the onset of plague ( Symposium 201de). The Near Eastern connection is signifi cant, for if the idea of ritual therapy is the sole basis of the claim that the mystery cults pro-vide ‘better hopes’ for the afterlife, the mysteries move into the domain of the ‘orientalizing revolution’. Crime is the cause not just of individual illness and communal affl iction but also of postmortem sufferings. Plato’s descrip-tion of the claims and practices of the ‘mendicant priests and diviners’ in the Republic 364b–e shows that ritual purifi cation was used as therapy for phys-ical illnesses by the same fi gures that are associated with the mysteries: ‘For their part, beggar priests and diviners ( agyrtai de kai manteis ) come to the doors of rich men and persuade them that they have obtained from the gods,"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"The Greek mysteries 233by sacrifi ces and incantations ( ep ō dais ), the power to heal them by means of games and festivals 49 of some injustice committed by themselves or by their ancestors... for, to hear them, they persuade the gods to place themselves at their service’. They heal by ritual purifi cation. But one must be careful in assigning provenance and borrowing. The idea of therapy by way of purifi catory atonement was widespread in the ancient world, where any disturbance of the unique, ‘multi-stranded’ order was thought to produce nefarious effects in various dimensions. 50 If specifi c therapeutic procedures were adopted from the Mesopotamia into the Greek world, this ‘transfer’ must have taken place on the basis of the Greeks’ percep-tion of their effi cacy; and such a perception could arise only within a shared horizon of sensibilities with regard to the practices in question. What recom-mended the adopted procedures were not so much their empirical results as their ideological foundations. The transfer of objects, techniques and ideas from the Near East to archaic Greece following the ‘dark ages’ should not be viewed simply as adoption of the items of a superior culture. There were many Mesopotamian items available, contemporaneous with the ‘adopted’ ones, which were shunned and remained ‘barbaric’. One must take the full measure of the fact that the Mesopotamian precedents of ritual purifi cations evoked by Burkert ( 1992 , pp. 41–79) are therapeutic in the narrow sense, i.e. directed to the ills of this world. Pacifying disgruntled ghosts so that they leave the living in peace is not the same thing as providing a blessed existence for the departed soul. Gilgamesh remains a mortal; only a dreary existence is in store for him upon dying, but not so for the hopeful Pythagorean, nor for the initiate of the mysteries. There is no evidence that the Semitic East shaped the basic ideological pattern of the mysteries. When Herodotus cred-its Egypt with the mysteries and metempsychosis ( Histories 2.123), it is clear that what he is describing in this instance is in fact Greek: Egypt never devel-oped a doctrine of metempsychosis. As I said above, the assimilation of the cult of Isis and Osiris to the mysteries has to be understood on the basis of the fundamental elements of the mysteries (nocturnal celebration apparently involving lamentation, the underworld status of the gods invoked, ‘justifi ca-tion’ as the way to postmortem bliss, etc.). The Egyptian cult is not the origin of the mysteries. Having become a Greek mystery cult and the ‘origin’ of Pythagoreanism, the ‘Egyptian’ cult had to be also the origin of the doctrine of metempsychosis. Notes 1 Mithraism shared the main features of the mysteries. I do not discuss it here not because it made an exception in this regard but because of its relative lateness. In his so-called Caesares , the Emperor Julian, an initiate of Mithras, has Hermes address him in the following words: ‘I have granted you to know Mithras the Father. Keep his commandments, thus securing for yourself an anchor-cable and safe moor-ing all through your life, and, when you must leave the world, having every confi -dence that the god who guides you will be kindly disposed’ (in Clauss 2001 , p. 144)."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"234 The Greek mysteriesThe similarities of Mithraism and Christianity in respect of salvation claims and even doctrinal points of ritual were known to the early Christian polemicists. The common characteristics were a constant incitement of vengeful impulses in these preachers of the religion of love as long as Mithraism existed. See Clauss 2001 , pp. 108–109 on the ritual meal, and generally pp. 168–72. Mithras was, more than any other mystery god, a psychopompic god. ‘Initiation into a mystery cult such as that of Mithras enabled one to acquire knowledge of all the secret lore, prayers and rituals which guaranteed that initiate’s soul would one day fi nd its way to the sphere of the fi xed stars’ (Clauss 2001 , p. 141). Mithras is undoubtedly a composite fi gure. See Kellens 2000 , pp. 693–95, for a discussion of the eschatological role of Mithra in the Avesta. Beck ( 1998 ) argues for a Commagenian formation of the mysteries from learned astrological traditions and Iranian elements. The ascent of the soul to heaven guided by the god reveals the Iranian background of Mithras, notwith-standing the prevalent view that makes the god more or less purely Roman (Clauss, Gordon and others). Mithraism is fi rst and foremost a mystery cult, understood in the sense it is presented in this chapter. See Turcan 1981 , pp. 358–63; Beck 1998 , pp. 116–17. The slaying of the bull, Clauss ( 2001 , pp. 78–90) maintains, seems to have cosmogonic as well as eschatological signifi cance. ‘The bull is sacrifi ced so that new life may be produced’ (Clauss 2001 , p. 81). One can hardly dispute this general proposition, but the particular content that Clauss wants to give it is another mat-ter. ‘The geste of Sol Invictus Mithras is one that brings about creation and deliver-ance. This is the core of all sun- and vegetation-myths, the very pith of this as well as other ancient mystery-cults’ (Clauss 2001 , p. 82). 2 See Burkert 1987 , 1992 ; Sfameni Gasparro 1985 , pp. 64–83. 3 On the Adonia see Versnel 1990 , pp. 103–105. 4 See Graf 1974 , pp. 79–93. 5 The idea of Dionysus as the ruler of the dead is attested only for Dionysus Zagreus. See Gantz 1993 , pp. 118–19; Parker 2005 , p. 315. 6 One cannot overemphasize the importance of the underworld connections of the mystery gods for understanding the meaning of the mystery cults. Those who deny the eschatological function of these cults are hard pressed to explain this central feature. This, of course, does not mean that the function is necessarily the ‘origin’ of the mysteries, which, in any case, responded to worldly concerns too. See Sfemani Gasparro 1985 , pp. 84–106. I am sceptical about Clinton’s assertion that the myster-ies ‘represent a transformation of the much older Thesmophoria and similar cults open only to women. Several elements and themes of the older cult remain in the new creation – sorrow, fasting, a sacred well, ritual mockery, deposition of piglets in megara , agrarian prosperity’ (Clinton 1993 , p. 120). Clinton maintains that the ‘div-ine drama’ of Kore and Demeter, in which the initiate takes part in the sacred night, contains a message of hope for the afterlife. ‘The initiates suffer as the Goddesses suffer and fi nally share in the Goddesses’ extraordinary joy. And so they enter into a special relationship with each of them and naturally with Kore’s other self, the Thea in the underworld, who will look after them in the life to come’ (Clinton 1993 , p. 120). What is essential is the form of initiation. In the Homeric Hymn to Demeter , the goddess institutes the mysteries so that she may be appeased once she has failed in her immortalization of the nursling Demophon. See Parker 1991 , pp. 8ff. A cause for grievance is obviously at issue. Further, initiation to the mysteries in general was understood in classical literature as ‘purifi cation’. These points make Clinton’s con-ception of the process of imparting the ‘hope for a better afterlife’ questionable. 7 Clinton ( 1992 , pp. 91–95) and Graf (Graf and Johnston 2007 , p. 151), among others, maintain that Brimo is Demeter and Brimos, Plutus, Wealth; ‘this is the commonest view’ (Parker 2005 , p. 358 n. 138). Neither Demeter nor Plutus, how-ever, can be legitimately characterized as ‘strong’. Parker considers the Dionysus option, referring to some texts in which it is said that ‘Dionysus son of Persephone’"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"The Greek mysteries 235 is honoured at Eleusis, but fi nally decides for Plutus. ‘A representation at Eleusis of the birth of the Orphic Dionysus would be, so to speak, eschatological dyna-mite; it would change the whole base on which the cult’s promises about the after-life were grounded. But for that very reason it is rather hard to believe in’ (Parker 2005 , pp. 358–59). Parker himself acknowledges that the ‘goal of the Mysteries is eschatological; the cult’s promise of a blessed afterlife is repeated with remark-able consistency over many centuries’ (Parker 2005 , p. 354). Even if the Orphic Dionysus was not originally a persona in the Eleusinian drama of salvation, one can see its attraction for the Kore-centred ritual. The epiphany of the queen of the dead will have been reassuring to the initiate, whose initiation meant ‘purifi -cation’. The initiation presumably had an eschatological signifi cance. How does one account for this without the ‘Orphic Dionysus’ – purifi cation from what, rec-onciliation for what? A ‘chorus in Sophocles invoke [sic.] Dionysus as one who rules “in the vales, open to all, of Eleusinian Deo”... the only source which tells us anything specifi c about the content of the Lesser Mysteries at Agrai (usually described in the vaguest terms, but associated with Demeter and Kore) describes them as “an imitation of the story of Dionysus”’ (Parker 2005 , p. 341). According to Plato, Gorgias 497c, the ‘lesser mysteries’ were the condition of access to the ‘great mysteries’. The importance of Dionysus in the Eleusinian mysteries is thus beyond doubt. A fragmentary tomb inscription from the island of Tenos says ‘a maenad of wild Brimos’ takes part in ‘the rites of the girl from the race of Agenor’ (Henrichs 1978 , p. 138). Brimos here is unquestionably Dionysus. See also Bacchae 725–6: ‘(the maenads) calling in unison on Bromios as Iakchos’. Compare Clinton 1992 , 64–71. The god also appears with the name Bromios in Pratinas, Pindar and Aeschylus. See Gantz 1993 , p. 118 for references. 8 See Burkert 1985 , pp. 285–90. 9 I will discuss in more detail the relation between ‘mystic experience’ and the cer-tainty of a blissful afterlife below. 10 The chain of adjectives in the monk’s description of the proceedings is obviously ironic if not malicious. 11 ‘What evidence there is on searches and on modalities of divine presence in Greek rituals suggests that the fi nding of a deity had taken one of two forms: the fi nding of the statue, or the fi nding of something else closely connected with the deity... I suggest that the “fi nding” of Kore in the Mysteries consisted of the miracu-lous appearance of something connected with her... the advent of Kore was ritually enacted through the miraculous fi nding of an unseasonable ear of corn’ (Sourvinou-Inwood 2003 , p. 35). 12 Graf ( 1974 , pp. 139–50) convincingly shows that the Eleusinian ‘promise’ was publicly known by the end of the fi fth century BC, thanks to the ‘Orphic’ poems. ‘The dominant language in early texts is of “showing” or even just “doing” the Mysteries ’ (Parker 2005 , p. 353). Without some kind of knowledge of the myth and doctrine of the mysteries, all the ‘showing’ and ‘doing’ would have been mean-ingless to the participant. 13 According to a fragment ( Fr. 15), Aristotle thought that the aim of the initiates ( teloumenoi ) should be to ‘experience’ ( pathein ), and not to ‘learn’ ( mathein ), the mysteries. See Burkert 1987 , p. 69, p. 89. Graf interprets this as meaning that the object of the mysteries was some kind of ‘emotional experience’, and that it was this that had to be kept secret: ‘the rites were kept secret, and the central, emo-tional experience could not be communicated at all, as Aristotle already knew’ (Graf and Johnston 2007 , p. 141). If the prohibition to communicate applied to the ‘central, emotional experience’ that the initiates are supposed to have had, it was a redundant ban, since, like emotional experience in general, it could not have been really communicable anyway. The ‘experience’ had to do with the closeness of the ‘absolving gods’. The secrecy in part guaranteed for the ‘experience’ the"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"236 The Greek mysteriesstatus of a positional good. The experience had to be symbolic , in the sense that for the initiate it embodied a l ó gos , even if it, as it is supposed by modern scholars, ecstatically claimed the initiate. All aspects of sacrifi ce, whether mystic or other-wise, are symbolic, understood in this sense: e.g. the ‘meal’ that the participants of Greek sacrifi ce eat no less than the ‘portion’ that the gods receive in the form of smoke. See Vernant’s comments in Rudhardt and Reverdin 1981 , pp. 24–25, pp. 89–90. Making ‘ecstatic experience’ as such the central achievement of the mysteries, aside from the methodological problems it introduces, goes against the evidence. In a similar vein, Henrichs criticizes the thesis of ecstatic identifi cation with Dionysus in Dionysiac rituals. See Henrichs 1981 , pp. 157–60. 14 See Kirk 1981 , pp. 70–72. Ritual elements do not necessarily give us the key to the meaning of the ritual where they are found. Atavistic episodes are reinterpreted in the light of an acquired meaning. The ‘fact that the mysteric ritual’s ultimate goal was the achievement of a happy afterlife in Hades makes it more likely than not that the search for Persephone was given an eschatological reinterpretation when the festival became the Mysteries’ (Sourvinou-Inwood 2003 , p. 34). 15 ‘Would the secret of Eleusis, could we know it, come as a surprise?... nothing sug-gests that the answer would, on a large scale, have been “yes”; this was a cult of showing, not of teaching, and the ideas that it deployed were almost necessarily those that the initiates brought with them to the telesterion ’ (Parker 2005 , p. 360). 16 But see Diodorus, Library of History 1.22.6 where he refers to the use of the ‘hid-den phallus’ of Osiris in Egyptian rites and sacrifi ces. In all Dionysiac rituals, the ‘phallus is basic’ (Parker 2005 , p. 318). In the procession, the ‘phallus probably struck an informal, uninhibited note... it was also, above all, a symbol and a cele-bration... of male lust... The satyrs... express, in comically transferred form, a recognition and even a complaisant acceptance of the power of desire’ (Parker 2005 , pp. 319–21). 17 So did the mysteries of Kybele: ‘by torch light’, according to Pindar (Sfemani Gasparro 1985 , p. 11). 18 ‘The formula is vague, perhaps deliberately so, and need not imply eschatological hopes; but the books that Aeschines read out were probably Orphic (what else could they have been?), and are likely to have contained promises of this kind. Here, therefore, we have, unusually, clear evidence for a rite of deliverance that can reasonably be seen as Orphic, and that took the form of physical purifi cation’ (Parker 1983 , p. 303). 19 See my discussion of the topic in the Conclusion. Compare Frame 1978 , pp. 6–33. Frame shows that the underworld topography was a topic of the Indo-European poetic tradition. Helios is present in the Nysian plain ‘at the ends of the earth’, the site of Persephone’s original descent into Hades. See Parker 1991 , p. 7. According to Graf, a comparable conception of initiation is behind the gold leaves: the ini-tiation rehearses what the doctrine teaches about death and the journey of the departed soul. The emotional centre of the initiation ‘is not physical death but rather the descent to the Underworld, the confrontation with the powers down there, and, fi nally, the successful arrival among the other blessed initiates’ (Graf and Johnston 2007 , p. 158). 20 See Burkert 1983 , p. 295. 21 See Versnel 1990 , pp. 39–52, for an illuminating discussion of the aretologies of the goddess. 22 Diodorus ( Library of History 1.92.3) wrote that Orpheus had presented Egyptian rites as his own descent into the world below, and introduced these rites in the form of mystery cults into Greece. The question of what degree of sensitivity is to be expected from the Greek observers is apparently not settled. ‘The very ancient could always count on a respectful curiosity on the part of the Greek public, but as this was increasingly accompanied by a receptivity toward the spiritual contents"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"The Greek mysteries 237themselves, the antiquarians were encouraged imperceptibly to turn into teachers and preachers’ (Jonas 1958 , pp. 19–20). But much more ambivalent are the views of Nock 1972 , pp. 308ff. and Beck 1991 , pp. 491ff. I will discuss these two in some detail further below. The idea that anything the Greeks have to say about other cultures is by and large of their own making, because no accurate refl ection of these is found in Greek writings, is methodologically problematic. Yet, one feels it is operative in many an otherwise illuminating analysis. Compare Momigliano 1975 , pp. 144–48. According to this approach, the Greeks were generally uninter-ested in and incapable of ‘learning’ from other cultures. I wonder how a proponent of this view explains, e.g. what Plutarch’s fourth-century BC sources have to say about Zoroastrian eschatology in Plutarch, De Iside 46–47. See Chapter 7 . 23 The go ē teia ‘wizardry’ is derived from the ancient word of funerary lament goos . See Dickie 2001 , pp. 13–14. I discuss this topic further in the text. 24 As the gold leaves from Pelinna remind the deceased initiate of Dionysus: ‘Now you have died and now you have come into being’ (in Graf and Johnston 2007 , pp. 36–37). Conversely, death may be understood on the model of a rite of passage. ‘Death is treated as a change of state, an entry into a world other than that of the living, an access to an elsewhere’ (Vernant 1991 , p. 77). 25 One can gather from the ‘longer version’ of Herodotus, Histories 2.81 that ‘Orphic’ and ‘Bacchic’ ritual teachings had common elements and that Herodotus thought they were ‘in reality Egyptian and Pythagorean’. See Burkert 1972 , pp. 127–28 for the controversy about the two versions of the text. Burkert ( 1972 , p. 128) writes: ‘Herodotus states that there is a connection between Orphism and Pythagoreanism in the realm of ritual. In addition, the longer text contributes not only an indication that Orphism is connected with Dionysus, but a theory about its origin, namely that it comes from Pythagoras, who got his teachings from Egypt’. 26 See Burkert 1987 , p. 75. It does not make any difference for our purpose to which mystery cult the description belongs. 27 In my mind, this reference to the ‘saved god’ makes Parker’s interpretation that it is physical purifi cation as such that ‘delivers’ the initiate improbable. See Parker 1983 , pp. 298–303. 28 See Sfemani Gasparro 1985 , p. 42: ‘if we cannot talk of the youth’s return to life or “resurrection”, the mythical tradition attested by the two authors [i.e. Pausanias and Arnobius] has an outcome which, even if it is characterised by pathos and by mourning, guarantees a positive prospect for Attis, since he is saved from com-plete annihilation. In this manner [i.e. undecaying body] the youth obtains a sub-sistence beyond death, or rather what we would be entitled to call a subsistence “in death”’. Compare Ker é nyi 1951 , pp. 88–90. The same is true, incidentally, of Adonis. ‘Concerning a “resurrection” of the god nothing is known. Both myth and ritual focus on the mournful aspects of his decease’ (Versnel 1990 , p. 104). 29 See Burkert 1983 , pp. 261–62, who refers to a number of instances. 30 See Burkert 1987 , pp. 75–76. Pythagoreans were represented throughout antiquity as ‘imitating Heracles’. The mythical symbolism of the hero was especially import-ant in the legend that grew around Empedocles, whose purifi cation of Selinus from plague, involving the changing of the course of two streams, and his sub-sequent leap into Etna (i.e. death and apotheosis by fi re) are clearly Heraclean. See Kingsley 1995 , pp. 250–88. But the cult of the hero never became one of the mysteries, despite the fact that he was a human, a hero, it is true, who rose to the status of a god. The cult of Heracles would have made the most perfect mystery if initiation meant the identifi cation of the initiate with the cult fi gure. Those who propose an interpretation of the mysteries along these lines ignore this fact. The sense of the expected ‘salvation’ is not: ‘I am like X, so I will not die’, where X is whatever god or hero that dies and lives again; but: ‘I will have a blessed afterlife"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"238 The Greek mysteriesbecause X saves me’, where X is an underworld god. I will discuss the meaning of ‘X is for me’ further below. 31 The word ‘underworld’ does not have any sinister resonance in this context. The mystery cults certainly are not about propitiating hostile deities. 32 See Assmann 1989 , pp. 147–52, 2001 , pp. 123–47. 33 The gold leaves, found in the graves of Dionysiac initiates in Greece, Crete and southern Italy, ‘preserve traces of a ritual scenario that was part of the bearers’ initiation and that prepared them for the role they had to play once their souls had left their bodies and entered “the dark realms of Hades”’ (Graf and Johnston 2007 , p. 164). 34 See Graf and Johnston 2007 for the texts, commentary, history of scholarship and bibliography. 35 See Parker 1983 , p. 300. 36 See Burkert 1982 , pp. 8–9 and Robertson 2003 , pp. 218–24. 37 See Graf and Johnston 2007 , pp. 66–93. 38 Kingsley ( 1995 , pp. 264–69) argues (against Zuntz) that the portrayal of the initiate, found in a number of gold tablets, as a ‘kid’ or ‘bull’ or ‘ram’ ‘jumping into milk’ or ‘making for the breast of the underworld queen’ is an image of ‘immortalization’ through identifying with the victim-god Dionysus. I am not convinced, at least not in this straightforward version. The change of status is different in each case, the divine model and the initiate. If one can say anything general about the situation of the divine fi gures of the mysteries it is this: the god becomes an underworld god. The mortal of the gold plates, on the other hand, becomes immortalized thanks to her or his initiation to the Bacchic One. An Apulian volute crater from around 380 BC shows Chthonic Dionysus in a handshake with the enthroned Hades in an underworld scene. The initiate is a ‘follower’ of the god, who is expected to guide her or him to ‘Persephone’s sacred meadows and groves’, as a plate from Thurii describes the postmortem blessedness. This point is important. 39 See Graf and Johnston 2007 , pp. 121–31; and Burkert 1985 , pp. 293–95: ‘by the fi fth century at the latest there are Bacchic mysteries which promise blessedness in the afterlife. Implied is the concept of baccheia that designates ecstasy in the Dionysiac orgia , in which reality, including the fact of death, seems to dissolve’ (Burkert 1985 , p. 294). Be that as it may, the dissolution of the fear of death in ecstatic experience could hardly constitute the eschatological attraction of the mysteries, the reassurance they provided regarding the afterlife. The scholar nat-urally feels he has to accommodate all the known aspects of the mysteries in a coherent theory, but this might not be possible. Ritual elements are bound to be from different historical layers, and atavistic survivals are certain, possibly absorbed by the emergent doctrine. But not all the surviving components are reassigned to new functions. The ‘original’ functions of rituals may be lost while the rites themselves do not disappear but are understood in the light of a new ideology. See Versnel 1981 , pp. 184–85. The account one can plausibly recon-struct for the mysteries along the lines that they promise or even make possible a blessed afterlife may not be able to explain the hierophantic scene of Eleusis, i.e. the silent showing of the ear of corn, which can be and has been interpreted in a number of ways, none of which really appears connected with the general doctrine of blessed afterlife through initiation. ‘Attention has been drawn to the saying from St. John’s Gospel that a grain of wheat must die if it is to bring forth fruit. For “from the dead comes nourishment and growth and seeds”. The ear of corn cut and shown by the hierophant can be understood in this way’ (Burkert 1985 , pp. 289–90). If prompting to such a conciliated view of life were the sense of the revelation of the ear of corn in silence, then that ‘revelation’ would be an alien element in the doctrine assumed for the mysteries. Indeed, it would form a competing doctrine."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"The Greek mysteries 239 40 The tablets, writes Johnston, ‘share the expectations that there is a special place in the Underworld for Bacchic initiates (shared with the heroes and perhaps the initiates of other mysteries as well) and that reaching it requires the use and display of knowledge obtained during initiation rituals performed before death’ (Graf and Johnston 2007 , p. 131). It is possible that the ‘penalty’ refers to the deceased’s life as such which was lived in accordance with the Orphic precepts, e.g. of vegetarianism, and thus purifi ed of the stains of human existence. Thus the initiate can say: ‘I come pure’, etc. 41 Compare Parker 1983 , p. 286: ‘All the sources insist that the salvation of the initi-ate depended not on purity, a mere preliminary, but on what he saw and heard on the night of Boedromion 20 in the great hall of initiation’. 42 See Parker 2005 , pp. 360–63; and Burkert 1983 , pp. 293–97. 43 See Graf 1974 , pp. 151ff. In the Orphic context, the guilt of involvement in the murder of Dionysus attached to human beings by virtue of their Titanic origins. 44 For the initiate, the acquisition of ‘Dionysiac identity’, beyond the role-playing of the festivals, is possible only in the afterlife. ‘The satyrs and maenads together incorporate the whole gamut of Dionysiac “madness”: the satyrs are subject to drunkenness and sexual frenzy, the maenads undergo an ecstatic encounter with wild nature... [The god’s] followers surrender their individuality in the collective excitement. But they do not achieve union with the source of that excitement, how-ever close they may seem to approach’ (Parker 2005 , p. 326). 45 See Parker 1983 , pp. 212–21: ‘the purifi ers of the fi fth and fourth centuries... are called purifi ers because they remove disease by a kind of washing’ (Parker 1983 , p. 212). Bathing and lustration are the most basic methods. ‘Purifi cation assimi-lates disease to dirt that can be washed off ’ (Parker 1983 , p. 216). Ecstatic dancing could also be an independent method of purifi cation, especially of madness. This is how the god cured the maenads. ‘It remains for us to wonder what really consti-tuted the intrinsic unity of these two dimensions of mysteries – realistic cures and immunizations, on the one hand, and imaginary guarantees of bliss after death, on the other’ (Burkert 1987 , p. 23). But if the ills of this world are due to crimes committed by oneself or one’s ancestors and are remediable by way of purifi cation or ask ē sis , why not those that are visited on the soul in the afterlife? Besides the preparatory purifi cation such as the taking of a bath, writes Graf, ‘the overall ini-tiation rite could have a cathartic function as well; this is especially true for ecstatic rituals. Ecstasy was understood as being purifi catory by itself, cleansing the soul from the disturbances and constraints of daily life. Originally this cleansing was connected with eschatological concerns; then it was transferred to the soul’s cleans-ing from the guilt accumulated by unjust deeds’ (Graf and Johnston 2007 , p. 144). Parker ( 1983 , pp. 281–307) argues that the development of eschatological concerns within Bacchic circles was due to the infl uence of Empedocles and Pythagoreans. If Graf is right about the priority of eschatologico-mystic over utilitarian-magical purifi cation, once again, ‘magic’ fi nds its historical roots in the mysteries. 46 See Dickie 2001 , p. 25. 47 Compare Burkert 1992 , pp. 9–12: ‘In Greece even the “normal” craftsmen were working each at his own risk and profi t, without institutions such as the late medi-eval guilds. All the more did religious practitioners aspire for singularity... the decisive criterion for being a kathart ē s or telest ē s must have been success... Thus we should not expect consistency of beliefs or even dogmas; each individual would select, adopt and discard according to the exigencies of his career’ (Burkert 1992 , pp. 9–10). See also Dickie 2001 , pp. 60–78. 48 See Burkert 1992 , 48–49. 49 Compare Plato Euthydemus 277de. 50 The term ‘multi-stranded’ comes from Ernest Gellner ( 1988 , pp. 58–62), which he defi nes as the subordination of the referential logic of cognition to the exigencies of the social.

"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":" 10 The magi in Heraclitus and the Derveni author In a famous fragment (DK 14), Heraclitus says: ‘the initiation into the mysteries (as) practised among men is unholy ( anier ō sti )’. Clement of Alexandria, who is the source ( Protrepticus 22), also reports another fragment, which is thought by some scholars to be Clement’s own gloss: ‘Against whom are Heraclitus the Ephesian’s prophecies addressed? “The wanderers of the night: the magi, the bacchantes, the maenads, the initiates” – he threatens all these men with tortures after death, he threatens them with fi re, for “what men believe to be mystery initiations are impious rites”’. 1 The fragment, if genuine, is the earliest attestation of the myst ē ria and the magoi in Greek. In the disputed part, the magus ( magos ) is mentioned on a par with the initiate ( myst ē s ), etc., and described as a night-wanderer. The magus is a practitioner of a nocturnal rite, presumably similar to the mysteries of Eleusis and Dionysus. Graf rightly points out that ‘a meaning of magos which is widely different from that of the era of Clement guarantees Heraclitus’ authorship’ of the disputed fragment (DK 14a): νυκτιπόλοις μάγοις , Βάκχοις , Λήναις , μύσταις ‘the wanderers of the night: the magi, the bacchantes, the maenads, the initiates’. Heraclitus, who lived under the Persian Empire toward the end of the sixth century BC 2 and must have had fi rst-hand experience of the Persian priests, directly associates the nocturnal rite of the magi with the mysteries and says that these rights (as) practised by men are unholy (see Janko 2001 , p. 4). 3 In a later work, Graf seems to suggest that the ‘likening’ of the initiates and initiators of the mysteries to the magi in Heraclitus had merely a polemical basis, namely the hateful reputation of the alien priests in ‘Persian-occupied Ephesus’ (Graf and Johnston 2007 , p. 146). If this is indeed Graf ’s meaning, it cannot be right. The polemic intent in associating apparently popular and, at least in the case of some of the cults, offi cially sanctioned practices (see Plato Republic 364e) with those of the ‘feared, hated, or despised’ Persian priests could be effective only if the similarities between the Greek and Persian cults were perceptible and signifi cant. The exercise could not have been a mere ad hominem . This is strong evidence for the fact that the magi’s nocturnal rite and the mysteries had typical features in common. Gordon ( 1987 , p. 78) maintains that the association under nuktipoloi with the Bacchants ‘strongly suggest[s] a negative connotation already’ for the magoi . But, strangely, he does not ask what the"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"The magi in Heraclitus and the Derveni author 243basis of the comparison could have been. 4 Dickie ( 2001 , pp. 28–30), on the other hand, maintains that the magoi ‘offered initiation into private mystery-cults’ just like ‘fi gures from the cult of Dionysus’, but raises doubts (followed by Horky 2009 , pp. 54–55) as to whether Heraclitus’ magoi are really ‘Iranian fi re-priests’ and not ‘wandering religious charlatans’ passing themselves off under that title. A few pages later, he removes the doubt. ‘By the time – and this is at a very early date [i.e. in Heraclitus] – we encounter in a Greek setting persons who are referred to as magoi there is no trace left of Zoroastrianism. What we fi nd instead are men who offer initiation into the quite unPersian institution of the mystery-cult’. 5 Dickie thus acknowledges the similarities in Heraclitus’ eyes between the magi’s rite and the mysteries. That the shared features included the form of initiation must remain a speculation in this context. Based on it, however, Dickie denies the Persian identity of Heraclitus’ magoi , since, according to him, initiation into the mysteries is ‘unPersian’. It is, of course – by defi nition. But what does this have to do with the fact that the magi, too , performed their rite at night and that their rite may have had other signifi cant similarities with the mysteries? That in the last quarter of the sixth century BC in Ionia some wandering religious charlatans for unknown reasons took on the title magos , and that this name quickly and defi nitively became theirs, so much so that by magoi Heraclitus had to mean them rather than the Persian priests who presumably had moved into the Greek cities of Asia Minor two or three decades earlier – these assertions are untenable. It is not even clear, Dickie notwithstanding, 6 that Heraclitus’ condemnation of the mysteries aims at their ‘private’ nature and not their very conception. 7 All in all, there is no reason to think that by magoi Heraclitus did not mean Iranian priests. Since its discovery in 1962 near a grave at the cemetery of Derveni in Thrace, the carbonized fourth-century papyrus scroll has been the object of keen scholarly interest. It is the ‘oldest literary papyrus that has ever been found’ (Most 1997 , p. 117). The text, which must be older than the scroll itself, 8 consists in the main of an allegorical interpretation in Pre-Socratic terms of an Orphic theogony, but it also contains some observations about mystery-type rites. 9 The extant papyrus comprises 26 columns, some, espe-cially the fi rst columns, badly damaged, and a number of fragments. The authorized publication of the whole text appeared only a few years ago. 10 The fi rst fi ve columns seem to be about the afterlife and column 6 is about the rites that can facilitate (seemingly) the passage of the soul to the beyond. This col-umn refers to a rite of the magi, which the Derveni author compares with the sacrifi ce that the mystai make. The magi’s rite involves ‘incantation’ claimed to be capable of driving away the ‘hindering daimones ’. Do we have in this text an authentic description of an Iranian rite?

This is why the magi perform the sacrifi ce, just as if they are paying a retribution. And on the offerings they pour water and milk, from which (plural) they also make the libations (...) 12 Innumerable and many-knobbed are the cakes they sacrifi ce, because the souls too are innumerable. Initiates make a prelim-inary sacrifi ce to the Eumenides in the same way the magi do; for the Eumenides are souls. On account of these, 13 anyone who is going to sac-rifi ce to the gods must fi rst... [sacrifi ce?] a bird... and the... they are... as many (fem. ‘souls’?) as...’ 14 Although the last line is badly damaged, it is crucial, I think, for under-standing what precedes it. The conjunctive ὧν ἓνεκ [ εν must refer to the preced-ing ‘souls’: ‘because of the souls’, i.e. because of the way the souls are or what the souls do, ‘anyone who is going to sacrifi ce to the gods must fi rst...’ Thus the Derveni author must think that the ‘souls’ are in a position that enables them to prevent the sacrifi ce from reaching the gods. These are the ‘vengeful souls’, which is the author’s explanatory term for the ‘hindering daimones ’ of the magoi . Burkert ( 2007 , pp. 119–20) maintains that the aim of the ritual actions ‘must be to get into contact with the god or gods. This is the function of sacrifi ce and prayer. But this can be achieved only through the well-known dealings with the intermediary powers, as known by the magi’. All this tells us that we should place the ‘souls’ in space between the earth and heavens. Scholars have raised doubts whether the author’s magoi are really Iranian priests. 15 Most ( 1997 , p. 120) assumes without further ado that the magoi ‘fi g-ure here as representatives not of Persian but of Greek religion’. Betegh ( 2004 , pp. 78–83) expresses the same view but goes even farther and argues that the Derveni author thinks of himself as a magos , which for him means simply a ‘religious expert’. Kouremenos ( 2006 , pp. 167–68) believes that the magoi the author has in mind are ‘charlatans’. 16 Burkert ( 2007 , p. 108) dates the use of the term magoi in the sense of ‘itinerant magicians and sorcerers’ to the end"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"The magi in Heraclitus and the Derveni author 245of the fi fth century BC , and refers to the passages from the Hippocratic trea-tise On the Sacred Disease 2 and, even earlier, from Sophocles, Euripides and Gorgias, where the use is evident. Thus, in principle, we have three candidates for the Derveni magoi . They could be Iranian priests. They could also be itin-erant ‘charlatans’; in other words, magoi may be a term of abuse, as it is in the passages to which Burkert refers. Finally, they may be Greek ritual experts who went by the professional name magos . Since no derogatory tone is detect-ible in the use of the term in the passage, the second possibility can be ruled out. As for the third, there is no evidence whatsoever that in the fi fth century BC there was a group of Greek priests who took on the professional name for some unknown reasons. The supposed evidence invoked by scholars is, in fact, dependent on the tendentious interpretation, as we have encountered, for instance, in Dicki’s view of Heraclitus’ magoi . That Heraclitus met with the magoi and observed their rites is a near certainty. 17 That a fi fth-century BC Pre-Socratic philosopher, very likely from Ionia, Ionian colonies on the Black Sea or further afi eld in Thrace, met with magoi is quite probable. 18 All in all, the assertion that the magoi of column 6 are anything other than what the term designates, namely Iranian priests, is yet to be substantiated. As Horky ( 2009 , pp. 63–65) has pointed out, the use of incantation ( epa ō id ē ) in rit-ual is associated in classical Greek literature with Persian religious lore (cf. Herodotus, Histories 1.132). The Derveni author compares the magi’s sacri-fi ce with that of the mystai , but not the use of incantation, which apparently differentiates the two for the author. 19 The ‘initiates’ (perhaps of Dionysus 20 ) are described as making a ‘preliminary sacrifi ce’ to the Eumenides ‘in the same manner as the magi’. ‘The magoi perform this sacrifi ce as if they make a retribution ( poin ē )’ or ‘penalty’ for a crime committed. 21 The opening line of the column seems to be a general statement about the effi cacy of rites: they can propitiate the ‘souls’. 22 If the conjunctive ‘for’ ( g à r ) in line 9 (‘For the Eumenides are souls’) is to have its causal force, one should think that the magi sacrifi ce to the ‘souls’ with the purpose or in the manner that the ‘initiates’ do to the Eumenides. The Derveni author equates the initi-ates’ ‘preliminary sacrifi ce’ to the Eumenides with the magi’s sacrifi ce to the daimones by way of explaining both recipients as ‘souls’. This shows the cor-rectness of Burkert’s restoration ( 2007 , pp. 118–19) of t à s psych á s in the fi rst line against Kouremenos’ t à s Erinys (Kouremenos 2006 , p. 167). West ( 1983 , p. 98) suggests that the Eumenides are the children of Persephone (and Apollo). The term psych á s ‘souls’ is obviously the author’s own term for the magi’s daimones and the initiates’ Eumenides. His ‘explanation’ of the two ‘mythic’ conceptions in terms of a Pre-Socratic notion is completely characteristic. This is his procedure. 23 Thus we expect that his understanding of ‘soul’ should be in keeping with his ideological outlook. Already in 1968, Burkert ( 1968 ) argued that the author’s physics depends on Anaxagoras and his followers. In an important article, Janko ( 1997 ) extensively shows that the author’s phys-ical theory is very similar to that of Diogenes of Apollonia, in particular his materialistic pantheism: Air, which Zeus is for Diogenes, pervades everything,"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"246 The magi in Heraclitus and the Derveni authoretc. Later, Janko ( 2001 ) suggests that the author is no other than the notori-ous atheist Diagoras of Melos. 24 In any case, there is unanimous agreement among students of the Derveni papyrus that its author’s cosmological out-look is thoroughly Pre-Socratic. 25 Janko’s restoration of the beginning of line 4 (‘that are vengeful souls’) may seem preferable to Burkert’s (‘being enemies of the souls’) – but see further below. In column 2, too, the author may be equating the Erinyes with ‘souls’ (Kouremenos 2006 , pp. 143–45; West 1983 , p. 81; Betegh 2004 , p. 86: only souls of the righteous; Johnston 1999 , p. 276 rejects the identifi cation; I tend to agree with Johnston). Thus, if one may trust the ostensible meaning (and obviously the restorations) of the text, the Derveni author identifi es three terms: (1) the traditional Eumenides, (2) the magi’s daimones , and (3) his own term ‘souls’, which explains the fi rst two in ‘physical’ terms. If the last one is the author’s explanatory term for the entities in question, one could plausibly think that the term daimones belongs to the religious language of the magi or is at least the Greek rendition of the original. 26 According to Burkert ( 2007 , pp. 120ff.), the magi’s rite in the Derveni text fi ts Iranian religious lore better than Greek chthonic sacrifi ces. The idea that it is only to the magi that the gods listen, that the magi alone can mediate between the gods and men, seems to be a commonplace in Greek literature on ‘Persian religion’. Herodotus ( Histories 1.132) writes: ‘and when he [who offers the sacrifi ce] has arranged it [i.e., laid out the pieces of the victim on a bed of grass], a magus who stands close by sings ( epaeidei ) a the-ogony – such do they say the incantation ( epaoid ē n ) is; for without a magus it is not their custom to sacrifi ce’. 27 W e fi nd an almost identical description seven centuries later in Diogenes Laertius, Lives 1.6: ‘the magi deal with the veneration of gods, with sacrifi ces and prayers, because, they say, they alone are heard’ by the gods. But in the Derveni text the rites of the magi are described as having a specifi c function (‘for this reason they perform the sac-rifi ce’ etc.), namely, to neutralize the daimones and make it possible for the offerings or the souls to reach their celestial destination. The Derveni author further explains that the magi’s sacrifi ce is ‘like making atonement’. Is this how the magi themselves viewed their sacrifi ce or is it the author’s assimila-tion of their rite to the Orphic-Dionysiac mysteries? 28 We fi nd the term daim ō n in another context in the Derveni papyrus. In col-umn 3, the daimones seem to be associated with the underworld and called the ‘servants’ of gods, although the text is full of lacunae and hence unreliable. 29 Most ( 1997 , pp. 131ff.) compares the magi’s daimones with the underworld guards from the gold leaves from, e.g. Hipponion, who interrogate the dead, etc. This is implausible. First, the author’s Pre-Socratic physics obliges us to place the ‘souls’ in space rather than make them the ‘guardians’ of the under-world, not to mention the import of the conjunctive ‘on their account’ in line 10, as I mentioned above. Just as the author ‘interprets’ the Orphic myth in terms of Pre-Socratic physics, he must have done the same with regard to the traditional images of the afterlife, (perhaps) found in column 3. Although the"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"The magi in Heraclitus and the Derveni author 247column is too damaged to yield a reliable text, one gets from it the impression that Hades is understood here (in accordance with the traditional account) to be a place of punishment, possibly also in column 5. In this latter col-umn, however one reconstructs and reads the text (cf. Janko 2001 , p. 20; Betegh 2004 , pp. 12–13; Kouremenos 2006 , p. 71, p. 130; Ferarri 2011 , p.74), i.e. whether the author intends to dispel or proclaim the ‘terrors of Hades’ (probably the former, contra Kouremenos), the underworld is associated with eschatological retribution, in keeping with its traditional image. Why assume that the magi’s daimones are the same as the (Greek) daimones from column 3 who reside in the underworld? The identifi cation by the author of the magoi ’s daimones and the (Pre-Socratic) ‘souls’ in column 6 tells us at least that here the former too must be imagined in space and not in Hades, 30 where the ‘souls’ hinder the passage of the sacrifi cial offering to heavens. In other words, the obstruction the magoi ’s daimones cause would have to be understood as one between mortals and heaven. 31 In Plato, Symposium 202e–203a, the daim ō n is an intermediate being between god and mortal and plays the role of the ‘interpreter and ferryman’ between the two, conveying, among other things, the ‘craft of the priest’ con-cerning ‘rites’ ( teletas ) and ‘incantations’ ( ep ō das ), and ‘divinations’ ( man-teian ) and ‘wizardry’ ( go ē teian ). All these are placed on the same level: the ‘whole science of divination’, which is the affair of the daimones . Aristotle, too, places dreams in the sphere of activity of the daim ō n : just as for Plato ( Symposium 203e) there cannot be any direct contact between man and god, and the extraordinary knowledge of the mantis (the basis of his ‘sacred craft’) is ‘daemonic’, so, too, for Aristotle ( Div. per somnum 463 B 12–15), dream as a mode of contact with the invisible is not divine but daemonic. 32 From a fragment of Xenocrates, the second scholarch of the Academy after Plato’s nephew Speusippus, one learns that the daimones may be mischievous agents just as they are in the supposed Pythagorean text reported by Alexander Polyhistor. 33 The archaic idea of the daim ō n having irruptive ‘miraculous contact with mortal beings’ 34 is perhaps the background of the ‘mediat-ing daim ō n ’. In any case, since the author’s outlook is Pre-Socratic, the in-between place of the magi’s daimones cannot depend on Plato, 35 although it evokes for us Diotima’s daimones in the Symposium . It is, on the other hand, probable that Plato’s conception of the soul and the connection he makes between moral virtue and spiritual fulfi lment have an Orphic-Pythagorean background. 36 Plato’s idea of the daim ō n as the intermediary between men and gods is already present in the Pythagorean cultic hierarchy of the kreit-tones . The constellation of an apotropaic rite directed at the daimones under-stood as vengeful souls of the dead is quite peculiar and probably limited to Pythagorean lore. 37 Admittedly this is very close to what is said about the magoi ’s daimones in column 6, but there is no reason to make the author a proponent of Pythagoreanism. For him, the magoi ’s daim ō n cannot already mean ‘soul’, for if it did, why his glossing it as ‘soul’? His gloss may well draw on the popular Greek notion that the daimones are souls of the dead, which"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"248 The magi in Heraclitus and the Derveni authorwas favourably received by some Pre-Socratics, among others. 38 Again, the Derveni author systematically recasts received religious ideas, whether Orphic or ‘magian’, in terms of Pre-Socratic (e.g. Anaxogorean 39 ) ‘physics’. On the other hand, as I have already mentioned, the word daim ō n was regularly used in the sense of a strange or foreign god . This sense seems to be current espe-cially in the language that we can plausibly connect with the mystery cults and Orphic circles. 40 In the magi’s view, the daimones are (foreign) divine beings that intervene in a specifi c human sphere; the magi are able to propitiate them by way of sacrifi ce. In the Derveni author’s view, the magi’s daimones are the ‘(vengeful) souls’ of the dead. Contrary to Tsantsanoglou (in Kouremenos 2006 , p. 167), the magi’s dai-mones that the author compares with the Eumenides cannot be the Iranian frava š\u0004 is . There is no evidence in Iranian sources that the ‘external souls’ of faithful Zoroastrians place themselves in space and ‘obstruct’ the path to the divine sphere. The connection with the underworld (the magi are said to pour the choai , which is the Greek libation to the underworld powers, as opposed to the spondai made to the Olympian gods) does not necessarily make the magi’s daimones souls of the dead, which in any case the frava š is are not. 41 In the Avesta, ritual incantation has the power to mark out the path to the beyond 42 and remove the obstruction that the da ē vas pose to the soul on its way to the divine sphere (‘the path of a š\u0004 a ’). 43 In Y 55, the G ā th ā s and the Staota Yesniia (the central part of the Yasna collection containing the G ā th ā s and the Yasna Hapta ŋ h ā iti 44 ) are described as the ‘guardians and protectors’ of the soul, with ‘the power to smash obstructions’, but also as ‘the givers of good reward, the givers of abundant reward, the givers of the reward of a š\u0004 a , for the beyond, after the parting of consciousness and the body’. In the G ā th ā s (Y 32.1), the da ē vas approach Mazd ā with the request to be his ‘messengers’ ( dūta- ), that is to say, the supreme god’s gatekeepers. They have pretension to the control of access to the god’s abode. In Y 44.16 Zarathu š tra asks Mazd ā : k ə̄ v ə r ə θ r ə̄ m.j ā θβ ā p ō i s ə̄ n \u0004 gh ā y ō i h ə n \u0004 t ī ‘which divine smasher of obstacle is there to protect (me) in accordance with your declaration?’ The poet, in the process of acquir-ing his true knowledge, e.g. by way of incubatory divination (Y 30.3, 34.5), needs divine protection just as much as the soul does, since both are separated from the body and directly exposed to supernatural powers. 45 The departing soul, too, on its way to the ‘sun-drenched domain of a š\u0004 a ’ (Y 16.7 x v anuuait ī š a š\u0004 ahe + v ə r ə z ō ) requires the protection of the (ritual) recitation of holy texts in the face of the ‘obstacle’ that the da ē vas constitute. The judgement whether one should be satisfi ed with a Greek genealogy of the magi’s daim ō n as it appears in the Derveni text depends to some extent on how one interprets the rather particular role ascribed to it. The equation of the magi’s daimones with the traditional Erinyes from column 3 is problematic, and in my view, unacceptable (contra Betegh 2004 , p. 88). In columns 3 and 4 (although hopelessly lacunose) the Erinyes seem to carry out some kind of ‘Heraclitean’ cosmological function and perhaps also an eschatological role, i.e. punishing the souls of the unjust men (col. 3): ‘Dike punishes pernicious"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"The magi in Heraclitus and the Derveni author 249men through each of the Erinyes’ (Kouremenos 2006 , p. 129). 46 One way or another (see Kouremenos 2006 , p, 147), the Erinyes are divine functionaries or perhaps even Zeus’ agents, just as they are the servants of Dike in Heraclitus (col. 4). The punitive function of the Erinyes in column 3 (?) and column 4 seems to be in the service of the cosmic ruler, and again reminds one of their traditional role, also found in Pythagoreanism. 47 As opposed to the daimones of column 3, 48 the magoi ’s daimones are active in space on their own account. There is no reason to deny the obviously Zoroastrian sense of the ‘hindering daimones ’ where the Derveni author explicitly attributes the lore to the magoi and where no Greek evidence exists for the idea that the daimones , taking up space between the earth and heaven, can obstruct the path between men and gods. One will recall the role of gatekeeper that the da ē vas want to take on themselves in the G ā th ā s (Y 32.1); and if the protection the faithful seeks for his soul (in its ascent to heaven) in Y 55 should be understood against this G ā thic background, the ‘obstacle breaking’ Staota Yesniia (Y 55.3), that is, the priest’s incantation of the sacred text, removes no obstruction other than that of the da ē vas . 49 But there remains the Derveni author’s puzzling gloss, ‘paying a pen-alty’: ‘the magi perform the sacrifi ce, just as if they are paying a retribution’ (Kouremenos 2006 , p. 130). The notion of atonement in this context immedi-ately recalls the Orphic myth of Dionysus and the mysteries more generally. But if so, one is at once faced with a few questions. First of all, is the object of the magoi ’s concern the soul of the dead, rather than simply sacrifi cial offerings to the gods? The magoi perform the sacrifi ce in order to remove the daimones , who are, according to one restoration, ‘hostile to souls’ 50 – remove them from the path of the ascending souls. However one reads the missing words (‘avenging souls’ or ‘hostile to souls’), it seems almost certain that the object of the magoi ’s rite is the soul of the dead. How else can one inter-pret the crucial ‘as if they are paying a penalty’, where the author explicitly equates in function the magoi ’s rite with the initiates’ ‘preliminary sacrifi ce’? The background here must be the Orphic myth of the murder of Dionysus by the Titans and the resulting penalty falling due to each mortal. 51 In the mysteries, the soul of the dead does not ascend to the heavens, however, but descends to the underworld. One could invoke the Pre-Socratic frame of the author and argue that he has changed the destination of the soul in accord-ance with his interpretive frame: psych ē is made of the same substance as the heavenly aither and, after its separation from the body, ascends to join the divine element. 52 The chthonic libations ( choas ) are not necessarily made to the dead. Generally speaking, the absence of wine and perhaps an altar where the libation can be poured are characteristics of the libations poured for the dead. 53 But the same type of libation is offered to the powers of the under-world in Greek sacrifi ce. It is much more reasonable to compare the daimones , who are entitled to receive a compensation, with the mystery gods rather than with souls of the dead. Finally, one cannot be sure that the preliminary sacri-fi ce to the Eumenides in the manner of the magi further describes the sacrifi ce"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"250 The magi in Heraclitus and the Derveni authorthat is understood by the author as paying a penalty. It looks like the author is comparing the magi’s rituals with the mysteries in respect of one of the constituents of the magi’s sacrifi ce that may be understood as compensation. Certainly, the Derveni author is not giving a systematic account of the magi’s rite or the mystery cults but expounding his own views, here, in reference to one or another aspect of the two rituals that he compares. But if one grants a continuity of thought in the author’s description, the basis of compari-son of the respective sacrifi ces must be their perceived common purpose. The magi’s sacrifi ce to the obstructive daimones compares with or evokes for the author the initiates’ rite (‘preliminary sacrifi ce’), which has an expiatory or propitiatory intent. Given the general comparison with the mysteries and in particular the gloss that the magi perform the sacrifi ce as if they are paying a penalty, the object of their concern must be the psych ē rather than offerings to the gods. The context of the fi rst columns, too, seems to point to death and the afterlife. 54 The idea of paying a penalty to supernatural powers in order to ensure a bet-ter afterlife comes from the Orphic-Dionysiac mysteries. 55 Now, the Derveni author says that the magi perform their sacrifi ce ‘like’ or ‘as if ’ ( h ō sperei ) they are paying a penalty. It is certain that it is the author who is likening the magi’s sacrifi ce to ‘paying a penalty’. And he does it presumably on the basis of the perceived similarity of the eschatological aims of the two rituals, namely the magi’s rite and the mysteries. According to this picture, then, in the Derveni author’s view, the magi perform their sacrifi ce in order to remove the ‘hinder-ing’ daimones from the path of the ascending souls. The magi, apparently, not only used ‘incantation’ ( ep ō id ē ) but also made ‘offerings’, e.g. ‘many-knobbed cakes’, and ‘libations’ of ‘milk and water’ both on the ground and on the offerings. If this is a genuine description of the magi’s rite, one would have to conclude that the daimones are not treated by them simply as hostile powers that must be eliminated (a situation reminiscent of Y 55.2–3) but as powers that have disposition over the fate of the soul, or at any rate over its passage to the beyond, and thus must be somehow accommodated. The magi propiti-ate and remove the hindering daimones with a sacrifi ce that includes ‘incan-tation’. This picture generally squares with the G ā thic data on the da ē vas , although, of course, the G ā thic poet is not into the business of propitiating the hindering da ē vas . Nonetheless, as we saw, there is in the G ā th ā s a clear indication of the power that the da ē vas were believed to have exercised over the soul in its passage to the beyond. The Derveni author identifi es the function of the magoi ’s ritual with that of the mysteries: both are eschatological. 56 The identifi cation of the ‘hindering daimones ’ with ‘hostile souls’ must refl ect the author’s Pre-Socratic perspec-tive, in which the departing psych ē is viewed as immortal and ascending, alien to Homeric religion. Therefore, space may become an object of eschatological concern and target of ritual intervention. ‘Mysteries had taught comparable ideas as a secret: the divine origin of man and his goal of unity with the div-ine. This now becomes explicit through natural philosophy, with a claim to"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"The magi in Heraclitus and the Derveni author 251objective truth’ (Burkert 1985 , p. 320). 57 The idea of an ascent to heaven by the soul facilitated by some form of sacrifi ce in the face of ‘hindering’ super-natural beings comes from Iranian religious thought. 58 It is quite possible that the author actually met with the magoi , in Asia Minor or Thrace. One way or another, the Derveni author’s description of the magoi ’s rite must be authen-tic. His interpretation of the rite, e.g. ‘as if paying a penalty’, is a different matter, as we saw. I have pointed to a number of texts from the Avesta where it is plainly stated that the da ē vas seize nocturnal sacrifi cial offerings. It is true that no explicit mention is made of the nocturnal nature of the magoi ’s rite in the Derveni papyrus, but the comparison with the mysteries may very well imply it. Not only the Eleusinian mysteries but also those of Dionysus and Isis were held at night. 59 Ritual incantation is a characteristic feature of Persian sacrifi ce in classical Greek literature. In the Avesta, the recitation of certain texts (Staota Yesniia) ‘breaks the obstacle’ that the da ē vas pose to the soul on its way to heaven. 60 There is no reason to see in the magoi of the papyrus any-thing other than what the name denotes: Iranian ritual experts. Scholars who deny the Iranian identity are yet to produce a convincing account of their claims. On the other hand, the particular features of the rite underwrite what the name magos avers. Notes 1 See Marcovich 1967 , pp. 465–67; Graf 1997 , p. 21, with references in note 8 ; and Horky 2009 , pp. 51–55. Marcovich’s argument ( 1967 , p. 466) for deletion of the magi from the list is similar to the one I consider below. 2 See West 1971 , pp. 111–202, who argues for certain similarities between a number of ideas in Heraclitus’ fragments and those of Indo-Iranian religious lore. If one is reluctant to talk about ‘infl uence’, the similarities at least demonstrate a shared ideological horizon. There is then all the less reason to assume that Heraclitus mis-understood the magi’s rite in question, as Nock ( 1972 , p. 311, p. 318) does. See also Kirk 1954 , pp. 37–46 on the notion of logos in Heraclitus as the common formula of things and behaviour. It takes Heraclitus to articulate this basic formula, what ‘the rest of men fail to notice’ (DK 1). ‘The explanation of all things... involves the con-sideration and defi nition of separate instances... and this suggests that the physis of a thing, that which governs its behaviour, will testify to the universal application of the Logos; but by the time the examination of individual structure takes place the intuition of the Logos has already occurred’ (Kirk 1954 , p. 43). Heraclitus is a ‘prophet’. On physis see Kirk 1954 , pp. 228–29. See also Morgan 2000 , pp. 53ff. 3 It is not entirely clear from the Greek text whether Heraclitus condemns the mystic initiation as such or objects to a certain manner of performing it. Guthrie ( 1962 , p. 476) and Kirk et al. ( 1984 , p. 209) understand it in the latter sense. 4 See my discussion of his thesis regarding the ‘Persian origin’ of magic below. 5 See Dickie 2001 , p. 41. He continues after a few lines: ‘it is not to be doubted that persons either calling themselves magoi or who were thought to be magoi must have appeared in the Greek world. Their connections with anything Persian may have been slight to the point of vanishing. What they certainly fastened on and exploited were the possibilities presented by offering initiation into the mysteries. In other words, they exploited what was, however they may have presented it, an essentially Greek institution’ (Dickie 2001 , p. 41)."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"252 The magi in Heraclitus and the Derveni author 6 ‘We may surmise that the impiety Heraclitus saw in these ceremonies of initiation lay in part in their being performed privately and apart from the cults that the city sanctioned’ (Dickie 2001 , p. 29). 7 See Marcovich 1967 , pp. 465–67 and my discussion of DK 15 further in the text. Compare Morgan 2000 , pp. 57–60. 8 West ( 1983 , p. 82) dates it to around the end of the fi fth century: ‘He seems to stand in the same tradition as that other Anaxagorean allegorist, Metrodorus of Lampsacus: not necessarily as early, but scarcely generations later’. Burkert dates it to 420–400 BC and thinks it is from the pen of one of the intellectuals of the time. Janko believes this intellectual is the famous atheist Diagoras of Melos (Janko 2001 ). 9 See West 1983 for a detailed analysis of the Orphic poems. According to West 1983 , pp. 80–82, the ‘preposterous commentator’ of the Derveni text uses the Orphic theogony as a pretext to expound his own views. A more balanced approach is found in Most 1997 : ‘the focus of previous scholarship upon problems of detail, upon the commentator’s physics, and upon the Orphic theogony has led to a rel-ative neglect of another, no less fundamental aspect of the papyrus: namely the continuity and integrity of the Derveni text itself. What is the argument of the Derveni papyrus? How do its parts cohere? How are we to understand the over-all structure and ultimate purpose of its allegorical exegesis?’ (Most 1997 , p. 119). 10 See Kouremenos et al. 2006 and Betegh 2004 . 11 The Greek text has: ἐπ [ ωιδὴ δ ] ὲ (Kouremenos et al. 2006 , p. 73). The same restor-ation is found in Betegh 2004 , p. 14; Janko 2001 , p. 20; Burkert 2007 , pp. 117–18 n. 78. 12 Tsantsanoglou and Par á ssoglou (in Kouremenous et al. 2006 , p. 130) have ‘liba-tions to the dead’ for χοὰς , i.e. chthonic libations. 13 Tsantsanoglou and Par á ssoglou (in Kouremenous et al. 2006 , p. 130) have ‘On their account’. 14 Tsantsanoglou’s and Par á ssoglou’s translation (in Kouremenous et al. 2006 , p. 130) is slightly altered. Bernab é ( 2010 , p. 82) translates the last line: ‘Hence a person who intends to sacrifi ce to the gods, fi rst must liberate a bird, with whom they fl y, with the result that the evil (?)...’ Betegh ( 2004 , p. 15) has: ‘On account of these, he who is going to sacrifi ce to the gods, fi rst birdlike... and the... (they) are... as many as...’ 15 See Bernab é 2010 , p. 78 n.4. 16 Kouremenos et al. ( 2006 , p. 167) writes: ‘there is no compelling reason to see in the magi and their cultic practices a reference to Persian priests and their cultic prac-tices’. This is an odd statement. What are the compelling reasons not to see Iranian priests in the magi against the ostensible evidence of the name? 17 See Papatheophanes 1985 , pp. 154–58. 18 Compare Burkert 2007 , p. 117: ‘That Empedocles met with magi is intrinsically plausible, even if no fragment of his can be found to prove it’. See also Kingsley 1995 , pp. 185ff. 19 Compare Burkert 2007 , pp. 117–21. 20 But see Henrichs ( 1984 , p. 267), who thinks it more likely that the ‘initiates’ are those of Eleusis. Zuntz ( 1971 , pp. 407–11) dismisses the reality of chthonic Dionysus. ‘Dionysos was, to many of his devotees, a giver of life after death; they expected to follow him in an eternal kosmos; perhaps on earth or perhaps in some other, mys-tic realm – but not in Hades... No “chthonic Dionysos”, then, can be assumed to have met the bearers of the Gold Leaves in the realm of Persephone’ (Zuntz 1971 , p. 411). It is well known that Greek gods developed (multiple) cultic characteristics. Trophonius, who gave incubatory oracles at Lebadea, was Ze ù s Chth ó nios , and Epimenides met this Zeus ‘in the bowels of the earth’ (Burkert 1972 , p. 154). See"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"The magi in Heraclitus and the Derveni author 253also Detienne 1999 , pp. 63–64: ‘The consultation took the form of a descent into Hades’ (Detienne 1999 , p. 63). ‘More than any other Greek god, Dionysus lacks a consistent identity. Duality, contrast and reversal are his hallmark’ (Henrichs 1981 , p. 158). Where did the Orphic (chthonic) Dionysus ‘reside’? We do not know; but this is hardly the point. The god is characteristically a-topian, always in transit and crossing boundaries, the god of advent. See Parker 2005 , pp. 302–303; Zeitlin 2002 , pp. 209–14. The relation with Persephone and the fact that it was Dionysus who released the initiate from the burden of the ‘ancient guilt’ and thus made pos-sible a blissful existence in the underworld mark the god of the Orphic-Dionysiac mysteries as ‘chthonic’. The incubatory nature of divination at Lebadea makes the god ‘chthonic’ through the identity of Sleep and Death (cf. Xenophon, Cyropaedia 8.7.21), e.g. both provide access to the ‘true’ knowledge of the invisible. In the same way, the direct involvement of the god Dionysus, through genealogy and fate of his followers after death, makes him ‘chthonic’, for there cannot be any doubt that the afterlife unfolded in the underworld – no matter where the god himself was imagined to reside (Graf and Johnston 2007 , pp. 94–136). According to the Rhapsodies , human souls ‘spend three hundred years in the other world and then are reborn (231). But their aim is to achieve release from the round of misery. Zeus has ordered purifi cation ceremonies to go forth from Crete (156), and Dionysus has been appointed with Kore to assist mankind to fi nd their release through regu-lar sacrifi ces and rites (229, 230, 232)’ (West 1983 , p. 75; the numbers in brackets refer to the fragments). Betegh ( 2004 , pp. 82–83) maintains that ‘there is no reason to restrict the application of the term to the Eleusinian initiates in the Derveni papyrus’ (Betegh 2004 , p. 83). 21 See Kouremenos et al. 2006 , pp. 72–73, pp. 166–71. 22 See West 1983 , pp. 78–79 and Janko 2001 , pp. 2–6. 23 See Most 1997 and Betegh 2004 , pp. 224–77. 24 See Betegh’s criticisms of Janko’s hypothesis in Betegh 2004 , pp. 373–80. Betegh in turn tries to show that ‘the Derveni author is closer to Archelaus than he is either to Anaxagoras or to Diogenes’ (Betegh 2004 , p. 321). 25 On the Pre-Socratics, see Guthrie 1962 , pp. 62–71, pp. 83–106, pp. 132–39; Guthrie 1965 , pp. 294–317, pp. 362–81, 1994 ; Betegh 2004 , pp. 278–324. See also Laks 1997 , pp. 126ff., who emphasizes the role of Heraclitus, whose importance for the author, according to Laks, was his relating Pre-Socratic physics to eschatology. 26 Prior to the fi fth century BC, the word daim ō n does not specify a class of divine beings but uncanny powers that directly affect and sometimes overwhelm mortals. Dreams and illnesses were thought to be daimones ; later the latter were distin-guished from the phenomena they had signifi ed and became the agents respon-sible for them (Detienne 1963 , pp. 43–48). Oedipus (Sophocles, Oedipus at Colonus 788) curses Thebes: his ‘polluting daim ō n ’ will haunt the city ‘for ever’. The word seems to mean vengeful spirit. The fact that it will be, like the person it survives, ‘polluting’ shows it is personalized. Another conception of the daim ō n is repre-sented in Hesiod, Works and Days 122: the dead of the golden generation of men who ‘lived like gods’ while alive become benefi cent daimones after death by Zeus’ design. In Hesiod, Theogony c. 990, Phaeton is represented after his death as a daim ō n that receives cult. The term obviously implies the immortality of the soul of the hero and those of the fi rst human generation. See Nagy 1999 , p. 191. In Pythagoreanism the daim ō n is more or less equated with immortal psych ē or per-haps the divine part of the soul. It is the task of the Pythagorean ask ē sis to purify the demonic soul. See Detienne 1963 , pp. 60ff., esp. pp. 78–85. Finally, the word is regularly used of foreign or new gods. ‘The word daim ô n retains, throughout Greek tradition from the Homeric poems to the very end, its meaning as a synonym of theos , but it also has its own specifi c nuances’ (Sfameni Gasparro 1997 , p. 71)."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"254 The magi in Heraclitus and the Derveni authorIn Eudexus of Cnidus, Ohrmazd and Ahriman are daimones , which he identifi es with Zeus, the god of light, and Hades, the god of infernal darkness. See Bidez and Cumont 1973 , pp. 11–12. It is also in the sense of a ‘new’, and hence fake, god that the term is frequently used in the Bacchae , e.g. 256, 481. We also fi nd a related but somewhat different usage in the play, implying direct contact with mor-tals. This may be the basis of Plutarch’s opinion about the origin of the doctrine of the intermediary status of the daimones between gods and men, expressed in passing in On the Disappearance of Oracles 415a5–7: ‘Perhaps the doctrine derives from the magi, followers of Zoroaster, or perhaps it is Thracian, and derives from Orpheus – or it may be Egyptian – or Phrygian’. In the Bacchae 22 Dionysus says he intended to be an emphan ē s daim ō n ‘god manifest’ to men. The god’s epiph-any is fundamental to his character in the play and underlies his function in the mysteries. Compare Versnel 1990 , pp. 158–59 n. 246: ‘it appears that daim ō n is particularly used in cases of a specifi c and unique action by a god with special ref-erence to the speaker... later developments of the term always imply the notion: “miraculous contact with mortal beings”. This is, of course, very characteristic of Dionysos in the Bacchae . Thus the term acquires a truly ambiguous meaning, combining the negative elements of contemporary fake gods, who are as a rule referred to as daimones , and the awe-inspiring aspects of its authentic meaning in Homer and elsewhere’. This last sense of daim ō n seems to be a development of the fi rst, i.e. supernatural intervention. Janko ( 1997 , p. 92) maintains that the ‘Derveni papyrus professes a belief in daimones which uncannily resembles Socrates’ daimo-nion ’. The basis of this assertion escapes me. See also Gordon 1999 , pp. 224–29. 27 Translation comes from De Jong 1997 , pp. 117–18, slightly altered; see his com-ments in De Jong 1997 , pp. 117–18. Compare Cantera 2012 , p. 226. 28 On the designation ‘Orphic-Dionysiac’ see Graf and Johnston 2007 , pp. 142–43. 29 Tsantsanoglou and Par á ssoglou give the following text: ‘... below... each (masc.) acquires a daimon as healer... For Dike punishes pernicious men through each of the Erinyes. And the daimons who are in the underworld never observe [sleep? rest?] and, being servants of gods, they... all (masc.), ... are [mindful?] so that unjust men..., and are responsible for... such as (masc. pl.)...’ (Kouremenos et al. 2006 , p. 129). According to Betegh ( 2004 , p. 87), the category of the Erinyes in column 3 is either coextensive with or included in the wider category of daimones . In tragedy, the daim ō n often represents the spirit of vengeance and is thus the equivalent of the Erinys, which is itself either ‘malediction under mythic form’ or the ‘executor of malediction’ (Detienne 1963 , pp. 87–88). One should not forget that the ‘categories’ (e.g. in column 3), whatever their supposed relation, are not those of the Derveni author. One cannot infer the meaning and reference of the magi’s daimones in column 6 from the occurrence of the term daimones in column 3, which, given the author’s outlook and procedure, must be placed in scare quotes in his text. See my remarks on Most 1997 in the text. 30 Betegh ( 2004 , p. 346) implicitly admits this: ‘in all those systems where there is a cosmic intelligence posited, the individual soul (or the most valuable, rational, divine part of it) shares in the basic nature of the cosmic intelligence. This pat-tern is certainly present in the respective systems of those philosophers who had the most impact on the Derveni author: Anaxagoras, Diogenes of Apollonia and Heraclitus. Moreover, the most evident form of this scheme is where the cosmic intelligence manifests itself in one of the physical elements; in this case the soul (or the most elevated form or part of it) is characterised by the same element... If so, the author’s souls must have at least a component of air in them... the Eumenides are expressly identifi ed as souls (the souls of the righteous?) in col. 6... it follows that, for the Derveni author, the Erinyes are airy souls’. 31 Pythagoreans believed that ‘the whole air is full of souls: the motes in the air which one sees dancing in a ray of sunlight are indeed souls; Pythagoreans"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"The magi in Heraclitus and the Derveni author 255marvel at a man who believes he has never encountered a daimon ’ (Burkert 1985 , p. 303). See also Burkert 1972 , pp. 185–87 and Guthrie 1962 , pp. 282–318. The Pythagorean cultic hierarchy of the kreittones ‘powerful supernatural beings’, the gods, daimones and heroes, also assigns them corresponding regions of the cos-mos, respectively, heaven, space and earth. The daimones never had a role in the offi cial religious life of the polis . There are indications, however, that their cultic status in Pythagorean thought refl ects archaic religious conceptions about them. They are equated in this context with the souls of the dead, and apparently their cult could take the form either of apotrop ē or of therapeia . The text cited by Alexander Polyhistor seems to confi rm the conception of daimones as trouble-some souls that have to be propitiated. ‘The whole air is full of souls which are called daimones or heroes. It is they who send men dreams, signs and illnesses, and not just to men but also to sheep and other small domestic herd animals. It is to these daimones that one addresses purifi cations and apotropaic rites, and those of divination and the like’ (Diogenes Laertius Lives 8.32, translation altered). This conception seems similar to the Derveni author’s picture of the magi’s rite, but there are also important differences between the two. The archaic concern with the life of the community in this passage is to be contrasted with the eschato-logical concern with the fate of the soul in column 6 of the Derveni papyrus. See Detienne 1963 , pp. 32–42. Incidentally, the ‘Pythagorean’ passage is incongruous with both the Pythagorean doctrine of metempsychosis and that of the ‘demonic soul’. 32 See Detienne 1963 , pp. 45–46. 33 The fragment is found in Plutarch De Iside 25.361b: Xenocrates thought that ‘unlucky days and such festivals as involve scourgings or lamentations or fastings or blasphemies or foul language belong to the honouring neither of gods nor of good daimones , but that there are great and strong beings in the atmosphere, mal-evolent and morose, who rejoice in such things’. The terms in which the ‘festivals’ are described point to initiation ceremonies. 34 See Versnel 1990 , pp. 158–63. 35 See Graf and Johnston 2007 , pp. 149. 36 In the Phaedo 67 Plato recommends practice of moral virtues as the only way to escape the trammel of bodily existence and achieve the spiritual contemplation of ‘ideal’ reality. Even death does not dissolve the pollution of bodily desires for the person who was not virtuous while alive. Postmortem bliss depends on moral purifi cation in life. Plato transposes the ideology of the mysteries from the rit-ual sphere to the moral one, but the mystery background is transparent. Perhaps somewhat tongue-in-cheek, Plato ( Phaedo 69c) writes: ‘And I fancy that those men who established the mysteries were not unenlightened, but in reality had a hid-den meaning when they said long ago that whoever goes uninitiated and unsanc-tifi ed to the other world will lie in the mire, but he who arrives there initiated and purifi ed will dwell with the gods’. Note the ‘promise’ of the mysteries in the last phrase. Compare Kingsley 1995 , pp. 79–148: ‘while the physical foundation for the Phaedo myth is chiefl y Sicilian, its mythical foundation now appears to be Orphic. In short, the myth arose out of the soil of Sicily and Italy and took the form of an Orphic poem written, used, interpreted, and eventually transmitted to Plato by western Pythagoreans. The signifi cance of this sequence can hardly be overes-timated. For one thing, the interrelation between the categories of “Orphic” and “Pythagorean” is graphically demonstrated. For another thing, habits die hard, and in spite of the evidence of the Derveni papyrus it is still normal to fi nd the allegorizing of Orphic poetry and mythology as a primarily Neoplatonic phenom-enon. Here, however, we have the allegorizing interpretation of Orphic literature not only attested before Plato’s time, but actually feeding into and creating the Platonic myths themselves’ (Kingsley 1995 , p. 126). See Betegh 2004 , p. 339 on"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"256 The magi in Heraclitus and the Derveni authorPlato’s story of Er of Pamphylia in the fi nal book of the Republic : ‘Plato incorpo-rated many Orphico-Pythagorean elements in the story of Er’. 37 See Detienne 1963 , pp. 93ff. 38 See, for instance, Sfameni Gasparro 1997 . 39 See Janko 1997 , p. 70. 40 Compare Versnel 1990 , pp. 158–89. 41 It is very likely that the Derveni author thought that the magi’s daimones were really souls of the dead, and that the point of the sacrifi ce and libations, or the pre-liminary sacrifi ce, was to ‘appease’ them, as he states in the opening statement of the column. But the magi’s view, recoverable in my mind from the author’s descrip-tion and interpretive procedure, does not coincide with his. Thus, I do not agree with Graf ’s resolution of the magi’s perspective: ‘The magoi offered cakes and libations of water and milk as part of a sacrifi ce that they perform “as if they were paying a penalty”; the aim of their rite was to placate dead souls that might other-wise “be in the way”. The rite of the magoi , then, is purifi catory and heals damage done by vengeful ghosts’ (Graf and Johnston 2007 , p. 149). But the daimones are where and ‘in the way’ of what? 42 The same idea is found in the Vedic thought. See Malamoud 2002 , p. 24: ‘Entre Yama qui a vu et fait le chemin et les po è tes qui ont vu, é labor é et é nonc é les po è mes du Veda, il n’y a pas seulement une analogie: le chemin vers l’au-del à est aussi œ uvre de langage; il est fait des paroles que les survivants doivent pronon-cer pour que le d é funt accomplisse sa transformation en P è re et parvienne à sa destination’. 43 See most recently Kellens 2011 , pp. 74–79, pp. 99–103, pp. 119–20. For Kellens the ‘combat antid é moniaque’ is directed in the yasna service at the protection of the material world. The combat is the principal role of Srao š a in the rite. But the martial aspect ‘ é chappe au r é seau des sources g â thiques, probablement parce que les G â th â s sont moins obs é d é es par les d é mons’ (Kellens 2011 , p. 76). If ‘obsession’ means ‘importance’, one has to disagree with his assessment of the status of the da ē vas in the G ā th ā s. 44 See Kellens 1996 ; Cantera 2009 . 45 The intimate connection between sleep and death must be an Indo-European phe-nomenon. I have already referred to some evidence from Greek and Indic mater-ial. Bodewitz ( 1999 , p. 115) concludes his important article on the underworld in the Atharvaveda by ‘draw[ing] attention to the association of sleep or dream and death. Yama is sleep’s lord and Varun \u0004 a’s wife bore sleep (AV. 6,46,1). The bad dream should be given to the enemy, but the good dream is the agent of Yama (19, 57, 3). However, in AV. 16,5 svapna (sleep) is associated with all kinds of evil... and is still called the agent of Yama. It is not only Yama who is equated with sleep and dreams. ŚB. 12, 9, 2, 2 directly identifi es the Pitr \u0005 s with sleep (and men with being awake)’. 46 Compare, however, Janko’s and Betegh’s translations: ‘... Erinyes... But (a) dai-mon comes into existence for each one... persons who are wiped out... But those below (are called?) daimons..., and do not have (?)... of (the?) gods, but are called servants... they are, like wicked men who are punished with death, and they are responsible... such (persons) as... initiate’ (Janko 2001 , p. 18); ‘... daimon becomes to each... destroyed utterly... the daimones beneath... receive... and are called assistants of the gods... (they) are, like unjust men... and they are responsible... such as... initiate’ (Betegh 2004 , p. 9). The comparison shows how unsound it is to want to say anything meaningful about the relation between the Erinyes and the daimones in column 3. 47 Deprived of access to the highest regions of heaven, impure souls are bound in irrefragable chains by the Erinyes (in Diogenes Laertius, Lives 8.31). See Detienne 1963 , p. 49."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"The magi in Heraclitus and the Derveni author 257 48 See Most 1997 , p. 126; Betegh 2004 , pp. 87–88; Kouremenos et al. 2006 , p. 129. The idea of daim ō n as ‘divine agent intervening in human affairs’ is recurrent throughout ancient Greek history from Homer onwards: in lyric poetry, tragedy, the historians and orators. See Sfameni Gasparro 1997 , p. 71 for references. 49 Compare Cantera 2012 , pp. 226–27. 50 See Most 1997 , p. 131. 51 See Betegh 2004 , pp. 349ff. 52 See Burkert 1985 , pp. 319–320. ‘The association of soul and heaven, which had probably received impulse from Iranian eschatology, could easily be combined with this [i.e., the Pythagorean doctrine of metempsychosis]: soul is heavenly mat-ter’ (Burkert 1985 , pp. 319–20). Plato’s famous description of the ascent of the soul in Phaedrus 246a–249b seems to have an Iranian background in a particu-lar sense: not just in the notion of the immortal soul aspiring to reach the divine sphere beyond the sky, but also in the image of the soul’s chariot being pulled by two horses, one good and one wicked, one pulling upward, the other downward, etc., that is to say, in the idea of an ethical dualism that bears on the fate of the soul. ‘Many and blessed are the sights and the movements in the sky where the race of blessed gods moves, each performing his own function; there follows whoever will and can; for jealousy stands outside the chorus of the gods... That place above the sky as yet none of the earthly poets has sung, and never will one sing it wor-thily... The uncoloured, unshaped, untouched being that truly “is”, which is only to be beheld by nous , the guider of the soul, the being with which the kind of true knowledge has to do, this is what occupies this place’ (translation from Burkert 1985 , p. 324). One can only be amazed at the similarity of Plato’s ‘mind’ ( nous ), the ‘guider of the soul’ ( psych ē s kybern ē t ē s ), and the G ā thic Y 31.17 mazd ā - , the ‘guider of good thinking’ ( va ŋ h ə̄ u š fradax š t ā mana ŋ h ō ), both in a dualistic setting and with an apparent eschatological function (cf. Y 51.3). 53 Henrichs’ suggestion ( 1984 , pp. 264ff.) to connect the magi’s libations with the Eleusinian pl ē moch ó ai faces the problem that the latter are made in the last day of the celebrations. 54 See Most 1997 , pp. 127ff. Burkert’s general interpretation of the passage com-pletely removes the magi’s sacrifi ce from the frame of comparison with the mys-teries. ‘The ultimate aim in all these actions must be to get into contact with the god or gods. This is the function of sacrifi ce and prayer. But this can be achieved only through the well-informed dealings with the intermediate powers, as known by the magi’ (Burkert 2007 , p. 119). This last idea, despite the fact that in abstracto it makes sense, fi nds no support in Iranian religious lore; as far as I know, it is also alien to the Greek views of sacrifi ce. It is hard to tell what telestic ritual, known from elsewhere, is behind the author’s ‘preliminary sacrifi ce’. Betegh ( 2004 , p. 87) considers it possible that what the daimones are supposed to receive, according to Janko’s restoration, in column 3 is ‘the soul of the recently deceased’. Russell ( 2001 ) argues that the magi’s rite described in the Derveni text is the Zoroastrian Satūm service in honour of the dead. 55 See Graf and Johnston 2007 . The myth of chthonic Dionysus, born from Persephone and killed by the Titans, the ancestors of humans ‘is explicitly con-nected with the mysteries by several authors, and it seems that Herodotus consid-ered it a secret although he has several allusions to it. Later texts treat it as just part of normal mythology’ (Burkert 1987 , p. 73). Burkert ( 1987 , p. 73 n. 38) mentions a number of ancient authors. I do not fi nd Seaford’s suggestion ( 1986 , p. 8) that the ‘penalty’ Persephone accepts in Pindar fr. 133 consists in the ‘ancient grief ’, namely the fate suffered by the Titans after their defeat, convincing. Then, he needs to argue that somehow men are Titans.

Seaford does not give any evidence for this hypothesis. 56 According to Betegh ( 2004 , pp. 88–89), there are two possibilities for the ritual con-text of the text. ‘One is that the author is speaking about rites that should secure the safe passage of the soul of the dead to the underworld, and to the most blissful part of it... The other possibility is that the author is speaking about the initi-ation... But, of course, these two ritual contexts, initiation and funerary ritual, are closely connected. The initiation prepares the blissful post mortem existence of the soul, whereas at death the individual so to speak cashes in the advantages gained by initiation, and the funerary rite is supposed to guarantee this privileged status by reminding the powers of the underworld that the person is an initiate’. According to the early Christian apologist Arnobius ( Adv. gentes 2.13) in vain does the initiate place his hope of ‘salvation’ in the ‘mystic rites in which you beseech some powers to be favorable to you, and not put any hindrance in your way to impede you when returning to your native seats [i.e., heavens]’. The conception of the ‘mystic rite’ here is remarkably similar to the Derveni author’s portrayal of the magi’s rite. 57 Compare Parker 1983 , pp. 299–301. 58 Compare Burkert 2007 , p. 110: ‘Three general statements may safely be made. (1) The idea of going to heaven after death does not belong to the world picture that is common in Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine, and Greece in, say, the begin-ning of the fi rst millennium. Instead, the opposite idea usually prevails, that of a “land of no return” or a “house of Hades”, which is a dreadful subterranean abode, a place of swamps and clay, without light, far away from the gods. “Let us sit down to weep” is the fi nal message of the Gilgamesh epic; the quest for immor-tality has failed. No hope is left. (2) The idea that the pious will ascend to god and rest with him forever is basic to the religion of Zarathustra since the earliest docu-ments, the Gathas . (3) The idea of psyche or pneuma rising to heaven after death is found in Greece in scattered references beginning about the middle of the fi fth century B.C., together with concepts of “spirit”, pneuma ’. 59 See Burkert 1987 passim . 60 See Kellens 2011 , pp. 76–79.

"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":" 11 The divine man, the go ē s and the magician Heraclitus’ invective (DK 14) against the ‘wanderers of the night’ aims at a type, which signifi cantly includes the magi, along with the initiates or initiators of the mysteries. The inclusion of the magoi is not only based on their performing their rite at night, but also, as the Derveni papyrus shows, because the rite is dedicated to ends that are perceived to be similar to those of the mysteries. Heraclitus complains that these myst ē ria that are practised among men are unholy ( anier ō sti ). The mysteries are not able to deliver what they promise because, despite their claim, they cannot purify the soul and make it equal to its divine nature. It is this thought that seems to be expressed in the famous fragment (DK 15) on the identity of Hades and Dionysus, which ends with: ‘Hades and Dionysus are the same, no matter how much they go mad and rave celebrating bacchic rites in honour of the latter’ (Marcovich 1967 , p. 252). Zuntz ( 1971 , pp. 310–12) maintains that it is naive to take the identifi cation of Hades and Dionysus at face value. According to him, the idea of chthonic Dionysus is untenable (Zuntz 1971 , pp. 407ff.), since the god of the vine can only be the god of life. I have already argued against this line of reasoning. The cultic reality of chthonic Dionysus in the mysteries is beyond doubt. 1 In any case, the point made in the fragment does not seem to be a general thesis regarding the unity of life and death. The fi rst part of the fragment shows that at issue are the expectations placed on the Bacchic rite: ‘if they [i.e. the many] omitted (failed) to make the procession to Dionysus and to sing the hymn to the shameful parts, they would be proceeding most irreverently (impiously); but Hades and Dionysus are the same, etc.’ (Marcovich 1967 , p. 252). 2 Heraclitus says that the hopes of the bacchantes are misplaced. This interpretation goes well with his condemnation of the mysteries and ‘mantic’ knowledge in general. Heraclitus’ identifi cation of Hades and Dionysus has, among other things, an eschatological message. In another fragment (DK 129) Heraclitus calls Pythagoras a charlatan. 3 ‘Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchus, practiced scientifi c inquiry beyond all other men, and having made a selection of these (or such) writings, contrived a wisdom of his own, which was but erudition and deceitful craft’ (Marcovich 1967 , p. 68, translation slightly modifi ed). The fi nal word kakotechnia means something like ‘spurious craft’. Burkert points out that it is a ‘technical term"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"262 The divine man, the goēs and the magicianfor the subornation of perjury, and in general designates disingenuous ruses by which anyone attains an end’ (Burkert 1972 , p. 161). Pythagoras is the ‘chief of charlatans’, according to another fragment (DK 81). Heraclitus does not question Pythagoras’ ‘learning’. He is a charlatan because his craft or practice for which he has become famous is deceitful, unable to deliver the demonic soul. 4 Sophocles ( Electra 59ff.) refers to this ‘deceitful craft’ and probably to Pythagoras, or in any case to his type, 5 where he has Orestes cyn-ically say: ‘How does it hurt me, when by feigned death I fi nd true life and win renown? No word is ill-omened, I trust, if it yields gain. For often before now I have seen clever men die in false report; then, when they return home, they are held in greater honor’. It is likely that Heraclitus’ charge of kakotechnia was particularly aimed at Pythagoras’ ritual katabasis . But the scope of his criticism of Pythagoras is much wider. One must also keep in mind, when interpreting Heraclitus’ attack on the mysteries, Plato’s account of the position of philosophy vis- à -vis the mys-tic doctrine. 6 The essence of his view is expressed in Plato, Phaedo 66d–70d, which is nothing less than the programme of philosophy: the separation (‘purifi cation’) of the soul from the body is the necessary condition of wis-dom. As Detienne ( 1963 , p. 70ff.) argues, this conception is in line with the Pythagorean doctrine of the reciprocal relation between purifi cation of the soul and attainment of true knowledge. 7 The fundamental affi nity of philoso-phy, the ‘practice of dying’ (Plato, Phaedo 67e), as the true form of purifi cation with the mysteries is clearly expressed: the few (true) initiates ‘are those who have been true philosophers’ (Plato, Phaedo 69d). 8 Philosophy (cultivation of virtues) and initiation to the mysteries make the same claim. The difference in method therefore has to be set out all the more sharply. In the same text (Plato, Phaedo 70a–d), Plato also points out the basis of both philosophy and the mystic ideology: the immortality of the soul and its desire to return to its divine nature. For this, he recommends separation of the soul from the body through Pythagorean ask ē sis , which he interprets as the practice of dying ( Phaedo 81b–c, 83a). Death is the paradigm, as it were. Was initiation to the mysteries (i.e. mystic purifi cation), too, understood as the ‘release’ of the soul from the body? As we will see, the initiatory scenario probably enacted the passage of the soul to the beyond. Plato’s text also points in the same direc-tion. Finally, Heraclitus’ attack on the mysteries (Dionysus is Hades) and on Pythagoras all but confi rms our surmise. 9 The nexus between the mysteries and philosophy clearly set out in Plato shows the centrality of eschatology in the mystic ideology. Now if we go back to the magi’s rite, we may reasonably assert that the comparison with the mysteries indicates the eschatological sig-nifi cance of the magi’s rite. That it was performed at night connects it with the da ē va cult. Voluntary separation from the body is the hallmark of the ‘divine man’. He releases his soul at will so that it can acquire ‘true’ knowledge, some-thing that happens involuntarily in sleep and catalepsy. 10 Abaris, Epimenides, Pythagoras and Empedocles have the prophetic power, the ‘second sight’,"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"The divine man, the goēs and the magician 263to ‘see’ the invisible. 11 The ability to separate the soul from the body indi-cates a ‘shamanistic’ background or at least an ideological horizon commen-surate with ecstatic practices. 12 To the Greeks, Zalmoxis was an imitator of Pythagoras, but for the Getae, the fi gure was apparently a daim ō n . The Getae, writes Herodotus ( Histories 4.94–95), ‘believe that they do not die, but that when someone succumbs he goes to the daim ō n Zalmoxis. Once every fi ve years they choose one of their people by lot and send him as a messenger to Zalmoxis [i.e. sacrifi ce him]... But as I learn from the Greeks who live on the Hellespont and the Black Sea, this Zalmoxis was a human being, a slave, in Samos, of Pythagoras the son of Mnesarchus’. The Getaean Zalmoxis was a god who received the soul of the dead. According to the historian, the Greeks thought that Zalmoxis learned from Pythagoras the ‘craft’ of disappearing and descending to Hades, which in fact was only an ‘underground chamber’, and reappearing after four years, thus becoming famed for returning from the realm of the dead. 13 Hermippus (Diogenes Laertius, Lives 8.41) relates a very similar story about the master, Pythagoras, who had ‘his mother’ keep him informed about the events while disappeared in the subterranean chamber. On his return from Hades, people ‘were sure that he was some kind of divinity’. Burkert rightly maintains that it ‘is highly unlikely that Pythagoras brought his mother with him to Croton, and such an idea is never mentioned in the tradition. What we have, then, is a rationalizing version of something quite different. Pythagoras brings with him from Hades tes m ē tr ò s paragg é lmata (commands of “the mother”), a message from the divine m ē t ē r – Demeter. Thus the “little dwelling” becomes a sanctuary of Demeter, as Timaeus says Pythagoras’ house was... Hermippus’ report has independent value as evi-dence alongside that of Herodotus. It shows Pythagoras in the role of a hiero-phant in the cult of Demeter’ (Burkert 1972 , p. 159). The fi gure of Pythagoras thus connects the mysteries to ecstatic practices, and in particular to the katabasis and the quest for ‘godlike’ afterlife. The sig-nifi cance of the story is more or less clear: what he must have claimed to be able to achieve for others was that of enabling them to take control of their destiny after death, for which the episode had to serve as proof. The claim had to be grounded in experience, in a publicly known event. Whatever the differ-ences between various eschatological views (e.g. involving metempsychosis or not), the essential thing was the transmission of the knowledge of what awaits one after death and the certainty with regard to one’s position in achieving the best outcome. One will recall the topographic instructions that the gold leaves give their bearers so that they can avoid the pitfalls of the underworld. Familiarity with the geography of Hades was obviously vital. Pythagoras’ katabasis stood as the guarantee of his extraordinary knowledge. One can perhaps decode the double personality, divine and human, of Zalmoxis in reference to the theme of immortality: the original myth was probably related to an initiation rite that ensured, among other things, a blessed afterlife. 14 As we will see, Yama, too, has this double personality. Herodotus’ refusal in Histories 4.96 to pronounce on the veracity of the story of Zalmoxis and"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"264 The divine man, the goēs and the magicianhis underground chamber is, as Eliade ( 1970 , p. 34) writes, characteristic of him in matters related to the mysteries. 15 In Plato, Charmides 156d–157b, Zalmoxis is a Thracian king, ‘who is also a god’ and the teacher of a practice that remedies bodily ills through working on the soul by means of ‘charms’. The physicians of his court, presumably having learned it from him, know how to make one immortal. Herodotus related Pythagoras to Egypt, signifi cantly, as the provenance of Orphic and Bacchic mysteries. Isocrates ( Busiris 28), too, claimed that Pythagoras brought philosophy to Greece from Egypt. But there was also a Greek tradition that introduced Pythagoras as a disciple of Zoroaster. The Christian polemicist Hippolytus ( Refutation 1.2.12) apparently knew two accounts that contained the story of a meeting between Pythagoras and ‘Zaratas the Chaldaean’: one by Aristoxenus, a Pythagorean and pupil of Aristotle, and one by an otherwise unknown Diodorus of Eretria. Gnoli believes that Aristoxenus’ ‘testimony’ proves that Zoroaster was a contem-porary of Pythagoras. 16 ‘The only thing we can be sure of is that Aristoxenus thought it natural that Pythagoras should have learnt from Zoroaster because evidently, in talking about their meeting, he was not aware of any chrono-logical obstacle to it’ (Gnoli 2000 , p. 108). The historian refers to an article by Kingsley ( 1990 ), which argues that the ‘traditional’ sixth-century dating of Zoroaster has a Greek origin in Aristoxenus. Following Gershevitch ( 1995 , pp. 14–15), Gnoli ( 2000 , p. 106, p. 108) maintains that Kingsley’s point is dependent on (his being misled by) Boyce’s view that Zoroaster lived ‘a great deal earlier than the sixth century B.C. – probably some time in the second millennium’ (Kingsley 1990 , p. 245). I do not want to enter the debate over the dating of Zoroaster in any detail. 17 Whether or not Zoroaster lived in the sixth century BC , the Greek ‘evidence’ that Gnoli ( 2000 ) musters to prove it is illusory. He asserts that ‘various Greek traditions’ about Zoroaster ‘assume that a sixth-century dating for Zoroaster was current amongst the Magi or the Persians of the Achaemenian period, and we have no reason to believe that it was not of Iranian origin’ (Gnoli 2000 , p. 108). The assertion that there are ‘various Greek traditions’ that ‘assume the sixth-century dating’ depends on a tendentious interpretation of the tradition, due to Xanthus, that placed Zoroaster 6,000 years before Xerxes’ crossing of the Hellespont. 18 Gnoli’s ‘various Greek traditions’ do not exist. The sheer scantiness of classical Greek accounts of Zoroaster – supposedly a ‘prophet’ whose religion conquered the whole of the Persian Empire and a contemporary of the Empire’s founder 19 – and the way, in each case, the Iranian sophos perfectly fi ts the Greek context incline one to suspect that they are indeed Greek in origin. 20 The company that Zoroaster keeps in these accounts tells us about what the Greeks thought of him as a magos and nothing about his date. The Zoroaster of the scholi-ast of the First Alcibiades is thoroughly Pythagorean, not just in matters of knowledge and existence, but also insofar as he is said to be either a Greek or a descendent of men who are from the lands beyond the ‘great sea’. 21 Colotes, an Epicurean philosopher of the mid third century BC , thought that Plato’s"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"The divine man, the goēs and the magician 265myth of Er is based on Zoroaster’s katabasis . Beck ( 1991 , p. 529) points out that Colotes must have known an account of Zoroaster’s descent to and return from the underworld, and ‘mistook the derivative (“Zoroaster’s”) for the ori-ginal (Plato’s) – willfully perhaps in sectarian zeal’. The Zoroaster story is almost a replicate of Hermippus’ account of Pythagoras’ katabasis . Colotes’ ‘mistake’ is no mistake at all. Sectarian motivation may well be a factor, but the attribution itself had to be ideologically sound. In Colotes’ mind, Zoroaster must have done what was also related of Pythagoras, which meant that he had to be Plato’s model. Plato’s associates made the step an easy one in any case. 22 This is the Zoroaster that the Hellenistic age inherited from classical Greece. The possibly Hellenistic stories that Pliny ( Natural History 30.3–11) 23 knew about Zoroaster included accounts (30.9–11) of Greek ‘philosophers’ (Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus) travelling east to learn from the ori-ginal teacher of ‘magic’. Orpheus, Empedocles and Pythagoras are called the ‘magi’ in Apuleius’ Apology (in Graf 2002 , p. 94). The second-century author of Stromata , Clement of Alexandria, gives a list of pagan fi gures and events which are, according to him, contemporary with various Biblical characters from Moses onwards (Clement, Stromata 1.21). ‘Zoroaster the Mede’ is mentioned in a group that comprises fi gures such as Abaris, Epimenides, Empedocles and Pythagoras. These names belong to the type of ‘divine man’. 24 Clement also adds the name of Socrates. This may seem odd but the statement that he reports from Socrates makes clear the Socrates he has in mind. It also demonstrates what for him characterizes the group: ‘I am attended by a supernatural intimation’, Socrates says. Contact with the supernatural world was the privilege that singled out these fi gures. Socrates ‘said that “something divine”, daimonion , had happened to him; it was probably too mysterious even for himself for him to be able to call it divine’ (Burkert 1985 , p. 317). The traditions concerning Greek charismatics not only intimately connect them with shamanistic experiences but also point to the ideological basis of their mantic and therapeutic claims: the doctrine of the divinity of the soul. 25 And this basis, as a number of Hellenists have argued, draws them into the sphere of Iranian religious thought. 26 Kingsley ( 1995a , pp. 88–132) has shown the Orphic background of the Phaedo myth of the underworld. In particular, the doctrine underlies the Orphic-type claims that bear on the afterlife. The soul can attain its divine nature in the afterlife if purifi ed in this life (Plato, Phaedo 69c–d). For this a special knowledge is needful, available through men who have access to the invisible source of the world. 27 Zoroaster is such a man, a sophos , in the classical Greek eyes. This is what determines his place and character in Greek traditions about him. 28 If he is placed in the company of men like Pythagoras, it is because the Greeks intimately connected the magi with Orphic-type views and activities. It is this perception that has a historical reality and not ‘Zaratas the Chaldean’, the teacher of Pythagoras. 29 Plato lists in Symposium 202e–203a (see above) the functions of the ‘purifi er’ that claims knowledge of the beyond. These defi ne a particular semantic fi eld where mageia too belongs."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"266 The divine man, the goēs and the magician In Oedipus Tyrannus (387ff.) Oedipus accuses Creon of enlisting the services of Teiresias for his plot against the king, calling the seer a magos and agyrt ē s . The latter term refers to the mendicant purifi er, 30 and magos apparently has a negative connotation, a mantic ‘who has sight only when it comes to profi t’. For Sophocles, the word magos is clearly related with the ‘seer’, and more spe-cifi cally with the ‘second sight’, however grudgingly conceded. It seems that agyrt ē s is foremost a socio-economic designation. One of the groups that the Spartan lawgiver Lycurgus bars from entering the city is the mantis agyrtikos ‘mendicant seer’, according to Plutarch (Plutarch, Lycurgus 9.5), a category probably refl ecting the classical or Hellenistic society. 31 It is impossible to say whether the practice by the agyrt ē s of katharmoi ‘ritual purifi cation’ was sim-ply rooted in opportunism or had some original religious ground. Plato also uses another term to describe the ritual purifi er, go ē s , which evi-dently belongs to the same semantic fi eld. In the Symposium 202e–203a he says that the race of daimones is the intermediary between men and the gods, this is why the sacred craft concerning, among others, ‘ go ē teia ’ belongs to it. In a fragment (DK 82) from Gorgias’ Apology for Helen , we fi nd an explicit combination of the mageia and the go ē teia . 32 ‘For the ecstatic enchantments by words bring joy, chase away sadness; for, when the power of the enchant-ment unites with our soul by means of belief, it charms and persuades and transforms by the art of the wizard ( go ē s ). Wizardry and magic are two tech-niques that both are the error of the soul and the illusion of opinion’. The ‘error of the soul’ probably has the same signifi cance as Heraclitus’ charge of deception against the mysteries. The Greeks noted the ritual incantation of the magos . The association with the go ē teia indicates its power in connec-tion with the realm of the dead. Burkert ( 1972 , p. 164) suspects shamanistic origins for the go ē s , ‘a word that combines the magic of self-transformation with the mourning of the dead’, and even wonders whether it did not ‘origin-ally mean something like “shaman”’. Graf gives a similar picture of the go ē s : it ‘derives from goos , the ritual lament; the go ē s is connected with funerary rites, ecstasy, divination, and healing; if the go ē s bears traces of shamanism, this belongs at best to prehistory’ (Graf 1997 , p. 28). Herodotus’ remarks about the Neuroi in the Histories 4.105 seem to connect the go ē teia with a shamanic culture in Scythia. ‘It may be that they are wizards ( go ē tes ). For ( gar ) the Scythians, and the Greeks settled in Scythia, say that once a year every one of the Neuri is turned into a wolf, and after remaining so for a few days returns again to his former shape. For my part ( eme men nun ), I do not believe this tale; but all the same they tell it, and even swear to its truth’. That the Neuroi are said to turn themselves into wolves explains why one might call them go ē tes . The sense of go ē tes is elucidated by the allegation of shamanic werewolfi sm made on behalf of the Neuroi . 33 The role of the go ē s in funerary rites was probably shamanistic, or something similar, 34 since in Aeschylus’ Persae (performed in 472 BC ) the go ē s is ‘the specialist who brings back the dead from their graves’. 35 Necromancy is performed through incan-tation and chthonic libations. There is ‘in the speech with which the ghost"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"The divine man, the goēs and the magician 267of Darius addresses the Council of Elders when he fi rst rises up above his tomb something that suggests goeteia has been performed: Darius speaks of the Elders standing near his tomb uttering a lament ( threnein ) and calling to him in piteous fashion, raising their voice in spirit-drawing cries of woe ( psychagogoi gooi )’. 36 Whatever the veracity of ascribing necromancy to the Persians, one must admit that in the tragedy the go ē teia is used to refer to the practice, which is in the Greek mind associated with the Persians. Thus the coupling in Gorgias’ text of the magos and go ē s cannot be unmotivated. 37 For the sophist, the mageia and go ē teia obviously belonged to the same set of practices. The bond is more signifi cant than just the indication of a cultural horizon, since the go ē s had a special affi nity with the realm of the dead. For the mysteries like those of Dionysus, which had a special interest in the after-life, being in contact with the realm of the dead had a particular importance: the go ē s ‘was primarily concerned with the passage between the two worlds’ (Graf and Johnston 2007 , p. 170). The go ē teia , appearing in the Symposium 202e–203a among the functions or rites that make contact with the invisible world possible (‘the science of divination’), must have had to do specifi cally with facilitating the passage of the soul to the beyond. Perhaps in ancient times ritual lament in funeral ceremonies was associated with the passage. In short, the go ē s made the passage over the threshold of death possible – both ways. This seems to have been his ‘wizardry’. In Euripides, Bacchae 230ff., Pentheus calls the disguised Dionysus, the god who releases, a go ē s and an ep ō dos ‘enchanter’. The intended abuse betrays an archaic signifi cation, which is in keeping both with the contradictory personality of the god (expressed in the play by the opposition theos vs. daim ō n ) and, more specifi cally, with the ‘tragic paradox’ of the play. 38 The irony expressed in the word go ē s depends on its double meaning. The ultimate go ē s who ‘releases’ and makes possible a happy life and afterlife becomes the go ē s who dispatches Pentheus without recourse. The mobile life of the charismatic mantis is a basic dimension of his exist-ence. It expresses something essential in his status, namely that he belong nowhere and everywhere, and is thus able to travel at will across the threshold of death. 39 Empedocles ‘goes among’ men as ‘an immortal god’ (DK 112), 40 which also means to him that he is not at home among mortals (DK 113 and 114). Ubiquity also characterizes the existence of the mantis in time. This is how Empedocles describes a mantic sophos (apparently Pythagoras) in a frag-ment (DK 129): ‘And there was among them a man of rare knowledge, most skilled in all manner of wise works, a man who had won the utmost wealth of thoughts ( prapides ); for whenever he tensed all his prapides , he contemplated everything comprised in ten, yea, and twenty lifetimes of men’. Detienne ( 1963 , pp. 79–83) has shown the connection of prapides with the ecstatic tech-nique of ‘concentrating’ the soul in order to separate it from the body and thereby gain access to the invisible source of existence, to truth (cf. Plato, Republic 571d–e).

Pausanias will be able to descend into Hades and fetch the dead man’s soul back to the world of the living. ‘The idea of trying to bring someone back from the dead was, in the framework of normal Greek moral-ity, almost unthinkable... in terms of not only formal and structural analo-gies but also of historical contacts, there can be no separating the Thracian Orpheus from central-Asiatic shamanic tradition’ (Kingsley 1995a , p. 226). 41 In Lucian, Menippus 6 (the second century AD ), Menippus, tongue-in-cheek, reports meeting a Mithrobarazanes ‘one of the magi, disciples and succes-sors of Zoroaster, who I heard are able – through certain spells and rites – to open gates of Hades and take down safely whomever they want and then bring him up again’. The ritual descent begins at night; at dawn they ride a boat along the Euphrates to the marshes where the magus sacrifi ces a sheep and addresses the underworld gods, including the Erinyes and Persephone. Necromancy belongs to the sphere of activities of the magos in Hellenistic literature. 42 But a more potent ‘magic’ is alleged here of the magus than just conjuring the dead. Just like Odysseus in the Homeric nekyia and Orpheus, he is able to go to the realm of the dead and return to life. Mithrobarazanes bids Menippus to adopt their name, or that of Heracles, while in the under-world. 43 The go ē tic characteristics and abilities of the type to which the magos belongs, whatever their historical origins, are undeniable. 44 Magic is derived from the name of the Persian priest, the magus. The word magos had from the earliest attestations two uses in Greek: either a Persian priest or a ‘magician’. How to account for the derived sense? Why did the magician call himself by that name? In his study of Zoroastrian pseudepig-rapha of the Hellenistic period, Beck ( 1991 , p. 520) writes: ‘Generally, the Greek image of the magi, when not distorted by the equation of magus and magician... is a favourable one’. If so, it becomes even more of an enigma how the magus ended up giving the magician his contemptible professional name, for the magician always had, under whatever name, a despised status, whether thought to be a dangerous conjurer or merely a charlatan, e.g. in Sophocles, Oedipus Tyrannus 385ff. Nock believes that the derived meaning developed from ‘the impression made on unfriendly Ionian spectators by Persian priests, with their queer garments and tiaras and mouth masks – as we see them on the relief from Dascylium – performing uncomprehended rites, uttering unintelligible prayers, and indispensable at sacrifi ce’ (Nock 1972 , p. 318). But how does incomprehension of a sacrifi cial rite lead to imputation of ‘magic’ where, in fact, as we know from Herodotus, Histories 1.131–32 for instance, the Greeks knew that the magi’s sacrifi cial rites were precisely sacrifi ces? In Herodotus, the magos is a diviner (dream-interpreter) and a professional of sacrifi ce. It has been supposed that the magi’s sacrifi ce and casting of ‘spells’ ( go ē si ) in the Histories 7.191 had the value of magic. But even here, the magi are described as making a sacrifi ce, and if the ‘spells’ they cast are supposed (by them) to possess effi cacy, the connection of magic with Persian sacrifi ce would have been in the Greek mind neither necessary"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"The divine man, the goēs and the magician 269nor exclusive. Although Zeus releases ( lyseien ) from many fetters, says Apollo of his father in Aeschylus, Eumenides 644ff., he has made ( epoi ē sen ) no magic spells ( ep ō das ) for resurrecting the dead. Incantation with a ‘magical’ value could apparently stand on its own, here and also in Herodotus’ text; and if it has for the Greeks an elective affi nity with the magi’s rite, it is in an eschatological key, as is apparent, for example, in the Eumenides passage and the Derveni papyrus. Bremmer ( 2008 ) follows Nock, his initial statement notwithstanding (Bremmer 2008 , p. 235). He believes that the ‘two reasons’ why sorcery was suspected in the magi’s ‘activity’ by the Greeks were the ‘incomprehensibility’ of their incantation and the ‘whisper-ing’ voice with which they delivered it (Bremmer 2008 , p. 244). Did the Greeks expect to be able to understand, e.g. Old Persian? The ‘incomprehensibility’ of the magi’s ritual incantation as the basis for seeing sorcery in their rite is a completely artifi cial explanation. 45 The confusion is not in the mind of the Greek observer. Surprisingly, Beck, too, uses the same specious argument. ‘Why’, Beck ( 1991 , p. 513) asks, ‘were the magi chosen by the Greeks for this role as the standard-bearers of magic? Undoubtedly, at the origin was a misunderstanding – perhaps a willful misunderstanding – of the function of actual magi in religious ritual as the Ionian Greeks fi rst observed it in their early contacts with the Persians’. Nothing shows the nullity of this argument better than the fact that, only a page later, Beck feels he has to produce a com-pletely different argument. For the Greeks, the magi represented an ‘alien’ and ‘dangerous’ cult which was ‘inimical’ and ‘inferior’ to their own; and so was also ‘the other system located on the margins of established religion – magic’. By calling this system ‘magic’ the ‘Greeks at a stroke marginalized and delegitimized it. Magic becomes by defi nition irredeemably foreign’. ‘Its power, too, is precisely fi xed: sinister and menacing, like the art of the actual magi, yet subordinate to the religion of the traditional cults, just as the cult and gods of the magi lost to the cults and gods of Greece’ (Beck 1991 , p. 514). The compulsion that the suggested four similarities (alien, dangerous, inimi-cal and inferior) between the magi’s lore and ‘sorcery’ (the two ‘systems’ 46 ) are supposed to have exercised on the ‘Greeks’ to assimilate the two is plausible neither as a general proposition nor with regard to the particular instance it seeks to pretention explain. The pretension to manipulate physical phenom-ena by ritual means was no less native in Greece than elsewhere. 47 Are we to suppose that the ‘Greeks’ suddenly decided to stigmatize a number of trad-itional religious activities by putting a threatening alien name on them? More generally, one just cannot see how the two ‘systems’ are so amalgamated that the practitioner of one gives its name to that of the other simply because the two systems are perceived as ‘alien’, etc. And who were the ‘Greeks’? The same ‘reasonably well informed Greeks’ (Beck 1991 , p. 520) who produced the favourable ‘group portrait’ refl ected in Diogenes Laertius, Lives 1.6–9? Then one would have to think that the ‘Greeks’ who ‘generally’ had a ‘favor-able image’ of the magi deliberately ‘distorted’ their own view by equating the magus with the sorcerer."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"270 The divine man, the goēs and the magician In fact, working from the same suppositions, Gordon ( 1987 , p. 78) wonders about this quandary. ‘But how did this theory of Persian origin arise in the fi rst place? Since it is wholly fanciful, how could the Greeks persuade themselves of its truth?’ Like Beck and Nock, Gordon believes that the construction of the hateful image of the Persian priests was motivated by political hostility making use of the strangeness of the magi’s lore. The Greek victory in beat-ing off Xerxes’ invasion not only proved the political and military supremacy of the Greeks but also demonstrated their religious superiority: ‘the elaborate rituals of the magi were mere form, with no ability to produce effects claimed’ (Gordon 1987 , p. 79). Thus, through a ‘process of catachresis’ the name of the representative of a hated and ‘failed religion’ becomes the basis of a pseudo-historical account of the origins of ‘magic’, equally despised and viewed as fraudulent. The Greeks did not really ‘persuade’ themselves of the Persian origin of magic; they fabricated it – but why? Gordon’s two-tiered reply to this question is not convincing: it is contradictory at one level and amounts to a petitio principii at another. The Greek political and cultural elite constructs the Persian lineage of ‘magic’ in order to draw fi rm boundaries between the civic religion of the polis and the practices of marginal magico-religious craftsmen, thereby consolidating the former. ‘The otherness of the religion of the Greeks’ arch-enemy’ was thus a ‘suitable metaphor’ in this enterprise. But then how to draw the boundaries between the ‘most widespread forms of popular religion’ and the religion of the polis ? Does the former comprise only ‘magico-medical healing, charms and amulets against illness, informal kinds of divination’, etc., or does it also include public festivals and ceremonies and ‘a vague assortment of poetic representations in Homer and Hesiod’? One can see that the distinction is artifi cial. The ‘popular forms of religion’, which, according to Gordon, the elite wanted to undermine with their ‘suit-able metaphor’, had to include Homeric and Hesiodic myths and public fes-tivals such as the city and country Dionysia, etc., all the manifestations of the ‘civic religion’. Gordon himself admits as much: the ‘redefi nition of true religion – moralized gods and scepticism towards traditional representations of divinity – could be legitimated by redefi ning impiety to include the bulk of popular religion’ (Gordon 1987 , p. 79). What do ‘traditional representa-tions of divinity’ refer to in classical Greece if not the gods of Homer and Hesiod? In effect, then, the ‘Greek elite’ sought to consolidate the ‘civic reli-gion’ against the despised ‘marginal’ magico-religious forms, but, not know-ing where to draw the boundaries, ended up destroying the whole edifi ce as mere ‘superstition’. Is this ‘the value to the emergent intellectual class, and so to the elite as a whole, of “Persian” magic’ (Gordon 1987 , p. 79)? On a more basic level, the ‘Persian history of magic’ merely continues and ‘simplifi es’ the native ‘theme of the outsider magician’, exemplifi ed in the fi gure of Medea (Gordon 1987 , p. 80). Thus the magos dislodges Medea as the polit-ical-religious hostility against the ‘enemy of the state’ replaces the traditional suspicion and animosity of men toward women (Gordon 1987 , pp. 83–84). 48 But as Gordon ( 1987 , pp. 64–65) acknowledges, a clear distinction was made"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"The divine man, the goēs and the magician 271between male and female traditions of magic. What is the basis of the com-parison of the Persian magos and Medea, aside from the vague assertion that the two are the most important ‘outsider magicians in Graeco-Roman litera-ture’? 49 ‘Prior to the elaboration of the image of the Persian magos therefore, and parallel to it (especially in the form of the Thessalian women), the fi gure of Medea served to represent the simultaneously alien and domestic quality of magical activity’ (Gordon 1987 , p. 83). The ‘dangerous’ quality that the elite perceived in magic, e.g. that it was ‘simultaneously alien and domestic’, can hardly be an adequate basis for the historical connection it is expected support. Nor is Medea merely a negative, foreign fi gure: she is both alien and domestic, both salutary and sinister. One can see that, if Medea was in fact cast as the tutelary fi gure of the sorceress, myth had already prepared her for the role. But, according to the premises of Gordon’s story, the Persian magus could not be an ambiguous fi gure in the relevant sense: he was only alien, only sinister. Dickie ( 2001 ) follows Graf ’s conception that ‘magic’ is not a universal reli-gious phenomenon but a particular ‘category of thought’ that has a specifi c birthplace, namely classical Greece. According to Graf ( 1996 , pp. 31ff.), the set to which the word ‘magic’ refers was formed through a process of exclusion and stigmatization of a number of traditional religious activities. Philosophy undertook a moral purifi cation of the idea of divinity and, as a result, certain ways of relating to the gods became reprehensible. At the same time, medicine ruled out ritual manipulation as an appropriate and effective form of inter-vention in natural processes. Thus the philosophers and doctors condemned a whole range of activities as inimical to ‘religion’ and ‘natural science’, which were then baptized as ‘magic’. This picture, although formally elegant, is implausibly intellectualist, as Dickie ( 2001 , p. 21) points out. Nonetheless, Dickie ( 2001 , 27–46) preserves Graf ’s thesis concerning the basis of the for-mation of the concept of ‘magic’, merely getting rid of the operators of the process: the concept is a ‘product of a special set of circumstances’ (Dickie 2001 , p. 20). The marginalized activities were ‘akin to conventional forms of religious behaviour’ but in their ‘impiety’, ‘immorality’ and ‘secrecy’ were ‘at odds with it’; and their claim to upsetting ‘the course of nature’ was either fraudulent or dangerous (Dickie 2001 , p. 46). The reason ‘the disparate prac-tices, lacking any common thread to tie them together, that were later held to constitute magic’, were jumbled together was that all of them were ‘exposed to the same moral condemnation’ and ‘were already viewed as being at odds with accepted religious practice and were already thought to be able to upset the normal course of nature’ (Dickie 2001 , p. 27). ‘Moral condemnation’ is the basis of the formation of the concept of magic, which is already discern-ible in tragedy and comedy, i.e. before the Hippocratic On the Sacred Disease and Plato. Whatever the merits of this thesis regarding the formation of a ‘category of thought’, the question remains why it was called after the Persian priest. The connection is fortuitous, according to Dickie ( 2001 , p. 41), since the magoi who gave their professional name to ‘magic’ had ‘no trace left of"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"272 The divine man, the goēs and the magicianZoroastrianism’ or even ‘anything Persian’. ‘What we fi nd instead are men who offer initiation into the quite unPersian institution of the mystery-cult’ (Dickie 2001 , p. 41). Dickie recognizes the intimate relation of ‘magic’ with the mysteries, but the way he conceives of this relation poses more problems than it solves: ‘magic, because of its early associations with mystery-cult, took on some of the colouring of the mysteries’ and ‘some of its ceremonial became inextricably confused with mystery-rites... It is still a puzzle... how the purveyors of initiation into the mysteries came to double as magicians’ (Dickie 2001 , p. 43). This ‘puzzle’ must be added to another, namely ‘how it came about that persons calling themselves magoi presented themselves as experts in magic and at the same time offered initiations into the mysteries’ (Dickie 2001 , p. 43). It is not clear why Dickie thinks that a nocturnal sacri-fi ce with an eschatological intent, if this is a fair description of the rite of the magoi , which may be assumed in Heraclitus, is ‘unPersian’. As I have already mentioned, the idea that in two or three decades the Persian magoi completely metamorphosed or that a group of agyrtai using their professional name completely overwhelmed them is historically quite implausible. In Dickie’s account, the Persian magoi simply vanished in the last quarter of the sixth century BC . In the Hippocratic treatise On the Sacred Disease 2 from the late fi fth cen-tury BC, the magoi are charlatans, for they claim catalepsy to be a divine con-dition. They claim ‘great piety and superior knowledge’. ‘Those who fi rst attributed a sacred character to this malady were like magicians, purifi ers, begging holy men and charlatans of our own day, men who claim great piety and superior knowledge. Being at a loss and having no treatment that would help, they sheltered themselves behind the divine and called this illness sacred, in order to conceal their utter ignorance’. Catalepsy is akin to death and sleep, in that the soul can gain access to the invisible (cf. Xenophon, Cyropaedia 8.7.21). Induced cataleptic condition convinced Aristotle, according to his pupil Clearchus, ‘that the soul is separable from the body’. 50 The magoi (‘magi-cians’) are in a familiar setting. The disparagement that the magos suffers, becoming a ‘charlatan’, applies to the whole company: Heraclitus’ nuktipoloi . The real question is, as I have argued, why the mageia is associated with the mysteries, which undoubtedly constitute the background of magic. The indi-vidual magic rite was often called myst ē rion or even theoin myst ē rion ; and more often it was simply called telet ē , which in classical Greece was used for any rite, including that of initiation to the mysteries. 51 A Greek Magical Papyrus has preserved fragments of a katabasis ritual where the interlocutor is taught spells and formulas for protecting himself once in the underworld (or underground chamber) against the punitive daimones . Just as in Lucian’s satirical portrayal, the candidate is told to introduce himself as Hekate (or the Babylonian Ereshkigal), etc. Then, the famous ‘Orphic formula’ is given: ‘I have been initiated, and I descended into the (underground) chamber of the Dactyls, and I saw the other things down below, virgin, bitch, and all the rest’. 52 Clement calls it a synth ē ma ‘password’. Betz ( 1980 , p. 293) points"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"The divine man, the goēs and the magician 273out that such combinations of mystery initiation and descent into the under-world are commonplace in the Hellenistic period. The ability to pass to the underworld was a defi ning characteristic in both the magician and the fi gure of the ‘divine man’ (such as Orpheus or Pythagoras) associated with the mys-teries. Simulation of descent into Hades seems to have constituted the mys-tic initiatory scenario. The language of the formula is without a doubt that of the mysteries. The attribution by Clement ( Stromata 1.15) of the ‘Orphic formula’ to the Idaean Daktyloi, as we will see, must itself be a mystery trad-ition. Betz ( 1980 , p. 292) rightly compares the underground chamber of the Daktyloi with the Eleusinian Ploutonion as the ‘entrance to the underworld’. The fact is that the literate magician’s lore is derived from the mysteries. 53 The magician took his professional name from the magos : the cultural and seman-tic links between the two are the mysteries. Notes 1 See Detienne 1979 , p. 90: ‘Dionysos is more complex and polymorphous than any other divinity in the pantheon – by his rare prestige as a magician as much as his affi nity for displaying or manifesting in the beyond . His beyond with respect to the human condition between gods and beasts does not only take the form of the state of cruel bestiality omophagy imposes. For the very same Dionysiac indistinct-ness between men and beasts likewise leads to the disappearance of any distance between men and gods’. Dionysus Zagreus, is, according to a few sources, the son of Persephone and Hades who may well be the alter ego of Zeus katachthonios . See Gantz 1993 , pp. 118–19 for references. See also Graf and Johnston 2007 , p. 123 and Ker é nyi 1976 , pp. 262–90. 2 See his discussion of the various readings of the fragment: Marcovich 1967 , pp. 250–55. The cultural context of Heraclitus’ dictum may be the seemingly widespread belief that the god can bring ruin for the mortals who ‘enjoy’ his epiphany, such as Ariadne, Lycurgus, Pentheus and Icarius. Obviously, the circumstances must be taken into account in determining the signifi cance of the god’s character in this respect. 3 Incidentally, just as in DK 15, Heraclitus fi rst states the common belief then imposes his own contrary view. Here, too, he allows the received opinion of the topic but quickly undermines it as superfi cial, i.e. having an eye only for the appearance of wisdom. See Seaford 1986 , pp. 14–20. His conclusion is: ‘Herakleitos seems to have believed that the mysteries as celebrated provide an inadequate conception of post-mortem experience. The truth about that experience is contained, of course, in his logos , which resembles a mystic doctrine in both form and content, differing from it in respects which we cannot recover’ (Seaford 1986 , p. 20). 4 Compare Seaford 1986 , p. 18: ‘For Herakleitos it seems that post-mortem existence (or persistence?) as a daim ō n requires a fi ery (or daemonic?) soul in life, and this in turn depends on character and behavior: ē thos anthr ō p ō i daim ō n (B 119)’. The sect-arian (and hence political) nature of Pythagoreanism cannot have been unimport-ant in Heraclitus’ judgement. See Redfi eld 1991 , pp. 108–17. 5 See Burkert 1972 , pp. 160–61. 6 I agree with Seaford’s assessment regarding the ideological homogeneity of the vari-ous mysteries: ‘Our knowledge of the mysteries in general reveals broad similarities even between mysteries belonging to different deities’ (Seaford 1986 , p. 12).

Redfi eld draws a sharp distinction between Pythagoras’ and Empedocles’ conceptions of the philosophical life. I think the difference is exaggerated and, generally, Redfi eld overlooks their shared intellectual horizon. See Detienne 1963 , pp. 79–85. Pythagoras is the link between Orphism, and the ideology of the mysteries, and philosophy, more generally. 9 Heraclitus’ method of criticism is to make a received idea yield a meaning opposed to the one traditionally ascribed to it. See Heidegger and Fink 1993 , pp. 49ff. Plato’s attack on the ‘seers and mendicant priests’ in the Republic must be interpreted in the context set out above otherwise it is misunderstood. 10 See Detienne 1963 , pp. 73ff. Compare Aristotle’s fragment 12 A from the early text On Philosophy : ‘Lorsque l’ â me devient elle-m ê me dans le sommeil, alors elle ret-rouve sa nature propre et peut voir l’avenir’ (Detienne 1963 , p. 75). Detienne draws attention to Aristotle’s and others’ view of catalepsy as ‘une v é ritable exp é rience m é taphysique’ (Detienne 1963 , p. 84). It proves, according to Aristotle, the immor-tality of the soul. The separation of the soul from the body is for Aristotle the necessary condition of knowledge, ‘qui est vision d’une psych ē rendue à elle-m ê me’ (Detienne 1963 , p. 84). 11 See Detienne 1963 , pp. 86–87: ‘nous connaissons les affi nit é s d’un É pim é nide de Cr è te avec le type de sage auquel appartiennent Emp é docle et Pythagore.

This last statement points to an intimate connection between the divine man and the ideology of the mysteries. 12 Bremmer ( 1983 , pp. 25–53, esp. pp. 47–48) rejects ‘shamanistic infl uence’ on the legends of Orpheus, Aristeas, Hermotimos, etc. The way he poses the issue is unacceptable to me. In any event, there are undeniable continuities between ecstatic experiences reported for Siberian shamans and the abilities of the Greek legends, however one wishes to refer to these abilities (‘ecstatic’ or ‘shamanistic’). Historical contacts between supposed shamanic cultures of the north and Greece prior to the classical period can strictly be neither proven nor disproven. It is true that ecstasy and the journey of the soul are not limited to the two cultures; and, in any event, the belief among the Greeks related to such abilities may well be older than pos-sible contact during the archaic period. The expression ‘shamanistic’ describes a type (of ability, experience, etc.), not a cultural genealogy. Further, katabasis and necromancy must be added to the list of the abilities shared by the shaman and the Greek ‘divine man’. Compare Ustinova 2002 , p. 287. 13 According to Strabo ( Geography 8.3.5), upon his return to Getae, Zalmoxis impressed the king with his mantic skills and took up residence in a ‘cavernous place’, where the king met and consulted with him. The role of king’s divine coun-cillor later on fell to a Dekaineos, described as go ē s an ē r . 14 Compare Ustinova 2002 , p. 280: ‘The interpretatio Graeca of Thracian ideas on immortality demonstrates that the cult of Zalmoxis involved a belief in the blissful"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"The divine man, the goēs and the magician 275postexistence, and certain initiatory rites: in fact Hellancios calls the rites intro-duces (sic.) by Zalmoxis initiations ( telet ē )’. 15 Eliade 1970 , p. 33: ‘L’important est le fait que les Grecs ont é t é frapp é s par la similarit é entre Pythagore et Zalmoxis.

A travers le rationalisme et l’ é vh é m é risme d’H é rodote, ou de ses informateurs, on devine le caract è re myst é rique du culte’. 16 See Gnoli 2000 , pp. 102–11. 17 Kellens’ rebuttal ( 2001 ) of Gnoli’s reasoning is for the most part valid. 18 See Bidez and Cumont 1973 , vol. 1, pp. 4–23; De Jong 1997 , pp. 317–23; and Kingsley 1995b for an analysis of, e.g. the tradition that placed Zoroaster 6,000 years before Plato. I do not agree with all of Kingsley’s conclusions, espe-cially the ones stated in Kingsley 1995b , pp. 193–94. 19 See Kingsley 1995b , p. 182: ‘the earliest Greek evidence has as a matter of fact always been a major obstacle to accepting that Zoroaster could have lived in the sixth century B.C. Herodotus’s total silence about him is extremely diffi cult to understand or explain on the assumption that he was such a recent, as well as powerful, fi gure’. 20 Vasunia ( 2007 , pp. 245ff., esp. p. 251) argues that Aristoxenus’ associating Pythagoras with Zoroaster had sectarian motivations. The arbitrary nature of Gershevitch’s and Gnoli’s reasoning shows itself when one compares the rela-tion they assume for the Greek observer and his supposed Zoroastrian inform-ers. They are happy to have Aristoxenus ‘gleefully learn from Greeks who had met Zoroastrians in Babylon’ (Gershevitch 1995 , p. 15) that Zoroaster lived in the sixth century. But the Greek writers who placed Zoroaster, e.g. ‘6000 years before Ostanes’, did so because of a ‘misunderstanding’ (Gnoli 2000 , p. 73, p. 78: ‘were involuntarily misled’) about the magi’s doctrine of the frava š\u0004 i , i.e. the ‘pre-existent soul’. Even Xanthus of Lydia (cf. Kingsley 1995b , pp. 176–85) must have ‘mis-understood’ the magi when he was told that Zoroaster’s ‘soul had been created six thousand years ago before his birth’ (Gnoli 2000 , p. 74). From this ‘doctrine’, Xanthus could have at least gathered that Zoroaster lived some time in the sixth century, since, according to the supposed compte-rendu by the magi, his ‘soul’ was created six thousand years before his birth . To have Xanthus ‘mistakenly’ conclude from such a statement that ‘Zoroaster lived six thousand years before the 6 th cen-tury’ is tantamount to having him ‘gleefully’ place Zoroaster’s birth six thousand years before his birth! Gnoli’s reference ( 2000 , pp. 67–75) to the millennial scheme of the Zoroastrians does not help his case, for this scheme precisely has Zoroaster live at the beginning of the last 3,000-year cycle. Compare Kingsley 1995b , p. 191: ‘the dating of Zoroaster to six thousand years before Xerxes’s attempted invasion cannot possibly be reconciled with the dating of Zoroaster in any of the other schemes – where he always occurs towards the end of the world-cycle’. The doc-trine that Aristoxenus ascribes to ‘Zaratas’, as Boyce and Grenet ( 1991 , pp. 368–70) argue, seems thoroughly Pythagorean. 21 See Bidez and Cumont 1973 , vol. 1, pp. 103–106, vol. 2, pp. 23–24. On the dia-logue, see Horky 2009 , p. 70 n. 89. 22 See Vasunia 2007 , pp. 248ff. and Horky 2009 , pp. 74–77, pp. 93–98. ‘[T]he prior-ity that is given to the place of the magoi in Aristotle’s archeology of metaphys-ics (i.e. Metaphysics 1091 b 6–12) suggests that, for Aristotle at least, the magoi played a signifi cant role not only in the development of Ionian wisdom tradi-tions, but also in the establishment of the conceptual apparatus by which the Pythagoreans and, ultimately, Plato would derive their ontological hypotheses’ (Horky 2009 , p. 76)."},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"276 The divine man, the goēs and the magician 23 See Gordon 1987 , pp. 74–75. 24 See Burkert 1972 , pp. 147–92 and Detienne 1999 , pp. 35–67. Momigliano’s char-acterization of the passage from classical to Hellenistic thought is unrealistic: ‘the subordination of Greek thought to Oriental wisdom, that is, the change from the conquest of truth through reason to the acquisition of truth through revelation’ (Momigliano 1975 , p. 147). His image of pre-Hellenistic Greek thought is one-sided, to say the least. 25 See Detienne 1963 , pp. 93ff. 26 See Burkert 2007 , 110; West 1971 , pp. 213–35; Kingsley 1995a , pp. 217–316.

The real question is where can persons with a knowledge of ritual practice of whom a fair number must have been literate have come from... Although destitute and essentially beggars, agyrtai were not necessarily obscure and nameless individ-uals... Philippos the Orpheotelestes, a man who was utterly destitute... told people that those who had been initiated under his supervision became prosperous and happy, once they had died’ (Dickie 2001 , p. 67). 31 See Dickie 2001 , p. 66; Graf 2002 , pp. 100–101. 32 See Graf 1997 , p. 26. For Hesychius the Alexandrian grammarian of the fi fth century, magos is a synonym of go ē s ‘wizard’. Bidez and Cumont ( 1973 , vol. 1, pp. 144–45) observe that the magos had throughout Greco-Roman antiquity the double usage of the Persian priest and the magician, the second becoming more frequent with time. ‘Les plus anciens textes o ù magos apparaisse avec la signifi ca-tion de “sorcier”, “thaumaturge”, “enchanteur”, remontent jusqu’au cinqui è me si è cle avant notre è re, et dans la suite ce mot est fr é quemment employ é comme un synoyme de go ē s ’ (Bidez and Cumont 1973 , vol. 1, pp. 144–45). In Euripides, Orestes 1490ff., mageia is used to describe Helen’s sudden disappearance, which clearly expresses a supernatural intervention. It does not seem to have any negative connotation. The exact sense of the term must be analysed in relation to the char-acterization of the two would-be assassins as ‘Bacchantes’. Compare Horky 2006 , pp. 389–94. 33 Dickie ( 2001 , p. 76) misinterprets the passage: it is not ‘because the Neuroi are shamans that Herodotus supposes they are goetes , but because they are not what they purport to be... In other words, a goes is for Herodotus a person who is able to create in the mind of others an illusion of what is not’. The go ē s is a deceiver. The causal conjunctive adverb gar ‘for’ makes it plain that the allegation regarding Neuri’s werewolfi sm explains why one may want to call them go ē tes . The epithet has nothing to do with Herodotus’ expression of disbelief, which is, in any case (i.e. without the conjunctive gar ), clearly set off by eme men nun ‘as for my part’ from the related account. This passage is, as far as I know, the one place that the go ē s is associated with a so-called shamanic practice and culture. 34 Graf and Johnston ( 2007 , p. 170 n.33) reject the shamanistic connection. 35 See Graf 1997 , p. 28. Compare Eliade 1964 , pp. 200–36; 182: ‘the shaman is indis-pensable in any ceremony that concerns the experiences of the human soul as such,"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"The divine man, the goēs and the magician 277that is, as a precarious psychic unit, inclined to forsake the body and an easy prey for demons and sorcerers. This is why, all through Asia and North America, and elsewhere as well (e.g., Indonesia), the shaman performs the function of doctor and healer... It is always the shaman who conducts the dead person’s soul to the underworld, for he is the psychopomp par excellence... the shaman is these because he commands the techniques of ecstasy – that is, because his soul can safely aban-don his body and roam at vast distances, can penetrate the underworld and rise to the sky... The danger of losing his way in these forbidden regions is still great; but sanctifi ed by his initiation and furnished with his guardian spirits, the shaman is the only human being able to challenge the danger and venture into a mystical geography’. 36 See Dickie 2001 , p. 30. Dickie continues: ‘ Psychagogoi is a term used for drawing up the spirits of the dead from the Underworld. As for gooi , the term Darius twice employs to refer to the cries with which he is summoned from the grave, it is a word generally used of a funeral lament and belongs to the same root as the word for a sorcerer, goes ’ (Dickie 2001 , p. 30). 37 According to Gordon ( 1987 , p. 78), the word magos entered Greek in the late sixth or early fi fth century and partly replaced the word go ē s . The go ē tes ‘conjurers’ apparently specialized in evoking the daimones . The connection continues in the Greco-Roman literate magic tradition. See Gordon 1987 , p. 65. Dickie’s point in the following passage is lost on me: ‘It does not follow from magos or goes being a term of abuse that the activities which defi ned a man as a magos or goes were in themselves suspect, only that some of the activities pursued by such men were thought questionable’ (Dickie 2001 , p. 36). 38 See Versnel 1990 , pp. 158–75. 39 See Bremmer 1983 , pp. 38–53. The status of the soul in trance is similar to that of the dead. 40 Compare Zuntz 1971 , pp. 189–92. Rightly understood, Pythagoras is neither a man nor a god, according to one of his aretologies. ‘Rather he is the mysterious “included middle”’ (Smith 1978 , p. 200). 41 Kingsley ( 1995a , pp. 226–27) continues: ‘it is certainly no accident that the closest parallel from the ancient literature to Empedocles’ image of a person capable of descending to and returning from the underworld at will is the account by Lucian ( Menippus 6) of the practices of a Zoroastrian magus at Babylon. Not only were these Persians Magi the people who provided the Greeks with their word magos or “magus” in the fi rst place: we also know that their own religious and magical tradi-tions are inextricably linked with the traditions of north-Asiatic shamanism, and a major problem in understanding the infl uence of shamanic traditions on Greeks has been due to the failure to appreciate the role played by Iranians as intermedi-aries in the process of transmission. From the closeness of the parallel in Lucian to Empedocles’ own words in fragment 111 we can understand why later writers felt it natural to make Empedocles a pupil of the Magi. But even more signifi cant is the fact that this tradition of linking him with the East almost certainly goes back to his own lifetime, because the very fi rst reference to him in the surviving body of Greek literature – by his contemporary, Xanthus of Lydia – appears to have presented him in the context of a discussion of the Persian Magi’. Compare Eliade 1958 , p. 64: ‘he who has been successful in such an exploit [i.e. descent to the underworld] no longer fears death; he has conquered a kind of bodily immortality, the goal of all heroic initiations from the time of Gilgamesh... The beyond is also the place of knowledge and of wisdom’. Eliade’s ‘a kind of bodily immortality’ is misleading, at least as a general description. 42 See Beck 1991 , pp. 516–21. 43 See Frame 1978 , pp. 34–80. 44 Compare Bremmer 1983 , pp. 47–48."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"278 The divine man, the goēs and the magician 45 ‘In addition to being “the other”, there are then also two very concrete reasons as to why (all?) Greeks will have looked at the Persian Magi as sorcerers’ (Bremmer 2008 , p. 244). It is to be expected that ‘the other’ has alien customs, e.g. murmur-ing incantation at sacrifi ce. Thus, in Bremmer’s account, the imputation of sor-cery may well be reckoned to the (threatening) foreignness of things Persian. The appeal to ‘the other’ seems to make the ‘two concrete reasons’ redundant. 46 Calling them both ‘system’ does not make them comparable. 47 See Dickie 2001 , pp. 47–95. 48 ‘Medea is an exaggerated version of this representation [e.g. Hesiodic Pandora] of women, dominated by nature, false, scheming and dangerous: and magic is part of the armoury which gives this sex its power’ (Gordon 1987 , p. 83). 49 See Gordon 1987 , p. 73. As far as the word magos is concerned, it regularly means magician and nothing beside in, e.g. Hellenistic wisdom, unless otherwise stated. It is the connection that is made between the magician and Zoroaster that is import-ant and in need of explanation. As for ‘the Persian magus of whom the type is Zoroaster’ (Gordon 1987 , p. 73), in Hellenistic literature, he is not a magician, or at least, not simply a magician. See Bidez and Cumont 1973 , vol. 1. On the other hand, in the most extensive collection of magical texts we have, e.g. the Greek Magical Papyri , that is to say, in the document of literate magic tradition, the ‘great Zoroaster is mentioned only once’ (Betz 1982 , p. 166). 50 See Bremmer 1983 , p. 50. That this account is a ‘pure fi ction’ is hardly the point. Compare Detienne 1963 , pp. 84–87. 51 See Graf 1997 , p. 97: ‘the magician’s colleagues are called “fellow initiates”’, the synmystai , and a ‘magician of superb knowledge becomes “he who introduces to the mysteries”’, the mystag ō gos . Graf ( 1997 , pp. 99–108) shows that the rite of magic not only uses the languages of the mysteries but also takes on their initiation structure. 52 See Betz 1980 , p. 292. 53 Compare Betz 1980 , pp. 294–95: ‘The redactor (of the text of the katabasis rite) has combined (the spells) because they were related to the underworld goddess Hecate and can serve as means to avert “fear”. Luckily, because of this interest he has included what seem to be liturgical remnants from the mysteries of the Idaean Dactyloi, remnants in which scholarship is interested for doubtless quite different reasons.

"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":" 12 Initiation-based youth bands and initiatory sacrifi ce The undeniable connection of the mysteries with fi gures that display shamanistic features does not make the mystery cults shamanistic s é ances; nor, of course, does it mean that the mysteries had their origins in shamanic cultures of the steppes. 1 Mystic initiation rites had neither a simple origin nor, as we know, a unitary manifestation. 2 Certain themes and patterns were shared with offi cial public cults. Manic, carnivalesque behaviour, ecstasy, or perhaps play at ecstasy, equally belonged to the offi cial pomp of Dionysus, the Anthesteria and the country and city Dionysia; 3 and if the ‘ecstatic state’ attained during initiation was deemed to have a cathartic effect (as was also the case in the cult of the Great Mother 4 ), especially for curing madness, and thus became an important constituent of the mysteries of Dionysus, it is hard to see how it could have been different in kind from the ‘liberating’ effects of the public festivals held in honour of the god and the exulted state of the participants. 5 The initiation to the Dionysiac mysteries seems to have employed the same implements as one fi nds in the public procession: the tympanon and the phallus-in- liknon , the snake and winnowing basket, the krater , and the (ithyphallic and masked) satyr – all seen in the initiation scene of the famous fresco of the Villa of the Mysteries at Pompeii. Some of these implements were almost certainly taken up from non-Greek cults, e.g. the tympanon from the cult of the Phrygian Kybele, and possibly, by way of the latter, from the Mesopotamian ritual tradition. 6 But they were absorbed into a particular ideology: an entitlement to a privileged afterlife thanks to membership of an exclusive association acquired through initiation to divinities deemed to have disposition over the fate of the soul. 7 Although ‘Dionysiac initiation is fulfi lled in raving, baccheia ’ (Burkert 1985 , p. 292), the rave per se, shared by the public worshippers of the god, could not have been the point of the mysteries of Dionysus. 8 The role that a component is supposed to have according to the synchronic conception of the whole where it is found does not necessarily reveal its genealogy. The signifi cance of the mirror in Orphic-Dionysiac myth, where it is used to lure the child Dionysus away from the guarding Kouretes to his horrible slaughter, does not ipso facto account for its being part of the ritual in historical (genetic) terms. The doctrine could have found the mirror in its ritual inheritance and mytho-poetically absorbed"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"282 Initiation-based youth bands and sacrifi ceit, thereby covering earlier layers of its signifi cance. Historical phenomena do not have single ‘origins’ but are formed from various currents and disparate elements for a more or less limited duration of time. Possession by the god ( enthousiasmos ) could not have reassured the initiates about their postmortem fate, although this experience defi ned the ‘nature of the god’ (Versnel 1990a , p. 137) and made his epiphany a central feature of the cult (Versnel 1990a , p. 157), whether offi cial, maenadic, symposiac or mystic (see Henrichs 1981 ). Rather it demonstrated a real ‘intimacy’ (Boyanc é in Versnel 1990a , p. 154; Sfemani Gasparro 1985 , p. 15) with the saving god, a basic element in the ideology of the mysteries. Dionysus was a perfect mystic god. 9 There are indications that the initiation-based association, that is to say, the mysteries in their formal aspect, developed from the seemingly pan-Indo-European initiation-based masculine bands. Dedication to a special type of god for a specifi c purpose could have emerged within the frame of initiation as a ‘second birth’. 10 The formal structure of initiation explains a number of features reported about the mysteries. The suffering that the initiate undergoes may be understood as the formation of a new identity and of a new social bond, which can override the normal social relations of the initiate. What in normal society is prohibited is all the more valued in the esoteric association because of its differentiating charge. Orgies and intoxication serve this pur-pose, possibly among others. But they also precipitate ecstasy (at least this is what has been supposed), the ‘extraordinary experience’, which for commen-tators, ancient and modern, forms the psychological centre of the mysteries. 11 An exhilarated state of consciousness was a real feature of the mysteries of Dionysus and Kybele and, perhaps in a more mitigated form, of Demeter and Kore. 12 The positive evaluation of extreme forms of ritual rage and abandon should perhaps be traced to initiation rites of the late Neolithic masculine youth bands. 13 ‘The mother and the maiden, Kore, stand side by side, meeting in the course of the secret rituals of the M ä nnerbund ’ (Burkert 1983 , p. 82). The connection is not merely hypothetical. The presence of Kouretes (‘war-like lads’) in the aetiological myths related to the mysteries links these to the initiation of young men in esoteric rituals. 14 There are also stories that con-nect heroes with initiation rites of manhood and of warrior status. Nakedness is associated with the warlike state and virility: the warrior and athlete alike take to the battlefi eld naked. Achilles disguised as a girl on Skyros, upon hear-ing the sound of trumpet or seeing weapons, strips off his clothes in order to reveal his manly physique. The festival of Ekdysia , ‘stripping’, in honour of Leto at Phaistos recalls the story of the girl who stripped off and changed into a powerful ephebos . Stripping to reveal one’s manly body must have been a routine feature of tribal and puberty initiation and, stylized and enhanced with warlike behaviour such as the war dance (e.g. the Kouretes clashing their weapons around the child-god’s cradle), it became part of warrior initiation. 15 If a recent analysis of the Nordic berserkir is correct, the word means ‘bare-skinned’ and thus berserksgangr ‘going berserk’, stripping for the battlefi eld or ritual or contest, refers to the manic state of the warrior who disdains"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Initiation-based youth bands and sacrifi ce 283protective armour. 16 The masculine-band background, in other words, is not limited to the mysteries and can be found in the heroic-quest myths that have the structure of initiation, such as the story of Theseus. 17 In this respect, the mysteries are not exceptional. They developed an ancient form of association for their own purposes, or perhaps one should say that one of the ways in which the initiation-based masculine association evolved was the mystery cult. 18 Kouretes or Korybantes are found in a number of stories related to the mysteries. 19 According to one tradition (Diodorus, Library of History 5.65), they were thought to have been the inventors, among other items of civiliza-tion, of the sword and the helmet, and the war dance, ‘by means of which they raised a great alarm and deceived Kronos’. Myth places the Kouretes on Crete, especially in the sacred caves of Ida and Dikte, each said to be the birthplace of Zeus. ‘This refl ects a cult association of young warriors meeting at the grotto of Mount Ida, and brandishing their shields in war dances to which the bronze tympana and votive shields of Orientalizing style give early testimony’ (Burkert 1985 , p. 262). The ivory pyxis with Dionysiac scenes (at the Museo Civico Archeologico di Bologna) from sixth century AD depicts the Kouretes dancing around an enthroned child Dionysus, whose gaze seems fi xed on the sinister female fi gure (possibly Hera) holding up a mirror. Here we have in pictorial representation a transparent coincidence of ritual and myth, that is, a ritual drama. It is true that the Korybantic implements in the mysteries of Dionysus have been related to the cult of the Phrygian Mother, which saw enthroned initiation candidates surrounded by frenzied dancers with tympana , etc. 20 Sabazios, the Phrygian double of Dionysus, was insepar-able from the Korybantes, ecstatic dancing and ritual consumption of alco-hol. Be that as it may, festivals of admission of male initiates as a full member of the tribe, with attendant tribulations and triumphant celebrations, seem to have been a common phenomenon, 21 the basis perhaps for the adoption of foreign items which were deemed particularly impressive, e.g. ‘shields of Orientalizing style’. The annual gathering of the Aetolians at one of the earli-est temples of Apollo in Thermos was the occasion where new members who had come of age were admitted into the society of men. 22 The ‘orientaliz-ing’ elements perhaps indicate confl uent currents rather than a genetic origin. Multiple developments of a basic pattern with lateral reciprocal infl uences is a much more realistic picture than a unilateral importation of a fi nished product. What sets the masculine band apart from puberty initiation in general is its voluntary and esoteric nature, and perhaps its dedication to warlike activity, although this latter has also been posited for tribal initiations. 23 Because it is voluntary, the association must be assumed to use all means to enhance its identity and inculcate the required characteristics in its members. One thus expects to see warrior-styled behaviours and patterns in initiation rituals of the esoteric masculine bands. Such patterns are present in the Orphic anthro-pogony. An Orpheus tradition explicitly connected the fi gure with the Daktyloi"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"284 Initiation-based youth bands and sacrifi ce(see below). The sequence of the dismemberment of an enthroned ‘child’ in a cave surrounded by a band of masked warriors and his subsequent ‘re-birth’ refl ects initiation rite and a martial background. 24 The raging gypsum-faced men, the Titans of the myth, 25 dismember the sacrifi cial victim, boil and roast it, and feast on it. In a typical initiation pattern, the ‘double’ of the initiate is put to death, a ‘double’ that is also the releasing god. 26 It is quite possible that an aspect of the initiation was the ostentatious commitment of the candidate to the esoteric deity in the course of the god’s epiphany. 27 Behind the ritual drama of crime, ensuing feeling of guilt and conciliatory closure, 28 one may want to see social-functional reasons. In a controlled form and isolated from society, mad frenzy is allowed to take hold for a limited time and thereby dis-sipate, as Aristotle ( Poetics 1449b) thought the tragic stage does with terror. But the social-functional explanation would then have to appeal to ‘natural’ impulses (which need purging) or accept, at least as a hypothesis, institutional formations that can account, e.g. for the eccentric behaviour. It would be wrong, again, to derive all the elements of mystery initiation from a single origin or attribute them to a single function. Any rite is composed of a num-ber of historical layers, and its synchronic coherence is ever only an assump-tion, not only on the part of the observer but also for the actor. In part, the myth ‘explains’ for the participant the rite to which it is attached, which does not preclude mutual interaction. As far as I can see, the initiation structure of the mysteries and the warlike themes in the myths associated with them point to a background in initiation-based youth bands. The story that Plato ( Republic 565d) tells of the sanctuary of Lykaian Zeus in Arcadia must be based in an esoteric-initiatory tradition: ‘he who tastes of one bit of human entrails minced up with those of other victims is inevitably transformed into a wolf ’. According to Pausanias, Periegesis 8.38.2–7, the sacrifi ce at the altar of Zeus the Wolf on Mount Lykaion took place ‘in secret’. The cruel dismem-berment sacrifi ces ( sparagmos ) reported by Pausanias ( Periegesis 8.37.8) for the sanctuary of the enigmatic Despoina in Arcadia, where ‘each man chops off a limb of the victim, just that which happens to come to hand’, are hardly understandable in terms of ‘the paradoxical logic of sacrifi ce’ whereby one has to take life in order to promote life. 29 Even if ‘sacrifi ce is ritual killing’ (Burkert 1966 , p. 106), why the ostentatious cruelty where one would expect, according to the logic of committing an unwanted but necessary act, a guilty attempt at concealment? 30 Prometheus’ presentation of the bones of the sacrifi ced animal covered with fat to Zeus as if it were the whole animal may be rooted in magic practices of the primordial hunters appeasing the Master of Animals. 31 This may refl ect the hunter’s natural concern about the continuity of life: he is anxious to pre-serve his source of food (Burkert 1966 , p. 109). 32 If so, in its pretence of inno-cence it may be thought to tally with the ‘paradoxical logic’ that one’s life can be sustained only by killing (but see further below); 33 ritual acts of extrava-gant cruelty, however, are not really comprehensible according to this logic. Also, I am less confi dent than Burkert that the purpose of the ‘unspeakable"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Initiation-based youth bands and sacrifi ce 285sacrifi ce’ reported for the mysteries of Demeter was to enact symbolically and therefore sublimate socially disruptive instincts, ‘gruesomeness and sex-ual outbursts fi nally overcome in the establishment of a divine order’ (Burkert 1983 , p. 284). 34 Generally speaking, the social-functional explanation 35 of rit-ual rage and cruelty need not be incompatible with seeing in such phenomena warlike ritual practices. Aggression operative in hunt and war fulfi ls itself in killing. However, the aggression-level stress cannot go unchecked. 36 Its mani-festations are followed by reconciliation, which ensures the continuation of life and society. Perhaps reconciliation is motivated or accompanied by the feeling of guilt, at least in some cases. One may well think that the ‘warlike’ or ‘savage’ ritual preserves and controls impulses of aggression in its valoriza-tion and celebration of warlike behaviour. But social institutions cannot be reduced to psychological or instinctual drives, as if a ‘natural’ impulse could explain the form and function of the institution. Diodorus ( Library of History 5.64.4) relates a tradition that he apparently found in the fourth-century historian Ephorus: ‘the Idaean Daktyls were born in the region of Mount Ida in Phrygia; they migrated with Mygdon to Europe. Being go ē tes , they spent their time with spells ( ep ō idai ), initiations and mystery cults. When they were living about the island of Samothrace, they quite frightened the indigenous inhabitants with all these things. At this time also, Orpheus became their student, although his different nature had fi rst driven him to poetry and music; and it was he who fi rst brought ini-tiations and mystery cults to the Greeks’. 37 The Daktyloi Idaioi or Kabeiroi were also called Korybantes (cf. Clement, Protrepticus 2.19), the sons of the Mother Goddess, who settled them on Samothrace; but the identity of their father was only revealed to the initiates of their cult. On Lemnos the Kabeiroi were smiths and hence known as Hephaistoi. 38 The connection of metallurgy with magic is very old. There was an ancient Kabirion on the island: ‘the con-tinuity of cult from pre-Greek to the Greek era is astounding. A community of initiates would gather there for secret celebrations in which wine played a major role. As worshippers of the mythical smithies, they were probably a M ä nnerbund which modeled itself on a smithy guild’ (Burkert 1983 , pp. 194–95). The Telchines (Daktyloi) were known to be go ē tes and ‘could even do what the magi of Persia could’ do (Diodorus, Library of History 5.55.3). The Kouretes and the divine smiths Daktyloi refl ect the initiation-based society of men dedicated to the cult of the Mother Goddess. Their identifi cation in vari-ous myths shows their fundamental affi nity. As we saw, the go ē s was able to make contact with the world of the dead. The Daktyloi are said to be go ē tes , and being so they perform initiations and mystery cults. The magical spells ( ep ō idai ) are in the service of activities one can suppose for the go ē tes . The tradition preserved by Ephorus made the Daktyloi the source of the mysteries in Greece via Orpheus, who became an adept of their craft, ‘though in nature being different’. Obviously the ‘manly’ business of the Daktyloi did not go with music and poetry. Orpheus was regularly represented as the founder of the mysteries. In the myth, secret societies of men are thus the matrix of the"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"286 Initiation-based youth bands and sacrifi ceinitiation-based organization of the mystery cults. Strabo ( Geography 7.330, frg. 18) calls Orpheus ‘a go ē s who fi rst peddled music along with divination and mystery rituals, but later thought more highly of himself and attracted crowds and power’ (in Graf and Johnston 2007 , p. 171). 39 For Pausanias ( Periegesis 9.30.4), Orpheus was a poet who, initiated into the society of Daktyloi, was known to have discovered the mysteries and purifi cation from sins by initiation. There is another myth that connects Orpheus with esoteric masculine soci-eties. In the story told by Conon, Orpheus performs initiations for a warrior group in Leibethra, located in the Pieria region near Mount Olympus, origin-ally settled by Thracians. The town had a sanctuary to Orpheus. Women were forbidden to enter the sacred precincts. In the story, Orpheus is represented as the king of Thrace and Macedonia. ‘On certain days, Orpheus assembled the warriors of Macedonia and Thrace in a building well equipped for initiation ( teletai ); when celebrating these rituals, they had to leave their weapons out-side. The women resented being excluded’ (Graf 1987 , p. 87). One day they helped themselves to the weapons and, fi nding the men drunk, tore Orpheus to pieces and threw the parts into the sea. Pausanias ( Periegesis 9.30.5) cites this as the reason why the Thracian warriors intoxicate themselves before tak-ing to the battlefi eld, probably reversing the real relation between the andr ē ō n and the battlefi eld. The connection of the myth with the masculine society can hardly be clearer. Orpheus is an initiator for a society of warriors. The link between the poet and diviner on the one hand and the founder of the mysteries on the other is Orpheus’ involvement with the initiation-based mas-culine society. It is, then, a reasonable hypothesis that it is from this type of association that the mystery cults take their esoteric-initiatory structure and a number of their elements such as raving and dancing. 40 Orpheus and charismatic fi gures such as Epimenides, Empedocles and Pythagoras are composite characters. Their capacity to acquire ‘true’ know-ledge, which Hesiod ( Theogony lines 10–45) ascribes to the inspired singer, and the Vedas to the kavi , unquestionably has Indo-European roots. 41 The seer’s extraordinary knowledge of ‘reality’ is acquired through his ability to separate his psych ē from his body and thus ‘contemplate’ the invisible. Based on his access to the supernatural realm are his healing and saving abilities. Burkert makes a convincing case for the enrichment of the Indo-European healer through Near Eastern infl uences, especially during the ‘orientalizing’ period (the eighth to the sixth century BC ). However, we must not forget that healing by way of spells is attested in the Atharvaveda; 42 and behind the seem-ingly eschatological G ā thic ‘healer of existence’ ( ahūm.bi š - ) perhaps stands an ancient (i.e. Indo-European) tradition of therapeutic use of ritual: ratu- . 43 The historical emergence of the eschatological ‘releaser’ is perhaps more complex. Strabo says, as mentioned above, that Orpheus was not content with being a diviner and musician but ‘attracted crowds and power’. In other words, he pretended to found a life programme, including, it seems, 44 not just dietetic medicine and general purity norms of conduct bearing on different aspects of"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Initiation-based youth bands and sacrifi ce 287life, but also rules related to the afterlife (cf. Plato Phaedrus 244d–e). There is a natural tendency in an ideology such as the one attributed to Orpheus toward establishing religious communities. 45 At least in the case of Pythagoreans this is an undisputed historical fact. The divine man’s akousmata ‘things heard’, i.e. exoteric precepts, were observed among the southern Italian Pythagorean communities. Here we have a case where a ‘son of god’ 46 and, perhaps, hiero-phant of Mater Magna with shamanistic claims 47 founds communities based in observance of authoritative precepts, on which, among other things, one’s possibility of salvation depends. 48 But not all who received initiation converted to Orphism. For them, cer-tainly the majority, the initiation rite itself ensured the ‘blessed’ afterlife they were anxious to secure for themselves. Plato’s remarkable description, albeit with an incredulous tone and sarcasm, of the ‘begging priests and seers’ in the Republic 364b–366b is perhaps the most comprehensive testimony we have of their claims and practices. Parker ( 2005 , p. 121) says of Plato’s seers: ‘perhaps we should recognize late survivors of the kind of charismatic all-purpose man of god best illustrated for us by Empedocles’. The departed soul goes to ‘the world below’, according to the Orphic doctrine, and there receives a judge-ment. The orpheotelestai believe they have ‘accumulated a treasure of power from the gods’, which allows them to perform effi cacious teletai that ‘deliver us from misfortunes ( kak ō n ) in that other world, while terrible things await those who have neglected to sacrifi ce’. Orphic rites, derived from the books of Orpheus and Musaeus (‘poets and messengers’ and ‘sons of the gods’), ‘expiate and cure’. The gods who preside over the initiation rites are called the ‘absolving gods’ ( lysioi theoi ). In one of the Pelinna gold leaves, the departed initiate is reminded to ‘tell Persephone that the Bacchic One himself released ( elyse ) you’ (Graf and Johnston 2007 , pp. 36–37). Behind the ‘pleasurable games’ of the Republic 364b, with which the mendicant holy men expiate and cure, may well stand the ‘sportive gambols’ of the ‘Korybantic rites’ of initi-ation we fi nd in the image given of the mysteries in Plato, Euthydemus 277de. The tradition from Conon about Orpheus that makes him an initiator for a warrior society and the one reported by Ephorus that makes him a pupil of the Daktyloi, although ‘being of a different nature’, are, to my mind, sure indications that the ritual practices of esoteric youth societies continued in some way in the mysteries. There is a similar story, related by Porphyry ( Vita Pythagoras 17), about Pythagoras: on Crete he was initiated to the cult of Zeus (and the Daktyloi?) in the Idaean cave by one of the Daktyloi. He was wrapped in ‘black wool’, probably imitating Zeus himself, 49 for the purposes of purifi cation. The Idaean Zeus, the father, is probably no other than Dionysus, the son, as their identical epithets (Chthonios, Zagreus) seem to suggest. The Megistos Kouros of the Cretan Palaikastro inscription from third century BC has been identifi ed as the Zeus kouros . The connection with the Kouretes and the apparent death of the young god points to the existence of similar stories about the Cretan Zeus and Dionysus (their birth, nursery and enthronement in the cave) and ultimately to a tradition of initiation into an esoteric male"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"288 Initiation-based youth bands and sacrifi cecult. 50 The strange episode of Pythagoras’ inscription of an epigram on Zeus’ tomb on Mount Ida, too, suggests that the god that presides over the initi-ation dies. It would be hard to deny that the initiation of Pythagoras and the apprenticeship of Orpheus with the Daktyloi, among others, refl ect histor-ical connections between mystic initiation and the society of men. Burkert ( 1985 , pp. 278–81) draws attention to the ‘clan and family mysteries’, which seem to have developed from tribal or puberty initiation festivals. But, even here, Korybantic elements, e.g. cruel sacrifi ces and warlike behaviour, are attested. On balance, it seems to me, the initiation form of the mysteries must be related to a type of ceremony that was characteristic of initiation-based men’s associations. It is diffi cult to say whether dedication to a specifi c type of deity was a feature of these associations, although, generally speaking, dying gods or deities of the underworld seem to have been favoured for the role. 51 In any case, in the mysteries, initiation is always to the gods that are traditionally connected with the world of the dead. The initiatory sacrifi ce had a special signifi cance. In the mysteries of Eleusis there was a preliminary sacrifi ce of a piglet to Demeter. The pig sacrifi ce was, of course, a common feature of the cult of the goddess. But the preliminary sacrifi ce of the young pig by the myst ē s had the peculiarity of being individu-alized. Each candidate had to bring his or her own animal. But this is not all. ‘The Greeks mentioned explicitly that the initiate surrendered the ani-mal to death “in his stead” and that a life was exchanged for a life’ (Burkert 1983 , p. 258). 52 Parker ( 1983 , p. 283) points out that the key phrase means ‘on behalf of himself ’ rather than ‘instead of himself ’. The word choiros ‘piglet’ was apparently the slang for female genitals. Piglets were deposited into a pit ( megaron ) on the fi rst day of the Thesmophoria celebrated in honour of Demeter and Kore. 53 The myth of Hades’ abduction of Persephone associ-ated her disappearance into the underworld with the sinking of Eubuleus’ grazing pigs into the earth, according to the aition for the Thesmophoria. The swineherd shared a priest at Eleusis with the ‘god’ and ‘goddess’ (probably Pluton and Persephone, but see Clinton 1992 , pp. 62–63). A fi gure on a num-ber of vases with Eleusinian themes has been identifi ed as Eubuleus guiding Kore from the underworld to Eleusis (Clinton 1992 , 71–73). If so, the same fi gure is connected with the chthonic scene and the epiphany of the queen of the underworld at the Eleusinian mysteries. Clinton ( 1992 , pp. 58–60) argues that this Eubuleus may well represent in a transposed ‘hero’ form the approachable underworld ruler Zeus Eubuleus, worshipped in a divine triad with Demeter and Kore throughout the Greek world, at Eleusis where Pluton serves the cultic function. In one of the versions of Agamemnon’s sacrifi ce of Iphigeneia, he is required by Artemis to surrender his daughter in expiation for his killing a stag in the goddess’s sacred grove; before the actual slaughter, however, a doe is substituted for the girl. 54 But what does this three-way rela-tionship mean: the initiate kills the piglet ‘on behalf of himself ’, which also signifi es the maiden being sacrifi ced? If the maiden is the equivalent of the sacrifi cial animal, the candidate dispatches the maiden into the underworld"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Initiation-based youth bands and sacrifi ce 289on his own behalf, that is, in order to achieve something for the dispatcher. Burkert ( 1983 , p. 162) interprets the rape of Kore as a ‘maiden-sacrifi ce’, and understands the latter to have the character of a renunciation (pig = maiden = Kore) in the expectation of something more valuable (grain, the gift of nourishment, from Demeter). For ‘the receptive initiate, the routine sacrifi ce of the “mystery pig” could always assume a deeper dimension: standing there at the edge of death, he destroys a life in his stead; the act of killing is irrev-ocable and yet must provoke an answer. The scales of life’s equilibrium have been tipped and, if an equilibrium exists at all at the center of being, the scales must swing back again. It is the hope of the initiate that the path into death will lead to life’ (Burkert 1983 , p. 264). It is not clear in what sense the last statement should be understood: that the gods are obliged to let the donor of the sacrifi cial victim live? That a ‘receptive initiate’ would have refl ected on the slaughter of the animal and seen in it Burkert’s ‘paradoxical logic’ of sacrifi ce, life for life, seems implausible to me. In any event, renunciation in anticipation of a greater gain (by forcing the hand of the god) hardly suits the tragic consciousness, which sees in sacrifi ce a reminder of the paradox that continuation of life depends on killing. The mystery maiden-pig as the initi-ate’s sacrifi cial advocate must have had another meaning. The myst ē s expects to have a blissful existence once he has crossed to the world of the dead thanks to his or her initiation into the mysteries. Initiation anticipates the process of dying and the subsequent journey of the soul. 55 It entitles the initiate to a capable guide and imparts the necessary know-ledge. This is implied in Plato, Phaedo 108a: ‘the path [to the lower world] is neither simple nor single, for if it were, there would be no need of guides, since no one could miss the way to any place if there were only one road. But really there seem to be many forks of the road and many windings; this I infer from the rites and ceremonies practiced here on earth’. A text from Plutarch (frg. 178 in Graf and Johnston 2007 , p. 158) says that the soul ‘undergoes the same experiences as those who are initiated into the great mystery rituals; this is why the word telet ē “initiation rites” echoes the word teleut ē “end, death” and the reality of initiation echoes the reality of death’. One rehearses the journey to the world beyond in initiation, made concrete in the victim: the ‘double’. 56 If dying is the condition of attaining a god-like existence, then, as the epitaph of a hierophant has it, ‘death is not only not an evil, but good’ (cf. Plato, Phaedo 67d–e). In a grave gold leaf found in Hipponion (Graf and Johnston 2007 , pp. 4–5), the initiate is reassured: ‘you, too, having drunk [i.e. from the Lake of Memory], will go along the sacred road on which other glorious initiates and bacchoi travel’. We also have Aristophanes’ barbed remark in the Frogs that the mystai of Demeter will go on celebrating their festivals in the underworld. 57 Conversely, the ini-tiate believes he has the same experiences as the departing soul. The text from Plutarch (frg. 178) continues, ostensibly describing the experiences of the soul of the initiate as it enters the underworld: ‘Wanderings astray in the beginning, tiresome walkings in circles, some frightening paths in darkness"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"290 Initiation-based youth bands and sacrifi cethat lead nowhere; then immediately before the end of all the terrible things, panic and shivering and sweat, and amazement. And then some wonderful light comes to meet you, pure regions and meadows are there to greet you, with sounds and dances and solemn, sacred words and holy views; and there the initiate, perfect by now, set free and loose from all bondage, walks about, crowned with a wreath, celebrating the festival together with the other sacred and pure people, and he looks down on the uninitiated, unpurifi ed crowd in this world in mud and fog beneath his feet’ (in Burkert 1987 , pp. 91–92). It is almost certain that what Plutarch is describing are actually the events of the Telesterion at Eleusis. 58 The uncanny epiphany of Kore must have had, among other things, the signifi cance of the anticipated confrontation with the goddess in the underworld, the point where dread comes to an end, and the release (both psychological and juridical) is followed by joyous celebra-tions. The knowledge that the initiate received contained, according to the testimony of the gold leaves (see Graf and Johnston 2007 , pp. 4–49), infor-mation about the geography and conditions of the underworld; and, in a sense, he did enact the passage to the world beyond in his initiation: from dying, i.e. consecration, 59 through walking the sacred road to Eleusis and reaching the grotto of the lord of the underworld, beyond which no uniniti-ated may venture on pain of death, and fi nally to the nocturnal celebrations at the Telesterion. 60 If the experience of initiation had a reassuring effect regarding death, as Demosthenes ( Discourses 19.199, 249, 281) and Aristotle ( Politics 8.1342a) report, it was because in the mind of the myst ē s , the mys-teries staged the passage to the ‘pure regions and meadows’ of the under-world; they made the uncanny event somewhat familiar and inculcated the belief that success in the former guaranteed success in the latter. 61 The sacrifi ce that each candidate of initiation made thus had to have a spe-cial signifi cance. One’s death is the condition of access to the ‘pure’ regions and precincts. 62 This condition was perhaps fulfi lled for the initiate by the double, the piglet-maiden. So, in some sense, the victim is the substitute of the sacrifi cer. In his article on the ‘psychological category of the double’, Vernant ( 2006 , p. 331) shows that the kolossos had the function of mediating between the worlds of the living and the dead. ‘It is one of the forms that the psuch ē – as a power from beyond – can adopt when it makes itself visible to human beings’ (Vernant 2006 , p. 325). The grief-stricken Laodameia makes an eid ō lon of her dead husband Protesilaus and embraces this double each night. When her father fi nds out, he has the wax effi gy cast in the fi re. ‘Laodameia throws herself in after it, in order to follow Protesilaus into the beyond... whether it is used to brings the shades of the dead back to the light of day or to send the living down among the shades, the kolossos , as a double, always establishes a link between the living and the underworld’ (Vernant 2006 , p. 327). The double symbolically embodies the psych ē in its ambiguous status: a form of visibility that belongs to the invisible realm, and a means of communication of the power of the beyond in the world of the living. Thus, it is not merely a sign but an effective power, ‘activated’ by means of ritual (Vernant 2006 ,"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"Initiation-based youth bands and sacrifi ce 291p. 331). The passage between the realms of life and death that characterizes the various forms of the double (dream images, apparitions, etc.) in Vernant’s account seems to determine the nature of the ‘preliminary sacrifi ce’ in the Eleusinian mysteries. Being consecrated to the realm of death, the myst ē s has to play a double game; 63 and this is exactly what he does, since initiation is to undergo death while still living. The victim is thus ‘symbolically’ the double (substitute) of the initiate’s psych ē , and its death ‘ritually’ counts as the death of the initiate. But the animal victim as the initiate’s substitute is the ‘double’ in another connection, which gives its fundamental sense to the scenario of initiation as a crossing to the realm of death. The ‘double’ re-enacts the prim-ordial passage of the god to the realm of the dead. The notion of sacrifi cial double has a clear Vedic refl ection in the myth of Yama, the aboriginal psychopomp, and in the Br ā hman \u0004 ic doctrine of the sacrifi cial death. 64 Like his father, the sun (Vivasvant), Yama is immortal, but chooses to die in order to mark out the path to the abode of the Pitr \u0005 s. In dying and making his way to the beyond, Yama is the prototype of humanity. ‘Yama was the fi rst to fi nd the way for us, this pasture that shall not be taken away’ (RV 10.14.2ab). 65 The kind of immortality mortals can have consists in existence in the kingdom of Yama by way of death. 66 In his illuminating study of the Vedic fi gure, Malamoud ( 2002 , p. 16) remarks that the connec-tion between the three constitutive aspects of humanity as conceived in Vedic thought, namely being mortal, being related to the sun 67 and having a double, ‘est à la fois confi rm é e et rendue plus intelligible par la fi gure de Yama’. Yama is not just the prototype but also the progenitor of mortals. 68 Procreation and immortality are incompatible; the engendered creature must die. Death is the negation of the conditions of earthly life: generation and the passing of generations. Death thus annihilates time. Every dead person can become an ‘ancestor’, that is, without any relation to time. Still, it is not death as such that allows access to the timeless realm of Yama. The members of succes-sive generations reach the kingdom of the ancestors only through sacrifi cial death. 69 Yama as the ‘poet of the Pitr \u0005 s’ has opened the path of ‘ritual speech’, followed by the r \u0005 s \u0004 is ‘seers’. Finally, Yama is also the lord of the dead, which to the living means the god of death, the ‘collector of men’, as a hymn from the R \u0003 gveda (10.14.7–8) puts it: ‘[to the dead man] Go forth, go forth on those ancient paths on which our ancient fathers passed beyond... Unite with the fathers, with Yama, with the rewards of your sacrifi ces and good deeds, in the highest heaven’ (translation from Doniger O’Flaherty 1981 , p. 44). ‘C’est en tant que dieu qu’il est la mort, et en tant que “premier des mortels” qu’il guide les d é funts vers le lieu o ù ils pourront “vivre” comme anc ê tres’ (Malamoud 2002 , p. 22). Yama ‘twin’ is sometimes the brother of Manu, who is born from the double of Yama’s mother Saran \u0004 yū. 70 Being wearied of the burning contact of her husband Vivasvant, Saran \u0004 yū fl ees and hides, but takes the precaution of making a replica of herself, Savarn \u0004 ā . Now, Manu is known not only as the ‘fi rst man’ in the Vedas but also as the fi rst sacrifi cer ( yajam ā na ). 71 In the"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"292 Initiation-based youth bands and sacrifi ce Śatapatha Br ā hman \u0004 a (I.1.4.14–17) Manu sacrifi ces his wife Man ā v ī , whose voice captured in the sacrifi cial vessels is asura-killing. Man ā v ī is probably also Manu’s sister, and behind her, as Lincoln ( 1975 , p. 134) maintains, stands Yama. 72 Yama’s ‘choosing to die’ is simultaneously understood as his sacrifi ce. 73 Every sacrifi cial victim is supposed to give its ‘consent’ before immolation. Yama makes his way to the underworld as a sacrifi cial victim. 74 He also seems to be the fi gure behind the ‘cosmic man’, Purus \u0004 a, of the fam-ous R \u0003 gvedic hymn 10.90, from whose sacrifi ce and dismemberment the cos-mos is created. 75 Here again we fi nd the notion that the victim is the ‘twin’ of the sacrifi cer: ‘dans les sacrifi ces comportant immolation d’animaux, la victime, avant d’ ê tre mise à mort, doit ê tre attach é e à un poteau ( yūpa ) qui a pour hauteur la taille du sacrifi ant’ (Malamoud 2002 , p. 32). Sacrifi ce is the path of immortality for the mortal because the sacrifi cial victim is the double of the consecrated sacrifi cer. In a sense, in the victim, the d ī ks \u0004 ita is put to death – and reborn to a god-like existence. 76 Consecration of the candidate and sacrifi ce of the animal are identical (not parallel) in the Vedic logic of correspondences. 77 In the ceremony of consecration of the king ( r ā jasūya ), he is vowed to death in his divine double King Soma, who suffers a sacrifi cial death, by which the consecrated king becomes the hidden brahman , the supernatural power embodied in sacrifi ce. 78 Consecration d ī ks \u0004 ā is thus a ‘deathlike condition’ (Heesterman 1993 , p. 171). In another soma sacrifi ce, connected with chariot racing and intended to win the vital force v ā ja , 79 a wheel-shaped cake symbolizing the sun is attached to the top of the sacrifi cial post yūpa . The sacrifi cer climbs a ladder placed next to the post and calls to his wife: ‘come, wife, let us climb to the sun’; then he ascends the ladder, holds the wheel, and says: ‘we have reached the sun, O you gods!’ 80 There cannot be any question that reaching the sun means attaining the divine sphere. The post-R \u0003 gvedic ritual association of the yūpa and the god Vis \u0004 n \u0004 u is based on the idea that both span the three spheres, earth, atmos-phere and the heavens, and both are thought to prop up the sky. Vis \u0004 n \u0004 u holds up uttaram \r sadhastham , the ‘highest assembly place’ (RV 1.154.1bc), ‘which is the abode of the gods and the pious, and is equivalent to heaven’ (Proferes 2003 , pp. 336–37). Hence we have a series of correspondences that make the sacrifi cial death of the sacrifi cer the condition of his achieving super-natural power and, ultimately, immortality. 81 In respect of the latter, as I mentioned above, sacrifi ce alone permits the deceased to enter the realm of Yama. But in an important sense, the living too is subject to Yama by way of the ordained sacrifi ce that maintains the dead ancestors in Yama’s kingdom. According to Malamoud ( 2002 , p. 29), there is a deeper sense in which the liv-ing is indebted to Yama, who is the ‘ultimate creditor’ of man. Surrendering one’s life in sacrifi ce (consecration) is making good the debt which one incurs as soon as one is born. 82 Being generated, man is mortal, whose immortal-ity can only have the nature of a sacrifi cial achievement. Yama ‘renounced’ his immortality in order to discover/make the way to the underworld. He is thus both the model and the creditor of the mortal. In sacrifi cial death the"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"Initiation-based youth bands and sacrifi ce 293sacrifi cer both pays his debt and follows the primordial model. 83 The par-ticular identifi cation of the sacrifi cer and sacrifi cial victim in the Br ā hman \u0004 ic doctrine has a mediating term, the model and creditor Yama, which makes the procedure understandable. The speculative literature on purus \u0004 amedha ‘human sacrifi ce’ has the wife of the victim listen to the same exhortation addressed to the principal wife of the deceased on the funerary pyre. 84 Human sacrifi ce, according to the Br ā hman \u0004 ic works on the matter, is the model of the a ś vamedha , the most elaborate royal sacrifi ce, where the wife of the sacrifi cer lies with the immolated horse in an apparent simulation of sexual union. Via its model, the human sacrifi ce, the episode in the horse sacrifi ce points to the doctrinal basis of both, namely the identity of the sacrifi cer and sacrifi cial animal. 85 ‘Si l’ é pouse du sacrifi ant est consid é r é e, en la circonstance, comme la veuve du purus \u0004 a immol é , n’est-ce pas aussi que le sacrifi ant, le mari bien vivant de cette femme, se reconna î t en quelque sorte dans la victime morte?’ 86 The Br ā hman \u0004 as view the immolation of the animal as the recovery or redemption of the sacrifi cer’s own person, who in d ī ks \u0004 ā , the preliminary consecration, has surrendered himself to the gods. ‘In truth he enters into the mouth of Agni and Soma, the one who goes through d ī ks \u0004 ā . When he immolates a victim to Agni and Soma, it is for him a recovery of his own person ( ā tmanis \u0004 krayan \u0004 a ). Having, by the vic-tim, redeemed his own person, become free of debt, he performs a sacrifi ce ( yajate ). This is the reason why one should not eat from this victim; for it is a human as image ( purus \u0004 o hi sa pratimay ā )’ ( Kaus \u0004 ī taki Br ā hman \u0004 a 10.3). It is only in surrendering his mortal life in consecration that man can enter the realm of the Pitr \u0005 s. But in substituting the animal, the sacrifi cer can perform the sacrifi ce that allows him to escape annihilation. This, at any rate, seems to be the paradoxical logic of the sacrifi cial double in the doctrine. One has to subject oneself to death in order to go beyond it. ‘Man, once born, is born in person as a debt to death; when he sacrifi ces, he redeems himself from death’ ( Śatapatha Br ā hman \u0004 a 3.6.2.16). In every sacrifi cial drama, the yajam ā na personally takes part not only as the one who performs his duties toward the gods but also as the follower of Yama. Yama, the god who chooses to die in order to show the way to the place of immortality to his descendants, is not just the creditor of the mortal but also the prototypical victim. He is the creditor because he is the primordial ‘double’. Every sacrifi ce rehearses the passage of the divine ‘twin’; every vic-tim is a ‘double’ after the god who made the way to the realm of death. This symbolic re-enactment of the drama of a god who becomes mortal in order to fi nd the way to immortality defi nes the potency of Br ā hman \u0004 ic sacrifi ce. Paradoxically, the sacrifi cer makes good his debt to Yama by incurring fur-ther debt, since the victim is the double both of the sacrifi cer and of the god. It is possible that the god Yama emerged from the fi gure of the consecrated animal or human victim. 87 The myth of Yama, especially in its Br ā hman \u0004 ic treatment, shows that the idea of sacrifi ce with an eschatological intent is very ancient, going back to the Indo-European times. 88"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"294 Initiation-based youth bands and sacrifi ce Notes 1 Compare Eliade 1964 , pp. 375–427. 2 See Burkert 1987 . Robertson ( 2003 , pp. 219–22) maintains that myths and rites of mystic initiation developed from those that were associated with the public cults of Greek cities, especially those of Demeter and Dionysus, and ultimately from the ritual of the pastoral goddess Rhea. She also appears as the ‘Mother of the Gods’ whose cult stands behind Greek theogonies, ‘the gods being all the lesser powers of nature’ (Robertson 2003 , p. 221). Compare Sourvinou-Inwood 1995 , pp. 17ff. According to Robertson ( 2003 , p. 220), the ‘original Greek initi-ates or mystai did not join a separate social group, a tribe or sect... Only when the community effort began to lose its hold did mystai form private associations, like the Orphics’. Joining a separate group was a marginal phenomenon throughout Greek antiquity. The only certain case is the Pythagorean community of south-ern Italy. See Burkert 1982 . In any case, Robertson’s criticism of ‘initiation rites as a topic of comparative religion’ is a case of straw man fallacy. The myst ē ria as a ‘type’, according to Sfemani Gasparro ( 1985 , p. 6), comprises two aspects ‘peculiar’ to it: ‘the ritual esoteric-initiatory component and the specifi c content, the latter viewed in the light of both the character of the divine being object of the cult and of the particular relationship which develops between deity and worshipper’. 3 See Henrichs 1981 ; Versnel 1990a , pp. 146–50; Burkert 1985 , pp. 237–42; Vernant and Vidal-Naquet 1988 , pp. 381–412; Parker 2005 , pp. 312–26. 4 ‘The Dionysiac cult, in the early form of the thiasoi described by Euripides, and the cult of Cybele do not imply the re-evocation of a divine vicissitude, but rather the participation of the adept in a rite which puts him, through sacred possession to which he yields submissively, in immediate relationship with the deity... The cap-acity to infuse sacred mania is in fact one of the specifi c prerogatives of the great Phrygian goddess... this theme, in its double signifi cance ( μανία benefi cial if pro-duced ritually and destructive “madness” which affl icts the guilty) defi nes the entire mythical vicissitude experienced by Attis, in its “Phrygian version”, and the ritual complex of the Galli’ (Sfemani Gasparro 1985 , pp. 14–16). 5 See Vernant and Vidal-Naquet 1988 , pp. 381–412 and Versnel 1990a , pp. 137–39. 6 See Sfemani Gasparro 1985 , pp. 10–11, pp. 20–23; Burkert 1983 , p. 264: ‘in Babylon, the kalu-priests were entrusted with the knowledge of how to make the tympanon in secret sacrifi cial ceremonies’. 7 See Bernab é 2007 , pp. 100–101. Only the initiate is entitled to know the secret knowledge, which, as it bears on the afterlife, guarantees a ‘blessed’ postmortem existence. Compare Burkert 1987 , pp. 3–11. The two defi nitions Burkert gives of the general character of the mystery cult are different. ‘Mysteries are a form of personal religion, depending on a private decision and aiming at some form of salvation through closeness to the divine’ (Burkert 1987 , p. 12). But he also gives another one, which seems too cerebral to me: ‘Mysteries were initiation of a vol-untary, personal, and secret character that aimed at a change of mind through experience of the sacred’ (Burkert 1987 , p. 11). Compare Sfemani Gasparro 1985 , pp. 24–25. 8 Not all the mysteries were primarily directed to ensuring a better afterlife. The ini-tiates of the Great Gods of Samothrace sought safety at sea. See Bianchi 1976 , pp. 1–15 and Burkert 1985 , pp. 281–85. The famous Orphic phrase from Plato, Phaedo 69c (‘many are the thyrsus-bearers, but few are the bacchoi ’) distinguishes between genuine and superfi cial dedication to the god. But this genuineness does not mean, and is not proven by, having an ecstatic experience per se. Rather, as the context shows, it is fulfi lled in initiation to the mysteries of the god and authenti-cated after death."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Initiation-based youth bands and sacrifi ce 295 9 ‘Presence of and immediate contact with the god are precisely the most specifi c fea-tures of the Bacchic orgia ... On these two points both orgia and [Eleusinian] mys-teries were equally different from normal cultic practice’ (Versnel 1990a , p. 154). 10 According to Eliade ( 1958 , p. 74), the three ‘innovations’ of the secret men’s soci-ety were ‘the primary role of secrecy, the cruelty of the initiatory ordeals’ and the replacement of the ‘Supreme Being’ by ‘a demiurgic God, or by the mythical Ancestor, or by a civilizing Hero’. 11 See Sfemani Gasparro 1985 , p. 13 n. 30. 12 See Versnel 1990a , pp. 105–18 and Burkert 1983 , pp. 274–93. ‘“Madness” is a dis-tinctive feature of bakcheia in its full sense, and those devoted to the Phrygian Mother become entheoi or theophoretoi , “carried by the divinity”, especially under the effect of certain kinds of music’ (Burkert 1987 , p. 112). Burkert cites a pas-sage from Proclus, head of the Academy in the fi fth century AD . ‘Eleusis had been destroyed some fi fty years before he was born... still, he knew the daughter of Nestorius, the Eleusinian hierophant, and admired her as a guardian of the most sacred tradition. Thus what he writes about mysteries should be taken seriously as containing authentic tradition. Proclus writes the following about the teletai : “They cause sympathy of the souls with the ritual [ dr ō mena ] in a way that is unin-telligible to us, and divine, so that some of the initiands are stricken with panic, being fi lled with divine awe; others assimilate themselves to the holy symbols, leave their own identity, become at home with the gods, and experience divine posses-sion”’ (Burkert 1987 , pp. 113–14). The (symbolic) presence of the god to whom one entrusts one’s life and afterlife must have been reassuring , even if initially over-whelming, a concrete proof that the god cares about one’s fate, etc. Nonetheless, Proclus’ philosophical interpretation of the ‘extraordinary experience’, like many a retrospective wistful account, must be to some extent an idealized picture. Compare Henrichs 1981 , pp. 144–45: ‘Greek ritual in general was traditionally action-oriented ( dr ō mena ), repetitive and stereotyped, externalized and unrefl ect-ing, or in other words, a studious re-enactment of an inherited response rather than a personal expression of inner feelings or religious sentiment. These charac-teristics of Greek ritual explain why the physiological and psychological condition of maenads in ritual action remains unknown. The true nature of their “telestic madness” is therefore a matter of speculation’. 13 See Versnel 1980 , pp. 112–21 and Bremmer 1982 . 14 See Bremmer 1983 , pp. 137–46. 15 Eliade ( 1958 , pp. 73–77), too, sees a ‘perfect continuity between puberty rites and rites for initiation into men’s secret societies’ (Eliade 1958 , p. 73). But he relates this continuity to their supposed common origin: the experience of the sacred. ‘What, in my view, is original and fundamental in the phenomenon of secret societies is the need for a fuller participation in the sacred, the desire to live as intensely as possible the sacrality peculiar to each of the two sexes’ (Eliade 1958 , p. 74). This is an unacceptable supposition. Since for Eliade the sacred is a universal explanatory reference, invoking it becomes a tautological explanation. Its psychologizing dir-ection (‘the desire to live, etc.’) makes it even more inscrutable. This is not to deny the connection of the M ä nnerbund -type initiation rite with supernatural powers or even with an ‘extraordinary experience’ of these powers. But to make this experi-ence the universal ground for, e.g. the existence of particularly cruel practices is not a demonstrable or arguable position. 16 See West 2007 , pp. 448–51. West also points to the Indo-European member of the predatory or marginal warrior bands, who often ‘consciously adopted a wolf-ish identity, clothing themselves in wolfskins and uttering terrifying howls. The Norse berserks are sometimes called ú lfe ð nar , “wolf-skinned”...

This fury is called lyssa , which is a derivative of lykos “wolf ”’ (West 2007 , p. 450). Compare Burkert 1983 , pp. 84–93. ‘The wolf metamorphosis, as described by Euanthes, can easily be seen as an initiation ritual, for stripping off one’s clothes and swimming across a lake are clearly rites of passage... Arcadian warriors carried the skins of wolves and bears instead of shields’ (Burkert 1983 , pp. 90–91). 17 See Graf 1993 , pp. 113–18. Compare Versnel 1990b , 48–49, pp. 53–58. 18 The controversy regarding the M ä nnerbund is to some extent artifi cial. De Jong ( 1995 , p. 7 n.9) writes: ‘The theories connected with the M ä nnerbund are almost completely disregarded among Iranianists, for the obvious reason that the textual basis for its existence... is slender, and that in many cases the reconstruction is based on ethnographic parallels in institutions from totally unrelated (contem-porary pre-industrialized) cultures, which are then “discovered” in the Avesta’. The ‘slenderness’ of the ‘textual basis’ (in the Avesta?) is a matter of interpret-ation: what counts as ‘evidence’ or even what may be allowed to count as ‘evi-dence’, e.g. in the light of reasonable assumptions, comparative material, nature and quantity of the texts, and one’s theoretical interest, among others. See Smith 1990 , pp. 36–53. The second part of De Jong’s assertion, however, is not correct. The ‘basis’ of the ‘discovery’ of the idea in the Avesta is in fact comparative Indo-European material (e.g. Dum é zil 1971 ; Puhvel 1987 ). Whether there are problems with these comparative ‘reconstructions’ is another issue. Further, I know of only one instance where the comparison is made with ‘institutions from totally unre-lated cultures’, and that is Lincoln 1981 . But even here, Lincoln’s thesis, right or wrong, is in no way dependent on the comparison with the ‘East African Cycles’. After referring to a number of studies, De Jong goes further and complains that ‘instead of being a rejected theorem, the concept is still widely applied’. It is hard to know what to make of this confi dent assertion since it cannot be due to the lit-erature he adduces. I cannot see how Versnel 1990b , ‘esp. 45–59’ (De Jong 1995 , p. 7 n.9) is a ‘critical evaluation of the concept in the context of Graeco-Roman antiquity’. These pages are concerned with the relation of myth and ritual in the light of the concept of initiation. Versnel 1980 and especially Bremmer 1982 pro-vide supporting evidence and arguments for the idea of an Indo-European trad-ition of initiatory-esoteric youth groups engaged in warlike activities. Boyce’s thesis that the Proto-Indo-Iranians formed a ‘classless society’ is based on lim-ited archaeological fi nds. Compare Mallory 1989 , pp. 182–85 and Kuz’mina 2007 , pp. 349–450. Besides, such a fundamental conclusion from archaeological data is, in general, methodologically unsound. In any case, the substance of the charac-terization, namely the absence of ‘a warrior or knightly class’, does not rule out the existence of initiation-based youth bands intermittently involved in, e.g. cattle-raiding. In fact, Boyce’s remarks ( 1987 , pp. 512–13) on the IIr. marya may be inter-preted in support of an IIr. tradition of youth bands, since one would naturally like to know who the IIr. marya was. We have enough Indic and Iranian material to ask the question sensibly. Not enough attention has been paid to the ‘unnatural’ idea that in the Avesta the adolescent male (fi fteen years old) represents the ideal human form. What may be the background to such an idea? That the marya used the club and the slingshot as weapons, and not the spear, or that he did (or could) not belong to the (non-existing) warrior ‘class’, does not preclude the idea of an initiatory tradition of youth bands. The association of the Maruts with a certain type of weapon in the literary record does not necessarily restrict the tradition behind the myth to Bronze Age, contra Boyce ( 1987 , pp. 513–14). See Heesterman 1962 . Myth is dynamic and adapts itself to social conditions and material culture. Shining metal eventually outshone the dull stone. Boyce’s appeal to the tightness of familial or tribal structure in order to exclude ‘separate initiation for “warrior” youths’ (Boyce 1987 , pp. 514–15) in the face of Indo-European (literary) traditions"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Initiation-based youth bands and sacrifi ce 297(see Bremmer 1982 , pp. 137–44) is not cogent. Whether the formation of cohort bands of adolescent males for a limited period (marked by a marginal and ‘savage’ existence) was ‘originally’ a part of tribal initiation is diffi cult to answer. ‘That sodalitates could be formed within a gens has been shown, just as sodalitates could also be selected from a local community, but it is highly improbable that gentiles who observed a cult as a gens, for that reason called their fellow- gentiles sodales ’ (Versnel 1980 , p. 112). Whatever the ‘origins’ of the masculine associations, ‘com-radery’ and kinship are different principles of grouping. Initiation is the arma-ture of the voluntary group. Finally, ‘wolfi sh’ existence was apparently part of the ethos or initiation process of the Indo-European youth band. The mairiia- is described in the Avesta as a ‘two-legged wolf ’. This must describe his ethos. See Boyce 1987 , p. 515. ‘The members of the f í an , the f é nnid , were regularly connected with wolfs and wild dogs, and this fi ts in well with the fact that among the Indo-Europeans strangers and boys who had to live away from civilised society were often called dog or wolf, or even dressed as such; this custom is found among the Irish, Germans, Greeks, Lithuanians, Hittites and Indo-Iranians’ (Bremmer 1982 , p. 141). Compare Gershenson 1991 , pp. 98–126. 19 See Ker é nyi 1951 , pp. 83–85. 20 See Sfemani Gasparro 1985 , p. 15 n. 37 and Burkert 1987 , p. 98. 21 See, for example, Eliade 1964 . 22 See Burkert 1985 , pp. 144–45 and Parker 2005 , pp. 50–78. 23 Among Indo-European peoples ‘many tribal and personal names are composed with the element “wolf ” (Lycii, Lycurgus etc.), and it is hard to attribute this only to the bearers’ having been criminals; it rather points to the time when they lived away from society during their initiation, or when they were performing heroic feats to prove their manhood’ (Bremmer 1982 , p. 141). See also West 2007 , p. 451. 24 See Burkert 1985 , p. 280. 25 See Vernant 1989 , p. 46: ‘their name evokes calcinated earth, the white ash or quicklime that Greeks call titanos without always clearly distinguishing it from gypsum, gupsos ’. 26 See below for an analysis of this topic. The implied likening of the sacrifi cial vic-tim to the murdered god, according to Parker ( 1983 , p. 299), served the Orphic requirement of vegetarianism within the frame of the belief in metempsychosis. Animal sacrifi ce would then simply be murder and cannibalism. If so, the function of initiation is to introduce a particular way of life ( bios ) that carries the initiate’s eschatological hopes. Initiation is thus subordinated to a comprehensive existential regime as in Pythagoreanism. Compare Burkert 1972 , pp. 166ff. 27 Dionysiac enthusiasm is in one respect an extreme form of dedication whereby the follower loses his or her ordinary identity, through violent dance or intoxication with wine (see Bremmer 1984 ), and is supposed to become one with the raging god. See Detienne 1979 , pp. 42–56 on Strabo’s ‘Namnetai women’ who are, isolated on their own island, ‘possessed by Dionysus and devoted to appeasing the god by rites’. Compare Henrichs 1981 , pp. 157–60 and Ker é nyi 1951 , p. 263. Maenadism could well have had ritual reality, even if this had the nature of an act getting out of hand. ‘Dionysiac ritual by its very nature threatens – or is at least expected – to go off the rails now and then’ (Versnel 1990a , p. 143). ‘In the case of maenadism, myth and ritual are even more than usually inseparable: maenadic myth mirrors maenadic ritual, while ritual practice mollifi es the mythical model. Unfortunately maenadic myth is infi nitely better known than actual maenadic ritual’ (Henrichs 1981 , p. 143). In the doctrine, madness becomes an object of therapy, presided over by the god who suffered from madness himself and was cured by the ecstatic cult of the Phrygian Meter. See Graf and Johnston 2007 , pp. 146–47 and Burkert 1985 , pp. 164–65.

This is where the rhythm of sacrifi ce comes from’. See also Burkert 1983 , pp. 296–97. 30 ‘In the situation of killing, man feels guilty, and he has to overcome this reluctance by means of a complicated ritual pattern, which Meuli pertinently calls “comedy of innocence” (“Unschuldskom ö die”), though we must not forget that this “com-edy” has a very serious basis. At the center of the sacrifi ce stands neither the gift to the gods nor fellowship with them, but the killing of the animal, and man as its killer’ (Burkert 1966 , p. 106). 31 But see Leroi-Gourhan 1983 , esp. pp. 25–36, pp. 66–78. 32 Vernant ( 1981 , pp. 24–25) rejects the argument apropos Bouphonia: ‘Si on remet sur pied le b œ uf des Bouphonies, ce n’est pas pour assurer la permanence et la reproduction de l’esp è ce, mais pour effacer symboliquement sa mise à mort et pour fi xer l’animal dans le nouveau statut qui est d é sormais le sien: non plus man-geur de c é r é ales, à la fa ç on des hommes, mais tirant l’araire pour faire germer le froment’. 33 Compare Kirk 1981 , pp. 70–72. 34 Heesterman’s distinction of ritual and sacrifi ce is illuminating for the Br ā hman \u0004 ic doctrine of sacrifi ce and convincing as the analytic frame for an evolutionary his-tory of Vedic rituals. I am sceptical, however, about the possibilities of generaliz-ing, e.g. the notion of sacrifi ce he proposes, that rather than resolving the tensions of man’s social existence ‘sacrifi ce raises tension to an abnormally high pitch’ (Heesterman 1993 , p. 26). And the ultimate horizon of man’s mortal condition is the confl ict of life and death. ‘Sacrifi ce is not a safe outlet for pent-up aggression and competition that is redirected at a scapegoat victim... By offering an arena apart from normal life sacrifi ce calls forth and intensifi es competition and confl ict. It must do so in order to disentangle and play out the riddle of life and death in ever-recurring rounds of an ambiguous qui perd, gagne . And it can do so, because it is a game subject to its own rules, at one remove from everyday life’ (Heesterman 1993 , p. 44). That Heesterman means his ‘sacrifi ce as contest’ to be accepted as a general concept is clear from the fact that he applies it to the renewal type sacri-fi ces: ‘Even when sacrifi ce is seen to celebrate and renew the primordial cosmo-gonic event, this event is always the violent breakup of a previous monolithic and static order’ (Heesterman 1993 , p. 28). This rendition of, say, the Babylonian New Year ak ī tu is wrong-headed. The point was not to express the philosophical idea that all order is transitory, etc. but rather to celebrate (and consolidate) the current ‘legitimate’ social and cosmic order.

Graf (in Graf and Johnston 2007 , 163–64) leaves the question of the reality of ‘Orphic communities’ open. 49 Compare Burkert 1985 , p. 65. 50 ‘In his Krete Euripides offers a chorus of Kretan mystai (“initiates”) who have become mystai of Idaian Zeus and herdsmen of “night-wandering Zagreus, cele-brating the feasts of raw fl esh,” so that, holding up torches for the mountain mother, they acquire the title of Bakchos... this and the rest of the context may suggest some fusion with Dionysos’ (Gantz 1993 , p. 118). Compare Vernant 1990 , p. 102: ‘the Greek Zeus is not only an Indo-European god; he has come into con-tact with other male deities, in particular a Cretan cave god with whom he merged. This Cretan god differs in many respects from the Indo-European Zeus: he is a child god, Zeus kouros ; he is also a god who dies and is reborn. His tomb used to be pointed out in Crete’. See my discussion of the ‘sacrifi cial double’ below. 51 See Eliade 1964 , pp. 110–45 and Hubert and Mauss 1964 , pp. 50–52. 52 Compare Hubert and Mauss 1964 , pp. 98–99: ‘If he [i.e. the sacrifi cer] involved himself in the rite to the very end, he would fi nd death, not life. The victim takes his place. It alone penetrates into the perilous domain of sacrifi ce, it dies there, and indeed it is there in order to die. The sacrifi er [i.e. sacrifi cer] remains protected: the gods take the victim instead of him... There is no sacrifi ce into which some idea of redemption does not enter’. 53 See Parker 2005 , pp. 275–83. 54 See Clinton 2005 . Iphigeneia, writes Henrichs ( 1981 , pp. 207–208), ‘herself a virgin like Artemis and occasionally Artemis’ duplicate in cult, plays an equally ambigu-ous role: a would-be victim of human sacrifi ce, she slaughters human victims among the Taurians in another... Artemis personifi es the natural supply of young life and the dangers which threaten its survival. The myth of Iphigeneia, and the ritual mechanism refl ected in it, articulate this ambiguity, and create the impres-sion of catastrophe survived. Animal substitution was the chief ritual means by which the Greeks created this cultic illusion of death without actual loss of human life, an illusion which reinforced man’s most vital instinct, that of survival’. The ‘ritual mechanism’ settles ‘a divine claim to a human life’ ‘without actual loss of human life’ (Henrichs 1981 , p. 205). But why are the gods owed in human life, not in the context of a mortal crisis to the survival of community as such? The Arcadian or the Attic version of the Iphigeneia myth is transparently initiatory."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"300 Initiation-based youth bands and sacrifi ceSee Henrichs 1981 , pp. 198–204. Moreover, in this perspective, a crucial feature of the myth remains obscure. ‘I must admit,’ says Henrichs ( 1981 , p. 238), ‘that I fail to understand the Greek mind when it comes to her [Iphigeneia’s] paradoxical role as both sacrifi cial victim and sacrifi cer’. See also Parker 2005 , p. 239: ‘the goddess sought or seemed to seek the life of a virgin in exchange for that of the animal; but... a further animal was substituted for the girl. The little bears [i.e. the girls consecrated to Artemis for a period and who served at her temples in Brauron and Mounichia] thus “imitate” the original or, in “Iphigeneia”, the substituted animal; but they also surely, in a different sense, imitate the original girl whose life was owed to the goddess’. 55 Versnel ( 1993 , pp. 79–88) suggests that what lies at the background of the two myth-and-ritual complexes of reversal festivals (i.e. New Year rites) and initiation is the traumatic experience of critical transitions: ‘the most elementary and primor-dial scheme of (originally bio-sociological) functions has been conserved and trans-formed, in ritualized and mythicized form, at precisely those points where human society experiences primal crisis most intensely. Apart from incidental calamities like epidemics, wars, earthquakes and fl oods, these are precisely the critical and painful moments of transition that are experienced nowhere more keenly than dur-ing initiatory periods and at the turning points of the agricultural or social year’ (Versnel 1993 , pp. 83–84). Death has to be added to the list of critical transitions. 56 ‘There is a curious ambivalence in thyesthai which is already Indo-European: the same expression means “to sacrifi ce on one’s own behalf ” and “to be sacrifi ced”. Sacrifi cer and victim are so correlated as to be nearly identifi ed’ (Burkert 1966 , p. 112). Compare Vernant 2006 , pp. 321–32. See also Versnel 1981 . For Versnel, the general principle of sacrifi ce is ‘compensation’: the ‘compulsory feeling’ (Versnel 1981 , p. 185) that something must be given up as ransom for the life one has and wants continued or for the life one wants to have and feels can purchase it (Versnel 1981 , pp. 163ff.). When the sheer survival of the community is under threat, it feels it has to pay the highest price, namely in human life, according to the logic of unus pro omnibus . Be it ‘ debt or guilt , man always pays ’ (Versnel 1981 , p. 177). But the dear purchase may be avoided by animal substitution: he ‘may give up an animal or something valuable in order to buy salvation’ (Versnel 1981 , p. 167). In myth, normally the human victim does not die, but is saved by a substitution, or does not die as a human, having taken animal form (e.g. Kallisto). However, death in initiation myths and rituals does not have the sense of destruction but that of a passage. The initiate of the mysteries expected to die a hero’s death, i.e. to a blessed afterlife. The animal victim here is not only the substitute for the donor. 57 See Burkert 1987 , pp. 21–22. 58 See Burkert 1985 , pp. 287–88; Sourvinou-Inwood 2003 ; Parker 2005 , pp. 352ff. 59 In Roman religious lore the consecratio of a human (the sacer ) is always to the gods of the underworld, whatever the means of death, e.g. enemy troops. The same is true of self-sacrifi ce in an act of devotio , such as throwing oneself from the rocks into the sea, which warranted ‘heroization’. See Versnel 1981 , pp. 148–58. 60 According to Sourvinou-Inwood ( 2003 , p. 33), ‘the Telesterion is the mysteric cor-relative of the holy meadows’, where the psych ē aspires to go in the afterlife. 61 In Homer and other early Greek sources the funeral ceremony is understood as the rite of passage for the dead into an afterlife. See Bremmer 1983 , p. 73, p. 88. 6 2 ‘ Hagnon are rites and festivals, temple, temenos and sacred grove, but also fi re, light, and especially the inviolate state required when dealing with the gods, the absence of sexuality, blood, and death; this is called hagneia ’. The ‘ hagnai theai as such are Demeter and Persephone’, although in myth and ritual they are in char-acteristic contact with death and sexuality (Burkert 1985 , p. 271). The hagnai theai cannot be sullied. 63 Compare Versnel 1981 , pp. 156–63, on the Roman notion of sacer ."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"Initiation-based youth bands and sacrifi ce 301 64 See L é vi 1898 , pp. 90–100. 65 The three ‘funeral hymns’ (RV 10.14–16) are among the R \u0003 gvedic texts that are closer than the ‘older’ books of the R \u0003 gveda in language and religious ideas to the Atharvaveda, the Br ā hman \u0004 as. Atharvavedic, just as the later Classical and Epic Sanskrit, could have derived, according to Parpola ( 2002 , pp. 60–66), from the ‘archaic Old Indo-Aryan dialect encountered by the immigrating Pūru and Bharata tribes in the Panjab’ from whose midst comes the bulk of the ‘older’ texts of the R \u0003 gveda. ‘Linguistically the 10 th book provides the clearest evidence of the dialect mixing that took place after the Pūru-Bharata tribes had settled in the Panjab and had been subjected to the substratum infl uence of the language of its previous inhabitants’ (Parpola 2002 , p. 61), i.e. apparently the earliest Indo-Aryan immigrants, who settled in the Panjab even before the fi rst wave of R \u0003 gvedic Indo-Aryans, the Yadu-Turva ś a tribes. Parpola ( 2002 , pp. 54–61) connects the K ā n \u0004 va hymns, mostly from book 8, with the latter.

The PIE fi gure *Yemo must have been, accord-ing to Lincoln ( 1981 , pp. 239ff.), both the fi rst mortal and the king of the dead, whose death was sacrifi cial.

See Hubert and Mauss 1964 , p. 66 n.385. The Getae (Herodotus, Histories 4.94) dispatched a ‘messenger’ to Zalmoxis once every fi ve years to bear their demands to the god. 74 Kuiper ( 1964 , pp. 107ff.) argues that the underworld enclosure of Yama and Varun \u0004 a, e.g. harmy á - , revolves to become the celestial regions at night, where also the sun retires (RV 7.88) and the dead dwell. In RV 10.14.1 Yama’s way to the realm of the dead takes him to the ‘great lofty streams’ ( pravato mah ī r ); presumably the gate to the underworld is located on a mountain top. Iranian Yima offers sacrifi ce to the goddess An ā hit ā on the high peak of Mount Har ā , Hukairiia (Yt 5.25), whence heavenly waters stream into the ocean that circles the earth (Yt 5.3). 75 See Parpola 2002 , pp. 61–62; compare Caillat 1997 and Witzel 1997 . 76 See L é vi 1898 , pp. 102–107 for references from the Br ā hman \u0004 as. Compare Eliade 1958 , pp. 53–57. Consecration of the sacrifi cer is also understood (the Atharvaveda XI 5.6) as a return to the fetal status. The completion of the procedure is like a ‘new birth’. According to the Maitrayani Sam \r hita III 6.1, the initiate leaves the world and ‘is born into the world of the Gods’. 77 See Renou 1968 . 78 See Heesterman 1993 , pp. 171–72. 79 See Gonda 1975 , pp. 328–29. 80 See Oldenberg 2004 , p. 44. 81 See Malamoud 2002 , pp. 32–33."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"302 Initiation-based youth bands and sacrifi ce 82 Compare Vernant’s observation on the ‘sentiment of debt’ in Greek and Vedic religions: ‘Notre vie est “d é pendante”.

The human victim, purus \u0004 a , before becoming, in the later Vedism, identifi ed with Praj ā pati, the god who creates the cosmos from his own substance, is the double of the sacrifi cer, who follows Yama, etc. Compare Malamoud 2002 , p. 118. 87 According to the A ︊ ś val ā yana Śrauta Sutra III.3.1, the head of the victim must be turned towards the west, the direction that the sun takes, that the dead fol-low, and by which the gods ascended to heaven. Compare Burkert 1985 , p. 152: ‘Behind maiden initiation, maiden sacrifi ce appears as a still deeper level. And just as Apollo is mirrored in Achilles, so Artemis is mirrored in Iphigeneia; Iphigeneia herself becomes a goddess, a second Artemis. In this way the very fi gure of the Virgin grows out of the sacrifi ce’. See also Burkert 1985 , p. 64. 88 Compare Kellens and Swennen 2005 .

"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":" 13 Eschatology The magi’s lore is likened to mystic initiation in Greek literature from the end of the sixth century onwards. We know that Xanthus had written on the magi, referred to as Magica in Clement of Alexandria, which was perhaps a part of his history of Lydia, Lydiaca . 1 Xanthus apparently knew of the magi’s millenarian scheme of history. The interest the Lydian Xanthus showed in the magi is understandable. More generally, one may assume a similar interest among the Greeks in Asia Minor from the second half of the sixth century BC onward. Under Persian domination, the opportunity to observe the magi and a vital interest in doing so formed the basis of the Ionians’ curiosity about the magi’s practices. It is true that, as has often been asserted, genuine ethnographic curiosity was limited among the Greeks and, generally speaking, cannot be assumed to underlie their ‘description’ of other cultures. But wrong conclusions have been drawn from this truism. It is simply inconsistent to allow for the Persian origins of Greek biographical writing in the fi fth century BC , as Momigliano does, 2 admit the Greek knowledge of Iranian religious ideas such as cosmological dualism and eschatology (see below), 3 and acknowledge Iranian dualistic ideas behind Plato’s images of the fate of the soul and his notion of eternal cosmological struggle in the Laws 896a, 906a, etc., but dismiss the classical Greek assimilation of the magi’s ritual lore to the mysteries as based in hostility and incomprehension. The similarities between the mysteries and the magi’s rite, as much as we may gather from Greek testimonies, went beyond their common nocturnal nature. 4 I have tried to show that the mysteries had defi nite characteristics for the Greeks. Already Heraclitus tells us that, despite their claim, the mysteries of Dionysus are deceitful in the eschatological promise they make: Dionysus, the supposed god who ‘releases’ is no other than Hades, the god of death. Characteristically, Heraclitus allows and in fact presses the relation between initiation to the mysteries and death, but reverses the received sense. The asso-ciation of the mysteries with a blessed afterlife is a constant theme of the hieroi logoi . 5 In the Republic , we saw, Plato says that among the purifi cation rites offered by the seers and mendicant holy men, the orpheotelestai , there were those that ensured the blissful existence of the initiate in the underworld. This ‘practical’ aspect of the teletai is implied in the obligation of secrecy"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"Eschatology 307attached to the initiation, not just in respect of the actual initiation process but also to some extent with regard to the logoi , i.e. myths and doctrines, which included, at least in some cases, instructions about the underworld. 6 What is considered useless hardly incites possessiveness. One way or another, the gods of the mysteries had a special affi nity with the dead and determined the fate of the psych ē in the underworld. They could ‘release’ the soul, or intercede on its behalf with the ruler of the dead. The climax of the mysteries of Demeter was the ‘appearance’ of Kore for the initiate and, in the myth, the Mother Goddess ( Hymn to Demeter 380ff.), who had to ‘be consoled’. Eleusinian Demeter was a chthonic goddess. ‘The Athenians called the dead Demetreioi and sowed corn on graves’ (Burkert 1985 , p. 161). If the identifi ca-tion of the initiate’s sacrifi cial double with Kore is right, the Mother Goddess had to be appeased, on which the fate of the soul depended just as much as the condition of life on earth. Demeter is not just the bringer of grain but also the mysteries with their promise of a blissful existence beyond death: ‘Blessed is he of men on earth who has beheld them, whereas he that is uninitiated in the rites, or he that has had no part in them, never enjoys a similar lot down in the musty dark when he is dead’ ( Hymn to Demeter 480ff.). Perhaps even in the mysteries of Demeter, initiation had an expiatory dimension. Sacrifi cial death was not just the condition for the psych ē attaining a blissful state, but also, insofar as it was infl icted on the maiden, a crime that required justifi ca-tion. 7 Here again, the god who dies is also the god who pronounces judgement on the dead. The synthema expressing the preparations for initiation to the mysteries of Eleusis contained the declaration: ‘I fasted, I drank the kykeon ’, a barley soup. The cleansing of the body from impurities is the condition of access to the sacred. In effect, the initiate declares that he is ‘consecrated’ in the exact sense that a sacrifi cial victim is. 8 But the sacrifi cial death is also understood to be a divinization. The myth says that while searching for her daughter, Demeter went to the court of Celeus, the Eleusinian king, disguised as a nurse, and took charge of the king’s sons. Every night she placed Demophon, one of the sons, in the hearth’s fi re in order to make him immortal. One night, the mother discovered the child in the hearth and screamed in horror. The god-dess had to abandon the project. Instead, she taught Triptolemus the art of agriculture and the mysteries. 9 ‘Unlike the vitality of the gods, which is pure of all negative elements, theirs is precarious, unstable, fl eeting, and doomed to death from the outset. The very term bios , which Hesiod employs to indicate the ear of grain men use as their particular food, underscores a relationship between grains and the vitality peculiar to men, a relationship so intimate that we must speak of consubstantiality. The fabric of human life is cut from the same material that forms the food that sustains it. It is “because they do not eat bread” that the gods are not mortals. Not knowing wheat, fed on ambro-sia, they have no blood’ (Vernant 1989 , pp. 36–37). If the connection between the ‘gifts’ of the grain and the mysteries is not fortuitous but is meant to defi ne the essence of human life, the concern with the postmortem condition"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"308 Eschatologyin the mysteries must be basic. The human ‘victim’ is supposed to be made immortal by fi re, just as Heracles ‘purifi ed’ himself on the pyre of Mount Oeta and turned into a god, and Empedocles sought apotheosis by throwing himself into Etna. 10 Death by fi re is the ultimate purifi cation, making possible a god-like existence. 11 Both the rite and the myth point to the same thing: ini-tiation to the mysteries is sacrifi cial death and thereby ‘purifi cation’. 12 This general, perhaps composite, picture must be close to what Greek observers had in mind when they wrote on the mysteries. We have, on the other hand, the consistent association of the magi, or religious views safely attributable to them, with the so-called ‘charismatic seers and initiators’ such as Orpheus, Empedocles, Pythagoras and others, some of whose ranks were certainly involved in the production of Orphic literature. The Platonic image of the postmortem ascent of the soul to heaven shows the infl uence of the Iranian view of the matter, probably by way of Pythagorean ideas. The ground for this infl uence must have been laid in the parallel eschatological ideologies behind the mystery cults and the magi’s nocturnal rite. We have accurate sketches of the magi’s eschatological doctrine in the extant Greek literature. It is unlikely that the magi established themselves in Mesopotamia and Anatolia prior to the mid sixth century BC . 13 Heraclitus’ magi could not have been yet infl uenced by Mesopotamian astral religion. 14 Since the magi did not have any dogma or doctrinal orthodoxy, 15 their ritual traditions would have presumably endured through the changes in their theological or cosmological views. Cult forms and elements are resilient and assume new meanings if need be, unless destroyed by zealots familiar from the history of Christianity and Islam. Nor could there have been a question of a system-atic confusion on the part of Greek observers between the Chaldean and the magi – not even much later (cf. Diogenes Laertius, Lives 1.6). Vehement post-Hellenistic protests against traditions that connected Greek institutions with non-Greek cultures show the liveliness of the topic. 16 I have tried to show that the best way to account for the association of the magi’s nocturnal rite with the mysteries is to view them within their common eschatological horizon. The literate magician who insisted on the connection of his profession with the mysteries called himself after the magos . It is certainly noteworthy that in archaic and republican Rome one fi nds no fi gure comparable to ‘the itinerant specialist who practices divination, initiation, healing, and magic’ (Graf 1997 , p. 49). This points to the mystic roots of the magician and, along with other converging evidence, makes the etymology of ‘magic’ signifi cant. For classical Greeks, the mageia claims knowledge of the invisible and involves initiation, both bearing on the fate of the soul. Secrecy, direct contact with the divine and ritual initiation – these are the three features that Graf believes are com-mon to the mysteries and ‘magic’. 17 Diogenes Laertius ( Lives 1.8) conveys two observations that are important. The fi rst remark, made by Aristotle in a book called Magicus and by Dinon in his History , is that the magi were ‘wholly unacquainted’ with ‘the art of magic ( t ē n go ē tik ē n mageian )’. The work attributed to Aristotle is in fact a dialogue"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"Eschatology 309by an unknown Hellenistic writer. 18 The clarifi cation shows that competent observers knew that, despite outward similarities between the practices of the magus and the ‘magician’, which were important enough to warrant der-ivation of the latter’s name from the former, the magus’ rites pursued differ-ent aims or at least were not limited to those of the magician. In the First Alcibiades 122a, the ‘ mageia of Zoroaster’ is defi ned as theon therapeia ‘the worship of the gods’. 19 Both are signifi cant: the possibility of confusion in the mind of the superfi cial observer between the magi’s and the magician’s rites and the distinction drawn between them. 20 The similarities, as I have argued above, must have been those that were also shared by the mysteries: initiation, claims of personal contact (and, especially, a covenant) with a powerful god, nocturnal celebration, immolation of a victim. But on what grounds could the distinction be made? The magi were priests: they worshipped the gods. 21 Their religious status was in part based on the claim, already found in Herodotus, that the gods listened only to their words. They mediated between men and the gods, making the former’s requests heard by the latter. The belief in the exclusive effi cacy of their incantation is also found in Diogenes Laertius, Lives 1.6. The similarities mentioned above must have been framed by the magi’s claim of the effi cacy of their ‘secret rites’. 22 One can imagine that the mageia were thought to be effective in more than one domain. But a specifi c theme defi ned the horizon of the magi’s rite and differentiated it from magic. The second observation found in Diogenes Laertius ( Lives 1.9) that is of interest to us is from the pen of the fourth-century BC historian Theopompus, who was apparently well informed about the religious views of the magi, 23 and that of the philosopher of the same century, Eudemus of Rhodes, a student of Aristotle: ‘according to the magi men will live in a future life and be immortal, and that the world will endure through their invocations’. Life in that future world will be permanent thanks to the incantation of the magi. The idea of a general resurrection in body of the dead at the end of times and an eternal life thereafter is an authentic Avestan conception (cf. Yt. 19.19, 23, 89–90). The testimony is remarkable since the idea is completely alien to the classical Greek mind. A more detailed picture of the eschatological doctrine is found in the Hellenistic Oracle of Hystaspes . 24 The ‘world’ of the second part of the observation from Diogenes Laertius, Lives 1.9, although diffi cult to interpret, 25 cannot mean the current world, both because this would reframe the focus without any indication, breaking the apparent continuity of the thought, and because the permanence of the current world is not a Zoroastrian idea. On the other hand, however, we do not fi nd any Iranian evidence for the idea that the resurrected world (in Pahlavi, tan i pas ē n ) will endure ‘without decay, liv-ing forever’, etc. thanks to the magi’s incantations. But in Ya š t 19.94 there is the following enigmatic statement about the power of Sao š yant’s gaze: ‘he will behold with the eyes of effi cacy ( xrat ə̄ u š )... he will look at the whole corporeal existence with the eyes of invigoration ( i ž aii å ), and will make indestructible the entire corporeal world with (his) look’. 26 The two words in the genitive are ritual terms, or at least have a regular ritual usage. 27 The idea that at the end"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"310 Eschatologyof time Sao š yant will render the resurrected creatures immortal (and some-times even resurrect them) by means of a rite is commonplace in the Pahlavi literature. 28 In the Iranian Bundahi š n 34.23 it is said 29 : yazi š n ī pad rist-wir ā y ī h S ō š yans ab ā g ay ā r ā n kun ē d. ud g ā w ī Haday ō š pad ā n yazi š n ku š end ud pih ī ā n g ā w ud h ō m ī sp ē d an ō š wir ā y ē nd ud ō harwisp mard ō m dah ē nd ud harwisp mard ō m a-h ō š baw ē nd t ā ham ē (w)-ud-ham ē (w)-rawi š n ī h ‘Sao š yant, along with his colleagues, performs a rite in order to resurrect the dead. They sac-rifi ce the cow Haday ō š for the rite, and from the fat of the cow and the white H ō m they prepare An ō š (a drink) and give to all the people, and everyone will become immortal for ever and ever’. The Pahlavi evidence encourages an inter-pretation of the Ya š t 19.94 passage along the same lines, already suggested by the occurrence of the two terms with ritual usage. If so, the second part of Theopompus’ and Eudemus’ observations reported in Diogenes Laertius, Lives 1.9 must mean: ‘and the world will become permanent by means of their incantations’. Thus we have two pre-Hellenistic Greek reports of the magi’s claim that their rite has a specifi cally eschatological effi cacy: at the end of time, their incantation will make the resurrected and purifi ed world immortal. Based on these and the assimilation of the magi’s ritual lore to the mysteries begin-ning from the end of the sixth century BC , it is possible to conclude that the classical Greek observer knew of a secret rite performed by the magi that had an eschatological function similar to that of the mysteries. 30 It had the form of initiation, involving sacrifi ce, effi cacious formulae and probably some form of ritual abandon, taking place at night and addressed to deities thought to have disposition over the passage of the soul to the beyond. They claimed that it was based on a sacred knowledge that they acquired directly from the gods. Just like the ‘divine man’, the magus had access to the world beyond. This is the picture that emerges from the ancient testimonies, in part based on the reasonable assumption, as I have tried to show, that the Greek assimila-tion of the magi’s nocturnal rite to the mysteries was motivated by signifi cant similarities. Whoever knows Heraclitus’ way of dealing with received ideas will agree that his fragments on the mysteries are evidence for the approach taken here. One cannot ignore the collocation of the magoi with the adepts of the mysteries in Heraclitus or the eschatological frame (‘Dionysus is Hades’) of his condemnation of them all as ‘unholy practices’. I argued that it is not pos-sible to dismiss the assimilation on the grounds that Heraclitus’ magoi do not have any connection with Zoroastrianism and the Persian priesthood. Egypt became (e.g. in Herodotus Histories 2.123 and 171) the provenance of the mys-teries because the Greeks saw in the nocturnal worship of Osiris and Isis, in the lamentations that accompanied it, and most of all, in the myth thought to be behind the rite, a mystery cult. In Herodotus’ interpretatio Graeca Osiris and Isis are Dionysus and Demeter. The appropriation thus had an authentic basis. 31 Herodotus’ Greek informants (Herodotus, Histories 4.94–95) associ-ated the fi gure of Zalmoxis with Pythagoras in the context of Orphic and mys-tic themes. 32 The confusion over the double personality of Zalmoxis, both the shamanistic traveller to the underworld, 33 a go ē s , and the god who presides"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"Eschatology 311over the fate of the soul after death, is understandable in the light of the fi gure of Yama. The reported rite of dispatching a ‘messenger’ to the god Zalmoxis shows that, for the Getae, the soul continues to exist beyond death. There may have been a special rite of initiation dedicated to Zalmoxis that ensured the soul’s successful passage to the underworld. The idea of immortality of the soul and the belief in a Yama-type god that decides its fate after death seem to have been the basis of associating Zalmoxis with Pythagoras. Neither in the cult of Osiris nor in the fi gure of Zalmoxis is the comparison with a Greek phe-nomenon arbitrary. Why should one assume that the likening of the magi’s noc-turnal rite to the mysteries had no basis in reality? Direct and indirect evidence shows that the Greeks were familiar with genuine Iranian eschatological lore. Notes 1 See Kingsley 1995b , pp. 183–85. 2 See Kingsley 1995b , pp. 186ff. Xanthus wrote on Empedocles. 3 Compare Vasunia 2007 , p. 242. 4 Of course, I am not suggesting that there was only one type of ritual offered by the magi or that the magi formed a church with doctrinal uniformity. The rites they performed at night struck the Greeks, who perceived behind them an ideol-ogy similar to that of the mysteries. As I argued, nocturnal rites were anomalous among Indo-European peoples. 5 See Henrichs 2003 ; Graf and Johnston 2007 , pp. 75–84. 6 See Graf and Johnston 2007 , p. 182: ‘eschatologically-oriented hieroi logoi (includ-ing those called Katabasis and The Lyre ), probably included specifi c instructions about where to go and what to do in the Underworld – some of which we now fi nd embedded in some of our [gold] tablets’. 7 Compare Burkert 1983 , pp. 136–43 on the fi rst-fruit festival of Bouphonia. 8 Each of the participants at a typical Greek sacrifi ce took a handful of barley groats from the sacrifi cial basket and, following the sacrifi cer’s invocations, threw them onto the altar and the animal as part of the consecration. According to Pausanias ( Periegesis 1.38.6), the same procedure of ‘anointing’ with barley was followed for the sacrifi ce at Eleusis. Compare Burkert 1966 , pp. 107–108: ‘all participants throw the oulai [barley groats] “forward” at the victim and the altar. Throwing together at a common object is the primeval gesture of aggression’. 9 See Ker é nyi 1951 , pp. 241–45. Was the goddess making the child immortal in life, i.e. removing death as the condition of immortality? She is forced to give up the ambition, and instead gives mortals the grain and the mysteries. These gifts fun-damentally defi ne the human condition: a creature beset by suffering and death in search of a blissful immortal existence. 10 See Kingsley 1995a , pp. 278–88. 11 Sacrifi cial fi re, one of the manifestations of Agni, mediates between the gods and mortals in the R \u0003 gveda (e.g. 1.26.9), and with Soma in the source of inspiration for the poet. See Oldenberg 2004 , pp. 61–74. In Greek sacrifi ce, fi re purifi es the portion offered to the gods and thus makes it fi t, and connects earth to heaven. The funerary pyre ( Iliad 23.71, 75–76) makes the perishable body disappear and thus allows the psych ē of the dead to make the passage to the invisible world. See Detienne 1963 , pp. 98ff. 12 Iconography attests to the idea of initiation as rebirth to a new state. One of the scenes from the initiation frieze shows the veiled initiand sitting on a stool covered with a fl eece. See Burkert 1987 . The fetal posture and darkness signify gestation."},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"312 EschatologyAlso, as we say, the initiate is ‘raised from the purifi cation’ by the purifi er and asked to say ‘I have escaped the bad, I have found the better’ (Demosthenes, Discourses 18.259–60). 13 See West 1971 , pp. 240–42. 14 For the later period, Beck ( 1991 , pp. 524–25) is convincing in his argument that the astrological lore found in the Zoroastrian pseudepigrapha is a common phe-nomenon of Hellenistic wisdom and cannot be used to link the corpora to the Hellenized magi (so-called Magusaeans) as Bidez and Cumont maintain. 15 See Bidez and Cumont 1973 , pp. 73–78. 16 Diogenes Laertius ( Lives 1.2–5) attacks authors who make the magi, Egyptian priests and Gymnosophists the source of the (presumably Greek) ‘achievements’, among which he mentions ‘philosophy’. But the fi gures he mentions to prove that philosophy originated in Greece are Orphic poet-heroes Musaeus and Linus. The former is said to be the ancestor of the Eleusinian hierophants, the Eumolpidae, or related to them in any case, by way of his eponymous father Eumolpus, and to have composed a theogony. Diogenes’ dismissal of Orpheus as a possible source for Greek philosophy, about ‘whose antiquity there can be no doubt’ and who thus may be suspected, shows what kind of ‘philosophy’ he has in mind. Incidentally, Plutarch ( De exilio 607b) and Pausanias ( Periegesis 1.38.3) thought that Eumolpus was from Thrace. 17 See Graf 1997 , pp. 99–117. 18 See Graf 1997 , p. 29. 19 The other element of the mageia is ‘the royal things’ ( ta basilika ). Compare Papatheophanes 1985 . 20 Writing in the fi rst century BC, Cicero had to clarify that the magi were the offi cial priests of Persia, a body of ‘wise men and scholars among the Persians’ (Cicero, De Divinatione I 46.91), and had nothing to do with ‘magic’, which he seems to equate more or less with the binding spell. They interpreted dreams and initiated the kings into their art. See Graf 1997 , pp. 58–59. This picture of the Persian priest goes back to Herodotus, and is found in Plato too, who also mentions in Republic 572e the magi’s role in the succession story of Darius. 21 See Dio Chrysostom ( Oratio 36.41): the Persians call ‘magi ( magous )’ those ‘who know how to cultivate the divine power, not like the Greeks, who in their ignorance use the term to denote wizards ( go ē tas )’. 22 Dio Chrysostom ( Discourses 36.39–60), the orator and philosopher of the fi rst cen-tury, recounts the content of two hymns that he says were recited by the magi in their ‘secret rites’ (39: en aporr ē tois teletais , 56: en arr ē tois teletais ). I do not think that these two hymns necessarily belong to the mysteries of Mithras, as Bidez and Cumont ( 1973 , vol. 1, p. 98) maintain. They are certainly syncretistic, perhaps funda-mentally Stoic. The Zoroaster of the fi rst hymn ( Discourses 36.40–41) fully conforms to the Greek type of the charismatic thaumaturge . See Beck 1991 , pp. 539–48. 23 See De Jong 1997 , pp. 222–25; Horky 2009 , pp. 79–93; and my discussion of Plutarch, De Iside 46–7 in Chapter 7 . 24 See Boyce and Grenet 1991 , pp. 376–81. The description of the last events and the fi nal judgement is undoubtedly authentic and ancient, allowances made for the expected differences in presentation of the theme due to the context. The Sibylline doctrine of the wickedness of the fi nal age, however, as Boyce and Grenet ( 1991 , pp. 380–87) argue, is Hellenistic. Prophecies of coming doom were ‘the hallmark of the Sibylline oracles themselves’ (Boyce and Grenet 1991 , p. 381), whether Persian, Hebrew or Babylonian. 25 See De Jong 1997 , p. 225. 26 Compare Humbach and Ichaporia 1998 , p. 168. 27 For i ž ā - see Narten 1986 , p. 290 n.12; Kellens and Pirart 1990 , p. 224; Hintze 2007 , pp. 211–14."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"Eschatology 313 28 See Mol é 1963 , pp. 86–100 for some references. 29 See Pakzad 2005 , p. 384. 30 The interesting text of the third-century philosopher Porphyry’s De antro nym-pharum 5–6 (in Bidez and Cumont 1973 , vol. 2, p. 29) makes Zoroaster the foun-der of the mysteries of Mithra. Porphyry gives a Neoplatonic interpretation of the mysteries: the initiation, which takes place in a cave, signifi es the descent of the soul to the sublunary regions, and its return. This text has been the object of much controversy in Mithraic studies. Turcan ( 1975 ) and Merkelbach ( 1984 , pp. 301ff.) argue that the picture given by Porphyry is thoroughly Neoplatonist and hence unreliable as a description of the doctrine behind Mithras mysteries. Still, there is no reason to suppose simple fabrication on Porphyry’s part. The process of initiation is intimately related to the career of the soul. I argued above that the postmortem condition of the psych ē was the main concern of mystic initiation, which duly enacts the fate of the psych ē . Porphyry interprets this in Neoplatonic terms. Whether the mysteries of Mithras actually conformed to the supposed doc-trine is perhaps impossible to say. Compare Burkert 1987 , p. 27. Nonetheless, seen in the perspective suggested here, Porphyry’s text need not be taken as baseless. The mysteries apparently had a certain general sense for Porphyry, and the cult of Mithras, insofar as it was a mystery cult, had to conform to that sense. The mys-teries of Mithras in any event had an eschatological dimension. See Turcan 1981 . For Porphyry, Zoroaster is signifi cantly a founder of the mysteries. 31 Beck’s remark ( 1991 , p. 508) that the ‘most powerful factor that militated against the transmission of authentic data... was the reluctance of the Greeks themselves to listen to the original voices of those alien cultures’ is too general a statement to have a chance of refl ecting the realities of individual cases. If one were to judge the case of the Greek comparison of the magi’s ritual lore with the mysteries, one would do well to ask why Zoroaster was seen behind Plato’s Er, whose visit to the underworld was recounted by ‘Zoroaster’ himself in the Hellenistic On Nature . This tradition goes back to the third century BC . See Beck 1991 , pp. 528–39. Even Porphyry, ‘one of antiquity’s few literary sceptics’ (Beck 1991 , p. 529), a pupil of Plotinus, the ‘one honorable exception’ in the universal credulity of the Imperial period vis- à -vis Zoroastrian pseudepigrapha (Beck 1991 , p. 511), has Pythagoras ‘“listen to the discourse (sc. of Zaratos = Zoroaster) about nature ( ton peri physe ō s logon )”, a good indication that he both knew On Nature and... accepted it as genuinely Zoroaster’s’ (Beck 1991 , p. 529). Beck fi nds this acceptance sur-prising. But there is nothing surprising in it. In On the Cave of the Nymphs 6, Porphyry makes Zoroaster the founder of the mysteries of Mithras, in which the ‘Persian mystagogues initiate their candidate by explaining to him the downward journey of souls and their subsequent return, and they call the place where this occurs a “cave”’ (translation from Lamberton 1983 , p. 25). Plato’s cave metaphor in the Republic , according to Porphyry ( De antro Nympharum 7–8), comes from the mysteries. 32 See Burkert 1972 , pp. 155–65. Pythagoras, according to Burkert ( 1972 , p. 165), ‘is the hierophant of Great Mother mysteries with an Anatolian stamp, and has a new doctrine, probably infl uenced by Indo-Iranian sources, of immortality and of the triumph over death through successive rebirths’. 33 Compare Versnel 1993 , p. 72 n.147.

"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":" Conclusion The convergence between the Greek testimonies about the magi’s lore and what can be learned from the G ā th ā s about the cult of the da ē vas shows that eschatology was a characteristic feature of Iranian religious thought. The concern with the fate of the soul among the Greeks during the classical period and even before is beyond doubt. New institutions and notions evolved or were adopted and adapted to address this concern; these new social forms of experience in turn shaped eschatological expectations and images of the afterlife. The ‘individualism of the Mysteries ’, writes Parker ( 2005 , pp. 342–43), ‘refl ects their character as a preparation for another individual experience, death’. Even philosophy has been placed in the perspective of the concern with one’s postmortem fate. 1 A number of Hellenists, as we saw, have drawn attention to the Orphic background of Plato’s accounts of the afterlife, especially the Phaedo myth (107c–115a) and the myth of Er ( Republic 614a–621d). Plato ( Phaedrus 246a–249d) probably adopted the image of the winged soul ascending to the ‘pure’ regions beyond the heavens from Iranian thought, perhaps by way of Pythagorean traditions. 2 In the background of this reception stood the mysteries: the orpheotelestai were (or pretended to be) fundamentally concerned with the state of the psych ē after death. Initiation to the mysteries was meant, among other things, to ensure a blissful afterlife. But why should the institution that was especially charged with handling the individualistic concern with one’s afterlife have an esoteric-initiatory structure? The initiatory form of the mysteries may be related to initiation-based men’s associations dating back to Indo-European times. In my mind, the presence of cruel and eccentric conduct in some reports about mystic rituals and in a number of myths pertaining to the mysteries can best be understood in this perspective, rather than, say, as ‘reversal’ episodes that had the purpose of affi rming social norms. 3 If initiation was used to ensure the exclusivity of membership, its character could not have been a matter of indifference but must have refl ected the ethos of the members in exaggerated forms. Whether particularly eccentric acts were only fabled (mythic) or were (also) performed in some Greek rituals in earlier times is not important for the point made here. 4 Indo-European warrior bands devoted themselves in esoteric rituals to deities (e.g. Vayu 5 or O ð inn 6 ) that had strong connections"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"Conclusion 317with the world of the dead. It is quite possible that the mysteries reframed the role that the M ä nnerbund gods had played in secret warrior clubs and in some hero cults. 7 The warrior set himself apart from ordinary folks, both while alive and in the afterlife; a ‘heroic’ life and death, he hoped, ensured not only fame among the living but also a privileged state in the world beyond death, whereas the ordinary person should expect nothing but obscurity and shadowlike existence in the underworld. 8 The existence of the features that have been supposed for initiation-based masculine rites in the da ē va cult as it appears in the G ā th ā s inclines one to imagine the cult in commensurate settings. The G ā th ā s accuse the traditional priests, the karapans and kavis (‘seers’), of cruel treatment of the victim and of the use of intoxicants or stimulants in their rituals (Y 32.14 and 48.10). 9 If the prototype of the ‘great one’ ( maz- ) of Y 32.3 is indeed Yima, the lat-ter’s ‘wrongs’ too must have been related to taking part in the da ē va cult, which unquestionably had eschatological pretensions. We know from Young Avestan and Pahlavi accounts that the theme of immortality is basic in the Yima legends. 10 The sacrifi cial victim, the ‘cow’, in the G ā th ā s has an eschato-logical dimension, 11 perhaps similar to that of the victim in mystic initiation rites. In Y 44.20 the ‘cow’ is denied to the participants of the da ē va cult, who are accused of submitting it to (perceived) ritual cruelty, the a ē šə ma . In two parallel texts, Y 50.2 and 51.5, the ‘cow’ carries two qualifying phrases, r ā nii ō .sk ə r ə iti- and a š\u0004 ā t hac ā , respectively. The fi rst one means ‘making more joyful’ (* r ā niias-kr ̥ ti- ) and the second ‘ a š a -bound’, as one would say of a path. 12 Both adjectives have eschatological signifi cance. 13 The presence of the divine entity ‘Soul of the Cow’ ( g ə̄ u š uruuan- ) in the abode of the gods in Y 29 is conson-ant with the Br ā hman \u0004 ic doctrine of the sacrifi cial double, although it is not clear what the exact relationship is between the victim’s soul and the divine entity. 14 In the Young Avestan fragment Pursi š n ī h ā 33 the soul and perception of the sacrifi cial victim seem to be an emissary substitute for the sacrifi cer’s: gaosp ə n \u0004 ta gaohud å bao δ asca uruu ā n ə mca fra ē š ii ā mahi nazdi š ta upa θβ ar š ta raoc å nar š ca š man å sūk ə m ‘vitalizing cow, benevolent cow, we dispatch your perception and soul to the nearest fashioned lights, the light of vision of the man’s eyes’. 15 The victim must have had a comparable signifi cance in the da ē va cult. We know that the cult survived, and possibly thrived in some regions, in the face of the expanding Zoroastrianism, into the Achaemenid period and probably later. There may have been accommodations on both sides. It is thus almost certain that there were refl exes of the cult in historical evidence. It is in this perspective that one should consider the Greek evidence for the two ‘chthonic’ features of the magi’s rite: nocturnal celebration and wolf sacri-fi ce. 16 One may reasonably speculate that the esoteric cult dedicated to the da ē vas persisted to some extent in form and purpose while, under the impact of Zoroastrianism, the ‘gods’ themselves assumed a hostile status. In the G ā th ā s, their pretension to ‘have disposition’ ( ξ x š ā ) over the access to para-dise is deceitful. I recall my argument in Part III of this book that behind the magi’s daimones in the Derveni papyrus lurk the da ē vas which exercise control"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"318 Conclusionover (i.e. obstruct) the passage of the soul to the beyond. The magoi there are neither charlatans nor Greek beggar-priests but Iranian ritual experts. Scholars who deny the Iranian identity of the rite reported in the papyrus are yet to substantiate their claims in the face of the ostensible evidence. The assimilation of the magi’s rite to the mysteries cannot be divorced from Iranian eschatological ideology, which Greeks knew well in its general fea-tures. In the allegoristic account of the Derveni author we have a testimony where the homogeneous purposes of the magi’s rite and the mysteries are explicitly stated. In my mind, this has a momentous signifi cance. The ritual context of the relevant text is the passage of the soul. The magi’s incantation dislodges the ‘hindering daimones ’ from the path of the departing soul. The account found in the two fourth-century BC Greek observers Theopompus and Eudemus (in Diogenes Laertius, Lives 1.9) of the magi’s belief in an immor-tal future world and in the eschatological effi cacy of their rite (in bringing it about) is undoubtedly authentic. In the light of the Greek evidence we can describe the magi’s nocturnal rite in general terms: it had an initiatory pattern involving sacrifi ce; its purpose was to gain access to the beyond; to this end, it had to neutralize certain seemingly hostile supernatural beings (the dai-mones ) by means of special incantations, possibly accompanied by chthonic libations ( choai ), as in Plutarch and the Derveni author. Aeschylus ( Persians 620) has Atossa make libations ( choaisi ), followed by the chanting of ‘hymns’, when she wants to summon the daim ō n of Darius from the underworld. 17 There are Avestan parallels for these features reported in or inferred from Greek descriptions. The da ē va cult takes place at night and involves making ‘chthonic’ libations (V 7.79). The da ē vas seize the nocturnal offerings made by their worshippers even when intended for the Zoroastrian goddess Ardv ī Sur ā An ā hit ā (Yt 5.94–95). Is it because they occupy the space between the earth and where the gods reside, as the magi’s daimones do in the Derveni papyrus? According to Y 55, ritual recitation of the G ā th ā s and Staota Yesniia has the power to smash obstacles and protect the soul separated from the body. The N ē rangest ā n attributes wolf sacrifi ce to the da ē va cult. There is one conceptual nexus in particular that makes apparent the eschato-logical valence of the da ē vas in the pre-G ā thic period. The nucleus of this nexus is the concept of da ē n ā . In the post-G ā thic traditions, the da ē n ā , where it does not simply mean religion, is either the allegorized divine entity repre-senting Zoroastrianism or the psychopompic vision-soul, having the shape of a female leading the soul ( urvan ) of the departed to paradise or hell. 18 Now, it is in the sense of psychopompic vision-soul that the word da ē n ā - is regularly used in the G ā th ā s. The association to which one belongs, a š\u0004 avan or drugvan \u0004 t , directly impacts by way of the da ē n ā on one’s postmortem fate. 19 The drugvant , too, has a ‘vision-soul’, which in his case ‘neglects’ ( mar ə dait ī ) the ‘true’ ( hai θ iia- ) action that constitutes the direct ‘path of boon’, and thus causes trepidation in his departed soul in the face of his fate in the other world (Y 51.13). One determines the destiny of one’s soul through the shape that one gives to the da ē n ā : ‘He who makes his thinking better or worse, (makes"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"Conclusion 319so) his da ē n ā , (also) through his action and word. (His da ē n ā ) follows his inclinations, wishes and choices’ (Y 48.4a–c′). The da ē n ā leads the soul either to the abode of the gods or to the da ē vas , that is to say, to the ‘house of druj ’. The teaching of the ‘seers’ ( karapan- ) of the da ē va cult will ‘eventually’ ( ap ə̄ m ə m ) place them in the drūj ō d ə m ā na- ‘house of druj ’ (Y 51.14). Opposed to the latter is the gar ō d ə m ā na- ‘house of welcome’, where the followers of Zarathu š tra receive their ‘recompense’ ( m ī ž da- ) from Mazd ā (Y 51.15). 20 Every time the da ē vas are denounced, directly or indirectly, the primary stake is the destiny of the soul. If the term da ē n ā came to mean religion tout court , this can only indicate the singular importance of eschatology in the religious thought whose earliest testimony is the G ā th ā s. 21 Eschatology is the terrain on which the poet opposes the cult of the da ē vas . On the other hand, nowhere do we fi nd the da ē vas associated with any cosmological activity. They have no pretension in this regard. This silence cannot have anything to do with the poet’s suppression of their cosmological claims, for, as we have seen, he has no diffi culty expressing their traditional eschatological role (e.g. Y 44.20). In the pre-G ā thic pantheon, the da ē vas must have been subordinate to Mazd ā , as Y 32.1 suggests. 22 Thus the G ā thic oppos-ition to them did not mean that a new religion (Mazdaism) was set against the old religion of the da ē vas . Apparently, Mazd ā was the supreme deity even for the practitioners of the da ē va cult. The poet naturally impugns the da ē vas and their cult in connection with their reputed function, in other words, in relation to what was perceived to be their sphere of activity. He tells his audience that these ‘gods’ cannot deliver the eschatological hopes that their mortal devotees place in them. This is the substance of their repudiation. I have suggested that their provenance must be sought in the initiatory and funerary rites of the Indo-Iranian warrior societies. 23 As far as the Indic side is concerned, I have referred to Heesterman’s interesting analysis of the episode of the ś rauta fi res (Heesterman 1993 , pp. 126–37). It has been suggested that the Vedic deva par excellence, In \u0004 dra, took over from the Indo-Iranian god of victory *Vr \u0005 traghna, the breaker of obstacles. 24 Although being ‘mobile’ in the sense Heesterman develops does not necessarily connect the devas especially with warrior bands, it can form a meaningful constituent of such a thesis. 25 But the question remains: whence the poet speaks? Archimedes is supposed to have said: ‘give me a place to stand on and I will move the world’. On which fi rm ground does the composer of the G ā th ā s stand in his claim that the da ē vas will have failed their devotees? This question can be analysed into two. First, what is the source of his knowledge? This question is not inviting psychological speculations, but is meant to direct us to examine the historical evidence already rehearsed in a particular light. And – the second question – what were the social circumstances of the poet’s denunciation? The social background one may assume for the poet’s repudiation of the da ē vas must remain to some extent a conjecture. Nonetheless, I think it is reasonable to imagine that the cult of the da ē vas had an elective affi nity with the M ä nnerbund -type circles, or even that it developed in such a milieu. 26 If"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"320 Conclusionthe connection with the esoteric initiation rite is accepted (see below), one can think that those on whose behalf the poet condemns ‘the da ē vas and the mortals’ did not benefi t from the supposed power ( x š a θ ra- ) manipulated in the rite. The exclusive nature of the rite must have been an important factor in the condemnation of the cult; or, more cautiously, the poet rejected the inher-ited division between ‘the mortals’ and others as decisive for eschatological outcomes. This rejection is refl ected in the poet’s denunciation of Yima’s ‘wrongs’, who, ‘wanting to please the mortals’, ‘failed our (people)’ (Y 32.8). I argued that, given the lexical and thematic nexus with the previous stanzas (notably Y 32.3), there can hardly be any doubt that ‘the mortals’ are no other than those who take part in the cult of the da ē vas . It is these men who bene-fi ted (or thought they benefi ted) from the ‘wrongs’ they committed in their rites devoted to the da ē vas . We must ask the question of who the mortals are that appear in the formula ‘the da ē vas and the mortals’. It is a signifi cant par-ameter for the question of the identity of the da ē vas ; and we have adequate textual evidence to answer it. The term ‘mortals’ used in the formula ‘the da ē vas and the mortals’ is certainly derogatory, but it cannot have a general reference. 27 The poet replaces the repudiated division with his own a š\u0004 avan vs. drugvan \u0004 t , the second of which he uses with respect to the worshippers of the da ē vas , whose actions, according to him, are inspired by druj (Y 32.3) and who will end up in the house of druj (Y 46.11). It is clear that the term drugvan \u0004 t can only be an imputation. The social reality behind the epithet is ‘the da ē vas and the mortals’, or more concretely, ‘the mortals’ who, seeking ‘immortality’ (Y 48.1), take part in the cult of the da ē vas , and are thereby involved in ‘ritual rage’ and ‘intoxication’ (Y 32.14 and 48.10). The hypothesis of an initiation-based masculine-society background for the cult plausibly accounts for the facts of our text. But there is more. There is an intimate connection, perhaps going back to the Indo-European past, between the realm of the dead and the gods that are associated with it, on the one hand, and the seer’s extraordinary knowledge, on the other. Simply put: the fi rst is the source of the second, probably in the frame of an initiatory-esoteric rite. We saw that Yama is not just the ‘god of the dead’ but also the ‘poet of the ancestors’. The r \u0005 s \u0004 is ‘seers’ are the fi rst to have followed the path opened by Yama, in whose accomplishment he manifested his ‘poetic force’. 28 Recall, too, the theme of katabasis in the Greek traditions about mantic fi gures such as Orpheus, Empedocles, Pythagoras, etc. The chthonic Zeus Trophonius at Labadaea was a source of incubatory divination that took the form of initiation. ‘On emergence from his incubatory consultation, the initiate was endowed with memory, the same gift of second sight as that of the poets and diviners... Like Tiresias and Amphiarus, he became one of the living among the dead’. 29 O ð in is both the ruler of the dead and, as his name makes plain, the giver of prophecy and poetry. The seer has a super-natural source that is associated with the realm of the dead. Zarathu š tra’s ‘choice’ of the ‘most vitalizing intuition’ as his source (Y 43.16) must be set against this background. 30 Scholars have observed the agonistic character of"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"Conclusion 321the verb ξ var ‘choose’ in the G ā th ā s. 31 In Y 43 the poet sings about, among other things, the primordial and fi nal events that he has ‘seen’ through the ‘vitalizing intuition’. Whereas the ‘insightful’ ( cici θβ an- ) man ‘teaches’ the paths of the vitalization of both this life and the next (Y 43.2–3), the ‘seers’ of the da ē vas , the karapans and kavis , use their power to ‘yoke man with bad actions in order to ruin (his) existence’. They end up as ‘guests in the house of druj for eternity’ (Y 46.11, cf. Y 32.12). Thus the poet clearly sets himself against the traditional seers who offi ciated for the da ē va cult (cf. Y 45.11). Just as the ‘vitalizing intuition’ is the supernatural source of Zarathu š tra’s knowledge of the ultimate things, the da ē vas could have been the source for the kavis . In the partly obscure Y 32.14, where we fi nd ritual features else-where associated with the cult of the da ē vas , at issue is apparently the pro-fessional activity of the kavis and karapans , since in the following stanza the poet execrates the k ə uu ī t ā t- and karap ō .t ā t- . Y 34.5 is singularly signifi cant in this connection. As we saw, in this stanza the poet declares on behalf of his followers that the G ā thic gods are superior to all the ‘ xrafstar da ē vas and the men’. The context of the declaration is the poet’s concern for his soul while in contact with the supernatural, which being without the body is in need of divine protection, just as the soul of the dead is in its fi nal journey to the beyond. The seer accordingly commends his soul to the G ā thic gods ‘for the time of the rite or while asleep’. 32 ‘Did the da ē vas ever dispose of a salutary power?’ – the poet asks in Y 44.20, rejecting the eschatological effi cacy of the da ē va cult. If indeed the two situations (pursuit of divine knowledge and the passage to the beyond) are homogeneous insofar as the soul stands in need of the pro-tective supernatural power ( x š a θ ra- ), one may reasonably think that the poet’s ‘seeing’ the invisible was paradigmatically imagined after the ecstatic state or, more concretely, that it actually took place in ecstatic ritual. It is perhaps in reference to this paradigm that one should understand the condemnation in Y 32.14 and 48.10 of the da ē va cult, the ‘ du š -x š a θ ra of the lands’ ( du šə .x š a θ r ā dax \u000b iiun ą m ), and in particular the use of the apparently stimulant hoama . 33 Martin Schwartz ( 2006 ) argues that Zarathu š tra rejected in particular the cult of haoma and its pretensions, ‘the most objectionable example of the decep-tions of his rivals’ (Schwartz 2006 , p. 476). Pirart ( 1996 ), Kellens ( 1994 ), and Kellens and Swennen ( 2005 ) have connected Indo-Iranian soma / haoma rite with the attainment of divine condition. ‘Comme l’homme, le dieu plante qui pousse sur la terre (Y 10.4) est terrestre et mat é riel, mais aussi mortel, puisque le pressurer, c’est le tuer (Y 10.2: jan ) et n’acc è de à l’ é ternit é que par la repro-duction (Y 10.11) et la permanence de sa pens é e transcendente’ (Kellens and Swennen 2005 , p. 75). In the ritual consumption of haoma , the zaotar is ‘no longer a man made of matter and spirit; he is a cadaver whose mind, liber-ated from the body, has acquired the power of the god’s mind’ (Kellens and Swennen 2005 , p. 75). In the ‘mixed’ world, transcendence of mortal condi-tion requires two ritual operations: ‘la pressurage de Haoma, auquel est con-sacr é le vaste H ō m St ō m (Y 9–11.10), et la constitution d’une da ē n ā , acquise"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"322 Conclusionau Y 12.9’ (Kellens and Swennen 2005 , p. 75). The thesis of the haomic origin of human being in the H ō m St ō m is set out in greater detail in Kellens ( 2007 ). This is certainly an interesting thesis. The text probably preserves in some way a myth that accompanied ecstatic haoma ritual. The god haoma protects the departing soul (Y 9.32). The fact that the H ō m St ō m stresses the mixing of the extract of the plant with milk ( haoma- gaoman \u0004 t- ) perhaps points to a specifi c tradition. The text (Y 10.8) is at pains to distinguish the ecstasy of the (presumably) mixed haoma drink from (other) forms of ‘drunkenness’: whereas these are accompanied by the a ē šə ma , the former leads to ‘blissful ascension’ ( a š\u0004 i- uruu ā sman- ). 34 The poets of the Vedic K ā n \u0004 va family criticize ‘the habit of other priestly families who make offerings of plain Soma (to V ā yu and In \u0004 dra) without mixing it with milk or curds, with honey or with barley... The recipients of the Soma mixed with milk or curds are Mitra and Varun \u0004 a’ (Parpola 2002 , p. 59). According to Parpola, a number of linguistic and cultural peculiarities of the 8th book of the R \u0003 gveda suggest for the K ā n \u0004 va family tradition a location in Central Asia in the neighbourhood of Iranian speakers. The mixing of the haoma extract with milk does not seem to be a specifi cally Zoroastrian adaptation of the rite. Whether or not Falk ( 1989 ) is right in his view that the sacred plant was (as it is now) Ephedra, the motive behind the rejection of the haoma drink could hardly have been its psyche-delic effects per se. Further, the use of the stimulant drug cannot account for the manic conduct ( a ē šə ma ), abhorred in the G ā th ā s, of the participants in the da ē va cult. The a ē šə ma is an institution or, more concretely, a ritual behaviour which must refl ect the stylized ethos of the warrior. 35 Behind the rejection of the haoma stands the repudiation of the da ē va cult. The former is not the cause but the effect of the rejection of the latter. The fundamental association of the soma with the night and martial valour (of In \u0004 dra) in the Vedic literature seems to have ancient roots. The haoma rite, continued after a fashion in the Yasna ritual, 36 is at odds with the doctrine of the da ē n ā . The da ē n ā is the way to the divine sphere in the G ā th ā s (Y 48.4) and in some later Avestan traditions (in Yt 17.16 a š i and da ē n ā m ā zdayasni are sisters, daughters of Mazd ā and A \u0007 rmaiti, both G ā thic eschatological facilitators; in the fragment from Hadoxt Nask 2, the da ē n ā is the psychopomp 37 ). The attainment of the divine condition by way of the da ē n ā as this is conceived in the G ā th ā s undermines the haoma rite and its eschatological pretensions. Pirart ( 1996 ) points to the ‘parallelism’ of three ritual pairs: the a š avan and the sacrifi cial animal; the haoma juice and milk; the soul ( urvan ) and the da ē n ā as a young woman in the HN2 fragment. In fact, the last pair duplicates the second. Pirart’s speculative resolution of the duplication, among others, disregards the conceptual problem mentioned above: ‘L’ â me de la vache ou le lait de la vache, ce qui semble revenir au m ê me, et, d’autre part, le suc de Hauma sont eux aussi des pr é fi gurations. Envoy é s aux dieux moyennant le pressurage et l’immolation, ils occupent dans l’au-del à les places que, lors de cet ultime sacrifi ce qu’est la mort, viendront occu-per l’ â me du sacrifi ant et sa conscience religieuse’ (Pirart 1996 , p. 7). In effect,"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"Conclusion 323the doctrine of the da ē n ā replaces the haoma ritual (and myth 38 ) as the frame of eschatology in the G ā th ā s. I tried to show that xratu- ‘resourcefulness’ in the G ā th ā s possesses the specifi c sense of eschatological effi cacy. In Y 34.10, the huxratu- is the ‘one who knows’ ( v ī duuah- ) the goddess A \u0007 rmaiti, closely associated with the da ē n ā . In Y 51.5 being huxratu- is the condition of acquir-ing the ‘ a š\u0004 a -oriented cow’ ( a š\u0004 ā t hac ā gao- ). In YAv. texts the epithet is used only in the H ō m St ō m (see AW , col. 1819), once of the beseecher of the god haoma (Y 9.23) and once apparently of the god himself (Y 10.2). 39 The usage may well go back to the pre-Zoroastrian haoma rite and indicate a context comparable to that of the G ā thic usage. Clear refl ections of this conception of the sacred drink are found in Zoroastrian Pahlavi literature where h ō m ī sp ē d is darm ā n ī amarg ī h , the panacea that brings about immortality. At the end of time, the fra š gird , according to the Wiz ī dag ī h ā ī Z ā dspram (35.15), the consumption of h ō m ī sp ē d during the celebration of the fi nal yasna res-urrects the dead and immortalizes the living ( k ē - š murdag ā n pad-i š z ī ndag ud z ī ndag ā n pad-i š a-marg baw ē nd ). 40 As far as the G ā th ā s were concerned, the fate of the haoma rite was tied with the cult of the da ē vas . The observa-tions made by Pirart ( 1996 ) and Kellens and Swennen ( 2005 ) about the Indo-Iranian soma / haoma rite underwrite its eschatological signifi cance, and if the rite was part and parcel of the da ē va cult, a virtual certainty, 41 the latter too has to be placed in the same fi eld. Here is, then, another indication of the eschatological valence of the da ē vas . I have already noted the signifi cant place of eschatology in the classical Greek picture of Iranian religious lore. The magi claimed for their rite, according to Greek accounts, the power of making the world immortal. In the Derveni author’s commentary, the magi perform a rite that facilitates the passage of the soul to the beyond. What stood out for the Greeks in Iranian religious traditions were the idea of cosmic dualism and a doctrine of the end of things based on the notion of immortal soul. Zoroastrian eschatology must have been particularly striking for the Greeks. One must give due atten-tion to this fact. It is in the context of this perception that the magi’s noctur-nal rite is assimilated to the mysteries. The Pythagorean idea of the ‘demonic soul’, which Detienne ( 1963 , pp. 93–117) traces back to the dem ō n and the h ē r ō s in Hesiod’s Works , is in its basic conception more comparable with the Iranian idea of the soul, even if the tutelary role and the imagery of a privi-leged afterlife associated with the Hesiodic notions ( Works 123–25) are prom-inent in the usage Plato makes of the Pythagorean idea in his political myth of the philosopher-guardian. 42 Just as much as the mysteries (Plato, Phaedo 66–70), philosophy is a discipline of ‘purifi cation’ aimed at a blessed afterlife, probably in the ethereal heavens; philosopher is the true myst ē s . The purpose and the method, however conceived (whether it is purely ritual, or a matter of the lifestyle, or is synonymous with intellectual and moral cultivation) – this constellation is at odds with Greek civic religion. 43 The presence of such a cultural and intellectual constellation provided the context for the reception of comparable Iranian religious ideas."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"324 Conclusion The concern with the fate of the soul is paramount in the G ā th ā s, as we have seen. In this perspective, one may perhaps describe the process of the repudi-ation of the da ē va cult as the ‘reoccupation’ of a position that continued to exert itself by requiring the new ideology answer an old question, namely that of the way to a blissful afterlife. 44 It is a matter of the persistence of the function and not necessarily of the content. Whatever else G ā thic religious thought may have been, it prominently contained a doctrine of the attain-ment of the divine sphere through an authoritative schedule of observances ( ratu- ), and a doctrine of the end of things. The opposition to the da ē va cult had a constitutive role in the formation of the former. Traces of a ritual with eschatological aims have been observed in the Yasna rite. 45 How to account for the doctrine of a fi nal and defi nitive renewal of the world, and the cosmic optimism refl ected in the doctrine? There are fugitive indications in the Avesta and Zoroastrian Pahlavi texts that connect the da ē va cult with the underworld. I pointed out that in V 3.7 the dwelling of the da ē vas is described as the ‘cave of druj ’ whence they ‘rush’ ( han \u0004 duuar ə n \u0004 ti ) onto the steep heights of Mount Arzūr ( ar ə zūrahe gr ī uuaiia ). The Bundahi š n chapter on the mountains (9) locates dar ī du š ox ‘gate of hell’ on the same peak and repeats V 3.7: Arzūr gr ī wag pad dar ī du š ox k ē - š ham-dw ā ri š n ī h ī d ē w ā n padi š baw ē d ‘on the heights of Mount Arzūr (is) the gate of hell through which the rushing-together of the D ē vs (into the world) takes place’. 46 The aim of the ham-dw ā ri š n ī h is the ritual ground (cf. Y 30.6), which evidently has to be placed on mountainous heights, i.e. Mount Arzūr. Recall the testimony of Herodotus, Histories 1.131: ‘it is their [the Persians] custom to go up to the highest summits of the mountains and sacrifi ce to Zeus, call-ing the entire vault of heaven Zeus’. Yama’s gate to the underworld is also on lofty mountains with watercourses, according to RV 10.14, as we have seen. A \u0007 b ā n Ya š t (5.3, 5.25) places Yima’s sacrifi ce to the goddess of waters on the peak Hukairiia whence celestial waters stream into the sea vouru.ka š\u0004 a (cf. Y 65.3). 47 The tradition about this peak and the celestial waters is also found in Pahlavi texts. The Bundahi š n describes Hugar ī buland as ā n k ē - š ā b ī Ardw ī sūr azi š fr ō d jah ē d ‘the one from which the waters of An ā hit ā streams down’. 48 The connection between mountainous heights and the passage to the beyond thus goes back to the common Indo-Iranian period. In V 19.30 the two guard dogs that watch over the č inwad puhl ‘bridge of the collector’, on Mount D ā it ī , accompany the welcoming da ē n ā of the righteous urvan , but it is likely that these dogs were originally those of the Indo-Iranian *Yama (cf. RV 10.14.10–12), who is referred to as the ‘gatherer of men’ ( sam \r gamana- jan ā n ā m \r ) in the hymn dedicated to him in the R \u0003 gveda. If Kellens ( 1988 ) is right that Avestan cinuuat ō p ə r ə tu- should be derived from ξ ci ‘collect or heap’ and thus, according to its form, cannot mean the ‘bridge of separator’ (despite the judicial function of the bridge in Zoroastrian lore) but ‘le pont de l’empileur’ (332), and that the ‘builder of the bridge’ to the beyond is indeed Yama’s Iranian counterpart Yima, the builder of the vara , we can reasonably conceive of Yima as the original facilitator of the passage to the realm of the"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"Conclusion 325dead. 49 He carries in V 2 a goad and a horn ( su β r ā - ), presumably for collecting men and animals, and builds an enclosure ( vara- ) made of clay (V 2.31) where men live, if not an immortal, at least a very long and happy life. Originally he would have collected the souls of the dead and led them to the under-world. 50 Against this background, Yima’s sacrifi ce to the goddess An ā hit ā on Hukairiia, the point of contact with celestial waters, reveals its signifi cance. The celestial waters (the Milky Way, according to Witzel 1984 ) are associated in the Veda with the night sky, Varun \u0004 a and Yama. The ‘underworld’ kingdom of Yama, the abode of the dead, is also the stone house ( hamry á - ) of Varun \u0004 a, the night sky where the celestial waters are found (Kuiper 1964 , pp. 114ff.) and into which the sun withdraws after dusk: RV 7.88.2 sv à r y á d á ś man ‘sun in the rock’ (Kuiper 1964 , pp. 108ff.). 51 The G ā th ā s use neither diiau- nor asman- to refer to the sky or heavens. 52 It is hard to explain why the epithet an ā hita- is used of the persons and the implements of the sacrifi ce offered to Mithra by the god Haoma on Hukairiia (Yt 10.88) except through the compelling asso-ciation of the summit with the goddess of celestial waters. 53 This peak con-nects Yima, the original collector of souls, with the night sky and haoma , and hence with the nocturnal sacrifi ce. The goddess herself, one will recall, is not a stranger to nocturnal sacrifi ce, as we saw. Kellens ( 2002 – 2003 , p. 321) points out the ‘real solitude’ of An ā hit ā : ‘Elle n’est pas mention é e dans les Ya š ts des autres dieux et aucun de ceux-ci ne l’est dans le sien’. But it does not seem to be the goddess that is the recipient of the non-Zoroastrian Yima’s sacri-fi ce, although her ‘solitude’ in the pantheon, her association with the da ē vas and nocturnal sacrifi ce (repudiated by the goddess in A \u0007 b ā n Ya š t) and her domain in the night sky – all these compromise her greatly. We have seen that behind Y 32.6 pouruua ē nah- ‘who has committed much wrong’ is probably Yima, named in Y 32.8, who is thus implicated in the da ē va cult. The da ē vas were, then, intimately connected with the passage of the soul to the under-world. 54 Their sacrifi cial cult was celebrated at night in the mountains, near a cave, attended by the initiates, perhaps rehearsing, as in the mysteries, the fi nal journey of the soul (guided by Yima) to the underworld, to the ‘house’ of the da ē vas , the place of the nocturnal sojourn of the sun. The strange story related of Yam (Yima) and the D ē vs in the third book of the D ē nkard , according to which he apparently wins immortality for the ‘creatures’ from the D ē vs in a verbal contest, 55 perhaps evokes, albeit through a Zoroastrian prism, an ancient myth about Yima and the da ē vas , whose verbal interaction presided over the passage of the soul to its lasting abode. Notes 1 Compare Vernant’s remarks: ‘l’attitude spirituelle qui est propre aux orphiques et qui les place aux marges extr ê mes de la religion civique comme du corps social, trouve dans la philosophie le moyen de se transposer et de s’int é grer à la cit é . Pour un Platon comme pour un Aristote, l’exercise de la philosophie n’a pas d’autre fi n que de se rendre soi-m ê me divin, autant que possible.

They are intelligible only in the context of thought obsessed by individual salvation and the problem of the soul in relation to time’ (Detienne 1999 , p. 122). 2 See Detienne 1963 , pp. 112–15. 3 Compare Vernant 1990 , pp. 176–78. ‘The Dionysiac religion, in the savage form of possession, and Pythagoreanism, in the intellectual and ascetic form of spiritual purifi cation, both – in opposite ways – bypass sacrifi ce in order to draw nearer to the gods. The aim they share explains how it is that, despite their mutual opposition, omophagy and vegetarianism are (as there is evidence to show) in certain instances practiced within a single sect’ (Vernant 1990 , p. 178). The ‘eccentricity’ of these practices is dependent on the ‘normality’ of sacrifi ce as conducted in the offi cial religion of the polis . But this can hardly mean that the function of the practices was to affi rm the ‘normal’ instance. Why then put, e.g. the Adonia, in such a per-spective, as Vernant ( 1990 , pp. 143ff.) generally does – unsuccessfully in my mind, as may be seen especially in Vernant 1990 , pp. 163–67? ‘Far from embodying the spirit of wheat, Adonis’ position is sometimes above and at other times below the cereals; never does he belong to the same sphere as they. His destiny leads him dir-ectly from myrrh to the lettuce and this is, in a sense, an indication that he bypasses the cereals which lie quite outside his path. It thus illustrates the temptations and dangers of a way of life that would seek to elude normality’ (Vernant 1990 , p. 147). According to Vernant ( 1990 , pp. 164ff.), the Adonia is a specifi c usage made of the ‘code’ of the ‘Greek religious system’, which is opposed to the usage made by the offi cial religion. Nonetheless, Vernant himself admits that ‘within the Greek reli-gious system’ and against the normality of marriage, seduction is always negative and dangerous. Thus, following Detienne, on whose book The Garden of Adonis he is commenting, Vernant formulates ‘the hypothesis that religious thought was all the more insistent in consecrating the unique signifi cance of marriage by opposing it to erotic seduction, since, in default of an unequivocal legal defi nition, the distinction between concubine and legitimate spouse remained in the fi fth and fourth centuries somewhat hazy and uncertain’ (Vernant 1990 , p. 182). Then, how to understand the ‘glorifi cation of Adonis and erotic seduction’? 4 Compare Henrichs 1981 . 5 It has been suggested that In \u0004 dra took over from the Indo-Iranian god of victory *Vr \u0005 traghna, the breaker of obstacles. See Thieme 1960 , pp. 311–14 and S ö hnen 1997 . In an Avestan fragment (Aog 77) the passage to the other world is described as the ‘path of the implacable Vayu’. In two Pahlavi texts ( D ē nkard and D ā tast ā n ī d ē n ī g ) V ā y of the Long Dominion is charged with ‘smiting the breath-soul of men’ (Zaehner 1972 , p. 87). Vayu is the god of the ‘breath of life’, who takes away the dead (Lommel 1927 , pp. 148ff.) and plays a role in the resurrection at the end of time ( D ē nkard 9, 23.1–5). In Ya š t 15 (53–56), the good Vayu is the teacher of spells against the da ē vas . The second of the three cakes consecrated at the departure of the soul (the dawn after the third night of a death) is in the god’s honour. See Gray 1929 , p. 169. In Mah ā bh ā rata , Bh ī ma, the unruly and savage warrior who is as swift as the wind, is the son of the god V ā yu ‘wind’. In the Vedic India, V ā yu was associ-ated with In \u0004 dra, who may have taken over some of the warlike characteristics and activities of the wind god.

The cow is intimately connected with the vision-soul da ē n ā which in the G ā th ā s has a psychopompic function. See Piras 2003 . 12 Kellens’ interpretation of a š\u0004 ā t hac ā as a substitute for a š\u0004 auuan- is acceptable, as far as its semantics is concerned, if one keeps the eschatological signifi cance of the latter in the foreground. See Kellens 1995 , pp. 29–38. In the G ā th ā s, the word a š\u0004 a- is regularly used metonymically for the divine realm, e.g. Y 32.13 dar ə s ā t a š\u0004 ahii ā ‘(hold back) from seeing a š a ’. The construction abl. + hac ā seems to have an idiomatic sense in the OAv. texts. See my discussion in Chapter 6 . 13 Compare Kellens 1994 , pp. 52–53. 14 Admittedly, the relation between the urvan and the ‘mental state’ in which form life continues after death is unclear, although in some sense the urvan of the cow must survive death. Compare Pirart 1996 , 2012 , pp. 65–66. Kellens ( 1995 , 355) trans-lates Y 29.6bb′ n ō it a ē uu ā ahū vist ō , na ē d ā ratu š a š\u0004 ā t c ī t hac ā : ‘Jamais celui qui n’a q’un seul é tat n’a trouv é ni (un Ma î tre) ni un plan adopt é à l’Agencement’. I fi nd his analysis of the verse line problematic. First, the implication of Kellens’ trans-lation is that, except for human beings, worldly creatures have no ahura . It is hard to reconcile this conception with how the word is otherwise used in the G ā th ā s. Second, in what sense should the ‘plan’ and the ‘plan adapt é à l’Agencement’ be understood, since elsewhere Kellens (Kellens and Pirart 1990 , p. 308) translates ratu- as ‘mod è le, prototype’? Has the role or place of the cow in the cosmic order not been envisaged? This cannot be right. Third, Kellens in effect treats a ē uu ā ahū as a possessive adjective, something like *a ē uu ā .ahu- ‘one who has one existence’, whereas if such a compound existed, the sandhi would have made it something like * a ē uu ā hu- and the verse line would have been one syllable short. 15 Compare Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 34: ‘L’ uruuan de la vache est, lors de chaque c é r é monie, l’ambassadeur de l’ uruuan humain et fait le chemin que ce dernier fera un jour vers l’au-del à , acc é dant au but que l’homme a choisi par ses pratiques rituelles: les lumi è res du jour, la maison d’Ahura Mazd ā ou le ciel nocturne, la maison de la Druj. Le sacrifi ce g â thique a donc acquis une port é e eschatologique’. The acquisition is apparently in relation to the ‘traditional’ cosmological func-tion of sacrifi ce, a development that is accompanied by its being moved to day-time, whether the former prompts the latter or the other way around, which seems to be favoured by Kellens and Pirart: ‘pour l’homme g â thique, le sacrifi ce rendu aux dieux n’a plus pour but, comme l’ agnihotra v é dique, de garantir le retour de l’aurore’ (Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 33). The twice-daily milk offering into the fi re agnihotra coincides with the sunrise and the sunset, as Swennen ( 2003 , p. 93) points out. See also Heesterman 1993 , pp. 210–14. 16 In the V ī d ē vd ā d 7.79 libations made after sunset and those made with nasumait ī m ā p ə m are said to be druj practices. It seems like these two qualifi cations belong to the same context. Now, the expression nasumait ī m ā p ə m , usually translated ‘water defi led by a corpse’, should not be understood as describing an accidental cir-cumstance, i.e. it does not urge caution. The suffi x -mant- signifi es association or possession. Thus the phrase describes a type of chthonic libation, perhaps tenden-tiously, such as water mixed with the blood of an immolated animal. 17 On the choai see Rudhardt 1992 , pp. 246–48. 18 See Kellens 1990 , 165–71; Piras 2003 . 19 See Ahmadi 2012 . Kellens ( 1995 , pp. 49–51) connects the da ē n ā of the Hadoxt Nask II fragment, the female psychopompic ‘vision-soul’, with ‘dawn’ (Vedic us \u0004 á s- , Avestan u š ah- ): ‘L’aurore et la dayan â sont toutes deux des montreuses de chemin’"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"328 Conclusion(Kellens 1995 , p. 49). ‘(L)a dayan â est non seulement d é fi nie par son nom comme une capacit é de voyance, mais entretient un rapport intime et multilat é ral, à la fois actif, passif et causetif, avec l’acte de voir.

See also Kellens ( 1990 , pp. 165–71), and Schmidt ( 1975 ) for a different interpretation. 20 See Kellens and Pirart 1988 , pp. 32–36 and Hintze 2004 . 21 Compare Benveniste 1970 , pp. 8–9. Some aspects of Cantera’s view of the ritual role of the da ē n ā ( 2012 , pp. 47–48) are questionable: ‘l’auteur italien [Panaino] voit dans le refus de Yima le rejet du mariage avec sa propre da ē n ā apr è s sa mort... si Panaino a mis l’accent sur l’union avec la da ē n ā apr è s la mort, je le mets sur l’union de la da ē n ā avec l’ uruuan du sacrifi ant pendant la liturgie longue. J’estime que le sacrifi ce est la cl é interpr é tive du mythe de Yima dans le V2: le refus d’une fonction dans le rituel, en rapport avec la da ē n ā , est à la base de l’ é chec de l’essai de l’immortalit é de Yima. L’union rituelle avec la da ē n ā permet d’apporter aux hommes la vision de l’au-del à et leur assurer l’arriv é e au monde des dieux apr è s la mort avec l’assistance de leur propre da ē n ā . Le refus (par incapacit é ) d’ ê tre porteur de la da ē n ā a pour cons é quence que l’immortalit é obtenue par l’activit é rituelle de Yima ne soit pas d é fi nitive, mais reste utopique, d é plac é e, hors du monde des dieux’. Generally speaking, this theory tries to explain too much. I especially fi nd the idea of sexual union between the sacrifi cer’s urvan and da ē n ā during the rit-ual as the ‘guarantee’ of the ‘eschatological success’ for him and the community incomprehensible. See Cantera 2012 , p. 55, p. 62. ‘Cette union donne au sacrifi -ant la capacit é de faire un entretien avec la divinit é , de se rappeler de la “vision”, de la m é moriser sous forme de mots ( mar- ) et de l’apporter ( bar- ) aux hommes. M é moriser la da ē n ā par des mots et l’apporter aux hommes est le but du sacrifi ce; c’est la technique sacrifi cielle qui garantee le succ è s eschatologique à la commun-aut é sacrifi cielle’ (Cantera 2012 , p. 63). Pirart’s speculation that the union of the dead’s urvan and da ē n ā has the purpose of procreating eschatological combatants, the sao š yant , whatever one may think of it as an interpretation of Zoroastrian data, is in itself comprehensible: (spiritual) sexual copulation leads to (spiritual) procre-ation. However, one cannot see how such a union engenders the capacity to con-verse with the god, acquire the eschatological vision, etc. Where the da ē n ā is said to be a sexual partner, what could ‘memorizing the da ē n ā in verbal form’ mean? 22 Compare Kellens and Pirart 1988 , pp. 30–32. 23 See Heesterman 1962 . 24 Compare Thieme 1960 , pp. 311–14; S ö hnen 1997 . 25 But compare Heesterman 1993 , p. 212: ‘the brahmin was not a priest and in fact never fully became one. His lineal ancestor was the consecrated warrior, the vr ā tya , who spawned the consecrated soma sacrifi cer-to-be, the d ī ks \u0004 ita ’. According to Parpola ( 2002 , pp. 63–64), the ś rauta royal rites were adopted from the indigen-ous population. ‘These rituals which had been performed in South Asia before the arrival of the Aryans associated with the family books of the R \u0003 gveda and the Soma cult were however presented as “variants” of the Soma sacrifi ce, which was now made an essential part of them, and all ritual acts were given a R \u0003 gvedic mantra to be pronounced at their performance’ (Parpola 2002 , p. 64). The ecstatic soma cult was one of the rituals that Indo-Aryans brought with them to their new territories. 26 See Ahmadi 2014 . 27 See Schlerath 1968 , p. 150. I will not speculate about the relation of the G ā thic formula with the Vedic d é va- m á rtya-. In RV 6.48.19ab ( paro hi martyair asi samo devair uta ś riy ā ), for example, the second term may have the general sense of the ‘mortal’ opposed to the ‘god’.

For fi nding out the source of and dealing with the plague, Achilles says ‘let us ask some seer or priest, or even a dealer in dreams, for the dream too is from Zeus’ ( Iliad 1.62–63). 33 Falk ( 1989 ) argues that the soma / haoma plant was Ephedra, whose extracts prod-uce the stimulating Ephedrine. Taken in excess, it causes heart palpitations, sweat-ing, vertigo, and nausea and vomiting (Falk 1989 , p. 87), symptoms which may be reasonably assumed to underlie urūpaiia- ‘make feel pain’ in Y 48.11. 34 See Kellens 1999 for the interpretation of a š\u0004 i- as ‘d é part, mise en route (pour l’au-del à )’ (Kellens 1999 , p. 464). It is also said in the same text (Y 10.13) that the sacred drink enhances the mind’s learning and refl ecting capacity ( spainiiah- cistiuuas-tara- ). See Falk 1989 , pp. 80–82 for Vedic texts that express the same idea. See also Kellens 2011 , pp. 99–103. 35 See Y 9.27 and compare Falk 1989 , p. 87: ‘ephedrine was a reliable stimulant for warriors and a mighty aphrodisiac.

The close association of In \u0004 dra and Soma in Vedism cannot be insignifi cant. Compare Parpola 2002 , p. 87: ‘The R \u0003 gvedic hymns repeatedly emphasise that their enemies, the D ā sas, did not press Soma or worship In \u0004 dra’. 42 See Detienne 1963 , pp. 102–106, pp. 112–17. ‘C’est Platon aussi qui reprenait un sch è me pythagoricien, lorsqu’il affi rmait que les dirigeants, dont la nature est philosophique, appartiennent à la race d’or.

Compare Plato, Timaeus 90b–c. 43 See Vernant 1990 , pp. 117–19, p. 176. 44 I borrow the idea, mutatis mutandis , from Hans Blumenberg’s critique of the ‘secu-larization’ thesis of the modern age. See Blumenberg 1983 , pp. 63–75. ‘What mainly occurred in the process that is interpreted as secularization, at least (so far) in all but a few recognizable and specifi c instances, should be described not as the transpos-ition of authentically theological contents into secularized alienation from their ori-gin but rather as the reoccupation of answer positions that had become vacant and whose corresponding questions could not be eliminated’ (Blumenberg 1983 , p. 65). 45 See Kellens 1994 ; Kellens and Swennen 2005 , pp. 75–76; Cantera 2012 , pp. 225–27. Kellens ( 2004 ) rejects what he calls the ‘ethical’ understanding of the G ā thic"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"330 Conclusiontriad (good thinking, good speech, good action) based on his demonstration that the triad has a strictly ritual signifi cance in YAv. texts. ‘Le fait est que nous ne com-prenons pas bien les G â th â s et les passages o ù intervient la triade pas mieux que les autres. Y reconna î tre l’expression d’une é thique abstraite é trang è re au pass é indo-iranien comme au futur de l’Avesta r é cent rel è ve seulement de la strat é gie du d é sir ou de la crispation sur l’habitude’ (Kellens 2004 , pp. 288–89). I am not sure what is intended by ‘abstract ethics’, but if it is something like Kantian morality, Kellens’ denial of it to the G ā th ā s is incontrovertible – but also obvious. If, how-ever, by ethics Kellens means the regulation of conduct outside the strictly ritual sphere, I do not see how our very limited comprehension of the G ā th ā s may be used to deny an ethical conception of the triad in these compositions, any more than to affi rm it. To the proponents of the latter, Kellens wants to say more than simply: ‘you have not shown a basis for ascribing it to the G ā th ā s’, which would have been fair enough. Indeed one should add to it: ‘ what is it that you want to ascribe to the G ā th ā s?’, since, as I argued in the fi rst part, it is never clear what is meant by ‘ethics’, e.g. in Gershevitch or Gnoli. Rather, Kellens says: ‘you have no basis to ascribe an ethical conception of the triad to the G ā th ā s, and since we do not fi nd it (presumably) before or after (in the liturgical texts), there cannot be such a conception in the G ā th ā s’. Thus, at best, the case for the denial is circumstan-tial. But Kellens’ denial is not restricted to the triad, as we saw in the fi rst part of this book. 46 Pakzad 2005 , p. 130. 47 See Kellens 2002 – 2003 , p. 321, p. 324. 48 Pakzad 2005 , p. 129. 49 Compare Cantera 2012 , p. 51. 50 The Pahlavi gloss to V 2.41(cited in Lincoln 1981 , p. 235) reads: kū 150 s ā l ziw ē nd; hast k ē ē d ō n g ō w ē d kū n ē ktar pad gy ā n ziw ē nd; kū harguz b ē n ē m ī r ē nd ‘(in Yima’s enclosure) people live for 150 years; some say that they live happy in their soul, that they never die’. 51 Compare Witzel 1984 , p. 243 n.103: ‘Avec l’ascension de Varun \u0004 a au z é nith du ciel nocturne, Yama at son paradis se meuvent aussi’. 52 ‘Il faut vraisemblablement mettre en rapport le rejet du rituel nocturne, quoiqu’on ne voit pas exactement selon quelle articulation, avec le tabou du nom du ciel qui se manifeste dans l’ensemble des textes vieil-avestiques’ (Kellens and Pirart 1988 , p. 33). Compare Cantera 2012 , pp. 57–58. 53 Cantera ( 2012 , p. 60) maintains that the shared descriptive features of Yima’s vara and Haoma’s ‘house’ on Har ā (Y 57.21) indicate that the two are identical. Both are internally illuminated, and in both not only the stars but also the infi nite lights of heaven are visible. Kellens ( 2002 – 2003 , pp. 321–25) proposes a new analysis of the epithet ar ə duu ī - sūra- an ā hita- of the goddess ā p- ‘(celestial) Water’ (324). He derives ar ə duu ī - from ξ r ā d ‘succeed in, attain’: ar ə du- a ‘dialectal variant of ar ə dra- ’, and hence translates ar ə duu ī - as ‘celle qui r é ussit’ (Kellens 2002 – 2003 , p. 322). I pointed out that the adjective ar ə dra- probably has the sense of ‘who succeeds in attaining the divine sphere’. See esp. Y 43.2 and Y 50.4. The term sūra- ‘vigorous’ is from the same root ( ξ sū ) as sauuah- ‘vitalization’. ‘Du point de vue des é tudes religieuses, il importerait cependant de savoir pourquoi c’est la puissance sauuah qui est attribu é e à la d é esse plut ô t qu’une des nombreuses autres’ (Kellens 2002 – 2003 , p. 322). As I tried to show on various occasions in this book, the word sauuah- has a strong eschatological valence in the G ā th ā s. Finally, Kellens derives an ā hita- from ā + ξ h ā /hi ‘tie’. The semantic range of the adjective ‘untied’ is unclear. But the domain of the goddess is the celestial space. 54 According to Cantera ( 2012 , pp. 48–49), at the basis of Yima’s failure in acquiring a lasting immortality for the world lies in his refusal to carry out ‘a ritual function’, namely to have sexual union with his da ē n ā during sacrifi ce. In V2 Mazd ā asks him"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"Conclusion 331to be the ‘memorizer and carrier for the da ē n ā ’, but Yima refuses, so the god offers him another mission. The reason why Yima refuses to ‘carry’ the da ē n ā is that he himself is the builder of the enclosure where the da ē n ā , understood as ‘l’aurore int é rioris é e’, is imprisoned in Yima’s vara (Cantera 2012 , pp. 61–62). But then why does the god ask him to ‘be the carrier of the da ē n ā ’? Or, in another perspective, why does the god ask him ? The ‘porter’ of the da ē n ā becomes (Cantera 2012 , p. 62) her ‘lib é rateur’. How does ‘being the sexual partner’ in the scenario envisaged by Cantera mean the same thing as ‘being the liberator’? The interpretive move from ‘being the memorizer and carrier for the da ē n ā ’ ( × m ə̄ r ə̄ ta b ə̄ r ə̄ taca da ē naii ā i ) to ‘being the sexual partner and memorizer of the da ē n ā ’ is unexplained. The latter phrase reverses the order of the original; more importantly, it requires at one and the same time two different senses for the word da ē n ā . 55 Cited in Lincoln 1981 , p. 235.
