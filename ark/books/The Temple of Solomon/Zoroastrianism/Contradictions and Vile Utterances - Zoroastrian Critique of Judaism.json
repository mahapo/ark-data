The Škand Gumānīg Wizār is a ninth century CE Zoroastrian theologi-cal work that contains polemics against Islam, Christianity, and Manichaeism, as well as Ju-daism. The chapters on Judasim include citations of a Jewish sacred text referred to as the \"First Scripture\" and critiques of these citations for their contradictory and illogical portrayals of the divine. This dissertation comprises two parts. The first part consists of an introductory chapter, four interpretative essays, and a conclusion. The second part consists of a text and new English translation of Škand Gumānīg Wizār Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen.My first essay presents a new approach to the relation between the citations from the First Scripture in the Škand Gumānīg Wizār and Jewish literature. Previous scholars have tried to identify a single parallel text in the Hebrew Bible or rabbinic literature as the origin for each ofcitation. Borrowing approaches developed by scholars of the Qurʾān and early Islamic litera-ture, I argue that the Škand Gumānīg Wizār's critique draws on a more diverse and, likely, oral network of traditions about the biblical patriarchs and prophets. My second essay contains a close reading of three linked passages concerning angels in Škand Gumānīg Wizār Chapter Fourteen. I argue that the depiction of angels in these passages re-sponds to a widespread Jewish belief in Metatron, an angelic co-regent whose power equals God's,. This essay analyzes the these angelic passages in light of the traces of this belief that can be found in the Babylonian Talmud, Jewish mystical literature, and other texts. My third essay concerns one of the longest citations in the critique of Judaism, a version of the story of the Garden of Eden from the first three chapters of the Book of Genesis.

Whereas the earlier Dēnkarddepicts Judaism mythically, relating the story of Judaism's creation by an evil demon, the Škand Gumānīg Wizār depicts Judaism textually, as citations from the First Scripture. I argue that the Škand Gumānīg Wizār's presentation of Judaism as a text is an interpretative key for understanding the Zoroastrian work as a whole.- 2 -"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Table of ContentsiiAcknowledgementsiiiAbbreviations1Chapter One: Methods and Approaches31Chapter Two: The Genealogy of Abraham57Chapter Three: Unnecessary Angels77Chapter Four: The Garden as Motif107Chapter Five: Creating Judaism126Chapter Six: Conclusion131Bibliography151Appendix One: Text and Translation of Škand Gumānīg Wizār Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen175Appendix Two: Aṇgōšīdaa, Terminus Technicus?178Appendix Three: Manuscripts of the Škand Gumānīg Wizār- i -"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"AcknowledgementsOver the course of writing this dissertation, I have benefitted from the support and guidance of individuals at three great institutions: the University of California, Berkeley; the Graduate Theological Union; and the Hebrew University, Jerusalem. In the Bay Area, I would like to thank the staff, faculty, and my fellow students in Jewish Studies and through-out the university, in particular G. R. F. Ferrari and the late David W. Johnson, S. J. In Jerusalem, I owe a special debt of gratitude to Domenico Agostini, Julia Rubanovich, Shai Secunda, David Shulman, and Shaul Shaked for their unflagging support of me and this project. Yaakov Elman of Yeshiva University helped me formulate the idea at the outset and read drafts of chapters early on and Richard Kalmin of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America read a draft of the entire dissertation in a late stage of preparation, as did Eli Stern ofthe Hebrew University; the work is better for their comments and suggestions. I spent January to May 2011 doing manuscript research in India. My hosts in Bombay and Navsari were unceasingly helpful in navigating their libraries and archives. I have a great debt of gratitude to the staff, librarians, and trustees of the K. R. Cama Oriental Institute, Bombay, in particular Muncherji N. M. Cama, Homai N. Modi, and Dr. Nawaz B.

This polemic, referred to in what follows as the critique of Judaism, is com-prised entirely of citations from a work the author refers to as the naxustīn niβǝ̄, which can betranslated as \"the First Scripture\" or \"the First Book\"; many of these citations are paralleled in Jewish sources. The scholarly attention that has been devoted to the two chapters on Judaism in the ŠGW has focused on the question of the origin of these citations. Scholars have been particularly interested in how and to what degree Mardānfarrox ī Ohrmazddādān, the otherwise unknown author of the ŠGW, was influenced by Jewish sources, especially the Bible and rabbinic literature. Building on this previous work, this dissertation will consider the critique of Judaism from a new perspective. While taking up the question of the citations'relation to potential sources, Jewish and otherwise, my focus will be on the connection between the critique of Judaism and the rest of the ŠGW. In this dissertation, I hope to demonstrate that the contents of the citations, Mardānfarrox's interpretations of them, and even the \"Judaism\" that is the object of the critique, are determined by the theological, ethi-cal, and literary priorities of the ŠGW, rather than by the requirements of an exterior source. In other words, I will argue that the critique of Judaism is an integral part of the ŠGW and nota set of citations transplanted from another text.The ŠGW and Pahlavi LiteratureThe ŠGW is one of the texts written in Zoroastrian Middle Persian,1 also known as Zoroastrian Book Pahlavi, in the centuries after the fall of the Sasanian Empire (226-650 CE)to the invading Arab and Islamic forces.2 Much of Pahlavi literature consists of works finallyredacted in the early Islamic period that preserve Sasanian and earlier traditions. These include translations and commentaries on the Avesta (the Zoroastrian sacred scripture), law codes, wisdom and ethical literature (andarz), and certain short works originating in the circleof the court. These texts include two which will be discussed at some length below: the Bun-1.Middle Persian was also used for Sasanian inscriptions, seals, bullae and letters, as well as Manichaean and Christian texts. Each of kind of text displays slightly different linguistic features.

Both these texts will be introduced in more detail in the relevant chapters below. In addition to Sasanian works in Pahlavi, preserved by Zoroastrian priests, another body of Middle Persian literature from the Sasanian period was preserved in Arabic translation. These include techni-cal works of astronomy, medicine, and philosophy; courtly ethics and \"mirrors for kings\"; theepic history of the \"Book of Sovereigns\" (xwadāy nāmag), which eventually served as the basis for Ferdowsī's Shahnameh;3 and retranslations from Pahlavi of works originally com-posed in Sanskrit, Syriac, and Greek.A second group of Pahlavi literature consists of works composed in the Islamic period; conventionally, these works have been known as the \"Ninth Century Books.\"4 These texts include legal compilations in the form of responsa, a genre that continued in New Per-sian and Gujarati;5 letters by the high priest of the provinces of Fārs and Kirmān, Manušcihr īGošn-jām, regarding a ritual controversy with his brother Zādspram, a priest in Sirkān; and theological and ritual texts written by each of the brothers. The ŠGW stands out from other texts in Pahlavi literature, both from the early and thelater period, in a number of ways. First of all, it is a tightly composed treatise strictly focusedon theology and polemics. Unlike more or less contemporary post-Islamic works, like Manušcihr's Dādestān ī Dēnīg, the ŠGW does not address ritual or legal questions at all. Fur-thermore, in opposition to the Dādestān ī Dēnīg and similar texts' lengthy retellings of Zoroastrian sacred history, the ŠGW is marked by the absence of such materials. Though, as I will show in Chapter Four, there are deep connections between the ŠGW and the cos-mogony known from other texts, on an explicit level, the accounts of the creation of the world, Zoroaster's biography and his revelation, and the final eschatological battle almost go unmentioned.The ŠGW and Rabbinic LiteratureAs will be discussed in more detail below, scholars have read the ŠGW's critique of Judaism in light of parallel passages in the Bible and rabbinic literature. As the term rabbinicliterature and references to the rabbinic texts reoccur throughout this dissertation and deserve some introduction, before preceding with the description of the ŠGW, I will provide some explanation of the term. \"Rabbinic literature\" is a modern appellation for the group of texts redacted, orally or in writing,6 by a group of Jewish sages in late antiquity, between the third 3.On the xwadāy-nāmag literature in particular see Macuch, \"Pahlavi Literature,\" 172-81 and the studies citedthere.4.Harold Walter Bailey, Zoroastrian Problems in the Ninth Century Books (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1943) and Jean de Menasce, \"Zoroastrian Literature after the Muslim Conquest,\" in The Period from the Arab Invasion to the Saljuqs, edited by Richard N.

The earliest texts of rabbinic literature include the Mishnah and Tosefta, anonymous texts mostly dealing with legal material redacted in the third century. Both are organized topically by orders (sedarim) that are divided into tractates (masekhtot); for example, the order concerning festivals is divided into tractates on the Sab-bath, Passover, Rosh Hashanah, etc. Collectively, the early rabbinic texts are known as tan-naitic, after the name Tannaim given to the earliest generation of sages and meaning \"repeaters\" or \"reciters.\"After the tannaitic period, rabbinic literature (and the rabbinic movement) can be divided between the products of two main centers: Palestine and Babylonia.12 In Palestine between the fourth and sixth centuries, the Amoraim—the interpreters of tannaitic tradi-tions—produced a series of Midrashim (singular, Midrash) on a number of books of the Bible, including Genesis, Leviticus, Lamentations, and Ecclesiastes. Alongside these midrashic works,13 sages in Palestine also engaged in translations of the Bible into Rabbinic 7.A concise introduction to rabbinic literature can be found in Charlotte Elisheva Fonrobert and Martin S.

Like its Palestinian counterpart, the Babylon-ian Talmud is structured as a commentary on the Mishnah. However, it contains more legal and narrative material than the Palestinian Talmud. This additional material is, moreover, composed more elaborately and with greater complexity. The Babylonian Talmud is marked by the prevalence of an active, anonymous voice that engages in discussions, questions con-clusions, and acts, in general, as the literary thread weaving together various earlier tradi-tions; this feature is also found in the Palestinian Talmud but to a much less degree. Some scholars have taken this voice to be that of the text's redactors. While the dating of this anonymous layer is a contentious issue in the scholarship, a second approach claims that anonymous commentary was most active from the fourth century onward and increased over time. The final redaction of the Babylonian Talmud, a related and similarly contentious issue,is generally dated to the sixth or seventh centuries.17 While all scholars agree that the major the exegetical traditions contained in Midrash, but are not necessarily identical with the rabbis.

Halivni views the redactors, a group he calls the Stammaim, as a social group living in a historical period after that of the named sages in the Babylonian Talmud. According to the most recent iteration of his theory in David Halivni, Sources and Traditions: A Source Critical Commentary on the Talmud, Tractate Baba Batra (Jerusalem: Magnes, 2007), 10, he places the redaction of the Babylonian Talmud in the eighth century CE.

The longest version of the ŠGW, which served as the base for the 1887 critical edition by the Indian Zoroastrian scholar Hoshang Dastur Jamaspji Jamasp-Asana19 and the British Orientalist and pioneering scholar of Iranian Studies Edward William West,20 contains sixteen chapters, the last of which is incomplete.21 These chapters can be roughly divided into two halves. The first half, comprised of Chapters One to Ten, contain a rationalist exposition of the main tenets of Zoroastrian theology. After an introductory chap-ter containing a dendritic metaphor of the Zoroastrian religion and an outline of the aim of the book, Chapters Two through Four contain a series of questions by an otherwise unknown Mihiraiiār i Mahmādą of Isfahan. His questions concern apparent contradictions in Zoroas-trian cosmogony, discussed in more detail in the body of this dissertation, that seem to violatethe absolute division between the good creator god Ohrmazd22 and the primordial evil antago-nist Ahriman.23 Chapter Five deals with epistemology and the necessary knowledge of God. Chapter Six consists of a refutation of materialists who deny creation and any cosmic princi-ple other than time.24 Chapter Seven is dedicated to proving the existence of an evil principletraditions. He also establishes a rubric for distinguishing the work of these redactors from other layers of the Talmud, consisting of a) evolutionary markings, that more concise statements are earlier whereas longerexplanations are later; b) linguistic criteria, that Aramaic is generally later and Hebrew generally earlier; and c) textual criteria, that the abundance of textual variants of a certain phrase in the manuscript tradition is a sign of that phrase's late formulation or addition (Aryeh Cohen, Rereading Talmud: Gender, Law and the Poetics of Sugiyot [Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1998], 35-36).

From the text's few biographical passages,40 we can glean the following information: Mardānfarrox claims that he underwent a crisis of doubt that prompted him to travel widely outside Iran, including to India, and to discuss religious ques-tions with different kinds of people. His return to the fold was shepherded by reading Zoroastrian theological literature, in particular the Dēnkard. His book, he says, is aimed at new Zoroastrian initiates—or \"young students,\" as de Menasce translates the Pazand nō-āmōžagą41—in order to inform their judgement about these rival faiths and sharpen their rhetorical skills.42 It seems that Mardānfarrox himself was a layman, rather than a priest; this fact alone makes the ŠGW unique among Zoroastrian literature.Scholars have called Mardānfarrox's account of his journey of self-discovery into question. The trope of a spiritual quest prompted by doubt can be found elsewhere in Pahlaviliterature—the Sasanian-era Ardā Wirāz Nāmag, for instance, recounts that the protagonist Wirāz's visit to Heaven and Hell was inspired by doubt about correct ritual practice43—and anearthly journey also appears in the introductory section to the Dādestān ī Mēnōg ī Xrad, a sixth century wisdom (andarz) text dealing with religious topics. The unnamed sage who is the text's protagonist is described as visiting the provinces and districts of the empire investi-gating the beliefs of the inhabitants; on the basis of the mutual opposition of these sects, he comes to the conclusion that only the Zoroastrian religion is true.44 35.ŠGW 15:46-68.36.I will address some of these passages in Chapter Four.37.ŠGW 11:25-35.

These earlier accounts, however, also point to the existence of a literary trope of a \"journey to India\" that Mardānfarrox could be borrowing in the ŠGW. The ŠGW's StyleAside from these explicit statements, more can be discerned about the author and his work from the style and overall character of the ŠGW. Despite the diversity of its subject matter, the ŠGW is unified by its style. First of all, like many other Zoroastrian texts, the ŠGW is characterized by a question-and-answer style. This is found already in the Avesta. Among the ritual manuals, prayers and poems that make up the Avesta, the most important ofwhich are the Gāthās, the sacred poems composed by the prophet Zarathushtra himself,47 are many instances of the revelation of sacred knowledge by asking questions. The Gāthās in particular are referred to as the spǝntō frašnā̊, the \"holy questions,\" in the Avestan ritual and legal compendium, the Vīdēvdād.48 This style continues in Pahlavi literature. The Dādestān īMēnōg ī Xrad, for instance, is structured as a series of questions put by an otherwise unidenti-fied sage (dānāg) to the Spirit of Wisdom (the mēnōg ī xrad of the title). Questions are not, however, only put to spiritual beings. The Dādestān ī Dēnīg is just one example among many of Pahlavi compositions written in the form of questions on various religious topics accompanied by the author's answers. The ŠGW exhibits this question-and-answer form in different ways. As mentioned above, the Second to Fourth Chapters of the book are cast as answers to questions raised by Mihiraiiār i Mahmādą. Several other expositions in the first, apologetic half of the ŠGW are presented in dialogical form, as answers to questions or objections put by various materialistsand sectarians. This is found, for instance, in the discussion of the substance of good and evilin Chapter Eight.49 Chapter Ten opens with a litany of questions a person must ask his soul and body: Who created you? For what reason? Who incites you to commit evil? and similar queries.50However, the style is employed most widely in the polemical chapters of the ŠGW. The actual critique in these chapters is cast in the form of questions and answers. The follow-ing brief example from the critique of Islam in Chapter Eleven can serve as an illustration:Weber (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2005), 3.45.Samuel N. C.

Although the Third Book of the Dēnkard also deals with theology andpolemics, the ŠGW is unique in its organization along rationalist lines. The apology for Zoroastrianism in Chapters Five through Ten begins with first principles—epistemology and a theory of perception—and proceeds from there to a proof of the necessary existence of the creator, his good nature, and the existence of his evil opponent who was also the impetus for creation. The order and logic underlying the proofs in this section lays the groundwork for the polemics which follow, devoted as they are to exposing the inherent contradictions of rival doctrines. The ŠGW and ʿilm al-kalāmThe sustained consistency and unity of rationalist argumentation is what sets the ŠGWapart from other Pahlavi works. However, as de Menasce already noted,51 the ŠGW's ratio-nality connects it to early Islamic rationalist theology. The origins of the dialectical methods of this kind of rationalist theology—in Arabic ʿilm al-kalām52—go back to the pre-Islamic period.53 Within Islam, while there were various manifestations of kalām theology developedand espoused from the eighth century on, the field was dominated and systematized by the Muʿtazilite school. At the height of its sophistication and influence in the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries, Muʿtazilite theologians formulated a compendious body of thought encompassing ontology, physics, ethics, and hermeneutics.54 Prominent as Muʿtazilites were,intellectuals from various sectarian and doctrinal groups participated in disputations for 51.The general similarity between the ŠGW and Muʿtazilite rationalism as well as specific correspondences ona number of points was already noted by de Menasce, Apologétique, 8-10 and in various notes throughout his work.52.On the definition of ʿilm al-kalām, see Richard M. Frank, \"The Science of Kalām,\" Arabic Sciences and Philosophy 2 (1992): 7-37.53.Michael C.

The parallels can be illustrated with two examples. First of all, in the discus-sion of epistemology in Chapter Five mentioned above, the terminology Mardānfarrox uses to distinguish the three means of gaining knowledge59—by necessary knowledge,60 by anal-ogy from the present to the absent,61 and by reliable report62—parallel Muʿtazilite usage. Justas importantly, the focus throughout the ŠGW on divine justice, one of the central tenets of 55.Zoroastrians, along with Jews, Christians, Muslims, Sabians, and others participated in these majālis.

These three classes are translated by de Menasce as connaissance nécessaire, connaissance par analogie and connaissance selon lapossibilité et la convenance (de Menasce, Apologétique, 65). The exact designations of the somewhat ambiguous Pazand terms are revealed in the examples Mardānfarrox provides for each type of knowledge. 60.Necessary knowledge is exemplified in ŠGW 5:12 by mathematical operations, i.e., one times one is one, two times two is four. The term is equivalent to Arabic ʿilm ḍarūrī, as opposed to ʿilm iktisabī. See Josef van Ess, Theologie und Gesellschaft im 2. und 3. Jahrhundert Hidschra. (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1997), 4:667 and Binyamin Abrahamov, \"Necessary Knowledge in Islamic Theology,\" British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies 20 (1993): 20-32.61.Analogy is the revelation of the unseen through the means of the seen: for example, in ŠGW 5:28-29: u ǝž naβaštaa θis kǝš naβaštār nǝ̄ pǝ̄dā . . . naβaštār i ą naβaštaa i acārī and regarding a text whose writer is notvisible . . . the writer of that text [exists] necessarily. Again, this is similar to the idea in Islamic epistemology and theology of reasoning \"from the present (šahīd) to the absent (ghāʾib).\" See Ess, Theologie and Gesellschaft, 4:664. 62.Knowledge by means of reliable report depends on the character of the reporter. ŠGW 5:33-34 states: u īṇ ą i aṇdar šāiiaṯ sažǝṯ būdan vīmaṇd šāiiaṯ drōg, bǝ̄ ka ą āgāhī mard gōeṯ kǝ pa rāstī xusrūb u pa vacōrdī xužmūdaa ą aṇdar rāstī u hastī vīmaṇd, And that which remains within the limits of the possible could be false, but when the man who gives that information is renowned for truth and tested in judgement that [statement] is in the bounds of truth and existence. Interestingly, this means of knowledge also corresponds to one of the modes of knowledge in Islamic, though not particularly Muʿtazilite epistemology, namely tradition (naql). This is mentioned as \"one of the paths of knowledge\" in Chapter Sixteen of ʿAbd al-Jabbār's Kitāb al-Mughnī and, called sound information (al-khabar aṣ-ṣādiq), in the Jewish philosopher Saadia Gaon's Kitāb al-ʾAmānāt wa-l-ʿItiqādāt (Prolegomena, section 5). On this source of knowledge, see George Vajda, \"La connaissance chez Saadia,\" Revue des Études Juives 126 (1967): 135-89; Franz Rosenthal, Knowledge Triumphant: the Concept of Knowledge in Medieval Islam (Leiden: Brill, 1970), 208-39; George Hourani, Islamic Rationalism: The Ethics of ʿAbd al-Jabbār (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1971), 17-36; and Marie Bernand, Le problème de la connaissance d'après le muγni du cadi ʿAbd al-Jabbār (Algiers: Société nationale d'édition et de diffusion, 1982), 167-69. - 10 -"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Muʿtazilite theology,63 closely parallels the conception of divine justice in the writing of the ninth century Baghdadi Muʿtazilite theologian Abū Isḥāq an-Naẓẓām.64 For an-Naẓẓām, the ethical orientation of a particular act was an inherent characteristic of the act itself. Thus, certain classes of actions are intrinsically bad while others are intrinsically good. The field ofGod's choice is limited to ethical actions; as Frank explains \"actions which are ethically bad in themselves are excluded as such from those which are (potential) objects of God's ability to act, 'because one who is able to do something is such that the occurrence through his agency is not impossible'.\"65 This inherent ethical orientation of actions is also what we find in the ŠGW. For both, God does good actions because they conform to his good nature and he can not do bad ones because they oppose it. What limits divine free will is the underlying orientation of action in the physical universe.66 The ŠGW and ManichaeismOther scholars have pointed out the connections between Mardānfarrox's work and Manichaeism. In the brief autobiographical passage from ŠGW Chapter Ten mentioned above, Mani is singled out for special vituperation. Mani is called \"the greatest of deceivers and the most powerful of false masters\" and his religion is described as sorcery, deception, and seduction.67 Carlo Cereti has recently argued that this special emphasis on Mani points toMardānfarrox's particular familiarity and contempt for that religion.68 Other scholars, in par-ticular Werner Sundermann,69 have pointed to Mardānfarrox's mastery over Manichaean ter-minology, a mastery certainly not displayed in the critique of Judaism. While Mihaela Timuşhas argued that Mardānfarrox's familiarity with Manichaeism is no more than the mark of a good polemicist's command of his opponent's sources,70 I will discuss a number of instances below where Mardānfarrox's arguments in the critique of Judaism are reminiscent of Manichaean critiques of the Bible as refuted by Saint Augustine. While Manichaeism was effectively extinct in the West by the ninth century, the religion continued to survive in Iran and Central Asia, where it was elevated to the state religion of the Uighur empire from 63.Gimaret, \"Muʿtazila\" and Richard C.

Edward William West dated the ŠGW to the mid-ninth century. This dating is based on an analysis of the ŠGW's use of the Dēnkard. As will be discussed in further detail in Chapter Five, Mardānfarrox mentions his dependence on the Dēnkard several times in the ŠGW. However, since he only refers to the first compiler of the Dēnkard, Ādurfarnbag ī Farroxzādān, and not the later editor Ādurbād ī Emēdān, West con-cluded that Mardānfarrox must have lived and written after the first authority but before the second. As Ādurfarnbag is dated to the reign of the ʿAbbasid Caliph al-Maʾmun (r. 813-833) and West argues that Ādurbād was a contemporary of Zādspram, who was living in 881,72 West dated the ŠGW near the end of the ninth century.73As other scholars have noted, there are at least two problems with West's argument. First of all, the dating West proposes for Ādurfarnbag is itself less than certain. It is based onĀdurnfarnbag's appearance as the Zoroastrian participant in a disputation with a Muslim named Abališ (likely a corruption of ʿAbd Allāh) before al-Maʾmūn. However, the historical reliability of this account, contained in the late Middle Persian text Gizistag Abāliš, deserves reconsideration. One cannot exclude the possibility that Ādurfarnbag appears as a character in that story because the author of this text considered him an archetypical representative of the Good Religion, just as, conceivably, Al-Maʿmun was the archetype of the wise king.74Secondly, as de Menasce pointed out, there is evidence of a third editor of the Dēnkard, named Ādurbād ī Mahraspandān ī Ašawahištān, a tenth century figure who is men-tioned in a Persian Rivāyat preserved in the British Library.75 Given the difficulty of deter-mining the nature and extent of the redactional work by these two Ādurbāds, it is impossible to know what in the extant version of Dēnkard was anterior to the ŠGW and what is depen-dent on it.76Despite these problems, most scholars have followed the ninth century dating of the ŠGW. While de Menasce rejects West's argument, on linguistic grounds he places the ŠGW 71.On Manichaeism and the Uighurs see Werner Sundermann, \"Der Manichäismus an der Seidenstrasse: Aufstieg, Blüte und Verfall,\" in Die Seidenstraße: Handel und Kulturaustausch in einem eurasiatischen Wegenetz, ed. Ulrich Hübner (Hamburg: EB-Verlag, 2005), 153-68. The most important Manichaean documents in the Parthian, Middle Persian, Sogdian, and Turkic languages were also recovered from Central Asia. The history of the discovery of the documents in the Turfan oasis in Chinese Turkestan is recounted in Samuel N. C.

Boyce,77 Cereti,78 Macuch,79 and Grenet80 follow de Menasce's dating. Recently, however, Mihaela Timuş has argued for a reevaluation of this consensus and proposed dating the ŠGW to the tenth century, after Ādurbād ī Emēdān's redaction of the Dēnkard. She bases her argument on the fact that in the ŠGW's most extended reference to the Dēnkard, it refers to the latter as the Dēnkard \"of one thousand chapters,\"81 the same name Ādurbād gave to his redaction of the work.82The Language of the ŠGWThe lack of agreement surrounding the dating of the ŠGW derives, in part, from the fact that scholars lack the original language of the text and cannot, therefore, provide a rela-tive dating on linguistic grounds. The ŠGW was originally written in Pahlavi, a name for the Zoroastrian dialect and script of Zoroastrian Middle Persian.83 However, this version of the text has not survived. The text as it stands is a transcription by the Indian Zoroastrian scholarNeryosang Dhaval84 in Pazand,85 a system for writing Pahlavi texts in the less ambiguous Avestan alphabet developed among Zoroastrians in India. Pazand, precisely because it is written in a script that can more fully represent the features of Middle Persian, also reflects the interpretation—or, as it is better to say, interpretations, since Pazand was not produced by a single individual in a single period86—of Pahlavi among the Zoroastrian community in India. Pazand includes certain dialectical forms, such as bahōṯ and šahōṯ for Middle Persian bawēd and šawēd, that are known from Early Judeo-Persian and Early New Persian texts;87 77.Boyce, \"Literature,\" 46-47.78.Cereti, La letteratura pahlavi, 79.79.Macuch, \"Pahlavi Literature,\" 150.80.Grenet, \"Extraits,\" 117.81.ŠGW 4:107.82.Mihaela Timuș, \"Humour, Tens(i)on and Religion: When a Layman Defends the Priests\" (Unpublished manuscript, last modified February 16, 2011).83.On the position of Pahlavi as compared to the various dialects of New Persian, see Gilbert Lazard, \"Du pehlevi au persan: diachronie ou diatopie?,\" in Persian Origins: Early Judeo-Persian and the Emergence ofNew Persian, ed. Ludwig Paul (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2003), 95-92.84.It is extremely difficult to date Neryosang precisely, and scholars have proposed dates ranging from the eleventh to fifteenth centuries. The most reliable approximate date seems to be the first half of the twelfth century, proposed by Shahpurshah Hormasji Hodivala, \"The Dates of Hormazdyār Rāmyār and Neryosang Dhaval,\" Journal of the K.

Balbir (Paris: Bibliothèque de l'École Pratique des Hautes Études, forthcoming), pāzand had an originally meaning of \"interpretation\" equivalent, as the tenth century historian Abū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī al-Masʿūdī states in his Murūj ad-dhahab wa maʿādin al-jawhar, to Arabic tafsīr. It was only later, perhapsas late as the seventeenth or eighteenth centuries, that pāzand acquired the meaning of \"transcription in Avestan characters.\"86.The Pazand texts were published by Edalji Kersâspji Anitâ, Pazand Texts (Bombay: Trustees of the Parsi Punchâyet, 1909) in five volumes.

While the Sanskrit is often helpful in deciphering cryptic Pazand forms, and I have used it to that effect in this dissertation, Neryosang's language is quite different from classicalSanskrit. On the one hand, this is a function of the translation itself. The Sanskrit reproducesas closely as possible the syntax and structure of the underlying Middle Persian and this slav-ishness results, not surprisingly, in a sometimes ungrammatical text. However, irrespective of the underlying Middle Persian, the Sanskrit text also gives words different meanings or different genders than those used in the classical language.89Finally, some of the manuscripts of the ŠGW also contain a Pahlavi version of part of the text; in his edition, de Menasce based the first five chapters on this Pahlavi retranslation. Whatever the function of this retranscribed Pahlavi,90 it is clearly based on the Pazand ver-sion. The Pahlavi versions often reproduce in Pahlavi Pazand readings, stray from standard Pahlavi orthography and confuse ideograms.91The Manuscripts of the ŠGWAs much as can be learned from the Pazand, Sanskrit, and Pahlavi versions of the ŠGW, the original language, and what it might be able to teach us about the place and time ofthe composition of the text, is inaccessible. This problem is further exacerbated by the poor state of the manuscripts of the ŠGW. For the publication of the 1887 edition, West consulted thirteen manuscripts, including three that contained the complete text of the ŠGW.92 One of these three was AK2, which West named after the copyist Āsādin Kaka, a sixteenth century priest and scribe from Navsari, Gujarat, one of the most important Zoroastrian centers in India.93 Derived from a copy of the oldest extant manuscript, called AK,94 this was by far the 87.Gibert Lazard, \"Pehlevi, pazend et persan,\" in La formation de la langue persane, ed.

Instead, the text for Chapters Twelve through Sixteen were based on two later manuscripts, called JE and JJ, that were in the same family as AK2 but contained errors and misreadings. While a number of additional manuscripts for the first half of the ŠGW have come to light since West's edition, the three manuscript witnesses for the second half of the work, including the two chapters on Judaism, have been lost. There is no record of JE and JJ in the various catalogs since Friedrich Müller recorded having seen JE in the collection of Dastur Hoshang Jamasp-Asa of Pune in 1899. At least until the 1940's, AK2 was in the possession of Dastur Minocher Jamasp-Asa of Bombay. Its presence is recorded in an undated catalogueof Dastur Minocher's collection completed by his widow Jerbai after the Dastur's death in 1922. However, sometime in the following decades, Dastur Minocher's family moved, along with the manuscript collection, to Calcutta. The collection was brought back to Bombay by Dastur Kaikhusroo M. JamaspAsa in the 1980s and is now held in a separate cabinet at the K.R. Cama Oriental Institute in that city. Likely because of this move, a number of manuscriptshave gone missing. Though listed in the catalog, they are nowhere to be found in the current collection. During my field research in Bombay in 2010, I conducted extensive searches for AK2 and consulted Dastur Kaikhusroo and Ervad Parvez Bajan, who compiled a new catalogof Dastur Kaikhusroo's manuscripts in the 1990s. After these investigations, it is certain that AK2 is missing, perhaps destroyed. While further research in Calcutta, which I was not able to visit during my time in India, may yet bear fruit, at the moment, without access to the man-uscripts, the best available text of the ŠGW's critique of Judaism is Jamsap-Asana and West's edition. The Critique of Judaism? Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen Between Judaism and IslamWe can now turn to the critique itself. As mentioned above, the critique takes up Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen of the ŠGW. Like the other polemical sections of the ŠGW, the critique of Judaism is comprised of statements of Jewish belief and doctrine and Mardān-farrox's critique of those statements. Other chapters identify the doctrinal statements as coming from various sources: from oral communication by native, for example Muslim, informants; from written texts; or from an unidentified source.95 However, Chapters Thirteenand Fourteen are entirely devoted to the citation and critique of a text called the naxustīn niβǝ̄, meaning \"First Scripture,\" \"First Writing,\" or even \"First Book.\" The citations drawn from the First Scripture, as I will refer to it henceforth, include short passages, describing God's nature and characteristics, and longer narratives. Mardānfarrox, in his reading of these citations, highlights the contradictions between the First Scripture's depictions of God's anger,evil, violence, regret, and ignorance and the monotheistic position, outlined at the beginning of the critique of Islam,96 that God is unique, good, wise, powerful, generous, and merciful. At the end of Chapter Fourteen, Mardānfarrox states the final conclusion that he draws from 95.In Chapter Eleven, for instance, the story of Iblīs is introduced at ŠGW 11:45-77 without reference to any source; the sayings of a certain group are discussed at 11:205; and, as mentioned above, a written text (niβǝ̄)is referred to at 11:248, 11:264, and 11:268.96.ŠGW 11:3-5.- 15 -"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"the presentation of these Jewish sources. From the First Scripture's depictions of the Jewish God's evil characteristics, which are similar to the characteristics of the evil antagonist Ahriman, Mardānfarrox concludes that the Jewish God is none other than Ahriman himself. Mardānfarrox never refers to these chapters as a critique or refutation of Judaism, unlike Chapter Fifteen on Christianity and Sixteen on Manichaesim, both of which explicitly identify the group they attack. Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen are more similar to Chapters Eleven and Twelve. These two chapters seem to comprise a critique of Islam but which also do not identify the object of their polemic. It is tempting, on these grounds, to read the wholesection from Chapters Eleven through Fourteen as a critique of scriptural monotheism that does not distinguish, on account of Mardānfarrox's ignorance or his intentional conflation, between Islam and Judaism. While this might seem like a minor point, the question of how, and if, to distinguish between these two sections of the ŠGW touches on some of the major concerns of this dissertation. For this reason, I will devote some space to addressing the issue. Through the lens of the question of syncretism, I will also describe the contents of these chapters in the ŠGW.According to the syncretic reading, the critique of strict monotheism would be con-trasted with the mixed dualism Mardānfarrox sees in Christianity97 and, finally, the erroneous dualism of Manichaeism. Alternatively, one could argue that the chapters seeming to be about Judaism are, as de Menasce argued is the case with the anti-Jewish polemic in the Third Book of the Dēnkard,98 actually meant as critiques of Islam; the vagueness of the Jewish association of Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen would, according to this reading, make the application of those critiques to Islam that much easier. A further aspect of the critique of Judaism complicates this syncretic approach to these two sections of the ŠGW. As mentioned above, the critique of Judaism is comprised entirely of citations from the First Scripture and Mardānfarrox's interpretation of these cita-tions. As all of the scholars who have studied the ŠGW have noted, each of the citations is similar to a passage or passages known from Jewish literature. Though the degree of similar-ity between a citation and its parallel varies, parallels have been adduced for all the citations.99 Many of the citations are similar to passages from the Hebrew Bible.100 Chapter Thir-teen is taken up entirely with the citation and critique of the story of creation and Adam, Eve, and the serpent familiar from Genesis chapters 1-3.101 Chapter Fourteen contains a number ofshorter citations as well as longer narratives. Among the shorter citations, biblical parallels can be adduced for God's statement of his own vengefulness that is paralleled by passages in Exodus, Deuteronomy and elsewhere; a description of God's terrifying physical form resem-97.ŠGW 15:91-154.98.Jean de Menasce, \"Jews and Judaism in the Third Book of the Dēnkard,\" in K.

Other citations in Chapter Fourteen, however, in particular the longer narratives, are not paralleled by passages in the Bible but rather by texts from rabbinic literature. For exam-ple, the story of God's visit to Abraham in ŠGW 14:40-50, in which several of the motifs are similar to the midrashic expansion of the story of the annunciation of the birth of Isaac in Genesis 18;102 the account of the suffering saint and his wife in ŠGW 14:58-70 which resem-bles two stories about poor sages from Babylonian Talmud tractate Taanit; and a pair of cita-tions describing God's abuse and violence against the angels which resemble angelological discussions from Babylonian Talmud tractate Hagigah.103 However, parallels for all of these citations can also be found in Islamic literature. For example, a parallel to the story of temptation in the garden cited in Chapter Thirteen is found also in the Qurʾān 7:10-25 and expanded on in Islamic commentary literature.104 Simi-larly, the story of Abraham's hospitality cited in Chapter Fourteen is paralleled in several Qurʾān passages (11:69-76; 15:51-9; 29:31; and 51:24-30) and likewise discussed at length inthe commentary literature.105 The citations depicting divine violence against angels from Chapter Fourteen also have parallels in Islamic texts.Aside from these Islamic parallels, the separate Jewish identity of Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen is called into question by the fact that, for all that the citations parallel passages in Jewish literature, the hierarchy of authority and distinction between texts that is a crucial part of that literature is not maintained. In other words, in his discussion of the citations Mardānfarrox does not maintain the distinction between the Bible and rabbinic literature, between the written and the oral law. The discussion in Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen treatsthe citations not only as if they all had equal status but also as if they were contained in the same book, the First Scripture. Citations that are paralleled by passages in the Bible sit next from and are undistinguished from citations that are paralleled by passages in the Babylonian Talmud. This lack of distinction is also found in some early Islamic critiques of Judaism.106 In addition to his arguments and the citations, Mardānfarrox also makes certain explicit statements about Jews and the First Scripture in these two chapters. The contents of these statements are also paralleled in Islamic sources. In the introduction to Chapter Thir-teen at 13:1-4, Mardānfarrox refers to the First Scripture having been given by God to Moses.While this is, of course, parallel with the role of Moses as prophet and lawgiver in Jewish lit-erature—among other texts, the revelation of the Law to Moses is recounted in the Bible in the book of Exodus—this same motif of the revelation of a book to Moses is also found in theQurʾān107 and explicated in the early commentaries.

Discussions of the Jewish observance of the Sabbath are likewise found in Islamic sources.109I could continue cataloguing the Jewish and Islamic parallels to ŠGW Chapters Thir-teen and Fourteen. However, merely listing parallels ignores an important distinction that will help answer the question of the ŠGW's Islamic-Jewish syncretism and is a central con-cern of this dissertation. This is the distinction between the sources of the citations in these two chapters of the ŠGW and their literary character. The existence of Islamic or Jewish (or other) parallels to the citations, arguments, and other statements in Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen does not determine the object of the critique or the author's method of argument. The difference between ŠGW Chapters Eleven and Twelve on the one hand and Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen on the other can only be determined by the literary character of the text itself and not by extra-textual factors. In other words, where the critique in these chap-ters (seems to) come from has not much to say about what it is.On these grounds, there are elements of the literary character of the critique in Chap-ters Thirteen and Fourteen that justify distinguishing it from the preceding two chapters and treating the two as different polemics aimed at different objects. In arguing that the two sec-tions should be distinguished I do not mean to imply that there is an impermeable boundary between Chapters Eleven and Twelve on the one hand and Thirteen and Fourteen on the other. The approach of this dissertation is based on the idea that they are connected, in so far as both sections serve the larger polemical, theological, and literary goals of the ŠGW as a whole. However, like the chapters devoted to Manichaeism and Christianity, connected is notthe same as indistinguishable or aimed at the same object.First of all, Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen are distinguished as a separate unit by indicators in the text itself. Chapter Twelve ends with a coda stating that the chapter or sec-tion (dar) is finished (šihast)110 and Chapter Thirteen opens with and introduces a new topic, that of the First Scripture. The first word of Chapter Thirteen, Pazand diṯ, meaning \"again,\" \"then\" or \"further,\"111 is translated appropriately by de Menasce as de nouveau112 to mark the 107.Qurʾān 2:53, which states that Moses received kitāb and furqān.

Chapter Fourteen opens with a reference to the contents of the same First Scripture (niβǝ̄) that is the topic in Chapter Thirteen113 and ends with a conclusion that summarizes the critiques of the citations that had come before. This is the coda, men-tioned above, identifying the God depicted in the citations with Ahriman, the Evil Spirit.114 The final verse of the chapter states that it is completed (buṇdaa).115 The style of the two sections also distinguishes one from the other. Chapters Eleven and Twelve attack many of the same points which are raised in Chapters Thirteen and Four-teen. Both set out to prove the unsuitability of the monotheistic position and the first section states explicitly that it is addressing those who claim that one God is the author of both good and evil.116 What distinguishes the two is style. Chapters Eleven and Twelve present argu-ments against a range of monotheistic beliefs drawn from a variety of sources, some of whichare indicated and some of which remain anonymous. Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen, on the other hand, are focused on the First Scripture. Though many of the same objections to the monotheistic position are raised, such as the one God's responsibility for both good and evil, in Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen these objections are couched as interpretations of the cita-tions in the First Scripture.The question of style is connected to a further issue. This is the different objects of the two sections. As mentioned above, Chapters Eleven and Twelve are devoted to raising objections to monotheistic theology; as de Menasce has pointed out in his notes to these two chapters, much of the theology that is discussed has parallels in contemporary Islamic theo-logical writings.117 The object of chapters Thirteen and Fourteen, in contrast, is the First Scripture and the depictions of the one God found therein.This raises, however, a further question. Is the critique of the First Scripture an end inof itself or is the critique of the First Scripture a means of critiquing Judaism? Are Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen, like the other polemical chapters of the ŠGW, directed against a rival faith or is the object of their critique the book itself?While I hope to have demonstrated that Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen do constitute a separate section distinguished from the polemic in the two preceding chapters of the ŠGW, the true object of the polemic in Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen is difficult to determine. On the one hand, Jews are mentioned as Sabbath observers in Chapter Thirteen. Jews and Judaism are also mentioned in Chapter Fifteen's critique of Christianity. ŠGW 15:5 refers to Jerusalem as the country of the Jews (dǝh ǝž ham zuhūdą) and 15:76 to the Christians' claim that the Jews were responsible for Jesus' death. This same theme returns in 15:119, when Jesus is quoted as saying that the Jews come from the race of Abraham, who was himself a murderer—a reference to the story of the near sacrifice of Isaac from Genesis 21.118 At the end of the chapter at 15:141, he quotes Jesus as calling the Jews serpents of Mount Judah, or, perhaps, the Jewish mountain119 and refers to the law (dāṯ) of Moses.120 Finally, the polemics 113.ŠGW 14:1.114.ŠGW 14:82-86.115.ŠGW 14:87.116.ŠGW 11:3-5.117.De Menasce, Apologétique, 121-73.118.vaš īṇca guft ku dānom ku šumā ǝž tuxm i abrāhīm hǝ̄ṯ ą i ǝž pǝ̄š mardum aβazaṯ būṯ.

In this light, the critique in Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen focuses on the First Scripture, implicitly connected with Jews through its ascription to Moses, as a means to attack the reli-gion that holds this scripture as its most sacred inheritance.On the other hand, the First Scripture is never explicitly identified as the scripture of the Jews and the references to Jews and Judaism in the critique of Christianity need not be connected in this way with the citations in the earlier chapters. Furthermore, critiques of the Old Testament as such were well known in this period and, possibly, also known to Mardān-farrox. As I will discuss further in the body of the dissertation itself and as other scholars have pointed out, Mardānfarrox's critique of the First Scripture is very similar to the third century dualist Christian Marcion of Sinope's critique of the Old Testament. Some of Mardānfarrox's near contemporaries, such as the ninth century Jewish rationalist Ḥīwī al-Balkhī,122 who wrote his own critique listing the contradictions contained in the Hebrew Bible, and his contemporary Abū ʿĪsā al-Warrāq, have been identified by scholars as Marcionites.123 Abū ʿĪsā has also been identified by others as a Manichaean,124 as have other promi-nent writers and theologians such as the eighth century translator Abū Muḥammad ʿAbd-Allāh Rōzbeh ibn al-Muqaffāʿ125 or the ninth century Abū al-Ḥusayn Aḥmad b. Yaḥyā b. Isḥāq al-Rāwandi.126 Manichaeans, like Marcionites, engaged in critiques of the Bible that resemble Mardānfarrox's; some of the evidence for Manichaean critiques is found in St. Augustine of Hippo's refutations of their arguments.127 Werner Sundermann has argued that Mardānfarrox demonstrates good knowledge of Manichaean theology and terminology.128 Given this connection, it could be argued that Mardānfarrox wrote Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen of the ŠGW as a critique of the Old Testament after a Manichaean model.While evidence can be adduced for both sides of this argument, in the end the precise object of the ŠGW's critique in these two chapters can remain unresolved. In any case, the two options are not diametrically opposed. When critiquing Jews and Judaism, it would seem impossible to avoid the issue of the scripture that the Jews hold dear, just as when cri-tiquing the Old Testament one cannot but refer to the people who revere that text.

I will expand on this methodology in more detail below. First, however, I will discuss earlier scholars' approaches to the ŠGW and the critique of Judaism.Previous studies of the ŠGW's critique of Judaism share a common feature. What all these studies have in common is their concentration on the critique of Judaism as a link to a universe outside the text and outside Zoroastrianism. Scholars have been interested, almost exclusively, in the sources of the critique of Judaism, to the exclusion of discussions of the content of the critique itself, its theological stake, and literary structure. Previous scholarship on the critique of Judaism falls generally into two types: transla-tions of the text and studies of its content. However, as most translations that include discus-sions of content and studies also include original translation, both types will be considered together. Aside from general discussions of the critique of Judaism in surveys of Pahlavi lit-erature,129 we can begin with the work of Edward William West. Even before publishing his critical edition of the ŠGW, West produced an English translation of the entire book, includ-ing, of course, Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen, for the series Sacred Books of the East.130 West notes some of the parallel passages for the citations in the critique noted above but, on the whole, his translation has been surpassed by later work.Only two years after the publication of the Jamasp-Asana and West edition, James Darmesteter produced a translation of the critique of Judaism as part one of a two-part article on Pahlavi texts that refer to Judaism.131 Much more familiar with Jewish literature than West, Darmesteter notes a number of parallels between the citations in the ŠGW and rabbinic literature. In his introduction he raises the possibility that Mardānfarrox had access to a Pahlavi translation of the Bible,132 a theme that recurs in the scholarship on the ŠGW. How-ever, Darmesteter refrains from an analysis of the text.Building on Darmesteter's work, in 1906 Louis Gray published an article on the refer-ences to Judaism in Pahlavi literature which devotes considerable space to the ŠGW.133 Gray 129.West, \"Literature\", 106-107; Tavadia, Die mittelpersische Sprache und Literatur, 92-97; Boyce, \"Literature,\" 46-47; de Menasce, \"Literature after the Conquest,\" 561-65; Cereti, La letteratura pahlavi, 85;Macuch, \"Pahlavi Literature,\" 149-50. I have also not included in this survey a few of the additional works which, being mainly derivative of the texts discussed, do not add new insights. Among these are Sadeq Hedayat, Gozareš-e gomān šekan (Tehran: 1943), a Persian translation by the modern novelist; Parvin Shakiba, Gozareš-e gomān šekan : šarḥ va tarjumah-e matn-e Pāzand 'Škand Gumānīg Wizār': asar-e Mardān Farrukh pisar-e Urmazddād (Champaign, IL: 2001), a recent Persian translation; and Bāghbidi, \"Linguistic Peculiarities\" which reproduces West's English translation.130.Edward William West, ed. and trans., Dînâ-î Maînôg-î Khirad, Sikand-Gûmânîk Vigâr, Sad Dar Pahlavi, part 3 of Pahlavi Texts, vol. 24 of Sacred Books of the East, ed.

As proof, Gray cites thedifferences between the ŠGW's citations and their supposed parallels, in particular in the verses parallel to sources in Genesis. On the basis of the ŠGW's statement that the serpent was punished by having his feet cut off, a Midrash also attested in the Aramaic targum,134 Gray concludes that Mardānfarrox was working from a source ultimately derived from the Aramaic translation. Gray also mentions the parallels between the longer narratives in Chap-ter Fourteen and rabbinic literature.The critical edition and translation of the ŠGW by Jean de Menasce, which serves as the current standard, includes a new translation, introduction, and notes to the critique of Judaism. De Menasce, born and raised in a Jewish family in Alexandria and active in the Zionist movement before converting to Catholicism in 1926,135 brings his knowledge of Judaism and Islam to bear on these chapters of the ŠGW. In his introduction to Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen,136 de Menasce situates the critique of Judaism within the relevant his-torical and literary contexts; in these few pages, he establishes the guidelines for subsequent research on the ŠGW's critique, including this dissertation. First, de Menasce places the cri-tique of Judaism in the context of the history of Jews in the Sasanian period, polemics againstJudaism from other Pahlavi texts137—including the Dēnkard, sections of which were trans-lated previously by Darmesteter—and Judeo-Persian literature, which de Menasce speculates might have existed already under the Sasanians.138 De Menasce then discusses the possibilityof Sasanian Pahlavi translations of the Bible,139 the citations' resemblance to Aramaic and 133.Louis H.

Among the documents discovered near the oasis of Turfan in present-day Chinese Turkestan is a Christian translation into Pahlavi of the Syriac version of Psalms, dated to the sixth or seventh century.

De Menasce summarizes the preceding discus-sion with the statement that, given the various possible means of transmission of Jewish material, it is impossible to identify the immediate sources of the citations in Mardānfarrox's critique; as we shall see, this cogent observation has been passed over by later scholarship. Finally, de Menasce turns to the potential repercussions of the ŠGW's critique on Judaism, in particular that of Ḥīwī al-Balkhī.In his notes, de Menasce adheres to the program laid out in his introduction. In addi-tion to philological comments on the text itself, he not only records parallels to the citations found in Jewish literature, reproducing most of the references noted by Darmesteter, but also provides references to parallel passages in Christian, Islamic, and Manichaean literature. Jacob Neusner's translation and notes on the critique of Judaism have been published twice. The first study140 includes a new English translation, based largely on de Menasce and prepared, as Neusner states, in consultation with Richard Frye of Harvard University. The translation includes some philological notes, in particular on the word ažāṯ that Mardānfarroxclaims is the name of the Jewish scripture.141 As Shaul Shaked remarked, several of Neusner's suggestions \"cannot be commended as a model of erudition.\"142 In addition, Neusner includes in his notes references to parallels to the citations in the Bible and rabbinic literature, adding and emending the suggestions made by Darmesteter, Gray, and de Menasce.The usefulness of Neusner's work, however, lies not in his philological contributions—trained as a historian of Judaism, his mistakes in Iranian philology are not surprising—but in that he is the first scholar to seriously consider the structure of Mardānfarrox's arguments. In an appendix to his article, referred to as the \"exposition,\" Neusner repeats Mardānfarrox's arguments against Judaism step by step. However, Neusner does not address the question of the underlying structure of the critique of Judaism, its literary characteristics or its connectionto the rest of the ŠGW. The only exception is a passing mention to the fact that while Chap-ter Thirteen is focused on \"the metaphysical foundations of Judaism,\" Chapter Fourteen sets out to prove the connection between Judaism and Ahriman.143 Neusner, however, does not develop this insight further. In an article that appeared three years later,144 Neusner argues forthe existence, based on the evidence of rabbinic literature, for a Pahlavi Bible translation that might have been available to Mardānfarrox and provides further Talmudic parallels to the ŠGW's angelic citations. These two articles were combined and republished as an appendix to Neusner's History of the Jews in Babylonia.145Shaul Shaked refers briefly to the ŠGW in an article mentioned above on Zoroastrian anti-Jewish polemics. While mostly focusing on the Dēnkard, Shaked devotes one paragraphto the ŠGW. He states that, unlike most Pahlavi polemical literature, which place Judaism 119-25 (Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1991).140.Jacob Neusner, \"A Zoroastrian Critique of Judaism,\" Journal of the American Oriental Society 83 (1963): 283-94.141.See ŠGW 13:2 and the discussion in the notes to my translation in Appendix One.142.Shaul Shaked, \"Zoroastrian Polemics against Jews in the Sasanian and Early Islamic Periods,\" in Irano-Judaica II, ed.

Not only does the text itself explicitly say that it is responding to a written work (the First Scripture) but, as I hope to show, the critique of Judaism is certainly enmeshed within the ŠGW's conceptual framework.Dan Shapira presented an interesting new perspective on the ŠGW in a 2001 article.147He provides new translations and philological analysis of selected passages, which, for the sake of convenience, he renders in Pahlavi transcription. Focusing on the account of hexam-eral creation (13:5-14) and God's declaration of his vengefulness (14:5-8), Shapira compares these citations with their biblical parallels in Hebrew as well as in Aramaic and Greek transla-tion. He also discusses the versions found in Judeo-Persian Bible translations. Based on these comparisons, Shapira concludes that Mardānfarrox likely did use a Middle Persian translation of the Bible in his critique of Judaism and, furthermore, that there is continuity between the language of the citations in the ŠGW and translations of parallel passages in laterJudeo-Persian Bibles. Though I disagree with Shapira's conclusions regarding the existence of a Middle Persian Bible as the basis for the ŠGW, I will make use of Shapira's philological insights.In addition to these discussions of the critique itself, which on the whole focus on the question of the ŠGW's relation to earlier Jewish literature, other scholars have examined the relationship between the ŠGW and later texts. David Halperin and Gordon Newby have explored the ŠGW's relationship to statements attributed to Jewish converts to Islam in hadithliterature.148 Specifically, they focus on a citation at ŠGW 14:39 attributed to an unnamed group (han grōhǝ̄) that at the end of days God will cast the sun and moon to Hell because they were worshiped by human beings. While there are several passages in rabbinic literaturewhich express similar sentiments,149 the closest parallel is a tradition attributed to Kaʿb al-ʾAḥbār, an early Jewish convert to Islam,150 included in Muḥammad ibn Jarīr al-Ṭabarī's uni-versal history.151 In the tradition, an anonymous informant told Ibn ʿAbbās, another early 146.Shaked, \"Zoroastrian Polemics,\" 87.147.Dan Shapira, \"On Biblical Quotations in Pahlavi,\" Henoch 23 (2001): 175-83.148.On this Islamic genre, see G.

Ibn ʿAbbās vehemently rejects this notion and identifies Kaʿb's statement as Jewish.152 Rather than arguing that the ŠGW is dependent on the Islamic text or vice-versa, Halperin and Newby argue that both texts are drawing from a non-rabbinic Jewishsource. They go on to argue that this source is \"akin, if not identical, to that which produced the Enoch literature.\"153 Essentially, the ŠGW serves here as an independent confirmation of the Jewish origin of Kaʿb's statement. Other scholars have connected the ŠGW's critique of Judaism to the writing of the Jewish rationalist Ḥīwī al-Balkhī.154 A ninth century contemporary of Mardānfarrox, he com-posed a list of two hundred contradictions and inconsistencies in the Bible. The list, which is lost but for a small fragment recovered from the Cairo Geniza,155 was refuted by the rabbinic authority and philosopher Saadia Gaon (c. 882-942) as well as by other scholars, both Karaiteand Rabbanite.156 From the polemics against him, Judah Rosenthal reconstructed the contentsof Ḥīwī's polemic and noted a number of parallels between his and the ŠGW's critiques.157 Onthis basis of these parallels and allusions in later Jewish writers, Rosenthal raises the possibil-ity that the ŠGW could be the source of Ḥīwī's critiques. However, Rosenthal also notes that the ŠGW, Ḥīwī, Islamic rationalists, and others who criticized Jewish theology and the Hebrew Bible in particular were drawing on earlier \"gnostic\"158 critiques. Rosenthal's and others' reference to the earlier roots of Ḥīwī's critiques and the ŠGW are instructive in interpreting the theological genealogy of the critique of Judaism.159 How-ever, from a methodological standpoint, this study too locates the true source or meaning of the critique of Judaism outside the text itself. While Rosenthal, like Halperin and Newby, locate the origins of ŠGW in later texts, like the other studies mentioned above they are con-centrated on the sources of the critique of Judaism. Especially in their reading of the cita-tions, previous scholars have seen these passages as essentially alien elements in the ŠGW; their project is locating the citations' true context, elsewhere. That elsewhere is variously identified, depending on the citation and the scholar's perspective, as the Hebrew Bible, rab-binic literature, Early Judeo-Persian translations, Islamic or Christian treatises, or Enochic mystical tracts. Rosenthal's discussion of Ḥīwī locates Mardānfarrox's critique itself else-where, in anti-Jewish writings from late antiquity and before; nothing, as he says was forgot-ten or lost.

Critique, Citation, ContextThis dissertation takes a new approach to the critique of Judaism, engaging in a read-ing of the critique of Judaism that emphasizes the connections between the critique and its immediate context. I will argue that both the citations from the First Scripture and Mardān-farrox's arguments against those citations should be understood in light of the larger polemi-cal, theological, and literary goals of the ŠGW as a whole.This argument will proceed on two fronts. First of all, I will engage with the questionof the ŠGW's relationship to Jewish literature. Previous scholars have seen in the parallels between the citations in the critique of Judaism and passages from the Bible and rabbinic lit-erature evidence of Mardānfarrox's borrowing from these Jewish works. In this dissertation, I will employ a new methodological paradigm, that of Michel Foucault's concept of geneal-ogy. As I will discuss in more detail in Chapter Two, in Foucault's formulation, genealogy argues for inverting the model of influence, according to which one event or phenomenon—in this case one body of literature—has multiple effects or outcomes. A genealogical approach instead seeks to investigate the multiple determining elements, the ancestors, of anyparticular event or, as here, any particular text.160 A genealogical approach has been applied fruitfully to a similar problem, that of the relationship between the Qurʾān and Jewish litera-ture, and I will draw on the insights of scholars in that field.This genealogical approach will serve my overall argument, articulated most compre-hensively in Chapters Two and Three, that the ŠGW's critique of Judaism does not draw solely or directly on Jewish sources but rather on a wider, probably oral nexus of traditions about the biblical patriarchs and the Children of Israel. Decoupling the citations in the cri-tique of Judaism from their parallels in Jewish literature opens the possibility for reading the citations in their context in the ŠGW. The quotation of or allusion to a specific text is not mutually exclusive, of course, with the contextualization of those allusions. In other words, one can imagine that the ŠGW's citations could be both copied or borrowed from the Hebrew Bible, for example, as well as molded to fit the ŠGW's own context and concerns. However, emphasizing the multiple and unrecoverable determining elements that lie behind the critiqueof Judaism's citations, in addition to presenting a more nuanced model of the relationship between Jewish literature and those citations, means that the best context for interpreting the critique of Judaism is in its context in the ŠGW itself.This new approach to the ŠGW's sources is signaled by the term I have chosen for thepassages from the First Scripture that appear in the critique of Judaism: citation. This term, which I will use to refer to these passages from the First Scripture throughout this disserta-160.For Foucault's best evaluation of his own methodology, see Michel Foucault,\"Nietzsche, Genealogy, History,\" in Language, Counter-Memory, Practice: Selected Essays and Interviews, ed.

Even as citation marks a connection between two texts, literary theorists have also identified the disjunctive functions of citation. Citation, these theorists have argued, is a process of alienation. By transplanting a section of a text to a new context, the original meaning of that passage is unsettled. While the passage in question gains a new meaning in its new context, this process of decontextualization and recontextualization is an inherent part of the process of citation.161 In referring to the critique of Judaism's passages in the ŠGW as \"citations,\" I am evoking this process.If the objective of the first front of this dissertation is demonstrating a more nuanced connection between Jewish literature and the ŠGW than that which previous scholars have seen, the objective of the second front is demonstrating the critique of Judaism's contextual-ization within the ŠGW. My main method of demonstrating this contextualization is pointingout literary connections between citations within the critique of Judaism and between the cri-tique of Judaism and the rest of the ŠGW. I will do so through an examination of recurring motifs in the ŠGW. Borrowing the convenient definition of William Freedman, a motif can be a recurring theme, character, or verbal pattern within a literary work, or an \"associational cluster of literal or figurative references to a given class of concepts or objects;\"162 for exam-ple, animals, machines, music, etc. A motif is generally symbolic, carrying a meaning beyond its apparent or literal sense, and it requires a minimal frequency of repetition and improbability of appearance to make its presence felt, at least subconsciously.163As I hope to demonstrate in the arguments that make up the body of this dissertation, the motifs I identify in the ŠGW fit the definition outlined above. The motifs I will discuss are distinguished by their recurring on three different orders of magnitude. Chapter Three concerns a motif of angels that connects three of the citations in the critique of Judaism. Chapter Four focuses on a motif of gardens that is found in citations in the critiques of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, as well as in the apologetic exposition of Zoroastrian theol-ogy in the first half of the ŠGW. The final motif, discussed in Chapter Five, is the motif of the sacred text as a source of authority. This motif, of which all of the citations in the critiqueof Judaism have a part, is connected with Mardānfarrox's numerous references to the Dēnkard as an authoritative text that shaped his own theology and spiritual identity. My goal in identifying and analyzing these motifs is not only to point to the connection between the citations in the critique of Judaism and the rest of the ŠGW. I also aim to show how these recurring motifs buttress the ŠGW's explicit theological arguments for Zoroastrianism and against monotheism and the First Scripture. This method of reading a theological or philosophical text for its literary texture and understanding the theological or philosophical important of that texture is borrowed from studies of Plato's dialogues, in particular the Republic. The study of the philosophical import of the literary elements in Plato's work—the introduction in which Socrates describes going down from Athens to Piraeus, the port, where he meets Adeimantus and Glaucon (327a-328b); the character of these and the other interlocutors with whom Socrates conducts 161.See especially Georgio Agamben, The Man Without Content, trans.

Strauss argues that these and other literary features of the Republic are not window dressing or background color but crucial information in interpreting the dialogue and unearthing Plato's intention.164 In the context of Strauss' reading of Plato (and others), \"unearthing\" is an appropriate term. As Strauss lays out most explicitly elsewhere, he understands Plato to be what G. R. F. Fer-rari calls a \"politic philosopher.\"165 Wary of the damage that his true theories might cause to aless than sufficiently intelligent and subtle reader—not to mention what Plato himself might suffer, like Socrates, were the authorities to discover his true notions—Strauss argues that philosophers like Plato hid their real intentions in such a way that only the most careful and dedicated readers, philosophers themselves, could discover them.166Strauss' theories have been both influential and contentious in the scholarship on Plato's dialogues. One of their effects, though, has been to lead scholars to explore the connection between the literary and philosophical aspects of his work. My own method of reading the connection between—in the ŠGW's case—theological argument and literary structure is influenced in particular by the work of David K. O'Connor. In an article includedin the Cambridge Companion to Plato's Republic, O'Connor demonstrates how Plato recasts two well-known myths in the Republic: Homer's account of Odysseus' descent to the under-world in Odyssey Book 11 and Hesiod's story of Cronus and the races of metals in Works and Days 109-201. In the case of the descent to the underworld, O'Connor identifies widely sepa-rated references to the motif of descent and ascent, including the famous analogy of the cave (514a-518c) and the account of Socrates' descent to the Piraeus that opens the book. He argues that these instances of the motif are linked to the mythic substrate through shared key terms, common elements and references to Homer's text. O'Connor puts these allusions to the myth in dialogue with, among other themes, the Republic's explicit denouncement of poetry and the banishing of poets from the ideal city (376d-398b).167In the case of the ŠGW, my goal in exploring the interplay between literary form and theological argument is not to expose the complex relationship between Mardānfarrox's explicit statements and his form. Though this too is a worthy aim, in this dissertation I have amuch more modest objective: to show the underlying unity of what seems on the surface to be a divided text. Mardānfarrox gives no justification for why the citations in the critique of Judaism appear in the order they do or what logic justifies certain passages being the objects of critique as opposed to others. The same is true, on a larger scale, of the various polemical chapters. The ŠGW never explains the relationship among the different polemics nor between the polemics and the apologetics at the beginning of the book. These motifs show the underlying connection between these various parts of the work.In this focus on the literary character of the ŠGW's critique of Judaism, I am not denying that the critique is rooted in some historical reality of engagement between Jews and Zoroastrians. However, I see this engagement not on the level of Mardānfarrox's reading of texts but on the level of the construction of what Jeremy Cohen referred to in the Christian 164.Leo Strauss, The City and Man (Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1964), 50-139. 165.G.

In the case of Christianity, encounters between communities of Jews and Christians occurred throughout late antiquity and the EarlyMiddle Ages.169 In the case of Zoroastrianism, though, the encounter is less dramatic and lessdefining. Jews living in Mesopotamia were ruled by and lived with people practicing some form of the Iranian religion for thousands of years. As recent research has shown, the Baby-lonian Talmud provides evidence of especially close connections between Jews and Zoroas-trians during the Sasanian period.170 The Talmud evinces connections between the rabbinic community and Zoroastrianism on the levels of language, law, hermeneutics, theology, and culture. This longstanding encounter, the possibility of coming to know Jews and their reli-gion, underlies Pahlavi literature's anti-Jewish tradition centuries after the disappearance of the social setting in which it flourished. The image of the hermeneutical Jew, which entailed descriptions of Jewish practices, citations or pseudo-citations of their texts, and collective memories of Jews' roles in Iranian national history—all of which are alluded to in various Pahlavi texts—had already been fixed in the Zoroastrian constellation, as one of the dark stars against which Zoroastrianism oriented itself. Within the limited scope of the ŠGW, this dissertation will show how Judaism and its critique integrate with Zoroastrian theology.Outline of the ChaptersChapter Two will further address in more detail the question of influence and the scholarly search for the origins of the citations in the critique of Judaism in Jewish literature. Focusing on a citation in ŠGW 14:40-50 that parallels the annunciation of the birth of Isaac in Genesis 18, the chapter will analyze the two midrashic passages scholars have identified asthe sources of the citation. After first questioning the search for origins in general on methodological and historical grounds, the chapter will demonstrate that while the ŠGW's citation and the passages from the Midrash are similar on the surface, the differences betweenthem are significant enough to cast doubt on the theory that Mardānfarrox drew on these pas-sages directly or indirectly. Instead of a search for origins, the chapter advocates a genealogi-cal approach and proposes four alternate elements of the genealogy of the citation, drawn from Islamic, Manichaean, Mandaean, and Armenian traditions.Chapter Three continues the critique of origins begun in Chapter Two. However, rather than addressing Jewish literature in general as the source of the ŠGW's citations, the chapter focuses on the connection between the ŠGW and the Babylonian Talmud. Recent scholarship has demonstrated the connection between rabbinic Judaism and Zoroastrianism inthe Sasanian period. Taking this closeness as a starting point, the chapter considers three angelic citations that are all closely paralleled by passages in the Babylonian Talmud. After demonstrating that the ŠGW citations depict angels as weaker and more oppressed than their rabbinic parallels, the chapter sets these portrayals of weakened angels in the context of the widespread belief in an angelic coequal to the divine among Jews in late antiquity and the 168.Jeremy Cohen, Living Letters of the Law (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999), 2.169.I do not mean to imply that the boundaries between Jews and Christians were fixed already during the life of Jesus.

The chapter argues that the ŠGW's depiction of downtrodden angels is not borrowed from rabbinic polemics against \"two powers in heaven\" theology, but from the ŠGW's theological imperative to portray Judaism as radically monotheistic and thus the binary opposite of Zoroastrianism.While Chapter Three investigates a motif that links a number of citations in the cri-tique, Chapter Four discusses a more widespread motif of gardens that can be found in the polemics against Islam, Christianity, and Judaism, as well as in an exposition of Zoroastrian theology in the first half of the ŠGW. The chapter first identifies these garden passages, demonstrates the connections between them and discusses how a single narrative underlies allthe linked passages. The chapter then turns to the question of why gardens served as a fruit-ful site to demonstrate the errors of monotheism. The chapter proposes that the role of gar-dens in Iranian culture, as symbols for justice, order, rule, and royal power, underlies the rev-ersal of the garden in the polemical chapters.Chapter Five considers the critique of Judaism's relationship to another Pahlavi text. This is the Third Book of the Dēnkard, in particular the passages polemicizing against Judaism in that work. The chapter first discusses the many connections between the ŠGW and the Dēnkard in general, chief among them that the ŠGW refers to the Dēnkard as its explicit source. Next, the chapter compares the two critiques of Judaism. While the two cri-tiques are similar on many points, the chapter identifies a fundamental difference between them: whereas the Dēnkard attacks Judaism as a religion, the object of the ŠGW's critique is the Jewish text, the First Scripture. The chapter considers some of the epistemological and literary implications of this transformation of Judaism into a written text. The chapter argues that the ŠGW constructs the object of its critique as a written text in order to match the textu-ality of Zoroastrianism itself in Mardānfarrox's work.The dissertation concludes with three appendixes.

IfMardānfarrox is critiquing a Jewish text, then it would seem obvious to assume that he some-how had access to Jewish texts; uncovering his sources would then be a task of perusing the Bible and rabbinic literature to find the similar, original passages Mardānfarrox must have read or heard. As discussed in the introduction, in previous studies of the ŠGW's critique of Judaism most effort and ingenuity has been put into a secondary and subsequent project, namely speculating about the means by which the stories and maxims (once identified) trav-eled from their Jewish origins to the Zoroastrian polemic. Scholars have postulated, for example, the existence of Sasanian Judeo-Persian or Pahlavi Bible translations1 and the preservation of Sasanian era court polemics against Judaism.2 However, the aspect of the citations which this approach takes to be the simplest, theirJewish origin, is, actually, the most complex. The citations, both those which parallel biblicalpassages and those similar to texts from rabbinic literature, need not necessarily relate—directly, ultimately, or through some intermediary—to either of these canonical Jewish works.As I will attempt to demonstrate in this chapter, the scholarly presumption of the citations' dependence on or influence by these Jewish works is, at best, inconclusive. I hope to prove this point through a reading of one of the longer citations, the story of Ādīnō's hospitable visitto Abrāhīm3 at ŠGW 14:40-50. In my examination of the passage I will identify some of the alternate traditions with which this story might be in conversation.My point here is not to deny that the ŠGW could or might be related to the biblical and rabbinic sources that have come down to us. I also am not interested in replacing one textual origin with another, for instance, the Babylonian Talmud with Ṭabarī's Tafsir. Rather,my argument is that the search for origins itself is, in the case of the ŠGW's critique of Judaism, a misguided endeavor. The Bible and Midrash make up two of the many potential sources—both oral and written, known and unknown—of the stories and statements in the ŠGW's critique. Ultimately, my goal in this chapter is to justify an interrogation of the cita-tions which dispenses with the question of origins; I am interested in the critique of Judaism not as a copy of an absent original but in its own context within the literary and theological circumference of Mardānfarrox's work.1.Shapira, \"Biblical Quotations.\"2.Neusner, History, 5:403; following Geo Widengren,\"The Status of the Jews in the Sasanian Empire,\" Iranica Antiqua 1 (1961): 160.3.In what follows I will distinguish between the citation from the ŠGW and parallel versions of this narrative through the use of different names. Abrāhīm, as the name appears in the ŠGW citation, will be used in reference to the ŠGW's account while Abraham will be used in reference to Jewish and Islamic parallels. The forms of the name Abraham which appear in Pahlavi literature (see de Menasce, Apologétique, 225) resemble the Arabic ʾIbrāhīm rather than Hebrew ʾAvraham. According to Josef Horovitz, \"Jewish Proper Names and Derivatives in the Koran,\" HUCA 2 (1925): 160 suggests that Arabic ʾIbrāhīm was formed on the basis of comparison with Ismāʿil.- 31 -"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"As mentioned above, I will demonstrate this point through a close reading of the storyof Abrāhīm's hospitality. After first considering the biblical and rabbinic passages scholars have identified as the sources of the citation, I will compare the citation with four parallels found outside Jewish literature. Motifs and characters central to the story of Abrāhīm's hos-pitality can also be found in Islamic, Manichaean, Mandaic, and Armenian texts. I will con-sider each of these alternative sources in turn and, finally, return to the question of the unde-cidability of the critique of Judaism' origins.Was hat Mardānfarrox aus dem Judenthume aufgenommen?Before turning to the citation itself, however, I want to take up a parallel and better explored problem which can serve as a methodological guide. For the problem of the rela-tionship between the ŠGW's critique of Judaism and Jewish literature can be profitably com-pared to the connected issue of the supposed Jewish origins of certain sections of the Qurʾān. The Qurʾān contains numerous passages, often referred to in current scholarly discourse as Isrāʾīlliyāt,4 which have parallels in Jewish, especially rabbinic texts. As has been widely discussed and critiqued, the regnant model for most of the history of the academic study of Islam in Europe and the Americas was one of influence. As is case with the ŠGW, scholars were concerned with tracing passages from Qurʾānic and other literature to their Jewish sources, even when those connections were less than self-evident.5 This singular focus on influence vastly underestimated the wealth of biblical traditions at large in late antiquity. As Michael Pregil artfully describes the situation in the context of Islam,the biblical tradition was not primarily manifest as a single work, the \"Hebrew Bible\" or \"Old Testament\" in the sense of a closed and stable canon of written texts (although it was also sometimes this). Rather, when we speak of Late An-tiquity, the period in which Islam emerged, \"Bible\" should evoke the image of a plurality of rich traditions, in multiple languages, oral and written, centering on documents transmitted over the course of a millennium that conveyed the authentic cultural and religious inheritance of ancient Israel, its legacy of monotheism, covenantalism, and prophecy, but that also included a dazzling variety of exegetical traditions that supplemented, supported, amended, and even perhaps at times subverted that legacy. The Torah could certainly be identified as a book per se, but it was much more frequently experienced as a practically fathomless sea of stories by Jews, Christians, Jewish Christians, Manichaeans, and a host of other – sometimes nameless – scriptuaries.64.On the genre of Isrāʾīlliyāt and its place within Islam see S. D. Goitein, \"Isrāʿīliyyāt,\" Tarbiz 6 (1934): 89-101 and 510-22; Kister, \"Early Tradition\"; and Roberto Tottoli, \"Origin and Use of the Term Isrāʾīliyyāt in Muslim Literature,\" Arabica 46 (1999): 193-210 on the changing usage and definition of the term.5.The scholarly literature discussing and critiquing this methodology is considerable. A recent surveys can befound in Shari L. Lowin, The Making of a Forefather: Abraham in Islamic and Jewish Exegetical Narratives (Leiden: Brill, 2006), 27-38 and a wider analysis of the scholarly project of the \"unearthing\" of Islamic origins in Chase Robinson, \"Reconstructing Early Islam: Truth and Consequences,\" in Method and Theory in the Study of Islamic Origins, ed. Herbert Berg (Leiden: Brill, 2003), 101-134.6.Michael E. Pregill, \"The Hebrew Bible and the Quran: the Problem of Jewish \"Influence\" on Islam,\" Religion Compass 1 (2007): 646.- 32 -"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Rephrasing Pregil's statement, we can say that this passage rejects the search for ori-gins. As he rightly notes, there was no single, stable text, no Hebrew Bible, which lay at the root of the tree of interpretation and diffusion. Rather than using an image, such as that of a tree, that implies organized, linear and measurable growth and change, Pregil uses the metaphor of a sea, which is to say a fluid expanse, flowing, dynamic, and expansive. Who can say where the sea begins and ends? The boundaries between stories are fluid, which is tosay that \"the authentic cultural and religious inheritance of Ancient Israel\" has no pride of place over the various other expansion and subversions. At the same time, the boundary between \"scriptuaries\" is just as permeable. Pregil implies that there are no \"authentic\" people just as there are no \"authentic\" traditions.7Pregil's approach—and the methodological perspective which underlies this chapter—can be understood in terms of Michel Foucault's discussion of genealogy. As Foucault argued, the practice of genealogy is to be distinguished by its opposition to the search for ori-gins.8 The search for the origin assumes the existence of eternal, immobile entities, a primor-dial and unchanging truth. The scholar's task, in a this model, is to peel back the layers con-cealing this metaphysical kernel. However, for the genealogist, there is no essence or what we now perceive as essential \"was fabricated in a piecemeal fashion from alien forms.\"9 Fou-cault argues that genealogy ruptures the myth of pristine origins, replacing it with lowly and derisive historical beginnings, with accidents, petty rivalries, and contradictory failures from which values, morality, sexuality, and truths ultimately derive. As he writes,Let us say, roughly, that as opposed to a genesis oriented towards the unity of some principal cause burdened with multiple descendants, what is proposed here is a genealogy, that is, something that attempts to restore the conditions for the appearance of a singularity born out of multiple determining elements of which it is not the product, but rather the effect. A process of making it in-telligible but with the clear understanding that this does not function accordingto any principle of closure.10Foucault's definition of genealogy in the final sentence of the above quotation is a concise statement of the most fruitful method for situating the citations in the ŠGW's critique of Judaism, the method I have attempted to model in this chapter. This chapter's discussion of the various co-texts and parallel traditions, including but by no means limited to the bibli-cal and rabbinic sources previous scholars have championed, should be understood precisely as aimed at making the conditions of the appearance of the ŠGW's story of Abrāhīm's hos-pitality intelligible but without claiming exhaustiveness or closure. As Foucault says, to a genealogist such a claim would be meaningless. 7.The same point is made explicitly in the context of the historiography of Ancient Judaism in Michael Satlow, \"Beyond Influence: Toward a New Historiographic Paradigm,\" in Jewish Literatures and Cultures: Context and Intertext, ed.

The sea of stories Pregil mentions did not dry up with the coming of Islam . On the contrary, by Mardānfarrox's time—as discussed in the introduction, he can be dated around the mid-ninth century—the mixture had become considerably richer. To the factions and traditions he mentions should be added the Qurʾānic narratives in their canonical forms and the various expansions of and deviations from those stories. Moreover, orality remained the dominant vehicle for the trans-mission of tradition. In addition to the research demonstrating the continuity of and esteem for orality within scholastic circles in the early Islamic period in Judaism,11 Islam,12 and Zoroastrianism,13 the fluidity of traditions has been well documented. In the case of Islam and Judaism, for instance, alongside the \"expected\" flow of tradition from the older Judaism to younger Islam, it has also been shown that expansions of narratives about the Patriarchs and the Children of Israel that appeared first within an Islamic context travelled to Jewish midrashic works.14 A particularly enlightening parallel to the ŠGW's critique of Judaism comes from Islamic critiques of the Bible.15 The goal of these Islamic critiques is different than Mardānfarrox's in the ŠGW, as these texts seek to demonstrate, on the one hand, the cor-rupted—and, thus, delegitimizing—transmission of a once pure scripture and, on the other, to11.On the preference for oral transmission and instruction in the Geonic academies, see the discussions in Elman, \"Orality and Redaction\"; Brody, \"Gaonic Literature\"; and, specifically pertaining to the possibility of the oral transmission of aggada, Paul D.

However, as Lazarus-Yafeh has shown, up until the thirteenth century it seems that Muslim authors—with the notable exception of converts from Judaism and Christianity—did not have access to the bib-lical text in its original or in Arabic translation.16 Rather,in the Islamic literature of Tales of the Prophets (Qiṣaṣ al-ʾAnbiyā), which used most extensively Biblical and midrashic materials (Isrāʾīliyyāt), exact literal Bibli-cal quotations are extermely rare. Free and inexact paraphrases usually transmit in this literature (as in the Qurʾān and early Ḥadīth literature) the Biblical, mid-srashic, and other material mixed up together without distinction, perhaps partiallyfollowing an ancient Targum-like (oral?) source. . . Most Muslim authors seem to have relied mainly on oral transmission, and constantly quote as their sources of Biblical information Jews or early Jewish and Christian converts to Islam, like Kaʿb al-Aḥbār and Wahb b. Munabbih. Many Muslim scholars readily admitted to such contact with Jews and Christians in order to elucidate Qurʾānic passages touching on Biblical material, a procedure that was condemned by others. The fact that Jews usually felt no need to differentiate between the Biblical text and later midrashic elaborations on it, and would have found it almost impossible to translate literally the Biblical text alone for their Muslim neighbors, may help to explain the combined material \"quoted\" by Muslim medieval authors.17Whether or not the conversations between Jews and Muslim scholars depicted in this literature reflect more than the rehashing of a trope of the native informant18—which, it should be said, appears in the ŠGW as well19—it is clear that Mardānfarrox's critique is of thesame type as these Muslim texts. There as here, from the perspective of the now closed and mutually distinct canons of Bible and Midrash, the First Scripture in the ŠGW 's critique of Judaism appears to be a hybrid. By hybrid, I mean that citations that look like close parallels of well-known Biblical verses sit alongside and are not distinguished from passages resem-bling texts known from rabbinic literature. In the same time and in the same place, the ŠGW and texts within Islamic literature are constructing \"Jewish\" traditions. Without advocating that Mardānfarrox borrowed directly from these (or other) Islamic sources—an argument which, again, would be simply an isomorph of the standard scholarly model seeking the ori-gins of the critique of Judaism's citations—it seems fair to say that the Muslim and Zoroas-trian texts are, likely, drawing from the same shared oral nexus. 16.Lazarus-Yafeh, Intertwined Worlds, 112-13.17.Lazarus-Yafeh, Intertwined Worlds, 113-14.18.Lazarus-Yafeh allows the possibility that at least some of the conversations with Jewish sources depicted in the literature are \"imaginary.\" This possibility softens her problematic extrapolation from Muslim authors' reports to what their Jewish informants might have believed or said.

These include Abrāhīm's sickness, Āsīnaa's journey to heaven, Ādīnō's refusal to eat, and the \"great oath\" at the end of the encounter.31 Conversely, the most important ele-ment of the biblical version, the annunciation of the birth of Abraham's first son, is com-pletely lacking in the ŠGW. Moreover, if, as seems likely, we can identify the name Āsīnaa as a corrupted version of the name Isaac,32 then the ŠGW citation not only lacks this detail but contradicts biblical chronology. Again, as noted by previous scholars of the ŠGW, the most extensive midrashic expansions of this story are to be found in chapter 48 of Genesis Rabbah, the collection of aggadic traditions on the book of Genesis edited in Palestine in the first half of the fifth cen-tury,33 and on pages 86b-87a of tractate Bava Metsia of the Babylonian Talmud. While dating the final redaction of the Babylonian Talmud (also known as the Bavli) is a contentious issue,34 some scholars have argued that the Bavli's long aggadic sections, such as the one which deals with this story in tractate Bava Metsia, belong to the latest layer of development, between the fifth and eighth centuries.35 However, this late dating has recently been chal-30.The translation follows Robert Alter, Genesis: Translation and Commentary (New York: W. W. Norton, 1996), 77-79.31.Many of these elements appear in the parallel story of the angelic annunciation of the birth of Samson from Judges Chapter Thirteen. However, this story in Judges—or the other additional Jewish parallels that are listed in the notes to Appendix One—should be seen not as replacements for the story in Genesis 18 but as additional intertexts.32.Likely deformed by the process of translation from Pahlavi to Pazand, the form Āsīnaa likely derives from the Arabic form of the name Isaac,ʾIsḥāq (de Menasce, Apologétique, 198). The standard Pazand system for transcribing the Pahlavi script would seem to indicate that this could be the case. The ending -aa usually represents the Pahlavi participial suffix -ʾk. The sounds /n/ and /o/ share a single ligature, the straight vertical line. Initial /e/ is sometimes written with the sign for /a/, for instance in the non-logogram spelling of the verb \"to stand\" estādan, est- (ʾSTʾTN'). While the correspondence is not perfect, a Pahlavi spelling of the name as ʾSḤʾK could be misread as Āsīnāg. West (Shikand, 225) suggests that the Syriac form of the name, ʾĪsḥaq, could be behind the Pahlavi, with the vertial stroke of /ḥ/ misread as /n/. The Arabic form ʾIsḥāq is similar to the Syriac; subsitution of ś for ṣ already occurs in Hebrew by-form Yisḥāq (Horovitz, \"Jewish Proper Names and Derivatives in the Koran,\" 155).33.Strack and Stemberger, Introduction, 276-83.34.For a recent discussion and critique of the methodology underlying the theory of a late, anonymous redaction of earlier rabbinic traditions see the recent dissertation Vidas, \"Tradition and the Formation of the Talmud\" (PhD diss., Princeton University, 2009).- 38 -"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"lenged.36 In any case, for the purposes of my argument regarding the ŠGW, either dating can be accepted. While I will be primarily referring to these two texts, the story of Abraham's hospitality is expounded throughout the rabbinic corpus and I will draw on traditions from numerous Midrashim.Many of the motifs included in the ŠGW's account that are missing from the biblical version appear in these Midrashim. First of all, the divine identity of Abraham's guest or guests, which is ambiguous in the version in Genesis but a given in the ŠGW, is clarified in the Midrash. Genesis Rabbah 48:1 and BT Bava Metsia 86b both include a tradition that Abraham's three visitors described in Genesis 18 were the angels Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael.37 According to the Talmudic version:נינהו מאן38לבשר שבא מיכאל—ורפאל וגבריאל מיכאל ?אנשים שלושה 39 שבא רפאל ,שרה את לסדום למהפכיה אזל גבריאל ,אברהם את לרפא40Who are the three men? Michael, Gabriel and Raphael—Michael who came to give the news to Sarah, Raphael who came to heal Abraham and Gabriel who wentto overturn Sodom.The Babylonian Talmud also includes a tradition that, as in the ŠGW, it was God him-self who came to visit Abraham. This detail arises in connection with the midrashic state-ment that, as in the ŠGW, God's visit to Abraham was prompted by the patriarch's illness. Unlike the ŠGW's statement that Abrāhīm was pained in his eyes, however, the midrashic accounts state that Abraham was in recovery from his recent circumcision, described in Gen-esis 17:24. As it states in BT Bava Metsia 86b: חמא רבי אמר ?\"היום כחום\" מאי \".היום כחום האוהל פתח יושב והוא ממרא באלוני 'ה אליו וירא\"יום אותו :חנינא 'ר בר41שלישי יום 42היה אברהם של מילה של 43ה\"הקב ובא 44 .באברהם לשאול 35.See Rubenstein, \"Criteria,\" especially page 417: \"The extended collections of stories found in the Bavli likewise point to the work of the redactors, unless we wish to posit the existence of lengthy Amoraic narrative compilations.\" 36.Yaakov Elman, Review of \"The Culture of the Babylonian Talmud,\" by Jeffery Rubenstein, The Journal of Religion 86 (2006): 700-2; Kalmin, \"Formation,\" 844-46; and Isaiah M.

What is [meant by] \"the heat of the day\"? Rabbi Hama bar Hanina said: that day was the third day after Abraham's circumcision and God came to ask after Abraham. God took the sun out of its en-velope so that that righteous man would not be troubled with guests. He sent out Eliezer [his servant] to find someone. He went but did not find. He said to him: \"I don't believe you.\" As it says there: there is no trust in servants. He [Abraham] went out and saw the Lord God standing at the entrance. As it says: \"He lifted up his eyes and saw three men standing there and he saw and ran towards them.\" From the outset they were themselves coming towards him for they saw that he was in pain. They said: \"It is not proper to stand this way.\"51As much as this text from BT Bava Metsia states that God himself came to see Abraham and is somehow to be identified with his three visitors, the ambiguous status of the visitors is still maintained. When the text states that Abraham saw God standing at the entrance, are we to understand that Abraham did actually see God or that he saw God as he appeared in the shapeof one (or all three) of the visitors? This ambiguity is entirely absent from the ŠGW's ver-sion: there is no question that it is Ādīnō himself in a physical form who comes to pay a visit to Abrāhīm.The central concern of the ŠGW's version, whether and what divine beings can eat, is also at issue in the midrashic accounts. In a number of sources it is debated whether Abra-ham's visitors really ate Abraham's food. BT Bava Metsia 86b records the following tradition:45.This word is missing in MS. Vatican Ebr. 115.46.MS.

Rather say: they only seemed as if they were eating and drinking.Rav Tanhum bar Hanilai argues that in deference to mundane practice, the angels ate while they were Abraham's guests. The response of the Talmud's anonymous voice, the presence ofwhich is signaled both by the lack of a named authority who makes the statement and the switch in language from Hebrew to Aramaic, is that the angels did not actually eat but only appeared to do so, thereby both respecting Abraham's hospitality and preserving their divine purity.56 The anonymous comment puts the status of the eating and drinking in question and changes the smooth reading to a contentious one. As in the ŠGW, the rabbinic tradition also identifies the boy who aids Abraham in preparing the feast. The biblical text at Genesis 18:7 does not name Abraham's helper, refer-ring to him only as a naʿar, a youth or servant.57 In both Genesis Rabbah and Avot de Rabbi Nathan,58 however, the unnamed naʿar is identified as Ishmael, Abraham's other son, born to Hagar, Sarah's maidservant.59 As the version in Genesis Rabbah states: .במצות לזרזו בשביל ישמעאל זה—\"הנער אל ויתן\"52.MS.

Hamburg 165.56.\"בנימוסא עביד לקרתא עלת :אמר מתלא.\" This disagreement can be found in different versions: in Genesis Rabbah 48:14 (Theodor and Albeck, Bereshit Rabba, 491-92), as in BT Bava Metsia 86b, the argument thatthe angels did eat is attributed to Rav Tanhuma and the opposing argument is anonymous. However, in Exodus Rabbah 47:5, the opposing argument is attributed to Rabbi Yohanan; in Leviticus Rabbah 34:8 (Mordecai Margulies, ed. Midrash Wayyikra Rabbah [New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America,1993], 774-75) to Rabbi Yudan; and in Ecclesiastes Rabbah 3:18 to Rabbi Nathan. In Tanhuma Ki Tisa 19 (Buber, Tanhuma, 118) both opinions are given anonymously and in Numbers Rabbah 10:1 and Seder Eliyahu Rabbah 13:1 (M. Friedmann, ed., Seder Eliahu Rabba und Seder Eliahu Zuta (Tanna d'be Eliahu) [Vienna: Verlag der Israel.-theol. Lehranstalt, 1904], 59; William G. Braude and I. J. Kapstein, eds. and trans., Tanna debe Eliyyahu: The Lore of the School of Elijah [Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1981], 176) the Midrash states unequivocally that the angels ate. This statement from Seder Eliyahu Rabbah is alluded to in Tosefot apud Bava Metsia 86b. In Targum Pseudo-Jonathan 18:8 (Maher, Targum, 67) and Antiquities 1:197 (Josephus, Antiquities, 75), the text states that the angels only appeared to eat. 57.See Francis Brown, et al., Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament, rev. ed.

An unnamed character is identified with one already known, limiting the circle of players in this family drama.61 Addi-tionally, placing Ishmael in the role of Abraham's willing assistant highlights the dramatic irony. Ishmael readies the meal for the strangers bearing the message which seals his fate: Isaac will be Abraham's chosen son and Ishmael cast out into the desert.62The Deceitful SonThe second rabbinic tradition scholars have pointed to as the source of the ŠGW's ver-sion of the story of Abraham's hospitality is an expansion of a different biblical narrative. This is the account of Jacob's theft of the blessing intended for his older brother Esau from their father Isaac. This act of subterfuge, instigated by Jacob's mother Rebecca, culminates a history of sibling rivalry which begins in the womb63 and has already entailed Jacob's seizure of his older brother's birthright.64 In Genesis 27, Isaac, old and blind, asks his favored son Esau to make him a dish of venison in exchange for his final blessing. While Esau is out hunting, Rebecca instructs Jacob to disguise himself as Esau, bring him his favorite dishes and receive his father's blessing; the ruse is successful and Isaac does give Jacob the blessing intended for Esau. The motif of heavenly wine appears in the Midrash's explication of Genesis 27:17. This section of the narrative, beginning in verse fourteen, describes how Jacob follows his mother's instructions and his disguise:)14) :אָבִיו אָהֵב כַּאֲשֶׁר מַטְעַמִּים אִוֹמּ וַתַּעַשׂ לְאִוֹמּ וַיָּבֵא וַיִּקַּח וַיֵּלֶw (15 עֵשָׂו אֶת־בִּגְדֵי רִ בְקָה וַתִּקַּח () :הַקָּטָן בְּנָהּ אֶת־יַעֲק ֹב וַתַּלְבֵּשׁ בַּבָּיִת אִתָּהּ אֲשֶׁר הַחֲמֻד ֹת הַגָּד ֹל בְּנָהּ16 הִלְבִּישָׁה הָעִזִּים גְּדָיֵי ע ֹר ֹת וְאֵת () :צַוָּארָ יו חֶלְקַת וְעַל עַל־יָדָיו17:בְּנָהּ יַעֲק ֹב בְּיַד עָשָׂתָה אֲשֶׁר וְאֶת־הַלֶּחֶם אֶת־הַמַּטְעַמִּים וַתִּתֵּן ((14) And he went and fetched [the two kids] and brought to his mother; and his mother made a dish of the kind his father loved.

(17) And she placed the dish, and the bread she had made, in the hand of Jacob her son.65 60.48:13 (Theodor and Albeck, Bereshit Rabba, 490). In addition to ARN, this same tradition is included in the late Midrash Sekhel Tov (on which see Strack and Stemberger, Introduction, 357). Interestingly, BT Bava Metsia does not include this tradition and instead reads Abraham's command at 18:7—\"and he gave it to the boy and he hurried to do it\"—as referring not to one but to two separate youths.61.On this function in the Midrash in general see Isaac Heinemann, Darke Ha-Aggadah (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1970), 27-32, esp. 28.62.Genesis 21:9-10.63.Genesis 25:21-26.64.Genesis 25:29-34.65.The translation follows Alter, Genesis, 139.- 42 -"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"However, in 27:25, when Jacob presents the meal to his father, the text adds that he also served him wine: \"And he said, 'Serve me, that I may eat of the game of my son, so that I may solemnly bless you.' And he served him and he ate, and he brought him wine and he drank.\" The Midrash concludes that this wine was brought to Jacob by the angel Michael from the Garden of Eden. The other version scholars have cited from a late Midrash called the Tanhuma66 states: אשר הלחם ואת] המטעמים את ותתן\" אלא ,יין אמו לו נתנה שלא מצאנו הרי ?יין לו היה מהיכןמוצא את אין :רבותינו אמרו .עדן מגן יין לו הביאו מיכאל ?יין לו הביא ומי \".[בנה יעקב ביד עשתה לאל כהן והוא] ויין לחם הוציא שלם מלך צדק ומלכי\" :שנאמר ,אברהם ושל זה אלא ברכה של יין.בירכו ששתה כיון זה ואף \".[עליוןWhere did he get wine? For we know that his mother did not give him wine, but rather \"And she placed the dish [and the bread she had made, in the hand of Jacob her son.]\" And who brought him wine? Michael brought him wine from the Gar-den of Eden. Our rabbis said: One does not find wine of blessing but this and Abraham's, as it is said: \"Melchizedek king of Shalem brought out bread and wine [he was priest of God Most High.] (Genesis 14:18). And even this [wine], after he[Isaac] drank, he blessed him.67 In fact, this is only one of the heavenly attributes which the Tanhuma ascribes to him. Jacob also has a celestial odor, whether because the righteous carry the scent of heaven or because he wears the garments of Adam, which retain the scent of the Garden of Eden.68There is much to connect these midrashic expansions to the Jewish citation in the ŠGW. First of all, the character of Isaac—as an old man, a youth, and a divine promise—plays a central role in all three stories. There are also significant structural similarities. All three tales revolve around the presentation of a meal. In all three, a boy serves his father, either as an errand-boy and sous-chef in the ŠGW and Genesis 18, or as a waiter in Genesis 27. Each narrative also culminates in a blessing or oath. The father's illness, whether as Isaac and Abrāhīm's blindness or Abraham's post-circumcision weakness, is also a crucial element of all these stories. It is the connection between the two Midrashim which prompted Darmesteter to suggest that the ŠGW's description of Abrāhīm's eye pain could have resulted from the transfer of an element related to Isaac in Genesis 27 to his father in Genesis 18.69However, pointing to only these two sources is unsatisfying on a number of levels. First of all, the question can be raised of why and at what point the Midrashim on Abraham 66.The final redaction of the Tanhuma, which exists in two different recensions, post-dates the ninth century. See Leopold Zunz, Ha-Drashot be-Israel, trans. M. A. Jacques, (Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 1974), 247 and Strack and Stemberger, Introduction, 305-6. While the Tanhuma is based partially on earlier materials, the text's late redaction raises the possibility that this Midrash on Jacob's wine actually post-dates the ŠGW. This represents a further challenge to the theory that the ŠGW is based directly on this source.67.Tanhuma Toldot 16 (Buber, Tanhuma, 135). The same tradition appears in Yalkut Shimoni Toldot on Genesis 14:18, par. 115 (Arthur B. Hyman, et al., eds., Yalqut Shim'oni ʿal ha-Torah le Rabbenu Shimʿon ha-Darshan [Jerusalem: Mosad Harav Kook, 1973], 2:554) and Targum Pseudo-Jonathan 27:25 (Maher, Targum, 96).68.Buber, Tanhuma, 135.69.Darmesteter, \"Judaisme,\" 14.- 43 -"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"and Isaac became connected. Are we to imagine that Mardānfarrox combined the two Midrashim himself? This seems to be the thrust of Jacob Neusner's claim that \"the author hasobviously heard and reshaped stories useful for his polemical purpose.\"70 Alternatively, if thetwo expanded biblical narratives were already \"mixed\" by the time that Mardānfarrox heard them, since there is no rabbinic tradition which combines these motifs in that way, this presumption itself points away from identifying the Midrash as the source of this story. Evenassuming that the ŠGW retains a lost Midrash of some type, it would have to be a strange Midrash indeed that casts Isaac as his father's assistant in the scene which announces his birth. Describing the citation in the ŠGW as the \"combination\" of two traditions is itself not quite right. It would be more accurate to say that one or two motifs from the expanded Gene-sis 27 narrative have been incorporated into the body of the expanded Midrash on Genesis 18. There is an hierarchy of traditions: the story of hospitality is the dominant narrative and the motifs of wine from heaven and, perhaps, Abrāhīm's eye pain, have been drawn into its matrix. Most significantly, if the ŠGW was influenced directly, somehow, by the Midrashim in BT Bava Metsia, Genesis Rabbah, the Tanhuma,71 and Avot de Rabbi Nathan, we can ask why only some of the motifs found in those sources are present in the ŠGW. For example, the long section devoted to Abraham in BT Bava Metsia includes numerological speculations on which and what kinds of animals Abraham prepared for his guests, the menu of the feast—tongues in mustard—how Abraham's hospitality prefigured God's future care for the Childrenof Israel in the desert, a comparison between Abraham's hospitality and Lot's inhospitality in Sodom,72 and, of course, a great deal of discussion of the role and character of Sarah, who does not appear in the ŠGW's account at all. If Mardānfarrox had access to this Midrash, why would he copy certain motifs and not others? There seems to be no underlying principledictating which motifs make the jump to the ŠGW and which do not; the selection process is random and unmotivated. In a certain sense, these questions are reductive and hyper-literal; it is unlikely that Neusner and the other scholars, in pointing to these Midrashim, imagined Mardānfarrox poring over the pages of BT Bava Metsia, for instance, to find the juiciest and most damagingJewish stories. However, naming these as the sole sources of the citation invites this kind of response, precisely owing to the undertheorized notions of \"influence\" and \"sources\" being employed. If the ŠGW citation was \"influenced\" by these Midrashim, that influence must be accounted for, both in the ways that the citation adheres to its putative source and how it deviates from it. On the whole, while it is undeniable that there is some relationship between the cita-tion and the Midrash, that relationship cannot be as binary and unidirectional as previous scholars have thought. The ŠGW deviates too much from the Midrashim as we have them; too much is unmotivated. It seems more likely that the ŠGW is drawing from an oral nexus of traditions now lost to us, the same kind of nexus described in connection with Islam by Pregil and Lazarus-Yaffeh. 70.Neusner, History, 4:422.71.On the late dating of the Tanhuma see the note above.72.The story of the destruction of the cities in the plain appears in Genesis 19, immediately following the storyof Abraham's hospitality.- 44 -"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"In what follows I will outline some of the other possible elements in this oral nexus which contributed to the citation as we find it in the ŠGW. This list is by no means meant to be exhaustive nor, to reiterate a point made above, do I wish to replace rabbinic literature with some other tradition's text or canon. Rather, I will point to similar motifs found in a number of traditions with the goal of highlighting the undecidability and impossibility of determining clear lines of influence in this case. Angelic AbstinenceThe ŠGW unquestionably engages with Islamic literature and sources. This is evidentnot only from the extended critique of Islam in ŠGW Chapter Eleven, but the generic conven-tions and theological concerns of the text as a whole. As mentioned in the introduction, theseare entirely in line with the rationalist doctrines of the Muʿtazilite theological school. With this fact in mind, it is not surprising that the Qurʾānic accounts of Abraham's hospitality are, in a number of ways, closer to the ŠGW's version than the biblical or midrashic traditions. The story of Abraham's hospitality is repeated in four separate locations in the Qurʾān, testi-fying to its importance.73 Two of these passages in particular bear a striking resemblance to the version on the ŠGW: 11:69-73 and 51:24-30. The former passage reads: Our messengers came to Abraham with the good tidings; they said, \"Peace!\" \"Peace,\" he said; and presently he brought a roasted calf. And when he saw their hands not reaching towards it, he was suspicious of them and conceived afear of them. They said, \"Fear not; we have been sent to the people of Lot.\" And his wife was standing by; she laughed, therefore We gave her the glad tid-ings of Isaac, and, after Isaac, of Jacob. She said, \"Woe is me! Shall I bear, being an old woman, and this my husband is an old man? This assuredly is a strange thing.\" They said, \"What, dost thou marvel at God's command? The mercy of God and His blessings be upon you, O people of the House! Surely He is All-laudable, All-glorious.\"74As in the account in Genesis, Abraham hastens to serve his guests a roasted calf.75 However, the messengers76 don't touch the food and, because of their strange behavior, Abraham be-73.Qurʾān 11:69-76; 15:51-9; 29:31; and 51:24-30. 74.The translation follows Arthur John Arberry, trans., The Koran Interpreted (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1964), 219-20.75.Genesis 18:7. The two Qurʾānic passages differ on the question of what Abraham served: 11:69 specifies a roasted (ḥanīdh) calf while 51:26 a fatted (samīn) calf. Ṭabarī reconciles this slight disparity by claiming that Abraham roasted the fatted calf.

The significant difference between the ŠGW and the Qurʾān on the one side, and the midrashic expansions on the other is not whether the angels ate; as discussed above, several midrashic texts preserve the opinion that they did not do so. Rather, the difference lies in the patriarch's perception of their abstinence. In the ŠGW and Qurʾān, followed by the later Is-lamic commentaries, Abrāhīm sees that Ādīnō and the angels do not eat and reacts according-ly; the motif is foregrounded and propels the narrative. In the Midrash, on the other hand, whether or not the angels actually partook of Abraham's food, they appeared to him to do so. Since the knowledge that the angels abstained is revealed only to the Midrash's reader, and not the story's characters, the narrative can proceed as in the Bible unaltered. The point of citing the Qurʾānic account is to offer a possible parallel genealogy for the ŠGW's citation of the story of Abrāhīm's hospitality. In particular, the similar foreground-ing of the motif of the guest's abstaining from eating points to the possibility that, rather than having been influenced solely by the Bible and midrashic versions outlined above, this Islam-ic narrative could also have been part of the oral nexus from which the ŠGW drew.The Name of GodOne of the aspects of the ŠGW's citation which seems to point most strongly towards its Jewish origins is the name given to the Jewish God, Ādīnō. This name appears throughoutthe critique of Judaism78 and it is undoubtedly a version, likely deformed by the process of translation from Pahlavi to Pazand, of one of the principal Jewish epithets for God. ʾAdōnāy, meaning \"my Lord,\" occurs frequently as one of the divine names in the Bible.79 Based on the evidence of the Septuagint, where the ineffable four-letter name of God is translated by the Greek kurios, likewise meaning \"Lord,\" ʾAdōnāy had replaced the pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton by the third century BCE.80 In rabbinic texts, the proscription on pronounc-ing the divine name is mentioned already in the Mishnah.81 Moreover, ʾĀdōnāy is mentioned as the usual substitute in BT Pesahim 50a: .דלת באלף ונקרא הא ביוד נכתב הזה העולם .הבא העולם הזה כעולם לא\" :יצחק בר נחמן רב אמר\".הא ביוד ונכתב ,הא ביוד נקרא הבא העולם82Rav Nahman Bar Yitzhak said: \"This world is not like the world to come.

The world to come: [it is] spoken with yod he and written with yod he.\"83However, ʾAdōnāy was known as a name for God outside the Jewish context. In the form Adonaios and Adonin, the name is given to various evil heavenly powers mentioned in the Nag Hammadi documents.84 Abū Rayḥān al-Birunī, the eleventh century polymath, men-tions the name in his work on India, noting, as in the Talmud, the distinction between writing and pronunciation.85 Martin Schwartz has discussed the passage in Birunī as well as the appearance of versions of the name in a fifteenth century Arabic magical compilation, the Kitāb ar-Raḥma fī aṭ-ṭibb wa-l-ḥikma, ascribed to Jalāl al-Dīn al-Suyūtī. Alongside versions of the names Gilgamesh, Gadriel, and others, the magical formula ʾdwnʾy ʾṣbʾwt ʾl šdʾy,86 from the Hebrew phrase meaning \"the Lord of Hosts, God Almighty,\" appears.87Schwartz argues persuasively that these magical names and formulae passed into Arabic from a Manichaean Middle Persian translation of the Book of the Giants, one of the canonical books of the Manichaens authored by Mani himself.88 This is not surprising, as the name ʾAdōnāy appears in other Manichaean texts. Especially interesting in light of the use ofthe name in the critique of Judaism in the ŠGW is a Manichaean polemical poem contained ina manuscript fragment known as M28.89 M28 contains three abacendarian poems, only the second of which is complete. The fragment is missing the verses of the first poem before the letter resh—the poems follow the order of the Aramaic alphabet—and the last only goes from83.For further discussion of rabbinic sources, see Jacob Z.

It seems likely, based on their similar content, that these are not three separate poems but rather three successive cantos of a single work.90 The polemic in the text is directed against various doctrines.91 While Skjaervo under-stood the poem to be a Manichaean composition polemicizing, amongst others, also against Marcionites,92 de Blois has convincingly argued otherwise. As the poem's theology is some-what at odds with Manichaean doctrine and, furthermore, as the reference to Marcion93 is entirely positive, de Blois has proposed that M28 could be a Manichaean adoption of an orig-inally Marcionite work.94 In his analysis of the text, de Blois has highlighted the correspon-dences between the poem's polemic and what we know of Marcionite doctrine from other sources.The name ʾAdōnāy, spelled as Manichaean Middle Persian ʾdwny, appears in two of the verses from the complete, second canto. The first is in the second stanza:95bycʾrwm96 w šrmzd kyrdwm ʾdwny ʾwš ghwdgʾn kw \"ʾgr yk ʾst yzd gyhmwrd ky wypt?\"I made weary and ashamedʾAdōnāy and his foul offspringsaying: \"If there is [only] one Godwho then deceived Gayomard?\"97As in the ŠGW, the polemic is directed against the idea that ʾAdōnāy is the author of both good and evil. Specifically, the polemic refers to the Eden story in Genesis; a version of this same story is discussed at length in ŠGW Chapter Thirteen.98 How, the polemicist asks, could the same God who created and put Adam in the garden, as the sole author and sustainerof the universe, also be responsible for his deception and temptation? As de Blois notes, this polemic accords well with Marcionite theology. In that conception, there is a radical divisionbetween the true God and the lower creator of the world. Just as there is a contrast between the two deities, their two books, the law of the creator in the Old Testament and the gospel of 90.Skjaervo, \"Turfan,\" 240.91.On Manichaean polemics against Judaism in general see Samuel N.

This division, and Marcion's literalist critique of theHebrew scriptures which accompanied it, was supported and articulated through a reading of Paul's letters.99 In addition to these two beings, later Marcionites identified matter (called, as in Manichean tradition, hyle) as a third, evil deity. \"In this view, the just god made Adam, but Adam was seduced by the evil god and rebelled against his maker, who repudiated him.\"100While subsequent stanzas contain interesting attacks against the Sabbath (šmbyd) and circumcision (pwst brydg)101 and, perhaps, Adam as the son of God,102 the next reference to ʾAdōnāy only occurs in stanza 11:103xwʾnynd ʾw br mrym104 pws ʿy ʾdwny hptwmygʾgr hʾn ʾst xwdʾy ʿy wysp pwsyš ky kyrd ʾwbdʾr?105They call Bar Maryam the seventh son of ʾAdōnāy;If he is the Lord of All,who crucified his son?Here too, the polemic centers on the contradiction between God's omnipotence and the suf-fering of his creations, in this case his own son. A similar critique of the illogic of the story of the crucifixion is found in ŠGW Chapter Fifteen.106 The identification of Jesus as the sev-enth son of ʾAdōnāy could be related to Elchasaite and Ebionite beliefs that the Christ appeared not once but in numerous forms throughout history, first as Adam, later as the figureencountered by Abraham (in Genesis 18) and the other patriarchs and finally as Jesus.107 ʾAdōnāy is revealed to be, in this passage as the one before, the name by which the adherents of the doctrines attacked know their one, true deity. At the same time, it is the appellation of the evil, creator deity who produces foul offspring and is ashamed (šrmzd) by the polemicist'sattack. 99.Some scholars have suggested, in fact, that Marcion only \"brought to its logical conclusion\" the tendency inherent in Paul's writing to denigrate the Law; in Galatians 3:19, Paul even goes so far as to raise the possibility that the Law was not authored by God at all but \"ordained through angels by a mediator.\" See the discussion in Heikki Räisänen, \"Marcion,\" in The Blackwell Companion to Paul, ed.

First of all, it helps explain the surprising spelling of the name of the Jewish God in the ŠGW. Ādīnō results from the vowel metathesisof the /e/ and /i/, either in an underlying Pahlavi form written, presumably as in Manichaean Middle Persian, ʾdwny, or at some point during the transmission of the Pazand text. Darmesteter already suggested this explanation of the Pazand form.108More crucially the ʾAdōnāy in this poem need not be the deity of Jews at all. The def-inition of Judaism and Jewish belief is, of course, a contentious and slippery endeavor. At thevery least, however, those who believed that Jesus was \"the seventh son of ʾAdōnāy\" were outside of the domain of rabbinic Judaism; de Blois speculates that at least some of the polemical stanzas might be directed against Jewish-Christians.109 Whatever the identity of these adherents, ʾAdōnāy is not associated here specifically with Jewish scriptures. Of course, it is the God of the Old Testament who is attacked, but it would be ridiculous to read these stanzas and others in the poem as interpretations of specific passages in the Hebrew Bible. Rather, ʾAdōnāy has become uncoupled from those texts and reassigned, as a name and a character, to an entirely different context. This is precisely the reason that I have devoted so much attention to this poem. The Ādīnō of the ŠGW need not be the sign of Mardānfarrox's reading Jewish texts at all. ʾAdōnāy was a divine name which circulated widely, independently of Jewish literature, and in polemical contexts quite similar to those we find in the ŠGW.Polluted WineʾAdōnāy also occurs as a divine name in the writings, polemical and otherwise, of the Mandaeans. The Mandaean community, living in Khuzistan in what is now the border regionbetween Iraq and Iran, is thought to have originated as a Palestinian baptismal sect in the late Second Temple period.110 The community has preserved a significant religious literature—the Ginza Rabbā (Great Treasure) being a central work—including polemical texts. Ginza Rabbā I 23:17-24,111 for instance, describes how Adunai, as the Jewish God is called there, elected for himself a nation and a synagogue was established for him. The walled town of Jerusalem, the city of the Jews, was built, those who circumcise them-selves with a sword and sprinkle (cast) their blood unto their faces and (in this manner) they worship Adunai. The woman who are in their menstruation are ly-ing in the lap of men. They turn aside from the primal law (šuta qadaita) and theymake for themselves a book.108.Darmesteter, \"Judaisme,\" 6.109.De Blois, \"Turfan,\" 483.110.See Dan Shapira, \"ʾEin Mazal le-Yisraʾel: Celestial Race, the Jews,\" Kabbalah: Journal for the Study of Jewish Mystical Texts 5 (2000): 111 and the sources quoted there. 111.Text and translation in Shapira, \"Celestial Race,\" 112; the older German translation can be found in Mark Lidzbarski, Ginzā, der schatz oder das grosse Buch der Mandäer (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht, 1925), 25.- 50 -"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"As in the Manichaean text just discussed, circumcision is a prominent theme here. The accu-sation of the violation of menstrual purity is also especially serious, as ritual cleanliness is a major Mandaean religious obligation.In Mandaean writings, as Shapira notes, Adunai is more than just the name of the Jewish God. Adunai is also the sun (šamiš ḍadunai qariḥ, GR I 23:19), the chief of the evil archons who prevent the good souls from ascending to their celestial home.112 The Jews are, in fact, themselves identical with these archons. Effectively, the Mandaeans consider the Jews to be a species of demons; Shapira argues that this demonization of the Jews is inspired by Jewish lore, in particular the same myth of the fallen giants mentioned in the Manichaean context above.113There is another Mandaean polemical passage which has a direct bearing on the cita-tion in the critique of Judaism. I discussed above the motif of Āsīnaa bringing back wine from heaven and the parallel scholars have identified between this motif and the angel Gabriel's provision of wine for Jacob in the midrashic expansions of Genesis 27. Further-more, Ādīnō's refusal to consume the wine Abrāhīm offers him is paralleled in Jewish and Islamic versions of the story of Abraham's hospitality. However, the reason Ādīnō gives for refusing to consume Abrāhīm's offering is not found in either tradition. Ādīnō's statement that \"I will not drink since it is not from heaven nor is it pure,\" would seem to imply that if it were pure, he would drink. Indeed, once Abrāhīm assures him that the wine is, in fact, from heaven, Ādīnō happily receives the patriarch's gift. From the perspective of the Jewish and Muslim version of this story, the purity or impurity of the food Abraham offers to his visitors is not the issue at all. Angels normally subsist on the glory of the divine presence114 and, as is spelled out in the midrashic sources mentioned above, even those rabbis who believe the angels did eat the meal Abraham prepared recognize this as a violation of normal practice. Of course, it could be argued that the emphasis on the purity of Abrāhīm's wine reflects the purity regulations entailed in the Jewish cult and offerings. However, since sacrifice, not to mention the Temple, is never mentioned in the ŠGW, this seems an unlikely possibility.Impure wine is a prominent feature, though, of certain polemical texts in the Ginza Rabbā. The motif appears in the following passage, polemicizing against the Manichaeans:Again I will teach you, my disciples, that there is another gate,115 which emerges from Jesus (Msiha), who are called Zandiqs (zandiqia) and Manichaeans (*mar-mania). They sow their seed secretly and allot a portion of it to the gloom, women and men sleep with one another, they take the seed and throw it into wine, and they offer it to the Souls [Mandaeans] to drink, saying that it is pure.116112.Shapira, \"Celestial Race,\" 118.

He argues that the connection in the passage between seed and food relates to the Manichaean belief that certain foods contain greater amounts of \"the swallowed light ejacu-lated by the archons.\"117 Without calling into question Shapira's argument, it is important to note that polluted wine is a motif which reoccurs in other polemical passages.118 This is found particularly in the passage concerning Venus:Behold, I told you about the \"gate\" of Libat (Venus) and about the deeds that she performed in the world, and about the sacraments, the Seven Primal Sacraments ofRuha,119 I am telling you: they kill a Jewish boy and take some of his blood and bake it with bread and give them as a meal, they mix in a goblet the menstrual blood of a whoring virgin-nun with wine and let them drink, and the eyes of the people should not fall upon them . . .120Whatever the identity of this group—certainly Christians of some kind—the text presents a warning for righteous believers. The passage allows two possible readings. On the one hand,it is possible that the followers of the sect are the ones who prepare the defiled bread and wine for their own consumption. They make sure only that outsiders not discover the devil-ish recipes they employ to make the sacrament. On the other hand, according to a second reading, this passage would resemble the previous polemic. In other words, the nefarious sectarians would deliberately defile unwit-ting Mandaeans through impure wine and bread; the Mandaeans would be those to whom they give the bread \"as a meal\" and \"let them drink\" the wine. According to this interpreta-tion, the text reacts with horror to the killing of a Jewish boy for his blood not out of a sense of humanitarianism but rather because the blood of Jews, identified with the archons, is the most impure. The same can be said of the menstrual blood slipped into the wine; it is the especially tainted menstruation of a whoring nun. Just as in the anti-Manichaean passage, thepoint here is the depiction of the deliberate practice of ritual impurity rather than any sexual deviance. While Mandaean polemics against Judaism do not include this motif of polluted wine,the Ginza Rabbā does state that \"from the circumcised, slothful Jews all the nations and gatesChristians and other Heretics: A Study of the Redaction of Mandaic Texts,\" Le Muséon 117 (2004): 270; Lidzbarski, Ginzā, 229.117.Shapira, \"Manichaeans,\" 4.

J. J. Buckley, however, has argued that the Mandaean sources actually paint a more nuanced and sometimes even positive portrayal of Ruḥa. See J.J. Buckley, \"A Rehabilitation of Spirit Ruha in MandaeanReligion,\" History of Religions 22 (1982): 60-84.120.GR I 225-226; Shapira, \"Manichaeans,\" 28; Lidzbarski, Ginzā, 227.- 52 -"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"of darkness originated.\"121 The Jews are the origin of all sectarianism and heresy. Ādīnō's hasty refusal of Abrāhīm's offer of a hospitable drink is precisely the reaction any good Man-daean should have when confronted with Jewish wine. The importance of this Mandaean polemic is that it presents a parallel with a motif that is central to the citation in the ŠGW but present neither in any of the biblical and rabbinicpassages scholars have pointed to nor in the parallel Islamic account. Again, without arguingthat this particular Mandaean polemical text is the source for the ŠGW's citation, this text demonstrates that polemics relating Jews and polluted wine were part of the wider cultural matrix of the ŠGW.The CushionAs the ŠGW states in 14:42, when Ādīnō came to visit Abrāhīm he \"sat on a cushion and asked after his welfare.\" This detail is not included in the midrashic versions of the story.While the extended discussion in BT Bava Metsia does mention Abraham's standing up out of respect for his guests—and this despite the pain of his recent circumcision—neither God's sitting is mentioned nor is the object on which he sat. Edward William West, in his transla-tion of the passage, dismisses this description as \"the usual Oriental salutation.\"122 However, this detail is more significant than West allows. Under the Sasanians and even earlier, royalty was associated with sitting on a higher and more comfortable seat. More than just marking the status of the king, the power of vari-ous court dignitaries was signified by the height and proximity of their seats to that of the king. Thrones, of course, were important marks of royalty and special stools were reserved for highly placed persons. This custom is reflected in reports of the Sasanian court transmit-ted in Arabic as well as in the accounts of Achamenid practices. For instance, in the Book of Esther, Haman's promotion at court is symbolized by his stool being elevated above those of other dignitaries.123Cushions, though, were just as much signifiers of status. Several Sasanian engraved silver bowls and seals depict the king sitting and reclining on piles of mats and cushions.124 One example is found in a Sasanian gold cup in the collection of the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. The ruler, most often identified as Khosrow I Anoshirvan (r. 531-579), depicted in the central medallion of the cup, sits facing the viewer on a cushion on an ornately carved divan; next to him are piled six additional cushions, making a total of seven.125 Similar depic-tions of Sasanian notables can be found in Arabic, Armenian, and Talmudic texts and various sources convey different numbers and heights of the cushions. Ṭabarī describes the Sasanian general Rustam sitting on a golden throne piled with gold-embroidered cushions to impress a delegation of the Muslim army,126 and elsewhere depicts the Sasanian king Khosrow II 121.GR I 224; Shapira, \"Manichaeans,\" 26; Lidzbarski, Ginzā, 225.122.West, Pahlavi Texts Parts Three, 225.123.Shaul Shaked, \"From Iran to Islam: On Some Symbols of Royalty,\" Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam 7 (1986): 79-81.124.Roman Ghirshman, Persian Art: The Parthian and Sasanian Dynasties, trans.

This is exemplified in a crucial scene in the fifth century Armenian work the Epic Histories by Pʿaw-stos Buzand.129 While Armenian literature and culture in general are strongly connected to that of Iran,130 scholars have argued that Pʿawstos' work in particular is cast in the mold of Iranian epic traditions.131 The Epic Histories provides an account of the wars between the Sasanians and the Armenians during the rule of Shapur II (r. 309-379); as will become imme-diately clear, the fact that the Armenian kings were descended from a branch of the Parthian royal family, the Iranian dynasty overthrown by the Sasanians in their rise to power, is a sig-nificant element in this rivalry. The episode of interest to us here describes the visit of the Armenian king Aršak II (r. 350-367) to the camp of the Sasanian monarch Shapur. Despite the good relations between the royal houses, Shapur, on the advice of various astronomers, is suspicious of Aršak's intentions. After seizing the king and his vassal on their arrival at camp, Shapur unveils a ruse to reveal his rival's true feelings. He orders a tent prepared in which half the ground is covered with Armenian soil and the other half with Iranian soil. Walking back and forth in the tent, Shapur engages Aršak in conversation. As long as the Armenian king is on Iranian soil, he is deferential to the Iranian ruler. However, when on his native earth, Aršak cannot restrain his feelings; he is defiant and condescending. Upon reach-ing Armenian soil, the text describes Aršak unleashing the following insult:Away from me malignant servant, lording it over your lords! I shall not spare you or your children from the vengeance due to my ancestors, nor forgive the death of king Artewan. For you are but servants who have now taken the cushion from us, your lords. But I shall not concede this until that place of ours shall return to us!132126.Muhammad ibn Jarīr Ṭabarī, The Battle of al-Qādisiyyah and the Conquest of Syria and Palestine, ed. and trans. by Yohanan Friedmann, vol. 12 of The History of al-Ṭabarī (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1992), 65-67; Shaked, \"Royalty,\" 78.127.Shaked, \"Royalty,\" 77.

In denouncing the Sasanians as servants,Aršak could be referring to the tradition that Pabag, the father of Ardashir, was a local ruler inthe province of Persia under Artabanus.133 The Sasanian's unjust usurpation of rule is sym-bolized by their taking of the cushion from the rightful Arcasid line. However, Aršak vows that he will not concede to Sasanian rule over Iran until Armenia is free. As in this passage from the Epic Histories, in the ŠGW the single cushion on which Ādīnō sits is a sign of status and prestige. Whether the cushion is meant to indicate royalty assuch is not clear, though one would imagine that such an association would not be inappropri-ate for a deity, even a false one. At the very least, the cushion indicates that Ādīnō has a higher status than Abrāhīm and that the latter treats him as an honored guest. In the Talmudicpassage and elsewhere the more cushions in the pile seem to indicate a higher status. Accord-ing to that logic, depicting Ādīnō sitting on one cushion could be seen as a kind of damning with faint praise; he gets only one, as opposed to the six or seven of the Iranian king. How-ever, as Aršak's outburst shows, even one cushion can stand metonymically for the whole complex of royalty and honor. This source demonstrates particularly well the possibility of multiple determining ele-ments intersecting in the citation in the ŠGW. This particularly Iranian motif is included in no other version of the story of Abraham's hospitality. Like the Armenian history, this cita-tion draws on the symbolic value of the cushion as a marker of high status and kingship. Thetwo texts are not directly related to each other but, rather, both draw from a larger, shared cul-tural framework. ConclusionIn this chapter I have aimed to present the theoretical justification and textual support for a new interpretation of the sources of the critique of Judaism' citation of the story of Abra-ham's hospitality. The Qurʾanic parallel, the Manichaean (or Marcionite) hymn, the Man-daean polemic, and the Armenian epic history all share motifs with the citation, and each of these texts illustrates a different relation to it. The Qurʾān's versions of the Abraham story present an additional source for the tale of Abraham's angelic visitors. The Manichaean (or Marcionite) and Mandaean texts share motifs and names with the ŠGW's citation and are used in a similar polemical context. The final Aremenian text points to the incorporation of a well known Iranian motif. While I have devoted considerable space to discussing each of these texts, I want to reiterate that my goal in this chapter is not to replace the midrashic textsother scholars have identified as the citation's sources. Not only would I not discount the importance of traditions preserved in rabbinic literature in Mardānfarrox's world, but none of the texts I have discussed—a selection that is by no means exhaustive—represents a \"smoking gun,\" the source which must have directly influenced Mardānfarrox in composing the ŠGW. Rather, as in Foucault's definition of genealogy, I have attempted to show that in the case of the ŠGW's critique of Judaism, we are presented with \"a singularity born out of multiple determining elements\" the presentation of which \"does not function according to anyprinciple of closure.\" 133.See Touraj Daryaee, Sasanian Persia: the Rise and Fall of an Empire (London: I.

This means that the citation is best interpreted not as a text borrowed from and in relation to its origin, else-where, but in its context in the ŠGW. If the search for origins is inherently decontextualizing,in the sense that it looks for a source outside the text of the ŠGW, the alternative can be described as a project of contextualization. In the chapters that follow, I will attempt to show,in different ways, how individual citations in the critique of Judaism, and the critique as a whole, engage with the rest of Mardānfarrox's text and the ŠGW's overall theology and argu-ment. As I hope to show, this engagement is deep, significant, and complex.- 56 -"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Chapter ThreeUnnecessary Angels:Angelology and Jewish Mysticism in the ŠGWThe Iranian context of the Babylonian Talmud has been a topic of renewed scholarly concern over the past decade and more.1 Reading the Bavli in Iran, as Shai Secunda titled one of his recent articles,2 has entailed the comparative study of the Talmud and Pahlavi liter-ature. Working on the assumption that Jews and Zoroastrians inhabited a shared social space in late antique Mesopotamia,3 scholars have demonstrated the \"acculturation,\" as Yaakov Elman has called the process,4 of Babylonian rabbis to the dominant Zoroastrian/Sasanian 1.For a brief histories of the field see Yaakov Elman, \"'Up to the Ears' in Horses' Necks (B.M. 108a): On Sasanian Agricultural Policy and Private 'Eminent Domain',\" Jewish Studies Internet Journal 3 (2004): 95-149; Geoffrey Herman, \"Ahasuerus, the Former Stable-Master of Belshazzar and the Wicked Alexander of Macedon: Two Parallels between the Babylonian Talmud and Persian Sources,\" AJS Review 29 (2005): 283-97; and Shai Secunda, \"Reading the Bavli in Iran,\" The Jewish Quarterly Review 100 (2010) 310-42.2.Secunda, \"Reading the Bavli.\"3.Michael Morony, Iraq after the Muslim Conquest (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984) contains a survey of the various communities living in Mesopotamia at the time of the Muslim conquest.

In the context of this disser-tation, these recent studies sharpen the question of the origins of the critique of Judaism's citations broached in the previous chapter. Rather than asking about the relationship betweenthe ŠGW and Jewish literature, or, even, rabbinic literature, in general, this research would seem to point in the direction of looking specifically at the parallels between the critique of Judaism and the Babylonian Talmud.

First of all, the Iranian environment of late antique Sasanian Mesopotamia is not identical with Zoroastrianism, nor is it fully representedby the Zoroastrian Pahlavi literature composed several centuries later; this caveat has been noted by previous scholars.10 Secondly, along similar lines, the Babylonian Talmud is not identical with all Jews living under Iranian rule. The Talmud itself contains references to rival groups and individuals,11 and, furthermore, by the date of the composition of the ŠGW, organized opposition to growing rabbinic power had formed. These opposition groups, the Karaites principal among them,12 are well known to Islamic heresiographers.13 Particularly since they wrote in Arabic, there is no reason to suppose that they could not also have served as the sources of the citations in the critique.Even taking these caveats into consideration, though, we are left with the fact that the ŠGW's critique does include citations that are remarkably close to their parallels in the Baby-lonian Talmud, much closer than the parallels between the story of Abrāhīm's hospitality and the midrashic expansion of Genesis 18 in tractate Bava Metsia. In this chapter, then, I will examine the three citations most similar to parallel sources in the Bavli. This examination will be a continuation of the discussion in the previous chapter in that it will also engage withthe question of the origin of the critique of Judaism's citations in Jewish literature. At the same time, this chapter furthers the goal outlined at the end of Chapter One to demonstrate the embeddedness of the citations in the larger context of the ŠGW. For there is a further, thematic connection between the three citations discussed here. They are not only connected by the fact that they closely parallel Talmudic sources. Rather, angels are signifi-cant characters in all three citations. As I will argue in more detail in what follows, the reason for the citations' particular depictions of angels is internal to the ŠGW, connected to the text's overall polemical and theological goals.The three citations are all found in ŠGW Chapter Fourteen: 14:34 and 36 deal with a conflict between divine and angelic power; 14:75-79 describes the angels' objection to God's punishment of the innocent with the sinners; and 14:58-70 demonstrates the Jewish God's inability to control human destiny. In his discussion of the citations, Mardānfarrox never cri-tiques angelic existence as such, meaning that he does not point to Jewish belief in the exis-tence of divine beings other than God as a contradiction of monotheism. Nevertheless, in all three citations, angels are portrayed as weak, oppressed, and abused. After first comparing the angelic citations with parallel passages in the Babylonian Talmud, I will argue that these citations may be resitutated as a response to Jewish mystical traditions that ascribe to angels power equaling God's. Finally, I will discuss how the ŠGW's reshaping of these traditions further challenges the current scholarly consensus that Mardānfarrox was directly influenced by rabbinic literature.10.Josef Wiesehöfer, Ancient Persia: from 550 BC to 650 AD (London: I.

The centrality of angels to these citations can be demonstrated with the translation and brief discussion of each citation and its rabbinic parallels. For the reasons outlined above, I will focus in my analysis on the parallel passages to each citation found in the Babylonian Talmud; other parallels will be mentioned in the notes. We can consider first a pair of linked citations found in ŠGW 14:34-37. I will includeMardānfarrox's commentary on these citations as it makes explicit his understanding of the citations' portrayal of divine violence against angels.(34) īṇca gōeṯ ku \"aβar taxt nišīnǝṯ kǝ cihār frīstaa aβar farī dārǝṇd kǝšą ǝž saṇg bār han yak rōdǝ̄ i atašī ažaš hamǝ̄ raβǝṯ.\"(35) nuṇ ka ōi mainiiō hast nǝ̄ tani-kard aigišą14 cihār mustamaṇd i x́ār garą bār pa raṇj dāštan cim?(36) diṯ īṇ ku \"har rōž pa x́ǝ̄š dast naβaṯ hazār frīstaa vīrāeṯ, vaš aṇdā šavą gāh15 hamǝ̄ parastǝṇd, vašą pas pa rōd-ǝ̄ i ātašī ō dōžax hǝ̄lǝṯ.\"(37) ka dīṯ16 must u aβǝ̄dādī i pa īṇ āinaa pa kār u kǝrbaa u hūkunišnī gǝ̄θiią būdan cuṇ sažǝṯ?

(38) When he casts those poor angels, rev-erent, obedient and pure-acting, along with the other sinners into eternal hell?Both these citations, at least in Mardānfarrox's understanding, describe divine violence against angels. Suffering under the weight of God's throne—and Mardānfarrox, in his cri-tique of this citation, emphasizes that it portrays God as unfittingly corporeal—the angels' sweat pours out as fire. The second citation, criticized for its portrayal of God's unjustified violence, describes the daily massacre of the entire heavenly host. These two images are linked in the talmudic parallel in BT Hagigah 13b-14a.

The key verse in this description is the depiction of the fiery river which flows from or before the divine throne. \"A river of fire was flowing and coming out from before him. Thousands of thousands were serving him, and myriads of myriads were attending him The court sat in judgement and the books were opened.\"17The passage in tractate Hagigah is concerned with the question of the origin of this river and its ultimate destination. The text states that the river flows from the sweat of the ḥayyot, the four divine creatures supporting God's throne in the visions in Ezekiel 1 and Isaiah 6.18 Rav Zutra bar Tuvia adds that the river pours out in the end on the head of sinners in Hell. Later on in the Hagigah passage, after an intervening discussion, Shmuel states: רבה לבקרים חדשים\" 'שנ ובטלי שירה אמרי ,דינור מנהר מלאכי אלפי תליסר מיברו יומא כל\".אמונתך19Every single day twelve-thousand ministering angels are created from the river of fire, sing praises and are destroyed, as it says: \"they are renewed every morning: ample is your faithfulness (Lam 3:23).\"There is not a marked difference between the language of the talmudic passage and that of theŠGW's citation.20 However, the significance of the images is quite different. Rather than being a mark of divine violence, for instance, the angels' continual creation and destruction isa sign of God's faithfulness. The prooftext from Lamentations bears out this interpretation. There, despite God's wrath at the peoples' transgressions and his destruction of the Temple and Jerusalem, the poet places his hope in the abundance of divine mercy, which is renewed every dawn.21 The same process is at work on the cosmic scale: like day follows night, the 17.Daniel 7:10.

A similar characterization of divine violence against angels can be found in a second citation at ŠGW 14:75-78. This citation describes God's punishment of the innocent with the sinners and the angels' suppressed objection to this evident injustice. (75) u han jā aβar drāišni i x́ǝ̄š gōeṯ (76) ku \"mǝn jumē ram i gunāhkārą caṇdą amar agunāhą aβazaṯ.\" (77) ka frīstagą aβǝ̄cim kunišnī vas guft aigiš guft ku \"aomǝn hom ādīnō i kāmaa x́adāe (78) u aβargar u anahambidī u kāmkār u kas nǝ̄ aiiārǝṯ aβar mǝn drǝṇžašni guftan.\"(75) And in that place it says about his incoherent speech: (76) \"'I have struck down the flock of the sinners along with countless innocents.' (77) When the an-gels protested that this is an act without reason, he said: 'I am Ādīnō,24 the Lord all-powerful, (78) supreme, without rival, absolute, and no one dares to speak against me.'\"Here the angels who would resist the divine injustice are, though the citation does not make this point explicitly, suppressed by the declaration of God's power. This declaration is, of course, ironic, given that it comes at the end of two chapters devoted to demonstrating the limitations and contradictions of that power. Nevertheless, it does show God's triumph, at thevery least, over the angels. Again, the ŠGW depicts the angels in a subservient position, under God's thumb if not literally under his throne. The Talmudic parallel scholars have identified for this citation is far from exact and for this reason I will refrain from citing it in full. BT Sanhedrin 38b relates that when God wished to create humankind, he first asked the opinion of the ministering angels. The angels,22.BT Hagigah 14a according to MS. Munich 6.23.Genesis Rabbah 88:1 (Theodor and Albeck, Bereshit Rabba, 2:916) includes a different objection, that the Bible elsewhere describes angels, like the one who struggled with Jacob, who are not destroyed with the dawn. 24.On the name Ādīnō see Chapter Two.- 62 -"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"considering this proposal, asked what human deeds would be. When they were told—and theTalmudic text does not clarify exactly what information God conveyed—they advised that humankind was not worthy of creation. God destroyed this group of angels; a second group he created met with the same fate. However, regarding the third group the text states: שלך כולו העולם כל ?הועילו מה ,לפניך שאמרו ראשונים ,שלעולם רבונו\" :לפניו אמרה שלישית כת הפלגה דור ואנשי המבול דור אנשי שהגיעו כיון \".עשה ,בעולמך לעשות רוצה שאתה כל .הוא כי אנוש מה' :לפניך ראשונים אמרו יפה לא ,שלעולם רבונו\" :לפניו אמרו ,מקולקלין שמעשיהם ואני אשא ואני עשיתי אני אסבול אני שיבה ועד הוא אני זקנה ועד\" :ה'הקב להן 'אמ \"'?'וג תזכרנו\".ואמלט אסבול25The third band said to him: \"Master of the world, the first [angels] who spoke to you, what benefit did they bring? The entire world is yours. Everything you wantto do in your world, do.\" When the generation of the flood and the generation of the [linguistic] dispersion whose actions are accursed arrived, they said to him: \"Master of the world, did not the previous ones speak rightly to you: 'What is a human being that you are mindful of him, [a son of man that you care for him]'\"? (Psalms 8:5) He said to them: \"Until you grow old I am the one; and when you grow gray, I will bear you. I have done it, and I will carry you; I will bear you, andI will save you\" (Isaiah 46:4).26Confronted with the reality of the evil deeds of humanity which preceded the flood, as described in Genesis 6:5, and the hubris of the builders of the tower of Babel, as described in Genesis 9:4-7, the third group can no longer hold their tongues. They agree with the previousbands of angels that it would have been better for humankind never to have been created.As discussed by Philip Alexander, the exegetical impetus behind this verse is the problem of the use of the plural in Genesis 1:26 when God says \"let us make man in our image, according to our likeness.\" As is attested elsewhere in rabbinic literature,27 the Bavli solves the problem of these plurals, which would seem to compromise divine unity, by sayingthat God consulted with the angels before embarking on the creation of humankind. Interest-ingly, in light of the version in the ŠGW, the angelic advice is dismissed out of hand. As Alexander states, \"the story appears to introduce the angels only to denigrate them.\"2825.The citation of the Talmud follows the version in the Yemenite manuscript Yad Harav Herzog 1.

While idols only move when carried by their worshipers, God carries his people through their times of trouble from infancy to old age.29 This verse lends the talmudic passage an entirely opposite meaning from the ŠGW's citation. In the Talmud, God is the figure protecting humankind from the angels' dismissal, if not destruction. In the ŠGW, on the other hand, the roles are reversed: it is God himself who seeks injustice and the angels who are powerless to stay his hand. While the hierarchy of power is essentially the same, the ethical orientation of the members of that hierarchy is reversed. The final citation I will discuss is actually presented first in the ŠGW. The citation, which demonstrates the God's inability to control human destiny, appears at ŠGW 14:58-70. I have chosen to address it last because its characterization of suppressed angels is the most ambiguous.

It is interesting to note that the anonymous tenth century New Persian translation of Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Ṭabarī's commentary on the Qurʾān includes a version of this story very close to 3 Enoch's. There, in a comment to Qurʾān 2:30, three angels, Gabriel, Michael, and Azriel, are sent in succession to the land on which will one day stand Mecca in order to gather clay from which to create the first man. The earth tells each of these angels in turn of human beings' future bloodshed and destruction. The first two angels return to heaven empty-handed having refused to carry out their task. It is only Azriel who, claiming the superiority of God's command, takes up the earth to heaven.

(74) This as well, that the throne that he announces: \"I will give it in heaven,\" is not a product of his work and creation.In his critique, Mardānfarrox interprets the angel as a messenger of God; the angel's speech and actions reflect God's own power and capabilities. As he is portrayed in this pas-sage, God cannot have the power befitting an omnipotent and omniscient deity. God is unable to change the fate of the suffering saint and his family. Moreover, even if he were to destroy the heavens and fashion them anew, he is ignorant of whether this change would result in a better or worse situation.34 As the wife remarks, a chair leg in this world, even a jeweled one, is cold comfort when, in eternity, one will be left with a broken throne. The wife's reference to their heavenly company points to shame as a driving force in her refusal toaccept the chair leg; this theme also appears in the talmudic parallel.3531.MS.

The distinction, as Schäfer notes, is one of different modes of existence. The Shekhinah, often translated as the Divine Presence, \"refers primarily to his presence on earth, as distinct from his presence in heaven.\" (Peter Schäfer,The Hidden and Manifest God: Some Major Themes in Early Jewish Mysticism [Albany: State University of New York Press, 1992], 89). The interchangeability of God and the Divine Presence in parallel passages,as noted by Scholem, is further evidence of the two entitites' identity.

He struck me with his finger bone on my forehead and said to me, 'Elazar my son, I have shot an arrow at you.'\"In their context in the Bavli, both these stories are included in a narrative chain of tales about poverty stricken but righteous believers.46 The underlying thematic connections are apparent. Hanina ben Dosa and Elazar ben Pedat both give up divine aid in this world forthe sake of their heavenly reward. In both cases the aid they would receive here is less than satisfactory: a golden table leg is a far cry from a table, for all its value, and, as in the ŠGW, the destruction and recreation of the world is no guarantee of Elazar ben Pedat's richness nexttime. Unlike the ŠGW, however, Elazar ben Pedat's decision to make do with his rewards in the world to come is at least as much dependent on the practical calculation of his lifespan as it is on the certainty or uncertainty of a better fate. Moreover, the sage's refusal of the possi-bility of earthly riches, calculated though it may be, is itself rewarded by further pleasures in the next world; no such reward is made available to the sage in the ŠGW.The character of the angel in the ŠGW story is foregrounded in comparison with the Talmud's narratives. While in Hanina ben Dosa's story one assumes that it is an angel who offers the golden chair leg, the only appearance of this angel is as a disembodied hand descending from heaven. In the second story there is no angel at all; Elazar ben Pedat con-verses with God himself. In the ŠGW, rather than being God's silent, (mostly) unseen, and, inthe second tale, absent minion, the angel makes a distinction between himself and God. While God has not apportioned a better lot for the suffering sage, the angel offers the throne leg as compensation. Similarly, it is the angel in his second appearance, who explains that, though he has the power to destroy the heavens, he cannot guarantee a better lot. In the Talmud's version, Hanina ben Dosa himself realizes the provenance and significance of the table leg. Again, while we cannot exclude the possibility, there is no explicit statement that the angel is conveying God's message or, more importantly, offering an estimation of the lim-itations of God's own power rather than his own. Though Mardānfarrox does use this citationto demonstrate the Jewish God's powerlessness over the motions of heavenly bodies and the human fates they control,47 in the citation itself it is far from clear that the angel's power and God's can be collapsed into one. The subservience of angels to God is, of course, present in Talmudic narratives just asit is in the ŠGW; in the stories mentioned above and others which could be cited, this theme is foregrounded.48 However, rabbinic literature also contains depictions of angels' vast powerwhich, in some cases, can even be confused with the power of the divine. These positive descriptions are precisely what is missing in the ŠGW. Even in those cases where angels are given more power than in the Talmudic parallels, particularly in the story of the suffering 46.This narrative chain is discussed in Hasan-Rokem, \"Folk Narratives.\" For an analysis of the redaction history of the Hanina ben Dosa stories see Tal Ilan, Massekhet Ta'anit: Text, Translation and Commentary (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2008), 254-58. 47.ŠGW 14:71-73.48.On angels in rabbinic literature see the discussion in Urbach, The Sages, 135-83; Peter Schäfer, Rivalität zwischen Engeln und Menschen: Untersuchungen zur rabbinischen Engelvorstellung.

In this way we can hear the angel's final comment to the suffering sage as tinged with sorrow: even if I refashioned the world, I cannot guarantee that you would end up better off. MetatronMore than simply an interesting thematic connection between these narratives, the prevalence of angelology and the particular characterization of weak angels in the ŠGW is arresting in light of what we know of the role of angels in late antique Judaism.49 As dis-cussed in a recent essay by Daniel Boyarin, a theology which ascribed vast powers and authority to angelic beings was widespread among Jews in this period and after.50 One facet of this theology was the belief that a heavenly figure known as Metatron served as God's coequal, sharing his power, bearing his name, sitting on a divine throne, and officiating as a heavenly High Priest; he was the Son of Man and Prince of the Divine Presence.51 Forms of this belief in the near-divine power of Metatron appear in the mystical collections which havecome down to us, a body of texts known collectively as heikhalot literature,52 and in the Babylonian Talmud. In a number of passages, in particular a seminal text in BT Hagigah 15a,this theology is characterized as a belief in \"two powers in heaven\"53 and explained as orig-inating in a misinterpretation of a mystical vision by the rabbinic apostate and arch-heretic Elisha ben Abuya, also known as Aḥer, the Other. In the company of three other early rab-binic sages, Ben Azzai, Ben Zoma, and Rabbi Akiva, Elisha ben Abuya entered the divine enclosure known as the pardes.54 While each of the sages was effected in a different way—only Rabbi Akiva escaped unscathed—the story states that Elisha \"chopped down the shoots.\" The text explicates this laconic statement:49.I am including, here, the first Islamic centuries within the period of late antiquity.

He saw that Metatron had been given permission to sit for an hour a day and write the good deeds of Israel. He said: \"We have a tradi-tion that in heaven there is no standing and no sitting, no jealousy and no competi-tion, no back and no tiredness.56 Perhaps, heaven forfend, there are two powers!\" They took Metatron and hit him with sixty lashes of fire. He [Metatron] was giv-en permission to remove the good deeds of Aḥer. A Heavenly Voice came out and said \"'Return backsliding Children' (Jeremiah 3:14), except for Aḥer.\"Upon seeing Metatron sitting in the role of divine judge and recording the good deeds of Israel, a function which should be reserved only for God, Elisha arrived at the mistaken con-clusion that Metatron was the divine coequal. In order to demonstrate his subservience to thedivine, Metatron is administered lashes.57 Elisha ben Abuya, for his part, was forced out of the rabbinic fold; it is at this point that he acquires the moniker Aḥer.58Previous scholars have, following the Talmud's lead, characterized the \"two powers\" doctrine as a heresy. In this scheme, the rabbinic texts, which ascribe to a stricter, though not absolute, monotheism, are contrasted with these mystical doctrines which at some point devi-ated from the mainline of Jewish orthodoxy.59 These scholars characterize the belief in an angelic coregent as secondary, belated, and marginal.Boyarin, however, argues persuasively that this characterization is a misrepresenta-tion. Following the model of recent research on Christian heresy, he makes the salient point that most of the doctrines labeled as \"heresies\" are actually part of the main body of the reli-gion itself: \"almost always the so-called 'heresy' is not a new invader from outside but an integral and usually more ancient version of the religious tradition that is now being dis-55.The text is quoted according to MS.

When the Talmud, in the famous passage in Hagigah mentioned above and elsewhere, casts this doctrine as heretical by putting it in the mouth of sectarians, it is an attempt to excise a widespread, popular, and thor-oughly \"Jewish\" belief.61 Rabbinic theology, in this conception, is only one aspect, and not by any means the most important, of a \"polymorphous Judaism.\" To read back from the rabbis' later supremacy a march of triumphant rabbinic orthodoxy beginning in antiquity is merely to relate history as the winners wish it to be told. As Boyarin summarizes his posi-tion, if these traditions about Metatronrepresent indeed the common religious heritage of much of Israel— again, not all—and not particular sectarian formations, as I am convinced they do, then the evidence just offered for such theology in the heart of the rabbinic socio-cultural world is rendered even more cogent. I would go so far as to suggest (but in a very tentative and preliminary fashion) that on the basis of the rabbinic material ad-duced it is the Son of Man, Enoch, Metatron, Christ, who is always at issue when \"Two Powers in Heaven\" is broached in rabbinic literature. The talmudic Rabbis, it would seem, sought, if not surely to get rid of Metatron, to ensure that Jews not regard him as in any sense a second, even if lesser, version of YHWH.62Two Powers in the ŠGWGiven this widespread belief in angelic co-regency, how should we interpret the weak,oppressed, and abused angels who populate these three citations in the critique of Judaism? In certain ways, the depiction of powerless angels in the ŠGW is reminiscent of the delegit-imization of the \"two powers\" doctrine in rabbinic literature. One answer to the question posed above, then, could be that the ŠGW is, in the end, borrowing from traditions circulatingin rabbinic circles. In these traditions, the role of angels would already have been degraded and they would arrive at Mardānfarrox ready-made, as it were. According to this model, the 60.Boyarin, \"Beyond Judaisms,\" 325.61.On the continuity of these beliefs in the period of the Geonim—that is to say, roughly contemporaneous with Mardānfarrox—and Geonic responses see Brody, Geonim, 142-47 and the sources quoted there. Karaite texts also condemn belief in angels—including Metatron—magic and mystical speculation, all of which they identify with the rabbis and their followers. See the discussion of the tenth century scholar al-Qirqisanī in Jacob Mann, Texts and Studies in Jewish History and Literature (Cincinnati: Hebrew Union College, 1931), 2:55-57; George Vajda, \"Etudes sur Qirqisani: la magie, la mantique et l'astrologie selon le 'Livre des lumieres et des vigies,'\" Revue des Études Juives 106 (1946): 87-123; and Fred Astren, Karaite Judaism and Historical Understanding (Columbia, SC: University of South Carolina Press, 2004), 72-76. The Jewish belief in Metatron is also noted by Muslim authors. See al-Masʿudi's analysis of the belief in Adang, Muslim Writers, 100-1. Abū Muḥammad ʿAlī ibn Aḥmad ibn Saʿīd ibn Ḥazm, the tenth century Andalusian writer and polemicist also mentions the Jewish belief in Metatron, \"by which they mean the smaller God.\" See the discussion in Lazarus-Yafeh, Intertwined Worlds, 31-32. Martin Schwartz notes that Metatron, spelled mīṭaṭrūn, also appears in the Kitāb ar-Raḥmat fī aṭ-Ṭibb wa-'l-Ḥikmat by the fifteenth century Egyptian polymath Jalāl ad-Dīn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān as-Suyūtī.

In this case, this depiction would have little relevance to the compositional structure or theological goals of the ŠGW itself. There is, however, a second and, to my mind, more compelling reading. Rather than seeing the degradation of the angels in the ŠGW citations as deriving from a previous demo-tion of angelic power already having taken place in rabbinic texts or among rabbinic circles, one can read these as two parallel processes. Both texts, rabbinic and Zoroastrian, alter cer-tain widely circulating angelological traditions to suit their own ideological purposes. While the rabbis are engaged in a theological contest with the \"two powers\" doctrine itself, the ŠGW depicts downtrodden angels for a different reason, connected with the overall goal of the critique of Judaism. Judaism is included in the ŠGW and given the considerable attention it merits not for its own sake or for the dangers it might pose as an attractive doctrinal alternative to wayward Zoroastrian youth.63 Rather, Judaism—along with, though differently than, Islam—repre-sents the theological challenge of monotheism to Zoroastrian dualism. In ŠGW Chapter Ten, a summary of the logical demonstration of the rationality of Zoroastrian dualism and an introduction to the critiques of the revealed religions in the second half of the work, Mardān-farrox discusses a rubric under which he organizes the dogmas and beliefs he describes. ŠGW 10:39-42 reads:(39) yak ą kǝ gōǝṯ ku hamā nǝ̄kī u anāī i pa gǝ̄hą ǝž yazaṯ. (40) yak ą kǝ gōǝt ku hamā nǝ̄kī i gǝ̄hą ōmǝ̄dica i pa ruuą buxtan ǝž yazaṯ, (41) u hamā anāī i tan bīmica i ruuą ǝž āharman vahąn.

(42) All is from theapportionment of these two fundamental principles which become parted and divided.64This schematized division is, of course, not a full representation of the theologies addressed in the critique. Manichaeanism is also a dualistic religion, though its materialist dualism and logically contradictory notion of infinity65 are attacked by Mardānfarrox. Christianity is, like Judaism, a monotheistic faith. However this monotheism, at least in the eyes of the author of the ŠGW, is compromised by the doctrines of the Trinity, the critique of which takes up the majority of the chapter on Christian belief.66 The ŠGW's treatment of Islam attacks the same 63.At ŠGW 10:78-79 Mardānfarrox states that his book is aimed at new Zoroastrian initiates (nō-āmōžagą) in order to inform their judgement about rival faiths.

In any event, if Judaism, like Islam, is to serve as the foil to Zoroastrian dualism, it has to be rendered monotheistically extreme: there is no space in this heaven for another power.68The motif of powerless, oppressed, destroyed, and silenced angels in the ŠGW might be a means of suppressing the kind of doctrines of angelic power, represented by the belief in the divine coequal Metatron, that would compromise Judaism's absolute monotheism. In light of this hypothesis, a number of the details in the passages above can be seen to gain newsignificance. The figure of the throne in particular, which appears in two of the citations, can be read in a new light. In ŠGW 14:34, the angels struggle and sweat under the weight of the divine throne. The same word used in that context, Pazand taxt, is also used to designate the jeweled throne in the citation in 14:58-70. Unlike the talmudic parallel, it is a leg of this throne, not a table leg, which the angel presents to the suffering saint in recompense for his poverty and piousness. This repetition is significant in light of the role that the divine throne plays in Jewish esoteric speculation,69 in particular in the context of the \"two powers\" doctrine. The biblical Book of Daniel, where the image of the river of fire originally appears and which underlies the Talmud's discussion of angelic destruction and regeneration in trac-tate Hagigah, is the site of considerable speculation on the \"two powers\" doctrine. Daniel 7:9, mentioned only in passing above, contains the following description: כָּרְ סְיֵהּ ,נְקֵא כַּעֲמַר רֵ אשֵׁהּ שׂוְּעַר ,חִוָּר כִּתְלַג לְבשׁוֵּהּ ;יְתִב ,יוֹמִין וְעַתִּיק ,רְ מִיו כָרְ סָוָן דִּי עַד ,הֲוֵית חָזֵה:דָּלִק נוּר גַּלְגִּוֹלּהִי ,נוּר-דִּי שְׁבִבִיןAs I looked on, thrones were set up, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was as white as snow, and the hair of his head was like clean fleece. His throne was fiery flames, with wheels of blazing fire.It is the verse immediately following which describes the river of fire we find in BT Hagigah and the ŠGW. Another throne is mentioned only a few verses later, in Daniel 7:13-14:)13 וּקְדָמוֹהִי מְטָה יוֹמַיָּא עַתִּיק-וְעַד הֲוָא אָתֵה אֱנָשׁ כְּבַר שְׁמַיָּא עֲנָנֵי-עִם וַאֲרוּ לֵילְיָא בְּחֶזְוֵי הֲוֵית חָזֵה () :הַקְרְ בוּהִי14 עָלַם שָׁלְטָן שָׁלְטָנֵהּ יִפְלְחוּן לֵהּ ,וְלִשָּׁנַיָּא אֻמַּיָּא עַמְמַיָּא וְכ ֹל וּמַלְכוּ וִיקָר שָׁלְטָן יְהִב וְלֵהּ (:תִתְחַבַּל לָא-דִּי ,וּמַלְכוּתֵהּ יֶעְדֵּה לָא-דִּי67.ŠGW 11:3-5.68.This \"monotheization\" of Judaism tracks nicely against Shaul Shaked's notion of Zoroastrianism's emphasison dualism as arising out of polemical contacts.

When he arrived where the Ancient of Days was, he was brought into his presence. Then to him was given dominion—glory and kingship. Every nation, tribe, and tongue must serve him; His dominion is to be everlasting, never passing away; his kingship is never to be destroyed.70The thrones which are described in Daniel 7:9 were read in various Talmudic and other contexts as being the seats for two divine powers, the Son of Man and the Ancient of Days described in 7:13-14. The issue of multiple thrones arises in a passage from BT Hagi-gah 14b. In that text Rabbi Akiva, who figures as one of the four sages who appears in the Metatron tradition from BT Hagigah 15a cited above, reads the thrones in Daniel 7:9 as the seats of the Ancient of Days and King David; David is, if not identical with the Son of Man, likewise ensconced in messianic speculation. Rabbi Akiva's reading of the two thrones—which, as Boyarin and others have rightly observed, is likely not a genuine tradition of the second century Palestinian sage71—is attacked for his position by Rabbi Yose the Galilean. The Talmud states that Akiva did recant and follow Rabbi Yose in identifying the thrones as those of God's justice and mercy.72 The figure of the throne is also a crucial element in the story of Elisha ben Abuya's mystical apostasy on the next page of tractate Hagigah. That passage and, more clearly, the parallel source in the late Hebrew mystical text 3 Enoch73 both explain Elisha ben Abuya's mistaken conclusion that Metatron is the divine coequal on the basis of the sage's observationthat Metatron was seated. While in the talmudic version this fact is obscured,74 the Enochic text stages the issue front and center. As Metatron himself recounts the event:When Aḥer came to behold the vision of the merkabah [the divine chariot] and set eyes on me, he was afraid and trembled before me. His soul was alarmed to the point of leaving him because of his fear, dread and terror of me, when he saw me seated upon a throne like a king, with ministering angels standing beside me like servants, and all the Princes of Kingdoms crowned with crowns surrounding me.Then he opened his mouth and said: \"There are indeed two powers in heaven!\" Immediately a heavenly voice came out from the presence of the Shekhinah and said: \"Return, backsliding children,\" (Jeremiah 3:14) except for Aḥer!\"75Elisha ben Abuya is led astray precisely by the fact that Metatron is sitting on the throne, in the role of prince and judge. This image looks back directly to the passage from Daniel discussed above. Moreover, while there has been much speculation on this topic, it 70.The translation of both these passages follows Hartman and Di Lella, Daniel, 203.71.Boyarin,\"Beyond Judaisms,\" 341.72.Boyarin,\"Beyond Judaisms,\" 336-42.73.Philip Alexander, \"The Historical Setting of the Hebrew Book of Enoch,\" Journal of Jewish Studies 28 (1977): 165-66 argues for a date between the fifth and ninth centuries CE in Babylonia.74.See the discussion in Boyarin, \"Beyond Judaisms\", 346-52.

Odeberg suggests that the name derives from the Greek hō meta thronon, \"the throne next to [the Divine] throne\" or \"the second throne.\"76 In this context, the metonymic function of the throne as being somehow representative of the essence of the angel is most intriguing. The centrality of the figure on the throne and the throne itself for speculation about two powers in heaven and an angelic coequal with the divine casts the references to thrones in the ŠGW in a new light. If the throne represents angelic power and equality with the divine, the depiction of angels being crushed under the throne is a reversal of that symbolism.An angel on the throne is coequal with God; angels underneath, sweating and bearing the burden of his weight, are nothing more than slaves, abject and powerless. In rabbinic texts the sweating angels, of course, signify something else entirely. However, Mardānfarrox's reading of this citation in the ŠGW is perfectly correct. Taken on its own and outside of the context of a living tradition of mystical and angelic speculation, it represents only the oppres-sion of the powerless angels by a cruel God. While this point is more speculative, the angel handing the leg of a heavenly throne can also be read fruitfully as a kind of metonymy for angelic power repressed. Not only is the throne broken into pieces, but the piece that the angel can pass on to the suffering saint is ineffective and impotent. It cannot change their lot and is a poor replacement for the power, which the angel admits he lacks, to restructure the world so as to guarantee a better fate. This is no Metatron recounting, as he does in 3 Enoch, that \"I was sitting on a great throne at the door of the seventh palace and I judged all the denizens of the heights, the familia of the Omnipresent, on the authority of the Holy One, blessed be he.\"ConclusionIn the citations discussed in this chapter, angels play a prominent role. In all three citations they are central characters crucial to Mardānfarrox's critique. Compared to their Talmudic parallels, these angels are powerless and downtrodden. Rather than imagining that these citations in the critique of Judaism derive directly from the Talmud, as previous schol-ars have claimed, I have argued that the prominence and degradation of the angels in these texts points to the ŠGW's engagement with and inversion of a Jewish belief in angels whose power equals the divine. The impetus for this inversion is internal to the ŠGW, relating to its goal of showing the First Scripture as monotheistically extreme.In this chapter I have identified the connections between these three citations and reading them together as part of a motif of angels. This serves my overall argument in that it demonstrates that the citations in the critique of Judaism are best interpreted contextually, in light of the larger theological and polemical goals of the ŠGW. In the next chapter, I will 76.This opinion is cited and dismissed in Scholem, Major Trends, 69 and Alexander, \"Historical Setting,\" 162. Boyarin, \"Beyond Judaisms,\" 356, on the other hand, supports this theory. A similar etymology derives the name from Greek sunthronos, in the sense of \"co-occupant of the divine throne.\" This etymology has been supported in Saul Lieberman, \"Metatron, the Meaning of His Name and His Functions,\" in Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism, ed. Ithamar Gruenwald (Leiden: Brill, 1980), 235-41 and Schäfer, Hidden and Manifest God, 94. These and other etymologies are discussed in Andrei A.

The entire chapter is devoted to a two-part citation and Mardānfarrox's critique of it. The citation bears a striking resemblance to the story of hexameral creation andthe garden of Eden as told in the first three chapters of the biblical book of Genesis. The firstpart of this citation, ŠGW 13:5-13, recounts the primordial state; the creation and separation of light from darkness; and, in an abbreviated form in 13:12, the creation of the heavens and the earth during the remaining six days of creation. This section also makes reference to God's rest on the seventh day. In his critique of this section, Mardānfarrox attacks the contra-dictions and inconsistencies he identifies in the creation account. For example, he asks: if nothing else existed, to whom did God give the command \"Let there be light\" (13:78-91)? Likewise, he asks if God only spoke creation into being, why did it take six days to complete the process (13:92-101)?The second part of the citation is much longer, comprising ŠGW 13:15-47, and con-cerns the story of temptation and exile in the garden parallel to Genesis Chapters Two and Three. Separated from the previous section by a comment concerning the Jews' resting on the Sabbath (13:14) that acts as a kind of caesura, this part of the citation concerns the cre-ation of the first human couple, the garden, and the tree of knowledge, their transgression, punishment, and exile. In his critique, at 13:106-148, Mardānfarrox focuses considerable attention on this section of the citation. He questions, for instance, why God created the garden in the first place, if it only served as the means for the first couple's downfall (13:121-127); why God was sorrowful about the humans' gaining knowledge but content withtheir ignorance (13:135-140); and points to the citation's characterization of God as ignorant (13:141-142) and mendacious (13:143-144).This chapter will focus on this garden citation, as I will refer to ŠGW 13:15-47 in what follows.1 The chapter will be concerned with answering a basic question, namely identifying the reason why the story of the garden is given such prominence in the critique of Judaism: not only is this citation the longest in the entire critique, but Mardānfarrox also devotes nearly fifty sentences to its analysis and critique. Why is the garden citation, this story of Adam, Eve, and the serpent, so central to Mardānfarrox's critique? At first glance, the answer to this question may seem obvious. 1.My justification for focusing only on this second part of the extended citation in Chapter Thirteen is twofold. On the one hand, while the first section of the citation has recently merited renewed study by Shapira, \"Biblical Quotations\", the second section, what I am calling the garden citation, has not received the attention it deserves. On the other hand, while inarguably connected to the first section on hexameral creation, the garden citation is marked off as a self-enclosed literary unit. The distinction between these two sections is easiest to see in Mardānfarrox's critique: ŠGW 13:49-105 focuses exclusively on the story ofcreation in seven days while ŠGW 13:106-148 on the garden. While Mardānfarrox precedes eclectically within his comments on each section, for instance first discussing God's lack of knowledge concerning the whereabouts of the first human couple after they ate the fruit (ŠGW 13:135-140) and then turning to his creation of the serpent (ŠGW 13:141-142), he never mixes comments on the two sections, such as first discussing an aspect of the garden story and then an aspect of the story of creation.- 77 -"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Whatever the genealogy of Mardānfarrox's citations, by the time of the composition of the ŠGW it was widely known that the story of temptation and punishment in the garden was to be found in the Jewish scriptures. Part of the evidence for the wide diffusion of this knowl-edge can also be used to explain why Mardānfarrox chose to focus on this story. Earlier polemics against the Jewish scriptures, especially Marcionite and Manichaean texts, also devote a great deal of attention to this garden narrative. It is possible that the garden citation is prominent in the ŠGW because Mardānfarrox was familiar with and used these earlier polemics as a models.While Marcion's Antitheses is itself lost, scholars have been able to reconstruct much of its argument from citations in the works of Christian heresiologists.2 The Antitheses, which lists the contradictions between the Old Testament and Marcion's versions of the Gospel and Paul's letters, refers to God's ignorance of Adam's whereabouts in the garden of Eden story.3 Ḥīwī al-Balkhī, the Jewish rationalist and contemporary of Mardānfarrox, whomprevious scholars have identified as a Marcionite,4 also refers to the story of the garden of Eden. Ḥīwī asks why God did not know where Adam was hiding after eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge5 and refers to God's fear that Adam would also eat from the fruit of the treeof life.6 In Manichaean literature, which sometimes took over Marcionite arguments,7 the story of the garden also plays a prominent role. In light of the connection other scholars havedemonstrated between the ŠGW and Manichaean literature,8 the Manichaean polemics against the Eden story are especially interesting. It is possible that Mardānfarrox concen-trates on the garden narrative because of its prominence in Manichaean polemics. An exam-ple of the Eden narrative in Manichaean polemics can be found in in St. Augustine's anti-Manichaean writings. His two works on Genesis, De Genesi contra Manichaeos and De Genesi ad litteram libri duodecim,9 refer to and answer Manichaean attacks on the Eden 2.See especially the classic work of Adolf von Harnack, Marcion: Das Evangelium vom fremden Gott (Leipzig: J.

Ries, \"La Bible chez saint Augustine et chez les manichéens,\" Revue des études - 78 -"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"story. The Manichaeans ask, Augustine reports, why God made human beings if he knew they would sin and they complain that he should have created them unable to do so; they ask who made the devil—that is, the serpent—and they complain that the devil should not have been made if God knew he would sin; they complain that the devil should not have been allowed to approach Eve; and they complain that Eve herself should not have been created.10 Augustine precedes this brief recounting of Manichaean critiques with a long spiritual and allegorical interpretation of the garden of Eden story. This interpretation both demonstrates the right way to read the Bible and preemptively undermines Manichaean literalist readings.11However, the importance of the garden narrative in the ŠGW's critique of Judaism cannot be entirely explained by an appeal to earlier polemics against Genesis and the Eden story. Gardens have a significance in the ŠGW that goes beyond this one citation in the cri-tique of Judaism. The garden narrative in Chapter Thirteen is part of a larger motif of gar-dens. In three other passages in the ŠGW—two in the chapters on Islam and one in the chap-ter on Christianity—gardens are used to present the contradiction and irrationality of the beliefs of the rival religions. A final garden passage, an exegetical parable in ŠGW Chapter Four, uses garden imagery to demonstrate the truth of Zoroastrian theology. When taken together, these four passages contrast the order and coherence of Zoroas-trianism with the irrationality and contradiction of the rival religions. As I hope to demon-strate in what follows, in all four cases the garden is a model world, one of the tools Mardān-farrox uses to demonstrate the underlying similarity between the disparate false doctrines of Islam, Judaism, and Christianity and to set them all against Zoroastrian reason and rightness. Furthermore, I will argue that the reason that gardens were chosen for this model role is not—or, at least, not only—on account of the prominence of the Eden story in Jewish liter-ature and earlier polemical writings. Gardens have important symbolic value in Iranian cul-ture. In particular, the garden is connected with kingship, rule, and order. Mardānfarrox is drawing on this symbolism in the ŠGW's garden passages. Setting the contradiction of the rival doctrines in a garden makes them seem all the more incoherent. Similarly explaining anapparent contradiction in Zoroastrian theology through the means of the garden parable in ŠGW Chapter Four reinforces the order and coherence of Zoroastrianism.This chapter will precede in three stages. After presenting the garden citation from ŠGW 13:15-47, I will first discuss the two garden passages in the critiques of Islam and Christianity and demonstrate their commonalities with Chapter Thirteen's garden citation. Next, I will analyze the Zoroastrian garden parable and discuss its relation to the other pas-sages that make up the motif of gardens. Finally, I will discuss the significance of gardens in Iranian culture, emphasizing their connection with rule and political order.The Motif of the GardenWe can first turn to the garden citation from ŠGW 13:15-47:augustiniennes 9 (1963): 203-15; François Decret, Aspects du Manichéisme dans l'Afrique Romaine (Paris: Études Augustiniennes, 1970); the articles collected in Johannes Van Oort, et al., eds.

See Durkin-Meisterernst, DMMPP, 24 and 35. For the appearance of Adam and Eve in Manichaean literature see Werner Sundermann, \"Nomen um Göttern, Dämonen und Menschen in iranischen Versionen das manichäischen Mythos,\" Altorientalische Forschungen 6 (1979): 95-133. However, the Pazand versions are also similar to the forms found in the Qurʾān and Muslim exegesis: Ādam and Ḥawwāʾ. On these names see Horovitz, \"Jewish Proper Names and Derivatives in the Koran\" and William M. Brinner, \"Some Problems in the Arabic Transmission of Biblical Names,\" in Solving Riddles and Untying Knots: Biblical, Epigraphic and Semitic Studies in Honor of Jonas C. Greenfield, ed.

Anklesaria, eds., Pahlavi Texts, [Bombay: Fort Printing Press, 1913], 2:383).

The garden is described as pur walg, pur āb, pur mēwag, \"full of of leaves, full of water, full of fruit\" and būm ī wahištīg, \"the paradisiac land.\" See further the discussion in Martin Schwartz, \"Gathic Compositional History, Y 29 and Bovine Symbolism,\" in Paitimāna: Essays in Iranian, Indo-European, and Indian Studies in Honor of Hanns-PeterSchmidt, ed. Siamak Adhami [Contra Costa, CA: Mazda, 2003], 241-44. Bruce Lincoln, Religion, Empire and Torture (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2007), 79ff. has also pointed out the similarity between the description of paradise in the Ardā Wirāz Nāmag and a garden. In Manichaean texts, a garden (bwystʾn)is mentioned in a Manichaean Middle Persian king parable in M 47 II (verso, l. 3). The text is transcribed and translated in Werner Sundermann, Mittelpersische und parthische kosmogonische und Parabeltexte der Manichäer (Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1973), 87-89. The Parthian cognate, spelled bwdystʾn, appears in a Manichaean Parthian text from M 47 I (Werner Sundermann, Mitteliranische manichäische Texte kirchengeschichtlichen Inhalts [Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1981], text 10) describing the conversion of Mihrshah. Thanks to Desmond Durkin-Meisterernst for this reference.14.De Menasce reads this word as a denominative from an underlying Pahlavi pāsbān, meaning \"protector\" or \"guardian\" (de Menasce, Apologétique, 184; MacKenzie, CPD, 65; and Durkin-Meisterernst, DMMPP, 259). The word also appears in the Pahlavi translation to Psalms (Andreas and Barr, Psalmen, 106). The Sanskrit translation has praharakeṇaca, from prahakara- \"a watch\" or \"a division of time\" (Monier-Williams, Dictionary, 701). 15.De Menasce (following Darmesteter, \"Judaisme,\" 6) sees a lacuna in the text at this point, in which we are missing Hauuāe's statement that it is she, and not the snake, who will eat and give to Ādam (de Menasce, Apologétique, 194).16.Darmesteter amends to magar-at (Darmesteter, \"Judaisme\", 7).

(29) Then Ādīnō came into the garden, called Ādam by his name saying, \"Where are you?\" (30) Ādam answered, \"I am here under the tree for I am naked.\" (31) Ādīnō became an-gry. (32) He said, \"Who made you aware you that you were naked? (33) You have not eaten from the tree of knowledge which I said you were not to eat from, have you?\" (34) Ādam said, \"This woman whom you gave me deceived me and I ate.\" (35) And Ādīnō asked Hauuāe: \"Why did you do this?\" (36) Hauuāe said, \"The serpent deceived me.\" (37) And cursing all three, Ādam, Hauuāe, and the serpent, he expelled them from the garden. (38) And he said to Ādam, \"Your food will be by wiping your sweat and the breath of your nose (39) until the end of your life (40) and the earth will grow excrement and filth.\" (41) And he said to Hauuāe, Kosmogonische und Parabeltexte, 87.17.The Frahang ī Pahlavīg includes the Aramaic ideogram KPLWN, from the root qpl, meaning \"to roll up, roll away,\" for ōstardan or ustardan meaning to \"shave\" or \"to erase\" (Henrik Samuel and Bo Utas Nyberg, eds., Frahang i Pahlavīk [Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1988], 98). On the basis of the sense of the underlyingAramaic, de Menasce, Apologétique, 185 translates \"to wipe.\" However, this could be an instance of a polemical pun: Middle Persian āstārēn (from the same Proto-Iranian root *star) means \"to sin\" (Cheung, Etymological Dictionary, 363-64). Sanskrit āstarṇena, from the related root star-, means \"to spread out\" or\"extend\" (Monier-Williams, Dictionary, 161).18.According to the Pahlavi Videvdad, hixr is feces or dry dead matter, as distinguished from nasā which is wet; see especially 5:1-3 and 8:34. Interestingly, the Sanskrit translates hihir as mutra, meaning \"urine\" andkīmār as purīśana \"feces.\" (Monier-Williams, Dictionary, 636 and 825). At least in the case of mutra, the translator may have confused the Sanskrit word with Avestan mūθra, which does indeed mean \"feces.\" See Christian Bartholomae, Altiranisches Wörterbuch (Berlin: Walter de Gruyer, 1961), 1189.19.MSS.

(45) Between your children and the woman's will be such vengeance and enmity that they will bite the childrens' heads.\" One can recognize the well-remembered story of creation, temptation, transgression, and exile. The four sections of the ŠGW's citation follow the basic outline of the biblical narra-tive in the Book of Genesis. The story begins with Ādīnō populating the garden of paradise with Ādam, Hauuāe, and the serpent and laying down the rules for their interaction: Ādam must cultivate and protect the garden and the couple cannot eat the fruit of the tree of knowl-edge. Next comes the transgression. Hauuāe is persuaded by the serpent into eating the fruit of the forbidden tree. She passes the same fruit to Ādam. In the third section, their transgres-sion is revealed through their concealment of the shame of their nakedness. Finally, God metes out their punishment. All are banished from the garden and suffer the pains of labor and rejection. Similar though the ŠGW's citation is to the biblical version, Genesis 2:7-3:24, the story as told from God's creation of Adam to the exile from the garden, contains a number of details and themes not found in the ŠGW. In making the following brief comparison, I do notwish to upend the argument for a genealogical approach to the ŠGW's citations made in Chapter Two of this dissertation. Rather, my goal in contrasting the citation in Chapter Thir-teen with the parallel version in Genesis is simply to highlight the unique character of the ŠGW's garden narrative. For instance, Genesis includes at 2:8-14 a description of the geogra-phy of Eden; an extended description of the creation of Eve at 2:18-25; and a more extended description of the punishment borne by the first human couple at the end of Genesis chapter three. Another important difference is characterization. The ŠGW's narrative depicts Ādam,Hauuāe, and the serpent as flat characters lacking internal life and thought. By way of exam-ple, while Genesis 3:1-6 depicts at some length the serpent's temptation of Eve. The passage gives a window into her thought process and the workings of the serpent's arguments to breakdown her resistance. The ŠGW, in contrast, dispatches with this entire episode of persuasion,reasoning, and temptation in a single line. There, all the serpent has to say to Hauuāe is \"pickfrom this tree.\" This example is typical of the abrupt style of the ŠGW's citation which has implications for Mardānfarrox's critique of the passage. It is because she is depicted as pos-sessing this internal life, the ability to resist and succumb to temptation, that God's command and punishment have meaning at all. The fact that Hauuāe is not depicted as having the capacity for independent choice, makes it easier for Mardānfarrox to chracterize Ādīnō's pun-ishment is meaningless and cruel.22 22.The exception to the ŠGW's generally restricted depiction of the characters' internal lives is the passage at 13:26-28. There the text describes the couple's shame at their nakedness and their hiding and clothing themselves with leaves of the tree in order to conceal that shame. Aside from being necessary to advance the plot—they have to have some reason to hide in order for Ādīnō to go looking for them—there is a qualitative difference between shame and Eve's deliberation or Adam's choosing names for the animals and rejoicing at the presence of his wife. Whereas these other glimpses into the characters' thinking imply - 82 -"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"To return to our theme, as I indicated at the beginning of this chapter the garden cita-tion from the critique of Judaism is not the only horticultural passage in the ŠGW. The other polemics against the monotheistic religions also contain horticultural citations and reflectionson gardens and their significance. In what follows I will point to some of the lines of affinity between these gardens in words and ask how their interrelations shed light on the citation in Chapter Thirteen's critique of Judaism.The passage most closely connected to the account of the garden in Chapter Thirteen is found in Chapter Eleven's critique of Islam.

The story of the angel's refusal to worship Ādam is also similar to the story about the angels' protest at God's unjust punishment of innocents in ŠGW 14:75-79. The passage from Chapter Eleven is even closer to the story of the angels' opposition to the creation of humankind in BT Sanhedrin 38b, Genesis Rabbah 8:4 (Theodor and Albeck, Bereshit Rabba, 59-60) and elsewhere; for more context on this story see ChapterTwo. Another version of the story can also be found in Satan's account of his fall in the pseudepigraphic Life of Adam and Eve 12-16. See the translations of M. D.

Nickelsburg, \"The Bible Rewritten and Expanded: The Books of Adam and Eve,\" in Jewish - 84 -"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"There are a number of similarities between this citation and the garden passage from Chapter Thirteen. First of all, the two stories share key terms. Both refer to the garden as heavenly: in 13:16 as bāγastąnǝ̄ i vahǝ̄št and in 11:62 as bōstąn i vahǝ̄št. Bāγastąn and bōstąn are close synonyms, as is demonstrated by the fact that the same Sanskrit word udyāna is used to translate both.38 Both verses refer to the serpent as mār and use similar words to describe his actions, particularly forms of the verbs frǝ̄ftąn, meaning \"to deceive.\" The simple past form frǝ̄ft occurs at 13:22 and 13:34 and the adjective frǝ̄ftār at 11:65 and 11:69. The effects of eating the tree are also described in similar terms. 13:24-25 states that Adam ate (x́ard) and became knowledgeable (dānišni aβą būṯ) and distinguished good from evil (vazārd niiak ǝž vaṯ). Similarly, 11:72 states that after eating the fruit he became knowl-edgeable (pas ǝž x́ardan aβą dānišmaṇd būṯ) and that he recognized and knew good and evil (vahǝ u vatar šnaxt u dānast). God's response is also described as angry in both passages. In13:31 we find the phrase God became angry (ādīnō xašm kard) just as in 11:75 it states that God removed them from the garden of heaven with great anger and unkindness (aβā zami ǝ̄šān pa garą xašm u anāzarī ǝž vahǝ̄št bōstąn bǝ̄run kard).The two stories complement each other, together constructing a more complete account of the events in the garden. The story in Chapter Thirteen, laconic though it seems incomparison to the biblical account, provides much more detail than the version in Chapter Eleven. Whereas Chapter Eleven's narrative dismisses with the first couple's temptation, sin, discovery, and punishment in four brief sentences, Chapter Thirteen puts the characters, props, and dialogue in comparative focus; Chapter Eleven even lack's Ādam's wife's name. However, reading only Chapter Thirteen we do not know the serpent's motive for acting so maliciously towards Ādam and Hauuaē, the heavenly backstory to the events in the garden. What happened after their exile also goes unmentioned. The larger narrative arc within which the events in the garden take place is lacking. Chapter Eleven fills in the miss-ing pieces. Here, the reader learns that God's enmity for his creation applied already to his angels in heaven and he is told the deceiving trickster's motive for waylaying the first human couple. The first humans' gluttonous nature, which causes them to succumb to the trickster's temptation, is already formed and known by God before the events in the garden. Humankind's suffering at the hands of the deceptive trickster does not end with the punish-ment of Ādam and Hauuāe; the world as a whole is given over by God to his evil dominion.There are two points of seeming disagreement between the two accounts. In the first case, while Chapter Thirteen makes clear that it was a serpent who deceived the couple, the narrative in Chapter Eleven presents two alternative possibilities: some say that it was a ser-pent while others claim that it was Ahriman. Rather than reading the latter interpretation as a contradiction of the passage in the critique of Judaism, one can understand the presentation ofthese two possibilities as a device for more closely linking the versions of the story. The interpretation that names the trickster as Ahriman serves to connect the character of the trick-ster in the garden to the rebellious angel. Like the angel, Ahriman is an evil celestial being who torments God's creation here on earth.39 The other interpretation, identifying the trick-Writings of the Second Temple Period, ed. Michael E.

The fact that the two could be interchangeable raises the possibility that the serpent in Chapter Thirteen is no other than the outcast angel. This alternative identification further links the focused narrative in the critiqueof Judaism to the larger cosmic drama portrayed in the critique of Islam. Similarly, Chapter Eleven's statement that some believe Ādam was the one who was tricked and first ate the fruit of the tree does not imply a contradiction with Chapter Thirteen. The phrase hast kǝ ādam gōeṯ follows a formula common in Zoroastrian legal and commen-tary literature. It presents an alternative interpretation of a law or fact.40 In this case, the unstated base interpretation would be, as in Chapter Thirteen, that Hauuāe was the one tem-pted to eat the fruit. The opinion that it was Ādam represents an alternative, but not mutually exclusive, possibility. The other instances of the garden story are likewise complimentary. Further on in the critique of Islam,41 at 11:352-258, we read:(352) inca kǝ gōeṇd ku yazaṯ ō ādam farmūṯ ku ǝž īṇ yak draxt i aṇdar vahǝ̄št ma x́arǝ̄e.

(353) He asked them thus, (354) \"The command God gave to Ādam, 'From this tree do not eat,' was it good or bad?\" (355) If the command was good, it is evident that the tree was bad. (356) [But] it is not fitting that God wouldcreate something bad. (357) If the tree was good, the command was bad; but it is not fitting that God would issue a bad command. (358) If the tree was good and hegave the command not to eat it, then it is not befitting the goodness and mercy of God to revoke goodness from his own innocent servants. of the one God, who is thus ultimately responsible for evil. Ahriman, inherently evil, is preexistent in Zoroastrian cosmogony.40.See the discussion in Phillipe Gignoux, \"La controverse dans le mazdéisme tardif,\" in La controverse religieuse et ses formes, ed.

The critique picks on the point of God's command not to eat the fruit of one of the trees in the garden, mentioned in both versions of the story. The critique focuses on a logical con-tradiction at the center of the story: if God did not want Ādam to eat the fruit of the tree, why did he put it in the garden in the first place? Both placing the tree in the garden and com-manding them to refrain from touching it seems nothing more than a trap. As the critique points out, God necessarily contradicts his own nature; to be more accurate, we can say he contradicts the nature that monotheism claims for him. He is either the author of an evil cre-ation, the tree, which contradicts his absolute goodness, or he forbids the first man's enjoy-ment of a good creation which similarly depicts him, in Mardānfarrox's characterization, as cruel and merciless. The same critique is repeated, in a slightly different form, in Chapter Thirteen.48The importance of this passage lies in the metonymic relationship it establishes between the forbidden tree and the garden as a whole. God's command to avoid the tree of knowledge encapsulates the central ethical paradox of the narrative. The other ethically trou-blesome elements, such as God's allowing or letting the serpent into the garden, are only acti-vated as evil in their relation to the tree. Likewise, the tree itself stands for the entire garden. The tree is the only plant foregrounded and brought into narrative focus. In Genesis, in con-trast, figs also play a prominent role, as the leaves with which Adam and Eve cover their newly realized nakedness,49 as does the even more powerful tree of life which God aims to protect by finally evicting the couple from the garden.50 In the ŠGW's minimalist staging of the story, this one tree represents the fecundity, lushness, and verdancy of the garden as a whole which otherwise go unmentioned. The metonymic character of the tree of knowledge is relevant to the interpretation of two linked passages in Chapter Fifteen.51 While that chapter, devoted to the critique of Chris-tianity, does not include any discussions of gardens, it does contain two citations and cri-tiques of arboreal parables. The first passage is found in 15:132-141:(132) vaš īṇca guft ku nǝ̄ atū draxt i kerbaa bar i bažaa nǝ̄ ąca i52 bažaa bar i kerbaadādan (133) īṇca ku aiiå hamā draxt aβā bar i kerbaa kunǝṯ aiiå hamā draxt aβā bari bažaa kunǝṯ (134) ci har draxt ǝž bar pǝ̄dā bahōṯ agar kerbaa u agar bažaa (135) vaš hamā draxt guft nǝ̄ nīm draxt (136) nuṇ cuṇ sažǝṯ nīm draxt rōšan u nīm tār (137) nīm kerbaa u nīm bažaa (138) nīm rāstī u nīm drōžanī (139) ka īṇ har du aγanīn hambidī ǝstǝṇd (140) yak draxt būdan nǝ̄ šāiṇd.53 (132) And he also said this: \"The good tree is not capable of giving evil fruit, nor that of evil the good fruit.\" (133) This also: \"Either the entire tree produces good 48.ŠGW 13:110-113; 122; 132-134. 49.Genesis 3:7. 50.Genesis 3:22-24.

(136) Now how is it fitting that half a tree be light and half dark, (137) half good and half evil, (138) half righteous and half falsehood? (139) When these both op-pose each other, (140) they cannot exist as one tree.54 Mardānfarrox's comment on this passage is not, in fact, a critique. Rather, in empha-sizing that a single tree cannot be both good and evil, he is confirming and strengthening the point of the citation itself, which draws a sharply dualistic distinction between good and evil trees. Mardānfarrox's confirmation of this particular citation, however, does not imply approval of Christianity. This citation is part of a larger section focusing on Jesus' contradic-tory statements about dualism. In ŠGW 15:108-116, for instance, Mardānfarrox contrasts Jesus' statement that there is an enemy principle55 opposed to his Father56 to another statementthat Ahriman is bent on his destruction and desires to seduce and trick him.57 In his com-ment, Mardānfarrox argues that if, as the first statement implies, Ahriman is opposed to Jesusand of a different substance,58 there is no way for him to seduce or deceive him. On the otherhand, if Ahriman is of the same substance as Jesus, then he must have been created by God. Therefore, God, being omniscient, must have intended for Ahriman to deceive Jesus, in which case it is God himself who seeks to deceive his Son.59 In the case of the good and evil trees, Mardānfarrox is similarly aiming to emphasize the underlying contradiction between the sharply dualistic worldview expressed in the cita-54.De Menasce notes the parallels to Matthew 7:15-20, 12:33, and Luke 6:43-44. A closer parallel passage, however, is found in the Manichaean Kephalaia, chapter two. As translated from the Coptic by Timothy Pettipiece, the text reads:The good tree produces [good fruit,] and [the] evil tree produces bad fruit. [ . . . Neither is there a] good [tree] that produces bad fruit, [nor is there an evil tree that] produces good fruit. [Every tree is known by] its fruit.As Pettipiece states in his discussion of this section of the Kephalaia, the two trees are interpreted by Mani as representing the two fundamental opposing principles of good and evil. Each tree is said to have five limbs reflecting the five-fold nature of good and evil being and, at the same time, the five-fold path which leads to liberation or damnation. See Timothy Pettipiece, Pentadic Redaction in the Manichaean Kephalaia(Leiden: Brill, 2009), 21-24. Interestingly, both in the context of the Manichaean text and the general discussion of good and evil trees, this figure resembles the extended metaphor of a tree at ŠGW 1:11-20—likewise divided into trunks, branches, boughs, limbs, and twigs—that describes the underlying order of theuniverse and religion encapsulated in the concept of the dēn. For more on the Manichaean dualistic readingof the good/evil tree see J. Kevin Coyle, \"Good Tree, Bad Tree: The Matthean/Lukan Paradigm in Manichaeism and its Opponents,\" in The Reception and Interpretation of the Bible in Late Antiquity, ed. Lorenzo DiTommaso and Lucian Turcescu (Leiden: Brill, 2008), 121-44.55.ŠGW 15:109: han buniiaštaa dušman, identified with Ahriman.56.De Menasce, Apologétique, 224 relates this citation to Jesus' statements in John 12:31, 14:30-31, and 16:11 regarding the existence of the \"ruler of the world\" (hō tou kosmou arkhōn). For example, 14:30-31 reads: I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me; but I do as the Father has commanded me, so that the world may know that I love the Father. 57.De Menasce, Apologétique, 224 references the passages from the Gospel describing Jesus' temptation: Matthew 4:1-11, Mark 1:12-13, and Luke 4:1-13. 58.One of the basic physical and metaphysical principles of the ŠGW is that entities composed of opposing natures cannot interact or influence each other. This principle is demonstrated in Chapters Two through Four, Eight, and Nine.59.This section is briefly mentioned in Gignoux, \"Škand Gumânîg Vîzâr,\" 64-65.- 88 -"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"tion and the monotheistic belief in God as singular, good author of creation.

(144) It also says this: \"Every tree which the Father did not plant shall be uprooted and cast in the fire.\" (145) One can know from this statement that there is a tree which the father did not plant [which] must be uprooted and cast away.61 Both the reference to the evil of the Jews and the statement concerning trees planted by someone other than God the Father serve to emphasize Mardānfarrox's dualist interpreta-tion of Jesus' statements. However, aside from their function in their immediate context in the critique of Christianity, both these citations are also connected to the larger motif of the garden. Any mention of good and evil trees calls to mind the tree of knowledge from the garden narrative in Chapters Eleven and Thirteen. Just as the trees mentioned here are in their nature good or evil, the tree of knowledge which the first humans taste imparts the abil-ity to distinguish between the two. Were it not for the knowledge humans gained by eating from the tree in the garden, as it were, Jesus' arboreal dualism would be nonsensical. Other elements in this passage also look back to the story of the garden. The word used for serpent here, mār, is also used of the cunning trickster in Chapter Thirteen. The ref-erence to the serpents of the mountain resonates with the punishment of the serpent describedin ŠGW 13:42 that it will be cursed among the creatures of the mountains and the plains. Even the mention of Jews might be seen as pointing to the context of the earlier critique of Judaism. The order of citations here in Chapter Fifteen likewise echoes the structure of Thir-teen's garden narrative. There, the peace of the garden is disrupted by the appearance of the serpent that leads directly to punishment, pain and exile. Here, the two arboreal citations, which, even without considering the parallel texts from the New Testament, are clearly connected, are intersected by the serpentine citation. While the trees in the first citation are undamaged and healthily bearing fruit, after the appearance of the serpent the tree in the second citation is uprooted and cast into the fire. Disregarding, for a moment, the good or evil character of the trees involved, the serpent's intervention is followed by destruction, just as in the garden.Though Mardānfarrox's comment on Jesus' statement about good and evil trees cannotitself be taken as a critique of the passage cited in ŠGW 15:132-134, it does buttress one of the central critiques of the story of the garden. Mardānfarrox's comment is directed against 60.De Menasce, Apologétique, 220 amends xąndan.61.De Menasce, 224 notes the parallels to Matthew 3:7-10, 13:24-43 and John 8:39-47.- 89 -"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"moral and metaphysical ambiguity. Either the trees are good or the trees are bad; since these natures are absolutely opposed, there can be no moral speckles or spots. However, this is precisely the description of the tree in the garden. It is both good, imparting knowledge, and evil in as much as it is forbidden and associated with seduction and trickery. The true orien-tation of the tree, its true nature, is undecidable and unclear. Mardānfarrox picks on this moral ambiguity in his reading of the garden narrative. As mentioned above, the second hor-ticultural passage at ŠGW 11:353-358, and the critique of the garden citation at 13:121-130, address this same point. If the tree and the knowledge it imparts are good—and knowledge isa virtue—then why does God forbid the first human couple to eat of its fruit and why does he punish them so severely when they disobey? If the tree was bad, why did he put it in the garden in the first place, why did he let the serpent into the garden to tempt them to eat it and why, as it says in the first version in Chapter Eleven, did he give Ādam a gluttonous nature which made him easy prey for the serpent's trickery? The ambiguous position of the tree of knowledge shows up the contradictions and irrationalities of the garden story as a whole. As portrayed in the ŠGW, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity come across as separate doctrines, opposed to each other62 and divided from within,63 each adhering to its own set of confused beliefs. Accordingly, Mardānfarrox treats each doctrine differently. The critique of Islam concentrates the most on issues of free-will, ethics, divine unity. and justice—among the central concerns in Islamic rationalist theology—without recourse to much scriptural or narrative exposition. In the case of Judaism, the sacred text is the focus of attention; the theo-logical points arise as responses to the stories and statements the First Scripture itself con-tains. As for Christianity, the narrative of Jesus' birth and the contradiction between his divine and human natures frames the critique. Taken together, the horticultural references and allusions found in each of these cri-tiques constitute one of the tools Mardānfarrox uses to demonstrate the underlying similarity between these disparate doctrines. Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, despite their differences,perpetuate the same erroneous belief in good's compatibility with evil and one God's respon-sibility for both. It is this common error which Mardānfarrox sets out to expose and chal-lenge. In the same way, the three faiths are united by this foundational story of good and evil in the garden. The story, expressed in each of the critiques in a different way and to a differ-ent extent, is shared by all three. Moreover, Mardānfarrox's rational critique of monotheism works together with the garden narrative to unite these three critiques; they are not divorced mechanisms, running on parallel tracks, but rather symbiotically related, working in tandem. The narrative of the garden expresses Mardānfarrox's critique of monotheism, this theological point, in a dramatized form. It is a lens which focuses the contradiction, evil, irrationality, and stupidity of monotheism and contains them within a single event. The story of temptation and transgression, of God's willful ignorance or, even worse; his malicious intent, of Ādam, Hauuāe and the serpent, is a parable for monotheism's unreasonableness anderror. 62.Christianity's opposition to Judaism comes through in the citation from Chapter Fifteen above and other passages in that critique. 63.Different sects or groups within Islam are mentioned at ŠGW 11:205, 11:260, the Muʿtazilites specifically at 11:280, and sects generally at 12:31.

Chapter Four of the ŠGW, which contains the parable, is structured as a response to a theological question posed by an otherwise unknown Mihiraiiār i Mahmādą of Isfahan.64 Mihraiiār questions how, since both good and evil events on earth are dictated by the influ-ence of the stars and the heavenly sphere, the creation of these celestial bodies can be attrib-uted to either Ohrmazd or Ahriman. The radical opposition and incompatibility between goodand evil is one of the central tenets of the ŠGW's theology65 and Mihiriiār's question points to a belief that seemingly contradicts this radical opposition. If Ahriman created the celestial bodies, then he is, contrary to his nature, ultimately responsible for good events; if Ohrmazd did so, he is likewise responsible for evil. If they created the celestial bodies together, then Ohrmazd would be complicit in Ahriman's evildoing.66 Mihiiār's questions from the two preceding chapters display similar concerns. In Chapter Two, he asks how Ahriman was able to attack Ohrmazd's domain of light since the two are composed of opposed and incompatible essences.67 Similarly, in Chapter Three, he asks why Ohrmazd was not able to prevent Ahriman from doing evil; this inability would seem to violate his perfection.68 Motivating all of these questions is a single underlying prob-lem: the lack of sufficient distinction between Ohrmazd and Ahriman in the traditional Zoroastrian account of creation.In addition to his astrological arguments regarding the origins and functions of the planets and the stars, Mardānfarrox employs a parable of a gardener's defense of his garden against a destructive vermin to answer the challenge raised by Mihiriiār i Mahmādą. Like some rabbinic parables, a rhetorical device frequently employed in the Midrash,69 the ŠGW's 64.Mihiraiiār is introduced in ŠGW 2:2: aβar pursašni ǝ̄ucaṇd hamǝ̄ pǝ̄rōžgar mihir aiiār i mahmādą ǝž spāhānī vahǝ manišnihā nǝ̄ halaa x́āhišnihā pursīṯ. Regarding several questions which the ever-glorious Mihraiiār son of Mahmād from Isfahan asked out of proper consideration not foolish curiosity.As Menasce notes, Mihraiiār—or, to be more precise, his father—was apparently Muslim. The argument regarding Ahriman's attack in Chapter Two is repeated in an Islamic polemic against Zoroastrianism mentioned in al-Ashʿarī's Maqālāt al-Islāmiyyīn. (de Menasce, Apologétique, 36). On Mihaiiār's identification as Muslim see further Cereti, La letteratura pahlavi, 80.65.For the exposition of this opposition see ŠGW 8:1-38.66.ŠGW 4:2-6.67.ŠGW 2:3.68.ŠGW 3:1-3.69.On rabbinic parables see Daniel Boyarin, Intertextuality and the Reading of Midrash (Bloomington: Indian University Press, 1990), 80-92; Fraenkel, Darkei ha-Aggadah, 1:323-94; David Stern, Parables in Midrash: Narrative and Exegesis in Rabbinic Literature (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991); and Galit Hasan-Rokem, Tales of the Neighborhood: Jewish Narrative Dialogues in Late Antiquity (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003), 21-25.

This reading is problematic in that the event of capture only comes at the end of the sentence.

The Sanskrit śastra- seems to be related to the word for sword. As for the second element in the compound,Pahlavi petyārag means \"evil adversary\" (MacKenzie, CPD, 68); Timuş follows this reading in translating \"qui oppresse les créatures et produit l'advérsité\" (Timuș, Fonder, bâtir, rénover, 108). However, taking the Sanskrit into account, the first element of which is related to length and duration (Monier-Williams, Dictionary, 481), the Pazand could also be read as reflecting an underlying Pahlavi pādīrānīdan, pādīrān- \"to restrain\" or \"to impede\" (MacKenzie, CPD, 63). 94.Pahlavi mēhmān, Sanskrit abhyāgatāh.

Zoroastrian cosmogony receives its fullest treatment in Pahlavi literature, in particular in the Bundahišn.102 Enrico Raffaeli has demon-strated the ŠGW's particular affinity to this text,103 and it is for this reason that I will refer pri-marily to the Bundahišn in the synopsis of Zoroastrian cosmogony below. However, it is important to bear in mind that as much as Mardānfarrox declares himself an avid reader of Zoroastrian literature,104 it is unlikely—though not impossible—that he had access to the same version of the story the Bundahišn tells.105 More plausible is that the close affinity between the two texts is due to a common, now lost, source.106 Given its length, I will recount the story of creation in brief rather than cite the text in full. In the beginning, Ohrmazd was on high, in omniscience, goodness and light for an unlimited time. Ahriman, on the other hand, was in the deep and in darkness. Both spiri-tual107 entities were unlimited in every direction but that facing the boundary between them; 102.A post-Sasanian work which makes uses of earlier materials, the Bundahišn describes the creation of the world and its diversity; various chapters are devoted, for instance, to astronomy, geography, and animal andvegetable life. The text also includes a final apocalyptical section. For a general discussion of the contents of the work and the manuscript tradition see David N. MacKenzie, \"Bundahišn,\" in Encyclopaedia Iranica (Costa Mesa, CA: Mazda, 1990), 4:547-51; Cereti, La letteratura pahlavi, 87-91 and Macuch, \"Pahlavi Literature\", 137-39. The other main Pahlavi witness for the creation story is the Wizīdagīhā ī Zādspram, a late-ninth century compilation which likewise draws from earlier sources. See the edition by Phillipe Gignoux and Ahmad Tafazzoli, eds. Anthologie de Zādspram (Paris: Association pour l'avancement des études iraniennes, 1993).103.This affinity is especially clear on points of astronomy and astrology: the fifth chapter of the Bundahišn contains an extended astronomical discussion very similar to ŠGW Chapter Four. On this section of the Bundahishn see David Neil MacKenzie, \"Zoroastrian Astrology in the Bundahišn,\" Bulletin of the School ofOriental and African Studies 27 (1964): 511-29 and, on the comparison, Enrico Raffaelli,\"The Astrological Chapter of the Škand Gumanīg Wizār,\" in Kayd: Studies in History of Mathematics, Astronomy and Astrology in Memory of David Pingree, ed.

Ohrmazd, on account of his omniscience, was aware of Ahriman, their conflict, and evil's ultimate defeat. Ahriman, however, was unaware of Ohrmazd. This situation lasted for three thousand years until Ahriman approached the boundary, saw the lights of goodness, and attacked (BD 1:15-16). Though Ohrmazd proposed peace to Ahriman and offered him the opportunity to aid goodness for his own benefit, Ahriman refused and pledged eternal enmity against Ohrmazd and his creation (BD 1:20-23). In his omniscience, Ohrmazd knew that if he did not set a limited time in which the battle between good and evil would take place, like two men who agree to fight from morning to night (BD 1:27), the strife would continue eter-nally. Therefore, Ohrmazd proposed to Ahriman that they fix a period of nine thousand yearsin which to do battle. Ahriman, unable to foresee that this time limit would lead inevitably to his own destruction, agreed to the terms (BD 1:26-28). Their deal set, Ohrmazd recited the Ahunawar mantra,108 which set forth the future of the conflict between good and evil.109 The Ahunawar revealed Ahriman's defeat and Ohrmazd's triumph (BD 1:29): during the period of their battle, for three thousand years Ohrmazd's will would prevail; for three thousand years, during the period of the mixture (gumezišn), their wills would strive together; and during the final period, Ahriman would be incapacitated. Stunned by this knowledge, Ahriman fell back into the darkness for three thousand years (BD 1:30-32). Then Ohrmazd formed his creatures from his own essence; Ahriman, in response, counter-created (kirrēnīd) the demons (BD 1:44-50). I will discuss the exegetical relationship between the garden parable and Zoroastrian cosmogony as told in the Bundahišn further below. There is, however, an additional text from BD 4:10-12 that also relates to the parable's description of Ohrmazd trapping Ahriman and the demons inside the sky (ŠGW 4:75-76):Orientalia 33 (1971): 59-71.108.Ahunawar is the Pahlavi rendition of Avestan yaθa ahū vairyō, the opening words of one of the most sacredverses in the Zoroastrian tradition (Yasna 27:13). Part of the Zoroastrian liturgy, the Ahunawar mantra is the opening verse of the Old Avesta. This part of the Avestan corpus, written in a slightly more archaic form of the Avestan dialect, also includes two additional mantras, Aṣ̌ǝm Vohū (Yasna 27:14) and Yeŋ́hē Hāṯąm (Yasna 27:15); the five Gathas, the sacred poems authored by the prophet Zaraθuštra himself (Yasna 28-34, 43-46, 47-50, 51, and 53); the Yasna Hapaŋhāiti (Yasna 35-41) and a final mantra, the A Airiiǝ̄ma Isiio or Airiiaman at the end of Yasna 54. Martin Schwartz has demonstrated that the Ahunawar is the original last stanza of Yasna 29. See his \"Gathic Compositional History, Yasna 29, and Bovine Symbolism,\" in Paitimana, ed. S. Adhami (Costa Mesa, CA: Mazda, 2003), 214-17. For a description of the Avestan corpus see Jean Kellens, \"Avesta,\" in Encyclopaedia Iranica (Costa Mesa, CA: Mazda, 1988), 3:35-54 and, most recently, Hintze, \"Avestan Literarture.\" For a discussion of the intertextual relationship between the various parts of the Old Avestan corpus, notably the concatenations in the Gathas, see Martin Schwartz, \"The Gathas and Other Old Avestan Poetry,\" in La langue poétique indo-européenne, eds. Georges-Jean Pinault and Daniel Petit (Leuven: Peeters, 2006), 459-98 and the references to earlier studies quoted there.109.Ohrmazd's revelatory recitation of the Ahunawar prayer is significant on a number of levels. In particular, as Yuhan Vevaina has shown, the twenty-one words of the prayer are understood, within the Pahlavi commentary tradition, to encapsulate the entire content of the dēn. See the further discussion in Yuhan Sohrab-Dinshaw Vevaina, \"'Enumerating the Dēn': Textual Taxonomies, Cosmological Deixis, and Numerological Speculations in Zoroastrianism,\" History of Religions 50 (2010): 125-27.- 96 -"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"pas āxist gannāg-mēnōg abāg hamist dēwān abzārān ō padīrag ī rōšnān, u-š ān ās-mān dīd, ī-šān mēnōgīhā nimūd ka ne astōmand dād estēd. arešk-kāmagīhā tag abar kard . . . māh ī frawardīn rōz ī ohrmazd andar dwārist nēm-rōz. u-š asmān ēdōn aziš be tarsīd ceōn gōspand az gurg . . . u-š guft mēnōg asmān ō gannāg-mēnōg ku \"bēdom-zamānā-m pānagīh abāyēd kardan ku-t bērōn be nē hilēm.\"Then the Evil Spirit rose with all the powerful demons against the lights, and he saw the sky, which appeared spiritually for it had not been created materially. Fullof jealous desire he attacked . . . in the month of Frawardīn on the day of Ohrmazdat noon he penetrated. And the sky was afraid of him like a speech from a wolf . . . And the spiritual sky said to the Evil Spirit: \"I must protect the furthermost time, meaning that I will not let you out.\"110Though the sky flees from Ahriman \"like a sheep from a wolf\" during the attack, afterward it forms a barrier between the Evil Spirit and the untainted spiritual realm. Here wesee why the parable identifies the trap with the sky: while Ahriman is able to enter, once inside he cannot to get out.111 Overall, the relationship between the garden parable and the creation story is quite clear; with the details filled in, the parable's correspondence between the gardener and Ohrmazd, the vermin and Ahriman and the trap and the sky seem perfectly fitting. Distinguishing Ohrmazd and AhrimanThe lack of distinction between Ohrmazd and Ahriman that the parable sets out to interpret can be seen in the depiction of creation in the first chapter of the Bundahišn. First ofall, the characterization of the two entities deserves note. The Bundahišn portrays both spiri-tual entities as fully developed characters. Diametrically opposed though they might be in their natures, the fact that they are shown to both desire, think, converse, and create seems to undermine the radical distinction between them. The text reveals the internal thoughts of both, equally. Ahriman is shown to be a character with whom we as readers can identity: Ahriman is a tragic hero, bamboozled into destruction by Ohrmazd's clever wiles. Though other Pahlavi texts insist on Ahriman's material non-existence, a point also alluded to in the Bundahišn,112 his existence and presence as a character in the text is exactly equivalent to Ohrmazd's. 110.For an edition of the text see Fazolah Pakzad Soraki, \"Bundahišn: Zoroastrische Kosmologie und Kosmogonie, Kapital I-VI\" (PhD diss., University of Tubingen, 2003), 61-62.111.The same episode is retold in ŠGW 4:12-16, though, significantly, the sky's initial retreat is not mentioned.112.DD 18:2-3 (Mahmoud Jaafari-Dehaghi, ed. and trans., Dādestān ī Dēnīg: Part 1 (Paris: Association pour l'avancement des études iraniennes, 1998), 72-73); DK 3:105 (Jean de Menasce, ed. and trans., Le troisièmelivre du Dēnkart (Paris: Libraire C. Klincksiek, 1973), 107) and BD 1:25 (Cereti and MacKenzie, \"Battle,\" 35).

Eliezer Ephraim Urbach, et al. (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1967), 337-52 .- 97 -"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"In addition to their equal characterization, the text also depicts the possibility of their agreement. In the Bundahišn, Ohrmazd and Ahriman are capable of rapprochement. BD 1:20-21 describe Ohrmazd's peace proposal to Ahriman before their battle:(20) ēg ohrmazd abāg-iz ce-ēwēnag dānistan ī frazām ī kār ō padīrag ī gannāg mēnōg sūd. u-š āštīh abar dāst ud guft kū \"gannāg mēnōg, abar ō dām ī man ayārīhbar ud stāyišn dah tā pad ān pādāšn amarg ud azarmān ud asōhišn ud apōhišn bawē. (21) u-š cim ēn kū agar ardīg nē sarēnē xwad nē agarīhē ud ō-mān har dōnān sūd abgārē.\"(20) Then Ohrmazd, with his knowledge of the end of the affair, went to meet the Evil Spirit. And he proposed peace and said, \"Evil Spirit, befriend my creation and offer praise so that as a reward you become immortal and ageless and without feeling and undecaying. (21) And the reason is that if you do not provoke battle, you will not incapacitate yourself and you will promote benefit for both of us.\"113This conciliatory gesture certainly highlights Ohrmazd's goodness. Despite his fore-knowledge of the inevitability of conflict, he is depicted as a seeker after peace. Ahriman's answer is, predictably, a pledge of enmity. However, the dialogue between them not only demonstrates their equal status as characters within the work but also raises the possibility that Ahriman could have accepted the proposal. That would imply the mutability of Ahriman's nature and the lack of absolute opposition between good and evil which reason, as Mihiiār's question underlines, would dictate.A similar problem is raised by the two entities' agreement to battle for a specific period of time. On the one hand, as above, the necessity of Ahriman's agreement to Ohrmazd's proposal implies an equality between them as characters. As much as Ahriman lacks foresight in falling for Ohrmazd's trick, he is nonetheless capable of rational choice. Moreover time is a double-edged instrument. The finiteness of time guarantees Ahriman's ultimate defeat. However, time aids both good and evil. As BD 1:36 states, the Evil Spirit's attack could not be incapacitated but through creation, and the time which is necessary for Ohrmazd's creation animates or makes current (rawāgīh) Ahriman's evil counter-creation as well.114 It is clear from the Bundahišn's account that time is, to a certain extent, outside of Ohrmazd's control.115 Despite the fact that the text describes Ohrmazd fashioning finite time 113.§21 is missing entirely from the shorter recension of the text, known as the Indian Bundahišn. It is possiblethat this paragraph was added in the longer Iranian recension as an explanation of why Ohrmazd would make his surprising offer of peace. Cereti and MacKenzie, \"Battle,\" 55. 114.See Cereti and MacKenzie, \"Battle,\" 37:u-š dīd pad rōšn-wēnāgīh Ohrmazd ku Gannāg Mēnōg hargiz az petyāragīh ne wardēd, ān petyāragīh jud pad dām-dahišnīh ne agārīhēd ud dām jud pad zamān rawāgīh ne bawēd, ka zamānbrēhēnīd dām-ez ī Ahreman rawāg be bawēd.And with his clear-sightedness Ohrmazd saw that the Evil Spirit would never turn from his ons-laught, that that onslaught could not be made powerless except by the creation, and that for the creatures there would be no currency without time, [and] that when time had been created the crea-tures of Ahriman would also become current.115.This might reflect an alternative account of creation which states that both Ohrmazd and Ahriman were born from time (zurwān). This alternative version, identified as the \"Zurvanite heresy\" (see Robert C. - 98 -"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"(BD 1:39), it also states that time is more powerful than both good and evil creation. Why should good enter battle with such an aimless weapon?The parable resolves this gap by providing in the fictional story a deep structure116 for the creation narrative. The apparent equality between Ohrmazd and Ahriman is an illusion. Their natures are as diverse and incompatible as that of a human and a lizard or crow; no pos-sibility of communication can exist between them. Moreover, in the parable no agreement is necessary between the gardener and the vermin. It is simply the vermin's nature to attack,117 and no peace offerings or gentlemen's agreements can offset or limit that attack. In essence, the parable sifts out of the creation narrative all hints of Ahriman's character. Without even a specific name or identity—daṯ means vermin in general, not any particular species of animal—the attacker is portrayed here without any internal life or reflection, without emo-tions or reactions, but simply as a relentless force, a hunger. The garden parable deanimates the Evil Spirit and strips him of his character.Similarly, the time which restricts the period of battle and animates creation is no longer the object of an agreement between the two entities. Rather, the time of the battle is determined solely by the strength of the vermin. While the gardener, in his wisdom, gauges the animal's strength and builds his trap accordingly, the struggle ends only when the vermin is exhausted, not according to some external timer or schedule. Indeed, one can even go so far as to say that the structuring fiction of the parable presents the story as if there were no real battle at all. Time, battle, will, and struggle—all are internalized in the evil vermin and have no effect on the garden of Ohrmazd. Whatever the surface contradictions, the deep story of cosmogony is one of radical opposition and inequality. This revelation of this deep story by means of the structuring garden fiction can be said to entail, above all, a shift of narratological perspective. While creation in the Bundahišnis told, as it were, through human eyes, which see the battle between good and evil personi-fied on this material plane, in the world and within ourselves, the parable is told from the point of view of Ohrmazd himself. From that perspective, evil's attack is, at best, a minor inconvenience and disturbs not at all his transcendent gardening.118Zaehner, Zurvan: A Zoroastrian Dilemma [New York: Biblio and Tannen, 1972]), can be found in Pahlavi works (including the Bundahišn), later Zoroastrian religious texts in New Persian, as well as Armenian and Greek sources. On the misapplication of the concepts of \"orthodoxy\" and \"heresy\" to the different creation accounts in the Sasanian period see Shaked, Dualism, 14-15. 116.On this as a function of the rabbinic parable see Boyarin, \"Parables\", 130: \"It follows, then, that the so-called nimshal [Hebrew: solution to the parable], which is the actual filled-out biblical story, is ontologically prior and axiologically primary in the mashal [Hebrew: parable] text, and that the function of the mashal in such contexts is, indeed, to provide a rationale for precisely this way of filling the gap, as at least a possible and plausible one, and thus a rationale for exegesis. . . . the mashal, on my view, is an interpretation of the nimshal.\" See further Boyarin, Intertextuality, 90.117.This is essentially the answer Mardānfarrox gives as to Mihiiār's question why Ahriman could attack Ohrmazd's creation: it is precisely because they are of irreconcilable natures that evil attacked good (ŠGW 2:5).118.As Stein, Maxims, Magic, Myth, 104 has noted, there are also gaps between the fictional narrative of the parable and its scriptural solution. To read a rabbinic parable is to engage in a double reading, first reading the two parts of the parable together, discerning the correspondences between them and how the fictional narrative structures the gapped scriptural text, and then returning to read the two halves separately in light of the gaps they contain. The same can be said of the ŠGW's garden parable. The most significant gap between the two halves of the parable is the problem of the trap. As BD 1:29 (Cereti and MacKenzie, - 99 -"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Between Parable and PolemicHaving established the garden parable's exegetical relationship with the Zoroastrian account of creation, I will now turn to the connection between the parable and the other pas-sages that make up the motif of gardens in the ŠGW. First of all, there are linguistic connec-tions between the various passages. For example, knowledge, a major theme in Mardānfar-rox's critique of the garden passages and one of the most important attributes of Ohrmazd, is a recurring theme in these garden citations. Forms of the word for knowledge, dānāī, are repeated throughout the passages. In ŠGW 4:69 the gardener prepares the trap with knowl-edge (pa dānāī) and his knowledge is emphasized again in 4:71: he is referred to as the wise gardener (bāγaβąn i dānā) and his capture of the vermin is the fruit of his knowledge (x́ǝ̄š dānāīhā). In ŠGW 13:25-26, after eating the fruit Ādām and Hauuāe become knowledgeable concerning good and evil (u dānašni aβą būṯ) and that they are naked (u dānast ku brahanaa hast). The tree itself is also referred to as the tree of knowledge (draxt i dānašni) in 13:33. The same is true of the citation in Chapter Eleven. ŠGW 11:72 refers to Ādam's becoming knowledgeable (dānašnimaṇd). More important than the linguistic resonances, though, are the similarities in the nar-ratives themselves. Like Chapter Four's parable, the passages from the critiques of Judaism and Islam are also set in gardens. As in classical Iranian gardens,119 the most important fea-tures in both gardens are the fruit trees. The importance of these trees is indicated by the lengths the gardeners go to to protect them. The vermin desire the fruit of the trees in ŠGW 4:63 and it is because of this desire that the gardener prepares his trap. Ādīnō forbids Ādam and Hauuāe to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge in 13:19 and punishes them severely when they do. The same prohibition is repeated in 11:64 and 11:354. The good and evil fruitis also the focus of the passage in the critique of Christianity at 15:132-134.The gardens are also depicted as separated or distinguished from the surrounding space; in both cases there is a demarcated inside and outside. In the garden citations in Chap-ter Thirteen and Chapter Eleven the boundary is evident in God's act expelling the first couple from the garden to the land outside. In the parable in Chapter Four, the borders are less prominent. However, the vermin come from outside the garden to attack and, once the animal is incapacitated, the gardener removes it from the trap and, presumably, the garden as well. \"Battle,\" 36) makes clear, Ohrmazd revealed to Ahriman through the Ahunawar prayer his own ultimate defeat. While it is not clear whether Ahriman is destroyed or merely rendered inactive, the end of the world, the resurrection, and the destruction of the demons does seem to be the end of evil and its influence. However, in the ŠGW's garden parable, the finality of the ending is more ambiguous. Having been incapacitated the vermin, the gardener removes it from the trap—one presumes this implies removing it from the garden as well—and returns the trap to his storehouse. Having gone to all the trouble to construct the trap and catch the vermin, why doesn't the gardener kill the animal or why does the story not state explicitly that the vermin never troubled the garden again? The gesture of replacing the trap to the storehouse in particular raises the possibility of its being taken out a second time. It raises the possibility of repetition, of a cyclical struggle of good against evil which undermines the linear chronology of Zoroastriancosmogony in the Bundahišn. 119.Maria E.

See further on Iranian gardens below.- 100 -"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The characters and plots of the narratives are also similar. The passages in Chapters Eleven and Thirteen both cast God in a role similar to that of the gardener in Chapter Four's parable. God and the gardner both attempt to protect the trees in the garden, though only the parable's gardener is actually successful in his attempt. Both have unquestioned authority within the gardens and power over the creatures within it. Similarly, the gardens are infested by vermin: the serpent (or Ahriman) in Chapters Eleven and Thirteen and the unnamed wild animal in the parable. These creatures are absolutely evil and wish only to do harm. The gar-dens also contain a trap by means of which the vermin is neutralized and the fruit-trees pro-tected. In the parable in Chapter Four, this is the gardener's trap or snare while in Chapters Eleven and Thirteen the element parallel to the trap is the tree of knowledge itself. Likewise, the two passages construct similar narratives out of these common elements. In both the parable and the garden stories in the polemical chapters, a gardener, in order to protect the fruit trees of his garden, lays a trap for hungry vermin. The vermin are similarly caught, inca-pacitated, though not destroyed, and removed from the garden. However, while the garden parable is characterized by its coherence and its ordering of the Zoroastrian creation account, the garden citations from the critiques of Islam, Judaism, and Christianity are incoherent and disordered. First of all, the characters' motives and moralorientations are contradictory. Citing just a few of the contradictions in the story in Chapter Thirteen, Ādīnō, who creates Ādam and Hauuāe and puts them in the garden, also introduces the serpent who entices them to transgress that his prohibition to eat the forbidden fruit. Con-sidering that Ādīnō himself set up the conditions for this transgression, his anger and punish-ment are unjustified. The same incoherence can be seen in the character of the serpent. Inserted into the scene by Ādīnō, he nonetheless immediately seeks to undermine Ādīnō's commands. However, his \"crime\" leads directly to the human couple's enlightenment, a sur-prisingly positive result for a seemingly devious creature.120 It is unclear if the serpent is good or evil. As for Ādam and Hauuāe, they follow the serpent's suggestion to eat the fruit without a second thought, a surprising development considering the severity of Ādīnō's pro-hibition. The nature of the tree is also difficult to define. In terms of its function in the narra-tive, it resembles the trap in the garden parable but, instead of catching the vermin—here the serpent—it catches precisely the human creatures whom were installed in the garden to culti-vate and protect it. The Garden PalaceIn the preceding sections of this chapter I have argued for the existence of a motif of gardens in the ŠGW. I have attempted to show that the garden citation in Chapter Thirteen is an integral part of this motif. My goal in arguing for the literary connection between the pas-sages discussed above has been to provide an alternative explanation for the prominent place of the garden citation within the critique of Judaism. As part of a larger motif of gardens that runs through the ŠGW as a whole, connecting the works apologetics and polemics, the cen-120.Mardānfarrox mentions this contradiction in his critique at ŠGW 13:121-131. This same problem inspired the Manichaean critique, cited by Augustine, that the serpent was Christ and a \"god of the nation of darkness\" (deum nescio quem gentis tenebrarum) gave the command for Adam and Eve not to eat from the tree because \"he begrudged men the knowledge of good and evil\" (Augustine, On Genesis, 135-36). - 101 -"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"trality of the garden citation in the critique of Judaism should not only be traced back to the importance of this story in Jewish literature or in polemics against the Jewish scriptures.The question remains, however, and with this question I will close this chapter, why the garden was chosen as the space in which to represent the coherence of Zoroastrianism andthe incoherence of its opponents. I propose that Mardānfarrox chose to encapsulate the conundrum of monotheism as well as the triumph of Zoroastrianism in a garden because of the particular place of gardens in Iranian culture. In Iranian culture, as in the ancient Near East in general, the association between gardening and politics has been deeper than that of a resemblance between cognate arts.121 Beginning with the Achaemenid Persian empire (c. 550-330 BCE), royal gardens were the residences of kings and the seats of royal power; as Maria Subtelny succinctly notes, \"it is the architecture of the garden which incorporates the palace and not the contrary.\"122 Gardens were linked with palaces both architecturally, as partof a single complex surrounded by a walled enclosure123 and conceptually. The idea of the king as royal gardener was intrinsic to the conception of kingship; the king as gardener ren-dered the earth fertile, a not insignificant attribute in the arid Iranian plateau.124 David Stro-nach has raised the possibility that the four-fold royal garden at Pasargadae, the Achamenid capital, represented in microcosm the empire's extensive dominion.125 It is on account of this linkage that Achamenid kings held court and executed justice in gardens. One of the more prominent examples of this policy can be found in the Book of Esther's depiction of the king'sthrone room, where justice is executed and the most important events of the story take place, 121.On the Mesopotamian background of associations between kingship and gardens, see David Stronach, \"TheGarden as a Political Statement: Some Case Studies from the Near East in the First Millenium B.

While the evidence for Sasanian gardensis sparse, with especially little information to be gleaned from Pahlavi literature, scholars have argued that the quadripartite garden design familiar from Achamenid and later Islamic gardens was also known to the Sasanians.128 Evidence of the link between the palace and the garden includes a silver bowl engraved with the image of a garden palace; the bowl has been dated to the reign of Khosrow II (590-628).129 Archeological remains have been found of Sasanian gardens at Qasr-e Shirin and Hawsh Kuri dated, again, to Khosrow II. Both these gardens, complete with pools, shaded passageways and wide avenues, are designed to sur-round the palace complex.130 This same close connection between political power and the garden continued under Islam.131 An example more or less contemporary with the ŠGW is the complex of gardens built by the ʿAbbasid Caliph al-Muʿtasim (r. 833-842) at the Jawsāq al-Khāqānī palace at Samarra, the capital city he founded. Similar in design to the Sasanian gardens just dis-cussed,132 these palace gardens are mentioned as the location of the execution of a traitor to the crown and, presumably in another part of the property, where Caliph al-Muʿtaz received the news of the sentence being carried out \"sitting in a garden (būstān) of the Jawsaq filled with thyme mingled with Adonic anemones.\"133 Less than a century later, in 917, two ambas-sadors sent by the Byzantine emperor Constantine visited Caliph al-Muqtadir at Baghdad. An account of their visit, recorded in al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī's eleventh century History of Baghdād,134 describes a number of the ruler's garden palaces, full of date palms, melon beds, water tanks, artificial golden trees with mechanical birds, and, inside the palaces, sumptuous carpets and furniture.135 126.Esther 1:5 and 7:7-8.

Poets often liken the king-dom to a garden and the king to a gardener; these panegyrics also invoke the Islamic associa-tion between gardens and paradise.136 For example, in the dedication to his epic Shāhnāme, Ferdowsi praises his patron Maḥmūd of Ghazna in the following terms:نگار پر زمين و ابر ز پر هوا بهار باغ چو شد جهان شٌفر زارم باغ کردار به شد جهان نم بهنگام آمد اندر ابر ازBecause of his glory,137 the world became like a garden in spring, the sky full of clouds and the earth full of beauties; from time to time rain falls and makes the world like the garden of Iram.138Likewise, the eleventh century poet Muʿizzī's pangyric in praise of the Seljuk ruler Malik Shāh compares the kingdom to a garden. \"The shāh,\" Muʿizzī writes, \"is Riḍwān139 and his garden the divine Paradise. . . . Happy is the garden and happy the king within it.\"140 A different, though complementary, association of kings and gardens is made in the literature of political council and mirrors for princes. In the twelfth century Jāmiʿ al-ʿulūm by Fakhr al-Dīn Rāzī, Maria Subtelny has identified a version of the famous maxim of the \"circle of justice.\" The maxim instructs that the sovereign's power both provides for and depends on a flourishing agriculture, which makes use of the image of the garden. In Sub-telny's translation, the text states: \"the world is a garden irrigated by the state.\" An anony-mous fifteenth century Arabic manuscript of the Councils of Alexander (Naṣāʾih-i Iskandar) makes even more explicit the connection between the garden and sovereignty: \"the world is agarden which the state must master.\"141 A signal example of the symbolism of the garden palace can be found in a panegyric by the eleventh century poet Farrukhī, dedicated to Maḥmūd of Ghazna on the occasion of his construction of a new garden in the city of Balkh:136.For more on this association see the references in the following chapter.137.Persian farr, Pahlavi xwarrah, Avestan xvarǝnah.

Parts of it are praised as hunting grounds and other parts are proper for feasting. . . . In its midst is a kingly palace with two figures on its walls painted in decorated niches, facing the view. . . The painter has shown the king twice there, once in battle holding a lance, again at a feast with cup in hand.142This poem weaves together many of the elements and design features discussed above. The space of the garden is described as filled with trees and fragrant herbs, areas for hunting and feasting, a decorated palace, and, in a further section not quoted, a deep pool and relaxing pavilion for drinking wine. The garden is the image of paradise and, at the same time, the reflection, or perhaps reserve, of the king's power. This dual power is reflected in the pair of images depicted on the garden palace itself. The king holding the lance signifies military might and the power of justified violence, also present in the form of the warriors and the hunting ground. The image of the king at feast, as well as the guests and the wine pavilion, signify the sovereign's wealth, his economic power. These two facets, of course, are interre-lated, mutually reinforcing and transferable; returning to the Achaemenid context, we can think of the move between wealth and violence in Ahasuerus' order to execute Queen Vashti after she refuses to entertain at his drinking-feast.143 The presentation, in Farrūkhī's poem andthe other sources cited above, of the king's power in the garden is fitting precisely because the garden is a site of mastery over the natural world.With these associations in mind, we can turn back to the question of why Mardānfar-rox settled on the motif of the garden in order to stage the error of monotheism. To my mind,the association between gardens and governance is crucial. Gardens are sites of justice. 142.Abū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn Jūlūgh Sīstānī Farrūkhī, Dīvān, ed. M.

In the one instance this is the aes-thetic justness of beauty and in the other justice in the state and the city. In both cases, the ruler's power is absolute and inviolate; no one, and certainly not the individuals he rules, can question his decisions and authority. The garden is the perfect polity, the utopia. In the ŠGW's garden parable, the utopian space of perfect justice has been trans-formed into its opposite. In turning the potent symbolism of the garden on its head, trans-forming it from the quintessential image of justice and right rule, Mardānfarrox's polemic is sharpened. Set in the very space characterized by order, the disorder of the monotheistic garden is all the more jarring and unconscionable. ConclusionI have attempted to demonstrate two points in this chapter. First of all, I have tried to prove the existence of a recurring motif of gardens in the three critiques of monotheism in theŠGW. Moreover, I have argued that these three horticultural passages are related, serving to link the critiques of the individual monotheistic doctrines and showing them to be permuta-tions of the same basic error. Secondly, as discussed immediately above, I have offered an explanation of why the story of the garden, in its various forms, was chosen as this motif. In focusing on a recurring motif, this chapter continues on a larger scale the argument of the previous chapter. Whereas that chapter concerned the motif of angels among the cita-tions in the critique of Judaism, this chapter expands the scope of analysis to include the threechapters on Judaism, Islam and Christianity. In both chapters I argue that reading the cita-tions contextually, which is to say as part of a larger, recurring pattern, reveals levels of meaning and polemical import that are lost when the primary point of reference is the cita-tions' parallels in the Bible and Jewish literature. - 106 -"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Chapter Five:Creating Judaism:Between the ŠGW and the DēnkardThe ŠGW is not Zoroastrian literature's only polemic against Judaism.

Notsurprisingly, both because of the central role that polemics—of Jews and others—plays in both the ŠGW and the Dēnkard, and because of more intimate connections between the two works which will be adduced below, the ŠGW's critique of Judaism and the Dēnkard's polem-ical chapters share a number of common features. However, despite this closeness, the ŠGW and the Dēnkard disagree on at least one crucial point. Whereas the Dēnkard, in various ways, attacks Judaism itself, the ŠGW directs its sights on a different object. The object of the ŠGW's critique is not Judaism as such, but a Jewish book; as has been mentioned before in this dissertation, Mardānfarrox declares at the outset of ŠGW Chapter Thirteen that he will cite and critique from a text he refers to as the naxustīn niβǝ̄, meaning the First Scripture. Though this seems like a small distinction, it is a significant difference. Accepting theŠGW's chronological claim that it post-dates the Dēnkard, I will argue in more detail in what follows that the appearance of the Jewish text in the ŠGW signifies a break with Zoroastrian tradition. In the Dēnkard explicitly and in the ŠGW implicitly, Judaism is cast in the role of Zoroastrianism's primordial Other; Zoroastrianism's relationship with and superiority over Judaism is a sign of its primacy in the world.In order to expand on these points and to better frame the central question of the dif-ference between the ŠGW and the Dēnkard, I will first describe in some detail the two texts' affinities. I will then turn to the Dēnkard's polemical chapters and describe the depiction of Judaism to be found there.3 Finally, I will set the Dēnkard's Judaism against the ŠGW's First Scripture and attempt an interpretation of the significance of textuality in the ŠGW. A Bibliophile's ConfessionWe can begin with the most explicit link between the two texts. This is contained in the autobiographical passage in Chapter Ten of the ŠGW. Since neither Mardānfarrox ī Ohrmazddādān's name nor any references to his book appear in Zoroastrian literature outside the ŠGW, this short text, what we can call Mardānfarrox's confession,4 remains scholars' only recourse for the life of the author, his motives and the sources of his work. ŠGW 10:43-58 reads as follows:(43) nuṇ mǝn har gāh pa yazaṯ šnāxtan cuṇ ažaβar naβašt taftī-manišni pa vazōstārī5 yaš dīn u kām pursīdār būṯ hom (44) ham-cuṇ vazōstārī rā ō bǝ̄ kešβar uhinduuą būm u vasą jaṯ-sardagą farnaft hom (45) ci6 mǝn dīn nǝ̄ ą i pa aβarmąd 3.The Dēnkard refers to Judaism as kēš jahūd or jahūd kēš both meaning the Jewish dogma, faith, or sect (Mackenzie, CPD, 51). The generally pejorative concept kēš is opposed in Zoroastrian Pahlavi literature to dēn, a multivalent theological and metaphysical term meaning vision, inner self, conscience as well as faith,belief or religion. For a discussion of dēn in Zoroastrian literature see Marijan Molé, Culte, Mythe et cosmologie dans l'Iran ancien: Le problème zoroastrien et la tradition mazdéenne (Paris: Presses universitaires de France, 1963); Mansour Shaki, \"Dēn,\" in Encyclopaedia Iranica 3:279-81 (Costa Mesa, CA: Mazda, 1994); and Vevaina, \"Enumerating the Dēn,\" 114. Since dēn is difficult to render precisely in English, I will leave the word untranslated throughout.4.A parallel source appears at ŠGW 1:35-38; for the most recent translation and discussion of these two passages see Cereti, \"Notes on the Škand Gumānīg Wizār.\"5.Sanskrit saṃśōdhanatathā, completely purifying, destroying impurity (Monier-Williams, Dictionary, 1118).6.MSS.

Mardānfarrox's is a bibliophile's confession. What saves him from the depths of doubt is not—or, at least, not only— a stroke from heaven but the reading of books. While we know little or nothing about Ādar-Pādiiāβaṇdą17 or Rōšan Ādar-Farōbagą,18 Ādar-FarōbagFarōxzādą is, as Mardānfarrox indicates, identified in the tradition as the first editor and com-piler of the Dēnkard. While the precise relationship between Ādurfarnbāg's Dēnkard and the recension used by Mardānfarrox is not certain,19 the ŠGW shows particular affinity with the Third Book of the Dēnkard as it has come down to us. In addition to Mardānfarrox's explicit references to his dependence on the Dēnkard such as those found in the confession above,20 de Menasce has pointed out numerous instances where Mardānfarrox's apologetics and polemics match the Dēnkard's.Among other examples of the two texts' affinity is the parallel between the extended comparison of the dēn to a tree in ŠGW Chapter One21 and a similar analogy found in DK 3:333. There, this image of the dēn is contrasted with the image of the evil religion as venomin a serpent.22 Another parallel is found in Chapter Three of the ŠGW. The chapter as a whole is concerned with answering the question of why Ohrmazd did not stop Ahriman from doing evil and attacking creation. Mardānfarrox answers that Ohrmazd's power is limited to that which is possible. Since good and evil are two entirely opposed and intransmutable enti-ties, it would be impossible for Ohrmazd to alter or block Ahriman from doing evil. \"If I saidthat Ohrmazd the creator was able to restrain Ahriman from the evil which is his constant nature,\" Mardānfarrox writes, \"that demonic nature would be close to the divine and the divine could become demonic, and dark could be made light and light, dark.\"23 This same idea that divine power is limited to what is possible is found also in DK 3:185.24 The Dēnkard states that Ohrmazd's power is entirely contained (parwand) within the possible 17.He is also mentioned in ŠGW 1:38, 4:106 and 9:2, but unknown outside the ŠGW. See de Menasce, Apologétique, 11; de Menasce, \"Literature after the Conquest,\" 560-61; Cereti, La letteratura pahlavi, 80; Timuș, Fonder, bâtir, rénover, 16.18.Rōšan is mentioned also at ŠGW 11:213. On this sage see Gignoux, \"Controverse,\" esp. 144 and the tables on 147-49.19.Based on the fact that the ŠGW does not mention Ādurbād ī Ēmēdān, West, Pahlavi Texts Part Three, xxviiiconcluded that Mardānfarrox must have had access only to Ādurfarnbag's earlier recension. However, as de Menasce has argued, there is evidence of a third editor of the Dēnkard, named Ādurbād ī Mahraspandān ī Ašawahištān, a tenth century figure who is mentioned in a Persian Rivāyat preserved in the British Library(Mentioned in West, Pahlavi Texts Part One, 147-48 n. 4). Given the difficulty of determining the nature and extent of the redactional work by these two Ādurbāds, it is impossible to know what in the extant version of Dēnkard was anterior to the ŠGW and what is dependent on it; Mihaela Timuș, \"Humour\" goes so far as to argue that, in fact, the ŠGW must be later than Ādurbād ī Ēmēdān's redaction of the Dēnkard. 20.See also ŠGW 4:107, 5:92 and 12:1.

The text goes on to specify that his power is only limited with respect to those things, such as created existence (stī) the nature ofwhich are determined. As in the ŠGW, this would seem to refer to the basic laws and struc-ture of the physical universe, which cannot be violated. However, regarding those things which are undetermined (a-brīn), such as time, his power is unlimited. The limitlessness of divine power with respect to time could refer to Ohrmazd's ability to fashion finite time out of infinite time described in BD 1:39.25Parallels between the Third Book of the Dēnkard and the ŠGW can also be found in the polemical chapters. The account of the fall of the angels in Chapter Eleven26 appears as well in DK 3:241. There, in the context of a discussion of worship, the Dēnkard states that the sectarians (kēšdārān) contradict their belief that it is improper to worship creatures in saying that God commanded the angels to worship the first human. This divine command, the text goes on to state, resulted in the transformation of the angels to Ahriman and the demons.27 Similarly, the critique of the Christian doctrine of the Trinity in Chapter Fifteen28 is paralleled by a similar passage in DK 3:40.29 The Dēnkard attacks the Christians—called, as in the passage just discussed, kēšdārān—for claiming that the Father and Son are one entity with no hierarchy between them. If neither Person is prior to the other, the Dēnkard asks, how can they be referred to as Father and Son, a relationship which by its nature entails priority and generation?The Ancient Rivalry between Judaism and ZoroastrianismAs mentioned at the outset of this chapter, like the ŠGW, the Third Book of the Dēnkard also contains several passages polemicizing against Judaism.30 As discussed in a classic article by Shaul Shaked,31 these passages can be divided into two types. In the first, Judaism is criticized for its doctrines. For instance, the issue of next-of-kin marriages (xwēdōdah),32 a highly valued institution in Sasanian Zoroastrianism, is defended in DK 3:80,25.\"Then from infinite time he fashioned forth time of the long dominion.\" Cereti and MacKenzie, \"Battle,\" 37. 26.11:52-87.

Neither Christianity nor Islam are mentioned in this passage because Judaism already fills the monotheistic slot; there is no need for a fourth side to the triangle. While Shaked has adduced historical reasons for the fact that Islam does not represent monotheism in this and other similar passages, namely that the Dēnkard is recycling earlier Sasanian materials,42 it also seems likely, as I will argue in more detail in the context of another Dēnkard passage, that Judaism was perceived even in the post-Islamic period as the represen-tative of monotheism in its most extreme form.Similar sketches and refutations of Jewish doctrine can be found elsewhere in the Third Book of the Dēnkard.43 Of particular interest is a passage which relates closely to the critique of Judaism in the ŠGW. The passage, from chapter 291, is concerned with Ohrmazd's concern for his creation. The text compares Ohrmazd to a father who cares for hiscreation as for a son. All the evils in the world and the suffering of the creatures comes not from the beneficent creator but from the evil adversary, who is likened to an enemy of the father and son. DK 3:291:5 contrasts this position with Judaism:ud kēšdārān ke dōgānag44 anāgīh ī andar gētīg dahišnān az dādār ī dahišn jahūd kēš hambasān kēš hēnd,45 ō ān ī-šān abar abaxš-widārīh ī dādār āgāhēnīd ud abar anāg bazag-ez nē nēkīh ī46 kerbag-ez kardan handarzēnīd.47And the sectarians who [believe] the two-fold misery in the material creation is from the creator, are of the contradictory faith of the Jews, who have proclaimed regarding the creator's regret and have advised not to do evil and sin but the good of right action.48This short text is difficult to interpret fully. Believing that God regrets his creation surely entails a contradiction. Regret implies a change in will and knowledge which does not befit aperfect and omniscient God. The imperative to do good rather than evil, however, does not 42.Shaked, \"Zoroastrian Polemics,\" 91.43.DK 166:1-4 (Madan, Dinkard, 179; Dresden, Dēnkart, 138; de Menasce, Le troisième livre du Dēnkart, 176; Shaked, \"Zoroastrian Polemics,\" 95-96); 173:4 (Madan, Dinkard, 185; Dresden, Dēnkart, 143-44; de Menasce, Le troisième livre du Dēnkart, 182; Shaked, \"Zoroastrian Polemics,\" 96-97); and 197:7 (Madan, Dinkard, 213; Dresden, Dēnkart, 165-66; de Menasce, Le troisième livre du Dēnkart, 205-06; Shaked, \"Zoroastrian Polemics,\" 91-92)44.De Menasce, Le troisième livre du Dēnkart, 287 reads ahōg.

Perhaps, as in ŠGW 14:37,49 the implication is that ethical action would have no purpose in a world where God so easily changes his mind.The other kind of polemical passage in the Dēnkard couches the polemic in a descrip-tion of Judaism's mythic origins. In particular, DK 3:227, 3:229, and 3:288 credit Dahāg, thewell-known, serpent-headed demon who appears already in the Avesta,50 with the creation and propagation of Judaism. Dahāg's creation of Judaism is part of the demon's attempt to corrupt the good principles laid down by the primeval king Yima.51 Chapter 22752 first enu-merates the opposing principles or foundations (bun) of the good and evil religions. Then, the text turns to Yima's propagation of the law of the Right Measure (paymān),53 the demon's opposition to the good principle and its subsequent passage to the Prophet and the early believers. What follows is the history of the demonic counter-principle: (14) ud ān bun dēwān frēb wirāyišn ō tāz-tōhmag dahišn-kāhēnīdār dahāg wirēx-tan. ud dahāg xēm padeš winastan, ō kār kardan u-š freh-būdīg ud abē-būdīg54 sāstārīh ud ahlamōgīh wašnēnīd.55 ud padiš mardōm xēm wināstan gēhān mōyēnī-dan56 dām margēnīdan.

Dahāg is often identified with foreign regions and cults. Yasht 5:29-35 and 15:19-21 associate Aži Dahāka with Baβri, which later tradition interprets as the land of Babylon. See, for example, the passages in the Bundahišn ( Anklesaria, Bundahishn, 268) and Dēnkard Book Seven (Molé, La legende, 56). Armenian traditions identify the dragon Aždahak as a Mede (Russell, Zoroastrianism in Armenia, 44-45). In the Ferdōwsī's Shāh Nāmeh, the evil king Ḍaḥāk is described as having two man-eating snakes growing out of his shoulders. Martin Schwartz argues that this curious realization of the Persian name with a typically Arabic spelling—the Arabic phonemes ḍ and ḥ are not pronounced in Persian—associates Ḍaḥākwith the Arab other. See further Schwartz, \"The Snake-Man from Indo-Iranian to Ferdowsī, with New Evidence for the Continuum,\" 276.74.This word, the usual Aramaic term for the Torah, appears in various spellings a handful of times in Zoroastrian Pahlavi literature.

He found Mašīh [and] propagated the Jewish faith and afterward the deceitof the demons. (16) And Dahāg enjoyed harming the creatures. He saw the prin-ciple of evil dēn in the pronouncement of Judaism, in . . . the decline of the Mazdean dēn and Iran through heresy, he fatefully renewed it a second and third time in the world,75 through which came about victory for the demons and corrup-tion of human nature, the pollution and desolation of the world, the greatest evil tocreatures, inversion, distress and hardship for the good and ascent, prosperity and kingship for the evil.The creation of Judaism is a tool to propagate the evil principle and its history and heroes—Abraham, Moses, the Torah, and Jerusalem—are revealed to be of demonic origin. The goal of this passage, unlike the examples of the first polemical type discussed above, is not to state or refute any particular doctrine, though Dahāg's rest might be an allusion to the Sabbath, but rather to undercut the whole enterprise of Judaism by classifying it as a product of demonic, world-destroying cunning.Jewish doctrines are referred to in the second passage in DK 3:288,76 but here too the point is revealing Judaism's demonic origins and its opposition to the good religion, Zoroas-trianism. As in DK 3:227, the text contrasts Yima and Dahāg as the founders of the two rival faiths. In reaction to Yima's ten wise counsels, Dahāg authored ten wishes or desires (kām). These ten demonic commandments are, as discussed above, as much the opposites of Yima's principles as they have any connection to Jewish belief. For instance, in the second com-mandment (3:288:3) Dahāg orders sacrifice to the demons, in contrast to Yima's advice (han-darzēnīd) not to sacrifice to the demons. The seventh commandment obligates \"taking away from everyone\"77 in opposition to Yima's counsel to give gifts. Targum Hosea 9:10 and Targum Job 20:4. Itō interprets the underlying Middle Persian as naxust, connecting it with the naxustīn niβǝ̄ in ŠGW 13:1. This ideogram, however, does not appear in any of the standard wordlists (ie Nyberg, Frahang i Pahlavīk).75.Shaked, \"Zoroastrian Polemics,\" 99 translates \"he destroyed luminosity a second and third time.\" This translation makes much more sense in the context, being a negative rather than a positive action, but the necessary emendation is difficult to justify in the text itself. A parallel passage from 229:15 (Madan, Dinkard, 255-57; Dresden, Dēnkart, supplement 22-B 193; de Menasce, Le troisième livre du Dēnkart, 241-43; Shaked, \"Zoroastrian Polemics,\" 100-1) can shed light on the conundrum: (15) az dahāg ō abrāhām ī yahudān dastwar madan az awe pad fradom ud didīgar sidīgar yahūdīh *wihīrīhistan [ms: WʾRŠSTN']. pad harw nōg ērān dēhān mardōm pad ēwēnag ēwēnag freh-būd ud abē-būd a-dād wēš čandēnīdan ud tabāhānīdan.(15) From Dahāg it [the evil dēn] came to Abrāhām the priest of the Jews and from him it changed into the first, second and third Judaisms. In each innovation the people of the provinces of Iran were shaken and destroyed by various sorts of excess, deficiency and lawlessness.While the phenomena to which the first, second and third Judaisms refer remains unclear, the renovations discussed in DK 227:16 are of Judaism itself. If that is the case, brēhīhā (or brāhīhā) can be taken as the adverbrather than the object of the sentence.76.Madan, Dinkard, 298-299; Dresden, Dēnkart, 227-228; de Menasce, Le troisième livre du Dēnkart, 284-285; Shaked, \"Zoroastrian Polemics,\" 101-103.77.DK 3:288:8: dahāg awe rāy appurdan ī az harw kas framūdan.- 116 -"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"However, other statements either refer specifically to Judaism or bear a resemblance to doctrines familiar from Jewish texts. At DK 3:288:9, in opposition to Yima's council that cattle be killed only then they research maturity, Dahāg \"taught to kill cattle freely, according to the custom of the Jews.\"78 Despite the reference to Judaism here, this passage does not seem to relate to some underlying Jewish practice. On the contrary, killing cattle freely is precisely not what the Jewish religion commands.79 Closer to Jewish realia is 3:288:10, a passage which seems to target circumcision. There Dahāg advocates that \"every fruit of man should be castrated and branded, according to the custom of the Jews.\"80 This counsel is opposed to Yima's more measured advice to geld only those cattle who are in difficulty and not of use. Unlike the strictly doctrinal type of anti-Jewish polemic discussed above, the content of the two lists of dueling commandments is not the point of this passage. Rather, the com-mandments adds substance to the mythic frame story of Judaism's demonic origins given in more detail in chapters 228 and 229 as well as in the concluding paragraph of DK 3:288:12: pad im 10 dām-ziyān handarz padīrag 10 ī jam dām-sūd handarz ōraytā nibēg bun kard ud81 andar ūrušlem dāštan framūd. ud az ān pas abrāhām ī jahūdān dastwar kār padiš kard ud mūšāg ān-š sridag(?)82 ī jahūd ud pad waxšwar dārēnd frazāmēnīdan ud yašuwag bar nūn83 ī awe mūšāg āšnūd būd rawāgēnīd gōwēnd. ud harw jahūd sridag(?) andar xwēš bahr dārēnd ud padiš wurrōyēnd.By these ten harmful counsels, which are opposed to Yima's ten beneficial coun-sels, he established the ōraytā-scripture and ordered it to be kept in Jerusalem.84 And afterwards Abrāhām the priest of the Jews enacted it and Mūšāg who is the sridag of the Jews and whom they hold as a prophet completed it and Yašuwag barNūn who was Mūšāg's disciple propagated it, as they say.

Both Dārāy the son of Dārāy, the king who preceded Alexander's destruction of Iran, and Shapur I are depicted as ordering copies of the Avesta to be deposited in the \"royal treasury\" (ganj ī šāhīgān). For these texts see Shaki, \"Scriptures,\" esp. 115 n. 2 on the reading of šāhīgān.- 117 -"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"As in the earlier passages, Dahāg is the author of the Jewish scripture, a text based on but more extensive than the ten evil commandments discussed in the passage. Abraham and Moses are key figures in enacting and propagating the demonic scripture. The passage also seems to mention Joshua, Moses' successor. An element that stands out in these passages, as Shaked has discussed, is syncretism. Biblical characters like Abraham and Moses are woven into a syncretic Zoroastrian religious history. Judaism is an evil offshoot, but nonetheless an integral part of, a single, universal story. As the demonic reaction to or imitation of Yima's wise counsels, Judaism is unthink-able without a Zoroastrian model to mirror and reverse. Deeply and significantly, Jewish his-tory is Zoroastrian history. Shaked instructively compares this and other passages to the later syncretic histories of the early Islamic period that combine Iranian, Jewish and Islamic materials into a single universal narrative.85 Ṭabarī's History, for instance, exemplifies this later tendency86 that might well be rooted in syncretizing traditions already present in Sasanian Iran. However, the incorporation of Jewish origins into Zoroastrianism has theological as well as historical significance. This adoption is part of the tendency Yuhan Vevaina has identified in Pahlavi interpretative literature—among which the Third Book of the Dēnkard should certainly be included—towards \"exegetical totalization,\" which he explains as \"attempts to extend the dēnto include all forms of knowledge.\"87 As an example of this tendency we can recall the famous history of the Zoroastrian scriptures in Dēnkard Book Four (MS. B 512:16-510:9). According to this text, both Ardeshir, the founder of the Sasanian dynasty, and Shapur his son expanded the dēn. Shapur included the various arts (such as medicine, astronomy, physics, and metaphysics) scattered in Rome and India. Similarly, Ardeshir's chief priest Tansar is said to claim: \"any exposition which differs from that in the Mazdayasnian dēn, but which provides awareness and knowl-edge, is not inferior to it.\"88 The Dēnkard's incorporation of Judaism is part of this same expansive interpretation. Regardless of the negative perception of the rival religion, the dēn has expanded to include Judaism inasmuch as Judaism is portrayed as arising from and in reaction to the dēn. Even if only on a metaphorical level, Judaism's origin in the mind of the demon Dahāg inscribes it within the mythical and symbolic universe of Zoroastrianism. Though Judaism is strange and, certainly, evil, it is not foreign; having been adopted within the mythic framework of the origins of the good religion, Judaism is intelligible on the Good Religion's own terms as Zoroastrianism's primal Other.85.Shaked, \"Zoroastrian Polemics,\" 89-91.86.See, for example, the discussion of Bēwarāsb—another name for Dahāg—in Ṭabarī, From the Creation to the Flood, 344:Some(one) said: Bēwarāsb ruled in the time of Idrīs. Some of Adam's speeches had happened to reach him, and he used them to perform magic. Bēwarāsb practiced that magic. When he wanted something from anywhere in his realm, or when he liked a mount or a woman, he blew into a gold-en reed (pipe) he had, and everything he wished for would come to him. This is the origin of (the custom of the) Jews to blow (the shofar). 87.Vevaina, \"Enumerating the Dēn,\" 116.88.See Cereti, La letteratura pahlavi, 59-61 for the text and translation and Vevaina, \"Enumerating the Dēn,\" 116.- 118 -"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Between the Dēnkard and the ŠGWI will now turn to a comparison of the characterization of Judaism in the Dēnkard and in the ŠGW. There are several points of agreement between the two texts on this issue. First of all, the characterization of Judaism in Chapter 150 as the doctrine which irrationally deniesthe primordial existence of two opposed principles also underlies the ŠGW's critique. As has been demonstrated at length elsewhere in this dissertation, the combination, in the character of Ādīnō, of good and evil, wisdom and ignorance, revenge and mercy, is a recurrent theme both of the citations from Jewish scripture and the critiques of those citations. This illogical combination is the basic monotheistic error. More specifically, DK 227's highlighting of the Jewish belief that the creator regrets is a motif found in the ŠGW critique of Judaism. ŠGW 14:32-33 explicitly target's the Jewish scripture's depiction of God's regret (pašǝ̄mąnī) at cre-ating the world. Though they are not as foregrounded as in the Dēnkard, Jewish figures are also men-tioned in the ŠGW. The introduction to the citations in ŠGW Chapter Thirteen explains that they (presumably the Jews) believe that the First Scripture was given by God to Moses. The citations in Chapter Thirteen, of course, prominently mention Adam and Eve.89 Likewise, Abraham and Isaac appear in 14:40-50.90 The ŠGW's presentation of these Jewish characters is more scattered than the Dēnkard's depiction of a Jewish chain of tradition in chapter 288, for example, from Dahāg via Abraham and Moses to Yehoshua ben Nun. Nevertheless, the two most important Jewish characters in the Dēnkard's critique are also mentioned in the ŠGW. The demonic origin of Judaism is also present, if in a different form, in the ŠGW's cri-tique. While Dahāg is never mentioned, the concluding sentences of Chapter Fourteen claim that, according to the depictions of God from the Jewish scripture, that God must be none other than Ahriman himself:(82) nuṇ agar ą yazaṯ kǝš īṇ nišą u dašaa ąš rāstī ažaš dūr (83) u aβaxšāišni ažaš bǝ̄gąnī (84) vaš dānāī aβar nǝ̄ vaxt (85) ci īṇ x́aṯ hast drūž i dōžax sālār i *tār91 grīstaa i tam tuxmaa (86) kǝš vahǝ̄ftagą i dǝ̄βī vadagą pa ādīnō nąm stāeṇd u namāž barǝṇd.(82) Now if these are the signs and tokens of that God, then truth is far from him, (83) mercy is unknown to him, (84) he has no part of wisdom, (85) and therefore he himself is the druž,92 the lord of Hell, of gloomy darkness, of the dark race (86) whom those perverted by demonic evil praise and worship by the name Ādīnō.Given that ŠGW 13:1 states that it was this God himself who gave the First Scripture to Moses, we have here a close parallel to the Dēnkard's account of the origin of the Jewish 89.On these citations see the discussion in Chapter Four.90.On this story see the discussion in Chapter Two.91.MSS. tar, though MS.

Just as Dahāg gave the ōraytā to Moses, here it is Ahriman who passes the demonic text to the prophet's own hand. In addition to these thematic similarities between the two critiques, both also con-struct the Jewish object that they attack. In other words, the primary reference point for both is not Jewish sources, beliefs, or practices but Zoroastrian theology, history, and self-percep-tion. The projection, as one might call it, of Judaism is more readily seen in the Dēnkard. Both the doctrinal and mythological representations of Judaism are determined by the con-tours of the Zoroastrian polemical discourse. In the first instance, Judaism, as stated above, ismade to occupy the monotheistic position in a schematic rubric of rival faiths, from the athe-ism of the Sophists to the over-extensive dualism of Manichaeism. In the mythic texts as well, Judaism is incorporated into Zoroastrianism and defined against and in opposition to theGood Religion. The text even makes this opposition a theme: Dahāg's creation of Judaism and the propagation of its laws are a reaction to the good dēn and Yima's wise counsels. These polemical passages are not responses to nor evidence of what historical Jews practiced and believed; even those references, for example to circumcision, which do parallel Jewish belief and practice, are over-determined by their Zoroastrian context. It is not surprising that the Dēnkard's polemics construct Judaism in this way. As Albert de Jong has pointed out, religious polemics, Zoroastrian and otherwise, are not meant to be historically accurate or anthropologically sound; they are texts designed for internal consumption, making use of existing stereotypes of the rival religion that are then applied to the particular offensive doctrine under discussion.93 This same observation also holds true forthe ŠGW. In the ŠGW the monotheistic aspect of Judaism, opposed to Zoroastrian dualism, is given even more prominence. This is seen, first of all, in the overwhelmingly theological content of the citations. All the citations express the Jewish God's ignorance, powerlessness, evil-doing, and non-transcendence. This is most evident in the brief citations from the begin-ning of Chapter Fourteen describing Ādīnō's vengeance, anger, regret, and his resemblance tothe destructive forces of nature. However, when taken as a whole, the longer narratives, meaning the garden citation from Chapter Thirteen and Ādīnō's encounters with saints and angels from Chapter Fourteen, are also primarily depictions of the Jewish God's interactions with his creations. God is the sole protagonist of these citations, to the exclusion of any othercharacters. Mardānfarrox's critique of the citations reinforces their theological coloring. He reads the citations as if they were only theological maxims and the narrative elements of those citations that are presented as stories are occluded in his reading of them.Judaism as TextThe difference between the ŠGW and the Dēnkard lies not in the fact that the object of the critique of Judaism is a projection but the nature of that projected object. The object ofthe Dēnkard's critique is the Jewish religion (jahūd kēš) itself. This is best characterized in the mythic account of Dahāg's invention of Judaism. The premise underlying this mythical text is that Judaism is inherently knowable, tangible, and approachable. The Zoroastrian observer of Judaism does not need to rely on Jewish accounts of or perspectives on the rival 93.Albert de Jong, \"Zoroastrian Religious Polemics and their Contexts,\" in Religious Polemics in Context, ed. A. van der Kooij and Theo L. Hettema (Assen: Royal Van Gorcum, 2004), 48-63.- 120 -"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"religion. In so far as Judaism is internal to and part of Zoroastrianism, its laws, prophets, andrevelation can be understood within the Good Religion's own categories of the divine and the demonic. Indeed, inasmuch as the Zoroastrian reader of this Dēnkard passage has knowledgeof the positive law and dēn against which Judaism is the negative reaction, he can know the rival religion better and more truly than the Jews themselves. Though the perspective of the Dēnkard is from the outside, it is at the same time deep and penetrates to the core of Judaism.Even taking the expansion of the dēn to include Judaism as described above metaphorically, we can say that, in the Dēnkard, Judaism is within the epistemological compass of Zoroastrianism.The Dēnkard does not quote from Jewish writing at all. While the texts do state that Dahāg's ten negative commandments are related to the contents of the Jewish scripture, the precise nature of that relation—be it as foundation, summary, or selection—is unclear. Much depends on the interpretation of the \"by\" in the phrase \"by these ten harmful counsels . . . he established the ōraytā\" in chapter 288. By contrast, the object of the ŠGW's critique is pre-cisely the Jewish text. This text is depicted as lying outside of the sacred history of Zoroas-trianism and Judaism itself is, thereby, unknowable as an immediate object. A correct under-standing of the religion, parallel to that of the perception of Dahāg's authorship of Judaism and its demonic nature in the Dēnkard, must be mediated through quotations from the text and preceded in by their interpretation. The citations from the Jewish scripture only speak, oronly speak properly, after Mardānfarrox interprets them and demonstrates the incoherence and contradiction of the monotheistic theology they espouse and represent. It is only after such careful reading and interpretation that Mardānfarrox can arrive at the conclusion, through the operation of deductive reasoning, which, in the Dēnkard, is self-evident: Judaism's demonic origin. This difference can be demonstrated by comparing two similar passages from the Dēnkard and the ŠGW. DK 3:288:11 includes the following item in the list of Yima's good counsels and Dahāg's evil counter-commands. In opposition to Yima's counsel to \"store up insummer and winter for expenses,\"dahāg an-āmurzīgīhā kēn pad menišn hambārdan pad-iz 9 āwādag tōxtan guft.Dahāg said that one should store up vengeance in one's spirit up to nine genera-tions and seek requital.94The underlying contrast between Yima and Dahāg's commands is quite clear. Whereas Yima's command is practical, economical, and world-affirming, Dahāg's counsel leads to the growth of retribution and destruction. Especially in the agricultural context of Yima's state-ment, Dahāg's counsel would lead to fallow land and the abandonment of agriculture, culture 94.The translation follows Shaked, \"Zoroastrian Polemics,\" 103. De Menasce, Le troisième livre du Dēnkart, 285 has \"Dahāg, avec une haine impitoyable dans l'esprit, dit qu'il fallait engranger et, au bout de 9 génerations, les donner en échange.\" On the basis of the comparison with the ŠGW, Shaked's interpretationis more likely. This passage is, of course, reminiscent of certain biblical passages: Genesis 4:15, Deuteronomy 32:5, Exodus 20:5, and 34:7; Shapira, \"Biblical Quotations,\" 180-81 discusses the various Judeo-Persian translations. On the connection between the Dēnkard passage and the Bible see Shaked, \"Zoroastrian Polemics\", 93.- 121 -"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"and civilization. Such a valorization of intergenerational vengeance would not only leave little time for agricultural activities but would make impossible the trust and relationships on which trade and commerce are based. The ŠGW includes an almost identical citation in the critique of Judaism, but there inter-generational vengeance is cast in a different context. The text appears at the beginning of Chapter Fourteen:(1) vaem kām ku nihaṇgǝ̄ ǝž ham-aṇbasānī u pur-ǝ̄raṇgī i ham niβǝ̄ naβaštom (2) ku pur ǝž har bažaī u dǝ̄βī, u ǝž hazār yak i ažaš pǝ̄dā aṇgirdīe nigǝ̄žom (3) padaš farmāiiast nigarīdan (4) naxust īṇ i gōeṯ aβar x́ǝ̄š cūnī (5) ku mǝ̄n hom Ādīnō xīn-x́āh95 (6) u xīn-θōž (7) u xīn i96 haft-aṇbādaa pa farzaṇdą θōžom (8) vaem bun97 xīn nǝ̄ farmōšǝṯ.(1) And I wish to write a little about the contradiction and error of that same Scrip-ture (2) which is full of every evil and devilishness, and I will briefly expose a thousandth of what it contains; (3) one is commanded to examine it. (4) First it says this about his own nature: (5) \"I am God, vengeance seeking (6) and vengeance taking (7) and I repay the vengeance of seven generations on the chil-dren (8) and I never forget the root of my vengeance.\"98In considering this citation, we can note first of all that the ŠGW's version is an exam-ple of the theologization of the Jewish object discussed above. While Dahāg's command in the Dēnkard was addressed to individuals, in the ŠGW inter-generational vengeance has become an aspect of the divine.99 Along with this internal change, the statement has been completely recontextualized. Instead of the demonic backstory of Yima and Dahāg that givescontext and meaning to the statement, the passage is recast as a citation of the First Scripture. In this new context, as much as the citation has the weight of authority and authenticity—this is what the Jews actually say—the citation is ungrounded. Without the dialogue between the good and evil dēn, without Yima's counsels and Dahāg's counter-commands, why would the Jewish God even think of storing up vengeance in this way? Cast as a citation, the statement requires a further act—interpretation—to make apparent its deepest meaning. Entailed in the ŠGW's critical object becoming a Jewish text is an epistemological boundary between 95.The Pazand xīn is contrasted with the Pahlavi form kēn, both being vengeance (MacKenzie, CPD, 51). Martin Schwartz suggests that the two forms reflect two different Avestan words: kaēnā-, meaning \"retribution,\" \"retaliation\" or \"revenge\" (Bartholomae, Altiranisches Wörterbuch, 429) and aēnah-, meaning\"force,\" \"iniquity\" or \"crime\" (Bartholomae, Altiranisches Wörterbuch, 21). However, in the ŠGW the two forms seem to be virtually synonymous. This might be connected with the fact that both Avestan words are rendered in the Pahlavi translation of the Avesta by kēn.96.MS.

Judaism in the ŠGW is out-side the sphere of Zoroastrian knowledge, which is what I mean by it being inside or outside the dēn, and can only be accessed secondarily, through interpretation.100Zoroastrianism as TextThe ŠGW and the Dēnkard direct their attacks against two different Jewish objects, the First Scripture in the one instance and Jewish doctrine or the Jewish religion in the other. These two polemics also present two different underlying relationships between Judaism and Zoroastrianism. In the Dēnkard's case, Judaism, in so far as it is included in the expanded dēn, is presented as knowable and penetrable. Judaism comes from and is an evil offshoot of Zoroastrianism; the two religions are, for that reason, equally present. The relationship between Judaism and Zoroastrianism in the Dēnkard is as close as the relationship between Yima and Dahāg: they resemble each other, they respond to each other (or, at least, Judaism responds to Zoroastrianism), and they know each other.101In the ŠGW, the relationship between Judaism and Zoroastrianism is more complex. As has been mentioned above, Judaism in the ŠGW, in the form of the First Scripture, is not immediately knowable or penetrable, requiring an act of interpretation to make apparent its true, demonic nature. Understanding Zoroastrianism in this formation to be represented by Mardānfarrox or the book he writes, the two doctrines are so different as to be almost mutu-ally unintelligible. Not only is the First Scripture require interpretation by Mardānfarrox and the ŠGW, the two entities are of different orders of being: the First Scripture is fragmentary and elusive while the ŠGW is ordered, clear, and whole.102 This seems a far cry from the back-and-forth of Yima and Dahāg in the Dēnkard. However, there is an additional reading of the relationship between Judaism and Zoroastrianism in the ŠGW. The Zoroastrian side in this relationship can be filled by another element, namely the Dēnkard itself. As I will explain in more detail in what follows, the ref-erences to and citations from the Dēnkard in the ŠGW relate to the the citations from the FirstScripture in the same way that Zoroastrianism relates to Judaism in the myth of Yima and Dahāg. In this formulation, Judaism and Zoroastrianism, in other words the First Scripture 100.Paul Ricoeur, Freud and Philosophy: An Essay on Interpretation (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1970)discusses two types of interpretation, contrasting two opposed hermeneutical poles. The first, \"interpretation as a recollection of meaning,\" he characterizes as faith, in the sense that \"it seeks, through interpretation, a second naïveté\" (28). This species of interpretation is represented by phenomenology and the phenomenology of religion in particular. The second type, represented by Nietzsche, Marx and Freud, is \"interpretation as an exercise in suspicion.\" All three thinkers, in different ways, engage in a process of demystification of the illusions of consciousness which ends with the aim of expanding consciousness over and against is false other. As Ricoeur writes of Freud's insight, \"analysis wishes to substitute for an immediate and dissimulating consciousness a mediate consciousness taught by the reality principle\" (35) Mardānfarrox's interpretation is of the second type. 101.In Zoroastrian myth as preserved in Avestan, Middle Persian, and later sources, Yima and Dahāg have a close and combative relationship. Yima is the primordial king who sins, loses his crown, and is replaced byDahāg on the throne. For a comprehensive discussion of the primary sources and scholarly literature see Skjaervo, \"Jamšid,\" 501-22.102.Interestingly, this description of the relationship between Judaism and Zoroastrianism bears some resemblance to the relationship between the gardener and the vermin in the ŠGW's garden parable discussed in Chapter Four.- 123 -"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"and the Dēnkard, are better paired. Both are authoritative, if fragmentary texts, and both are contained and interpreted within the larger structure of the ŠGW. Moreover, when inter-preted correctly, both the Dēnkard and the First Scripture reveal equal, if opposite truths: the one of the nature of Ohrmazd and the truth of the Zoroastrian dualism and the other the nature of Ahriman and the falseness of (Jewish) monotheism. Rather than come down in favor of either of these readings of the ŠGW's depiction of the relationship between Judaism and Zoroastrianism, I contend that the ŠGW holds both in tension. The particular textuality of Judaism in the ŠGW, casting the Jewish polemical objectas citations from a text, the First Scripture, sustains both possibilities. The fragmentary textu-ality of the First Scripture, composed of citations, entails both disconnection from and equal-ity with Zoroastrianism. Furthermore, underlying the ŠGW's doubled relationships is a response to Judaism as portrayed in the Dēnkard's own polemics.On the one hand, the textual rendition of the Jewish critical object serves to mask the loss of the close relationship between Judaism and Zoroastrianism as they appear in the Dēnkard. That is to say, what is absent is not the mythic origins of Judaism in Zoroastrian-ism, meaning not the story of Yima and Dahāg, but the immediacy and accessibility of the knowledge of the rival religion that ground the myth. The First Scripture guards against the perception of this loss through the overabundance of polemical material. Compared with the Dēnkard's polemics, the ŠGW contains a wealth of information, and, what's more, seemingly authentic accounts of what the Jews really say. The citations are filled with characters, sto-ries and foreign names. However the abundance of details can never take the place of the Dēnkard's knowable Judaism.At the same time, the citations from the First Scripture also provide a mechanism for reaching the knowledge that has become unknowable. For not only has Judaism become a text in the ŠGW, but Zoroastrianism has been texualized as well. The relationship between the two faiths in the ŠGW is the relationship between two texts. Turning back to the autobiographical passage I cited at the beginning of this chapter, Mardānfarrox's realization of the truth of Zoroastrianism comes not, for instance, in the form of a divine revelation, but from reading the Dēnkard. This is significant both in the sense thatthe source of authority is a book and not a divine vision or heavenly journey103 and that it is this particular book. Mardānfarrox does not read the Gāthās or the Vīdēvdād, not poetry or law, but a book which it would not be an exaggeration to call philosophy or, at least, theol-ogy. The Dēnkard is a book of propositions, arguments and doctrines. Not only in this one passage recounting his own profound enlightenment but throughout the ŠGW the Dēnkard is the authoritative source for the proofs of the existence of Ohrmazd and Ahriman, of good andevil and the radical difference between them. It is in this sense that Zoroastrianism in the ŠGW can be said to be a text, the Dēnkard: it is in this text, not in others and not through other means, that the truth of Zoroastrianism can be accessed. 103.Examples of both of these kinds of revelations are to be found in Zoroastrian literature. For instance, the righteous character Wirāz goes on an otherworldly journey to heaven and hell in the Ardā Wirāz Nāmag. The Sasanian-era Zoroastrian priest Kirdēr describes a similar vision in an inscriptional text. For the inscription see Martin Schwartz, \"Kirdēr's Clairvoyants: Extra-Iranian and Gathic Perspectives,\" in Iranian Languages and Texts from Iran and Turan, ed. Maria Macuch, et al. (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2007), 367-76.- 124 -"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Even as it occludes the relationship between Judaism and Zoroastrianism, the exis-tence of the First Scripture allows Judaism and Zoroastrianism to relate on an equal plane, as texts. Judaism in the Dēnkard is the primeval Other, the demonic counterpart to Zoroastrian-ism; remember Dahāg \"saw the principle of evil dēn in the pronouncement of Judaism.\" In making Judaism into the textual counterpart to Zoroastrianism, the ŠGW preserves a version of the deep relationship between the two rival religions. A significant gap separates them in the ŠGW, a gap that cannot be transversed by perception but only by interpretation. How-ever, in casting both the source of Zoroastrian authoritative knowledge and the Jewish criticalobject as texts, there exists in the ŠGW a semblance of the relationship between Yima and Dahāg it appears in the Dēnkard, a semblance that preserves that earlier relationship preciselyby recalling its absence. ConclusionIn this chapter I have explored the relationship between the passages polemicizing against Judaism in the Dēnkard and the ŠGW's critique of Judaism. In both cases, the Jewishobject is constructed and does not reflect access to authoritative or authentic Jewish sources. However, the significant difference between the two texts is that the ŠGW critiques a Jewish text and not, as in the Dēnkard, a projection of the rival religion itself. Unlike previous chapters that have focused on a particular citation or citations, this chapter has offered an interpretation of the ŠGW's First Scripture as a whole. In so doing, myargument here expands on a larger scale arguments from previous chapters. Chapters Three and Four focused on motifs that are shared between citations in the critique of Judaism, among the various critiques and other chapters in the ŠGW. Through the comparison with the Dēnkard, I have attempted to show how another motif, the motif of written scripture and revelation through reading, connects the critique of Judaism to the rest of the ŠGW. Recog-nizing the existence of this motif changes the interpretation of Mardānfarrox's claim to have cited from the First Scripture. This chapter argues that this First Scripture should not be understood—or, at the very least, not primarily—as a literal text but as a polemical and liter-ary strategy. From the perspective of the dissertation as a whole, this reading serves to fur-ther underline the critique of Judaism's contextualization within the ŠGW.In earlier chapters of this dissertation I have challenged previous scholars' focus on the sources of the citations in the ŠGW's critique of Judaism. In this chapter, in contrast, I argue that the ŠGW is responding directly, if not exclusively, to the Dēnkard's anti-Jewish polemics in depicting the Jewish critical object as a text. While there is a difference between these two arguments, I believe there is no contradiction. Rather than looking outside the ŠGW and Zoroastrian literature for the source of a citation or argument, I contend that the ŠGW is in dialogue with Zoroastrian texts and traditions as it constructs its critique. This dynamic perspective both maintains the subservience of the critique's arguments and citationsto the overall structure of the ŠGW and demonstrates how that structure was composed in response to larger literary and cultural tradition.- 125 -"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Chapter Six:ConclusionThis dissertation proposes a new, contextualized reading of the critique of Judaism in the ŠGW. This reading situates the critique of Judaism as central to the ŠGW's larger goal of demonstrating the irrationality and contradiction of monotheism. The project of this disserta-tion cannot be undertaken without addressing several fundamental questions. What is con-textualized reading? What is critique? And what is the Judaism to which I refer? This dis-sertation has attempted to answer these questions. In conclusion, I will consider further questions raised by these answers.What is Contextualized Reading?This dissertation begins by distinguishing its approach from that taken by previous scholars who have studied the ŠGW's critique of Judaism. They have focused almost exclu-sively on the question of how the citations of the First Scripture in ŠGW Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen relate to parallel passages in Jewish literature, in particular the Bible and rab-binic writings. In other words, previous scholars have been concerned with the question of the sources of the ŠGW's critique. I have argued, on the contrary, that the critique of Judaismis best understood in its context in the ŠGW. In other words, I have argued that the citations and arguments in the critique are best understood in light of the literary structure and theolog-ical goals of the ŠGW itself. These two approaches are by no means mutually exclusive: one can ask both where a passage comes from and what it means in its context. However, at leastfor a text like the ŠGW's critique, I think that the contextual reading should be primary. Onlyafter establishing how the critique of Judaism relates to Mardānfarrox's larger goals in the ŠGW does the question of the critique's relation to outside literature become meaningful. The method I have used to establish the critique of Judaism's meaning in context is identifying recurring literary motifs. Following in the footsteps of Straussian readers of Plato, I have taken the repetition of the motifs of angels, gardens, and written texts to be theo-logically significant. Rather than literary window-dressing, these motifs encapsulate some ofthe ŠGW's central theological problems, namely divine unity or duality, theodicy, and revela-tion. Moreover, the repetition of motifs serves to demonstrate the underlying agreement of sections of the ŠGW that are not overtly connected, such as the critiques against the various monotheistic religions in the case of the motif of gardens.Like Plato's dialogues—and this is part of the reason that studies on Plato were so useful in formulating the approach to this dissertation—the ŠGW is a text that is rich both philosophically and literarily. It has complex and highly developed arguments as well as metaphors, parables, and myths. The discussion of the three motifs that were my focus in thisdissertation by no means exhausts the investigation of the ŠGW's symbolic vocabulary. Not only can other recurring motifs be identified connecting the critique of Judaism with other chapters in the ŠGW, but the cultural context underlying the prominence given to these par-ticular motifs can be further explored. In this dissertation I have examined why so much attention is given to angels and gardens. I have argued that these motifs might relate to the belief in an angelic co-regent in late antique and early Islamic Judaism on the one hand and the connection between gardens and kingship in Iranian culture on the other. - 126 -"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"I would make a similar tentative proposal for the final motif that I consider, that of revelation by means of a written text. As I argue in Chapter Five, the textuality of Judaism inthe ŠGW—in other words, the critique's focus on the First Scripture—contrasts with the Dēnkard's anti-Jewish polemics. However, the primacy accorded to the First Scripture is quite similar to the importance given to the Dēnkard itself in the ŠGW. In both instances, insight happens through reading a written text. Mardānfarrox realizes the truth of Zoroastri-anism, as he states in ŠGW Chapter Ten, by reading the Dēnkard. Just so, he realizes the falsehood and true, demonic identity of the Jewish God by reading the First Scripture. The precise cultural context of the renaissance of Zoroastrian literature that occurred several centuries after the Muslim conquest—the composition of the \"ninth century books\" asHarold Bailey called them1—are unknown. What does seem clear, however, is that Mardān-farrox was writing at a time when Zoroastrian texts that had been, until then, preserved orallywere written down for the first time. On a larger scale, the recording of these Zoroastrian tra-ditions coincided with a larger movement from orality to textuality. Evidence of this transi-tion, as well as of resistance to it, can be seen in Islamic, Jewish, and other literature from theperiod.2 While this is a matter for further study, I would propose that the motif of insight through reading in the ŠGW, which entails a radically new understanding of sacred literature, canon, and authority in Zoroastrianism, can be fruitfully interpreted as a response to this changing relationship between orality and textuality in the culture at large. In describing contextualized reading at the beginning of this section, I contrasted it with a source-oriented approach to the citations in the critique of Judaism. The importance ofthe above discussion of the motif of textuality in the ŠGW lies in the insight that contextual-ized reading is also culturally contextualized reading. That is to say that the ŠGW should be interpreted in light of what we know of the historical, cultural, and literary scene in the ninth and tenth centuries. However, at the same time the ŠGW itself adds to our knowledge of that cultural context. Rather than, as some scholars have assumed, the ŠGW and its critique of Judaism being only rehashed Sasanian material, in this light the ŠGW reveals itself to be evi-dence of to transformation and upheaval in Zoroastrianism. The ŠGW presents a radical, rationalist solution to the problem of doubt and lack of faith. This area also, of course, demands further research. However, as a marker guiding the direction of that research, I would venture to say that the boldness of the ŠGW's solution, which seeks to refound Zoroas-trianism and its relations with rival faiths on ground of reason, testifies to the challenges Mardānfarrox saw facing himself and his religion.What is Critique?Throughout this dissertation, I have referred to Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen of the ŠGW as a critique. I have used this term as if it were virtually synonymous with polemic. However, there is an important difference between the two terms. Polemic is the more gen-eral term, referring to disputation, controversy, and debate. Polemics can be comprised of 1.Bailey, Zoroastrian Problems in the Ninth Century Books.2.On Judaism, see the sources and further discussion in Chapter Two and most recently Talya Fishman, Becoming the People of the Talmud: Oral Torah as Written Tradition in Medieval Jewish Cultures (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011), 20-64. On Islam, see Schoeler, The Oral and the Written.- 127 -"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"different kinds of arguments employing more or less rational means. Critique, in contrast, is a specific kind of argument, a certain species of polemic. Critique is the argument that refuses to accept as truth what authorities claim to be true. Critique aims to undermine the foundations on which power and subjectivity are based. Through the appeal to reason, the arbitrariness of law, hermeneutics, or authority is revealed and called into question. As Michel Foucault writes: \"critique is the movement by which the subject gives himself the right to question truth on its effects of power and question power on its discourses of truth.\"3Critique, in the sense described above, has a particular historical context, arising as part of the Enlightenment in Western Europe.4 However, taking into consideration the histor-ical context of the ŠGW and the position of Zoroastrianism in the ninth century, I think that the ŠGW as a whole, and not only Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen, should be described as a critique. For the ŠGW undermines authority in two senses. In the first place, the chapters devoted to the revealed religions, in particular Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, question the foundations of monotheism. These include the rational demolition of the monotheists' argu-ments as well as showing the contradictions in their scriptures. Mardānfarrox's critique of theFirst Scripture, as I have discussed in the body of this dissertation, is a crucial to that project. However, Mardānfarrox's critique is not only theological but also political. Monotheism was the ruling theology that dictated Zoroastrianism's subordinate status. Without arguing that thecritique of Judaism is simply a veiled critique of Islam as such, I do think that ascendant political monotheism is the target of the ŠGW's critique. In other words, Mardānfarrox attacks the monotheistic—Islamic, Jewish and Christian—portrayals of God as a willful, vio-lent tyrant not only for their own sake. This critique entails a questioning of the truth claims of the authority whose power is founded in the revelation of the deity they claim to be one, true God.Just as importantly, however, is the ŠGW's character as a critique of Zoroastrianism. Mihaela Timuș has pointed to the importance of the fact that Mardānfarrox is not a priest and does not come from one of the important priestly families.5 Perhaps not surprisingly, given his position, Mardānfarrox states that he set out on his question for knowledge because he refused to blindly accept the religion of his birth but preferred to adhere to that faith that mostaccorded with reason. That he ultimately arrives at the conclusion that Zoroastrianism is the most rational is, from the critical perspective, neither surprising nor especially important. Forin subordinating revelation to reason and rejecting institutional priestly authority—for he turns to books and not to priests to gain insight—Mardānfarrox embraces a Zoroastrian dual-ism that is thoroughly rationalized and entirely unique. In this sense, Mardānfarrox's rela-tionship to Zoroastrianism can be compared to Spinoza's relation to Judaism: he reestablishesthe religion from first principles, according to universal criteria, and, while the product of thisdistillation bears the same name, it represents a radical break from what came before.Interpretation is a central part of both aspects of the ŠGW's critique. While Mardān-farrox's reads the First Scripture very differently than he reads Zoroastrian sources, interpre-tation is at work in both instances. A critical and still open question is how Mardānfarrox's hermeneutics compare with earlier Zoroastrian interpretation. There is a sizable body of 3.Foucault, \"What is Critique?,\" 32.4.But see Foucault, \"What is Critique?,\" 71.5.Timuș, \"Fonder, bâtir, rénover,\" 15-16.- 128 -"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Zoroastrian literature in Middle Persian devoted to commentaries on the Avesta and this liter-ature displays a versatile set of interpretative tools.6 Does Mardānfarrox read the Dēnkard, the First Scripture, or other texts like earlier Zoroastrian interpreters? Is there a singular hermeneutics in the ŠGW or are different kinds of interpretation employed on different texts?The garden parable in ŠGW Chapter Four, where we catch Mardānfarrox in the act of inter-preting, is a central text for considering these problems. Future comparative research should begin first with this parable and establish the relationship between what one might call the ŠGW's positive hermeneutics and earlier Zoroastrian interpretation. The next step would be to turn to the later chapters and evaluate how, and if, these positive hermeneutics are applied or inverted in Mardānfarrox's critiques.What is Judaism?At the beginning of this dissertation I hypothesized that Chapters Thirteen and Four-teen of the ŠGW are not, in fact, a critique of Judaism at all. I raised the possibility of inter-preting ŠGW Chapters Eleven through Fourteen as a single, undifferentiated critique of monotheism. I dismissed this possibility not because monotheism is not the ultimate object of the ŠGW's critique—as is clear from the immediately preceding discussion, I think that this is the case—but textual clues in the ŠGW indicate that each section is directed at a single critical object. Even though the objects of the critiques go unnamed in both Chapters Eleven and Twelve and Thirteen and Fourteen, key transitional phrases and distinct styles serve to distinguish the two sections. In the introduction, I also raised the further possibility that the object of the critique inChapters Thirteen and Fourteen was not Judaism as such, meaning the faith and practices, or the individuals who adhered to them, but rather the First Scripture. Despite some hesitations,for the sake of convenience throughout this dissertation I have referred to the ŠGW's critique in these chapters as the critique of Judaism.However, the question of the true object of this critique is still live. Is this a critique of Judaism at all? As I mentioned there, at the outset, and throughout this dissertation, there are a considerable similarities between ŠGW Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen and Marcionite,and Manichaean critiques of the Hebrew Bible. Like these earlier writers, Mardānfarrox exposes contradictions in the scriptural narratives and condemns the portrayal of God as evil, violent, and ignorant. Moreover, a number of the ŠGW's critiques of particular passages are also found in Marcionite or Manichaean literature. Further research is necessary to determine to what extent the ŠGW's critique is in dia-logue with these traditions. However, as a preliminary hypothesis it seems likely that this counter-tradition is an important part of the matrix from which Mardānfarrox drew the cita-tions and greatly informed the contours of his critique. In this light, while it is difficult to 6.On Zoroastrian interpretative literature in Middle Persian, see Shaul Shaked, \"The Traditional Commentary on the Avesta (Zand): Translation, Interpretation, Distortion?\" in La Persia e l'Asia Centrale da Alessandro al X secolo (Rome: Accademia nazionale dei Lincei, 1994), 641-56; Alberto Cantera, Studien zur Pahlavi-Übersetzung des Avesta (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2004); Yaakov Elman, \"Scripture Versus Contemporary Needs: A Sasanian/Zoroastrian Example,\" Cardozo Law Review 28 (2006): 101-17; Secunda, \"Sasanian Stam\"; Vevaina, \"Enumerating the Dēn\"; Vevaina, \"Relentless Allusion\" and earlier literature quoted in these studies.- 129 -"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"separate the Jews from the scripture that was revealed to them and which they hold dear, the ŠGW's critique would be primarily a critique of a demonic text, the First Scripture, rather than the critique of Judaism as a doctrine or faith. If that is the case, previous scholars' attempts to use the ŠGW as evidence for a Sasan-ian era or later Middle Persian translation of the Hebrew Bible would be undermined. The ŠGW could also not be taken as evidence for interaction between Jews and Zoroastrians in Mardānfarrox's time or earlier. If a substantial portion of the ŠGW's knowledge of Jews and their scripture is derived from Marcionite or Manichaean writings, neither actual Jews nor Jewish writings were necessary in order to compose the critique. However, this hypothesis does not only lead to a negative result. Reading the ŠGW aspart of a counter-tradition of scriptural interpretation opens up new horizons for considering the history of Marcionite, Manichaean, and other critical hermeneutics. Scholars have identi-fied a number of contemporaries of Mardānfarrox as Manichaeans, Marcionites, or free-thinkers. Were they reading each others' writings? Is there evidence of an intellectual com-munity? Are the ŠGW and these other critiques drawing on a single source or disparate lines of tradition?The tantalizing possibility that Mardānfarrox was in dialogue with other anti-scrip-turalists removes the critique from the parochial fold of Jewish literature and history. If my dissertation argued that the critique in Chapters Thirteen and Fourteen is central to the ŠGW'stext, this conclusion raises the possibility that the critique might also be crucial to understand-ing the ŠGW's cultural context. In other words, the ŠGW's critique should not only be inter-preted in light of its context. As is true of the ŠGW as a whole, the critique is itself evidence of that context.- 130 -"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"BibliographyAbrahamov, Binyamin. \"Necessary Knowledge in Islamic Theology.\" British Journal of Mid-dle Eastern Studies 20 (1993): 20-32.Adang, Camilla.

See Sokoloff, Dictionary, 408 and Shaul Shaked, \"Aramaic Loan-words in Middle Iranian,\" Bulletin of the Asia Institute 19 (2005): 159-68.3.Darmesteter, \"Judaisme\", 5 and Neusner, History, 4:406 take naxustīn niβǝ̄ to refer only to Genesis and not the entire Bible. Shapira, \"Biblical Quotations,\" 117 notes a Judaeo-Arabic parallel in Sa'adia Gaon's reference to the Pentateuch as \"the first prophecy (an-nubuwwah al-ʾūlā), I mean Moses' Torah.\" See further discussion in Haggai Ben-Shammai,\"Saadya's Introduction to Isaiah as an Introduction to the Book of Prophets,\" Tarbiz 60 (1991): 371-404. For my own interpretation see Chapter Five.4.Literally meaning \"noble, free\" (MacKenzie, CPD, 15), this name has never been satisfactorily explained. de Menasce, Apologétique, 182 argues that this is an incorrect reading of the underlying Pahlavi and proposes instead either tōrāt (from Arabic taurāt) or ōraytā, as in DK 3:227 and elsewhere. Neusner, History, 4:406 suggests that the word is a transcription of Hebrew ha-avot or Aramaic avahata, both meaning \"ancestors.\" Neusner bases his suggestion on a passage in BT Avodah Zarah 25a. There, the Bookof the Righteous (Sefer ha-Yashar) is identified there as \"the book of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were called righteous.\" Neusner also quotes Andreas and Barr, Psalmen, vol 1, 9 which translates \"generation\" as awbāt. Itō, \"Pahlavi Hapax Legomena\", 36-37 argues for an underlying Pahlavi form azād meaning \"derivation\" from Proto-Iranian *haca-ata-. Shapira, \"Biblical Quotations\", 117 suggests a connection with Armenian hawatk', meaning \"faith.\" Martin Schwartz suggests a connection to Early Judeo-Persian (a)mwad, which is included in the inscriptions discovered at Tang-i Azao in today's Afghanistan. Walter Bruno Henning (\"The Inscriptions of Tang-i Azao,\" Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 20 [1957]: 335-42) interprets this word, in light of Middle Persian ēmēd and New Persian ōmīd, as \"hope.\" In light of the common designations of the Qurʾān as karīm, \"noble,\" majīd \"glorious\" and similar attributes(Mustansir Mir, \"Names of the Qurʾān,\" in Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān [Leiden: Brill, 2003] 3:505-14), it seems best to follow Darmesteter (Darmesteter, \"Judaisme,\" 5) in taking āžāṯ in a literal sense. The Sanskrit svatantra-, \"independent, free\" (Monier-Williams, Dictionary, 1275) lends support to this inclination.5.This word is used in the same sense at the beginning of Dēnkard Book Six: abar nihang-ē az pōryōtkēšān kard ud dāšt wābar gōwišn ī dēn ī mazdēsn, \"concerning a little of the credible sayings of the Mazdean religion done and held by the orthodox\" (Shaked, Dēnkard VI, 2-3).- 151 -"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"(5) gōeṯ pa bun i niβǝ̄ (6) ku \"fradom būṯ zamī i āβ xūn6 u tąn7 u tārīkī u āβ i siiāh (7) u vaxš i yazaṯ aβar rōṯ8 i ą āβ i siiāh hamǝ̄ niiāβǝṯ.9 (8) pas yazaṯ guft ku10 \"bāṯ rōšanī\" (9) u būṯ rōšanī.

Khalaf al-Tabrīzī at Hyderabad, in interpreting this phrase as \"an island in the midst of the water.\" See Moḥammad Ḥosayn ibn-i Khalaf Tabrizi, Borhān-e Qāteʿ, ed. Mohammad Moʿin (Tehran: Librairie Zowwār, 1953), 1:5. However, the same phrase also appears in the tenth century anonymous commentary Tafsīr-i Qurʾān-i Pāk (on the text see Saeed Hasan Sadat Pajveh Nasri and Manuchehr Danesh, A Thousand Years of Persian Tafsir (Tehran: Neshra Al-Borz, 1990), 57-66) where it refers to one of the humors (Ali Revaqi, ed., Tafsir-i Qur'ān-i Pāk (Tehran: Itisharat-i Bunyād-i Farhang-i Iran, 1968), 34). West, Pahlavi Texts Parts Three, 208 amends to afām \"without form\" and Shapira, \"Biblical Quotations\", 117 to awērān, \"desolate.\" De Menasce, Apologétique, 182 and Neusner, History, 4:406 retain the Pazand as it stands, translating as \"chaos\" and \"dark water\" respectively. The Sanskrit payōrudhirā indicates \"blood-red fluid\" (Monier-Williams, Dictionary, 585 and 884). 7.De Menasce, Apologétique, 182 compares to New Persian tān, \"mouth\" (Steingass, Dictionary, 277) and translates \"abyss.\" Neusner, History, 4:406 proposes an emendation to tan, \"body\" in the sense of \"unformed substance.\" Shapira, \"Biblical Quotations\", 117 emends to tuhīg \"void\" but notes that the Pazand form can also be read as a corruption of tom or tār both meaning \"darkness.\" Sanskrit vistīrṇa means \"strewn\", \"covered,\" or \"expansive\" (Monier-Williams, Dictionary, 1001).8.Shapira, \"Biblical Quotations\", 117 emends to rōy, \"face.\"9.de Menasce, Apologétique, 182 emends to niβāžēṯ. Both Middle Persian wāz- and Parthian waz- mean \"to blow (of the wind),\" \"to move,\" and \"to flow\" (Cheung, Etymological Dictionary, 430; Durkin-Meisterernst, DMMPP, 360). Sanskrit paśyati means \"to see,\" \"look,\" or \"observe\" (Monier-Williams, Dictionary, 611).10.MSS. JJ and JE u, but Sanskrit yat indicates the relative particle i.11. De Menasce, Apologétique, 182 emends to ažǝ̄r, \"below\" or \"under.\" Shapira, \"Biblical Quotations\", 117 emends to abēr, \"very\" or \"much.\" 12.Darmesteter, \"Judaisme\", 5 reads as nēkūn, from nēk meaning \"good,\" similar to xašmūn in 14:48. De Menasce, Apologétique, 182 similarly suggests nēk or nēkōg. West, however, reads nigūn, \"inverted,\" \"upside down.\" The Sanskrit adhōmukha- also indicates \"facing downward\" (Monier-Williams, Dictionary,20). While West's reading is the farthest from the version in Genesis, the vowel shift is confirmed by ŠGW 14:26 (Pazand xōn for Pahlavi xūn). Moreover, nigūn could indicate, perhaps, a polemical pun. In Pahlavi literature, nigūn appears solely in negative contexts; the departed sinner who falls to Hell from the Bridge of Judgement in the DD 20:7 (Jaafari-Dehaghi, DD, 78-79) faces downward; a worshipper is forbidden from holding the sacred twigs (barsōm) upside-down (nigūn) in Nirangestān 48:3; when Fire laments to Ohrmazd at the abuse it will suffer at the hands of careless humans on earth, it hangs its head down (nigūn) and weeps in PRDD 5:4 (Williams, PRDD, 2:97). This same negative connotation is brought out by the Armenian nkun, meaning \"defeated\" or \"contemptible\" (Nyberg, Manual, 2:140).13.cf. New Persian xuspīdan, \"to sleep\" or \"to rest.\"14.Shapira, \"Biblical Quotations\", 117 suggests an emendation to rāy but also notes that rāz is associated in Pahlavi texts with esotericism.

The -ʾyending of ʾhwʾy could have been pronounced as a long ā; this is true of the Pahlavi orthography of words like ʾynyʾ, transcribed ēnyā, meaning \"otherwise\" or \"moreover\" (MacKenzie, CPD, 30). See further Durkin-Meisterernst, DMMPP, 24 and 35 and for the appearance of Adam and Eve in Manichaean literaturesee Sundermann, \"Nomen.\" However, the Pazand forms are also similar to the Arabic Ādam and Ḥawwāʾ. On these names see Horovitz, \"Jewish Proper Names and Derivatives in the Koran\" and Brinner,\" Biblical Names.\"16.While bāγestān does not appear in Pahlavi literature, two other common terms for gardens bāγ and bōyistānappear in the description of the destruction wrought by the Arab conquerers, who \"eat bread like dogs,\" on Iran in the rhymed prose text abar madan ī šāh wahrām ī warzāwand (Jamaspasa and Anklesaria, Pahlavi Texts, 383). A garden (bwystʾn) is mentioned in a Manichaean Middle Persian king parable in M 47 II (verso, l.3). The text is transcribed and translated in Sundermann, Kosmogonische und Parabeltexte, 87-89. The Parthian cognate, spelled bwdystʾn appears in a Manichaean Parthian text from M 47 I (Sundermann, Krichengeschichtlichen, text 10) describing the conversion of Mihr Shah. Thanks to Desmond Durkin-Meisterernst for this reference. For more discussion of gardens see Chapter Four.17.De Menasce reads this word as a denominative from an underlying Pahlavi pāsbān, meaning \"protector\" or \"guardian\" (de Menasce, Apologétique, 184; MacKenzie, CPD, 65; and Durkin-Meisterernst, DMMPP, 259). The word also appears in the Pahlavi translation to Psalms (Andreas and Barr, Psalmen, 106). The Sanskrit translation has praharakeṇaca, from prahakara- \"a watch\" or \"a division of time\" (Monier-Williams, Dictionary, 701). 18.Ultimately from biblical Hebrew ʾAdōnāy, \"my Lord,\" one of the most common biblical epithets for the name of God. On the name see Chapter Two. For the transposition of the vowels see Carl Salemann,\"Über eine Parsenhandschrift der kaiserlichen öffentlichen Bibliothek zu St. Petersburg,\" in Travaux de la troisième session du Congrès internationale des Orientalistes, St. Pétersbourg 1876, Baron Victor de Rosen, ed. (St. Petersburg: Brill, 1879), 2:491-592. 19.Darmesteter amends to magar-at (Darmesteter, \"Judaisme\", 7). The phrase ma agar, however, is also used at 11:244 and, moreover, occurs in a Manichaean Middle Persian king parable: mʾ ʾgr wnʾh kʾmyd. For the text see Sundermann, Kosmogonische und Parabeltexte, 87.20.The Frahang ī Pahlavīk includes the Aramaic ideogram KPLWN, from the root qpl, meaning \"to roll up\" or\"roll away,\" for ōstardan or ustardan meaning to \"shave\" or \"to erase\" (Nyberg, Frahang i Pahlavīk, 98). On the basis of the sense of the underlying Aramaic, de Menasce, Apologétique, 185 translates \"to wipe.\" However, this could be an instance of a polemical pun: Middle Persian āstārēn (from the same Proto-Iranian root *star) means \"to sin\" (Cheung, Etymological Dictionary, 363-64). Sanskrit āstarṇena, from the related root star-, means \"to spread out\" or \"extend\" (Monier-Williams, Dictionary, 161).- 153 -"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"(40)vatzamīhamāhihirukīmār21rōdāṯ.\"(41)vašōhauuāeguftkut\"āβastanīpadardudušuuārvatzāišnipagarąx́aštāβašni22bāṯ.\"(42)vašōmārguftku\"ǝžmiiąni23cihārpāeąudadąidaštīukōhīnifrīdaabāš.(43)vatpāemabāṯ.(44)vatraβǝšnipaiškamux́arašnixākbāṯ.(45)umiiąni24farzaṇdąiθōaβāzanixīn25udušmangaštīaβąbāṯkuǝ̄šąfarzaṇdąsargazǝṇd.\"(46)īṇcagōeṇdkušīṇgǝ̄θīaβāharciaṇdarharθismardumąrākardudāṯ.(47)vašmardumaβar hamā dąm u dahišni *i26 x́īṯ u x́ašk pādišāh kard.27(48)nuṇgōemnihaṇgǝ̄aβaraṇdargyašądrāišniuzaspąnīyašągaβǝšni(49)kuązamīiāβxūnu28tąnutārīkīuyazaṯvašvaxšuāβisiiāhkuupakadąmvīmaṇdbūṯ?(50)aiiå̄x́aṯyazaṯciāinaabūṯ?(51)pǝ̄dākunǝ̄rōšanbūṯ(52)cikašrōšanīdīṯ(53)ąrākuš29nǝ̄dīṯǝstaṯnigō-naa šīhast.

Interestingly, the Sanskrit translates hihir as mutra, meaning \"urine\" andkīmār as purīśana \"feces.\" (Monier-Williams, Dictionary, 636 and 825). At least in the case of mutra, the translator may have confused the Sanskrit word with Avestan mūθra, which does indeed mean \"feces.\" See Bartholomae, Altiranisches Wörterbuch, 1189.22.Compare ŠGW 11:103: x́aštāβ, \"oppression.\" Ultimately from Proto-Iranian *stap \"to hasten, oppress;\" similar forms can be found in Pahlavi and Manichean Middle Persian ʾwyštʾb- and Parthian ʾwyštʾbyšn (Cheung, Etymological Dictionary, 363). 23.MSS.

See Sundermann, \"Manichäerkapitel\", 329 and Werner Sundermann, \"Mani's 'Book of the Giants' and the Jewish Books of Enoch: a Case of Terminological Difference and What it Implies,\" in Irano-Judaica III, ed.

According to Horovitz, \"Jewish Proper Namesand Derivatives in the Koran\", 160 Arabic ʾIbrāhīm was formed on the basis of comparison with Ismaʿil.83.Pahlavi bālēn, New Persian bālīn, \"cushion\" or \"pillow\" (MacKenzie, CPD, 16). Manichaean Parthian brzyn (Durkin-Meisterernst, DMMPP, 111). See the discussion in Chapter Two.84.De Menasce speculates that underlying the form Āsīnaa is Arabic ʾIsḥāq (de Menasce, Apologétique, 198). The standard Pazand system for transcribing the Pahlavi script would seem to indicate that this could be thecase. The ending -aa usually represents the Zoroastrian Middle Persian participial suffix -āg. The sounds /n/ and /o/ share a single ligature, the straight vertical line. Initial /e/ is sometimes written with the sign for /a/, for instance in the non-logogram spelling of the verb \"to stand\" estādan, est- (ʾSTʾTN'). While the correspondence is not perfect, a Pahlavi spelling of the name as ʾSḤʾK could be misread as Āsīnāg. West (Shikand, 225) suggests that the Syriac form of the name, ʾīsḥaq could be behind the Pahlavi, with the vertial stroke of the guttural misread as /n/. The Arabic form ʾisḥāq corresponds exactly to the Syriac; subsitition of s for ṣ already occurs in Hebrew by-form yisḥāq Horovitz, \"Jewish Proper Names and Derivatives in the Koran\", 155). 85.This superlative form is cognate with Pahlavi dōš-, the verbal stem meaning \"like\" or \"love\" (MacKenzie, CPD, 27) and dōst, \"friend\" (MacKenzie, CPD, 26). In form, it is closest, however, to Parthian zwš, meaning \"love\" (Durkin-Meisterernst, DMMPP, 386). On the etymology see Cheung, Etymological Dictionary, 473. Sanskrit sahōdaraṃ, however, means \"co-uterine, born in the same womb\" or \"closely resembling, similar\" (Monier-Williams, Dictionary, 1195).86.MSS. JJ and JE have x́ānīdan.87.Pahlavi xwār means \"light,\" \"easy,\" \"mean,\" \"abject\" or \"pleasurable\" (MacKenzie, CPD, 95); in Manichaean Parthian xwʾr has the sense of \"good days\" or \"prosperity\" and the abstract xwʾryyh, \"happiness\" (Durkin-Meisterernst, DMMPP, 365). Nyberg proposes a derivation from xwāhr meaning \"delightful\" or \"delicious\" from Avestan xvāθra- (Nyberg, Manual, vol. 2, 220). Sanskrit pavitrataraṃca indicates \"purity\" or \"cleanliness\" (Monier-Williams, Dictionary, 611).88.The word še has been variously interpreted, for instance, as a Pazand misunderstanding of the Middle Pahlavi ideogram ŠORN or ŠEU for jaw, meaning \"barley\" (de Menasce, Apologétique, 198) and as a Pazand misreading of Pahlavi gāh as Arabic shayʾ—a plausible mistake given Pahlavi writing conventions—a supposition which relies on the Sanskrit translation (as corrected by Jamasp-Asana and West, Shikand, 146) of kśaṇena \"a moment.\" (West, Pahlavi Texts Parts Three, 225 n. 6).

(88) For this is commonly known that speech is the off-spring of thought. (89) If they say that his word was light, then that is very astonishing for then light would be the fruit of darkness and darkness the seed from which light is the sign or this that light was concealed in darkness. (90) As I said, it is evident that a command is not given without one who follows it (91) thus light already was and then he gave the appropriatecommand.127(92) This as well, that he prepared and created this creation and the sky and the earth in six days (93) and on the seventh day he rested from it. (94) But if he did not create this world from something but rather only from the command \"Be!\" and it was, (95) then why this peri-od of six days?

(99) And if he was not able to cre-ate [the world] in a single day, then it is not fitting to say he created from nothing.128 (100) And this as well, that when the counting of the days is known by the sun, in that case before the sun was created, how did he know the number of the days and their names?

Halperin and Newby, \"Two Castrated Bulls\" argue that the tradition derives from Enochic cosmological speculation and that its appearance in the ŠGW confirms its antiquity. It seems, however, just as likely that the ŠGW borrowed the tradition from an Islamic source.150.Abraham is referred to as God's friend in both Jewish and Islamic texts. The epithet is found in BT Menahot 53b, though it is missing from the earliest manuscripts (see Raphaelo Rabbinovicz, Variae Lectiones in Mischnam et in Talmud Babylonicum [Munich: 1886], 15:134). The epithet is also found in ARN B 43 (Schechter, ARN, 121). However, this late Midrash was redacted in the post-Amoraic period andperhaps in the first centuries after the Islamic conquest; see Kister, Studies in Avot de-Rabbi Nathan. If this dating is correct, this passage could be evidence of interaction with the similar and more widespread Islamic appelation (for instance, Qurʾān 4:125). Ṭabarī's commentary on this verse includes a number of examples of God's love and care for the patriarch. 151.In addition to resonances with Genesis 18's story of Abraham's hospitality and the annunciation of the birth of Isaac discussed in chapter one, this citation resembles other biblical birth narratives, particularly the birthof Samson described in Judges 13:2-25.- 171 -"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"said:152(43)\"GotoHeavenandbringlightandpurewine.\"153(44)Hewentandhebroughtit.(45)AndAbrāhīmmademanyrequestsofĀdīnō[saying]:(46)\"Drinkwineandeatbreadinmyhouse.\"(47)Ādīnōsaid:\"IwillnotdrinksinceitisnotfromHeavennorisitpure.\"(48)ThenAbrāhīmsworethat\"ThatwineispurefromHeavenandmysonĀsīnaabroughtit.\"(49)ThenbecauseofhisfreedomofdoubtinĀsīnaaandthetestimonyofAbrāhīm,Ādīnōconsumedthewineandbread.(50)Thenwhenhewantedtoleave,hedidnotlethimuntilthey took the great oath.154 152.The use of the word dearest recalls the Jewish and Islamic traditions of Abraham's sacrifice of his beloved son. At Genesis 22:1 God commands Abraham to sacrifice \"your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac.\" Similarly, Abrāhīm's sending Āsīnaa to heaven in order to fulfill his obligation of hospitality to ādīnō is reminiscent of the patriarch's unquestioning willingness to sacrifice his only son. Āsīnaa's journey to heaven recalls the son's brush with death on the altar. According to a Midrash in PRE 31, on account of his fear Isaac's soul does actually leave his body and ascend to heaven, only to return. (Börner-Klein, PRE, 363). Āsīnaa's return with \"light and pure wine\" is similarly reminiscent of the son's return with a replacement, an animal sacrificed in place of the rescued son which was understood to have been stored up in heaven. The ram appears in the biblical account in Genesis 22:13; BT Pesahim 54a and PRE 19 (Börner-Klein, PRE, 197) state that the ram was created on the evening before the first Sabbath after creation. Islamic traditions relate that the replacement animal was pastured in heaven for forty years before the sacrifice, or that it was the same ram sacrificed by Abel, Adam's son. While the precise identity of this replacement, whether a billy goat, a ram or an antelope, is not mentioned in the Qurʾān—Sura 37:107 only mentions that he was ransomed \"with a great sacrifice\"—these exegetical traditions are ascribed to Ibn ʿAbbas in the literature. See Thʿalabī, Prophets, 160; Muhammad ibn Jarīr Ṭabarī, Prophets and Patriarchs, vol. 2 of The History of al-Ṭabarī, ed. William M. Brinner (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1987), 94; Firestone, Holy Lands, 129-32 and S. Bashear, \"Abraham's Sacrifice of His Son and Related Issues,\" Der Islam 67 (1990): 243-77.153.Alongside the role heavenly wine plays in the midrashic expansion of the story Jacob's trickery in Genesis 27 (discussed in chapter one) wine stored in heaven or the garden of Eden is a motif particular to Babylonian rabbinic literature. Among other sources, we can mention a BT Berachot 34b (parallel in Sanhedrin 99a) on the wine stored in the grapes from the six days of creation; Babylonian Talmud 59b (parallel in ARN A 1 Schechter, ARN, 6) on the angels serving Adam and Eve wine and grilled meat in Edenbefore the fall; PRE 23 (Börner-Klein, PRE, 253) states that the vine Noah planted in Genesis 8:20-22 was originally from the Eden. The most interesting occurrence of the motif, from the perspective of the ŠGW, isin the midrashic expansion of the story of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis 19. In explaining where Lot's two daughters procured the wine they used to intoxicate their father (19:31-36), the Midrash states, on the basis of Joel 4:18, that God made the mountain itself produced the wine. The tradition can be found in Mekhilta de Rabbi Yishmael, Shirah 2 (Jacob Z. Lauterbach, Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael: A Critical Edition on the Basis of the Mss and Early Editions with an English Translation, Introduction and Notes (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1933), 2:15; the translation follows Lauterbach) and the parallel version in Sifre Deuteronomy 43 (Louis Finkelstein, Siphre ad DeuteronomiumH. S. Horovitzii schedis usis cum variis lectionibus et adnotationibus [Berlin: Jüd. Kulturbund in Deutschland, 1939], 94). See also Genesis Rabbah 51:8 (Theodor and Albeck, Bereshit Rabba, 538).154.The final statement that Ādīnō was not allowed to leave before sealing a \"great oath\" is reminiscent of a number of biblical passages, including God's promise that Sarah will give birth at Genesis 18:9-10; Abraham's deal with God over the minimum number of righteous men whose presence could ransom Sodom at 18:16-33; and the covenant sealed by Abraham's circumcision, which immediately precedes the story of his hospitality, at 17:1-27. However, the closest parallel is the account of Jacob struggle with an unnamed figure at Genesis 32:25-31. While the identity of Jacob's sparring partner is indeterminate in the Bible, the Midrash makes clear the angelic nature of the visitor. Targum Pseudo-Jonathan on Genesis 32:25 (Maher, Targum, 114) identifies an unnamed angel; BT Hullin 91b identifies the stranger as an angel and explains that he had to leave with the dawn to sing in the morning's heavenly choir; Genesis Rabbah 78:1 (Theodor and Albeck, Bereshit Rabba, 2:916) identifies the angel as Michael or Gabriel and Tanhuma - 172 -"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"(51)ConsiderthisevilchatterwhichisentirelyunbefittingofGod.(52)Hiscominginbodilyform to the house of Abraham, eating bread and drinking wine are in no way befitting of him.(53) This is manifest as well that Abrāhīm's pain was not from Ādīnō but from another agent. (54) His deluded knowledge and stupidity were such that he did not know the purity and ori-gin of the wine. (55) And his mendacity in this, that he said he would not drink the wine and in the end drank it, (56) then confessed that \"it is holy and pure.\" (57) Now how is it fitting to worship he who has this nature as the omniscient and omnipotent deity? (58) And it says in that place: \"There was a sick man who, with his wife and children, was suffering greatly, poor and without resources. (59) He was always diligent and active in prayer and fasting and supplication to God. (60) One day in his prayer he requested in secret:'Give me some happiness in my lot (61) so that my life will be easier.' (62) An angel de-scended and said to him: 'God has not apportioned in the stars a lot better than this. (63) It is not possible to apportion a new lot. (64) But, in recompense for your supplication and prayer,I have created for you a four-legged jewel throne in heaven. (65) If necessary, I will give youone leg of that throne.' (66) That prophet asked the counsel of his wife. (67) His wife said: 'It is better that we be satisfied with a poor lot and bad life in the materialworld (68) than if we, among our companions, have a three-legged throne in heaven. (69) But if you can, obtain ourlot by another means.' (70) That angel came again saying: 'Even if I destroy the firmament and create anew the heaven and earth and fashion and create anew the movement of the stars, it is not evident from that whether your fate would be better or worse.'\"155(71) From these words it is apparent that he himself is not the dispenser of lots and destiny, (72) their allotment is not according to his will and he cannot change fate. (73) The revolu-tion of the sphere, the sun, moon and stars are not in the compass of his knowledge, will and command. (74) This as well, that the throne that he announces: \"I will give it in heaven,\" is not a product of his work and creation.(75) And in that place it says about his incoherent speech: (76) \"'I have struck down the flock of the sinners along with countless innocents.' (77) When the angels protested that this is an act without reason, he said: 'I am Ādīnō, the Lord all-powerful, (78) supreme, without rival, absolute and no one dares to speak against me.'\"156Wayishlah 7 (Buber, Tanhuma, 165) with Michael. The seventh century apocalypse Sefer Zerubabel (on which see John C. Reeves, Trajectories in Near Eastern Apocalyptic: A Postrabbinic Jewish Apocalypse Reader [Atlanta, GA: Society for Biblical Literature, 2005], 40-66) identifies him with another divine figure, the archangel and sometime divine co-regent Metatron. Metatron, and angelology in general, are discussed in more detail in chapter three. Ibn Ḥazm, the eleventh century writer, insists that Jewish scripture states explicitly that Jacob prevails over God himself. See Adang, Muslim Writers, 238-39.155.Compare BT Taanit 24b-25a; Midrash Tehilim 92:8; and BT Berachot 32a and Shabbat 1456a-b. God's inability to alter fate is also mention by Ḥīwī ha-Balkhī.

Other passages in the ŠGW imply that, at least in this text, aṇgōšīdaa might also have the same function as mashal, meaning that the word func-tions as a generic marker. Though in its context in 4:63, aṇgōšīdaa can certainly be read simply as \"likeness\" or \"resemblance,\" these other passages point to Mardānfarrox's use of the word as a generic marker. First of all, aṇgōšīdaa has this same function in a short passage from earlier in Chap-ter Four: (24) aṇgōšīdaa i īṇ aβāxtarą nǝ̄kī i ǝ̄šą hamǝ̄ baxšǝṇd (25) aβą cuṇ gadūgą rāhdārą i aṇdar kāravąn vāzargąną rāh brīnǝṇd, (26) vasą θis i mādagī aparǝṇd (27) nǝ̄ ō x́ǝ̄škārą arząniią bǝ̄ ō gunāhkārą ax́ǝ̄škārą jihiią rōspiią anarząniią baxšǝṇd u kahǝṇd(24) an aṇgōšīdaa of how these planets distribute their goodness: (25) [they are] just like highwaymen who cut off the path of a nobles' caravan (26) and steal the things of value (27) [that] they distribute and give not to dutiful and dignified menbut to sinners, slackers, prostitutes, whores, and peons.1.Martin Schwartz has suggested a derivation for this word from the preverb ham- with gōš-, from the widely attested Proto-Iranian *gauš-, meaning \"to hear\" or \"to listen to\" (see Cheung, Etymological Dictionary, 115-116 and Vera S. Rastorgueva and D. I. Edelman, Etymological Dictionary of the Iranian Languages [Moscow: Izdatel'skaja firma\"Vostočnaja literatura\" RAN, 2003], 247-49). The semantic shift from hearingto resemblance or similarity is also seen in Greek symphōnos, one of the meanings of which is \"to be in agreement with,\" (Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1948], 2:1689) and German zustimmen, \"agree\" from Stimme, \"voice\" (Friedrich Kluge, Etymologisches Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache [Berlin: De Gruyter, 1989], 703-4).2.Pahlavi hangōšīdag, Sanskrit nidarśanameva. The Sanskrit, meaning \"exact comparison\" (Monier-Williams, Dictionary, 548), seems to translate the entire Pazand phrase in 4:63: aṇgōšīdaa aβą cuṇ. As for the Pahlavi, examples of various uses of the word can be drawn from the corpus of Middle Persian literature. The simplest sense, where hangōšīdag is used similarly to English \"like\" to introduce a simile, isillustrated by DD 21:5. A sense of likeness or counterpart is illustrated by the Supplement to the Šāyist nē Šāyist 15:13, as well as in a Manichaean text on the soul (Boyce, Reader, text ae, 89-90). However, hangōšīdag is also a mental power or faculty, as is discussed in a text on \"the power of similitude\" in DD 18:3. Likewise, aṇgōšīdaa dānašnī is listed as one of the three kinds of knowledge in ŠGW 5:13-30, where it is defined (5:15-16) as:ą kǝ ǝž pǝ̄dāī θis i nǝ̄ pǝ̄dā pǝ̄dāinǝṯ 16 u ǝž vīnāβadā θis avīnāβadā θis pa aṇgōšīdaa i dast aβar nahāṯ āβarǝṯ ī aṇdǝmąnī i vīnašni i xardthat which makes manifest the non-manifest by means of a manifest thing, and by means of a visi-ble thing an invisible thing, similar to a hand which transfers and brings in the presence of the vi-sion of wisdom.Self-reflexively, the definition of aṇgōšīdaa contains within in it an example of aṇgōšīdaa.- 175 -"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Here aṇgōšīdaa is used to describe the role of the evil planets. As in the garden para-ble later in Chapter Four, aṇgōšīdaa introduces an extended comparison to explain a compli-cate astrological and theological phenomena. In the metaphysics of the ŠGW, good, being of an entirely different and opposed nature from evil, should not in any way join forces or part-ner with it. However, as astrology teaches, human fate is influenced by the movement of both the good stars, kept safe outside the crystal boundary of the sky from Ahriman's corrup-tion, and the evil planets, themselves Ahriman's creations. The aṇgōšīdaa resolves this con-tradiction through the comparison of the planets to highway robbers. Just like highwaymen do not produce anything of value themselves, but only steal the valuable things that others produce, so too the planets do not do any good of their own but, like other demons, usurp the good of Ohrmazd's creatures. Furthermore, in comparing the planets' distribution of fate to the highwaymens' distribution of their booty, the aṇgōšīdaa clarifies that the planets only dis-tribute good fate to evil people. Their reflected luck is granted, like the robbers' stolen loot, to pimps, whores, junkies and lowlives.Similarly, in 11:205-212, as part of the critique of Islam, the ŠGW discusses the argu-ment of a certain, unnamed group that since God is the absolute sovereign of all creation, all created things in the world are, thereby, his own and identical to him. None of his actions canbe characterized as violent, for violence can only be enacted on an object other than oneself.3 According to this logic, the text argues, the actions of any sovereign can thereby be justified: lying is truth and sin is virtue.4 The relevant section follows at 11:213-216:(213) aβą cuṇ ą i hūfarβard rōšan i ādar farōbagą pa aṇgōšīdaa guft (214) kušą mardǝ̄ dīṯ kǝ xarǝ̄ hamǝ̄ maržǝṯ. (215) kašą ažaš pursīṯ ku \"īṇ nigōīnaa5 kār cim kunaē?\" (216) vaš pa bōžašni guft ku \"xarǝ̄ am x́ǝ̄š.\" (213) This is like that which the venerable Rōšan the son of Ādar-Farōbagą said in[an] aṇgōšīdaa: (214) They saw a man who was copulating with a donkey. (215) When they asked him, What is the reason you are doing this vile deed? (216) He explained, I myself am a donkey!6 3.For a general discussion of the identity and distinction between the creator and his creation in Islamic theology see David B. Burrell, \"Creation,\" in The Cambridge Companion to Classical Islamic Theology, ed.Tim Winter (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008), 141-60. The specific doctrine described here,which understands there to be no difference between God and his creation bears some resemblance to the Neoplatonic theories of Jahm ibn Ṣafwān. See Richard M. Frank, \"The Neoplatonism of Ǧahm ibn Ṣafwân,\" Le Muséon 78 (1965): 395-424. 4.This discussion, just as relevant to terrestrial human politics as to theology, intersects nicely with the theory of the sovereign \"state of exception\" developed by Carl Schmitt. On this see Georgio Agamben, State of Exception, trans. Kevin Atell (Chicago: Chicago University Press, 2005) and, again in the messianic contextof the Letter to the Romans, Agamben, Remains, 104-8.5.Sanskrit garhyataram, \"contemptible,\" \"vile\" (Monier-Williams, Dictionary, 350).6.Donkeys are associated with sexual prowess elsewhere in Iranian culture. Martin Schwartz points to the Sogdian xarūnē, meaning \"lewdness\" or \"fornication\" and xarīcak, meaning \"a lewd woman,\" both of which are connected to the word for \"donkey,\" xar. See Gharib, Dictionary, 431-32. - 176 -"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"This short text attributed to Rōšan7 illustrates the absurdity of the theological position just outlined. Absolute power—such as that of the man over his donkey—is not the same as identity. Merely claiming identity does not make it so; the difference in ontological status between the man and the donkey is evident to any observer. So much the more so regarding the difference in ontological status between God and his creation. The fatalism described is just as beastly and sterile as copulating with a donkey.The interesting theological implications of this short text aside, the passage, like the one before, does seem to illustrate a technical usage of aṇgōšīdaa. Whether we understand the term as parable, allegory or some other rhetorical figure, aṇgōšīdaa is used here not as a description of the relationship between the erroneous theological proposition and the sordid donkey tale or of the planets to highwaymen. Rather, it describes the kind of speech the text uses in both these instances. As such, it relates the reader not to a more general class of comparisons or similitudes which might be made between various entities in the world, simil-itudes made through the power of the mental faculty also called aṇgōšīdaa, but to a particularkind or class of speech which illustrates a theological principle by way of a fictional narrative.87.On Rōšn see Gignoux, \"Controverse,\" esp. 144 and the tables on 147-149.8.Interestingly, the word aṇgōšīdaa is never used in the section of the ŠGW where we would expect it most, namely the extended discussion of Jesus' parables in Chapter Fifteen. I would argue that this absence is to be explained by Mardānfarrox's hyper-literal polemical reading strategy which disregards the citations' symbolic or metaphorical content.- 177 -"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Appendix III:Manuscripts of the ŠGWThe following list includes all known manuscripts of the ŠGW, including those listed in Jamasp-Asana and West's edition, in published catalogs of Indian and European libraries aswell as in the uncataloged or unpublished collections of those libraries.
