Not all participants chose to publish their papers, but some other contributions have been added to the volume. The sympo-sium and the resulting book vividly illustrate that Zoroastrian studies is a small, but vibrating and truly international branch of scholarship. The volume joins authors from England, France, Germany, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States of America. The symposium was part of the activities of a junior research-group (\"Emmy Noether-Nachwuchsgruppe\") sponsored by the Deutsche For-schungsgemeinschaft for the period of April 2000 to December 2003. Apart from the editor of the book, among the authors Ramiyar P. Karan-jia, Jens Kreinath, Robert Langer, Dorothea Lüddeckens, Beate Schmerm-beck, and Jan Snoek have been part-time or permanent members of the group. Astrid van Nahl, who generously took upon herself the technical side of the editorial work, belonged to the group in that capacity. Once again, it has been a great pleasure to work with her, and I keep on admir-ing her sense of professionalism, loyalty, and enthusiasm. As student-members of the team, Anna Tessmann, Thorsten Storck, and Bojan So-lovjov did just everything in order to make the conference a success, and I wish to express my sincerest gratitude to all of them. Beate Schmerm-beck has generously agreed to provide a German translation of the paper by Katayoun Mazdapour that was originally read and written in Persian. As part of the activities of the group, we have repeatedly discussed sev-eral drafts of our papers, and that turned out to be a stimulating and re-warding experience. Both the work of the group and the workings of the conference great-ly benefited from the stimulating milieu and excellent research facilities of the Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg, Germany's oldest univer-sity with a long record of Zoroastrian studies. As representatives of dif-ferent units of the university directly involved with the group and the conference, I would like to thank Gregor Ahn, Angelos Chaniotis, Theresa Reiter, and Michael Welker."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The conference was sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsgemein-schaft and the Stiftung Universität Heidelberg.

ON THE STUDY OF ZOROASTRIAN RITUALS Michael Stausberg Rituals and the debate on the origins ofZoroastrianism; Models and compari-sons—theories and descriptions; Ritual networks and sequences; Priestly and lay-rituals; Congregational rituals and the construction of ritual communities; Imaginations and interactions Students ofZoroastrianism generally agree that rituals are of paramount importance in that religion. Surprisingly though, except for a few com-prehensive studies written by Zoroastrian priests, in particular the book The Religious Ceremonies and Customs of the Parsees by (Ervad Shams-ul-Ulama Dr. h.c. Sir) Jivanji Jamshedji Modi, first published in 1922 (second edition 1937, reprinted several times afterwards), but still regarded as the classic study,1 as well as a few contributions to the study of single rituals,2 this volume may claim to be the first ever collective attempt devoted to that issue.3 A guiding principle in approaching the subject is that rituals need to be studied not in isolation, as if they were time- and spaceless entities, but in context. However, just as there is not just one text to be studied in isolation, the contributions gathered in this volume amply attest that there is not just one context to be addressed either. From a historical and geographical perspective, texts and contexts studied in these pages range from antiquity to modernity, all the way from Japan, China, India, Iran, Europe to California. They touch on questions of gender and profes-sional religion (priesthood/lay-people) and are placed in a broad range of social and local settings: from the royal court to the needy, from the rural 1 An abridged version of this book (with an extensive introduction) has been prepared by J.K.

What is more, the particular context of each ritual performance makes it a dis-tinctive event. Apart from the different contexts studied by scholars, there are differ-ent discursive contexts in scholarship that need to be taken into consideration. One of these is the usual problem of boundaries between the academic disciplines that are mostly involved in the study of Zoroas-trian rituals, such as Iranian philology, ethnology, philosophy, and the history of religions or 'Religionswissenschaft'. Each discipline cultivates a number of specific methods of inquiry, analytical styles, strategies of legitimation, and forms of representational rhetoric. However, occasion-ally, one finds different paradigms, explicit or implicit theoretical as-sumptions, models, and concepts at work even within one and the same discipline. These can lead the investigation in different—and possibly even contradictory—directions.4 Furthermore, the study of Zoroastrian rituals has a history linking it to the specific framework of Zoroastrian studies and its main debates.5 One of these scholarly contexts is the problem of the origins of Zoroastrian-ism. This is because, as one author has put it recently, it seems \"reason-able to assume that with the new religion named after its founder a new form of ritual also began.\"6 In what follows, this debate will be briefly reviewed because it may serve as a good starting-point to a discussion of some relevant methodological and theoretical studies pertaining to the study of Zoroastrian rituals. 4 Some of these issues are discussed in the papers by Jens Kreinath and Jan Snoek. 5 For an attempt of'contextualizing' some major contributions to the study ofZoro-astrianism and a survey of some important positions in the field (mostly from a British perspective) see J.R. Hinnells, \"Postmodernism and the Study of Zoroastrianism\", Zoroastrianism and Parsi Studies. Selected Works of John R. Hinnells (Aldershot et al., 2000), pp. 7-25. This paper was originally published in Postmodern Perspectives. Es-says in Honour of Ninian Smart, eds. C. Lamb/D. Cohn-Sherbock (London, 1999), pp. 156-171.1 enjoyed the privilege of commenting on an earlier draft of this paper. How-ever, as in another instance, the author did not find it necessary to acknowledge that fact. Apart from that, I would still disagree with the post-modern appearance Hinnells creates around the work of his teacher Mary Boyce (even in the mitigated form in which he presents it as a result of my earlier critique), for Boyce certainly has a very strong 'meta-narrative'. 6 A.

For earlier names of the religion, see M. Stausberg, Die Religion Zarathushtras. Geschichte -Gegenwart - Rituale, vol. 1 (Stuttgart et al., 2002), pp. 7-10. For the later fortuna of 'Zoroaster' in European religious history, see M. Stausberg, Faszination Zarathushtra. Zoroaster und die Europäische Religionsgeschichte der Frühen Neuzeit (Religionsge-schichtliche Versuche und Vorarbeiten 42; Berlin/New York, 1998). 9 It should be noted that some leading 19th and early 20th century scholars in the his-tory of religions had Zoroastrianism as their religion of specialization. One may recall the names of the Dutch scholar Comelis Petrus Tiele, the Swede Nathan Söderblom, the Dane Edvard Lehman, and the Italian Raffaele Pettazzoni. Each of them has published at least one book on Zoroastrianism. One of the reasons of the popularity of the subject among early historians of religions may have been the idea that many key-ideas of Ju-daism and Christianity possibly derive from Zoroastrianism. Therefore, the study of Zoroastrianism was placed at the crossroads of apologetics and history and was en-dowed with that sort of 'relevance' that is increasingly required by modern research-sponsoring institutions. After this first generation of scholars, Zoroastrian studies have to a certain extent disintegrated. This may be the result of a process of specialization and division of labor in scholarship: While remarkable progress was achieved in the study of a good number of aspects of Zoroastrian religious history—or neighboring areas—, the study ofZoroastrianism as such was somewhat neglected. Undoubtedly, it is the merit of professor Boyce to have firmly re-established the unity ofZoroastrianism as a subject of scholarly inquiry. The most prominent result of this is her book A His-tory ofZoroastrianism for Brill's Handbuch der Orientalistik (3 vols, have been pub-lished so far). However, in order to emphatically re-establish Zoroastrianism as a uni-tary subject she has probably overemphasized the continuity and coherence of what she calls 'the faith', and her Λ History ofZoroastrianism in a way is one of the most unhis-torical histories ever written. For a sketch of earlier scholarship and a comparison with current approaches, see A.

Obviously, dif-ferent attempts at dating and localising 'the prophet', as Zoroaster is la-belled among Zoroastrians since Islamic times, open up new ways of comparison and contextualization—and ultimately create quite different 10 M. Boyce, Zoroastrianism: Its Antiquity and Constant Vigour (Columbia Lectures on Iranian Studies 7; Costa Mesa, 1992), p. 52. From a strictly historical perspective, this idea may seem somewhat anachronistic, see Stausberg, Die Religion Zarathushtras, vol. 2, pp. 423-428. 11 To get a glimpse of the confusing state of affairs, attention could be drawn to the fact that the date attributed to Zoroaster in different writings of Mary Boyce varies by roughly five (!) centuries. Moreover, recently, the Italian scholar Gherardo Gnoli, who himself—in his well-known book Zoroaster's Time and Homeland. A Study on the Ori-gins of Mazdeism and Related Problems (Istituto Universitario Orientale. Seminario di Studi Asiatici, Series Minor 7; Naples, 1980)—had advocated an early dating (around 1000 BCE) has recently added some fuel to the fire by advocating the so-called 'tradi-tional date'—258 years before Alexander—that puts Zoroaster between the 7th and 6th century BCE, see Gh. Gnoli, Zoroaster in History (Biennial Yarshater Lecture Series 2; New York, 2000). What Gnoli shows, in fact, is that there are ancient, widespread tradi-tions according to which Zoroaster lived in that period. However, Gnoli seems to over-shoot the mark when he argues that the \"traditional date of 258 years before Alexander is not contradicted by any available evidence and cannot be the result of a late fabrica-tion\" (Gnoli, Zoroaster in History, p. 164). To my eyes, it is clearly possible that the 'traditional date' was in itself an 'invented tradition'. Contrary to the first, the latter book by Gnoli does not tackle the problem of Zoroaster's homeland. For a critical re-view of Gnoli's book see J. Kellens, \"Zoroastre dans l'histoire ou dans le mythe? À propos du dernier livre de Gherardo Gnoli\", Journal asiatique 289,2001, pp. 171-184. 12 This is an approach peculiar to scholars writing in French, most prominently James Darmesteter, Marijan Molé (see below), and Jean Kellens who, in his review to the above-mentioned book by Gnoli emphatically states, \"Partant, je considère que Zarathushtra n'appartient pas à l'histoire\" (Kellens, \"Zoroastre dans l'histoire ou dans le mythe?\", p. 172). As a counter-tendency one might refer to the tendency to 'dupli-cate' Zoroaster into many individuals sharing the same name, see H. Humbach in col-laboration with J. Elfenbein and P.O. Skjaerve, The Gâthâs of Zarathushtra and the Other Old Avestan Texts, Part I, Introduction -Text and Translation (Indogermanische Bibliothek; Heidelberg, 1991 ), pp. 48-49. As a matter of fact, contrary to what he may have thought, the distinction between different 'Zoroastres' was already a recurrent theme in pre-Orientalist perceptions of Zoroaster in Europe, see Stausberg, Faszination Zarathushtra I, pp. 328-335."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"versions of what the religion in its pristine form of origin, Zoroaster as a personality, and the early Zoroastrian rituals may have been like. A specific problem in any attempt at reconstructing the origins of Zoroastrianism is given by the fact that we have no pre-Zoroastrian texts—let alone other sources—in Iranian languages. The GäOäs, five hymns that have been transmitted orally (and largely in a ritual setting) for many centuries,13 are often held to have been composed by Zoroaster himself14 (assuming that he was a person belonging to 'history' after all). Probably, these GäQäs are the oldest surviving text in an Iranian lan-guage—(Old) Avestan—, and it is just in these hymns that the name ' Zara0ustra ' occurs for the very first time in history.15 On the other hand, comparative linguistics has long since recognised the close linguistic re-lationship between the Avestan texts and the older parts of the Vedas, and the understanding of the GäQäs and other Avestan texts have largely been informed by Vedic grammar.16 Comparative (Indo-Iranian, or Indo-European) mythology17 has in vari-13 In the context of much ongoing research on 'oral literatures', this fact has gained greater importance in recent scholarship, see e.g. Ph.G. Kreyenbroek, \"The Zoroastrian Tradition from an Oralist's Point of View\", K.R. Cama Oriental Institute. Second Inter-national Congress Proceedings, January 1996 (Bombay), pp. 221-237. 14 For recent attempts to defend ZaraGustra's authorship, see L. Olson, De avestiska gatha 'erna. Inledande studie (Lund Studies in African and Asian Studies 9; Malmö, 1994), pp. 202-209, and Hintze, \"On the Literary Structure of the Older Avesta\". Hult-gârd, \"The Study of the Avesta and its Religion Around the Year 1900 and Today\", reminds us that the question was discussed in a much more complex manner in earlier scholarship. 15 Apart from some brief, but very important formulae or manthras, there is another so-called Old Avestan text, the Sevenfold Yasna {Yasna Haptaijhâiti) which may have been composed by Zoroaster himself (that is, if he existed at all); see Hintze, \"On the Literary Structure of the Older Avesta\", p. 46; despite all the learning invested into re-loving that question, I would still regard that matter as a point of speculation, see Staus-berg, Die Religion Zarathushtras, vol. 1, p. 101-102. 16 Some modern Zoroastrian esotericists in India—on that movement see Stausberg, Die Religion Zarathushtras, vol. 2, pp. 118-127—doubt that 'Indian' grammar can legitimately be applied to Zoroastrian texts. In their view, this method has greatly com-promised the reliability of the translation of Avestan texts made by Western philolo-gists. 17 Due to the suspicion that Georges Dumézil had harbored Nazi-sympathies in the 1930s, that whole discipline has recently come under attack. On the accusations leveled against Dumézil see e.g. C. Grottanelli, Ideologie miti massacri. Indoeuropei di Geor-ges Dumézil (Palermo, 1993) and the contributions by M. Horstmann, G.G. Stroumsa, M.

While the insight that \"the OldAvesta also continues Indo-Iranian poetic traditions\", as Prods Oktor Skj servo aptly puts it in his contribution to the present volume, can serve as a sound premise to a comparative analysis of many features of the Old Avestan texts—his contribution to this volume and the paper by Antonio Panaino are good illustrations of the results this approach can yield18—, such paral-lels have also tempted a good number of scholars to reconstruct a pre-Zoroastrian 'paganism' as sort of an 'ethnic' or 'folk' religion that has in its turn later on been 'reformed' or 'revolutionized' by Zoroaster.19 When assessing this stipulated 'reform' presumably effected by Zo-roaster, in some way or the other the concept of ritual always comes to the forefront as a key to interpretation. According to a traditional view which has almost been common-sense in the early stages of scholar-ship—and which is still popular among a section of Zoroastrians, mainly of the Iranian branch—, in his reform (or revolution20) Zoroaster not only rejected the 'polytheistic' deities (or nature-worship) and the ritual-minded attitude of his 'pagan' environment by replacing them with 'monotheism' and individual moral responsibility of the faithful but he also did away with the 'pagan cult' consisting of extensive animal sacri-fice and the drinking of the extract of the mysterious haoma-plant.21 This schrift für Religionswissenschaft 6 ( 1998) which review the current state of the debate. Bruce Lincoln, in particular, draws attention to the leanings toward rightwing or even fascist ideologies among many senior scholars in the field apart from Dumézil, see his Theorizing Myth. Narrative, Ideology, and Scholarship (Chicago, 1999). While Lincoln has drawn the consequence of consciously abandoning the comparative method or field of study, other scholars feel that the field of Indo-European religion as such is not nec-essarily impregnated with political ideologies. 18 In recent years, this sort of approach has been stimulated by the works of Skjaervo's colleagues at Harvard, Stephanie Jamison and, most of all, C. Watkins, see his How to Kill a Dragon. Aspects of Indo-European Poetry (Oxford/New York, 1995). 19 On such views see Hultgârd, \"The Study of the Avesta\"; Stausberg, Die Religion Zarathushtras, vol. 1, pp. 115-117. 20 According to Pettazzoni, monotheism did not come into being as the result of a his-torical evolution, but rather as the result of a religious revolution. Significantly, he has first articulated this position in his book on Zoroastrianism {La religione di Zarathu-stra) published in 1920. 21 This scheme is even found in a well-known novel: F.M. Crawford, Zoroaster (London/New York, 1894). Chapter XV (pp. 194-207) gives a vivid description of a (repugnant) pre-Zoroastrian Haoma-ritual inside a temple, and describes Zoroaster's intervention to reform the service."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"school of thought, however, readily had to admit that Zoroaster has ulti-mately failed in this regard,22 basically because of the mediocre, weak, and vulgar character of his later followers.23 The picture of Zoroaster emerging from accounts such as the one briefly sketched here, makes him comparable to the Biblical prophets,24 and this comparison has oc-casionally been spelt out in a systematic fashion.25 A somewhat mitigated version of this perception—or rather construc-tion—of the religious personality of ZaraGustra (Zoroaster) emerges in the scholarly production of Mary Boyce. According to her, Zoroaster, whom she continuously refers to as 'the prophet', was a visionary who had ob-tained a revelation. Thereafter, he \"betook himself, inspired by his great vision, to the daunting task of preaching a new doctrine to his fellow-men\".26 Zoroaster was \"both a visionary prophet and a meditative thinker\",27 struggling against many odds \"to preach his new religion\".28 According to Boyce, Zoroaster's 'new doctrine' or 'teaching' consisted in a peculiar form of'monotheism'29 which is characterized by dualism and a complex system consisting of the seven Amasa Spsntas and the seven creations. Thus, she portrays Zoroaster, \"a man of faith\",30 as a preacher/ 22 See, e.g., Pettazzoni, La religione di Zarathustra, pp. 58-59. 23 See, e.g., J.H. Moulton, The Treasure of the Magi. A Study of Modern Zoroastrianism (Oxford, 1917) pp. 82-83 : \"But nothing can be clearer than that they wholly failed to catch the spirit of Zarathushtra in some of the most central elements in his great message. They could not see how seriously the passionate monotheism of Zarathushtra was compromised by allowing practically divine reverence to be paid to the old gods whom the Prophet put away so sternly. Like all priests ... they were conservatives in religion. Cults which had gone on for ages must go on still. So they paid lip-worship to Zarathushtra's principles... His sermons in verse were turned into spells, the mere recitation of which was to accom-plish magic.\" In another book, his Early Zoroastrianism (London, 1913), Moulton even talks about a Zoroastrian (post-Zarathushtrian) 'Counter Reformation' (pp. 116-119). On Moulton see also briefly Hinnells, \"Postmodernism and the Study of Zoroastrianism\", pp. 12-13. 24 However, it is not at all clear if the Biblical prophets actually did reject the cult as is generally perceived by an exegetical tradition inspired by Protestantism. 25 A very late account inspired by this comparison is the one by Walter Hinz, see his Zarathustra (Stuttgart, 1961). 26 M. Boyce, A History of Zoroastrianism, vol. 1, The Early Period (Handbuch der Orientalistik 1/8/1/2/2A; Leiden/Köln, 1975), p. 185. 27 Boyce, A History of Zoroastrianism, vol. 1, p. 214. 28 Boyce, A History of Zoroastrianism, vol. 1, p. 186. 29 See Boyce, A History of Zoroastrianism, vol. 1, p. 195, where she discusses the \"monotheism of Iran, preached by Zoroaster\". 30 Boyce, A History of Zoroastrianism, vol. l,p. 189."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"teacher/visionary/prophet. At the same time, she insists that Zoroaster was an educated priest and that he continued to practice as a priest even after he had obtained his revelation and set on his mission as prophet.31 Contrary to most earlier approaches, for Boyce there is no conflict be-tween the two roles of the priest and the prophet.32 There is even more to it, for, while earlier approaches had assumed that Zoroaster had criti-cized and even abolished many ancient rituals, Boyce argues that it was precisely his priestly training and practice that had put him on the right track. For instance, she speculates that Zoroaster, the priest, \"had reached his complex doctrine ... through pondering... on the daily rituals in which he had been trained since childhood\".33 Far from demarcating a clear rupture with the past, in the picture drawn by Boyce, Zoroaster's 'new religion' rather appears as a modification and sophistication of pre-vious religious practices. According to Boyce, Zoroaster's complete pro-hibition of any propitiation of the destructive powers seems to have been his \"only break with the old tradition of making tangible offerings to the divine beings\".34 Zoroaster's religious innovation has thus, according to Boyce, grown out of his priestly practice, and his 'new teachings' have added a new, moral, dimension to ritual practice: Zoroaster's own contribution appears to have been twofold: in meditating on the significance of the ritual for the diverse material creations he reached, it seems, his doctrine of the one supreme Creator, God of gods, who made them all, and to whom every act of worship should be ultimately directed; and he added a further dimension to the meaning of the ritual itself by seeing in it an ethical purpose also ... So through these rituals, performed primarily to benefit the physical world and to honour its Creator, priest and worshippers could also, according to Zoroaster's new teachings, seek a moral good, which like-wise was a benefit to the physical creation of Ahura Mazda, since this, the prophet held, was itself ethical in concept and aim, the work of a Being who was wholly good.35 31 See, e.g. Boyce, A History of Zoroastrianism, vol. 1, pp. 186, 214. 32 This question had already been discussed in an extensive review of previous research by K.

For instance, some decades ear-lier, in his book on ancient Iranian religions published in 1938, the Swedish scholar Henrik-Samuel Nyberg had portrayed Zoroaster as a shaman, the leader of a group of professional ecstatics that had devel-oped a highly sophisticated technique to reach the state of ecstasy.36 Ny-berg explicitly rejects a comparison of Zoroaster with the Biblical proph-ets; rather, in his opinion, as a religious type Zoroaster should be regarded as related to the Islamic dervishes, and he wonders if the der-vishes, at least in Iran, could not be considered as direct heirs to Zoro-aster and his group.37 In the preface to the reprint of the book published in 1966, Nyberg explains the lacking enthusiasm about his ideas on the part of his former reviewers and colleagues by the ideological circumstances of the time— fascism and the corresponding 'Aryan' ideology shared by some of his colleagues—and personal religious feelings that he may have offended.38 According to him, at the time when the book was published, shamans were in Aryan-minded circles considered as 'brutes', and comparing Zo-roaster to them was perceived as some sort of a sacrilege.39 Nowadays, of course, that has changed, and 'shamanism' has become almost fashion-able. Nevertheless, Nyberg's interpretation has not achieved wider cur-rency. 36 See H.S. Nyberg, Die Religionen des alten Iran (Mitteilungen der Vorderasiatisch-aegyptischen Gesellschaft 43; Leipzig et al., 1938 (repr. Osnabrück, 1966)), p. 265: \"Zarathustra ist ein berufsmäßiger Ekstatiker, er besitzt eine wohl entwickelte, ererbte Technik zur Erreichung des ekstatischen Zustands; er ist der Führer einer Gruppe be-rufsmäßiger Ekstatiker mit geregelten Funktionen im Leben des Stammes\". 37 Nyberg, Die Religionen des alten Iran, p. 265: \"Sollte man aber eine Gruppe be-sonders anführen, zu der er typologisch am besten in Beziehung gesetzt werden kann, so sind es ohne Zweifel die Derwische des Islam. Es kann sogar die Frage gestellt werden, ob nicht eine unmittelbare Linie von Zarathustras maga zu den ekstatischen Übungen der Derwische unter Leitung des Scheichs, wenigstens in Iran, fuhrt.\" 38 See Nyberg, Die Religionen des alten Iran, pp. νιι-ιχ.

In his book Zoroaster and his World (1947), the former places Zoroaster in the context of Achaemenian political history, assigning his lifetime to the period from 569 BCE to 492 BCE.40 According to Herzfeld's somewhat obscure re-construction which in part reads like a philological or historical novel41 (and which is meant as a refutation of Nyberg's theory), Zoroaster was a wealthy man from a reputed Median family who had been temporally banished. Later on, however, the banishment was lifted, and \"Zoroaster's ethical and political ideas, his monotheism and dualism, [were raised] to the position which one can call a religion of the rulers\".42 However, the \"sanction of Zoroastrianism did not mean the eradication of the old cults\".43 While ritual does not play an important role in Herzfeld's re-construction of events and its challenge to the traditional view of Zoro-aster, he nevertheless alludes to a presumed ritual reform that was achieved by the 'poet': The whole verse [= Y. 50,844] is very picturesque: Zoroaster executes the divine service according to his own rite by circumambulation, out-stretching of the arms and prostration, and his songs are his sacrifices, yasna, as he calls them in the first verse.45 As a key analytical concept, ritual gains a new significance in Marijan Molé's interpretation of ancient Iranian religion. This interpretation, put forward in his book on Ancient Iranian religion of 1963 was heavily.in-fluenced by the approach of the then still prominent myth-and-ritual school.46 While Nyberg, Herzfeld and others attempted to describe Zoro-astrianism in historical terms—Nyberg even went so far as to distinguish between different sorts of ancient Iranian religions—, Molé presents a 40 E.

Where Nyberg and others would ob-serve different stages or forms of religions, Molé would rather see (three) different degrees of perfection, different moral standards, and different communities as parts of one and the same religious system. According to him, this system was tripartite,47 i.e. it consisted of three parts: ritual, myth, and ideology surrounding a stipulated annual festival of the re-newal of time that at the same time evokes notions of eschatology, e.g. the resurrection, and the idea of a periodical renewal of nature.48 Accord-ing to Molé, the 'myth' corresponding to the ritual was the legendary biography of Zoroaster. Ultimately, therefore, the figure of Zoroaster did not belong to a historical past, but was the product of a continuous ritual reality.49 The centre of the ritual is constituted by the GäOäs which are recited in order to produce the renewal (\"la Rénovation\"). The recon-struction of the Gäthic ritual (\"l'office gäthique\") makes up a main part the book.50 This analysis is based on the sequence of the 'ideas' ex-pressed in the text. Interestingly, in the preface, Molé states: Nous regrettons de ne pas avoir été en etat d'étudier davantage le rituel zo-roastrien tel qu'il est pratiqué encore aujord'hui dans les communautés par-sies de l'Iran et de l'Inde; il n'est pas exclu que cette étude ait pu profiter à l'interprétation des Gâthâ. C'est là une ligne de recherches à entreprendre.51 The Yasna, generally held to be the key priestly ritual in Zoroastrianism, is also dealt with in several contributions to this volume, most exten-sively by Gemot Windfuhr.

This implicitly reflects a radical paradigm shift in ritual studies.53 Molé's interpretation was partly inspired by the later Middle Persian (Pahlavi) treatises which outline legendary biographies of Zoroaster54 and other texts which contain a good number of speculations around the Yasna-ritual (or 'sacrifice', as it is often termed).55 In contrast to this ap-proach, Jean Kellens, who in many ways continues the traces that were laid out by Molé, rejects the validity of later sources for a proper understanding of the early texts. Just as Molé, but for different reasons, he denies the his-toricity of Zoroaster,56 and he strongly emphasizes the importance of the ritual dimension of the text. In the translation of the so-called Old Avestan texts, the GäQäs and the Sevenfold Yasna ( Yasna Haptayhäiti) which he published together with Eric Pirart, some ritual flavour is consistently added to several words (mostly by adding the adjective 'ritual' in paren-theses). As an example, in the translation by Kellens and Pirart the very first verse of the GäGäs (= Yasna 28,1) reads thus: 53 See also Jens Kreinath's paper in this volume. However, as early as in 1892, in the preface to his translation of the Yasna, James Darmesteter had already pointed to the importance of the ritual action: \"Mais ces traductions nous laissent désarmés contre la principale difficulté, qui consiste en ce que le Yasna et le Vispéred sont des textes litur-giques, c'est-à-dire des textes récités dans l'accomplissement d'un certain cérémonial. Il est clair que tant que ce cérémonial est inconnu, les textes, qui en sont le reflet ou le commentaire, ou si l'on aime mieux, qui en sont l'âme, ne se suffiront pas à eux-même. La chose importante dans le sacrifice, ce ne sont point les paroles, mais les actes qui accompagnent ces paroles, les actes qui sont l'objet même du sacrifice et son accom-plissement et auxquels ces paroles font allusion. ... La condition essentielle pour tra-duire des textes liturgiques, c'est de connaître la liturgie à laquelle ils ont rapport\", J. Darmesteter, Le Zend-Avesta. Traduction nouvelle avec commentaire historique et phi-lologique, vol. 1, La liturgie (Yasna et Vispéred) (Annales du Musée Guimet 21 ; Paris, 1892), pp. IL—m. Interestingly, in a public lecture at Heidelberg University in October 2001, Dastur Kotwal presented an account of the Yasna ritual that was entirely based on the 'meaning' of the different portions of the text recited in the ritual (the Yasna, a por-tion ofthe/ives/α), thus reminding the audience of the importance of the text (as it were the main performative event) from an insider's point of view. 54 See also his posthumously published La legende de Zoroastre selon les textespe-hlevi (Travaux de l'Institut d'Études Iraniennes de l'Université de Paris 3; Paris, 1993 (second edition)). 55 For a fresh look on the Yasna in the Middle Persian texts, see Shaul Shaked's con-tribution to this volume. 56 See Kellens, \"Zoroastre dans l'histoire ou dans le mythe?\"."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"En hommage à (celui qui offre) les secours, les mains tendues, je (vous) demande à tous la (formule) fondamentale du bénéfique état d'esprit, ô Mazdâ, avec l'Harmonie et l'acte (rituel) pâce auquel tu choies l'efficacité de la divine Pensée et l'être de la Vache. The emendation '{ritual) act' (or 'action') in the translation is the result of the perception of the text as a liturgical document,58 and a number of other substantives (e.g. ahu-, 'existence'; 'state of being'; xsaôra-, 'power') are consistently predicated with the adjective 'ritual' in the translation by Kellens and Pirart. On the one hand, a radical ritual re-reading of the texts is certainly able to avoid some anachronistic inter-pretations, and Kellens' paper in this volume makes a strong case in point. On the other hand, the problem arises that the texts are transmitted only in—equally ritual—re-elaborations from later time: the Old Avestan texts are part of what has become the Young Avestan Yasna. Therefore, almost nothing is known about the 'original' Old Avestan ritual (pro-vided there was something like this at all).59 MODELS AND COMPARISONS - THEORIES AND DESCRIPTIONS If, as Kellens admits, no details about the historical Old Avestan ritual are known and the later traditions and practices are discarded as unreli-able, the validity of the ritual approach to understanding the texts is seri-ously limited. Kellens, Molé, and Nyberg go different ways in order to make sense of linguistically obscure documents.

The same, of course, also holds true for those approaches that implicitly or explic-itly make use of the model of the 'Biblical prophet'. While the latter, however, makes Zoroaster the champion of an anti-ritual form of'inner' and 'moral' religiosity, the models preferred by Nyberg and Molé put him in different types of ritual contexts: While Zoroaster, and the relig-ion associated with him, in Nyberg's interpretation turn out to represent a version of the Northern Eurasian or Siberian ecstatic practices that had been powerfully established as a genuine sui generis form of religion ('shamanism'),60 in Molé's model ancient Iranian religion turns out to be a variant of the Near Eastern pattern of the (presumed) myth-and-ritual complex. It is, of course, easy to dismiss the resulting interpretations as 'distortions' of any supposed 'authentic', 'indigenous' Zoroastrian iden-tity. On the other hand, though, one has to acknowledge the fact that these paradigms did, indeed, produce coherent interpretations of the em-pirical material. In a way, the fruitfulness of the approaches confirms both the power of the theoretical models and the elasticity of the material (and, last but not least, the intellectual talent of the authors in applying and modifying the models to the sources). True enough, none of the paradigms is able to explain everything and to entirely overcome the re-sistance of the empirical material, but still they undoubtedly do shed new light and perspectives on the texts (and hence 'make the sources flow'). Contrary to Nyberg and Molé, Kellens does not explicitly take his point of departure from a well-established interpretative model. He at-60 It should be noted that the first edition of Nyberg's book was published before some classical French studies of 'shamanism' that have contributed to the popularity of the concept (such as those by M. Bouteillier [1950], E. Lott-Falk [1953], and, more than any other, M. Eliade [1951]) had seen the light of the day. In his book from 1938 Nyberg refers to the Swedish studies by J. Stadling [1912] and E. Reuterskiöld [1912], and two books that are still regarded as 'classics' - a Finnish book by U. Harva [1933] and a book by G. Nioradze published in German in 1925. In the preface to the reprint from 1966, Nyberg favorably refers to Eliade's well-known book as if it were a confir-mation of his hypothesis. Eliade, in return, refers to Nyberg's hypothesis, see his Le chamanisme et les techniques archaïques de l'extase (Paris, 1951), pp. 356-358. Ho-wever, he notes that Nyberg's approach had failed to convince most Iranologists (note 1 on p. 358 refers to O. Paul, W. Wüst, P. de Menasce, J. Duchesne-Guillemin, St. Wi-kander and G. Widengren) and suggests a larger scenario (p. 358): \"Remarquons pour-tant que les ressemblences entre, d'une part, les éléments extatiques et mythologiques décelables dans la religion de Zarathustra, et, d'autre part, l'idéologie et les techniques du chamanisme, s'intègrent dans un ensemble plus vaste, qui n'implique nullement une structure 'chamanique' de l'expérience religieuse de Zarathustra.\""},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"tempts a fresh look at the Old Avestan sources, and while denying the relevance of the later Zoroastrian tradition—in sharp contrast to Boyce for whom this stipulated homogenous tradition furnishes the key to solve philological riddles—he continues to refer to the Rigveda as the body of text that is most intimately linked to the Old Avestan texts from a lin-guistic (and possibly also religious) point of view. In its turn, the Rig-veda provides one of the classical examples of what is usually termed a 'sacrifice', and ever since the famous Essai sur la nature et la fonction du sacrifice by Henri Hubert and Marcel Mauss (1899) the ' Vedic sacri-fice' has stimulated a broad range of scholarship.61 At least όη an impli-cit level, Kellens seems to draw much of his inspiration from this schol-arly tradition. One indication for this is the fact that Kellens consistently refers to the Old Avestan ritual as a 'sacrifice'. This is more than merely a matter of terminological convenience, for the decision to fit the scanty information that we have about the Old Avestan ritual into the frame of a 'sacrificial process'·—the GäQäs are hymns that \"were meant to accom-pany the stages of a sacrificial ceremony\"62—endows the text with a logic that goes beyond simple philological facts.63 Again, then, it is the theoretical model, or paradigm, that makes the texts transparent. In the case of Kellens, however, the sources flow in a very particular direction: Kellens does not simply reconstruct some sort of a sacrificial process and ideology, but according to his analysis, the Old Avestan texts mirror what one could call a 'reflective ritual'. To quote Kellens: 61 Some of the more recent books on this rich topic include M. Biardeau/Ch.

Instead he explains the spirit of the ritual to the gods. What we find in the Old Avesta is the answer to certain questions, nothing more: Why is the ritual what it is? To whom should it be addressed? How can we first bring it to the gods' attention, then make them understand it, and finally make it effective? What can the gods expect from it, and what can the humans expect from it in return?64 In a mild form, this idea reaches a compromise between a ritual and a theological reading of the sources: The text is linked to the ritual, but at the same time, Kellens reads it as a discursive statement presenting 'the answer' to fundamental questions pertaining to the ritual. The ritual texts reflect upon the ritual, and thus turn it into a reflective ritual process.65 However, with Kellens the argument goes one step further: Speculations about the ritual dimension of the text are transformed into the notion of \"a speculative ritual\".66 According to Kellens, however, 'the answer', or rather this 'speculative ritual' \"on no account contains the Mazdean phi-losophy, but opens up the path along which it will proceed in the distant future.\"67 The different theoretical models discussed so far result in different views (or constructions) of Zoroastrian history. Kellens and Boyce are the extremes: Whereas for Kellens the Old Avestan texts 'open up a path' for a future history, for Boyce there is dense continuity in both di-rections, both back to the 'pagan' past and forward to 'orthodox' Zoroas-trianism. The different models are informed by different comparative per-spectives: It should be clear by now, that it does, indeed, make a differ-ence to take Vedic sacrifice, Siberian shamanism, a presumed Ancient Near Eastern myth-and-ritual model, or the model of Biblical prophecy as the guiding example of textual analysis. The choice of the key-example also stimulates different views of the Yasna, the priestly ritual that has hitherto attracted by far most attention among scholars. Besides the approaches already discussed, there is a long tradition of explicit 64 Kellens, Essays on Zarathushtra and Zoroastrianism, pp. 100-101. 65 Interestingly Heesterman, The Broken World of Sacrifice, p. 6 when analyzing the process that \"broke the hold of sacrificial furor\" in India and Iran, uses the term \"reflec-tive ritualism\". 66 Kellens, Essays on Zarathushtra and Zoroastrianism, p. 112.

One of the earliest and most important attempts at studying Zoroas-trian rituals was undertaken by Martin Haug, who, while acting as a pro-fessor of Sanskrit in Pune (from 1859 to 1866), established close links with both Brahmans and Zoroastrian priests who even performed part of their rituals for him.68 The comparative observation of Brahman and Zo-roastrian rituals led him to adopt a comparative stance. In his influential Essays on the Sacred Language, Writings and Religion of the Parsis he observes: \"Although sacrifices are reduced to a few rites in the Parsi re-ligion now-a-days, we may discover, on comparing them with the sacri-ficial customs of the Brahmans, a great similarity in the rites of the two religions.\"69 Haug identifies a number of similarities between the two ritual traditions, e.g. \"terms referring to priestly functions\"70 and ritual implements. Most of these similarities, e.g. the Haoma and the Barsom, pertain to the Yasna-ceremony that he also refers to as the 'Yajishn' or 'Ijashne'. Haug states: The Yajishn or Ijashne ceremony as performed by the Parsi priests now-a-days ... contains all the elements which constitute the different parts ... of theJyotishtoma cycle of sacrifices, the prototype of all the Soma sacrifices. The Agnishtoma bears a particular resemblance to the performance of Ijashne. Of course, the whole ceremony [i.e., the Yasna] is much shortened, and the rituals changed in accordance with the more enlightened and hu-mane spirit of the Zoroastrian religion.71 The latter statement contains both a reconstruction and an evaluation of the historical development of the rituals in question: Haug regards the Zoroastrian version of the ritual as the result of religious reform that led to it being 'shortened' and gaining a more 'enlightened' and 'humane' appearance. The comparative stance here clearly turns into a valuation in favor of Zoroastrianism that must have pleased Zoroastrians—and in particular Zoroastrian 'reformists' who at the time were striving to give Zoroastrianism an even more 'enlightened' and 'humane' shape by purg-ing it from 'superstitions' that were considered to be illegitimate borrow-68 On Haug see Stausberg, Die Religion Zarathushtras, vol. 2, pp. 100-101. 69 M.

His rhetoric of similarity reaches out to the whole ritual system. Haug detects similarities and correspondences be-tween major priestly rituals. Thus, the Yasna is a shortened version of the Agnistoma, and the \"Barsom [= a bundle of metallic rods held or touched by the main priest in the Yasna]... refers, in all likelihood, to a peculiar rite at the great Soma sacrifices, yet little known, but about which the author had an opportunity of obtaining oral information\";79 furthermore, in \"the Afringân ceremony of the Parsis ... there may be 72 Incidently, the passage quoted above is quoted extensively by J.J.

In a way, then, through their migration to India in the aftermath of the Arabic invasion of Iran83 the Zoroastrians had returned to a religious environment with which they had shared a history reaching back to their presumed origins. However, the history of Zoroastrian rituals is not exclusively linked to India, and Iran's particular geographical position at the crossroads of East and West connects the ritual traditions of Zoroastrianism to differ-ent cultural contexts. Comparing Zoroastrian rituals to Middle Eastern traditions puts them in a different light altogether. Lady Drower who is mostly known as a Mandaean scholar has undertaken the most important attempt in that di-rection. In her book of 1956, Water into Wine, sub-titled as A Study of Ritual Idiom in the Middle East, she does not limit her investigation to rituals within a single religious tradition.84 In her study of what she calls a 'ritual idiom', that is a common heritage of symbols and 'leit-motifs', a particular pattern of ritual expression and performance shared by a num-ber of traditions, she refers to a broader range of Middle Eastern relig-ions such as Judaism, Eastern Christianities, Mandaeaism, Zoroastrian-ism, Yezidism, and Islam.85 The focus of Drower's interest, however, 80 Haug, Essays on the Sacred Language, Writings and Religion of the Parsis, p. 284. 81 Haug, Essays on the Sacred Language, Writings and Religion of the Parsis, p. 285. 82 Haug, Essays on the Sacred Language, Writings and Religion of the Parsis, p. 285. 83 On Zoroastrian migrations to India and the emergence of a Parsi identity in India, see Stausberg, Die Religion Zarathushtras I, pp. 373-400. 84 The biblicist S.H. Hooke, a noted myth-ritualist who in his own work tried to un-cover a myth-and-ritual-pattern in the Ancient (Middle) East contributed a foreword to Water into Wine. 85 In this volume, the papers by Sabine Kalinock, Robert Langer, and Beate Schmermbeck shed new light on links between Zoroastrian and Islamic rituals (see be-low). This topic has been largely neglected in previous research for obvious ideological reasons.

All three [sic] of the first-named are preceded by prelimi-nary rites outside the sanctuary (or bimanda, oryazashnagäh). The second part of the 'mystery' takes place within it, and laymen are forbidden to enter the holy place. All three are celebrated (a) for the benefit of a deceased per-son or persons, the former being often the immediate occasion; (b) at sea-sonal festivals.... The essential sacred food consumed at these 'mysteries' is bread. The sacred drink is, like the bread, symbolical of life.... Common to all these sacramental meals is a commemoration prayer in which deceased persons are named, and this prayer contains petitions for the prosperity of the community, living and dead, and of rulers temporal and spiritual, past and present. ... 'Mysteries' include ablutions, fire, incense, the pact or pax ceremony and other strikingly like details. Then there is recognition of the ritual meal as an expression of unity, or belief that the individual soul is one with its fellows in this world and the next, and one in a mystical sense with the greater Unity from which it is derived. ... Like the Persian and Man-daean sacramental meals, the mass is a bridge between this world and the next: like them it is, above all else, an expression in dramatic and symbolic 87 form of faith in life resurgent. Once again, this may serve as an example of how the comparative per-spective changes the outlook of the phenomena which are 'compared': While the Yasna could appear as a shortened version of the Brahman Agnistoma to Haug, for Drower it could equally well serve as a perfect example of a sacrificial meal88 (exactly as Zoroaster could be a represen-cause much objection for all of them are religious minorities, a comparison with Islam, which is generally seen as the oppressor and persecutor, was implicitly regarded as in-appropriate. 86 When she was taken to India as a refugee in 1941, Lady Drower came to know Dastur Bode who took her to \"a new fire-temple a few days before its consecration ex-plained the purpose of its chambers and cult-objects and allowed me to witness some Parsi rites in their proper setting. Later, he took me to a seminary for Parsi priests where I saw rehearsals of ceremonies such as the Yasna and was allowed to interrupt novices at any stage of the proceedings which called for explanation\", E.S.

That approach is not peculiar to Drower, though: Some prominent (Catholic) scholars have explicitly likened the Yasna to the (Catholic) Mass.89 On the one hand, these comparisons may be helpful in order to widen possible perspectives in the analysis of the Yasna. On the other hand, the contrasting comparisons vividly illustrate the remarkable distortions resulting from forcing a Zoroastrian (emic) ritual into a non-Zoroastrian (etic) pattern—and comparing the comparisons may be im-portant in order to make us aware both of the potentials and the risks of the comparative endeavor. However, it should be remembered that the examples presented above were those of explicit comparisons, while in most cases the problems of interpretation probably rather arise from the implicit, non-acknowledged comparisons necessarily carried in the back of the scholars' head. In his contribution to the present volume, Jens Kreinath brings this issues to an even deeper, meta-theoretical level, when he argues that dif-ferent theoretical options and paradigms have resulted in scholars com-ing to opposite conclusions in their interpretation of the Yasna, even though they have made use of exactly the same empirical material. Haug and Drower are good examples of comparative approaches in a traditional sense: both are primarily interested in similarities and resem-blances,90 whereas some more recent comparative attempts rather tend to stress differences and divergences. J.C. Heesterman is a good example of gârd in his contribution to this volume. Significantly, in a forthcoming essay, Hultgârd explores Mithraic cultic meals and their possible Iranian links, see A. Hultgârd, \"Le repas cultuel dans le mithriacisme - structure, sens et origines\", Das Mahl Gottes/Le repas de Dieu, ed. C. Grappe (Tübingen, forthcoming). Hultgârds contribution to this volume illustrates the way in which a concept ('ritual/cultic community meal') results in the (eventually successful) hunt for historical data. 89 R.C. Zaehner, The Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism (London, 1961 ), pp. 90-91, 99; J. Duchesne-Guillemin, Symbolik des Parsismus (Symbolik der Religionen 8; Stuttgart, 1962), p. 63. On Zaehner see also Hinnells, \"Postmodernism and the Study of Zoroastrianism\", pp. 13-17. Hinnells stresses Zaehner's \"'situatedness' as an intellec-tual, Western Catholic, interested in mysticism and philosophy\" (p. 16), whose \"atten-tion was focused entirely on what he believed to be parallel with his own Catholic faith\" (p. 16). Actually, as Hinnells points out, Zaehner was a convert to Catholicism. 90 One of the most vivid examples of this approach is Modi, The Religious Ceremo-nies and Customs of the Parsees: In order to illuminate and legitimize certain aspects of Zoroastrian rituals, the author draws attention to similar phenomena from Egypt, France, Greece, Rome, from the Bible, Gnosticism, Neo-PIatonism, from among the Bene Israel and of course from Hindu practices."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"that type of scholarship. In his book The Broken World of Sacrifice (al-ready referred to above) from 1993, he comments on the comparison of Vedic ritualism and the 'Iranian fire cult' in the following terms: \"The interesting aspect of the comparison, however, lies not in their similari-ties but in the striking divergence of their development.\"91 In the present volume, both approaches are represented. While the paper by Antonio Panaino represents the classical attempt of explaining an unintelligible aspect of one system by referring to a clearly attested 'similar' aspect in a linguistic/historical related system—here again Vedic and Avestan texts—, Dorothea Lüddeckens, James Boyd/Ron Williams and Gemot Windfuhr drive the comparative agenda one step further in that the validity of their investigation does not depend on the phenomena under investigation being related to each other from a lin-guistic or historical point of view.92 Windfuhr's study, though, points to the presence and persistence of a cognitive system—astrology—under-lying both the Taoist and the Zoroastrian rituals. In that way, the com-parison with Taöist rituals and the discovery of similarities direct the at-tention to astrological dimensions in the Yasna that hitherto had not been noticed. Thus, the comparison creates the parameters of a re-description and re-visioning of the Yasna. In the case of Boyd and Williams, on the other hand, the Yasna is not the focus of analysis as such but rather serves as an example for a more general attempt at theorizing rituals.93 While the Yasna, thus, on the one hand illustrates and promotes some general points that the authors make about rituals and art,94 the analysis 91 Heesterman, The Broken World of Sacrifice, p. 6. This statement mirrors the well-known call for difference advanced by J.Z. Smith in his essay \"In Comparison a Magic Dwells\", reprinted in J.Z. Smith, Imagining Religion. From Babylon to Jonestown (Chi-cago/London, 1982), pp. 19-35, p. 35: \"Comparison requires the postulation of differ-ence as the grounds of it being interesting\". 92 In the case of Dorothea Lüddeckens, comparison is used as a method in order to validate a general hypothesis on the interdependence between experiences of death and death-rituals. The comparison here refers to modern Western, in particular German, dealings with the topic of death and contemporary Parsi-Zoroastrian death-rituals (i.e., funerals and related rituals). 93 During the conference, the Iranologist Philip Kreyenbroek challenged this position. Kreyenbroek argued that this sort of theoretical approach was degrading the informants to mere 'objects'. In his recent book Living Zoroastrianism. Urban Parsis Speak about their Religion (Richmond, 2001), Kreyenbroek has presented an attempt to rehabilitate Zoroastrians themselves as subjects of discourse about their religion.

Usually, the Yasna is regarded as the Zo-roastrian ritual par préférence. In the course of the performance of the Yasna, the Old Avestan texts, including the Gädäs, are recited. While the history of the Yasna may ultimately go back to a 'prehistoric' past,97 its factual history still remains somewhat obscure. It is safe to assume that the Yasna has developed a fixed, 'canonical' form in the period when the Middle Persian (Pahlavi) texts were written down,98 but it is difficult to get much beyond that. No clear indications for the perform-ance of a ritual like the Yasna can be detected in the Greek and Latin sources, which predate the Pahlavi texts.99 In order to fill that gap, those and other related items see Jens Kreinath's paper in this volume. 95 Hitherto, all comparative studies were of an inter-religious kind (i.e. they compare the ritual A from religion Ζ with ritual Β from religion Y), while there is yet no system-atic attempt at comparing two or several performances of one and the same Zoroastrian ritual (say initiations or weddings in India and Iran or in the 'diaspora' respectively). In previous research, some entire interpretations or theories were based on even one single performance of a ritual; see the paper by Jens Kreinath in this volume. The passage from Manekji's 1865 travel-report published in this volume is an example of a Parsi Zoroas-trian describing the ritual practices of his Iranian co-religionists. The report is informed by feelings both of sympathy and alienation. 96 J.Z. Smith, Drudgery Divine. On the Comparison of Early Christianities and the Religions of Late Antiquity (Jordan Lectures in Comparative Religion 14; Chicago/ London, 1990), p. 52. 97 Boyce reflects on this issue in terms of her assumption about a 'pagan back-ground', see her A History of Zoroastrianism, vol. 1, pp. 156-163. 98 On these texts and their reference to the Yasna see the papers by Philip Kreyen-broek and Shaul Shaked in this volume. However, it should not be forgotten that the Yasna was modified and continued to develop in the post-Pahlavi periods as well. 99 For a comprehensive survey, see A. de Jong, Traditions of the Magi. Zoroastrian-ism in Greek & Roman Literature (Religions in the Graeco-Roman World 133; Leiden et al., 1997). See also the paper by Anders Hultgârd in this volume."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"who wish to argue in favour of the antiquity of the ritual often produce archaeological 'evidence' (i.e., materials).100 In particular, the mortars and pestles of polished stone belonging to the Persepolis treasury seem to testify that rituals like the Yasna, in which a mortar and a pestle are used,101 could have been celebrated already in the 5 th century BCE. How-ever, the fact that similar or even identical implements have been used in a ritual context does not in itself constitute a valid proof for the hypothe-sis that it was 'the Yasna' that has been performed with the help of these vessels. In his contribution to this volume, Gemot Windfuhr suggests that ba-sic texts have been modified in order to fit into an astrological frame-work. In her recent work, Almut Hintze illustrates that a philological analysis may provide a key to further investigations of this and related issues. This is because the literary structure of the Avestan texts shows a conscious arrangement.102 Whereas I find Hintze's suggestion \"that not only all of the Avestan texts but also their very arrangement as transmit-ted in the Yasna liturgy is the original one and derives from the author, ZaraGustra, himself',103 somewhat over-enthusiastic—some of the rea-sons for my scepticism are mentioned above—, her contribution to this volume attests that an analysis of the literary structure of the texts may reveal some of the mechanisms and strategies of the textual fabric and design of the rituals. Much of this yet remains to be explored for the (Younger Avestan portions of) the Yasna, but—as Hintze demonstrates— this approach also yields results when extended to related rituals such as the Visprad and the Vendidad. As a matter of fact, Zoroastrian priestly rituals constitute an interre-lated network that is constructed according to varied degrees of com-plexity: the Visprad, Vendidad, and Nerangdin are ever more complex ritual elaborations of the Yasna.104 Furthermore, in order to be enacted in a valid manner, the Yasna requires a pair of initiated priests who main-tain a certain degree of ritual purity. The performance of the purification 100 By way of example, see Kotwal/Boyd, The Yasna, p. 1 : \"The ritual has its roots in Persian antiquity\". While the authors (in note 1 ) are ready to acknowledge that textual references are mainly from the 9th and 1 Oth Centuries CE, they reason that archaeology \"furnishes us with even older evidence.\" 101 In the contemporary version of the Yasna, though, mortar and pestle are of metal. 102 See Hintze, \"On the Literary Structure of the Older Avesta\". 103 Hintze, \"On the Literary Structure of the Older Avesta\", p. 50. 104 There is evidence to the effect that the network of priestly rituals was much richer in earlier times."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"rituals, in turn, requires the presence of another priest and a purifying agent—consecrated bull's urine—, a substance that is produced by means of the most complex Zoroastrian ritual, the Nerangdin. Thus, the material ritual agent—(consecrated) bull's urine—and the special status of the human actors—the priests—link different parts of the 'ritual sys-tem' together. Moreover, for the main priest in order to be 'empowered' to celebrate the Yasna, first another ritual, the Baj-dharna, has to be per-formed. To a certain extent, the Yasna is a structured arrangement, or compi-lation, of several units that, in different contexts and with certain modifi-cations, are also performed as independent rituals.105 Hence, the Yasna is linked to different settings of religious practice. One major instance of this 'ritual doubling' (or 'quotation') is the above mentioned Bäj-dharnä: with some variations pertaining to its textual corpus and the acts per-formed during the ritual, it can serve both as an independent ritual— mostly referred to as the Bäj-dharnä or the Yast-i Drön—and as a se-quence in the Yasna, where it can be referred to as \"the sacred bread service\".106 However, because of the dominant fixation of attention on the Yasna in previous research the Bäj-dharnä has never been regarded as an object worthy of a study in its own right, although it is actually per-formed more often than the Yasna in priestly practice. Thus, (Ervad) Ramiyar Karanjia's contribution to this volume, which is a synthesis of the results hitherto achieved in a larger ongoing investigation of this rit-ual, is an important attempt to the study of the network of priestly rituals. The same may be said about the Stum (or Staomi), another 'small', but frequently performed ritual that is for the first time ever richly portrayed in the joint contribution by Jamsheed Choksy and (Dastur) Firoze Kot-wal. All of the above-mentioned priestly rituals are linked up with each other, and also with other types of rituals such as initiations and mar-riages. In his contribution to this volume, Burkhard Gladigow discusses 105 On the 'dramatic unity' of the Yasna see W.R. Darrow, \"Keeping the Waters Dry. The Semiotics of Fire and Water in the Zoroastrian Yasna\", Journal of the American Academy of Religion 56, 1988, pp. 417-442. On Darrow's approach see also Jens Krei-nath's paper in this volume. For different attempts to structure the Yasna (according to textual divisions, ritual actions, moves of the priests, etc.), see Gemot Windfuhr's con-tribution to this volume, esp. his tables 1, 2, 5, 6. 106 See Kotwal/Boyd, A Persian Offering, pp. 94-97 and Gemot Windfuhr in this volume."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"the 'cross-linking' of rituals and the resulting creation of ritual networks from a systematic point of view. Theoretical and analytical in scope, Gladigow takes his examples from Mediterranean, especially Roman and occasionally also later (Medieval and modern) European religious his-tory.107 While Gladigow's theoretical approach is clearly informed by this range of examples, it is fascinating to see that many of his findings fall on fertile ground when applied to the study of Zoroastrian rituals. This is another instance of the intricate, multi-layered project of'com-parative religion'. With his contribution Gladigow aims at the creation of some sort of an analytic model (Analysemodell) that permits a (technical) 'notation' and 'sequencing' of rituals.108 Furthermore, he suggests to explore how these 'inner sequences' of rituals correspond to the rituals' 'external con-texts'. As a starting-point, Gladigow reflects on the importance of'repe-tition' for understanding rituals.109 To begin with, he distinguishes be-107 On those concepts see also B.

Horstmanshoff/H.W. Singor/F.T. van Straten/J.H.M. Strubbe (Religions in the Graeco-Roman World 142; Leiden et al., 2002), pp. 49-67. 108 As Gladigow takes 'sequencing' as a starting-point to arrive at a 'notation' of ritu-als, the resulting model is necessarily one-dimensional. In this respect, sequencing re-minds on the syntactical rules featured by Frits Staal in his ritual theory. Staal's com-parison of rituals with grammar and music—see F. Staal, Rules Without Meaning. Rit-ual, Mantras, and the Human Sciences (Toronto Studies in Religion 4; New York et.al., 1989)—is relevant to the notation of rituals, though Staal himself surprisingly does not explicitly address this issue. For some further thoughts on the 'scoring' of rituals see J.W. Boyd/R.G. Williams, \"Artful Means. An Aesthetic View of Shinto Purification Rituals\", Journal of Ritual Studies 13, 1999, pp. 37-52, especially pp. 41—43 who link the question of \"any abstract notational system for displaying, in skeletal and ideal form, the underlying structure of an object or event, usually an artwork or ritual\" (p. 41) to formalism as an aesthetic theory. Another relevant approach to this issue is Nelson Goodman's 'theory of notation'; see N. Goodman, Languages of Art. An Approach to a Theory of Symbols (Indianapolis, 1976 (second edition)), pp. 127-175. According to Goodman, it should be recalled, \"the properties required of a notational system are un-ambiguity and syntactic and semantic disjointness and differentiation\" (p. 156). An at-tempt to make Goodman's theory fruitful for the study of ritual has been made by I. Scheffler, see his \"Ritual and Reference\", Synthese 46, 1981, pp. 421-437, here pp. 422-424, repr. in I.

Eine ethologische Untersuchung der Funktion von"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"tween ritual redundancy and repetition: While redundant rituals conveys the same information or 'function' in different manners (and media), ritual repetition refers to the repeated performance of the same part, ele-ment, or sequence of a ritual. This leads to an attempt to differentiate between different forms of ritual activity, [a] There are elements of ritu-als ('rites') that can be repeated in a recognizable manner within one and the same ritual unit, [b] On a larger scale, a limited number of these dis-crete elements ('rites') can be combined to form stereotype or typical ritual sequences (typische Ritualsequenzen) that structure more complex rituals, [c] Finally, there is the repetition of entire rituals. Evidently, Gladigow's distinctions can fruitfully be applied to the study of Zoroastrian rituals. As an example, [a] the recitation of the main 'manthric' (Avestan) formula—the ASsm and the Υαύά—is part of virtu-ally all Zoroastrian rituals, and they may be repeated several times (i.e., in a recognizable manner) within a ritual like the Yasna. [b] Moreover, by being repeated and combined in a specific fashion—e.g. 4 recitations of the Yadä followed by two of the A$gm—the recitation of these 'man-thras' creates ritual sequences such as the verbal framing of specific ritu-als acts, a technique referred to as 'taking/leaving the bäj'.110 In that way, complex ceremonies are structured or 'dismantled' into smaller units (which, of course, are much easier to memorize), [c] The repetition of entire rituals is a well-known strategy in Zoroastrianism, e.g., with re-spect to the 'posthumous rituals' performed on behalf of a deceased Zo-roastrian. Moreover, the repeated performance of the Yasna for six con-secutive days is considered as a ceremony in its own right and referred to as gewrä\\ it is part of more complex ceremonies such as the initiation into priesthood, and the consecration of bull's urine, the Nerangdin. The Dawazdah Homäst, a ceremony consisting of the performance of a multi-tude of Yasna- and Vendidäd-rituals, is another striking example for the constructive power of that strategy to design new rituals. Gladigow explores a number of forms these basic modalities of ritual repetition or 'sequencing' may take. Thus, [a] he mentions 'ritual quota-tions' (rituelle Zitate), i.e., sequences that are transposed from one ritual Wiederholung für religiöses Verhalten (Religionsgeschichtliche Versuche und Vorar-beiten 43; Berlin/New York, 1998). 110 On this ritualistic technique see M. Boyce/F. Kotwal, \"Zoroastrian bäj and drön-Ι-ΙΓ, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 34, 1971, pp. 56-73 and 298-313."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"onto another one111 and that are easily recognized as such by the partici-pants. Moreover, [b] there may occur 'ritual abbreviations' {rituelle Ab-breviaturen), i.e., shortened forms of rituals that are alluded to without being performed in their entirety. Furthermore, [c] as a special way of linking repetition and sequencing, one finds 'ritual stringing' {Reibun-gen in Ritualen), i.e., the repeated performance of a ritual act that may be, for instance, dedicated to different divine or non-human agents. Again it is tempting to hunt for Zoroastrian examples for these mo-dalities of ritual density.112 [a] As a matter of fact, Sarah Stewart's con-tribution to this volume in which she discusses a long Gujarati song, the Song of Fire (Âtas nu Gît), provides a striking example of a 'ritual quo-tation': the song contains a description of the consecration of an impor-tant Zoroastrian temple-fire,113 and the performance of the song 'quotes' from the 'original' ritual; in this way the 'original ritual' is memorized and kept alive. Within the network of priestly rituals, the Bäj-Dharnä (studied by Ramiyar Karanjia) can be regarded as a quotation from the Yasna. The fact that the relevant chapters of the Yasna which are, with due modifications, recited in the Bäj-dharnä (Yasna 3-8), are usually referred to as the 'chapters of the Srös Drön', shows that this is not just a matter of theoretical speculation, but very much part of an insider's (emic) perspective. Recently, Parviz Varjavand has drawn my attention to what he perceived as a specific 'ritual quotation'. According to his observation, in the so-called Mëzd-services where no animal foodstuffs were used, the Iranian priests cut of the fruits, in particular watermelons and pomegranates, \"in a method very similar to cutting an animal throat and not at all like how a regular fruit is cut.\" 114 [b] While it may be difficult to find Zoroastrian examples for 'ritual abbreviations', the opposite modality, i.e. 'ritual extension', is clearly observable. Thus, both the priestly 'liturgical' rituals and the purification rituals make up a chain of increasingly extended versions of 'simpler' rituals. \"1 On such structures, from a different angle, see M. Cartry, \"From One Rite to An-other. The Memory of Ritual and the Ethnologist's Recollection\", Understanding Ritu-als, ed. D. de Coppet (European Association of Social Anthropologists; London/New York, 1992), pp. 26-36. 112 For an exchange of some ideas on what follows I wish to thank Ramiyar Karanjia. 113 For this ritual, see Mario Vitalone's contribution to this volume. 114 Parviz Varjavand, E-mail of Wed, 5 Mar 2003, 12:26:18."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"[c] Whereas 'ritual stringing' as defined by Gladigow may not be a feature of Zoroastrian rituals, it certainly is a prominent technique in the composition of Zoroastrian ritual texts. By way of example one may re-fer to the first chapters of the Yasna. At the beginning of his extensive commentary on the first eight chapters of the Yasna Jean Kellens quali-fies the rhetorical genre of the text as a 'litany' and characterizes its style as \"dry enumeration\".115 As a matter of fact, this 'dry enumeration' to a large extent consists of the affirmation on behalf of the performer(s) re-citing the text that this or that ritual act is done for or dedicated to a chain of gods, i.e. divine beings, who are at the same time venerated in this way; the enumeration turns out to be a 'stringing' of divine address-ees of the ritual performance. [d] Bearing the Zoroastrian materials in mind, one may even suggest a further modality of sequencing, i.e. marking out a certain sequence by specific gestures. Thus, the mention of evil thoughts, words, and deeds occurring in several basic rituals is usually accompanied by producing a sound, either by snipping the fingers during prayer, or by the priest ring-ing the bell in the fire-chamber inside a temple. As Gladigow's paper illustrates, sequencing can be seen as a means of both constructing and analyzing complex rituals. As examples of complex rituals—that is rituals which integrate a larger number of ele-ments (rites)—, Gladigow discusses (and re-describes) sacrifices\"6 and festivals. The cross-linking of rituals can be achieved by means of the topography of the sacred space (Sakraltopographie) such as the temples and, in the dimension of time, through the calendar. Both ways of inter-linking rituals and creating complex networks of rituals are also clearly present in Zoroastrian ritual practice. Moreover, Gladigow claims that the growing complexity of rituals—a process that he finds attested in most religions—is part of a general long-term (evolutionary) process of 'professionalization' (Professionalis-ierung) of religion. That refers to the observation that religion, and ritu-als in particular, have increasingly become the 'business' of profession-als such priests.\"7 The process of professionalization has two dimen-115 J.

As just one (out of many) example from Zoroastrian history, one might refer to the development of the main ritual of purification, the Barasnüm. From be-ing a ritual performed in order to remove a specific, intense pollution, the priests came to regard the performance of the Barasnüm as a compul-sory ritual duty for each and every Zoroastrian. It was held to be an im-portant means to achieve religious merit and a status of ritual purity. At the same time, the professionals granted the option of having the ritual performed vicariously.118 On the other hand, due to the process of 'professionalization', the proper performance of rituals tends to get increasingly difficult and therefore needs to be safeguarded, supervised, superintended, and con-trolled by specialists.\"9 Probably, the 'professionalization' of religion (and rituals) has a long history in Zoroastrianism, and much of what is at issue here can be illustrated by the Nërangestân, an ancient treatise deal-ing with matters of ritual. In his contribution to this volume, Philip Kreyenbroek, who is involved in an ongoing new edition and translation of that difficult text which \"affords an insight into the discipline of 'rit-ual studies' as taught by Zoroastrian religious authorities\" (Kreyenbroek, p. 319), introduces some of its guiding principles. The Nërangestân pre-sents and discusses rules and practices that focus on \"(1) the proper way of performing a valid ritual, and (2) the evaluation of adverse circum-stances or improper actions which might affect the validity of the ritual and the merit resulting from it\" (Kreyenbroek, p. 320). As one central death and carry it into the 'towers of silence'. This group represents as it were the nega-tive counterpart to the priesthood. While the priests are experts of the pure, the nas-esalar are experts of the defiled and are, hence, socially stigmatized.

While some 'mishaps' require the complete abandoning of the actual performance, in other instances it is possible to adapt it. If, for instance, a single verse (of the text recited within the ritual) had been omitted, that could be cor-rected by repeating the verse in question, whereas the omission of sev-eral verses required the repetition of the whole ceremony. This leads to the question of the consequences of a failed performance: While the priest had to take the consequences of any flaws once the ritual perform-ance was considered as completed, prior to that a ritual could be aban-doned at any time without serious consequences for the performing priests. Moreover, the Nerangestän discusses criteria of accountability. Here, the question of intentionality and responsibility emerge: \"there was an apparently general agreement that someone who arranges to be awak-ened by another in order to take part in the great Gähämbär celebrations does not become a sinner if the other person fails to wake him in time\" (Kreyenbroek, p. 321). Apart from the eschatological dimension of the (ritual) actions—the sins and merits that will be accounted for after death—, occasionally the text mentions punishments inflicted on priests who commit sins during the performance of a ritual: \"thus, if a priest omits one word from his recitation of the Gäthäs he shall be punished with three lashes, or work in the field for a day\" (Kreyenbroek). PRIESTLY AND LAY-RITUALS The rituals mentioned so far—and the consecration of a temple-fire stud-ied by Mario Vitalone in his contribution to this volume—were all ex-amples of priestly ritual craft, and the Nerangestän is one of the major examples of Zoroastrian priestly 'ritual studies'. The fact that Zoroas-trian rituals have long since been 'professionalized' to a large extent had already caught the eyes of Herodotus in the 5 th century BCE, when he notes that it was not the \"custom\" of the Persians \"to sacrifice without a Magus\" (I 132).120 It seems that the Magus was required in both his ca-120 On animal 'sacrifice' in Zoroastrianism, see A. de Jong, \"Animal Sacrifice in An-cient Zoroastrianism.

The 'professional' dimension of Zoroastrian rituals has biased our source-material towards priestly perspectives, for most Zoroastrian reli-gious writings from pre-modern times are products of priestly discourses. Therefore, what we learn about Zoroastrianism from pre-modern Zoroas-trian sources is mostly a priestly version of 'the faith' (or is at least me-diated through priestly perspectives).121 This has important conse-quences, for every account of Zoroastrianism based on 'authentic', 'in-digenous' Zoroastrian sources will implicitly lead to the reproduction of priestly perspectives on that religion. Thus, by using such priestly texts as its primary source-material Orientalist discourse has to a large extent echoed and corroborated priestly perspectives.122 However, because phi-lology as a scholarly ('scientific') discipline claimed to act as the true representative of the 'authentic' textual heritage of the 'faith' (and thus defining its parameters) it has at the same time subtly contributed to un-dermining and substituting the truth-claims of the priesthood.123 In recent decades however, partly following general trends in the study of religion and partly possibly as a result of more intensive interac-tion with lay-Zoroastrians on the side of some scholars, a new interest in the religious attitudes and ritual practice of the laity has emerged.124 This tendency has also resulted in a substantial re-evaluation of 'secondary' sources such as the Roman and Greek sources re-studied by Albert (Ab) de Jong.125 In his contribution to this volume, de Jong addresses another important field of study in this regard: the rituals reportedly performed at the court of the Sasanian kings ruling Iran (and Mesopotamia) from the 3rd to the 7th centuries CE. De Jong raises the question whether Sasanian \"court ceremonial and court etiquette can fruitfully be analyzed as a spe-cial branch of Zoroastrian rituals\". As a matter of fact, Sasanian court rituals have never been considered in that light, and de Jong argues that 127-148. See also the paper by Anders Hultgârd in this volume. 121 Texts like the Dàdestân î dënîg at least reflect on concerns of the laity, but the answers given are those representing and reaffirming priestly authority. 122 It comes as no surprise, then, that the question of orthodoxy has come to the fore-front. 123 On this and related problems, see M. Stausberg, \"Textrezeption und Sinnproduk-tion.

As de Jong rightly points out, the Sasanians have inherited many as-pects of these rituals from their predecessors and some elements ulti-mately may even derive from ancient Mesopotamia. An illuminating comparison could be made with contemporary or later Byzantine court rituals, which are generally held to be \"an essential characteristic of Byz-antine civilization.\"126 Despite the specific problems involved in the study of the Byzantine sources, Byzantine court rituals are a much more accessible object of study than their Sasanian counterparts: Contrary to Sasanian Iran we have primary source-material such as the Book of Ceremonies compiled by the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII Por-phyrogenitus (913-959 CE).127 In his study of Sasanian court rituals, de Jong is mostly interested in gaining \"a better understanding of the com-plex and uneasy relations between religion and court in a Zoroastrian empire.\" However, many of the ritual elements mentioned in his sources, it seems, did not explicitly carry a Zoroastrian message.128 While many Sasanian kings have publicly asserted their adherence to Zoroastrianism in other media, apparently the rituals attested in the available sources have not been used for this aim. It almost seems as if these ceremonies were leading a life of their own, as a distinct set of rituals. In contrast to that, Byzantine court rituals are inter-ritually linked to Christian rituals in a more visible fashion: Visits to religious places (shrines) and liturgical services were parts of imperial triumph-ceremonies, and there was \"a complete intertwining of royal ceremony with the Christian liturgical year\";129 moreover, \"the spatial setting of the rituals combines religious 126 M. McCormick, \"Analyzing Imperial Ceremonies\", Jahrbuch der österreichischen Byzantinistik 35, 1985, pp. 1-20, p. 1. 127 On this work see A. Cameron, \"The Construction of Court Ritual. The Byzantine Book of Ceremonies\", Rituals of Royalty. Power and Ceremonial in Traditional Socie-ties, eds D. Cannadine/S. Price (Cambridge, 1987), pp. 106-136. 128 This is why de Jong chooses his words very carefully when he states, \"That is to say, the Sasanian monarchs were Zoroastrians and the ritual life at court must have ex-pressed this religious identity, or at least cannot have clashed with it too overtly.\" While this assumption sounds convincing, there may have been different views about what a 'Zoroastrian religious identity' actually entailed. 129 Cameron, \"The Construction of Court Ritual\", p. 117."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"and secular areas, and that movement between them is an integral part of the rituals\".130 According to the available sources, Zoroastrian places such as fire-temples, were not part of the Sasanian royal rituals in the same way. Moreover, while processions were important forms of royal rituals in Byzantium, this, it seems, was not the case in Sasanian Iran. The fact that source-materials pertaining to Sasanian court rituals have been preserved and even remodelled in later centuries illustrates a vivid interest in things Sasanian on the part of the later Islamic cultural and political elite. Despite it being in Arabic, the main source used by de Jong was probably written by an Iranian who clearly possessed a solid knowledge of ancient Iranian culture. As a matter of fact, especially un-der the 'Abbäsids, we find a good number of Iranians who were holding important offices at the caliphal court and who contributed to the reinte-gration of a good number of traits of the Sasanian empire into Islamic culture.131 The Sasanian legacy was particularly prominent in the fields of bureaucracy and administration, especially during the early 'Abbäsid period. Attempts at generating continuity with pre-Islamic culture did occasionally even apply to court ceremonies. Significantly, it is reported that al-Fadl b. Sahl—a Zoroastrian who after joining the Muslims in 806 CE at the urging of caliph Ma'mun,132 whose vizier he was to become— had introduced Sasanian rituals into the caliphal court at the time when Ma'mun was staying in Merv.133 While it is reported that some Sasanian kings made pilgrimages to famous fire-sanctuaries, the available source-materials do not confirm the assumption that there was an uninterrupted continuity of Zoroastrian pilgrimages from pre-Islamic times down to the present age. However, as Robert Langer points out in his contribution to this volume, Zoroastrian pilgrimages and what he calls 'shrine-cult' has so many parallels with Muslim-Iranian practices and institutions134 that it seems justified to refer 130 Cameron, \"The Construction of Court Ritual\", p. 117. 131 On the emergence, golden age and decline of the Irano-Islamic culture see E.

However, currently the Iranian-Zoroastrian shrines serve as major attractions to the many Parsi tourist-groups regularly touring Iran.136 While the Iranian and Indian Zoroas-trian traditions share much of their priestly traditions—the priestly groups also have a long history of mutual collaboration—, the Iranian 'shrine cult' seems to be a private, family or community affair out of reach of the priestly sphere of control and influence.137 As a matter of fact, in Iran, the recent history of the 'shrine cult' and the priestly rituals went into opposite directions: Whereas the priestly ritual system to a great extent has disappeared—some key-rituals are no longer performed at all138—, the 'shrine cult' seems to have become ever more popular.139 Robert Langer illustrates the predicament many modern-minded, 'enlightened' priests are caught in: While they on the one hand feel that the 'shrine cult' is somewhat at odds with their ideal of what Zoroas-trianism is all about, they simply can not deny its popularity and will-ingly or not take part in the rituals required by the places and occasions. It seems that the Iranian 'shrine cult' has benefited from the political circumstances reigning in the Islamic Republic. As I see it, this may have various reasons, among them the stately patronage of martyrdom-ideology. As a matter of fact, a number of Zoroastrian 'shrines' are commemorative structures and come pretty close to a Zoroastrian cult of martyrs. Moreover, the restriction of'secular' forms of entertainment has led to shifting entertainment from 'secular' to religious places; accord-ingly, some shrines were modified in order to accommodate larger crowds and serve as places where larger gatherings can take place. In 135 Apart from Muslim and Zoroastrian shrines, Jewish, Christian, Yezidi, and Ahl-e Haqq shrines belong to that general Iranian 'shrine cult'. 136 This Parsi tourist-business has gained momentum since the 1990s. There is no comparable tourism of Iranian Zoroastrians traveling to India. However, there is a long history of migration from Iran to India since the late 18' century, see Stausberg, Die Religion Zarathushtras, vol. 2, pp. 153-156. 137 Actually, one of the shrines mentioned by Langer in his paper, the Pfr-e Mäster Xodä-baxs (Yazd), was founded in order to commemorate a teacher who had his share of conflicts with the priestly establishment. 138 For a survey of ritual change in Iran since the 1950s see the paper by Katayoun Mazdapour in this volume. 139 What happened, therefore, is probably less a decline but rather a transformation of religion."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"that way, new social space was created for the Zoroastrian communities. Apart from enhancing the social dimension of the shrines, as Langer points out, the political circumstances of the Islamic Republic obviously had an 'anti-syncretistic' impact as well: Shrines that formerly were used by Muslims and Zoroastrians alike have nowadays become the exclusive property of the Muslims or—in a few cases—of the Zoroastrians respec-tively.140 Shrines are one of the possible settings for a branch of rituals that also transcends the neat borders of religious communities: the sofreh-rituals performed by Iranian women analyzed by Sabine Kalinock in her contribution to this volume. The available sources do not allow any con-clusions about the long-term development of the sofreh as a ritual form, but the rituals are well-attested in recent Iranian religious history.141 Like the shrines, the sofreh- rituals are beyond the control of the clergy, and as priesthood is an exclusively male domain in Zoroastrianism, many sof-re/z-rituals are completely out of control for the priests because they are performed by women.142 In their evaluation of these rituals the male reli-gious establishment of Islam and Zoroastrianism seem to agree: They are certainly not propagated by the Zoroastrian clergy, and they are even re-jected by the Shiite establishment. In contemporary Iran, Sabine Kali-nock argues, the way a sofreh is arranged amounts to making a political and cultural statement. In other words, in the Islamic setting, from being merely a marginal ritual, the sofreh can easily turn into a 'ritual of resis-tance'. While this is not the case in the Zoroastrian contexts where the ritual is held, the needs addressed by the sofreh-rituals, as Sabine Kalinock points out, are strikingly similar among Muslim and Zoroastrian partici-pants respectively. The vows made in connection to the sofreh-rituals do not aim at \"the general communal well-being or accumulating religious merit for the other world\" (Kalinock, p. 545). Instead, the vows and wishes revolve round specific, \"earthly problems\" with the hope of achieving \"concrete results\" (Kalinock, p. 545) by establishing ritual communication with supernatural beings. These beings, and the modes of communication employed by the women, often do not match those venerated by the male religious establishments, and while the women 140 However, a shrine at Taft is nowadays used by both communities. 141 According to Katayoun Mazdapour, the popularity of the sofreh-rituals among Zoroastrianism has increased since (and possibly because of) the war against Iraq. 142 Men may, however, also take part in some forms of sofreh-v\\iua\\s."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"may possess very specific religious competences—they come to be re-garded as specialists in their own right—, these are not professionalized in the same way as those of the male religious experts who cater for gen-eral religious needs such as the life-cycle and calendar transitions and the well-being of the ancestors. What we see here, can be described as a gender-related division of (ritual) labor. With regard to textual sources, similar problems are discussed in Beate Schmermbeck's contribution to this volume.143 The literary genre that Beate Schmermbeck introduces, poetical prayers called Monäjät, is clearly of Islamic origin. However, in the course of time, Zoroastrian poets from Iran as well as India started to compose Monäjät in their own right. Probably from the 18th century onwards, these Zoroastrian Monä-jät—whose very existence is often ignored and occasionally even denied by Western Orientalists and Iranian Zoroastrian intellectuals alike— have, so it seems, gained a wide currency within the Zoroastrian com-munities. While these Zoroastrian poems have never made it into the canon of Iranian poetry, in Zoroastrianism they have been quasi-canonized from a religious point of view in that they were incorporated in a good number of editions of the Xorde Avesta, the book containing most of the (Avestan) prayers for daily use.144 Whereas the bulk of the texts recited during the prayers (and contained in the Xorde Avesta) are composed in a language incomprehensible to virtually all lay-people and even to many priests, the Monäjät were easily accessible to the people, for they are composed in their mother-languages, either New Persian or—later on—Gujarati.145 Not only the language, but also the style, the imagery and the whole discourse of the Monäjät, as Schermbeck illus-trates in her paper, are significantly distinct from the priestly ritual texts 143 Like the contribution of Robert Langer, Beate Schmermbeck's contribution is based on a forthcoming PhD-thesis that is being prepared within the junior research-group „Religionsgeschichte und Ritualistik\" (Institut für Religionswissenschaft; Univer-sität Heidelberg) directed by the editor of this volume. 144 However, as Schmermbeck points out, the same Monäjät were often transmitted orally as well. 145 Beate Schmermbeck does not discuss the Gujarati -Monäjät. It seems to me that the Gujarati-Monäjät to a great extent were literary adaptations and transformations of the earlier Persian texts. This 'Gujaratization' of the Monäjät presumably started by the texts being transcribed in the Gujarati alphabet when they were printed in the Xorde y4ves/a-editions produced for the Indian market. The Gujarati -Monäjät require a sepa-rate study. For some preliminary observations see J.R. Russell, \"Parsi Zoroastrian Gar-bäs and Monâjâts\", Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society {1989), pp. 51-63."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"and theological treatises. While Schmermbeck refers to these prayers as the \"silent, intimate sisters of the official prayers\", Manekji's travel-report published in this volume attests that in earlier times they were also recited in such public religious places as temples and shrines (e.g. during the seasonal festivals and pilgrimages). Contrary to Langer's 'shrine cult' and Kalinock's sofreh-rituals, and despite their Islamic origins, the Monäjät belong to a recent layer of a shared heritage of Iranian and Indian Zoroastrians. Their contemporary history, however, goes into opposite directions in both groups: Whereas there seems to be a certain revival of the (Gujarati) Monäjät-tradition among the Parsis, e.g. for educational purposes,146 they are nowadays almost completely ignored and tend to be forgotten among the Iranian Zoroastrians, while the non-Zoroastrian Persian Monäjät as part of the classical poetic tradition of the country are still present in Iran. Those Iranians who (according to Beate Schmermbeck's observations) still partly continue the Monäjät-tradition are all women, while the male in-tellectuals and priests tend to despise these prayers as a 'foreign borrow-ing' supposedly contaminating the 'pure' and 'genuine' Zoroastrian re-ligion. Also in India, as far as I am aware, these prayers are mainly sung by women, and the recent Monäjät-revival is very much a female affair. It should be remembered, however, that all the Monäjät-poets mentioned by Schmermbeck are men. Thus, gender turns out to be a complex prob-lern.147 In her contribution on a long Gujarati song, the Song of Fire (Ätasnu Gît), Sarah Stewart draws attention to a similar situation.148 As she points out, this \"song is unique in that it was composed by laymen for use primarily within a lay context, and it appears to have acquired a reli-gious status independent of priestly usage\" (Stewart, p. 443). The song is performed at what the Parsis call 'auspicious occasions', i.e. weddings and initiations. As such it makes part of the repertoire of'female' rituals, i.e. rituals performed by ladies, forming a counterpart to the rituals of the 146 It remains to be seen whether this 'revival' will safeguard the survival of this tex-tual tradition. 147 For an attempt of'gendering' the study of Zoroastrianism, see now J.K. Choksy, Evil, Good, and Gender. Facets of the Feminine in Zoroastrian Religious History (To-ronto Studies in Religion 28; New York, 2002). See also Stausberg, Die Religion Zarathushtras, vol. 2, pp. 401-422. 148 The paper is based on an unfortunately yet unpublished PhD-thesis. In the mean-while, I filmed the singing of the song in Bombay in March 2002."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"male priesthood performed at these occasions.149 As a matter of fact, the Song of Fire is performed by singers referred to as göyän,i5° who must be married ladies and must have given birth in order to qualify; in other words, in order to enhance the auspiciousness of events, the performers must have themselves proven to be 'auspicious' by being 'proven' repre-sentatives of the traditional gender-roles as wives and mothers.151 As males the priests are by gender (i.e., 'naturally') unable to achieve this sort of ritual competence, and their priestly 'purity' alone is clearly in-sufficient to achieve the required sort of 'auspiciousness'.152 149 At initiations and weddings one clearly notes a gender-specific division of ritual labor. In general terms, the preparation of food is an important element in 'female' ritu-als (while this foodstuff may then, in turn, be blessed or consecrated by the male priests). This division of labor is clearly visible in most Iranian rituals, where most, or some, of the ladies usually stay inside the kitchen where they prepare food, while the priests and most of the male participants stay in the hall, or the courtyard. As soon as they are ready and while still steaming, the ladies take the food-items from the kitchen and place them one by one on the ritual table in front of the priest who blesses them by performing the ritual. 150 All the lady-singers I am aware of are now at least in their seventies. Thus, it is doubtful if the tradition of performing the Song of Fire at 'auspicious occasions' has any future. 151 At least in earlier times, the same sort of logic was also applied to the priests per-forming the wedding. Thus, in a Revâyat from the second half of the 16th century (Käus Kâmdin) the following question is raised: \"About tying the marriage knot. Who should tie it?\" The answer is: \"For performing the marriage ceremony no person will do other than a worthy Dastur (i.e. priest)... who has himself been married and who has been the master of a family\" (a married man - kad-xode), B.N. Dhabhar, The Persian Rivayats of Hormazyar Framarz and Others. Their Version with Introduction and Notes (Bombay, 1932), p. 196. In a note, Dhabhar remarks: \"In Nowsari and several other places, it is still the custom that only married priests can perform marriage ceremonies. In large towns like Bombay, this custom is dispensed with.\" Dastur Firoze Kotwal, a native of Naosari (Nowsari), recalls this practice as well. However, he comments on this devel-opment in the following terms: The lay-people prefarably want their weddings to be performed by the high-priests (dasturs), and when the high-priests started to marry many years after they had assumed office, by necessity they had to perform the weddings as unmarried persons. Thus, in Dastur Kotwal's view the reason for this development is not urbanisation but the general increase in the age at which people get married. As a matter of fact, until the second half of the 19th century most Parsis were married in their infancy; this practice was still allowed under the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act of 1865, but it was formally abolished in 1929, see Stausberg, Die Religion Zarathushtras, vol. 2, pp. 66-67. 152 As a consequence of this division of labor, women are virtually absent as main ritual performers in the context of funerals. Earlier on, they were explicitly excluded from the"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"While gender is an important category here, it should be kept in mind that the Song of Fire itself was composed by men, and the printed edi-tion published in 1879 which is now taken as the basis for the perform-ance of the song was prepared by a man in order to correct what he per-ceived to be 'faulty' performances. Hence, it seems that the distinction between priestly and lay domains of religious practice is as complex an affair as gender. Stewart emphasizes, \"There are few religious obser-vances that are peculiar to the laity alone; while many functions devolve solely on the priesthood, beliefs and practices which I categorise as 'lay' are almost invariably shared by members of priestly families\" (Stewart, p. 447). As a matter of fact, the text as well as the performance of the Song of Fire show the attempt of a 'layization' of priestly rituals, a proc-ess that I have, following Gladigow's scheme, classified as a 'ritual quo-tation' above: The elaborate priestly ritual of consecration of the highest-grade temple-fire153 is commemorated, emulated, re-enacted and at the same time transformed by an equally elaborate song. Stewart refers to that process by calling it the \"domestication of the sacred temple fire\" and a \"ritual reconstruction\" (Stewart, p. 445). CONGREGATIONAL RITUALS AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF RITUAL COMMUNITIES In his contribution to this volume (on Sasanian court ceremonies), de Jong categorically states, \"Zoroastrianism is a 'non-congregational' re-ligion, which means that the community does not gather regularly—for example, once a week—for shared rituals\" (de Jong, p. 351) He readily qualifies this statement in restricting it to pre-modern Zoroastrianism. De Jong's statement brings the argument back to the question of implicit and explicit comparisons, for he seems to derive his dual typology ('congregational' versus 'non-congregational' religions) from a compari-son of Zoroastrianism with Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. On the other hand, the bundle of religious traditions now going under the name of 'Hinduism', at least in their pre-modern versions, would probably qualify as belonging to the 'non-congregational' species as well. As we shall see, this leads to questions such as modes of the organization of final sequences of the funerals. This, however, is no longer the case.

At least for the Gähämbär, several texts insist that participation is com-pulsory and with regard to the Gähämbär the Nerangestän, a major priestly treatise,156 introduces an interesting distinction: the 'number of men' versus the 'number of ceremonies' [Ner. 2,4], According to one commentator, usually the 'number of ceremonies' is more important (lit. \"better\"), but when it comes to the Gähämbär the 'number of men' is more important [Ner. 2,5], However, it is presented as a generally shared opinion \"that a ritual with six men is better than with one, and one with six men is better than three (with one?)\" [Ner. 2,4], While a greater number of ritual actors (or participants) was apparently appreciated, the text also warns that the sheer number is not sufficient: \"Not that one should celebrate with five men what one should not celebrate with one\" [Ner. 2,4],157 For mid 19th century Iran, Manekji's travel-report makes it clear that the Gähämbär and Mehrgän were congregational rituals.158 It was con-sidered rewarding to visit each other without an invitation, people were sitting around in groups, everybody was joining in the communal prayers and it was considered a great merit to take part of the ritually consecrated offerings; moreover, nobody dared to be absent, and, hence, all put their work aside.

More than anything else, the pilgrimage to Pir-e Sabz, a shrine that Langer classifies as an 'international Zoroastrian pilgrimage centre', has in recent decades de-veloped into a public event that virtually (sic!) involves the Iranian Zo-roastrian community worldwide. While the long-term history of the Ira-nian Zoroastian 'shrine cult' largely remains a matter of speculation, it is safe to say that an overwhelming number of shrines are modem inven-159 To a certain extent, this has changed in contemporary Iran where huge buildings for the holding of communal gatherings have been erected even in small villages. 160 In all these religions, however, important rituals are performed at home. Hence, all these comparisons are a slippery affair. 161 On the mechanism of their formation, see Almut Hintze's contribution to this vol-ume. 162 In his contribution to this volume, Anders Hultgârd traces the available evidence for what he refers to as 'ritual/cultic community meals'. For the early modern period, Anquetil's report, which is based on his stay in Surat, is an interesting source when he refers to the Zoroastrian \"banquets\" and sketches the \"repas\" taking place in a garden, see A.H. Anquetil Duperron, Zend-Avesta. Ouvrage de Zoroastre (Paris, 1771; repr. New York/London, 1984), vol. 3 (=Tome second), pp. 574-576. Somewhat earlier, John Ovington who spent a period of three years in Surat after he had arrived in Bom-bay in 1689, had stated: \"At their solemn festivals ... each Man ... brings with him his Victuals, which is equally distributed, and eat in common by all that are present\", quoted by Firby, European Travellers and their Perceptions of Zoroastrians in the 17lh and 18th Centuries, p. 145."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"tions. Furthermore, Bardsïr, one of the places, Langer comments on in his paper and which he classifies as 'a trans-regional pilgrimage centre', illustrates that even the sofreh-rituals (studied by Sabine Kalinock) have the potential to develop into large communal rituals. As a matter of fact, the sofreh-rituals themselves are 'congregational' rituals, although they are not necessarily (but often are!) performed on a weekly (or monthly) basis, and their 'congregation' is not identical to the local or regional religious community (like a parish)—they rather form their own kind of group. Last but not least, the collapse of many features of the traditional ritual system (analyzed by Katayoun Mazdapour in this volume) should not obscure the fact that some new rituals have been and are being in-vented. As examples one can cite the new sets of public events such as the summer-holiday sporting competitions that integrate a competitive GâOâ-chanting as well as a commemorative ritual on behalf of the Zoro-astrian 'martyrs' who have lost their lives during the war against Iraq, and a new series of communal Friday-prayers taking place in some new-style fire temples in Yazd (Kuce Boyuk) and Kermän.163 Even in India, we come across this ambivalent process of decline and reinvention. Just as in Iran, the system of the purity rituals has seen a steep decline (even though the funerary structures—the so-called 'towers of silence' (daxma)—, in many ways a cornerstone of the entire system, are still preserved in India).164 Already the early reform-movement in the 19th century had (successfully) tried to diminish what was perceived as ritual 'excess', i.e., what, from an economic point of view, was consid-ered as excessive expenses that the people had to incur in order to get their rituals performed.165 The later reform-movement was increasingly unsatisfied with many aspects of the ritual culture. However, reformist attempts at creating 'congregational rituals' with a 'devotional' intent and a sermon have failed. Nevertheless, as my own contribution to this volume illustrates, new ritual events have come up and occasionally they have turned out to be a great success. In my own contribution, I am studying two such ritual events taking place at two fire-temples in Bom-bay (one with roots going back to Surat), which have repeatedly changed 163 Unfortunately, all that has not yet been properly documented. 164 On the long-term development of the funerary structures, see the contribution by Dietrich Huff in this volume. 165 See Stausberg, Die Religion Zarathushtras, vol. 2, pp. 66-67.

These events attract extremely large crowds—at least for Zo-roastrian standards—, and significantly do so on a weekly basis. Thus, from an unexpected angle, it confirms the idea that there is a connection between the week as organizing principle of ritual timing and the per-formance of'congregational' rituals. However, we need to go beyond the question of 'congregational' rituals in order to arrive at a better understanding of what rituals achieve in terms of constructing communities. Possibly, it is not primarily the number of people regularly attending the rituals that is at issue here. This becomes particularly clear when we think of the religious role of fire. While the worship of (or, rather in front of) the fire clearly is an act of individual devotion,166 the fire itself is very much a communal affair. This communal dimension of the fire emerges from different observa-tions. To begin with, the very consecration of the highest-grade temple-fires—the Ätas Bahräm studied by Mario Vitalone in his contribution to this volume—involves an effort of the entire community. From a ritual point of view, this is clear from the fact that the process of consecration involves different categories of fires.167 These represent or exemplify all possible sorts of fires used (and hence possibly abused) by a Zoroastrian community, and which are ritually purified (and hence 'sanctified') within the process of consecration. The final establishment ('enthrone-ment') of the fire inside the respective section of a temple is very much a community event, and it requires substantial funding and logistic ar-rangements. Other established communities also have to consent to it being consecrated. Moreover, the birthday of the fire is usually cele-brated as a community event. In the form of a retrospective—mimetic-performance, the Song of Fire {Ätas nu Gît) studied by Stewart confirms and strengthens the intimate connection of consecrating a high-grade fire and constructing a religious community; even the ritualized memory of that event may serve as reconstructing the respective community. In In-dia, prior to 1765, when the Navsäri Ätas Bahrâm was established, it seems that the formation of a religious community—the Parsi-community— was linked to a particular fire, the so-called Iränsäh. This fire-sanctuary was held to incorporate (or rather 'inflame') the cultural memory of the group. It would act as its symbolic center, and serve, as it were, as the 166 See e.g. J.R. HinneUs, Zoroastrianism and the Parsis (London, 1981), p. 62: \"... nor are there any congregational services. Each visit to a fire temple is more like a per-sonal pilgrimage.\" 167 This also applies to the second class of fires."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"'king' of the community.168 In Iran, the basic logic was similar, but it was applied in a different way: Instead of one central fire-sanctuary, in the Reväyat the idea is expressed explicitly that every Zoroastrian quar-ter or village—or any group consisting of ten Zoroastrians or more— should have at least a second-grade fire-sanctuary, and if possible also an ätas Bahräm.169 The importance that the Iranians attach to the presence of the consecrated fires within every Zoroastrian community probably has to do with a ritual that in its turn constitutes something like a ritual community: the 'gathering of the fires'.170 This ritual, which is not prac-ticed in India, consists in transferring a 'used' fire—i.e., a fire that has been used e.g. for cooking a number of times—to a fire of a higher rank or class. This practice clearly established a network of fires and a com-munity of fire-users. These observations may illustrate the point that even 'non-congregational' rituals serve to establish a ritual community. There are more aspects to this topic as well that would merit a further investiga-tion. Here, it may suffice to mention the community of the living and the departed that is achieved by the performance and through the performa-tive power of the priestly rituals and the festivals.171 Moreover, the ritu-als evoke a collective agency, a Zoroastrian \"we\"—as a community of worshippers fighting evil and striving towards a purification and the fi-nal transfiguration of the world.172 Most Zoroastrian rituals are sponsored privately, and primarily ad-dress the well-being of the immortal parts of the deceased relatives. 168 See Stausberg, Die Religion Zarathushtras, vol. 1, pp. 380, 388-389, 423. 169 See Dhabhar, The Persian Rivayats of Hormazyar Framarz and Others, pp. 61 — 62. 170 See J.C. Tavadia, \"Ein alter Feuerritus bei den Zoroastriern in Iran\", Archiv für Religionswissenschaft 36, 1939/40, pp. 256-276; Stausberg, Die Religion Zara-thushtras, vol. 3. 171 This point is also emphasized in the joint paper by Jamsheed Choksy & Firoze Kotwal when they state that many Zoroastrian rituals \"create in the minds of devotees a pious nexus between the living and the dead across the corporeal and the spiritual realms\" (p. 391). 172 Prototypically, ever since the Old Avestan Sevenfold Yasna (Yasna Haptaijhäiti) this collective agency finds its expression in the verbal formyazamaidë(\"we worship\"; \"we venerate\"). The individual agency (\"I\") dominates in the Gä9äs, but especially in the first Gäßä there are some instances of collective ritual agency, e.g. Y. 28,6 (\"Grant ... to Zarathustra and to us,... by which we may overcome the hostilities of the hostile\"); Y. 34,1 ; Y. 34,5 (\"... Mazda... we have always declared you [to be] superior to all nox-ious demons and evil humans\")."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"However, as all rituals invariably contain a textual section that seeks blessings for the whole community, there always is a communal dimen-sion even to those rituals that are sponsored for family-interests. This community-encompassing dimension, it seems, has already been noted by Herodotus in the second half of the 5 th century BCE, when he states (I 132) that the Persian who performed a sacrifice \"may not ask for the good things for his own private interest alone; instead he prays for the good to befall all the Persians and to the king; for he himself is included among all the Persians.\" While the royal appeal is no longer of relevance to the majority of contemporary Zoroastrians, the 'Zoroastrian nation' is implicitly present, addressed and maintained in Zoroastrian rituals. IMAGINATIONS AND INTERACTIONS From a chronological point of view, Herodotus, the 'Father of His-tory',173 is amongst the earliest and most important (secondary) sources for the study of Zoroastrian rituals,174 and the relevant passages from his Histories—in particular, I 131-132—have been repeatedly commented upon in modem research.175 In his view of 'alien religions', which he refers to as 'customs' or 'laws' (nomoi), Herodotus is not primarily in-terested in their 'theologies'. Instead, he mostly focuses on their ritual practices,176 most of all in terms of sacrifice and—to a lesser extent— 173 For a comprehensive survey of the current state of affairs in research on Herodo-tus see Brill's Companion to Herodotus, eds. E.J. Bakker/I.J.F. De Jong/H. Van Wees (Leiden et al., 2002); see also R. Bichler/R. Rollinger, Herodot (Studienbücher Antike 3; Hildesheim et al., 2000). 174 The only possibly earlier Greek source on Zoroastrian rituals is the well-known fragment of Herodotus' older contemporary Xanthos of Lydia according to which Zoro-aster had instigated the rule against burning dead bodies and defiling fire in any other way. 175 Most recently and extensively by de Jong, Traditions of the Magi, pp. 76-120. 176 See also W.

At the same time, these ac-counts are comparative and contrastive in that Herodotus describes alien religious practice, in particular sacrifice, \"almost always in terms of its departure from the ritual of Greek sacrifice\",177 and one may easily re-construct an account of the standard Greek sacrificial procedure by in-verting Herodotus' reports about alien practices.178 This comparative-contrastive stance is particularly evident in the section about the 'cus-toms' of the Persians. In fact, Herodotus provides an entire list of such differences: the priest chanting a 'theogony' during the sacrifice must strike Herodotus' readers as un-Greek, and the same holds true for the 'national' and royal dimensions of the Persians' sacrificial intentions (both already mentioned above). Further points of difference (as noted by Herodotus) are the absence of statues, temples and altars (instead, the meat is spread out on very tender grass), and the facts that no fire is lit— beforehand, that is, for the roasting of the meat as a Greek would have done—, that the Persians have no libations, no flute music, no garlands, and use no grains of barley. Hence, the very idea of 'sacrifice' at the same time serves as a communicative pattern enabling cross-cultural communication while also maintaining and even highlighting the pecu-liar character of the practices of the different cultures involved. Interest-ingly, the category of 'libation' does not work equally well as a cross-cultural communicative devise, for while the Persians in all probability prac-ticed libations Herodotus did not recognize (i.e., classify) them as such. Herodotus' account is systematic, clear, well written, and also remarkably neutral. Indeed, far from making any derogatory statements about the Persian customs, Herodotus, a Ionian travelling intellectual and philobarbaros whose \"openness to barbarian habits and influences seem far removed from at least the popular and official attitudes in Athens of the time\",179 takes a stance of distance towards his own culture, when he notes that the Persians attributed foolishness to those who—unlike them-selves (but very much like the Greeks)—were erecting statues, temples, and altars (I 131). Furthermore, Herodotus ventures an explanation, when he states that the Persians \"do not consider the divinities to be of human form, as the Greeks do\" (I 131), hence providing a 'theological' 177 Gould, \"Herodotus and Religion\", p. 98. 178 See Burkert, \"Herodot als Historiker fremder Religionen\", pp. 19-20. 179 R.

Hence, it is left to the scholars to guess what this phrase was intended to imply, and Walter Burkert has put forward the hypothesis that the Per-sian mirror Herodotus is holding up for his Greek audience was designed as a deliberate alternative to Homeric ideas. According to Burkert, He-rodotus has the Persians voice a critique that he himself had wanted to address to the Greeks.180 Moreover, according to Burkert, the idea that the Persians call the entire vault of heaven Zeus (I 131) was in fact a re-constructed version of the contemporary Greek theory that the radiant sky was the true god.181 Also with regard to the report about the Per-sians' critique of anthropomorphism, Herodotus seems to take a stance in contemporary Greek controversy as incited by the sophists.182 Herodotus is the first of a long list of Greek writers contributing im-portant information on Zoroastrianism in general and on Zoroastrian rituals in particular.183 However, it is difficult to assess on what sort of information Greek and Latin authors based their reports on Persian ritu-als, and to what extent their informants had access to Zoroastrian rituals (if at all).184 Probably, there may also have occurred a mixture of what they had heard or seen with ideas taken from their own cultural back-180 Burkert, \"Herodot als Historiker fremder Religionen\", p. 21 : „Was, laut Herodot, die Perser den Griechen vorhalten oder vielmehr vormachen, ist also eine gezielte Al-ternative zur 'homerischen' Göttervorstellung, die in der Epoche der beginnenden Na-turphilosophie als die eigentlich natürliche erscheint. Bei den Fremden ist sie, wie es Herodot 'scheint', verwirklicht. Herodot lässt die Perser mit ihrem 'Vorwurf ausspre-chen, was er selbst den Griechen sagen möchte.\" 181 See Burkert, \"Herodot als Historiker fremder Religionen\", p. 21 : „Was so rekon-struierend vorgestellt wird, ist in der Tat eine griechische Theorie, und zwar die damals modernste der griechischen Auffassungen: der ganze strahlende Himmel ist der wahre Gott. So hat man Xenophanes verstanden ..., so formulierte es Euripides ..., so setzt es — wohl später als Herodot — Demokrit voraus\". This would not be the only instance where Herodotus is „aware of ideas and arguments that one might assume were later than his writing\", Thomas, Herodotus in Context, p. 273. 182 On Herodutus and the sophists see now Thomas, Herodotus in Context. 183 When it comes to an evaluation of secondary sources, Syriac, Armenian, Hebrew, and later also Arabic writings could benefit from closer scrutiny. 184 In the case of Herodotus, it is interesting to observe the disagreement in the opin-ions of the experts. Thus, while Gould, \"Herodotus and Religion\", p. 100 finds that all his \"accounts of sacrificial practice ... give every impression of being precisely ob-served\" and \"seem ... to be recorded by an observer accustomed to registering the sig-nificant detail of ritual behaviour\", de Jong, Traditions of the Magi, p. 120 argues that \"his description of the sacrifice ... is too fragmentary to support the idea that he had been present at such an occasion.\""},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"grounds and its 'imaginary repertory'.185 The perception of Zoroastrian rituals, or rather the interaction with the so-called màgoi (magi),x%b ritual experts (professionals) in some way or the other linked to Zoroastrian traditions, has given raise to the creation of specific terms (Greek mageia; Latin magia) denoting a set of'other', 'marginal', 'inferior', or even 'illegitimate' ritual practices.187 On the other hand, though, there is a long tradition that sheds positive light on the magi who occasionally are explicitly defended against the accusation of practicing witchcraft ('magic'). Both attitudes, the negative and the positive perception of the magi and their ritual arts, are present in later European history where one finds a renewed interest in Zoroaster and things Zoroastrian ever since Humanism and the Renaissance.188 For the positive side, one may in par-ticular refer to Neo-Platonist thinkers (such as Marsilio Ficino [1433— 1499] and Francesco Patrizi [1529-1548]) who regarded Zoroaster as an ancient sage possessing great mystical and curative, but at the same time 'natural' and 'hidden' powers. On the negative side, Zoroaster's reputa-tion as one of the foremost magicians in ancient history189 has inspired fearful imaginations. For instance, a German poet of the Baroque period, Daniel Casper von Lohenstein [1635-1683], in Agrippina (1665), one of his Nero-tragedies, has Zoroaster perform a magical sacrifice offered to '85 Later, with the rise of religions such as Christianity, Manichaeism, and Islam the portrayal of Zoroastrian rituals has gained more polemical overtones. From now on, conversions allowed for an influx of intimate knowledge about Zoroastrian ritual prac-tices that may have had a certain impact on the genesis of Islamic ritual patterns; an example often referred to already in the early literature (Darmesteter, Goldziher; re-cently reviewed Yarshater, \"The Persian Presence in the Islamic World\"), is the pre-scription of five daily canonical prayers. As some Syriac sources attest, now as then, conversion necessitates some sort of ritual re-education that also involves elementary body-mechanism (such as the way of speaking, eating, etc.). 186 See the survey of available Greek and Roman sources in de Jong, Traditions of the Magi, pp. 387-403 (and pp. 404-413 on the Magusaeans, a group that is mentioned in Christian sources). 187 For an attempt to reconstruct that process see J.N. Bremmer, \"The Birth of the Term 'Magic'\", Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik 126, 1999, pp. 1-12; see also M.

Contrary to much received wisdom, however, this did not immediately result in more 'objective', 'value-free' perceptions of Zoroastrian rituals. Just the reverse seems to be the case: Unfavorable Islamic and Eastern Christian stereotypes were added to the mixture of available information. As e.g. Barthélmi d'Herbelot's [1625-1695] Bibliothèque orientale, the major Orientalist work of reference throughout the late 17th and the entire 18th Centuries, amply illustrates, apart from 'dualism', the alleged 'fire-cult' (or 'fire-worship') of the Zoroastrians is regarded as an essential feature of their religion.193 Both topics—dualism and fire-cult—were hotly disputed is-sues in the 18th century debate on Zoroastrianism (and still influence public perceptions of Zoroastrianism). This debate was part of a larger discourse on ritual and religion. The right forms of ritual worship had been a question of outmost sig-nificance ever since the Reformation, viz. the ongoing reforms and rein-ventions of Christian rituals that went along with the creation of Protes-tant churches and Catholic counter-reformation. Therefore, it hardly comes as a surprise that the perception of Zoroastrian rituals came to be linked to confessional polemics. Such is, to take a famous example, the case with Humphrey Prideaux [1648-1724], sometime Dean of Norwich and author of a biography of Mohammad and a Jewish history {The Old 190 For references and further details, see my Faszination Zarathushtra, vol. 1, pp. 542-547. 191 For further operas see Faszination Zarathushtra, vol. 2, pp. 869-884. 192 See Firby, European Travellers and their Perceptions of Zoroastrians in the 17,h and 18'h Centuries.

When dis-cussing the reign of Darius the Great, Prideaux makes a long digression about Zoroastrianism.194 Here, among many other things, he mentions that the Zoroastrian priests were carrying a mouth-veil in order to avoid polluting the fire. As a result of this, Prideaux moves on to speculate that the priests neglected the proper pronunciation of the prayers and started to mutter them, just as the 'Papists', i.e. the Catholics, were doing. As a further point of similarity between the 'Magians' and the 'Papist' priests, Prideaux mentions the fact that their priests in their rituals employed an-cient languages that are incomprehensible to the common man. Further-more, according to Prideaux, both the Zoroastrian and the Catholic clergy share 'a superstitious folly' making one adhere to 'the old statues against all good reason'. Incidentally and ironically, this sort of reason-ing and polemical tone recalls many of the current controversies (be-tween so-called 'orthodox' and 'reformists') raging in the Zoroastrian communities, for instance on the Internet. Before venturing on his ecclesiastic career, Prideaux had studied Ori-ental languages at Christ Church College in Oxford, and he was one of the hottest candidates for succeeding the great Orientalist Edward Po-cocke [1604-1691] on his Oxford chair. Another candidate was the li-brarian Thomas Hyde [1636-1703] who was appointed as professor of Arabic and later on also took over Pococks chair of Hebrew that in the meanwhile had been entrusted to Roger Altham. Hyde is the author of the Veterum Persarum et Parthorum et Medorum religionis historia, also known under the title Historia religionis veterum Persarum, eorumque Magorum, one of the first histories of any single religion, published in 1700 (second edition 1760). Contrary to Prideaux, Hyde draws a very favorable picture of what he refers to as the 'old Persian religion'.195 As some later scholars in our field, Hyde was concerned with establishing the 'orthodoxy' of his 'old Persians'. In his case, this entailed an attempt to show that the religion of the 'old Persians' corre-sponds to the idea of an 'orthodox religion' (in the obvious Christian sense of the term) belonging, as it were, to the same historical tradition as Christianity and Judaism. The decisive criterion in this regard is the 194 For more details on Prideaux, his ideas about Zoroastrianism and further refer-ences see Stausberg, Faszination Zarathushtra, vol. 2, pp. 740-756. 195 On Hyde and his Historia see Stausberg, Faszination Zarathushtra, vol. 2, pp. 680-712."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"notion of'monotheism', and in his description of the 'old Persian' relig-ion Hyde was at pains to get rid both of the accusations of 'idololatry' and 'dualism'. In his theological purification of the 'old Persian' religion, Hyde pro-duces a detailed discussion of some elements of Zoroastrian rituals, es-pecially the priesthood, the fire-temple (pyreum), their 'church',196 their reverence for the sun and the elements, especially the waters and, of course, their 'cultus Ignis'. Here, however, Hyde emphatically denies that the 'old Persians' and their modem successors were to be attributed a 'true fire-worship'—\"Pyrolatriam veram\"197—, and he rejects the opinion to the contrary that was propagated by Christian missionaries.198 His basic assumption of a continuity of the Zoroastrian tradition from the 'old Persians' down to the contemporary Parsis—also in this respect he seems to foreshadow the theory of Mary Boyce—allows him to supple-ment ancient written sources with statements made by modem travelers. Occasionally, he even had his friends make investigations on his behalf on the spot: \"When a friend of mine in East India, encouraged by me, seriously consulted their priests, if they, in their cult, directly utter some prayer towards fire, they answered, that they did not utter some prayers directly towards fire, but that they directed all their prayers immediately towards God Almighty Hyde's interest in Zoroastrian rituals or 'cult' was motivated by theo-logical considerations: It is not the 'cult' as such that aroused his inter-est, but rather the taxonomic problem if the Zoroastrian rituals necessar-ily impeded the 'old Persian' religion from being classified as 'ortho-dox'. In that respect Hyde is no exception to the general tendency— probably a Protestant heritage—that tends to regard rituals as 'external' and hence shallow, secondary phenomena merely expressing something else (such as 'creeds' or 'power relations').200 The discovery that rituals 196 T.

It goes without saying that this as-sumption was a guiding-principle for the making of this book. For the joint fields of ritual theory and Zoroastrian study, the insight that ritual is neither \"a decorative addition to religious belief and practice\", nor \"the-ology's handmaiden\",201 is one of the lasting achievements of the semi-nal book on aesthetic theory and Zoroastrian rituals by Ron G. Williams and James W. Boyd.202 Let us briefly return to the 18th century. Whereas Hyde was working in his library and was receiving information from his friends in India, with Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil Duperron [ 1731-1805] a direct link between Western scholars and their 'objects' was finally established. Anquetil's travel to India and his stay among the Parsis of Surat in the late 1750s laid the basis for his (French) translation of most Avestan and some Middle Persian texts. His translation of the Bundahisn is followed by a \"vocabu-laire\" and two little treatises. The first one is the \"Exposition des usages civiles et religieux des Parsis\" of 65 pages. This in many respects still valid account of Zoroastrian rituals is, as Anquetil affirms, based on his own observations (\"je présente ce que j'ai vû\"203). However, his quest for knowledge and participation has lead him into trouble and his (supposed?) visit to a fire-temple has roused a lively controversy in scholarly litera-ture.204 Anquetil's—from a scholarly perspective—very fruitful relation-may have had fewer difficulties in approaching Zoroastrian rituals than their colleagues from the Protestant confessions. However, I do not find much empirical evidence that Catholic scholars have been more committed the study of Zoroastrian rituals than their Protestant counterparts, and sometimes it was definitely the other way round. There are prominent scholars from both confessional groups (such as Darmesteter and Boyce re-spectively). Possibly the fact of being culturally alienated from a positive attitude to-wards rituals may be a good stimulus to 'rediscover' their significance in other cultures and religions. 201 R.G.

Kotwal; Ervad Ramiyar P. Karanjia) and a Zoroastrian lady-scholar from Iran (Katayoun Madzapour) attending the conference and contributing papers in the subsequent proceedings pub-lished in this volume, our present endeavor is a case in point. From a historical point of view, some collaborative efforts are especially memo-rable in this respect, in particular the 'teams' Martin Haug with Ho-shangji Jamaspji, James Darmesteter with Tahmuras Dinshaw Ankle-saria, and Lady Drower with Framroze Ardeshir Bode.207 In our times, Dastur Kaikushroo M. JamaspAsa has been collaborating with Helmut Humbach and John Hinnells, and Dastur Firoze M. Kotwal has been— and indeed still is—working with a number of scholars from different backgrounds (in alphabetical order: Mary Boyce, James Boyd, Jamsheed K. Choksy (himself a Zoroastrian), William Darrow, Almut Hintze, Philip Kreyenbroek, and James Russell).208 205 See Stausberg, '\"mais je passai outre'\". 206 There is a tradition of exposure and commitment to philological learning among Indian priests that goes back to the mid 19th century, see Stausberg, Die Religion Zarathushtras, vol. 2, pp. 99-111. Iranian priests are not part of that tradition. As a matter of fact, many leading Iranian priests seem to be much too embarrassed about their traditions than that they would undertake a serious study of rituals. If they venture on a study of rituals, then it is mainly done in order to 'reform', 'update', or 'improve' existing ritual practice. I came to be exposed to that attitude when, in March 2002, I filmed the ätas bozorg kardan, a Zoroastrian ritual that I was especially interested in because it is not practiced in India. The head of the council of Zoroastrian priests in Yazd, an archaeologist by training who is the son of a practising priest but who per-forms himself only occasionally any ceremony, if at all, found my interest in this ritual somewhat irritating and indirectly tried to discourage both me and the priest who was going to perform it, to have the ceremony done. However, there still is a demand for the ätas bozorg kardan among lay-people, and it is occasionally still executed in Yazd while the priests are now formally prohibited from performing it in Teheran. 207 In his contribution to this volume, Carlo Cereti mentions the collaboration be-tween the Italian scholar Angelo De Gubernatis and Dastur Jamaspi JamaspAsa who during the former's visit to Bombay (in 1885) even took the foreign scholar to a Parsi club where he performed a ritual for him to witness. Moreover, they corresponded for quite some time. 208 The present author also gratefully acknowledges the kind and friendly assistance provided by Dastur Kotwal.

Jivanji Modi 's The Religious Ceremonies and Customs of the Parsis, mentioned at the outset of this introductory essay, demonstrates that the out-sider/insider-communication is always a two-way process, and a com-plex one at that. In a way, as Modi acknowledges in his preface, the book was a by-product of James Hasting's invitation to contribute 'the closest possible description' of Zoroastrian rituals to his Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics (1908-1926; 13 vols.).209 Modi's The Religious Ceremonies and Customs of the Parsis is at the same time directed to students of religion and anthropology, and to members of his own com-munity, and up to the present day, the book is used in both contexts.210 When writing this book, Modi was aware of the ongoing breakdown of the system of purity rules and rituals, and as a matter of fact, due to his travels abroad, he himself had provoked a cause célébré in priestly cir-cles because travels by sea were hitherto considered as irreversibly nulli-fying ritualistic qualifications. In the preface, Modi states: \"The reader will find that many a ceremony, ritual or custom has been spoken of as having become obsolete ... Many more will be obsolete in the course of a few years.\"211 In view of this rapid change—in her contribution to this volume Katayoun Mazdapour provides a systematic account of the many changes that have occurred in Iranian Zoroastrian rituals in the second half of the 20th century—, Modi's book is an ongoing reflection on the roots and validity of the ceremonies, most of all of the purity-rituals. While Modi's solution—his pointing to the sanitary or hygienic merits of the rituals—is nowadays obsolete both from methodological and theo-retical points of view, the book nevertheless vividly exemplifies the point that the study of Zoroastrian rituals is clearly involved in contem-porary Zoroastrian practice by e.g. providing new interpretations and justifications, raising questions, nourishing doubts, and putting things into historical perspective.

FORSCHUNGSGESCHICHTE: STRUKTUREN UND SEQUENZEN Ein Versuch, typische Elemente und Funktionen von Ritualen—und zugleich invariante Sequenzen—zu bestimmen, beginnt in der Religi-onswissenschaft mit Marcel Mauss, der für das Opferritual drei Phasen, die des Eintritts, der Handlung und des Austritts postulierte. An ihn schließt van Gennep an, dessen 3er Schema von Segretation, liminaler Phase und Aggregation für viele Jahrzehnte die Forschungslandschaft1 bestimmt hat. Dieser Forschungstradition ist gemeinsam, daß das .Ritu-al' über jeweils eine Grund-Struktur und eine Funktion definiert wird: Diese singularisierende Prämisse, nämlich, daß es grundsätzlich eine dominante und strukturgebende Bedeutung des Rituals gebe, bleibt weitgehend unausgesprochen und undiskutiert. Wenn komplexe Rituale höchst unterschiedliche Modi der Präsentation besitzen (wie wohl im Regelfall), unterschiedliche Bedürfnisse befriedigen, dazu noch ver-schiedene Produkte oder Leistungen (eine Fleischmahlzeit, Gesundheit, oder Kriegsglück), werden sie in je getrennte Kategorien eingeordnet. Eine wichtige Erweiterung des van Gennepschen Schemas erfolgte durch Edmund Leach, der nun die Perspektive des zeitlichen Ablaufs ins Spiel bringt und in der Sequenz der Passagerituale das innovatorische Potential sieht: Die Intervalle zwischen Ritualen, die gesellschaftlich inszenierten Abstände zwischen den ,Festen', seien das Wesentliche, sie generierten ,Zeit'. Der Fortschritt in Leachs Interpretation liegt darin, daß er nicht nur die (Binnen-)Struktur von bestimmten (aber: nicht al-len!) Ritualen thematisiert, sondern auch jene Sequenz von Festen an-spricht, durch die eine Makrostruktur entsteht, für die der Kalender dann so etwas wie die Partitur vorgibt.

ELEMENTE UND BINNENSTRUKTUR VON RITUALEN Zunächst einige terminologische und systematische Vorgaben und Vor-überlegungen. Die Bedeutung der Wiederholung für eine Theorie des Rituals ist vielfach behandelt werden:8 Aus ethologischer Sicht, aus der Sicht einer Handlungstheorie, kultur- und wissenssoziologischer Per-spektive bis hin zu einer Rezeptionsästhetik der Wiederholung. Ich setze diese Diskurse voraus und beschränke mich auf eine pragmatische Un-terscheidung von Wiederholung und Redundanz, sowie auf eine Diffe-renzierung von Wiederholungen auf der Elementebene, der Ebene typi-scher Elementsequenzen, und der Wiederholung von komplexen Ritua-len.9 Redundante Riten werden von wiederholten dadurch unterschieden, daß redundante Riten die .gleiche' Funktion (oder Information) auf un-terschiedliche Weise ausdrücken können: Eine Dedikation kann durch den Ritus des Deponierens oder Schmückens, oder eine vorangetragene Weihetafel ausgedrückt werden. Ebenso kann diese Dedikation aber durch die mehrfache Wiederholung derselben Weihungsformel ausge-sprochen werden. Rituelle Elemente (,Riten') seien dadurch definiert, daß sie entweder innerhalb desselben Rituals wiederholt werden können, oder daß sie .er-kennbar' auch in anderen Ritualen vorkommen. Erst in der Wiederho-lung werden sie als diskrete Elemente .erkennbar' und, wenn sie auch in anderen Ritualen auftreten, .wiedererkennbar'. Als diskrete rituelle Ele-mente sind sie aber auch voneinander abgrenzbar, haben .Grenzen', und sind in unterschiedlichen Reihenfolgen kombinierbar. Typische Ritual-sequenzen seien dadurch definiert, daß sie eine .überschaubare' Zahl diskreter ritueller Elemente miteinander verbinden und daß diese Kons-tellationen in unterschiedlichen komplexen Ritualen vorkommen kön-8 Überblick bei D.

Mit dieser Wiedererkennbarkeit korrespondiert auf der kognitiven Seite das Phänomen der Mustererkennung als komplexe Form von Gestaltwahr-nehmung. Typische Ritualsequenzen, wie etwa die Sequenz ,Gruß, dreimaliges Umkreisen, Wasserspende', gliedern komplexe Rituale, ma-chen sie überschaubar, plausibel, vielleicht sogar verstehbar. Die Frage einer , Wiedererkennbarkeit' von Ritualen ist wohl nicht von ihrer ,Über-schaubarkeit' zu trennen: Überschaubarkeit aber wird auch in Ritualen (nicht nur in Literatur und Musik) durch gliedernde Elemente (etwa ritu-elle Anaphern), explizite Gruppenbildung (typische Riten-Sequenzen), und eine Logik oder Dramatik der Abfolge von Elementen und Element-gruppen hergestellt. Auf die hier nur in plakativen Stichworten angedeu-teten Perspektiven einer internen Sequenzierung und der externen Ver-netzung' von Ritualen sei das Folgende ausgerichtet. Und zwar nicht nur im Blick auf latente Strukturen, sondern vor allem auf explizite ,Lese-anweisungen' : Was sollte ein Kultteilnehmer tun, sehen, erfahren, viel-leicht sogar: glauben,\" - und wie kann man diese Ziele aus einer syste-matischen Analyse historischer oder rezenter Rituale erschließen? 3. RITUELLE SEQUENZEN UND ,RITUELLE ZITATE' Die religionswissenschaftliche Forschung hat—wenn sie sich nicht auf ,den' Sinn eines Ritualtyps kapriziert hat12 —höchstens mitbeachtet, daß es für ein durch Tradition fixiertes Ritual eine Reihenfolge der Elemente gibt, und daß diese Reihenfolge von den Akteuren als formgebunden und invariant13 betrachtet wird. Die korrespondierenden Charakteristika 10 Die hier vorgestellte Differenzierung von typischen Riten-Sequenzen und vollstän-digen Ritualen ist nicht identisch mit Bergesens Unterscheidung von Mikro- und Mak-roriten. Bergesen definiert: „Makroriten beziehen sich also auf die Gemeinschaft als Ganzes und drücken damit die spezifisch kollektive Identität... aus.\" Mikroriten sind demgegenüber „im sprechenden Subjekt situiert\" und drücken das Verhältnis von indi-viduellem Bewußtsein und ritueller Ordnung aus.

Folgt man dieser traditionel-len Analysetradition nicht, und stellt man etwa die Frage nach typischen Ritualsequenzen innerhalb unterschiedlicher Rituale (- die von der Be-trachtung gemeinsamer Strukturen von Passage-Riten insgesamt zu un-terscheiden ist), zeigen sich auf einmal nicht nur Strukturen innerhalb eines einzelnen Rituals, sondern auch Strukturen einer .Querverbindung' zwischen Ritualen, zeigt sich (ich nenne es einmal, in Übertragung des literaturwissenschaftlichen Begriffs der Intertextualität) eine Jnterritua-lität'. Elemente oder Gruppen von Riten innerhalb von Ritualen nehmen auf die entsprechenden Sequenzen in anderen Ritualen Bezug: Zwischen Ritualen und Elementgruppen in Ritualen bestehen Korrespondenzen und Reziprozitäten. Als Beispiele für solche typischen Ritualsequenzen seien die stereo-type Abfolge von Umgang, Opfer, Agon/Spiel und Festmahl genannt, die sowohl bei Stadtgründungen, wie Lustrationen und Erntedankfes-ten14 praktiziert wird, oder die Abfolge von Anrufung, Lied oder Tanz und Opfer, die sich als typische Sequenz im Fest der Arvalbrüder und in Frühlingsfesten findet. Wenn solche Ritualsequenzen einerseits hoch-spezifisch sind und andererseits auch in anderen Ritualen erscheinen, könnte man sie als ,rituelle Zitate' bezeichnen. Unter Zitaten von Ritual-sequenzen verstehe ich dabei vom Teilnehmer oder Zuschauer erkennba-re Sequenzen, die in voneinander unterscheidbaren Ritualen vorkom-men, nicht latente oder implizite Mikrostrukturen. Im Unterschied zur ,bloß historischen' Verbindung zwischen einer früheren und späteren Verwendung (dies die übliche Perspektive) ist das ,rituelle Zitat' durch eine Intention charakterisiert, die mit der Erwartung verknüpft ist, daß das Zitat auch als Zitat erkennbar ist und erkannt wird. Hinter dieser ver-änderten Analyserichtung steht so etwas wie eine ,Produktionsästhetik' von Ritualen, - ich werde später kurz darauf eingehen. Parallel dazu läßt sich ein Phänomen einordnen, daß ich als ,Ritual in Ritualen' bezeichnen möchte: Für die antiken Religionen etwa ist das Ritual des Tieropfers ein an sich selbständiges Ritual, das zugleich in Verbindung mit praktisch allen ,Großformen', von Ritualen erscheint: gion und Kultus der Römer (München, [1912] 1971) pp. 394 sqs. 14 Beispiel bei Baudy, Römische Umgangsriten."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Quis ludus sine sacrificio ?15 notiert der Christ Pseudo-Cyprian tadelnd.

Ein Indiz für diese Integration des Opferrituals in fast alle komplexen Rituale der Antike ist das Vorgehen der christlichen Kai-ser gegen die paganen Religionen: Mit dem Verbot des Tieropfers im vierten Jahrhundert und den korrespondierenden strafrechtlichen Sankti-onen waren die wichtigen traditionellen Formen des Kultus nicht mehr vollständig'16 - das heißt eben auch: nicht mehr rite praktizierbar. Für die ,ungestörte' Antike gilt: Der konkrete Vollzug eines Opfer-Ritus—oder mehrerer wiederholter oder unterschiedlicher Opfer—steht jeweils im Kontext eines komplexes Rituals, d.h. eines Rituals, das sei-nerseits andere Ritensequenzen inkorporieren kann,17 oder durch Einzel-elemente mit ihnen verknüpft ist. Typische Ritualsequenzen, die Wie-derholung der gleichen rituelle Elemente innerhalb unterschiedlicher Rituale, können dabei ,rituelle Zitate' erzeugen, die ihrerseits so etwas wie eine ,Inter-Ritualität' begründen: Kathartische Sequenzen innerhalb vieler Rituale (Besprengen, Umgehen, Bestreuen) liefern ,Querverbin-dungen' der Rituale, die über Kathartik und die eng verbundene Divina-tion das gesamte rituelle Netzwerk stabilisieren.

Kurzformen ritueller Sequenzen, die zitiert und angedeutet, aber nicht in ganzer Län-ge ausgeführt werden. Als Beispiele könnten dienen: der apotropäische Gestus (etwa ein Ausspucken) als Abbreviatur eines eliminatorischen Ritus, wie er sich als angedeuteter Exorzismus im orthodoxen Taufritual findet, oder das christliche ,Stoßgebet' als Kurzform eines ausgeführten Bittgebets. Eine Sonderform für eine Verschränkung von Wiederholung und Se-quenzierung sind Reihungen in Ritualen (denen Namenkataloge in Hymnen entsprechen): Beim Opferfest von Lade20 wird viermal hinter-einander ein Becher Bier getrunken; ein Rundtrunk auf Odin, einer auf Thor, ein dritter auf Njörd und Frey, ein vierter für Bragi und die toten Verwandten. Die Reihenfolge, in der Götter in einem Ritual auftreten, spiegelt ihren ,Wert', ihren Ort in den jeweiligen Hierarchien. Besonders gut bei Prozession mit Götterbildern, von der pompa circensis im repub-likanischen Rom bis zu rezenten Prozessionen in Indien zu beobachten. Um so auffallender eine Abweichung, gar eine gezielte Veränderung der traditionellen (und allen bekannten) Reihenfolge: Neptunus soll nach einer von den Römern verlorenen Seeschlacht seinen angestammten Platz in der Reihe der Götter verloren, und ,nach hinten' gesetzt worden sein.21 Hier gehen Empirie und Ritual eine besondere Verbindung ein.

Das ist in der modernen Forschung zwar grundsätz-lich erkannt worden, die Beschreibung des Phänomens erfolgt aber im Schema der genetisch-historischen Erklärung: Die Form der Pompa cir-censis ließe sich aus dem Triumphzug ,herleiten'.22 Der,einfache Römer auf der Straße' hat aber nicht über die ,Herkunft' nachgedacht, sondern wohl sehr schnell ,gemerkt', daß sich beide Rituale aufeinander bezie-hen sollen. Für die Komposition dieser Interritualität gibt es sogar einen ,Index', der selbst dem unbedarften Römer verdeutlicht hätte, wie die Rituale aufeinander bezogen werden sollen: Der spielgebende Magistrat tritt in der im republikanischen Rom auffallenden Tracht des Triumpha-tors auf - obwohl er gar keinen Sieg errungen hat. 5. SEQUENZEN UND RITUELLE KONTEXTE Daß über Elemente oder typische Sequenzen Querverbindungen' oder Vernetzungen zwischen Ritualen hergestellt werden, kann auch auf einer ,materiellen Ebene' Entsprechungen haben.23 Im antiken römischen Kultus liefert die mola salsa, jener von den Vestalinnen in einem besonderen Ri-tual hergestellte Speltbrei, eine materielle Verbindung zwischen unter-schiedlichen Ritualen. Mola salsa wird sowohl über den zu opfernden Ku-chen24 wie das Opfermesser und das Opfertier gestreut. Im Kontext des blutigen Tieropfers hat das Bestreuen der Opfertiere immerhin eine so her-ausragende Bedeutung gehabt, daß immolare zum Terminus für das ganze Opfer wurde. Unmittelbar mit dem Ausstreuen der mola salsa vergleichbar ist das Ausstreuen von Gerstenkörnern im griechischen Ritual (die ou-lochytai). Gerstenkörner auszustreuen erscheint bei den Griechen ebenso als selbständiger Spendegestus, wie als typisches Element des Tieropfers. Noch weiter verbreitet ist die Wasserspende, das Ausgießen oder Aussprengen von (geweihtem) Wasser. Ähnlich wie für die mola salsa gibt es für die Gewinnung des im Kultus verwendeten Wassers aus einer bestimmten Quelle besondere Vorschriften;25 neben der mola salsa und dem rituell gesicherten Wasser findet die Asche von bestimmten Brand-22 Zum Verhältnis von Triumph und Ludi vgl.

Ne-ben allgemeinen, externen Störungen der Opfersequenz, etwa in der Form einer obnuntiatio, oder der Mitteilung über einen Todesfall in der Familie,27 gibt es drei Punkte, an denen das Handlungssystem,Opfer' in einer definierten Weise ,verlassen' werden konnte: Die Flucht des Opfertieres (hostia effugia), die einen Neubeginn erforderte, die Zu-rückweisung des Opfers in der Eingeweideschau, die eine Wiederholung der Opfers (bis zu 20 Mal28 sind bezeugt) erzwang; schließlich, als ange-strebtes Ende des Rituals, im profanare des Opferfleisches durch Ver-zehr am Ort oder Verkauf.

Die moderne, theologisch beeinflußte Ausrichtung auf ein Element des antiken Opfer-Rituals und die es tragende religiöse Haltung31 ist, vor allem in ihrer Tendenz, Riten soteriologisch zu ver-dichten, das Ergebnis einer anachronistischen Orientierung an christli-chen Mustern. 26 Plaut.Poen. 489 27 Serv.Aen. 6,8. 11,2; dazu Latte, Römische Religionsgeschichte, p. 102. 28 Plut.Aem.Paul. 17,6; dazu Latte, Römische Religionsgeschichte, p. 389. 29 Zitat aus W.

SYSTEMATISCHE QUERVERBINDUNGEN UND EXTERNE KONTEXTE Ein weiteres Charakteristikum von Ritualsequenzen ist es, daß in ihrem Verlauf der Adressat, der Empfänger, das Gegenüber, der Gott perfor-mativ definiert und erreicht werden sollen. In diesem Sinne läßt sich jedes erfolgreich durchgeführte religiöse Ritual als ein Modus beschreiben, Gottesvorstellungen und Erwartungen an die Götter performativ zu präsentieren. Um das ,leisten' zu können, müssen Rituale zugleich komplex und mehrdimensional sein, d.h. bei-spielsweise, daß erst über spätere Elemente einer Ritual-Sequenz Deter-minationen geleistet werden, wie im Falle unserer Sequenz die Position 14 die Gültigkeit der 13 vorangehenden bestimmt. Anders ausgedrückt: Komplexe Rituale haben ,rekursive Schleifen'; mit der fehlerfreien (un-gestörten) Durchfuhrung des Rituals ergibt sich konkludent die Beteili-gung des Gottes. Das Divinationswesen der meisten Religionen stellt eine explizite oder implizite „Rückkopplung\" des Ritualsystems mit den intendierten Interaktionspartnern32 dar. Das Nicken des Kultbildes bei der evocatio, das Niesen eines Opferhelfers, die Namen der camilli, das Stolpern eines Opfertieres, das Aufleuchten der Flamme auf dem Altar, schließlich der Eingeweidesitus des Opfertieres können Zustimmung oder Ablehnung, Akzeptanz oder Warnung signalisieren. Erfolgreich durchgeführte Ritu-alsequenzen konstituieren über ihre regelrechte Kohärenz zugleich ein Sekurisierungssystem zwischen Ritual und externen Kontexten: Der Feldherr, dessen Opfer vor der Schlacht von den Göttern angenommen' werden, kann sich des militärischen Erfolgs ,sicher' sein, der Seefahrer, der sein Votum rite verkündet hat, kann erwarten, sein Ziel zu erreichen, das differenzierte Organvotiv vermag den Heilungswunsch erfolgreich zu präsentieren. 32 Das hier gewählte Analyseschema operiert mit einer Transformation eines .super-human agent', im Sinne der These von E.T.

RITUELLE UND KULTURELLE KOMPLEXITÄT Im Vorhergehenden wurde zu zeigen versucht, daß Rituale nicht (genau-genommen: nie),allein stehen', sondern jeweils in externe, rituelle, aber auch nicht-religiöse Kontexte eingebunden sind. Das zu betonen, scheint trivial, es soll jedoch vor allem—gegen die Tendenz zu einer Singulari-sierung— auf die grundsätzliche Vernetzung von Ritualen verweisen. Rituale ,beziehen' sich nicht nur ,horizontal' aufeinander (das wurde unter den Stichworten von ,rituellem Zitat' und ,Interritualität' behan-delt), sondern werden auch, zumindest in komplexen Kulturen, auf dem-selben Territorium zeitgleich oder zeitnah praktiziert. Oder anders aus-gedrückt, zur kulturellen ,Umwelt' von Ritualen gehören wiederum an-dere Rituale, zu denen sie in einer Beziehung stehen können. Sakralto-pographie und Kalender liefern unter dieser Perspektive mögliche räum-liche und zeitliche Verknüpfungsregeln. Die ,Anschlußfähigkeit' von Ritualen ist eine Systemeigenschaft, insbesondere von komplexen Ritua-len, die bisher nicht hinreichend beachtet worden ist. Rituale haben zwar immer deutlich annoncierte ,Außengrenzen', personelle, räumliche und zeitliche, zugleich aber auch definierte Regeln von Übernahme, Über-schreitung und Integration. Am ehesten sind diese Eigenschaften noch im Falle des Ritualtyps ,Fest' gesehen worden: Im Blick auf Stammeskulturen hatte V. Lanternari für Feste folgende konstitutive Elemente herausgestellt:33 socialità (Gesel-ligkeit), partecipazione (Mitwirkung), ritualità (rituelle Organisation), an-nullamento temporaneo e simbolico dell ' ordine (zeitlich begrenzte, sym-bolische Aufhebung der Ordnung). Das Schema, das auch auf Feste der europäischen Traditionen anwendbar ist, zeigt vor allem im Blick auf die marginale oder liminale Phase Berührungspunkte mit van Genneps und V.W. Turners Drei- oder Vier-Phasen-Modellen. Komplexen Ritualen und den Festen kann gemeinsam sein, daß Restriktionen und Mängel der for-malen Welt'34 aufgehoben und ihre Alternativen in einem Szenario durch-33 V.

Darin scheint die Attraktivität der traditionellen großen Feste zu liegen,35 daß sie—ähnlich wie die mythische Narrative—unabgegoltene kulturelle Potentiale bereit-halten und vor Augen fuhren. ,Feste' liefern freilich nicht nur Vorgaben flir eine Pluralisierung und damit eine latente Desintegration der Gesell-schaft, sondern behalten zugleich Gemeinschaft stiftende, integrierende Funktionen. In einer,paradoxen' Funktion verbindet das komplexe Ritual fur die Teilnehmer noch einmal, was im Rahmen kultureller Differenzie-rung ,sonst' in unterschiedlichen Lebensbereichen stattfindet,36 oder in ,überholten' Traditionen vergessen schien. 9. KOMPLEXITÄT UND PROFESSIONALISIERUNG Ein Anwachsen der Komplexität von Ritualen—wie wir es als Grund-muster in den meisten Religionen verfolgen können—scheint Teil des allgemeinen Prozesses der Professionalisierung von Religion zu sein, in einem doppelten Sinne: Die ,Arbeit am Ritual' ist weitgehend Tätigkeit von Spezialisten (und deren Auftraggebern), die die Rituale neuen Be-dürfnissen anpassen, und, zweitens, die regelrechte Durchführung eines komplexen Rituals wird so schwierig, daß sie von den gleichen Spezia-listen garantiert und überwacht werden muß (in caerimoniis nihil debet esse ambiguum). Die kulturellen Bedingungen der Professionalisierung einer Ritualistik sind kaum beachtet worden, ebensowenig wie in der Religionswissenschaft Prozesse einer Professionalisierung von Religi-on' behandelt wurden. Wenn überhaupt Ritualspezialisten in der Diskus-sion auftauchen, dann über die Aufgabe, die regelgerechte Durchführung eines bestimmten Rituals zu garantieren, wenn man so will, immer nur als Kapellmeister, nie als Komponisten.

Vor allem komplexe Rituale haben nicht nur unmittelbare Teilnehmer am rituellen Prozeß, sondern eine sehr viel größere Zahl an ,Zuschauern', - wobei freilich die Grenzlinie zwischen Zuschauern und Teilnehmern weder zeitlich noch räumlich sauber zu ziehen ist. Umzüge und Prozessionen etwa ope-rieren mit wechselnden Teilnehmern auf unterschiedlichen Wegstrecken. Trotz dieses möglichen Rollenwechsels ist unverkennbar, daß komplexe Rituale vor einer Öffentlichkeit stattfinden, die den Aufwand etwa an Tieren und Gütern, die Pracht der Inszenierung, die Dauer der Festivitä-ten zu würdigen in der Lage ist. Vor dieser Öffentlichkeit konkurrieren dann Rituale in einem Prestige-Schema miteinander, in dessen Rahmen das Fest des Nachbardorfs, die Prozession der anderen Stadt oder auch nur die Feier des letzten Jahres übertroffen werden soll. Die staatlichen Feste (ludi) der römischen Republik und noch mehr der Kaiserzeit sind einschlägige Beispiele für eine Ausgestaltung' von Festen über eine Erweiterung der Elemente auf den verschiedensten Ebenen. Liefert die Hekatombe noch das Beispiel für die einfache Erweiterung eines Ele-ments, der Zahl der geopferten Rinder, konstituieren sich die komplexen Rituale über eine professionelle Kombination und dramatische Sequen-zierung höchst unterschiedlicher Elemente. Die mehrtägigen Ludi magni der Römer beispielsweise sind auch unterhalb der Ebene der spielgeben-den Magistrate nicht ohne Spezialisten denkbar, die den konkurrierenden Veranstaltern Vorschläge für neue Programme und deren praktische Umsetzung machten. Eine Veränderung, Erweiterung und Differenzie-rung von Ritualen geschieht, wie die römischen Beispielen zeigen, im allgemeinen unter den Bedingungen von Prestigekonkurrenzen: Das Op-ferfest der Nachbarstadt, der letzte Triumphzug, die Tempeleinweihung durch den konkurrierenden Magistrat, die Bilderweihe des Nachbartem-pels sollen übertroffen werden. Für das Verhältnis von Prestige und Aufwand hatte zuerst Marcel Maus auf die Potlach-Rituale verwiesen; (ed.), Understanding Rituals (European Association of Social Anthropologists; Lon-don/New York, 1992); W.

FEHLER IN RITUALEN Professionalisierungsprozesse in kulturellen Teilbereichen reflektieren nicht nur die ökonomischen Möglichkeiten der Veranstalter, sondern auch unterschiedliche Anforderungs-Niveaus für einen .Ausschluß von Fehlem', - zugleich auch die Möglichkeit (oder Kompetenz), Fehler eines bestimmten Typs überhaupt zu entdecken. Für die Professionalisie-rung einer Ritualistik ist von zentraler Bedeutung, wie mit,Fehlem' in der Durchführung eines Rituals umgegangen wurde, wer sie .gemerkt' hat, und wie sie dann korrigiert werden können. Fehlerhaft vollzogene Rituale sind natürlich .unwirksam' und müssen in der richtigen Weise, und zwar als ganze (!), wiederholt werden. Auch das kann die Ansprü-che an Rituale von den Ansprüchen an ein .Alltagshandeln' unterschei-den. Evidente Fehler wie das Weglaufen der Opfertiere (eine hostia ef-fugia muß der Albtraum eines römischen Opferherrn gewesen sein) konnten nicht überspielt werden. Die vielen Vorschriften dafür, wie das Opfertier zum Altar geführt werden sollte und mit welchen Hilfsmitteln eine .Freiwilligkeit' inszeniert wurde, zeigen, wie sich auch auf dieser Ebene eine Professionahsierung durchsetzt und in Elemente des Opferri-tuals eingeht. Der extreme Fall der hostia effugia zeigt im übrigen, wie dezidiert Korrekturen innerhalb des ablaufenden Rituals ausgeschlossen blieben: Das entlaufene Tier durfte, wenn man seiner wieder habhaft wurde, nicht zum Altar zurückgebracht werden, sondern mußte an der Stelle, an der man es gefunden hatte, getötet werden. Aus dieser Vor-schrift kann man schließen, daß das begonnene Opferritual insgesamt— natürlich mit einem ,neuen' Opfertier— wiederholt werden mußte. Was im Falle eines Routine-Rituals noch unmittelbar plausibel ist, wird im Blick auf komplexe Rituale problematisch: Wie weit reicht hier der .Zu-sammenhang' eines Rituals, konkret: Ab wann muß im Falle eines Feh-lers ,wiederholt' werden, und—nicht zu unterschätzen—welcher .Auf-wand', welche Investitionen gehen dabei verloren? Die römischen Sakraljuristen haben für die Wiederholung komplexer, fehlerhaft durchgeführter Rituale einen eigenen Begriff geprägt, den der 38 Zur Geschichte dieser Themenstellung B. Gladigow, „Religionsökonomie - Über-legungen zur einer neuen Subdisziplin,\" Lokale Religionsgeschichte, eds H.G. Kippen-berg/B.

Er bedeutet, daß das ganze Ritual—und nicht nur der feh-lerhafte ,Teil'—wiederholt werden müssen. Die Feriae Latinae, immer-hin Feste von bis zu vier Tagen Dauer, sind mehrfach wiederholt wor-den;39 später auch die Ludi Romani: ludi Romani ter, plebei quinquies toti instaurati. Diese Regelung—die vielen Festteilnehmern sicher Freu-de bereitet hat, den fur die Finanzierung zuständigen Magistraten wohl weniger—zeigt gerade wegen ihrer Kostspieligkeit, daß bestimmte Ri-tenkomplexe deutlich als eine ,Einheit', ein komplexes Ganzes verstan-den wurden (toti instaurati). Dann kann die Korrektur eines Fehlers nicht in ,Nachtrag' im Schema von addenda et corringenda erfolgen, sondern—wenn die Weiterfuhrung der Analogie aus dem Buchdruck erlaubt ist—nur als ,Neudruck'. Das wird an den Fällen besonders deut-lich, an denen die Konsequenzen eines Fehlers besonders weitreichende Folgen haben: Livius berichtet, daß das ver sacrum von 195 ν. Chri-stus,40 ein Erstlingsopfer aller in einem Frühling geborenen Tiere und Menschen, ein Jahr später wegen eines ,Formfehlers' wiederholt werden mußte. 11. DER PERSUASIVE CHARAKTER VON RITUALEN ODER: LERNEN IN RITUALEN Am Schluß dieser allgemeinen Überlegungen seien noch zwei Perspek-tiven angesprochen, die sich aus einer zuvor vorgestellten systemati-schen Sequenzierung von Ritualen ergeben. Unter der in einigen For-schungsrichtungen dominierenden Perspektive des Performativen ist wenig beachtet worden, daß in der zeitlichen Sequenz eines Rituals, auf der horizontalen Ebene gewissermaßen, Veränderungen der Beteiligten oder der Zuschauer vor sich gehen. Ritualsequenzen lassen sich nicht nur über die bloße Abfolge ihrer Elemente und ihre Struktur beschrei-ben, sondern auch—in einer Art ,Wirkungsästhetik'—als persuasive oder psychagogische Strategien. Für Mysterienrituale ist dies auch immer gesehen worden. Die Kompo-sition der eleusinischen Telete ist auf einen Höhepunkt ausgerichtet: die epoptie, die Schau des geheimen Mysteriensymbols. Die Abfolge der Ein-weihungsschritte und Grade scheint wohlüberlegt und—trotz Aristoteles' gegenteiliger Bemerkung—einen Lernvorgang in ein Visions- und Auditi-onserlebnis zu überführen. Typische Ritualsequenzen (Bad und Opfer am 39 Liv. XXI 63,8; XXII 1,6; XLIV 19,4; Cass.Dio XLVI 33.4. 40 Livius 34, 44,1-3."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"ersten Tag, Prozession und Kultspiel am zweiten, kollektive Schau epoptie am dritten) begründen Vorbereitung, Lernschritte und psychische Konditi-onierung. Damit diese ,rekursiven Schleifen' von den Teilnehmern des Rituals auch ,richtig' wahrgenommen (verarbeitet) werden, bedarf es einer transponierenden Wiederholung, vergleichbar mit einem Schema, das in der modernen Diadaktik als, Spiral-Curriculum' bezeichnet wird. Ob die-ses ,Lernen im Ritual' auch bedeutet, daß das Ritual von den Teilnehmern selbst (oder als Ganzes) verstanden werden muß, formal gesprochen: ob es wirklich selbstexplikativ ist, möchte ich allerdings eher bezweifeln. Wie-derholungen in einem Ritual lassen sich in jedem Falle nicht nur als retar-dierende Elemente' oder,Kompositionsfugen zwischen typischen Sequen-zen' interpretieren, sondern als Rekapitulationen und Lernschritte. Damit ist die allgemeine Frage, ob es auch auf der Seite der Teilnehmer und , Be-nutzer' eine ,Kompetenz',41 eine rituelle Kompetenz gegeben hat, noch nicht beantwortet. Hat man eigentlich Rituale ,geübt', wurden für die komplexen, großen Rituale ,Proben' veranstaltet? Für den hier vorgestell-ten religionshistorischen Bereich hat sich niemand diese Fragen gestellt -anders als für den Sonderfall von Theater- und Musikaufführungen und ihre agonalen Rahmenbedingungen. Neben dem ,kognitiven' Lernen im Ritual steht ein zweiter Bereich, dessen differenzierte Interpretation ebenso unbeachtet geblieben ist: Der Bereich einer Erzeugung von differenzierten Emotionen durch das Ritual und in der Ritualsequenz. Damit ist nicht die These angesprochen, daß „Emotionen in Rituale umgesetzt werden\", wie die eingängige pauschale Formulierung lautet, sondern umgekehrt, wie durch rituelle Sequenzen unterschiedliche Gefühle und Emotionen erzeugt und gesteuert werden können. Das könnte bereits für einzelne Elemente und auf einer einfa-chen Ebene gelten: Daß man durch ein .rituelles Lachen' (etwa den risus Paschalis) fröhlich wird, oder durch rituelles Weinen (Klagen) Belas-tungen abbaut, scheinen aktuelle Richtungen der Verhaltenstherapie zu bestätigen und einige Therapeuten versuchen, diese Erfahrungen nutz-bringend einzusetzen. Die Neurobiologie der siebziger Jahre des letzten Jahrhunderts hat der Funktion von Ritualen für eine Koordination zwischen einzelnen Organismen (also auch Menschen) und innerhalb der einzelnen Orga-41 Zu den allgemeineren Perspektiven vgl. B. Gladigow, „Erwerb religiöser Kompe-tenz. Kult und Öffentlichkeit in den klassischen Religionen,\" Religiöse Kommunikation, ed. H.

Vereinfacht und plakativ ausgedrückt, besonders effektive Rituale organisieren und synchronisieren gruppen-dynamische und soziale Wirkungen auf der einen mit neurologischen und endokrinologischen Effekten auf der anderen Seite. Die im Moment in Nordamerika aufblühende sog. ,Neurotheologie' setzt hier wieder ein und nutzt die verbesserten Analysetechniken und bildgebenden Verfah-ren, um ,hot spots' für Rituale zu finden. Komplexität und zeitliche Dau-er von Ritualen sind allerdings auch hier noch nicht konsequent in das Blickfeld gerückt; dies wäre umgekehrt das Feld einer Religionswis-senschaft, die die Ergebnisse dieser Forschungen für eine systematische Analyse komplexer Rituale nutzt. 12. ,NOTATION' VON RITEN UND DAS ,KOMPONIEREN' VON RITUALEN Wenn man Forschungslage und Forschungsdefizite vor dem Hintergrund der hier skizzierten Neuansätze zusammenfassend zu charakterisieren ver-sucht, ergeben sich etwa folgende Befunde: Rituale zu ,erzeugen', zu komponieren, gar unterschiedliche Rituale aufeinander abzustimmen, ein kohärentes System von Riten zu erzeugen—alles Ergebnisse einer hohen Professionalisierung von Religion—erscheint in dem betrachteten For-schungskontext nicht als selbständiges Thema. Oder höchstens indirekt über die pauschalen Topoi von Kultbegründung, Kultreform oder Antiritu-alismus, den performativen Widerspruch von Ritualen des Antiritualismus eingeschlossen. Ahnliches gilt für die korrespondierende These einer .ritu-ellen Kompetenz' als Randbedingung einer rituellen Vernetzung. Damit eng verbunden ist eine der Rezeptionsästhetik und Wirkungsästhetik der Literaturwissenschaft vergleichbare Frage nach der,Lesbarkeit von Ritua-len': Wie werden Rituale von Akteuren, Veranstaltern, Teilnehmern und Zuschauern ,rezipiert'? Ändert sich in unterschiedlichen Epochen und Kulturen das Verständnis von Ritualen? Können sie gar notorisch,falsch' verstanden werden? Wirken sie nur, wenn die Teilnehmer sie verstehen oder an sie ,glauben'? Oder gilt auch hier die listige Antwort von Max Born, der, vorwurfsvoll auf ein Hufeisen über seiner Zimmertür angespro-42 Dazu E.G.d'Aquili/Ch.D.Laughlin Jr./J.McManus (eds), The Spectrum of Ritual.

Für die Europäische Religionsgeschichte ließe sich immerhin zeigen, daß mit der Tendenz, eine ,Lesbarkeit' von Religionen über Texte in den Vordergrund zu stellen,43 eine ,Lesefähigkeit' für Rituale nachläßt: Ritu-ale werden, wenn man so will, ,unleserlich'. Die Auswirkungen eines Gruppendrucks im Schema von Mary Douglas auf dieses Faktum, oder des Zivilisatorischen Prozesses' in der Aufnahme von Thesen von Nor-bert Elias, wären noch aufzuarbeiten und in verschiedenen kulturellen und historischen Kontexten zu überprüfen. In der Neueren und Neuesten Religionsgeschichte sind immerhin von Fall zu Fall Autoren,,Kompo-nisten' von Ritualen bekannt. Dies wird jeweils an den Stellen möglich, an denen die Selbstverständlichkeit' überlieferter Rituale in Frage ge-stellt wird. Für die verschiedenen Freimaurer-Logen, aber auch die Ritu-ale der Französischen Revolution lassen sich ,Ritensetzer' benennen. Regelrechte ,Notationen' oder ,Choreographien' von Ritualen scheinen aber zu fehlen, sie werden jeweils in verbalisierter Form (letzen Endes der alte Typ der Festbeschreibung) festgehalten. Wenn sich eine solche Verbindung von Notation und Choreographie entwickeln oder aus Mu-sik und Tanz übernehmen ließe, wäre eine effektive Sequenzierung von Ritualen möglich, die Elemente und Strukturen überschaubar macht, -und lehrbar! In der rezenten Religionsgeschichte werden immerhin nicht nur unter beliefnet.com die passenden Religionen angeboten, sondern im Internet werden auch schon Kompositionshilfen für Rituale verbreitet: ,Help for Beginners' heißt es unter Composing a Ritual,44 Auf einer an-deren website45 werden Components of Ritual angeboten und schließlich ein ,.Ritual Design ' entworfen.

Snoek There is just no such thing as a theory-free description of a ritual. De-scriptions of rituals are always made \"through the glasses\" of theories, even if the describers are not conscientiously aware of the theories they hold. Everyone who describes a ritual has some ideas in mind about what a ritual is, what is important about it, what he wants to communi-cate of it to the reader, etc. And all those ideas are based on a kind of implicit theory which the describer has about rituals in general and about this particular ritual. I think that the quality of our work would improve when we would make ourselves aware of the theoretical preconceptions which we have in mind, and when we would make conscientiously use of both our own theories and those of others in order to see more aspects of the rituals we study, so that we could make more precise and complete descriptions. For this paper I choose the Indian Zoroastrian Navjote ritual, \"the ini-tiation of a Zoroastrian child into the fold\",' as my example. The aims of this paper are: ( 1 ) to see whether it is proper to call the Navjote ritual an initiation ritual, as is usually done; (2) to show how theory shapes our perception of rituals; and (3) to demonstrate how ritual theories can help to see aspects of rituals which might otherwise have been overlooked. These aims are closely related. The first question is of a kind which is normally not posed; it is taken for granted that you can do it. But can we indeed do it, is it proper, and in what sense then? We will see that it de-pends on the theory used if the answer is \"yes\" (aim-1). Other theories may make us perceive Navjote differently (aim-2). And accordingly, each theory will be seen to highlight different aspects of the Navjote rit-ual (aim-3). There are many theories about rituals in general and about initiation rituals in particular. I will present here four theories about initiation ritu-als, including my own one, viz. those by Van Gennep, Eliade, Snoek and Bloch. I selected these, because (a) three of them (Van Gennep's, Eli-1 J.J. Modi, The Religious Ceremonies and Customs of the Parsees (Bombay, 1922, 2nd ed. 1937, reprint 1995), p. 169."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"ade's & Bloch's) are very well known, (b) in my opinion, although some of them (Van Gennep's & Eliade's) were formulated relatively long ago, none of them is outdated, and (c) together they represent both the center (Van Gennep's & Snoek's) and a wider periphery (Eliade's & Bloch's) of the field. Furthermore, the second and third of these theories (Eliade's and Snoek's) are rather in the form of descriptions and definitions, but such higher level abstractions, describing a larger group of phenomena (in this case: initiations), imply much more theory than descriptions of individual performances of rituals; the first and last ones (Van Gennep's and Bloch's) are explicit theories.2 Since the later authors were aware of the works of at least some of the preceding ones, I will present them in chronological order. As stated above, it is my intention to apply these theories to one par-ticular description of one particular ritual: the Parsi Navjote.3 A crucial methodological problem here is that, since each description is influenced by the theory or theories that the describer had in mind, there cannot ex-ist a single ideal description of a ritual. In addition, different describers had different performances of the same ritual in mind, and a perform-ance in, say, Bombay in 1998 need not be completely identical to one in, say, a village in Gujarat in 1920 (indeed, it is much more likely that they were not). So, which description should I take to compare the theories with? Early anthropology often gave descriptions of the so-and-so ritual on the basis of the observation of a single performance, assuming that all performances would be identical. Once it was understood that there was variation, scholars often tried to solve this problem by either producing a description, integrating the observations of a number of performances (e.g. Victor Turner's descriptions of the rituals of the Ndembu), or by accumulating a number of different descriptions, hoping to assemble in that way a most complete impression of the ritual they were interested in. Recently, several studies have drawn farreaching conclusions on the ba-sis of an observation or description of a single performance. Since I want to focus on the value of the theories for the production of richer descrip-tions, rather than on the value of the descriptions for the testing of theo-2 So, all in all, I distinguish three levels at which theories are found: (1) implicit in descriptions of observed performances; (2) included in, or even explicitly built into, definitions or descriptions of concepts at a higher level of abstraction, such as \"initia-tions\"; (3) theories, explicitly formulated as such. 3 In what follows, I will restrict myself to the Indian versions, and will not consider functional equivalents from Iran or elsewhere."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"ries, I also prefer to select only one description as my primary point of reference. Jivanji Jamshedji Modi (1854-1933) was a Parsi priest and scholar in Bombay.4 His description of the Navjote ritual is the most detailed one available,5 and generally regarded the most authoritative one. It is there-fore that I select this description6 for comparison with our theories. Also when, for convenience sake, I don't mention Modi explicitly, but seem to refer to the Navjote as such, I am in fact always and only referring to Modi's description of it. We shall see, however, that sometimes Modi's description can not give the answer to the question if this or that feature, predicted by a theory, is present in Navjote, since it is not mentioned in this particular description. This confirms that Modi also had a theory in mind, which directed his decisions about what to include in his descrip-tion and what not. That does not mean that Modi produced a bad de-scription. All descriptions have this restriction. And it is precisely here that theories are valuable, since on the one hand they make us aware of this limitation, and on the other they can help us to produce richer de-scriptions, by pointing our attention to aspects which we might otherwise have overlooked. As an experiment, I asked the participants in the symposium to in-form me, during the presentation of this paper—on the basis of their knowledge of the actual practice of Navjote today, of ritual texts, and of different traditions—about points where the description by Modi was inadequate for my purpose. Such information was indeed provided by several participants, especially by the two priests present: Dastur Feroze 4 On Modi see e.g. M. Stausberg, Die Religion Zarathushtras.

Kotwal and Ervad Ramiyar P. Karanjia.71 am grateful for their con-tribution to this paper, which I am happy to acknowledge here. No doubt, without their help this paper would have been less interesting.8 We have to be aware, however, that there is a time gap of some 80 years between the practices observed by Modi, and those of today. Differences surely developed during this period. Arnold van Gennep (1909) In 1909, van Gennep published his now famous book Les rites de pas-sage,9 in which he introduced the 'tripartite pattern' of the rites de pas-sage (transition rituals): preliminal - liminal - postliminal, or also sepa-ration - transition {marge) - incorporation. The non-obvious in this the-ory is the existence of the liminal, transition period. Van Gennep does not give an explanation for it, but just presents it as the result of his analysis of the material he studied, and many empirical studies have since then confirmed the correctness of his observation for a wide range of rituals. Indeed, van Gennep never claimed that this structure would pertain to all rituals; he distinguished a particular class of rituals which show this feature and called this class the rites de passage, transition rituals. Most scholars agree that initiations are a sub-class of these transition rituals.10 Therefore, if we want to answer our first question—if it is proper to call the Navjote an initiation ritual—the first thing we should do is to verify if it fits van Gennep's criteria of a rite de passage. The most important of these, is that rites de passage show a particu-lar structure, which is generally known as three-fold, but is in fact a five-fold one (see figure 1): 7 This information is always indicated explicitly so that it can be distinguished from the information provided by Modi's description. Two sets of questions (indicated as such below) could not be posed to the audience for lack of time. Dastur Kotwal and Ervad Karanjia were so kind to answer them later by e-mail. 8 Of course, the final responsibility for the contents of this paper remains mine alone. 9 1 will quote the English translation: The Rites of Passage (London, 1960).

This structure is easily recognizable in Modi's description of the Navjote: the purification bath (nähn) and the fasting which follows it represent the separation from the initial state; the transition is character-ized by the clothing with the sudreh ('sacred shirt') and kusti ('sacred thread'), accompanied with certain prayers; and the incorporation into the new state is expressed by the recitations of the Articles of Faith, the final benediction, and the festive meal. Most of these elements do not require explication. But in order to make clear that this recitation of the Articles of Faith does represent an incorporation into the final state, it may be useful to quote it here (in Modi's translation): The child, after being thus invested with the sacred shirt and thread, an-nounces the last and the most important of the Articles of Faith, given in the 12th chapter of the Yaçna. It runs thus: \"O Almighty! Come to my help. I am a worshipper of God. I am a Zoroastrian worshipper of God. I agree to praise the Zoroastrian religion, and to believe in that religion. I praise good thoughts, good words and good deeds. I praise the good Mazdayaçnian re-ligion which curtails discussions and quarrels, which brings about kinship of brotherhood, which is holy, and which, of all the religions that have yet"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"flourished and are likely to flourish in the future, is the greatest, the best and the most excellent, and which is the religion given by God to Zoroaster. I believe, that all good things proceed from God. May the Mazdayaçnian re-ligion be thus praised.\"11 Whereas the child concerned entered the ritual as someone who is not yet a full member of the Zoroastrian religious community, it here openly declares its adherence to this religion, thus confirming its acceptance of now being a member of this religious community. Therefore I would re-gard the recitation of this text as a rite of incorporation. Also the text of the benediction indicates the start of a new life. A meal of all participants concludes many transition rituals as an integration ritual. The question if a particular ritual fits a particular theory is always a matter of interpretation of both [the description of] the ritual and the the-ory. But in this case, I would claim that it is rather easy to interpret them in such a way that they fit. Van Gennep's theory about transition rituals, however, is much richer than his finding that they have this particular structure. For example, he also claimed that Such changes of condition do not occur without disturbing the life of soci-ety and the individual, and it is the function of rites of passage to reduce their harmful effects. That such changes are regarded as real and important is demonstrated by the recurrence of rites, in important ceremonies among widely different peoples, enacting death in one condition and resurrection in another.12 Here he uses the term \"resurrection\" where elsewhere he also uses \"re-birth\". The recognition that the symbolism of death and resurrection or rebirth is characteristic of initiation rituals is not a discovery of van Gen-nep; it was there already for several decades when he published his book.13 This symbolism can also be recognized in the Navjote. The pre-paratory bath can be interpreted as a washing off of the old status (thus a process of dying for the old person), whereas the fasting may be seen as 11 Modi, The Religious Ceremonies and Customs of the Parsees, pp. 184 f. 12 Van Gennep, The Rites of Passage, p. 13. 13 E.g.

The recitation of the \"Tandaruçti or benedic-tions\" (Modi) also indicate the new life of the candidate: \"May you en-joy health, long life ...\"14 Indeed, the date of Navjote is by many Parsees celebrated as their 'religious birthday' so it is seen by the participants as a kind of new birth. Van Gennep was furthermore of the opinion that life cycle rituals do not concern the physiological process, but rather the social change in-volved.15 For example: a ritual performed at the occasion of the birth of a new child does not cause its birth, but integrates the child into the com-munity. Likewise, puberty rituals integrate the candidates into the group of adult men and/or women. This too holds for Navjote: it integrates the child into the Zoroastrian community, of those who take responsibility for their thoughts, words and deeds. According to van Gennep, one and the same ceremony may contain different kinds of rites and ritual processes simultaneously,16 for example both a transition ritual and other rituals and rites, such as fertility, protec-tion, divination, defensive, or propitiatory rites or rituals. Navjote in-cludes, in India, such rites as making a red kunkun mark on the child's forehead (a protection rite), and the 'showering' of the candidates with a mixture of rice, pomegranate seeds, almonds, raisins, etc. (a fertility rite). Van Gennep claims that, if a ceremony contains at least one transition ritual, then it is that which gives structure to the ceremony as a whole.17 Clearly this holds for Navjote. Van Gennep also noticed that the same ceremony may be one kind of rite de passage for one (group of) participant(s), and another kind of rite de passage for another.18 For example, a ceremony performed at the oc-casion of the birth of her first child may transfer the mother to the group of matrons, and at the same time transfer the new bom child to the group of living people.19 Modi gives no information concerning this issue in 14 Modi, The Religious Ceremonies and Customs of the Parsees, p. 185. 15 Van Gennep, The Rites of Passage, p. 46. 16 Van Gennep, The Rites of Passage, pp. 11 f., 42, 59, 117, 151, 192 f. 17 Van Gennep, The Rites of Passage, pp. 10 f. 18 Van Gennep, The Rites of Passage, p. 118 f., 139, 147. 19 Van Gennep, The Rites of Passage, p. 50.

From these statements by van Gennep it follows that a ceremony may be an initiation ritual for the individual candidates, and a group constitut-ing ritual for the group of candidates (in those cases where there is such a group). If this is the case, then these are two different rituals, taking place within one and the same ceremony. For Navjote, this is not the case, however. Even when more than one child is involved in the same Navjote ceremony (which is usually not the case in India, but quite common in Iran), then they are not turned into a lasting group. Van Gennep wrote: \"mysteries\" comprise the ceremonial whole which transfers the neophyte from the profane to the sacred world and places him in direct and perma-nent communication with the latter. The display of sacra at Eleusis, as also in Australia (churinga, sacred bull-roarer) or in America (masks, sacred ears of corn, Katcinas, etc.), is the culmination rite but does not itself constitute the \"mysteries\".20 In other words: initiation rituals culminate in the revelation of certain sacra. Modi explicitly referred to the sudreh and kusti as the \"sacred shirt and thread\".2' I wondered if this terminology was not the result of Western influence, rather than traditional Zoroastrian. Ervad Karanjia, however, told that the sudreh and kusti are indeed regarded as sacred within the Zoroastrian tradition. Still, I am not convinced that they could be regarded as sacra in the sense in which van Gennep is using that term here, i.e. objects in which the divine is present and through which it re-veals itself. Finally, van Gennep noticed that initiates are usually distinguished by badges, such as those produced by circumcision or scarification. But such badges do not need to be permanent ones; examples of non-permanent ones include special dress, masks, or body painting.22 In the case of Navjote, the sudreh and kusti obviously qualify. I wondered if the kunkun mark would also qualify. That would depend on whether Navjote 20 Van Gennep, The Rites of Passage, p. 89. 21 Modi, The Religious Ceremonies and Customs of the Parsees, pp. 169, 172, 177 etc., my italics. 22 Van Gennep, The Rites of Passage, p. 74."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"is the first occasion when a child gets a kunkun mark or not. Ervad Karanjia told that this is not the case. Therefore it is not a specific mark of its passing this process. Mircea Eliade (1958) Eliade wrote extensively on initiation rituals.23 This culminated in the Haskell Lectures of 1956 in Chicago: \"Patterns of Initiation\", which were published as Birth and Rebirth (Naissances mystiques) in 1958.24 This is probably the best known book on initiation rituals. For our pur-pose it is significant, in the first place because it gives a definition of ini-tiation rituals, which we may use as a test to see if it is proper to call Navjote an initiation ritual, according to Eliade. It also gives a rather large collection of characteristics which, Eliade claims, are found in most, if not all, initiation rituals. Not all scholars would agree that all of these characteristics would apply to all initiation rituals, but it are pre-cisely those which may be thought provocative: they may make us see things in the Navjote ritual which we might have overlooked otherwise. Let us start, however, with Eliade's definition: The term initiation in the most general sense denotes a body of rites and oral teachings whose purpose is to produce a decisive alteration in the reli-gious and social status of the person to be initiated. In philosophical terms, initiation is equivalent to a basic change in existential condition; the novice emerges from his ordeal endowed with a totally different being from that 25 which he possessed before his initiation; he has become another. From this definition follows in the first place that \"the term initiation ... denotes a body of rites\", i.e. the rites [= building blocks of ceremonies] involved are not restricted to one ceremonial [composed of one or more ceremonies], performed in one place and time. For example, in Navjote, 23 On Eliade see e.g. G. Dudley, Religion on Trial: Mircea Eliade and His Critics (Philadelphia, 1977); C. Olson, The Theology and Philosophy of Eliade. A Search for the Centre (London etc., 1992); D. Allen/D. Doeing (eds), Mircea Eliade: An Anno-tated Bibliography (New York/London, 1980). 24 The English version was \"Translated from the French by Willard R. Trask,\" but appeared in 1958, so before the French version, which was only published in 1959. It is therefore, that Eliade could write in the \"Avant-Propos\" to the French version: \"Le texte qu'on va lire présente quelques menues différences avec la version anglaise publiée par Harper sous le titre de Birth and Rebirth (New York, 1958)\" (Eliade, Naissances mys-tiques, pp. 7 f.). Apparently, this remark was added in a late stage of the preparation of the text, since the \"Avant-Propos\" is dated \"Paris-Chicago 1956-1957\"! 25 Eliade, Birth and Rebirth, p. x."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"first the purification bath (nähn) is performed, after which the child is taken to a different place for the investiture. This characteristic, however, clearly is not a requirement for something to qualify as an initiation; Eli-ade just mentions that it is possible. Secondly, these rites are accompanied by \"oral teachings\". In Navjote we find prayers and recitations of sacred texts. As Ervad Karanjia con-firmed, the child normally knows these text before the ritual commences, and has even learned most of them by heart. Yet, Modi seems to have regarded these texts as at least partly of an instructive nature, when he states that the most important part of these short prayers [from the 12th chapter of the Yasna, spoken immediately after the investiture, JS] is that, wherein the child is made to believe in the efficacy of one's own good thoughts, words and actions.26 Thirdly, these \"rites and oral teachings\" pursue \"a decisive alteration in the religious and social status\" of the candidate. Again, in Navjote, the child becomes a responsible member of the community of Zoroastrians. In the summary at the end of his book,27 Eliade once more enumerates what he regards the most important characteristics of initiation rituals, some of which were not mentioned in the definition at the beginning of the book. We find here such features as that the ritual death is not neces-sarily represented by bodily infliction, although this is usually the case. In Navjote, there are no bodily inflictions. According to Eliade, religious rituals, including initiations, always repeat a mythical example of a Divine Being, thereby reactualizing that example.28 That would mean that there should be a myth or a tradition that Navjote was first performed in a divine context introduced by a di-vinity. Modi does not mention that. But in the discussion Choksy drew my attention to the fact that the mythology does attribute the Navjote kusti to Yima.29 And Ervad Karanjia added that in the Zarâtusht Nâma, it is stated that Zarathushtra asked his father for the kusti.30 Although 26 Modi, The Religious Ceremonies and Customs of the Parsees, p. 185, my italics. 27 Eliade, Birth and Rebirth, pp. 128-132. 28 Eliade, Birth and Rebirth, p. 6. 29 Dâdestân îdënîg 38, 19-21. 30 Ervad Karanjia referred here to p. 31 in Chapter 2 \"Nav-javäni ane din bäbeni tai-yäri\", i.e.: \"Youth and preparations regarding Religion\" of A new Zarthosht nameh or An account of the life of Zoroaster, the Prophet, being a translation of Prof. A.V.W.

As a result of this identification with a mythical example, the partici-pants are, again according to Eliade, recast into the mythical Time of the Beginning {in illo tempore), and at the place where the example took place: the center of the World, since the World extended from that place and moment, and it is only there that one can pass between heaven, earth, and underworld.31 We have just established that Zarathushtra's first binding of the kusti may be regarded as the mythical example. We might interpret that as taking place in illo tempore. Now, does Zoroas-trianism regard the place where Zarathushtra got his kusti as the center of the world? This question, not addressed by Modi, caused a lively discus-sion during the symposium. Besides that all agreed that within Zoroas-trianism Iran is the center of the world, there were different opinions when it came to being more precise. My conclusion was, that it would be interesting to see in how far such a theory might make it possible for us to look differently at the usual interpretations of existing texts, and say: well, we never looked at it in this way, but if you look at it from this an-gle, you may interpret this or that text in this way indeed. Panaino and Choksy mentioned that there exists an interpretation of the kusti as a symbol of the axis mundi. Which surely would be in line with Eliade's way of thinking. several other editions of the Zarâtusht Nâma, but they do not have this passage. This edition, however, indicates in a footnote that this episode is also found in the Zâdspram and the Denkard.

Those partici-pating in the ceremonial thus really enjoy the experience of the presence of the Divine Being. As a result, the ceremonial realizes a new start for the community: old time is abolished; a new time, a new cosmogony, is commenced.32 Our previous discussion somehow anticipated this issue, so it seems that there are interpretations of Navjote around which are not too far removed from this kind of theory. Eliade confirms that initiation rituals symbolize a process of death and rebirth, an aspect which he analyses extensively.33 We have seen in the section on van Gennep that this applies to Navjote, so I will not elaborate on that any more. Then Eliade describes the denotation of the concept 'initiation', i.e. those things which he actually regards to be initiations, listing the follow-ing: puberty rituals for men; initiations into male secret societies; puberty rituals for women; initiations into female secret societies; other life cycle rituals; shamanic initiations; Yoga; military initiations; Greco-Oriental mysteries; initiations into Christianity; initiations into the professions of smiths and alchemists; initiations in the modern Western world.34 When comparing Navjote to this list, it seems to me to be on the one hand a Zoroastrian parallel to the initiations into Christianity. Most cer-tainly, it is a life cycle ritual too. It has, however, more specifically, also some similarity to puberty rituals: although no segregation of boys and girls takes place, and also no sexual symbolism or instructions concern-ing sexuality or specific sexual role-taking are involved, current Parsee marriage law states that Navjote is a prerequisite for marriage.35 And it is typical of many puberty rituals indeed that they qualify their participants for marriage.36 That normally the children are biologically not yet in their 32 Eliade, Birth and Rebirth, pp. 6, 13, 19, 21, 71, 72, 112. 33 See J.

Ervad Karanjia here noted that in the past, sometimes marriage preceded Navjote, especially in the cases of child marriages. Based on that information, we decided not to class Navjote as a puberty ritual. Eliade is the first author to take initiations for women seriously, and to explore their similarities with, and differences from, those for men. His conclusions here are that they are highly comparable to those for men; dif-fer in the contents of the secrets communicated; differ in the symbols used; and are usually less elaborate. Also, initiations into female secret societies are even more comparable to those for men than puberty rituals.37 It is remarkable that Navjote is exactly the same for boys and girls, yes, that even no segregation between boys and girls takes place. That is really exceptional. Finally, Eliade extends the concept of initiations to other contexts than rituals. He speaks then of initiatory patterns, initiatory structures, or initiatory scenarios which he finds in the literature and the dreams of modem men. They would all have the same function, viz. to satisfy the inborn need, wish or will of men to transcend the profane, natural, given existence, and to partake of the sacred, cultural, revealed existence.38 Navjote also seems to satisfy this description. Jan A.M. Snoek(1987) I formulated my own theory about initiation rituals in the form of a defi-nition in my Initiations: A Methodological Approach to the Application of Classification and Definition Theory in the Study of Rituals, pub-lished in 198739 in which I tried to integrate the then existing definitions of the term \"initiations\".

For example, it does not include all of Eliade's fea-tures, and it adds some, distinguished by other scholars. For our purpose, my definition is significant to see if it is proper to refer to Navjote as an initiation ritual. My claim, that it is significant in this way, is based on the fact that it integrates the points of view, formulated in a representa-tive selection of the scholarly literature on initiation rituals. My defini-tion, then, runs as follows: Initiations are all those, and only those, rites de passage, limited in time, and involving at least one subject participant, which are nonrecurrent transi-tions in time for their individual objects (the candidates).40 From this definition, a number of monothetic characteristics (i.e. charac-teristics which always apply) can be inferred. In the first place, initiations, as rites de passage, are a subclass of rituals. As such, they are ritual processes, oriented towards an object (viz. the individual candidates), having some function(s) for that object.41 This holds for Navjote, which is a rite de passage for the individual can-didates with the function to change them from children without respon-sibility into adherents of the Zoroastrian religion, who take responsibility for their thoughts, words and deeds. Secondly, Rites de passage have a tripartite structure: preliminal, liminal, postliminal. For initiations, the preliminal rites can be summarized as expressing a sym-bolic death, the liminal rites as expressing the spiritual condition of the can-didate^), and the postliminal rites as expressing a symbolic rebirth or resur-rection.42 We have seen that we can interpret Navjote in this way. I then distinguish two kinds of initiations: \"Initiations sensu stricto -as opposed to initiations sensu lato - show culmination rites, expressing a confrontation or identification with a divinity.\"43 Modi gives no indica-tion that Navjote would qualify as an initiation sensu stricto in this sense, and neither do I see such culmination rites in Navjote. Thus I would class it as an initiation sensu lato. 40 Snoek, Initiations, p. 173. 41 Snoek, Initiations, p. 173. 42 Snoek, Initiations, p. 173. 43 Snoek, Initiations, p. 173. For examples of culmination rites, see table 6.5 in Snoek, Initiations, p. 154."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"\"Initiations may be preceded by preparatory rites.\"44 For Navjote we might think of the learning of the prayers, and—within the ritual process itself—the purification bath (nâhn) may also be interpreted as a prepara-tory rite. \"The object of a rite de passage, and thus of an initiation, must fulfill certain predefined conditions in order to qualify for its role in the rit-ual.\"45 In the case of Navjote, the candidates must be borri from Zoroas-trian parents, have the right age (officially between 7 and 15), and know the required prayers by heart. The \"object of an initiation is an individual person: the candidate.\"46 Clearly this is the case with Navjote. The additional conditions, that initiations are limited in time and involve at least one subject participant, imply (1) that initiations may not take a life-time, but must come to an end, principally distinctly before the physical death of the candidates, and (2) that at least one initiator should take part in the ritual, which renders 'self-initiation' a contradiction in terms.47 Navjote clearly satisfies this criterion. The 'transition in time' for the candidates is, simply stated, a change in one or some of their statuses. This change is both expressed and produced by the ritual.48 This too applies to Navjote. \"Initiations are first-time rituals which cannot be repeated (are nonre-current) for the same candidate.\"49 Which is also the case with Navjote. Besides such monothetic characteristics, there are also some poly-thetic characteristics of initiations, i.e. characteristics which initiations have often but not always, and absence of which does not disqualify the ritual as an initiation. In my book I mention these:50 \"Through an initiation, one usually becomes a member of a group. In that case it is also the only means to become a member.\"51 Navjote 44 Snoek, Initiations, p. 173. 45 Snoek, Initiations, p. 173. 46 Snoek, Initiations, p. 173. 47 Snoek, Initiations, p. 173. 48 Snoek, Initiations, p. 173. 49 Snoek, Initiations, p. 174. 50 These were skipped during the presentation, due to lack of time.

However there are no 'dangerous influences of the sacred during the liminal phase of the ritual' (as Karanjia puts it). \"Usually, a candidate is conducted by one or two guides or instruc-tors.\"54 According to Ervad Karanjia This holds true for Navjote. The priest who performs the Navjote is usually a Head Priest (Dasturji) or a matured, pious priest. He leads the child in performance of his first Kushti ritual and blesses him at the end. And Dastur Kotwal confirms that The candidate is conducted [to the dais where the Navjote ritual proper is to be performed] by the priest who has administered the purificatory bath. \"Usually, the initiated can be recognized by (permanent or removable) badges, obtained during their initiation.\"55 As we have seen, the sudreh and kusti have this function for Navjote. Usually, the background of initiations is the Weltbild of the dying and resur-recting nature of life. Usually, an initiation is a reactualization of a myth. If so, the candidate will often be identified with the mythical example. The ritual is usually claimed to be instituted by some mythical being(s) in the beginning of time (in illo tempore). Often an initiation is performed at the symbolic centre of the world, representing the place where the mythical ex-ample for the ritual took place.56 In how far this holds for Navjote was discussed already in the section on Eliade. 52 Snoek, Initiations, p. 174. 53 Snoek, Initiations, p. 174. 54 Snoek, Initiations, p. 174. 55 Snoek, Initiations, p. 174. 56 Snoek, Initiations, p. 174."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"In most initiations, experiential (and sometimes also practical) knowledge is transferred, which is intrinsically (or sometimes explicitly) restricted to the initiates. Since knowledge once acquired cannot be unlearned, initiation is almost always irreversible.57 Navjote too is irreversible, and it transfers the experiential knowledge of how it is to pass through it as a candidate. Finally, I summarized the denotation of initiations as follows: Rituals, accompanying the coming of age, becoming a member of a 'secret' society, or a shaman are usually initiations. Other Life cycle and Inaugural Rituals, such as birth, marriage, parenthood, funeral, and enthronement ritu-als, may be so as well.58 Navjote is clearly a life cycle ritual. Maurice Bloch (1992) In 1992, Maurice Bloch published his Prey into Hunter: The Politics of Religious Experience,59 Its central theme is, what he calls, \"Rebounding Violence\", which he illustrates in chapters on Initiation (i.e. puberty ritu-als, pp. 8-23); Sacrifice (pp. 24-45); Cosmogony and the State (dealing i.a. with death rituals, pp. 46-64); Marriage (pp. 65-84); Millenarian-ism (pp. 85-98); and Myth (pp. 99-105). Thus, his theory is not tar-geted to initiation rituals exclusively, and—as in the case of van Gen-nep—compliance of Navjote with it therefore does not answer our ques-tion if it is proper to refer to Navjote as an initiation ritual. But, as we shall see, it does demonstrate how ritual theories can help to see aspects of rituals which might otherwise have been overlooked, and shows how theory shapes our perception of rituals. The term \"Rebounding Violence\" refers to the fact that, in many ritu-als, two stages of violence may be recognized, which are in a number of ways related and opposed to one another. To illustrate these relations and oppositions, I will restrict myself to the example of the puberty rituals which Bloch describes,60 since these are from his examples clearly those closest related to Navjote. 57 Snoek, Initiations, p. 174. 58 Snoek, Initiations, p. 174. 59 For a critical evaluation of Bloch's thesis, see M. Houseman/C. Severi, Naven or the Other Self; A Relational Approach to Ritual Action (Studies in the History of Religions 79; Leiden et al., 1998), pp. 172-178. 60 M.

This act moves the community—not only the candidate(s)61—into the spiritual world (i.e. the realm of the dead / spirits / gods). In a later, second step, some exter-nal source of vitality (food, especially that which consists of killed ani-mals) is absorbed: this is the second, real violence. This moves the community, transformed, back into the natural world (i.e. the realm of the living).62 Navjote can be interpreted this way. It makes the meal af-terwards a very important part of the ritual! This may not be the usual way to interpret it, but the meal is a standard part of the ritual. So noth-ing seems to prohibit this interpretation. This is a nice example of a case where the theory makes you look really different at the ritual. Also, the first violence (the symbolic death of the candidates) is ori-ented against the own, internal (biological) vitality, given with natural birth, whereas the second violence (the killing of the animals which are to be eaten) is oriented against external vitality, which is conquered and appropriated by cultural action.63Again, Navjote can be interpreted this way. It surely implies a form of cultural action. Furthermore, in the first step, the natural world is left behind as of no value: the 'other' world only is regarded valuable. In the second step, this 'other' world is not left behind; the 'natural' world is conquered by it. Those who have gone this path 'really' belong to the 'other' world, and remain part of it, hence their authority over this one.64 Navjote can also be interpreted this way. In Zoroastrianism too, the initiated have au-thority over this world. Finally, in the first step, the temporary, unstable, natural world is left behind, in order to share in the permanent, eternal, transcendental world. In the second step, this status of immortality is retained, and allows from now on the moving back and forth between the two worlds (for example in the case of priests, who can move into the transcendental world and come back again), until even after death (the spirits of the dead periodi-61 Bloch, Prey into Hunter, pp. 16 f. 62 The abstract formulation of the theory in its shortest form is in Bloch, Prey into Hunter, chapter 1: \"Introduction\", esp. pp. 5-6.

Bloch compares his model with that of van Gennep,66 pointing out the following differences.67 According to van Gennep, the pre-liminal phase of the ritual sepa-rates the individual candidates from their society, whereas Bloch sees it as a separation between the vital and the transcendental self of the indi-vidual candidate(s), which transfers the whole society into the 'other' world.68 Ervad Karanjia wrote: The Nahan, if it can be called the pre-liminal stage of the ritual, does sepa-rate the candidate from the profane world by ritually cleansing him. This is in preparation to the divine blessings he is to receive from the 'other world'. This statement seems to confirm van Gennep's theory, rather than Bloch's. However, Dastur Kotwal remarked: Both Gennep and Bloch seem to be on the right track. The pre-liminal stage of the ritual separates the individual candidate from its society as far as pu-rity is concerned. It also separates the physical from not easily understand-able spiritual experience and transfers the devout members of the society into the 'other' world. It is interesting to see that Dastur Kotwal feels that this part of Bloch's theory might be recognized in the Navjote ritual. As a non-Zoroastrian scholar, I find it difficult to recognize here Bloch's model of the killing of the vitality of the candidate in order to release his spiritual side, and Dastur Kotwal himself also wrote to me that: \"There is no violence of any sort one can perceive in the pre-liminal... phase of the [Navjote] ini-tiation ritual.\" Van Gennep regards the condition of the candidates during the limi-nal phase as a passing condition. Bloch, on the contrary, sees it as the 65 Bloch, Prey into Hunter, pp. 20 f. 66 Bloch, Prey into Hunter, p. 6. Houseman/Severi regard Bloch's model even a \"di-rect transform\" of van Gennep's (Naven or the Other Self, p. 175). 67 These were again skipped during the presentation of this paper, because of lack of time, and here too, Dastur Kotwal and Ervad Karanjia were so kind as to send me their reactions by e-mail later. 68 Bloch, Prey into Hunter, p. 6."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"period during which one gains one's permanent (i.e. eternal) transcen-dental identity.69 This does apply to Navjote. Van Gennep sees the post-liminal phase as a reintegration into soci-ety. According to Bloch, however, it is not a return to the old world left behind, but its aggressive conquest resulting in a new world.70 Dastur Kotwal wrote: Van Gennep seems right when he states that the post-liminal phase brings the candidate to the mainstream of the devout, initiated society. The Navjote is the child's second or spiritual birth, whereas Ervad Karanjia wrote: In the case of Navjote, the view of Bloch seems to be more tenable, as the child does not return to the old world (wherein he was uninitiated) but to a new world, with special tools (Sudreh & Kushti) as his imple-ments to foster goodness and fight against evil. I think, however, that there is one problem here: in Bloch's view, the new world is created out of the old world by the aggressive conquest of the old world through the participants in the ritual. Now I could see this aspect in Navjote (see below), and Karanjia's statement that the child returns \"with special tools (,Sudreh & Kushti) as his implements to ... fight against evil\" indicates the direction in which I am thinking, but this is clearly different from a being (passively) passed into a different world. Finally, van Gennep sees violence only in the pre-liminal phase of initiation rituals, whereas in the view of Bloch, the violence in the post-liminal phase is much more important: - it is directed towards other species (usually animals);71 - it may flow over to other human groups, resulting in conquering wars, which makes these rituals of political significance;72 - it is the result of the attempt to create the transcendental.73 Dastur Kotwal responded: There is no violence of any sort one can perceive in the pre-liminal or post-liminal phase of the [Navjote] initiation ritual. The candidate rather declares in the articles of faith that his religion believes in setting aside 69 Bloch, Prey into Hunter, p. 6. 70 Bloch, Prey into Hunter, p. 6. 71 Bloch, Prey into Hunter, p. 6. 72 Bloch, Prey into Hunter, p. 6. 73 Bloch, Prey into Hunter, p. 7."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"quarrels, is peaceable and teaches us to live in harmony with our kith and kin. And Ervad Karanjia wrote: The third option, that of an 'attempt to create the transcendental' is more plausible for Navjote as the initiation and the word Nav jot itself signifies a new offerer of prayers to the transcendental beings. However, I am not sure that the responses by Dastur Kotwal and Ervad Karanjia to the last two points do justice to either Bloch or Navjote. For what I understand of the Navjote ritual, it does not only demand from the newly initiated to behave peacefully towards his/her fellow men and to offer prayers to the transcendental beings, but also to actively fight the powers of evil. Zoroastrianism even explicitly demands to do so in the form of killing certain animals (the xrafstra).74 This aspect would be much more in line with what I understand Bloch to refer to. What Bloch is referring to explicitly, however, (as stated above) is the practice of having a meal after an initiation ritual (and many other rituals). Van Gennep interprets this as what we would today call a performative act, announcing as well as creating the group which now for the first time includes the newly initiated in his/her new status. For Bloch, however, this is the group, returned—after its journey through the realm of the transcendental— into the world of natural (biological) vitality, absorbing the vitality of the animals and plants killed for the meal. As to Navjote: there is usually a festive meal after the ritual (which Bloch would regard part of the ritual), and the \"showering\" of the candidate(s) with rice etc. at the end of the ritual could well be interpreted as stressing their fecun-dity, thus: their biological vitality. Surely, this would make these ele-ments of the Navjote much more important than their traditional interpre-tation would suggest. Modi just mentions them, but does not regard them worth while commenting on. Yet, they are there, and, as I am told by Michael Stausberg, most participants—especially those who do not be-long to the close kin of the candidate(s)—only arrive when the meal starts.75 So, that seems to be regarded significant by the participants. 74 See Stausberg, Die Religion Zarathushtras, vol. 1, p. 139. 75 See also Clark, Zoroastrianism, p. 108."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS, AND PERSPECTIVES We may summarize the measure to which Navjote as described by Modi fits the four theories presented as follows: - Navjote fits van Gennep's theory. - It also fits Eliade's definition, but not all the characteristics from his summary. That, however, does not disqualify Navjote as an initiation sensu Eliade, nor does it disqualify Eliade's theory, which, I think, does fit most initiation rituals. - It also fits the obligatory characteristics of my definition, as well as some, though not all, of the non-obligatory characteristics. - It can also be interpreted in Bloch's way. Especially in this case, this leads to looking in a completely new way at Navjote, which is precisely what makes the existence of so many new ritual theories so interesting. It follows, then, that Navjote fits the criteria, formulated in the defini-tions of Eliade and Snoek sufficiently well, so that it may properly be called an initiation ritual in this sense. Furthermore, we have seen how different theories shape the percep-tion of the Navjote ritual. For example, although, when looked at from the perspectives of Eliade or Snoek, Navjote shows itself as an initiation ritual, Bloch's theory makes us perceive it as a ritual of the \"rebounding violence\" type. Also, the different theories helped us to see aspects of Navjote, which for example Modi did not describe explicitly. This demonstrates how his perception was restricted by the (implicit) theory which he had in mind when making his description, as well as how different theories comple-ment each other in highlighting different aspects of the same ritual. In our case it were especially the theoriés of Eliade and Bloch which made us look in new ways at the Navjote ritual, and see aspects in it which are not usually included in its description. Finally, the approach presented opens new perspectives, which have not been followed up here. For example, one could analyze different de-scriptions of the same ritual, in order to attempt to reconstruct the theo-retical approaches behind them. I hope that it will also be perceived as sufficiently worthwhile to stimulate others to apply it to other rituals. At least, I am convinced to have shown that scholars of Zoroastrianism may benefit from knowledge of ritual theories."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"META-THEORETICAL PARAMETERS FOR THE ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON OF TWO RECENT APPROACHES TO THE STUDY OF THE YASNA Jens Kreinath The Yasna can be regarded as the Zoroastrian temple ritual par excel-lence. 'Yasna' is used as a term for the text recited during the perform-ance of the ritual as well as for the ritual itself. This ritual has been re-ferred to as a 'high liturgy'.1 In India, it is daily celebrated by two priests in a special section of major Zoroastrian temples. Although the ritual performance is only accessible to Zoroastrians, no other ritual of the Zo-roastrian tradition has drawn so much attention from linguists, philo-logists, and historians of religion.2 As the history of scholarly research shows, the Western knowledge of the Yasna was primarily based on the available textual sources.3 They were mainly studied philologically, lin-guistically, or comparatively. Just a few scholars interpreted not only the text but also tried to describe the ritual performance itself.4 The scholarly knowledge of the Yasna performance was for the most part based on the descriptions and explanations given by Zoroastrian priests or sometimes on the observation of rehearsals at priestly schools or staged presenta-tions in unconsecrated temples.5 However, Western scholars could not 1 F.M.

The visual materials available to non-Zoro-astrians concerning the practice of the Yasna ritual were confined to some sketches, drawings, or photos, for instance, of the priests, the in-struments for the ritual performance, or the arrangement of the ritual space.6 In scholarly work, these visual media were mainly used to illus-trate primarily text-based descriptions or reconstructions of the Yasna. The visual representation of the ritual performance gained a new quality when, in 1982, James W. Boyd and William R. Darrow produced a videotape of a staged performance of the Yasna, enacted by an Indian high priest (Dastur Firoze M. Kotwal) and his assistant (Ervad Noshir C. Hormuzdiar), in a film studio at Harvard University.7 Since this visual material became accessible, it has been possible to study more closely the actions and recitations, as well as the postures and gestures involved in this ritual. In that way, the scholarly research of the Yasna ritual has received a broader empirical basis. Moreover, based on this videotape, the American scholars William R. Darrow and James W. Boyd (the latter in collaboration with Ron G. Williams) presented two new theoretical approaches to the study of the Yasna.8 Darrow employed a semiotic ap-proach for his analysis of the Yasna as a 'dramatic unity', whereas Wil-liams/Boyd developed an aesthetic approach for the interpretation of the Yasna, using 'artistic masterpiece' as their key concept. When one com-pares these approaches, one finds some surprising peculiarities. Al-though the authors analyzed the same visual material, their approaches are mutually exclusive. Moreover, although they used similar concepts for the construction of their approaches, they addressed different con-texts of the scholarly study of ritual performances. Starting from these observations, this paper addresses a more general problem, namely: How can the differences between these theoretical ap-proaches be explained? For this purpose, another, higher level of ab-straction is required, one that goes beyond the historical reconstruction 6 See Darmesteter, Le Zend-Avesta·, Modi, The Religious Ceremonies, p. 225; Drower, Water into Wine, pp. 203, 206. 7 J.W.

On this new level, one should be able to correlate significant historical and theoretical compo-nents and also to provide tools for an analysis of the more general issues implied. In short, it is necessary to compare theoretical approaches at a meta-theoretical level. COMPARING THEORETICAL APPROACHES What is meant by a 'comparison at a meta-theoretical level'? At such a level, the theoretical approaches themselves become the object of critical scrutiny.9 This requires that one analyzes these approaches in such a way that one can specify those components on which they are built and which obviously shape them. Moreover, a meta-theoretical analysis not only looks at how such approaches work and how they are constructed, but also at how they are situated in and applied to a particular field of re-search.10 In particular, one has to analyze the procedures they employ, the rules they follow, and the strategies they pursue. To compare the approaches here under consideration at such a level, three meta-theoretical parame-ters are addressed: First, the question of methodology, that is, how theo-retical approaches select and analyze the field of empirical data under scrutiny by applying various methods of scholarly research and how they are confined to the methods they apply for that purpose.\" Second, the 9 As indicated above, in what follows it is not the aim to re-study the theoretical ap-proaches of Darrow and Williams/Boyd or to improve their interpretation ofthe Yasna. The aim of my meta-theoretical analysis and comparison is concerned with the way these approaches are constructed. For this reason, I focus my argument on those issues of a particular scholarly discourse that bear upon the logic by which these approaches are designed. 10 Here, I follow the point Dan Sperber has made in his meta-theoretical critique of Claude Lévi-Strauss's structural theory of symbolism. He concludes his Rethinking Symbolism by stating that a meta-theoretical analysis has \"to define the framework within which a theory of symbolism may be constructed\", D. Sperber, Rethinking Sym-bolism (Cambridge Studies in Social Anthropology 153; Cambridge et al., 1975), p. 148. However, \"[t]he aim of a metatheory is to make it both possible and necessary to go beyond it\", Sperber, Rethinking Symbolism, p. 148. 11 Here, I argue along the lines of E. Thomas Lawson & Robert N. McCauley, al-though their view on methodology is largely restricted to questions concerning the Neo-Kantian distinctions between interpretation and explanation, see E.Th. Lawson/R.N. McCauley, Rethinking Religion. Connecting Cognition and Culture (Cambridge/New York, 1990), pp. 12-31. I prefer a broader view on methodology that includes all the"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"question of the logic of design, that is, how theoretical approaches con-figure a particular architecture of analytical concepts by following the rules of an underlying pattern of basic assumptions and guiding princi-ples and how the use of these concepts is restricted by these rules.12 Third, the question of discourse, that is, how theoretical approaches ad-dress various issues of scholarly research by pursuing strategies for op-erationalizing particular methods and concepts to this end and how these strategies are conditioned by the established standards and paradigms of the particular discursive contexts of scholarly research.13 By focusing on these meta-theoretical parameters, a comparison of theoretical approaches exposes the 'analytical concepts', 'empirical data', and 'discursive contexts' that give rise to their construction and can ex-plain the necessary differences between them. Moreover, such a com-parison enables a meta-theoretical critique of the basic assumptions and guiding principles of how theoretical approaches are discursively con-structed. In what follows the guiding intention is to demonstrate how the use of specific methods and concepts for the construction of theoretical approaches is embedded in particular contexts of scholarly discourse.14 rules that are used for the elaboration of methods within almost every field of scholarly research. Methodology, in my view, also includes such procedures as data gathering, description, and analysis. 12 The notion of the 'logic of design' derives from Don Handelman, who introduced this concept for his theory of'public events', see D. Handelman, Models and Mirrors. Towards an Anthropology of Public Events (New York/Oxford, 1998), pp. 1-81. The use of this notion is meant to indicate that theoretical approaches can be analyzed and compared on a level that goes beyond the logic of their internal relations. This is what I refer to as a 'meta-theoretical' level. Thus, like Handelman, I argue that different 'logics of design' in the construction of theoretical approaches index or indicate discursive contexts that themselves are organized in a radically different way, see Handelman, Models and Mirrors, p. 7. 13 Here, I agree with Catherine Bell's position, namely that the \"critical analysis of a theoretical perspective must look not only to the logic of the set of ideas under scrutiny, but also to the history of their construction,\" C. Bell, Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice (New York/Oxford, 1992), p. 5. Although I prefer the terms 'approach' and 'concepts' instead of'perspective' and 'ideas', I agree with Bell that the history of discourse has to be taken into account as a history of construction, see C. Bell, \"Discourse and Dichoto-mies. The Structure of Ritual Theory\", Religion 17, 1987, pp. 95-118; Bell, Ritual The-ory, Ritual Practice, pp. 13-66. See also the history of scholarly research on ritual in C. Bell Ritual. Perspectives and Dimensions (New York/Oxford, 1997), pp. 1-89. 14 As Bell has pointed out, theoretical approaches use methods and concepts as 'lenses' or 'windows' to be looked through, see Bell, Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice, p. 3; within the frame of my meta-theoretical analysis, I aim to look at these methods and concepts and how they are embedded. In other words, I take the frame of these theoretical 'lenses' or"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Heuristic Tools for a Meta-Theoretical Comparison The present analysis works within the parameters of postmodem episte-mology as outlined above. Based on this framework, a matrix is devel-oped for the meta-theoretical comparison of the complex and interde-pendent relationships between the various components involved. The terms 'theoretical approaches', 'analytical concepts', 'empirical data', and 'discursive contexts', which will be introduced in this section, help to identify and explain the differences between the semiotic and aesthetic approaches to the study of the Yasna. Theoretical Approaches Approaches to a particular field of scholarly research are theoretical in-sofar as they define the procedures of their research by using theories as the general frame of their argument. A 'theory' is a set of propositions and hypotheses that are stated in an operational form and are applicable to every empirical datum within the particular field of research for which these propositions and hypotheses are held to be valid. In contrast to theories, theoretical approaches use a variety of concepts and methods derived from theoretical propositions and hypotheses in order to organize a particular field of research and to focus on theoretical issues related to the empirical data under scrutiny. Such approaches presuppose a set of logically interrelated proposi-tions and hypotheses. Moreover, they provide particular procedures in order to operationalize this set of propositions and hypotheses in relation to the empirical data and theoretical issues under consideration. Whereas theories can be regarded as explicitly formulated sets of propositions and hypotheses that are applicable to a wide range of empirical data, theo-retical approaches, by contrast, are concerned with a particular field of research; for this purpose, they operationalize relevant theories as their general frame of reference for their argument while addressing specific theoretical issues related to the respective empirical data. Only those ap-proaches to the study of a particular field of research, which rely primar-'windows' into account in order to analyze how they frame and how they focus on the issues under scrutiny in those approaches.

For instance, semiotics, performance theories, and cognitive theories, each with its own general sets of propositions and hypotheses, can be regarded as frames for the construction of a variety of theoretical ap-proaches to the study of rituals. One usually refers to these approaches as 'semiotic', 'performance', or 'cognitive' approaches insofar their 'logic of design' and their operational procedures follow the basic assumptions and guiding principles of semiotics, performance theories, or cognitive theories, respectively. The ways in which theoretical approaches apply or follow such theories as their main frame of reference may differ in a way similar to how these theories themselves differ. Since there is not just one theory of semiotics, for example, the frames of reference among se-miotic approaches to the study of rituals may differ.15 This is valid also for performance approaches,16 as well as for cognitive approaches,17 to the field of ritual studies.

Furthermore, such concepts are the necessary constituents for the construction of theoretical approaches. As operationalized tools, these concepts are also crucial for the analysis of empirical data. More-over, analytical concepts are capable of particularizing or extracting those elements which are constitutive of such integrated unities as a 'field of research', a 'theoretical issue', or an 'empirical datum'. For instance, semiotic approaches often use concepts such as 'syn-tax', 'semantics', or 'pragmatics',18 'signifier' and 'signified',19 or 'in-dex', 'icon', 'signal', 'sign', and 'symbol',20 depending on the semiotic 18 M.

By contrast, F. Staal, \"The Meaninglessness of Ritual\", Numen 26,1979, pp. 2-22, uses the concept of'syntax' to argue for the meaninglessness of ritual, see pp. 9-11, 19-21, whereas H.H. Penner, \"Language, Ritual, and Meaning\", Numen 32, 1985, pp. 1-16, uses the concept of'semantics' taken from linguistics and the philosophy of language to place the assertion of the meaninglessness of rituals in doubt, see pp. 3-4. C. Severi, \"Talking About Souls. On the Pragmatic Construction of Meaning in Cuna Ritual Lan-guage\", Cognitive Aspects of Religious Symbolism, ed. P. Boyer (Cambridge, 1993), pp. 165-181, takes yet another stance, using instead a contextual concept of'pragmatics' for his analysis of the construction of meaning in ritual language, see pp. 165-166. 19 Bloch, e.g., questions the usefulness of the concepts of'signifier' and 'signified', which were introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure and were first applied by Victor W. Turner to the study of ritual, see Bloch, \"Symbols, Song, Dance and Features of Articu-lation\", p. 55. However, Penner works with versions of these concepts that were elabo-rated by Roman Jakobson. Within this framework, he argues that rituals have a semantic dimension and can be regarded as meaningful, see Penner, \"Language, Ritual, and Meaning\", pp. 9-10. Reference should also be made to Barbara A. Babcock, who uses the concepts 'signifier' and 'signified' to specify the different modes of signification 'one to one', 'one to many', 'many to one', and 'many to many', see B.A. Babcock, \"Too Many, Too Few. Ritual Modes of Signification\", Semiotica 23, 1978, pp. 291 — 302, p. 294. 20 Leach, e.g., constructs his structural-semiotic approach on the basis of clear-cut distinctions between these five concepts, see Leach, Culture and Communication, pp. 9-16. By contrast, C. Geertz, \"Religion as a Cultural System,\" Anthropological Ap-proaches to the Study of Religion, ed. M. Banton (London, 1966), pp. 1-46, exclusively uses the concept 'symbol'. Although Geertz refers to different notions of the concept of 'symbol' as it is introduced into semiotics by Charles S. Peirce (e.g., \"for anything which signifies something else to someone,\" \"for explicitly conventional signs of one sort or another\"), or in literary theory by Burke (e.g., \"confined to something which expresses in an oblique and figurative manner that which cannot be stated in a direct and literal one\"), Geertz explicitly follows Susanne Κ.

Although both approaches use the concept of'symbol' for the purpose of analyzing the empirical data within their particular fields of research, their use differs according to the argument they formulate and the theoretical approach they apply and construct."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Empirical Data Theoretical approaches as well as analytical concepts refer to empirical data, but they differ in their particular mode of reference. Analytical concepts are used to explore the field of empirical data, whereas theo-retical approaches use these data as arguments for operationalized propo-sitions and hypotheses. Therefore, analytical concepts highlight certain aspects of the empirical data that are relevant for the construction of theoretical approaches. Regarding the empirical data, the question of methodology comes into focus. To explore these data, the methods of scholarly research pre-suppose a set of analytical concepts in order to select, analyze, and struc-ture the empirical data under consideration. The use of these concepts for the analysis of empirical data uncovers the inherent dialectic of the relationship between concepts and data. The analytical concepts open up the field of possible data and at the same time delimit it by the categori-cal distinctions they make. By contrast, not every analytical concept can be applied to all kinds of empirical data. Therefore, the concepts in use have to be applicable to the respective field of research. To be applica-ble, the concepts in use have to be as precise as possible: they are usable in proportion to their degree of precision.30 Depending on their preci-30 This already starts with the definition of'ritual' as the key concept for the field of research. According to Kapferer, it would be inappropriate to press particular concepts for an over-arching definition of ritual as, in his view, Rappaport has done: \"Too often anthropologists become enmeshed in their definitions, so much so that a particular defi-nition can take on a life of its own and become what it seeks to comprehend,\" Kapferer, A Celebration of Demons, p. 3 f. He continues: \"Rappaport ( 1979) discovers the 'litur-gical order' of ritual, its formality and invariance, to be its principal and 'obvious' char-acteristic. It is in the liturgical order of ritual that Rappaport extends an understanding of other obvious aspects of ritual (the communicative, expressive, informational, per-formative, sacred or 'holy' aspects of ritual, and so on). His approach is undeniably productive of insight into the ritual process, but with his 'over-definitional' orientation to cultural phenomena, Rappaport seems to me to have neglected what is perhaps the most obvious aspect of ritual. Regardless of how one defines the cultural phenomena of ritual, ritual is a social practice where ideas are produced in a determinant and dominant relation to action, and it is a practice where action is continually structured to the idea,\" Kapferer, A Celebration of Demons, p. 4. Thus, although over-generalized concepts might explain anything, they are useless for any analytical purpose. Moreover, one can argue that particular theoretical issues have to be approached with appropriate analytical concepts. For instance, see also D. Handelman, \"Re-Framing Ritual\", The Dynamics of Changing Rituals. The Transformation of Religious Rituals within their Social and Cultural Religion, eds. J. Kreinath/C. Hartung/A. Deschner (Toronto Studies in Relig-"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"sion, concepts enable a distinct perspective on empirical data, but the perspective that these concepts open up is again determined by their conceptual frame and focus.31 In this regard, analytical concepts function as 'lenses' or 'windows'. They are limited to a particular perspective by which they approach their particular field of empirical data. This particular perspective on the empirical data depends also on the 32 respective theoretical approaches, of which the concepts are a part. In ion; New York, forthcoming), argues that the dynamics of changing rituals cannot prop-erly be approached through the meta-communicative concept of'lineal framing' as in-troduced by Bateson, for this model presents the relationship between frame and content as organized in a hierarchical way. He suggests that the concept of'brading' of a 'moe-bius strip' would be more appropriate. Viewing the ritual frame as 'moebius'-like, he emphasizes: \"The frame is simultaneously inside and outside, appearing and disappear-ing from view, always in movement, always becoming. There is no clear-cut distinction between that which is inside and that which is outside.\" 31 Although Lawson/McCauley as well as D. Hymes, e.g., dwell on the same analytic distinction between 'performance' and 'competence' as employed by Noam Chomsky, their specification of empirical data is determined by the concepts they each prefer. D. Hymes, \"Breakthrough into Performance\", Folklore. Performance and Communication, eds D. Ben-Amos/K.S. Goldstein (The Hague/Paris, 1975), pp. 11-74, esp. 13-15, al-most exclusively focuses on ritual 'performance', whereas Lawson/McCauley, Rethink-ing Religion, pp. 65-68, restrict their argument to ritual 'competence' while excluding almost every aspect of ritual 'performance'. 32 As indicated above, Geertz interprets religion as a 'cultural system' or as a 'system of symbols' and uses as analytical concepts 'model of and 'model for' in order to dis-tinguish between the different systems of symbols or 'modes of seeing', see Geertz, \"Religion as a Cultural System\", pp. 7-8, 26. Furthermore, he uses the concepts of 'ethos' and 'world-view' to distinguish between the 'world as lived' and the 'world as imagined'. Based on this distinction, he argues that \"under the agency of a single set of symbolic forms\" any religious ritual generates a \"fusion of ethos and world-view\", Geertz, \"Religion as a Cultural System\", p. 28. Proposing the concept of'cultural per-formances', he states further that they \"represent not only the point at which the disposi-tional and conceptual aspects of religious life converge to the believer, but also the point at which the interaction between them can be most readily examined by the ob-server,\" Geertz, \"Religion as a Cultural System\", p. 29. Catherine Bell has shown that Geertz here presupposes a dichotomy between thought and action, which he aims to overcome by fusing them via religious rituals. Moreover, she exposes an \"implicit struc-tural homology\" in his argument between \"the fusion of thought and action\" and \"the fusion of the theoretical project and its object, ritual activity\", Bell, Ritual Theory, Rit-ual Practice, p. 28. Thus, she concludes, \"a cultural focus on ritual activity renders the rite a veritable window on the most important processes of cultural life,\" Bell, Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice, p. 28, emphasis J.K. It is precisely the 'window' of his analyti-cal concepts through which Geertz looks at his empirical data from the perspective of his theoretical approach."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"other words, their use also depends on the relevance of the empirical data to these approaches.33 Therefore, the theoretical approaches have an effect on the use of analytical concepts and the process of data gathering, as well as on such procedures as describing, analyzing, interpreting, or explaining the empirical data under scrutiny.34 Because the description, interpretation, and explanation of empirical data by means of analytical concepts depend on the respective approaches, the use of concepts can be regarded as theory-laden. Moreover, not only the description, inter-pretation, or explanation of empirical data is theory-laden, but also the entire processes of data gathering.35 Thus, the methods of scholarly re-search are mutually related to the construction of theoretical approaches as well as to the respective use of analytical concepts. If this is right, the question arises as to whether the empirical data are constructed in the same way as are the respective theoretical approaches, that is, discur-sively. 33 According to Handelman, \"Is Naven Ludic? Paradox and the Communication of Iden-tity\", Social Analysis 1, 1979, pp. 177-191, it would be inappropriate to describe the Naven ceremony of the Iatmul of Papua New Guinea exclusively with the concepts of 'rit-ual' or 'play' as Gregory Bateson has preferred to do, see his Naven. A Survey of the Prob-lems suggested by a Composite Picture ofthe Culture ofa New Guinea Tribe drawn from Three Points of View (Stanford/CA, 1958). As Handelman argues, Naven is more appro-priately described as a 'carnival' or 'masquerade' within which the insoluble paradoxes of everyday life are communicated as a meta-communicative message, see Handelman, \"Is Naven Ludic?\", pp. 187-190. In contrast to Handelman and Bateson, M. Houseman & C. Severi argue that the Naven ceremony cannot be adequately understood with such concepts as 'meta-communicative message' or 'paradox'. Instead, they favor such concepts as 'rela-tionality' and 'ritual behavior' in order to analyze the respective empirical data, see Naven or the Other Self. A Relational Approach to Ritual Action, transi. M. Fineberg (Studies in the History of Religions 79; Leiden, 1998), pp. 31-38. 34 See, e.g., the different theoretical approaches to the study of the Naven ceremony by Bateson, Handelman, and Houseman/Severi. They improved the analytic comprehension and interpretation of this ceremony, making existing theories of play and ritual more ex-plicit by introducing new theoretical approaches. In a similar vein, see also Jan Snoek's methodological reflections on the value of theories for the description of rituals in this volume. He argues that the conscious use of theories improves first and foremost the ana-lytical strength of descriptions of rituals, e.g., Zoroastrian 'initiation' ceremonies. 35 Lawson/McCauley not only argue that theories guide the interpretation of empiri-cal data, but also that no empirical datum is self-interpreting: \"All data-gathering is theoretically inspired. The crucial issue is how aware of their theories data-gatherers are\", Lawson/McCauley, Rethinking Religion, p. 10."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Discursive Contexts Theoretical approaches address distinct discursive contexts due to the methodology and logic of design they follow. Contexts of scholarly re-search are discursive contexts when they were shaped by and subse-quently shape the construction of theoretical approaches, the use of ana-lytical concepts, and the selection of empirical data.36 Approaches, con-cepts, and data are established by and are constantly subject to the criti-cal appraisal and assessment of the scholarly discourse. They are evalu-ated and negotiated with regard to discursively established standards and principles of scholarly research. This means that theoretical approaches address various theoretical issues of scholarly research that are raised within the discourse and were established by the standards of scholarly research. Moreover, at the same time the approaches are shaped by those issues which they address as their discursive context. 'Discourse' refers to those strategic and argumentative modes of scholarly communication and research that are concerned with the theo-retical issues under consideration. Paradoxically, discourses are re-stricted and delimited by the discursively established standards and paradigms of scholarly research.37 This implies that the modes in which scholars participate in this process of communication and research are shaped and restricted by the discourse itself. In addition, the mode of participating in a discourse is determined by the modalities of discourse 36 The term 'discursive contexts' implies that a number of scholars share a common interest in a distinct field of research, although their methods, concepts, or approaches may overlap or mutually exclude each other. It also implies that a variety of institutions, networks, or schools of research are part of these contexts, which intersect in some re-spects while being mutually exclusive in others. According to Diane Macdonell dis-course \"differ with the kinds of institutions and social practices in which they take shape, and with the positions of those who speak and whom they address.

She maintains, \"any dicourse concern itself with certain objects and puts forward certain concepts at the expense of others. ... Different discourses elaborate different concepts and categories\", Macdonell, Theories of Discourse, p. 3. 37 Here, I apply the concept of'discourse' developed by M. Foucault, L'ordre du dis-cours (Paris, 1972). As Tim Murphy has pointed out that Michel Foucault can be re-garded as \"one of the first theorists to argue that discourses, including scientific dis-courses, do not mimetically re-present their objects. Rather, the objects of scientific analysis and inquiry are products of discourse\", T. Murphy, \"Discourse\", Guide to the Study of Religion, eds W. Braun/R.T.

Therefore, the discourse enables and restricts the construction of theoretical approaches, launches the use of analytical concepts, and determines the selection of empirical data. Because 'dis-course' presupposes a discursively established frame of standards and paradigms for the reciprocal communication and enforces a specific fo-cus on themes and issues for scholarly research, it is defined here as a mode of a scholarly coded practice of communication and research that constructs its own frame and focus.39 Moreover, it is the discourse that determines the acceptance and reso-nance of the results of scholarly research, the enforcement or suppression of methodologies, the usefulness and adequacy of analytical concepts, or the validity and plausibility of theoretical approaches. For this reason, a discourse leads to the selection of theoretical issues and empirical data, as well as to the elaboration of particular methods and concepts that are supposed to be relevant for particular discursive contexts and subsequent research projects. As a result, the frame established by these contexts directs the process of empirical data gathering, the use of analytical con-cepts, and the construction of theoretical approaches.40 Thus, a discourse generates its own field of research and produces its own body of knowl-edge. It establishes a particular set of concepts and methods that select 38 The discourse analysis describes these modes of scholarly discourse. Here I follow G. Nigel Gilbert & Michael Mulkay who argue that discourse analysis \"is an attempt to identify and describe regularities in the methods used by participants as they construct the discourse through which they establish the character of their actions and beliefs in the course of interaction\", G.N. Gilbert/M. Mulkay, Opening Pandora's Box. A Socio-logical Analysis of Scientists' Discourse (Cambridge, 1984), p. 14. 39 See Murphy, \"Discourse\", p. 400. 40 For example, since ritual studies are an established interdisciplinary field of re-search, 'ritual' is constructed as a mode of human action sui generis. In this regard, Ronald Grimes claimed for this field of research that one can study ritual in its own right, see R. Grimes, Beginnings in Ritual Studies (Lanham, 1982); R. Grimes, Re-search in Ritual Studies. A Programmatic Essay and Bibliography (Atla Bibliographic Series 14; Metuchen/London, 1985); R. Grimes, \"Ritual Studies\", The Encyclopedia of Religion, ed. M.

For this reason, these approaches can be identified by their specific use of concepts, which points to the particular discourses in which they take part. Therefore, it proves to be a rule that the use of analytical concepts differs between various theoretical approaches because they belong to different discur-sive contexts. As a consequence, they select and organize their empirical data differently.

This enables a comparison of their use of analytical concepts as 'lenses' and 'windows' through which they ap-41 Because of their frame and focus, the methods and concepts in the research on ritu-als determine the way in which the empirical data are organized, so that 'ritual' can be considered, e.g., as a 'system of symbols', 'set of signs', or as a 'work of art' that has to be studied using symbol theories, semiotics, or aesthetics, respectively, see Geertz, \"Re-ligion as a Cultural System,\" 4-8; Leach, Culture and Communication, pp. 33-45; Kapferer, A Celebration of Demons, pp. 7 f., 181 f., 207-210. 42 Because of the discursive contexts and the theoretical issues under scrutiny, the at-tention of scholarly research focuses on specific aspects of the empirical data while ne-glecting others. In recent research the focus has been on the performance of rituals or the competence to perform them, rather than on the syntax or semantics of a ritual 'script' or 'text' designed for the ritual performance, see Kapferer, A Celebration of Demons, pp. 4-8; R.

In comparing their specific use of concepts, the aim here is to outline the differences be-tween these approaches with regard to the discursive contexts they ad-dress. In terms of methodology, such issues as how these approaches se-lect the empirical data, how they focus on their particular field of re-search, and what methods they use are addressed in order to analyze the data under consideration. In terms of the logic of design, some of the assumptions and principles on which these approaches are built are em-ployed concentrating on the analytical concepts they use and the cate-gorical distinctions they make. With regard to discourse, the question is how the theoretical approaches and their uses of concepts and methods are embedded in particular discursive contexts. Moreover, the particular modalities of discourse are introduced within which these approaches are constructed and focus on how they strategically address the theoretical issues with which they are concerned. The Various Frames of Empirical Data With their theoretical approaches, Darrow and Williams/Boyd address the 'performance of ritual actions' enacted by the two priests during the Yasna. As mentioned above, the empirical basis of these approaches is the videotape of one performance. The way in which this film presents the ritual performance already indicates how the empirical data are se-lected and organized and how these different approaches focus particu-larly on those theoretical issues in the field of ritual studies, which suit the concepts for the analysis of the visual material. Moreover, the em-phasis they place on the sequences of actions or on the use of gestures in the ritual performance not only reflects the particular design of the videotape but also pre-figures the construction of their approaches. The film, entitled Λ Zoroastrian Ritual. The Yasna,43 is recorded as a documentation of a performance of ritual action.44 In the first sequence, 43 The film J.W.

Then the video shows the high priest Dastur Firoze M. Kotwal48 sit-ting in front of the camera dressed in white priestly robes.49 In a distinct voice, Kotwal describes what rituals mean for him and how he is com-mitted to celebrating the liturgy of the Yasna devotionally.50 He argues that one can tell from the priest's face whether he is performing the Yasna devotionally or not.51 After this interpretation of the significance would argue that this film is clearly a stage production. It is the documentation of a staged performance in a film studio that differs, e.g., from the documentation of a ritual performance in a Zoroastrian fire-temple in terms of its audience, setting, availability, design, and sponsorship. 45 Darrow/Boyd, The Yasna, min. 1:17-1:44. 46 Darrow/Boyd, The Yasna, min. 1:45.

If this tape was produced for the classroom at colleges or universities, it is likely that the perform-ance of the ritual had to meet the requirements of a film production rather than the other way around in order to fulfill the didactic demands at the university. 47 Darrow/Boyd, The Yasna, min. 1:46-1:57. 48 Firoze M. Kotwal is a well-known Zoroastrian high priest who worked until his re-tirement at one of the four major fire-temples in Bombay. He received his scholarly training under Mary Boyce at the University of London, and his philological research is one of the most important sources for the historical study of Zoroastrian rituals. Due to his ritual competence and his scholarly training, Kotwal was an important figure for Darrow and Boyd, who began to study the Yasna under his guidance. Moreover, he gave them permission to videotape him performing several sequences of the Yasna, which could otherwise not have been studied. Nevertheless, for the recorded perform-ance he neither presented the whole Yasna before a non-Zoroastrian audience nor per-formed the Yasna at a consecrated fire-temple. Later on, Kotwal not only worked together with Boyd—again, they wrote a book together on the Yasna in which they describe this ritual as a 'high liturgy', see Kotwal/Boyd, A Persian Offering—but also served as the key informant for the theoretical approaches employed by Darrow, \"Keeping the Waters Dry\", p. 421 and Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, pp. xin-xv, 1 f. 49 Darrow/Boyd, The Yasna, min. 1:58-4:22. 50 Darrow/Boyd, The Yasna, min. 2:15-4:22. 51 Darrow/Boyd, The Yasna, min. 3:55-4:22.

As the narrator continues, when the high priest enters the ritual place, the Yasna proper begins.53 Subsequently, the video shows for about 24 minutes a selection of several sequences of the Yasna54 in which ritual actions are performed by Kotwal as the chief priest at the ritual table and by Hormuzdiar as his assistant at the fire vase.55 The whole film lasts approximately one-half hour.56 Although the film does not show a complete performance of the Yasna,57 it follows the order of the ritual actions. Moreover, the re-cording of the ritual performance is organized by the particular se-quences of ritual actions. Thus, the order of the film does not depend upon or refer to the chapters of the Yasna text, but strictly follows the sequential order of the ritual actions.58 Therefore, the organizing princi-ple of this film is the sequential order of ritual actions. Most of the se-quences in which the chief priest recites the liturgical text without per-forming ritual actions are left out. The film focuses primarily on those actions in detail in which ritual gestures are held to be significant for the performance of the Yasna. In other words, it shows those parts of the Yasna which the filmmakers, Boyd/Darrow, regarded as relevant for the study of the ritual performance. Recorded in a film studio at the Video Production Center of Harvard University, even the cinematic setting for this ritual performance was 52 Darrow/Boyd, The Yasna, min. 4:23-7:19.

The moment at which the priest enters the ritual place is captured in such a way that it coincides with the moment at which the priest comes on the screen, see also Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, p. 29. 54 The narrator comments on ritual actions, translates some of the recited texts, and explains the significance of the ritual gestures involved.

A stationary camera shows the total picture of the ar-rangements within the ritual space with Kotwal as the performing chief priest at the center and Hormuzdiar as the assistant priest most of the time on the left side of the screen near the fire vase. Another, moving camera shows the objects and elements as well as the respective ritual actions and gestures in close-up, focusing on the significant details of the performed ritual actions. The filmstrips of these two camera positions are merged together while the shots taken from the two positions are often faded over one another. Moreover, the positions of the cameras are par-ticularly chosen to emphasize certain aspects of ritual sequences and ges-tures for this purpose.59 This design of the film confirms that it is re-corded as a teaching demonstration for the classroom: it shows those se-quences of the Yasna which are considered crucial for the study of the performance of ritual actions. As mentioned above, this videotape can be regarded as a turning point in the research on the performance of the Yasna. The different methods and concepts Darrow and Williams/Boyd apply to the visual material of the videotape gave rise to their construction of new theoreti-cal approaches in the field of ritual studies. Although Darrow and Wil-liams/Boyd use the same empirical data of the ritual performance, they select and organize these data differently due to the methods and con-cepts they apply. Whereas Darrow uses an exegetical method for his analysis of the Yasna performance and focuses thereby on the sequential order of the particular elements involved, Williams/Boyd use a philoso-phical method for their interpretation of the relationship between art and ritual and so adopt the practitioner's point of view. Due to his exegetical method, Darrow presents the results of his re-search inductively. After he exposes unity as a crucial problem in the research on the Yasna, he describes the performance and introduces his semiotic approach. Then he shows how scholars formerly dealt with this problem and, finally, gives his own interpretation of the Yasna. In con-trast to Darrow, Williams/Boyd present the results of their investigation deductively in keeping with the philosophical method they prefer. To begin with, they give an overview of the relationships between aesthetics and ritual studies as a theoretical framework. Then they outline the vari-59 The interactions between the priests and the camera operator underline that this performance should fit the purposes of the directors.

After some concluding remarks on methodology, Williams/Boyd outline a ritual description of the Yasna in an appendix to their study. Because the application of different methods influences how the em-pirical data are presented, it is clear that Darrow and Williams/Boyd must analyze and organize their data differently. However, the semiotic and aesthetic approaches as developed by Darrow and Williams/Boyd are shaped through the 'lens' of one film, based on a selection of some sequences of the Yasna, which are performed principally by Dastur Kot-wal. This 'lens' of the visual material functions as a frame for the analy-sis of the empirical data within which the theoretical approaches are constructed and the analytical concepts are used. Thus, the subsequent research done by Darrow and Williams/Boyd is not only based on the ritual actions performed during the Yasna but is also guided and shaped by the medium of visual representation.60 Moreover, Darrow as well as Williams/Boyd analyze this videotape by means of analytical concepts that suit the visual material presented in this film and that are deliberately designed to suit it. My hypothesis here is that the interpretations of the Yasna given by these authors are formed and shaped by the medium of the videotape. At the same time, the analysis of this film is shaped by the 'lenses' of dif-ferent theoretical approaches and the methods and analytical concepts applied in each analysis.61 Therefore, a dialectical relationship exists be-tween the empirical data presented on the videotape and the semiotic and 60 For acquiring the knowledge of the ritual actions involved in the performance of the Yasna, Darrow as well as Williams/Boyd studied this videotape and interviewed Kotwal as their conversation partner, see Darrow, \"Keeping the Waters Dry\", p. 439 n. 11 and Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, p. 1. Through the lens of the video-tape and the eyes of one high priest, they studied one performance of one ritual inter-preted by one priest. 61 As Williams/Boyd explicitly state: \"Our collaboration brought together the field-work data with aesthetic theory. We began by studying the videotapes of the rituals [Yasna and Afrinagan], endeavoring to remain attentive to the ritual actions themselves and to their Zoroastrian interpretations. We were convinced that these gestural images could fruitfully be looked at through an aesthetic lens, applying to them various in-sights, categories, and theories from the philosophy of art\", Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, pp. 1 f., emphasis J.K. This counts not only for the analysis of this film but also for its production. For this reason, it would be naive to assume that in this case the staging and editing of the videotape could be seen independently from a pré-figuration of various approaches and concepts."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"aesthetic approaches employed by Darrow and Williams/Boyd, each with its own method and its own set of analytical concepts.62 The Design of Theoretical Approaches and the Use of Analytical Concepts As mentioned above, it is characteristic of the approaches employed by Darrow and Williams/Boyd that they emphasize—in contrast to text-bound studies of the Yasna—the ritual performance as a particular mode of religious action. For this reason, they use analytical concepts that highlight the specific aspects of the ritual performance. Whereas Darrow focuses his concepts on the syntactical interconnection of'fire' and 'wa-ter' in the various sequences of the Yasna, Williams/Boyd focus with their meta-language on the relation of 'art' and 'ritual' in the perform-ance of ritual gestures. In other words, Darrow looks at the sequential order of ritual actions, while Williams/Boyd focus on the particular ges-tures performed by the ritual actor. The Semiotic Approach to the Yasna Darrow uses the notion of 'dramatic unity' as a key concept for analyz-ing the empirical data and interpreting the Yasna performance. Accord-ing to Darrow, the unity of the Yasna can be made clear if one analyzes the semiotics of the elements involved in this ritual performance. Impor-tant for his approach is the question of how the elements 'water' and 'fire'—as material representations of spiritual principles—are intercon-nected in the ritual performance. He claims: \"The interconnection and apparent inequality of fire and water provide an indispensable starting point for interpreting the yasna and recognizing its dramatic unity.\"63 For heuristic purposes, Darrow considers the Yasna as a 'liturgy'. Ac-cording to him liturgies \"'re-present' events that are definitive and ' event-ualize' the structures that pattern events.\"64 Although most of the liturgy of the Yasna consists in the recitation of the sacred texts without accompanying ritual actions, Darrow focuses \"on actions rather than 62 In referring to the film, Williams/Boyd state, \"These data provided the pre-theoretic materials for the study of ritual and the Zoroastrian tradition, and later served as the means for testing the appropriateness of our interpretative categories\", Williams/ Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, p. 1. 63 Darrow, \"Keeping the Waters Dry\", p. 418. 64 Darrow, \"Keeping the Waters Dry\", p. 420."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"text.\"65 For him the unity of the Yasna is based on the performance of ritual actions rather than on the liturgical text. With this focus on ritual performance, Darrow aims at overcoming the dichotomies between text and enactment and between thought and action. He claims that a linguistic notion of performance might be useful as a starting point for interpreting the Yasna liturgy, but even that notion still \"remains text-bound and assumes a dichotomy between thought and action.\"66 For this reason, he looks at the performance of particular ritual actions while leaving aside the recitation of liturgical texts.67 Darrow analyzes the performance of ritual actions in which the inter-connection of fire and water play an integral role. Furthermore, he looks at the 'syntactical rules' by which the elements of particular ceremonies are combined. Assuming that the sequential order of'ritual actions' pre-supposes syntactical rules, he asks how the Yasna works and how it is governed by such rules. In focusing on the elements of fire and water, Darrow uncovers two rules that the sequential order of the ritual actions in the Yasna performance has to follow. At the most abstract level, he outlines the interconnection of fire and water in such a way that \"fire is singular while water is plural, and water always follows fire.\"68 In view of these syntactical rules, Darrow is concerned with the prob-lem of how the Yasna performance can be seen as a composition of the interconnection of the different elements involved. According to him, the particular ceremonies concerning fire and water can be seen as a \"con-glomeration of smaller rituals with no overall principle of unity.\"69 The central problem is that there are 'several ceremonies' in thQ yasna, which are performed independently of one another. In order to conceive the 'dramatic unity' of these ceremonies, Darrow focuses on those ritual ac-tions in which fire and water are involved and looks at the sequential order of these actions and the rules they follow.70 Due to this focus on the syn-65 Darrow, \"Keeping the Waters Dry\", p. 420. 66 Darrow, \"Keeping the Waters Dry\", p. 420. 67 Although there is, according to Darrow, a wide gap between text and action within the Zoroastrian tradition, he mentions that the text of the Yasna \"is valued not for its meaning but for its sacrality,\" Darrow, \"Keeping the Waters Dry\", p. 420. 68 Darrow, \"Keeping the Waters Dry\", p. 421. 69 Darrow, \"Keeping the Waters Dry\", p. 421. 70 Although it seems that the ritual actions concerning fire and water are performed independently of one another at the various levels of ritual action, Darrow succeeds in finding syntactic rules that determine how the ritual sequences involving fire and water are interconnected."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"tactical rules, he claims that the performance of the Yasna does not neces-sarily require a narrative: the sequences of ritual actions follow syntactical rules despite the fact that \"no narrative appears to underlie it.\"71 In a further step Darrow specifies his concept of'dramatic unity' by applying the notions of'form' and 'process'. In analyzing the syntactical rules for the composition of the Yasna out of a sequential order of par-ticular elements, Darrow focuses \"not on the form of yasna, but rather on the process of bringing to completion, the accomplishing that is achieved by the performance.\"72 According to Darrow, this 'processual form' is useful because it allows one to emphasize the non-narrative character of the Yasna. Moreover, he argues that, although there is no narrative, one still is able \"to recognize that there is a dramatic flow to the processual form.\"73 In focusing on this flow of the processual form, that is, how the ritual performance is brought to completion, Darrow claims that the structure of the ritual actions has a climax. To make this climax of the Yasna plausible, he uses the concept of 'drama' because he maintains, the con-cept of drama necessarily implies that \"there is a climactic structure.\"74 It is this kind of structure or processual form that sets up a conflict between the elements of water and fire. In his view, it is the climax, because of which the conflict between fire and water culminates in a final resolu-tion: \"The processual form establishes a conflict between the two mate-rial representations of spiritual principles [that is, fire and water] ... The conflict and its resolution authorize one to speak of a drama, and the af-firmation that it is a unity allows one to treat the yasna ... as a unity\".75 By means of this concept of a 'dramatic unity', Darrow wants to in-terrelate structure and event as well as form and process whereby the Yasna is regarded as a liturgy. With his semiotic approach to the Yasna, Darrow highlights two different features, namely that the enacted ritual is a composite unity and that the Yasna ritual has a processual form with the structure of a climax.76 71 Darrow, \"Keeping the Waters Dry\", p. 421. 72 Darrow, \"Keeping the Waters Dry\", p. 422. 73 Darrow, \"Keeping the Waters Dry\", p. 422. 74 Darrow, \"Keeping the Waters Dry\", p. 422. 75 Darrow, \"Keeping the Waters Dry\", p. 422. 76 Darrow, \"Keeping the Waters Dry\", p. 426."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"The Aesthetic Approach to the Yasna By contrast, Williams/Boyd use 'artistic masterpiece' as the key analytical concept for their interpretation of the Yasna performance. It is characteris-tic of their approach that ritual is primarily compared with other forms of performing arts. They consider ritual \"as if it were a kind of artwork which like opera, film or ancient drama, combines many of the arts into an inter-nally related whole.\"77 Moreover, Williams/Boyd define ritual as an irre-ducible mode of religious expression and conceive of it as an artistic com-position sui generis. As they say, it is \"an irreplaceable mode of expression not reducible to other forms of religious communication.\"78 Aiming at an interpretative study of 'ritual activity' in general, they favor a holistic view for the analysis of the ritual performance of the Yasna.79 Analyzing the ritual performance of the Yasna as a kind of artwork, Williams/Boyd explore the relevance of aesthetic theory for the study of ritual with regard to various aspects, such as language, knowledge, expres-sion, and feeling.80 To specify their concept of the 'artistic masterpiece', they introduce three different dimensions of space to the study of the Yasna.81 Drawing on concepts of space in the arts, they distinguish be-tween physical, semantic, and virtual 'ritual space'.82 Physical space en-compasses all ritual objects, which are the 'empirical' objects of an 'exter-nal reality'.83 Within semantic or meaning space, objects are seen as sym-bolic representations of something else.84 For 'virtual space', 'a term bor-77 Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, p. 2. 78 Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, p. 2. 79 See Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, pp. 46-50.

The whole is real, and the parts, which are provisional entities abstracted from the whole, have only secondary reality\", Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, p. 46. The phi-losophical setting of this approach becomes clear from the outline of their argument. They state that their \"discussion is primarily one of philosophical reflection of ritual action, based on documentary description of certain Zoroastrian rituals.\" And they continue: \"It reflects our comparative interests in the history of religions, art, philosophy, and aesthetics, as we seek better to understand the nature of ritual activity and its role in our own time and place\", Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, p. xni, emphasis J.K. 80 See Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, pp. 5-11. 81 See Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, pp. 15-35. 82 See Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, pp. 15-25. 83 See Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, pp. 15-16. 84 See Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, pp. 16-17."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"rowed from optics as well as aesthetics',85 an imaginative 'gestalt-shift' is necessary in order to perceive the presentational illusion of a non-existent object as 'virtually real'. In phenomenological terms, they distinguish be-tween the three dimensions of ritual space as \"the object, the appearance of the object and the significance of the object as it appears\".86 Moreover, Williams/Boyd emphasize the relationship between the different dimensions of ritual space. They argue that a performance of the Yasna is the interplay of the set of physical objects, the symbolic rep-resentation of ritual space, and the presentational illusions of a 'hyper-reality'.87 They analyze the interplay between these dimensions of ritual space and focus on those features of an imaginative 'gestalt-shift' that lie outside the realm of symbolic representation.88 Separating virtual space from physical and meaning space, Williams/Boyd argue for a distinct position of virtual space in order to \"highlight a dimension of the arts (and ritual) which is fundamental to their reality as artworks\" and to \"call attention to the dual role that virtual space plays in relation to the other two spaces.\"89 Their main argument for the gestalt-shift is that the performance of an artistic masterpiece such as the Yasna provides 'inte-grative contexts' that create the virtual space.90 As a result of the per-formance, the artistic masterpiece appears not only as 'virtually real' but also, they argue, the 'virtual space' that is created by the ritual perform-ance of the Yasna \"is rea/\".91 Furthermore, Williams/Boyd argue that the integrative contexts of ritual space are internally related.

The concept of 'exemplification' allows them to ana-lyze the ritual performance as an embodiment of abstract or religious principles.93 According to them, the ritual performance of the Yasna has to be analyzed as \"a system of internal relations.\"94 As a form sui generis, the Yasna creates contexts that integrate the physical, semantic, and virtual dimensions of the ritual space.95 They analyze how the differ-ent types of ritual space overlap and how they are related to the temporal, gestural, visual, and auditory dimensions of the ritual performance.96 A further theoretical issue that Williams/Boyd introduce is the con-cept of 'ritual repetition'.97 They maintain that rituals are repetitive and inherently invariant due to the practitioner's commitment to invariance, as they argue in accordance with their key informant, Dastur Kotwal.98 In their view, the repetition of the Yasna and the commitment to invariance has a knowledge-gaining function.99 By repeating the same ritual over and over again, they argue, the high priest gains a particular kind of bod-ily knowledge.100 This knowledge goes beyond prepositional meaning such that \"the participant comes to know, in ways not reducible to pro-positional expression.\"101 Moreover, Williams/Boyd interpret the repeti-tion of the ritual performance in the light of such performing arts as mu-93 See Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, p. 36. They regard, for example, the fire in the Yasna as an exemplification of light and divine presence. One could also add that water can be regarded as the exemplification of ritual purity 94 Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, p. 46. 95 They argue \"The physical, virtual, and symbolical dimensions are viewed as the real units of activity and meaning. Their combination is the ritual performance,\" Wil-liams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, p. 46, emphasis in the original. 96 See Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, pp. 25-35, 47-50, 55-57. 97 See Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, pp. 83-100. 98 Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, pp. 61 f., 70-82, esp. p. 79. 99 Although Williams/Boyd distinguish between two opposing stances a performer can take on ritual repetition (ritual is either subject to variance or invariance) and rec-ognize that rituals change over time, they nevertheless emphasize that ritual is essen-tially repetitive and that the repeated enactment of an invariant ritual is essential to its function to gain ritual knowledge. In short, they stress \"the importance of ritual invari-ance for the acquisition of new knowledge while recognizing the fact of historical change,\" Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, p. 62. 100 They argue that this 'tacit knowledge' of the body \"can be only incompletely un-derstood by means propositional explanations\", Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowl-edge, p. 151. 101 Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, p. 57."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"sic, opera, and classical concertos.102 The Yasna can be seen as an artis-tic masterpiece because \"invariance belongs to the very nature of ritual as it does to certain forms of artwork.\"103 For the construction of their aesthetic approach, Williams/Boyd use such analytical concepts as 'artistic masterpiece' and 'virtual space', which obviously fit the visual material of the videotape and their theoretical ap-proach. In doing so, they establish a set of 'interpretative categories', which they call a 'meta-language'.104 By using the categories of aesthetic theory, they aim at a more adequate description of the ritual performance and the complexity of its virtual features. They argue that the performance of an artistic masterpiece is the product of a complex interplay of a variety of aesthetic media and the bodily knowledge of the practitioner, which cannot be adequately interpreted without aesthetic categories.105 Moreover, Williams/Boyd distinguish between 'ritual action' and 'rit-ual theory' in order to emphasize the shift from action to theory and to mark the limits of theory.106 For this reason, they refer to their study of the Yasna not as a 'general theory of ritual', but rather as a 'theoretical approach' to the aesthetic features of the Yasna performance.107 Favor-ing an 'interpretation without reductionism',108 they argue that their at-tempt at theorizing does not replace the constitutive elements of the prac-titioner's viewpoint on the ritual performance because, they maintain, \"theory cannot substitute the difference between event and word, be-tween life and reflection.\"109 Different Settings of Discursive Contexts In this section, it is argued that the semiotic and the aesthetic approaches to the study of the Yasna as presented above use a particular set of concepts 102 See Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, pp. 17, 23-24, 72-73, 80. 103 Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, p. 72. 104 Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, p. 146. 105 See Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, pp. 80, 141-142. 106 Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, pp. 151-152. 107 They argue that their study is not 'systematic' in the 'traditional sense' because they have made no attempt to prove theories. They rather have borrowed from different theories and mage their own use of them. In this sense, they maintain \"our approach is pluralistic rather than systematic, and, confronted with other rituals, we might employ different theories and categories as well as extend the present results and methods of analysis,\" Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, p. 147. 108 Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, pp. 152-153. 109 Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, p. 155."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"for the analysis of their material in order to address theoretical issues that are relevant for the particular discourses in which they participate. The dif-ferent use of similar concepts indicates that Darrow as well as Williams/ Boyd address different discursive contexts, although both approaches use the same visual material of a filmed performance as their empirical data and both share some basic assumptions concerning ritual studies. To indi-cate the differences between these approaches, it is helpful to contrast these differences with the assumptions they have in common: Both empha-size action rather than text and define ritual as a religious action sui generis. Despite different nuances, they both are in favor of a holistic view of the ritual action and consider the ritual performance as an integrative unity in which the meaning of the parts is constituted by the whole. Both argue that the performance of ritual actions is not meaningless. Nevertheless, the differences between these approaches emerge in the different meanings each ascribes to the ritual performance. For Darrow the meaning of the Yasna is constituted by the syntactic rules and the climactic structure of the 'dramatic unity', whereas for Williams/Boyd the meaning lies in the virtual features of the 'artistic masterpiece' out-side the realm of propositional representation. Whereas Darrow is pri-marily concerned with the temporal aspects of the performance of ritual actions, Williams/Boyd focus chiefly on the spatial aspects of an invari-ant ritual. The point here is that the differences between these ap-proaches to the study of the Yasna can be explained on the basis of the different theoretical issues with which they address different discursive contexts and participate in different discourses. Contextualizing 'Dramatic Unity' In his article,110 Darrow introduces the concept of 'dramatic unity' in order to challenge the philological and historical assumptions formulated in text-bound studies. Based on a review of three scholarly attempts to 110 Darrow delivered an earlier version of this article at the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Religion in Atlanta, December 1986. His expression of indebt-edness goes to Kotwal and Boyd. Referring to them, he writes: \"I hope the reading of the yasna proposed here is continuous with their methodological strictures\", Darrow, \"Keeping the Waters Dry\", p. 439 n. 11 namely, that \"ritual practices ... have their own meaning and value as actions, not only as 'symbols' of concepts. A defensible herme-neutic demands an understanding of rituals on their own terms\", F.M Kotwal/J.W.

For this purpose, he adopts a definition of liturgy that Ronald Grimes estab-lished for the field of ritual studies. In accordance with Grimes, Darrow defines liturgy as one of the modes of ritual sensibility that is concerned with event and structure.113 For his assessment of the field of liturgical re-search, Darrow agrees with one of William Doty's judgments concerning the study of ritual in the history of religions.114 Following Doty, Darrow argues that the study of liturgies has received less attention in ritual studies because liturgies were formerly the classical focus of the myth-and-ritual school, according to which liturgies are supposed to follow the schema of a mythical narrative.115 It is this view that Darrow wants to put into question with his concept of a 'dramatic unity' of the Yasna. Moreover, he agrees that the formerly predominate historical or philological study of liturgies mainly disappeared in favor of the study of other forms of ritual action, such as festivals116 or rites de passage117 which are mainly studied in social and cultural anthropology. In order to justify his approach to the study of the Yasna as a liturgy, Darrow outlines two trends in the recent research on liturgy, which he aims to integrate by means of his semiotic approach. One ' '1 According to him, Boyce, History of Zoroastrianism, has employed a cosmogonie interpretation, Marijan Molé, Culte, Mythe et Cosmologie dans l'Iran ancien (Paris, 1963), has provided an eschatological interpretation, and G.

According to Darrow, the first trend, which is concerned with per-formance and pragmatics, depends on speech act theory. It is strongly informed, he argues, \"by the illocutionary force of ritual speech deriving from linguistic performance theory.\"118 Here Darrow mentions Stanley J. Tambiah, who developed a performative approach to the study of ritual and applied the pragmatics of speech act theory to the analysis of ritual performances.119 Furthermore, Darrow explicitly refers to the studies in the history of religions by Wade Wheelock, who employed this perfor-mative approach to the study of Vedic ritual and the Roman Catholic Mass.120 In his study of the performative dimension of liturgical texts, Darrow argues, Wheelock restricts his focus mainly to the interrelation between word and action. Despite the productive impulse of the linguistic performance theory, Darrow criticizes Wheelock's performative approach for still being text-bound and presuming the dichotomy between thought and action \"that it then seeks to overcome.\"121 Here he prefers the discursive approach em-ployed by Catherine Bell, who questioned the dichotomy between thought and action, which she identified as one of the most powerful as-sumptions in the history of scholarly research in the study of rituals.122 Because Darrow wants to address this theoretical issue raised by Bell's discursive approach, he focuses his analysis almost exclusively on the ritual action. In his analysis, he even doubts that a philological analysis of the liturgical text can attain results that would be relevant for the un-derstanding of the unity of the Yasna as ritual. In Darrow's view the second trend in the recent study of liturgies concerned with syntax and meaninglessness is dominantly represented by Frits Staal's classic article, \"The Meaninglessness of Ritual\". What Darrow finds useful in this \"brilliant if turbulent suggestion\"123 is that it allows one to focus almost exclusively on the syntax of'ritual action'. In 118 Darrow, \"Keeping the Waters Dry\", p. 420. 119 See Tambiah, \"A Performative Approach to Ritual\", pp. 127-130. 120 W.

Nevertheless, Darrow rejects Staal's view that the syntactical rules of ritual actions are arbitrary and that this activity as such is meaningless.125 But the theoretical issue he finds interesting in Staal's approach is that Staal's analysis—in contrast to the myth-and-ritual approach—\"directs attention from narrative schémas of rituals to the unending complexity of rule-govemed ritual actions.\"126 For this rea-son Darrow looks closely at the complexity of the syntactical rules that govern the ritual actions in the performance of the Yasna. Contrary to Staal, however, Darrow argues that these rules have a meaning. For him the syntactical rules concerning water and fire imply a sequential order and a climactic structure of the interconnected elements of water and fire. Therefore, he argues that the rules carried out in the performance of the Yasna have a meaning. In his approach, Darrow combines the theoretical issues of these two trends in ritual studies with his analysis of the Yasna as a 'dramatic unity'. Focusing on how water and fire interact in the performance of ritual ac-tions, Darrow maintains that from the ritual action point of view the Yasna can be seen as a dramatic unity. Moreover, he uses this concept in order to address the discourse on 'performance' in the study of rituals. Here Dar-row refers to the hermeneutics of performance as Lawrence Sullivan intro-duced it into the history of religions.127 Following Sullivan, Darrow ar-gues: \"I have chosen the heuristic notion of'dramatic unity' to emphasize that it is as performance that I am approaching the ritual.\"128 Moreover, he combines this notion of performance with Victor W. Turner's view of rit-ual as 'social drama' and focuses not on the form of the Yasna but \"on the process of bringing to completion, the accomplishing that is achieved by the performance.\"129 Darrow uses Turner's concept of the processual form of performance in order to emphasize that one can \"hold to the non-narrative character of the yasna.\"m It is this processual form that Darrow 124 Darrow, \"Keeping the Waters Dry\", p. 421. 125 See Staal, \"The Meaninglessness of Ritual\", pp. 9, 19-21. 126 Darrow, \"Keeping the Waters Dry\", p. 421. 127 L.

Moreover, he takes this generalized notion of drama from Turner's concept of ritual131 and applies it to the Yasna performance. As the various discursive contexts and theoretical issues indicate, Dar-row aims to solve the central problem in the history of scholarly research on the Yasna, namely how the unity of this ritual can be explained based on the elements involved. To this end, he develops his semiotic approach and employs a number of concepts that are used in different contexts of the scholarly discourse on ritual that he addresses. Apart from the philological and historical research on the Yasna, Darrow focuses his analysis primarily on ritual actions and on the sequential order of the elements involved. Nevertheless, he relates the elements and sequences of the performance— as they are presented in the film—to the liturgical text and makes frequent reference to the results of previous scholarly research. This shows that Dar-row aims to question the paradigms of the text-bound studies on the Yasna. To achieve this, Darrow chooses a strategy that allows him to link the concepts employed in ritual studies to the philological and historical research in the history of religions. Hence, he presents his findings in such a way that his analysis of ritual actions can be related to the liturgical text and that it suits the exegetical method he employs. It is most likely for these reasons that the design of Darrow's semiotic approach does not seem to depend on the visual material as presented in the video, although the opposite is the case. Contextualizing 'Artistic Masterpiece' In contrast to Darrow, Williams/Boyd are not concerned with the prob-lems of the historical and philological study of the Yasna. Rather, they focus on quite a different set of theoretical issues so as to address the field of ritual studies from the perspective of aesthetic philosophy as their discursive context. In their book Ritual Art and Knowledge,132 Wil-131 Turner, From Ritual to Theatre, p. 91. 132 The results described in this book were first presented at the conference of the Council for World Religions, \"Ritual, Symbol and Participation in the Quest of Inter-faith Cooperation\", held in Harrison Hot Springs, B.C., Canada, 1987, and at the K.R. Cama Oriental Institution conference in Bombay, India, 1988. The first part of the book on the different notions of ritual space was formerly published, J.W. Boyd/R.G. Wil-liams, \"Ritual Spaces.

Therefore, they make use of a variety of analytical concepts derived from aesthetics and ritual studies in order to construct a new theoretical framework for their aesthetic approach to theorizing ritual. To distinguish ritual from other forms of religious communication and to relate ritual to the various forms of the performing arts, they address primarily those issues that en-able them to apply philosophical theories of art to the field of ritual stud-ies. Therefore, they use such concepts as 'virtual space' and 'ritual knowledge' by means of which the philosophical issues of aesthetic the-ory and ritual studies can be linked. Like Darrow, they refer to Lawrence Sullivan's performance ap-proach.133 They argue in the keeping with Sullivan that ritual not only re-lates to text or drama but also to music, dance, sculpture, painting, and ar-chitecture. Based on the multiplicity of genres in performing arts, Wil-liams/Boyd want to develop their aesthetic categories as a new meta-language for the description of ritual performances.134 In view of their dis-cursive context, it is significant that Williams/Boyd agree with Bruce Kapferer and Richard Schechner that role of aesthetics is important but largely neglected in connection with ritual studies.135 They emphasize that the scholarly research in ritual studies so far has paid insufficient attention to the aesthetics and aesthetic dimensions of ritual performances.136 Furthermore, Williams/Boyd analyze the Yasna performance primar-ily in terms of ritual spaces. Their concept of virtual space is built on a philosophical concept that Susanne Κ. Langer developed for the visual arts.137 Williams/Boyd apply the notion of 'virtual space' in a way that differs from Langer. Whereas Langer introduces the concept for the re-ception process in the presence of artworks, thereby understanding the Moreover, Boyd/Williams dedicate this article to Kotwal and write, \"The authors also wish to acknowledge their gratitude to Dastur Firoze M.

In this regard, they extend and transform Langer's concept of virtual space. They further relate this concept to the concepts of physical and meaning space in ritual performances.139 Moreover, with the concept of exemplification Williams/Boyd adopt another concept from the philosophy of art, which Nelson Goodman de-veloped for his aesthetic theory of the languages of art. They mainly fol-low Goodman's distinction between 'exemplification' to 'denotation' as opposite mode of signification.140 With this concept Williams/Boyd want to overcome the problem of proposition and reference in the study of ritual performances that Frits Staal formulated in his article on the meaninglessness of ritual.141 In addressing this discursive context, Wil-liams/ Boyd apply the concept of exemplification to the analysis of meaning space and argue that certain of the ritual implements embody, manifest, or become instances of sacred principles.142 Further elaborating this argument, Williams/Boyd introduce two dif-ferent theories of metaphor as interpretative categories in order to frame the meaning of ritual action. According to the first theory, which Max Black developed, metaphors are an irreducible mode of saying some-thing that has a meaning of its own.143 According to the second theory, which Donald Davidson favors, metaphors have no reference or mean-ing other than their literal meaning.144 Williams/Boyd regard these two theories not as mutually exclusive but as two poles. By using both theo-ries of metaphor, they aim to go beyond the assumption that the mean-ing of rituals can be expressed in a propositional form.145 138 S.K. Langer, Feeling and Form, p. 103. 139 Williams/Boyd explicitly say: \"It should be noted that the terms 'physical' and 'meaning space' are ours, and that our treatment of virtual space is not identical with Langer's\", Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, 18 n. 10. 140 Nelson Goodman, Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols (Indi-anapolis, 1968), pp. 3-6, 52-57. 141 Staal, \"The Meaninglessness of Ritual\". 142 Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, p. 36.

Therefore, they focus on the theo-retical issue of the repetition and invariance of rituals. Following the theoretical approach of Roy A. Rappaport, they use the concept of'litur-gical order'146 and argue that \"invariance is an essential feature of ritual practice.\"147 They relate this concept of ritual invariance to the acquisi-tion of ritual knowledge and the stance a practitioner can take towards ritual repetition. Here Williams/Boyd enter the discourse on the function of repetition for the acquisition of ritual knowledge issued by Theodore W. Jennings, who argued that variance is a necessary precondition for the acquisition of ritual knowledge.148 Williams/Boyd reject Jennings's view that only variation can have a noetic function. Instead, they accept the conviction of their key informant Dastur Kotwal that the commitment to invariance is essential in order to gain ritual knowledge. With Kotwal, they find \"the repetitive enactment of ««changing rituals to be essential to their knowledge-gaining function.\"149 Although Williams/Boyd rec-ognize, in accordance with Kotwal, that rituals inevitably change over time, they emphasize that the commitment to invariance is crucial in or-der to gain bodily knowledge of ritual performance by repetition. Here their concept of'artistic masterpiece' again Comes into play. Only if one repeats a ritual over and over again is it possible to perform this ritual as an artistic masterpiece, that is to say, in such a way that one can perceive it as 'virtually real' and this means that it can be seen as an 'exemplifica-tion' of sacred principles. As indicated by the discursive contexts addressed, Williams/Boyd are concerned with the development of a new meta-language for their theoreti-cal framework, a language that is capable of relating ritual and performing art and integrating the practitioner's viewpoint. Hence, they relate the per-formance of ritual gestures—as presented in the film—to the bodily knowledge that the gestures have for the practitioner. For their aesthetic approach, Williams/Boyd constantly address those theoretical issues that allow them to introduce analytical concepts derived from philosophical theories of the performing arts into the study of ritual. Their strategy is to borrow freely from various philosophical theories of art and to use the bor-146 See Rappaport, \"The Obvious Aspects of Ritual\", pp. 175 f. 192. 147 Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, p. 61. 148 Theodore W.

Due to their philosophical method, their aesthetic approach does not seem to depend exclusively on their analysis of the Yasna. Nevertheless, the frame of their aesthetic approach obviously is shaped by the visual material they use and on the interpretative perspective they adopt from the practitioner's point of view. CONCLUSION The aim of this paper has been to analyze and compare two theoretical approaches to the study of the Yasna at a meta-theoretical level. In fo-cusing on such meta-theoretical parameters as 'methodology', 'logic of design', and 'discourse', those components were used that made it pos-sible to contrast the differences between these approaches with their similarities. Therefore, such components as 'empirical data', 'analytical concepts', and 'discursive contexts' with their complex and interdepend-ent relationships were introduced as tools for the meta-theoretical com-parison. Using these tools, it is shown in three steps how both theoretical approaches are shaped by the empirical data presented in a videotape, how each is constructed by use of a specific set of analytical concepts, and how they participate in different discursive contexts of the scholarly research on ritual performances. In relating these mutually dependent components, I argue that, although these approaches are based on the same empirical data and despite the fact that they use similar analytical concepts, they are constructed as different theoretical approaches. They use their concepts differently because they address different discursive contexts and are concerned with different theoretical issues. In view of the evidence adduced, the argument runs as follows: The film of the Yasna performance makes it possible to construct two mutu-ally exclusive approaches. Some of the empirical data the film presents are used for the construction of the semiotic and aesthetic approaches. From the visual material provided by the videotape, the approaches se-lect particular sets of empirical data by using their own set of analytical concepts. Concepts such as 'dramatic unity', 'processual form', 'artistic masterpiece', and 'virtual space' are suggested by and can be linked to the composition of the film. However, not all the concepts that the semi-otic and aesthetic approaches use fit the design of this film or could be strictly derived from it as their cinematic pre-figurations. Nevertheless, the visual material of this film can be regarded as the empirical basis for the construction of these approaches."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Moreover, the film itself has become part of the scholarly discourse on the Yasna. Yet while the semiotic and aesthetic approaches are shaped through the 'lens' of this videotape, they differ because of the theoretical issues they each raise in response to the discursive contexts they each address. Also, the aforementioned approaches analyze this videotape by means of those methods and concepts that suit the visual material and are regarded as relevant for the scholarly discourse. So, the theoretical approaches differ not only because the interpretations of the Yasna are shaped by the visual representations of the film but also be-cause the different contexts of scholarly discourse were responsible for the different use of the methods and concepts to which the participation in those contexts lead. Due to the available empirical data and the analytical concepts in use, the approaches employed by Darrow and Williams/Boyd tend to ontolo-gize the Yasna as an a-temporal entity. For the construction of their theo-retical approaches, they both presuppose that there is such a thing as the Yasna, arguing that the Yasna as a ritual is a form of religious action sui generis. This a-temporal view of the Yasna changes either once other visual material of Yasna performances becomes available for scholarly research or if one uses other concepts for analyzing the ritual perform-ances. Such empirical data and analytical concepts would challenge the basis of the two recent approaches to the study of the Yasna that were presented in the foregoing. A further result of the meta-theoretical comparison is its demonstra-tion of the existence of a mutual relationship between the construction of theoretical approaches and the analysis of empirical data, as well as be-tween the use of analytical concepts and the participation in discursive contexts. If this argument is valid, a counter-proof is necessary. That is to say, if one of the components changes, it should have an effect on the other components involved. Therefore, it is necessary to test whether, by changing one or more of the components, there is an effect on the other components involved. For example, if more visual material were to become available, one would be in a position to compare the different styles of ritual gestures, the choreography of different performances, and the habits of different priests. Or if one were to film the rehearsals of the Yasna at the training schools for priests, then one could analyze the process of ritual transmis-sion, the learning of ritual competence, and the practice of ritual knowl-edge as a mode of bodily memory. Or if one were to film a whole series"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"of Yasna performances, one would most likely be able to observe how rituals change through slight variations in successive performance.130 One could also look at the staged Yasna performance on the videotape and apply concepts such as 'agency', 'complexity', 'efficacy', 'habitus', or 're-flexivity'.151 Then one would likely reach different conclusions and to a different theoretical approach because the empirical data would be organ-ized in a different way. It might even be that different empirical data and related concepts would become necessary. Obviously, different discursive contexts would be addressed which would accordingly change the logic of design. The analytical concepts one uses will in each case alter what em-pirical data are produced and what theoretical approaches are developed. This again can be seen as part of the dynamics of scholarly discourse on ritual performance as Catherine Bell has convincingly outlined them. By analyzing and comparing two recent theoretical approaches to the Yasna, we have indicated how useful it is to apply various parameters of a meta-theoretical matrix. These parameters enable one to see—from a different perspective—how various approaches work within a particular field of scholarly research, how they are constructed, and how they are situated within the different contexts of which they are a part. This meta-theoretical perspective also promises to open up further possibilities for looking at theoretical approaches by means of their methodology, their logic of design, and their discourses. 150 J.

INTRODUCTION Undeniably, many rituals include aesthetic elements.1 From within a tra-dition it is not uncommon to say, for example, that beautiful objects and gestures are pleasing to the inhabitants of the spirit realm.2 But art has a life of its own, and we believe that continual exposure to the aesthetic 1 The term ritual in this essay refers primarily to liturgical rites, following Grimes' typology; cf. R.L. Grimes, Ritual Criticism: Case Studies in Its Practice. Essays on Its Theory (Columbia, 1990), pp. 9 ff. 2 Within the Zoroastrian tradition, the Äfrinagän ceremony is an obvious example of aesthetically pleasing offerings made to the Lord of Wisdom and His spirit creation. In addition to the ritual fire and several silver trays containing a variety of offerings such as sandalwood, frankincense, fruits, eggs and bread, water, sharbat, milk and wine, the priests wear white robes of organdy over their white garments and exchange eight flow-ers - either jasmine, marigolds, red and white roses, or other fragrant flowers of the season; cf. R.G. Williams/J.W. Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge: Aesthetic Theory and Zoroastrian Ritual (Columbia, 1993). The role of aesthetics in the Zoroastrian Yasna liturgy is also important. For example, all ritual items must be made \"clean\" in the pre-paratory service and their purity maintained throughout the Yasna proper. Cleanli-ness/purity is an aesthetic as well as theological category; cf. F.M. Kotwal/J.W. Boyd, A Persian Offering, The Yasna: A Zoroastrian High Liturgy (Studia Iranica, Cahier 8; Paris, 1991 ). There is also, of course, the radiant light of the fire. Shrine Shinto rituals, likewise, cultivate and affirm the role of aesthetics in their religious tradition. Kishi-moto Hideo, \"Some Japanese Cultural Traits and Religions\", Philosophy and Culture East and West, ed. Charles A. Moore (Honolulu, 1962), pp. 245-254, says of Japanese religiosity: \"In their achievements religious values and aesthetic values are not two different things. Ultimately, they are one for the Japanese\" (p. 251 ). In the Shinto daily morning service (the Chö Hai) fresh offerings of natural products from the sea, rivers and mountains as well as cultivated foods such as rice and vegetables are artfully placed in the offering area, and the chief priest performs a short musical interlude on drums and bells during the service.

This raises a methodological question that contin-ues to provoke us: what form (or forms) might an adequate aesthetic ap-proach to ritual take? The following remarks address this question with-out providing a final answer. Our work over the last few years has taken a comparative turn. In ad-dition to Zoroastrian studies, we have also begun to study Shinto rituals.3 The reason for this is specific. In our efforts to study rituals in their own right and not merely as decorative additions to theology,4 we looked to a tradition that arguably is primarily a ritual tradition. The story is told by Mircea Eliade that when an American philosopher asked a Shinto priest why there isn't any theology in Japanese Shinto, the priest's response was: \"We have no theology. We dance.\"5 This, of course, is a caricature of Shrine Shinto as it does have an interpretive tradition.6 However, it is also correct to say that the central focus of Shrine Shinto is ritual, not theology, and that in fact there is common reference to kotoagesezu (\"word not saying\" or \"no doctrine\") among the priests we interviewed.7 We have also continued to explore recent Western art and aesthetics in the hope of furthering our understanding of the role of art in ritual. Our study of the aesthetic and ritualistic features of the Bulgarian born American artist Christo has been especially helpful. In this essay, we juxtapose observations about the Zoroastrian and Shinto ritual traditions with a brief analysis of a recent Western work by Christo in order to hint at an approach to the study of art in ritual. 3 We wish to express our indebtedness to Dastur Firoze M. Kotwal, Zoroastrian high priest from Bombay, India, and the late Yukitaka Yamamoto Gûji, chief priest of Tsu-baki Grand Shrine, Mie Prefecture, Japan. Both priests have allowed us the opportunity to study the liturgical and festival practices of their respective traditions. Our most re-cent work in Japan entailed living at Tsubaki Grand Shrine for a month in 1996, 1998, and 2000. It is with great regret that we report the recent death of Yamamoto Gûji. 4 Cf. R.G.

A BRIEF COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS 2.1 World views We will begin by briefly contrasting the two world views that provide a context for understanding the Zoroastrian and Shinto liturgies, highlight-ing three major differences. In so doing, we are sketching the differences with a broad brush and consequently leave undeveloped various other themes or emphases characteristic of each tradition.8 2.1.1 Transcendence vs. Immanence The Zoroastrian tradition affirms a difference in kind between the mënôg (the invisible, spiritual) and gëtîg (the visible, material) realms that can be expressed as a philosophy of transcendence. Ahura Mazda, as invisi-ble among invisibles, inhabiting infinite time, and beyond even the other creatures of the spirit realms, is clearly a transcendent figure of ultimate purity, guaranteeing that consciousness and concept are prior to human action. The Lord of Wisdom, infinite time, truth, and purity are ontologi-cally and logically prior to the mundane. It is natural in such philosophies to employ the metaphors of ascen-sion and light. The vertical dimension is paramount because the ascent to the source entails increasing grades of purity, and, in the opposite direc-tion, the gëtîg realm is infused and maintained by the energy flowing to it from above. Shinto, too, has its images of ascent, usually couched in terms of hu-man beings as descendents of kami ancestors. But the center of gravity of Shinto is not in the heights. It is a religion of immanence and, one might say, the horizontality of this world. An immanent world is not cre-ated from above, but produced from within. The kami are not transcen-dent, but exceptional phenomena in the only world there is - a world infused by a connective life force continually unfolding and increasing in complexity. In the course of this unfolding, the self and language emerge, products of the underlying forces of nature - at least according to those practitioners who see Shinto as compatible with empiricism and illuminated by Bergson's concept of élan vital9 8 E.g., the role of history in Zoroastrianism is only briefly alluded to in the above discussion in terms of the role of time, and the importance of ritual repetition in the Shinto tradition could also be developed in a fuller comparative study. 9 We intend a broad sense of \"empiricism\" which allows for metaphysical constructs while remaining within the natural order, shunning any appeal to a transcendent reality."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"It follows that there are two contrasting views of explanation: Zoroas-trianism explains this world in terms of the prior transcendent principles originating in the mënôg, whereas Shinto encourages attention to the un-derlying intensities in nature, personified as kami. One is a tradition of transcendence and its vertical metaphors, the other a tradition of imma-nence and horizontal images.10 2.1.2 Being and Becoming A second thematic difference has to do with the contrast between a \"story already written\" and a \"story in the process of writing itself out.\" Zoroastrianism emphasizes being over becoming, insofar as the un-changing, eternal, universal principles, concepts, and laws are already in place at the beginning. It is within the space of these prior possibilities that the mundane world unfolds and the good news is that we have at least limited access to these principles and can play our part in the strug-gle for increased righteousness. The emphasis on the original vision and the laws that govern the mënôg and gëtîg worlds quite naturally leads to an emphasis on origin and goal. We are assured of the source of right-eousness and ultimate salvation. This is accompanied by a sense of time and memory and expectation emphasizing past creation and future out-comes. In particular, both the ultimate origin and earthly beginnings are to be remembered and celebrated, dictating an emphasis on ritual repeti-tion and a commitment to transmitting rituals unchanged.\" Though there are origin myths in the Shinto tradition there is no metaphysics of a priori immutable law. The unfolding world generates new complexities and chance encounters within the minimal prior con-straint of the élan vital. Since it is in the present that the world is becom-ing, there is an emphasis on being \"in the middle of the now\"—we are For a succinct discussion of this view, cf. G. Deleuze, Pure Immanence: Essays on A Life, trans. Ann Boyman (New York, 2001), pp. 7-33.The chief priest of Tsubaki Grand Shrine, Yamamoto Gûji, urged us to read J.W.F. Mason's book The Meaning of Shinto (Port Washington/N. Y., 1967 [ 1953]), because Mason \"was capable of receiving the spirit of Japan...he could be a Shinto priest\" (interview: Dec. 27, 1995). Central to Mason's interpretation of Shinto is H. Bergson's notion of élan vital, and of existence precedent to force and form. 10 Yamamoto Gûji quite frequently used horizontal images in his conversations about Shinto, and in fact, on one occasion while commenting on the importance of social rela-tions, stated concisely \"religion is horizontal...\" (interview: Jan. 1, 1996).

Such images forefront emergence of the new rather than remembering through ritual repetition the origin and goal of creation.12 2.1.3 Morality vs. Ethics The third theme concerns the differences between morality and ethics, or good vs. evil in contrast to good and bad encounters. Transcendent, uni-versal principles—in this case Zoroastrian principles of righteousness— dictate the moral principles governing the mundane realm. But if the transcendent law is also the law of earth, it is typically imperfectly in-stantiated on earth. There is, of course, a consequent struggle between transcendent forces of good and evil, and the goal is one of ordering the world in accordance with the highest, prior, and stable principles. Shinto, on the other hand, relies in effect on a distinction between good and bad encounters - encounters in this world which either en-hance or reduce our power to act. On this ethical view there is no order-ing of the world in conformity with prior principles, but an exploratory ongoing struggle to organize human society in ways that promote more good than bad encounters. It is in effect a more pragmatic, experimental approach to the good of society; it requires the ability to attend to the present situation with clarity, to be guided by prior social convention, and to introduce changes with a view to improvement.13 12 J.W. Boyd/R.G. Williams, \"Japanese Shinto: An Interpretation of a Priestly Per-spective\", forthcoming, Philosophy East and West 55:1, January 2005. 13 The distinction between 'morality' and 'ethics' is introduced by Spinoza, trans-formed by Nietzsche, and developed by Gilles Deleuze.

Turetzky, \"Pictorial Depth\" (unpublished essay presented summer 2002 at the Philoso-phy Seminar, University of Canterbury, Christchurch/New Zealand)."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"2.2 Ritual Mirroring of the Two World Views Given these contrasting features between the two world views, what then can we expect to find in terms of differences in their ritual practices? Let us turn to specific examples. 2.2.1 Vertical and Horizontal We have characterized the Zoroastrian world view as a philosophy of transcendence, with its metaphor of ascent, in contrast to the Shinto em-phasis on immanence and the horizontal. The aesthetic dimensions of the Zoroastrian high liturgy, the Yasna, and the outer ceremony, the Äfrina-gän, mirror this world view. In Yasna 62 of the Zoroastrian high liturgy, the chief priest, after sit-ting in a cross-legged position for most of the liturgy, dramatically stands on the priest's stone seat, holding vertically the barsom bundle in his left hand and one metal wire in his right. Together with the standing assis-tant priest, he recites a mänthric litany to fire, itself on an elevated stand (cf. plates I/l).14 Likewise, in the Zoroastrian Äfrinägan ceremony of blessings, there are several exchanges of flowers between the standing assistant priest and the seated chief priest - an interchange repeated with a different set of eight blossoms during each of three Avestan recitations. One inter-pretation of the verticality of this ritual gesture is that it symbolizes the soul's passage from one realm to the other, connecting the two distinct mënôg and gëtîg realms with each other. The gesture may also serve as an image of right communication between the higher mënôg and deriva-tive gëtîg realm.15 This verticality is not characteristic of either the ritual setting or the ritual gestures that take place within a Shinto shrine. One's first impres-sion when entering a shrine precinct is the horizontality of the torii gate, the entrance to the outer worship hall, and the hall itself. The torii is a key symbol of Shinto, marking a shrine or special sacred space (cf. plates 14 Cf. Kotwal/Boyd, A Persian Offering, pp. 51,119; J.W. Boyd/F.M. Kotwal, \"Wor-ship in a Zoroastrian Fire Temple\", Indo-lranian Journal 26, 1984, pp. 293-318; J.W. Boyd/W.R. Darrow (eds and producers), \"A Zoroastrian Ritual: The Yasna\", video documentary (31 minutes), Office of Instructional Services, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, 1982. 15 Cf. Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge: Aesthetic Theory and Zoroastrian Ritual."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"III/4). The two vertical columns suggest the \"unusual\" status of the kami. Kami are \"superior\" but not metaphysically transcendent manifestations of the life force that generates the whole of Great Nature. But the two horizontal rails, one over the top of the columns and the other penetrat-ing the columns so that the vertical is dominated by the horizontal, sug-gest the immanence of the life force. Further, the shimenawa is a vivid image of the connected, unfolding process (musubi) of Great Nature. It is a thickly braided rope of rice straw hung horizontally across the front of the main worship hall of a shrine (cf. plates II/2). Together with the hori-zontal lines of the shrine itself, it conveys the impression of Shinto being solidly grounded in nature. There are but a few examples of how Zoroastrian rituals and the Shinto liturgical setting mirror a philosophy of transcendence in contrast to one of immanence. 2.2.2 Ritual Stability and Change In addition, recall the contrast between the \"story already written\" in Zoroastrianism and the \"story writing itself out\" in Shinto. Zoroastrians speak of the origin of the universe and the goal of salvation; their rituals reflect this reality. From an orthodox priestly point of view, the rituals should remain unchanged, as they reflect laws already in place. Like-wise, the mänthras are fixed - the Yasna consists of the recitation of 72 chapters. Basically the only alterations are in terms of the time and spe-cific occasions when the Yasna is performed, and these variations are usually said in undertone (bistaj and in Pazand, so as not to interrupt the framing power of the Avestan mänthra.16 Shinto's unfolding story, on the other hand, is mirrored in the tradi-tion's variations among shrines as to the content of even their daily litur-gies. Although there are some basic features common to all, such as the bowing and clapping and the waving of the haraigushi as a purification gesture, even in the highest liturgy of the year (the Ö Harae no kotoba celebrated on New Year's day and mid-year), some of the chants (nori-tos) by the chief priest are his compositions and written anew for each ritual occasion.17 The emergence of the new is reflected in the very con-duct of their liturgies. 16 Cf. Kotwal/Boyd, A Persian Offering, pp. 149-154. 17 Cf. Boyd/Williams, \"New Year's Rituals at Tsubaki Grand Shrine\", video docu-mentary."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"2.2.3 Ritual Ordering vs. Organizing Likewise, the Zoroastrian emphasis on morality, with moral principles guiding us in terms of good and evil, are continually reflected in their rituals. Again, to cite but two examples: in the Yasna high liturgy the mänthric praise of righteousness (ashem vohu), affirms the a prion order of the good creation, and the defeat of evil is dramatically expressed in the pounding of the höm and its accompanying mänthric recitations.18 Shinto, on the other hand, presents us with a ritual of decorum, with the priests and the shrine setting elaborately costumed and organized. Further, the daily message from the chief priest to the congregants (in the Chö Hai morning service) is one of encouraging a positive outlook on community life and efforts to organize the community to effect good en-counters.19 These, then, are but a few selected examples of some of the major differences in thought and practice between the Zoroastrian and Shinto traditions. 3. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ROLE OF AESTHETICS IN RITUAL THEORY 3.1 Lessons What this brief comparative analysis has shown us in terms of our previ-ous work on the aesthetics of Zoroastrian ritual is this. First, we note how easy it is to treat rituals as secondary to world views or religious texts. The preceding discussion began with a brief summary of the world views of two traditions and proceeded to relate ritual to them. Such an approach privileges thought over practice and makes the claim that ritu-als are in some sense sui generis more difficult to maintain. Secondly, this comparison reveals how tempting it is to assume that the aesthetic dimensions of rituals can be isolated and explored on their own. We compared the verticality of the Zoroastrian flower exchange with the horizontally of the Shinto shrine and torii gate in the above dis-cussion as isolatable aesthetic features reflective of their respective world views but otherwise as autonomous dimensions of the rituals and their settings. 18 Cf. Kotwal/Boyd, A Persian Offering, pp. 104-109. 19 Cf. Boyd/Williams, \"Japanese Shinto: An Interpretation of a Priestly Perspective.\""},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Regarding the first observation, there is no doubt that rituals do mir-ror a tradition's world view. Certainly Zoroastrian and Shinto liturgies could not be interchanged - even if rituals share some universal features. However, there are multiple dimensions to ritual, and the mirroring func-tion is only one. As we have argued previously in our analysis of Zoroas-trian liturgies, there are unique powers of ritual art. We will address the issue of the sui generis role of ritual art later in this essay.20 In regard to the second point, we admit to succumbing to the tempta-tion to treat the aesthetic dimension of rituals as if they could exist in isolation and to treat the ritual as a whole as an integrated artwork.21 However, our on-going study of Western art has shown us that our pre-vious work on Zoroastrian ritual lacked sufficient subtlety in this regard. More specifically, it has been our study of the aesthetic and ritualistic features of Christo's art that has helped us realize the extent to which artful means function only in intimate conjunction with other non-aesthetic features of ritual. Let us explore this more fully. 3.2 Aesthetic and Ritual Features of Christo's Art In 1976 Christo (and his wife Jeanne-Claude) produced The Running Fence Project, a short-lived, monumental installation in California first conceived in 1973 (cf. plates II/3).22 It was a white nylon \"fence\" 18 feet high and 24 miles long that for two weeks traversed the rolling hills and ranchlands of two counties north of San Francisco before dipping into the Pacific Ocean. The work's title is instructive. \"Project\" indicates Christo's intention that the work be understood as process rather than merely product. This is a major re-conception of an artwork broadening it to include so-cial/political factors traditionally excluded from the realm of the aes-thetic. As process, The Running Fence Project is complex and long-20 Cf. Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge: Aesthetic Theory and Zoroastrian Ritual, and Boyd/Williams, \"Artful Means: An Aesthetic View of Shinto Purification Rituals\", cf. fn. 32, below. 21 Even what counts as an aesthetic element or dimension of a ritual may vary over time or from one situation to another. For an example from the plastic arts, cf. Ν. Goodman, Ways of Worldmaking (Indianapolis/Indiana, 1978), pp. 57-70. We are in-debted to Jens Kreinath for this observation. 22 For a detailed description of Christo's project, cf. Β. Chernow, Christo and Jeanne-Claud·. A Biography (New York, 2002), chs. 11 and 12. Cf. also Maysles Broth-ers, \"Running Fence\", video documentary (58 minutes), 1977."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"lived; it includes the fence's conception, its aesthetic and engineering design, its financing, legitimization by local government agencies and the communities involved, and finally its construction, documentation, and disassembly. The process results in the short-lived aesthetic object, the fence, and then has an after-life in documentary films, books and museum displays and in the memories of those who participated, directly or as observers.23 Along the way, unanticipated events including legal challenges threatened its realization on more than one occasion. But, on the day called Blossoming Day the fabric was unfurled along its entire 24 mile length. By evening, it was a pink ribbon of light accenting the contours of the hills and reflecting the setting sun. What may not be immediately apparent is that both the fence and the extended process speak with one voice. It is a Tolstoyan voice; Tolstoy insisted that artworks ought to unify the community. Good artworks pro-duce \"one and the same effect: the loving union of people\".24 Christo's fence conveys unity and integration in several ways at once, connecting land with sea, earth with sky, and artifact with nature; and of course it literally connects the ranches as well rather than dividing them as fences normally do. The process itself powerfully integrates the community in its own way, since now the very evident cooperative feelings experi-enced by the workers are internal to the work (as process) and hence are part of what \"the work\" expresses. Note that what the work accomplishes is the result of a very complex interaction between the aesthetic features of the fence and the social/ po-litical/historical processes linked to it. For example, it both relies on capitalist modes of financing and construction while turning them to other than utilitarian uses, and it relies on the history of the winning of the West and the role of the fence in securing private property while at the same time reinterpreting the function of fence - from division to connection. 23 Perhaps the best parallel between Christo's work and traditional ritual practices is to view his several monumental projects as recurring festivals. 24 L.Tolstoy, What is art? trans. R. Pevear/Volokhonsky (London, 1995 [1898]), p. 130."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"3.3 Analogies with Ritual Artworks We hope this brief description makes plausible the following points we wish to make by analogy about certain features of Zoroastrian and Shinto ritual practice. We can expect considerable overlap between the complex functioning of a work like The Running Fence and the ways in which ritu-als function by employing \"artful means.\" This in spite of the obvious dis-tance between traditional religious rituals and avant-garde artworks. First, a ritual artwork is a multiplicity of incommensurable dimensions. The Christo example shows how ritual artworks are multiplicities in the technical sense introduced by Gilles Deleuze: a multiplicity is a set of lines or dimensions which are irreducible to one another.25 A brick wall consid-ered in itself is merely a complex structure made up of like parts. But a multiplicity contains elements of radically different kinds intersecting in radically different ways. Christo's work involves everything from engi-neering to community politics to financial institutions embedded in a capi-talistic social/political order. It involves the history of the West and the role of the fence in that history, as well as art's history, aesthetic theory, and the role of the media. Likewise ritual artworks involve a multiplicity of non-interchangeable dimensions. We begin with the aesthetic, but Christo's work shows that much more than that is at play in art and ritual.26 Secondly, a ritual artwork requires a context. To pursue the analogy, Christo's fence requires a complex art historical context allowing envi-ronmental works, process art, and performance art to be counted and un-derstood as art. His work also must function in the context of modem capitalist society since he relies on the same economic/political processes as someone coming to town to build a supermarket. Similarly, a set of religious ritual practices assumes an elaborate context possibly including sacred texts, and theological commentary, all embedded in a world view. It should be emphasized that artworks and their context as well as rituals and the world views in which they thrive are intimately integrated. Both the world view and the ritual are multiplicities interacting in an indefi-nitely large number of ways. 25 G. Deleuze/C. Parnet, Dialogues, trans. H. Tomlinson/B. Habberjam (New York, 1987), p. vu. 26 Cf. Turetzky, \"Pictorial Depth\", for a succinct example of an artwork as multiplic-ity. Even an ordinary painting is an assemblage (multiplicity) presenting a physical space (paint on canvas), an abstract mathematical space, and a pictorial space (which may, for example, exhibit depth unlike the canvas). These are co-existent, but irreduci-ble dimensions."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Thirdly, ritual artwork has a sui generis function. Although an art ork is embedded within its context, it does what only it can do. It is not re-placeable by some other dimension of the context or some other kind of thing or event. It is essential to Christo's fence project, for example, that the powers of capitalism and engineering be harnessed to cooperative aesthetic expression rather than to ordinary commerce. His work can thus rely on modern social structures, mirror them, and subtly turn them to other aesthetic/spiritual ends at the same time. That his is primarily an aesthetic event allows it to perform the unique set of intended functions. The similar point for ritual practice is this: such practices are not inde-pendent of the theological contexts that give them life and meaning, but the contribution rituals make, nothing else could make. This hypothesis guides our work, but it must be made plausible case by case. Finally, both rituals and artworks can be productive in a strong sense. What ritual practices accomplish, in part by aesthetic means, goes be-yond merely reflecting or decorating. In the complex interactions be-tween conceptual context and ritual practice, the latter is sometimes the more active partner, becoming a means of exploration or discovery or acting to transform persons, actions, and social structures. As Dastur 97 Kotwal asserted: \"The real coherence [of the tradition] is in ritual.\" 3.4 Application to Zoroastrian and Shinto Rituals As an example of ritual's being the more active partner, we have claimed in a previous study that Zoroastrian ritual mediates between universal principles and present application in a pro-active way.28 Consonant with the existence of transcendent, a priori principles, Zoroastrian liturgies are undertaken with the intention that they be performed unchanged. As we have said, this mirrors our situation as persons who can grasp the principles (up to a point) but did not create them; that is, we do not have the right to amend principles that are independent of us. But the inten-tion that rituals remain unchanged does not exclude the possibility that the practitioners themselves are the ones who change - they change via repeated exposure to unchanging ritual repetitions. Just, for example, as repeated exposure to Mozart might transform someone, the daily ritual becomes a \"companionable form\" like an exemplary friend who holds us to higher standards and challenges us to improve. 27 Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, p. 55. 28 Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, pp. 61 ff."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"In Ritual Art and Knowledge we traced this kind of change to the complex role of the basic image in the Äfrinagän - the flower ex-change.29 There are multiple interpretations of this gesture, but as an aes-thetic image it conveys an image of right communication. As a repeated image, it can act as a stabilizing image, focusing our attention on right communication, while at the same time introducing subtle mysteries that ultimately challenge us to rethink our understanding of the highest prin-ciples - thus serving as a mediator between a universal principle and specific daily concerns of the practitioner. However, in light of the Christo example and the lessons we draw from it, this analysis needs further refinement. For the integrated se-quence of the flower exchange now dissolves into a myriad of irreduci-ble dimensions. To put it boldly: there is no such thing as a ritual art-work about which one can ask \"What does it do?\" Rather, multiple ef-fects issue from the interaction of various aesthetic and non-aesthetic dimensions \"inside\" and \"external to\" the ritual. For example, with respect to the Äfrinagän, consider the moment in the flower exchange when one priest transfers a flower to the other priest. Now imagine a \"connective path\" leading from that aesthetic ele-ment to the simultaneous idea of \"good thoughts, words and deeds.\" That idea as part of the world view is a non-aesthetic element connected to aesthetic chanting of the Avestan phrase and thence to the priest him-self who has, perhaps, brought some daily concern to the ritual perform-ance. It is the combination of these disparate elements—one path among many—that may be subtly transformative for the priest or an onlooker at that moment. Such an analysis, in terms of intimately connected multiplicities, is not straightforwardly empirical - we are not investigating causes and effects at a particular place and time. Instead, and like the Christo exam-ple, we seek a plausible illustration of how the various elements com-bine, along multiple paths, to produce a range of results. This analytical approach can also be applied to Shinto rituals, which not only mirror the world view but are productive in ways owing to the unique contributions of their aesthetic dimensions. Because Shinto em-phasizes an ethic of good and bad encounters, it focuses on the task of organizing the world for the better. Consequently, Shinto's attention is on the present situation and possibilities for improvement. 29 Williams/Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge, pp. 118 ff."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"There are several important aspects of such efforts. Briefly, one needs to see the present situation freshly, with undistorted attention, to be em-powered to amend it, and to bring to bear on it appropriate elements from the tradition. We have argued elsewhere that different kinds of Shinto ritual activity are aimed at the different aspects of these processes of improvement.30 The liturgies present an aesthetic image of decorous activity ground-ed in the tradition; however, there is little in the liturgies that dictates either means or ends or fixed principles of moral behavior. In addition, insofar as these rituals in conjunction with ascetic practices are aimed at promoting healthful living and increasing energy, they are empowering, preparing the participants for the task of promoting good encounters. Finally, Shinto also has a rich and varied festival tradition combined with ascetic practices. These festivals are physically demanding and sometimes dangerous; they are more closely related to the sublime than to the decorous. Together with Shinto's emphasis on our immanent con-nections with the whole of Great Nature, they can have the effect of putting the practitioner in touch with the immanent unfolding creative powers of life, and those underlying intensities which generate persons and things. That is, among the forms of purification are the cultivation of states of attentiveness that are not mediated by language - thus experiencing, one might say, pure immanence, and creating the possibility for fresh vision. To offer a brief example: prior to a typical daily ritual, participants are invited to write down supplications that will be read aloud by the priest at a ceremony following the morning liturgy. These petitions ex-press individual concerns such as the wish for better health. The morning service itself contains the formal dance-like movements of the priests, ritual clapping, and brief recitations.31 There is also a gesture of purifica-tion and blessings bestowed on the participants and a final brief talk by the priest exhorting all to energetic and life-affirming action.32 The cere-30 Boyd/Williams, \"Japanese Shinto: An Interpretation of a Priestly Perspective.\" 31 The ancient liturgy being referred to is the Ο Harae no kotoba, a purification litany invoking peace and harmony in both the earthly and heavenly realms, removing all im-pediments that obstruct the creative powers of the cosmos, thereby allowing everyone and everything to realize their original brightness, beauty and purity. 32 Purification requires that the assistant priest take the haraigushi (a wooden stick with linen or paper streamers attached to it) and wave it, with a back and forth sweeping motion, over the offerings, the chief priest, and over all those in attendance. Cf. J.W. Boyd/R.G. Williams, \"Artful Means: An Aesthetic View of Shinto Purification Rituals\", Journal of Ritual Studies 13/1, 1999, pp. 37-52; J.W. Boyd/R.G. Williams, \"Shinto"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"mony ends with a communal drink of sake. Guided again by the example of Christo's Running Fence, we can imagine various conjunctions of the above elements - for example, a connective path leading from the participant's written supplication, a non-aesthetic element, to the beautiful images of decorous behavior and thence to exhortation to action and the community-affirming partaking of sake. The outcome for the individual will be the result of the interac-tion among these disparate elements and the worshipper. As long as one remains within the generalities of this model of ritual production, the actual mechanisms involved remain indistinct. What is intriguing and promising is the detailed analytical task of tracing the in-teractions among the many levels and dimensions of the ritual practices and the context to see how the work is done.

BEOBACHTUNGEN ZU WESTEUROPÄISCHEN UND ZOROASTRISCHEN BESTATTUNGEN Dorothea Lüddeckens Während die einen professionelle Klageweiber engagieren, verkünden andere den freudigen Anlass der Erlösung vom irdischen Dasein. Wo in manchen Häusern nur noch mit leiser Stimme ernsthaft gesprochen wer-den darf, wird in anderen die Komik geradezu gesucht. Die Vielfalt kul-tureller Eigenarten in der Reaktion auf den Tod eines Menschen ließe sich in ihrer Beschreibung endlos fortsetzen. So unterschiedlich diese Reaktionen weltweit ausfallen mögen, so verschieden die Bedeutung, die dem Tod zugemessen wird, auch sein mag, seine physische Dimension führt doch stets, innerhalb welchen kulturellen und religiösen Kontextes auch immer, zu bestimmten Herausforderungen und Konsequenzen.1 Diese allerdings werden kulturspezifisch gelöst und gedeutet. ABBRUCH UND KONTINUITÄT ANGESICHTS DES TODES Im Folgenden wird von der These ausgegangen, dass sowohl die Erfah-rung von Bruch als auch von Kontinuität zu der Konfrontation mit dem Tod eines anderen Menschen gehört.2 Die Erfahrung eines Bruches, im Sinne eines Ab-bruches ergibt sich für die Hinterbliebenen allein schon aus der mit dem Tod einhergehenden Veränderung des physischen Kör-pers des Toten. Unvermeidlich besitzt ein Leichnam nicht mehr diesel-ben Ausdrucksmöglichkeiten, die einem lebendigen Körper zur Verfü-gung stehen. Im Verständnis der Hinterbliebenen kann zwar ein toter Körper weiter zu den Lebenden sprechen', aber seine Sprache ist eine andere geworden. So ist es beispielsweise möglich die Dynamik von Verwesungsprozessen als Mitteilung zu interpretieren. Niemand wird 1 Zu denken ist dabei z.B. an den Umgang mit dem toten Körper und den beginnen-den Verwesungsprozessen. 2 Hier und im Folgenden werden die Begriffe Erfahrung und Wahrnehmung in ihrem alltagssprachlichen Verständnis verwendet."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"jedoch bestreiten, dass es sich dabei um eine andere Art der Kommuni-kation handelt, als diejenige, die mit dem Verstorbenen vor seinem Tod möglich war. Was für den soziokommunikativen Bereich gilt, gilt auch für andere Ebenen, da die Handlungsfähigkeit eines physischen Körpers mit dem Tod grundlegend verändert, wenn nicht sogar in vielen Berei-chen abgebrochen ist: Eine bestimmte Form physischer Existenz hat für die Hinterbliebenen damit unübersehbar ein Ende gefunden. Neben dem Ab-bruch ist jedoch auch Kontinuität ein menschlicher Erfahrungshorizont in der Konfrontation mit dem Tod Anderer. Ein Mensch wird in der Wahrnehmung seiner Umgebung mit seinem Tod nicht vollkommen ausgelöscht. In Todesanzeigen finden sich häufig Formulierungen, die beidem Ausdruck geben: der Erfahrung des Abbru-ches und zugleich der Kontinuität. „Eine Stimme, die uns vertraut war, schweigt. Ein Mensch, der immer für uns da war, lebt nicht mehr, doch immer sind irgendwo Spuren seines Lebens.\"3 „Es gibt nicht genügend Worte, die Dich beschreiben und unseren Verlust ausdrücken können. In unseren Herzen lebst du weiter.\"4 Deutlich wird hier jeweils der Bruch angezeigt: das Abbrechen einer Stimme, das nicht mehr Da-Sein eines Menschen und der Verlust, der das Aussagbare sprengt. Im Kontrast hierzu wird jedoch Kontinuität versichert, die Toten sind demnach in der Wirklichkeit der Lebenden nicht vollkommen ausgelöscht, selbst nach dem Tod eines Menschen existieren die Folgen seines Lebens, Men-schen, Gedanken und Gefühle, die mit dem Verstorbenen verbunden sind, weiter. Menschliche Erfahrung und Wahrnehmung ist geprägt von den je-weiligen kulturellen Deutungsmustem, die zugleich eben diese Erfah-rungen und Wahrnehmungen für den Einzelnen einordbar werden las-sen. Deutungsmuster sind kulturelle Konstruktionen, die unter anderem durch Mythen und Rituale zur Verfügung gestellt werden. So wird es dem Einzelnen und der Gesellschaft ermöglicht, Erfahrungen und Wahrnehmungen in einen Gesamtzusammenhang einzuordnen und ih-nen durch Handlungen Ausdruck zu verleihen. Mythen und Rituale sind damit sowohl Ausdruck als auch Gestaltung menschlicher Erfahrung und Wahrnehmung. Die unterschiedlichen wechselseitigen Beziehungen zwischen Erfah-rungen und konstruierten Deutungsmustem sollen hier nicht weiter ent-faltet und diskutiert werden. Entscheidend ist vielmehr die These, dass 3 Todesanzeige für Peter Breitschädel, Frankfurter Rundschau, 15.4.2002, p. 23. 4 Todesanzeige für Julius Giske, Jüdische Allgemeine Nr. 21/11.10.2001, p. 10."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"für die Hinterbliebenen mit dem Tod eines Menschen sowohl Abbruch als auch Kontinuität verbunden sind. Beides wird innerhalb konstruierter Deutungsmuster wahrgenommen und zu einem umfassenden in Weltbild in Bezug gesetzt, bzw. hierin eingeordnet. Dabei ist es fur den Einzelnen möglich, die Erfahrung von Bruch und Kontinuität unabhängig von ei-nem ausgeführten Ritual oder auch erst mit der Teilhabe5 am Ritual zu erleben. So universal das Phänomen des physischen Todes auf den ersten Blick auch erscheinen mag, die kulturellen Deutungen, die Konstruktionen, mit Hilfe derer Bruch und Kontinuität gestaltet, erfahren und erklärt werden, sind höchst unterschiedlich. Auch die jeweilige Gewichtung ist verschie-den: Konstruktionen von Bruch und Kontinuität können schwächer oder auch stärker vorliegen. Während manche Traditionen den sich aus dem physischen Tod ergebenden Bruch betonen, versuchen andere ihn weitge-hend zu ignorieren. Ebenso kann die Kontinuität sehr stark wahrgenom-men oder auch explizit in vieler Hinsicht negiert werden. Dementspre-chend werden in Mythen und Ritualen Bruch und Kontinuität hervorgeho-ben dargestellt oder auch nur sehr schwach in Szene gesetzt. Ein Kulminationspunkt dieser jeweiligen Konstruktionen, innerhalb derer Erfahrungen für den Einzelnen eingeordnet werden können, sind Bestattungsrituale, oder etwas weiter gefasst, Todesrituale.6 Im Folgenden soll zum einen gezeigt werden, wie sich sowohl Bruch-ais auch Kontinuitäts-Konstruktionen in Todesritualen analysieren las-sen. Zum andern soll der Frage nachgegangen werden, inwiefern beide Konstruktionen miteinander verbunden sind. Daran schließt sich die Frage, ob sich eine gegenseitige Bedingtheit feststellen lässt, d.h. ob sich einerseits bei einer starken Betonung des Bruches auch eine starke Beto-nung der Kontinuität findet und ob andererseits schwache Kontinuitäts-Konstruktionen auch schwache Bruch-Konstruktionen zur Folge haben.

Mit Recht wird von kritischen Rezensenten nach modernen Projektionen gefragt und zuweilen die Art der Quellenbearbeitung angezweifelt.8 Ob der Tod in der modernen westeuropäischen Gesellschaft tatsächlich stärker als ,früher' verdrängt oder gar ,tabuisiert' wird, sei dahingestellt. Allerdings ist sich die For-schung in der Frage, „in welcher Weise sich die Erfahrung des Todes unter dem Einfluß der Moderne gewandelt hat\"9, in mancher Hinsicht einig.

Weder fur Sterbende noch für Hinterbliebene gibt es noch allgemein anerkannte Regeln. Sicherlich kann die schwindende Präsenz zahlreicher Rituale rund um den Tod mit dem Verlust allgemein verbindlicher Sinnsysteme in der Moderne in Zusammenhang gebracht werden. Dennoch ist es be-rechtigt zu fragen, ob es noch weitere Gründe dafür gibt, warum man-ches, sobald dies ohne soziale Restriktionen möglich wird, aufgegeben wurde oder wird. Während noch vor einigen Jahrzehnten auch in Groß-städten schwarze Kleidung bei Beerdigungen eine Selbstverständlichkeit war,\" ist es heutzutage durchaus üblich, ohne explizite Trauerkleidung auf dem Friedhof zu erscheinen. Während mit dem Tragen von Schwarz nahe Angehörige in ihrem ersten Trauerjahr einen Hinweis auf das Ge-schehene gaben, sind Betroffene heute an ihrer Kleidung nicht mehr zu erkennen. Könnte man darin einen Versuch sehen, den durch den Tod evozierten Bruch zu nivellieren? Weitere Anzeichen scheinen auf eine Verflachung von Bruch-Kons-truktionen hinzuweisen: Immer öfter werden Bestattungsinstitute gebe-ten, ihre Leichenwägen nicht als solche zu kennzeichnen.12 Ebenso mag der Hinweis in Todesanzeigen, die Bestattung werde „in aller Stille\" stattfinden oder auch die Bitte „von Beileidsbezeugungen\" Abstand zu nehmen auf den Wunsch hindeuten, möglichst unbemerkt und ohne aus-drückliche Anteilname den Todesfall vorübergehen zu lassen. In christlichen Bestattungen wird der Bruch, das Ende des individuel-len physischen Lebens, unter anderem durch die am offenen Grab rezi-tierte Ritualformel „Erde zu Erde, Staub zum Staube, Asche zu Asche\" zum Ausdruck gebracht. Der Körper ist nunmehr unbelebte Materie, die dem Erdreich überantwortet wird.

Nachvollzogen wird bzw. wurde die Formel, indem die Mitglieder der Trauergemeinde den Sarg mit Sand oder Erde bewerfen. Stattdessen werden in den letzten Jahren immer häufiger Blumen auf den Sarg ge-worfen.13 Die Konstruktion des Bruches wird damit abgeschwächt, da Blumen z.B. auch bei Hochzeiten gestreut werden bzw. über das Braut-paar ,schneien', während mit Erde nur ein Toter beworfen wird, jemand, der tatsächlich be-erdigt wird. Rituale und Ritualbausteine, die die Erfahrung und Wahrnehmung des Bruches zum Ausdruck bringen, scheinen innerhalb der letzten Jahr-zehnte seltener zu werden. „Die Gesellschaft legt keine Pause mehr ein\" beschreibt Philippe Ariès unsere westeuropäische Gegenwart und spricht von „sehr zurückhaltende[n] Leichenbegräbnisse[n]\".14 Nicht nur der rituelle Umgang mit dem Tod hat sich verändert, auch seine Mythen, die Konzeptionen seiner Bedeutung sind andere gewor-den. Dieser Wandel drückt sich zum Beispiel in dem Glauben an ein Weiterleben nach dem Tod aus. Einer Meinungsumfrage zufolge glaub-ten in den 70er Jahren nur noch 48% aller evangelischen und katholi-schen Kirchenmitglieder an ein Leben nach dem Tod.15 Selbst ohne sta-tistische Vergleichswerte ist wohl anzunehmen, dass diese Zahl im 19. Jahrhundert höher lag. Allerdings kann, nach verschiedenen neueren Umfrageergebnissen zu urteilen, nicht vorschnell von einer weiteren, generellen Abnahme des Glaubens an ein Leben nach dem Tod ausge-gangen werden.16 Tatsächlich jedoch erschwert die Pluralisierung und Segmentierung von Sinnwelten und Sub-sinnwelten eine einheitliche Sinnintegration durch eine übergeordnete sym-bolische Sinnwelt. Eine übergreifende Legitimation des Todes scheint nicht 13 Diese und ähnliche Beobachtungen berichteten mir mehrere Pfarrer verschiedener deutscher Landeskirchen. 14 Ariès, Geschichte des Todes, pp. 715-740.

Zum Teil sind statt der Kirchen andere religiöse Institutionen und statt des Christentums andere Traditionen relevant geworden.19 Für die vielen Mit-glieder der westdeutschen Gesellschaft gilt, dass ihre Wirklichkeitsdeutun-gen, sofern diese sich auf den Tod beziehen, zum einen individueller, zum andern aber auch diffuser und vager geworden sind. Aussagen wie „Ich glaub' schon, dass da noch was kommt\" oder auch: „Irgendwie kann ja nicht alles zu Ende sein\" implizieren offensichtlich die Annahme einer über den Tod hinaus bestehenden Kontinuität. Deutlich wird in ihnen aber auch, dass für die Wahrnehmung von Kontinuität keine ausgeprägten Kon-zeptionen vorliegen, auf die im Bedarfsfall zurückgegriffen werden könnte. Neben den differenzierten religiösen Konzepten für ein Leben nach dem Tod hat auch die Bedeutung familiärer Kontinuitäten abgenommen. Die früher in Deutschland in vielen Kreisen übliche Sitte, Kindern Vor-namen der Eltern oder Großeltern zumindest als zweiten Namen weiter-zugeben, ist aufgegeben worden.20 Bewusstsein und Interesse an familiä-ren Genealogien haben abgenommen und erzählte Familiengeschichte engt sich immer mehr auf wenige Generationen ein. In diesen Zusam-menhang ist auch folgender Wandel in der Bestattungskultur zu stellen: Schwindende familiäre Verbindungen lassen das traditionelle Familiengrab als überholt erscheinen; der Zusammenhang von Tod und Erinnerung in sei-ner bisherigen, an Grabstätten orientierten Form verliert zunehmend an Bedeutung. Die anonyme Bestattung ist jetzt schon Bestandteil einerneuen Trauerkultur, die anonymen Urnenhaine, an denen Blumenschmuck hinter-legt werden kann, sind zu einem neuen, kollektiven Ort der Trauer auf den städtischen Friedhöfen geworden.21 17 Roth, Die Beerdigungsansprache, p. 42. 18 Roth, Die Beerdigungsansprache, p. 52. 19 Neben dem Christentum haben natürlich auch andere traditionelle religiöse Tradi-tionen an Bedeutung verloren. 20 M.

Dabei handelt es sich um das Phänomen unkonventionell und sehr individuell gestalteter Beerdigun-gen, das sich unter anderem bei Angehörigen der Schwulen- und Les-benszene oder auch in esoterisch orientierten Kreisen findet.22 Neben sehr klaren Symbolen des Abschiedes und der Trennung finden sich hier starke Ausdrucksweisen von Kontinuität - so werden z.B. Briefe an die Toten geschrieben und rituell verbrannt oder auch bei der Beerdigung besondere, mit dem Toten verbundene Gegenstände als Andenken an die Trauergemeinde verteilt. Ein Beispiel für das Zusammenkommen von starken Kontinuitäts-und Bruch-Konstruktionen bietet folgende Beschreibung: Nun liegt die Tochter, reichlich von ihren Mitschülern und Freunden beschenkt, in einem Sarg voller Blumen, so dass von der weißen Dekke [sie] nichts mehr zu sehen ist. Im Arm hat sie einen Stapel Briefe mit letzten Grüßen... Von derselben Beerdigung wird berichtet, dass die Mutter auf Anregung der Bestatterin den Sarg nach der Aufbahrung selbst geschlossen habe: Mit dieser Unterstützung gelang es der Mutter, den Sargdeckel zu schlie-ßen. Dabei fielen noch ein paar Blumen zu Boden. Die hat sie dann Julia [der Schwester der Verstorbenen] mitgebracht als letzten Gruß von Birgit.23 In dieser Darstellung finden sich zwei Kommunikationsformen, zum ei-nen die Briefe an die Tote, zum andern der Blumengruß von der Ver-storbenen an ihre Schwester. Während damit jeweils Kontinuitäts-Konstruktionen gegeben sind, wird mit dem eigenhändigen Schließen des Sarges durch die Mutter das Bewusstsein des vorhandenen Bruches deutlich. Sowohl Deutungsmuster der Kontinuität als auch des Bruches wurden hier offensichtlich rituell inszeniert. 22 Siehe hierzu z.B. N.

Außerdem finden sich dort mehrere als bangli bezeichnete Gebäude, die mit einem Waschraum, einer großen Halle und zum Teil mit Unter-kunftsmöglichkeiten für Angehörige ausgestattet sind. Hinzu kommen Verwaltungseinrichtungen und ein Gebäude mit einem kleinen Ritual-feuer in der Nähe der Türme (sagri). Nach dem Eintreten des physischen Todes wird heutzutage in Bom-bay möglichst schnell der Leichnam von den Leichenmeistern, den nase-salars, abgeholt und zu den Bestattungsanlagen gefahren.25 Dort wird er in einem der banglis abgelegt, in dem alle folgenden Rituale bis zum Forttragen der Leiche zum dakhma abgehalten werden. Wesentliche Ele-mente sind hier die Waschung und erneute Einkleidung des Toten (sach-kar), die Hundebeschau (sagdid), bei der ein Hund animiert wird, die Leiche anzusehen, sowie das im folgenden noch näher beschriebene geh-sarna-Ritual. Anschließend wird von allen Anwesenden dem Toten noch im bangli ,die Ehre erwiesen', indem alle am Leichnam vorbeigehen und sich vor ihm verbeugen.

Während sich die Priester und Laien nun vom Turm abwenden und sich im sagri versammeln, betreten die nasesalars den Turm und legen den toten Körper in einem für ihn vorgesehenen Bereich ab. Von dem Abschluss dieser Handlung informieren sie die Hinterbliebenen durch lautes Klatschen, das bis zum sagri zu hören ist. Diesen Ritualen, die noch vor Einbruch der Dunkelheit stattzufinden haben, folgen drei weitere durch Rituale geprägte Tage, während derer die Angehörigen auf dem Bestattungsgelände bleiben können. Eine be-sondere Rolle spielt die fünfte und letzte liturgische Tageszeit (zwischen Mittemacht und Sonnenaufgang) des dritten Tages, in der ein uthamna-Ritual abgehalten wird.26 Während dieses Ritual zumindest im Beisein der näheren Verwandtschaft in der Regel im bangli abgehalten wird, sol-len im Idealfall für dieselbe Zeit weitere Rituale in einem Tempel in Auftrag gegeben werden, ohne dass die Hinterbliebenen daran teilneh-men.

Abgrenzungen und Ent-räumlichungen: Konstruktionen des Bruches In der zoroastrischen Bestattungspraxis der physische Körper mit dem durch den Tod erfahrenen Bruch verbunden, während die den Tod über-lebende Seele für die Kontinuität steht. Am Umgang mit dem toten Kör-per zeigt sich die rituelle Konstruktion dieser Erfahrung des Abbruches. Der Bruch zwischen dem Leben und dem Tod findet seinen räumlichen Ausdruck in der schrittweisen Entfernung der Leiche von bzw. aus dem Bereich der Lebenden. Im zoroastrischen Ritual, so wie es heute bei den meisten Familien in Bombay ausgeführt wird, geschieht diese Ausgren-zung sowohl in Hinsicht auf den die Leiche umgebenden Raum als auch in Hinsicht auf die Distanzierung der Lebenden vom Leichnam selbst. Mit der Überführung des toten Körpers auf das Gelände der Bestat-tungsanlagen wird der Verstorbene aus seinem unmittelbaren Lebensum-feld herausgenommen und in ein von diesem deutlich abgegrenzten Ge-lände gebracht. Nach dem Waschen und Einkleiden erfolgt eine weitere Ab- bzw. Ausgrenzung, indem in der Halle des banglis drei Kreise (kas-has) um die Leiche gezogen werden. Es handelt sich hier um eine klare, zeitlich begrenzte Markierungslinie, die den bezüglich der Leiche einzu-haltenden Abstand flir die Lebenden anzeigt. So wird der tote Körper innerhalb des banglis, in dem er sich gemeinsam mit den Lebenden be-findet, von diesen ab- bzw. ausgegrenzt. Eine weitere räumliche Distan-zierung geschieht mit dem Forttragen des Leichnams zu den Türmen des Schweigens. Der Wegabschnitt von den banglis bis hin zu den Türmen darf von Nicht-Zoroastriern nicht betreten werden. Auch von Frauen wurde er bis vor einigen Jahren gemieden, und bis heute halten sich die meisten Zoroastrierinnen an diese Regel. Der Leichnam wird nach dem geh-sarna-Ritual aus dem bangli, dem Raum, den die toten Körper mit den Lebenden noch teilen, hin zum dakhma getragen, zu dem Ort, der einzig und allein den toten Körpern vorbehalten ist. Die ,Macht des To-des' ist in diesem Zeit-Raum bereits nicht nur an den Leichnam selbst 29 Einzige Ausnahme nach Michael Stausberg sind die so genannten Fereshte-Zere-monien, die von manchen indischen Priestern einzig flir Lebende ausgeführt werden; Stausberg, Die Religion Zarathustras III."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"gebunden, sondern räumlich so präsent, dass weder Frauen noch Nicht -Zoroastrier dem ausgesetzt werden dürfen.30 Am dakhma angekommen, öffnen die nasesalars das Tor zum Turm und tragen die Leiche hinein. Niemand darf ihnen folgen, der Zutritt zum Turm ist allen verboten, außer den nasesalars,31 die in der Gesell-schaft der Parsen eine abgesonderte Stellung einnehmen. Hier befindet sich die Leiche nun endgültig innerhalb eines Raumes, der nicht mehr in den Bereich der Lebenden gehört. Die räumliche Aus- bzw. Abgrenzung des toten Körpers ist damit je-doch noch nicht abgeschlossen und gerade hierin liegt die Besonderheit des zoroastrischen Rituals der Leichenaussetzung. Der physische Körper erfährt vielmehr eine bewusst möglichst rasch und konsequent herbeige-führte Auflösung. Er wird also nicht nur in einen von dem Raum der Le-benden abgegrenzten Raum der Toten überführt, sondern wird sozusa-gen ent-räumlicht. Im Idealfall fressen ihn innerhalb kurzer Zeit Geier und Krähen auf, sodass nur noch die Knochen übrig bleiben. Die Dicho-tomie zwischen fortbestehenden Knochen und vergänglichen weichen Körperteilen, wie sie sich in manchen ritualtheoretischen Analysen von Todesritualen findet,32 wird hier nicht angetroffen. Denn auch die Kno-chen werden durch die Sonnenhitze zu Staub und vom Regen in die Mit-te des Turmes gespült, wo sie durch einen Filter ins Erdreich gelangen. Da es aus zoroastrischer Perspektive allerdings von großer Wichtigkeit ist, die Elemente, also auch die Erde, nicht mit Leichen zu verunreini-gen, wird hier deutlich, dass dieser Knochenstaub offensichtlich nicht mehr als Leichenmaterie angesehen wird. Zwar wurde in den von mir geführten Gesprächen immer wieder der Kreislauf betont, der mit dieser Prozedur gegeben sei. Eine vorschnelle Assoziation mit dem jüdisch-christlichen „Erde zu Erde, Staub zum Staube und Asche zu Asche\" wä-re aber ein großes Missverständnis. Denn hier geschieht dies in einer meines Erachtens wesentlichen Vermittlung: Zum einen sind es die Tie-re, durch deren Verdauungsorganismus hindurch der menschliche Kör-per nur mittelbar in die Erde eingeht und damit seine Existenz als 30 In ihren Erklärungen legten meine Informanten Wert darauf, dass es bei dieser Vorschrift um den Schutz der betreffenden Personen ginge. 31 Eine Ausnahme bilden hier nur die Reinigungsarbeiten in den Türmen, die in ge-wissen Abständen stattfinden müssen. 32 So ζ. B. bei Robert Hertz: „... the reduction of the corpse to bones, which are more or less unchangeable and upon which death will have no further hold, ...\" R.

Zum andern ist es die Sonne, die die Knochen zu Staub zerfallen lässt. Während eine Erdbestattung einen langsamen Prozess der Verwesung im Erdreich nach sich zieht, innerhalb dessen der Körper sich langsam auflöst und zudem als Knochengerüst noch lange übrig bleibt, geschieht hier die Auflösung des Körpers, bevor die Materie überhaupt in die Erde gelangt. Kein langsamer Akt der Verwesung, sondern ein rascher Akt der Zerstörung wird im Ritual der Leichenaussetzung angestrebt: The nasâsâlârs then take away the clothes and leave the Tower, so that the body may be quickly consumed by the vultures. It takes about thirty minutes for the large vultures to eat up the flesh completely so that further decompo-sition of the body is immediately arrested.33 Es ist kein Körper, keine Leiche, die Eingang in die Erde findet, sondern Staub und von den Vögeln verdautes Fleisch. Der tote Körper nimmt als Körper, nachdem er diesen Prozess durchlaufen hat, keinen Raum mehr ein, er ist ent-räumlicht. Weitere im Ritual gestaltete Abgrenzungen des Leichnams von den Lebenden zeigen sich im direkten Umgang mit dem toten Körper und der dort zu beobachtenden Distanzierung. So soll die Leiche direkt nach dem Eintreten des physischen Todes noch von den Angehörigen berührt werden. Nach dem Waschen und Einkleiden (sachkar) darf dies jedoch nicht mehr geschehen, von da an stehen nur noch die Leichenmeister in körperlichem Bezug zur Leiche. Alle anderen haben einen bestimmten Abstand zur Leiche einzuhalten, der im bangli durch die bereits erwähn-ten kashas festgelegt ist. Während der Prozession zum dakhma wahren alle Teilnehmer außer den nasesalars eine Distanz von viereinhalb Metern. Das Überdauern des Todes und die Verbindung zum Toten: Kontinui-täts-Konstruktionen Erinnerungen an einen Menschen und die geistige Auseinandersetzung mit seiner Person werden mit dessen Tod nicht beendet, ebenso wenig wie die ,Folgen' eines Lebens, Hinterlassenschaften oder auch Nach-kommen durch den Tod ihres , Verursachers' ausgelöscht werden. Viel-mehr wird all dies in einer Kontinuität über den Tod hinaus wahrge-nommen, genauer in einer gebrochenen Kontinuität. 33 Dhalla, „Funeral Customs and Ceremonies of the Parsis in India\", p. 20."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"Die Konstruktionen, innerhalb derer diese Erfahrungen von Kontinui-tät wahrgenommen und in einen größeren Kontext eingeordnet werden, können auf sehr unterschiedlichen Ebenen geleistet werden. Möglich ist dies z.B. mit Konzeptionen von Familiengeschichte, durch die sich das einzelne Familienmitglied in einer langen Kette von Vorfahren und zu-künftigen Nachfahren aufgehoben weiß. Ebenso können Seelenvorstel-lungen bzw. Individualeschatologien als Wahrnehmungsmuster für Kon-tinuität realisiert werden. Im Fall des Zoroastrismus, wie ich ihn durch meine Informanten in Bombay kennen gelernt habe, sind Vorstellungen eines Weiterlebens der Seele34 nach dem Tod für die Wahrnehmung von Kontinuität von großer Bedeutung. Hinzu kommt die Erfahrung andauernder gegenseitiger Be-ziehungen zwischen Lebenden und Verstorbenen, die in Todes- bzw. Bestattungsritualen gestaltet werden.35 Dabei können die individuellen ,Erlösungsvorstellungen' nicht vom rituellen Vollzug getrennt werden, denn die Rituale werden zumindest als Unterstützung, in der Regel aber sogar als notwendig für die Ermöglichung der erwünschten Individual-eschatologie verstanden. Die durchgeführten Rituale und das Schicksal der Seele nach dem physischen Tod des Körpers sind so aufs engste mit-einander verbunden. Für die Wahrnehmung einer starken Kontinuität ist es für die Betrof-fenen nicht unbedingt erforderlich, eine reflektierte, theologisch begrün-dete und komplexe Theorie zu besitzen. Meine Informanten und die von mir bearbeitete Literatur verwenden häufig in engem Zusammenhang mit dem Terminus Seele den Begrifffravashi. Vor allem von Laien wird selten deutlich zwischen Seele und fravashi differenziert. Tendenziell läßt sich jedoch sagen, dass als Seele (urvan) eine dem Menschen zu-nächst inhärente Wesenheit bezeichnet wird, die unabhängig vom physi-34 Im Folgenden wird mit Seele der emische bzw. objektsprachliche Begriff soul über-setzt, der von meinen Informanten und der neueren indisch-zoroastrischen Literatur verwendet wird. Mit diesem englischen Begriff soll in der Regel der indigene Terminus urvan ausgedrückt werden. 35 „According to Zoroastrianism the association between the deceased and his be-loved relatives continues after death. If the survivors cherish his memory and endeavour to please the departed with their good thoughts, words and deeds, then the departed guide and help the living in their own inscrutable ways.\" Und etwas später: „On these occasions [Die Zeremonien am vierten, zehnten und dreißigsten Tag nach dem Tod, sowie an den Jahrestagen] the survivors remember the departed with love and respect and pray that the soul may not only find solace but may also progress in the world be-yond.\" Dhalla, „Funeral Customs and Ceremonies of the Parsis in India\", p. 42."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"sehen Tod des Körpers fortexistiert, mit ihm aber weiterhin in gewisser Weise in Verbindung steht. Die fravashi hingegen wird eher als ein zu-gehöriges Gegenüber aufgefasst und oft als „guardian spirit\" oder auch „guardian angel\" beschrieben. Sie gilt als Orientierung gebende, indivi-duelle Instanz für den Menschen bzw. für seine Seele. Physischer Körper, Seele bzw. fravashi und ritueller Vollzug stehen während der ersten vier Tage nach dem Eintritt des physischen Todes in einem engen Beziehungsgeflecht miteinander. Dabei wird von den Hinterbliebenen der Kontakt zur Seele des Verstorbenen aufrechterhal-ten, bzw. aufgebaut, der Kontakt zu seinem physischen Körper jedoch schrittweise abgebrochen. Aus der Sicht der Teilnehmer findet parallel dazu auch ein Lösungs- und Angliederungsprozess auf Seiten des Ver-storbenen statt. Während letzterer die irdische Welt hinter sich zurück-lässt, schließt er sich der jenseitigen Welt an. All dies wird im Ritual gestaltet bzw. durch das Ritual unterstützt, wenn nicht sogar erst ermög-licht. Kontinuität wird so auf zwei Ebenen konstruiert: Zum einen besteht in der Weiterexistenz von Seele und fravashi ein individuelles Überdau-ern des physischen Todes, zum anderen wird die Beziehung zwischen Lebenden und Verstorbenen aufrechterhalten. Letzteres geschieht in den Ritualen durch die direkte Ansprache der Seelen bzw. fravashis oder auch bestimmter Wesenheiten, die mit dem Wohlergehen der Seelen bzw.fravashis in Verbindung gebracht werden. Besonders intensiv wird der Kontakt während der ersten vier Tage gehalten, aber auch lange dar-über hinaus. Einige Familien lassen noch fünfzig Jahre nach dem Tod eines Verwandten jährliche Zeremonien vollziehen, üblich ist es zumin-dest in den folgenden vier Jahren. Unter anderem vom vierten bis zum zehnten Tag nach dem Todestag werden stam-Rituale durchgeführt. Mit allen anderen fravashis wird auch der Verstorbene angesprochen, dessen fravashi und Seele das Ritu-al im Besonderen gewidmet ist. Neben der Rezitation von Yasna 26 spielt eine zeremonielle Mahlzeit eine entscheidende Rolle. Die Seele des Toten soll mit dem Ritual ,versorgt' und während ihres Gerichtes und der folgenden Jenseitsreise unterstützt werden. Die gegenseitige Be-ziehung zwischen Verstorbenen und Hinterbliebenen wird in dem stum-Ritual besonders zum Ausdruck gebracht. Die fravashis der Toten bitten die Lebenden um ihre Fürsorge: „Who will laud, venerate, extol, bless us? Who will welcome us with hands bearing food and clothes, with cor-"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"rectly ordered praise?...\"36 So wie die Seelen und fravashis von den Hin-terbliebenen Fürsorge erfahren, so rechnen die Lebenden mit dem Segen der Toten. Während der stam-Rituale und der jährlichen muktad-Zere-monien wird von einer Anwesenheit, einer ,Rückkehr' fravashis in die irdische Welt ausgegangen. Kotwal und Choksy betonen in ihrem Auf-satz im vorliegenden Band die enge Verbindung zwischen Lebenden und Toten: „The ritual [das stam-Ritual], like other Zoroastrian rites involv-ing both order and afterlife, create in the minds of devotees a pious nexus between the living and the dead across the corporeal and the spiri-tual realms\".37 Kontinuität als „Framing\" des Bruches innerhalb des Ritualkomplexes Kontinuität wird auch innerhalb der Struktur des gesamten Ritualkom-plexes konstruiert. Dieser gliedert sich in verschiedene Abschnitte, die zum Teil die rituelle Konstruktion des Bruches darstellen. Diese ,Bruch-stellen' werden jedoch von einer Kontinuität gewissermaßen eingerahmt. Bereits der physische Tod, die Bruchstelle, die die Ursache für die folgenden rituellen Konstruktionen bildet, wird in manchen Familien von einer Kontinuität sozusagen unterlegt. Schon vor Eintritt des Todes wird ein Öllämpchen angezündet und mit der Rezitation des ashem vo-hun begonnen. Weder wird nun die Rezitation mit dem Tod abgebro-chen noch wird das Öllämpchen gelöscht, sondern beides wird darüber hinaus noch für einige Zeit beibehalten. In ähnlicher Weise treffen Bruch und Kontinuität im Ritual bei dem sogenannten geh-sarna-Ritual im bangli zusammen. Die Priester begin-nen ca eine Stunde vor dem Forttragen der Leiche zum dakhma mit dem Ritual. Sie rezitieren die erste Gatha (ahunavaiti gatha) Yasna 28-34,39 wobei sie bei Yasna 31.4 ihren Vortrag unterbrechen. Nun heben die nasesalars die auf einer Steinplattform liegende Leiche auf die Toten-bahre. Während dieser Handlung wenden alle Teilnehmer—Priester und 36 F.M. Kotwal/J.K. Choksy, „To Praise the Souls of the Deceased and the Immortal Spirits of the Righteous Ones: The Staomi or Stum Ritual\", in diesem Band, S. 391. 37 Kotwal/Choksy, „To Praise the Souls of the Deceased and the Immortal Spirits of the Righteous Ones: The Staomi or Stum Ritual\", S. 391. 38 Diese innerhalb zoroastrischer Ritualpraxis häufig rezitierte altavestische Sakral-formel findet sich in den Yasna 27, 14. Viele Parsen sehen sie als von Zarathustra stam-mendes Gebet an. 39 Die altavestischen Gatha werden von den Parsen auf Zarathustra zurückgeführt."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Laien—die Blicke ab, was mit der durch die Leiche bei Bewegung in besonderem Maße ausgehenden Infektionsgefahr begründet wird.40 Der tote Körper wird also während der Umbettung in ganz besonderer Weise mit dem Bereich Ahrimans4] identifiziert und die Konstruktion des Bru-ches mit ihrer zoroastrischen Konzeption des Einbruchs der Kräfte Ah-rimans in die Welt Ahura mazdas findet hier wiederum ihren rituellen Ausdruck. Nach dieser gefahrvollen Umbettung und einer anschließen-den Hundebeschau (sagdid) fahren die Priester mit der Rezitation der ahunavaiti gatha fort. So rahmt die Ga^a-Rezitation den mit der rituel-len Umbettung zum Ausdruck kommenden Bruch ein. Eine dritte Verschränkung von Kontinuität und Bruch findet sich in dem Zeit-Raum, in dem die Leiche vom bangli zum Turm getragen wird. Hier verlässt der Leichnam den Bereich der Lebenden und bewegt sich auf den Bereich der toten Körper, den dakhma, zu. Die Seele geht diesen Weg nach Ansicht vieler Zoroastrier nicht mehr mit, sie verweilt am bangli, an dem Ort, an dem die letzten Zeremonien für den Verstorbenen stattgefunden haben. Körper und Seele haben sich nun bis zu einem ge-wissen Grad räumlich voneinander getrennt. So steht dieser Weg- und Zeitabschnitt, vom Verlassen des bangli bis zur Ablage der Leiche im Turm, für den Bruch. Alle diejenigen, die der Leiche auf dem Weg zum dakhma folgen nehmen den baj, d.h. sie rezitieren den Anfang eines Ge-betstextes und treten in rituelle Verbindung.42 Wenn sie durch das Klat-schen der nasesalars von der abgeschlossenen Niederlegung der Leiche im Turm benachrichtigt werden, rezitieren sie den zweiten Teil des baj-Textes und lösen die rituelle Verbindung. So wird auch hier die rituelle Darstellung des Bruches durch eine rituelle Konstruktion von Kontinui-tät eingerahmt. 40 „The priests turn their faces away, for it is believed that if eye contact takes place between the priests and the corpse demons, then affliction and harm may befall the priests.\" Mistree, Zoroastrianism. An Ethnic Perspective, p. 57. „It is said that one should turn one's face away from the body when it is lifted on to the bier. The probable reason for this is to avoid inhaling the germs when it is moved.\" Manekshaw, Parsi Food and Customs. The essential Parsi Cookbook, p. 68. 41 Ahriman (mittelpersisch) gilt als „evil spirit\", als eine Art Gegenpol der guten Kräfte Ahura mazdas. Ahura mazda (avest.) wird von den Parsen im Englischen mit „God\" oder „Lord Wisdom\" wiedergegeben und gilt als der Gott, auf den Zarathustra sich bezog. Auf Ahriman sind böse Einflüsse und letztlich auch der physische Tod zu-rückzufuhren. 42 Rituelle Verbindung (paiwand) besteht, wenn zwei Menschen jeweils ein Stoff-oder Schnurende halten."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Bruch und Kontinuität im Verhältnis von Körper und Seele Ein weiterer, für das Verständnis der Todesrituale der Parsen wesentli-cher Aspekt ist das sich im bzw. mit dem Ritual gestaltende Verhältnis von totem Körper und weiter existierender Seele. Da mit dem toten Kör-per der Bruch, mit der fortexistierenden Seele jedoch die Kontinuität verbunden wird, verschränken sich im Ritual auf intensive Weise Bruch und Kontinuität. Nicht nur die Lebenden und der Leichnam erleben während des Bestat-tungsrituals die oben erläuterte zunehmende Distanzierung, auch die Seele des Verstorbenen und sein toter Körper entfernen sich voneinander. Kurz nach dem physischen Tod befindet sich die Seele über dem Kopf des To-ten. Sie begleitet den Leichnam zu den Bestattungsanlagen und erlebt dort die Zeremonien im bangli. Wenn der Körper jedoch zu den Türmen getra-gen wird, verbleibt sie im bangli, an dem Ort, an dem das geh-sarna-Ritual durchgeführt wurde. Diese Konstruktion wird verständlich, wenn man sich vor Augen führt, dass der für den Bruch stehende Körper nach diesem Ritual zum endgültigen ,Ort des Todes' getragen wird. Die Seele hingegen steht für die Kontinuität - ja, ist in gewisser Weise die Kontinui-tät selbst. Die Wege von totem Körper und weiterlebender Seele haben sich nun voneinander getrennt, wenn sie auch noch nicht zu ihrem „Ende\" oder an ihr Ziel gekommen sind. Verständlich wird diese Konzeption, wenn man die Bedeutung bedenkt, die dem geh-sarna-RiXudX zugespro-chen wird: „... it is believed that the potency of the prayer breaks the shackles of attachment which the soul of the deceased may have for this corporeal world.\"43 Die Rezitation der ahunavaiti-gatha ist es, die nach der Ansicht meiner Informanten zum Bruch (break) zwischen Körper und Seele führt. Der aufgrund seiner „Ausströmung\" als besonders gefahrvoll angesehene Vorgang der Umbettung von der Steinplattform auf die Toten-bahre verdeutlicht diesen Wechsel im Verhältnis von Körper und Seele. Wie bereits erwähnt, verbleibt die Seele für die nächsten Tage in der Nähe der Steinplattform, der Körper jedoch wird auf der Totenbahre zum dakh-ma getragen. Mit dieser Verortung der Seele wird auch die Notwendigkeit begründet, die folgenden Rituale im bangli und nicht in einem anderen Tempel auszuführen.44 43 Dhalla, „Funeral Customs and Ceremonies of the Parsis in India\", p. 15. 44 Wie oben erwähnt wurde, werden allerdings bestimmte Rituale zusätzlich in ande-ren Tempeln bzw. dem Familientempel in Auftrag gegeben."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Der nächste entscheidende Schritt für die Seele geschieht im Zeit-raum zwischen der Abenddämmerung des dritten und der Morgendäm-merung des vierten Tages.

An diesem Ort erwartet die häufig als unruhig und ängstlich be-schriebene Seele ein Gericht, mit dem sich ihr künftiges Schicksal ent-scheidet, hier verlässt sie den irdischen Raum der Lebenden.45 Dement-sprechend verlassen auch die Lebenden am vierten Tag das Bestattungs-gelände, und alle weiteren Zeremonien können zu Hause oder in einem Tempel stattfinden. Dem im Mythos konstituierten Wechsel entspricht auch eine veränderte Ritualpraxis. Das Weiterleben von Seelen bzw. fra-vashis begründet die fortdauernde Fürsorge durch die Hinterbliebenen. Zum Tragen kommt nun zum Beispiel ab dem vierten Tag das oben er-wähnte stam-Ritual, das rituelle Speisen der Seele bzw. der fravashi. Den Kontinuitäts-Konzeptionen im Mythos entsprechen also die rituel-len Konstruktionen von Kontinuität. Zu erinnern ist hier noch einmal im Gegensatz dazu an den radikal der Nicht-Existenz anheim gegebenen Körper.46 DIE WECHSELSEITIGE BEDINGTHEIT VON BRUCH UND KONTINUITÄT Die Beispiele des westeuropäischen, insbesondere westdeutschen Um-gangs mit dem Tod zeigten, dass mit der Abnahme von Kontinuitäts-Konzeptionen eine Verflachung bis hin zu einem Verschwinden von ri-tuellen Bruch-Konstruktionen einhergeht. Auf der anderen Seite lassen sich bei neuen, individuell gestalteten Bestattungsformen sowohl betonte Konstruktionen des Bruches als auch starke Kontinuitäts-Konstruktionen beobachten. Ein weiteres Beispiel für dieses Zusammentreffen bietet die Bestat-tungspraxis der Parsen in Bombay, die in besonders ausgeprägter Weise den mit dem Tod erfahrenen Bruch und ebenso die über den Tod hinaus wahrgenommene Kontinuität rituell umsetzt. Dabei sind beide Konzep-45 Siehe hierzu ζ .Β. Dhalla, „Funeral Customs and Ceremonies of the Parsis in In-dia\", pp. 40-41; Mistree, Zoroastrianism.

Besondere Bruch-Konstruktionen werden durch Kontinuitäts-Konstruk-tionen ,eingerahmt'. Die Seele des Toten und die Hinterbliebenen erfah-ren einen Ablösungsprozess vom physischen Körper des Toten und tra-gen damit dem durch den Tod hervorgebrachten Bruch Rechnung. Gleichzeitig vollziehen sich jedoch auch zwei Prozesse, die mit Kontinu-ität verbunden sind. Die Hinterbliebenen bauen einen rituellen Kontakt zur Seele des Toten auf und diese gliedert sich der jenseitigen Welt an. Aus der emischen Perspektive bedingen diese Prozesse einander sogar. Für eine befriedigende Jenseitsreise, also für die erfolgreiche Realisation von Kontinuität, ist die konsequente Realisation des Bruches, nämlich die Vernichtung des physischen Körpers vonnöten. Offensichtlich lassen sich beide Erfahrungen, Bruch und Kontinuität, als rituelle Konstruktionen in Todesritualen aufweisen. Zum Teil sind sie zudem in intensiver Weise miteinander verbunden und bedingen einan-der innerhalb der jeweiligen rituellen Strukturen. Es fragt sich, ob der emischen eine ritualtheoretische Perspektive entsprechen könnte, ob möglicherweise starke Konzeptionen von Kontinuität, die sich in Todes-ritualen ausdrücken, auch starke Konstruktionen des Bruches ermögli-chen oder gar benötigen und ob umgekehrt ausgeprägte Darstellungen des Bruches auch eine Betonung der Kontinuität herausfordern.

These observations are based on the simple premise that the Yasna ritual, its liturgical texts joined with the chapters of the Visperad, is prominently enacted during the sea-sonal festivals. This premise would seem to be supported by the likely origin of the ritual in its present form under the auspices of the Sasanian rulers, whose preoccupation with time reckoning and with the revolution of the stars and planets is well recognized. It is only natural that without support by parallels in other traditions such analysis must remain rather tentative. This paper presents some comparative notes on the Taoist ritual and the Zoroastrian Yasna ritual. Both are the product of two ancient traditions that evolved independently, and are far apart in their histories and social contexts. But they share their cyclical re-storative function that is correlated with communal seasonal festivals and with passages in the life cycle of individual members of the community, and both have enjoyed strong royal support for extended periods at one time or another. As such they both have cosmic ramifications. Being preliminary, these observations will initially focus on the more accessible aspect, rela-tively speaking, that is, the layout the ritual area in the two traditions. The comparison may contribute to elucidate some cosmological as-pects of the Yasna ritual. More cannot be claimed for it is unlikely that a global 'key' will ever be found to its magnificent verbal, temporal, and spatial architecture. It necessarily incorporates a multitude of accumu-lated layers and interpretations since its archaic beginnings. One has to recognize some basic facts about interpretations, here following Kristo-fer Schipper in his 'An Outline of Taoist ritual' (numbers added here):4 Second North American Gatha Conference, Houston, Texas, 1996, ed.

(3) 'That same holds to some extent for the diverse traditional interpre-tations.'

In particular, points 3 and 4, that is, repeated reinterpretation by the practitioners and their indigenous exegetes, is worthy of note. It is a matter of common sense, as it were, that cyclical rituals like the Yasna have cosmic proportions. Like other ritual areas, the yasnic area should represent the cosmos, and its layers, and the passage of the ritual from its beginning to its end should represent cosmic cycles and epicy-cles. Moreover, a ritual that passed through the ages when the cosmos of the fixed stars was numbered (21 northern, 12 zodiacal, and 15 southern constellations), and numbers and proportions were seen as ultimate de-terminants, can naturally be expected to show traces of those interpreta-tive overlays. It is true that it has long been recognized that the grand architecture of the Yasna ritual encodes cosmic patterns. The ritual area and what is in it represents the cosmos. The material creations are the phenomenal representations of the divine, Ahura Mazda and the six Amrta Spantas 'Holy Immortals', who are their spiritual guardian and are inherently present. Individually, for example, Wahu Manah, the guardian of benefi-cent animals, is represented in the animal products, such as the milk; Amjtät, the guardian of plants, is represented by the various plant mate-rials. The luminaries are represented, the Sun in the Fire, and the Moon in the crescent-shapes stands, and so forth. However, this kind of inter-pretations is rather elementary, and is therefore inadequate.5 5 As summarized by J. Duchesne-Guillemin, Symbols and Values in Zoroastrianism. Their Survival and Renewal (New York, 1966), pp. 85-87: \"(the) figuration of the sun, moon, earth are easily recognizable. Fire is a rival or substitute of the sun: that is proba-bly why it is placed on a circular vase. The moon is present in the form of the two metal crescents on which the barsom is repeatedly placed—a fecundity rite. As for the earth, it is the table, necessarily square (as earth was supposed to be), in front of which the chief priest sits. This cosmic symbolism is also attested in some details: the darun [conse-crated bread], according to the Pahlavi Rivayat 56.1, is arranged like the world; it is"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"One should note that there has never been any suggestion that the verbal architecture of the Yasna is simple, at least not as far as the ancient kernel of the ritual text is concerned, that is, the combined Gathic and Haptahäti sec-tions. This was again most recently shown by Almut Hintze,6 who succinctly brought together research by numerous colleagues and her own. Such work has increasingly revealed the intricate and pervasive symmetric hierarchy that unites those central texts, and the liturgical text as a whole. It is only proper to note that there are certain indicative passages in the Gathas themselves which, after all, are ritual texts, and replete with ritual ter-minology, and noted for their multiple, but ordered cross-referentiality and what may be characterized as sustained sacred double entendre, sacred puns. A case in point is the Gathic term rwaisa. When seen in the context of the ritual, its double entendre becomes evident. The term occurs ex-actly three times in the Gathas, twice at the beginning of the second Gatha, the UstawatT, Y. 43.4 and 6, and thus immediately following the interstitial seven chapters of the Haptathäti, and once in the fourth Gatha, the WohuxsaGra, Y. 51.6. Most telling in the present context appears to be Y. 43.6: ahmï spantä Owä manyü rwaisaijasah mazdä(h) xsaßrä ahmi wahü manahä yahya syauOnäis gaiQäh artä frädantai aibyah ratuNs sanhati aramatis Owahya xrataus yam nai.cis däbayati \"At the turning point (rwaisa) to which you come with your Spanta Manyu spirit, being Mazda through (your) power (XsaGra), there through good thought (Wahu Manah) by the action of which the possessions are furthered through truth (Arta), rightmindedness (Aramati) pronounces judgments on these here, (the judgments) of your intellect, which nobody can deceive\".7 round like the world. Never is the position and orientation of the two priests a matter of indifference. It seems that this completes the cosmic definition of the ceremony in which all the elements take part: fire, water, vegetable and (in a state of weak survival) animal nature, and in which the sun, moon, and earth are symbolically present. The entire universe, as one may infer, is brought into play to avert the demons and death.\" 6 A. Hintze, \"On the Arrangement of the Avestan Yasna\", in Proceedings of the 3rd International Congress, K.R.

A New Translation of the Gathas (Heidelberg, 1994), pp. 60-61, but with approximate reconstructed phonology."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Already Darmesteter8 had recognized that the term rwaisa implies the metaphor of a hippodrome, and specifically it refers to the far-end of the circular racecourse, as most recently pointed out by Almut Hintze.9 It appears that the term in this passage, while being recited by the priest, does not only refer to the cosmic racecourse, but also to the ritual table at which he stands, and which is still known as urwës/urwïs. Cosmic history is most evident in the grand cosmogonie section of Yasna 44. 1-7. But more relevant for the present discussion is a promi-nent passage that appears in the 'Gatha of the Choice', Y. 30.5: ayäh maniwâh warata artam many us spanistah yai.ca xsnausan ahuram yah drugwäh acistä wfzyä yah xrauzdistanh asänah wastai h a Oyäis syauOnäis frawitmazdäm \"Of these two spirits the deceitful one chooses to do the worst things, but the most holy spirit, clothed in the hardest stones, chooses truth, as do those who, with true actions, devotedly gratify Mazda Ahura\".10 This is a passage that would seem to allude to a crucial event in the elaborated myth of eschatological history, specifically the reinforcement of the sky after the attack of the forces of Evil in the middle of time in the year 6000. It also implies not only the protective, but also the sote-riological function of the sky, its luminaries and constellations, and their orderly revolution. More remotely, it retains the notion of Father Sky, and the 'stony' nature of the latter. But it is also a reminder of the fact that the knowledge of the physical sky played an essential role in the perception of cosmic truth, which is often an uneasy topic for modem studies. Turning to sacred numerology, this has always been in plain view, and emphasized by its practitioners, although hardly ever referred to by that technical term. 21 is the number superimposed on the ahunawar manthra,11 the true first stanza of the Gathas, Y. 27.13. It functions as the guiding principle for such diverse sets as the 21 Nasks of the Sasanian canon, and of the 21 barsom twigs in the High Yasna.

The number 72 = 3 χ 24, is the sacred number of the sum-total of the chapters of the Yasna. In abstraction, the perform-ance of the five Yasnas on the five extra days, i.e. the 'Gatha' days at the end of the religious year of 360 days, adds up to 5 χ 72 = 360 days, and incorporates the number of the year. If seen as a reflex of Pythagorean and later speculation, these five draw the figure of Pentagon in a Circle in Time. The number 12 is that of the months of the Zoroastrian calen-dar. As I have shown,13 by their correspondences they form four Trigons, which reflect the Persian astrological notion of the layered cycles of the Triplicities.14 At the same time, they form two intertwined Hexagons. To the outsider, the continuous insistence on the exact numbers of repeti-tions, on the various numbers of ritual twigs/wires, and so on, can only be perplexing. On a larger scale, the daily performance of 72 chapters results in the total of 72 χ 360 = 25920 per year. This is the 'standardized' traditional Great Year, reflecting the number of years it takes for one full cycle of the precession of the equinoxes around the axis of the ecliptic, or 12 χ 2160, the latter number being the years for the passage of the precession through one zodiacal sign of 30° each.15 THE TAOIST RITUAL Admittedly, I have no more than a most rudimentary understanding of the Taoist ritual, let alone of its cultural and historical context. For this exploratory essay I rely mainly on the works by Kristofer Schipper and Michael Saso.16 12 Kotwal/Boyd, A Persian Offering, pp. 155-157. 13 For example, Windfuhr, \"Vohu Manah\", p. 296, and Windfuhr, \"The Logic of the Holy Immortals\", p. 267. 14 Cf.

It experienced a major consolidation under imperial auspices in the second century A.D., when Buddhist influence is first noted, and later when its ritual texts were finally collected in a canon under the auspices of the post-Mongolian Ming dynasty. Today it is re-duced to a marginal status. The fundamental view of Chinese cosmology is based on correlative thought, where the macrocosmos, microcosmos, and the state, are correlated in complex spatial, temporal, and numero-logical patterns. In terms of ideological outlook, there is a fundamental distinction be-tween the Yasna and the Taoist ritual: the indifference of the latter with regard to any particular religious dogma or affiliation, in particular Con-fucian or Buddhist. That is, the Taoist attitude is value neutral and strictly professional healing. The product to be achieved is likewise quite distinct. It is not the preparation of the healing elixir and its oblation to the living water, but the oblation of sacred writs by fire. However, there is a distant similarity between the Zoroastrian mortar and the Taoist in-cense burner in the center of the area, which ultimately may represent the alchemical furnace from which the elixir of life and precious metals are refined.18 To highlight the similarities: Both the Zoroastrian and the Taoist rit-ual are prominently seasonal, but also involve longer-range cycles, such as 60 years in Taoist communal rejuvenation rites. In both, the layout of the ritual area is cosmic, and represents celestial and terrestrial, as well as temporal cycles and structures. They have restorative function that is applied to both the community and the individual. They involve sacred numerology. Finally, the Taoist ritual area as a whole, like the village temple and the household altar, are modeled on the structure of the triple cosmos, which may be seen as well in the corresponding Zoroastrian structures. The fundamental correlative thought of Chinese cosmology, interlink-ing macrocosm, microcosm, and the state, would appear to be largely true for the Zoroastrian view, perhaps even the inclusion of the state in this equation during Sasanian times. 17 I also thank my colleagues Phillip Ivanhoe and Robert Sharf at the University of Michigan for some brief discussions. Neither should be blamed for blunders in my in-adequate understanding. 18 M.R. Saso, Taoism and the Rite of Cosmic Renewal (New York, 1972; 2nd ed.

(2) 'To oblate the cosmological canon was to make it work, to trans-form it into reality. Nature thus became a replica of the model, and this mirror image was embedded in the structure of the ritual action itself. (3) 'For the Taoists, the theoretical nature cycles illustrated the ke, that is the measured, normative, and regulating workings of the Tao.' (4) 'By making cosmological models the very basis of the ritual struc-ture, rituals became the expression of natural processes.' (5) 'For this reason, Taoist ritual, Chinese calendrical science, and forms of other Chinese science, such as medicine, share a common set of fundamental representations that form a self-contained epistemological system. ' More specifically, the Taoist cult recognizes abstract cosmological con-cepts, only, and is centered around the so-called elements. These are not material, but are divisions, or phases, of cosmic cycles: Masculine-feminine Yin-Yang, the 5 Elements, 8 Trigrams, 64-four Hexagrams, 10 Stems and 12 Branches, 24 Energy Nodes, and the 28 Lunar Mansions. All are nested. The same abstract conceptual approach appears to be true for Zoroas-trianism. This may be shown in regard to the so-called elements, or crea-tions, which represent states of matter rather than elements per se, in an intricate complementary pattern; they correspond to the three pairs of Holy Immortals, Amrta Spantas, who guard these six:20 19 K.M.

Inner altar In the very center is the ritual table with an incense burner, at which the main officiant sits with two cantors (not shown here). The arrangement of the inner square is a single upright cross that represents the five direc-tions, i.e. the center point and the four directions. At each is placed a bushel of uncooked white rice (a measure of life). Inside each is a sacred writ (wooden tablet or paper with secret and un-readable symbols). These are known as the Real Writings, and are sup-posed to have appeared at the initial, cosmogonie eight-note Big-Bang. This third step in the ritual of constructing the sacred area thus reenacts the very first stage of the creation of the world, which includes the original revelation of the Tao, that is, the basic Taoist texts, the first holy book. 25 The correlation of the 'well' and the Chinese sign was kindly pointed out by Pro-fessor Ivanhoe."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"This rite completes the construction of the altar. From this point on, a nine-fold ritual of circulation can take place, designated by the general name of 'practicing the Tao'. COMPARATIVE NOTES The following observations briefly highlight the most salient similarities between the Taoist ritual and the Zoroastrian ritual practice as standard and authoritative of the Bhagariä priests of Navsari described by Kotwal and Boyd, with focus on the layout of the ritual areas. The inner five directions The correspondence between the five Chinese directions, which are cor-related with the five virtues or 'elements', and five of the six Zoroastrian elements, or rather states of matter, was discussed by Windfuhr.26 The additional sixth, which is 'animals' and lacks in Taoism, marks a major difference between the two systems. Following the pattern, 'animals' would provide the third dimension, verticality: Chinese: Center NE  S W earth water wood fire metal Iranian: earth water plants fire sky, metals animals Orientation and Gates The Taoist ritual area is oriented towards the South; so is the Zoroastrian ritual area as shown in fig. 5. The Zoroastrian main priest enters from the SE (see fig. 5, following page),27 just like the Taoist officiant enters through the Gate of Earth in the SE. The four gates in the Taoist altar contrast with the single SE 'gate' in the Yasna ritual area. It is well perceivable that prior to being confined to fixed fire-temples the Zoroastrian ritual area may have had four 'gates' as well. 26 Cf.

Similarly, the Zoroastrian area consists of three components: the ritual table in the north, the intermediate space (andarag), and the southern section with the fire stand. These three together, united by the protective furrow around them, similarly would appear to represent the ground, the atmosphere, and the sky of the luminaries with the Sun. But there is no immediate correlate to the three-step process from outer to inner time. However, given the hosting of the divine in the Yasna ritual, it may encode such connotations as well, especially considering the Zo-roastrian notions of limited and unlimited time. The Zoroastrian ritual area is rectangular. This shape corresponds to the later arrangement of the Taoist altar, which evolved out of a symmet-ric arrangement. It is likely that the Zoroastrian rectangle did likewise originate in three mutually embedded squares, symbolically arranged around a central fire, or well. This conjecture may be supported by the shift in the shape of the protective area of the major Zoroastrian purifica-tion ritual for individuals, the nine-day/night baresnüm, from symmetric-circular to rectangular, as has been convincingly suggested by Steblin-Kamensky also for primordial Yima's abode, wara.28 The twenty-four sections In the Taoist ritual, there are twenty-four outer sections that represent units of fifteen days each and organize the annual circle of 360 degrees. There does not appear to be a corresponding physical structure in the Zoroastrian ritual. However, the number twenty-four does appear to have played a symbolic function, for it is the number of sections into which the text of theYasna has been divided.29 More closely related to cyclical time, twenty-four is also the number of the chapters of the Visperad text, which are combined with the Yasnic text in the seasonal festivals. It is therefore possible that their number likewise once signified the twenty-four fifteen-day periods of the year. 28 I.M.

The Taoist Trigrams are assumed to symbolize patterns of change. It is possible that the combined ritual locations, tasks, and movements of the eight Zoroastrian priests had similar connotations the more so that they are systemically associated with Ahura Mazda, the divinity Srausa 'Auditor' and guide, and the six Holy Immortals, as well as with specific 'continents' (see further discussion below)."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"ZOROASTRIAN AND TAOIST RITUAL •im Sua ι J .< Ϊ h lr C\\ 7. ünMblum. v.-* 4.

The nine indentations in the bread would represent the aspect of a central agricultural field, while the nine holes in the sieve would represent the aspect of a central well. The traditional interpretation is that the nine holes represent a triple triad of Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds.31 The twelve Taoist openings and the twelve Zoroastrian instruments Less obvious, the twelve-fold pattern made by the twelve openings around the perimeter of Taoist nine-field square is found on the Zoroas-trian ritual table: It is reflected in the arrangements and functions of the instruments. This becomes apparent when all twelve instruments are po-sitioned in their basic position, as shown in fig. 9, which is an abstracted representation of the arrangement of the twelve instruments, suggested by Windfuhr.32 The instruments form sets of three on each of the four sides of the ritual table as follows: on the north side, a zôhr 'libation' cup, a knife, and a milk bowl; on the south side, a mortar, a bread bowl, and a covered reserve cup; on the west side, a twig bowl, a cup with a ring, and a zôhr cup; on the east side, a N-stand, a S-stand, and a parahöm cup. 31 J.J.

The twelve Zoroastrian instruments similarly represent the twelve Zoroastrian months, and thus represent the Zoroastrian calen-dar,33 as seen in fig. 10. Implicitly then, the arrangement of the twelve instruments on the square ritual table are not unlike the arrangement of the constellations in the Chaldean thema mundi, which are similarly represented in the shape of a square rather than a circle. At least in some cases the correlation between ritual instrument and Zoroastrian month is fairly obvious. Thus, the mortar in the SW comer of the table correlates with the month guarded by the Holy Immortal Amjtät 'Immortality'. It is she who pounds the ur-plant after the attack of Evil, while Tistrya 'Sirius', traditionally recognized as the harbinger of fall rains, is said to distribute the seeds over the newly arranged seven keswar 'continents'. Similarly, the milk bowl in the NE, directly oppo-site to Amrtät in the circle of the calendar, corresponds to the month of Wahu Manah 'Good Mind', who is the guardian of beneficent animals, including gäw aiwa-däta, the ur-animal or 'ox' (for the detailed correla-tion see discussion further below). Ritual variations (cf. photo34, plates XVI) It should be noted that there are certain differences in the arrangements and handling of some of these twelve instruments. A case in point is the position of the mortar. As kindly pointed out to me by Dastur Ramiyar Karanjia, the initial SW location is specific to the Sanjana diocese, where it is kept during the preparatory ritual and for the first fifteen tex-tual chapters in the Yasna proper. Elsewhere it is located in the SE, as seen in plates XVI/1, which shows the arrangement of the Athoman Boarding Madressa located at Dadar outside Mumbai. The more traditional correspondence of the mortar would thus not be with Amrtät 'Immortality', but with the Holy Immortal with which the latter is constantly paired, Harwatät 'Completeness', and the difference must have come about by ritual argument and re-interpretation. 33 Cf. Windfuhr, \"Significance of Zoroastrians Rituals\". 34 The photograph was taken in 1984, and kindly provided by Prof. Jamsheed Choksy."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"YASNA: TWELVE RITUAL INSTRUMENTS AND RITUAL ACTION Schipper in his Outline of the Taoist Ritual' details, among other struc-tural features, the 'syntax' of the ritual action.

To justify the identification of the nine sections, the crucial criteria may be highlighted as follows: Section 0. The initial phase is Regrouping. The assistant priest, râspï(R) had conducted the preparatory ritual alone. Now the main priest, zöt (Ζ), enters the ritual area, pâwî, from SE, and faces the fire. The assistant priest goes to fetch the milk, the cup with the parahöm fluid (prepared earlier), and the consecrated bread; the main priest then moves to the NE and takes his seat. The assistant priest reenters. Section 1. Preparation, is marked by the curious upright stand of the two priests, right big toe over left big toe, facing each other across the ritual area, N-S. This is followed by libations and the manipulation of the barsom bundle. Section 2, Meal, is marked by the symbolic consumption of the conse-crated bread and the parahöm drink, and at one time apparently also in-cluded a burnt sacrifice, which was either brought then by the frabitar priest to the fire throne in the central chamber of the temple, or was ini-tially kept, and later taken to the throne. In this section, there are re-peated serving movements to the main priest by the assistant priest. Section 3, Tying, preparing, is marked by the tying of two knots into the loose ends of the loop, or sacred girdle, made of a date palm leaf, that is wound around the barsom bundle. It is then hung on the western hom on the southern, or rather eastern, moon stand. Earlier, a special twig, da-tusö, was stuck upright into knot on the bundle. The section concludes with the return of the mortar, that had been on the sacred table since the preparatory ritual, back into the large water basin in the NW. Section 4, Pounding, again begins with the curious toe over toe move-ment, this time by the main priest alone. The mortar is retrieved, followed by an extended series of poundings of hôm (hauma) twigs and a pome-35 Darmesteter, Le Zend Avesta·, Kotwal/Boyd, A Persian Offering."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"granate twig, and related movements. At the end, the mortar, bowls, and cups are arranged in a complex three-level structure. Section 5, Word, is essentially recitation of the seven chapters of the Haptahäti and the second through fifth Gathas, followed by chapters Y. 56-57 to the divinity that oversees the material world, Srausa, and chap-ters Y. 58-59, on prosperity. Earlier, the burnt offerings were probably presented during this phase. Similar to the sections preceding section 5, all following sections conclude with complex, but different arrangements of the main ritual instruments handled, which cannot be detailed here. Section 6, Untying, is marked by the return to ritual movements, after the arrest in section 5. The loop is removed from the horn of the moon stand, back onto the barsom bundle, in earlier times also the datusö twig was removed. This is followed by the action of untying of the two knots that had been tied in section 3. Here the assistant priest moves to the Ε side of the ritual table, faces the barsom bundle, and returns. Section 7, Untying, is marked by the upright stand of the main priest on his seat, barsom and twig in hand, which he had held from earlier on, and which is his main wand. (It is distinct from the datusö.) The residue of the pounding is thrown to the assistant priest, who oblates it to the fire to burn. The main priest then stands to the Ε of his seat. He lays down the two moon stands, horns facing E. Section 8, Mixing, is marked by the main priest standing to the Ε of his seat. He is joined by the assistant priest, both facing W. The main action is the manipulation of the barsom bundle, milk saucer, and two cups, fil-tering and pouring, with repeated circular movements across the rim of the mortar. At the end, all fluids are poured over the sieve into the mortar. Section, 9, Mixing, is again marked by the main priest standing on his seat, facing E, and complex manipulation, mainly of two cups, one re-peatedly set tilted into the other and removed, accompanied by multiple pourings from one into the other, circular movements, the forward movements of the barsom bundle, and the tying of multiple knots in the loose ends of the loop around the barsom. The assistant priest joins. The barsom bundle thus tied is firmly placed across the two moon stands that have been laid down in section 7, thus forming a cross of the two moon stands lying in E-W direction, and the barsom bundle with its girdle, lying in N-S direction."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"The ritual action of the entire Yasna concludes with a complex of moves. The two priests exchange a tying handshake, hamâzôr, holding each other's hands between two palms. The priests then step out into an adjacent ritual area, face E. While the assistant priest moves ahead on the path to the well of the temple, formerly a running stream of living water, the main priest returns to fetch the mortar, presents it to the fire, then joins the assistant priest, to pour the invigorating liquid back into the waters. The ritual actions no longer enacted are also discussed in the most detailed description so far of the ritual action and text combined by Darmesteter. For example, section 3 highlights some significant differences be-tween the descriptions in Kotwal and Boyd 1991, and in Darmesteter 1892 I, who reports on the more elaborate Iranian actions. Thus, in sec-tions 3 and 6, according to Kotwal and Boyd, the girdle of the barsom bundle is moved onto the W hom of the southern moon stand, while the Iranian action involves also the vertical insertion of a twig into the knot of the girdle.36 Similarly, Boyce37 discusses the sacrifice of an animal during section 2. In section 7, the two stands are laid down facing East. In Iran, this action is preceded by the passage of the main priest, barsom in hand, in three (or four) steps over the position of three of the eight priests who once participated (see below), the frabrtax to his left in the NE, the raiOwiskara along the east side, and the äbrtar in the SE. There he faces the fire, then returns to his place in the N. It is in place here to insert a mythological interpretation of these steps according to the Varst.mänsar Nask,38 as summarized in the Dënkard 9.43.3-8:39 This action symbolizes the return of the Holy Immortals, Amrta Spanta, via the three levels of preliminary paradise, hu-mata, hu-36 See also F.M.

Presumably they crossed the Bridge of the Weight Piler, between material and spiritual world. This ancient passage thus also gives a glimpse at certain correlations once made between parts of the ritual area and the vertical cosmos: ( 1 ) The first move of the main priest from his seat in the Ν to the NE corner would correspond to the passage across the Bridge, so that the stretch from Ν to NE represented the Bridge with its material and spiritual anchors. (2) The three positions along the eastern side of the ritual area would correspond to the levels of the three preliminary paradises. (3) The priest's facing the fire from the SE position (from where he had entered at the beginning of the Yasna proper) would correspond to the final passage into the realm of Ahura Mazda and the Holy Immortals. This, however, implies that the fire-stand does not only represent the Sun in the material world, but also the highest spiritual paradise. (4) Accordingly, it is the fire-priest who was correlated with Ahura Mazda, and, in fact, to this day it is the assistant priest, the râspî, who performs the preparatory ritual, that is, the creative actions preceding the attack of Evil. In turn, the main priest, zöt, would correspond not to Ahura Mazda, but to Zarathushtra himself, who in the Gathas identifies himself as zautar.40 Higher-level six-partite structure As shown in table 2, the nine section are hierarchically organized into higher units, which number six: 1 Preparation; 2 Sacrificial Meal; 3 Ty-ing, Preparation and Pounding; 4 Sacred Word; 5 two steps of Untying; 6 two steps of Mixing. 40 On the levels of the Zoroastrian quasi-Ptolemaic cosmos, based on Yast 12, see Windfuhr, \"Where Guardian Angels watch by Night and Evil Spirits fail\".

It can be shown that its main ritual actions, too, are six, if one defines action by combined location, items involved, and instrument used. Without going into detail, the six are the following: 1 Getting Water; 2 Getting Plants (twig of pomegranate and date palm leaf, formerly also twigs of höm and of barsom)·, 3 Getting Milk; 4 Filling cups and milk bowl, and arranging them; 5 Arranging and tying the barsom twigs; 6 Pounding and mixing. These appear to be correlated with six of the instruments on the ritual table. However, this is not in random fashion, but in sequential order, as first presented by the author in 1986: 1 Getting Water with zôhr cup 1 ; 2 Getting Plants with knife; 3 Getting Milk with milk bowl; 4 Arranging cups and milk bowl with northern moon stand; 5 Tying barsom with southern (actually eastern) moon stand; 6. Pounding with parahôm cup 2. Taking this pattern as a cue, the six main sections of the Yasna proper appear to correspond to the remaining six instruments as follows: 7 Preparation with the reserve cup; 8 Meal with bread bowl; 9 Pounding with mortar; 10 Sacred Word with the twig bowl; 11 Untying with the ring cup; 12 Mixing with zôhr cup 2. Finally, noting that each instrument is correlated with a month of the calendar, and the total of twelve actions in the preparatory and main ritu-als, there appears an intricate overall correlation linking instruments, ac-tions, and the calendar in 12 steps, as shown in table 3 (following page):"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Table 3.

Spiritual ties across the calendar and ritual table The logic of the correlations between the instruments and their spiritual guardians and months may be briefly discussed in terms of the overall system seen in fig. 10, rather than sequentially: The East-West axis is guarded by the divinity Mithra, the guardian of the fall equinox, represented by the ring cup (W), and the eastern moon stand (E), which is guarded by the Guardian Spirits, the Frawarti-s, at spring equinox. These two represent the horizontal tie across the circle of the year, properly reflected in the ring in the ring cup, and the loop on the western hom of the eastern moon stand, both representing the central circle of the ecliptic, which is the apparent path of the Sun. In actions, these two correspond to action 5, Tying the barsom bundle, and action 11, Untying the knots, respectively. The North-South axis is guarded by Dadwah, the Creator, at winter solstice, represented by the knife (N), and Tistrya, the brightest star of the sky, Sirius. His rising marks the Summer, represented by the bread bowl (S). These two represent the other main tie across the circle of the year. The low point, winter solstice, is the true beginning of the year, when the Sun begins its rise. It corresponds to the knife of the Creator, while the high point of the year corresponds to the bread bowl, repre-senting the summer harvest. In actions, these two correspond to action 2, cutting of the Plants to be brought in for the ritual of renewal, and action 8, the Meal, with the consumption of the consecrated bread and the con-secrated drink. The diagonal ties are as follows: The milk bowl (NNE), guarded by Wahu Manah, the guardian of beneficial animals, is tied across the circle with the mortar (SSW), guarded by the Holy Immortal Amrtät, guardian of the plants, which are pounded and mixed with the consecrated milk. In actions, these two correspond to action 3, Getting Milk, and action 9, Pounding in the Yasna proper, thus tying animal life and plant life. 41 Cf. also Windfuhr, \"The Logic of the Holy Immortals in Zoroastrianism\", p. 269, fig. 5."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"The tie between earth and sky, material and spiritual, is represented respectively by the northern moon stand (ENE), guarded by Aramati, the Holy Immortal guarding the earth, and the twig bowl (WSW), which holds the hôm and pomegranate twigs, guarded by XsaGra, the Holy Im-mortal guarding the sky. In actions, these correspond to action 4, Arrang-ing and piling cups and milk bowl, and action 10, the sacred Word of Gathas 2-5 and the Haptahäti, thus tying the new, reordered physical cosmos with the new spiritual order of the sacred word brought by Zarathushtra. The four cups represent double ties of the two basic life principles, water and fire: The cup holding the reserve parahôm fluid (SSE), guarded by Harwatät, the Holy Immortal who guards the Waters, is tied across the circle with zôhr cup 1 (NNW), guarded by Ätar, the yazata of the Fire in all things. In actions, these two correspond to action 7, Prepa-ration, and to action 1, Getting Water. These two tie the very beginning of the ritual, the first action of the preparatory sequence with the first action of the Yasna proper. The parahôm cup (ESE), which is guarded by Arta, the Holy Immor-tal of cosmic order and guardian of Fire, is tied across the circle with zôhr cup 2 (WSW), holding consecrated water, which is guarded by the yazata of the Waters, Äpah. Actually, the designations of the months are in the genitive, thus the month 'of the waters'. The divinity behind these is evident in the designation of this month in the Cappadocian Zoroas-trian calendar, Apäm Napät Offspring of the Waters', a divinity of Indo-Iranian age. In actions, these two correspond to action 6, the Pounding and mixing in the preparatory ritual, and to action 12, final Mixing. Sequentially, then, the 12 actions do not begin with Dadwah and the knife, but with Ätar and zohr cup 1. Therefore, the action guarded by Ätar can thus be seen as representing the ultimate nuclear origin of life fluids and energy. In turn, the last of the 12 actions corresponds to zôhr cup 2 guarded by Äpah/Apäm Napät, which should represent the final purified state. This conclusion regarding the symbolic beginning and end of the ritual would appear to make eminent sense given that the ultimate action of the entire ritual is the oblation of the consecrated fluid achieved through the 12 actions to the living waters."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Table 4.

Action: libation of the barsom bundle. Texts: invocation of the complete circle of the divine. (2) Meal and Tistrya 'Sirius', the guardian of the summer and summer harvest, also the distributor of the seeds. Action: partaking of the conse-crated bread and drink. Texts: consecration to SröS/Srau§a; then hymn to the sacred plant and deity Höm/Hauma. Note that both the bread and the drink partaken by the main priest here had been prepared earlier. Also, in earlier times a burnt sacrifice was part of the action here. (3) Tying, preparation, pounding and Amrtät 'Immortality', guardian of plants. She also pounded the seeds after the destruction of the ur-plant, which Tistrya then distributed. Action: extended pounding of the conse-crated twigs, and the first preparation of the new elixir. Texts: profession of faith, exegesis of the three most sacred manthras (Y 19-21), the three sacred manthras, then the first Gatha (Y. 28-34). (4) Word and XsaOra 'Rule, Power', guardian of the sky and metals. Ac-tions: recitation of texts only: the ritually central Haptahäti, and the other four Gathas (Y. 43-54), which pronounce the new cosmic rule; followed by the hymn to Srausa, the overseer of the material creations. In fact, the hymn is modeled after the Zoroastrianized Avestan hymn to Mithra, Yasht 10, a borrowing that is implicitly acknowledged by Mithra's guardianship of the next main ritual action. The section concludes with a manthra of prosperity and a prayer proper for the Last Judgment. (5) Untying and Mithra, guardian of contracts and of the equinoxes, in the calendar of the fall equinox. Action: two phases of Untying; first the removal of the loop off the hom of the moon stand and the untying of the knots; then the oblation of the residue from the pounding to the fire, and the laying down of the two moon stands. Texts: benediction, Dahmän äfrin, in the first half; then the praise of Fire, and oblation to water. (6) Mixing and Äpah 'Waters', implicitly Apäm Napät 'Offspring of the Waters'. Action: two extended phases of mixing. Texts: praise of Wa-ters, and the female waters called Ahurânï-s. To note, Mithra and Apäm Napät are also the only two besides Ahura Mazda to be called ahura like Mazda Ahura.

Overall, then, the suggested correlations would appear to show the texts in harmony with the calendar and ritual actions, and with their mythology and functions. The twelve sections and the World Year Taking the clue from the calendrical correlations of the twelve main rit-ual actions, it appears to be worthwhile to correlate them with the Zoro-astrian World Year of twelve millennia. This is shown in table 7, where major events and mythical figures connected with the twelve in tradi-tional Zoroastrian teaching are added:46 Table 7.

Zoroastrian religious myth intertwines with myth ultimately of Indo-European provenience. Only bare outlines can be given here. Creation begins with spiritual crea-tion, specifically of the six Holy Immortals, and with a spiritual Yasna ritual performed by Ahura Mazda, followed by the six + one material creations in the spiritual, unmoving state: the sky, the waters, the earth, the plants, the animals, humankind, probably followed by the energizing Fire, and accompanied by the coming into being of Zarathushtra's pre-soul created at the end of the first period, appended to first, or at the be-ginning of the second. The interstice between these two periods is marked by a primordial event, the mythical encounter between Ahura Mazda and the Evil Spirit in the year 3000, and their contract of Limited Time. The Evil Spirit, having been thrown into stupor by Ahura Mazda's pronouncement of the ahunawar manthra (see also discussion below) for 3000 years, awakes and attacks. After the attack of the forces of Evil, which caused the cosmos and all in it to move in TIME, begins the third cosmic period which is the beginning of the state of Mixture. There is a list of major sacrificers, some of whom are mentioned in table 7, culminating in Zarathushtra's father and himself, then followed by his three posthumous sons. The 'worldly' myth begins with Gaya.martan 'Mortal Life' and the first cre-ated Animal. It is followed by 'dynasties', the paradâta 'Fore-given', the interregnum of Azi Dahäka, the 'Human Serpent', followed by the dy-nasty of the smiths-sages, the Kawi-kings (Kayanians). In between reli-gious and 'worldly' myth are Yama xsaita (Jamshëd); the warrior-healer Oraitauna; and the warrior Krsäspa; and the first patron of Zarathushtra, Wistäspa, called kawi as well. The post-Zarathushtrian heroes include the mighty Wahräm, hoped for in apocalyptic texts,47 and certain pri-mordial heroes who return to help in the cosmic fight, including Yama, whose hidden abode opens and its inhabitants repopulate the devastated earth. The drama concludes with a final conflagration, and final Yasna rituals, the last one conducted by Ahura Mazda.48 47 Cf. C. Cereti, \"Again on Wahräm î warzäwand\", in La Persia e I 'Asia Centrale da Alessandro alXsecolo, in collaborazione con l'Instituto Italiano per il Medioed Estre-mo Oriente, Roma, 9-12 novembre 1994 (Roma, 1996), pp. 629-639. 48 For a detailed discussion of these events, see Boyce, A History of Zoroastrianism, passim."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Assuming the validity of the correlations between ritual action and the World Year, the transition between the preparatory ritual and the Yasna proper correlates with the attack of Evil in the year 6000. Accord-ingly, the appearance of Zarathushtra in the year 9000 should correlate with section 4 of the Yasna proper, that is, the section here identified as the Sacred Word, which begins with the recitation of the Yasna Hap-tahäti, after the first Gathic section, Y. 27.13-Y. 34. This is also the very center of the Gathas and of the Yasna proper. Should this conclusion hold, it would substantiate on entirely independent criteria the keen in-sights by Molé, 1963, and specifically 1967,49 that the pounding reenacts the process of the birth and the coming of Zarathushtra, at least as one of its multiple referents. In turn, the three following sections should correspond to the three millennia from Zarathushtra's coming to the final battle and transfigura-tion. Each of these cosmic ages experiences initial victory for the relig-ion, brought about by leading religious figures, followed by decline and chaos. The religious figures include Zarathushtra's three posthumous sons, appearing in the years 10000, 11000, and in the end, 12000. It is possible that specific ritual moves reflect this process. Thus, standing up may encode initial strength, while untying, or laying down the stands, may encode threatening dissolution, and so forth. That appears indeed to be the case, but cannot be explored here further. SACRED NUMEROLOGY Zoroastrian cosmic cycles The grand view of a world year of 12 millennia is modeled after the an-nual solar cycle of 12 month χ 30 days, as is its traditional four-seasonal division into four periods of 4 χ 3000 years each. It is only natural that such numbers as 3, 4, 12, 30, have assumed even more significance in the context of the Zoroastrianism eschatological outlook. The solar cycle is also the one that is most familiar. But it is only the most prominent cycle. A major cycle less commonly known is the Metonic cycle, cap-tured by the number 19.50 This is the cycle that involves not only the 49 M.

It is defined by the nineteen-year period, or about 235 months, after which all moon phases fall on the same days in the solar cycle, thus marking the interlocking phases of the two main luminaries. The knowledge of such cycle, one can assume, must have had par-ticular significance in Zoroastrianism as these two luminaries represent the orderly course of the revolution of the sky after the incursion of the forces of Evil in the year 6000. In fact, these numbers are reminiscent of significant numbers in Zoroastrianism. Thus, the total number of stanzas in the Gathas is 238. It is possible that theologians related this number to the Metonic cycle for its fundamental cosmological and eschatological significance, interpreting 238 as 235 + 3, the latter the sacred number three. In fact, the cycle is also found in the number 57, and relates to the final Sausyant, who will be bom 57 years before the year 12,000. This number encodes a triple Metonic cycle, 3x19. The four sacred manthras The reinforcement of the sky, and its orderly arrangement, are said to have been the first act of Ahura Mazda after the attack in the year 6000.51 It can therefore be assumed that the knowledge about the sky, because of its all-encompassing protective function assigned by Ahura Mazda, was deemed to be of paramount significance and importance. This most powerful physical-spiritual protective envelope is matched verbally by the protective envelope of the four most sacred manthras around the innermost core and store of knowledge, the combined Gathas and Haptahäti, which is enunciated and enacted in harmony with the ce-lestial cycles at the seasonal feasts. It must therefore have been of paramount importance to know not only the orderly revolutions of the fixed sky, but also the order, shape, and relative arrangement of the order of the stars and constellations, as set in the sky by Ahura Mazda for protection. In late Hellenistic times that order had become common knowledge and fixed, in what is known as the Ptolemaic system (second century A.D.) of 48 constellations dis-nally published 1920), p. 224; also A. Schimmel, The Mystery of Numbers (New York/ Oxford, 1993), p. 224-225. 51 For the correlation of the Zoroastrian calendar with the major cataclysmic events, see Windfuhr, \"A Note on aryaman's Social and Cosmic Setting\", pp. 320-321."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"tributed in specific sets of the northern, zodiacal, and southern sky, 21, 12, and 15, respectively.

In addition, the concluding.sacred manthra, the ä aryamä isiyah, Y. 54.1, has 24 words, which may correspond to the total number of chapters in the Gathas and the Haptahäti combined, 17 + 7: Table 8.

As such, numerical encoding is not fundamentally different from the pervasive acrostic patterns of the sounds A-M, W-M, and so on, in the Gathas, for which see Schwartz.53 The cycles in the yasnic liturgical text In her mentioned study of 1995, Almut Hintze has convincingly argued that the expansion of the Yasna to 72 chapters was organized in such a way that Y. 36, addressed to the fire, Ätar, came to stand in the very cen-ter of the liturgy. In fact, this observation is born out by the thread of two interlocking numerological patterns that are based on the numbers 6 and 9, respectively. The two patterns plotted here highlight prominent chap-ters, by which the centrality of Y. 36 becomes even more prominent. In the following chart, the chapters and sections marking the two cycles are identified by key term only: (1) bayän, repeat of Y. 47, the six-stanza chapter on the holy or invigorating spirit, Spanta Manyu, in Y. 18, fol-52 Windfuhr, \"Cosmic Numerology\". 53 M.

Just like the Metonic cycle defined by the number 19, so 18 is the astral number of another major cycle, that of the eclipses, also known as the Saros cycle, of eighteen years (and about 10 days) after which the eclipses of the Sun and the Moon recur in the same sequence.54 Eclipses being considered the work of the forces of Evil, this cycle would fittingly encode the struggle between the two Spirits in human and nature, culmi-nating in the final battle and world-healing Yasna said to be performed by Ahura Mazda himself, just as he performed the spiritual Yasna at the beginning of the binary world. COMPARATIVE NOTES Shared Zoroastrian and Taoist numerology Relative position, movements, and their relative timing are equally cru-cial in ritual action. This is bom out by the complex movements of the priests in the Yasna, as minimally indicated in the synopses above. 54 Bischoff, Mystik und Magie der Zahlen, pp. 223-224, who also indicates that like all cyclical numbers, 18 is a lucky number, especially if arranged in form of 3 χ 6; cf. also Schimmel, The Mystery of Numbers, pp. 224-225."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"The priestly movements, and their exact execution, must have been even more crucial, and complex, at the time when eight priests enacted the Yasna at the high seasonal festivals. The significance of this aspect is aptly expressed by Duchesne-Guillemin: 'The position of the seven priests is symbolic of the coming of the future saviors to each of the seven parts of the world, and proper orientation is essential. In this way the officiating priests can feel themselves, in the performance of the ceremony, firmly related not only to the gods but also to the cosmos.' Further, 'The entire universe, as one may infer, is brought into play to avert the demons and death.'55 The eight are: zautar (Z), the main priest; häwanan (H), the mortar priest; äsnätar (As), the priest responsible for washing and filtering the hauma; ätpvaxs (At), the attendant of the fire; frabftar (Fr), the priest responsible for a variety of minor functions, mostly related to the upkeep of the fire stand and wood; raiOwiskara (R), the priest responsible for mixing and the distribution of the hauma·, äbitar (Ab), the fetcher of wa-ter; finally, srausawarza (Sr), the overseer. The priests are called upon by the main priest in the third chapter of the Visperad (Vr), inserted after Y. 11 of the basic yasnic text. Their functions and their proper positions are mentioned in the Avestan litur-gical handbook known as the Nërangistân, book 2 (Nër.).

Position of eight priests, Nërangistân Two positions in this arrangement would seem to be problematic. As discussed above, the mortar is traditionally located in the SE comer of the ritual table, which would therefore be the proper place for the mortar priest H, rather than at the large water basin to the right of the lead priest in the NW. In tum, that location would seem to be intuitively more proper for the water fetcher Ab. A possible explanation is that the ar-rangement given for the proper places in the Nërangistân refers to the crucial stage where the mortar priest began the pounding and mixing. This would be supported by the comment, referred to earlier, by Dastur Karanjia, that the mortar remains in the SE comer until Y. 15, then is immersed, and placed in the middle of the northern side of the table at the beginning of the pounding sequence at Y. 24. Given the involvement of sacred numerology discussed above, it is possible that the arrangement of the priests was similarly interpreted, and overlaid with a numerological figure, that of a magic square. It is such square that is the most prominent numerological feature in the Taoist ritual. It is crucial for the activation of the 'hidden period', as described by Schipper and Hsiu-huei.57 This is achieved through a rite that com-bines inaudibly uttered formulas and meditation with a dance called The Paces of Yü, after the mystical demiurge that reordered the world after the flood, and was hémiplégie. Accordingly, the officiant, limping with one foot, the right one for even (yin) days, the left one of uneven (yang) days, crisscrosses the central ritual area exactly according to sequence of the nine numbers. The square encodes the number 15, with 5 as the cen-tral number, as shown in fig. 14: 57 Schipper/Hsiu-huei, \"Progressive and Regressive Time Cycles in Taoist Ritual\", p. 199."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"4 9 2 3 5 7 8 1 6 Fig. 14. Magic square of Yü It is at least worthwhile to probe whether there may be any similar impli-cations in the arrangement of the Zoroastrian priests. Taking their posi-tions in the sequence as given in the passage of the Nërangistân, and in-serting between them a space representing 5 in the center, their numeri-cal values would be as follows: 1 zautar (Z); 2 häwanan (H); 3 äsnätar (As); 4 ätpvaxs (At); 5 central field; 6 frabrtar (Fr); 7 raiOwiskara (R); 8 äbitar (Ab); 9 srausawarza (Sr). Plotting these numbers at the nine loca-tions, the distribution of the eight corresponds exactly to the eight outer fields of the Taoist magic square, with the only difference that the left and right columns are inverted, as shown in fig. 15:58 Whether coincidental, or not, the arrangement of the eight priests here also corresponds exactly to the one postulated above: The mortar priest is in the SE, the water fetcher in the NW. The remaining six positions correspond exactly to the prescriptions of the Nërangistân. With all due caution, it is therefore possible that the intuitively more proper initial arrangement, which corresponds to the magic square dance in the Taoist tradition, is the original one in the Zoroastrian tradition.59 The limping dance of Yü may also give a clue to one of the crucial movements in the Zoroastrian ritual, the first movement of the Yasna proper, which is the standing of the two priests, one in the North, the 58 In fact, this \"inverted\" square corresponds to the female yin-square in Taoism, while the male yang-square results by a different rotation of the basic magic square; cf. Lagerwey, Taoist Ritual, p. 133. 59 This arrangement, with the häwanan in the SE, appears to be encoded already in Y. 47.1, which is one of the shortest, but also most significant chapters of the Gathas, the six-stanza Spanta Manyu; see Windfuhr, \"The Logic of the Holy Immortals\", p. 254, with diagram.

This curious posture is certainly one of humility, given that the priests invoke the Divine, as discussed by Modi.60 But it is also cosmological. By this move the two priests re-establish the new cosmic axis: The posture is a representation of the Big Dipper at the celestial North Pole, seen as a one-legged figure, just as the limping, or rather one-legged, dance of Yü retraces the stars of that constellation.61 That is, the ritual not only re-establishes the horizontal dimension, but also the vertical. It is in the North where the zautar stands, so as to protect against the forces of Evil who are said to be in the North, opposed to the Divine in the South. The two arrangements of the eight positions There may be a further coincidence between Taoism and Zoroastrianism with regard to the eight positions. The arrangement of the eight Trigrams shown above represents the 'later heavens', which are shifted in a pecu-liar, but systematic way from an arrangement representing the 'prior heavens',62 that is, the final steps to Inner Time. In Zoroastrianism, there are also two arrangements: the one given above for the Yasna, according to the Nërangistân, and one according to the correlation of the eight priests with the archetypical keswar, or 'continents'. The latter is part of a multiple correlative pattern between priests, the divine, the future sav-ior Sausyant and his helpers at their final Yasna, and the continents, as shown in table 10:63 60 Thus Modi, The Religious Ceremonies and customs of the Parsees, p. 323. 61 Cf.

It is stated in Y. 61.1-3 of the yasnic text itself: ahunam.ca wairyïm fraêsyâmahï an tard, ca zqm an tare, ca asmanam ... hamistayaë.ca nizbdrdtayê.ca aijgrahe mainyd.us ... hamistayaë.ca nizbdrdtayê.ca kayaöanqm.ca ... yätumatqm.ca \"We set in motion the ahuna wairya between heaven and earth ... for the dis-comfiture and removal of the Evil Spirit... for the discomfiture and removal of the sorcerers... and magicians\".64 As shown by Skjasrvo, such passages are modeled on Indo-European mythical heroes who wield huge stones.The manthras have become the quasi-physical weapons of Zarathushtra with which he constantly drives the Evil Spirit from the earth. This is repeatedly expressed. Thus, in Yt. 17.20, the hymn to the divinity of Reward, A§i, Zarathushtra continues his self-introduction to that yazatâ. Part of his proud self-presentation is his power over the Evil Spirit. He cites the complaint by the Evil Spirit that he, Zarathushtra, alone among humans can approach and withstand him. The complaint is specifically about the power of the manthras, not only the ahuna wairya, but also the artam wahu, here, as often, referred to as a Sa wahista: jainti mqm ahuna wairya awawata snaiOisa yaQa katö.masa täpayeiti mqm a$a wahista mqnaydn aheyaOa ayö.xsustdm \"He smashes me with the ahuna wairya as with a weapon like a stone the size of a house.

These constellations in the sky of'stone' are the 'house' over the earth below. In tum, the power of the asa wa-64 Cf. Skjœrv0, \"Zarathustra in the Avesta and in Manicheism.

There may be a more direct connection to the ritual as well, when the actions of the two manthric weapons are seen as part of a single setup: The ahuna waitya as the northern sky has the shape of the inverted mor-tar. The asa wahista as the heated zodiac is the circle of the ritual table itself. Thus, indeed, the pounding and smashing during the combined recitations and ritual actions, the ringing of the mortar to drive the forces of Evil away, and all other major and minor details, properly represent the intricate choreography of the cosmic struggle. But there may be more than these general symbolic meanings. Putting again the two actions together, smashing and melting, these two aspects of the struggle can be directly correlated not only with the pounding in section 4, which is obvious, but also with the otherwise curious action by the main priest at the beginning of section 7, where he throws the residue of the pounded hôm-twigs and the pomegranate twig to the assistant priest, who then oblates it to the fire. It is this oblation that would seem to correspond to the burning or melting about which the Evil Spirit com-plains. If this correlation holds, then, at least in some interpretative tradi-tions, parts of the Evil Spirit, so to speak, must have been perceived as being trapped in the mortar through the actions preceding the pounding, then crushed, and increasingly reduced into metal-like residue through the long and complex manipulations, filterings, and pourings. It is then 'melted' and its evil spirits volatilized by the action of oblating the resi-due to the pure fire (which is also connected to the highest abode of the divine, as suggested above). Ultimately, in traditions along these lines, there may be a reminis-cence, or overlay, of another type of ritual and its utensils: the image of the alchemical mortar, and, given the crucial clue of the enigmatic tâpayati 'he heats', the crucible, and particularly the long kerotakis, with furnace below, and melting metal foil dripping from the top,66 a line of imagery which cannot be further explored here. These observations would support the similarity suggested above between the Zoroastrian mortar and the Taoist incense burner in the center of the area, which ul-timately may represent the alchemical furnace from which the elixir of life and precious metals are refined. 66 For a succinct illustrated survey, see F.S.

Doing so had the objective of identifying in both similar patterns that are specific enough to allow the profiling of findings in the Zoroastrian ritual, made earlier, by contrast. It is far too early to deduce from the abundant simi-larities a direct common source. What does appear common, however, is that both reflect a world view and epistemology that in spite of vast dif-ferences in ideological setting and spatial and temporal distance reflect an approach and world view to ritual that appears to originate in consid-erable measure in Late Hellenism and has been left intact to a consider-able degree in comparison to other traditions where those overt features have been subdued, or simplified, or eliminated. Here is not the place to go any further in this direction given the fact of my utter ignorance of Chinese culture, civilization and history.67 The example of an extraordinarily ancient pattern, and its later ex-pressions, briefly discussed above, was the nine-field square that an-ciently was well and field, and, by the age of the horoscopes, is applied to such apt representations as the thema mundi. Ritual instruments, zodiacal constellations, and millennial scheme A further example for retention of older patterns in the Yasna ritual is the ring cup in the W and the barsom bundle with its girdle in the Ε of the ritual table, one guarded by Mithra at fall equinox, the other by the Guardian Spirits, Frawarti-s, at spring equinox. Both ring and girdle rep-resent the ecliptic, or rather the zodiac, as mentioned. But the bull's hair wound around the ring makes it clear that the equinoctial constellations are not Aries, the Ram, and Libra, the Scales, but Taurus, the Bull, and Scorpio, the Stinger of Death. These ritual correlations across the table may hint at the animal sacrifice that probably was once performed during the ritual. It is also reminiscent of the tauroctony, Mithras stabbing the 67 For a general overview of Chinese science roughly contemporary with Parthian and Sasanian Iran, see the chapter 'The Tao chia (Taoists) and Taoism', and the sub-chapter 'The System of the Book of Changes', in J.

The twelve steps are to represent the twelve successive astronomical, or rather astrological, ages of the precession of the equinoxes. Those, however, go in the opposite direc-tion. That is, as indicated earlier, astronomically our present age of Pi-sces was preceded by the age of Aries, just like Aries was preceded by the age of Taurus, and so forth. Applying this inversion to the entire se-quence, astronomically the beginning would be between Capricorn and Sagittarius (NW of the figure, corresponding to the large water basin), and from the latter it moves counter-clockwise to the end of Capricorn. Assuming that the designers of the Yasna ritual were aware of this fact, it is possible to conclude that the sequence of ritual actions, i.e. steps 1-12, does not trace the course of the world year forward from the begin-ning of creation, but goes in the inverse directions: It begins at the point of transfiguration at the end of Capricorn = month of Ätar 'Fire'/ zôhr cupl with parahôm mixture, and retraces mythical history to its initial point of primordial creation at the beginning of Sagittarius = month of Apäm Napät/ zôhr cup 2 with libation water; that is, as a healing ritual it re-visits the steps of history and concludes by re-establishing the initial order. The correlations between the mytho-historical events and the Zo-roastrian spiritual guardians of the months/world ages would well fit the initial and final events: Ätar alludes to the final ordeal of the molten metal, and the final cosmic Yasna. In turn, Apäm Napät is also known as the creator and fashioner of nar- 'men' (Yt. 19.52), that is, the creative agent at the beginning. To note, he is not only the only divine being called ahura besides Mazdä and Mi0ra, but his name, Apäm Napät 'Off-spring of the Waters', is a kenning for 'Fire',70 that is, the fundamental fire in all, similar to the god Agni in Indian tradition. If the preceding observations hold, the final and thirteenth ritual ac-tion of the Yasna ritual should represent the essential act. To recall, the 69 Note that there are a number of direct correlations between the Zoroastrian ritual table/calendar and the astrological signs. Most evident is the correlation of the two horned moon stands with the two homed zodiacal creatures Taurus and Aries. Less evi-dent are correlations such as that between Amrtät 'Immortality', the spiritual guardian of plants and seeds, with Virgo, whose main star is Spica 'Ear of Com', which was also the earlier designation of this zodiacal sign. 70 Cf.

The assistant priest proceeds to the temple well, or stream of running water. The main priest now exposes the mortar with the parahöm elixir to the fire for a final time, then joins the other at the well, and oblates the elixir to the water. In regressive time, this pouring oblation represents the initial seminal act of generation. It would thus appear that the Zoroastrian Yasna ritual involves indeed both progression, and regression in time, similar to the progression, and the regression to Inner Time, in the Taoist ritual. These few notes may suffice to hint at yet further depths of sacred encoding in the Yasna ritual, which fundamentally is the encoding of the mystery of time.71 A more readily perceivable pattern is encoded in the four comers, which reveals them as four-dimensional space-time points of transition that correspond to the four gates of the Taoist ritual area, but not neces-sarily with the Zoroastrian scheme of the twelve millennia: 6000    9000    Attack of Evil   Zarathushtra   Gate of Earth SE SW Gate of Man Road of Ghosts NE NW Gate of Heaven Zar.'s pre-soul   Transfiguration   3000    0/12000    It also becomes evident that the SE-NW axis of this shared pattern cor-responds to the astrological theory of genesis and apogenesis, i.e. enter-ing and exiting mortal life, in western traditions.72 Epistemological and metaphysical outlook With the recognition of shared features, including more esoteric ones such as these, the comparison has led to the better understanding in re-gard to some basic aspects of the Zoroastrian Yasna ritual, supporting, with due caution, what had been proposed earlier and finding what had never been recognized. At the same time, the comparison reduces to 71 The official modern Iranian calendar continues to begin at spring equinox, and retains the Zoroastrian names of the months. In popular horoscopes they are replaced by the astrological signs, beginning with Aries. 72 See the detailed study by R. Beck, Planetary Gods and Planetary Orders in the Mysteries of Mithras (Leiden, 1988), pp. 93-99 et passim.

Moreover, the most fundamental patterns found are those well known from traditional astronomy and interpretations of the work-ings of the skies. To note, the retention of such patterns does not imply continued ad-herence to those views and beliefs. Ritual actions and texts are partially independent from those and tend to be reinterpreted continuously by its practitioners, and ever so slightly changed. However, the knowledge of the original patterns and of their sources may have continued among Zo-roastrian ritual practitioners and ritual scholars. For example, the pre-scription of using goat's milk in the Yasna ritual, as commonly indicated in modern descriptions, may be just one further item of evidence for the application of such knowledge: It is not so specifically prescribed in the older texts, which allow the milk of any animal. The goat's milk, how-ever, is reminiscent of the zodiacal sign of the Goat(fish)/Capricorn, which as mentioned corresponds to the very first of the twelve ritual ac-tions, and possibly to the beginning of creation. That is, the specification of the kind of milk may have been triggered by such correlative interpre-tations. It should be recalled that the knowledge of the sky was emphatically sponsored under both the Parthians and the Sasanians. In particular, as succinctly summarized by Pmgree,73 there were two periods of intensive translation activities: first under ArdashTr I (224-239) and Shäpür I (239-270), and then, with thorough revisions and new Iranian astronomical and astrological inventions, under Khosrow I AnösTrwän (531-579). More-over, there is an indigenous Zoroastrian tradition74 about the study of sci-entific works from abroad, and the application of this knowledge to the sacred texts. Such an activity is hinted at by typical (Middle Persian) phrases such as abäg abastäg abäz handäxt (Dënkard 4.21 ),75 which may be rendered variously as 'restored to', 'joined with', or 'compared with the Avesta', i.e. the sacred texts. As suggested above, such pious activity may have included the numerological adjustments of the most sacred prayers, 73 D. Pingree, From Astral Omens to Astrology.

Another case in point is the thema mundi in Bundahisn chpt. 5, dis-cussed above. In fact, according to Pingree,76 it is datable to about 500 A.D., and shows the nativity of Gayömart, the proto-human in Zoroas-trian world history. More specifically, it is a skillful Iranian adaptation and development of the Indian horoscope of a mahä-purusa, the Indian proto-human, including the seven planets in the zodiacal signs of their exaltations. As such, its appearance in the Bundahisn evidences the com-plex history of the scientific intercourse between Mesopotamia, India, Greece, and Iran. To return to the epistemological and metaphysical outlook, whatever the specific adjustments may have been: Overarching all is what may be captured by the notion of compulsive and repulsive harmony. It is to be achieved and is cosmic, in multiple, complex but ordered complementaries and hierarchies, in the chiastic dialectic of unequal pairs. Such are the pairs of the three neuter and three feminine Holy Immortals. Similarly, while Ahura Mazda is superordi-nate to the pair of the primordial spirits, Spanta Manyu and Ahra Manyu, those two are unequal themselves when seen in the ultimate cycle of the World Year.77 The arrangement of the ritual area as three mutually embedded worlds; the arrangement of the ritual instruments in form of a calendar; the arrangement of the eight priests around the 'true earth' of the ritual area: These are seen, it appears, not as composed of entities as such but as parts of, or nodes in, a world matrix of progressive cycles, or rather spirals when seen in time. The example briefly discussed was the six so-called 'elements', which can be recognized as both hierarchically and pair-wise ordered states of matter, reflected in the Zoroastrian myth of the seven 'creations', of which the seventh is humankind. The arrange-ment of the ritual actions with their texts following the calendar reflects the order of cyclical time towards an end, combining the sacred number nine with twelve. These patterns, it would seem, are at least in part sup-ported by similar pattern in Taoism, including the nine-fold ritual action after the initial establishment of the altar. As such, what is called sacred numerology captures the notion of a world matrix: the numerological encoding of celestial cycles in the sa-cred texts, 12 for the year, 18 for the Saros cycle of the eclipses, 19 for 76 Pingree, Astral Omens, p. 50. 77 Cf.

This is not different from encoding the arrangement of the physical cosmos in the ritual area, and in the text itself, since lan-guage is linear and cyclical, poesis; nor is it different from the encoding in movement of the two magic squares made by the eight priests. Creating this harmony in one Yasna service prepares for the next in the great cycle, which cannot be interrupted.

These passages are discussed in the light of the Indian conception of the 'inte-riorization' of the sacrifice showing some common patterns with the Zoroastrian one. Such a comparison sheds new light on the exoteric and speculative dimension of the Indo-Iranian ritual thought. 1. MEANING AND FUNCTION OF THE AVESTAN VERB YAZ-AND THE QUESTION OF SACRIFICIAL IMMOLATION IN THE ZOROASTRIAN TRADITION1 The yasna ('the act of worship, sacrifice and consecration') is the centre of the ritual dimension of the Mazdean culture,2 which presents a deep and complex symbolism and a number of remarkable speculative con-ceptions. These refer to a meta-temporal and extra-mundane state, where divine and human beings are put in communication. The performance of the ritual, in particular through the action designated with the Avestan verb yaz.-3 involved many different forms of religious behaviour and 1 The following abbreviations are used to refer to Iranian texts: Ny. = Niyäyi§n; Yt. = Yaât; Y. = Yasna; Vd. = Widëwdâd; Ir.Bd. = Iranian Bundahiân. 2 I have offered a general discussion on the Zoroastrian ritual dimension in my forth-coming text of the Quatre leçons au Collège de France, entitled Rite, parole et pensée dans l'Avesta ancien et récent. Quatre leçons au Collège de France (Paris, forthco-ming). 3 On this concept see the different reflections offered by E. Benveniste, \"Sur la termi-nologie iranienne du sacrifice\", Journal Asiatique 252, 1964, pp. 45-58; J. Haudry, L'emploi de cas en vedique.

This in fact is the meaning very often attested in the other Middle Iranian traditions.5 Actually there are some Avestan passages in which the verb yaz- refers to a real immolation.6 In some special cases this verb probably designates a form of veneration, i.e. the oral expression of a prayer or the immediate mention of the name of a divinity. This is per-haps the case of MiOra, whom the heads of the countries have to imme-diately worship on the battlefield before the enemy (Yt. 10, 8-9).7 Apart from that, we have to remark that the notion of \"veneration\" was prop-1977), p. 49; J.

Narten (Kleine Schriften, pp. 299-300) who discussed some Late Avestan passages (Yt. 5, 21, etc. and Yt. 9, 3 etc.) which show the verb yaz- plus the double accusative (name of the god and a numeral referring to the number of the animals to be sacrificed as, e.g. tqmyazata... satdm aspanqm hazarjrdm gauuqm...). She suggested to emend them assuming that in these cases the original construction had the verb yaz-governing the acc. of the name of the worshipped divinity but also the locative of the things to be obtained by means of the ritual act (tqmyazata... satde aspanqm hazaijrae gauuqm ... \"he worshipped her in order to obtain one hundred of horses, one thousand of bulls\"). This interpretation has been independently contested by J. Kellens (\"Langues et religions de l'Iran\", p. 742) and by me and my pupil Circassia (L'inno avestico a Druuâspâ. Tesi di laurea in Filologia Iranica. Universitàdegli Studi di Bologna. Facoltà di Conservazione dei Beni Culturali. Sede di Ravenna (unpublished; Ravenna, 1998— 99), pp. 47, 101-105). The criticism does not strictly concern the philological points of the emendation to be introduced on the text of Geldner, but the meaning of such a special construction according to Narten's solution. In fact the locative should have an elliptic temporal value according to Kellens (\"lorsque l'on offre cent étalons ... lors de la cérémonie où l'on offre cent étalons\") or that of limitation (\"in the number of one hundred horses ..., or in the amount ofhundred horses...\") according to me and Circas-sia. 7 See I. Gershevitch, The Avestan Hymn to MiOra (Cambridge, 2nd ed. 1967; 1st ed. 1959), pp. 76-79.

We also find expressions in which the construction yaz- yasndm occurs. In many cases this referred to the consecration and veneration of an Avestan text. In this respect I have to underline the fact that the main part of the Gä0ic liturgy can be simply described as a \"liturgy of the word\", i.e., more clearly as an offering to Ahura Mazdä of the most sa-cred texts practically without the performance of complex acts or of ritual ceremonies.8 In some circumstances, however, the worship, in particular when accompanied by the oblation of sacrificial 'meat' (mii-azda-, \"Opferspeise\"),9 or by libations of haomic milk and of conse-crated water (zaoOra-), offerings of bread, butter or simply through the recitation of ritual formulas, can be assumed as representing a direct continuation of a 'sacrificial tradition'. Such a tradition not necessarily has to be understood in the restricted sense of an actual immolation or of an animal sacrifice, but as a symbolic sacrifice or consecration to be offered to Ahura Mazdä, the Amasa Spantas, the yazatas (i.e. the wor-shipful minor divine beings) or other abstract and concrete concepts. In addition, also in the circumstances where no action was performed, as in the just mentioned case of the GäBic liturgy, it can be rightly questioned if yaz- exclusively referred to an adoration, more or less in a Christian sense (or more precisely in a certain way of representing the Christian sense),10 or if we have to do with an abstraction or with a symbolization of an original sacrificial act, which actually was metaphorically trans-formed—through a substitution—into a vegetal or liquid offering or into 8 See A. Panaino, forthcoming. 9 Bartholomae, Altiranisches Wörterbuch, col. 1193; as M. Haug, Essays on the Sacred Language, Writings, and Religion of the Parsis (London, 1883), p. 139, 2, noted, the Parsis' attempt of interpreting this word as 'fruit' is incorrect. 10 In fact the mass, especially in the Catholic tradition, contains a real repetition of the sacrifice of Christ in flesh and blood, which in any case is assumed to actually represent a real immolation thanks to the so called transubstantiation (\"the real change of substance\"). In other words, without a physical sacrifice, the bread and the wine are assumed to have been substantially (and not simply) modified and transformed in flesh and blood. Of course, this doctrine does not correspond to the Lutheran and to the Calvinist ones, but it shows how an archaic sacrificial tradition can find a deep persis-tence. On the other hand, as W. Burkert, Mito e rituale in Grecia. Structure and History in Greek Mythology and Ritual ( 1979), trans. F. Nuzzacco (Roma/Bari, 1996), pp. 90-91, has shown, the use of bread instead of flesh and of wine instead of blood, is a prac-tice originating in the Bronze Age.

I would like to point out that specifically in the case of Yt. 8, Ahura Mazda performs ayasna-in which the individual name of Tistrya is mentioned (azdm yd ahurö mazda tistrim .... aoxtö.namanayasnayaze \"It is I, Ahura Mazda, who worship Tistrya ... with a sacrifice in which (his) name is uttered\").14 Then the definition of these yasnas and of this in particular simply as a 'worship' would result in a pure game of words. On the contrary, I be-lieve that thanks to this ritual act, i.e. with such a yasna- to be under-stood as a 'sacrifice', he was celebrating a rite aiming at the enforcement of this divinity, according to a doctrine of the sacrifice which is directly confirmed in Pahlavi literature15 and that was well attested in Vedic India too.16 I do not know whether the strength that was transferred '1 See the discussion of the problem in Zaehner, The Teachings of the Magi, pp. 126-130. The haoma- (Pähl, höm) is the name of an intoxicant plant and of a beverage obtained trough its pressure; in some cases mixed with milk (haomic milk). The same term is also used for the divinity associated with this plant. 12 For the Vedic side see Ch. Malamoud, Cuire le monde. Rite et pensée dans l'Inde ancienne (Paris, 1989), pp. 54-55. We may recall that when Haoma, in Yt. 9, 17, per-forms the act of yaz-, this verb governs only the accusative of the pronoum referred to the divinity to be 'worshipped' (in this case Druväspä) while there is no mention of the animals to be offered to her. As Benveniste, \"Sur la terminologie iranienne du sacri-fice\", p. 46, has remarked, such a construction in which the verb \"est pris absolument\" is different from the other ones attested in the same hymn, where the primordial sacrifi-cers also offer in sacrifice a number of animals and the verb yaz- governs two different grammatical cases (See again note n. 5). Rightly Benveniste, \"Sur la terminologie iranienne du sacrifice\", pp. 46-47, stated that in this very case the value of yaz- cannot be surely established. 13 See A. Panaino, Tistrya. V ol. 1.

By the way, in this very case, it is difficult to try to say more about a ritual directly performed by the high-est god or to try to identify this special kind of yasna- with any practical action. In fact we do not have any clear description of it and we do not know what a form of sacrificial behavior was properly attributed to Ahura Mazdä, because his state is completely different from that of the human beings, and, for instance, sacrificial death and ritual immolation probably were behaviors extraneous to his paradisiacal dimension.17 On the other hand it is clear that the yasna- here reveals the nature of the supernatural power stemming from the sacrifice in se. This was such a great power that the same Ahura Mazdä had to produce it by means of the act of yaz- with a yasna-. In other words, the sacrifice was a creative performance.18 This is particularly true in the case of the ritual sacrifice offered by Zurwän in order to generate a son or in the recitation of the hymns performed by the Indian god Prajäpati.19 In both cases these ritu-als were not perfectly fulfilled: Zurwän doubted of the result of his sacri-fice and thus generated both Ohrmazd (from the sacrifice itself) and Ahreman (from the doubt); Prajäpati produced the devas (the gods) dur-ing the diurnal recitation but generated also the asuras (the demons) during the night.

However, in the Pahlavi literature we come across a kind of 'metaphysics' of the sacrifice, established and performed by Ohrmazd in the mënôg state (see Bd.Ir., Ill, 23):24 ohr-mazd abäg amahraspandän pad rapihwin gâh mënôg yazisn fräz säxt andar yazisn kunisn dâm hamâg bë däd... \"Ohrmazd with the Amah-raspand at the Rapihwin time (i.e. 'at Midday') prepared the celestial sacrifice\" (or \"the spiritual (performance) of the sacrifice\", if we read mënôg ï yazisn). \"During the performance of the sacrifice, the entire creation was created\". Immolations were in any case continuously performed throughout the Iranian and Mazdean religious traditions, from the Achaemenid till the end of the Sasanian periods, as it is confirmed by Herodotus and Xeno-phon25 or by the Armenian sources.26 In the Sasanian inscription of Säbuhr at the Ka'ba-i Zardust (see, e.g. ch. 35 and ff.) we find an im-pressive number of lambs (Pähl, and Parth. akbrid; Gr. πρόβατον) to be offered in sacrifice together with 'bread' (Pähl, and Parth. nän\\ Gr. 20 Zaehner, Zurvan, A Zoroastrian Dilemma, p. 69. 21 Zaehner, The Teachings of the Magi, p. 150. 22 Zaehner, The Teachings of the Magi, pp. 148-149. 23 See Zaehner, Zurvan, A Zoroastrian Dilemma, pp. 210-211, n. 8. 24 Cf.

On the contrary, it was allowed to strangle them.28 Chapter XI of the Sâyest në-Sâyest carefully describes how a göspand which has been slaughtered has to be divided in pieces (göspand ka kust udpärag kard), that belong to the singular divinities.29 In any case, as noted by Benveniste,30 according to the Armenian sources, the clear Persian loan-words, yast 'sacrifice' andyazel 'to sacrifice' evidently refer to an ani-mal immolation; it is also to be remarked that, in the description of the sacrifice celebrated by Zurwän, Eznik uses the expression yast(s) arnel 'to offer sacrifices', while Ohrmazd isyastacin 'born from the sacrifice'; in particular Eznik makes a polemical issue of such a primordial sacrifice performed by Zurwän, wondering about \"what did he offer at all\", if the animals were not yet created?

Apropos, we have also to consider the fact that the Hindu traditions, when they have assumed a strong vegetarian orientation, did not elimi-nate or erase the Vedic ritual, but this has actually assumed only a meta-phoric value without any direct correspondence to the ancient rituals of animals' immolation evoked in the recited texts. In the Zoroastrian mi-lieu, for instance, no animal is killed, but, as already Haug34 underlined, \"only some hair of an ox is placed in a small vessel and shown together with the other things, to the fire. This is nowadays the only remnant of animal sacrifice on this occasion, but formerly they used a piece of meat besides\". 2. THE 'INTERIORIZATION' OF THE SACRIFICE ACCORDING TO THE AVESTAN TEXTS In the following pages I would like to focus on some Avestan texts pre-senting us with a particular conception which concerns a kind of'interi-orization' of theyasna according to a pattern that—as we will see—can find very close correspondences in the Brähmanical literature. Such a developed and speculative conception of the sacrificial rite does not appear only in the Later Avesta, and then in the Pahlavi texts, but it is already attested in the first two paragraphs of chapter 39 of the Yasna Haptarjhäiti, where it is stated: 31 Benveniste, \"Sur la terminologie iranienne du sacrifice\", pp. 50-51. 32 Panaino, Tistrya, pp. 81-82, 145-146. 33 See S.

In par-ticular in Yt. 6, 4, it is stated that the worship of the Sun implies that of Ahura Mazdä, of the Amssa Spantas and of the uruuan- of the priest performing the ceremony. This kind of climax is very important; in fact, through the act of yaz- the uruuan- of the worshipper/sacrificer himself was elevated into the sphere of the divine world. The importance of these passages has already been underlined by Shaked, who noted that some formulas as ruwän ïxwës räy, az bahr ï ruwân \"for the sake of the soul, of one's own soul\", which are attested throughout the Pahlavi literature, depend on a doctrine in which the sake of the uruuan- was considered as a basic concept. It is for this reason that whoever is sinful becomes also an 'enemy of (his own) soul', and thus can be considered as a ruwän-dusman, according to Dënkard VI, 236.41 In fact, like Ahreman, he produces his own destruction, in other words, the destruction of his own soul. Shaked has rightly underlined the seminal impact of this Iranian doctrine concerning the sacrifice for the sake of the soul on some Islamic traditions and Muslim literature. In addition he has also remarked how such an idea of the worship of the uruuan- might be connected to the doctrine of the superiority of the immortal parts of the human personality, such as the frauuaSi- and the daënâ-, and, of course also the uruuan- which would have been given a sort of divine honor. However, there seems to be another important rea-son for this kind of worship. Thus, we may mention the fact that Skjasrvo42 has recently stressed the importance of this particular kind of worship of the uruuan- and of the frauuaSi-, to be considered as \"con-tributions to the regeneration of the new ahu\" ('life'). In particular he has also emphasized the deep significance of the sacrifice twice offered in the Frawardïn Yast, st. 149, 155, to all the basic and essential compo-nents of the human being (ahümca daënqmca baoSasca uruuändmca 41 Cf.

What does it signify to yaz- the uruuan (in particular the sacrificer's uruuan-) or to yaz- the frauuaSi-Ί What is the meaning of the gift of the ustana-Ί We have to recall that, in the Yasna Haptaijhäiti, the worship offered to the uruuan- of the Cow and to Gsus Tasän (\"the Fashioner of the Cow\") is given the same importance as that of the uruuans of the worshippers/sacrificers, of the animals, and in general of the followers of Asa. But the reference to the uruuans of the animals cannot be consid-ered as completely independent from the idea of an animal immolation, real or simply (and perhaps more probably) only symbolic during that ritual. Does this mean that the worship/consecration of the uruuan- is also a metaphoric sacrifice of the uruuan itself? Or that, at least symboli-cally, it represents the sacrifice/consecration of the uruuan- of the wor-shipper/sacrificer himself? These questions are not only theoretical; in fact, if we consider Y. 37, 3, the interpretation of the following passage in particular raises a number of problems: t§m ahmäkäis azddbïscâ ustänäiscä yazamaidë tdm aSäunqm frauuaSïs narqmcä nârinqmcâ yazamaidë We can prudently translate this passage as \"We worship him (i.e. Ahura Mazdä) with our bones and animations. We worship him with (our) frauuaSis of followers of Asa, men and women\". With this translation we do not avoid the problem of the meaning of such a worship with, through or by means of \"bones, animations and frauuaSis\". It is far-fetched to understand the passage in a proto-Christian sense, as \"by of-fering to him a worship with all our body and soul\" with a devotional meaning like \"with all my heart\". I suspect that the literal and inner meaning was another one: \"We sacrifice (or better 'we consecrate') to him our bones and animations. We sacrifice (or 'we consecrate') to him (our) frauuaSis of followers of Asa, men and women\". If such a transla-"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"tion seems to be provocative, I would like to emphasize the fact that it has not to be explained as an immolation of these spiritual parts, i.e. as a sort of ritual suicide, but as symbolical offerings given to Ahura Mazdä. In addition, it is not by chance—I believe—that after the mention (in Y. 34,13) of the 'path' (aduuan-) and of the 'prize' (mïÉda-), the following stanza (Y. 34, 14a) refers to the gift offered by Mazdä to the corporeal animation (astuuant- us tan α-).Λ2' 3. THE 'INTERIORIZATION' OF THE SACRIFICE ACCORDING TO THE SATAPATHA BRÄHMANA All these Avestan passages mentioning the consecration of the soul should be discussed in the light of some Brähmanical speculations about the sacrifice. In this respect I would like to attract the attention of the reader in particular on a noteworthy passage of the S atapatha Brähmana, XI, 2, 6, 13-14 (which I quote according to the translation of Eggeling:44 XI, 2, 6, 13-14:45 (13) tad âhuh âtmayâjîsreyän devayâjïty ätmayäjTti ha brüyätsa ha vä ät-mayâjî yo vededam me 'nenängam samskriyata idam me 'nenärigam upadhîyata iti sa yathähis tvacö nirmucyetaivam asmän martyächarirät päpmano nirmucyate sa pim ayo yajurmayah sämamaya ähutimayahsvar-gam lokam abhisambhavati.

Such a kind of interiorization of the sacrifice has also been discussed by Malamoud,48 who has in particular remarked that the samnyäsin becomes an ätma-yäjin (\"he who sacrifices to himself—or— who sacrifices himself')49 by heating his tapas to a temperature where there are no more distinctions among the divinities, the priests offering the sacrifice and the victims. This conception emphasizes a complete renunciation on the side of the offering priest and, at the same time, gives, for instance, an explanation to the peculiar funeral reserved only for the samnyäsin. He, in fact, has not to be burnt or cremated but can simply be inhumed. Actually this happens because the samnyäsin has already been 'cooked' during his life and thus it is unnecessary that he will be burnt again. 46 Cf. M. Biardeau/Ch. Malamoud, Le sacrifice dans l'Inde ancienne (Bibliothèque de l'Ecole des hautes Etudes - Sciences Religieuses 79; Louvain/Paris, 1996), pp. 57-58: \"On dit: \"Lequel est supérieur, celui qui sacrifie aux dieux ou celui qui sacrifie au Soi (ou à lui même - ätman)T On doit répondre: \"Celui qui sacrifice au Soi.\" Celui qui sacrifie au Soi, c'est celui qui se dit ceci: \"Par ce (sacrifice), mon corps que voici est formé, mon corps que voici est fondé.\" Comme un serpent est débarrassé de sa peau, il est débarrassé de ce corps mortel et mauvais et, fait de Rc, de yajus et de säman, fait d'oblations, il naît dans le monde céleste. Tandis que celui qui sacrifie aux dieux, c'est celui qui se dit: \"J'offre ce sacrifice aux dieux, je fais cette offrande aux dieux.\" Comme un inférieur offre un bali à un supérieur ou un vaisya à un roi, c'est ainsi qu'il offre, et il ne gagne pas une place aussi importante que l'autre (dans l'au-delà)\".

It is quite probable that such a conception, as Lévi wrote, \"s'achemine vers l'Upanisad qui clôt le Çatapatha\".51 It is clear that the present comparison is limited to the common pat-tern of a sacrifice, or of a consecration, which was directed in favor of— or—directed to the \"ipseity\" of the priest(s) celebrating the ritual. Still, it opens some fresh perspectives on the speculative dimension of the Maz-dean yasna, which, for instance has been focused on by Gh. Gnoli52 with reference to the concept of maga-5i and more recently and with different arguments by Kellens.54 The possibility that the Avestan speculations on the ritual and on the doctrine of the interiorization of the sacrifice—or of the self-consecration—have known an evolution, at least partly compa-rable with that of the Brähmanical tradition and of the oldest Upanisads, seems to me worthy of discussion. Of course, such a comparison needs some strict clarification. No doubt that the Avestan uruuan- and the Vedic atman- do not correspond to each other on the etymological side. In addition, they refer to two different systems in which they play an important role. On the other hand, both concern—each one in the limits of its cultural dimension—a particular aspect/function which55 was fundamental for any living being. Therefore the Avestan uruuan- and the Vedic atman- can both be con-sidered as reflecting comparable concepts. More precisely, the Avestan passages here quoted mention a special kind of worship/consecration of the hauua- uruuan- 'his own (inner) soul' (haom uruuändmyaz-), and of the hauuâ- frauuaSi- 'his own pre-existing soul' (hauuqm frauuaSïm yaz-), but also the gift of the ustana- (the animation). This kind of con-secration was performed according to a conception which, at this point of the discussion, can be directly compared to that of the sacrifice to the 50 Lévi, La doctrine du sacrifice dans les Brâhmanas, p. 78. 51 Lévi, La doctrine du sacrifice dans les Brâhmanas, p. 78. 52 Gh.

Apropos we have to recall that the ätman- is not only a reflexive pronoun,57 but that such a stem can refer to the body, sometimes to the very person, to the 'ipseity' or to the animated breath. 4. CONSECRATION AND SELF-CONSECRATION. THE RITUAL PATH AND THE ASCENT OF THE SOUL Without entering into far-fetched hypotheses, I would like to stress the inner aspect of this particularly meditative and psychological dimension of the yasna- offered to the uruuan- as mentioned in these Avestan texts (with or without the presence of the sacrifice to the frauuaSi-, as, e.g., in the case of Κ 71, 18). These sources seem to presuppose a ritual conse-cration of the components of the human being. I think that this religious doctrine does not simply refer to a sort of journey of the uruuan- on the celestial path, as Kellens has rightly suggested.58 In the Later Avesta and in the Yasna Haptaijhäiti this is expressed through the doctrine of the ascension of this uruuan- to the divine level of Ahura Mazdä and the Amasa Spsntas. This elevation or ascension seems to have been obtained also by means of an interiorized consecration. It is not by chance that the ritual act of yaz- directed to the uruuan- and to the frauuaSi- in Κ 71,18 followed that directed to the Staota Yesnyas, because the worship of the inner soul, i.e. of the uruuan-, and of the protective and pre-existent soul, the frauuaSi-, was linked to the consecration offered to the sacred word and to its primordial energy. These texts are in accordance with the same tradition attested in Κ 55,1 where all the components of the spiri-tual and physical dimension of the human being are offered as a gift to the GäOäs. However, I would like to stress another important consideration ad-vanced by Malamoud59 regarding the subject of the interiorization of the 56 See J. Narten, Der Yasna Haptaijhâiti (Wiesbaden, 1986), p. 181, n. 51. 57 In this respect the presence of hauua- (his own, suus) before the mention of the uruuan- and the frauuaSi- has to be taken into consideration. 58 Kellens, in Kellens/Pirart, Les textes vieil-avestiques 1, p. 34; Kellens, Zoroastre et l'Avesta ancien, pp. 50-51; Herrenschmidt/Kellens, \"La question du rituel dans le mazdéisme ancien et achéménide\", p. 49. 59 Malamoud, Cuire le monde , pp. 10-11."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"sacrifice. He writes: \"offrir un sacrifice au Soi c'est poser d'emblée que sacrifiant et divinité coïncident\". But, in order to become like a god, worthy of sacrifice, devatä, it is necessary that the sacrificer becomes in his own turn the matter of the oblation of the sacrifice. Thus, we can perhaps find out an additional argument in favor of Kellens' supposi-tion60 concerning the voyage of the cow's uruuan- to heaven in company of the daênâ- of the priest performing the act of yaz-, because a doctrine concerning the ritual elevation, through the consecration, of the compo-nents of the soul is doubtless attested and is a result of parallel Indian and Iranian speculations. We have to note that, apparently, the worship offered to the daënâ- is not stressed in these later sources as in the case of those passages refer-ring to the uruuan- and to the frauuaSi-. We can suspect that this hap-pened in force of a special reason, possibly reflecting the Later Avesta systématisation of the concept of afterlife. In fact, while the individual daënâ- corresponding to the soul-vision in the Later Avesta represents the final result of the entire human life in female form and conception, the uruuan-, as the male component par excellence of the soul, is the part in which the priest mostly might identify himself.61 It is this uruuan that the sacrificer desired to launch on the sacrificial road through the act of the sacrifice. The data attested in the parallel Indian sources suggest that also the Avestan passages here discussed present us with a special meaning of the symbolical offering or consecration of the uruuan- and of the frauuaSi- to Ahura Mazdä. In this way these parts of the human soul can be put in motion on the ritual path and rise to heaven. Thus, while the animal uruuan- was offered (being the animal 'killed', truly or symboli-cally), that of the sacrificer was only symbolically consecrated and then offered to god. This is only a hypothesis, based on the comparison with the Indian practices and conceptions of the so called âtmayajna-, which sheds new light on some aspects of the Mazdean tradition that could be considered ecstatic and esoteric, and in same cases even shamanic.621 would like to remark that this act of raising and launching some inner 60 J.

In the framework of an esoteric dimension, that also involves an exteriorized aspect. 5. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS In this framework we also have to take into consideration the interesting hypothesis proposed by Pirart63 who expressly has developed some per-spectives already focused on by Malamoud about the symbolic meaning of a Vedic ritual called dïksâ, which concerns the yajamäna-, i.e. \"the person for whom the sacrifice is offered\" and not the \"sacrificer\" stricto sensu as the person who performs the ritual. Unfortunately, such a dis-tinction does not expressly exist in Iran, because we do not have a strict term of comparison. In any case, the dïksâ shows that the yajamäna-who desired to ascend and to enter in the world of the gods, but who was not an initiated priest, might be elevated to the dimension of the sacrum thanks to his consecration. In other words, he had to be ritually \"sacri-ficed\".64 Without a real immolation, but simply through that of the soma—symbolically corresponding to his own soul—, the yajamäna-was thus immolated in favor of the gods by the priests, who in force of the privilege of their birth and initiation already belong to the world of the sacred. In fact, the priest—through the dïksâ—gave to the yaja-mäna- all the necessary means to substitute his own spiritual function. Such a mime of the human sacrifice65 in some aspects seems to recall the hidden pattern underlying the concept of a worship offered to the uruuan- and/or to the frauuaSi- by the priests (and perhaps also by the protectors of the sacrifice) performing the yasna-. This ritual tradition presupposes a consecration of the inner components of the human iden-tity. Moreover, Pirart mentions the offering of milk taken by a sacrificial 63 E.

In conclusion, this kind of worship and consecration does not simply reflect a common Zoroastrian pattern in which everything could have been worshipped, but presents us with a special view of the yasna-, in which all the components of the human ontology, mortal (as the ustana-) and immortal,66 inner as the uruuan-, or external as the frauuaSi-, were worshipped, venerated and at the same time consecrated. This is true in particular in the case of the uruuans of the worshippers/sacriftcers, souls which could perhaps also metaphorically represent all the human uruuans. In our texts, however, the uruuans strictly belong to the priests performing the ceremony, while the mention of the uruuans of the aSauuans (Y. 39,2) seems to refer to all the members of the community in a general sense, living or dead. I would like to point out that there is a difference between the reflex-ive act of worshipping/consecrating his/their own soul(s) and that of worshipping/consecrating the uruuans of other beings, animals or hu-mans. As a matter of fact, through the consecration of his own uruuan-, the priest was directly referring to his present ritual act, and became able to make his inner part capable of meeting god through the symbolic gift of his soul. In fact, as Kellens has remarked: \"Offrir aux dieux l'immor-talité implique que le sacrifice comporte l'offrande de quelque chose qui est considéré comme immortel\".67 The references to the consecration of the uruuans of the animals, wild or domestic, like that of the uruuan- of the Cow, as again mentioned in Y. 39, 1-2, can perhaps in their own turn represent the (symbolic?) offering of the souls of these animals suitable to be immolated,68 and which will probably take the place of the soul of the priests.69 In any case they remain on a different level with respect to the doctrine of the self-consecration of the soul of the sacrifi-cer. In this connection, we have to quote, following Kellens,70 the impor-tant passage of Ρ 33 \\gaospdnta gaohudä baoSasca uruuândmcâ fraësi-66 J.

This text shows that the baoôah- (consciousness) and the uruuan- of the Cow were sent to men's eyes, i.e. to the eyes of the priests performing the ritual, i.e. that they were offered through the im-molation of the Cow. The technical meaning of this sentence is not clear; perhaps it signifies that thanks to human intermediation the gods invited to the yasna- might see the offerings and take part of them. These ideas of the ritual and initiatic death of the worshipper/ sacrifi-cer and in particular that of the self-consecration of the soul underline the importance of the speculative dimension of the Indian and Iranian rituals and deeply emphasize the crucial position of the priest during the ritual performance, as the actual protagonist of the 'sacrifice' and of the meeting with the divinity, to which he has to ascend with his soul."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"SMASHING URINE: ON YASNA 48.10 Prods Oktor Skjaerv0 In this paper, I shall discuss a passage in the Old Avestan GäOäs, the ancient Iranian hymns that, according to the post-Gathic tradition, were sung by Zarathustra.1 Although the passage in question is grammatically straightforward, at least by Old Avestan standards, yet, opinions have varied greatly about how to interpret it. I shall propose that an interpreta-tion based on the apparent meaning of the words is not to be dismissed offhand, since it points to a well-known Indo-Iranian myth. This is the myth of the dragon-slaying and the release of the fertilizing heavenly waters upon the earth.2 I shall conclude that the passage contains a disparaging statement to the effect that the rival poet-sacrificers' sacrifice of the haoma has not had the desired effect of removing the forces of chaos. This, in tum, would seem to imply that our poet-sacrificer's sacrifice does have the desired effect, and provides an argument for assuming that the haoma sacrifice, which played a central and crucial role in the Young Avestan sacrifice, the yasna, had the same function in the ritual performed in Old Avestan times. THE BATTLE AGAINST CHAOS We know that the GäOäs, at least as early as the Young Avestan period, a few centuries after they were composed, were recited on the five days preceding the New Year, that is spring equinox, and, as ritual texts, they ' Cf.

Note that there is a similar rhetorical question in Rigveda 1.81.3: \"whom will you smash (be smashing)?\" (appropriately in the present subjunctive) accompa-nied by another question, which, this time, is answered explicitly.11 Rigveda 1.81.3c-d yuksvä madacyùtâ hàrî kâm hânah kàm vàsau dadho 'smàm indra vâsau dadhah \\ \\ 9 Apparently in the sense of a future past (futurum exactum), as in Yasna 45.11 yastâ daêuuâng aparô maSiiqscâ / tarâmqstâ \"(He) who, on account ofthat (good thought?) in the future shall have scorned the daëuuas.\" 10 See Κ.

Note also that the translation of ajdn as future by Bartholomae, etc., was based on insufficient understanding of the use of the injunctive at the time. It was to remedy this situation that Karl Hoffmann undertook the study of the injunctive in the Rigveda.12 The only moderately ambiguous word in the line is the gen. sing. ahiiä, which can be anaphoric 'his', referring to an already mentioned or an unknown entity, or a demonstrative 'this', either going with madahiiä 'of this intoxication' or 'this one's', referring to the speaker or someone in the immediate context of the hymn or in the speaker's vicinity. The only syntactic ambiguity is in the function of the neuter noun müOrsm, which can be the subject or direct object of ajdn. At face value, the sentence can therefore be rendered as: 1. When would the urine of (t)his intoxication smash ...? 2. When would he smash the urine of (t)his intoxication? The expected answer, again, is probably \"never\". With either translation, the problem remains that neither is the context immediately clear about the implications of the statements, nor does the rest of the Avesta contain any similar statements. No wonder then, that scholars in the past have tried various ways of making sense of the strophe. The main tactics have been to do things to the verb ajdn and to the subject or direct object müOrdm. Thus, Bartholomae, followed by most scholars in the first half of the century, analyzed ajdn as a 2nd singular from a compound verb ä-jan-, hence his translation: 'When will you (i.e., Ο God) deal a blow to the filth of this intoxication?' In the late 1950s, however, it was shown by Avestan scholars that the analysis as 2nd singular of the verb jan-, Old Indie han-, is impossible. If from jan-, the form must be a 3rd singular, differing from the 2nd singular as follows: Indo-Europ. Indo-Iranian proto-Iranian Old Avestan 2nd sing. *e-gyhen-s *a-j han-s *a-jan-h > *ajarjh *ajäng 3rd sing. *e-gyhen-t *a-j han-t *a-jan-t  ajdn  (in Young Avestan replaced by janat) 12 On the assumed future use of the injunctive, see Hoffmann, Der Injunktiv im Veda, pp. 27-29."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Thus, Helmut Humbach, who also took the form to be from ä-jan-, in his English translation, rendered the line as 'When will (someone) kick over the (vessel of) urine of that (demon of) intoxication'13 implying that it was the vessel containing the haoma that was overturned. This is not a likely meaning of the compound ä-jan-, however, as Rigvedic ä-han-means 'striking sth. into sth'. After Humbach, still other ways of circumventing the problem have been tried. Thus, Jean Kellens and Eric Pirart in their edition of the GäOäs pro-posed a slightly different analysis, taking ajën to be the 3rd singular aorist of gam- 'go, come',14 which did not much improve the meaning.

This approach has been tried by Stanley Insler and Martin Schwartz. Insler posited a verb aj- meaning 'to fear', comparing Greek àk-homai, etc., and derived müßra- from mü- 'be deluded, foolish', also not attest- ed in Avestan or elsewhere in Iranian languages.15 He argued that Young Avestan müOra- means 'feces', not 'urine' (against the Old Indie evi- dence, where mütra apparently means only 'urine'), and that the common Young Avestan word for 'urine' is maësman-.

Schwartz posited a verb aj- meaning 'to ban, taboo, remove unclean objects', comparing Greek àgos 'fault', etc., and took mûOra- to mean 'waste, excrement', but he also read magahiiä from maga- 'ditch, pit', and thus obtained the following meaning: 'When will they get rid of the 13 H.

THE INDO-IRANIAN MYTH All these interpretations have to a certain extent been predicated on the assumption that the poems express the reformed teaching of the Old Iranian prophet Zarathustra, who, according to some scholars, abolished the use of the haoma in the ritual.17 The alternate approach I shall adopt here is based on the well-established and universally recognized fact that the Old Avesta also continues Indo-Iranian poetic traditions. If we approach the text from this angle, then we can apply to it the time-honored methods of philology and comparative Indo-European mythology and, I believe, arrive at a relatively satisfactory interpretation of the line and the strophe. I say relatively, because, on one hand, I have found no exact or close parallels either elsewhere in the Avesta or in old Indo-Iranian literature. On the other hand, in the Old Avesta as in the Rigveda, myths are never spelled out: we only have fleeting references to them, which would be understood by the poet's colleagues, and, of course, by the gods, but leave modern readers perplexed. Let us therefore go directly to the mythological implications of the three principal words in the line: ajdn, müOrdm, and madahiiä. In my analysis of these three terms, I follow the principle that we should pro-ceed to emend a manuscript reading or propose alternate interpretations of apparently common words only after having shown by all means available to us that they are quite unlikely to be what they seem. ajdn Taken at face value, ajdn is the Avestan equivalent of Old Indie ähan, which refers to the removal of the forces of chaos by a divine or human hero with the aim of re-establishing the cosmic order; see the exhaustive discussion in C. Watkins's book. 16 M.

In Zoroastrianism, the importance of urine is well known. Firstly, in the Videvdad, a long Young Avestan text on ritual clean-sing, we are told that one of the places where the earth is most happy is where people and animals urinate the most and where it is cultivated, which shows that there is a link between urine and fertility: Videvdad 3.6 dâtard gaëOanqm astuuaitinqm aSäum kuua pux6dm arjhà zamö êâistam äat mraot ahurö mazdä yat bä paiti fraëstdm maëzdn ti pasuuasca staoräca Ο Orderly establisher of the bony world of living beings!

In chapter 9 of the Videvdad, we have a long description of how washing with cow's urine someone afflicted by the demon of dead matter makes the demon flee from body part to body part and finally out of the body.

Ο Orderly creator... if they do not search for bones and hairs, *excrements, urine, and *traces of blood, what is the penalty for that? From this and other passages, we see that in this case, as in the case of other objects connected with the body, Young Avestan has two terms for urine, one used to refer to items in the good world (the ahurie term), maësman-, and the other to items in the world of evil (the daëuuic term), mü9ra-.2b Although the Young Avestan evidence does not prove the existence of ahurie maësman-, daëuuic müOra- in the GäOäs,27 the com-bined Old Indie and Young Avestan evidence does prove the existence of müOra- 'urine' in Indo-Iranian, hence there is no need a priori to think that müOra- does not have this meaning in our passage. Depending on whether müOrdm is subject or direct object, our sen-tence can thus be paraphrased as follows: 1. Subject: When was the (evil) urine produced by the drinking of haoma capable of smashing (the forces of barrenness and death)? 2. Direct object: When was (...) able to smash the urine produced by the drinking of haoma? 24 The manuscripts: °aiiânti Pt2, °te Mf2, Jpl, L2, Brl, Κ10, LI ; upairi.Saonti K1. 25 Bartholomae, in his Altiranisches Wörterbuch (Strassburg, 1904), rendered spa-man- as 'spit, phlegm'; müQra- as 'feces'; and varjhutât- as 'blood, sanguinitas\\ 26 This was, in fact, already suggested by Ilya Gershevitch: \"An Iranist's View of the Soma Controversy\", Mémorial Jean de Menasce, eds Ph.

Water, which is a creation of Ahura Mazda's, in the form of rain produced by the suc-cessful sacrificer, purifies the world, ridding it of the Evil Spirit's crea-tion. The \"water\" thus produced by the inefficient sacrificers does not, however, have this effect. Water is not otherwise said to \"smash\", but it is said \"not to smash\" Ahura Mazda's creation: Videvdad 5.8 äß nardm jainti vä ... äß nardm nöit jain ti astö.viSötus dim bandaiieiti Does water smash a man? Water does not smash a man. The demon who disconnects the bones binds him ...

THE CONTEXT OF YASNA 48.10 Let us now see how such an interpretation would fit into the context of the strophe as well as the larger context of Yasna 48 of Gä6ä 3 and of GäQä 3 as a whole. Most importantly, we need to discuss the syntax of mûOrdm. There are two questions that need to be answered: What was it that was not smashed and who or what was it that was not up to the task? As for the first question: the object may be expressed in the next line by the instr. angriiä, a derivative of the adjective angra-, which, in the Avesta, is the standing epithet of the evil spirit, the lord of darkness and death. Exactly what kind of evil is expressed by the word angra is, un-fortunately, not clear.28 Also, since the antecedent of the pronoun is 28 It is probably from proto-Iranian *ahra-, Indo-Iranian *asra- and perhaps cognate with Old Indie àsita- 'dark', used of the dark chaos hidden by Dawn (e.g., Rigveda 4.51.9 guhantïr àbhvam àsitam 'hiding the dark informity'). The corresponding noun appears to be qsta- in an unclear passage in Yasna 34.8: Oßahiiä mazdä qstä uruuäta-"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"inside the relative clause, we cannot be sure that it represents the direct object. In principle, the direct object might be a gapped noun, on which angriiä would depend, but it could also be in other cases, giving: 'When did the urine of (t)his intoxication smash the evilness by which ...'.or, for instance, 'When did the urine of (t)his intoxication smash the (...) of the evilness by which ...'. Or, if the direct object is gapped: 'When did the urine of (t)his intoxication smash (...), (this) evilness by which ...'. Similar ambiguities obtain if müOrdm is direct object: 'When did he smash the urine of (t)his intoxication, (this) evilness by which ..'.or, for instance, 'When did he smash the urine of (t)his intoxication with the evilness by which ..'. and so on. As for the second question, who was the inefficient smasher?—again, it could be the evil spirit himself, implied by angriiä. The use of ahiiä to refer to the evil one himself in Yasna 32.14 cited above may support such an interpretation. On the other hand, we may note that, in the later Zoroastrian texts, the opponent assigned to Best Order, the cosmic principle of order op-posing chaos, is, in fact, Indra, who in Iran was demoted together with the devas, as stated in the Bundahisn (Bundahisn 1.33-35: description of the good and evil creations; Bundahisn 5.1: about the opposing forces in the worlds of good and evil): Good forces  Evil forces Ohrmazd   Ahrimen   Wahman (good thought) Akôman (evil thought) Ardwahist (best order) Endar (Avestan Indar, Old Indie Indra) Sahrewar (choice command) Säwul (Avestan Sauruua, Old Indie Sarva) Spandarmad  NänghaiG (Avestan NâqhaiOiia, Old (life-giving humility, Earth) Indie Näsatya) Srö§ (Avestan SraoSa)  Wrath  truth (râstïh)  lies and false statements (drö ud mihöxt) Note also the use of naro 'men, heroes' in the first line of Yasna 48.10. Elsewhere in the Gä9äs, the word nar- 'man, hero' is used, on one hand, to denote the successful sacrificer, the nä spdntö, or 'the life-giving man'; on the other hand, it is used about the great heroes of the past, hiiâ '(you frighten them), Ο All-knowing One, with the qsta of your (side of) the deal (with them)', apparently referring to the dire effects on humans of breaking the univer-sal agreements with god."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"such as Frasaostra, and others.

It is, therefore, at least conceivable that the themes of Indra's drink-ing of the soma/haoma, as well as his inordinate urinating were both adapted by the Iranians, but in a negative sense. On the other hand, in a Young Avestan list of contraries, Best Order is countered by Wrath, which is a significant fact in the larger context of Yasna 48: Yast 19.46 yahmipaiti *pdrdtaë0e29 spantasca mainiius aijrasca aëtahmi paiti *yat30 axvardte aöät *astd31 fraijhardcaiiat *äsistd32 katarascit spdntö mainiius astdm^ fraijhardcaiiat vohuca manô aSdmca vahistdm âtrdmca ahurahe mazdä puOrdm aijrô mainiius astdm fraijhardcaiiat akdmca manô aësmdmca xruuï.drûm azïmca dahäkdm spitiiurdmca yimö. kdrdn tdm ... over which they fight, the life-giving and the Evil Spirit, over this, the unseizable one.

Strophes 10 and 11 contain two sets of rhetorical questions: one implying the inefficiency and failure of rival sacrificers and one implying the success of our sacrificer.

What is important, however, is that, by this evidence, Sraosa is the \"smasher of obstructions\" and, by the evidence of the Young Avesta, he is the smasher of Wrath. Thus, the conclusion is hard to avoid that the inefficient smasher of Yasna 48 is being compared to the efficient smasher Sraosa and that, what he has not been able to smash, is Wrath, the embodiment of darkness and chaos. This also gives us a clue to the meaning of the last statement in Yasna 48.10, which must refer to the inability of the rival poets's xratus, their guiding thoughts, to guide dawn across the sky. Thus, whereas, the sacri-fice of the good poet-sacrificers have enabled Sraosa to smash Wrath and the powers of darkness and their guiding thoughts have brought back dawn, the sacrifice of the rival poet-sacrificers has been unable to do so. Yasna 48.10 is located about half-way through the third GäOä, the Spdntämaniiü gä6ä, the hymn to the life-giving spirit or inspiration, that is about the middle of the GäOä collection. It is therefore recited approximately at the climax of the Gathic ritual. After this, the sacrifice takes its inevitable course toward success, that is, the return of dawn or the new year, as the case may be. Let us therefore, for the sake of curiosity, look at the conclusion of the GäOä collection. In fact, in the fifth and last GäOä, the final effort of the sacrificer is displayed and the effects of the successful sacrifice are summa-rized in terms referring to several of the themes we have been discussing. In Yasna 53.8, the inefficient sacrificers and their gods are mercilessly ridiculed for their lack of virility and cursed back to darkness: GäOä 5, Yasna 53.8 anäis ä duzuuardsnaijhö daßniiä häntü zaxiiäcä vïspâijhô xraosdn tqm upä huxsaOräis jän arqm xrünarqmcä rämqmcä äis dadätü siieitibiiö vTzibiiö Jratü Ts duuaßö huuö dardzä mdrdOiiaos mazistö mosucä astü On account of those (utterances/performances) of theirs let them be there (at the judgment, as men) of bad virility, *dupes, ration needed to perform his protective function, or: let Sraosa, a protector par excel-lence, come, cf. Yasna 57.2. The fact that the person to whom readiness to listen is to come is left undetermined may indicate the former alternative, as otherwise we might expect 'to me, to this one', or similar."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"and ridiculed all (of them)!

Even more interestingly, there is an inverse echo of GäOä 3, Yasna 48.10-11: as a reward for the rivals' ineffective \"smashing\" and their \"bloodshed\", they will now themselves be smashed and bled:39 Yasna 48.10-11 aj5n  dusd.xsaOrâ  he smashed with bad command xsaOrâ husditis  xrüräis râmqm dàntë command good dwellings bloody peace obtain Yasna 53.8 huxsaOräis  jdnarqm  xrünarqmcä  with good command let them be smashed let them be bled rämqmcä dadätü siieitibiiö peace give to the settlements Interestingly, we may have the same imagery in the hymns to Sraosa (Yast 11 and Yasna 57), who smashes Wrath with the bloody club, giv-ing him a bleeding wound: Yast 11.15 sraosdm ... aësmahexruuî.draos hamaëstârdm 'Sraosa ... opponent of Wrath with the bloody club' Yasna 57.10 sraosdm .. yö aësmdm ... vîxrûman tanι xvardm jain ti 'Sraosa ... smashes Wrath (inflicting it) a bleeding wound'40 38 Compare maz- maga- 'great gift exchange' ('exchange of great gifts = rewards, shares') in Yasna 46.14: zaraOustrâ kastê aSauuä uruuaOö | mazöi magäi Ό Zarathustra, what (sup-porter?) do you have for the great gift exchange, a sustainer of Order, one who abides by the universal agreements?' and Pindar's Nemean Ode 8.25: megïston d'aiôlôi pseudei géras antétatai 'the biggest honorific portion is handed over to intricate Deceit' (see G.

Humbach, The Gäthäs of Zarathustra and the Other Old Avestan Texts; see also J. Kellens, Les noms-racines de I'Avesta (Wiesbaden, 1974), pp. 387-88), but the inter-pretation as 3rd plural imperative middle (like Vedic duh-räm) is straightforward. 40 E. Benveniste, W. B.

Gershevitch"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"The parallels between GäOä 3, Yasna 48.10-11 and GäOä 5, Yasna 53.8 also make me wonder if the ineffective \"urine\" of the rivals does not also refer to their sterile semen, implying that they are, indeed, 'of bad viril-ity'. We may recall that the difference between urine and semen was not always well understood in ancient times, and, in the Rigveda, the rain is sometimes referred to as urine, sometimes as semen, for instance: Rigveda 1.100.03 (to Indra) divö nayäsya rétaso dughänäh pànthâso yànti sàvasâparïtâh | tarâddvesâh sâsahih paûmsyebhir marûtvân no bhavatv indra ûtî \\ \\ He whose paths go—impossible to block because of his (life-giving, swell-ing) strength -like (the streams) of the semen of heaven when milked, overcoming the hostilities, overpowering by his male attributes, followed by the Maruts, let Indra be for us with his help! In the later Zoroastrian texts, semen and urine are both listed as kinds of water: Bundahisn 11B.1 pad dën 17 sardag âb gôwëd... panjom susr îgöspandän ud mardömän sasom gômëz 1 göspandän ud mardömän In the dën there are said to be 17 species of water:... the fifth: the semen of animals and men; the sixth: the urine of animals and men. FINAL REMARKS I would like to make two remarks to finish: First: since müOra in the Videvdad is a substance that falls into the general category of dead matter, the Gathic passage may well imply that, not only is the urine of the powers of evil unable to smash anything in Ahura Mazda's creation, but it will itself be smashed by the good waters of his creation. (London, 1970, p. 39) argues that this word means 'bloodless, non bleeding', adducing Videvdad 4.30 and 34, where a vïxrûmant- xvara- is listed as less serious wound than a tacat.vohuni- xvara- 'a wound from which the blood flows', and also that the weapon stuns. The formation of the word and the meaning of its components are unclear, how-ever, and it is hard to believe that SraoSa's blow does not result in bleeding. Recall also \"the Lieful *armies who raise the bloody banner\" in Yasna 57.25 (above). The \"bloodi-ness\" asociated with the powers of darkness may well be the poetic-mythical interpreta-tion of the sunset."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Second: according to the later Zoroastrian texts, Zarathustra himself was the greatest smasher ever of the forces of evil. The etiological myth justifying the ritual cleansing procedures is told in Videvdad chapter 19, where it is Zarathustra himself who is described as \"smashing\" evil, including dead matter. Videvdad 19.5 uzuuaëdaiiat zaraOustrô aijrdm mainiiüm duzda aijra mainiiö jartäni dqma daêuuô. dâtdm janäni nasus daêuuô. dâtdm Zarathustra *threatened the Evil Spirit: Ο Evil Spirit of evil gifts, I shall smash the creation established by the daêuuas, 1 shall smash the corpse established by the daêuuas ... But Zarathustra was also the product of the haoma and heavenly semen as rain. In the Zarathustra myth in the Dênkard, it is described how the rain containing the elements needed for the making of Zarathustra, got into the milk of a cow, which was mixed with the haoma in ritual fash-ion and drunk by his parents: Dênkard 7.2.37-38 ciyôn dën gôwëd êg ka ohrmazd an ïzarduxst dahisn frâz brëhënld büd gôhr ï tan ëg pës-nëmag ï ohrmazd dahisn ïzarduxst abar grâd abar hor-dad ud murdad abar ô abr ëg abr âb frôd burd nôg nôg srisk srisk bowandag ud garmôg pad ëd sâdîh ï *gôspandân wïrân an ï and susr cand 2 gâw ï kistâr-wardisn pad an abar urwar rust hënd harwisp ï az harwisp srâdag abar pad an zamân ka ân ïanî urwar sist ud abar-iz husk ud gôhr Ïzarduxst az an âb ô an urwar mad. As the dën says: Then when Ohrmazd had fashioned forth the creature of Zarathustra, i.e., the substance of his body, then the creature of Zara-thustra fell <from> before Ohrmazd upon Hordad and Mordad (= water and plants), upon a cloud. Then the cloud brought (its) water down, again and again, drop by drop in perfect measure and warm. By this joy for beasts and men, there was as much semen as (that produced by) 2 ploughing oxen. Thereupon all the plants grew up, of all species, at a time when other plants are wilted, and even upon dry (ground). And the substance of Zarathus-tra came from that water to those plants."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Dënkard 7.2.46-47 paydäg kü pas pörusäsp an höm az dugdöw abäz xwäst u-s än kust u-s ö an gäw pëm kë tan göhr ΐ zarduxst awis mad estäd gumëxt ëdar frawahr ï zarduxst u-s tan göhr hagenën ö ham mad ëk-ëw paydâg kü än höm ud pëm ka hagenën gumëxt ud ö ohrmazd ni-wëyïd estäd pörusäsp dugdöw fräz xwärld. ud ëdar hangerdîgîh 1 büd xwarrah frawahr ud tan göhr î zarduxst andar 2 *pid.

One thing that is revealed: When that höm and milk were mixed and it had been \"announced\" to Ohrmazd, (then) PôruSâsp (and) Dugdöw drank it. And here the \"complete assembly\"41 of the Fortune, the pre-soul, and the body substance of Zarathustra, (was) in his parents. It is therefore not impossible that the literary device of scorning the ri-vals seen in our strophe implies the praise of the successful sacrificer par excellence, namely Zarathustra himself.42 In conclusion, then, it would seem that our text refers to the ritual myth of the haoma and the intoxication of the divinity, the victory over the forces of anti-fertility, and the fertilizing of the world by means of the heavenly rain/urine/semen.43 41 The terms niwëyïd 'announced' and hangerdîgîh 'complete assembly' correspond to the Avestan technical terms niuuaëSaiiemi Ί announce' and hankäraiiemi Ί assem-ble', which introduce the litany in Yasna 1 ; this shows that the making of Zarathustra is a ritual process. 42 On praise and blame in the GâQâs, see P.O.

Cette formule présente un certain nombre de difficultés, que j'ai envisagées dans un article qui peut encore être considéré comme récent.1 1. La structure syntaxique tout d'abord. La proposition principale est clai-rement â tëaqhe fraca stuiiënïtë vaëôaiiemi. Elle s'ordonne avec deux subordonnées conditionnelles en yezi disposées en ciseaux. L'une, yezi 9ßä diduuaësa, est antéposée et prolongée par une répétition coordonnante de yezi avec une série d'instrumentaux de moyen, l'autre, yezi të a^he auuâ.ururaoôa yat yasnaheca vahmaheca, est postposée et clôture la phrase. Comme la forme surcomposée â + fra + stu n'est pas plausible et que l'on attend par ailleurs le schéma corrélatif * yezi... âat... yezi, il est probable que â initial de phrase soit une réalisation graphique de âat suivi d'un mot à dentale initiale (*äd te > â të). Cette graphie a dû contaminer la variante plurielle et provoquer la substitution de â vô à *âat νδ. 2. La subordonnée de protase présente une difficulté sémantique mi-neure : la signification de zaosa... azaosa. Le sens littéral de zaosa- est « approbation »2.

Le problème majeur est celui de la syntaxe régie par s tu avec le pré-verbe fra. Les traductions de Darmesteter et de Bartholomae, fondées sur la traduction pehlevie, sont identiques. Le premier donne « pour cela, je te loue [de nouveau] » 3 et le second « (so) preise ich und lobe ich dich dafür » 4 Cette interprétation combine une irrégularité et une bizarrerie que Bartholomae admet explicitement. L'irrégularité : tê, datif-génitif enclitique du prénom de la 2eme personne, a fonction d'accusa- tif.5 La bizarrerie : αήΐι e serait une reprise de phrase, celle de la proposition en yezi. Cette fonction est très rare et, lorsqu'elle se présente, c'est sous une forme syntaxique beaucoup plus cohérente, comme dans le presque pa-rallèle de Y68.1 αήΗβ auuaiiqm dqnmahiyat 9ßä diduuïsma « nous te donnons réparation de ceci, à savoir que nous t'avons nui », où il est clair que aqhe fonctionne en corrélation de la subordonnée explicative en yat. Ces anomalies paraissent d'autant plus suspectes que la grammaire du passage est remarquablement conservatrice : corrélation impeccable et complexe (en ciseaux), usage cohérent du parfait, répétition coordon-nante d'un outil syntaxique, usage persistant de l'accusatif singulier en-clitique du pronom de la deuxième personne, °ca inverse dans la coordi-nation des verbes principaux. La liste est impressionnante et pourrait faire argument en faveur d'un état de langue que Tremblay nous propose d'appeler « moyen avestique ». Le verbe fra + s tu n'est pas fréquent. Il est encore attesté dans deux fragments, Hl .7 et N48, et, surtout, dans l'ensemble de quatre formules qui constituent le début extrême du Yasna (YO. 1 -6) et qui sont répétées en clôture du Hôm Stôm, à la fin de Y11 : 3 J.

Ici, les termes de la triade sont bel et bien à l'accusatif pluriel, étant donné que niz + bar est régulièrement transitif. Cette surprenante divergence entre le texte et sa paraphrase a conduit Bartholomae, dans le Wörterbuch cité ci-dessus, à poser une alternative entre le datif et l'accusatif dans la rection d'un verbe signifiant « sich angeloben an... sich feierlich verpfliehten an ». La paraphrase de H 1.7 fait une autre suggestion. Les termes constitutifs de la triade sont à l'instrumental pluriel et frastuiië a. yasna- et vahma- pour objets sous-entendus, comme ils le sont explicitement de frä... staomaide dans N48 frä tëstaomaide... yasnqsca vahmqsca. Donc : « je fais l'éloge prélimi-naire (du sacrifice et du chant) au moyen de (pensées) qui ont été bien pensées... au moyen de (pensées) qui seront (bien) pensées... ».

Depuis le début de notre philologie, il est admis que niuuaëôaiiemi avec génitif, e.g. ahu-rahe mazdä, dans les litanies de Yasna 1, sous-entend le nom du sacri-fice (« je fais Γ annonce-préliminaire (du sacrifice) à Ahura Mazda »).

Nous obtenons ainsi la traduction suivante : « si je t'ai nui par une pen-sée, un mot, un geste, consciemment ou inconsciemment, si je t'ai frustré d'une (pensée, d'un mot ou d'un geste) du sacrifice et du chant, (à nou-veau) je fais pour toi Γ éloge-préliminaire et l'annonce préliminaire de cette (pensée, de ce mot, de ce geste) ». Y 1.21 n'exprime pas une idée d'ordre général, mais se réfère de ma-nière précise au texte dont la récitation est en train de s'achever. Le chantre s'inquiète des omissions qui pourraient avoir affecté sa perfor-mance et il entend les réparer en recommençant la récitation de YO (fra-ca stuiië) et de Y1 (nï... vaëôaiiemi). Et Y 1.23, effectivement, reproduit YO. 1. Il s'agit d'une précaution visant à conjurer les éventuels manque-ments à la perfection rituelle. La formule de Y 1.21-22 n'est pas la seule déprécation des fautes rituelles que l'on trouve dans l'Avesta.

Cette phrase n'a pas souvent été commentée et la question si longtemps controversée des infinitifs a contribué à ce qu'on la tienne dans l'obscurité.

On ne peut donc traduire simplement « j'établis, je considère que les bonnes pensées, etc. sont à accepter, les mauvaises pensées etc. à rejeter ». Le moyen de dâ construit en double accusatif peut avoir deux valeurs : 1. Il est réfléchi indirect, ce qui implique que le lien établi avec le sujet porte sur le deuxième accusatif.8 Cela donne : « je considère que je dois accepter les bonnes pensées, que je dois rejeter les mauvaises pensées ». Dans ce cas, le chantre du début du Yasna se fixe à lui-même une règle de conduite. Cela paraît naturel et correspond aux diverses traductions que l'on a données de cette phrase, quelle que soit par ailleurs l'analyse morphologique que l'on ait faite de aibigairiiä et de paitiriciiâ. Je doute cependant que la réflexivité du moyen puisse porter sur le deuxième ac-cusatif. 2. Il est réfléchi direct, ce qui implique que le premier accusatif est une composante du sujet.9 Un argument fort plaide pour cette interprétation : la valeur réfléchie directe est nécessairement celle de nizbardmnö, qui correspond à paitiriciiâ daiSê, dans la glose de H 1.7. Le sens est alors : «j'établis que mes bonnes pensées doivent être acceptées, que mes mauvaises pensées doivent être négligées ». Il s'agit d'une autre dépréca-tion des imperfections rituelles.

Il faut admettre que la pensée, la parole et l'acte dont parlent Y0.4 et Y 1.21-22 ne traduisent pas le comportement humain en général, celui qu'un homme peut avoir dans n'importe quel domaine de sa vie. Ils sont les éléments constitutifs du yasna et du vahma, le sacrifice et le chant, c'est-à-dire les trois niveaux d'existence et de présence par lesquels l'homme se manifeste dans le rituel.

Si l'analyse qui vient d'être faite est correcte, le caractère strictement rituel de la triade vaut pour l'ensemble de l'Avesta récent. Et puis, est-il si sûr qu'il en va autrement dans les Gâthâs ? Schlerath n'en doute pas : « Mit dieser Formel wird die moralische Existenz des Menschen im umfassenden Sinn angesprochen. Das ist unbezweifelt ». On a vu argumentation plus serrée. En réalité, la nature éthique de la triade est affirmée en tant que principe, puis illustrée par des citations traduites en fonction de ce prin-cipe. La démonstration est à la fois imparable et sans valeur. Le fait est que nous ne comprenons pas bien les Gâthâs et les passages où intervient la triade pas mieux que les autres.

LXXXI. INTRODUCTION Ritual has always played a significant part in religious practice. This is particularly true of the Zoroastrian tradition, in which it proved to be crucial for the survival of the faith. For it was because of ritual that the ancient sacred scriptures of the Zoroastrians—the Avesta, composed in Old Iranian, and its Middle Persian translations and commentaries, the so-called Zand—have survived the vicissitudes of the history of Iran. The scriptures of the extant Avesta fall into two groups, both defined by their ritual application. The first comprise texts recited in priestly rituals. These are the Yasna (abbreviated: Y) 'worship', Visperad (Vr) 'all masters' and Videvdad (Vd) 'law of those who reject the demons'. The second group consists of devotional hymns called the Yasts and prayers which can be recited by any member of the community. They constitute the extant 'Small' or Khorde Avesta. All these texts have sur-vived as a result of the religious requirement to recite them in the origi-nal, Avestan, language at certain times of the day. Those texts which had no ritual function were generally lost or, at best, have been transmitted very badly. The Yasna ceremony is undoubtedly the most important of all Zoro-astrian rituals. It is celebrated daily, at the request of a member of the community, and starts at sunrise in the morning watch of the Häwan Gäh. Nowadays it is performed by two cultic officials, a chief priest (zöt) and an assistant priest (râspï) in the inner parts of the fire temple. They carry out the ceremony on behalf of the member of the community who has requested and paid for it. Laypersons may be present during the ritual, but do not have to be."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"Not only the ritual, but also the Avestan text recited during it bears the name yasna-, which constitutes the highest liturgy of Zoroastrian rit-ual. It consists of 72 chapters, each denoted in the Avestan language by häiti. This noun is a ί/'-abstract derived from the root hä (= Vedic sä) 'to bind' and literally means 'binding'. Presumably it lexicalizes the idea that a häiti is a self-contained literary 'bundle' or composition. In reli-gious practice, the 72 häiti- of the Yasna are represented symbolically by the 72 strands from which the sacred girdle of the Zoroastrians, the kusti, is woven. The Yasna has always been held in particularly high esteem by Zoroastrians because it includes at its centre all of the surviving Old Avestan texts. Of the latter, the hymns called the Gathas are traditionally attributed to the prophet and founder of the religion, Zarathushtra. The Gathas again also contain an important text at their centre, the Yasna Haptarçhâiti (abbreviated: YH), the \"Worship in Seven Chapters\". As the name indicates, this text consists of seven häiti. Thus, at the centre of the 72-chapter Yasna, there is another, shorter, 7-chapter Yasna. However, while the name of this shorter Yasna is found throughout the Avesta, that of the 72-chapter text is probably not. ' It appears that neither the Avesta itself nor its manuscripts refer to this text as yasna. This is confirmed by the fluid state of Middle Persian terminology, whereyast,yazisn oryasn denote the Avestan high liturgy. Similarly, as Antonio Panaino has shown, the Yasts are frequently re-ferred to as yasn.2 Jean Kellens concluded that the use of yasna as the name of the 72-chapter text was a product of early nineteenth century scholarship, having been reinstated by Burnouf.3 1 The earliest attestation of this use ofyasna is probably found in MascudT, who died in 956 C.E., if what he calls isnäd in Arabic is a corrupted rendering of ysn = yasna, see Maçoudi, Les Prairies d'or.

I shall discuss the position the Yasna Haptaijhäiti takes, first, within the 72-chapter Yasna and, second, in the two other Zoroastrian high liturgies, which are based on the Yasna, namely the Visperad and Vendidad ceremonies. We shall see that the YH is posi-tioned at the centre of each of the three Zoroastrian high liturgies, and I shall argue that such a position indicates that the YH is the focal text of Zoroastrian high ritual. This view will derive further support from an examination of the usage of the word yasna- in the Avesta, as a result of which it will emerge that, throughout the time Avestan texts were com-posed, the Yasna Haptaqhäiti was perceived as the Worship, ox yasna-, par excellence and provided the model for the Younger Avestan eulogis-tic invocations characterized by the verb yazamaide 'we worship'. THE YASNA HAPTA^HÄITI AND THE STRUCTURE OF THE YASNA It has already been stated above that the text recited during the Yasna ritual is divided into 72 chapters or häiti. This number, however, is achieved artificially by means of repetition of certain individual chapters. For example, Y 5 consists of the wholesale repetition of Y 37, which is the third chapter of the YH, and the entire Gathic hymn Y 47 is repeated twice, in Y 18 and in Y 68. There are numerous other instances in the Younger Avestan parts of the Yasna, where verses from the Older Avesta are included. Yet the division of the Yasna into häiti- seems to be old. The Yasna falls into three larger units, two Younger Avestan sections enclosing an Old Avestan middle. The central part of the Old Avestan texts, the Gathas, is flanked on either side by sacred prayers and has the Yasna Haptaqhäiti at its heart. The Yasna thus exhibits a concentric compositional structure.4 The outer circles consist of liturgical praises to Ahura Mazdä and all his good spiritual and physical creations. The first half of the Yasna, Y 1-27, is characterized by three sections of invoca-tions, comprising Y 1-8, 14-18 and 22-26. They address, in order, Ahura Mazdä, the Amasa Spantas, the various divisions of time, called 4 See A. Hintze, \"On the literary structure of the Older Avesta\", Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 65, 2002, pp. 31-51."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"ratu-, and other entities. These sections alternate with texts and praises devoted to special subjects, such as the praise of Haoma (Y 9-11), the Mazdayasnian Creed (Y 12) and the commentaries to the three holy prayers (Y 19-21 ). The part following the Old Avestan kernel, Y 55-72, contains few of such invocations and mainly texts with a certain theme. These include the hymn to Sraosa (Y 56-57), the manthra of the cattle breeder (Y 58), the Benediction of the house of the Mazdayasnians (Y 60), the praise of fire (Y 62) and the Ritual of the Waters (Y 63-70). The exact centre of the 72 chapters of the entire Yasna consists of Y 36 and 37, the second and third chapters of the YH. Y 36 is about Ahura Mazda's heavenly fire, which is invoked and invited to come down and merge with the ritual fire. During the ritual, this process must take place between stanzas 2 and 3, because in stanza 3 the ritual fire is identified with both Ahura Mazda's heavenly fire and with his most bounteous spirit:5 (1) Y 36.3 ätar s vôi mazdä ahurahiiâ ahî mainiius vôi ahiiä spdnistô ahî hiiat vä töi nämanqm väzistdm ätard mazdâ ahurahiiâ tä 9ßä pairijasâmaidê 'You are indeed the Fire of the Wise Lord. You are indeed his most bounteous spirit. We approach you, Ο Fire of the Wise Lord, With what is the most powerful of your names.' At the end of this chapter, in stanza 6, the ritual fire is addressed as Ahura Mazda's most beautiful shape: (2) Y 36.6 sraëstqm at töi kdhrpâm kdhrpqm âuuaëdaiiamahï mazdä ahurä imä raocä bardzistdm bardzimanqm auuat yät +huuard auuäcT 5 All English versions of the passages from the YH quoted in this article are adap-tations of the German translation by J. Narten, Der Yasna Haptayhaiti (Wiesbaden, 1986), pp. 38-48. The interpretation of Y 36 presented here is based on Narten, ibid., p. 26, cf.

It must therefore be assumed that from that moment of the ritual on-wards, the worshippers believe themselves to be in the presence of Ahura Mazdä, who has become visible to them in the form of the ritual fire before which they stand. The worship enters its central part in chapters 37-39. The latter are characterized by the frequent use of the verbal form 'we worship', in Avestan yazamaide, which occurs seventeen times altogether in this short text. Indeed, in Old Avestan, this particular form is confined to these three chapters, which contain the worship formulae proper.6 First Ahura Mazdä is praised and identified as the creator of the cow and truth, of the waters and plants, of the lights and the earth and of all that is good: (3) Y 37.1 iSä ät yazamaide ahurdm mazdqm yâ gqmcä aSamcä dät apascä dät uruuaräscä varfhïs raocäscä dät bümlmcä vispäcä vohü Y 37.2 ahiiä xsa 3räcä mazänäcä hauuapatjhäiscä tdm at yasnanqm pauruuatätä yazamaide yöi gdus hacä êiieintï 'Thus we now worship the Wise Lord, who has created the cow and truth. He has created the waters and the good plants. He has created light and the earth and all that is good Y 37.2 by his rule and greatness and creativity. We worship him with the primeness of worship, (we) who dwell on the side of the cow.' 6 See Narten, Der Yasna Haptaijhâiti, pp. 167 f."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"This stanza takes up the theme of the Gathic hymn Y 44.3-5 and is also linked to Y 33.14 by the expression yasnanqm pauruuatätä 'with the primeness of worship'. In the following verse, Ahura Mazdä is wor-shipped in his Ahurian names and for guiding the choices (frauuaSi-) of the truthful men and women (Y 37.3). His Ahurian names are listed in-dividually in the two stanzas concluding this chapter. They are: 'Best truth' (Y 37.4), 'Good Mind' (Vohu Manah), 'Good Rule' (vohu xsaSra-), 'Good Vision' (varfhl- daënâ-), 'Good Joy' (varj'hï- fsdratü-),1 and 'Good Right-mindedness' (vaifhi- ârmaiti-, Y 37.5). The worship con-tinues in chapter 38 with praise of the earth and of the ladies (gdnâ-) who belong to Ahura Mazdä (Y 38.1). These are identified as powers such as fat-offering (ïzâ-), purification (yaosti-), perfection (fdrasti-), and right-mindedness {ârmaiti-) active during the ritual. Moreover, good re-ward [asi-), invigoration (is-), libation (äzüiti-), praise (frasasti-) and blessing (pardndi-) are worshipped. In the central chapter of the YH, Y 38, the worship culminates in the praise of the waters (Y 38.3-5). The third and last chapter of the yazamaide-section, Y 39, praises the soul of the cow, the maker of the cow, furthermore the worshippers' own souls as well as those of domestic and non-obnoxious wild animals (Y 39.2), and of the truthful ones (Y 39.2) and, finally, the male and female Amasa Spantas. In the last stanza, all power is conferred on Ahura Mazdä (Y 39.4). For a long time, the religious and literary importance of the Yasna Haptaqhäiti has been underestimated precisely because of this yaza-maide-section. It was felt that the YH was similar to the lengthy and re-petitive yazamaidë-formulae characteristic of some parts of the Younger Avesta. However, following the study of Johanna Narten (1986), it is now recognized that the YH belongs, together with the Gathas and holy prayers, to the same homogeneous body of Old Avestan literature. This re-evaluation of the YH also changes the way the Younger Avestan texts may be viewed. For it is not the case that the YH is similar to the YAv invocation formulae. Rather, the reverse is true, since the latter result from an attempt to compose more texts which are similar to the central portion of the YH. The most obvious indication of this is the consistent 7 On fsdratü- see Narten, Der Yasna Haptaijhâiti, pp. 186-188. The meaning 'joy' is based on the etymological connection with Ved. psàras- 'enjoyment, delight', see H.

The superlative expression mazistaheca vahistaheca sraëstaheca charac-terizes Ahura Mazdä at the beginning of the Yasna (Y 1.1) and recalls the first yazamaide-section of Y 37.1-2, where Ahura Mazdä is said to have created all that is good 'by his greatness' (mazdnä Y 37.2). The latter is echoed in the YAv. formula masanaca vaijhanaca sraiianaca 'through greatness, goodness and beauty', which also occurs in the geni-tive masänascä vaijhänascä sraiianascä in the pseudo-OAv. Y 58.4.9 Furthermore, as suggested by Jean Kellens10, Ahura Mazda's attribute hukdrdptdma- 'most shapely' in Y 1.1 could be interpreted on the basis of Y 36.6, where the ritual fire is addressed as his most beautiful body. The worship of Ahura Mazdä is followed, in Y 1.2, by that of the Amasa Spantas, who are listed individually: (5) Y 1.2 niuuaëôaiiemi hankâraiiemi vatjhauue manaijhe aSäi vahistäi xsa Srâi vairiiäi spdntaiiäi ärmatäe 8 On this form, see Narten, Der Yasna Haptarjhäiti, pp. 167 f. 9 See Narten, Der Yasna Haptarjhäiti, p. 173 n. 18 (text passages).

This list largely agrees with that of the YH, Y 37.3-4 and Y 39.1, al-though not all the entities praised in the YH are mentioned in Y 1.2. This may be because in the YH the AmaSa Spantas are not a fixed group of seven, as they usually are in the Younger Avesta. Interestingly, however, Y 1.2 also praises the Maker of the Cow and the Soul of the Cow, just like Y 39.1. Moreover, the Fire (ätar-) is explicitly called an Amasa Spanta. Theologically, Y 1.2 therefore agrees more with the ideas of the YH than with those of the standard YAv. system. A further allusion to the YH could be the fire's epithet yaëtustdma- 'who has taken his posi-tion most' because it could refer to Y 36.'1 This initial invocation is followed in Y 1 by those of the various divi-sions of time: of the day (Y 1.3-7), of the month (Y 1.8), of the year (Y 1.9) and of all the time divisions (vïspe ratauuö Y 1.10).

While the uncrowned figure has been commonly believed to be Ahura Mazdä, Gobi draws attention to a coin of Varhrän V. where the bust wears the crown of the corres-ponding king (plate 9.157). He interprets the image not as that of Ahura Mazdä but of the king himself emerging from his own regnal fire. In that case, the king would be represented as Ahura Mazda's imperial representative on earth emerging from the fire."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"Fire (atar-), of both Ahura Mazda's son and all fires, and of the waters and plants: (6) Y 1.12 niuuaëSaiiemi hankäraiiemi tauua ä&rö ahurahe mazdä pu9ra mat vïspaêibiiô âtdrdbiiô niuuaëSaiiemi hankäraiiemi aißiiö vaijvhibiiô vîspanqmca apqm mazdaSätanqm vîspanqmca uruuaranqm mazdaSätanqm Ί invite, I perform (the worship) of you, the Fire, Ο son of Ahura Mazdä together with all fires.

Y 1.12 recalls Y 37.1, where Ahura Mazdä is praised as the creator of the waters and good plants. These observations suggest that the first häiti- of the Yasna is inspired by the praises of the YH. The same ap-plies to the other chapters of praise, i.e. Υ 2-Ά and 6-8 as well as Y 14-18 and 22-26 (which contain repetitions from Y 3 and 4), because their structure is parallel to that of Y 1. The Yasna Haptaqhäiti, being the worship· text par excellence, offered the model for many of the ya-zamaide-formulae in the YAv. parts of the Yasna. The link between the initial chapters of the Yasna and the YH is rein-forced by the repetition of Y 37, which is the same as Y 5 and divides the eight initial häiti of the Yasna into half. Y 5 is followed, in Y 6, by yazamaide-formulae praising a series of divinities identical to those of Y 2, Y 17 and 59, while Y 7 is identical to Y 3, differing only in the verb. Y 7 concludes in sections 24-25 with verses again taken from the YH (Y 41.5-6). Each of the chapters of the YH finishes with the yeqhë hätqm-prayer. The YH shares this feature both with the yazamaide-portions of the YAv. part of the Yasna and with the Yasts, where it concludes each Karde.12 This feature of Avestan eulogistic literature may be explained 12 On the yeqhe hätqm-pTuyer, see C.G.

Such worship is the theme of both the Yasna Haptaqhäiti and the Younger Avestan eulogistic parts of the Yasna, as well as of the Yasts.13 THE POSITION OF THE YH IN THE VISPERAD AND VENDIDAD CEREMONIES The text of the Yasna is organized in such a way that it includes at its cen-tre all of the surviving Old Avestan texts, which probably constituted the oldest liturgical kernel of Zoroastrian ritual. In post-Old Avestan times, this central core was further expanded not only by the addition of more texts of different origin placed both before and after the original Older Avestan kernel, but also by the insertion of YAv. sections into the Old Avestan core. These insertions invariably occur at key points. Most inter-estingly, two of these, Y 35.1 and Y 42, are found in the direct vicinity of the YH, one before and one after it. The third insertion is Y 52 after the fourth Gatha, thus separating it from the fifth Gatha constituting Y 53. Moreover, the Yasna was enlarged by more chapters and thus became the Visperad ceremony. The latter was in turn further extended to consti-tute the longest of all Zoroastrian rituals, the Vendidad ceremony. The content of the Vr sections, or Kardes, is dependent on the chapters of the Yasna before or after which they are recited. For instance, Vr 16, which is recited after the YH, praises that text. In contrast, the content of the twenty-two chapters (fargard) of the Videvdad does not relate either to the Yasna or the Visperad passages into which they are inserted. Obvi-ously their consistently pairwise arrangement is a purely mechanical one. However, it is noteworthy that the pairs of Videvdad chapters are only inserted in and around the Older Avesta.14 detailed analysis of this prayer and its YAv commentary in Y 21 is given by J. Narten, Die AmaSa Spantas im Avesta (Wiesbaden, 1982), pp. 80-97. 13 As aptly stated by Darmesteter, Le Zend-Avesta, vol. 2, p. 332, a Yast is a yasna-, a 'worship' dedicated to one particular divinity, cf. Panaino, \"Philologia Avestica IV: Av. yastay-lyesti-·, yasta-; phi. yast\", p. 171. 14 See K.F. Geldner, \"Awestalitteratur\", Grundriss der Iranischen Philologie, ed. W. Geiger/E. Kuhn (Stuttgart, 1896-1904), pp. 10-12; Darmesteter, Le Zend-Avesta, vol. 1, P. LXVII."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"The pattern of this arrangement is as follows: A Gatha, for instance the Spantamainyu Gatha, Y 47-50, is both preceded and followed by a Karde of the Visperad, Vr 18 and Vr 19 respectively. Vr 18 is in praise of the preceding Ustavaiti Gatha, while Vr 19 praises the Spantamainyu Gatha, after which it is recited. Thus, the Gathas alternate with the Kardes of the Visperad. In the Vendidad ceremony, the Videvdad chapters 13-14 are recited after the Visperad Karde 19, which praises the preceding Spantamainyu Gatha, and before the Vohuxsaöra Gatha, which comprises Y 51 (see next page, fig. 1). By contrast, this basic pattern changes when it comes to the Yasna Haptaqhäiti. After the last häiti of the Ahunavaiti Gatha, Y 34, Vr 14 is recited in praise of that Gatha. In the Vendidad ceremony, this is fol-lowed by fargard 7-8 of the Videvdad. However, the recitation does not then move directly on to the Yasna, as in the case of the Gathas, but an additional Visperad chapter is inserted - as if serving to mark, in a spe-cial way, the beginning of a new section. Moreover, the Yasna Haptaij-häiti is followed by a chapter in Younger Avestan. This has become part of the extant Yasna as chapter 42, a text which resembles the Visperad portions in praise of preceding Gathas. Y 42 praises the Amasa Sp9ntas, the YH, and Ahura Mazda's physical creations, in particular the waters, mountains and lakes. Y 42 is followed by two (not one) Kardes of the Visperad, Vr 16-17, both of which praise the Yasna Haptaqhäiti. In the Vendidad ceremony, they are followed by two fargards of the Videvdad, Vd 9-10. This arrangement suggests that both the Yasna and the Vis-perad give particular prominence to the YH by their insertion of addi-tional chapters both before and after the latter. The entire Visperad seems to be geared towards the recitation of the Older Avestan texts, which are invoked, in Vr 1.3-8, at the very beginning of the Visperad."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"The Yasna extended by the Visperad and Videvdad Videvdad Ahuna Vairya Aitern Vohu Yeqhë Hät^m Ahunavaiti Gatha I Ahunavaiti Gatha II Yasna HaptaQhäiti Ustavaiti Gatha Sp9ntamainyu 47-50 Gatha VohuxsaSra Gatha Second Yasna Haptaqhäiti ('Vr 21 ) 21 -22 Vahistöisti 52-53 ' Gatha Aryaman Isya 54 Prayer 55-72 19-20 21-22"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"There is, however, more to it than that. Vr 21, recited between Vr 20 and 22, praises 'the second Yasna Haptaghäiti'. While Bartholomae thought that the expression apara-yasna- haptaijhäiti- meant the Younger A v. chap-ter Y 52,15 there are two problems with his interpretation. First, the kardes of the Visperad usually follow, rather than precede, the häiti of the Yasna which they praise. Secondly, although Y 52 contains praises of Ahura Mazdä and his creations, it is a text quite different from the YH, both linguistically and contentwise. It is by no means self-evident why Y 52 should be called a 'second' or 'later' Yasna Haptaqhäiti. Much more likely, therefore, is the interpretation proposed by Darme-steter but rejected by Bartholomae. According to Darmesteter, the above expression referred to the second recitation of the YH at the beginning of Vr 21.16 As indicated by Geldner in his edition of the Avesta, not only is the whole of the YH, Y 35-41, recited a second time at the beginning of Vr 21, but so also is the Younger Avestan appendix consisting of Y 42. It thus makes perfect sense to assume that the expression apara-yasna-haptaijhäiti- refers to the second recitation of the Yasna Haptar)-häiti, one which takes place in the Visperad and Vendidad ceremonies at the commencement of Vr 21. In a personal communication, Dastur Kotwal has pointed out that, in the Visperad and Vendidad ceremonies, the second recitation of the Yasna Haptaqhäiti marked a particularly beautiful phase of the ritual. Since the second YH was recited not by the chief priest, the zöt, but by his assistant, the räspT, the former was allowed to enjoy some rest at this stage. This second recitation of the Yasna Haptaqhäiti sounded particu-larly sweet and beautiful, because the räspT tended to recite it slowly and with additional emphasis, thus setting it apart from the preceding lengthy Vendidad and Visperad portions. The beauty of that moment was further enhanced by the fact that, during the Vendidad ceremony, it was dawn by the time Vr 21 was reached, and people would be beginning to visit the firetemple. The point is that in the Vendidad ceremony, Vr 21 is treated just like the first recitation of the YH in Y 35-42. Vr 21-22 constitute the only instance in which two Videvdad chapters are recited both before and af-ter Visperad sections, whithout an intervening häiti from the Yasna. The 15 Chr.

In this way, the second recitation of the YH is given special prominence. Moreover, in the Visperad ceremony, this repetition of the YH and its praise in Vr 21-22 as the 'second Yasna Haptaghäiti', the apara-yasna- haptaijhäiti-, is followed by Y 52, a Younger Avestan chapter inserted into the Old Avestan material. After the second recitation of the YH, that text is worshipped in Vr 21 : the waters are praised, the plants, the guiding choices (frauuaSi-) of the truthful ones (Vr 21.1) and finally, in verse 4, the apara- yasna- it-self: (7) Vr 21.4 aparam yasnam yazamaide aparahe yasnahe yasnam yazamaide aparahe yasnahe yazamaide häitisca afsmanâca vacasca vacastastîmca 'We worship the Second Worship, we worship the worship of the Second Worship, we worship the chapters, syllables, words and stanzas of the Second Worship.' The larger context of this verse suggests that apara- yasna- is short for apara- yasna- haptaijhäiti-. The treatment of the YH in both the Visperad and Vendidad ceremo-nies points to the elevated status of this particular text. The liturgical ar-rangement of all three texts of the Zoroastrian high ritual centres around the YH. The latter constitutes the focus not only of the Yasna, but also of the Visperad and Vendidad ceremonies. While the Yasna ceremony has a single climax in Y 35-41, the Visperad and Vendidad ceremonies reach, in addition, another one in Vr 21 with the second recitation of the Yasna Haptaijhäiti. No ritual action takes place while the Yasna Haptaqhäiti and succeed-ing Gathas Y 43-54 are recited.17 This is remarkable as ritual action accompanies the recitation of the other parts of the high ritual.

THE YH AND THE RITUAL OF THE WATERS It has been argued in section 1 above that the invocation- and yaza-maide-formulae of the Younger Avestan parts of the Yasna are inspired by the Yasna Haptaqhäiti. A further instance, where a Younger Avestan ritual could have been influenced by the Yasna Haptaqhäiti is the Ritual of the Waters, the üb zöhr, which constitutes a part of the Yasna liturgy (Y 62.11-Y 70).18 This ritual opens in Y 62.11 with the formula: (8) Y 62.11 aißi.gdrdSmahi apqm vaijvhïnqm frâitîmca paititîmca aibijardtîmca Of the good waters, we welcome the coming forwards and going back, and the welcoming.' It concludes in Y 70.6 with a variation of the same formula: (9) Y 70.6 apqm vaxfhînqm yazamaide frâithmca paititîmca aibijardthmca 'Of the good waters, we worship the coming forwards and going back, and the welcoming.' The two formulae differ only by virtue of the verb, because aißi. gdrd8mahi 'we welcome' in Y 62.11 is replaced by yazamaide 'we worship' in Y 70.6. Y 62.11 and Y 70.6 respectively introduce and conclude the Ritual of the Waters. Their position at the beginning and end indicates that the almost identical formula of the two stanzas probably refers to that ritual. While there is no Old Avestan attestation of the first two words fräiti-and paititi-, the sound shape of the third term of this formula, aibijardti-'welcoming', suggests that it is, like yazamaide, an Old Avestan loan 18 According to Kotwal/Boyd, A Persian Offering, pp. 119 f. n. 138, the âb zöhr begins with Y 62.11 and ends at Y 70.8. It must be noted, however, that Y 70.7, the final stanza of Y 70, is a repetition of Y 57.4, and Geldner, A vesta, vol. 1, p. 232 does not have Y 70.8. The rite of the äb zöhr is discussed by M. Boyce, \"Ätas-zöhr and Äb zöhr\", Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society 1966, pp. 110 ff."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"word, displaying the preverb with intervocalic -b- instead of the Younger Avestan bilabial spirant -β-, The verbal abstract aibijardti-, which as in other YAv. passages occurs only in its OAv. form, belongs to a group of derivatives from the compound aibi-jar 'to greet, to welcome'. Semanti-cally these words refer to the greetings and welcome accorded the divine beings when they accept the invitation and come to the place of ritual worship. The persistent retention of the Old Avestan form in the Younger Avestan passages indicates that this group of words continued to be perceived as being firmly established in the Old Avestan texts and borrowed from there for use in the Younger Avestan eulogies. The only Old Avestan passage where a form of aibi-jar occurs, is in the Yasna Haptaqhäiti. In its first stanza, Y 35.2, the worshippers declare: (10) Y 35.2 humatanqm hüxtanqm huuarstanqm iiadacä aniiadacä vdrdziiamnanqmcâ väuudrdzananqmcä mahl aibïjardtârô naënaëstârô +ya3dnä vohunqm mahî 'We are welcomers of good thoughts, good words, good deeds, which are done and have been done here and elsewhere.

The initial expression in this introductory stanza of the YH, 'we are wel-comers', may have provided the model for the opening (Y 62.11) and concluding (Y 70.6) formulae of the Ritual of the Waters. While in Y 62.11 and Y 70.6 the actions of'coming forwards, going back and welcoming\\frâitîmca paititïmca aibijardtïmca, are character-ized as being those 'of the good waters', the expression occurs without a genitive in Y 71.6: (11) Y 71.6 vïspaëca pane a gä9ä aSaonïs yazamaidë vïspdmca yasndm frâitïmca paititïmca aibijardtïmca yazamaidë 'And we worship all five truthful Gathas; and we worship the entire Worship and the coming forwards and going back, and the welcoming.'"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"It is reasonable to assume that the expression 'coming forwards and going back, and the welcoming' refers here, as it does in Y 62.11 and 70.6, to the 'good waters'.

The latter could be the Ritual of the Waters, the âb zôhr, which, in the arrangement of the extant Yasna, consists of Y 62.11-Y 70. Bartholomae assumed that the first two terms of the expression frâitïmcapaititïmca aibijardtïmca meant 'coming forwards' and 'going back', and referred to ritual action involving water.19 Narten, in contrast, and on the basis of Vedic evidence, reversed their meanings, so that frâiti- became 'going away' andpaititi- 'coming forwards' ('Weggehen und Herangehen').20 Some clarification as to the more precise meaning of the expression fräiti- and paititi- of the 'good waters' could come from the Nerangestan, where the fourth and last attestation of the word fräiti- 'coming forwards' is found: (12) Ν 48 kahmät haca apqm + varfhïnqm +fräitis frajasaiti haca hü +vaxsät +ä +hü *fräsmö.dätöit * pairi.sacaite tat hama tat +aißi.gäme yö äpe zao 9rqm frabaraiti pasca hü +fräsmö.däitim para hü vaxsät nöit varjhö ahmät + £iiaoSndm vdrdziieiti ya da yat him azöis +visäpahe +gastram +paitiiäpta karsöit 'Whence does the \"Coming Forwards\" of the good waters proceed? -It evolves from sunrise to sunset.

This passage forms part of the description of the five watches given in Ν 46-51. Ν 48 comprises an additional section appended to Ν 47, which characterizes the morning watch, called häuuani-. In his edition of the Nerangestan, Waag seems to have considered the passage Ν 48 as being 19 Bartholomae, AItiranisches Wörterbuch, cols. 1010 and 829. 20 Narten, Der Yasna Haptaijhäiti, p. 90 with n. 15. 21 On +gastrdm instead of transmitted vastrdm, see A.

However, the position of Ν 48 adjacent to the chapter discussing the morning watch (häuuani-), during which the Yasna ceremony is celebrated, makes sense if the 'coming forwards of the good waters' is interpreted as referring to a ritual action, perhaps one that may both form part of the Yasna ritual but could also be performed on its own. Such an action must be that of the 'Ritual of the Waters', the äb zöhr, which, as stated by Kotwal and Boyd, should only be recited during daylight.22 In contrast to another passage praising the 'streaming forwards of the waters' (apqm fdra-xsaostra-) in (13) Y 42.6 apqmcä fdraxsaostrdm yazamaide vaiiqmcä fdrafrao 3rd m yazamaide 'We worship the streaming forwards of the waters, we worship the flying forwards of the birds', which seems to describe purely natural phenomena, apqm fräiti-, the 'com-ing forwards of the waters' in Y 62.11, 70.6, 71.6 and Ν 48 is probably a technical expression of Zoroastrian ritual. All contexts in which fräiti-'coming forwards' and paititi- 'going back' occur have a ritual connota-tion. In particular, the pair seems to characterize a certain process taking place during the ceremony, because the flowing forwards and back of the waters is precisely what happens during the äb zöhr ritual. This is enacted in such a way that the chief priest (the zöt) pours a ritually prepared and consecrated libation, the zöhr, from a cup in his left hand into a cup in his right hand, then from the cup in his right hand back into that in his left and so on. Thus, the mixture is repeatedly poured backwards and forwards.23 Accordingly, the collocation frâitîmca paititîmca may be the Avestan ex-pression describing these movements of the waters taking place during the äb zöhr ritual. If that is the case, it would constitute an instance of agree-ment between the content of the text recited during the Yasna ceremony and its accompanying ritual action. Such agreement would suggest that the Avestan text of the äb zöhr contains sections composed with a view to the ritual action. If this is so, the Ritual of the Waters, the äb zöhr, goes back at least to the Younger Avestan period. 22 Kotwal/Boyd, A Persian Offering, p. 121 n. 140, point out that this injunction is also observed in the Vendidad ceremony, which begins at midnight, because the daylight watch of the Häwan Gäh has begun by the time the ritual reaches Yasna 65. 23 Kotwal/Boyd, A Persian Offering, p. 121, cf. p. 124."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"The Younger Avestan passages referring to the Ritual of the Waters bear traces of dependence on an Old Avestan model. This is indicated by the noun aibijarditi- 'welcome', which is a loanword from the Older Avesta. It forms part of the formula 'the coming forwards and going back, and the welcoming of the good waters', introducing and conclud-ing the äb zöhr in Y 62.11 and Y 70.6. The connection of aibi-jar with the Yasna Haptaqhäiti also emerges from attestations of the verb aißi/ auui-jar 'to welcome', which exhibit the Younger Avestan form of the preverb instead of OAv. aibi. This verb occurs in verses introducing a new section not only in Y 62.11 aißi.gdrdömahi 'we welcome', but also in the other two of its three attestations. The second occurrence of the verb aißi/auui-jar refers explicitly to the YH: (14) Vr 17.1 aißi.gdrdömahi yasnahe haptarjhâtôis humataca hüxtaca huuarstaca aißi.gdrdömahi aSdm vohü 'We welcome the good thoughts, good words, good deeds of the Worship in Seven Chapters. We welcome good truth.' This passage is from the Visperad-Karde recited after the YH and prais-ing that text. The words humataca hüxtaca huuarstaca are probably a quotation from the opening words of the YH in Y 35.2 (no. 10), where a form of aibi-jar also occurs. The third attestation of this verb is found in Vr 21 in its first two verses, which are recited after the 'second Yasna Haptaqhäiti' and similarly praise that text: (15) Vr21.1 auui apqmca vatjvhTnqm uruuaranqmca xvaßrTranqm aSaonqmca frauuaSinqm yasndm gdrdSmahi vahmdmca auui äijhqmcit yä vatfhïs yä äpöyäsca uruuarä yäsca aSaonqm frauuaSaiiö yasndm gdrdSmahi vahmdmca 'We welcome the worship and praise of the good waters, of the fruit-bearing plants,"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"of the guiding choices of the truthful ones.

We welcome the worship and praise of the Bounteous Immortals.' Moreover, another trace of the language of the YH in Vr 21.1-2 is the expression yasndm ... vahmdmca, a collocation which is first attested in the YH (Y 35.7). Thus, although the verb aißi/auui jar appears in its Younger Avestan form, it always occurs in contexts which are dependent on the YH. Indeed, all attestations of this family of words recall the the YH in one way or the other. The link between the Ritual of the Waters and the YH consists in the fact that the worship of the Waters constitutes the central part and focus of both texts. The OAv. form aibi.jarditi- in the formula introducing and concluding the âb zôhr belongs to Old Avestan ritual terminology. The"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"connection between the two texts is further reinforced by the quotation of a line from the YH, αρδ at yazamaide 'we worship the waters' (Y 38.3 a) in Y 63.3, with OAv. at but no lengthening of the final -e, and, moreover, by the repetition of entire sections of the Yasna Haptaqhäiti: the praise of the waters, comprising stanzas 2-5 of Y 38, is twice re-peated in the Ritual of the Waters (Y 67.6-8 and Y 68.20-21). THE WORD YASNA- IN THE AVESTA We have already seen from Vr 21.4 (no.7), that the Yasna Haptaqhäiti could be referred to just by yasna-, without its epithet haptaijhäiti. The question, however, is whether there is any Avestan evidence for the use of yasna- alone as the name of the 72-chapter text. Accordingly, in the following discussion of its usage in the Avesta, passages where it could refer to a text will be of particular interest. The Avestan word yasna-, which means 'worship', corresponds ex-actly to the closely related Vedic yajhà-, which is the ordinary noun for 'sacrifice' or 'worship'. In most of its Avestan attestations the word yasna- refers to the 'worship' of Ahura Mazdä and his creations. Particu-larly frequent is the collocation ( 16) yasnäica vahmâica xsnao Srâica frasastaiiaëca 'for worship, praise, gratification and glory', in invocation formulae of the Younger Avesta.24 The object of the wor-ship is usually either Ahura Mazdä himself or one of his truthful spiritual or physical creations, though occasionally the expression is also used of Daevas, e.g. in (17) Vd 16.11 daëuuanqm yasnäica vahmâica 'for the worship and praise of the Daevas'. Moreover, yasna- refers to a certain text bearing that name. In most in-stances, this text is unequivocally identified by the epithet haptaijhäiti-as 'the Worship in Seven Chapters', e.g. in the formula (18) Y 41.8 (Y 71.12, Vr 16.0 and 2.7) yasnam sürdm haptaijhäitTm aSauuandm aSahe ratüm yazamaide 24 E.g. in Gäh 1.1 and numerous other passages, see Bartholomae, Altiranisches Wörterbuch, col. 557."},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"'we worship the strong Worship in Seven Chapters, the truthful one, the Ratu of Truth'. In addition, however, there are six passages, where yasna- alone appears to denote a certain text. We have already discussed Vr 21.4 (no.7), where apardm yasndm refers to the second Yasna Haptaqhäiti recited at the beginning of Vr 21. Y 71.6 (no. 11) praises the texts that have just been recited, i.e. the Gathas, the Yasna, and, probably, the äbzöhr. One could argue here that vTspdm yasndm 'the entire Yasna' meant the 72-chapter text, at the end of which this stanza is recited. However, the Gathas, too, are referred to as vïspaêca... gäSa 'and all Gathas', and we know for sure that they constitute only a part of the 72-chapter Yasna liturgy. Therefore, since the Gathas and äb zôhr are clearly defined parts of the Yasna liturgy, Bartholomae was probably right in his interpreta-tion that vïspdm yasndm meant the YH.25 The remaining four passages, where yasna- alone refers to a text, are found in the Nerangestan (N 20,26 22,24 and 40). In Ν 22, the recitation of the Gathas is contrasted with that of the yasna-: (19) Ν 22 'srao 3ra \"nä gädanqm +ratufris paiti. astica yasnahe αδαßüsö mq&rahe ahezïnâ fsrauuaijhö +aframdrditi ästriieite ya da gâ 9anqmcit gä 3d srâuuaiiô yasndm yazdntdm paitistäiti vïspanqm gä9anqm ratufris yasndm yazäiti gäSanqm + srâuuaiiamnanqm paitisti yasnahe aëuuahe ratufris aratufris gä Sanqm Ά man pleases the Ratus by the recitation of the Gathas and by standing by at the Worship, and equally at the Formula of the Cattle Breeder.

The passage is about the recitation of texts from the Older Avesta, in which the YH is embedded. One indication that yasna- refers to the YH,27 is not only that it is contrasted with the Gathas, but also that an-other text of the Yasna liturgy is mentioned, the 'Mantra of the Cattle Breeder',/swsö mqßra, comprising Y 58. This would not make sense if yasna- referred to the entire 72 chapter text. Furthermore, if yasna- does refer here to the YH, this passage provides evidence for the view that the Yasna Haptaqhäiti was considered as part of the Gathas. The discussion of the declamation of the sacred texts continues, in the Nerangestan, with the question of simultaneous recitation by two priests and the objectionable behaviour of one who, while celebrating the Wor-ship (yasna-), listens to the recitation of the other priest instead of con-centrating on his own.28 Such behaviour does not 'please the Ratus': (20) Ν 24 yäyasndm +yazdnti +afsmainiiuuq vä vacastastiuuat vä uua ' ratufriia hqm.srut. +väciiä5a +yazdnti +uua aratufriia kat hqm.srut.väcimca yat hakat +ämrütö afsmainiiuuqnca + vacastastiuutca auui +ainiiö +surunuuaiti nôit ainiiö aësô ratufris yö nôit * aißi.surunuuaiti 27 As suggested by Bartholomae, Alliranisches Wörterbuch, col. 1272. 28 F.M.

One may wonder whether the expression staota- yesniia-, which in the Younger Avesta denotes the central part of the Yasna,34 may be translated as 'praises be-longing to the worship', in the sense of 'praises arranged around the yasna-', the latter referring to the Yasna Haptaqhäiti. In the oldest form of this liturgy, the staota-, 'praises', would have been the Gathas. CONCLUSION Although the language of the YH is also the Old Avestan idiom, it dif-fers from the Gathas in a number of ways. From a formal point of view, the Yasna Haptaqhäiti—unlike the Gathas—is not composed in a sylla-ble counting metre, but in rhythmic speech.35 Furthermore, while the rit-ual function of the Gathas does not emerge clearly, that of the Yasna Haptaqhäiti is obvious. The predominant use of the first person plural 'we' in the Yasna Haptaqhäiti, in contrast to the singular Τ of the Gathas, indicates that this text was meant to be recited by or on behalf of the community of worshipping Mazdayasnians. As we have seen, there are also unequivocal references to the ritual fire, in front of which the worshippers stand. Moreover, while the Gathas abound with references to the rejection of evil, the latter is not even mentioned in the YH. It appears, therefore, that the YH is the text of worship par excel-lence, being entirely dedicated to the worship and praise, yasndmcä vahmdmcä in the language of the YH, of Ahura Mazdä and his spiritual and physical creations. Furthermore, in this text the worshippers express their commitment to dedicating their thoughts, words and deeds to 32 Kotwal/Kreyenbroek, The Herbedestan and Nërangestan, vol. 2, p. 123 with n. 437. 33 On häiti- as referring specifically to the Gathas, see Bartholomae, Altiranisches Wörterbuch, col. 1801. 34 Cf.

Kreyenbroek Oral transmission plays an important role in the history of the sacred and religious texts of Zoroastrianism. While many scholars hold that Zarathustra, to whom the Zoroastrian tradition attributes its origin, lived in pre-history—perhaps around 1200 or 1000 BCE—no alphabet that was suitable for representing the sound system of the Old Iranian lan-guage of its sacred texts appears to have been known in Iran until such a script was developed in the course of the Sasanian period (226-651 CE). Until that time the corpus of Old Iranian sacred texts, the Avesta, must have been handed down orally. In the course of time, the centre of Zoroastrian culture shifted from Eastern Iran to the west of the country, the heartland of the Achaemenian Empire (ca. 550-330 BCE), where 'Avestan' was a foreign language. It has been argued1 that the relative unfamiliarity of the sacred language led the West Iranian priesthood to memorise all religious texts verbatim, which in turn led to the fixation of the many texts that may until then have been transmitted more freely. Possibly at the same time or perhaps a little later, when the 'Old Iranian' period gave way to the 'Middle Iranian' stage in the development of the languages of the Zoroastrian communities, the 'Avestan' language came to seem increasingly obscure, and a simple word-for-word translation into contemporary Iranian languages came into being. This enabled the priesthood to understand the meaning of the Avesta to some extent, while the simplicity of the translation technique enabled scholar-priests (hërbed) to memorise and study a surprisingly large number of Avestan texts with their translation (which was known as Zand), apparently with-out relying on written sources. The translations of the Zand were not al-ways illuminating, however, and in the course of time scholar-priests' comments were memorised along with the actual translations. The extant Zand texts are all in Middle Persian or Pahlavi, although similar texts must have existed in other Iranian languages. 1 See Ph.G. Kreyenbroek, \"The Zoroastrian Tradition from an Oralist's Point of View\", K.R. Cama Oriental Institute, Second International Congress Proceedings, ed. H.J.M. Desai/H.N.

Prime examples of such texts are the Wïdëwdâd or Vendidad, which is now used as a liturgical text, and the Hërbedestân and Nërangestân, with which this article is primar-ily concerned. These texts originally seem to belong to the learned— rather than liturgical—tradition of Sasanian Zoroastrianism.2 While the Vendîdâd eventually came to be recited as part of a Zoroastrian liturgy (see below), the Hërbedestân and Nërangestân retained their exclusively learned character. Among other things this meant that, unlike liturgical texts, which were regularly recited by groups of priests who would cor-rect any mistakes they noticed in each other's recitation, they were handed down by a single teacher to his students, who would not be in a position to correct the teacher's lapses. Given the corruptions resulting from oral transmission by a single au-thority, combined with the fact that the Hërbedestân and Nërangestân were composed by priests for priests, and deal with highly technical questions in a terse style not intended to enlighten outsiders, scholarly enthusiasm for these examples of Sasanian learning has so far been lim-ited. Darab Dastur Peshotan Sanjana brought out a facsimile of Ms HJ in 18943 and in 1915 S.J. Bulsara published a relatively unenlightening translation of the whole text.4 A. Waag's German translation of the Avestan passages appeared in Leipzig in 1941.5 The text has aroused little scholarly interest since then, until Dastur Dr. Firoze M. Kotwal of Mumbai decided to devote his energies to the work. Together with J.W. Boyd he brought out a facsimile edition of Ms TD,6 and since the late 1980s Dastur Kotwal has collaborated with the present writer on an edi-tion and annotated translation of the Hërbedestân and Nërangestân, which has so far led to the publication of two volumes.7 2 This tradition also included texts which were not based on an Avestan original, such as the legal work Mâdayân f Hazâr Dâdestân. 3 D.P.

There are many grammati-cal imperfections, both in the Avestan and the Pahlavi sections of the text, and mutually exclusive judgements by different priestly commenta-tors are mentioned side by side. Given the impossibility, in an oral sys-tem, of comparing traditions in detail, no method was developed to es-tablish the relative validity of the judgements of qualified authorities (dastwar). The Ner. reflects a system of case law; it contains judgements on a range of questions connected with ritual. Besides the actual rules and regulations, the text yields important information about the way of thinking that informed the judgements. Thus the work affords an insight into the discipline of 'ritual studies' as taught by Zoroastrian religious authorities. The evidence of the text can be regarded as synchronic insofar as it must have been approved by some religious authority when it was writ-ten down; at the same time, it is also a multi-layered document, reflect-ing the views of generations of Zoroastrian priestly teachers. Unfortu-nately we cannot be certain whether the opinions found there originated mainly in pre-Islamic or Islamic times; insufficient data have so far been found to offer definite proof either way. The absence in the Ner. of any references to the Vendïdâd, which is regularly mentioned as a source of authority—and probably as a liturgical text—in the relatively late Sup-plementary Texts to the Säyist-ne-Säyist8 suggests that the Ner. reached its final form well before the Supplementary Texts, but this is no more than relative chronology. In the following pages, it is intended to examine the evidence of the Ner. on the subject of (1) the performance of rituals, and the way of thinking that informed the judgements recorded there; and (2) some in-dividual rituals mentioned in the text, and their mutual connections. PART 1 : RULES CONCERNING THE PERFORMANCE OF RITUALS As in many other religions, Zoroastrian rituals were normally dedicated to divine beings and performed by priests for the sake of the souls of those who commissioned the ceremonies. Religious merit was thought of 8 See F.M. Kotwal, The Supplementary Texts to the Säyist ne-Säyist (Copenhagen, 1968), pp. 33,35."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"as a definite and measurable quantity, not unlike savings in a heavenly account, which would eventually determine the fate of the soul after death. That priests could help the laity acquire religious merit in a range of different ways is shown by the following passage: (7.5) Mard ka abër tuwânîgyazisn pad mizdpädixsäy kardan; harw 2-ën kirbag ôh bawëd. Pad drahm-ê be dahëd harw 2-ën radîhâ. *Kehïhâ kir-bag *öh bawëd... Mard ka abër tuwânîg xrafstar î grift pad wahägfröxtan pädixsäy; harw 2-ën 2 kirbag *öh bawëd, *öh griftan räy ud *ôh ôzadan räy. (7.5) If a priest is very able, it is permissible for him to perform an act of worship for a reward; thus both parties acquire merit. If he gives it (i.e. the ritual) for a dirham, both act in an authorised manner. If (he does it) for less, then there is still merit... If a priest is very able he may sell vermin which he has caught, for a price; both parties thus acquire twofold merit, once for catching it and (once) for killing it. Priests, in other words, could promote the eventual well-being of other people's souls by 'selling' (or indeed giving away, Ner. 7.3) the per-formance of a ritual, but also by the more unexpected practice of catch-ing and killing vermin and 'selling' these acts. Clearly, however, the composers of the Nërangestân were generally preoccupied with the per-formance of rituals. Insofar as one can speak of a 'discipline' of ritual studies reflected there, this focused on (1) the proper way of performing a valid ritual, and (2) the evaluation of adverse circumstances or im-proper actions which might affect the validity of the ritual and the merit resulting from it. As in many similar systems, notably in Islamic fiqh, norms and defi-nitions play a crucial role in Zoroastrian case law: while performing a ritual is expected to yield merit, severe mistakes may have the opposite effect and add to one's sins. To know what constitutes a sinful mistake one needs to be aware of the requirements for each individual ritual. However, what is a sin in one ritual may be permissible in another, and in some cases one can redefine one's ritual actions as constituting an-other, usually lesser, ceremony than was intended, in which a lapse does not constitute a sin. Neither merit nor sin accrues, moreover, if the ritual was not, after all, a ritual; it is necessary, therefore, to know under which conditions what was intended to be a ritual can be redefined as having been no more than an exercise. The Ner. normally gives the general rule first, followed by a discus-sion of the consequences of mishaps. General rules and definitions tell"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"one, for instance, when each of the watches (gäh) of the day begins (e.g. 28.1; 29.1); which rituals may be performed during certain gâhs (e.g. 29.5); which dedicatory formulas (snüman) are appropriate (29.16); which animals may be sacrificed (36-40); how many priests should take part (25.7); the minimum level of audibility (8, 9), and of cleanliness of water that is to be consecrated (30.15). Degrees of guilt are measured in the same way as those of merit; the various degrees of sin have been discussed by Kotwal.9 The evidence of the Ner. shows that an important consideration was that of intention: there was an apparently general agreement that someone who arranges to be awakened by another in order to take part in the great Gähämbär celebrations does not become a sinner if the other person fails to wake him in time (Ner. 2). Norms and definitions again play a prominent role: if one fails to celebrate the Gähämbär because one is drunk the crucial question is whether or not the amount of drink one has consumed is law-ful, and thus to be defined as 'nourishment', or an'excessive'. In the lat-ter case one becomes a sinner (Ner. 11), in the former one does not (Ner. 12). The commentator Sösäns says that one may have three draughts to go with one's food, and an additional three draughts; Kay-Âdur-bôzêd, on the other hand, holds that \"two draughts and a bit on top of that\" is too much. A ritual is by definition imperfect if the main celebrant or one of the assistant priests is sinful or—less seriously—'doubtful'. Apart from this, mishaps may take place during the performance: a sudden loud noise can render part of the liturgy inaudible, for instance; or something may fall into the holy water (zôhr); a priest may omit part of the text or make mis-takes in his recitation; or two chief celebrants (who may officiate sitting next to each other, but whose performances are regarded as wholly inde-pendent) may recite part of the text 'n unison'(i.e. together), which is a sin10 unless they agreed beforehand that they would recite in this man-ner. Imperfections in the formal performance of a ritual may have a range of consequences. It is regularly said that the offending priest becomes a sinner to an extent commensurate with the offence. 9 The Supplementary Texts to the Say ist në-Sâyist, p. 115. 10 Presumably because it may be due to a lack of concentration."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"(26.5)\" Ëwkardag gähämbär nëyazëd, pad jud.

There is one who says: \"It even (amounts) to the degree of a yät sin. In Avestan passages of the Ner. and their Middle Persian translation, punishments are sometimes mentioned: thus, if a priest omits one word from his recitation of the Gäthäs he shall be punished with three lashes, or work in the field for a day (24.15, 16; 25.1; 27.4); an offence that is too great to be atoned for by means of punishment remains in one's ac-count (27.1-4). Another form of punishment, it seems, was of an eco-nomic nature. Drinking alcohol during the Gähämbär celebrations is referred to more than once, suggesting that is was a common problem. If a priest was culpably drunk he could finish the ritual he was engaged in, but no merit would go to his account for this. If his status in this respect was 'doubtful', part of the merit of the ritual would accrue to him; in neither case could the priest participate in the—presumably lucrative -'votive offerings'.

And when his drinking is doubtful he counts as having celebrated the Gähämbär and not having celebrated the Rapihwin, and he should not celebrate the Ustôfrid but may still partake of it... Other offences, such as the omission of a quarter of the Gäthä liturgy, could similarly undo the merit resulting from the rite (24.6). However, if a shortcoming was excusable, some of the merit would accrue: if a priest legitimately has to leave the ritual early, he may omit the recitation of certain texts, and a (reduced) merit of'a thousand sheep' will still be his; if he returns in time to complete the ritual, however, he obtains the greater merit of 'a thousand cattle'. (24.13) Mard kë xwëskârihâ pad kâr-ë kâmëd Sudan pad ëd dârëd kü-m andar gäh abäz madan në tuwän u-s pane a tisrö dasa u raöß^m abäz hilisnïh u-s gähämbär be yazisnïh u-s hazaqrem maësan^m kirbag öh bawëd.

If he returns immediately and does celebrate (the full ritual), then he has the merit of a thousand cattle. A special way of calculating merit is expressed by the Avestan verb fra.mar- to 'concentrate' (on ritual activity, as opposed to actually per-forming it), Pahlavi fräz ösmurdan. The concept implies that, if a priest participates in a ritual that is flawed through no fault of his, he still ac-quires the merit of 'concentrating' on the liturgy. In other words, as much merit would accrue as would derive from studying a sacred text, memorising it, or repeating it to keep one's memory fresh.

If an imperfection occurs during the performance of a ceremony, various actions are possible. First of all, it may be best to continue as though nothing has happened: (28.39) Ka srös-drönxward ud barsom nëpadnigërisn apädyäb be bawëd ä-s be söyisn u-s be râyënisn u-s gumânïg *pardäxt bawëd.

If there is a sheep (to be sacri-ficed) for the service, it should still be killed; if it is a service with fat offer-ings (zôhr) then the zôhr should be offered. When notice has to be taken of the mishap, it is often possible to adapt the performance. If a dedicatory formula has not been recited, the priest must repeat the liturgy from the point where the omission occurred (18.4). If more than a verse (wacast) of the liturgy has been omitted dur-ing the Dron service (on which see below), the whole ceremony should be repeated (10.51; similarly for the Gähämbär, 25.5); if it was no more than a verse, only the verse in question should be recited (10.52). If sa-cred bread becomes polluted before it has been partaken of, the cere-mony must be started afresh (28.33). If a cup intended to hold conse-crated water falls on the ground, it should be washed and put away and may not be used for ritual purposes (28.19), which implies that another cup must be substituted. In other cases the ritual must be abandoned altogether. This is the case, for instance, if the flaw occurs early on in the ritual: if between the recitation offrastuiie in Yasna (Y.) 0.4, and of the bäj in Y. 0.13, the priest 'grows damp' (i.e. loses some bodily fluids), 'chatters', or leaves to answer a call of nature, all Teachings (of the great authorities) say that 14 I.e. his performance is acceptable. 15 I.e. the bundle of branches or metal wires held by the priest."},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"the ritual should be abandoned.16 If the seat of the fire is made of clayon gypsum, and it breaks, one should also terminate the performance: (28.33) Ätaxsgäh az gilën sâyëd ud gacërt sâyëd; hän padpädyäb bawëd.

If a straw is (visible) in it from top to bottom it is as if it is split from top to bot-tom. There is one who says thus: \"When it breaks, the act of worship should be terminated.\" As the above passage shows, some mishaps were too serious for remedial measures. In such cases the main question was whether the vitiated ritual resulted in a sin on the part of the priests, or if this could be prevented. As some Commentators pointed out or implied,17 a ritual which has not been formally completed is not yet a ritual and may be abandoned with-out leading to serious consequences. If, on the other hand, the chief priest has handed the barsom to one of the assistant priest while reciting Y. 72.5, the ritual has formally been concluded and must count as a ce-remony, so that the priests must take the consequences of any flaws. The consequences of some flaws may also be avoided by re-defining the ritual as one in which the occurrence would not constitute an offence. Thus, a Yasna ceremony may only be performed during one watch of the day; any transgressions detract from the merit of the ceremony (28.8,9). On the other hand, no such restrictions exist in the case of the—shorter and less meritorious—Dron service, most of whose components also oc-cur in the Yasna, so that a re-definition of the ritual as a Drän may allow one to avoid incurring a sin, and indeed to save at least some merit. The same stratagem can be employed in several other contingencies: 16 Ner. 19.9: Had pad hamäg câstag pad hän zamän bawëd ka zôt pad frastuiië ï bun be sawëd ta ka zôt pad wâz-gîrisnîh pad frastuiië Γ bun be sud, zôt ay ka be namëd, ay ka be drâyëd, ay ka kâr-ë wizärdan sawëd, hamäg yazisn sar. 17 See Kotwal/Kreyenbroek, The Hërbedestân and Nërangestân Vol. 2, pp. 109 ( 19.7 with notes 372-374)."},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"(19.11)....

Therefore it has been said that, in case of a bäzäy sin, a Drön ceremony should always be performed, as opposed to a Yasna ... It is per-missible to finish a Drön ceremony at night. A Yasna ceremony, moreover, could be performed by priests in order to 1 X obtain the highest degree of ritual power (khüb), rather than as a ser-vice primarily intended to gratify Divine Beings. A flawed Yasna could be re-defined in this sense so as to avoid sin (28.45): Edön uskärdkü kär Txüb be kunëd be në râyënëd ä sâyëd, \"It was considered that if one per-forms it (the Yasna) to obtain the khüb, but does not define (the ritual as a proper service), then it is permissible\". PART 2: INDIVIDUAL RITUALS The Nërangestân, or 'Text of Ritual Directions', reflects the ritual tradi-tions and realities of a bygone age, and thus invites a comparison with modern practice. In later Zoroastrianism the services now known as Yasna, Vïspered, and Vendïdâd play a prominent role. The core of all three rituals is the liturgy of the Yasna. For the Vïspered ceremony the text of the Yasna is interspersed with the 23 chapters (karde) of the text known as Vïspered. The liturgy of the Vendïdâd, a long night office which some scholars regard as being of post-Sasanian origin19 consists of the Yasna and Vïspered liturgies, to which the fragards (chapters) of the Vendïdâd are added.20 A shorter service, the Drön, forms part of the Yasna liturgy but can also be celebrated as a separate, short ritual. 18 See F.M.

References are found there to the introductory rites now known as Paragnœ, to the be-ginning of the service proper (Y. 1-3); to the Drön ceremony (X 3-8); the Hörn Stüt, or 'Praise of Haoma' {Y. 9-11); the Frastuiie (Y. 11.15— 13); the libation (Y. 14-18.8); the Horn-pressing service or Hömäst (Y. 22-27); the Gâthâs {Y. 28-34; 43-51; 53); the Yasna Haptanghäiti or Yasn ï Haft Häd (Y. 35-42); the Fsüsö Manthra (Y. 58-9); the AtesNi-yäyes (Y. 62.1-10); and finally to the Ab zôhr (Y. 62.11 -Y. 70). Curiously, however, Ner. 28 appears refer to a night office taking place in the Usahin watch whereas, then as now (29.5), the Yasna proper must be performed in the first daylight watch (Häwan). The only night office known in modern practice is the Vendïdâd. Since the ritual se-quence of a modern Vendïdâd largely corresponds to that of a Yasna, the passage presumably refers either to a predecessor of the Vendïdâd, or to that ceremony itself. The Vïspered ( Visp. ), on the other hand, is frequently referred to in the Ner. The term is either used independently, probably referring to what is now called a Vïspered liturgy, consisting of Yasna and Vïspered texts, or as 'the Vïspered of certain rituals (Dwäzdah-Hömäst, Ra&ßö. Bdrdzat, Ardäfraward, 13.4; and of the otherwise unknown Artö. karten, 28.21,24), meaning presumably that the kardes of the Visp. were added to the basic liturgies of these offices. In several places the Vïspered is mentioned to-gether with an office called Bagän Yasn, e.g. (29.5): En and yazisn andar gâh ι häwan kunisn: nög-näwar... wïsparad ud bagän yasn. \"The follow-ing services should be performed in the Häwan watch: the ... NögNäwar (i.e. Yasna without additional ritual), the Vïspered, and the Bagän Yasn.\" Similarities in status between the Yasna, Vïspered, and the Bagän Yasn are further suggested by: (28.41) Zöt ka häuuanänam ästäiia në gôwëd [ka në pad kardag mad estëd] u-sän pad yast ïkeh be *râyênïd; pad wïsparad ud bagän yasn sâyëd bü-dan. Râspïg ka az3m visai në gôwëd ι pad kär andar yazisn, pad tis-iz kär në sâyëd. Ka ëk pad gâh-ë hamë be gôwëd, pad hamäg kär sâyëd. (28.41) If the zöt does not recite häuuanändm ästiia [if (the service) does not include kardes], then they have arranged it as a lesser service {yast ï keh)\\ this may happen in the case of the Vïspered or the Bagän Yasn. If the assistant celebrant does not recite azam vTsäi, which must be recited in the ritual, then he is not fit for any ritual work. If he says it once, in any gäh, then he is fit for all ritual work."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"The words häuuanändm ästäiia form part of Visp. 3.1, and are still recited in the modern Vîspered liturgy after Y. 11. Evidently this Vispered text was also recited as part of the liturgy of a ritual known as Bagän Yasn. This implies that, as in the case of the modem Vendidad, the Vispered formed part of the Bagän Yasn liturgy. The question remains, however, what ritual the term Bagän Yasn refers to. In the Pahlavi Books, the term Bagän Yast or Bagän Yasn 21 are used to refer either to Y. 19-21 (which contain fre-quent references to the word baya- 'prayer'), or to the contents of an an-cient Avestan text, the Bagän Nask.22 The latter text contained the Yasts, the hymns to the Divine Beings which are now mostly read as prayers, but are generally too long to have served such a purpose before printed prayer books were available. There appears to be no indication in the Ner. of any connection between the term Bagän Yasn and Y. 19-21. On the other hand, the liturgies requiring the recitation of häuuanändm ästäiia are de-fined as being pad kardag, 'with kardes', which makes it seem likely that, like the modem Hymns (and the Vispered), the Bagän Yasn was divided into sections known as karde. The above passage could therefore be taken to imply that, like the modem VendTdäd service, the Bagän Yasn consisted of the liturgy of the Yasna, interspersed with texts from the Vispered. Instead of texts from the ancient Wïdëwdâd Nask (i.e. the VendTdäd),23 they would further have contained additional liturgical texts from the Bagän Nask (i.e. Yasts). That the Bagän Yasn was indeed connected with the recitation of our ' Yasts' is confirmed by another passage, whose interpretation is made difficult by the polyvalence of the terms yast and yasn, both of which can be used for the ritual as a whole but also for some of its con-stituent parts: (29.10) Κ a bagän yasn yazëd tä srös yasn nërang hamäg ëdôn bawëd ciyön pad wïsparad. (29.11 ) Pad srös yasn-ë, pës-iz ud hän îpas u-s harwyasn-ë, pad bun wäz fräz girëd ud pad sar be göwisn. Be hän ka-s az yasn guft [ä-s az yast guft bawëd], cë-s hän në göwisn.

Ka në, bagän yasn yazëd, az hän kë snüman az hän gyägjud az srös yasn. 21 The terms yasn and yast were used more or less synonymously. 22 See Encyclopaedia Iranica, vol 3, p. 406. 23 The term Nask is used for a compilation of Avestan texts which were felt to belong together; when the Avesta came to be written down the Nasks could be thought of as the 'Books' of the Avesta. Most of the Nasks are no longer extant."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"(29.10) When one performs the Bagan Yasn, up to the Sros Yasn the ritual directions are all as for the Vïspered. (29.11) In the Srôs Yasn, for the first the last and each karde {yasn) one takes the bäj at the beginning and leaves it at the end.24 Except if one recites it as part of a service {yasn) for him (Sraosa) [i.e. when one has recited it as part of a ritual {yast) dedicated to him], for one should not recite it (so) for that. There is one who says thus: \"Even if he recited it as part of a ritual for him, he should recite it thus.\" If not, he celebrates a Bagän Yasn, since the dedications differ from that of the Srôs Yasn from there on. The obviously imprecise use of the word yasn (once elucidated in the text by the equally polyvalent yast) forces one to interpret the words as the context seems to demand. The above interpretation is based on the simi-larity between the contents of the passage and the modern Parsi practice of reciting each karde of the Hymn to Sraosa (F. 57) with special formu-lae, except if the whole Yasna is dedicated to Sraosa, in which case these special honours were evidently felt to be unnecessary.25 If this analogy is valid, the passage means that if one recites the Bagän Yasn as part of a liturgy which also comprises the Vïspered there are no additional ritual directions (the same is true of the modern Vendïdâd), except that one should recite each karde of the Hymn to Sraosa with special formulae unless the entire service is dedicated to Sraosa. If one fails to do this, the ritual is still valid, but is to be defined as a Bagän Yasn rather than a Srôs Yasn. The passage implies, moreover, that the hymn to Sraosa was one of several parts of the Bagän Nask that were recited during this service: only the recitation of the Srôs Yast is said to have needed special atten-tion, implying that there were other additional texts. This makes it seem possible that the Bagän Yasn comprised hymns (or parts of hymns) to all Divine Beings (Yazad) to whom a day of each month was dedicated. This would, incidentally, help to explain the survival of these texts while most non-liturgical texts have been lost. It seems possible in view of all this, that liturgies structured along the lines of the Bagän Yasn served as a model when the Vendïdâd came to be used as a liturgy. The evidence from the Ner. suggest, moreover, that passages from the ancient Hädöxt Nask could be used in the same way in 24 The term bäj refers here to a prayer recited at the beginning and end of a ritual or a part of a ceremony. 25 Information I owe to Dastur Dr. F.M. Kotwal."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"a ceremony known as Hâdôxt (Ner. 24.8,10,11 ; according to 24.10, the Hädöxt was a high ritual that could be performed at great festivals such as the Gähämbärs). The assumption that texts from the ancient Avestan Nasks could be added to a sequence of texts from the Yasna and Vis-pered would account, moreover, for a passage in the 9th-century work Dädestän îDênïg (DD. 65), which refers to a ritual priest (häwist), who \"has five Nasks of the Avesta by heart but knows no Zand at all\", and to a scholar-priest (hêrbed) who \"has the VendTdäd and five fragards of the Nërangestân by heart, the Avesta with the Zand\", but \"cannot recite a single Nask as a chief priest in his own right.\"26 The ability to recite sev-eral Nasks as part of the liturgy could thus be represented as a normal accomplishment for a ritual priest when the Zoroastrian religion was al-ready in decline. In the long run, however, such long rituals presumably made demands on the priesthood that were difficult to meet at a time when Zoroastrianism had been reduced to a marginal religion and com-munities were impoverished. This may account for the disappearance of the Bagän Yasn and the Hädöxt from the later ritual tradition. While the texts we know as Yast evidently formed part of the long Ba-gän Yasn, Ner. 29 also describes a shorter ritual, normally dedicated to the Yazad of the day, which seems to have consisted essentially of the consecration and ritual consumption of a sacred bread (dröri), and whose liturgy included the appropriate prayer for the watch of the day, and the Yast to the divinity to whom the day was dedicated. The following pas-sage was clearly intended to show how such services should be struc-tured: (29.12) U-sän harw yazisn-ë [yasn] pädixsäy guftan ka röz hän gyäg röz; ka në, hän ïmeh (29.13) Yasn pädixsäy [ka yasn yazëd] : barsom î7 täg, aiwyähan ïgastag ud drön ëk, udyasn-iz Tgäh Tdârëdpad *ëdyasn ul guft estëd.

It would seem, therefore, that most of the rituals mentioned in the Nër-angestän can be divided into two basic categories: (1) Short services which essentially consisted of a Drön offering with appropriate dedica-tions, ritual, and liturgy; the latter could include the Hymn (Yast) to the divinity of the day. (2) High rituals, which always included the recitation of the Gäthäs. The basic structure of these was formed by the sequence of ritual acts and liturgical texts which characterises the modern Yasna ceremony; to these could be added the karde s of the Vïspered, as well as texts from Nasks such as the Bagän and Hädöxt and presumably the Vendïdâd."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"THE YASNA RITUAL IN PAHLAVI LITERATURE Shaul Shaked Being familiar with the text of the Yasna seems to have been an accom-plishment which a well-brought-up educated man was expected to pos-sess in the Sasanian period.

The court servant goes on to enumerate his various accomplishments, but what follows will not be relevant for our present purpose. Part of the intellectual formation of a well brought-up gentleman in the Sasanian period consisted, as we see from this text, of memorizing certain key passages from the Avesta, accompanied by their Pahlavi ver-sion, the Zand. It is not the Yasna ritual which is mentioned, it is the ability to recite the text and the Pahlavi version corresponding to it by heart. This is an important point for the history of the Avesta: even to the situation. 13 I.e., my parents'. 14 I take it that a commemoration feast is intended, in which the inheritance of the fa-ther is assigned, but have no evidence for such a feast in Iran. Or is sûr by extension also \"estate\"? 15 östäftan is \"to oppress\", perhaps also \"to press\". I assume that the verb has here the sense of to press into shape. Unvala reads saxt ud östäb and translates \"steadfast and ardent\", emending the reading of the first word, and twisting the meaning of the second. 16 What is transcribed here ud nan <ud> yasn is written something like W n'nysn. I take it that nân, if the reading is correct, is the prayer called nän xwarisn (or wäzl), but its place in this list is somewhat incongruous and raises doubts whether the reading is correct.

MacKenzie, A concise Pahlavi dictionary (London, 1971, repr. 1986)), is here another designation for a writing skill, perhaps in a compound such as *bârïk-dibîr, the latter part of which may have been omitted in the manuscript tradition. 19 dânisn-kâmag is the literal equivalent of \"philosopher\". It is hard to tell what exact scribal accomplishment is meant by this term here. 20 I.e., malleable, flexible fingers, a characteristic of a good scribe? One could also think of a compound such as \"having fingers (suitable for the) work\"."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"though the text may have already existed in written form, the way to study it continued to be oral, as is still the case up to our time. Another point worth noting is the fact that despite a certain tendency for restrict-ing the teaching of Zand, a good courtier was not bound by this obser-vance. It may even be argued that the restriction had a more theoretical value than a practical one, or that it was a sectorial restriction, to be ap-plied only outside the well-tested circles of the clergy, the court, and simi-lar groups. Another text which alludes to the same phenomenon is Ardä Wiräz Nämag, where, however, the people who are said to have memorized the Avesta are women: ud awe wiräz räy haft xwah bûd ud awësân harw haft xwahän wiräz ceôn zan büd hënd. u-sän dën warm ud yast kard estäd (AWn 2:1-221). The (said) Wiräz had seven sisters, and those seven sisters were like wives to Wiräz. They had memorized the Avesta and performed the Yasna. The yasna as a Zoroastrian ritual has tremendous power.

The function of the Yasna, the Niyäyisn and the invocations in the story of creation is, as is to be expected of such teleological situations, to un-derline the enormous anti-demonic power of the ceremonies concerned. 21 AWn = Ardä Wiräz nämag-, cf.

Celebrating the Yasna ritual five times by the Sôsâns accompanies the Resurrection and brings it about (PhlRiv 48, 56; Zs 35, 26-29). The demon is chased away by another performance of the Yasna (PhlRiv 48, 76, but the text here seems somewhat corrupt). It is the merit of Molé23 to have shown how the very notion of the celebration of the Yasna is designed in Zoroastrianism to evoke, to fore-shadow and to anticipate the eschatological events of the Frasêgird, and in particular the Resurrection. In a sense, the Yasna ritual is expected to bring them about, to actualize them. The Zoroastrian doctrine of the sac-rifice, he has demonstrated, is a constant evocation of the unity of the notions of creation and eschatology. There is perhaps no other religion in which the beginning and the end of the world are so closely held to-gether, apart from Manichaeism, which is modelled on the Zoroastrian myth. Creation in the Zoroastrian theology has no other aim but to lead towards eschatology; eschatology has no meaning but as completing the work of creation, and both, taken together, are two crucial stages in the battle against evil. One of the culminating points of the Yasna text, as observed by Molé,24 is the wish expressed as part of the liturgy: atcä töi vaëm xiiâmâ // yöi Im farasam karanaon ahüm (Y 30:9a). Thus may we be those who will make existence brilliant.25 In this verse it seems to me that one has to be single-mindedly idiosyn-cratic to deny an eschatological connection. It is \"existence\" (ahu-) that the worshipping community wishes to make \"brilliant\" or \"wonderful\" (frasa-), not \"(ritual) existence\", as claimed by Kellens and Pirart.26 The term \"existence\" does not necessarily exclude the ritual aspect, but if one insists, without any internal evidence, to take \"existence\" in the narrow 23 M.

It is un-likely that for the ancient worshippers existence would have been sliced up into small compartments; if it were, would they not take the trouble of specifying which kind of existence they had in mind? I know that quoting the Pahlavi rendering of this verse would not be a relevant ar-gument for its original meaning in the eyes of Kellens and Pirart, but, on the other hand, does the fact that something is taken in one particular sense by the Zoroastrian tradition already constitute a proof that it is wrong? Here, in any case, is the Pahlavi version of the text: edön-ez amäh ke to hëm [ke tö xwës hëm amâh] ën fraskerd-kunisn andar axwân (PhiY, p. 13727). Thus too, we, who are yours, are those to whom belongs the performance of eschatology in existence. The Pahlavi translation is clumsy and literal, and may betray an imper-fect understanding of the Gäthic language, but there is no reason to doubt that the Zoroastrian tradition as reflected in this rendering took the phrasefrasa- kr- to mean the performance of eschatology. It is possible to drive the single-minded insistence on ritual to an extreme by claiming that the Pahlavi axwân, which looks like a plural form (and may refer to the two types of existence, mënôg and gëtïg; or to the two times of exis-tence, the here-and-now as well as the world-to-come),28 also refers nar-rowly to ritual existence. This would however be a subjective construc-tion without solid basis. At the end of time, no yasna is necessary any more. Like other sacred objects and observances, the yasna will be replaced at the end of times: göhrlg yast yazisn stäyisn ï abar frasêgird-kardârlh Τ wehlh (Zs 35:15).29 Instead of celebrating the Yasna, (there will be) praise concerning the ac-complishment of goodness through eschatology.

The time of the Renovation is introduced by a chanting of the Yasna of the accomplishment of the Renovation by Sösäns and the six agents of the Renovation (Zs 35:19). That performance of the Yasna is a reflection of the golden age of Yima (Zs 35:20). Some of the legalistic details around the Yasna ritual are interesting. In a passage of the book Säyast ne säyast we have the following passage: yaziSn I andar man I ätaSän kunënd ka ne xüb ö dëwân ne rasëd. ud ân Τ abärlg gyäg kunënd ka ne xüb kunënd ö dëwân rasëd. ce yaziSn miyänag ne bawëd ayäb ö yazdän ayäb ö dëwân rasëd (SnS 9:5).30 A yasna ceremony which one performs in the house of fire does not go to the demons (even) if it is not performed well. When such a ceremony is per-formed elsewhere, it goes to the demons if it is not performed well. For the yasna is not in the middle; it goes either to the divine beings or to the de-mons.31 In other words (if my understanding of the text is correct), the harm caused by an inappropriate performance of the Yasna ritual is not inher-ent to the performance itself. It depends on the place where it is per-formed as well as on the degree of ritual fidelity of the performance. Per-forming it in a consecrated place like a fire temple is already a guarantee that it will not increase the power of the demons. The notion that a bad ritual reaches not the divine beings but the de-mons is recurrent in the Pahlavi texts. Here is another example. When the idea of sending someone to the other world to retrieve information as to whether the religious duties performed by the believers are effective or not is considered, here is the wording of the deliberations: ud pas az ën mardomän Τ ërânSahr êk abâg did <pad> äSöb ud pahikär büd ud ceön-sän xwadäy ud dehbad ud sâlâr ud dastwar I dën-âgâh ne büd. ud pad eis I yazdän <pad> gumän büd hënd {ud} was-ëwënag kës ud war-rawisn <ud> jud-ristagïh ud gumänlh ud jud-dädestämh andar gëhân be δ paydäglh ämad. tä än ka zäd hu-firaward anöSag-ruwän ädurbäd I mahras-pandän ke pades passäxt ï pad dën-kard röy ï widaxtag abar war rëxt. ud cand dädestän ud dädwarlh abäg jud-kësân ud jud-warrawisnän be kard ud ën dën andar âëbiân ud mardomän andar gumän büd hënd. ud pas mö-mardän ud dastwarän I dën ane büd hënd. az än mar andöhömand ud purr-30 SnS= Sâyast-në-sayast, ed J.C.Tavadia, Säyast-ne säyast.

After this the people of the kingdom of Ërân were in turmoil and fight against each other. As they had no lord, no ruler, no chief and no religious authority who was versed in religious matters, and as they were in doubt concerning the matter of the divine beings, faiths and beliefs and heresies and doubtful views and deviant laws of many kinds appeared in the world, until the time when there was born Ädurbäd son of Mahraspand, of good fravasi, of immortal soul, on whose breast molten bronze was poured in his ordeal following the (proper) religious act.32 He conducted numerous legal battles with the holders of deviant faiths and beliefs, for (?)33 this religion was in confusion and people were in doubt. Afterwards the simple priests and the religious authorities be-came different. On that account they became worried and pained, and sought an assembly in the court of the victorious Farrbay fire. There was much dis-course and discussion concerning the following: \"We must seek a means so that someone should go and bring information from the mënôg entities so that the people who are in this world should know whether this Yasna, Drön, Äfri-nagän, Nërang, Pädyäb (ritual cleansing) and Yosdähnh (ritual purification) which we perform reach the divine beings or the demons, and whether or not they come to the help of our souls. This is not the only place where we hear of doubts and anxieties con-cerning the religious truths and the efficacy of the religious observances, and indeed the whole of the story of the righteous Wiräz revolves around the need to prove that the injunctions of the religious are borne out by the evidence of the inhabitants of the other world, the world of mënôg. An injunction to invite the divine beings (theyazads) and the spirits of the righteous (the fravasi) to attend the yazisn ceremony is heard: pad hamäg yaziSn pad bun Τ yaziSn ud bun Τ drön yazdân ud ahlawän frawahr be ö yaziSn niwëyëniân (SnS 9:11). For the whole yazisn ceremony, one should invite the divine beings and the spirits of the righteous to the yazisn at the beginning of the yazisn and at the beginning of the drôn.M 32 Gignoux maintains that this is an allusion to the book Dënkard. 33 Instead of W one would expect here something like MH. 34 Tavadia's translation is slightly different."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"Although such an invocation is not actually attested in the ceremony, it makes good sense, and it is probably present there, at least implicitly.35 The texts dealing with eschatology give us a good indication as to the relative weight of meritorious deeds or sins.

I then made a first step into the star region through Good Thought, that place where Good Thought is at home. I saw the spirits of the righteous like stars of which the bright luminosity spreads out of them. Their place and seat was very bright, lofty and full of splendour. I asked Srôs the Righteous and Ädur the divine being: \"What is this place? What are these people?\" Srö§ and the di-vine Ädur said: \"This is the region of the stars. Those are the spirits who did not perform the Yasna in gëtîg, and did not chant the Gäthäs, and did not prac-tise Xwëdôdah (next-of-kin marriage), and did not fulfil the function of a lord, a ruler, a chief; (but) were righteous in (doing) the other good deeds. People who did not distinguish themselves while they lived in the mate-rial world by performing the Yasna and the other major requirements of piety: chanting the Gäthäs, performing the next-of-kin marriage, as well as being at the head of the community, are still allotted a place among the righteous for performing the lesser meritorious acts, and are not con-sidered utterly wicked. In a late composition, the Sad-dar Bundahisn, it is said that those who performed the Yast (i.e. Yasna) will be given at the Resurrection garments of gold, silver and precious stones (SDBd, p. 176, §35).36 One aspect of the Yasna ritual as it is developed in the Pahlavi books is the curious ambiguity which exists around the notion of sacrifice and the immolation of the good creatures, like the bovines, which are des-35 Cf. the note in Tavadia's edition of SnS, p. 120, n. 11:3-3.

While it is definitely not vegetarian, the Zoroastrian tradition is inclined to restrict the consumption of meat by demanding that it be within measure (this means primarily not to kill young animals before they reach maturity). It apparently wishes to minimize the suffering of animals when they are being killed, hence the preference for suffocation rather than slaughter, and it also means avoid-ance of blood sacrifice, although the ritual consumption of meat is part of certain ceremonies. The great sympathy shown to the suffering of animals in the texts, right from the Gäthäs, where the figure of the \"soul of the cow\" occupies a prominent role, is remarkable.37 The Yasna ritual, as it figures in the Pahlavi sources, has a multiplic-ity of forms and meanings, as can be expected to exist in a great religious tradition. The text of the Yasna forms part of the education of a Zoroas-trian. The text was memorized if not by all members of the community, at least by all members of a certain elite class, and its recitation is a commonplace ritual undertaken with considerable frequently. The ritual of the Yasna, as it is set out in the Pahlavi texts, carries an enormous burden of significance and power, both symbolic and actual, represent-ing, as it seems to do, primarily the eschatological notion offrasêgird, the Renovation of the World, originally perhaps in both its aspects: hic et nunc, and in the remote end of time. It also brings forth to consciousness the intimate connection between creation and eschatology. Embedded within this ritual is the reminiscence of a sacrifice, and, somewhat paradoxically, the conscious desire to avoid as much as possi-ble the immolation of cattle and the causing of unnecessary suffering to living creatures. The cow represents a double position in the Yasna text: on the one hand, it stands for the suffering of the animal, the object of a regular sacrifice, but the blame of its suffering is diverted from the sacri-ficer to the wrong-doers, to the daëvas; at the same time it seems to sym-bolize the suffering of all the righteous innocent, and it may thus be said to stand for the suffering of humanity under the oppression of the de-mons. For the last point let us look at the conclusion of Y 29, which is 37 On this subject cf. particularly Molé, Culte, mythe et cosmologie dans l'Iran an-cien, pp. 193-202. See also Sh.

In the last line of the last verse of that Yasna we read: \"O Ahura, (come) down to us now, to us, in accordance with the munificence of those such as you\".38 The Pahlavi version ren-ders this as follows: ohrmazd nun amäh kämag än Τ ö amäh râdTh Τ az Smäh [nun ka afdih Τ Smäh wës dânëm harn nëkïh az smäh kämag-tar büd ke gôwëd ëd nun ka dën rawäg be büd man ud häwiStän Τ man mizd az tö kämag].

Some said thus: Now that the religion has become widespread, I (=Zoroaster) and my disciples desire (to get) reward from you.] The suffering of the cow and the implied help that is promised her by Ohrmazd are directly interpreted as holding a promise to give also some help and assistance to human suffering and even more: to give Zoroaster and his disciples, the believers, a reward for their good deeds, which in-clude, primarily, the performance of the Yasna. These are just some of the themes which emerge from the interpreta-tion of the Gäthäs in the Pahlavi literature. There are several other topics scattered in the Pahlavi literature. Does the Pahlavi literature faithfully reflect the original ideas of the Gäthäs? This is an unfair question. The later Zoroastrian tradition continues, elaborates and amplifies the texts of the Gäthäs. It often reads into them new ideas which were not and could not be part of the ancient texts. It often distorts the meaning of the an-cient texts whether unwittingly or deliberately; either in order to make a point, or because of insufficient philological training—these are well-known ways by which a religion develops and changes. Some misunder-standings are constructive for the later development of a religious tradi-tion, but in many cases what looks like a misunderstanding is really a deliberate play on words and meanings of the sacred text. It seems to me meaningless to ask whether the Pahlavi tradition is a direct continuation of the message of the Gäthäs. The answer in Zoroas-trianism, as in Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Buddhism is: yes and no. There is no religious movement which remains immutable without un-dergoing development and change. There are, however, very few reli-gious phenomena which present a clean and radical break with their ori-38 Humbach's translation."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"gins.

This is clear from the monumental inscriptions some of them left behind, from their coins, from the iconography of royal art in rock reliefs, seals and silver plates, and, of course, from the whole body of literature devoted to their dynas-tic, political and military history.1 The fact that the Sasanian kings were Zoroastrians should not, by itself, pose too many problems. With the ex-ception of the comparatively short period of Seleucid domination (from Alexander of Macedon (330 BCE) to the early second century BCE), the dynasties that ruled (parts of) the Iranian world before the Sasanians (the Achaemenians from 550 to 330 BCE; and the Parthians from the third or second century BCE to 224 (or 226) CE) were also Zoroastrians. In most scholarly literature, however, the religious sentiments and politics of the Sasanian dynasty are considered to have been of a much stronger quality and intensity than those of their forerunners. The Sasanian kings them-selves carefully fostered this image of a greater attachment to Zoroas-trianism in their dynasty, but it is in reality little more than a pious fic-tion. The question is not whether Sasanian kings did or did not adhere to Zoroastrianism—this they obviously did—but whether their ideas on their predecessors correspond to reality. This does not seem to be the case. The dynastic history of Iran that was created in the Sasanian period 1 For introductions to the Sasanian Empire, see A.

Most strikingly, the Achaeme-nian dynasty has been almost totally effaced from memory, surviving only in the tragic figure of its last monarch, Darius III (Därä the son of Därä), whose chief function in the narrative is that he was defeated by Alexander.3 Between Alexander and the rise of the Sasanians, the period of the Seleucid and Parthian dynasties in Iran, we find the so-called \"petty kings\" (Middle Persian kadag-xwadäy, Arabic mulükal-tawä 'if), who chiefly represent the fragmentation of a realm (Iran) that was meant to have been united. This fragmentation, which eventually led to the res-toration of Iran under the Sasanians, was evident not only from the mili-tary failures and internecine quarrels of the \"petty kings\", but also from the fact that they had built too many fire-temples without the proper (i.e. royal) authorization.4 These fire-temples were subsequently destroyed by the first Sasanian king, Ardasïr I (r. 224-240), who \"restored\" a central-ized kingdom with a centralized church in Iran. It is very well possible that something similar in fact happened, but the general tendency of Sa-sanian sources (and sources based on these Sasanian traditions, which are the main sources to have survived) of presenting the rise of the Sa-sanians in terms of the establishment of order out of chaos makes it diffi-cult to disentangle facts from fantasies in this respect.

This is particularly true of the four inscriptions of the priest KerdTr, which contain a very large number of historical problems.5 KerdTr claims, inter alia, to have founded fire-temples, persecuted all non-Zoroastrian religions and to have brought back to orthodoxy all Zoroas-trian priests in the many provinces and lands of the new empire. Some of his claims are certainly unfounded; the persecutions of Jews, Christians and others are almost entirely absent from the literature of these religions themselves and seem never to have taken place.6 Unlike the Mani-chaeans, in whose traditions KerdTr does occur, the Zoroastrian church supposedly organised by KerdTr has completely forgotten him. He simply does not occur in any Zoroastrian Middle Persian text, a fact that still awaits analysis. With his campaign against the religions being a pious fiction, we should seriously consider the possibility that his other claims, chiefly the restoration of orthodoxy, were equally produced by his desire to meet the requirements of a high priestly authority in the service of a powerful king. The fact is that we know very little of the religious sentiments of many Sasanian kings; we know several who seem to have been devout Zoroastrians, but we also know some who seem to have had a keen in-terest in other options, chiefly Manichaeism and the Gnostic movement associated with the name of the \"arch-heretic\" Mazdak.7 Some Sasanian queens were themselves non-Zoroastrians and others were said to have had a keen interest in, for instance, Judaism.8 Alongside this evidence 5 The inscriptions have been gathered and translated conveniently by Ph.

This is caused at least partly by the fact that it is more than likely that with a few excep-tions, the Middle Persian books that have been preserved—and they are our chief source of information on Zoroastrian theology—do not origi-nate in court culture. These texts were mainly collected, edited and cop-ied in the ninth century, in a time when the number of Zoroastrians was rapidly decreasing and when royal support for the religion was a vague remembrance from the past.9 We cannot estimate the loss of ideas, texts and traditions properly, but there seems to have been a pattern of pre-serving \"useful\" texts rather than an attempt to preserve what was still there. Many aspects of Iranian learning characteristic of the Sasanian period, especially the more technical subjects of courtly learning, such as geography and the sciences, belles lettres and behaviour at court have been lost in their Middle Persian versions, but survive in translations and learned works from the new dominant religion, Islam.10 We can, there-fore, estimate the extent of Sasanian traditions fairly accurately, and it is not difficult to see why they were lost in their original version.

The most important of these is the charming story of King Husraw and his Page, which has been studied mainly for its unusually large amount of hapax legomena, because its core consists of catalogues of the pacities, and not a single author has ever recorded that specific requirements were made of them, with the exception of the court etiquette to be discussed below. 9 For a survey of these Middle Persian texts, see now C.G.

The information we have for that subject is enormous in quantity and consists of texts, images, and objects. The Middle Per-sian Zoroastrian texts, by contrast, are very silent on these matters, but an attempt will be made to relate the development of court rituals as much as possible to discussions in the study of Sasanian Zoroastrianism. The representation of the Sasanian kings in texts ultimately deriving from Sasanian traditions, in Arabic and early Persian literature, differs remarkably from representations of these kings in the literature produced by Christians in and around the Sasanian Empire. This is probably what one would expect, but in a subject as vulnerable to stereotypes and topoi as descriptions of royalty, one is likely to find many things one had ex-pected beforehand. The differences between these Arabic and Persian texts on the one hand and the Christian texts on the other take many shapes. The most important difference concerns the moral evaluation of the king's character, a subject explicitly forbidden to speculate about according to Persian etiquette, at least where it concerns the living mon-arch. 14 Christians, not bound by such rules, regularly present the kings as spiteful and hateful characters, driven by lust and greed and consumed by a desire to destroy everything the Christian authors themselves held sacred. Arabic and Persian sources have a few kings they clearly do not like, but in general they present the king as mild, just, and wise. A sec-ond eye-catching difference concerns the kings' health. Persian and Ara-bic sources usually present the king as a handsome man, excelling in sports, able-bodied and in excellent health. Christians, on the other hand, 12 For the text, see D.

Leprosy, skin-diseases and especially headaches are the favourite diseases Christian authors found in the Sasanian family. These diseases serve as an easy plot to introduce either miracles, in the form of unexpected healings brought about by Christians at court, or to introduce an even more desirable accomplishment: martyrdom. Martyr-dom is achieved in those cases where wicked Zoroastrian priests, or sometimes Jews, manage to convince the king or his courtiers that a cer-tain Christian had worked magic on the poor suffering prince or prin-cess.15 In the Church History of Socrates of Constantinople, such a plot suddenly present us with a glimpse, however imaginary, of a subject rarely found in any source: the private devotion of the king. The king regularly withdraws to a private oratory, to pray in order to be healed. This oratory, called oikiskon (\"little room\"), does not, of course, offer the king a real retreat from the world. It rather serves as a machine for evil Zoroastrian priests, who hide under the floor and speak in the name of their gods, asking the king to punish the Christians or else continue to suffer his unbearable headaches. In this case, the priests are found out and the Christians are richly rewarded.16 The story, without any doubt, does not reflect actual history. The stories in Arabic and Persian litera-ture, on the other hand, presenting the king as handsome and healthy, do not inspire much confidence for those who are looking for \"hard facts\" either. As narratives and interpretations, however, these stories are of great interest and these narratives—both in words and in sequences of acts or ritual—are the subject of the present contribution. Zoroastrian rituals have been at the centre of the history of Zoroas-trianism as it has been pursued in the past forty years.17 The evidence for most Zoroastrian rituals, however, in any period before Persian Zoroas-trian literature (i.e. the thirteenth century), is very meagre.

These are the barasnüm and other rites of purification, the rituals associated with death, and the rites of animal sacrifice.18 For these, we can reasonably well set up a sequence of texts and acts, but for most other rituals, this has either never been attempted or is plainly impossible.19 The develop-ment of the Yasna as ritual, for instance, is extremely vague and its his-tory is almost entirely unknown.20 A further problem in the study of Zo-roastrian rituals is that the evidence we have has led us to focus mainly on priestly rituals with priestly interpretations.21 Zoroastrianism is a \"non-congregational\" religion, which means that the community does not gather regularly—for example, once a week—for shared rituals.22 There are, of course, the Gähämbär or seasonal community festivals, par-ticipation in which is compulsory or at the very least highly meritorious, and there are other community festivals, but essentially, there is a re-markable distinction between the daily and regularly returning rituals performed by priests and the ritual life of lay Zoroastrians, which is pri-vate or family-based.23 Since the majority of Pahlavi texts were written 18 For the barasnüm, see A. de Jong, \"Purification in absentia·. On the Development of Zoroastrian Ritual Practice\", Transformations of the Inner Self in Ancient Religions, eds J. Assmann/G.G.

Boyce, \"Corpse, Disposal of, in Zoroastrianism\", Encyclopaedia Iranica 6, 1993, pp. 279-286; for animal sacrifice, see A. de Jong, \"Animal Sacrifice in Ancient Zoroastrianism: A Ritual and its Interpre-tations\", Sacrifice in Religious Experience, ed. A.I. Baumgarten (Studies in the History of Religions 93; Leiden, 2002), pp. 127-148. 19 This situation is likely to change in the future, with the publication of the third volume of the Nerangestän by F.M. Kotwal and Ph.G. Kreyenbroek, as well as in sev-eral of the contributions offered to the present volume. 20 The best work we have in this respect is probably Almut Hintze's contribution to the present volume. 21 The standard reference work on these priestly rituals still is J.J. Modi, The Reli-gious Ceremonies and Customs of the Parsees (Bombay, 19372), which will hopefully one day be replaced and updated by Dastur Kotwal and Professor J.K. Choksy. 22 The focus of the present contribution is firmly on pre-modern Zoroastrian tradi-tions, although these can never be wholly separated from modern varieties of Zoroas-trianism. Even though it is written in the present tense, these statements should be taken to reflect the situation of pre-modern Zoroastrianism and do not necessarily represent the ritual reality of modern Zoroastrians. 23 Traces of the religious lives of lay Zoroastrians are certainly to be found in reports on the religion of the Persians in Greek and Latin literature (for which, see A. de Jong, Traditions of the Magi.

Here again, it would seem to be unwise to discard the very rich ritual life of contemporary Zoroastrians, focussing especially on the Gähämbär and family rituals, as a late phenomenon, but it is very diffi-cult to reconstruct the history of Zoroastrian dress, family customs, the preparation of certain foods or the distribution and use of the large num-ber of symbolic objects-mirrors, flowers and herbs, sweets, etc.-which are characteristic but very different in both the Parsi and the Irani Zoro-astrian communities.24 The virtual exclusion of lay Zoroastrians from participation in the rit-ual life that is believed to sustain the world and the religion, would al-most naturally lead to the development of special and meaningful lay rituals. This, at least, is what emerges from the study of most other relig-ions and there is no reason to suspect that Zoroastrianism would in any way be different. In her brilliant study of the religious lives of elderly Kurdish Jewish women in Jerusalem, for instance, Susan Sered has shown how such a process might work.25 These women are illiterate and are excluded by convention and by their gender from participating in central aspects of Judaism: the study of Torah and the gatherings in the synagogue. At the same time, their activities—whatever it is they are do-ing, mainly house-keeping, visiting a day centre and visiting tombs of Jewish saints, graves of soldiers, and other symbolic places in the state of Israel—are all very religious. That is to say, these women assign spe-cial religious significance to activities that the men observing them or even their children do not consider overly religious: food preparation, Graeco-Roman World 133; Leiden, 1997), as well as in Christian texts from the Sa-sanian period, chiefly in Syriac and Armenian. 24 For non-priestly aspects of Parsi Zoroastrianism, see Ph.G. Kreyenbroek/Sh. Mun-shi, Living Zoroastrianism. Urban Parsis speak about their Religion (Richmond, 2001 ). A very rich source of information on all subjects mentioned (clothing, food, private rituals, etc.) is Ph.J. Godrej/F. Punthakey Mistree (eds), A Zoroastrian Tapestry.

To give an example, Yom Kippur, the holiest or most solemn day of the Jewish year, a day of fasting spent by them and by their husbands in synagogue, does not have a great religious significance for these women, whereas Pesach, which is much more family-based and has a very extensive repertoire of house-cleaning and the preparation of special types of food, is the centre of their year. Sered makes a strong case for the re-recognition of the con-cept of \"domestic religion\" in order to explain the religious lives of these women and largely follows Robert Redfield's model of a \"great tradi-tion\" and a \"little tradition\" within Judaism: the simultaneous existence of various separate but interlocking repertoires of religious beliefs and practices. If it is possible to reconstruct meaningful layers of religious beliefs and practices in the lives of groups that enjoy less social prestige than the group responsible for the \"normative\" variety of a religion—the vari-ety that is often considered to be \"real\" embodiment of a traditon—it seems reasonable to at least ask the question if such a special repertoire of beliefs and practices could also have existed among groups who oc-cupy the highest positions in social stratifications. For Sasanian society, that would mean that we could ask the question whether court ceremo-nial and court etiquette can fruitfully be analysed as a special branch of Zoroastrian rituals.26 Sasanian court rituals have rarely been taken seri-ously as Zoroastrian rituals but in a sense they are. That is to say, the Sa-sanian monarchs were Zoroastrians and the ritual life at court must have expressed this religious identity, or at least cannot have clashed with it too overtly. Much can be gained, it seems, if we try to understand Sa-sanian court rituals as a valid expression of a highly specialised segment of a Zoroastrian society. The first thing that can be noted at the Sasanian court is the relatively humble position of the chief representatives of Zoroastrianism as a relig-ion: the priests.27 They are there, of course, but they do not perform the 26 The obvious comparison to be made is with Byzantine court culture, which is gen-erally held to have reflected and strengthened the Christian identity of the Byzantine Empire in a very strong way.

These rituals are known in great detail, but it is very difficult—if not impossible-to devise a chronological patterning of court culture. Many Arabic and Persian authors attribute the most important aspects of Sa-sanian court culture to the earliest Sasanian monarchs, Ardasïr and Säpür. Most modem scholars believe that they can only refer to the Sa-sanian Empire of the sixth century.28 There is an enormous amount of work to be done in this respect and the remarks in the present contribu-tion should only count as being very provisional. Some of the more thomy questions pertaining to Sasanian Iran will not be addressed here, especially the problem of feudalism.29 More dramatically, perhaps, the most extensive work done on the subject, the work of Geo Widengren, will be ignored in the present contribution. It focuses heavily on a dragon-slaying drought-defeating New Year king in the capital of the empire, whom the present author considers to have been a scholarly myth, at least for Sasanian Iran.30 The question of origins, finally, will only be assessed here very briefly, but it must at least be mentioned. Sa-sanian court ceremony bears an uncannily close resemblance to Byzan-tine court ceremony and even closer, perhaps, to the court life of the 'Abbäsid caliphs in Baghdad. It is held almost axiomatically in modem movement in the late fifth and early sixth century, priests are much more conspicuous than in earlier periods. 28 For a good introduction to these problems, see Z. Rubin, \"The Reforms of Khusro Anüshirwän\", The Byzantine and Early Islamic Near East 3. States, Resources and Armies, ed. A. Cameron (Studies in Late Antiquity and Early Islam; Princeton, 1985), pp. 227-297. 29 Feudalism as a heuristic instrument of historical research has come under attack even for the societies that were thought to have invented it, the Western European king-doms in the Middle Ages. See M. Reynolds, Fiefs and Vassals. The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted (Oxford, 1994). For Sasanian Iran, the concept has been used very enthu-siastically by F. Altheim/R. Stiehl, Ein asiatischer Staat. Feudalismus unter den Sasa-niden und ihren Nachbarn (Wiesbaden, 1954), and by G. Widengren, Der Feudalismus im alten Iran (Köln, 1969). Their interpretations of Sasanian society seem bizarre at the moment. For cautious remarks on the subject, see M. Zakeri, Sâsânid Soldiers in Early Muslim Society. The Origins of Ayyârân and Futuwwa (Wiesbaden, 1995), pp. 13-22. 30 Summaries of Widengren's ideas are to be found in G.

In the case of the 'Abbäsids, this is extremely likely and it is done even self-consciously.31 In the case of the Byzan-tines, it is less likely, but certainly not impossible. It is important, how-ever, to stress one fact: the Sasanians did not design or devise these ritu-als. Several key aspects of them are, in fact, much older and seem to de-rive ultimately from the rituals governing the life of the god in his temple and the life of the king in his palaces in the cities of ancient Mesopota-mia.32 Such key elements as the use of a curtain to separate the king from his audience and to create a special epiphany by drawing it away; the arrangements of thrones and stools for relatives, equals, and intimates; and the set order of meals, beverages, and fragrances offered to the king can be traced back several millennia. As interesting as the high antiquity of several of the ceremonies may be, however, it cannot really contribute much to a proper understanding of their meaning in Sasanian Iran. We shall look at some of the rules and rituals at court in detail and then try to make some sense of them. For practical purposes, a single text has been chosen as the most important witness: the celebrated Kitäb al-täj, or \"Book of the Crown\", attributed (falsely) to the famous ninth-century Arabic author al-Jähiz.33 The amount of additional information 31 Much information can be found in A. Al-Azmeh, Muslim Kingship. Powerand the Sacred in Muslim, Christian, and Pagan Polities (London, 1997). L. Marlow, Hierar-chy and Egalitarianism in Islamic Thought (Cambridge, 1997), pp. 66-90 gives a fasci-nating interpretation of some of the most important underlying intellectual trends. 32 J. Bottéro, Religion in Ancient Mesopotamia (Chicago, 2001), pp. 114-170, is a highly readable introduction with a strong focus on the temple cult. See also A.L. Op-penheim, Ancient Mesopotamia.

Panaino, \"The Mesopotamian Heritage of Achaemenian Kingship\", The Heirs of Assyria, eds S. Aro/R.M.

A convenient translation with a good introduc-tion can be found in C. Pellat, Le livre de la couronne (Paris, 1954; henceforth LC), who shows that the book must have been written by an Iranian, whose knowledge of Persian culture was vastly greater than the elegance of his Arabic.

The body of a king had to be intact. Deformations, missing body parts, blindness and failing mental capacities automatically disqualified a person for becoming king. This opened the way, as one can imagine, for maiming and especially blinding potential rivals, thus barring them from any claim to the throne. These procedures are mentioned with great regu-larity.34 As long as he was mentally and physically unobjectionable, eve-rything else about the king and his body could be helped. For public oc-casions, occurring daily as far as we know, but especially for larger or more important public appearances, the king's body was perfumed, his face was covered in make-up, his beard was gilded and his body was clothed with vestments shining with gold and jewels. His head was cov-ered with a diadem and more elaborate headgear, leaving only knotted tresses of hair floating freely or tied with coloured ribbons.35 The horse of the king was by definition the finest horse around and those who ac-companied the king had to make sure that their horse was no match for the king's, and also that it would neither whinny nor urinate.36 The whereabouts of the king at night were unknown. No one was allowed to know where the king would sleep. Several authors mention the fact that the king had forty bedrooms and chose one at random; he often ended up sleeping in none of them, but falling asleep on a chair, using his arm for a pillow.37 The most detailed rules governed public and private audiences in the palace. These are the occasions where the curtain comes in. The king would be seated on a bench with three pillows, wearing his costly gar-34 See the comments of C.E.

At some occasions, the curtain could suddenly be drawn away. This seems to have happened at the largest type of public audiences, involving not only the courtiers themselves, but also many others drawn to the palace from among the common people. On many occasions, however, the king remained hidden from sight be-hind his curtain, eating alone until the moment came for laughter and enjoyment. At that moment, the king summoned the keeper of the cur-tain, xurram-bäs,39 and gave him instructions: such and such a song must be played or jokes must be told. While the king was conferring with the xurram-bäs, no one was allowed to speak. During the laughter, music and general merriment, the king would drink wine and receive written requests from the courtiers and assess those. Those who tried to take advantage of the king's inebriated status would eventually be pun-ished.40 The court knew a very strict, but never very stable hierarchy ex-pressed in sitting arrangements: princes of the blood, high priests, mili-tary leaders, fellow kings and emperors all had their assigned places in the audience hall. They sat at specified distances from the curtain. Inter-estingly enough, a place of considerable honour was reserved for jesters and musicians, who also performed an important role in the daily gather-ings. Generally, of course, one can say that Zoroastrianism values happi-ness and laughter and merriment. We know so little about music in Zo-38 For these matters (with the relevant references to the plaster copy of this type of crown with chain that was found in the Umayyad palace in Khirbat al-Mafjar), see Sh.

The bench with the three pillows is most famously illustrated on the Sasanian engraved rock crystal that is the centre of the so-called \"Cup of Solomon\" from the treasury of the abbey of Saint-Denis, currently in the Cabinet des Médailles in Paris. 39 This is a problematic title. It seems to be proper Persian and means \"be happy.\" If the title is genuine (it has not been preserved in Middle Persian), it must derive from the words spoken by this official to introduce people to the king. Such phrases are extant only in Arabic, but the one given by pseudo-Jähiz is not an invitation to be happy or at ease, but one to hold one's tongue (KT 28; LC 56). The prescribed formula for greeting the king is much better attested. It consisted chiefly of the wish \"May you be immortal!\" (Middle Persian anôsag bawëd). 40 KT 28-29; LC 56-57."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"roastrian history, however, that it is difficult to assess the importance of musicians at the royal court. One thing is clear: the presence of jesters, clowns and musicians signalled the stability and prosperity of the Em-pire.41 When all was quiet in the Empire; when there were no wars along its long and indefensible borders; and when there were no heretics threatening to disrupt everything, jesters would perform their tricks and singers would sing their songs. In cases of adversity, however, they were banned from the audience hall, together with the tables and stools, thrones and most of the courtiers. Only a select number of people re-mained, sharing a single table next to the king, on which there would be bread, salt, vinegar and vegetables only. Meals were sober and there was no time for merriment. When the affair had been settled, court life would resume as usual.42 Many more details could be added, but it is perhaps more interesting to ask some pertinent questions and see where all this is leading. We shall encounter more antiquarian details as we survey the field. As any-one who has ever worked on these materials will realise, the life at court clearly is the reflection of an image of society. In various gatherings and ritual institutions, the classes of society, the religious communities of the Empire, as well as representatives from outside the Empire—ambas-sadors and spies—were all represented and recognised at the Empire's centre. At the two main festivals of the year, Nowrûz and Mihragän, the ties that bound the various groups and communities to the king were re-established in a very intricate display of exchanging gifts. Since the king was the undisputed centre of the system, his central and unique position was constantly given shape. Literally everything that pertained to the king was different: his perfumes, his dress, the way he wore his hair, the presence or absence of diadem, turban, or crown, where he would sleep or sit or eat. When the king spoke or ate, no one was allowed to speak; when the king moved his hand towards his plate, no one was allowed to approach his plate any longer; when the king took a bite of food, no one was allowed to chew. When the king was bled or used medicine, no one was allowed to do so. Most of these examples are from the Kitäb al-täj, a text that is literally obsessed with this notion of 41 The combination of kings and clowns inevitably brings to memory the breathtaking study of D.D. Shulman, The King and the Clown in South Indian Myth and Poetry (Princeton, 1985), which is a most valuable study, particularly because it shows that court rituals can be developed in very unexpected religious directions. 42 KT 173-174; LC 190-191."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"the display of royal difference. The required characteristics of the king also found many external shapes: his manliness and strength were underscored by his hunting trips and sports competitions. His being in control of the Empire was made manifest in his ability to enjoy music, wine, and laughter. His patronage of Zoroastrianism is evident from endowments made to important fires, the sponsoring of festivals and other religious institutions. His most im-portant role as guarantor and dispenser of justice found a well-known ritual form in the greatest of the public audiences, those associated with Nowrüz and Mihragän, during which—at least in theory—every single inhabitant of the Empire could come forward and demand justice. Pseudo-Jähiz as a very interesting description of such a public audi-ence, which one may suspect to have been an engineered ritual begin-ning of such ceremonies. He says that during the public audiences of Nowrüz and Mihragän, complaints against the king took precedence: they were heard first. Such complaints as there were were gathered. The king would summon the Grand Mowbed, the Grand Secretary and the Chief of the Fire-Priests—whoever he may be—and a herald shouted: \"Let he who has a complaint against the King come forward!\" At that moment, when the complainants came forward, the king would kneel before the Grand Mowbed, among his accusers, and give a lengthy speech. In this speech, he outlined that the greatest evil of all is to be found in an unjust king. The Grand Mowbed would hear the case and examine it. If the complaint was found to be just, the king had to make amends. If not, the complainant was arrested, punished for all to see and thrown into jail. When the complaints against the king were finished, he would rise, praise God, put on his crown, sit on the throne and explain to his intimates that in the King's justice, the most intimate friend and the most unknown subject, the weakest and the strongest were all equal.43 In reality, one would have to believe that it would be extremely hazardous for anyone to bring forward a complaint against the king, and very unlikely that his main priest, the mowbedän mowbed, would ever rule against him. The text of pseudo-Jähiz strongly suggests that the accusa-tions against the king, their treatment by the Grand Mowbed, and their settlement were carefully doctored and that these accusations were, in fact, a ritual manifestation of the king's justice. 43 KT 159-163; LC 179-182."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"Where the social, political, and economic aspects of these rituals are fairly clear, in the sense that we can understand how they work—and they seem to have worked very well—the ideological and religious as-pects of the rituals are much less clear. Obviously, the easiest solution would be to say that there are no religious aspects, that they are all secu-lar rituals. This, however, does not seem to be the case, but it is by no means easy to assess the relations between these rituals and the religious traditions of Zoroastrianism. The argument presented here will, there-fore, be rather schematic, but hopefully, it will be clear. There is a definite tension between the Zoroastrian idea that every man and every woman can equally contribute to the common goal, the maintenance of the religion and the battle against evil, and the very unique position of the king.44 The system of monarchy requires that the king must not be entirely like his subjects. The stricture ofZoroastrian-ism on this requirement is that he cannot be entirely unlike his subject, that is to say, he cannot be a god. These, it seems, are the boundaries that are constantly being negotiated and probably one of the main reasons why the ritual worked. There is massive evidence in Zoroastrian tradi-tions for the practice of associating people very closely with the gods. There is no evidence whatsoever of people actually turning into gods.45 The ninth-century theologian Zâdspram can mention theyazadän-cihrih or \"divine nature\" of Zarathustra without any problems and the Sasanian kings an use almost the same words to claim their divine rights to the throne, because no contemporary would ever assume that they had in that sense crossed the line between what is normal—attempting to em-44 For the much-discussed \"religious equality\" of all men and women, see A. de Jong, \"Jeh the Primal Whore?

Their reliability, however, appears to be heavily compromised by discussions on proper religious behaviour with regard to the king in their own religious tradi-tions, Christianity and Islam.48 46 For Zädspram, see Wizîdagïhà îZâdspram 12.9 in Ph.Gignoux/A. Tafazzoli, An-thologie de Zâdspram (Studia Iranica Cahier 13; Paris, 1993), ad locum. The Sasanian kings, in the early inscriptions, refer to themselves with the words kë cihr azyazadân, \"whose origin/essence/nature is of the gods.\" These words have been discussed very often and there seems to be a general consensus that they do not present the kings as gods, but lay a claim to the divine rights of the kings to their throne. Most references to recent discussions, but disappointingly little in terms of interpretation, can be found in Ph.

Sundermann, \"Kë cihr az yazdän. Zur Titulatur der Sasanidenkönige\", Archiv Orientälni 56, 1988, pp. 338-340. Much the same should be said about the prac-tice of reserving the title bay (\"Lord\") for the kings. There is no doubt that the word can also mean \"god\", but it seems to have acquired the more general meaning of \"lord\" in a comparatively early period. See, for instance, R.N. Frye, \"Gestures of Deference to Royalty in Ancient Iran\", Iranica Antiqua 9, 1972, pp. 102-107; M. Boyce, \"Varuna the Baga\", Monumentum Georg Morgenstierne I (Acta Iranica 21 ; Leiden, 1981), pp. 59-73. Huyse's decision to retain the meaning \"god\", because Iranians would always have known the \"original\" meaning of the word is logically obscure. 47 For this episode, see the Pahlavi Riväyat 31, in A.V.

The chief complaint of most authors against those kings, who went out of favour, is that they could not live up to their function, but allowed personal feelings and ideas to influence the affairs of the realm. The most notorious example is the universally hated king Yazdegerd I. This king, who earned the epithet \"the Sinner\" (bazakkar) in the Sasanian tradition, is also said-not surprisingly-to have introduced fundamental changes in the most important royal ritual, the public audiences at Nowrûz and Mihragän.49 He is characterised by al-Tabari as follows: [H]e was rough and harsh and possessed many defects. One of the worst and most serious of these last, it is said, was that he did not use his keenness of intellect, his good education, and the wide-ranging varieties of knowl-edge he had thoroughly mastered in their proper place, and also his exten-sive delving into harmful things and his use of all the powers he possessed for deceiving people, using his sharpness, wiles, and trickery - all this to-gether with his keen mind, which had a propensity toward evil-doing, and his intense enjoyment in employing these faculties of his.\"50 Here too, there seems to be an opening for an important distinction: the office of the king has clear religious implications and meanings, but these do not pertain to the king as person. It is a strange fact that there are no kings in heaven. We know of several legendary and historical men, who travelled to the hereafter in this life: Ardä Wiräz, KerdTr, king Wistäsp, the patron of Zarathustra, and Zarathustra himself. None of them ever men-tions meeting or seeing a \"king\" (Middle Persian säh) in heaven.51 Ardä Wiräz sees sovereigns and rulers in heaven, but the title \"king\" is con-spicuously absent from his account.52 It would seem, therefore, that king-ship is an office left behind when the king dies, because as on earth, there can only be one king in heaven and that is Ohrmazd.53 Heaven, certainly in the Book of Ardâ Wïrâz, is described as a palace, with Ohrmazd as king and his fellow gods as his intimate courtiers; with the same organisation of gifts and displays of sovereignty.

The dramatic language and performance of hiding and revealing forms an important part of court ritual. Certainly, the large audiences, with the king dressed in gold and jewels, sitting under the crown on his bench, holding a sceptre, in a magnificent giant hall that was painted, decorated with mosaics and gold revealing cosmic symbols, would in the eyes of many almost reveal the king to be a god. But the \"almost\" is important here. Man can neither be nor create a god. In his breathtaking analysis of the \"construction\" of religious images in Graeco-Roman antiquity, Rich-ard Gordon has suggested how subtly ancient Greeks and Romans could \"gamble with the impermissible\", by at once asserting and denying that statues or painted figures are alive: \"'Living' is broken down into its de-notations: breath, sight, feelings, movement, skin-sheen, facial expres-sion. So far as one or two of these denotations may be taken as 'suffi-cient' evidence of 'life', the images live. But the whole inventory is never present, and the attempt to pass into the realm of the impermissible always fails.\"54 Something similar seems to apply to Sasanian (and other) court rituals. Zoroastrians believed that piety and justice could manifest themselves in persons. One of the ways in which they could do that is, simply, success.5\"^ The display of the king in the grand audiences cer-tainly presents the king as a cosmic ruler, but it would always be possi-ble—and we indeed find this—that the wealth and good looks of the monarch are presented not to paint him as a semi-divine being, but as the chief model of piety and justice, the accomplishment of mankind. This leads to a central problem: the notion ofxwarrah or \"divine glory.\" This notion has been discussed extensively and is often thought to have been the single most important aspect of Iranian kingship, from its incep-tion up to and including the rise of the 'Abbäsids.56 Every animal in Sa-54 R.L.

The fact is, that xwarrah is almost entirely ab-sent from royal inscriptions. There are a few exceptions: in the inscription of king Narseh (r. 293-301) in Paikuli, the (less than fortunate) king is urged by one of his supporters to bring back the Glory and the realm and his throne and honour that used to belong to his ancestors. On the coins of some late Sasanian monarchs, moreover, we find the legend GDH 'pzwt {xwarrah abzüd), which could mean \"Glory has increased.\"58 The coins offer a real problem; especially the late occurrence of the legend may illus-trate the increasing importance of the concept of xwarrah in Sasanian royal ideology. It is important, however, to stress that in the Paikuli inscription the king does not claim to possess xwarrah, but is urged to reclaim it by a second party. On the coins, the phrase can mean many things, but the most natural interpretation of the phrase appears to be that Glory has increased in the realm, not that it attaches in any special way to the king. In similar cases, the possession of xwarrah is quite commonly attrib-uted to the king: the Sasanian dynastic history almost routinely ascribes possession of xwarrah to the ruling monarch. Obviously, the dreams and portents in the Kârnâmag TArdaxsïr ïPâbagân—images of radiance and the appearance of the royal Glory in animal shapes—fulfil this func-tion.39 In the Islamic traditions on the Sasanian kings, the concept is ubiquitous. We have no textual evidence, however, to suggest that the Sasanian kings claimed xwarrah for themselves. 57 I may perhaps be forgiven for referring to only one book, precisely because it is such a remarkably good book. J. Kroger, Sasanidischer Stuckdekor (Baghdader Mitteilungen 5; Mainz, 1982) contains an admirable discussion of the relations between art and religion in Sasanian Iran, on pp. 264-276. Throughout the book, one finds references to the ram, birds, hunting and the body of the king, all interpreted in terms of xwarrah. 58 For the inscription of Narseh, see P.O. Skjaerv0, The Sassanian Inscription of Pai-kuli 3.1 Restored Text and Translation (Wiesbaden, 1983), § 18 on pp. 34-35; and P.O. Skjecrv0, The Sassanian Inscription of Paikuli 3.2.

The no-tion does not seem to have been exploited widely—at least not overtly— in royal ritual, royal art or royal ideology. If this is found to be true, one can suggest only one likely background to this fact: xwarrah is this mys-terious element bestowed by the gods, which one can never presume to possess oneself. That would be the closest one could get to a Zoroastrian parallel to the Greek notion of hybris. Others are necessarily the judges of one's possession of xwarrah. To claim xwarrah for oneself is a dan-gerous presumption, but there is an even more important danger: that others would believe that the king could actually dispense some of his xwarrah. That, I would suggest, would be the breaking point at which the borders that cannot be crossed, between man and god, would have been crossed. There are, of course, examples in the Islamic world, for instance, and in medieval Western Europe, of the king dispensing ba-raka, blessing and healing, but there are no indications of similar beliefs in Sasanian Iran—where the king dispenses justice only—and they are in fact unlikely to have existed. It has become fashionable in some circles to see or present religion, art, and statehood as symbolic languages or taxonomies of power.60 While we may not all be as fashionable as that, it would seem that such a perspective could enable us to reconstruct the intricate ways in which these three symbolic languages interacted and influenced each other. That is a vast project, which cannot be dissolved into ready-made cate-gories or concepts,61 but which will ultimately enable us to gain a better understanding of the complex and uneasy relations between religion and court in a Zoroastrian empire.62 60 Gordon, \"The Real and the Imaginary\", passim. 61 Much can be gained if we abandon questions such as \"Did the Sasanian practise 'divine kingship' or 'sacral kingship'?\" although one can easily admire the learning evident from J.K.

Functions, contexts and details of the ritual itself are incompletely known, and the religious ritual community meal appears in the sources of Iranian religion as a some-what diffuse phenomenon. Seen in a comparative perspective, community meals are essential to the ritual repertory of many religions. In the ancient cultures of Europe, the Mediterranean area and western Asia sacrificial meals with a com-munal character were a prominent feature of the ritual order, and some religions like Christianity, Mithraism and Manichaeism2 developed new and specific forms of ritual community meals. The main purpose of the present study is the search for practices in ancient Iranian religion that correspond to the category of ritual commu-nal meals, and to elucidate, if possible, their enactment and meaning. 1. THE CONCEPT OF RELIGIOUS RITUAL COMMUNITY MEALS The type of rituals indicated by the term 'religious ritual community meals' needs to be discussed in more detail. To begin with, meals can be ritualized in the way that the distribution and partaking of food and drink 1 Cf. C. Herrenschmidt/J. Kellens, \"La question du rituel dans le mazdéisme ancien et achéménide\", Archives de Sciences sociales des Religions 85, 1994, pp. 45-67, pp. 45 and 56.

Skja;rv0 (Costa Mesa, 2000), pp. 99-112. 2 The literature pertaining to the Christian holy communion is immense, and readers are referred to the special bibliographies. For Mithraism see J.P. Kane, \"The Mithraic cult meal in its Greek and Roman environment\", Mithraic studies, ed. J.R. Hinnells (Manchester, 1975), vol. 2, pp. 313-351, and A.

In Dis-cipline and Ritual (Baltimore/London, 2000)."},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"follows a certain order among the participants of the meal, and that it is accompanied by certain stereotyped behaviours (e.g. sitting or reclining, raising toasts etc) and recurrent verbal utterances (like 'bon appétit' or opening and concluding speeches). In a sense these types of meals are ritual meals but not religious ritual meals which presuppose a religious element. In the cultural area with which we are concerned the term 'reli-gious' is in the first place qualified by references to a suprahuman di-mension, represented predominantly by belief in divine beings. We will also use the term 'cultic community meals' as a synonym to 'religious ritual community meals'. Ritual meals may be performed individually or in groups of varying size. The term 'community meals' does not just refer to meals taken by any group of individuals, but includes also the connotation of common social and religious interests. The composition of the group transcends the domestic and family sphere. Ritual meals may be a pars pro toto performance or constitute a full consummation of food and liquid, and they are usually more or less symbolic in character. Using the term 'meal' in this connection should involve the real partaking of at least a minimum of food and/or drink. The religious elements of ritual communal meals may be more or less prominent and take different expressions. The place of enactment con-tributes to the religious aspect of the meal when it is celebrated in a building or an open space that is used for cultic purposes. Similarly the community meal may be set within the frame of larger ritual complexes or liturgical orders, thus reinforcing its religious character. Ritual com-munity meals may be performed at different occasions and within differ-ent cultic contexts such as sacrifices, initiations, acts of periodic wor-ship, seasonal festivals, and funerals. In many religious traditions ordinary as well as festive meals are in-troduced and/or completed with prayers ('grace before and after the meal'). From one point of view we have to do with ritualized religious meals which also may present the character of community meals (in the sense defined above). One could argue, however, that in this type of meals the acts of eating and drinking, necessary for humans to maintain life, are here the primary concern. They have been set in a religious ritual framework which can be interpreted as a secondary concern, whereas cultic community meals in a strict sense are motivated by and enacted primarily for symbolic and religious concerns."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"As an example to illustrate the above discussion we may use the Christian 'holy communion'. Regardless of its varying modes of expres-sion, the Christian ritual meal appears to be a strongly symbolic, pars pro toto meal, usually performed in a religious building, a 'church' or another type of community locale. It is normally set in the context of a larger liturgical service. As is well known, the enactment and function of the 'holy communion' have changed over the centuries and the meaning given to it by the principal Christian denominations differs clearly. 2. RITUALS AND SETTINGS OF CULTIC COMMUNITY MEALS IN ANCIENT IRANIAN RELIGION With the above discussion in mind, we will now address the question of religious ritual community meals in ancient Iranian religion. In the fol-lowing the qualifying term 'religious' will be omitted, because this is inherent in the object of our study. However, the concept 'ancient Ira-nian religion' is vaguer and needs some delimitation. It includes a wide variety of religious forms and cultural manifestations having their roots in the traditional religion of Iranian-speaking groups or peoples in pre-Islamic (pre-Christian and pre-Buddhist) times. The use of religion in the singular implies that none of the various forms known to us presents such a distinctive character that it can be marked off from the other forms as a religion of its own.3 Historically seen the most important form of ancient Iranian religion is Zoroastrianism or Mazdaism, an historical entity which in its turn gives rise to problems of delimitation. From the methodological point of view there is a difficulty in the fact that the rituals of contemporary Zoroastrians, both in Iran and India, can be observed and studied in great detail. This would seem an advantage for the approach to the study of the rituals in past periods but involves at the same time a dilemma. On the one hand the modern rituals can be as-sumed to have preserved ancient structures and elements, on the other hand they can be shown to have changed in ritual details, in place and 3 From this position it follows that a) Zoroastrianism/Mazdaism cannot clearly be dis-tinguished from such supposed categories as Iranian 'paganism' or pre-Zoroastrian re-ligion b) Manichaeism is a religion of its own and c) the evidence is insufficient to jus-tify the use of religions (in the plural) referring to ancient Iran if not the presence of Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity within that geographical area is intended. For a discus-sion of different approaches to the study of Zoroastrianism/Mazdaism, see M. Staus-berg, Die Religion Zarathushtras.

In addition the present terms used to denote rituals or parts of them differ often among Irani and Parsi Zoroastrians, and some ritual concepts, like Pahlavi wäz (wäj), \"word, formula\", New Persian bäj, have developed new meanings.4 The Avestan draonah- \"portion owned\" denotes in the Pahlavi texts (in the Middle Iranian form drön) both the consecrated breads and the cere-mony in which they are offered. Moreover, changes may be expected to occur more frequently in rituals with a looser structure. We will thus have to rely on sources pertaining to the Sassanian and earlier periods, the Avesta, Graeco-Roman writers, the bulk of the Pahlavi texts and information drawn from Arabic writers, in the first place Albi-runi. In some cases references to later ritual practice are useful, however. In the Indo-Iranian tradition the sacrificial rituals were as a rule per-formed by the priests on behalf of individuals or the community.5 For that service they expected to have their reward (Old.Ir. mïzda-, Skr. mïdhà-). The key function of the Iranian priests for performing a sacri-fice was noted by Herodotus (1,132) who states that for the Persians it is not customary (or lawful; ου σφι ν-όμος έστί) to sacrifice without a priest (μάγος). Once the priority of the priests in sacrificial matters had become undisputed the position and the privileges of the priestly class were reinforced and the ritual role of the non-priestly elite and the com-mon people was gradually reduced. Records of classical authors, e. g. Strabo and Pausanias, focus on the role of the priests, and pay little at-tention to the ritual activity of the non-priestly worshippers. The cultic community meal which presumably took place in connec-tion with animal sacrifices in ancient Iran seems largely to have gone unnoticed in the sources that have come down to us. The liturgical texts were preserved by religious specialists, the priests, who might have been less interested in transmitting the type of ritual ceremonies represented by cultic community meals. In the absence of any ancient source describ-ing the complete performance of a cultic community meal, we have first to identify and analyze known ritual texts which indicate the enactment of such community meals. Secondly we shall look for the broader set-tings in which rituals with communal meals were used. 4 Cf. M. Boyce/F. Kotwal, \"Zoroastrian Baj and Dron\", Bulletin of the School of Ori-ental and African Studies 34, 1971, 1, pp. 56-73 and 2, pp. 298-313, esp. 57-67. 5 Cf. the general remarks of M.

(Bombay, 1937, reprint 1995), pp. 281 and 305-306, can be interpreted in the way that the eating of the consecrated bread by members of the community in his time took place during the yas/îa-ceremony directly after the consecration of the drön but outside the \"Yazashna-gâh\". J. Duchesne-Guillemin, The Religion of ancient Iran (Bombay, 1973), p. 58 and presumably his translator Jamasp Asa, state that \"During chapter 8, the därun is eaten by the zöt and, after the ceremony, by those members of the congregation who wish to partake of it\". I take this statement to mean \"after the yasna-ceremony\". Analogous information is presented by Lady Drower who visited India in the 1940s. E.S. Drower, Water into Wine. A Study of Ritual Idiom in the Middle East (London, 1956). She states that at the conclusion of the service, \"the räspi or other priests in the sacred area may partake of the därüns if they wish.\" Having seen only a rehearsal she goes on to say that \"no communicants were present\" but she was told that at the conclusion of the bäj-prayer pieces of the bread were \"passed out of the sacred area and consumed by such of the laity as consider themselves worthy\" (p. 214).

How far this custom dates back in time cannot be determined with certainty. It may well be, however that in the Sassanian and earlier periods the partaking of the drön (and also the höm -drink?) by others than the priests had the more distinct appearance of a ritualized community meal. Actually there are indications in the Yasna text of chapter 8 that suggest a ritual consump-tion of the offerings, the miiazda-, not only by the officiating priests but also by others present at the cult act.8 An exhortation to partake of the offerings addressed, as it seems, to non-priestly participants is recited by the sacrificial priest(s) in Yasna 8, § 2: xvarata narö aëtqm miiazddm ... \"eat, ο men, this offering\". In the following paragraphs (§ 3 and 4), which have a parallel in the Nërangestân 71,9 two categories of Mazdâ-worshippers are mentioned who commit ritual transgressions. The first category (§ 3) includes every one who in the ceremony \"destroys the world of Truth through sorcery\", although he declares himself to be a Mazdâ-worshipper and adherent of Asa: mazdaiiasnö aojanö asahe räOma jïstaiiamnô γάθβα gaëOâα Sähe mardyante. The term yätu- indi-cates here probably deviating ritual practices. The second category (§ 4) refers to a person among the adult worshippers present in the ceremony being summoned to recite some ritual formulas (väcö) but who refuses to do so; he will be punished on account of sorcery: yasca aëtaSqm mazdai-iasnanqm pdranäiiunqm aißi.züzuiianqm imq väcö nôitvïsaitiframrûite aëtqm ä yätumanahe jasaiti. These passages (Y. 8, §§ 2-4) are of particular interest for their ref-erences to the enactment of a ritual community meal. The partaking of the offerings by the worshippers who are present is explicitly indicated by the exhortation in § 2 but is implicitly also referred to in §§ 3-4 by the use of the deictic pronouns \"the one(s) here\" reinforced once by the locatif: yö aëSuua mazdaiiasnaësuua (§ 3), further yasca aëtaësqm maz-daiiasnanqm ... imq väcö in § 4.

Possibly the meal also included the partaking of the haoma drink during the recitation of Yasna 9-10. Thtyasna was presumably used in different contexts and at different occasions but its central position in the ritual tradition indicates that it functioned as the main text to be recited during public sacrificial rituals in fire-temples or elsewhere in pre-Islamic times. However, the form of the text, in particular the elements of its composition, that has come down to us in the medieval manuscripts may not correspond to the one used in Sassanian and earlier times. The reports of Iranian sacrificial rituals given by Greek writers em-phasize what appeared striking to them, the worship of fire and the pecu-liar features in the ritual performance of the magi. Cultic community meals, which were well known also to the Greeks, presented a less dis-tinctive character and would not, therefore, attract the same attention. The short accounts of Strabo and Pausanias (1st and 2nd cent. CE respec-tively) are nonetheless crucial for our knowledge of western Iranian ritu-als.10 Most importantly, these authors show the role played by recitation of texts during the enactment of the sacrificial ritual. In his general ac-count of these rituals 11 Strabo asserts that the magi make their invoca-tions for a long time (πολύν χρόνον). In describing the fire temples (πυ-ραιθεΐα) of Cappadocia and their altars with ever burning fire, Strabo states having seen that the magi enter daily and make invocations for about an hour (έπάδουσι ώραν σχεδόν τι) holding before the fire their bundle of rods (Geography XV,3,15). Similarly, when visiting the Per-sian sanctuaries in the cities of Hierokaisarea and Hypaipea in Lydia Pausanias observes in both places how a Magian priest enters a building (οίκημα ) bringing wood with him which he places on the altar. He puts the cap on his head and then chants invocations of the gods \"in a Barbar-ian language not understandable to Greek ears\", έπίκλησιν ότου δή θεών; έπςχδει βάρβαρα και ουδαμώς συνετά \"Ελλησιν. Pausanias adds that the priest is reciting the invocations from a scroll (έκ βιβ-λίου).12 Both reports are stated to be partly based on the authors' per-10 For a discussion on the main testimonies of the classical authors on Iranian cult practices, see E.

Probably the rituals witnessed by Strabo and Pausanias represent an early form of the yasna ceremony. Details of the sacrificial performance of the magi as recorded by Strabo and Pausanias are confirmed by iconographie evidence from western Asia Minor (Daskyleion) dated to the 5th cent, before CE. Strabo's general description of Persian sacrifices is partly dependant on Herodotus but presents also genuine information which indicates that the sacrificial ritual was concluded by a cultic community meal. Accord-ing to Strabo, the priest who directs the sacrifice (probably an allusion to the zaotar-) divides the meat and those who have got their shares go away (άττίασι διελόμενοι) without granting a portion to the gods. The informants of Strabo explain this practice by referring to the idea that the gods want the soul of the victims but nothing else (Geography XV,3,13).This appears to be in accordance with ancient Iranian ideas on sacrifice.13 Behind the remark of Strabo we may imagine a situation in which the sacrifiers receive back their shares and \"go away\" to consume them in a common sacrificial meal. The Nerangestän confirms the im-portance of animal sacrifices and supplies ritual details to the accounts of Strabo and Pausanias. A cultic community meal is alluded to in several passages of the Nerangestän. Drinking the lawful shares of the sacrificial libations (däitiia draonâxvarô maôaitè) does not imply a transgression even if one gets drunk and fails to recite the cult hymns (ch. 11-12).14 The food-offerings (päpiOuua-), consisting mainly of meat, are to be consumed when one gathers around the sacred strew of herbage, yat pairi bardsma hanjasante (Nër. 62). When sacrificing to the divine wa-ters, it is stated that the chief priest (the zaotar-) may eat as the first one from the bovine (gauu-) sacrificed and he is thereby addressing himself to the men and women present (Nër. 71). 2.1.2 drön-rituals The part of the present yasna ceremony which consists of the consecra-tion of bread, the drön proper, together with butter, the gösodäg, i. e. transmission of the Avesta, see for example G.

Additional information maybe gleaned from passages in the Pah-lavi books, in particular Pahlavi Riväyat chapter 58.16 The drön-ritual could be performed individually, by the household or by larger groups. The problem is, however, to know when the compilers or authors refer to the drön-liturgy within the yas« α-ceremony or to drön-ütua\\s outside the yasna.

From several passages in the Pahlavi books it appears that the usöfrit- rituals functioned as a sort of votive-offerings.21 With reference to a written source (gyâg-ë paydäg ku) the compiler of Pahlavi Riväyat states \"that if a man declares: 'if this benefit (nëkîhi) comes to me, I shall make an Ustôfrît offering'...\" (PR 20,1).22 The consecrated offerings were apparently consumed in a ritual meal which in all probablity could be arranged as a community meal. The pas-sage mentions three categories of persons to whom one is not authorized to distribute food and drink in the ceremony. The consecrated offerings that have not been partaken of by potential communicants should be given to the dogs and the birds (PR 20,4). The meaning is that the con-secrated food should be eaten by righteous people; if not, the offerings must be disposed of properly, i. e. one shall give them to righteous crea-tures.23 Pahlavi Riväyat 58,85 enjoins that if one has accepted to perform an usôfrït-rûual, one has also accepted that it be performed with a sacrificial worship and a drön-ceremony: â-syast-ë ud drön padïrift bawëd,24 The termya.fr seems here to denote the rite of an animal sacrifice as is sug-gested by the following statement of sacrificing sheep in one single piece: cë ka göspand pad ëw-kardagîh ul yazëd. 2.1.4 äfrinagän-nYua/^ In scholarly usage Äfrinagän denotes a group of liturgical texts transmit-ted in the Avesta and this meaning is also found in the Pahlavi texts as is shown by phrases like äfrinagän guftan (PR 17a2; 40,5; AWN 3,11).

Fruits (in Parsee terminology myazd) and wine are consecrated in the ritual in which the priests and lay people par-take of these offerings in a ceremonious way.26 The Pahlavi texts some-times enumerate the rituals considered to be particularly important and the occurrence of äfrinagän (in the sense of a ceremony) in such listings besides other rituals indicates its status as an independent ritual in Sas-sanian times (Ardä Wiräz Nämag 1,15 (P.3,1 ed.Vahman). The expres-sion äfrinagän kardan \"to perform the äfrinagän ' (Kärnämag 12) refers in the first place to the ritual. The enactment of a community meal in the äfrinagän ritual is strongly suggested by the contents of the Avestan Äf-rinagän über die Gähänbär (Α. 3).

The periodic festivals celebrated by eastern Iranians are known to a certain extent through the information given by Albiruni.The importance of the sea-sonal festivals, the gähänbär, is emphasized in many Zoroastrian texts. At the mythical level there is the account of Ahreman and Xësm and the three essentials things in the world which is derived from Sassanian reli-gious tradition (andar dën guft ëstëd kü...):1 The demon Xësm rushed before Ahreman and growled (drâyîd) that he would not go into the world because of three things about which he could not do anything at all, the gähänbär, the mëzd and the xwëdôdah. Ahreman gives him ad-vices how to overcome the first two ones.28 If the attendants steal any-25 See Modi, The Religious Ceremonies, pp. 354-384. 26 Modi, The Religious Ceremonies, pp. 368-372 27 The reference to religious tradition is explicit only in Sâyast nê-§âyast. 28 The xwêtôdah cannot be broken after man and wife have had intercourse four times."},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"thing from each other the gähänbär is broken (skast), if they chatter the same happens with the mëzd (Säyast në-Sâyast ch. 18, Pahlavi Riväyat 56, 13-16).29 The negative consequences of not performing a seasonal festival are often stressed (SnS 12,31; 13,29, Dk VIII,29,8; 45,4. PR 15al3).30 On the positive side the merits for those who celebrate a gähänbär are emphasized (PR 16a 1 -3).

The procedure of slaughtering an animal lawfully for the worship of fires, waters and libations in connection with the gähän-bär was dealt with: päjag mädayän abar göspand dädihä pad ëzisn ι ätaxsän, äbän, zôhr, gähänbär mâzdësnân ayärlh räy kustan (7,1). Fur-ther details in the päjag-nask concerned places and times of the festival, the feast assembly, the giving of food and drink for the mëzd, the mo-dalities of preparation and distribution (i. e. of food and drink) and also the benefits that come from generous giving: ud ce abar gähänbär kü än sas gäh, ka kunêd, ka be sazïhëd, hanjaman F gähänbär ud dahisn ï δ mëzd kü ka kunisn tuwân passazag pad ce pay-mânîg be dahisn, ka säzisn ud baxsisn kü-s süd ud nêkîh î wëh dahisnän mënôgîhâ udgëtîgïhâ (7,3; Dresden p. 301 lines 14-17, Madan p. 682).32 There was also information on the tasks of the master of the gähänbär ceremonies, his arranging of the assembly and its religious benefits, as well as useful matters for the mëzd: abar xwëskârïh radpassag sälärih kü-s mâzdësnân az kardan Tgäh udfräz raftan ï δ hanjaman ud ka âgâhënisn kü än han jaman abërtar abar wiräs-tan i ähög padïdan tözisn ΐ winäs ud niyäbagig be däd ΐ tis δ mëzd (7,5; Dresden p. 301 ; Madan p. 682). Choosing the foremost seat at the mëzd (pësgâh mëzd wizïdan) was likewise discussed in the nask (7,6). 29 The different wording in the Pahlavi Riväyat suggests that this version is more of a free summary of the common Sassanian source than the one in Säyast në-Sâyast. 30 References to chapters and paragraphs follow the edition of Williams, The Pahlavi Riväyat. 31 For the text see C.

In stating the merits for those who perform the seasonal festivals, the Pahlavi Riväyat (16a 1-2) distinguishes, as it seems, different mo-ments in the ritual performance of the attendants, \"when one prepares (sâzëd), sacrifices (yâzëd), consumes (xwarëd) and gives (dahêd) gener-ously and sincerely...\". According to Pahlavi Riväyat 58,71-72 there was among Sassanian priests, a discussion on the size and kind of animals to be used in the meat offering (gösudäg) at a gähänbär which probably has a bearing on the cultic community meal. With reference to ancient tradition it is stated that the greatest and best mëzd is that of the seasonal festivals: paydäg kü mëzd än meh ud weh ΐgähänbär (PR 16a4). The Pahlavi term mëzd (from Avestan miiazda-) is crucial for the un-derstanding of the importance attached to ritual community meals. In the Avesta miiazda- denotes in the first place the food-offerings (meat, fruits, com and vegetables) for the sacrifices (cf. Äfrinagän 3,1-6), but seems also to have acquired the sense of \"cultic (community) meal\" in which the food-offerings were redistributed to be consumed by the par-ticipants (e.g. Nërangestân 10.36 and 10.44 ; ed. Waag 72; 81; 83). In the Pahlavi texts mëzd is used to denote the offerings, the cere-mony in which they are offered, and in many cases also the ritual com-munity meal proper.33 A detailed study of the various uses of mëzd in the Pahlavi texts is beyond the scope of the present article, but it seems that the sense \"cultic community meal\" can be established from the phrasing and the context. When the texts speak about \"giving to the mëzd \"(Dk VIII,7), invitation and coming to the mëzd (PR 16b7), or use expressions like \"at the mëzd of a seasonal festival\", the meaning \"sacrificial meal\" is intended. Besides the examples given above we may adduce further pas-sages from the Pahlavi Riväyat and Sâyast në-Sâyast. Referring to au-thoritative tradition {paydäg kü) the Pahlavi Riväyat says that when three men gather for a mëzd, 10 000 frawasis of the righteous come to it, be awis rasënd (PR 16b3). When a good, fine, worthy man who has not been invited (nëxwand ëstëd) to the mëzd arrives at that mëzd they shall receive him (PR 16b7). In Sâyast në-Sâyast 12,19 the phrase pad mëzd î 33 Cf. also B.N. Dhabhar, Pahlavi Yasna and Visperad (Bombay, 1949), Glossary p. 158 \"orig. sacrificial flesh, meat offering: hence sacrificial repast, banquet, festivity, meal\". Further Kotwal/Kreyenbroek, Nërangestân, p. 75, η. 196. The expression mëzd râyënîdan (e. g. AWN 3,11 ; Kärnämag 12) deserves closer study.

PR 45,1) seems too vague."},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"gähänbär seems to denote the community meal taken in connection with a seasonal festival34 and in 13,25 it is said that the passage 9wöi staota-rasca (Y. 41,5) is to be recited for the praise of yazisn and mëzd,35 The frequent mentioning of the mëzd in connection with the seasonal festi-vals includes in all probability references to the ritual community meal. The Frawardlgän36 festival celebrated at the end of the year and re-lated to hamaspaOmaëdaiia-, the last of the six gähänbärs, was dedi-cated to the frauuasi-, semi-divine beings associated with the souls of the ancestors. During the festival the frauuasi- were thought to visit the liv-ing who should welcome them with offerings, as indicated by Yast 13, 49-52. According to Albiruni the Persians put food at the feast of Far-vardajän \"in the halls of the dead and drink on the roofs of the houses, believing that the spirits of their dead during these days come out from their places of reward or punishment\". They also \"fumigate their houses with juniper, that the dead may enjoy its smell\".37 The food offerings to the frauuasi- presumably included also a meal for the living.38 The Frawardlgän customs point to a domestic ritual with a cultic meal which could have assumed the character of a ritual community meal at some occasions. By contrast the Mithrakäna festival presented a strong communal and national character.39 Information on the rituals and customs of Mithra-käna is sparse and comes almost exclusively from Greek sources and Albiruni. There is no explicit mention of community meals but judging from the importance of the festival and some details of the king's ritual 34 Cf. F.

Most festivals mentioned for the Soghdians have names ending with the element -xwära \"food and drink\" which reveals the importance of community meals held at these festivals.41 Albiruni actually refers to such meals in some passages. On the 28th of the month Nausard there is a feast for the magi of Bukhara during which people gather in a fire temple (bët när) in the village Ramus and then, as it seems, continue the cele-bration alternately in each village by coming together in the house of each chieftain where they eat and drink. The day after Nêm-sarda (\"the half of the year\") is a feast called Man ïd(l) xwära when people assem-ble in the fire temples and eat a particular dish prepared from the flour of millet and from butter and sugar. On the first of the month Umri the Xorasmians celebrated a feast called Azdä kand xwär \"eating the bread prepared with fat\". Perhaps this was done in order to remember on that day an episode of their mythic history, if we interpret the wording of Al-biruni as an allusion to the reason for celebrating the festival: On that day they sought protection from the cold, and assembled for the purpose of eating the bread prepared with fat, around the burning fire-grates (Chronology ed. Sachau p. 236, transi, p. 224). Other periodic rituals with probable community meals include royal court rituals and sacrificial ceremonies having a national dimension. In the inscriptions of Säpuhr I from the end of the 3rd cent., daily sacrifices of one lamb, bread and wine are prescribed to be offered in the fire-temples of the kingdom for the immortal soul of the king and his family (Middle Persian text: pad amäh ruwän, Greek version: elç την pveiay ημών).42 These offerings were probably consumed by the officiating priests and other persons present. According to Athenaeus who draws on earlier sources, Persian court rituals included at public festivals a communal meal \"in the great hall\" 40 See for this G. Widengren, Hochgottglaube im alten Iran. Eine religionsphänome-nologische Untersuchung (Uppsala/Leipzig, 1938), pp. 158-163 and de Jong, Trad-itions of the Magi, pp. 257-260. 41 Albiruni mentions five such feasts (Chronology, text pp. 234-235, transi, pp. 221 — 222). 42 Texts in M.

This may well have had the character of a cultic community meal.44 In the Hellenistic kingdom of Commagene the ruling dynasty and ar-istocracy had strong ties with Iranian culture and religion which can be seen among other things in the pantheon where the main deities have both Iranian and Greek names and correspond in character. The worship directed towards the rulers is well known through the impressive remains of cult places denoted Ιεροθέσια like Arsameia at Nymphaios and Nem-rud Dagh. The Greek inscriptions found at these places give detailed in-structions for the establishment of a cult (τιμή) in honour of the dy-nasty.45 At Arsameia (Dörner & Goell inscr. lines 69-73), Antiochos prescribes sacrifices and public gatherings (θυσίας Te και συνόδους) to be performed on the monthly birthdays of his father Mithradates Kal-linikos and himself together with a common feast of the community (μετά κοινής εορτής πολιτών). Further details of the cult that are given in lines 111-141 suggest that we have to do with a ritual commu-nity meal. The priest shall bring rich sacrifices (θυσίας τε πολυτελείς) and perform a common sacrificial feast meal for the garrison and the citizens (κοινήν εύωχίαν έπιτελείτω). The inscription at Nemrud Dagh states that there shall be a two-day yearly festival with large sacri-fices and plentiful feast meals. To celebrate these sacrificial feasts the inhabitants of the kingdom shall come together in the cult places (τεμενά) that are nearest to their respective villages and towns (Ditt. Or. Graec. Inscr.nr 383 lines 90-100). At both places the nomos of the in-scriptions emphasize the richness of food and drink to be offered the people in these community feast meals. The religious ritual character of the banquets is shown by their sacrificial framing and by the remarks that the feasting takes place during holy days (εν ίεραΐς ήμέραις) and that the participants shall serve themselves with the consecrated drinking vessels as long as the community festival is enacted within the sacred 43 Cf. de Jong, Traditions of the Magi, p. 375; for Sassanian court rituals, see also de Jong in this volume. 44 Chronology, text p. 225, transi, p. 212. 45 See W.

With respect to the mixed cultural background of the ruling elite, the question must nevertheless be raised to what extent the sacrifices and the community meal were performed in the Iranian way, and if the officiat-ing priests in Commagene were magi. Antiochus emphasizes that the cult with sacrifices and feasts which he establishes, draws upon the an-cient tradition of both Persians and Greeks, καθ' α παλαιός λόγος Περσών καί'Ελλήνων - έμοΰ γένους ευτυχέστατη ρί£α - παρα-δέδωκε, κοσμήσας, θυσίαις δέ και πανηγύρεσιν (Ditt. Or. Graec. Inscr. no. 383 lines 29-34). Further on, he states, however, that he has instituted priests of Persian lineage (Περσικώι γένει) to serve in the cult with appropriate garments (ibid, lines 71 -72). The explicit ruling that the priests shall officiate \"in Persian clothing\" should in my opinion be interpreted as referring to the ritual appearance of the magi as de-scribed by Strabo and Pausanias and as shown on the Daskyleion relief, with their typical head cap covering the mouth and the barsom twigs in their hand. 2.2.2 Funerary-ceremonies The custom to perform drön-rituals dedicated to Srös during the three days following a person's death is known from the Pahlavi texts. The Pahlavi Vidêvdâd enjoins that the worship should be addressed to Srös during these days, andar an së röz yazisn hamäg än Τ srös kunisn (8,22). In addition, on the third night at dawn three drön-rituals should be per-formed, one dedicated to Rasn and Astäd, one to the Good Wäy (wäy ï weh) and one to the righteous genii (ardä frawahr). The Dädestän ï Dënîg develops the reasons for performing the worship (yazisn) and drön-ritual of Srös during these days, and explains also the purpose of performing separately the three additional c/rörc-rituals DD 27,1 and 29,1 -4); instead of the righteous genii in the Pahlavi Vidêvdâd the third ritual is dedicated to the Glory (snumän ï xwarrah).

On the fourth day, however, a full ritual meal was performed which in all probability had a communal character. The Aogamadaëcâ ritual, which was probably enacted at dawn of the fourth day,47 was apparently concluded by a cultic meal. The liturgy itself addresses at the very end of the ceremony \"those pious ones who have come to this cultmeal (mëzd) and have partaken (bahr grift hënd) of these offerings (mëzd)\"·, the offi-ciant then pronounces blessings over them (§§ 105-108 and 110, ed. JamaspAsa).48 The Vidëvdâd prescribes that on the fourth day the Mazdeans of the house of the deceased may give a cultmeal with offerings of both meat and wine: vasôpascaeta mazdaiiasna ahe nmänahe miiazddm daiOiiäras [Pähl, text precises röz I tasum] gaomantdm maôumantdm (Vidëvdâd 8,22). 2.3 Other settings with ritual meals having a congregational character Daily meals which are set in a religious framework and gather groups beyond the domestic sphere represent undoubtedly one type of ritual communal meals, but its occurrence outside periodic festivals and rites 46 The word t ' pk can be transcribed as täbag and may be connected with the verb täf-tan, täb- \"to heat, to bum\". A noun täbag \"frying pan\" is listed in D.N. MacKenzie, A Concise Pahlavi Dictionary (London, 1986) and attested in Ardä Wiräz Nâmag 94,1. For the phrasing one could compare with the expressions göst poxtag \"cooked meat\" and göst bristag, \"roasted meat\"; both categories are judged proper for the sacrificial ceremony (PR 58,69). Here another quality of the meat is referred to. Β. T. Anklesaria, Pahlavi Vendidad. Bombay 1949, p. 198 f. has tâza and translates \"fresh\". Cf. also D.

The Pahlavi literature offers some examples of cultic meals enacted at particular occasions. The settings may be fic-tional but the accounts nevertheless reflect the way in which a religious ritual meal (be it of communal character or not) was enacted. The com-munal character of the meal is not explicitly brought out in these literary descriptions but they allude to such situations. In the Kärnämag Τ ArdaxsTr there is an account of two brothers, Bur-zag and Burzädur, giving hospitality to the fleeing ArdaxsTr, who pre-sents himself as one of the horsemen of ArdaxsTr. The brothers con-ducted him to a seat befitting his rank; the king was sorrowful and in deep thoughts but the brothers performed the drön-ritual and asked the king to recite the sacred formula, take his meal and not to keep his sor-row and grief: ArdaxsTr was andöhgen büd hamäg handësïd ud awësân drön yast, δ Ar-daxsTr xwäyisn kard kü wäz framäy griftan, xwarisn xwar ud andöh ud tê-mär ma dar (Kärnämag 12).49 They said to him that Ohrmazd and the Amahraspandän would help him in his difficult situation. In considering these words ArdaxsTr was filled with joy, recited the sacred formula and took his meal. Having no wine they brought beer, arranged the food-offerings and performed the Äfri-nagän prayers: ArdaxsTr pad än kë-s mënisn xwas be büd, wäz grift ud xwarisn xward, u-sän mäy në büd, be wasag δ pës äwurd ud mëzd râyënid, äfrinagän kard (Kärnämag 12). A similar account of a ritual meal is found in Ardä Wiräz Nämag 3,11 (P.7 in the edition of Vahman).30 When Ardä returns from the other-world his first request is to eat and the community, who has gathered around him,51 provides food and \"cold water and wine\". Then, it is said, they performed the drön-ceremony and Wiräz recited the sacred formula, ate his meal and arranged the food-offerings, left the sacred formula, praised Ohrmazd and the divine entities and said the Afrinagan prayers: u-sän drön yast ud Wiräz wäz grift ud xwarisn xward ud mëzd râyënTd, 49 Kârnâmak-i Artakhshîr Pâpakân, ed.

REMARKS ON THE STRUCTURE AND MEANING OF IRANIAN RITUAL COMMUNITY MEALS The first point to be noted is that cultic community meals were part of a larger sacrificial ritual. The divine beings were invoked with praise-formulas and sometimes extensive liturgies during which the offerings were handed over to the divine sphere. In this mediating process the sac-rificers, the priests, had an essential role and represented the sacrifiers, on whose behalf the sacrifices were accomplished and who contributed economically to their realization.53 The community meal appears usually as a concluding ritual which in most cases presupposed animal sacri-fices.54 The offerings were by this particular ritual redistributed to the sacrifiers. Its procedure can be assumed to have varied over time and according to different religious milieus. One ritual scheme which is based on literary accounts of ordinary (or feast) meals (setting no. 3 above) can be traced back to the Sassanian period. Roughly this scheme consisted of an introductory wäz in which theyafr ïdrôn (Y. 3-8) was recited and performed including the ritual tasting of the offerings, Mid-dle Iranian câsnîg, followed by the meal proper eaten in silence. The ritual was concluded by a final wäz.55 52 For details, see Boyce and Kotwal, \"Zoroastrian Bäj and Drön\", 2, pp. 299-302. 53 The distinction is roughly that of H. Hubert and M. Mauss, \"Essai sur la nature et la fonction du sacrifice\", L'Année sociologique 1898; English transi, by W.D. Halls (Chicago, 1964). Cf. also A. Hultgârd, \"The Burnt-Offering in Early Jewish Religion\", Gifts to the Gods, eds T. Linders/G.

A Ritual and its Interpretations\", Sacrifice in Religious Experience, ed. A.I. Baumgarten (Studies in the History of Religions 93; Leiden et al., 2002), pp. 127-148. 55 The ritual structure of this type of ifrön-ceremonies is elucidated in more detail in Boyce/Kotwal, \"Zoroastrian Bäj and Drön\", 2, pp. 298-302."},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"Some Avestan texts seem to have been particularly connected with the seasonal festivals (gähänbär) during which they were recited. The Visprad 1 and 2, as well as the Äfrinagän 3, refer to the seasonal divini-ties (yäiriia-) to whom worship is to be directed.56 The recurrent men-tioning in Äfrinagän 3 of offering the miiazda- may point to a role of this text in the ritual community meals at the seasonal festivals. In fact, the Pahlavi Riväyat 17a2 refers to the obligatory recitation of the Äfrinagän in the mëzd-ceremony at the Gähänbärs and some other occasions. As to the interpretation of meaning and purpose of religious ritual community meals in general, we have to start with the individual reli-gious and cultural traditions. Since the epoch-making study of Robertson Smith57 the tendency has prevailed to emphasize the character of sacrifi-cial meals as a communion and sacrament.58 Careful analysis and com-parison may in fact reveal similar ideas of function and purpose, espe-cially when a cultural area as the Mediterranean and western Asian is concerned that presents many common features in religious ideas and practices. Differences also exist, however, and interpretations claiming general validity should be critically considered. The interpretation of the yasna, especially the drön-ceremony (Y. 3— 7), as a sacramental meal has been put forward by some scholars.59 One may find a support for this in the recurrent formula introducing Yasna 3, 7 and 8 in which the food-offering (xvareOa- miiazda-) is equated with the divine entities Haurvatät and Amaratät (in a dvandva compound) and with the Beneficient Cow (gäus huôâ). The passage is however best un-derstood in the way that the sacrificial matter is denoted by the officiant as Haurvatät, Amaratät or Gäus huôâ.60 56 Waag, Nirangistan, p. 114 refers to the Visprad as a liturgy for the seasonal festi-vals. 57 W.

Choksy INTRODUCTION The Zoroastrian ceremonial term stüm (also stum) or s a turn (also satuml in New Persian, occasionally called astam in Gujarati by the Parsis in India) was derived from Avestan staoma- (< Av. stav-, Phi. stüdan, stäy-ïdan, stay-, Pz. stâïdan, N.Pers. sutüdan, sitüdan, cf. Skt. stôm- < IE *st-, *st(d)) \"to praise, to profess.\" This term's presence in the first line of recitation granted the ritual its name: aSäunqm vatjuhïs sürä spdntä frauuaSaiiö staomi \"I praise the good, strong, holy immortal spirits of the righteous (or orderly) ones\" (Yasna 26:1 ; cf. Yasna 6:19 and STröza 2:19 where the phrase, however, ends with yazamaidë \"we venerate\").1 Those words were in keeping with a Gathic passage attributed to the devotional poet or prophet Zarathushtra: yasndm mazdä xsmäuuatö at vä asä staomiiä vacä \"Veneration for one such as you, Ο Mazda, plus words full of praise through order\" (Yasna 33:8).2 This outer ritual action now is commonly referred to as Stüm-nö kardö and the ceremony with consecration of a food offering is termed Stüm-nu bhönu by Parsis. HISTORY The ritual or portions of it may have ancient origins, although this is by no means certain. Theopompus wrote in his History during the fourth century B.C.E., as cited by Athenaeus in the second century C.E., that a table of food would be set for the immortal spirits of Achaemenian 1 Avesta, ed.

In its antique form, the Staomi or Stüm may very well have developed as a separate ritual out of the three night ceremonies for souls of the deceased (which is attested from Sasanian and post-Sasanian times as the Sedös). The Stüm ritual's continued popularity is evidenced for late medieval and premodem times by refer-ences in the Persian Riväyats (composed 1478-1773 C.E.) and the Ra-hbar-i Dîn-i JarOustï(composed by Dastur Erachji Sohrabji Meherjirana in 1869 C.E.), and for modem times by contemporary Indian practice and an equivalent Iranian one.4 THEOLOGICAL MEANINGS The Stüm ritual, like others associated with maintenance of aSa or right-eous order, became integral to the Zoroastrian or Mazdean belief that death is merely a temporary state resulting from Angra Mainyu's drug- or con-fusing evil. In that belief, partially described during medieval times as a primordial covenant, each individual continues to exist after death because his or her uruuan- (Phi. ruwän, P.Gj. ravän) or soul is immortal (Av. an.aosa-, Phi. anösag) and departs the tanü- (Phi. tan) or body upon cor-poreal death (Yasna 26:6, 55:1; Bundahisn 3:13, 23-24).5 So when the 3 W.

After the soul has been tended, the immortal spirit (Av. frauuaSi-, O.Pers .fravarti-, Phi .frawahr) of a deceased Zoroastrian also must be honored periodically. According to the antique FrawardTn Yast, the immortal spirits return to the corporeal world asking: kö nö stauuät ko yazäite kö ußiätkö frinät kö paiti.zanät gaomata zasta vastrauuata aSa.näsa ndmaijha kahe nö ϊδα nqma äyairiiät kahe vö uruuafräiieziiät kahmäi nö tat däOrdm daiiät yat hë aijhat xairiiqn aßiamndm yauuaëca yauuaëtâtaëca \"Who will laud, venerate, extol, bless us?

To whom among us will that gift be be-stowed, whereby one shall have unlimited food forever?\" (Yast 13:50).6 Through offerings (Av. miiazda-, Phi. mëzd, N.Pers. and P.Gj. myazd) and the fragrances of those offerings—cooked food items in contemporary praxis—that are made holy during the ritual, it is believed a symbolical gathering together of allßauuaSi- occurs ( Yast 13:64). So at such gather-ings the immortal spirits can be propitiated by the living and in turn those spirits presumably bless the living, it is believed.7 Over time, and by the premodern period at the latest, the Stüm became an obligatory performance to attract and honor deceased humans— fulfilling their wish to be appeased—based on lines such as: iristanqm uruuqnô yazamaidë yä asaonqm ßauuasaiiö \"We venerate the souls of the deceased, who are the immortal spirits of the righteous ones\" ( Yasna 26:7; partially cf. Yasna 16:7, and also 37:3.3 which appears to be a later insertion to the Gathic passage).8 The ritual, like other Zoroastrian rites involving both order and afterlife, create in the minds of devotees a pious nexus between the living and the dead across the corporeal and the spiri-tual realms.

Essen-tially, its enactment is permissible as a preemptive action to ensure that the religious path to the afterlife has been prepared properly for an individual's soul and immortal spirit in case death transpires within a setting where fu-nerary rites cannot be performed appropriately. In that situation, the corpo-real existence (Phi. zïndag-ruwân, P.Gj. zinda-rawän) of the person(s) whose uruuan- and frauuaSi- are honored prior to death is noted carefully.

This concern with ensuring that nothing stands in the way of the soul and immortal spirit making a successful transition to the afterlife was captured by the medieval magi with the phrase: padgëtïg râyênisnïh nërang 1000 në eis ud pad mënôg râyênisnïh nërang ëwag eis än \"In corporeal matters, a thousand rites are nothing; in spiritual matters, a single rite is that thing (or paramount)\" (Dënkard 6:E14).12 9 Avesta, vol. 2, p. 179. 10 J.

During the first three days after death the ceremonies are dedicated exclusively to Sraosha, and thereafter to the other divine entities mentioned.

It presently consists of five stages:13 1. Snüman (Av. xsnümaine-) or dedicatory formula, 2. Yasna 26 or the rite proper, 3. Dïbâca or prefatory recitation, 4. A series of propitiatory recitations, 5. Bäj (Phi. wäz) which serves as a closing recitation. 1. Recitation of the Snüman should be dedicated by the priest (Phi. mowbed, N.Pers. möbad, P.Gj. möbed) to the yazata- (Phi. yazad) or venerable spirit in whose name the Stüm is performed (plates IV/1 ). This Snüman consists of Sïrôza (or litany for the entities presiding over the days of month) 1:1 to Ahura Mazda and the Amesha Spentas, together with Sïrôza 1:19 to the Arda Frawahr/Arda Fravash (ardä frawahr/ardä fravas) or all righteous immortal spirits: ahurahe mazdä raëuuatô xvardnatjuhatô amasanqm span tanqm \"For Ahura Mazda the radiant and glorious, for the Amesha Spentas,\" and aSäunqm frauuaSinqm uyranqm aißiOüranqm \"For the mighty, victorious, immortal spirits of the righteous ones.\"14 So the creator deity, the beneficent immortals, and the spirits of the dead are honored. Sraosha is the only praiseworthy spirit in whose sole name a Snüman can be performed without mention of Ahura Mazda at the beginning as is done in all other dedicatory for-mulas. Sraosha is regarded as the manifestation of mqOra.spanta- (Phi. mänsar-spand, märaspand) or the holy word and, therefore, is in charge of prayer itself.15 2. Yasna 26 is performed, next, by the priest beginning with the words staomi zbaiiemi \"I praise, I invoke\" (26:1 without the first stanza). This is a chapter (Av. haiti-, Phi. häd) of scripture that belongs to the haoma-13 On the prayers see also R.D.

The Dîbâca follows, murmured by the priest in bäj or undertone, be-cause it is a Pazand passage recited between two sections of the Avestan scripture (plates IV/2).17 Initially it is stated that the Dîbâca is recited in the hope that through the good thoughts, good words, and good deeds of living Zoroastrians (especially those persons commissioning and per-forming the ritual) the Stüm will be efficacious and religiosity will be spread throughout the world (sees. 1-2). It is believed that upon being pleased with the offering, the frauuaSi- will reciprocate by bestowing joy, prosperity, and wellbeing to residents of the locality (province, city, town, or village) which is named (sees. 3-4). Ahura Mazda, the Amesha Spentas (as a group), and the frauuaSi- again collectively are invoked (sees. 4-8). Then the individual or individuals or persons—dead or liv-ing—on whose behalf the Stüm takes place is named plus the person or persons (if different) who has commissioned the ritual (sec. 8). The names of Zarathushtra and possibly other notable figures—legendary such as Gayo Maretan and Saoshyant, and historical such as Adurbad i Maraspand and Neryosangh Dhaval—of the ancient, medieval, and modern Zoroastrian communities in Iran and India (and elsewhere if necessary) are invoked as well.

A series of propitiatory recitations by the priest commence with Yasna 26:11.1 only (the rest of 26:11 is not recited in the Stüm ritual): vïspâ frauuaSaiiö aSäunqm yazamaidë iristanqm uruuqnô yazamaidë yâ aSaonqmfrauuaSaiiö \"We venerate all the immortal spirits of the right-eous ones, we venerate the souls of the deceased, who are the immortal spirits of the righteous ones.\"18 Yasna 6:19 (cf.

Yasna 6:20.3 comes next with variation according to the gäh or period (watch) of the day. The Ye^hëHätqm prayer (Yasna 27:15.3) is chanted:yeqhëhätqm äat yesnëpaitï varjhö mazdä ahurö ναβθά a Sät haeä yäijhqmcä tqscä tascä yazamaidë \"In accordance with order, Ahura Mazda knows those male and female entities who are better for veneration.

One Asdm Vohü prayer is said. Thereafter, the unit of four prayers—namely, Ahmäi Raësca, Hazaijrdm, Jasa Mê Avaijhe Mazdä, Kdrfd Muzd—should be recited.22 This concludes the Stüm ritual. The entire ritual must be conducted in the presence of a holy fire on a fire vase (P.Gj. äfringänyu, afargänyu). Sandalwood (P.Gj. sukhar < Gj. sukhad) and frankincense (P.Gj. and Gj. löbän) is provided to the fire by the officiating priest during the ritual. Family members of the deceased or living person (for whose soul the ritual was conducted) also offer wood and incense to the fire after the ritual has concluded. OCCASIONS AND OFFERINGS IN CONTEMPORARY PRACTICE Traditionally, among Parsis, when the Stüm is first performed it takes place on the fourth (Phi., N.Pers., and P.Gj. cahärom) day after death and follows the Yasna, Äfrinagän, and Bäj rituals. So during the häwan gäh, around midmoming, this ritual is performed with a food offering and, as mentioned previously, referred to as Stüm-nu bhönu. The cere-mony makes holy those food items. Priests who have carried out the rites in honor of Sraosha, at a prayer hall near a funerary site or at a fire tem-ple, during the three preceding days for the spiritual welfare of the de-ceased person are requested to honor both Ahura Mazda and the de-parted soul by gratefully consuming the food after taking the Bäj of Ohrmazd,23 Essentially the food is viewed as an offering of charitable 21 Avesta, vol. 2, p. 42.

In Iran, during the 1960s, a equivalent ritual—called Yast-i savgîra or hymn of the night period—would be conducted for the first time in memory of a deceased Zoroastrian's soul and immortal spirit dur-ing the usahin gäh of the third night after the fourth drön service in honor of ardâ fravas has been performed. It also seems to have parallels with the four bäj services performed by Parsis in India.24 This custom may have arisen from late medieval practice, where recitation of the Stüm would be substituted if the drön service in honor of ardä fravas and faroxsl could not be performed.25 Zoroastrians in the region of Yazd included cloth for the ritual undershirt (Phi. sabïg, N.Pers. sedra, sTv, sabï, P.Gj. sudra), a ritual cord (Phi. kustïg, N.Pers. kôstï, P.Gj. kusti), and a silver coin or ring (a practice perhaps assimilated in antiquity from Greek propitiation).26 Among Parsis, another Stüm-nu bhönu is per-formed during the uzërin gäh or evening. The Stüm also might be performed by Parsis three times each day—in the early morning and midmorning (häwan gäh) and in the early evening (uzërin gäh)—on the fifth through tenth days after the death occurred. Additional Stüm rituals for the soul of a deceased or living individual may be performed on monthly and annual anniversaries of death, on the six gähänbär/gähämbär or feast days especially on the all souls days (Av. hamaspaOmaëdaiia-, VXû. fr award ïgâ η, N.Pers. panjî, P.Gj. muk-tâd), on frawardin röz or day of the immortal spirits (which is the nine-teenth day of each month), on jasn (P.Gj .jasan) or festival days (where the day and month dedicated to a divine entity coincide such as mihr röz mihr mäh or day of Mithra and month of Mithra), and on the day before marriage (P.Gj. varadhpatra < varadh \"ancestor\" + patra \"correspon-dence\") in honor of bygone relatives.27 On each of those occasions, the Stüm is commissioned by a family member and the food made holy is wal/Boyd, A Persian Offering, p. 77. 24 Modi, The Religious Ceremonies and Customs of the Parsees, p. 81. 25 Persian Riväyats, ed.

The food offering, representing the sacrifice, is placed before the priest, next to the fire vase. In Parsi practice, the traditional food offering for the early morning Stüm consists of sweet dishes (P.Gj. mîthï väni), porridge (P.Gj. khîr), and well water (P.Gj. kuvä-nu pânî, whose ritual purity can be determined unlike running water from faucets) in a metal vessel placed in the center of the individual items of the offering. The midmorning food offering may include rice and lentils or spilt peas with sheep, goat, or chicken meat (P.Gj. gosht-nu dhänshäk) or without meat (P.Gj. dhänshäk), meatballs (P.Gj. kabäb), fried fish (P.Gj. tareli machht), gourd with meat (P.Gj. dôdhï-nu gosht), a vegetable salad with radishes plus limes and lemons (P.Gj. kachumbar-linbu), wine, and a pot of well water. At the early evening ritual, the consecrated meal com-prises thin flat wheat bread (P.Gj. rôtit, Gj. rôti), potatoes with meat (P.Gj. papetä-nu gosht), fried fish, cream custard, wine, and a pot of well water (plates IV/3). Some orthodox families, at locales like Navsari, Surat, and Udvada, continue to follow this pattern of food offerings. The more common custom among Parsi families in Indian cities like Bombay (Mumbai), in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and western countries—where it is now considered a novelty for the traditional offering to be made—is to prepare a sweet meat, a couple of fried eggs, a flat bread, and a pot of water, or even more frequently to purchase and present fruits in lieu of cooked foods-, for the early morning Stüm. A couple of cooked dishes and a pot of water constitute the offerings for the midmorning and early evening Stüm. The varadh patra offering, less frequent in recent years, may include large crisp cream of wheat doughnuts (P.Gj. varadh-varän), vermicelli (P.Gj. sev), fried fish, and pieces of unrefined palm sugar or jaggery with wafers (P.Gj. gol-päpdl, gor-päpri). All purity laws relating to preparation of food should be followed for each offering -including ensuring that the metal cooking utensils and containers are clean and that the food is cooked at home by Zoroastrians.28 Moreover, if the site where the ritual is to be conducted lays outside the home—such as at a fire temple—then purity of the offerings must be ensured during transporta-28 See further J.K.

Hence the increasing popularity of fruits as the main item proffered. During each offering, an oil lamp is present on the right side of the priest. An earlier Navsari practice, no longer prevalent, involved preparing a relish called vaghär or onion and ghee (clarified butter) on the evening before the anjumanïgähämbär or congregational feast by the communal elders wearing jäma-pichhörl or ceremonial white robe and sash at the Khurshed Wâdï or feast garden founded in honor of Ervad Khurshedji Tehmulji Desai, an illustrious leader of the eighteenth century C.E. The vaghär mixture, fried in oil, also contained turmeric, garlic', and cumin and was used to flavor brown rice for the food offering during the Stüm ritual associated with the gähämbär. The tan-dorostï (a set of Pazand dedicatory passages) was recited in honor of the congregation by all per-sons present. That Navsari food offering derives from an older Iranian custom. It is recorded, for example, that rue (N.Pers. sedöw) was sent from Iran to India by the dastürän or chief priests of Yazd via the Parsi emissary Bahman Asfandyar around the year 1627 C.E. for use in prepa-ration of the anjumanï gähämbär. In Iran, when the first cauldron for that feast was placed on the stove, priests would be present and their leader would pour in milk, rue, and vinegar, among other food items. The practice continued at Sharifabad during the early 1960s, when rue, turmeric, garlic, cumin, coriander, pepper, and salt would be fried, then vinegar and water added, and the resulting preparation eaten with mint and bread as a ceremonial meal—called sir ο sedöw—associated with Sraosha and supposedly first prepared by the legendary Yima Xshaeta or Jamsheed to stifle Angra Mainyu's voracious appetite.29 Another traditional feature of the Parsi version of the Stüm ritual was to set aside, in a dish, a small portion of each food offering either for family dog(s), dogs living at fire temples and funerary sites, or even stray dogs. This meal for the dog (P.Gj. kuträ-ηδ bük), done not only after rites but even after regular meals, acknowledged the role of canines in Zoroastrian rites—such as funerary ones—and eschatology. Hence, on the occasion of the Stüm it is proffered in the name of soul and spirit of the person for whom the ritual was conducted. Moreover, the dog's im-portance is acknowledged by feeding it first, even prior to the priests and la-ity. Among traditionalist villagers at Sharifabad in Iran, during the early 29 B.B.

They are an integral part of the philosophy of religion and are woven into the fabric of the daily religious lives. Zoroastrian theology sees two primeval, pri-mordial principles of Good and Evil working in the world. If man has to progress and prosper, then he has to remain on the side of the good, not only because that is the right thing to do, but also because it fortifies him against the onslaught of evil and empowers him to actively fight evil. Rituals are one of the chief means given by the religion to fulfil that pur-pose. They enhance the good, inhibit the power of evil and protect the good from its onslaught. Moreover, rituals also have the power to conse-crate the mundane in order to elevate it to the pedestal of being worthy for the sacred. Another important purpose of Zoroastrian rituals is an eschatological one. Laities enjoin the priests to perform rituals, on payment of certain fees (which till the last century used to be more in kind, than in cash), in mem-ory of dear departed ones on particular occasions like death anniversaries. Rituals have always been held sacrosanct in Zoroastrian religion. Con-trary to the theory for ritual, by T.W. Jennings, that there should be contin-ual emendation of ritual practice to reflect our changing knowledge, Zoro-astrian rituals undergo negligible variation through time and that too out of necessity.1 The changes are not wilfully executed to reflect change in knowledge, but are more a result of change in circumstances. In India, Zoroastrian rituals are classified into two groups, variously referred to as the Outer and Inner rituals, Higher and Lower rituals or Major and Minor rituals. Though the Bäj-dharnä is generally regarded as belonging to the group of Inner rituals, along with rituals like the Yasna, Visperad and Vendidad, there are some disagreements as to its exact place in Zoroastrian rituals. The final section of this paper considers the criteria which determine the place of Bäj-dharnä in Zoroastrian rituals.2 1 R.G. Williams/J.W. Boyd, Ritual Art and Knowledge (South Carolina, 1993), p. 134. 2 This paper is a part of a much larger study on the ritual."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"I. THE TERM BÄJ-DHARNÄ The word 'Bäj-dharnä' is the colloquial Parsi Gujarati term for the ritual previously known as the Drön Yast. In Pahlavi this ritual is also referred to as wäz-griftan, yast-ï-drôn, drön y as tan and gösödäg yastan or sim-ply drön.4 In New Persian books, especially the Riväyats, the Bäj-dharnä is referred to as bäj-T-nän,5 In the Iranian tradition it was referred to as yast-T-barsom, or just drön. The Indian tradition often refers to it just as bäj. In Parsi priestly parlance it is known as drön chäsni or gösodö bhantar.6 Amongst certain inner circle of priests it is also re-ferred to as the vispaëSqm or gäus hudäo.7 An old manuscript, which has colophons in Old Gujarati and Pazand, has the word Drön Yast in Pazand and the word Bäj-dharnä in Gujarati for this ritual.8 Each of the above terms used for the Bäj-dharnä refers to a requisite or aspect of the ritual, which will be further explained later on. In this article, the term Bäj-dharnä will be uniformly used, and the term Drön Yast will be used when the original references necessitates it. The term Bäj-dharnä is made up of two components. The first com-ponent bäj, has multifarious meanings and variegated functions in the Zoroastrian tradition.9 Often, just this first part of the compound by itself is used to signify the ritual. The second component of the compound dharnä, is a Gujarati word, which means \"holding, taking\" (Phi. griftan, N.P. giriftan). The word dharnä signifies that the priest performing the ritual 'holds' the 'ritual observance' to consecrate the items offered in the ritual. The Gujarati 3 P.

The word Bäj-dharnä is also used technically in a secondary sense by Zoroastrian priests to signify the set of Avestan texts which follow the texts of Visperad and Vidêvdâd proper while performing the respective rituals. These texts closely approximate the texts recited during the Bäj-dharnä ritual.10 When the word Bäj-dharnä, is used in this secondary sense, the entire word is used, and a single component by itself is never independently used. II. THE BÄJ-DHARNÄ RITUAL In India, the Bäj-dharnä is performed several times on a daily basis in almost all fire-temples. Not only is it an invariable preliminary requisite for all Inner rituals (including performance of the Bäj-dharnä itself), it is also a part of the quartet of rituals performed in memory of departed ones on the Chähröm (fourth day), Dasmä (tenth day), STrözä (thirtieth day) Mäsisä (first month), Rojgär (subsequent monthly commemora-tions), Chhamsi (sixth month), Varsi (first death anniversary), subse-quent death anniversaries, as also on other important days of the Zoroas-trian calendar such as the Parabh1 ', Gähämbär, and Fravardegän days. It is generally performed at the behest of the laity in memory of their de-parted ones. It is also performed for several different purposes, with variations in dedicatory formulae, depending on the day, purpose and event of performance. 1. Purposes and invocations The Baj-dharnä fulfils several ritual, theological and social purposes. A study of the various purposes of its performance reveals the paramount importance of this ritual and the important place it held and holds among Zoroastrian rituals. It also reveals some present and some forgotten Zo-roastrian customs, festivals and observances. However, primarily the Bäj-dharnä is performed for consecration and commemoration. 10 N.K.

Moreover from the same manuscript it seems that some of these were introduced later on in India from Iran dur-ing the period of Riväyats.12 2. Duration Presently in India, it takes about twenty to thirty minutes for the per-formance of a Bäj-dharnä. Though it is generally performed daily in most fire-temples at the instance of the laity, priests have to first perform it for their own selves, before they can perform it on behalf of others.13 3. Qualifications In India, till the 1940s, only priests observing the ritual power of the Baresnum were able to perform the Bäj-dharnä.14 Since then, this restric-tion has been relaxed and a priest can perform it even without this ritual power. However, in the olden times, as today, the performance of daily obligatory prayers before the consecration of Bäj-dharnä is a must. No excuses, not even a physiological drawback was allowed to overlook this injunction.15 4. Merit In merit this ritual was considered lesser than the Yasna. In fact, when the Yasna ritual went wrong somehow or errors were committed in its performance, its merit decreased to that of a Drön Yast.16 5. Timing As a rule, the Bäj-dharnä can be performed in any gäh, that is, at any time of the day. However some of its performances are restricted to spe-cific gähs only. For instance, the performance for the Panj-täe could be performed only in the Hävan, Rapithwin or Uzirin gäh. 12 Modi, \"An Old Manuscript of the Kitäb-T Darün Yasht\", pp. 9, 10. 13 Such a performance is technically referred to as the rtâni khub \"the shorter per-formance for ritual power\". 14 H.M.

Posture Priests performing the Bäj-dharnä could either sit or stand during the ritual. Presently, priests of the Sanjana diocese prefer to sit and perform it, however priests of the Bhagaria and other diocese prefer to stand and perform the ritual. In the past, priests were expected to stand during the whole of the ritual except the beginning and end, when the major ritual actions were performed.19 If a priest was not able to stand during the en-tire ritual, he was expected to stand during the passages which were re-cited twice and thrice, while reciting the invocatory formulae (xsnumansj and a section ο/ϊθά äat äat yazamaide20 But, if that too was not possi-ble, then he was permitted to sit and perform the ritual.21 III. REQUISITES FOR THE BÄJ-DHARNÄ 1. Drön The drön is an inevitable requisite in all inner rituals, including the Bäj-dharnä.

Under the term drön, three similar types of preparations are used in the Bäj-dharnä: a) Drön: It is the unleavened bread with nine marks on it. It looks like a small flat bread (chapäti for Indians), about 0.5 mm. in breadth. Pah-lavi and Persian texts consider the round drön as a metaphor for the world, with its edge representing Mount Harborz. The flat middle sec-tion of the drön is used to symbolise men, cattle and plants.26 b) Frasast: Plain unleavened drön without any markings on it. c) Chityä: Chityä are the smaller unmarked drön (frasast), about 3 inches in diameter. They are used specifically for the Bäj-dharnä of Panj-täe which is performed for acquiring ritual power (Guj. amal) for per-forming other rituals. The Riväyats describe them as having almost one-third the weight of the frasast. 2. Gösodäg The word gösodäg (Av. gäus huöa \"of the well-created cow\") signifies a representative offering from the animal kingdom. Generally clarified butter (Guj. ght) is used in the Bäj-dharnä and it is partaken in the end by the priest while doing the chäsni. Nowadays, a small teaspoonful of gösodäg is placed on the drön in the middle. 3. Urvar Urvar (Av. uruuara) signifies a ritual requisite referring to vegetables and fruits like pomegranate, date fruit, plantain or raisins. In the olden times herbs (Phi. spraham), fruits/vegetables (Phi. tarrag) and dry-fruits (Phi. mëvag) were also used as urvar. 23 Williams, The Pahlavi Riväyat Accompanying the Dädestän ïDênîg, p. 246. 24 Boyce/Kotwal, \"Zoroastrian bäj and drön\", p. 64. 25 S.J.

Äp The word äp refers to water (Av. äpa) used for the ritual. Water for use in any Zoroastrian ritual has to be collected from a moving source of wa-ter like the river, stream or well and never from a stagnant source. Water thus collected passes through stages of ritual purification at the com-mencement of the ritual, and only such ritually purified water is used for the ritual. Water is used during the Bäj-dharnä ritual for washing hands and cleaning utensils. It is also consecrated and used later for dipping the drön and sipping during the ritual tasting. For washing and cleaning, it is filled in larger metallic utensils (Guj. kahärnu and kalasyä) and for ritual tasting it is used in a smaller metallic utensil (Guj .fulyu). 5. Esm-böy The word esm (Av. aësma \"wood, fuel\") and böy (Av. baoiôi \"incense, fumigation\") indicate three pieces of firewood with lumps of incense over it which are used during the ritual. Presently, as in the past,27 they are placed on a stone slab on the ground, on the right hand side of the hindholä on which the fire-vase is placed. The three pieces of fire wood symbolise good thoughts, words and deeds.28 6. Barsom (Täe) Barsom are thin metallic rods (Guj. täe; Phi. täk, täg, täe; NP täk) which are used in all inner rituals: the Yasna, Visperad, Vidêvdâd and the Bäj-dharnä.29 In the past, twigs from trees were used as barsom. The Avesta refers to such barsom as uruuarä baresman. Any type of tree was per-missible, provided it did not have perforations on its trunk.30 Later the twigs of trees were replaced by thin metallic rods. This development is reflected in some Bäj-dharnä manuscripts as they include rituals for ob-taining and tying both types of barsom. 27 Williams, The Pahlavi Rivayat Accompanying the Dadestan ι Dénig, p. 97, ch. 58.20. 28 Williams, The Pahlavi Riväyat Accompanying the Dädestän î Dënîg, p. 93, ch. 56.7. 29 See R.P.

Aiwyäonghan Aiwyäonghan (Av. aiwyaijhana \"[that which is] tied around\") is either a date palm leaf or metallic chains (Guj. sänkli) tied around to secure the rods (täe) of the Barsom. Presently in the Bäj-dharnä the use of date palm leaf has been discontinued, and only two metallic chains of un-equal length are used. The longer chain is about 18 inches and the shorter one about 12 inches. When the täe are tied with a date palm leaf, only one leaf is used. The reason for using two chains seems to be that metallic chains on metallic barsom rods tend to slip, and hence double chains are used for better grip. 8. Metallic utensils The following metallic utensils are required for the performance of a Bäj-dharnä. a) Kahärnu: A large metallic pot used to draw out water from the well. It usually stores about 5 to 6 litres of water. It is kept on the hind-holä and water from it is used to refill the metallic urn. b) Kalashyâ: A small metallic water container, which stores about a litre of water. Water from it is used to wash hands as well as other ritual requisites. It is re-filled several times from the larger metallic pot (Ka-härnu). c) Fulyu (Phi. âb-gîr): A small metallic cup, which holds a couple of drafts of water. It is used to place water for the purpose of ritual tasting and sipping. It is placed next to the Drön-tray. d) Khumchä (Phi. drön sazäk): The tray in which drön, frasast and other ritual requisites are placed. It is about ten to twelve inches in di-ameter, and is ritually purified before the requisites are placed in it. e) Langri; (Phi. padisxwar): A deep tray used if there are any addi-tional edible (plantains, boiled eggs etc.) or inedible (clothes, etc.) offer-ings to be placed in the Bäj-dharnä. It does not form a part of the regular requirement of the ritual. f) A metallic knife (optional): It was generally used to cut the date-palm leaf, when it was to be used as aiwyäonghan. Nowadays, since me-"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"tallic chains are used as aiwyaonghan, the knife is not required for the ritual. 9. Fire As in all Zoroastrian rituals, fire plays an important role in the Bäj-dharnä ritual too. It is placed on a metallic fire-vase (G. afargänyu) upon the hindholä (Phi. urvis). However, it seems that in olden times, fire was not an integral and in-dispensable requirement of this ritual. Manuscripts of the ritual categori-cally give two distinct prayer formulae which have to be recited alterna-tively in the presence or absence of a fire.31 Still, it seems that the pres-ence of fire was necessary in certain types of invocation.32 10. Demarcated place Like all other Inner rituals, the Bäj-dharnä is performed in a place en-closed by furrows on the ground, calledpävis. A room adjoining the fire-temple, having permanently marked furrows on the ground, known as the urvis gäh, is the place where such rituals are performed. If the Bäj-dharnä is to be performed outside the urvis gäh, the place has to be spe-cially cleaned, washed and marked with temporary pävis, generally made of sand. IV. RITUAL ACTS PERFORMED DURING THE BÄJ-DHARNÄ Several ritual actions have to be performed during the performance of the Bäj-dharnä. Some of them precede the performance of the ritual proper. Each of the diverse ritual actions is an invariable and integral component of the ritual as a whole. 1. Ritual cleansing of requisites The metallic ritual implements including kalashyä, kahärnu, fulyu, täe and sänkli have to be first washed (Guj. säf) and then made ritually clean (Guj. chokkha). First the priest takes two kalashyä (or one kahärnu and one kalashyä) and washes them with water drawn from well. Then he subjects them to the second grade of cleansing, by the threefold washing 31 Ms. J4, pp. 11, 19,24,32. 32 Modi, \"An Old Manuscript of the Kitäb-ϊ Darün Yasht\", p. 22."},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"with water from the well and thus makes them ritually clean. He then fills them with well water and brings them within the 'pävV and places them either on the hindholä or in the khumchâ. Thereafter he takes a fulyu, five täe and two sänkli, which too are subjected to the first two types of washings, and places them within the pävi next to the kalashyä. 2. Placing of ësm-bôy The priest keeps the fire-vase on the ground on the right hand side, places a slab of stone33 to its right and puts three fire-wood pieces (ësm) on it, with a small lump or a few grains of incense (boy) on each of the three fire-wood pieces. 3. Ritually purifying the kalashyä The priest places both the kalashyäs (or one kahärnu and one kalashyä), filled with well water, on the ground or on a khurnchä.34 Then he picks up the kahärnu or a kalashyä, which is previously filled with well water, and pours the water, while reciting certain textual passages, into the sec-ond water filled kalashyä. This is done in such a way that the water over-flows. 4. Action for ritually purifying the left hand, täe and sänkli The priest takes the five metallic täe of the barsom and the two sänkli in his left hand. In his right hand he holds the kalashyä from outside, and while reciting certain Avestan texts, pours water over his left hand hold-ing the täe and the sänklis thus making his hands and the requisites ritu-ally pure. Then he keeps his left hand uptil the wrist along with the täe and sänklis in the kalashyä.35 Thereafter, while thus holding the kalashyä, he pours water over the right hand while reciting certain Avestan texts. 33 Pavri, Bäjdharnäne lagtipävmehelni kriyäo, p. 51. 34 As per the practise of Sanjana priests from Udwada, the two kalashyäs (or one ka-härnu and one kalashyä), are placed on the hindholä. 35 As the left hand is ritually pure, it cannot hold the kalashyä, which is not ritually pure, from outside."},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"5. Tying of the aiwyaonghana The priest holds the täe of the barsom in his left hand, and the two sänk-lis in his right. One end of the shorter sänkli should be held in the left hand along with the täes. He then recites certain Avestan passages and ties the chains one after another. 6. Glancing at the ritual requisites During the course of the ritual the words gäus hu8a âpê urvar aêsma baoiöi occur several times in the text. Whenever these words occur, the priest is supposed to glance at the clarified butter, water, fruits, fuel and incense respectively. 7. Ritual tasting The priest partakes of the drön and frasast in the ritual with or without water, fruits and other edible requisites. This ritual tasting is called chäsni. During the end of the ritual, the tasting is done five times and then water is sipped. After the ritual is over, the individual/family at whose behest the ritual is performed, and other members of the congre-gation also do the chäsni. The partaking of chäsni is considered an act of great merit, as it im-plies that the partaker has actively participated in the ritual. The ritual tasting by the laity is either done in the place where the ritual is per-formed, or the dröns are sent to the house of the persons who had re-quested the performance of the ritual. The person who takes the conse-crated items, and the persons who eats them, have to be Zoroastrians. V. TEXTUAL STRUCTURE OF THE BÄJ-DHARNÄ The performance of the Bäj-dharnä comprises of the recitation of Avestan and Pazand texts. These texts include certain variable compo-nents, both in Avestan and Pazand, inserted at several places. These variable components are invocatory formulae (Phi. xsnuman) in honour of divine beings to whom the performance of the Bäj-dharnä is dedi-cated. Thus, the texts recited during the Bäj-dharnä constitute 1. A fixed text, and 2. variable texts."},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"1. Fixed text a) Introductory portion The fixed text of the Bäj-dharnä contains an introductory portion made up of short formulae to accompany ritual actions and the Dibächeh. This is a Pazand prayer in which departed ones are remembered by their names. It forms an integral part of all Zoroastrian rituals. b) Main text The main text of the Bäj-dharnä is sourced from chapters 3 to 8, 23 and 26 of the Yasna. The main text has a shorter variation and a larger one. The larger variation has additional paragraphs and an extra recitation of the Dibächeh. The usage of either of the two versions of the main text depends on the invocatory formula recited within the main text of the Bäj-dharnä. 2. Variable texts The variable texts are the different invocatory formulae inserted into the body of the main text at appropriate places, depending on the purpose for the performance of the Bäj-dharnä. The invocatory formula to each divine being has three variations as follows: a) Pazand b) Shorter Avestan xsnuman c) Larger Avestan xsnuman The variable texts are sub-divided into two categories, distinguished by the inclusion of a secondary invocation beginning with the word vïs-paëÇqm. Those versions of the Bäj-dharnä wherein the secondary invocation is included are considered more important than the Bäj-dharnä belonging to the other category.36 The barsom consecrated and tied in the perform-ance of a Bäj-dharnä with such an invocation, cannot be re-used for the performance of another Bäj-dharnä. The variable texts pertaining to the following invocations belong to this category:37 36 F.M. Kotwal/J.

Sahen Though the invocations for the divine beings Ardäfravash, Gäthä and Mënôg Nävar do not contain the secondary invocatory formula of vïs-paësqm, they too belong to this category. There was a time, when Iranian priests were of the opinion that the Bäj-dharnä with invocations containing the secondary invocation cannot be consecrated in the tenth month (Dae) of the Zoroastrian calendar. 38 However, priests in India do not maintain such a distinction. The differences maintained for these two types of variable texts may be due to the fact that the invocatory formulae with a secondary invoca-tion contain venerations to more than one divine being. VI. NOTES ON THE HISTORY OF THE BÄJ-DHARNÄ The history of the Bäj-dharnä or Drön Yast as a ritual goes back at least to Sasanian times (3rd to 7th centuries C.E.). Apart from the short Pahlavi text Cim ï Drön, which exclusively deals with the Drön Yast, several Pahlavi texts either have chapters dedicated to it or have references to its performance. The Ardä Viräz Nämag mentions the performance of vari-ous rituals among other consecration (Phi. yastf9 and the performance (Phi. kard),40 of drön. The Bäj-dharnä was an essential ritual during the times when most of the Pahlavi texts were composed. The Nërangestân, an ancient ritualistic text in Avestan and Pahlavi,41 mentions that \"when there arises to a per-son no desire for the Holy Service of the sacred Drön, that must be wrong.\"42 During Sasanian and post Sasanian times, the Drön Yast was a neces-sary and important ritual expected to be performed after death. The Pah-lavi Riväyats recommend the consecration of this ritual as the least one 38 Pavri, Bäjdharnäne lagtipävmehelni kriyäo, pp. 184-85. 39 Gignoux, Le livre d'Ardä Viräz, ch. 1.15,2.14,3.11. 40 Gignoux, Le livre d Άrdä Viräz, ch. 13.4, 17.3. 41 On the Nërangestân, see also the paper by Ph. Kreyenbroek in this volume. 42 Bulsara, Aërpatastân and Nîrangastân, p. 943."},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"could do to fulfil one's obligation towards a departed one.43 In the Pah-lavi Riväyats, questions are often asked regarding performance of Drön Yast. Apart from stray references, entire chapters are dedicated to the Drön Yast. The Pahlavi Riväyat accompanying the Dädestän ï Dënïg, (9th/10th century c.e.)44 refers to the Drön as well as the Drön Yast at several places. In fact, chs. 56 and 58 of this text are exclusively devoted to this ritual and its requisites. Ch. 10 of Fragard I of the Nerangestän is very similar in contents to Ch. 58 (1-66) of the Pahlavi Riväyat accompany-ing the Dädestän T Dënïg, though the sequence of passages differ.45 In the Pahlavi Riväyat of Äturfarnbag, belonging to the first half of the ninth century,46 Drön Yast stands out as one of the most commonly performed ritual of those times, and also as an important component of after-death rituals. A study of this text throws interesting light on several aspects of the ritual. The Pahlavi Riväyat of Farnabag-Srös is almost entirely devoted to the performance of drön ritual. Bearing the date 1008 c.e.,47 it is poste-rior to the previous Riväyat almost by a century, but because of the pre-ponderance of questions relating to the performance of drön and related topics, it seems that either the importance of this ritual must have radi-cally increased with the passage of time, or it may have become more intricate and difficult to perform. Of the thirty questions in this Riväyat, eighteen are directly pertaining to the consecration of Drön,48 and seven to matters related to preparatory or related rituals.49 In the second paragraph of the Pazand Dibächeh, three rituals have been mentioned: the Yasna, Drön (Yast) and Myazd. Of these, the first two are well known and performed to this day. The last mentioned ritual, Myazd, seems to be the Äfringän ritual with minor variations.50 The fact that Drön Yast finds a mention in this passage once again establishes it as one of the essential rituals performed in memory of departed ones. 43 Anklesaria, The Pahlavi Riväyat of Äturfarnbag and Farnbag-srôs, ch. 128.1. 44 Williams, The Pahlavi Riväyat Accompanying the Dädestän îDënïg, p. 8. 45 A note of the above texts as well as the similar text of Cim I Drön has been made by K.M.

THE PLACE OF THE BÄJ-DHARNÄ AMONG ZOROASTRIAN RITUALS In terms of ritual merit, the Bäj-dhamä is considered of lesser impor-tance than other Inner rituals, the reasons perhaps being the derivative text and the shorter duration of ritual and recitation. However, some Pah-lavi texts place its importance in certain aspects even as greater to that of the Yasna.51 Since it is an essential pre-requisite for the performance of other Inner rituals, it enjoys a central position in Zoroastrian rituals. The performance of a Drön Yast is considered in merit equal to one tanäpuhl52 and its \"wondrousness and victoriousness and power and strength\" is great enough to powerfully strike demons after sunset.53 However, if the Bäj-dhamä is caused to be performed by sinners, it looses its efficacy and merit, and instead becomes a tool in the hands of the evil.54 In ancient times the efficacy of the performance of the ritual differed in accordance with the basic ritual requirements offered in it. For in-stance, if the drön was consecrated along with the gösodäg, with the in-vocation of Ohrmazd, its merit was considered 300 times greater than an ordinary performance of the ritual.55 However, presently, the drön and gösodäg form the usual minimum requirements of this ritual, and the invocation of Ohrmazd is one of the many invocations, and does not proffer any special merits or increase the efficacy of the ritual. As indicated earlier, in India, Zoroastrian rituals are classified into two groups. It is not clear as to when this classification exactly came along. The distinction is made on the basis of various criteria like ritual purity of the performing priests, implements required for the performance, place of per-formance, and the source of the text recited during the ritual. These two groups are variously referred to as the Outer and Inner rituals (on the basis of place of performance), Higher and Lower rituals (on the basis of ritual purity required of the performer), Major and Minor rituals (supposedly on the basis of the texts recited for the performance - the rituals included in the scriptures of Yasna, Visperad and the Vidêvdâd, are generally regarded as the Major ones, and the rituals associated with the text of Khorde Avesta and the Yasts are generally regarded as the Minor ones). 51 Kotwal/Kreyenbroek, The Hërbëdëstân and Nërangestân, ch. 10.38, p. 71, fn. 180. 52 A tanäpuhl (Av. tanu-paratha) is a measure used in reference to virtues and sins. 53 Williams, The Pahlavi Riväyat Accompanying the Dädestän îDënîg, ch. 9.1-3, p. 17. 54 Williams, The Pahlavi Riväyat Accompanying the Dädestän îDënîg, ch. 43.8, p. 71. 55 Williams, The Pahlavi Riväyat Accompanying the Dädestän f DënTg, ch. 9.9, p. 17."},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"In Gujarati the two groups are referred to as 'Päv-mahel' and 'Hush-mordi' rituals. This distinction is made on the basis of the place where the rituals are performed. The word 'Päv-mahel' is derived from the word pävi, which refers to furrows or grooves on the flooring used to demarcate ritually pure areas. There is a room adjoining the mam hall in all Indian fire-temples, known as the 'urvis-gäh',56 in which pâvis are permanently made to facilitate performance of rituals. The distinction between two type of rituals, and the place of Bäj-dharnä in it, is very necessary from the priestly point of view in India, where presently, the 'Inner rituals' can be performed only by priests who have undergone the higher priesthood initiation of'Marätab'. Those who have only undergone the basic initiation of Nävar can only perform Outer rituals. Though the rightful place of all other Zoroastrian rituals is clearly de-termined in either of the two groups of rituals, there has been no clear cut demarcation regarding the place of the Bäj-dharnä. Two sets of rituals, the 'yast Τ meh' \"the greater ritual service\", and the 'yast ï keh' \"the shorter ritual service\" are mentioned in Pahlavi.57 From certain references it appears that the 'yast Τ meh' referred to the Yasna ritual and 'yast Τ keh' to the Drön Yast.58 At one place, a commentator refers to the Drön Yast as the 'yast I keh',59 which gives the impression that it was either a narrowly used, but not the generally accepted nomenclature for the Drön Yast, or perhaps just one of the many understandings of that term. At another place in the same text, the 'yast ï meh' is qualified by the phrase ï sröd ï gähän \"which (is) the chanting of Gathas\",60 which implies that the 'yast Τ keh' may be the recitation of the text of the Yasna, without the chanting of the Gathas, a usage attested to even in present times.61 Such an abridged ser-vice is sometimes performed to impart ritual power to priests for per-56 The term urvis refers to the stone seat on which a priest performing Inner rituals sits. 57 Boyce/Kotwal, \"Zoroastrian bäj and drön\", p. 64. 58 Also see Kotwal/Kreyenbroek, unpublished Vol. 3 of Nirangistan, ch. 29.12, fn. 20, where the Drön Y ait is referred to as the 'yast i keh'. I thank Professor Kreyenbroek for sharing relevant paragraphs of the unpublished manuscript of the forthcoming book. 59 Kotwal/Kreyenbroek, The Hërbêdëstân and Nërangestân, ch. 9.9, p. 17. 60 Williams, The Pahlavi Riväyat Accompanying the Dädestän ï Dënïg, ch. 21a.l0, 11, 14, 15, 17, p. 45. 61 Dastur Kotwal states that the 'yast Τ keh' refers to the abridged version of the Yasna ritual dedicated to Mino Nävar: - Kotwal/Kreyenbroek, The Hërbëdëstân and Nërangestân, p. 111, fn. 392."},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"formance of other Inner rituals.62 It also seems that in the olden times the dedicatory formulae for the 'yast Τ keh' and 'yast Τ meh' were different for the same divine being, at least in some cases. However, here we find that the lesser and greater services may both be the Yasna service in different forms as they include the recitations of chapters 65 and 68 of the Yasna.63 This is however not the case now, as the dedicatory formulae in all rituals whether Inner or Outer is the same for all divine beings. A special number of barsom twigs (13) are instructed to be used in the 'yast ï keh', which indicates it to be a ritual independent by itself.64 We shall now examine ten criteria for determining a Zoroastrian rit-ual as an Inner or Outer one, in order to ascertain the place of Bäj-dhama: 1. It is generally maintained that a Marätab is necessary for performing the Bäj-dhamä ritual.65 A senior and much respected priest from Navsari,66 representing the oral tradition of yester years, maintains that Bäj-dhamä cannot be performed without a Marätab initiation, because he considers it to be an Inner ritual. The present practice in India corroborates this tradition. However, in India, since the term bäjyo, has evolved for a priest who has not become Marätab, it may mean that somewhere down the line the Bäj-dhamä may have been performed by priests having just the Nävar initiation.67 2. The Panj-täe performance of the Bäj-dhamä, also known as the näni khub, \"the shorter (performance for acquiring ritual) power\"68 forms the basis of all other Inner rituals. Its performance is invariable before the performance of any Inner ritual like the Yasna, Visperad or the Vidêv-dâd, as it imparts the requisite 'ritual power' for the performance of other Inner rituals. 3. In the past few centuries, in manuscripts as well as in printed books, the text of Bäj-dhamä was grouped more often with the texts of Khorde Avesta and Äfringäns than with the texts of the Yasna, Visperad or 62 Bulsara, Aërpatastân and NTrangasIân, p. 127, fn. 4. 63 Bulsara, Aërpatastân and NTrangastân, pp. 380-383. 64 Bulsara, Aërpatastân and NTrangastân, p. 436. 65 Modi, Religious Ceremonies and Customs of the Parsis, p. 197. 66 Mobed Erachsha E. Karkaria. 67 Boyce/Kotwal, \"Zoroastrian bäj and drôn\", p. 67. 68 This is in apposition to the moti khub \"the larger (performance for acquiring ritual) power\" referring to the performance of the Yasna ritual."},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"Vidëvdâd. The former group of texts constitute the Outer rituals, where-as the latter group constitute the Inner rituals. This would prompt one to consider the 'Bäj-dharnä' as an Outer ritual. 4. The division can also be recognised on the basis of the texts for the rituals. Within one group are the rituals which have exclusive texts of their own, and in the other group rituals whose text/texts have been bor-rowed from texts of other rituals. Thus Äfringän Ardäfravas is derived from Fravardên Yast, Äfringän Dahm and Äfringän for other divme be-ings from Yasna 60; Äfringän Srôs from Srôs Yast sar sab I to III; Far-oxsi from Yasna 26, Pazand Dibächeh and Fravardên Yasht; Stum from Yasna 26 and the Pazand Dibächeh etc. However, some Äfringäns like those of Gähämbär and Rapithwin have exclusive texts. In such a classi-fication, Bäj-dharnä would belong to the group of Outer rituals like Äf-ringän, Faroxsi and Stum, because like the texts recited in the above rituals, the text recited in the Bäj-dharnä has also been sourced from the text of the Yasna. 5. All inner rituals use the barsom, and use a drön in its offerings. Both these are also essential requisites for the Bäj-dharnä. If one considers the place of Bäj-dharnä on the basis of ritual requisites, it would have to be in-cluded along with Yasna, Visperad and Vidëvdâd, which are Inner rituals, since none of the Outer rituals utilise barsom or drön as ritual requisites. 6. The Bäj-dharnä, unlike other Inner rituals can be performed by one priest alone, which may prompt one to consider it as an Outer ritual. In the past, however, more than one priest used to participate in the Bäj-dharnä performed for partaking meals.69 Also, there is reason to believe that in the past, the Bäj-dharnä too was performed by two priests: Zöt (officiating priest) and Räsplg (assisting priest).70 There are references in the Nërangestân about there being a 'helping priest' along with the 'leading priest'. There was also a difference of opinion as to whether the 'helping priest' should make the ritual tasting of the drön.7' There are passages where the prayers to be recited by the 'leading priest' and 'helping priests' are discussed,72 as also their positions with respect to the fire.73 These 'helping priests' may have been seven, as described in 69 Modi, Religious Ceremonies and Customs of the Parsis, p. 351. 70 Ms. D-6 at the K.R.

Presently, the performance of Bäj-dharnä is restricted mainly to the ritual precincts where Inner rituals are performed. Even when its associ-ate services of ÄfrTngän, Faroxsi, Jasn and Farestä are performed in places outside the precincts of the fire-temple, the corresponding Bäj-dharnä is performed in the pävis within the fire-temple. Most of the Gujarati books on Bäj-dharnä, brought out in the last cen-tury, have the word 'Päv-mahel' in their title, which means \"rituals per-formed inside specially demarcated precincts\". All other rituals de-scribed in these texts are also Inner rituals, hence here again there is a strong reason to believe that Bäj-dharnä was expected to belong to the group of Inner rituals. 8. Though an essential after death ritual, the Bäj-dharnä is invariably not performed near the precincts of Tower of Silence (Dokhma), whereas its associate services of Äfnngän and Faroxsi can be performed over there.75 9. The period of the day (gäh) in which a ritual can be performed, is also an important indication as to which category that ritual belongs. As a rule, the Bäj-dharnä can be performed in any gäh, though some of its performances are restricted to specific gähs only. None of the outer rituals are performed in the Aiwisruthrem gäh, that is, from sunset to midnight. Though Ms. J4 altogether omits giving the Aiwisruthrem gäh for the performance of Bäj-dhamä, most other manu-scripts give all the five gähs, which means that this ritual, or at least some variations of this ritual, was permitted to be performed at any time, including the Aiwisruthrem gäh. The Nërangestân categorically states that the Drön Yast can be performed into the beginning of the night, that is, in the Aiwisruthrem gäh.76 However, modem Parsi practice avoids the performance of the Bäj-dhamä at this time.77 10.

Considered to be the son of Ahura Mazdä, and closely associated with the divinity of Asa ('Truth', 'Order'), it is always present in the main liturgies and is greatly venerated and respected by the faithful. Temples to the cult of fire, however, do not seem to have been insti-tuted before the late Achaemenid period.1 In none of the most ancient parts of the Avesta are fire temples spoken of, nor has any information in this sense reached us from archaeological discoveries.2 Such references, on the other hand, are plentiful as far as the following Sasanian period is concerned: archaeological testimonies and epigraphic and literary docu-ments testify to the widespread presence of fire temples in this period. Indeed, it is probably just in this period that the Zoroastrian priests gradually developed the differentiation of the temple fires into the three categories, which in the Islamic period were called Ätas Bahräm, Äda-rän and Dädgäh. The distinctions between the three types of fire consist mainly of the different methods that are required for their constitution, consecration and maintenance.3 The ritual for the lesser grade fire, the Dädgäh, is very simple. It is enough to consecrate a single domestic fire, for which no particular 1 M. Boyce, \"Atas\", Encyclopcedia Iranica 1989, p. 1; cf. also M. Boyce, \"On the Sacred Fires of the Zoroastrians\", Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 30, 1968, pp. 52-68. 2 For a presentation of archaeological and literary information on the fire temples in ancient Iran, see K. Schippmann, Die iranischen Feuerheiligtümer (Berlin/New York, 1971). 3 Whatever its grade, however, each fire constitutes a separate entity. It must not be allowed to go out and it cannot be divided up. Moreover, whereas a fire of a lesser grade cannot be raised to a higher grade, as this would require it to be separately estab-lished and consecrated, a fire of higher grade can, should it be impossible to comply with the more complex and demanding prescriptions required by its maintenance, be down-graded."},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"process of collecting or purification is required. After the building in-tended to accommodate it has been purified, by washing it three times with water, the domestic fire is placed inside the temple and this starts off the consecration ceremony that lasts for four days. During the first three days, the priests celebrate a Yasna in the morning and, after mid-night, a Vendidad; with the celebration, on the fourth day, of a further Yasna, the consecration ceremony is complete and the fire becomes Dädgäh. Although the presence of priests is necessary for the consecra-tion, the Dädgäh can subsequently also be cared for by a lay person and does not require the buy dädan ceremony to be carried out, it being enough to make a simple offering of wood and incense,5 or in any case a much less complex form is carried out than that required for the first grade fire.6 For the consecration of the second grade fire, the Ätas Ädarän, four kinds of domestic fires selected from four different social classes, i.e. priests, soldiers, farmers and artisans are required. The individual fires are purified by undergoing a process of nine successive kindlings re-peated three times7 and consecrated by celebrating a Yasna and a Vendï-dâd over them for two days; on the third day, the four fires are combined into one and over this another Yasna and another Vendidäd are cele-brated; the following morning a further Yasna is recited and then the fire is installed in solemn fashion in the temple. An Ädarän can be fed only by a priest and the care it requires is not so intricate or complex as that necessary for the Ätas Bahräm,8 4 The religious service by which the fire is fed daily and which provides, among other things, for a ritual offering, five times a day, of sweet-smelling wood. This ritual prac-tice in India involves the use of sandalwood whereas in Iran preference is given to pomegranate wood, followed by apricot wood or pistachio (M. Boyce, A Persian Stronghold of Zoroastrianism [London, 1977], p. 75). For a detailed description of the ceremony see J.J. Modi, The Religious Ceremonies and Customs of the Parsees (Bom-bay, 1922), pp. 218-226; Y.Yamamoto, \"The Zoroastrian Temple Cult of Fire in Ar-chaeology and Literature 2\", Orient 17, 1981, pp. 93-95. 5 Boyce, \"On the Sacred Fires of the Zoroastrians\", p. 54. 6 Modi, The Religious Ceremonies and Customs of the Parsees, pp. 219-221. 7 The purification process is substantially the same as that for the fires of which the Ätas Bahräm is composed, with a sole difference in the number of times the process has to be repeated: a perforated ladle containing inflammable material is placed, at a certain distance, above the fire until the heat causes the substance to burst into flame; the fire produced in this way is placed next to the first fire and fed. When the preceding fire grows cold, the process is repeated until the ninth kindling. 8 It is not mandatory to keep the fire always burning with live flames, and the priests"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"For the latter, in fact, performance of the whole ceremony of the buy dädan, is required five times a day at the beginning of each of the five periods {gäh) into which the day is divided; the fire is kept burning brightly night and day and the priests who take care of it have necessar-ily to have passed the second degree of priesthood (martab) and have gone through the barasnom and xub ceremonies.9 Only they are allowed to enter the room of the temple where the fire is located and no cere-mony can be carried out or prayer recited that is not in honour of the fire itself.10 As far as the establishment of the Ätas Bahräm is concerned, this ex-tremely long and elaborate ritual consists, essentially, of the collecting, repeated purification, consecration, and final unifying of sixteen differ-ent kinds of fires. THE AVESTAN AND PAHLAVI SOURCES The eighth chapter of the Vendidäd is generally related to the establish-ment procedures of the Ätas Bahräm. Paragraphs 81-96, in particular, include a list of sixteen fires that it is considered meritorious to purify through a process of nine successive kindlings in order then to take them to what is defined by the Vendidäd as the däitya gätu, the 'appointed place'. These are fires, which have been made impure by the particular use that have been made of them, or which in any case are in a state of 'oppression'. The merit to be gained from freeing them or rescuing them is directly proportionate to the degree of impurity, or torment, that they have undergone. In a classification of this type, then, greater merit is to be acquired by rescuing a fire that has bumed a corpse and lesser merit by purifying the fire of one's own hearth. The similarity between this list and the sixteen fires that are used for founding the Ätas Bahräm is con-siderable as we shall see further on, but it seems, nevertheless, that no can also feed the fire with their bare hands. (Boyce, \"On the Sacred Fires of the Zoroas-trians\", p. 54). 9 The barasnom is the major ritual of purification, whose effect lasts until personal or external causes are verified (for example, non compliance with certain dietary rules or entering into contact with impure substances or persons), which would invalidate it. With th exub, which consists of reciting the whole Yasna, the priest acquires the 'ritual power' ( 'amal) necessary for carrying out certain liturgical services; it lasts four days, unless invalidating phenomena occurred earlier. 10 Boyce, \"On the Sacred Fires of the Zoroastrians\", p. 53."},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"direct dependent relationship can be established between the prescrip-tions of the Vendidad and the procedures for establishing the sacred fire. Unequivocal references to the procedures for the establishment of the Ätas Bahräm are contained in a Pahlavi work of post-Sasanian compila-tion that is known as The Pahlavi Riväyat Accompanying the Dädestän ï Dënïg,11 dated between the last part of the ninth century and the first quarter of the tenth. This text, according to Williams,12 contains material that seems to derive directly from knowledge of the Pahlavi versions, both oral and written, of the Avesta, as well as from original material that it is not possible to find in other sources. Furthermore, this may be considered the model on which the later Persian reväyats were based. The Pahlavi Riväyat Accompanying the Dädestän ï Dënïg dedicates part of Chapter 18 ( 18e 1-18e24) to the methods for establishing the Ätas Bahräm, dwelling (18el-l 8e2) above all on the characteristics and the total number of fires to be collected: (In) one place (it is) revealed: \"When someone establishes a Victorious Fire, the greatest possible number of fires which are unprotected and un-tended should be collected by him\" There was an authority who said thus: \"1,001 should be collected.\"13 What follows, then, is a list of fourteen kinds of fire that it is necessary to gather ( 18e6-18e 19) and the laying down of some rules for the main-taining of the fire, such as the offering of fat14 and its feeding with wood and incense (18e20-18e21).

The absence of references to elements that could lead to non-Zoroastrian contexts,19 but above all the reference, in the paragraphs immediately following (18e22-18e24), to a figure that could be identi-fied as a founder of the fire leads us to assume that the first hypothesis is justified. The practice, in fact, of founding sacred fires even by single individuals is widely attested to in the Sasanian period,20 while it is im-probable that it was current practice during the first centuries of the Arab conquest, in a period, that is to say, in which the gradual but inexorable spread of Islam proceeded at the same pace as the destruction, or trans-formation into mosques, of the fire temples.21 THE IRANIAN TRADITION Quite apart from any transmission of a Sasanian practice, the Pahlavi Riväyat certainly had a determining influence on the development of a subsequent tradition on procedures for the establishment of the Âtas Bahräm as this has reached us, above all through the Persian reväyats;22 18 It should be noted that, differently from the texts of more recent tradition, the Pah-lavi Riväyat does not indicate in what quantity each kind of fire has to be taken. 19 In the subsequent tradition it is explicitly prescribed for some of the fires that they should be taken from fires belonging to followers of other religions, probably in the belief that such fires are more oppressed and thus the merit gained from rescuing them is the greater. 20 Cf. Boyce, \"On the Sacred Fires of the Zoroastrians\", pp. 60-65. 21 It was probably at the beginning of the eleventh century that the Zoroastrians were subjected to the destruction of the last great fire temples and of the great collections of their sacred books that still existed.

Involved in these polemics against their will, the Zoroastrians of Iran, considered to be supporters of the Qadimi, were no longer consulted by the Sähänsähi majority of the Parsis. Cf. M.

The use of fires such as those of the Mazdä-worshippers and lightning is openly con-tested by the Ithoter, which also makes explicit the doctrine on which the establishment of the sacred fire should be based: it appears to these humble ones that in the books possessed by the people of India, in relation to the ätas varharäm, in the twelfth place are written forty fires from the homes of the behdins and in the fifteenth place, ninety fires from lighting.

The main difference between the texts of the two Persian reväyats and that of the Pahlavi riväyat lies in the presence in the reväyat of Kämdin Säpur and in the Ithoter, of two additional fires, and there are two elements that give cause to the belief that they have effectively been \"added\": their position at the end of the list, in fifteenth and sixteenth place and, above all, their different characteristics, making them alien compared to the rest of the fires that are all consistent with the doctrine on which the ritual of establishment of the Ätas Bahräm is based, and according to which the fires have to be taken from where they are oppressed or polluted. The presence, at the end of the list, of fires such as that of lightning or fire produced from the friction of wood and flint can be explained, then, only by referring to the classification of fire into the five categories that the Zoroastrian priests developed, probably in the Parthian period, on the basis of the five epithets of the fire shown, in ascending order of dignity, in Yasna 17.11: bdrazi.savah 'of high benefit', vohu.fryäna 'lov-ing the good', urväzista 'the most joyful', vazista 'the swiftest(?)', spdnista 'the holiest'.38 However, what is relevant for our purposes is with what, in the Pahlavi, New Persian or Gujrati texts, the last two fires, the most worthy, are associated: väzist is constantly associated with lightning and spênist is associated without distinction to the material world, to the same Bahräm fire, or even to the fire produced through friction.39 36 Williams, The Pahlavi Riväyat Accompanying the Dädestän IDënîg, p. 9.

THE PARSI TRADITION According to the Parsi tradition recorded in the Qesse-ye Sanjan,42 a work in verse composed at Navsari in 1600 and based almost exclusively on oral traditions, an Ätas Bahräm was founded at Sanjan by the Zoroas-trians coming from Iran a few years after their arrival on the Gujarat coasts in 936. In fact, we do not know with any certainty when this fire was founded or, above all, how it was established. The Qesse-ye Sanjan is rather vague about the procedures carried out for its establishment: In those days, all the arts and industries (lit. workshops) were in the hands of the People of the Good Faith. Things were everywhere easy for them for they had brought along with them all the tools (or means)43 from Khorasan. With all those resources derived from Khorasan, they were able to accom-40 Thus, for the corpse-burning fire the nine successive kindlings are repeated 91 times and a religious service is held over each one for a total of 91 Yasnas and 91 Ven-didäds. The same proceedings, by the number of times listed, is observed for the other fifteen fires. The Parsis, as far as the kindlings are concerned, adopted a different sys-tem: again in the case of a corpse-burning fire, for example, this was subjected directly to 91 successive kindlings.

The reason was that several parties of Dasturs and Laymen of holy lives had also arrived at that spot. In their com-pany were several alchemists also and the favour of the Lord thus made things easy for them. They had brought along with them ample resources and they thus consecrated the Fire according to the dictates of religion.44 It seems that this fire stayed at Sanjan until the city was destroyed by the Muzaffarid ruler Mahmud Begada, probably in 1465, when the priests carried it to safety in the mountains around the city and subsequently to the village of Bansda. During this period of time, which lasted approxi-mately fourteen years, the fire would have been without a fixed temple until it was moved to an appropriate building in Navsari. The promoter of transferring the sacred fire to Navsari was Changa Asa, a rich and influential layman in the city, who also convinced his co-religionists to send the first Parsi messenger to Iran. The reväyat, dated 1478, with which Narimän Hosang made his re-turn to India, is the first historical document from which we can obtain reliable information about Parsi knowledge on the methods of establish-ing an Ätas Bahräm. In this letter are recorded two questions and their relative answers,45 from which the following considerations can be drawn: already before this reväyat, and thus with even more reason before the arrival in India of the subsequent reväyat of Kämdin Säpur, the Parsis were aware that it was necessary to take fires from different workshops in order to establish an Ätas Bahräm-, the Iranian dastur excluded the possibility that the fire of lightning, a fire of high rank, could be used to establish the Ätas Bah-räm. After the reväyat of Narimän Hosang, further and more detailed in-structions arrived from Iran with regard to sacred fires like those con-tained in the reväyat of Kämdin Säpur to which reference has been made above. Despite, however, repeated invitations on the part of the Iranian dasturs to found Ätas Bahräms wherever Zoroastrians were living, no other sacred fire was created by the Parsis until 1765. A direct cause of the decision to found a new Ätas Bahräm in Nav-sari was the dispute that arose between the priests of this city and the priests of Sanjan who had followed the sacred fire to Navsari, on the rights of the latter to celebrate not only the religious services required to take care of the sacred fire, but also all the others that were more remu-44 Hodivala, Studies in Parsi History, p. 106. 45 Dhabhar, The Persian Rivayats of Hormazyar Framarz and others, pp. 62, 63."},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"nerative. The result of this dispute was the decision, on the part of the Sanjan priests, to leave Navsari in 1741, taking away with them the Ätas Bahräm, which was installed in a new temple in the village of Udvada, where it is still to be found today. An account of the founding of this new fire temple at Navsari is found in the Qesse-ye Zartostiän-e Hendustän46 composed by Shapurji Maneckji Sanjana in 1765-90. Here reference is made repeatedly to a volume that was the work of Däräb, and can be identified with the classi-fied reväyat of Däräb Hormazdyär. It was precisely on the basis of this volume of Däräb, and thus probably of the reväyat of Kämdin Säpur that it contains, that, according to this account, the Ätas Bahräm of Navsari was established. This fire was installed only three years before the departure of Mullä Käus for Iran and it is clear that the intention of the Qadimi group to have also their own fire temple was one of the main reasons for the mis-sion.47 The instructions given in the reväyat Ithoter, with which Mullä Käus returned to India, were then used for the Ätas Bahräm founded in 1783 in Bombay by Dady Nusservanji Seth and whose first dastur was in fact Mullä Käus. Apart from the three referred to above, a further five Ätas Bahräms were founded in India, all in the nineteenth century.48 We know the list of the sixteen kinds of fires used for the H.B. Wadia Ätas Bahräm of Bombay.49 For ease of reference, they are listed here, together to those recorded by Dastur Erachji Sohrabji Meherjirana in his catechism of 18 6 950 and by J.J.

In conclusion, it can be said that despite the central role fulfilled by the Ätas Bahräms since the institution of fire temples in the late Achaem-enid period, no information is available on how these fires were estab-lished in the historical period preceding Islam. The purification practices of sixteen kinds of fire described in the eighth chapter of the Vendïdâd are not necessarily linked to the establishment of an Ätas Bahräm, even if it cannot be excluded that these may have been the inspiration behind the subsequent elaboration of the ritual. The first reference to the proce-dures for the establishment of an Ätas Bahräm is found in the Pahlavi Riväyat Accompanying the Dädestän ï Dënïg, compiled in the post-Sasanian period, where the gathering of 1,001 unprotected and untended fires belonging to fourteen different kinds of fire are prescribed. The characteristic of the work and some details of the text cause us to think that this may have been a ritual already practised in the Sasanian epoch, in the period, that is, when the fire temples in all the Iranian territories were most widespread. For the centuries subsequent to the spreading of Islam in Iran, we have no other documentary evidence on the subject, until the taking up again of contact between the two Zoroastrian com-munities of Iran and India. Since the first reväyat of 1478, the Parsis asked questions of their co-religionists regarding the methods of estab-lishing the Ätas Bahräm, to which the Iranian dasturs answered in com-plete fashion with the reväyat of Kämdin Säpur of 1558. This reväyat fully incorporates the list of the fourteen fires of the Pahlavi Riväyat Ac-52 An exception is the \"fire of the king or ruling authority\", which Modi records in the place of the one \"used in public baths\". It is the only occurrence of a fire of this type in a list for the establishment of the Ätas Bahräm. This is even stranger if it is consid-ered that Modi's source is Dastur Erachji Sohrabji Meherjirana. Other lists are given in K.N. Seervai/B.B. Patel, \"Gujarat Population\", Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency (Bombay, 1899), vol. 9, part 2, p. 214 , which records a list identical to that of Dastur Meherjirana and in E.K.

We do not know whether this addition was brought directly by the authors of the reväyat or whether it is linked to a preceding tradition developed, we may hypothesize, in order to make the number of fires tally with the sixteen fires listed in the Vendidäd. In this second case, however, the increase in the number of fires could not predate 1478, the year in which the reväyat of Narimän Hosang was drawn up. In this let-ter, in fact, the Iranian dasturs replied to a precise question from the Par-sis, excluding the possibility that the fire of lightning could be used for the establishment of Ätas Bahräm. The same firmness in excluding the fire of lightning, or in any case, the use of fires that were not oppressed, is to be found also in the last reväyat, the so-called Ithoter of 1773. Already prior to the arrival in India of the 1478 reväyat, the Parsis were familiar with a procedure for the formation of sacred fire, even if we have no information about the level of their knowledge. The tradition that placed the founding of an Ätas Bahräm a few years after their arrival on the Gujarat coasts is based on a text, the Qesse-ye Sanjan, which is historically not fully reliable and in which the description of the proce-dures followed is vague and confused. The reväyat of Kämdin Sapur, on the other hand, had a decisive influence on the forming of the Parsi tradi-tion concerning the ritual for establishing a sacred fire. Even if, over the years, the Parsis brought to it small amendments or adaptations, espe-cially with regard to the kinds of fires prescribed, it is substantially on the basis of the methods recorded therein that the majority of the Ätas Bahräms now existing in India were founded."},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"THE ÄTAS NU GITI A PARSI LAY RITUAL Sarah Stewart INTRODUCTION The surviving religious literature of Zoroastrianism, namely the extant portion of the Avesta, is largely related to priestly matters. As a result, religious traditions that have emanated from non-priestly sources have often been ignored. In this paper I discuss the Gujarati song, the Atas nu Gît, 'Song of the Fire', which celebrates the founding of an Ätas Bah-räm, 'Victory Fire', the highest-grade fire of the Zoroastrian faith. I shall examine the way in which the song works as a ritual within the context of lay devotional life, and suggest that through its structure and content, it functions as a reconstitutive ritual of recital. We are told in the song that it was composed by two brothers, Jeva and Dosa Bharucha; according to oral tradition, it was composed in cele-bration of the founding of the second Ätas Bahräm in India (the first having been founded soon, after the purported arrival of Zoroastrians from Iran in the early 10th century AC), an event that took place in Navsari in 1765. The song is unique in that it was composed by laymen for use primarily within a lay context, and it appears to have acquired a religious status independent of priestly usage. It describes the construc-tion of the agiäry, 'House of Fire', and the formation and consecration of the Ätas Bahräm which is installed within it. According to Parsi tradi-tion, the song with its accompanying ritual has always been performed by women especially trained for the purpose. The stated purpose of the song is to make merit: in the text there are frequent references to the families of those who commission its performance for auspicious occa-sions, such as a wedding or a religious initiation (<naujote),' in order to obtain merit. The explanation is that whoever commissions this song will be given righteousness, good fortune, prosperity, sons, long life and, ul-timately, a place in heaven. It is this aspect of the Ätas nu Gît which sets it apart from other joyful songs of celebration, and transforms it into an ' [Note by the editor: On this ritual, its description and interpretation, see the paper by J.A.M. Snoek in this volume.]"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"act of religious devotion. It is at the same time a prayer, an act of wor-ship and a ritual performance. Jenny Rose and James Russell have, at different times, witnessed and subsequently written about full perfomances of the song,2 and they refer to aspects that highlight its ritual significance. Rose describes the house where a performance is to take place as being decorated in much the same way as the agiäry described in the song: garlands (torans) are hung and chalk marks (rangoli) are put on the thresholds; the singers are wel-comed with the silver tray (sês), and a vermilion spot (tilah) is put on every family member in the household. The performance must take place in the presence of an oil lamp (divo), and incense (löban) must be burnt. At the mention of Ahura Mazdä, the divinities (yazatas) or the Ätas Bah-räm, the singers (göyäns) touch their foreheads in reverence. With the word nërang, 'consecrated cow's or bull's urine',3 the palm of the hand is turned upwards; at the mention of nahn, 'ritual purification', hands are swept downwards in a cleansing motion.4 Russell notes that no menstru-ating woman was allowed to touch the book in which the text was writ-ten.5 Evidently the göyäns leamt their repertoire simply by accompany-ing others, and learning did not start until well after marriage and child-birth, at around the age of thirty-five.6 Traditionally, the Ätas nu Gît could be performed within the precincts of an agiäry as well as within a person's house. Today it is rarely per-formed; however, it is still possible to find households where a hearth fire is kept solely for ritual purposes, and where women sing the song from time to time, particularly when preparing the fire for the Ädar mähinö nu paräb, 'the name-day feast of fire'.7 In a sense, the song 2 J.

The hearth fire, which in my informant, Mrs"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"represents a domestication of the sacred temple fire, in that its ritual re-construction takes place in people's homes as well as in the agiäry. It is thus a tradition that has remained linked to domestic worship and there-fore to women within the community. It was in this context that I first came across it when, in 1989,1 was researching lay devotional practices in Bombay and Navsari. My main informant, at that time, was Mrs Shehnaz Munshi, and it was she who translated the song for me from a printed version of the text, which had been published in 1879. In subsequent visits to India, I have looked at a number of different versions of the song, in particular one dedicated to the Iransäh fire in Udwada which belongs to 4 göyäns, now all in their seventies, who agreed to give a studio recording of the song. The owner of the studio recognised the lead singer as having performed the Ätas nu Gît at his own naujote. He said that his grandmother had commissioned the song for every major family occasion. In another handwritten copy of the song belonging to Mrs Munshi's grandmother, it is said to have been sung in the agiâry on the day of varadhni rit, i.e., the special ceremony that takes place on the third day of wedding celebrations.8 On this day, women make the sacred bread (drön), and they then go to the agiäry for Shehnaz Munshi's kitchen had been specially built and was not used for cooking, was sometimes kept al ight during the whole of Adar mäh (the month dedicated to Fire) oth-erwise it was lit in the Rapithwin gäh (the mid-morning to mid-afternoon watch of the day during spring and summer) of Dëp-Âdar röj (the creator's day before the day dedi-cated to Fire) and kept alight until the Usahîn gäh (the midnight to dawn watch) of Adar röj, thirty-six hours later. The silver ses (tray) was prepared, all the items being cleaned with ash from the fire place. The picture of Zarathustra near to the fire was gar-landed. The words Khsnaothra Ahurahe Mazda \"homage unto Thee, Ο Ahura Mazda\", were written on the tiles of the fireplace in a paste made of turmeric powder and wheat or rice flour; also a picture was drawn of the tongs and ladle in a mixture of vermilion powder and water on the sides of the fireplace. The vermilion powder is held to repre-sent the sacrificial element; Mrs Munshi informed me that at weddings in the old days, the blood from an animal sacrifice was smeared on the bridegroom's forehead. The tur-meric represents the light of the sun. When I saw Mrs Munshi perform this ceremony, a picture of the fire was also painted on the side of the fireplace. Chalk designs, (rangoli'), were put on the floor around the fireplace; either seven impressions were made, repre-senting the seven Amesa Spentas (divine beings), or nine, representing the Amesa Spen-tas as well as Ahura Mazdä and Zarathustra. The fire was then kindled with sandalwood and those standing before it did the kustî(tying and untying the sacred girdle), and recited various prayers. 8 See Ph.

The interesting point about this version is that it is sung as part of a bäj ritual, thus promoting it into an other-wise exclusively priestly domain. I shall focus here on the 1879 text for the reason that its author was evidently preoccupied with the ritual nature of the song and its correct performance, instructions for which are written into the text. Although this version is 'fixed' in written form, its compilation bears the hallmarks of an oral text in the way that different layers appear to have been added. I have suggested that two independent structures operate within this text: the first of these pertains to the way in which the author has organised the text, both recognising its character as an oral text and at the same time allowing for the addition of new material; the second is a thematic structure that reflects cosmological and eschatological ideas. I shall look at the content of the song and then comment on its struc-ture as a means to gain insights into Parsi lay devotional life both today and in recent history. There is much archival and historical documenta-tion about this period from which an account of certain events can be given. The song gives a narrative version of these events: it provides a unique socio-religious commentary and displays the vitality of different aspects of lay life. I shall also draw on some contemporary accounts of religious life in order to illuminate certain customs and traditions alluded to in the song, but which are not described in any detail. Some comments on the use of the term 'laity' are in order. We cannot tell from the ancient Zoroastrian texts what was the precise status of priests, i.e. those who were referred to by the term zaotar or athorvan. There is no indication that the priesthood was a hereditary institution, and one can only guess at the extent to which the rest of the community participated in what, later, were solely priestly rituals. Again, it is impos-sible to draw conclusions, as to the relationship between 'ritual special-ists' and the 'laity'. It is not possible, therefore, to give a clear definition of the term 'priest' let alone that of 'lay' for the early period. In modem times, the priesthood is a hereditary calling that is passed down through the male line. However, members of priestly families, including women (referred to as oosta), and those who choose not to become practising priests (referred to as oosti), consider themselves to be from the priestly class and do not refer to themselves as behdin (lay members of'the good religion'). There are thus further ramifications with respect to the con-cept of laity within modem Parsi terminology. There are few religious observances that are peculiar to the laity alone; while many functions"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"THE ÄTAS NU GÎT. A PARSI LAY RITUAL 447 devolve solely on the priesthood, beliefs and practices which I categorise as 'lay' are almost invariably shared by members of priestly families. When looking at 'lay religion' in modern times, I have included the eve-ryday practices of religious life; these may or may not be reflected in the sacred texts, and may or may not be shared by priests. CONTENT OF THE SONG The song begins with an invocation to go to the fire and introduces the women in the chorus: \"all four of us shall sing: Ο friends let us go to the fire\". This is a short dedicatory section which begins with the names of Dädär Hormazd9 and the prophet Zarathustra, and goes on to name the heads of the families and women of the house who have commissioned this particular performance of the song. This type of dedication is a fa-miliar opening to many Zoroastrian religious texts and shows a willing-ness on the part of the lay composers to observe the accepted form of composition. It is a format which is reminiscent of the dedicatory prayers (snumans) which occur at the beginning of the Niyäyis prayers and which, together with the closing formulae for worship, enclose the main body of those prayers. It is also very similar in form to the pazand]0 pref-ace (Dïbâcha) which precedes all liturgical services and which includes the name of the person for whom the ceremony is being performed, as well as the names of those who have commissioned its service. This dedicatory section ends with a direction to the göyäns, inserted by the author of this particular text, to change the tune in which they have been singing so far and begin the next section of the song. The group of göyäns comprises one leader who chants the text and the chorus who repeat the refrain. There are thus two 'voices' constantly interacting with each other throughout the song. Although there is a dif-ference between the two voices, the voice that is chanting, with few ex-ceptions, is always represented as plural: both the singular voice which articulates the text, and the combined voices of the chorus use the plural form 'we': 9 Referring to Ahura Mazda, the central deity of Zoroastrianism. 10 Late Middle Persian written in Avestan script."},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"\"Let us call the son of the builder and let us get the plan drawn for the agiäry Ο friends let us go to the fire Let us call the son of the painter, and let us get paint for the agiäry Ο friends let us go to the fire\" The 'we' of the individual presumably embodies the united will of com-munity, whereas the group voice of the chorus extols everyone to join in going to the fire, i.e., to maintain that collective/united will. The interlac-ing of the two voices thus works as a repeated assertion of community and at the same time as a narrative. The refrain: \"O friends let us go to the fire\" is both distinctive, repetitive and insistent as a call, gathering people together; it is also a device to bring in all the people of the 'good religion', as it were, 'under one roof. Within a few lines of the begin-ning of the first phase of the song, this refrain is being repeated between each and every line of text, and later, between each and every name. The vocative Ό friends' implies the exclusion of non-friends, that is, those who do not belong to the community, for if they are not 'friends' then they cannot be part of this religion. The line also has another function, namely to keep one essential feature of the song in focus, that is to re-mind people that they must go to the fire. This monotonous and seem-ingly only formal refrain is actually, then, the subtle conditioning of the song, which like many religious texts is self-perpetuating. Thus prosper-ity, happiness and ultimate salvation are all associated with an awareness of going to the fire. The frequent, almost obsessional repetition of the refrain may also demonstrate the dynamic feature of the psychology of a minority mentality: it forever insists in repeating its call to gather people together. At the same time, it is this particular 'voice' which gives the song a soothing, almost hypnotic character. The first stage of the song begins with the laying of the foundation, the building of the well and the agiäry. There is a reference to the family priest and to the sacred garments: shirt (sudre), cord (kusti), hat (topi), mouth covering (padan), and to the donation of money for the estab-lishment of the Ätas Bahräm. It can be seen that most of the song is ac-tually summed up in this opening section together with the introduction. We are told the place where the song is to be performed, the people for whom it is to be sung, the essential requirements for the establishment of fire, and the name of the prophet Zarathustra and also that of the current family priest. This first section is a microcosm of the whole poem."},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"Several lines are devoted to the time at which the land for the agiäry should be purchased, for it is most important that this be an auspicious moment, and various honours are accorded to the astrologer. The juxtapo-sition of the Hindu calendar with the Zoroastrian one shows an awareness of the Hindu majority amongst whom the Parsis are obliged to live, yet at the same time it emphasises the distinctiveness of the Zoroastrian religion. From the subject of time, we move to that of place: the ground is pre-pared by labourers and then measured; gold and silver nails are called for and also two priests for the consecration of the foundation. It is possible here to trace ideas that have been carried through from earlier texts for example, in the Qesse-ye Sanjän lines 205-6, there is a short section de-voted to a description of the Iranshah: \"Thereupon the prince commanded, And endowed the dastur with a pleasant place. Straightaway the Hindu Raja Jädi Räna Had this land cleared on all sides. For three farsangs around the juddins Were removed: no person remained except the Zoroastrians.\"\" Following the foundation of the agiäry, the various people who are to be involved in the building process are invoked. While this is a way of estab-lishing the community, at the same time it is a device used to include the audience in the performance. Everyone in the audience would be able to identify with one profession or another; it emphasises the shared and con-structive nature of the text: through the invocations and assertions of the text, the process of the construction of the building is also the process of the construction of the community. Everyone is free to add their bit to the building of the agiäry and at the same time the song is developed. The text then moves to the construction and decoration of the inner sanctum (ijasne gäh) and to the planting of the date palm, pomegranate tree, jasmine, banana plant and orvar, i.e., to those elements of religious life which will be practised within the agiäry. This is followed by a de-scription of the decoration of the agiäry with leaves, garlands of betel leaf creeper, pearls and drawings of the moon in turmeric powder; it seems likely that all these tasks would have been carried out by women. In modern times, it is customary for women to decorate their hearth fires with a paste made from turmeric powder drawn in the shape of a moon exactly as described in the song.1 11 A.V.W. Williams, Qesse-ye Sanjän, publication forthcoming. 12 See above footnote 7."},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"In the next section comes the subject of the various payments made to all the artisans, the gifts of saris and bangles which are made to their wives, and gifts to the high priests (dasturs). It is not possible to determine the social significance of these payments, but there is no doubt that this is the means by which the hierarchical structure of the community is affirmed in the text. After everything is said to have been built, decorated and paid for, there begins another section that describes the various rituals necessary for the consecration and enthronement of the Fire. The astrologers are called again to determine the time of consecration, and then follows the collection of nërang both for the purification of the whole agiäry and the sacred pre-cinct (hindora) where the yasna, 'act of worship', will be performed. It is interesting here to note that the laity appears to be significantly involved in activities which are normally exclusively the domain of priests, including things for the performance of a yasna: e.g. the pomegranate, date palm, and vessel for consecrated water (kundi), and the 'pair of goats' to produce jTvam 'fresh goat's milk'. The remaining lines of this first stage of the song refer to the böy ceremony of the feeding of the sacred fire with sandalwood and incense.13 The song continues: \"Let us get sacred books from Iran, Ο friend; let us ask dasturs to recite them.\" It is possible that these books re-fer to the Riväyats, in particular to the Riväyat ofKamdin Sapur, which is part of the collection of Riväyats compiled by Darab Hormazdyar,'4 and which, according to the Qissa-ye Zartostian e Hendustän, was consulted prior to the founding of the Navsari Ätas BahrämBy the end of this stage in the song, we have witnessed the entire process of building, deco-rating and consecrating the agiäry. There is a sense of timelessness about this phase of the song for this could refer to any Ätas Bahräm real or imag-ined. We have witnessed an idealised process which begins with Zara-13 The böy ceremony or ritual feeding of the sacred fire takes place five times every day at the beginning of each of the five gähs (divisions of the 24 hours), although the ceremony varies in length according to the grade of fire, in all cases the padyâb-kustï( i.e., the untying and retying of the kusti preceded by ablutions) is performed together with the kusti prayers wh ich include the Khursld and Mihr Niyäyis during the daytime gähs. The priest then goes into the sacred chamber, places one or more pieces of sandalwood on the fire and recites the Ätas Niyäyis-, in the case of the second or third grade fires, Ätas Ädarän and Ätas Dädgäh, the Niyäyis is recited once, but for an Ätas Bahräm it is recited several times. 14 B.N.

The song now moves into real time in the real world which is a place of conflict. Here we have references to historical characters and events (which are documented in other sources), and to geographic locations. Although the refrain continues to be recited between each line, there is now a change of tone, which contrasts sharply with the repetitive quality of the preceding stage which ended with the work of the religion having begun. Now comes a change of humour from that of joyous celebration to one of consternation, and for the first time direct questions are asked: The entire Anjuman is pondering over this ...With what shall we do the acts of the religion.... the acts ofthe Vendidad... acts ofthe ijasne... acts of Srôs ... The Sanjänas were all perturbed. This section is likely to refer to the confrontation and struggle between the Sanjäna and Bhagaria priests which is described in full in the Qesse-ye Zartostian e Hendustän. The solution to this quarrel, which had been going on for some two hundred years, came with the intervention of one Desai Khursed, a member of a priestly family who was a leading mem-ber of the Navsari community and benefactor of the Bhagaria priests. Desai Khursed pleaded the Bhagaria cause with the Hindu ruler of Baroda, whose verdict was that Sanjäna priests should leave Navsari taking their sacred fire with them. Eventually, it was decided amongst the dasturs and herbads and behdins of Navsari, i.e., priests and laymen, that a new Ätas Bahräm should be established. According to the song, the 'new' fire was created withpaiwand (where two or more people link together usually by holding a cord), and then comes a reference to the Khursed Wadi, the Jamsed Bag and the Desai Wadi. These gardens are all in Navsari and would have been the places where some of the fires nec-essary for the founding of the Ätas Bahräm would have been purified. The following section is a ritual of remembrance: \"All these people have gone to the House of Song.\" Thus the text invokes Dädär Hormazd, Jamsed Pädsäh and Rustam Pahlevän; it then moves to take the names of the founders of the four Ätas Bahräms established between 1765 and 1879, that is up until the time of the compilation of our text. In the song there are plenty of references to the 'ceremony of Sraösa', and it is not surprising to find that this divinity plays an important part in the prayer ritual of the agiäry for, according to the Pahlavi books, Sraösa is described as the protector of Fire, both being hamkars of Urdwahist.16 16 Ph. Kreyenbroek, Sraösa in the Zoroastrian Tradition (Orientalia Rheno-Traiec-tina 28; Leiden, 1985), p. 118."},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"In the song, Sraösa is linked with his own bird, the cock. The crowing of the cock at dawn awakening the Ätas Bahräm presumably refers to the rekindling of the fire by priests and also serves to remind people of the Usahin-gäh prayers. There is also a reference to the sacrifice of a goat, which is a ritual not recognised by Parsis today, although there is some disagreement as to when it was abandoned. Thus the conflict between the two priesthoods has been resolved to everybody's satisfaction: there are Ätas Bahräms established in various different places, and now the text reflects on the rewards, both material and spiritual, which will result from such meritorious acts: The Parsis are great doers of good acts ... That good act which he has done will have a spin off on the entire tolah ... The wealth of that person will be well spent... All his wishes will be fulfilled ... He will go to heaven. The third and final stage of the song is about the community. In the first stage society was created in an abstract way with the naming of all the professions. Now this process is repeated and through the naming of in-dividuals, the community is re-established. This is the Resolution, in which the fire, the song and the process is taken into every house. The repetition of names is not only a device to identify or re-create the com-munity, but also to root the religion in every single member of each fam-ily, thereby making the text relevant to every single name. The text continues to celebrate the merit of the whole community, first, by naming the men in the family who are 'very religious', and then the women who bring good fortune. Here we have the personification of the Fire: as in the Ätas Niyäyis, the Fire is referred to as \"Son of Ahura Mazdä\", and it is the Fire which is said to have the power to break mistakes. It is interesting to note here the contrast between these sentiments and those held by the Reverend John Wilson writing some thirty-five years before this publication: Many of my readers, I have no doubt, will be astounded at the blasphemous worship of fire, as set forth in the Ätas Niyayish, which has now been brought to their notice. No translation which can legitimately be made of the Zand, can render this worship in the smallest degree less revolting to the understanding and reason of man... I look forward with joy to the day, when the 'sacred fire' shall no longer blaze on their hearths... and when the fire-temples throughout Bombay and Surat, shall, by their own hands... be levelled with the dust...17 17 J.

It has been possible to iden-tify 19 out of the 33 Ätas Adaräns mentioned in the song from the list of agiärys given in the Bombay Gazetteer for 1901.18 Of these fires, it is noticeable that, with the exception of one, the Ätas nu Gît refers only to those established in the nineteenth century, and mainly in the Bombay area, which suggests that it was the newly found wealth made possible by commerce which enabled this particular form of 'making merit'.

Whereas the introduction encompassed the whole song in the sense that it hinted at that which was to come, the conclusion has a reflexive structure. This is where the text of the song refers to it-self, i.e., to the two brothers who composed it, and to those who were the patrons of the singers. Mention is made of the benefits which are brought by the song to those who commission its performance: \"Seven sons were bom to my Pirojbai, to my sister Sirinbai Dädär Hormazd smiled\"; to those who participate in the singing: \"Whoever sings this song does a meritorious act...\" There is also benefit for those who \"listen attentively\", i.e., the audience: \"Whoever listens to the song of the fire attentively -he will be blessed with virtuous acts\", in other words, the whole com-munity stands to be rewarded by a performance of the Ätas nu Gît. It can be seen that, by virtue of its content, the song works to publi-cise the Good Religion by describing and praising certain activities such as the founding of an agiäry, visits and offerings made to the Fire, and the commissioning and performance of the song; in this way it sets an example to the community, suggesting how people should conduct their lives. The references to the Hindu religion serve to remind people that they belong to a minority group and that their sense of identity, as a group, is an important aspect of survival. By the time this text was pub-lished, the ever present threat of conversion to other faiths had been ex-acerbated by John Wilson in his attack on the religion and attempt to convert Parsis to Christianity. The strength of the faith is reinforced by endogamous marriage; the song emphasises the importance of the insti-tution of marriage by reference to all the married couples, none of whom have 'married out'. STRUCTURE OF THE SONG There appear to be two structures that operate within the text. The first of these refers directly to the 1879 text which structure bears many of the characteristics of oral literature in the sense that the concept of time of-ten appears convoluted. As the actuality of one time becomes the mem-ory of another, it is often very difficult to determine whether the author is referring to his own or past time. In the Ätas nu Gît it seems that material has been added at different periods to what may have been an original"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"corpus. The author of the 1879 text has inserted a number of breaks in the text to allow for directions to be given to the singers; they also serve to make the content of the song comprehensible to the reader who is not witnessing the performance. Whereas meaning can be conveyed in the performance by ritual gestures or a change of rhythm or tune, these have to be written into the text. Most of the breaks in the text are accompanied by a pattern or motif which serves to emphasise the instruction being given by the author. The directions tell the singers when to change the categories of names they are taking, depending upon where the song is being performed and for what type of occasion. Sometimes, the instruc-tion is simply to indicate a technical change in the way the song is to be chanted. In all, there are fifteen breaks which are as follows: 1 ) Take the names of the ladies of the house 2) Change the tune and begin the song 3) Take the names of the marrying couple 4) Change the tune 5) large motif - ladies should sing about the installation of the fire - small motif 6) Ladies - up to now you have sung half the song 7) small motif- take the names of the sons, master or mistress of the house for whom the song is being sung 8) small motif - take the names of the menfolk of the family 9) small motif - take the names of the women and their sons 10) small motif - change the tune and sing with a great lengthen-ing of voice (this section begins with the praise of Ahura Mazda). 11 ) large motif- take the names of the head of the family, son or mistress of the house and their sons, i.e. those people who have consecrated a sacred fire - well known Parsis - small motif 12) Take the names of all the agiärys 13) small motif- take the names of the relations of the mistress of the house 14) small motif - lady of the house takes everyone to the agiäry 15) Take the names of the ladies of the house It can be seen that over half these directions refer to the names of various members of the household where the song is being performed. As such, they create explicit slots which are intended to take different material. In this way, the text demonstrates a high degree of fluidity in that it is open to variation, yet at the same time it has to be highly structured in order to Stage I Stage II Stage III"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"allow this device to work. Then there are implicit slots or occasions where names are mentioned without being flagged by a text break and it may be that they have become 'fixed' in that; for various reasons, these names have entered the main body of the text. Within these sections, changes of theme or differences in 'time', where certain names from the historical past are juxtaposed alongside ones from the 'present', are sometimes marked by the name of Zarathustra. The second structure, I suggest, is thematic in the sense that it refers implicitly to Zoroastrian theological ideas. In other words, while on one level the song tells the story of the founding of an Ätas Bahräm and all that this entails, there is at the same time a level of meaning in which the song is itself an expression or affirmation of the faith. With respect to Alan Williams' work on the Qesse-ye Sanjän (forthcoming), he suggests that the story of this epic journey is primarily a myth that accounts for the transition, both social and geographical, of the Iranian community from Iran to India. It has the characteristics of A. Van Gennep's rite of transition which is constituted by three stages. The Qesse-ye Sanjan falls clearly into three parts: 1) the history of the faith in Iran up to departure, 2) the crossing and intermediary period in Diu and entry to India with its consequent upheavals, and 3) the settling of the community down to the time of composition circa 1600. In developing this idea further, it ap-pears that in the Ätas nu Gît, the role of the community is replaced by that of the sacred fire. As is often the case, the later text refers to the older one: in the Qesse-ye Sanjän, we find the motif for the Ätas nu Gît in the story of the sacred Iransäh, 'King of Iran', the first Ätas Bahräm to be consecrated on Indian soil soon after the arrival of the Zoroastrians from Iran. Later, the fire is forced into 'exile' after a battle in which the Muslim army of Ulugh Khan is triumphant over the joint forces of a Hindu Raja and the Zoroastrians of Sanjän. After several years of itiner-ancy followed by a brief sojourn in the town of Bansda, the Iransäh is brought finally to Navsari and re-established there. It is this account of the first sacred fire which in a sense foreshadows the Ätas nu Gît, in which we have three stages (referred to on p. 455 above): 1) the creation of an Ätas Bahräm, 2) its removal as the result of a quarrel and the estab-lishment of a new fire, and 3) with the establishment of a new fire comes the 're-creation' of society. When a diaspora community has both lost autonomy and homeland, it has been suggested that this double loss conditions its subsequent self-"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"perception as a 'people to be restored'.19 According to Zoroastrian theol-ogy, this restoration or resolution takes place at the end of time when all creation will be restored to its former state of perfection. The state, in Pahlavi wizärisn, is implicitly referred to in the song - as it unfolds, so the agiäry is constructed and the community is re-created. There is another, recurring structural theme in the song which links the terrestrial world to the cosmological world by means ofthe worship-per and the divine, and that is the cycle of petition, offering and reward. The commissioning of the song is a meritorious act: through its perform-ance, righteousness or asa is brought regularly into the world. In the first two stages of the song, we have a repetitive structure which entails the calling or collecting together of people, followed by an activity such as the building and consecrating of the fire, or the performance of ritual, and this in turn is followed by the rewarding of the same people. This is a theme that can be traced back through a number of Zoroastrian texts, beginning with the Yasts where we have the calling of the deities to par-take of the sacrifice, the offering or oblation itself, and the boons which are granted in return. THE ÄTASNU GlT AND LAY DEVOTIONAL LIFE In the final part of this paper, I shall comment briefly on evidence pro-vided by recent accounts of lay devotional life as a means by which to illuminate certain aspects of the song. Some of these accounts form part of an oral studies project that resulted in a recent publication by Philip Kreyenbroek and Mrs Shehnaz Munshi, and in which I took part in its early stages.20 I mentioned at the start of this paper that within the cate-gory of'laity', a prominent role is ascribed to women in theÂtas nu Gît. It is the married women who seem to be accorded the highest status in the song, and they who are mentioned most frequently in the households where the song is performed. This dominant female role is mirrored 'outside' the text in the sense that it is women who commission the göy-äns for a particular occasion, and pay them; women are responsible for the domestic arrangements essential to any celebration. Today, women appear to have a more prominent role in religious life than men. Much of routine daily life involves activity which is either di-19 A.D. Smith, The Ethnic Origin of Nations (Oxford, 1986), p. 114. 20 See Kreyenbroek, Living Zoroastrianism."},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"rectly or indirectly linked to religion, whether it concerns the preparation of food, the keeping of purity laws, the löban 'incense' ceremony, the making ready of the hearth fire for a paräb, or the teaching of prayers; per-haps as a result of this, it is women who are generally responsible for per-petuating what might be termed the more traditional religious observances within the community. Unless lay men are part of some policy-making body such as the anjuman, they do not seem to have a particularly active role as far as religious matters are concerned. Although within the last cen-tury there has been a decline in the authority of the priesthood, a diminu-tion of their status within the community, and a drop in their earning ca-pacity, nevertheless for those who choose to become priests, their role is clearly delineated. Likewise, for those who become leaders within the community, their role is not without status, and their work has a purpose. Others make a name for themselves by endowing a foundation or becom-ing the benefactors of a particular project. However, in day to day religious observance, the majority of lay men whom I met did not appear to have as substantive a role as their female counterparts. One of the aspects of religious life repeatedly referred to in the song is the nature of food offerings, but it is only through talking to people and being present at gatherings (for example a jasan) that one is made aware of the great significance of commensality and the array of differ-ent dishes which are prepared for different occasions. While I was in-clined to discourage conversations about food during interviews, there is no doubt that for many women, when asked to describe the observances around which their devotional lives centred, the preparation of special foods turned out to be an essential part. This was something they spoke about with confidence; it was familiar territory in a way in which the 'meaning' of prayers was not. The preparation of food was, and still is, a way of bringing people together, as it expresses the solidarity of the community in a similar way as a performance of the song. Another aspect of the song which is worthy of comment is the relationship between fire and worshipper. I mentioned earlier that there were other versions of the Ätas nu Gît addressed to different Ätas Bahrâms. This gives these agiärys and the fires within them an indi-vidual character which is in keeping with the way in which people themselves tend to refer to certain fires. The way in which devotional life focuses on one fire rather than another is felt to endow that fire with a 'personality' and make it more of an icon than a symbol. It seems that the agiärys are not so much anchored to a geographic location, but derive their unique character from a particular history or legend which"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"acter from a particular history or legend which may be attached to them. Thus whilst people may refer to the Udwada Ätas Bahräm as being par-ticularly special, it is not so much the agiäry itself as the Iransäh, which was founded in a different place, as well as being itinerant for some years. The attachment to a particular fire, as opposed to its location, seems also to be the case in the Zoroastrian villages in Iran, to judge from the accounts of the Parsis who have visited them recently. While people tend to hold special affection for certain fires (not necessarily the great ones), they will still perform what might be termed 'generalised worship' in any agiäry, the important thing being that they are praying before a consecrated fire. Through listening to people's accounts of religious lives, it emerged that much of lay devotional life continues in the oral transmission of texts and religious observance. While the Parsi community in India now belongs to a predominantly literary culture, this does not mean that liter-acy is necessarily thought relevant to all categories of knowledge. It may, for example, be applied in the schoolroom but not be thought relevant to prayer or religious matters generally. There is a tendency to assume when oral texts are committed to writing that, almost by definition, their contents become more accessible and that people will read them. We know that by the seventeenth century most of the Pahlavi texts had been translated into Gujarati, thereby making them available to all members of the community; however, there does not seem to be any evidence that these texts were widely read, other than by priests. It emerged through talking to people that for many, the meaning of prayer was not directly related to a literal understanding ofthe words. Several people mentioned the importance of pronouncing the sounds of the Avestan words cor-rectly, and the manner in which the prayer was recited, with the correct breathing. For those who pray from a book, the translation is often pro-vided alongside the text of the prayer, but this was not mentioned as forming a significant part of the meaning. One might consider here what the content of a Yast or a Niyäyisn would convey: the imagery of these ancient hymns and prayers are not easily transposed to contemporary life, nor do they contain much that can be identified as Zoroastrian in terms of doctrine or theology. The most important element, it seems (whether or not a person was praying in a language which he or she under-stood), was the power attached to the prayer. There were numerous occa-sions when people described some event or circumstance in which the strength of prayer alone was seen to have achieved a desired goal. This attitude towards prayer accords well with the perceived efficacy of a per-"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"formance of the Ätas nu Gît, the stated purpose of which is to make merit. Also, it explains the preoccupation on the part of the author of the 1879 text to ensure that it was recited properly, for it was the way in which peo-ple were reciting it with which he found fault and wished to correct. CONCLUSION Through the brief exposition of this complex text, it is hoped that the reader will gain an insight into the way in which the recital of the Ätas nu Gît can be viewed as a religious ritual by virtue of its content and structure, and with reference to contemporary devotional life. It remains to situate this particular lay ritual within the context of the religious tra-dition and I suggest that the function and purpose of the song is to recon-stitute or re-establish both society and the 'Good Religion'. Insofar as the song appears to have originated in connection with a local event, it seems possible that the affirmation of the community refers, in the first instance, to the conflict between the Bhagaria and Sanjana priesthoods. In this way, it works to heal the divisions of the past and establish a new hierarchy and social order after the civil strife of the dispute. In a wider context, the formal cataloguing of all the artisans and trades people, priests, and members of households is the means by which the song assembles the community, both literally and symbolically. A recital of the Ätas nu Gît is thus not only a ritual re-enactment of the construction of an Ätas Bahräm, but also a way in which Parsi religious identity is reaf-firmed. This is a social re-creation of the world; the song gives us an in-sight into both rural and urban life, social events, domestic and priestly rituals, historic episodes, and personalities both real and fictional. The way in which the song is structured allows for the re-estab-lishment of the fire after a period of conflict, thus implicitly acknowledg-ing Zoroastrian theological ideas. Finally, the domestic rituals described in contemporary accounts of lay life demonstrate the way in which the song can be recited as part of a ritual reconstruction of the sacred fire within a domestic context. It is through the fire that the song acquires a liturgical focus."},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"PREJUDICE VS. REALITY. ZOROASTRIANS AND THEIR RITUALS AS SEEN BY TWO 19TH CENTURY ITALIAN TRAVELLERS Carlo G. Cereti Though endowed with a vast and interesting literature dealing with Iran —rather: with a western representation of the Iranian world—mainly linked to a never forgotten interest in classic antiquity,1 an important part of which deals with Zoroaster,2 it is only in the 20th century that Italy developed Iranian studies as an independent field of research. Among the pioneers were the philologist Angelo Lignana (1827-91), who had studied under Christian Lassen and Friederich von Spiegel, and Italo Pizzi (1849-920), who translated the Sähnäme in verse.3 Thus the two reports about the Parsis which shall be discussed in the present article, though written by two scholars, Angelo De Gubernatis and Paolo Mantegazza, whose main interests lay outside the field of Iranian studies, are among the earliest witnesses of an interest in the Zoroastrian com-munity in modern Italy. Therefore, though both accounts are found in works that best classify among travel accounts, it was thought worth-while to draw the attention of the reader to these little known exposés, in that they provide some insight in the approach of the European general public to Zoroastrianism in the late 19th century, as well as a somewhat interesting picture of the Bombay Parsi community. The two authors with whom we are dealing have played a significant role in the cultural life of late 19th century Florence.

Among the Zoroastrian objects is a complete set of ritual implements which were donated by Dastur Jamshedji Jamasp Asa to the Italian count. Some years ago, while preparing a survey ofZoroastrian manuscripts in Italy, I came across a small collection of Zoroastrian manuscripts, re-ported by Unvala,6 but now unfortunately lost, which counted among the possessions of the \"Museo Indiano\"7 and took a more general interest in the personality of its founder. From further research on the activity of De Gubematis, it soon became evident that the greater part of the Indian ar-ticles preserved in this museum was collected by this scholar and his col-league and antagonist, Mantegazza. Both scholars had visited India in the later part of the 19th century and both, once landed in the subconti-nent, had become acquainted with the Parsi community of Bombay. The first to reach the Indian town was Paolo Mantegazza (Monza 1831 -Lerici 1910), a physical anthropologist who was the first to hold a uni-versity chair in Anthropology in Italy, his chair being grounded in 1869 at the Istituto di Studi Superiori di Firenze. A few years later, between 1881 and 1882, he traveled to India with the main aim to visit the Todas in the Nilgiri area,8 but, as most travellers in that period, he landed in 4 See M.

It should also be remembered that De Gubernatis was the teacher of Francesco Cannizzaro, who in the early years of the 20th century translated the Widêwdâd10 as well as a correspondent of many of the leading Iranists ofthe time, among whom one, L.H. Mills, took to the study of the Pahlavi language while serving as Junior Rector of the American Church of Florence from 1875 on. De Gubernatis, as well, reached India through Bombay and included a chap-ter on the Parsis in his Perenigrazioni indiane.u Once landed in Bombay in 1885, De Gubernatis was taken under the protective wing of the learned Dr. Gerson Da Cunha who, among other things, introduced him to the Parsi community. Quite differently from that by Mantegazza, De Gubernatis' description of the Zoroastrians is acute, though not without prejudices. In the following pages the chapters which the two authors have writ-ten on the Zoroastrian community will be presented side by side, in order to show which were the characteristic traits most apt to strike a traveller in those days. The different personality of the two scholars should also be taken into account. As we have seen, one, De Gubernatis, was an Ori-entalist and an Indianist, a disciple of Max Müller, more at home with books than with the living tradition; the other, Mantegazza, had no spe-cific interest in India, if not as a field of application of his anthropologi-cal theories.

In this outlook, the Parsi traders played an important strategic role.

Proof of this is that twenty one of forty nine founding members are Parsis.12 In fact, both authors mention the commercial capabilities of the Parsis and, probably influenced by this parallel, as well as by some contempo-rary trends, compare the Parsis to the Jews. Thus De Gubernatis speaks of the Parsis saying: Se il Gujarat è una delle grandi porte, una delle grandi chiavi dell'India, puo dirsi che quella porta, quella chiave trovasi principalmente nelle mani de'Parsi. Essi fiirono chiamati gli Ebrei dell'India, per le grandi somiglianze fisiche e morali che presentano con gli Israeliti; ma non portando in sé stes-si il marchio délia persecuzione occupano sulla scala sociale un grado più alto degli infelici dispersi figli d'Israello.

If this is true it might well be said that that doorway, that key is firmly in the hand of the Parsis. For their great physical and spiritual resem-blance to the Israelites, they have been called the Jews of India. However, since they have never suffered persecution, on the social scale they are situ-ated higher than the unhappy, scattered children of Israel are. It has been said that they are the descendants of one of the ten tribes, but without any proof. It is certain that they come from Persia; but in Persia, more than anywhere else, in Afghanistan, in Baluchistan, in Panjab and in Kashmir it is common to find people who though belonging to the Jew physical type speak an Aryan language and follow Aryan customs [...] The clear relation which has been established between the dualism, the Good and the Evil principle, in conflict, as they are manifest in the ancient Judaic religion and in that of the Magi, which has become that of the Parsis, demonstrate the original community and possibly even identity of the race of the ancient Parsis with that of the ancient Jews. Following this general and fundamental criterion I believe that many ethnological problems, which until now have defied us, may have hope to find a possible solution.... Mantegazza, driven by his profession as physical anthropologist and his belief in Darwin's evolutionism, remarks that the Parsis: Son bianchi, pallidi e presentano due tipi, uno che chiamerei 1 'esagerazione del tipo giudaico, l'altro grasso, tondo, bonario. Le loro donne più che mai rammentano la bellissima fisionomia delle nostre più belle ebree, dall'occhio nerissimo, grande e sensuale, dai denti di perla. Ho veduto qualche fanciulla Parsi, che avrebbe fatto impazzare un santo e a cui non avrebbe saputo resistere neppure il Sant'Antonio del nostro Morelli. Non è solamente nella fisonomia che i Parsi assomigliano assai ai nostri i-sraeliti. L'analogia délia loro storia con quella di questi li ha ravvicinati an-che nel carattere. Essi infatti sono avidissimi di denaro, laboriosi, vani, ma differiscono nella smania di spendere essendo non avari, ma prodighi.14 They are white, pale and present two different types, one, which I would call the exaggeration of the Judaic type, and the other fat, round and good-natured.

They are greedy of money, industrious, vain, but they differ from the Jews in that they are not stingy, but prodigal. Further, both authors observe that Parsi women are much more free and independent than Hindu and Muslim ones, but if Mantegazza limits him-self to the fleeting remark, De Gubernatis further states that though as a rule beautiful, Parsi women share with their men a general feebleness of body, a trait that will be remarked upon—with some exaggeration—by some modern anthropologists.15 As is to be expected, both scholars were interested in the Parsi tradi-tional dress as well as in the practice of wearing the kosti and the sedr . As a consequence of this interest, the collection of different Indian gar-ments part of which used to be in the possession ofthe Museo Indiano in Florence, and which now belongs to the Museo Nazionale di Antropolo-gia e Etnologia preserves a number of specimens of Parsi clothing. The description made by Mantegazza is somewhat detailed,16 while 15 \"Basta vedere come uomini e donne Parsi camminano, come facilmente si sdraia-no, come a pena hanno acquistata una certa agiatezza si fanno scarrozzare, per com-prendere che, se I'ingegno dei Parsi è vivo e l'animo suo generoso, la sua natura fisica si è alquanto effemminata.

As a rule both men and women are pale and tend to fattiness, which slows down their movements]; De Guber-natis, Perenigrazioni Indiane, p. Ill; in more recent times cf. T. M. Luhrman, The Good Parsi.

Thus De Gubematis says: Le donne Parsi hanno bellissimi capelli neri, ma poco si vedono, poiché come un Parsi che si rispetti non deve mai deporre il suo berrettone ο sco-prirsi il capo, cos! il capo di una donna Parsi dev'essere sempre coperto di un velo bianco, detto mathabana, simile a quello delle monache, sormonta-to dall'elegante sarri, lungo sei yardi, che le fa pure da manto e da tunica.18 Parsi women have beautiful black hairs, but these can seldom be seen, since just as any respectable Parsi should never drop his hat or uncover his head, so should the head of a Parsi woman be always covered by a white veil, called mathabana, which is similar to the one worn by the nuns, topped by the elegant sarri, six yards long, which serves both as a mantle and a tunic. Whereas Mantegazza recalls that: \"I Parsi attribuiscono una grande im-portanza ad una piccola calotta, che portano sotto il turbante, e al cuoio che deve trovarsi sotto la pianta dei loro piedi\" [The Parsis accord great importance to a cap, which they wear under the turban, as well as to the leather, which should be under the sole of their feet].19 Today this cus-tom is not felt any more as mandatory, being followed only by members no solo gli uomini.

Their turban is the old Hindu Khirkidar, which once was worn in the whole North India and which nowadays may be sometimes seen in Calcutta. Today the Parsis wear on their skin a shirt of very fine muslin, which is called sadrà, the most sacred part of it being the small pocked placed near the neck which they call gerian, vernacular form of the Per-sian girivan which means 'neck'. It is said that it be a symbol of the armours that they were forced to leave, but it is probably an error, since even the Avesta speaks of the sadrà. The Parsis also consider very important the kusti, an interwoven cord made of 72 woollen threads which is sanctified by prayer six times a day, and which is worn both by men and women. Maybe it is a memory of the Brahminic paità, which, however is worn only by men. This cord bears a knot, which may be untied while praying and which keeps evil away.

How-ever, in the late 19th century the debate was flaring, as we learn, among other, from a letter written by Gerson da Cunha to De Gubernatis in 1883: The Parsees of Bombay have two important subjects of social and religious matter on the topics for discussion. One is whether the Zoroastrian doctrine allows his followers to go bare headed, and the second whether a dead body can be carried in a hearse, or must be always conveyed to the Tower of Si-lence on the shoulder [...] of the Parsees called Nasasalars, who stand to the other class of the Parsees in the same relation as the pariah to the Bra-hman.2\" Turning to the aspect that interest us most in the present context, it should be said that among the many Parsi religious customs, both Mantegazza and De Gubernatis report mainly those which are apt to strike most European imagination. However, De Gubernatis' narration contains a few elements which again reveal a better knowledge and un-derstanding of the community than that by his colleague. Quite on the contrary, Mantegazza's description is more impressionistic, though, as we shall see, it may preserve some interesting trait. As to be foreseen, both authors were struck by the funeral ceremonies of the Parsis and by the Towers of Silence. However, while De Guber-natis provides a sober description of the death rituals, Mantegazza in-dulges in a very colourful description which only very partially corre-sponds to reality. The latter author begins his narration by describing the garden where the Dakhmas are built, a funerary procession of the Parsis and the Towers themselves: Una magnifica strada sui Malabar-Hill fatta tutta a spese di Sir Iamshidji Ji-jibhoi vi porta sopra l'alto d'un colle, dove sopra una porta misteriosa leg-gete: Qui nessuno fuori che i Parsipuö entrare, e che vi mette in un giardi-no incantato, pieno di alberi splendidissimi e di fiori, e dove nessun cattivo odore vi fa ricordare che in quel luogo centinaia di cadaveri son distrutti dal becco e dagli artigli degli avvoltoj e dei corvi.

In quel recinto vi sono cinque torri: la più grande costa 30,000 sterline, le altre minori ne costano in media 20,000. La maggiore è alta 25 piedi ed ha una circonferenza di 276.

Nella più interna si pongono i cadaveri dei bambini, nella mezzana stanno le donne, e nella più estema i maschi adulti. È là che si depongono i cadaveri affatto nudi, gli uni accanto agli altri. Appena uno di essi è messo nella Torre, i mille avvoltoj e corvi che stanno sugli alberi vicini, vi si pre-cipitano, e in meno di un ora lo riducono in scheletro, che poi il sole e la pioggia imbiancano. Quando non rimangono più che le ossa, i sacerdoti con pinze e guanti le precipitano nel pozzo, dove si dice che le ceneri vanno al mare trascinate dalle piogge e dalle correnti sotterranee.

The door introduces you into an enchanted gar-den, full of most beautiful trees and flowers, where no unpleasant smell re-members one that in that place hundreds of corpses are destroyed by the beak and the talon of vultures and ravens. The view that you may see from that en-chanted garden is one of the most beautiful of India. At your feet lays the whole eastern part of the island, the huge city with its towers and monuments, and between you and the city a feast of coconuts hiding in its emerald waves the poor houses on the Indians. Being lucky, you may have the occasion to see a hundred Parsis climbing the dead men stairs two by two accompanying a bier. Near to the bier are two men with a long beard, the only ones allowed to enter the towers. They wear gloves and only touch human bones using long pliers. In that enclosure there are five towers: the largest costs 30,000 Pounds, the smaller ones 20,000 Pounds in average. The largest one is 25 feet tall and has a circumference of 276 feet. At a height of eight feet from the ground there is an opening in the tower, which is to be reached by a masonry stair counting a few steps. Inside, a platform, which cannot be seen from the out-side, is divided in three concentric areas with a pit in the centre. In the inner-21 The reference is to the nasa-salar. 22 Mantegazza, India, pp. 74-75."},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"most area are placed the corpses of the children, in the middle one the women, and in the outermost adult men. There the corpses are laid one by the other, naked. Once that one of them is placed in the Tower, the thousands of vultures and ravens which roost on the nearby tress rush forward and in less than one hour reduce the corpse to skeleton, which will be whitened by sun and rain. Once that nothing is left except for bones, the priests with tweezers and gloves throw them into the pit where it is said that the ashes will reach the sea carried by rain and underground streams. These human ashes grow in the pit so slowly, that in forty years they build only a five feet high layer. Both Mantegazza and De Gubernatis share an uneasy feeling faced with the peculiarity of the exposition of the dead body to the birds of prey. The former says: La prima domanda che si fa un europeo, visitando le Torri del Silenzio, è que-sta: come mai un popolo cosi intelligente e fino come i Parsi lascia divorare i propri morti dagli awoltoi e corvi? Come possono essi vedere senza orrore quegli uccellacci appollaiati sui tamarindi, obesi di came, senza pensare che essi stanno forse digerendo le cami tenerelle del proprio bambino, ο il cuore della mamma? - Essi vi rispondono: gli elementi sono santi e non devono es-sere polluti dal contatto della came umana, che è impura. Il cadavere umano non deve esser bruciato, perché il fuoco ne sarebbe contaminate); non deve es-sere sepolto perché la terra ne sarebbe sconsacrata; non deve essere gettato nel fiume ο nel mare, né lasciato imputridire a ciel sereno, perché né l'aria né l'acqua devono divenime impure. Dunque il corpo umano passa dall'uno all'altro organismo, e si compie la parola di Zoroastro, il quale ha detto che la morte deve riunire poveri e ricchi. Infatti il primo milionario di Bombay è de-posto nella Torre accanto all'ultimo mendicante, e lo stesso pozzo travolge nello stesso abisso le ceneri di entrambi.23 The first question that a European visiting the Towers of Silence asks himself is the following: \"How can an intelligent and refined people such as the Parsis leave its dead to vultures and ravens\"? How can they observe without horror those fowls roosted on the tamarind trees without thinking that they might be digesting the tender flesh of their own child, or the heart of the mother? -They answer: The elements are holy and they should not be polluted by con-tact with human flesh, which is impure. The human corpse cannot be burned, since it would pollute the fire; it should not be buried, since the earth would thereby be desecrated; it should not be thrown in a river or a sea, nor left to rot in the open air, since neither water nor air should be polluted. Thus the human body passes from one to the other organism, and Zoroaster's word is fulfilled, in that he said that death should unite the poor and the rich. In fact the richest 23 Mantegazza, India, p. 76."},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"millionaire is placed in the Tower side by side with the humblest beggar, and their ashes gather in the same pit. Quite similar are the comments by De Gubematis: La cerimonia era semplice e grave. Ma una madre nostra non reggerebbe di certo all'idea di abbandonare le spoglie della sua creatura alio strazio certo che ne faranno in breve i sordidi corvi ed avoltoi; cio che si consuma nelle flamme va bensi perduto; ma il freddo orrore della morte non vi fa almeno schifo; il pensare invece che una parte del vostro sangue, delle vostre carni, che le vostre forme predilette vanno a perdersi ignobilmente nelle fauci vo-raci d'animali ingordi che verranno poco dopo a digerire il paäto infame sul tetto stesso della vostra dimora, ripugna talmente a tutti i nostri sentimenti morali ed estetici che mi meraviglio grandemente della tenacità con la quale gli odiemi Parsi tanto ingentiliti custodiscono la loro usanza, e mi fa viva-mente desiderare che i loro teologi dimostrino non dommatica la necessità del dokhma, perché si possa dare ai loro estinti una più decente e gentile se-poltura.24 The ceremony was both simple and grave. However, one of our mothers would never accept the idea to abandon the mortal remains of her child to be torn to pieces by filthy ravens and vultures. What flames consume is nonetheless lost, but the cold horror of death is less disgusting, yet to think that a part of your blood, of your flesh, of your beloved forms may be igno-bly lost in the voracious jaws of greedy beasts which shall soon digest the infamous meal perched on the roof of your own house, is so repugnant to all our moral and aesthetic feelings, that I wonder greatly about the tenacity with which today's refined Parsis cling to their custom, and I keenly hope that their theologians may demonstrate that the need to use the dokhma is not dogmatic, thus that it may be possible to bury their dead in a more de-cent and gentle manner. However, what is more striking about the report by Mantegazza is the long final passage on the funerary customs of the Parsis. According to this researcher, in case of death the Parsi moum for days and days: I funerali dei Parsi, ο paternas, sono i più tristi che possano vedersi, ma og-gi vi è una reazione contro l'eccesso dei loro pianti. Figuratevi che per un bambino si deve piangere quattro giorni, per un adulto nove. Il pianto e i gemiti durano dalle 9 antemeridiane alle 2 pomeridiane, e si piange e si ge-rne dalle donne della famiglia, dalle loro parenti vicine e lontane, dalle vici-ne e dalle amiche delle amiche. Le visite di condoglianza giungono in casa del morto per tempo, aspettando l'ora del pianto, che è annunziato da un 24 De Gubematis, Perenigrazioni indiane, p. 137."},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"primo gemito del capo piagnone, che in note alte e basse si lamenta, pic-chiandosi il petto con colpi cosi forti, che si possono udire anche nella via. Gli uomini stanno al di fuori silenziosi. Le donne invece, piangendo l'una dopo l'altra, devono raccontare le virtù dell'estinto, le vicende della malat-tia, gli sforzi dei medici curanti, le ultime volontà del morto. Tutto ciô si canta fra lamenti e singhiozzi, terminando ogni detto con una monotona e-sclamazione a guisa di ritornello e poi scoppiando in un accesso di lagrime e di singhiozzi isterici. Ogni piagnone deve parlare per 10 ο 15 minuti al-meno.25 The funerals of the Parsis, or paternas, are the saddest to be seen, but today there is a reaction against the excess in crying. Imagine that for a child you should mourn four days, for an adult nine days. Mourning and crying begins at nine in the morning to end by two in the afternoon, and it is the women of the family, their near and far relatives, their neighbours and the friends of the friends who are called to moum and cry. The those who visit to express their condolence come early to the house of the dead person, and wait for the time set to moum, which is announced by the first wail of the chief moaner, who laments in high and low notes, hitting his chest with such strong blows that they may be heard even on the outside road. The men stand outside, silent. The women, instead, crying one after the other, must describe the virtues of the departed, the vicissitudes of the illness, the ef-forts of the doctors, the last will of the dead person. All this is sung while mourning and moaning, and every sentence ends in a monotone exclama-tion, as if a refrain, followed by a burst of tears and hysterical moans. Each moaner must speak for at least 10 to 15 minutes. This peculiar tract is not confirmed by De Gubernatis who, quite on the contrary, speaks of a ceremony which is both \"simple and solemn\".26 It should also be remarked that coherently with the entire Zoroastrian priestly tradition, lamenting is assigned to the fifth unhappy land in Widëwdâd 3.11, a passage which inspired a similar one found in the Dädestän I Mënôg I Xrad (VI, 13) which lists the land where there is much lamentation and weeping as the tenth unhappy land. Moreover, the 57th chapter of the Ardä Wiräz Nämag describes the punishement suf-fered in hell by a woman who mourned and grieved. That the question was still felt in the 19th century is demonstrated by a Gujarati catechism, written in 1869, which strongly condemns the habit of mourning for a deceased one.27 25 Mantegazza, India, pp. 89-90. 26 De Gubernatis, Perenigrazioni indiane, p. 137. 27 Cf.

Mantegazza speaks of a growing reaction against this custom: Non tutto è poesia nei riti sacri dei Parsi. Essi hanno un culto nefando per l'orina della vacca, che chiamano nirang. Con essa si aspergono il volto ogni mattina, nelle loro preghiere, e se ne spruzzano anche durante il giorno qualora una seconda purificazione fosse necessaria.

Not everything is poetry in the holy rites of the Parsis. They have a nefari-ous cult for cow urine, called nirang, which they use to besprinkle their face every morning, during their prayers, and also to besprinkle themselves dur-ing the day if there arises the need of a second purification. When the nirang is not available it can be substituted with goat urine and, if even this is lacking, with lemon juice. The growing generation, however, reacts against this urinary cult. During his stay in Bombay, Angelo De Gubernatis was invited by Dastur Jamaspji Jamasp Asa, with whom he had had previous contacts by letter, to assist to a Zoroastrian marriage ceremony. While conversing with Ja-maspji's son, Firuz, De Gubernatis asked his learned host about the nirang: [...] io approfitto dell'occasione per domandare al dastur Firoz quanto di ve-ro si trovi nell'opinione che i Parsi non pure nelle loro cerimonie sacre, ma anche ne' loro cibi facciano grande uso d'orina di vacca. II buon dastur sor-ride compassionevolmente alia strana domanda; nega in modo reciso che la cosa stia cosi; l'orina di vacca dice riserbata a rari casi di solenne purifica-zione, ne' quali per mondare l'interno del corpo, poche gocce del sacro u-more vengono inghiottite; del resto, soggiunge l'accorto prete, che vuole scagionare i Parsi d'ogni sospetto d'idolatria, dell'avere i nostri padri scelto nelle purificazioni l'orina di vacca si adduce pure una ragione medica; l'orina di vacca contiene molto acido, e questo acido serve mirabilmente a purgare, a ripulire, a mondare il corpo umano da ogni suo umore maligno. Gli lascio credere che mi contento della spiegazione, e non domando altro.29 Century Catechism with Modern Commentary (Studies in World Religions 3; Chico/ California, 1982), pp. 83-84. 28 Mantegazza, India, p. 83. 29 De Gubernatis, Perenigrazioni indiane, p. 132."},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"I take profit of the occasion to ask to Dastur Firoz if the common opinion that the Parsis use cow urine not only in their holy ceremonies, but also in their food corresponds to truth. The good Dastur smiles compassionately at the curious question. He denies that this opinion correspond to reality say-ing that cow urine is used only in rare cases, when solemn purification is re-quired. Then, to clean the inside of the body, a few drops of the holy hu-mour are swallowed. The sagacious priest, wishing to acquit the Parsis of any suspect of idolatry, adds that: \"anyhow, the choice by our forefathers to employ cow urine in purification is justified also by a medical reason. Cow urine contains much acid and this acid is quite useful in purging, cleaning and washing the human body from any malignant humour\". I let him believe that I am happy with his explanation, and ask no more. De Gubematis' doubting attitude towards the rational explanation given by his host is a typical trait of his character, and also in other occasions he does not accept the rational argumentation through which the reform-ist part of the Parsi community tries to justify its beliefs. Moreover, if one takes as parameter the descriptions that the two authors make of these two aspects of the Zoroastrian cult which may appear as the most striking and loathsome to 19th century westerners, it is easy to see how De Gubematis' description is much more rational and trustworthy than the impressionistic picture drawn by Mantegazza. However, though some aspect of the report written by the latter author may largely draw on second-hand knowledge, the information he gives about the custom of mourning the dead might rather be a witness of a popular custom, not accepted by the clergy nor, as far as we can see, by Zoroastrian tradition. Popular religiosity is, moreover, the subject of a long paragraph by De Gubematis, who describes the Parsis praying out in the open for long hours: Chi arriva a Bombay ed esce dal Watson Hôtel per i prati dell'Esplanade che si distendono sino alia marina ο percorre l'Hornby Row è colpito dal gran numéro di devoti Parsi che in varie attitudini, isolatamente, stanno, ne' loro abiti bianchissimi, mormorando in pubblico le loro preghiere ο leggen-do trascritto in modemo carattere gugiarati il piccolo Avesta in lingua zenda che non capiscono più affatto. Rimangono talora, nella stessa attitudine, delle ore intiere; chi non puô uscir di casa s'affaccia alla finestra, e stando con la finestra aperta prega verso il sole che nasce ο tramonta. I meno vaghi d'ostentazione pregano nel santuario della casa, innanzi al fuoco domestico, altri si raccolgono presso i templi del fuoco, mettendosi in fila sulle panche a sedere con le gambe incrociate e per lo più con un piede ignudo incrociato"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"sul ginocchio nella mano; altri s'accoccolano a terra coi ginocchi sconcia-mente aperti, e le mani congiunte; altri fanno di un albero il loro altare divi-no e all'albero sembrano rivolgersi per ottenere da Dio l'invocata protezio-ne. II Parsi non intende più il testo delle antiche preghiere che recita; sa tut-tavia che la sua preghiera ha la virtù di scacciare il demonio, il genio tene-broso, il genio del male, e di rendere propizio il genio del bene, il genio lu-minoso, Dio creatore e conservatore di tutte le cose buone [...] In nessuna religione forse si prega più lungamente che in quella dei Parsi; è una mor-morazione vaga di parole incomprese, una lettura materiale in un libro inte-so soltanto più da pochi dotti, ma molto venerato dal popolo. Dal principio alla fine delle preghiere, l'animo, la voce dell'orante rimangono sempre as-sorti; egli non s'interrompe da sé; ma, se qualcuno passa, con cui abbia af-fari, nulla impedisce che egli si fermi un istante per ricordare al viandante il piccolo affare che gli sta a cuore, per rammentargli il piccolo debituccio di cui aspetta il pagamento, per fargli un saluto se amico, ο lasciargli correre dietro una piccola impertinenza se malevolo. Tutto ciô non guasta la santità della religione, né l'efficacia stessa della preghiera; perché la preghiera è potente in sé stessa, e, se si dice tutta, il beneficio è sicuro. Cosi, ritornan-dosi a pregare cinque volte al giorno, i più devoti tra i Parsi consumano ta-lora orando da sei ad otto ore [...].30 Whoever arrives to Bombay and leaves of the Watson Hotel to walk through the Esplanade lawns which stretch to the marine, or goes along Hornby Row, is struck by the number of Parsi believers who stand in vari-ous attitudes, isolate in their white clothes, and openly murmur their prayers or read the Khorda Avesta in the Zend language, which they understand no more at all, transcribed in the modem Gujarati character. At times they stay hours in the same attitude. Those who cannot go out from their homes stand by the open windows, praying towards the rising or setting sun. Those who are less eager to appear pray in their home sanctuary, near the domestic fire; others gather near the fire temples, sitting in a line on the benches with crossed legs, mostly setting a naked foot on the open hand laid on the other knee, still others squat down on the ground with their knees obscenely open and the hands joined; others again make an altar out of a tree and appear as if turning to the tree to obtain the wished protection from God. The Parsi understands no more the prayers he says. He knows, however, that his prayer has the virtue to drive away the devil, the dark spirit, the evil spirit, and to propitiate the good spirit, the light spirit, God the creator and pre-server of all good things [...] Possibly in no other religion one prays as long as in that of the Parsis; it is a vague murmur of words which are not under-stood, a material reading in a book which is only understood by a few 30 De Gubernatis, Peregrinazioni indiane, pp. 105-106."},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"learned ones, but which still is much venerated by common people. From the beginning to the end of the prayers, the soul and the voice of he who prays are always absorbed, he never interrupts himself, but if someone with whom he has to do passes by, he sees no obstacle to stop for a moment in order to remind to the passer by the small business which he may care for, or to remind him the small debt still awaiting to be paid, to greet him, be he a friend, or to utter an impertinence at his back, be he a foe. All this does not ruin the sanctity of the religion, nor the efficacy of the prayer itself, be-cause the prayer is powerful in itself and if said completely the benefit is as-sured. Praying thus five times a day, the more devout among the Parsis spend six to eight hours every day in prayer... As already mentioned, De Gubematis was a long time correspondant of Dastur Jamaspji Jamasp Asa, and, once in Bombay, he was invited by the learned Dastur, head of the She(he)nshai faction of the Parsis, to as-sist to a ceremony expressly organised for the visiting scholar at a \"Parsi club\". The service performed was in all probability the Yasna, limited to the Paragnä: Sul pavimento, nel mezzo della sala, s'era, con la cenere, tracciato un ret-tangolo, ad indicare il sacro recinto. Tre tavolini figurano tre basi di pietra; sopra uno di essi, è un vaso di métallo, contenente il fuoco sacrifïcale, sul secondo un pajuolo contenente acqua; sopra il terzo si lavano e si purifica-no, prima di adoperarli, i singoli strumenti sacri. Presiede la cerimonia un dastur molto erudito nelle cose avestaiche e molto intelligente; disgraziata-mente per me egli parla solo il gugiarati [...] Egli leva, da prima, una picco-la brocca contenente acqua di fonte, e la versa nel pajuolo ripieno di acqua, per purificarla. In quell'acqua vengono tuffati tutti gli utensili sacri, che si lavano e purificano ad uno ad uno, recitando per ciascuno speciali preghie-re; si legano quindi, con una foglia di palma divisa in sei fili, intrecciati fra loro come una cordicella, i 21 beresman purificatori di métallo (simili a piccoli aghi da calza), che si collocano sopra due sostegni di métallo, di cui le due estremità superiori sono voltate a semicerchio e figurano la luna fal-cata. Fatta, con le relative formole, la purificazione degli strumenti, inco-mincia la vera e propria cerimonia deWhoma, destinata, nel suo primo in-tendimento, a rinvigorire, ringiovanire, fecondare la vita de' devoti. Purifi-cato il mortaio e il suo pestello, scongiurato lo spirito maligno, battendo col pestello, come con un batacchio, di dentro e di fuori il mortaio, come fosse un campanello, il prete prende il legno homa, versa un po' d'acqua purifica-ta nel mortaio, vi depone Y homa, e lo pesta per fare uscire un po' di succo; un anello sacro, probabile simbolo del disco solare, dopo essere esso stesso purificato e legato, viene adoperato come suggello della cerimonia. Pestato Y homa, l'acqua che ne raccolse il succo vien fatta passare per una scodella"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"a nove buchi, entro un vasetto, dal quale il sacerdote, libando, beve. II legno homa da cui fü estratto il succo, deve finalmente essere buttato nel fuoco e bruciato insieme col sandalo e col belzoino.31 On the floor, in the centre of the room, a rectangle had been drawn with the ashes, to symbolise the sacred enclosure. Three small tables represented the three stone bases; a metal vase, containing the sacred fire was placed on one of these, on the second one a pot containing water; on the third the single sacred implements are washed and purified before use. In charge of the ceremony is a very intelligent Dastur learned in Avestan matters. Unfortu-nately for me, he only speaks Gujarati [...] First of all he rises a small pitcher containing source water and pours it into the pot containing the wa-ter, in order to purify it. All the sacred implements are dipped in that water. They are washed and purified one by one, while reciting special prayers for each of them. Thereafter the 21 purifying beresman made of metal (similar to small knitting needles) are tied together by way of a palm leaf divided in six threads, which are intertwined into a string. They are put on two metal props of which the upper part is turned upwards and represents the lunar crescent. Once that the purification of the implements is completed with all needed formulas, the most genuine part of the homa ceremony begins, being thought, at first intent, to reinvigorate, rejuvenate and fecundate the life of the believers. Having purified the mortar and its pestle, exorcised the evil spirit, hitting with the pestle, as if it was a clapper, the inside and the out-side of the mortar, as if the latter was a bell, the priest takes the homa wood, pours a bit of purified water in the mortar, puts in the homa, pounds it to obtain some juice. A sacred ring, probable symbol of the solar disc, is em-ployed as seal of the ceremony. Once pounded the homa, the water which received its juice is filtered by way of a bowl with nine holes into a vessel from which the priest, libating, drinks. The homa twig from which the juice was extracted should in the end be thrown in the fire and burned together with sandal and benzoin. Other interesting details reported by De Gubernatis, but not to be found in Mantegazza's account, are, to my mind, his observations on the social structure of the Parsi community, remarking that the community, though wealthy, retains a deep interest in spiritual matters and his comments on the theology and cultic practice of the Zoroastrian, of which he has knowledge, in all likelihood, through the She(he)nshai faction. About the social structure he says: 31 De Gubernatis, Perenigrazioni indiane, pp. 128-129. On the rite itself, see most recently F.M. Kotwal/J.W. Boyd, A Persian Offering.

Ε evidente che la cura degli interessi ma-terial!, promossi con tanta intelligenza dai Parsi, non li rende indifferenti al-la conquista del mondo dello spirito, nel quale essi vedono saggiamente la ragione, il principio e il fondamento ideale di tutti i loro beni terreni. Né a chi vegga ed ammiri il grande svolgimento delle costruzioni nella città di Bombay, sarà inutile il conoscere che in una città di oltre 723,000 abitanti, ove i Parsi sono una sola quindicesima parte, sopra ottantaquattro ingegneri civili, si contano trentatre Parsi. I Parsi sono pur lieti di riconoscere che su circa dieci mila mendicanti nella città di Bombay la statistica segnalô appe-na sei Parsi, che fra le numerose prostitute indigene non si segnalô una sola donna Parsi, e che la mortalità tra i fanciulli Parsi è minore che fra gli altri fanciulli indiani.

To prove even more the spiritual capacity of this people, I shall add that Bombay counts one hundred and forty one male Parsi teachers and thirty-four female Parsi teachers. By this, it becomes quite evident that the care for the material interests does not make them in-different to the conquest of the spiritual world, in which they wisely see the ideal reason, principle and fundament of all their material goods. To him who sees and admires the great development of building in the city of Bom-bay, it may be useful to know that in a city that counts 723,000 inhabitants of which only one fifteenth are Parsis, out of eighty-eight civil engineers thirty-three are Parsis. The Parsis are also happy to know that out of the ten thousand beggars reported in the city of Bombay, statistics only marked six Parsis that among the numerous indigenous prostitutes there is not a single Parsi woman, and that among Parsi children mortality is lower than among other Indian children. And still it cannot be said that Parsis are the hardiest among the Indians, nor that Parsi women are the healthiest among Indian women...

Noi dobbiamo ora accettare tali spiegazioni degli odiemi dastur come sincere ed autorevoli, per indicare la riforma religiosa che si opero nel seno dell'antica religione zoroastrica; ma il mitologo che ha letto l'Avesta, non puô certo persuadersi che Mithra, il dio solare tanto celebrato, tanto venerato dagli antichi Persiani, non fosse per sé stesso un vero e proprio nume, e che perciô il primo culto zoroastri-co, come il primo culto vedico non fosse politeistico. S'affermô quindi sempre più il principio dualista, e la figura divina di Ahura Mazda in oppo-sizione alla figura satanica di Anhro Mainyu, diventô sovrana, onde la teo-logia zoroastrica riusci finalmente ad un alto monoteismo; ma ciô non toglie che, nelle prime origini del culto, come in molte delle superstiti pratiche su-perstiziose dei Parsi, si trovino indizii numerosi del politeismo popolare so-pra il quale la fede zoroastrica si creô e si mantenne.34 Living in India, the Parsis took from the Indians many of their domestic and religious customs, but the more learned among the Parsis of our times deny that the their true religion, may consist of such practices, since it is not idolatrous, but rather based on the worship of one only God who is the sole creator and benefactor of the world. They explain the worship of the fire as follows: we do not worship the fire as God, but rather as a mean to propiti-ate the Supreme Being, as a symbol of the divine light and as a perfect puri-fier. Moreover, we look at the sun as the most luminous manifestation of God, but do not believe the sun to be God. Nowadays, we must accept the explanation of the modem Dasturs as both sincere and authoritative, and depending on the religious reform which operated within the ancient Zoro-33 It should, however, be understood that De Gubernatis uses the definition \"antica religione zoroastrica\" to mean the pre-Zoroastrian religion of the Iranian people. 34 De Gubernatis, Perenigrazioni indiane, pp. 110."},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"astrian religion. But the mythologist who has read the Avesta, can never be persuaded that Mithra, the solar god who was so venerated and worshipped by the ancient Persians, was not an independent deity, and thus that the ear-liest Zoroastrian cult was not polytheistic, just as the earliest Vedic cult. Thereafter dualism established itself more and more, and the divine figure of Ahura Mazda became sovereign in opposition to Anhro Mainyu, and as a consequence Zoroastrian theology attained in the end to a lofty monothe-ism. Nonetheless, in the earliest attestations of the cult, so as in many of the surviving superstitious practices of the Parsis, one may find countless clues which hint to the popular polytheism from which the Zoroastrian creed was born and developed. To conclude, we may well say that both the description of the Parsi community by Mantegazza and the one by De Gubematis reflect the in-terests of the respective authors, providing an insight on the picture of the Parsis that the western—and here specifically Italian—general public had in the late 19th century, and on the manner in which two scholars, pioneers respectively in the field of Anthropological and Oriental stud-ies, described the community. From the point of view of modem Zoroas-trian studies we may well say that interesting as they may be, the two reports provide scanty new material on the religious practice of the community itself, by then quite well known to western scholars."},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"MANEKJI ON THE RELIGIOUS/RITUAL PRACTICES OF THE IRANIAN ZOROASTRIANS: AN ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF A PASSAGE FROM HIS TRAVEL REPORT IN GUJARATI (1865) Marzban Giara / Ramiyar P. Karanjia / Michael Stausberg* INTRODUCTION [MSt] Although he is hardly known outside the Zoroastrian community, Manekji Hoshang Limji Hataria (1813-1890) is one of the main actors on the stage of modern Zoroastrian history.1 As is well known, in 1854 Manekji, an experienced traveller, was sent to Iran as the first emissary of the 'Society for the Amelioration of Poor Zoroastrians living in Iran', a Parsi organization founded some two years earlier in Bombay. In Iran, this organization came to be referred to as the Anjomän-e akäber-epär-siän, the 'Society of the Parsi nobles'. The many achievements of Manekji and this organization in Iran in improving the living conditions and the political circumstances of Iranian Zoroastrians—most impor-tantly the abolishment of the poll tax (yezye) in 1882—are extensively discussed in the literature. Apart from helping to improve the general ('secular') living-condi-tions and the educational level of the Iranian Zoroastrians, Manekji also made a strong impact on the religious establishment. Undoubtedly, Manekji did much to strengthen the traditional ritual infrastructures. Thus, on behalf of the above-mentioned society Manekji had a good number of ritual structures repaired and furnished with requisites and items needed for the performance of rituals; thus, he arranged for a good supply of necessary goods such as wood and oil in order to safeguard the functioning of the temples. Moreover, Manekji arranged for festivals, initiations, and weddings to be performed, and got prayer books and rit-ual garments distributed. However, all this is clearly more than a simple * I wish to express my sincere gratitude to the Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung (Bonn) for generously sponsoring my work on Manekji's travel report and its translation. 1 On Manekji see M. Stausberg, Die Religion Zarathushtras.

Manekji's many links to Iranian religious dissidents may be worthy of note in this context.3 In retrospect, it is clear that the improvement of the living conditions of their Iranian co-religionists never did gain a top position on the impressive list of charitable projects endowed by wealthy Parsis, and occasionally the whole project was severely criticized in India. Manekji, in tum, tried to convince his critics and to steer enthusiasm for further projects. After some years of service to the above-mentioned society, Manekji drew up a report on its activities. This report was printed and published in 1859.4 In 1863, after a stay of almost eight years in Iran—interrupted by one year that he had spent at Baghdad—Manekji returned to Bombay, while his son Hormuz Manekji Hataria stayed behind in Iran. As a later report on Manekji's activities published in 1871 states, after Manekji's return to India in 1863 tremendous efforts were made to find a replace-ment for Manekji, but to no avail. Even advertisements in newspaper brought no results. Eventually it was decided to once again entrust the work to Manekji.5 A new agreement was drawn up, and in 1865 Manekji returned to Iran where he was to remain until his death. While Manekji was staying in Bombay, the 'Society for the Amelio-ration of Poor Zoroastrians living in Iran' called for a Special Meeting that took place at the residence of its secretary, Seth Merwanji Faramji Panday, on 20th March 1864—the eve of the Iranian New Year—with over 100 Parsi gentlemen attending.6 At this meeting Manekji read out a lengthy report. Together with some other materials, this speech was to form the bulk of the first 18 out of 22 chapters of a book that Manekji published the next year (1865; 1234 Y.). 1,500 copies ofthat book, enti-tled An Essay on the Account of a Voyage to Iran (see below) and printed at the Union Press in Bombay, were published.7 2 See also Robert Langer's paper in this volume. 3 See Stausberg, Die Religion Zarathushtras, vol. 2, pp. 199-200. 4 A typed English translation (77 pp.) entitled \"A Report on the Charitable Institution Set up to Ameliorate the Condition of Poor Zoroastrians in Iran\" is located at the K.R.

After his discussion of the Iranian Zoroastrians' work as farmers, messengers, peddlers, and traders [p. 16], Manekji states: [p. 16] Fifthly [...] despite their condition and enduring a thousand calami-ties and remaining labourers in worldly affairs, yet according to the religion, they have preserved their way of life in five other matters so well that we cannot fail to be happy. Therefore, there is hope that from the following de-tails the Parsis of India will better their welfare by selecting to follow the Iranians and by arranging the marriage of their children and dress of their women and children, as well as festivals, jasans, [p. 17] birth of children and rituals for their dear departed, etc. This passage clearly states the rationale behind Manekji's attempt to support the religious practices of the Iranians, for he plainly regarded these as constituting the core identity of the Iranian Zoroastrians. He ex-plicitly states what was to be done: weddings were to be arranged, the attire of their women was to be safeguarded, and their festivals and life-cycle practices were to be strengthened. Remarkable throughout is his enthusiasm for the ritual practices of the Iranians, which he clearly per-ceived to be the 'original' Zoroastrian ones—and as such, he recom-mended them to his Indian audience as an example worthy of emulation. By supporting the Iranians, Manekji seems to suggest, the Indians were to remain true to their own religious heritage. In order for the Indian Parsis to appreciate the Iranians' \"way of life\", as he puts it, he provides a detailed description of what he felt were five of its crucial aspects: their marriages and weddings [pp. 17-39], the women's garments [pp. 39-42], their festivals [pp. 42-46], their prac-tices concerning pregnancies, child-birth, infancy, and menstruation [pp. 46-48], and, last but not least, their funerals [pp. 48-52], An English translation of this entire passage is given below. Manekji's description is important for several reasons. To begin with, from a historical perspective, Manekji's book is unique in that it contains contribution to the JamshidSorush Sorushian Commemorative Volume (\"Manekji Limji Hataria and the Rediscovery of Ancient Iran\"). 8 Manekji always uses the ('ethnic') term 'Parsis' even when referring to the Iranian Zoroastrians. This corresponds to a widespread usage."},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"the first description provided by an insider/outsider.9 Manekji's position is exceptional in that, as an Indian Parsi, he had full access to the ritual practice of the Iranians. Thus, contrary to the Western travellers' reports, Manekji provides a first-hand and an insider's perspective, and his descriptions are based on long-term observations 'in the field'. Manekji must also have observed one and the same ritual being performed in dif-ferent locations.10 On the other hand, though, as an outsider (an Indian in Iran) he did not just take things for granted but had to become familiar with a semi-alien set of practices. This situation is clearly mirrored in the way he organizes his descriptions. Manekji thus provides remarkably detailed, clear and full accounts of the practices that he has observed in Iran. Occasionally, he even discusses the prerequisites and consequences of the practices he is describing. For instance, in his description ofthe weddings, far from describing only the core ritual, he discusses the proc-esses of matchmaking, the criteria of eligibility, and basic rules of inheri-tance, thus allowing for unique insights into the Iranians' 'mentality', 'ethos', and 'habitus'. Although he occasionally comments on priestly practices, these are beyond his primary focus, and this is not surprising, for Manekji himself was not a priest (and had his share of troubles with the Iranian priesthood). In this way, Manekji's account is also an impor-tant testimony to lay ritual practices, and he mentions several rituals and parts of rituals that are not attested in priestly sources. Manekji not only describes what he sees, but occasionally he also comments on what he describes. As in the report as a whole, these com-ments address his Indian listeners (and readers), and they vividly show Manekji in his unique position on the border between Parsi and Iranian Zoroastrian cultures and in his double role of interpreter/reformer. Manekji's comments may thus serve different purposes. Sometimes he tries to explain the background and the social conse-quences of what he is describing in order to make his readers/listeners bet-ter understand what he is describing. Occasionally, he may even express his own feelings. For instance, Manekji mentions that the observation of a particular practice (such as the drinking of wine [p. 45]) made him happy. 9 Manekji was not the first Parsi to participate in Iranian rituals. For instance, a letter from Torkäbäd mentions that the Parsi messenger Behdin Bahman Aspandyar had under-gone purification rituals, respected the purity rituals, served the first-grade fire and went on a pilgrimage while staying at Torkäbäd, see B.N. Dhabhar, The Persian Rivayats ofHor-mazyar Framarz and Others. Their Version with Introduction and Notes (Bombay, 1932), p. 593. However, Bahman Aspandyar has left no description of these rituals. 10 His descriptions, though, are synthetic, i.e., they abstract from specific settings."},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"Sometimes, he comes up with positive statements about the Iranians. Thus, he repeatedly praises instances of the Iranians' family life [p. 33]. He draws an almost romantic picture of the 'unity' of husband and wife [p. 34], and even addresses his Parsi audience by suggesting that the man who does not make his wife happy is \"lost\" [p. 35]. Repeatedly, he comments on the Iranian Zoroastrian women: They are \"understanding and patient, faithful and obedient to their husbands\" [p. 39]; he also praises the \"indus-trious\" character of the Iranian women, drawing a sharp contrast with the \"ladies of our community\" (the Indian Parsis) [p. 46]. Here, his report contains an explicit critique of the Indian Parsi com-munity. In other instances, a sharp critique against Indian customs is ar-ticulated in an implicit fashion. To begin with, this concerns financial aspects of the wedding arrangements, for instance, when he comments on the low costs that the groom and the bride had to incur for their wed-ding in Iran [p. 34], or when he praises the Iranians for not demanding a dowry [p. 34].\" Moreover, it seems that he implicitly objects to the In-dian practice of entrusting infants to wet nurses [p. 48], On the other hand, Manekji occasionally presents an outright critique of some Iranian customs. Invariably, this is the case when it comes to the Iranian practice of ritually killing animals, and he even has his own ideas as to how this practice, that was hard to reconcile with his ideas about religion, has crept into the community [p. 51]. Moreover, he explicitly deplores that the Iranian priests did not know the 'meaning' of the texts they were reciting when they did perform a wedding [p. 31], Sometimes Manekji comes forward with speculations about historical origins. This may have positive connotations like when he opines that 'hurrah' was a borrowing from Iran [p. 21] or when he suggests that the practice of the youngest son staying in the parental home and taking care of the rituals for the parents may be \"very ancient and ideal\" [p. 35]. However, this sociogenetic approach may also serve the purpose of ex-plaining why something that strikes him as strange is as it is (like the fact that the bride is not acting herself during the wedding, which Manekji suggests is a borrowing from Islam [p. 32]; the same explanation is given for polygamy [p. 39]). * 11 However, he also describes the practice of making 'gifts' [p. 33] as well as fixing the 'Meher-o-NTkä' [pp. 31 and 35]. In the Reväyat, the question of settling the mahr is also discussed, see Dhabhar, The Persian Rivayats, pp. 196-197. In one instance, the mahr is here equated with nekäh- 'dowry'."},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"As already mentioned, the part of the book containing the passage trans-lated below, was first presented by Manekji as a speech. That is why, in the book, the text continuously appears as a quotation (from the speech). Obviously, Manekji did not make any efforts to revise the text in order to enhance its literary quality. In the translation, an attempt has been made to preserve Manekji's particular style. At the same time, the syntactic structure has been somewhat altered in order to make the text more ac-cessible to modem readers. Mostly, these changes consist of breaking down very long sentences into smaller units. As he was talking to a Parsi audience, Manekji uses ritualistic terms familiar to his audience. As any attempt to replace them by English words invariably leads to questions of accuracy and consistency, these terms are kept (without the use of diacritics), but a glossary is appended. Many of Manekji's observations (like the high marriage-age he is giving) would invite comments, but it was felt that providing a commentary would have made the text too long.12 It is therefore left as it is, in the hope that it may catch the read-ers' interest and that the translation may be useful for further scholar-ship. 13 TRANSLATION An Essay / On the Account of a Voyage to Iran / that is / A Report on the Summary of the Travels in the Country in Iran / Prepared in the Service of the Mazdayasnan Anjoman which has come and settled in India, and for all learned Readers / Prepared by / and Printed and Published by / the Humble Traveller Manekji Limji Hoshang Hataria / Printed at the Union Press in Bombay! 1234 Y. 1865 A.C.

If the boy's parents are wealthy but the boy is not industrious, nobody will give a girl in marriage without con-sideration to such a boy, and no girls are willing to be the wife of a lazy boy who sits on a pile of unearned wealth. Similarly, a girl should be able to spin, weave or stitch, embroider or farm the land and be able to make her own clothes. Only then is some boy willing to marry her. Be-cause the custom is that every girl, after going to her husband's house, must be able to make her clothes out of the money earned by her own efforts, and to cut, design, stitch and wear her clothes. After girls attain a minimum of 15 to 20 years of age, and boys attain a minimum of 20 to 30 years of age, they find their own mates. If the parents wish to get their children married, they ask their children or in-quire through another person, and after many discussions and much counselling obtain their consent. The work of making a match is not done by parents using their authority or command, but is left to the wishes of the children. Together with the adverse conditions and the cold climate this is one of the reasons why many girls are spinsters till the age of 30 to 40 years; and several boys are bachelors even at 50 to 60 years of age, because only when they can run their family well will they marry. A boy and girl think of getting married after reaching maturity and achieving confidence in their ability to maintain themselves. Those whom they love, the boy and girl keep secret. The boy very often makes rounds near the girl's house to catch a glimpse of her. [p. 18] Similarly, if the girl is in love, she sees the boy on the pretext of some work. Thus their behaviour is noticed by neighbours and relatives and the rumour is spread that NN and NN love one another. When it is known that both are willing, the parents or elders of both make enquiries about one another's family. If one of them finds the other family not suitable, they explain the reasons to their child. Thus, the young ones listen to their elders and out of respect for the family, they change their desire. If the unmarried boy or girl, one or both, do not have parents living, they seek the consent of their close relatives, and consider their advice beneficial. For, in such a situation, to follow the advice of parents and elders in the family is like following the will of God. If both families like one another, then they"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"help fulfil the desires of their children and take pleasure in seeing them married. Marriageable young people fall in love if they find their life-partners among their cousins, such as the children of their maternal or paternal uncles or aunts who are a match in their behaviour, temperament and age. On reaching the age of discretion, their mutual love increases and they tie the knot of matrimony. If they can find a close relative, they do not seek matrimony outside the family. When a boy and girl find their mates according to their own wishes, and the parents and family like the choice, then they make enquiries about one another's family on various matters publicly as well as in private. [p. 19] First, they pay greater attention to the family name or surname by which it is known and the reputation of the whole family, because the surname runs in the family from father to son for a long time. If any per-son has a blemish, the whole family's name is tarnished and no one would readily give their daughter or son to such a family, for instance the Mahoshuri family has been detested for twelve hundred years. Secondly, the reputation of their parents, their occupation, and more importantly, whether they are creditors or debtors. This is because in Iran, a father's debt must be paid off by his sons, and one relative's debt will cause the creditors to harm the other relatives. Thirdly, in what company of friends does the boy move about, with which friends the girl meets, and what is the reputation of these compan-ions. More attention is paid to this because the behaviour of young men and women is generally affected by the company they keep. Fourthly, they carefully check what is the boy's occupation and how industrious and well-paid he is, for he has to maintain his family and raise children. Similarly, they make detailed enquiries as to the behav-iour of the girl and how talented she is in her own work, because she has to earn for herself, look after the house, maintain peace and understand-ing in the family and educate her children. Fifthly, which relatives in both the families have been converted, and their condition and reputation. For many of those converted to Islam are unworthy, and their relatives will suffer the harm that comes from this. Sixthly, apart from the public appearance, whether either have any diseases or not and their state of health generally, [p. 20] That is checked thoroughly because all family members hope that children bom to them will be healthy, courageous, hardworking and strong."},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"After making all those enquiries both sides separately meet the vil-lage headman, the chief of their street, and also the dastur and seek their advice as to whether the boy and girl have been committed to marriage elsewhere. If there is no other objection, then they give their consent. Thereafter, for the first time, five to nine married ladies from the boy's family carry in their hands a plate containing two lumps of sugar, a little sugarcane plant, a sweet called säkar-paneer in the shape of a fish, a few dry dates, kismis (currants), dry fruits etc. The plate is covered by a green silk handkerchief and taken to the house of the girl who is to be engaged. The säkar-paneer sweet and a lump of sugar is given to the bride-to-be, the sugarcane plant is given to the girl's mother, the other lump of sugar to the girl's father, dry fruits to the girl's brother, sister, aunts and other close relatives by name, all these the girl's family re-ceives as a gift and gives in return respect to those ladies, sprinkles rose water on their face, shows them their face in the mirror, serves a glass of sharbat and gives each one of them a flower or fruit and sends them back with their hands full. One to two weeks after the sweets from the boy's house reach the girl's place, a cap, a handkerchief, a woven bag, like a money purse, a pair of petäva (ankle socks), are taken for the boy from the girl's house and given to the boy. The same day the girl distributes the gift of sweets and dry fruits that were received by her relatives and friends and declares her en-gagement; and both sides give the village headman and also the chief of their street and the dastur lumps of sugar and declare the engagement. It is well-know to everybody that this exchange on both sides is considered as lighting the lamp which is called näm jad [zad] sud [shud], that means the boy's and the girl's name have been fixed. From that time onwards, the girl's name is taken with that of the boy in all ceremonies. [p. 21] After the above ceremony on the first day of the celebration (jasan), the boy takes a pomegranate and makes small holes in it and pierces it, in the form of a map, with 7 to 33 rials, that is the local cur-rency, which is about half a rupee in value. Moreover, some sweets are placed in a handkerchief that has come from his in-laws. Accompanied by his father, uncle, brother, etc., he takes with him about 7 to 15 men and an equal number of close female relatives and the handkerchief. To-gether, they go to the girl's house, also taking with them shoes and a sil-ver ring. After reaching the girl's house, the women join the ladies of the house, the men mingle with the men, and they sit down on opposite sides. Next, rose water is sprinkled and a mirror is shown, then the girl"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"stands or sits a little aloof from everyone else, the boy himself goes to her side and personally gives her the decorated pomegranate and sweets in the presence of all. Thereafter, the ladies from the boy's side put on the shoes on the girl's feet, and the ring on her finger. At that time, it is said that lady NN has put her feet into the shoes of behdin NN (co-religionist) and became his wife. On this being said, all men raise shouts of joy, putting their hands on one another's necks and three times calling out loudly, \"häbhrö\" (Listen! Listen!). Then the master of ceremonies replies \"säbäs\" (Well done!). Know that the Europeans exclaim \"hurrah\" at all happy functions. This word, I guess, must have been borrowed originally from the Irani-ans (\"häbhrö! häbhrö!\"), and the same word is used also by the Russians. I think this word must have entered their vocabulary from the early Ira-nians or Tartars. The word säbäs which the behdins say in reply must originally have been \"säd bäs\", meaning, \"may you be happy\", but with the passage of time, the'd' has been dropped and 'sä' only is retained, so it seems. After the girl has put on the shoes and the ring, her parents and the elders of the house [p. 22] put on a cap on the boy's head and the men accompanying him. Then they all sit down for a meal. Food is served according to each one's choice, which will certainly include grape syrup, curd and wine, so that through this engagement our mouths may be sweetened and our souls purified by happiness. Such a ceremony is per-formed in order that that couple may endure forever. Thus, after the en-gagement, on every celebration and festivity, the boy, on his own and without any invitation, goes to his in-laws' house, and takes along and gives to the girl some sweets, dry fruits and, as mentioned earlier, puts some silver coins in a pomegranate or orange or apple. Then, if the mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother or sister-in-law are at home, the boy has a meal with them and returns. So, too, when the first winter after the engagement arrives and the first snow falls, the boy sends 5 to 7 maund of nän (bread), which would be 35 to 50 pounds, and about 10 pounds of til (oilseeds), halwä (sweet) for the girl's father, and brother. Then they have a meal with the one who brings these items. Afterwards, they drink wine and send him back. Similarly, when there is a festival, the girl goes to the fair (melä) with her friends and close relations, then the boy also goes with his friends and personally presents to the girl in the presence of all, 3 to 4 metres red silk cloth, various sweets, almonds, grapes, pistachios and dry fruit."},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"Then, after the boy and his friends sit and have a meal, the girl presents the boy with a money purse woven by her. Thus, through this exchange of gifts, all persons from the villages assembled at the fair may know that they have become engaged. Thus, by reciprocal exchange, the engagement is fixed and love and affection between the boy and girl increases [p. 23] and in such a way at least a year passes. But, if one party is in poor health or of advanced age, then the engagement and marriage are finalised in ten to twenty days. If on the other hand, due to some misfortune, obstacles arise, as much as five to seven years may elapse. When the time of marriage arrives, preparations are made for a sepa-rate house and according to their capacity, a house is built or bought or rented. If they cannot afford this, then they make such provision for a few days, until another house is found. Or, if there is only one son, then preparations are made for marriage in the parent's own house. But if a separate house can be provided, that is ideal. The day of marriage is determined by both sides who get together and agree to one of the thirty days in a month; but the period of the first three months after Jamsedi Navroz during spring season is best. After this, marriages are preferred during the three months of summer, but in the three months of autumn, no marriages are performed; if there is urgency, then as a last resort, marriage can take place in winter, during the last three months of the year. On dusk of the appointed day, the guests assemble at the boy's house. After the priest arrives, a dähmobed, viz. the village religious leader, takes five to seven persons from the boy's side and goes to the girl's house. At that time, the girl is dressed up and seated respectfully in the centre of several ladies with the veil pulled over her head, and when the dähmobed calls out her name, the girl out of respect and modesty does not reply. Therefore, the dähmobed pleads and affectionately says loudly several times that \"I, an elder, have come before you [p. 24] along with other elders, and am addressing you but you are not replying, then what do I do? Now I am tired of shouting\". After he has said this several times, the girl softly replies in a sweet voice. Then the dähmobed asks her to raise her voice so that all can hear. Thus, after one or two more rounds of question and answer, the dähmobed says that NN, son of NN, desires to tie the knot of matrimony with you, girl, named NN, daughter of NN. You have the right to say yes or no. Your father has the right to consult, discuss and advise as an elder. So, if you are yourself willing"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"and your father consents, then say who you are appointing as your inter-cessor (vakeel [literally advocate]); on hearing this, the girl in reply gives the name of one of her close male relatives; then the dähmobed listens and says \"bale bale\" meaning \"yes, yes\"; then the dähmobed tells the behdins accompanying him \"lady NN has appointed behdin NN as her intercessor, are you witness for that?\" In reply they all say, \"Yes, we saw with our own eyes and heard with our ears\". Thereafter, along with the intercessor, they return home, the elders in the gathering and the dastur who blesses the couple are addressed by the dähmobed, telling them \"lady NN has appointed behdin NN as her inter-cessor. For this the persons who were present as witnesses\". The wit-nesses say \"yes\" and give their consent at that time. In the meantime, a pair of garments for the boy arrives from the girl's house, which after-wards the boy puts on. The boy and the girl's intercessors both perform the kusti pädyäb. The boy is seated to the right of the dastur and the girl's intercessor is seated on the dastur's left side. Seven types of dry fruits are placed in the intercessor's right hand. [p.25] The boy holds the contract in his right hand, and the dastur reads out the following admoni-tions in the Dari language: \"Today is an auspicious day, and as directed by the immortal-souled prophet Aso Zartost Spitaman (Zarathustra Spitama), I tell you and in-form you so that you may listen and conduct yourself accordingly, and also direct your children to follow suit. Whatever good deeds you have done to date, are counted ten for one, and sins one for one. But now after marriage, if you commit sins, then for every one, ten will stick to your conscience, and whatever good deeds you do, will be considered the same. The works of merit in the Mazdayasni religion are limitless, and out of them some are extremely important, and by doing them it will be considered meritorious and not doing them would be a sin. Thus, I tell you that you should not miss doing good deeds. \"Firstly, daily morning, noon and evening, it is fitting to pray the Khorsed - Meher Niyais in havan, rapithvan, and uziran geh. If you do not know to pray this, instead you may recite each time 135 Yathä and 5 Asem. So, too, do not omit to pray the Avesta in Aiwisruthrem, Usahin geh and at dawn. \"Secondly, recite the Mäh Niyäis on the occasion of the full moon, moonless day and crescent, i.e. at the commencement of the lunar month. If you do not know how to recite, then it is fitting to pray 75 Yathä and 5 Asem."},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"\"Thirdly, there are six gahambär festivals every year, of which one gahambär every year must be celebrated and the righteous faithful must be fed.

If you wear the sudreh kusti, for every step you receive a re-ward of twelve hundred dirhem and become [p. 27] one of the rewarded persons on this earth. Hence, as long as you live, keep the sudreh and kusti on your body, and at the change of every geh, or after answering the call of nature, perform the kusti, which is equivalent to performing the setäyesh of Hormuzd."},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"\"So also, five persons have a right over faithful children; first mother and father, next teacher, thereafter mother-in-law and father-in-law.

Consulting him and taking his ad-vice in every activity will result in avoiding loss or error, for any activity done with proper guidance pleases Ahura Mazda [p. 28] and any activity done without consultation is pleasing to Ahreman. \"In revering the seven Amsäspandän, there are seven obligations full of wisdom that you should fulfil. \"The first obligation, to Hormuzd, consists in the following: When you meet people, whether small or big, then first try to obtain their affec-tion, greet them, and every traveller or guest who comes to you, treat him well according to your ability, and when they seek help from you, then know that it is equivalent to pleasing Dadär Hormuzd. \"Secondly, fulfilling the obligation to Bahman Amsäspand consists in the following: If there is any conflict or quarrel among people, then in-tervene and make peace, create understanding; and care for animals by offering them grass, water, keeping them safe from cold and heat and do not make them work more than necessary. Thus, if you please men and beast, then you have pleased Bahman Amsäspand. 15 Manekji's note: These are names of 3 angels. Actually, it should be 5: Meher -Rasne - Behram - Astad - Aneran."},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"\"Thirdly, offering the following virtues to Ardibehest: In all actions use righteous words always, and never tell a lie, for the lord of all re-wards, the first and original source of charity and fruitful prayer, is to walk on the path of righteousness. Of all sins the greatest sin and the first among all sins is telling lies. Hence, to love righteousness and tread the path of righteousness and revere all types of fire and not touch fire with soiled hands or unclean body and not to burn any foul items, only fra-grant dry wood; not to allow the hearth-fire to go out, all that is equiva-lent to pleasing Ardibehest Amsäspand. Ardibehest Amsäspand is in charge of the splendid heaven. Hence those righteous people who respect fire will always find a place in heaven. \"[p. 29] Fourthly, offering these virtues to Sehrevar Amsäspand: God created all persons at one time, but everyone becomes poor or rich ac-cording to their own actions. Hence, there is not a single old family in which there is not a person of low, poor condition. So, without despising any poor person, we should, as far as possible, guide them, and an able person should take care of the weak. Moreover, take care of metallic ob-jects, and continue to observe purity and not allow anything to become stale or rusty, this will please Sehrevar Amsäspand. \"Fifthly, offering these virtues to Spandärmad Amsäspand: One may possess wealth, skill, knowledge, power, status, yet with pleasant manners, affection and humility, behave courteously with others, so that just as the humble earth which is below our feet becomes fertile and is praised, so may you be praised in the world. Just as those who rear dry fruit trees fulfil their wishes and are joyful, so may you make all who come to you hopeful and cheerful; and attempt to keep the house, garden, fields and roads clean. These things will please Spandärmad Amsäspand. \"Sixthly, offering these virtues to Khordäd Amsäspand: The way God keeps you in this world, be contented with your lot and be grateful and thankful to Him. Do not be greedy, envious or spiteful on seeing other's wealth or property. Keep water precious and away from nasä. Daily on awaking, take nirang or dry fruit or juice of leaves, and while washing the hands and face, use 'äberavän' or 'äbeambar', viz. water from a flowing stream and river or well and pond. Take the water in a separate vessel, go to a dry place and wash so that the dirty water [p. 30] does not mix with pure water. Whilst drawing water in one's own or another's field or garden, first look around that place to make sure that there is no nasä in the way, and allow water to flow so that no nasä may mix with water. Such practices will please Khordäd Amsäspand."},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"\"Seventhly, offering these virtues to Amardäd Amsäspand: Any work that is due in the world should be liked by the entire anjuman. Hence, consult and seek advice of more than one person because even a wise one is liable to err and a single person does not have as much wisdom as he ought to. Hence, after consulting many people, each activity should be carried out. Since vegetation provides nourishment to living beings, make every deserted place fertile and prosperous by planting trees with courage and labour, so that the food that is produced feeds every animal. By such practices Amardäd Amsäspand can be pleased.\" After reading out the above admonitions, the dastur who performs the wedding says, \"Whatever happened up to now is over and may you be well; hence you should repent of past sins so that you may be happy and hereafter be good and follow the laws of the religion, as also your chil-dren should observe them. May God bless you with wisdom and may you be happy.\" On hearing these words, the boy and the girl's interces-sor start reciting the patet and on behalf of the wedding couple, all pre-sent at the function also recite the patet. After the patet is over, the bridegroom is made to take an oath in 'fars-e-kadim' or 'dari' which translates as follows: \"Since such-and-such a lady, who is the daughter of NN, has the right to get married, and her father has the right to counsel her as the head of the family, by her own desire and with the consent of her elders, as also their guidance, [p. 31] I have accepted her as my wife to keep with my body and soul for-ever.\" Thereafter, the intercessor of the bride is asked to make a declara-tion of the girl's marriage in slightly different words. After obtaining the declarations from both, the dastur recites Avesta prayers. Here he recites the Aiwisruthrem Geh prayers and a paragraph from Hormuzd yasht called nipäyois mashim. After completing the Avesta prayers, the äsirwäd in Pahlavi follows. After reciting these again, some Avesta prayers are recited, including a Hä from the Yasna,16 and Avesta prayers for consecrating the darun.17 It would be much better if the dastur or mobed knew the meaning of these Pahlavi äsirwäd or Avesta prayers. Once again the bride's intercessor is asked to repeat the declaration as made earlier: \"inasmuch as such-and-such a lady has the right and privi-lege of marrying according to her father's counsel so as to be a couple in this world and the next, and is a household lady treading the path of re-16 This refers to Yasna 54. 17 This has never been the practice in India, and is no longer done in Iran either."},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"ligion with body and soul and looking after the house and the master of the house, I personally make the contract and agreement and have her wedded to behdin NN.\" The boy also makes a similar declaration and says that he accepts and takes an oath in the following words: \"I promise that I will never turn away from my word; that I will not allow any sorrow to be caused to my better half whose hand I have held; that she will join me in my happiness, that her work I will know as mine, that whatever her needs may be I will fulfil them, and I promise that the when she wants to give the predetermined 'Meher-o-ntkä'18 to someone, I will not oppose this; I shall always [p. 32] keep her in dignity like my own self, and promise to fulfil all her desires. May Meher, Sarosh and Rashne yazatas be my witnesses; Adar-kharuh (khoreh?), Adar-gusasp [sic] and Adar-burzinmeher be my witnesses, the pious Fravasi of Zarathustra Spitama be my witness. May my soul and religion be my witness. All the behdins who are present here be my witnesses. Mobeds who are present be my witnesses, you dastur NN who ties my knot of matrimony, be my witness.\" After the boy takes the above oath, the bride's intercessor is made to swear as before, and finally he says three times, \"Man dädam\" i.e. \"I gave (her)\". Then the boy replies three times, \"Man pajiraptam\" that is, \"I have accepted (her)\". Then the priest says, \"May you live a long, aus-picious, good life with good fortune, lovingly till the end of your life.\" Aidun bad, Aidun taraj bad, Asem (one) until the äsirwäd that unites the couple. Now, the religious ritual performed by the mobed is complete. While the mobed is performing the above ceremony, someone stands with some dry fruit, a raw egg, a scissors and green silk thread in his hand close to the head of the bridegroom. When the mobed finishes the cere-mony, he does ächhu michhu, that is, dispelling evil over the boy's head at that time, and the groom tosses the raw egg away high up in the air. (While performing the ritual, instead of the bride sitting with the groom, one person from the bride's side becomes the intercessor and sits and makes the agreement on behalf of the bride; this practice I think is akin to the Islamic laws, and the behdins must have adopted it.) After this activity is over, a pair of clothes are taken from the groom's house and put on the bride along with some ornaments. Then the girl's family feeds those who bring the dress or a little dry fruit and sweets are 18 Manekji's note: It is an ancient practice that whatever 'Meher'-bride's money is decided upon, the bridegroom must give."},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"served, wine [p. 33] sipped, men and women all together. Each one car-ries a lighted candle in their hands, and goes with the bride to the groom's house. Afterward, according to the capacity of the bride's par-ents, ornaments, clothes, utensils, bed-sheets, etc. are given and taken to the groom's house. That is called 'dahej' (gift). On arriving at the groom's house, the bride lights the fire in a high pot at one place. Around it on one side the ladies stand and the men on the other side. In their midst and in the presence of all, the groom holds the bride's hands and both go round the glowing fire three or seven times. Men and women standing nearby all together shower dry fruit on the couple at that time and salute them. Sometimes one or two mobeds, if present, stand and sing songs. Thus, after making the rounds, the groom leads the bride by the hand into a room in the house, comes out after seating her, bids farewell respectfully to the audience and girl's relatives, and they19 stay separately in their own place. Subsequently the wedding guests are invited to their house for two or four days or a week, in turns, some in the morning, some at night and some both times. During meals each guest is individually served, and each has a chaperone. During such festivities, the parents, brothers and sisters of the wed-ded couple and other relatives all come and go as guests. Then those close relatives invite the wedded couple to their house as guests. Thus, by mutual love and affection, the people there have preserved the tradi-tion of enjoying family bliss. (The readers of this account will certainly have compassion in their hearts for the innocent daughters of our country (India) [p. 34]; their mothers-in-law, like fiends, treat them so badly and cause sorrow to those budding flowers of delicate build, and tum them into old women; and like stupid illiterate children, find excuses in everything to create unpleasantness among in-laws and close relations. Therefore, if we had the practice whereby the couple lived separately after marriage like our Iranian brethren, then such sad incidents would be undoubtedly very few amongst the Parsi families in India.) On the 3rd, 4th, or any other day within a week after marriage, the groom steps out of the house accompanied by five to seven close rela-tives in the evening during Uziran geh. Meanwhile, his wife goes to the terrace with dry fruit and dried leaves called 'äbsan' in a vessel and 19 i.e. bride and groom."},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"showers them onto the head of her husband. Then the boy goes to a stream of water with milk and sugar and dry fruits called 'sanjat' in his hands and, while reciting Ä Hätämca Hä (Yasna 65) of Ävän Niyäis, pours these into the water. On returning home before entering the house, his wife welcomes him as before. The marriage ceremony (kriyâ) as described above does not cost the groom more than Rs. 100/- to Rs. 1000/- and the bride's family spends an equal amount; apart from this, there is no quarrel about or promise about things like jewellery, or clothes, etc. Both the husband and wife consider their life together as a unit, and do not consider anything individually. Not only that, ever since they first desired to get married to each other until the very end of their lives, they love each other dearly just like the 20 pair of Säras birds (swans) who are as united in happiness as in sorrow; they spend their time in this world governed by fate in mutual under-standing and contentment, as is said in the Hindi couplet: \"Parëtam pateea tolke jo kuch antar hoy Amtum jêvrâ ekëye dekhan ke tan doye\"21 [p. 35] (For a learned person it is no secret that a husband who does not keep his better half with befitting love, or makes her unhappy and like an old woman, he himself is lost, he will lose his invaluable asset of health, the fountain of love and fruits of love, and will become a penniless men-dicant.) When the boy marries and separates from his father, the father gives him his share of the inheritance, dividing up his business for the pur-pose. Afterwards he has no share in the father's assets or property. So, if someone has more than one son, each of them on marriage receives sepa-rate shares. The youngest son stays in the father's house, and he inherits the capital or property, because he stays in the family house and is re-sponsible for performing rituals (kriyâ) for the dead and the living.22 (This practice seems to be very ancient and ideal and we therefore see in history that Säh Kayomarz had designated his youngest son Siamak, Faredün Aptin his youngest son Irach, Kaikaüs had designated Siävoush and Sah Gustasp had named his second son Aspandiar as heirs to the 20 This alludes to an Indian saying about these birds. 21 \"Let there be no distance between the beloved and her husband/Though by sight we are two, may we live like one life.\" 22 In India, this duty generally resides with the eldest son. Occasionally, however, a trust is established."},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"throne, and thereafter their children are found to have obtained the crown and throne.) Until the girl is married, the parents or brothers should look after her and meet the marriage expenses according to their capacity. Except whatever is given to her as gift (dahej) at the time of marriage, she gets nothing more from the father's assets. But whatever the girl's mother has, e.g. ornaments, cash, clothes or garden, fields, including the mother's privilege of Meher-o-nîkâ all that will go to her on the mother's death. If, therefore, there is more than one daughter, the mother's prop-erty is distributed. Thus, if the assets are shared, there will be no quarrel in the family. [p. 36] And whatever the girl has received from her husband or in-laws or from her in-laws in any form can not be taken away by anyone; neither her in-laws nor parents nor brother nor sister nor anyone else has any rights to her assets or property. Therefore, whatever she may have in the way of capital or immovable property will be passed on only to her own daughter. That is, the mother's property is not given to her son and whatever she has only goes to her daughter—but if a lady has no daugh-ter, then she may bequeath her wealth to whomsoever she will. As said earlier at the time of the äsirwäd, a girl is called 'pädsähäjani' (= befitting a king). Depending on the condition of the girl, she is called by different names and given different titles. Accordingly, there are 5 types of women considered for marriage and their descriptions are as follows:23 The spinster who marries with the counsel of her parents and close relatives is given the title 'pädsähäjani' at the time of marriage. A spinster who desires to get married without the counsel and per-mission of her parents and close relatives, but following her own will, is given the title 'khudrähijani', but she does not get respect and status. A woman who is widowed and marries a second husband is called 'chäkar24 jani' at the time of marriage. (It seems that this term must have originally been 'chakarjani'.) If the lady who remarries has no children from the first husband, or if they all died and none are still living, and if she marries again and has more than one child with her second husband, then half the children are considered the children of the first husband and so they are linked with his name. 23 In India, only two categories are distinguished. 24 Gujarati: 'servant'."},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"[p. 37] A girl who is a spinster and marries but whose father has no male issue is called 'suthurjani' at the time of marriage; for, when she gives birth to the first baby boy, that boy is called the son of his maternal grandfather. His father has no rights over the son, and the maternal grandfather's name is used with the boy's name instead ofthe father's name, e.g. the Kayanian King Darab's name is taken with that of his ma-ternal grandfather Bahman Sah, and the Pesdadian King Minocher's name is recited with his maternal grandfather Irach Sah and Sikander's [Alexander's] name is recited with that of his maternal grandfather Pheelkush [Philip], A woman who, after marriage, has unfortunately had some bad ex-perience with her husband, if they have been separated for a long time and later a settlement is reached—it is advisable to have äsirwäd per-formed again. This applies also to any unfortunate event after divorce from her husband—if she desires to marry another man, then too in the äsirwäd this lady's name is recited as 'aiyougjani'. Amongst our Iranian brethren, there is no sudden separation between the husband and wife. If any unfortunate event takes place, their relatives intervene and make every effort to restore peace. As mentioned above, they have the äsirwäd performed a second time and have the couple re-united. If the interveners are not successful with their advice, then out of helplessness, they ask the couple to seek divorce. Even if unfortunate incidents or circumstances have brought the separation about, separation of a man and a woman is nevertheless recognised as a great sin. If, there-fore, in the course of three years peace cannot be restored, then, recog-nising that divorce is the only solution, they are taken before a dastur. The dastur explains to them that according to religion, breaking of wed-lock is a serious sin. He gives them a few days to seek relief and desires them to make peace. However, if that does not happen, then in the end, sorrowfully, the amount promised at the time of marriage, or according to the capacity of the husband, or something more or less, [p. 38] is given to the lady. Both are brought to the ätas behräm and perform kusti pädyäb. The dastur says in the presence of several men and women: \"You were tied in wedlock by God's ways and according to the prophet's directives, but Ahreman raised doubts in your hearts and did not allow you to rest calmly; now the sin of breaking the wedlock rests on the heads of those who wanted to bring sorrow to you or, if you have made such attempts, then on your own head; hence you will have to an-swer in the presence of Meher, Saros, Rasna Yazad.\" After the dastur"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"says this, the husband and wife hold one other's arms and are made to say the following words: \"Until today, we were husband and wife. Dur-ing that period, if one or the other has caused any disrespect, mistake or omission, may God forgive us and also you. From today, we both have become like brother and sister; hence we shall not bear any animosity or seek revenge for the past, now we shall always do our duty as brother and sister to love and be affectionate to one another.\" After saying more such words, both do hamâzôr and are sent back; then they go to their re-spective houses and live as they please, and do as they like, and no one is obligated to the other. Despite the small numbers of our Iranian brethren, many are seen to have two wives. If a husband, besides his married wife, wants to have a second wife, despite the first [wife], the rule is such that he should in every case please the first wife and let her give oral evidence before the dastur and the elders of the village and state: \"I have myself given per-mission to my husband to have a second wife.\" If possible, the first wife may plead that others may help her husband to get another wife, or the first wife may give her consent in writing and efforts may be made to find a new wife through her only, or the man may make his own ar-rangements. Then both those ladies may live in the same house or in separate houses, and both together run the household, and [p. 39] any children bom of them will be given equal affection and given equal rights to share in the inheritance, so there is no conflict between them. Our Iranian Parsi women are very understanding and patient, faithful and obedient to their husbands. Despite any hatred, yet in order to act accord-ing to their husband's wishes and to please him, they do not quarrel or exchange words amongst each other. This practice, according to my thinking, has crept in amongst the [Iranian] Parsi community due to con-tact with Muslims. In Iran, the daughters of priests marry behdins and the daughters of behdins marry mobeds. Such marriages used to be the practice and still are. The inhabitants of Kerman still follow it without any hindrance, but some mobeds of Yazd, if they come to know of their sister or daughter wanting to marry a behdin, then first other mobeds create resentment in the family, and after a few days, make peace with a good heart and do not miss the opportunity to entertain each other, drink wine and raise a toast to each other."},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"[Women's garments] Secondly, the Muslims frequently cause harm to our Iranian brethren and have inflicted tyrannical laws on them, including changing their dress to such an extent that the men's dress has completely changed, but un-doubtedly there is little change in the women's dress. The dress of our Iranian sisters, therefore, is better than that of our Iranian brothers. Their body is well covered. The costume is useful both in summer and winter seasons and there is no difficulty in moving about or doing work. This costume is affordable for both the rich and the poor, the body looks graceful and it is also comfortable while travelling. They wear a large garment like a khalkä (loose gown) over the sudreh-kusti. It looks like a long flowing robe extending from the neck right down to the calves of the legs. [p. 40] Its two sleeves are wide and reach to the wrist. Due to this, the arms are fully covered, yet while working the sleeves can be rolled up. The garment is cut narrow at the top and broad towards the bottom, so that there is no difficulty while moving about or travelling. The garments of young ladies are made of cotton or silk of various colours, striped or embroidered with chikan rings. As for elderly women, they wear garments of a single colour. In order to avoid any hindrance at the time of performing the kusti, they tie the kusti round the garment; but at night when they take off the garment, the kusti remains on the sudreh itself. Their pyjamas are long and reach down to the ankle. Inside, at each end, a thread is inserted in order to make it narrow at the ankles, just like the mobeds here in India while performing rituals of yaozdäthragari25 wear a narrow-ankled pyjama with a wide opening up to the ankles. Similarly, they wear 'ijär' (pyjamas), for that is comfortable while mov-ing about slowly or fast or riding.26 That ijär, like the upper garment, is made of cotton or silk, of striped cloth, or embroidered with chikan work or plain. The pyjamas that our priests wear are called surwäl which origi-nally comes from the word salwär. Hence, the ijär of Iranian women is also called salwär. 25 i.e., the high-rituals which are performed within the pavi, the so-called'inner ritu-als'. 26 In India, the word 'ijar' designates women's pyjamas. At the same time, it also re-fers to the tight legging, which the priest puts above the piyama. As Dastur Kotwal ex-plains, the narrow piyamas are put above the wide dress in order to make sure that the clothes may not inadvertently touch the ritual requisites."},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"In winter, they wear socks and shoes with or without khade.27 Those residing in villages and working in fields, especially those working in snow and walking in mud, can never do without shoes with khade. Those living in towns, as also wealthy ladies, wear high quality shoes called kafsesäghri [donkey-skin], some of which are made with khade and some without khade. According to their capacity, over the top garment they wear [p. 41] a shawl around their waist, so that they get more energy to work and the bodily constitution remains strong; and in winter, it protects against the biting cold. Some do not tie it around the waist during summer, and there is not much resentment against not tying it around the waist. There is a kurtä (shirt), which is worn over the top garment. It is called 'farji' and made of wool or silk cloth or chit (???) with long sleeves down to the wrists, and from the neck down to the thighs, and in the centre there is a lining that fits like a bra just as our ladies wear a choli or blouse, and cover their body respectably and look charming, they also look graceful. For the head, they weave plaits and keep them loose at the back, and wear an ear-shaped cap of silk cloth and tie its threads below the neck. Over the cap they tie a silk handkerchief like a phetä. Over it is tied a veil called magna which is tied like a veil over a long flowing robe. It reaches down to the elbows of both the arms, and the breasts are fully covered and over the back it drapes down to the thighs and looks decent and respectable. Those who can afford to tie silk scarves put these over the other with two or three coloured phetäs and wrap a veil in two or three colours which are decorative like a peacock in coloured hues and do not fail to impress. They fix old silver coins as ornaments and make garlands of them and tie them over their head like a row of flowers. Some wear gold or silver earrings and some wear small nose rings as is the custom. They do not wear bangles; but on the other hand some young ladies wear a brace-let of beads when they go out. When they go out, besides the above-mentioned dress, they put a veil (chador) like a shawl over their head, keeping their dress and entire body covered, exposing only the face and hands, and while travelling, they can, like men, ride on any animal and cover a long journey. 27 Khade refers to the counter that can be raised to make a shoe for outdoor usage (= \"with khade\"), or tucked onto the sole to make an open-back sandal for ease of removal for indoor usage (= \"without khade\")."},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"[Festivals] [p. 42] Thirdly, among all festivals, our people consider Mehergän, Jamsedi navroz, Pateti, the day of consecrating rapithvan and Khordad säl as the best. On the occasion of performing religious rituals, they do not go to each other's house without an invitation. However, for the gahambär or Mehergän jasan, all consider it rewarding to participate without any invitation. At the house of those, who host a gahambär, men and women all assemble and openly sit in groups in rooms in the same house. Before the äfringän of gahambär begins, everyone performs the kusti and prays the obligatory Avesta prayers. When the priests start the äfringän, all participants start reciting äfringän. Some pray orally and some from the book, and those who do not know, recite Yathä Asem. While performing the äfringän, in India, our zoti and rathvi pray fac-ing opposite each other, whereas there [in Iran], the mobeds do not sit opposite each other, and all persons sit in one line and pray. Water is filled in a vessel called 'nava' in äfringän. A branch of the myrtle tree (murd) or pomegranate tree with leaves is dipped in the vessel. During the ritual, it is moved in different [by the priest]. When starting a new kardä, at the word äfrinämi, everyone present picks up a flower or a leaf, and raises a finger of his right hand. Then, [p. 43] while reciting up to vispo khäthrem, they raise the second finger and while reciting the Yathä, they keep it down. This is repeated for every kardä. When the äfringän commences, another person sits separately and re-cites the names from the nam grahan book. When he stops he says \"khudä biämurjäd\" i.e. be blessed by God. Thus, the names of famous men and women of each and every village, which are recorded in the book, are recited every time a jasan is performed. In the midst, the reciter says, let all souls from Kayomarz to Soshyosh be blessed by God (\"khudä biämurjäd\"). Moreover, the names of former kings, pious men and heroes are recited with the Khsnuman. There are more than thirty such books in Yazd province. In many of them, this speaker [Manekji] had the names of our philanthropic leaders recorded, and these are re-cited at every jasan accordingly. After the recitation of äfringän is over, at the end, twenty-one Yathä and twelve Asem are recited, when all men and women join in reciting them loudly. Then the dähmobed who is present as the administrative head recites a khutbot (a sort of monäjät). Its main theme is that Maz-dayasm religion may prosper and the strength ofthe wicked may be bro-ken. Those who donate for care of the religion and those who participate"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"in the gahambär will be the co-sharers of the day's blessings. May the souls of the departed, as well as the souls of those who die hereafter, go to heaven. May the wishes of all, small or big, native or foreigner, be granted and may your end be good. After saying many such words, the dahmobed takes a mud pot containing the fire next to äfringän in his hand, takes it to each one and holds the fire near to their faces and wishes hamäzor; then everyone in the audience inhales the fragrance of the incense, and they rub their hands over the face saying hamäzor hamä ν 28 aso. [p. 44] After the ritual is over, the cäsni of dry fruits is distributed, and those who can afford it, make a cäsni of one nän with salad. At that time, there is no commotion or hurry, and everyone gets an equal share, the right quantity. In Yazd and the villages together there are about two thousand jasans performed in this way, providing food for two to three months to the poor people. Each man or woman considers it his/her duty to perform a gahambär jasan once every year during his/her lifetime at his/her own expense. Those who desire to have the gahambär ritual in their memory performed perpetually even after their death, make a document or will, giving to charity Rs.100 to Rs. 1,000 in the name of their heir or an elder of the village or a leader or a dastur. The performance of gahambär may then continue out of the interest received on their funds. The expense on that is Rs.5 to Rs.50. People participate very enthusiastically in the gahambär function in every way. They taste the cäsni and consider it a great reward. Rich or poor, old or young, women or men, all are present, and if someone is pre-occupied and cannot attend, he himself feels embarrassed that others may rebuke him. Therefore, for the five days of the gahambär all put their work aside and go to the gahambär jasans. As the gahambär is held in many houses, at each festival time gahambär äfringäns are performed in tum continuously from 7 a.m. in the morning to 9 p.m. at night. Depending on the population of the village, each villager prepares a minimum of 100 näns (bread) and a maximum of2000 näns for distribu-tion at the gahambär. But those people who want to incur less expense, make the nän very thin and small. Those who spend well, make them thick and large. But, in every case, they must be adequate in number so 28 Dastur Kotwal comments on this passage by drawing attention to a similar practice from Naosari: At big ja§ans, when the Pazand Afrin is recited, all the participants get up, and the assistant priest goes round making hamäzor with everybody."},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"that everyone can get one. In larger or smaller quantities dry fruits offer-ings are provided to all.

However, there is no religious directive to that effect; rather that has been done by imitating each other. Along with meals, there is the practice among them to serve wine. Moreover, at every jasan ritual or at weddings and sad occasions, meals are served, and also wine is served as a custom. At a feast, a reliable man is entrusted with the work of serving wine. He takes a bottle of wine in his hand and first pours wine into his own bowl saying some words of blessings as a 'monäjät'. Then he himself drinks the wine from that bowl, while the audience greets him with the word \"nosejän\". Then that wine server pours wine for everyone accord-ing to their pomp and status, and they too greet each other, raise the toast and drink the wine from their respective bowls. They are [in turn] greeted respectfully by the wine server. Thus, every time and on every occasion the custom of drinking wine is prevalent. To see that makes one happy. Jamsedi Navroz is considered the biggest day among them. Origi-nally, its celebration lasted for 40 days, then 30, and thereafter 22, and finally for 13 days, but nobody can do without it. When celebrating these days, there is lot of change in the condition of men and women. What-ever they can afford, they spend and eat during those days. They dress up and do not miss any opportunity to enjoy themselves with their fami-lies. So also, at the time of Mehergän jasan, the celebration lasts for 3 to 5 or 7 days. [.Pregnancies, child-birth, infancy, and menstruation] Fourthly, like the men, our Iranian sisters engage in activities according to their status and suitability. They go out and labour, and keep busy [p. 46] in travel and riding and are not idle through tenderness or pamper-ing. Pregnant ladies continue to work as they were accustomed, and are industrious. Unlike the ladies of our community, they do not sit idly and become careless. For the fifth month ceremonies for a pregnant woman, her relatives stitch small coloured dresses and gifts for the lady, con-gratulate her on being pregnant, and wish her a safe and easy delivery. So also, in the seventh and ninth months, some bring presents, then the"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"pregnant lady thanks them with flowers, fruits, and roses, serves a meal and bids them farewell. At the time of delivery, a suitable quiet room in the house is selected, swept and cleaned. Channels marked like pävi, and a line of stones are arranged to demarcate the border. A fire or an oil lamp is lighted. Among her neighbours or friends, mature, intelligent, charming, and good-natured ladies to the number of five or seven are present there. Only they are allowed there, noise is avoided, and the most competent one amongst them is entrusted the work of a nurse. The newborn child is to be first given sugar or shir khes (a sugary preparation) or made to lick honey syrup. A pious lady performs the kusti, recites Avesta prayers and herself makes it pure and keeps ready. When the child cries, it is made to lick the sugar. Keeping the limbs of the child stretched, it is swaddled in a nice cloth and until it becomes six months old, it is swaddled in this way, and each child's body is kept under control and its form and shape is straight and it grows like a cypress tree. On the tenth day after delivery, the mother purifies her body, wears clean clothes, moves about anywhere in the house or in the street or goes to see relatives and friends; but she stays away from water, fire, food items and keeps her food and drink separate. Thus, for forty days, she stays aloof. On the forty-first day [p. 47], a capable and gentle lady of a mobed family gives her a nähn and she becomes pure, and starts working in the house. But after delivery, she considers it an act of merit to take baresnüm. Thus, when they exceed the age of delivery and menses, a mobed family. The delivery clothes, after being sprinkled with nirang, are kept in the sun separately for a few days. Then they are washed with water and stocked away in order to be used again for similar work or during menses. When the newborn child is to be named, the mother, father, grand-parents, close relatives, etc. each think of a name silently. On the child's sixth or tenth day, they all meet and express their thoughts. If one of these names is selected by the child's mother, that name is used. Usually, if he is a boy, then his paternal grandfather's name or father's grandfa-ther's name is used, and if it is a girl, the maternal grandmother's name or grandmother's mother's name is used, and if the boy's father dies while the child is in the womb, then after birth the boy is named after his father, e.g. if the boy's father is named Kaus-e-Behram, then that boy is called Kaus-e-Behram. After the ceremony, all present are given sweets, dry fruits and sharbat and then they depart."},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"Each child's day and date of birth is recorded on one side of a wall or in the back of an Avesta prayer book on a piece of paper in order to reckon his birthday and age in years. So that the boy can sleep in a clean place instead of the cloth rocking-cradle used in India, all have small and simple cradles in their homes. In this, the child sleeps and grows up healthy. The body is not bent, and as the cradle is simple and light in weight, it is easy to take from one place to the other and it costs no more than Rs. 1 or Rs.2. [p. 48] Every mother, if she does not have enough milk to breastfeed her child, desires to increase her milk by taking medicine, but does not consider it right to give another woman's milk. If the mother of a child falls sick or dies, then the child is entrusted to a lady from among close relatives in a good family who is lactating. Under no circumstances do they give milk to their child from a woman of a low-grade family or from a lady of another community. This is resented because a child gets the qualities of the lady whose milk it drinks and grows up to become negli-gent in religious activity, and the child who has had milk from a lady respects her as her mother, and even when it grows up does not fail to thank her. Just as the Iranian women maintain seclusion at the time of delivery, so also, during menses, they sit aloof and do not touch anything. They eat food with a spoon, and the vessels used are always kept separately and as far as possible from each other. They do not allow their gaze to fall on fire, water or a pious man. In order not to get bored sitting in a corner, they go from one house to another, but as far as possible, they are careful to avoid touching bricks or wood or stepping on them, and all those undergoing menses from different houses meet at a predetermined place and get together; then, after four to five hours, they all go to their respective houses. In this way they maintain isolation until the period of menses is over, when they have a head bath.29 The clothes of that period are washed with nirang and water and then put to use. Some take up em-broidery, stitching or knitting during menses and when they take a bath to purify themselves, they also wash these items and make them pure. 29 i.e., a bath from head to foot."},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"[Funerals] Fifthly, regarding the death ceremonies, there is a practice that if anyone dies, the men bathe a male corpse and the women bathe [p. 49] a female corpse with nirang and water. Then the sachkär and sagdid rituals are performed. If the nasäkhänä is nearby, 4 persons in pairs carry the corpse there. At the spot where sachkär is done, a line is drawn, a lamp is lit, and flowers are kept for three days. If there is no nasäkhänä, people per-form sachkär at home and keep the corpse there. After the sachkär, a pair of mobeds or more starts the geh särnä. At that time, the behdins present also recite the geh särnä kardä. Thus, the entire anjuman does geh särnä. After all the rituals are over, the na-sesälärs who bring the gehän and are present [during the geh särnä] put the corpse in the gehän and entrust it to the khandiäs. The close relatives form pairs and walk ahead at a short distance. The khandiäs follow, and then, at some distance, those attending the päidast follow in pairs recit-ing prayers. After the corpse is taken to the outskirts of the village, those who are to return, they halt there, go home and perform kusti pädyäb. The rest goes up to the dokhmä. The women also gather amongst themselves and assemble in a group near the dokhmä. After the corpse is placed in the dokhma, some men and ladies return to their houses, [where they] per-form the kusti pädyäb or take bath and purify their bodies. The rest stay at the dharamsälä near the dokhma. They do kusti pädyäb and sit and recite Avesta prayers. So if some one comes to know and wants to ex-press sorrow and desires to go to the dokhmä, one can go there till the evening, but no one visits the deceased's house. The nasesälärs put the body in the dokhmä and go their way, i.e. take bath, change clothes and drink (wine), but they stay away from the mo-beds, behdins, prayer houses (ebädat-khäne) and jasan ceremonies, [p. 50] So also the khändiäs go to their respective houses, take bath, change clothes, keep those clothes separate, sprinkle nirang, dry, wash and may use the clothes. Some keep a pair of clothes separately for this purpose. When someone dies, the close relatives act as khändiäs; but nasesälärs are two or three predetermined people, and only they can go into the dokhmä. After the corpse has reached its final destination [is placed in the dok-hmä], a male family member brings some food and wine near the dokhmä [in order to] feed and serve wine to people who come there and invite them to come home. There is no mourning at home and if some close relatives"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"feel strongly and their hearts are full, quietly they shed tears, but none mourns loudly, and even shedding tears is considered a sin. On the third or fourth day after death, visitors bring flowers, fruits, and green herb and place them near the oil lamp where the corpse was placed. They offer a few words of condolence to the head ofthe family and depart. Some perform the kusti and recite the patet and on the third day evening in uziran geh, close relatives and some mobeds assemble and recite obligatory avesta and patet and go to their respective places. Gatherings take place neither at the deceased's house nor at any other place. Whatever rituals are to be performed for the departed soul, are done at the mobed's place, and no rituals are performed in the ädariän. The chährum ceremony is performed at dawn and many persons, young and old, women and men, even uninvited persons come. At the time of reciting äfringän, animal fat is offered to the fire [p. 51] as a duty. Gener-ally, dried fat with fragrance is kept at the house of priests for this purpose, which is brought and put on the fire. (I think somebody started this custom for making money, so just for this some have an entire goat slaughtered). Those present at the ritual all recite avesta and patet in memory of the de-ceased. After prayers, the consecrated cäsni is distributed. For this, a salad of radish, onion, pomegranate seeds, dry fruit and boiled egg is made, and a fistful of it is placed on a nän. Then all take bäj and partake of a morsel of the cäsni, and the rest they take home. Everyone considers it a meritori-ous act to partake of the cäsni of chährum. For the chährum ritual, a mobed is given as siäv called sudreh, 18 gaj of narrow width khädi cloth for a man and 12 gaj for a lady. The mobed washes it, makes it pure, consecrates it and keeps it. Besides that, no other cloth or vessel nor any other item is given as siäv. After the chährum, on the tenth day, except an äfringän, no other rit-ual is performed; but on the 30th day (1st month), rituals are performed for two days, when a goat is slaughtered and many people are fed. Thereafter, every month, nothing is done, but just half a seer (250 gms) wheat and an egg, some money, few dry fruits are given to the mobed in order to recite an äfringän. On the annual day, just like on the first month day, a goat is slaughtered; but they all agree that this practice of slaugh-tering an animal on the anniversary ofthe deceased is for being one up on the others and not according to the directives of the religion. After-wards, on the occasion of other monthly or annual bäj, only wheat, an egg, some money, dry fruits are given to the mobed, and darun and äf-ringän are performed at the mobed's house."},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"Concerning the soul, they believe that if the deceased was a meat eater, the death anniversary rituals should be performed for thirty years, so that the deceased's soul may be free from the sin of eating meat. For a man or woman who has never eaten meat during one's lifetime, there is no need to have the rituals performed for more than twelve years. [p. 52] Every bachelor or a married man who dies at the age of over 15 years and who has no son can [posthumously] adopt the son of a close relative [as his own son]. Instead of his native father's name, the boy will then use the adopted father's name along with his name. On behalf of the deceased, he will have the rituals performed as he would have done for his own father. For pleasing all the souls of the departed, there is the practice of ar-ranging muktäd from Ästäd roz of Spandärmad month till the last gatha for ten days. Then, amongst the rooms in the house, a room that is open and can be used as a sitting room and where there is a cupboard in the wall is selected. The walls and the floor are covered with white mud and made smooth. A carpet is spread and flowers, fruits and leaves are kept day and night in the cupboard as also on the ground. Five to six times, all persons, small or big in the house, recite Avesta prayers, and what-ever items are placed there, are eaten and served to others; and other items are placed there. During these ten days, each one calls women and children of close relatives as also of poor people and feed them accord-ing to their capacity.

So hat Kurt Rudolph seinen 1961 erstmals erschienen Forschungsbericht über den damaligen Stand unseres Wissens von Zarathustra unter den Titel „Zarathustra - Priester und Prophet\" gestellt.1 Zarathustra, so scheint es, fügt sich nicht in Max Webers religionssoziologische Typisierung der geistlichen Autorität, die legitimiert ist durch das persönliches Charisma des Propheten oder die institutionelle Würde des geistlichen Standes, deren Träger also entwe-der ein prophetischer Neuerer oder ein bewahrender Priester ist.2 MANI UND ZARATHUSTRA Erinnern wir uns, worin die Bedeutung Zarathustras für Mani bestand. Mani hatte Zarathustra als einen seiner prophetischen Vorgänger aner-kannt, ja neben Jesus und dem Buddha war er sein wichtigster Weg-bereiter. Alle diese Propheten, so lehrte es Mani, hatten die Botschaft der erlösenden Gnosis empfangen und verkündet, doch hatten sie es ver-säumt, diese Botschaft auch aufzuschreiben, so daß es ihren Jüngern überlassen blieb, sie weiterzutragen. Die Jünger aber hatten sie miß-deutet und entstellt, und erst der schreibefreudige Mani vermochte es, die eine Wahrheit der Erkenntnis, die auch die Wahrheit Jesu, Zarathust-ras und des Buddha war, bis an die Enden der Welt und zum Ende ihrer Zeit zu verkünden.

Das trifft zu insofern als er zweifellos von Jesus mehr und Richtigeres wußte als von den beiden anderen Propheten. Denken wir nur daran, daß in Manis eigenen Schrif-ten die Folge der beiden Vorgänger Jesu widersprüchlich angegeben wurde: im Säbuhragän geht der Buddha Zarathustra voran, im „Buch der Giganten\" steht Zarathustra an erster Stelle und der Buddha folgt ihm, so wie es auch in der Wirklichkeit gewesen sein muß.3 Aber die Erschließung der in Turfan gefundenen Texte hat doch gezeigt, daß die manichäische Tradition eine regelrechte Zarathustra-Legende besaß.4 Sie adaptierte Motive der zarathustrischen Zarathustralegende und apo-krypher Überlieferungen. Sie stellte Zarathustra als einen gegen alle An-schläge seiner Feinde gefeiten Erwählten der Gottheit dar. Ehe ich mich den manichäischen Zarathustrazeugnissen zuwende, muß ich aber eine Schwierigkeit hervorheben, die sich allen Untersu-chungen entgegenstellt, die auf Material in iranischen Sprachen zurück-greifen: die Abgrenzung genuin manichäischer von zoroastrischen Über-lieferungen. Diese Abgrenzung ist klar zu ziehen, wenn Texte in mani-chäischer Schrift geschrieben worden sind, denn die Zoroastrier haben sie nie verwendet. Diese Abgrenzung ist nicht gegeben für Texte in soghdischer Schrift, die allen Religionsgemeinschaften Zentralasiens zur Aufzeichnung ihrer Texte diente und auch zu säkularen Zwecken ver-wendet wurde. Das Problem würde sich trotzdem nicht stellen, wenn die Manichäer des Ostens nicht ihre Sprache so sehr der zoroastrischen Terminologie angepaßt hätten, daß man sie nach Bekanntwerden der Turfantexte für eine Gemeinde zoroastrischen Ursprungs gehalten hatte.

Leider kennen wir die Antwort auf seine Frage nicht.

Wie aber stellten die Manichä-er sich zu Zarathustra dem Priester, der die sakralen Opfer vollzog? ZARATHUSTRA ALS PRIESTER IN DER MANICHÄISCHEN LEHRE Daß Zarathustra ein Priester war, geht aus den ihm zugeschriebenen Gathas des Avesta, so wie die meisten Fachgelehrten sie verstehen, her-vor. Dies ist auch die Meinung der mittelpersischen Literatur der Za-rathustrier, und Mani und die Manichäer haben sie übernommen. Wie aber haben sie diesen Gegenstand behandelt? Nicht nur hatten die Mani-chäer mit der sakralen Praxis der Zoroastrier nichts gemein, die zoroast-rischen Priester, die Magier der manichäischen Texte, wurden auch als gnadenlose Feinde Manis und seiner Jünger perhorresziert. Trotzdem trug das Avesta, das heilige Textcorpus der Zoroastrier, zum manichäi-schen Zarathustra-Bild bei, Zarathustra blieb der Priester unter den Vor-gängern Manis, und selbst seine Befolgung der Riten wurde nicht gänz-lich ignoriert. Dies soll der zweite Gegenstand meines Beitrages sein. Ich will an zwei Beispielen untersuchen, in welchem Maße die manichäische Überlieferung etwas von der priesterlichen Wirksamkeit Zarathustras oder auch nur von deren Darstellung im Avesta bewahrt hat.

Man braucht nur das parthische 'rd'w zrhwst „der gerech-te Zarathustra\"30 mit dem avestischen aSauua zaraQuströ usw.31 zu ver-gleichen. Diese Nähe erschien Richard Reitzenstein so groß, daß er den Text einst als ein manichäisches rifacimento eines echten zoroastrischen Werkes auffaßte, das nur zufällig nicht im Avesta erhalten sei.32 Reitzen-stein begründete darauf die Hypothese von der Existenz einer alten irani-schen , Volksreligion', die viele Ideen der manichäischen Lehre vorweg-genommen habe, wie z.B. die Lehre vom ,erlösten Erlöser'. Aber diese Annahme konnte nie bewiesen werden, und die weitere Forschung hat den manichäischen Hintergrund des Textes deutlich gemacht. Tatsächlich erklärt sich das manichäischen Anschauungen so nahe-kommende Zarathustrabild dieses Textes aus der Tatsache, daß hier Za-rathustra in typisch manichäischer Manier zu einem Mani vor Mani oder Jesus dem Glanz nach Jesus dem Glanz gemacht wird. Er erscheint als ein Erleuchter und Erlöser der kosmischen Seele, die in dieser Welt ein-gekerkert ist. Das folgt schon aus der Tatsache, daß der Text, den ich hier übersetzt habe, nur eine Episode aus den parthischen grîwzïwanda-gfg-Hymnen, d.h. den Hymnen an die Lebendige Seele, ist. So wurde Reitzensteins These sogleich von H.H. Schaeder33 und W. Henning34 widerlegt. Henning ging so weit zu behaupten: „Der Name Zarahust ist das einzige Zarathustrische in dem Hymnus; an seiner Stelle könnte auch Seth, Buddha, Jesus, Mani oder sonst wer stehen, ohne daß das den Inhalt des Hymnus änderte\". All dies ist wahr mit Ausnahme des ersten Satzes: „Der Name Zara-hust ist das einzige Zarathustrische in dem Hymnus.\" Der manichäische Hymnus besteht, so wie er erhalten ist und ich ihn deute, aus zwei Tei-len: 1. der Anrede Zarathustras und der Antwort der Lebendigen Seele (M 7 /86-102/, im Text von Buchstabe ' bis w), 2. den Abschiedsworten Zarathustras samt seiner Aufforderung an die Seele, ihm in das Licht-reich zu folgen (M 7 /103-118/, im Text von Buchstabe ζ bis t).

Er ist nachgebildet in der Erweckung Adams durch Jesus ,den Freund', so wie Theodor bar Könai beide Ereignisse der Heilsgeschichte geschildert hat.35 Dabei fällt auf, daß insbesondere die Antworten der Erlösten durchaus verschieden in Formulierung und Inhalt sind. Der Urmensch sagt: „Komme in Frie-den, der du bringst die Fracht von Frieden und Heil! Wie geht es unseren Vätern, den Söhnen des Lichts in ihrer Stadt?\" Adam beklagt sein irdi-sches Los: „Wehe, wehe über den, der meinen irdischen Leib gebildet, und den, der meine Seele gefesselt hat, und die Rebellen, die mich unter-jocht haben.\" Wiederum anders formuliert ist die Antwort der Leben-digen Seele, wenn wir ihr Gespräch mit Zarathustra in die Reihe dieser Erlösungsdialoge stellen: „Ich, ich bin der zarte, unschuldige Sohn des Srösäw,36 ich bin im Zustand der Vermischung und erlebe Leid. Führe mich heraus aus der Umklammerung des Todes.\" Sie steht zwar der Antwort Adams nahe, insofern die Seele sich als ein leidendes Wesen vorstellt. Die Besonderheit ihrer Antwort besteht aber zum einen in ihrer unmotivierten Selbstvorstellung - Zarathustra wußte ja sehr gut, zu wem er entsandt worden war - und in der Hervorhebung ihrer Identität, die erzielt wird durch Verwendung, ja doppelte Verwendung des Personal-pronomens 'z ,ich'. Ihre Antwort beginnt mit den Worten 'z 'zhym ,ich, ich bin'. Diese Eigenheiten, die formelle Selbstvorstellung und die Be-tonung der Identität, kann man vergleichen mit der Selbstvorstellung des Gottes Haoma in dem avestischen Hymnus Yasna 9, dem sogenannten Höm-yast, der ein Kernstück der zoroastrischen Opferliturgie bildet. Dort beantwortet Haoma die Frage Zarathustras nach seiner Identität mit den Worten: „Ich, ο Zara9ustra, ich bin der asaheilige Haoma, der To-dabwehrer!\"37 (azam ahmi zaraOusta haomö asauua düraoSö).

The Shiite ritual cycle is dom-inated by mourning ceremonies commemorating the martyrdom of the Imams. Mourning as an expression of one's empathy with the sufferings of the members of the prophet's family and a source for salvation, and fasting as a means to control one's worldly desires play a prominent role. To Zoroastrians asceticism and self-mortification are foreign. Their reli-gious year is marked by joyous occasions with feasting and food sharing. Despite those main differences between the Zoroastrian minority and the Shiite majority one can also discover a lot of similarities. These be-come obvious when one has a further look on the rituals that are per-formed by both communities, especially those which are out of the framework of orthodoxy. One of the rituals that the two religious com-munities have in common is the so-called sofreh. The term sofreh liter-ally designates a tablecloth which is traditionally spread on the floor for the daily meals. During the ritual a prescribed selection of foodstuff and objects is displayed on it. In the Zoroastrian context a sofreh is part of many of the religious rituals. It plays especially a part in the cyclical gahämbärs, the six feasts of obligations. Through prayers and the liturgical recitation of the priest the food put on the sofreh becomes blessed and is then shared by the whole congregation. Beside the regular communal five-day feasts, there are also personal gahämbärs. These might be hold to show one's devo-tion, as contrition for some committed offence or as thanksgiving for escaping some kind of misfortune. In these cases they may be connected with a vow. ' 1 M.

Sofreh-ye Säh-e Pari: for this sofreh a room in the house is set apart. Once a year, on the same day, the sofreh is spread. The date is chosen by the hostess and differs from family to family. Black hens are killed and prepared. In some families this ritual is a tradition for many years. 2. Sofreh-ye Vahman-rüz (sopre-ye vahme rü)\\ this sofreh might be dis-played monthly on the day of Vahman (rüz-e Vahman)·, a more elaborate rite is performed on the day of Vahman in the month of Bahman. A sheep3 is slaughtered a day before the ritual takes place; it is put on the sofreh on rüz-e Vahman and consumed on the following day.4 3. Sofreh-ye Bîbï S eh Sanbeh (the lady of Tuesday), Btbi Hojjat (the lady of aspiration) and BïbïMorâd (the lady of desire): this ritual is held on Tuesdays. It will be described in detail later. 4. Sofreh-ye nohüd-e mosgelgosä (the problem solving chickpeas): this sofreh can be displayed any day. Traditionally chickpeas and raisins are used in the rite; today they are often mixed with other dried fruits and nuts—a mixture which is in Iran called âjïl.5 The rite of nohüd mosgel gosä can be a separate ritual but is also part of all other sofrehs. It will also be described in detail later. 2 See F. Mazdâpûr,\"Dar-âmadî bar sofreh-hä-ye moqaddas-e zardoSti\", Yad-e Bahar. Yäd-nämeh-ye Doktor Mehrdäd Bahär (Tehran, 1376 AHs/1997), pp. 383-387.

The votive sofrehs can also be found among Shiite Muslims in Iran.6 Iranian Muslims also display sofrehs in the secular New Year ceremony (sofreh haft sin) and the wedding ceremony (sofreh ye caqd), but these sofrehs are nondevotional and do not include the display of a ritual meal on the sofreh,7 The most common sofrehs in connection with a vow (sofrehhä-ye nazn) are: 1. Sofreh-ye Abü-l Fazl (the brother of the third Imam) Among Shiite women this is the most popular and abundant sofreh. It includes the preparation and consummation of different dishes, which are displayed on the sofreh. The meal normally consists of adas polo (lentil rice), äs (a thick soup), soleh zard (a rice pudding with saffron and rosewater), bread, ajïl, fruits and dates. 2. Sofreh-ye Imam Hasan (the second Imam) The ritual resembles the sofreh-ye Abü-l Faz.1 but everything put on the sofreh as well as the table cloth itself has to be green. 6 See e.g. A.H.

One can select between sabzeh (sprouted seeds of grains and legumes), sombol (hyacinths), sib (apple), sir (garlic), somäq (sumach), samanû (a thick paste made of germinating wheat), serkeh (vinegar), senjed (the fruit of the oleaster), sangak (a flat bread backed on small stones) und sekeh (coins). A living goldfish, a mirror, candles, coloured eggs and a Koran or the Diwân of Hafez complete the selection. During the wedding cere-mony (marâsem-e aqd) the bride and groom sit in front of the sofreh-ye aqd facing Mekka. At the other end of the sofreh stands a mirror. Candles, a Koran, prayer utensils (jä-ye namäz), gilded or silvered eggs and walnuts, pastries and bread with herbs and white cheese are also displayed on the sofreh. The exact selection of things displayed on the two sofrehs differs from region to region and family to family but the symbolic meaning always expresses fertility and regeneration.

The foodstuff displayed on the sofreh only contains bread, white cheese, herbs, and dates. 4. Sofreh-ye BïbïSeh Sanbeh (the lady of Tuesday), BïbïHûr (the Hüri lady) and BïbïNûr (the lady of light):8 this ritual is less orthodox as it is dedicated to supernatural beings of unclear origin. Like the Zoroastrian sofreh-ye BïbïSeh Sanbeh it is held on Tuesday. In the following it will be described in detail. Except for the sofreh-ye BïbïSeh Sanbeh, where a story is told,9 other Muslim sofrehs normally include a sermon and a rowzeh (a recitation recalling the sufferings of one of the Imams) followed by the do 'äy-e tawassol (a Shiite supplication for intercession). Then, the food dis-played on the sofreh is consumed in a ritual meal or distributed. The date ofthe sofrehs is chosen by the hostess. Very often a religious holiday is favoured. Mostly it is a single event after a wish fulfilled; in other cases the hostess has vowed to hold the sofreh regularly on a weekly, monthly or yearly basis.10 The aim of this paper is to compare the votive sofrehs of Shiite Mus-lims and Zoroastrians in today's Iran. The findings are based primarily on fieldwork.11 To get an impression of the course as well as the atmos-phere of the ritual I will first describe a sofreh that both communities have in common: the sofreh-ye BïbïSeh Sanbeh. 8 The Persian term Blhldesignates a respected lady. In colloquial language it is also used as a title for the grandmother as well as for female saints instead of hazral (dig-nity), eg. Blhl Fätemeh instead of Hazrat-e Fätemeh. 9 For one account of the story see Sokürzädeh, 'Aqäyed wa rosûm-e mardom-e Horasân, pp. 29-32. For a comparable ritual among Ismaili muslim women in Iran called âs-e Bîbî Murâd where also a story is told see M. Mills, \"A Cinderella Variant in the Context of Muslim Women's Ritual\", A Cinderella Casebook, ed. A. Dundes (New York/London, 1984), pp. 180-192. 10 If the sofreh coincides with a mourning day a rowzeh is recited. If it corresponds with the anniversary of the birth of Holy Beings (mowlûdî) it might also be combined with joyous mowlûdî-hânï, the singing of poems praising the prophet's family, although many of the women were convinced that crying is more effective for the fulfilling of wishes. A lot of sof-rehs take place in Ramadan, here the ritual meal matches with the fast-breaking meal (eftdr). 11 Sofrehs are part of my PhD research in progress on the religious life and rituals of Shiite women in Teheran. The fieldwork has been conducted primarily between 1998 and 1999, followed by regular shorter visits to Iran. In March and April 2002 I had the possibility of taking part in Zoroastrian sofrehs. I am indebted to the women who al-lowed me to enter into their religious meetings."},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"A MUSLIM SOFREH BIBISEH SANBEH A Tuesday morning in Teheran - Resälat. I arrive at the house of my friend's mother who is supposed to accompany me to her neighbour, where the sofreh will start early in the morning. She is reluctant to show me the place where the ritual takes place. Yesterday she had a conversa-tion with her niece who does religious studies in Qom and advised her not to take me there. To her mind those rituals are nothing else than su-perstition. She proposed instead to have a conversation with a clergy at Qom. She was afraid that taking part in the sofreh-ye BîbïSeh Sanbeh would let me get a wrong picture of Islam. Finally my friend arrives and convinces her mother to show me the place and accompany me there. The door of the courtyard is open, so that anyone can enter. About fif-teen women, mostly neighbours from the traditional under middleclass neighbourhood, are sitting on the floor around a white sofreh spread with bread, cheese and fresh herbs. Most of them wear a black cador, some only a scarf. The clothes of two women show that they come from some better quarters in the north of Teheran. For each guest there is also a small plastic bag with âjïl, a mixture of chickpeas, nuts, dried fruits, and noql (small sugar candies). The women are reading in the majatlh, a Shi-ite prayer manual.12 The hostess, a woman in the sixties, welcomes us, especially my friend's mother, because it is the first time that she takes part in the ritual although she is a close neighbour. She tells us that if we have a wish (hojjat) we can go to the kitchen to stir up the käcl, a pud-ding made with flour, sugar, oil, and saffron. Because it is the first time that we take part in the sofreh the fulfilling of our wishes is especially auspicious. The window of the kitchen is closed with a curtain. More than thirty years ago the hostess vowed to arrange this sofreh every week if she recovered from a severe illness. Her wish was granted and since then she has displayed the sofreh-ye Bïbï Seh Sanbeh every Tuesday. Female family members, friends, neighbours, and women from other parts of the city who heard about the miracles that have occurred come here to initiate their own vows. Some bring sweets and dates for distribution, some offer money to contribute to the expenses; others vow to sponsor three complete sofrehs. Two sofrehs are displayed before the fulfilment of the wish, the third more abundant one is held as a pledge 12 The mafâtïh al-janän (lit. 'the keys to paradise') is the most spread compendium of Shiite supplications. Together with the Koran it is used in nearly all religious rituals in Iran."},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"(gerow)—as the women say—until the wish is fulfilled. In these cases the hostess displays the sofreh in the name and in the intention (niyyat) of the sponsor. During the morning other women arrive, tea is served, and from time to time one of the women sends salawät, blessings to Mohammad and his family for the health of all participants and especially the hostess, for all people that are ill, for the souls of all deceased and for the return of the 12. Imam. Then the käcl is filled in small bowls, each covered with a plate, and put on the sofreh. After the lights have been turned off the hostess starts to recite the do 'ä-ye tawassol, a supplication for intercession, which ends in appeals that the wishes of all participants be granted, that all debts may be paid back, that all people suffering from cancer be healed, that all their sons may find a suitable bride and that all young people may follow the path of Islam. The women join in the choruses. Some start to cry. THE STORY OF THE OLD THORN DIGGER Then the hostess starts to recite the story of the old thorn digger (pïr-e härkan). His daughter suffers under her stepmother. She orders the girl to take the cow and the sheep to the pastures and spin the wool. After a windstorm scatters the wool and the girl loses the animals she meets three women, BïbïSeh Sanbeh, BïbïHûr and BïbïNûr, who solve her problem. While they are cooking käcl they tell her that she will meet the Shah's son and marry him and that she must then cook the käcl every Tuesday. Everything they foretell her comes true. But when on Tuesday the girl refuses the luxury food in the palace and instead cooks the käcl, the prince's mother sees her and gets angry because she behaves like a beggar. The prince gets upset, too, and kicks the pot with the käcl. Then he goes hunting and loses his way. Two melons in his saddle bag turn into severed heads and he is imprisoned. In prison he dreams of the three Bïbïs who tell him that his wife only performed her vow and that his mother had to apologize to his wife. This is done, his wife cooks the käcl again and the prince is freed from prison. After the end of the story the women once again send salawät, bless-ings to Mohammad and his family for the health of the living and for the well-being of the souls of the deceased. Then every woman removes the"},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"plate from her käci and looks for imprints on it, which are a sign that the Holy Being has been present and that the vow will be accepted. Tea is served and everybody starts to eat the kàcï. The women wrap cheese and herbs in the bread and take them home together with the âjïl for other family members, especially for the ill. The women start conversation tell-ing each other their family problems, their disputes with their daughters or mothers in law or the illness of family members and exchange their experiences with other forms of vows (nazr), like distributing food among the poor or sending a number of salawät. My friend's mother expresses that her attitude to the sofreh has changed completely. She tells me that she is impressed by the purity of intention (holüs-e niyyat) of the hostess and her guests and that she is now happy that she has ac-companied me. At about 12.30 p.m. the women start to leave. A ZOROASTRIAN SOFREH BlBlSEH SANBEH On another Tuesday morning in Teheran Pars a Zoroastrian sofreh-ye Bïbï Seh Sanbeh takes place. A white tablecloth is spread beside the kitchen-stove, a smaller green one is laid over it. At the back there are a mirror, a picture of Zoroaster, the Avesta, an electric light burning all the time, a rose water flagon and two sugar cones wrapped in green paper (qand-e sabz) and decorated with a silver bracelet. Three walnut shells are filled with oil and lit. Three sirog (a thin round of leavened dough fried in oil), an egg, a bowl of water with owisan (marjoram leaves) and three senjed (the fruit of the oleaster) and three coins, a glass with sarbat (water mixed with syrup), a white board with salt, sugar, herbs,and nuts, a plate with fruits cut open and another one with pastries are displayed on the sofreh. In the front there is a tray with chickpeas. A big pot with äs (a thick soup) is boiling on the stove. The women, about 25 persons, arrive early in the morning. Most are wearing fashionable clothes. Some bring along with them oil for the si-rog, others nohüd (chickpeas) and kesmes (raisins) or aß I which they pour on the tray in front of the sofreh. Others leave some money on the sofreh. Tea is served and the women start to converse. The hostess sometimes arranges the sofreh for the fulfilment of her own wishes, sometimes in the name of another woman who has made a vow. This time a friend of hers, living in India, has called her and asked her to spread a sofreh-ye Bïbï Seh Sanbeh for her."},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"THE STORY OF BIßT SEH SANBEH The women, then wearing a scarf, gather around the sofreh and the host-ess starts to tell the story of Blhl Seh Sanbeh. The story is told more elaborately with much more details, but in it's content it is very similar to the one told at the Muslim sofreh: a girl from a poor family that suf-fers from her stepmother can escape her bad luck by making a vow at a sofreh-ye BïbïSeh Sanbeh. She then marries the prince but is prevented by his family from fulfilling her vow. The prince gets accused for mur-der, but is freed after he asks his wife to make a vow for him. From then on they display an abundant sofreh each week. After the end of the story the hostess gives all the women a small amount of the water with owisän and a spoonful of sarbat. The ritual is continued by telling the story of nohüd-e mosgel gosä (the problem-solving chickpeas). While the story is told, the women clean the ajïl, picking out the chaff that is mixed with it and separating the pistachio shells. They pour the cleaned ajïl into bowls that have been put on the table. Throughout the story a small girl keeps on saying baleh (yes). THE STORY OF NOHÜD-E MOSGEL GOSÄ The story is about a wood gatherer and his daughter. They are so sunk in poverty that the father despaired. One day three beings clad in green ap-pear to him asking him some favours and bid him to buy nohüd (chick-peas), perform the rite of nohüd-e mosgel gosä and distribute them. As a gift they give him some small stones. These turn out to be jewels and he and his daughter become even richer than the king himself. His daughter befriends the princess but when her father goes on a pilgrimage his daughter neglects the rite of nohüd-e mosgel gosä. She is accused of stealing and put in prison. Her father returns and the three beings appear to him again in a dream advising him to continue to perform the rite of nohüd-e mosgel gosä. He does so and thereafter the innocence of his daugh-ter is established; she marries the prince and goes on performing the rite. After the end of the sofreh the women speak some personal prayers wishing each other that their wishes may be fulfilled. The äs is filled in bowls and distributed among the guests. Then tea and fruits are served. Some women, who had made a vow, fasted in the morning. The women who brought along nohüd, kesmes or âjïl are given a share of the cleaned"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"0/7/. The hostess advises them that they should distribute it in handfuls among the people whom they meet. She gathers the chaff to throw it into flowing water later on. After the women sat together and chatted, the hostess accompanied by some of the women goes to the fire-temple nearby pouring some of the ajïl on a tablet in the temple for everybody to eat. FORMAL SIMILARITIES The description makes clear that the votive sofrehs dedicated to BïbïSeh Sanbeh among Muslims and Zoroastrians share a lot of formal similari-ties: - A table cloth is spread on which special foodstuff is displayed; - Most of the sofrehs are displayed at home, traditionally in a room where no light falls in. Others might be spread at a shrine: a Zoroas-trian pïr or a Shiite imämzädeh; - A story is told and prayers are recited—the exact story differs at vari-ous sofrehs but the plot and the structure are always the same: the ex-istence of unjust suffering, the possibility of escaping one's own mis-fortune and poverty by performing the rite. Furthermore, the stories deal with female difficulties: the problems with the in-laws and the unfairness of husbands; - By telling the story the food becomes blessed; - Part of the food is consumed in a ritual meal, part of it taken home and distributed; - The sofreh is held to initiate or fulfil a vow. Other women use the ritual to make their own vows. Votive sofrehs among Zoroastrians and Muslims have—beyond their formal similarities—a lot of common features and functions which will be considered in the following. A WOMEN'S RITUAL In both communities it is a ritual, which is performed primarily by women. As mentioned in the literature and some interviews, other Zoro-astrian sofrehs like the sofreh-ye Vahman rüz may also be performed by men but it seems that the ritual is much more common among women. At one Zoroastrian sofreh-ye nohüd-e mosgel gosä I went to, men were"},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"only allowed to sit in the room beside but did not take part in the course of the ritual. Here the common roles of men and women in official ritu-als were reversed. At the sofreh-ye BïbïSeh Sanbeh men are strictly ex-cluded. Some Zoroastrian women argued that the supernatural being in-voked is a woman and therefore nä-mahram (not allowed to non-kin males).13 This exclusion even concerns pregnant women because they might be expecting a boy. According to Muslim traditions men seeing the sofreh would risk get-ting blind and pregnant women would endanger a male child. The sofreh can so be seen as an expression of female power. The women are in con-tact with supernatural beings that are dangerous especially for men, but might also be beneficial if their power is mediated by the women in the right way. Although the notions about the dangerous effects of the sof-rehs are told more or less jokingly today, men are not yet allowed to en-ter the house during the ritual. The exclusion of men is especially pro-nounced at the sofreh-ye Bïbï Seh Sanbeh but is also true for nearly all other Muslim sofrehs. Betteridge and Mills/Jamzadeh mention sexual integrated rituals but during my nearly two years' fieldwork in Teheran I never came across a Muslim sofrehs where men participated.14 On the other hand, what most of the time is ignored in the literature, the women—Muslim as well as Zoroastrians—sometimes display the sofreh in the name of a male family member or acquaintance who pays for the expenses. Especially if the person concerned is not a close family member he normally adds some extra money to compensate for the woman's effort. In these cases the women act as intercessors between the believer and the supernatural being. This forms a contrast to the religious guidance by male religious authorities elsewhere. Whereas in the gähämbär feasts the blessing of the food is done by a priest no official religious authority is involved, in the sofrehs. The con-tact with the Holy Beings takes place directly and not through male me-diation. Preparation and accomplishment of the ritual are completely un-der the control of the hostess and her female guests. It is through telling the story that the foodstuff gets blessed. The same is true for the Muslim votive sofreh. Even in sofrehs where a preacher is invited, his or her role is much more marginal than in other Shiite rituals like rowzehs. On the other side the ritual gives women of both communities the possibility of 13 Sohräb, \"Sofreh-ye BTbT Seh Sanbeh\", p. 42. 14 Betteridge,\"The Controversial Vows of Urban Women in Iran\", p. 107; Jamzadeh/ Mills, \"Iranian Sofreh: From Collectivity to Female Ritual\", pp. 41-42."},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"acting as ritual specialists without having a religious education. They only have to know the correct wording of the story and the traditional instructions to be able to display the sofreh for other woman. Muslim women's behaviour in the public, their participation in the official religious rituals and their access to religious posts is restricted. The same is true, while to a lesser extent, for Zoroastrian women. Al-though many sources emphasise the higher gender equality among Zoro-astrians,15 women are as well excluded from higher religious positions and cannot become priests. In most of the orthodox rituals they play a marginal role. In contrast, the sofrehs express female autonomy and in-fluence and reflect female experiences.16 The story told deals with com-mon problems of women like disputes with mothers and sisters in law that can be overcome with the help of the ritual. The essential point of the ritual is the preparation, consummation and distribution of food. Food is one of the few resources controlled by women. Here the women reproduce their traditional roles as nurturers and carers of their families. At the same time they imbue with higher meaning their everyday domestic labour. The women whose presence at the official places of worship is re-stricted turn the domestic space of the house into a place of worship. They use their domestic skills to get in contact and strengthen their ties with the supernatural to use these forces for their own purposes and the well-being of their relatives. In her study on the religious life of Jewish women Susan Sered has called this process the \"domestication of religion\".17 A RITUAL OUT OF THE FRAMEWORK OF ORTHODOXY In both communities votive sofrehs are more or less marginal rituals, which are not mentioned in the religious writings. Most of the Zoroastrian priests (mobed, PI. mobedän), reject the votive sofrehs as pure superstition. Whereas the making of vows—referring to several verses of the Koran—is accepted by the Shiite clergy and its rules are extensively discussed in their religious writings, sofrehs are criticized as an unislamic invention (beef at). 15 For a critical review, cf. J.K. Choksy, Evil, Good, and Gender. Facets of the Femi-nine in Zoroastrian History (Toronto Studies in Religion 28; New York et al., 2002). 16 About female religious participation and women in ritual and symbolic roles, cf. J. Hoch-Smith/A. Spring (eds), Introduction to Women in Ritual and Symbolic Roles (New York/London, 1978), pp. 1-23. 17 S. Sered, Women as Ritual Experts: The Religious Lives of Elderly Jewish Women in Jerusalem (New York/Oxford, 1992), pp. 6-10."},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"Some female preachers even refuse to offer their services. The Islamic government in Iran, which instrumentalizes other religious rituals for their own ideological purposes, also discards the sofrehs,18 Another point of criticism which especially concerns the sofreh-ye Bïbï Seh Sanbeh is the obscure identity of the supernatural beings in-voked. Muslim women gave different answers about the identity of Bïbï Seh Sanbeh (the lady of Tuesday), BïbïHûr (the Huri lady) and BïbïNûr (Lady of Light); some referred to them as the daughters of the 7. Imam, others as the wives of Imam Hasan or identified them as Fätemeh (the daughter of the prophet Mohammad), Hadïjeh (the prophet's wife) and Zeynab (the sister of Imam Huseyn).19 Some women also called the ritual sofreh-ye Fätemeh instead of Bïbï Se h Sanbeh to avoid criticism. Instead of telling the story they chant a rowzeh. Most of the Zoroastrian women I asked about Bïbï Seh Sanbeh referred to the story and told me that there are three ladies called BïbïSeh Sanbeh, BïbïHojjat (lady of aspiration) and Bïbï Moräd (lady of desire) that have the power to assist people in trouble, without further specifying their identity. Here it is strange that the sofreh is dedicated to a lady called Seh Sanbeh (Tuesday) although the Zoroastrians do not have a division in weeks. A mobed in Yazd was of the opinion that the votive sofrehs were an alien loan from the Mus-lims, a view also mentioned to Jamzadeh by one of her informants.20 Ac-cording to another view the history of the sofrehs dates back to pre-Zoroastrian times.21 In the Muslim context there is a long debate about the sofrehs. Criti-cism concerns especially the way the sofrehs are held.22 As they require 18 Although there are no official declarations. 19 Sokürzädeh was told that BTbT Hür und Bïbï Nur were the daughters of the prophet Mohammad and Bïbï Seh Sanbeh a holy women who accompanied the two.

Mazdäpür, Teheran, 1.4.2002. Because there are no written traditions and historical accounts it seems difficult to trace back the history of the Muslim as well as the Zoroastrian sofreh rituals.

Women's magazines of the Shah's time gave advice where to order the best pastry and flower arrangements. A large amount of different dishes is prepared and consumed. The women are dressed in the latest fashion and the meeting normally ends with mu-sic and dancing. Thus the sofrehs have been criticised as a pseudo-religious excuse for a party. For many women from traditional families it is much easier to spend time and money on a female religious gathering if they can refer to a religious reason.23 Compared to Zoroastrian sofrehs it seems that the preparation of different dishes and the ritual meal play a far more important role at Muslim sofrehs. For Zoroastrians the feature of food sharing is more pronounced during the gahämbärs. As the separation of sexes and the restrictions of women are stricter among Muslims it seems that the informal meeting following the ritual itself is therefore more important. For many more modem Muslim women the sofrehs have assumed a folkloric character. Hospitality, the preparation of traditional dishes, the communal meal, and the cooperation of the women are seen as an ex-pression of Iranian culture and tradition. Further one can observe a secu-larisation of the ritual that becomes obvious in the things displayed on the sofreh. A volume ofthe Qur'än, the prayer utensils (jä-ye namäz), and a rosary (tasblh) which have traditionally been put on the sofrehs— equivalent to the Avesta and the picture of Zoroaster on the Zoroastrian sofrehs—are no longer displayed.24 d'Iran (Paris, 1991), pp. 128-131 ; Jamzadeh/Mills, \"Iranian Sofreh: From Collective to Female Ritual\", pp. 35-36; Betteridge, \"The Controversial Vows of Urban Women in Iran\", p. 104; Hanomhâ-ye Tehran! wa sofreh-ye Hazrat-ecAbbäs, Bänewän (Teheran 1350/1971), p. 12 (The women of Teheran and the sofreh for Hazrat-e c Abbâs). 23 For the way women use religion to forward their own purposes and negotiate worldly concerns, compare Lewis' study on the zar cult: I.M. Lewis, Ecstatic Religion. A Study of Shamanism and Spirit Possession (London, 1989/1971). 24 In the Muslim context many of the traditional rules have lost their significance. The women should have obtained the ingredients for the meal by begging from house-holds who had a family member named Fätimeh. The sofreh with a volume of the Qur'än, prayer utensils (jä-ye namäz), and a rosary (tasblh) as well as some ingredients for the meal had to be spread the evening before the ritual and kept in a locked room. The next morning the hostess looked for signs that the supernatural beings had been present. Thus it was believed that the visit occurred over night and in the private, not during the ritual itself. At least in the urban context these rules are no longer observed in most cases."},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"The private character of the ritual as well as the fact that the Islamic establishment, which exercises power in Iran, rejects it, has increased its popularity especially among the Shiite women who are critical to the government. In today's Iran the way the sofreh is held is also a political statement. An example is a sofreh with music and dance that took place on the anniversary of Khomeini's death. SPACE FOR INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY The rules concerning the way the sofreh should be displayed are not written down but passed on from generation to generation by oral tradi-tions. Each sofreh has its own fittings, character, and atmosphere, which depend on the beliefs and taste of the hostess and her guests and emerges in the interaction of all participants. The absence of written traditions about sofrehs among Zoroastrians as well as Muslims leaves broad space for innovation and creativity. In a Zoroastrian sofre-yeh BïbïSeh Sanbeh that I went to see, pictures of Maria, Jesus, and a Sikh leader were placed next to the picture of Zo-roaster. As the hostess explained, a women clad in a white long dress had appeared to her in a dream advising her to do so. This is an example for an innovation that would be impossible at an official ritual. Dreams play an important role in connection with Zoroastrian as well as Muslim sofrehs. Sometimes it was a dream that made a woman initiate a sofreh. In dreams the women were told where and when to spread the sofreh, which items to put on the tablecloth and which sofreh they should choose. The aesthetic and ludic elements play an important part at the sofrehs. Muslim women spend long time on the preparation and decoration of the dishes served. The äjil-e mosgel gosä—part of all sofrehs, although the telling of the story has passed out of use—is wrapped in lace and tied with red ribbon. At a sofreh-ye Imam Hasan the women wore green eye shadow and nail polish because everything connected with the sofreh should be green. Sofrehs offer women a space for self-expression. They can communi-cate their perceptions, feelings and aspirations and share and negotiate them with others.25 25 For a description and similar interpretation of women's secular dramatic games see S.

For the role of"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"SUPERNATURAL INTERCESSION TO EARTHLY PROBLEMS In Zoroastrian as well as in Muslim sofrehs the focus is making and ful-filling vows (nazr). Muslim as well as Zoroastrians emphasise that the inner intention (niyyat) is most important. Different from gahämbärs in the Zoroastrian context, or rowzehs and prayer session in the Shiite ritual cycle votive sofrehs do not aim primarily at celebrating the general com-munal well-being or accumulating religious merit for the other world but achieving concrete results for actual earthly problems. The supernatural being is invoked to get active now and in this world. In return, the women promise to display sofrehs. They try to bind the Holy Beings into the system of gift exchange. Here the women use their domestic skills to establish a privileged relationship to the supernatural being.26 At the same time they strengthen their social networks. These networks also include Iranians living in exile and Parsis in India who mediate their vows by telephone calls. The common problems addressed are not bound to religion, but concern human and especially female problems: to find a suitable husband, to get pregnant, to bear sons, to be cured from an ill-ness, to pass the University exam or to solve financial problems. Beside private problems the women also make more general vows though this is more seldom. During my fieldwork some Muslim women vowed for the victory of the Iranian football team or the success of the religious reform-ists in the elections. Sometimes the motive addressed in the story told at the sofrehs -misfortune that came over the wood gatherer's daughter after she ne-glected the rite—is picked up in the history of one's own life. Some Muslim as well as one Zoroastrian women told me that they used to dis-play a sofreh, and then neglected the rite due to financial problems or the change of their house. They then became ill or lost their wealth, but after religious rituals in the life of Muslim women, cf. A.

Especially in times of crises the miraculous solving of problems be-comes more appealing giving the actors a feeling of control. During the war with Iraq sofrehs have increased between Muslims as well as Zoro-astrians. Among both religious communities there are a lot of stories about miracles that happened at the sofrehs. These stories have a deci-sive influence on the number of participants. A Zoroastrian man reported that a sofreh-ye Sah Pari near Kerman became so popular and attracted so many female visitors that the mobedän even asked help from the local police to prevent the women's activities. Their efforts failed because of the women's resistance. I was recounted a similar accident concerning a regular Muslim open-house sofreh held in Teheran for more than twenty years. Every week it attracts several hundred women who have heard about the miracles that have occurred. The brothers of the hostess forced her to sell their parents' home where the sofreh took place. With the support of other women, the hostess managed to buy a building nearby and to continue with the ritual. An important reason that the sofrehs are criticized in both communi-ties by the primarily male religious orthodoxy is that they are an initia-tive undertaken by women independently and unsupervised. The women thus evade male dominance in the domestic as well as the religious do-main. The reference to a higher reality enables them to agency.

ZARATHUSTRISCHE TRADITIONSLINIEN EINER PERSISCHEN GEBETSGATTUNG ZWISCHEN INDIEN UND IRAN Beate Schmermbeck „Zarathustrische Monägät\" ist ein Terminus, der bei den meisten westli-chen Orientalisten mindestens stimrunzelndes Erstaunen, in der Regel aber eher eine belehrende Mimik auslöst: Ein Missverständnis müsse vorliegen, denn Monägät, das seien ausschließlich islamische mystisch inspirierte Gebete, die in der großen Tradition des persischen Dichters c Abdolläh Ansäri stünden. Von zarathustrischen Monägät hingegen habe man noch nie gehört. Auch unter den Zarathustriern stiftet dieser Begriff häufig eher Verwirrung als dass er geeignet schiene, indigene Erinne-rungen oder Assoziationen zu wecken. „Monägät\", so lautet die allge-meine Reaktion, „sind islamische Gebete und können daher schon per definitionem nicht zarathustrisch sein.\"1 Mit diesem Argument begegne-ten vor allem die höhergebildeten Zarathustrier Irans meiner Frage nach der Existenz und Bedeutung von Monägät unter den heutigen Mazday-asnan. Die Reaktion der theologisch gebildeten, ,schriftkundigen' Za-rathustrier reichte sogar noch weiter: Als islamischem Brauchtum, das sich auf unlautere Weise in die zarathustrischen Traditionen eingeschli-chen habe und sich damit der ,reinen Lehre Zarathustras' als hetzeri-scher Tand' beigeselle, wurde diesem Gebetsgenre schlichtweg seine Daseinsberechtigung im zarathustrischen Milieu abgesprochen. Während meine Nachforschungen in den genannten Kreisen der zarathustrischen Gemeinden Irans mehrheitlich Entrüstung und Gegenwehr provozierten, stand die junge Generation meinen Erkundungen gänzlich unvoreinge-nommen gegenüber: So wenig waren sie bisher in ihrem religiösen All-tag von Monägät berührt worden, dass sie—von der Existenz dieser Ge-bete völlig überrascht—auf meine Fragen in stumme Meinungslosigkeit verfielen. 1 Die hier und in der Folge beschriebenen Antworten und Reaktionen ergaben sich infolge von Gesprächen mit Orientalisten und Zarathustriern in Deutschland und im Rahmen zweier 2001 in Iran durchgeführter Feldstudien."},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"Sollten die schönklingenden Gebetslieder, die ehemals zum festen re-ligiösen Ritual-Repertoire gehörten, im heutigen religiösen Alltag der Zarathustrier Irans wirklich keine Rolle mehr spielen? Bevor diese Frage beantwortet wird, soll zuerst die islamische Mo-nägät-Tradition skizziert und der Weg der Gebete aus dem islamischen Kontext hinaus in das zarathustrische Umfeld beschrieben werden. Dar-auf folgt eine Betrachtung der historischen und gegenwärtigen Bedeu-tung von Monägät bei den Parsen Indiens, die den Blick dann zunächst in vergleichender Weise auf die heutige Rolle der Gebetslieder bei den Zarathustriern Irans lenkt. Zwei Textbeispiele aus dem iranisch-zara-thustrischen Milieu dienen dazu, das Gebetsgenre inhaltlich vorzustellen und seine Eingebundenheit in den rituellen Alltag der Zarathustrier Irans zu illustrieren. 1. ISLAMISCHE MONÄGÄT-TRADITION Die Ursprünge des Gebetsgenre Monägät reichen zurück bis in den Iran des frühen 10. Jahrhunderts. Damals soll bereits der Sufi-Meister al-Goneyd auf Arabisch ein Kitäb al-Munägät verfasst haben, von dem heute jedoch nichts mehr erhalten geblieben ist. Ähnlich erging es den Monägät von Sehäb al-Din al-Sohrawardi, die—ebenfalls in arabischer Sprache verfasst—verloren gegangen sind.2 In der ganzen islamischen Welt bekannt wurden demgegenüber die Monägät von Hwäge cAbdolläh Ansäri (gest. 1089), des berühmten Dichters persischer Poesie und Pro-sa, der im Orient in einem Atemzug mit Monägät genannt wird. Die Monägät Ansäris sind, wie die meisten seiner Werke, erst nach seinem Tod von seinen Schülern niedergeschrieben und später zu sogenannten ,Monägät-näme\" kompiliert worden. In unzähligen, zum Teil prunkvol-len Editionen wurden die Gebete Ansäris im vergangenen Jahrhundert einer breiten Öffentlichkeit zugänglich gemacht und sind heute im gan-zen Orient erhältlich.3 Die in rhythmischer Reimprosa verfassten Gebete beginnen typi-scherweise mit der Invocatio Elähi („mein Gott\") und künden von der 2 C.E.

Trotz sprachlicher Schlichtheit hochkünstlerisch komponiert und mit einer bei-spielgebenden, mystisch inspirierten Metaphorik versehen, gelten die Monägät Ansäris in ihrer Schönheit bis heute als unübertroffen. Schon früh wurden sie zum Vorbild für die Ansäri nachfolgenden Poeten. Sa-nä3i (gest. 1130), cAttär (12. Jh.) und Sacdi (gest. 1292) ließen sich in ihrer Dichtung von seinen Monägät anregen4 und legten damit Zeugnis ab von der großen Popularität, die seine Gebete bereits kurz nach seinem Tod erreicht hatten. Im Kreis der Familie anlässlich religiöser Feste oder in Momenten innerer Besinnung und Zurückgezogenheit rezitiert, sind Monägät auch heute noch lebendiger Bestandteil der religiösen Alltagskultur der Iraner. Nicht wenige beherrschen eine bisweilen stattliche Anzahl von Ansäris Gebetsversen auswendig und können sie aus dem Stegreif aufsagen. Die Sprache der Monägät ist Persisch und damit den meisten Iranern—im Gegensatz zum Arabischen der offiziellen Gebete—von Kindheit an ver-traut. Unabhängig von einem institutionellen Rahmen können sie immer und überall gebetet werden und entsprechen damit dem Bedürfnis des Gläubigen nach individueller, konventionsloser Hinwendung zu Gott. Jan Rypkas Definition des Terminus Monägät betont diesen besonderen vertraulichen, informellen Charakter, wenn er das Monägät als „einen intimen Dialog der Seele mit Gott in Form eines Monologs\" bezeichnet.5 Durch die freie Wahl von Gebetszeit, -text und dem Persischen als Spra-che unterscheiden sich Monägät von den offiziellen muslimischen Gebe-ten, wie etwa dem salât, und konstituieren auf diese Weise einen eige-nen Gebetstypus. 2. MONÄGÄT IM ZARATHUSTRISCHEN KONTEXT Von der westlichen Forschung unbemerkt hat dieses Gebetsgenre weni-ge Jahrhunderte nach Ansäri seinen ursprünglich islamischen Kontext verlassen und wird seitdem auch von den Zarathustriern gepflegt, die sich von den islamischen Vorbildern zum Verfassen eigener Monägät inspirieren ließen.6 Weitgehend ungeklärt ist, wer diese islamische Tradi-4 J.

Jahrhundert bei den Zarathustriern Indiens einführten.10 Zahlreiche Verse, die uns heute als Monägät vorliegen, waren allerdings schon vor dem 18. Jahrhundert von Zarathustriern in Indien verfasst worden. Zu ihnen gehören u.a. die Zweizeiler von Dastur Däräb Hor-mazdyär, dem Kompilator persischer Sendschreiben, der im 17. Jahr-hundert lebte.11 In den Rang einer in Indien an Popularität weit um sich greifenden Gebetsgattung scheinen diese Gott preisenden Verse jedoch letztlich erst von Dastur Däräb Pählan (1667-1734/1735) und Mollä Firuz (1757-1830) erhoben worden zu sein.

Es existieren besondere Monägät für das Zu-bettgehen und das morgendliche Aufstehen sowie Verse, die unabhängig von den offiziellen Gebeten anlässlich zentraler Ereignisse im Lebens-zyklus, wie zum Beispiel Hochzeiten, rezitiert werden.19 Shernaz Cama, die derzeit im Rahmen eines von der UNESCO geförderten Projekts die Bedeutung von Monägät unter den Zarathustriern Indiens untersucht,20 stellt fest, dass die Rezitation von Monägät bei den Parsen bis in die zweite Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts weit verbreitet war. Besonderes Au-genmerk widmet sie der Tatsache, dass viele beliebte Monägät nicht schriftlich fixiert waren, sondern häufig mündlich von den Eltern an die Kinder, in der Regel von der Mutter an die Tochter weitergegeben wur-den. Hervorzuheben ist, dass Monägät nicht aufgesagt, sondern gesun-gen wurden. Da dies häufig im Chor im Kreis der Familie oder Gemein-de stattfand, erfüllten Monägät zudem eine identitätsbildende und das Zusammengehörigkeitsgefühl stärkende Aufgabe.21 Im Zuge einer Bewegung unter den Parsen Indiens, die sich seit eini-gen Jahren verstärkt um die Revitalisierung bereits verschollen geglaub-ter alter Traditionen bemüht, rücken auch Monägät wieder in den Fokus der Aufmerksamkeit.

BEDEUTUNG VON MONÄGÄT BEI DEN ZARATHUSTRIERN IM HEUTIGEN IRAN Während sich die Monägät-Tradition somit in Indien gegenwärtig eines neu erwachten Interesses erfreut, scheint dieses Gebetsgenre in Iran fast gänzlich aus dem religiösen Alltag der Zarathustrier verschwunden zu sein. Auf den ersten Blick zeugen lediglich die Veröffentlichungen ein-zelner Monägät in den wenigen erhalten gebliebenen alten Khorde Avesta-Ausgaben davon, dass die Gebetslieder zumindest bis in die fünfziger Jahre des 20.

Auf diese Weise verbreiteten sich auch Monägät von Parsi-Autoren unter den Zarathustriern Irans und wurden von ihnen in das persönliche Gebetspensum integriert. Besondere Beliebtheit schienen auch hier die Gebete von Mollä Firuz zu genießen, dessen Monägät in den Augen der meisten von mir befragten Zarathustrierinnen gleichsam als Synonym für das Gebetsgenre insgesamt gelten.23 Daneben erschienen in den Editionen des Khorde Avesta jedoch auch Monägät, die von iranischen Za-rathustriern verfasst worden waren. Unter diesen iranischen Monägät-Autoren ragten zarathustrische Gelehrte wie Mubad Sahreyär Hodäbahs (19. Jh.) oder Bahräm Rävari heraus.24 Damit wurde nun auch von irani-22 Zwei Beispiele für musikalische Neuinterpretationen nennt Russell, \"Parsi Zoro-astrian Garbäs und Monäjäts\", p. 54.

Den ältesten Nachweis eines 87 Bait langen Monägät von Mubad Sahreyär Hodäbahs in einem Khorde Avesta fand ich in der 1872 in Bombay erschienenen Edition von Mubad Tirändäz Mubad Ardasir. Ein 148 Bait umfassendes Gebet von Bahräm Rävari scheint zum ersten Mal 1853 in einem Khorde Avesta Aufnahme gefunden zu haben. Beide Ge-bete handeln von der Einzigartigkeit und der Schöpfertätigkeit Gottes und sind Bitt- und Dankgebet zugleich.

Sie wird von Säh-Bahräm Beliväni am Ende seines 1986/1987 erschienenen Büchleins über zarathustrische Wallfahr-ten25 genannt und ist infolge ihrer Kürze (11 Bait) um den literarischen Einschub der Beschreibung des postmortalen Gerichts und der individu-ellen Glaubensfindung beschnitten. 1 hodä-yä bozorgi to-rä hwod sazä-st 2 tö dänätar az gomle dänandegän 3 sepäs az tö ey häleq-e dastgir 4 hodä-yä sepäs az tö har nafas 5 sepäs az tö ey däwar-e kerdegär 6 hodä-yä tö az lotf dast-am begir 7 be ruy-am dar-e rahmat-at bäz kon 8 nahwäham kasi cun tö kas bäsi-am 9 man-am garq-e daryä-ye gorm ö gonäh 10 hodä-yä tö az lotf benawäzi-am 11 tö bepazir yä rabb monägät-e mä ke dar har dö giti-atfarmän rawä-st tö ruzi-deh-e gomle bandegän sepäs az tö ey qäder-e har faqir ke ruzi-resän-i wa faryäd ras sepäs az tö dädär-e parwardegär agar ce gonahkär-am cozr-am pazir ma-rä dar dö giti saräfräz kon ke dar har dö giti tö bas bäsi-am walikan be lotf-e tö däram negäh dehi dar har dö giti saräfräzi-am bedeh yä rabb az lotf hägät-e mä 1 Ο Gott, Größe ist Dir wahrhaft würdig, denn Dein Befehl gilt in den beiden Welten 2 Du bist weiser als alle Gelehrten, Du bist der Spender des täglichen Brotes fur alle Geschöpfe 3 Dank sei Dir, ο helfender Schöpfer, Dank sei Dir, ο Mächtiger über alle Armen 25 S.-B.

Je-weils zwei Halbverse sind durch Endreim miteinander verbunden und bilden einen Zweizeiler (Bait), der inhaltlich eine unabhängige Einheit formuliert. Durch die Aneinanderreihung mehrerer Bait nach dem Mus-ter a-a, b-b, c-c etc. entsteht ein Masnawi, d.h. ein seiner Form nach end-los weiterzuführendes Versmuster, das in der persischen Poesie häufig als Basis fur episch angelegte Werke benutzt wird. Inhaltlich ist das Masnawi zweigeteilt: Die Bait 1 -5 sind durch Gott lobende und dan-kende Sequenzen geprägt, während in Bait 6-11 an Gott gerichtete Bit-ten und Erwartungen formuliert werden. Damit entspricht das Gebet ei-nem für schriftlich fixierte Monägät häufig verwendeten Grundmuster, das nach dem Lob und Dank Gottes inhaltlich die Bitte folgen lässt. Die Anerkennung bzw. das Lob Gottes drückt sich in der Verwen-dung beschreibender Formulierungen aus: Gottes „Größe\", seine All-macht (Bait 1 ) und seine alle Menschen überragende Weisheit (Bait 2) werden gepriesen. Die Beschreibung Gottes als „Spender des täglichen Brotes\" (Bait 2 und 4) sowie der in Bait 3 ausgedrückte Gedanke einer besonderen Hinwendung Gottes zu den Armen („Mächtiger über alle Armen\") skizzieren das Bild eines fürsorgenden, materielle Mangel be-seitigenden Gottes.

In Bait 6 und 10 schafft dabei die Verwendung einer physischen Metaphorik eine persönliche Beziehung zwischen Gott und dem Menschen: „ergreife ... meine Hand\", „liebkose mich mit Deiner Güte\". Das Gebet transportiert eine Metaphorik, die weitgehend der islami-schen Poesie entlehnt ist. Mit Bildern, die einen „das tägliche Brot spen-denden\", den Menschen zugewandten, verzeihenden Gott beschreiben, knüpft das Gebet an gängige Motive persisch-islamischer Populärlitera-tur an, die in den zarathustrisch-theologischen Schriften keine Erwäh-nung finden, sondern teilweise sogar in Spannung zu ihr stehen. So er-wähnen die Priester-Schriften zwar einen gerecht urteilenden und han-delnden Ahura Mazda, versagen dem Menschen jedoch Gnade und Sün-denvergebung beim postmortalen Gericht. Das Monägät scheint daher in seinen Aussagen in besonderem Maße jenen Bedürfnissen des Gläubigen zu entsprechen, die von der theologi-schen Literatur unbeantwortet bleiben. Dabei begegnet es dem Betenden in seinem Wunsch nach Vergebung, Annahme und Nähe zu Gott und bereitet ihm so eine sehr persönliche und private Ebene der Kommunika-tion mit dem Göttlichen. Waren die Gebetslieder von Bahräm Rävari, Sahreyär Hodäbahs und Mollä Firuz bis in die fünfziger Jahre des 20. Jahrhunderts noch regel-mäßig in die in Iran verbreiteten Ausgaben des Khorde Avesta integriert, so ist seit etwa 40 Jahren zu beobachten, dass Monägät in den Neudru-cken der Gebetsbücher nicht mehr erscheinen.26 Die Gründe dafür mö-gen in dem im 20. Jahrhundert im Iran aufgekommenen religiösen Dis-kurs liegen, der zur Hinterfragung alter Rituale und Gebräuche führte und teilweise von einer Fixierung auf die Zarathustra zugeschriebene avestische Literatur, insbesondere die Gäthä, charakterisiert ist. Vor die-sem Hintergrund waren sicher auch Monägät in das Sperrfeuer der Dis-kussion geraten und einseitig wegen ihres in islamischen Traditionen 26 Eine Ausnahme ist die 1363 h.s.

Diese Generation war noch mit den Gebetsliedern aufgewachsen und hatte sie von den Eltern bzw. Großeltern oder im Religionsunterricht gelernt. Un-berührt vom modernen religiösen Diskurs standen diese Männer und Frauen den althergebrachten Traditionen noch vorbehaltlos gegenüber und pflegten sie intensiv. In Teheran machte ich die Bekanntschaft einer älteren Dame, die die Verse von Bahräm Rävari regelmäßig im Feuer-tempel singend rezitierte; in Yazd traf ich einen älteren Herrn und einige älteren Damen, die sowohl die Monägät von Bahräm Rävari als auch die von Mollä Firuz gelegentlich in privater Umgebung beteten, wobei die Frauen die Verse im Gesang vortrugen. Zahlreiche Personen berichteten, sich daran zu erinnern, dass ihre verstorbenen Eltern oder Großeltern des öfteren Monägät beteten. Zwar vermochte keine der befragten Personen ein Monägät der oben erwähnten Autoren auswendig aufzusagen, jedoch zeigte die große Gewandtheit beim Vortragen der Gebete aus dem Khor-de Avesta, dass sie mit Text und Rezitations- bzw. Gesangsrhythmus durchaus vertraut waren. Während die Gebete von Bahräm Rävari und Mollä Firuz, die als Texte im Khorde Avesta in Iran bis zur Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts weit verbreitet waren, kaum memoriert sondern abgelesen wurden, erinnerten sich viele befragte Zarathustrierinnen noch lebhaft an ein Gebet, das sie aus dem Gedächtnis heraus vortragen konnten.

Parallelen zu den Monägät Ansäris finden sich auch in anderen Zeilen: So erinnert die aneinandergereihte Aufzählung der Eigenschaften Gottes (Zeile 20-25) an ähnliche Sequenzen im Monägät-näme,33 Das Gebet macht jedoch auch Anleihen bei anderen Dichtem: Bei dem das Monägät abschließenden Robäf handelt es sich um einen so genannten „wandernden Vierzeiler\" (Robäci-ye gardande), der häufig Omar Hayyäm zugeschrieben wird.34 Die Entlehnung einzelner Passa-gen aus den Werken anderer Autoren widerspricht der Option, dass es sich um ein einheitliches Gebet aus der Hand eines um Originalität be-strebten Verfassers handeln könnte. Vielmehr entsteht der Eindruck ei-ner variablen Sammlung populärer Verssequenzen.

Even in some fire temples and minor shrines a picture of the so called \"Green Pïr\" or \"Cakcakü\"—the \"dripping mountain\" (cak-cak-küh), as the name is often popularly etymologized—is on display. This virtual omnipresence of Pïr-e Sabz which has become a major pilgrim-age centre (zeyärat-gäh) for Zoroastrians not only from Iran but from all over the world, is in sharp contrast to the wide range of less well known—or almost only locally known—Zoroastrian shrines in modem Iran.2 These are to be found mainly in the city of Yazd, its suburbs and surrounding villages, and in and around Kermän. The Zoroastrians of Iran (Zartosti) refer to their shrines as pïr, in plu-ral plrän, or pirün in the colloquial form. Although the Zoroastrian pïr shows some personalised features in legends and stories surrounding the 'holy', literally 'clean' or 'pure' places (gäh-e päk), they do not refer to 'historical' saints or holy persons as is the case in Muslim usage. Zoroas-trian plrän-gäh, as shrines are also called, can be affiliated with histori-cal persons (pre-Islamic or modem) or Zoroastrian 'deities' (izedän, sing.: ïzed). However, what is seen in the pïr as an acting force seems to be some more abstract or 'numinous' power which occasionally can take 'human' shape.3 Since the shrines are 'visited' (zeyärat-kardan) by the 1 I am very much indebted to Dr. Raoul Motika, Dr. David Shankland, and Prof. Dr. Jan Snoek for thorough reading of and many helpful comments to this article.

To take this broader his-torical and cultural context into account is justified by two facts. First, we do not have historical accounts on Zoroastrian shrines dating from before the 17th century. Second, the structural parallels between Zoroas-trian shrines and the Shiite Emäm-zäde—the most prominent example for Iranian 'holy places'—are striking. Both phenomena include devo-tional practices focused on a specific locality, in the form of either a sin-gle, individual visit (zeyärat) or as (mass) pilgrimage, which even Zoro-astrians sometimes refer to with the Muslim term hagg.u The parallels of Shiite and Zoroastrian conceptions of 'holy persons' are most striking when stories of the disappearance (geyb-sodan) of a member of the Säsänian dynasty are told in connection with a Zoroastrian shrine. Just as the twelfth Imam of the Itnä-^asariyya ('Twelver Shiites') disappeared (gaybat = 'disappearance'), so also the Säsänians fleeing the Arabo-Muslim invaders were 'rescued' by God who made them disappear into rocks, mountains, or wells. In that case the term mazär is most likely to be used by Zoroastrians. It has to be noted here that in modem Fârsï (New-Persian) mazär has gained the semantic connotation of'tomb' or (underground) 'grave'. When revered persons—such as family and court members of the last Säsänian ruler—were dislocated and thereby 'saved' from Arabo-Muslim attack, it seems appropriate for Zoroastrians to use mazär (in the meaning of'underground grave'), because these Säsänian princesses and princes were in most cases saved from attack by being \"taken into the earth\" (\"be-häk seporde sode ast\")12 or \"swallowed by \" In a Muslim context hagg is of course reserved for the pilgrimage to Makka.

Although Muslim shrines are documented for a much longer span of time than Zoroastrian ones, the data on the actual practices at those places from before the 12th century is almost absent.15 Therefore, the greater historical depth of Muslim shrine cult, always taken for granted, is partly a reprojection of modern practice onto the preserved medieval structures. The comparison of Muslim and Zoroastrian shrines in Iran brings to light a common Iranian shrine culture. The fact that there are no Indo-Zoroastrian (Pârsï) shrines adds to the argument that dar In mahall mazär-e Bîbî Morâd yek-î az darbâreyân-e Sâh Yazdegerd bude ast va ba'z-î moctaqed-and ke hvâhar-e Sâh-e Harât dar In-gâ be-hâk seporde sode ast.

This context encompasses the general 'folk-religious' and devotional practices which are shared by Muslim as well as Zoroastrian Iranians.16 Moreover, terminology, administration, and architectural structures of Muslim and Zoroastrian shrines in Iran show significant parallels. At the same time some ideological concepts and the theological framework of both religious contexts are diametrically opposed. This is especially true if we look at the central Muslim idea of a saintly tomb which is not pre-sent in Zoroastrian shrines: up to the 20th century Iranian Zoroastrians did not have graves but exposed the corpses of their deceased to the sun and weather in special architectural structures which were called dahme.n Hence it is justified to speak of an Iranian shrine cult, which shows specific differences along the lines of the various religious tradi-tions involved.18 Apart from a few exceptions, Zoroastrian shrines are neither men-tioned in common handbooks on the Zoroastrian religion written by Zo-roastrians themselves nor in standard monographs written by Western scholars. Known to a wider public is only the above mentioned famous Zoroastrian shrine Pïr-e Sabz North of Yazd. But in the Zoroastrian vil-lages around Yazd, the city of Yazd itself, in and around Kermän, and even in the modern Iranian capital Tehrän and other recent Zoroastrian city-communities of Iran (e. g. in Ahväz) one finds many Zoroastrian shrines ranging from pilgrimage centres with many buildings down to small shrines of a more private character consisting of only one light 16 See B. A. Donaldson, The Wild Rue: A Study of Muhammadan Magic and Folklore in Iran (London, 1938, repr. ed.: The Middle East Collection [11]; New York, 1973). 17 But even the daymen were connected to shrines ritually, as regular visits for com-memoration of the deceased at the daymen were combined with pilgrimage circuits to some of the greater shrines. The dead were commemorated there and at the dahme s as they are today at different shrines and at modem Zoroastrian cemeteries. See for Yazd M.M.J.

HISTORY OF RESEARCH It was not until 1956 that a first scholarly publication appeared which dealt—among other aspects of Zoroastrian language and culture—with shrines. The systematic research which lead to this Farhang-e Beh-dinân [.Zoroastrian Dictionary] was undertaken by the late ôamsïd Sorüs Sorüseyän—a renowned and much respected scholar of Zoroastrianism and a (Kermânï) Zartosti himself—in the first half of the 20th century. His dictionary has as an appendix a chapter entitled \"Zeyärat-gäh-hä va amkän-e motabarreke-e Zartosteyän-e Yazd-ö-Kermän [Pilgrimage Shrines and Holy Places of the Zoroastrians of Yazd and Kermän]\".19 This chapter consists of a list of Zoroastrian shrines in Iran with short descriptions, providing some historical as well as legendary background (the latter at least for the major shrines). As Sorüseyän was himself of Kermânï origin, this list is much more comprehensive for the Kermän area than it is for the province of Yazd. The first long-time field research among the Zoroastrians in Iran was conducted by the British Iranologist Mary Boyce in 1963-4. She was the first who gave a detailed description of the pilgrimages to the 'mountain shrines' around Yazd. The major part of her data was published in her book A Persian Stronghold of Zoroastrianism in 1977.20 But also in most of Mary Boyce's articles on Iran, published from the 1960s on-wards, one can find accounts of several smaller shrines.21 With a highly sympathetic attitude towards her 'object of research' she connects field records with her vast knowledge of Iranian history and philology. In that way Boyce sets recent folk religious practices in the context of classical Iranian studies (which sometimes—especially for the pirs—drives argu-19 Surûsiyan, Farhang-i Bih-dinan, pp. 204-212. 20 M.

Nevertheless, by combining recent ethnographic data with classical Iranian studies she brings those, until then mostly ignored lay peoples' practices to the attention of more conservative scholars and a wider public. This is to be seen as one of Mary Boyce's (many) achievements in the young field of studies on 'liv-22 ing Zoroastrianism'. In 1973, the American anthropologist Michael Max Jonathan Fischer completed his dissertation on Zoroastrian Iran. His intensive fieldwork conducted around 1970 among not only Zoroastrians but also Jews, Shi-ite Muslims, Christians and Bahä'i in Yazd contributed much to the re-search on Zoroastrian shrines and shrine worship.23 Because he gives a detailed outline of the religious, economical, social, etc., context ofthat multi-religious urban settlement based on first-hand data, his—un-fortunately unpublished—thesis can still serve as a kind of handbook for pre-revolutionary, 20th-century life in Yazd. Fischer's work as a cultural anthropologist is also an excellent addition to the historico-philologically oriented work done by Mary Boyce. Independently of the philological and anthropological research repre-sented by Mary Boyce and Michael Fischer respectively, German ar-chaeologists of the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut, Abteilung Tehe-ran took interest in the Zoroastrian shrines in the 1960s in order to gain comparative material for their archaeological data. For instance, Gerd Gropp published an article on some of the shrines at Yazd, Kermän, and Tehran in 1971.24 Gropp's work is of special importance because he gives ground plans of the shrines he visited, which were partly reprinted later on by Afsär (see below). These shrines were renovated and partly rebuilt in recent years. Therefore, those published ground plans are nowadays a historical source by themselves.25 22 For the most recent work in that field with an uncompromising emic approach see Ph.G. Kreyenbroek, Living Zoroastrianism: Urban Parsis Speak about Their Religion, in collaboration with S.N.

Gropp, \"Die rezenten Feuertempel der Zarathustrier (II)\", Archäologische Mit-teilungen aus Iran N F. 4, 1971, pp. 263-288, plates 51-55. Another German archae-ologist who investigated architectural structures at Zoroastrian shrines in Iran in order to gain data for long time comparisons is Dietrich Huff. This material is unpublished so far. For his work on funeral structures, see for instance D. Huff, \"Zum Problem zoro-astrischer Grabanlagen in Fars: I.

In 1967 the Zoroastrian priest and scholar Rasld Sahmardän published his book Parastes-gäh-e Zartosteyän [Zo-roastrian Places of Worship]26 which partly relies on the work of Sorüseyän but adds much material on the Yazd region, Tehran, and even other places such as Ahväz, where Zoroastrian shrines had been estab-lished. In 1969 ïrag Afsär, a scholar of the (architectural) monuments of Iran and editor of many historical texts, published the first volume of his work on the monuments of the Yazd region27 which was followed six years later by a second volume on the monuments of Yazd proper28 sup-plemented by a volume with pictures and indexes.29 This handbook in-cludes all the Zoroastrian shrines described by Sahmardän.

Some shrines I found without personnel at the time I visited them but even then the research assistants who were with me (all of them Zoroastrians) behaved according to their customs so that I can give a general impression and outline of contemporary ritual practice. In total I identified 104 shrines or shrine-like structures (of which I could visit 77): Besides five in Tehran city and province, and one in Ah-väz, most of them are found in the villages and mountains around Yazd and in that city itself (80), a lesser number in and around Kermän (17), and one in Bardsïr, a small town in the province of Kermän.

Consequently he inter-vened and finally succeeded in abolishing sacrifices of cattle. The reväyat, Mofïd, Manekji's reports as well as the early Western literature37 only mention some of the greater ('mountain') shrines. Smaller places of worship—especially those inside settlements—were not recorded at that time. This poor historical record makes it difficult to evaluate the origin and development ofZoroastrian shrine worship with-out slipping into speculation. If we take a look at the available sources from antiquity and the middle ages, we can not detect anything like Zoroastrian shrines.38 Nevertheless, we can observe an early 'religious geography' together with travels of in-dividuals, motivated by religion.39 'Religious' space was mainly land-marked by fire temples40 which may have been visited on some occasions (or maybe certain renowned living priests were visited rather than the fires themselves).41 Such places of'fire worship', the cahär-täqs from Säsänian times, square shaped buildings with a round cupola on top, are considered as a starting point for Muslim shrine and even mosque architecture in Iran by scholars of archaeology and architectural history.42 The parallels of modem Zoroastrian pïrs to Muslim shrine structures and practices may to some extent reflect common pre-Islamic roots (e. g. in the case of the above mentioned cahär-täq). Also in this perspective Zoroastrian shrines can be placed in the context of Iranian or Middle Eastern religious history. An interesting development which apparently took place in the sec-ond half of the 20th century could be recorded during my survey. Where-as e. g. Gamsïd Sorüs Sorüseyän often states that shrines are used by 37 For Pïr-e Sabz and Pïr-e Bânû-Pârs see R.G.

Pîr-e Hväge-Hezr, Maryam-äbäd, Yazd). This process was obviously reinforced by the legal system of the \"Islamic Re-public of Iran\" defining its subjects by their religious denomination, al-though this development may have started even earlier during the Pah-lavi era. An exception is—again—Pîr-e Sabz together with a handful of other Zoroastrian shrines, which are visited as tourist attractions by non-Zoroastrians from Iran and from abroad. I could observe only one shrine which is still visited and cared for openly by Zoroastrians and Muslims together: Pïr-e Bâbâ-Sarafoddïn in Mobärake (Taft, Yazd province). The central room of this shrine is decorated with symbols of both religions side by side. ACTIVITIES AT ZOROASTRIAN SHRINES Different religious activities ('rituals') are conducted by the believers at the shrines. These 'rituals' are embedded either in the context of indi-vidual visits to a shrine or in larger ceremonies with more than one per-son taking part. Both cases—the individual and the group visit to a shrine-—are called zeyärat. Regular group pilgrimages which require travelling over greater distances are also called hagg by some Zoroastri-ans, especially in the usage of the village Sarif-äbäd (near Ardakän-e Yazd).In addition to these pilgrimages, believers also meet at certain shrines in their neighbourhood or in other city quarters on occasion of religious holidays or commemoration ceremonies for deceased relatives. This spectrum of occasions for individual or group devotion corre-sponds to a range of types of shrines serving different socio-religious func-tions. In most cases no priests are involved, and if they are, they do not take part in their specific priestly function. Only commemoration rituals, and sometimes gain-rituals at larger shrines, are conducted by priests."},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"INDIVIDUAL DEVOTION As I observed during my fieldwork, individual devotion can be carried out at any shrine, private or public. The 'rituals' performed by believers include prayer, lighting of candles, oil lamps, or incense sticks, lighting of temporary fires, and touching the 'object of devotion'. In most cases this is an altar-like structure in the middle of the shrine, sometimes also an old water winch for irrigation which is preserved in the shrine build-ing. Mainly at the 'mountain shrines' outside settlements (see above), there are natural sources of water or caves, which are visited and where prayers can be spoken. Often there are trees (plane or cypress) at the shrines. Wish-ribbons—sometimes even elaborated, decorative textile structures like garlands—are tied up to such trees. In the case of the most prominent shrines, the five 'mountain shrines' around Yazd, the central 'object of devotion' is a solid rock inside the shrine building. With the exception of Pïr-e Herist, the 'mountain shrines' all have 'holy' trees as well as water sources. Their waters are collected in a pool, which at most of the shrines dries out in summer, when there is no sufficient flow of water from the well. The lighting of candles, oil lamps, incense sticks or fires is not carried out at every visit. Even prayer can be optional. However, I observed the touching of the shrine's 'altar' in almost every case. While entering the shrine, the pïr is called upon by his name, e. g. \"yä Pïr-e Moräd (Oh, Pïr of the Wish)!\". This is also done when leaving the building after the 'al-tar' has been touched. At shrines which are more popular and offer more space to the believ-ers some other actions can be performed in addition to these basic acts of devotion. First of all, this can be the donation of money, which is an im-portant means of funding. Money is left on the 'altar', unless there is a special box for donations. Besides money, candles, bottles of oil for the lamps, and incense sticks are left at the shrine as donations. Some visitors leave fresh or dried fruits (ägll), sweats, as well as roasted nuts and chickpeas (nohüd) at the shrine. Chick peas and dried fruits (e. g. raisins) are often left on the 'altar' in connection with the moskel-gosä ritual.43 This ritual of the 'problem solver', which is the literal meaning of moskel-gosä, is performed either at home or directly at the shrine. It is arranged by a woman who wants to solve an urgent per-sonal problem. During the ritual women sort and clean roasted chick 43 See Boyce, A Persian Stronghold ofZoroastrianism, pp. 59-61, 66, 247."},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"peas on a tablet and a legend is told.44 Then, the cleaned chick peas are given to the accompanying persons or brought to a shrine. When they are given directly to other persons—an act which is said to increase the effi-cacy of the ritual—the person giving them says \"yä moskel-gosä (Oh problem solver)!\" and the answer is \"moskel-e hame-rä bo-gosä (Solve all problems!)\". If there is no shrine in the vicinity, the remaining chick peas can also be brought to a fire temple. Other visitors of the shrine or temple can take and eat from them in order to contribute to the 'problem solution'.45 Rituals like the nohüd-e moskel-gosä usually comprise a vow (nazr, nozür) that something special is done if the problem is solved or the wish (moräd) fulfilled. This can include a zeyärat to a shrine. If the wish is fulfilled, donations, which are called nozürät, referring to the vow (nazr, nozür), will be given to the shrine, or even greater donations to a pir are endowed as a charitable foundation by the believer. This kind of founda-tion is a general socio-religious practice conducted in connection with shrines. It is called 'foundation for the soul', säd-ravänl,46 literally 'gladdening the soul (of a deceased relative)'.47 It is also called vaqf, analogous to the corresponding Muslim institution.48 The founded money can be used for repairs, renovation or enlargement of a shrine 44 For the legend see G. Pîsdâdï, Hätirät-i 365 rûz yä pära-'ι az sunnat-hä-yi Zartusti-yän dar sada-i gudasta [Memories of365 Days, or a Selection of the Customs of the Zoroastrians in the Last Century} (s.l., 1374 hs [1995]), pp. 200-212. 45 This ritual is also known to the Pârsî of Nav-Sârï in Gugarät (India); see J.R.

COLLECTIVE DEVOTION The distribution of food at a shrine is an occasion for a collective festivity. This food is financed by charitable foundations ([vaqf-e] heyräti) endowed for the welfare of the souls (säd-ravänt) of deceased parents, grandparents or other relatives. It is cooked in big cauldrons on open fire, or nowadays over gas burners, and is referred to as äs-e hey rät ('soup of charity').49 This kind of festivity has great importance in the collective religious prac-tice of Iranian Zoroastrians, especially since Zoroastrianism does not have an institutionalised collective gathering which could be compared to the Muslim Friday prayer or the Christian mass. Dates for the arrangement of an äs-e heyrät can be fixed in different ways. Sometimes these gatherings take place at days of remembrance for the shrine, e. g. on the day dedicated to the Zoroastrian 'deity' (ïzed) con-nected with the shrine. (The shrine is not always named after that ïzed.)50 Once a year, when the month and the day of the respective ïzed coincide,51 they may take the form of large communal festivities (e. g. at Pïr-e Moräd near Qäsem-äbäd, Yazd). This calendrical occasion is called vaqt-e vaqt, literally 'time of [all] time[s]'. Another possibility is to give the äs-e heyrät on the actual date, when the deceased person, whose soul shall be bene-fited by the charitable foundation, is commemorated once a year (sal). When there is no äs-e heyrät, at least the typical oil-fried bread, called sïrog, is prepared whenever a greater group of people gathers at a shrine. Also the sir-ö-sedäb is still prepared at communal gatherings.52 For sïr-49 M. Boyce, \"Äs: iii. Among Zoroastrians\", Encyclopaedia Iranica, vol. 2,1987, pp. 693b-694a, here p. 694a. 50 E.g.

This, like the above mentioned chick peas from the ritual of nohüd-e moskel-gosä, is left behind at the shrine for ritual consumption by later visitors. Shrines where food preparation and gatherings are conducted usually are provided with a kitchen (äs-paz-häne), bread ovens (tanür), sanitary installations, courtyards or gardens, and sometimes even assem-bly halls (sälon). Larger pilgrimage centres can have more than one kitchen and other additional facilities (like water storages etc.), espe-cially if people use to stay there for several days and nights. PILGRIMAGES Besides the individual visits to smaller shrines and the communal gather-ings at medium sized shrines yearly mass pilgrimages take place to each of the six 'major shrines' in the region of Yazd. These events are called hagg or vaqt-e vaqt ('time of [all] time[s]') by the Zoroastrians. The most well known among these major shrines—even mentioned in most of the tourist guide books on Iran (there often referred to mistakenly as a \"temple\")—is Pîr-e Sabz(-e Cakcakü). All, with one exception (Pïr-e Setï-Pïr), lie in the mountains around the Yazd plain.53 Additionally, one new centre of pilgrimage emerged during the last decade at a small shrine in Bardsïr near Kermän (see below).54 During the vaqt-e vaqt—at least at Pïr-e Sabz—priests perform rituals (gasn) in the shrine-building. Lay people come into the shrine in order to pray. They gather around the /nr-building in pavilions, called heyles, in a picnic-like atmosphere for several days, while preparing food, eating, singing, dancing and having fun. Novices to the hagg of Pïr-e Sabz are initiated by a special ritual. They are shouldered by other pilgrims and symbolically beaten on their feet until they donate a fixed amount of sugar cones which are used to prepare sweets for the pilgrims.55 53 Boyce, A Persian Stronghold of Zoroastrianism, pp. 236-270. 54 The PTr of Bardsïr has not been mentioned in literature so far.

This ritual was filmed by the Yazdï"},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"» CLASSIFICATION OF ZOROASTRIAN SHRINES Zoroastrian shrines can be classified in several ways. A first possibility is to look at the protagonists of the legends connected with them. This method roughly results in two groups. First, there are shrines linked to legendary protagonists from the family and court of the last Säsänian king Yazdegerd III (Yazdegerd-e sevvom), who were fleeing the Arabo-Muslim invaders. Most of those shrines, connected to human, 'historical' protagonists, are located in the desert mountains around the city of Yazd.56 Up to the first half of the 20th century shrines of this group also existed in the vicinity of Kermän.57 It seems that these are no longer fre-quented by the Zoroastrians of Kermän, as they were either not known to my Kermânï informants or never visited by them. The shrines of the sec-ond group—the vast majority of pïrân—have as legendary protagonists angel-like, 'extra-human' beings who appear to the founders-to-be of the shrines in their dreams. Another possibility is to classify the shrines according to the names of the pïrs. This leads to one major group of shrines named after the differ-ent ïzedân (Zoroastrian 'deities' or 'angels'), like the many pïrs named after Säh-Varahräm-Ized or Mehr-Ized. Then we have a group of shrines named after the common Oriental mythological figure Hväge Hezr58 who film director Sohräb Yazdânî. The scene is included in his film on the pilgrimage to PTr-e Sabz in the year 1976 (when the newly built shrine-building was inaugurated), broad-casted by \"National Television of Iran\". 56 These are the five 'mountain shrines' (Pïr-e Nârakï, Pïr-e Bânû-Pârs, Pïr-e Herîst, Pïr-e Sabz, and Pïr-e Nârestâne). Three other shrines connected with Säsänians are located in the city of Yazd: Pïr-e Setï-Pïr, Pïr-e Borg (disappearing place of Fariborz, son of Yazdegerd III; see Sahmardän, Parastis-gäh-i Zartustiyän, p. 171), and Zeyärat-gäh-e Säh-zäde-Fäzel (\"madfan\", or \"funeral place\" [sic], of Ardasïr, son of Yazdegerd III; see Surüsiyän, Farhang-i Bih-dinän, p. 206; Sahmardän, Parastis-gäh-i Zartustiyän, p. 171). 57 These are Äb-e Moräd (or Mazär-e Bïbï-Morâd), Sahrestän-e Kermän (according to the legend, Bïbï-Morâd was either a 'lady in waiting' of Yazdegerd III, or a sister of the Säh-e Harät Sâh-Vïr, a governor of Yazdegerd III, maybe his son; see Surüsiyän, Farhang-i Bih-dinän, pp. 207-208) and Zeyärat-gäh-e Säh-e Harät, Sahrestän-e Kermän, the disap-pearing place of Säh-e Harät Säh-Vir (Surüsiyän, Farhang-i Bih-dinän, p. 211). 58 K.

Elyäs is normally seen as a twin of or another name for Hezr.61 One argument for the prominence of that kind of names is that it served as a disguise vis-à-vis the Muslim majority, because such a shrine could not be recognised as being exclu-sively Zoroastrian.62 However, there is a larger probability of these 'Muslim-named' shrines to be taken over by the Muslim population, which was for example recently the case with one Hväge-Hezr-shrine near Yazd. The Zoroastrian population had left the village of Mahmüd-äbäd (Merz-äbäd), the Muslims took over the shrine and consequently no Zoroastrians came there for a visit anymore. Hezr and Elyäs are most often associated by Zoroastrians with the 'angel' Sorus, and some of the Elyâs-pïrs are explicitly named Pïr-e Sorûs-ïzed by Zoroastrians. Another group of shrine-names refers to an important function of a pïr: to make a wish come true. Those are called Pïr-e Moräd, Pïr-e Man-zel-e Moräd (moräd is Arabic for 'wish' ; manzel-e moräd means 'house of the wish'), or Pïr-e Matlab (matlab is Arabic for 'wish' or more ex-actly 'place of wishing').

Here the pïr is named after a historical person who is commemorated at this place. The most prominent example is Pïr-e Ostäd Master Hodä-bahs in the Zoroastrian Mahalle of Yazd. Master Hodä-bahs was a re-form-minded teacher who was killed in 1917 because of his liberal atti-tude.63 This shrine is often visited by pupils and students before exams because Hodä-bahs was a teacher. Another example is Pïr-e Bahgôlï also in the Mahalle. According to the story, which is remembered by the Zo-roastrians in the neighbourhood, Bahgül was a girl who was kidnapped by a Muslim. This meant forced conversion and forced marriage. She was raped by her 'husband' and committed suicide.

In the following section I will describe my classification with the help of typical examples. PRIVATE 'SHRINES' This group comprises shrines or 'proto-shrines' which are localised in the private area or on the border of private to public space. If we take a look at the spatial structures for religious practice in the private area, i. e. inside residential buildings, we first of all find arrangements—mainly in living rooms—which could be called 'domestic altars' (plates XIII/2). Those areas in private houses where portraits of Zoroaster, commemora-tion photographs of deceased family members, Fravahr-emblems, and decorative elements (like vases, plastic flowers etc.) are put on display are not referred to as pïr or 'altar'. But in their function of personal commemoration places they show a nucleus which may develop into a commemoration shrine (therefore: 'proto-shrine'). Moreover, the ritual practice performed in front of them could take place in the precinct of a larger shrine in the same manner. These include the laying down of fresh or dried fruits, nuts, sweets, and cypress twigs on festive occasions as well as, in connection with that, conducting commemoration rituals for the deceased. These 'domestic altars' are found in most Zoroastrian homes and houses in Iran. A second structure, which is only found in some residential houses and more seldom in flats, are special rooms in which ritual meetings are held, referred to as sofres, where food is served and legends are told.64 Just as the 'domestic altars', these sofre-rooms are not referred to as pïr. But they serve the same function as some shrines where sofre s are exe-cuted regularly, and separate rooms are reserved there for that purpose. Some larger shrines are specific sofre-pïrs, gaining their fame primarily from particular sofre s which are conducted there exclusively. A famous example is the vahme-rü-shrines (the shrines of 'Bahman-rüz', dedicated to the day and 'deity' Bahman). In residential buildings sometimes rooms are reserved for the pari ('fairies') of the house and a sofre, dedi-cated to their queen (Dohtar-Säh-Pari), is conducted there. These pari-64 On the so/re-rituals see the paper by S. Kalinock in this volume."},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"rooms may contain some requisites like portraits of Zoroaster, vessels for incense, fire and candles, electric candles etc. (plates XIII/6). These rooms are also used for the commemoration of deceased family mem-bers, most likely those who instituted the sofre performed there, and dur-ing the Nov-rûz-festival plastic vessels with water and a coin as well as sabzi (tablets with fresh wheat sprigs) are put there, just as they are put in the central Ivän of the house, the pesgam-e mas.65 A room for the Sâh-Pari-sofre, as shown in plates XIII/6, is normally a secret, hidden room. This chamber is accessible through a small, inconspicuous door from the main yard. Usually it is situated on one side of the pesgam-e mas and has a connection with the central water supplies of the house.66 Other sofre-arrangements may be found in traditional kitchens where an electric can-dle marks the place of the sofre. On the border between private and public space we find different forms of light niches which are generally referred to as plrün (colloquial for pirân).61 Those are found in the walls of lanes and buildings in Zoro-astrian city quarters or villages, mostly on one or both sides or opposite entrance doors, sometimes also in courtyards and 'private' lanes between two or three residential buildings (plates XV/15). Light niches were found in the lanes generally before the invention of public electric light-ing. But some of them survived till today when they were (and are) cared for by individuals or families. In most cases their dedication to special persons (deceased or living family members) or 'deities' is only known to the families who take care of 'their' plrün. But sometimes they gain a local popularity, are supplied with additional brickwork, small glass 65 For pictures of traditional courtyard houses in Yazd, Kermän and Bäfq (Yazd prov-ince) see Rainer, Anonymes Bauen im Iran, picture section. Detailed descriptions and considerations on how to date the architectural structures are given by M. Boyce, \"The Zoroastrian Houses of Yazd\", Iran and Islam, in Memory of the Late Vladimir Minor-sky, ed. C.E. Bosworth (Edinburgh, 1971), pp. 125-147. For the pesgam (here \"pes-kem\") as the religious centre of the house and its role as a \"connection between the liv-ing and the dead\" see P.

The Pïr-e Hodä-parast in the so called Mübedän (= \"priests\") part of the Zoroastrian quarter of Yazd (Mahalle-e Zartosteyän), shown in plates XIII/4, was built by a person living nearby in front of an older light niche in a nowadays private lane in be-tween three residential buildings. Some persons claim that the main pur-pose to care for and venerate this pïr is to keep the passing open and ac-cessible for the families living nearby, as one house is empty and there could arise some interest of a potential new owner to include the lane in a new building. If a light niche inside a courtyard is getting venerated as a pïr, sooner or later the whole building can be referred to as a pïr. The beginning of such a conversion of an abandoned residential building with a light niche in its courtyard into a 'public' building by referring to it as a pïr was observed by the author in the Zoroastrian quarter of Yazd. In most cases private shrines and comparable structures function as places of commemoration. They structure and demarcate the private space by means of 'religious' symbols. The religious practice involves only members of one family or of the nearer neighbourhood, who also look after, take care for and finance the structure. LOCAL SHRINES Shrines of local relevance are found inside, on the edge and outside of Zoroastrian settlements, i. e. villages, or villages that became city sub-urbs in the second half of the 20lh century. Inside settlements one can distinguish between free standing structures, buildings integrated into lane facades and complex buildings with more than one room. In this context 'proto-shrines', i. e. nuclei for shrines with architec-tural structures, are big solitary cypress (sarv) or plane (cenâr) trees which are venerated in Iran not only by Zoroastrians.69 These trees form 68 An example of an elaborated pîrûn in Zeyn-äbäd (Yazd province) which is dedi-cated to Sàh-Bahrâm-ïzed is given in F.

Mistree (Ahmedabad/Middletown, 2002), pp. 300-323, here p. 316, picture 20. 69 Muslims often connect trees with legends of saints, descendants of the Prophet Mohammad or of the Emäms (Emäm-zäde).

They are"},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"a characteristic feature of some Zoroastrian villages South of Yazd, e. g. Cam, Zeyn-äbäd, or Mobärake. In some cases around Yazd, small soli-tary buildings which only consist of a brick structure with a light niche were built under a cypress tree, e. g. in the village of Zeyn-äbäd South-west of Yazd (plates XVI/16). Some cypress shrines are connected to a fire temple, as in the case of the famous Sarv-e Cam in the village Cam near Zeyn-äbäd. Another type of local shrines inside settlements consists of solitary buildings with one small room and one entrance door, where only one or two persons find place to light temporary fires, incense or candles. This is the case with Pïr-e Na-mïr in the village Mazrace-e Kaläntar North of Yazd (plates XIII/7). In this case the shrine is not connected to a tree but to a qanät, an underground water stream which supplies water from the mountains to houses and fields. Another type of this group of shrines is characterised by single room buildings—either built explicitly as a pïr or converted from a room of a residential building—which are accessible from the lane, while their fa-cade is integrated into the adjacent house facades or walls. A typical ex-ample is Pïr-e Mirzä-Sorüs, also situated in the village Mazrace-e Kalän-tar (plates XIII/3). This polygonal single room structure was apparently built explicitly as a shrine. An example of a room from a residential building that was converted into a pïr is the above mentioned Pïr-e Bahgôlï. Both shrines are named after individuals who are remembered by the people living in their neighbourhoods, the murdered girl Bahgül who is commemorated here and the founder of the shrine Mïrzâ Sorüs respectively. A typical example of a local shrine that became so famous and impor-tant locally that more and more rooms (kitchen, storage etc.) and a court-yard were added, is the Shrine of the reformist teacher (Ostäd, some-times also referred to as Mo^allem) and Bombay educated (Mäster) Hodä-bahs from Nersï-âbâd-e Yazd (the village of Nasr-äbäd, today a called Muràd dahanda, or 'desire giving' trees. Perhaps at one time a holy man, or a descendant of the Prophet, sat under such a tree, or ate of its fruit or used its leaves for healing, or in its shade he may have prayed or slept or dreamed. Sooner or later either he himself or some simple villager was ready to regard it as holy and thus it came to be venerated. It is called the 'desire giving' because the credulous, the afflicted and the needy, who have heard the story about it, tie rags and strings to its branches, and at the same time they make a request and take a vow that they will perform some meritious act if the request is granted.\""},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"North-Western suburb of Yazd) (plates XV/14 and XV/13: these pic-tures show the typical 'pillar altar'70 with fire vase and incense burner. Also a commemorative photograph of one lady who was in charge for the shrine71 until her death is on display as can be seen in plates XIII/8). Master Hodä-bahs was murdered in 1917 in connection with an intra-communal religious-political struggle on the very spot in the Zoroastrian quarter of Yazd where some years later his commemoration-/?îr was erected. This shrine—as well as the above mentioned types of local pïrs—was founded on private initiative. Smaller local shrines are usually financed by single persons or families, but are used as places of venera-tion by members of the whole population of a quarter or village. The administration is rather informal. Bigger structures like Pïr-e Mäster need formal approval by the local community council (angoman) and are co-financed by irregular donations or even regular foundations by wealthier members of the community. Another group of local shrines comprises those structures which were originally located on the border between a settlement and its irrigated gardens or fields. Nowadays they are situated within modem settlements because fields or gardens surrounding the shrines were partly or totally converted into building plots during the last decades. These local shrines on the edge of (pre-modem) settlements are typical 'agricultural shrines' and often a water winch (carh-e cäh), which was the nucleus of the shrine, is still found inside the buildings. Probably the general veneration of, or rituals in connection with water were the starting point of some of those shrines. These structures for irrigation are no longer in use because the old qanavät fell dry after the invention of deep water wells and dis-tribution of water via pipes since the second half of the 20th century. Therefore, these shrines are the only places where old irrigation devices have been preserved until today (plates XV/14). The old water winch with oil lamps and bottles with lamp oil shown in plates XV/14 is part of a Pïr-e Hväge-Hezr.

'Agricultural shrines' are often named after Hväge Hezr who is commonly associated with 'green' or cultivation (which is the original Arabic meaning of Hezr, Arabic 'Hadir') and water, i. e. cultivation of land by irrigation.72 Pïr-e Bläs-ger in Hasan-äbäd-e Mosïr (nowadays part of Maryam-äbäd-e Yazd) is an-other example for this type of shrine. In plates XIII/5, it can be seen that these shrines typically preserve a piece of garden land. If they become famous and are endowed with donations and regular foundations, they are extended with additional buildings or rooms, such as kitchens, sani-tary installations, and storage rooms. Many local shrines are found outside settlements in the middle of the irrigated agricultural land surrounding the village. Sometimes they are connected to a field water storage (äb-anbär) whose stairway and wind towers (bäd-glr) are shown in plates XIII/9 (the entrance to Pïr-e Matlab is the door left to the âb-anbàr''s stairway). Often, they are simple mud-brick buildings with only one or two small rooms, e. g. the Pïr-e Matlab (\"the shrine of the wishing place\") shown here. Sometimes they were rebuilt in baked brick as bigger structures with two or even more rooms. Minor structures in the fields that were built or became venerated as a pïr were used as a shelter for field guardians. Bigger shrines in the fields serve—like those inside settlements—for communal gatherings and are maintained by private donations and / or regular foundations. They are sometimes placed under the administration of the respective village angoman. TRANS-LOCAL SHRINES Some local shrines gained trans-local quality in that respect that they are visited not only by the population of one particular settlement but by lar-ger groups from different villages or city quarters. This happens on the occasion of communal meals which are founded by a private person in order to commemorate deceased relatives (äs-e heyrät). A typical exam-72 See e.g. A.

Many people gather there nine days after Nov-rüz (March 29/30). Pïr-e Moräd seems to have developed out of a small 'agricultural shrine' located in the fields of Qäsem-äbäd. This old shrine once was connected with water storage. Its staircase still can be seen next to the entrance to the shrine-yard. That the old /?7r-building was quite small is still reflected in the small main chamber with a 'pillar altar', shown in plates XV/12, which is supposed to be the original shrine. It seems that the \"shrine of the wish\"—which is the translation of \"Pïr-e Moräd\"—was not at all popu-lar in the first half of the 20th century, since it is listed by neither Sorüseyän nor Sahmardän. It even was partly destroyed and cut off of its water supply when the Yazd-Kermän railway was built just behind the shrine in the middle of the 20th century. At the same time or shortly be-fore its qanät run dry, maybe because of the railway construction works. It is noteworthy that many Zoroastrian shrines in Iran were either thoroughly enhanced or even reinvented to some extent from the 1970s onwards, as for example an inscription at Pïr-e Moräd of Qäsem-äbäd shows. Interestingly, this process of enhancement and (re-)invention sig-nificantly increased after the 'Islamic Revolution', and the process is still going on: e. g. Pïr-e Moräd was provided with a solid-built assembly hall in the year 2000. This was financed by a wealthy member of the com-munity now living abroad. REGIONAL SHRINES AND PILGRIMAGE CENTRES Nowadays the group of regional shrines consists mainly of the greater pilgrimage centres in and around Yazd. Probably until the middle of the 20th century this kind of 'mountain shrines' also existed around the city of Kermän, but due to the migration of the complete Zoroastrian rural population of the province of Kermän into the larger cities, those Ker-mânï 'mountain shrines' lost their popularity. Today, even the location of some of these former zeyärat-gähs is unknown to the average Ker-mânï Zoroastrian. In and around Yazd, in modem times a group of six plrs which Zoroastrians refer to as their 'great shrines' (pïr-e bozorg) developed into an almost canonical set of six shrines and some smaller places which are visited at regular pilgrimages. These pilgrimages are usually made in several sets of 'pilgrimage circuits'.73 This group of regional"},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"several sets of 'pilgrimage circuits'.73 This group of regional shrines in-cludes the shrine of Setï-Pïr near Maryam-äbäd in Yazd which lies in the plain and not in the mountains. The other five are located in the moun-tainous areas surrounding the Yazd! plain ('mountain shrines'). These are (from the South in clockwise motion) Pïr-e Nârakï, Pïr-e Bänü-Pärs, Pïr-e Herist, Pïr-e Sabz, and Pïr-e Närestäne. Pïr-e Sabz developed into an international Zoroastrian pilgrimage centre (see below). A picture of Pïr-e Nârakï is presented as an example of one of the less prominent 'mountain shrines' (plates XIV/11). It is the only one of the five pïr-e boz.org whose formation legend has a son of Yazdegerd III as protago-nist. The other five 'great shrines' are connected with female members of the court of Yazdegerd III, either with his daughters, his wife, or her female servant. The 'mountain shrines' have the appearance of little mountain vil-lages consisting of numerous buildings, most of them shelters for the pilgrims (heyle). As many inscriptions show, these structures were erected from the end of the 19th century onwards, with an increase in building activity after World War II and especially after the 'Islamic Revolution'. The canon of the six 'great pïrs' developed into a promi-nent feature of Iranian Zoroastrian identity. Sets of pictures of these shrines are common in the recent Zoroastrian iconography in Iran, e. g. most 'official' Zoroastrian pocket or wall calendars include pictures of these shrines. This does not mean that they are regularly visited by the whole community but they form a kind of virtual pilgrimage repertoire. All of the 'great shrines' are administered by local Zoroastrian commu-nity councils (angoman) from different Zoroastrian villages and city quarters and are officially recognised as Zoroastrian places of worship by the \"Islamic Republic of Iran\", although none of them is yet registered as a monument of 'cultural heritage' by the \"Sämän-e Mïrâs-e farhangï-e Kesvar (Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran)\". Attempts in that direc-tion have been undertaken by Zoroastrian individuals but with no result so far. The 'great shrines' are financed by several private foundations which are approved and administered by the angoman in charge of the respective pïr. 73 M.M.J.

Recently, however, in the province of Kermän a pilgrimage centre developed which is visited also by many Zoroastri-ans from Yazd, mainly women. So it is justified to classify it as a trans-regional pilgrimage centre. This shrine is located in the small town of Bardsïr (Masïz), Southwest of Kermän (plates XII/1: Pïr-e Bardsïr). The shrine of Bardsïr developed out of a sofre (ritual communal meal) which was instituted after an apparition of the 'fairy queen' (Dohtar-Sâh-Parï). It is not absolutely clear when the sofre was 'spread' for the first time, but by the age of the woman in charge of the sofre (hädeme) it can be guessed that it must have been around 1980. In the course of the last decade it developed into a trans-regional pilgrimage place. The shrine is located inside a modem farm house belonging to a Zoroastrian family. It is a small room, decorated with gifts brought by pilgrims. The free standing chamber is surrounded by assembly halls which were built by the family as the popularity of the sofre increased and more and more pilgrims were visiting the shrine for the zeyärat in the month of Ordï-behest (=21. April - 21. May). At this date the house is full of visitors for several days and in the night when the first apparition occurred they visit the sofre-chamber one by one. As at other Zoroastrian pilgrimages, the main activities during the pilgrimage days are singing and dancing as well as the preparation and communal eating of äs. The shrine is popular especially amongst women because the lady who instituted the sofre was healed from epilepsy which had caused her many miscarriages. Pïr-e Bardsïr is administered by the family living in the house where the pïr is located and it is financed by pilgrims' donations. It is not 'officially' recognised by any Zoroastrian angoman or priest. Its popularity and power to mobilise numerous adherents even seemed so dangerous to the Angoman of Kermän and the local 'Council of Priests' that they tried to prohibit the pilgrimage in the 1990s. But it could not be prevented, even though the interfering institutions called in the local police. THE INTERNATIONAL ZOROASTRIAN PILGRIMAGE CENTRE AND ITS VIRTUAL RAMIFICATIONS As mentioned before, Pïr-e Sabz, the famous 'mountain shrine' North of Yazd, developed into an international Zoroastrian pilgrimage centre (plates XIV/10). It is by far the most popular Zoroastrian shrine. This"},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"popularity not only results in crowds of tourists from both inside and outside Iran visiting the shrine on holidays and in the travel season, but also to a yearly mass pilgrimage of Zoroastrians, coming from every-where in Iran (especially Tehrän) as well as from the different diaspora communities all over the world. Even Indian Zoroastrians now visit Pîr-e Sabz together with other Iranian shrines while on their round trip through the 'homeland of Zoroastrianism',74 although they do not come especially on occasion of the vaqt-e vaqt in summer. Then, from 15th to 18th of June, several thousand people gather there and stay over night. This is a common feature of pilgrimages to the 'great shrineS' during the 20th century but it is in Pïr-e Sabz where this custom is still observed widely whereas the other shrines are nowadays most of the time only visited during the day while people return home with their car during the night. The popularity of the pilgrimage to Pïr-e Sabz resulted into two phe-nomena which are worth mentioning in the context of classification and typology of Zoroastrian shrines. On the one hand, a 'virtual reality' exis-tence of the \"Green Shrine\" developed in the time of the World Wide Web. The shrine can be found on display on several (Zoroastrian and Iranian) homepages and can be classified in this context as a kind of'vir-tual shrine'.75 On the other hand, the Zoroastrian community of Vancou-ver invented a sort of 'substitute pilgrimage'. Once a year, at the date of the hagg to Pïr-e Sabz, they gather at a particular place in the mountains near Vancouver, and there prepare and consume food, dance and sing, just as if they were at the 'real' shrine.76 CONCLUSIONS Today, Zoroastrian shrines serve as a means to create specific identities. On a regional level a specific Zoroastrian identity is enhanced in contrast to the Muslim majority population.

This is especially important in the context of mixed Zoroastrian communities in the dias-pora all over the world, where Zoroastrians of Indian as well as Iranian origin live together. At least at a folkloristie level, this identity enhancing function of the pïrs even applies to those members of the community (mostly intellectu-als and priests or both in the same person) who do not believe in the be-neficent effectiveness of pïrs and sometimes do not recognise them as a part of their religion at all or at least reject them as 'superstition' in other contexts. But even modemist priests who uttered such views to me felt obliged to pay reverence to the pïrs while visiting them together with me, either out of habit or because of social pressure when other Zoroas-trians were present. There is a wide range of Zoroastrian 'holy places' in Iran which were seldom—if ever—seen as an important part of Zartosti religious life in previous research. Despite modemist points of view the veneration of these shrines is well alive. Although some old shrines disappeared or are not used anymore, we can also observe the restoration and reinvention of older pïrs as well as the emergence of new ones in our time. For the Zoroastrian community the shrines form important landmarks for a mental mapping of space and time. They are an integral part of daily religious life and of Zartosti identity in Iran and even in the dias-pora communities all over the world where especially Pïr-e Sabz and the pilgrimage to it are commemorated supported by pictures, and commu-nal gatherings which are held during the time of the pilgrimage."},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE OF ZOROASTRIAN FUNERARY PRACTICES Dietrich Huff The Zoroastrian funerary practice of exposure of the dead was one of the most peculiar cultural habits of the ancient Iranians in the eyes of their western neighbours, who could not appreciate its reason: to prevent pol-lution of the sacred elements of earth, fire, and water by decomposing bodies of the believers in Ahura Mazda. The practice was already men-tioned by Herodotus1 and subsequently reported in a sometimes misun-derstood and even defamatory manner by antique western authors.2 It is practiced by Parsi communities in India until today.3 Although never fully accomplished it was obviously a rather strict rule in the Sasanian Empire, to the distress of the then considerable Christian minorities in Iran, who often suffered desecration of their earth burials.4 Probably during that period the Videvdat was codified, which con-tains, among other subjects, the precise regulations for the exposure.5 Two steps are clearly distinguished: the first—exposure on a dry, high and deserted place where the perishable parts of the body are quickly devoured by vultures and wild dogs—is compulsatory.

There is no religious preference. With the vast majority of the population certainly being poor, we cannot expect the development of rich burial ensembles or sumptuous funerary architecture. More remark-able is the fact that the archaeological monuments which may attest ex-posure or at least Zoroastrian tendencies in funeral practice are more or less limited to the western Iranian plateau, with a clear focus on the Per-sepolis-Naqsh-i Rustam area. There are sub-centres, e.g. in southern Fars, Elymaïs and Kurdistan, but there is utmost scanty evidence in east-ern Iran.6 The great variety of doubtlessly Zoroastrian pottery ossuaries in Central Asia7 proves that, beside other funerary customs, exposure was practiced also there, but with a tradition of its own, the ossuaries perhaps deriving from cremation urns. No clear evidence for comparable pottery ossuaries is known from Iran proper,8 where only some stone os-suaries were found at the Gulf coast near Bushir.9 Of relevance for the early development of exposure of the dead may be the interesting fact that the rich burial culture of inhumation stops short with the end of Bronze Age civilization in large areas of Central Asia, the supposed homeland of the Iranians, where subsequently Iron Age burials are nearly completely lacking.10 6 A Sasanian bone burial was found in a tower chamber of an abandoned Parthian mud brick fort in Shahr-i Qumis.

Great numbers of low platforms,\" only some centimetres high, were chiselled from the bedrock with a surrounding strip of evenly smoothened rock, producing locations similar to the pavis in the recent towers of silence, on which the bodies of the dead are laid out12 (plates IX/16). They indeed look like places of exposure, although they deserve further discussion. Together with these are oblong troughs of similar dimensions cut into the bedrock with varying depth.

They were used or reused still in Parthian and early Sasanian time. As they always were built high up on barren, rocky ground, they might have been re-garded as fulfilling the Zoroastrian purity prescriptions. A similar way of burial, called sang-chin, heap of stones, was practiced in 19,h century Iran by small Zoroastrian com-munities, which could not afford a dakhma. The corpses were carried up to a remote, barren place in the mountains, \"piled around with stones and covered with a slab\" (W. Jackson, Persia Past and Present (New York/London, 1906), pp. 393 f.). The same method was chosen in a more recent accident.

CHAMBER-04A://M4S FROM EARLY ISLAMIC UNTIL ACHAEMENIAN TIME Undoubted Zoroastrian bone receptacles are rather small caverns and niches, carved into the cliffs around the Marvdasht plain, especially abundant near Naqsh-i Rustam and Istakhr.14 Too small for containing more than a skull and some bones, they often have Pahlavi inscriptions with rather uniform content, saying that this dakhma 'was made by ..., for..., and paradise be the reward for the soul'.15 Dakhma, nowadays the word for the Zoroastrian tower of silence, was obviously a word for the tomb in the widest sense of the meaning; every attempt to limit its inter-pretation to one special type of burial seems obsolete. It is used in all known inscriptions in the Marvdasht area, here as an equivalent for the more precise term for a bone receptacle, astodan, which occurs in other regions.16 For palaeographic reasons and especially from some dates in the inscriptions it becomes clear that the small cavem-dakhmas belong to the late Sasanian and even early Islamic period. Small grooves and ledges at the openings of these small dakhmas in-dicate that they all were closed by slabs of stone (fig. 1).

Instead the tombs very probably belong into the period between the downfall of the Achaemenid and the establishment of the Sasanian Empire, when, under the decentralized Seleucid and Par-thian rule, petty kings and local dynasts, while strictly adhering to their Iranian nationalism and religion, freely made use of modern western in-99 fluence on decorative achievements of their monuments. Some of the „Median\" rock tombs have rather small burial cists which perhaps can be taken as evidence for bone burials after exposure, e.g. those at Fakhrika23 (fig. 4), Kur-u Kich and Qizqapan.24 The most archaic and probably ear-liest of the group however, that at Sakhna, with tomb chambers at two levels, similar to some Urartian tombs, has huge, sarcophagus-like troughs in the upper chamber, like the royal Achaemenid rock tombs, which obviously both were designed for intact bodies. However, already Herzfeld has pointed out that the sarcophagi at Sakhna unlike those of the royal Achaemenian tombs seem never to have been covered by lids, perhaps in order to give access to vultures. One may add that the single trough, which fills the lower chamber at Sakhna is largely oversized and disproportionate for the burial of a single person, as important as he may have been. Therefore at least this trough might have been used as a col-lective ossuary of cleaned bones.

There can be no doubt, that the royal Achaemenian rock tombs were the ancestors of all rock tombs in Iran, from the so-called Median ones to the smallest dakhma niches in Fars (fig. 2 and plates VIII/14). Whereas these latest niches were certainly ossuaries, the interpretation of the ear-lier ones remains doubtful, and the royal Achaemenian tombs can be scarcely regarded as anything else than veritable sepulchres for complete bodies. Exposure, however, must have existed already in Achaemenid Iran, because Herodotus, a contemporary, describes the practice so pre-cisely that it could not have been invented.28 His report seems to be re-markably authentic, as he stresses the secrecy with which the Persians obviously surrounded the practice towards foreigners, and as he does not conceal that his information was vague to some extend. Although claim-ing first that exposure was the general burial practice of the Persians, he afterwards restricts this only to the Magi, obviously the priests, but per-haps also a tribe of Medes, and in the end he somewhat desperately adds that the Persians cover the body with wax, before they bury it in the earth. It seems doubtful whether his last remark can be taken literally, but very clearly had he understood that the earth had to be protected from dead and decomposing matter. The royal Achaemenian tombs seem to have fulfilled this prescription by their position on or in stone, high above the humid fertile soil of the living. 27 D.

These are rock troughs of differing size and making, cut into the slopes and cliffs of the mountains of Fars, especially at Kuh-i Rahmat.29 The obviously older type has great similarity with the rock-cut sarcophagi in the royal rock tombs and may therefore be dated in the Achaemenid or early post-Achaeminid period (plates VII/5). Straight and precisely cut they are deep and long enough for a stretched out body and are sur-rounded by a carefully smoothened, sunk down or at least flat rim as im-post of a massive lid, which is preserved only in few cases. They are of-ten interpreted as exposure troughs, and they may have served as such in primary or secondary use, but as the lids show, they were covered like coffins, at least in their original destination. Many of them, however, are still covered with rough, natural boulders, perhaps from a later, secon-dary use. All these big, coffin-like troughs as well as the later, smaller ones have drains around their rim for leading off surface water, and many of the older type are placed under overhanging rock or in grottos, probably also for protection from rain. At a not precisely definable time, but at least in the Sasanian period, an inconspicuous but decisive technical innovation was introduced. In addition to the sunk down or levelled impost rim a small, elevated ridge was left standing out from the rock around the edge of the trough proper. Its purpose was clearly twofold: an additional protection against intrud-ing surface water and to provide a safe, undisplaceable seat for an over-lapping lid.30 Troughs with ridge differ widely in size and quality of workmanship (fig. 5). Some are of body-size, up to 1.80 m long. To them belong the above mentioned so-called exposure pits in Bishapur. As for the low pavi-like 'exposure platforms' in Bishapur, their sur-rounding levelled strip of bedrock seems to have been specially prepared 2q Huff, \"Zum Problem zoroastriseher Grabanlagen in Fars I. Gräber\", pp. 164 ff.; Boucharlat, \"Pratiques funéraires à l'époque sasanide dans le sud de l'Iran\", p. 75. 30 There is a parallel development in Iranian pottery types, where vessels with Y-shaped rim and overlapping, conical or convex lids appear in Sasanian time. - The very properly carved so-called fire altars on the acropolis of Limyra at the south coast of Asia Minor seem to belong to the same type of trough-dakhmas.

The vast majority however is very small, ca. 0.50 m; medium sized ones measure between 0.80 and 1.30 m. They often are crudely carved with irregular, rounded edges, and espe-cially the small ones widen towards the bottom, to gain interior volume. The best known and most important example of a trough-dakhma with ridges is the so-called Houz-i Dukhtar-i Gabr at Eqlid with its long but damaged and confusing inscription, which carries a date correspond-ing to 638 A.D., briefly before the fall of the Sasanian Empire32 (plates VIII/12). The problem for the interpretation of this well cut, medium sized (ca. 1.30 m) but rather shallow (ca. 0.30 m) monument is the oc-currence of the term dakhma twice and in different contexts of the in-scription. Like in the inscriptions of cavern- and niche-dakhmas the trough at first is called a dakhma, which was ordered to be made by a high official, a margrave of Bishapur, for another person, \"the dear son of...\" The text continues with the date of the death and gives the follow-ing day as the date for placing the body at the dakhma, in any case the exposure site. Consequently a discussion arose, whether the monument was the place for exposure, or an ossuary, or the container for a metal coffin. For a realistic understanding we have to consider that this dak-hma was not prepared by a person for himself in advance as his own fu-ture sepulchre, but by one person for somebody else, who, as the inscrip-tion insinuated, died all at a sudden. This would exclude an interpreta-tion of the monument as an exposure site, because its preparation must have taken quite a long time; it never could have been finished from the day of death until exposure, which had to follow as soon as possible, that means from one day to the other. The same consideration also rules out the idea of a double function, at first exposure site and later preserving the cleaned bones by closing the lid. In addition, the situation of the tomb at the foot of a rocky outcrop, very close to fertile soil and running water, is scarcely in accordance with the prescription for an exposure site, but was frequently chosen for astodans. All this, together with the ridge, indicating a vanished lid, speaks clearly in favour of a bone recep-32 G. Gropp, \"Einige neuentdeckte Inschriften aus sasanidischer Zeit\", W.

Taking into account a double mean-ing of the term dakhma—exposure site as well as astodan—offers the most probable solution for overcoming the dilema. The so-called sarcophagus of Dorudzan was, at the time of its discov-ery during road construction, the sole completely preserved monument of this type33 (fig. 6). Fig. 6. Dorudzan.

The different parts of this monument are dispersed now, the lid smashed to pieces, exemplary for the fate of all the other lids of trough-dakhmas. Contrary to the larger troughs, which are generally regarded as tombs of some kind, the very small ones were interpreted as fire bowls or sec-ondary fire altars. In fact, however their original purpose as ossuaries is proven beyond doubt by three of the four well known and repeatedly published dakhma inscriptions of Istakhr/Takht-i Ta'us34 (plates VI/3 and VII/8). With their texts precisely following the phraseology of the inscriptions at niche- or c&\\em-dakhmas the tablets are chiselled in a vertical cliff of Kuh-i Rahmat, immediately under a step back of the bed-rock. On the horizontal surface of the step back three troughs are cut into the bedrock, each directly above one of the inscriptions; beyond any doubt the troughs are the mentioned dakhmas. With elevated ridges, wa-ter drains and with similar dimensions they are perfectly corresponding with the other pseudo fire bowls.35 The trough above the tablet of poor-est quality, obviously the latest one, is very shallow and perhaps unfin-ished.

Evidence that both, and other, still to be mentioned types were constructed at least up to the 9th cent. A.D. can be derived from remarks in the Dadistan-i Dinik, a book of religious opinions and rules, composed by the high priest of Fars and Kirman, Manuchihir, probably shortly before 881 A.D. Concerning the preservation of bones after exposure,37 he first summa-rizes the passages of the Videvdat, and then recommends as more au-thoritative a \"vault of solid stone\" which should be covered or closed also by a \"single stone\"; this ought to have a hole (to let sunlight in) and should be fixed with \"stone and mortar\". The text obviously cannot be understood and translated in a sufficiently clear and precise way, espe-cially the term nihumbag, which must mean the closing slab of stone or the lid, defying any unambiguous definition.38 Regarding his differing recommendation, Manuchihir seems to have been somewhat disproving of the prescription of the Videvdat, which originally seems to mean a built up, free standing construction. His recommendation could be ap-plied to both types, the cavern- and the \\xoug\\v-dakhmas. However, re-garding technical details as well as the aspect of security for the dakhmas, which certainly had turned precarious after the Islamic con-quest, when Zoroastrians became a tolerated, but clearly inferior caste of the society and exposure was abhorrent for the ruling Muslim class, the cavern- and niche-dakhmas might have been the preferred type at that time. They could be placed high enough in the cliffs to be out of reach for unequipped vandalizing hooligans, whereas the trough-dakhmas, as well as separately built constructions, could be easily desecrated and de-stroyed. Moreover, a hole in the 'cover' of a xock-dakhma is more likely in the stone slab which closed the niche or cavern, than in the lid of the troughs, where it could let in rain water; and mortar and (small) stones are essential for fixing a vertical stone slab, but not for a fitting lid. 37 Dadistan-i Dinik, by Manuskihar, transi.

They are also determining the interpretation of the small but well-known and famous group of the so-called rock-cut fire altars, with the twin monuments at Naqsh-i Rustam as their most prominent representatives (plates VIII/9). It were in fact these rock 'altars' which instigated the interpretation of the 'fire bowls' as inferior altars, because the troughs or 'bowls' of both have identical dimensions, shapes and details: a ridge around the open-ing and a widening interior towards the bottom. The Naqsh-i Rustam twin monuments laid the ground for the definition as altars, although already in 1897 Ferdinand Justi wrote that \"the usual assumption that the Naqsh-i Rustam monuments were fire altars can not be sustained, be-cause a sacred fire can burn only in a dark room\".39 According to the ritual prescriptions the sun must not shine on a consecrated fire, because its super power would abash the fire; and for similar reasons two sacred fires should never burn side by side40; for incense burners or non-consecrated fires the pair seems rather too luxurious. On the other hand the monuments fit in well as reliquary-like shrines for the remainders of e.g. a couple; we had seen that niche- and cavern-dakhmas very fre-quently were arranged in pairs and always slightly different in size, cer-tainly as tombs of closely related persons, differing in rank. This also is true for the Naqsh-i Rustam twin monuments, with the left one being markedly smaller than the right one. Like the niche-dakhmas and in some cases also the sarcophagus-like trough-dakhmas, the Naqsh-i Rustam twin monument clearly imitates contemporary Sasanian architec-ture, with columns, arches, pinnacles and—restored—with cupola-shaped lids (fig. 7).

A well-known specimen of columnar monuments, and the only one still in situ, is that on the western spur of Hussein Kuh, above the relief of Ardashir I.46 (plates XII/27). It stands fixed in a perfectly fitting circu-lar hollow in the rocky ground. Dozens of similar hollows prove that the Naqsh-i Rustam column was not unique (plates VII/5). The hollows, er-roneously interpreted as fire bowls too, must not be mixed up with the trough-dakhmas. Unlike those they are distinguished by a smaller size, lack of a ridge, a mostly precise circular, rarely square outline and a cy-lindrical, vertical interior, not widening towards the bottom. Some of them are not just cut into the natural bedrock but in the surface of rock-cut sculptures, which also are regarded as 'fire bowls'. In fact these do not only look like column bases, but they are bases47 (plates VIII/10). Contrary to western classical technique, plugging stone columns was normal use in post-Achaemenid Iranian architecture. The occurrence of columnar monuments or their footings mostly together with dakhmas, and especially frequent in the vast sepulchral area on Hussein Kuh, indi-cates that they also belonged into a funerary context (plates VI/4). Al-though we cannot exclude, that they too carried bone receptacles, like the much more massive shaft of the Pengan monument, there is no proof of that possibility; the plain, horizontal top of the Naqsh-i Rustam col-umn at least does not show any traces of bonding like the Qanat-i Bagh shaft does. There however, a rather crude technique was chosen, and the Naqsh-i Rustam columns and other ones might have been plugged with their upper end into a precisely fitting, cylindrical hollow in the bottom 46 K.

Another explanation than support of a bone receptacle may be insinu-ated by the Middle-Persian inscription on the reused Achaemenian col-umn from Bagh-i Lardi, now in Persepolis, which obviously had been reworked to be bonded with another block of stone. The inscription de-plores the death of the poor, miserable Farrukhzad and seems to refer to solemn meals, but according to the translations, without mentioning the term dakhma,48 It seems therefore, that this column was a memorial monument for somebody who had not got an astodan, and if this proves correct, this would imply that there was a tradition of funeral monuments without a tomb. The Naqsh-i Rustam column does not have a memorial inscription. However, in Pasargadae four assumed 'fire bowls' were ob-served in the vicinity of a flat outcrop of rock with some badly eroded Pahlavi inscriptions, two with clearly funerary character. One of them obviously begins with the usual \"this dakhma\", another promises para-dise as reward. One of the hollows is described as a typical footing hol-low of a column, with vertical side wall and flat bottom. Another one, the deepest, seems to have a surrounding ridge and to widen downwards, according to the published photograph; this could be a round trough-dakhma 49 Although there is no proof for the correlation of the inscrip-tions and the hollows, which are clearly the surviving traces of funeral monuments, there is the possibility, that any kind of funerary inscription might have been engraved in the bedrock nearby instead on the monu-ment itself. There were other free-standing dakhmas, and keeping in mind the prescription of the Videvdat, which clearly speaks of a built, not rock-cut construction, they seem to have been the prevailing type, at least in Sa-sanian time. That they vanished with few exceptions and only the rock-cut dakhmas survived is easily understandable, regarding their extremely endangered situation under Islamic rule, a situation which may have been the background for Manuchihir's recommendation in his Dadistan-i Dinik.

Whether this rather weak remake of the original can still be dated in the Achaemenid period seems very doubtful for stylistic and technical reasons. The disproportion of the low, three-stepped substructure and the comparatively big tomb-house may be a result of the character of the building, now as a mere bone receptacle, of which no pollution was ex-pected. The low, squad door, wider than high, corresponds with the door proportions of the later type of post-Achaemenian rock tombs like Issak-vand / Deh-i Now and Akhur-i Rustam. The walls are not built of layers of freestones, but composed of comparatively thin but large slabs and the roof is a sophisticated, unweighty construction of a barrel-shaped cover, like a lid, hidden between horizontal and sloping slabs and two gabled front parts. Highly developed building techniques like that are untypical for Achaemenid architecture.

Highly intriguing is its possible relation to the tower of Paikuli, although the long inscription ofNarse there does not mention a funeral purpose.57 To sum up, we come to the conclusion, that there was a surprisingly great variety of funerary monuments in pre-Islamic Iran, which can be re-garded as Zoroastrian or Mazdayasnian, all starting with the Achaemenids and continuing, at least partly, into early Islamic time.58 Beside the two well represented types of rock-cut zbamber-dakhmas and trough-dakhmas there were different kinds of free-standing tombs, of which the type of the major so-called rock altars essentially were nothing but specially elaborate txoug)\\-dakhmas. There is no firm archaeological evidence for a wide-spread practice of exposure of the dead in Achaemenian time, although it must have existed according to Herodotus, and the comparative scarcity of Achae-menid earth burials on the inner Iranian plateau may be taken as an evi-dence 'ex silentio'. It seems that the Zoroastrian rules of purity were alter-natively followed by at least keeping away the dead body from humid and fertile soil. Exposure may have been a funerary practice, but not for every-body, similarly as it is practiced by some Buddhist societies until today. It seems that exposure gained ground during the Parthian period, ac-cording to western reports as well as to rock chamber-tombs, which can be regarded as astodans, and it became more or less obligatory under the Sasanians. With the 'exposure platforms' at Bishapur we have perhaps the only archaeological evidence for exposure itself, and from the Sa-sanian period comes the overwhelming majority of different types of bone receptacles. It obviously was the rock-cut dakhmas, which mainly survived the Arab conquest, but also some free-standing dakhmas must have been built in early Islamic time. ernment or Rules for Kings, transi. H.

No description of the building is given, except for the enigmatic specification bi du pushish \"with two envelopes\". The term astodan, if it was chosen intentionally by the author, would define the structure as a bone receptacle; but the term seems to have been a synonym for grave, like dakhma, an indication that Zoroastrian bone re-ceptacles were omnipresent in early Islamic Iran. The later popular name of this 'sutudan', \"The General's Look-out\", as well as the information, that this 'tower' could only be entered by ladders, proves that it was rather high with no entrance at ground level. All this perfectly fits in with a structure like the early Sasanian tower of Nurabad. However, from the fact that its platform was used as the daily meeting place for a group of 30 to 40 people, it can be concluded that it also was rather spa-cious. Therefore it could have served for exposure as well. If we insinu-ate that \"with two envelopes\" means two-storied (in its upper part), we might reconstruct a tower with a massive lower part, a roof-platform for exposure and with vaulted room or rooms in between for preserving the clean bones; of course this remains a purely hypothetical solution. Nevertheless, the astodan of Ray may perhaps have been some kind of predecessor of the modern so-called towers of silence, which serve for exposure and storage of the cleaned bones alike. There is, however, no evidence that a combined type of dakhma already existed in pre-Islamic time, when there was no need for this combination. The towers of si-lence are thought to have evolved in Iran during the early Islamic centu-ries and the design to have been taken over by the Indian Parsis.60 Enlarged and enriched by a central well or shaft for the cleaned bones the structure found its final and canonical form in the impressive, circu-lar type of buildings which even today is called dakhma by the indige-nous people in India and Iran, and tower of silence by Westerners61 (fig. 59 Nizam-al Mulk, The Book of Government or Rules for Kings, p. 167. 60 M.

This type was introduced or re-introduced from India to the surviv-ing Zoroastrian communities in Iran, Yazd, Kerman and, in a slightly different way at Teheran, in the second half of the 19th century by the Parsi agent Manekji Limji Hataria.62 It is remarkable that up to the be-ginning 20th century the remembrance was alive among Iranian Zoroas-trians, that the common and combined dakhma was a result of the Is-lamic conquest, and that originally, under Sasanian rule one person had his proper dakhma63; remembered were of course only the individual astodans of the rich.

According to European visitors67 they were quite well off at the beginning, but very quickly their situation deteriorated and soon they became so miserable that they could not even sustain a fire temple. It is an interesting question how this poor community got an elaborate stone dakhma 200 years before that type effectively spread in Iran under the patronage of Manekji Hataria. Ruins of abandoned round dakhmas are repeatedly mentioned, but they were not of stone, but mud brick buildings and none is described in detail or properly documented.68 According to archaeological evidence another type of dakhma69 had been popular in Iran proper with shrinking autonomy and increasing pressure of Islamic domination at least since Saljuq rule. The pauperized communities seem to have followed the original Videvdat prescription, adequate to their situation: leaving the bones on the exposure ground, i.e. the barren mountains which were at hand nearly everywhere on the Ira-nian plateau. Two of these vaouxùdàn-dakhmas at the Zoroastrian centres of Yazd and Kerman were in use up to the middle of the 19th century, 65 Kotwal, \"The Parsi Dakhma: its History and Consecration\", pp. 165, 168. 66 J.

At Kerman a conical ridge was chosen and surrounded by an irregular, curving wall71 (plates X/23). Some similarity with the old dakhma of Kerman has the long abandoned and badly ruined site of Takht-i Rustam (plates IX/20) on a rocky peak of the hill chain bordering the long and fertile plain between Teheran and Qazwin to the south. A mountain plateau with a trapeziform circumvallation further west, Takht-i Kaikaus, reminds us of the old movintàm-dakhma of Yazd.72 Both monuments are interpreted as so-called high places of the Zoroastrian cult of fire in archaeological publi-cations. However, especially the more conspicuous Takht-i Rustam is regarded as an old mountain dahkma by members of the Zoroastrian community of Teheran. Takht-i Rustam is a rather complex arrangement of ruins; in addition to tilted terrace walls, which encircled the peak in two tiers, there was an artificially built up, lozenge-shaped plateau at half height of the mountain, with a small, vaulted building nearby. SUBSIDIARY FUNERARY BUILDINGS The funerary site of a traditional Zoroastrian community, which gener-ally is called dadgah, does not consist of the dakhma or 'tower of si-lence' alone. With considerable regional differences the dakhma is ac-companied by more or less numerous auxiliary structures, which are needed for the procedure of exposure itself, for the annual cycle of ceremonies for the soul of the deceased, or just for private commemora-tion and mourning.

Most important is a small structure, or a room, generally integrated into the kheileh, where a lamp, a candle or a dadgah fire is kept burning at least during the three nights after death, for consolation and support of the soul of the deceased, which is thought to be lingering about at its places on earth during that time. The room is called atashsuz, or sagri (in India). It must have a window or opening towards the tower of si-lence, and the wall of the tower generally is perforated by a hole ca. 15 cm wide, lying in a straight line, so that the light—theoretically—can shine into the dakhma15 There must also be a small structure near the dakhma for the salars, who bring the deceased into the dakhma, which is inaccessible for everybody else. Larger dakhma complexes or dadgahs have a permanent guardian, the dakhmaban, who lives there with his family and cattle in a veritable farmer's house, closed to the outside, with inner court and all necessary facilities. If a permanent dadgah fire is kept burning in the atashsuz, it is looked after by the dakhmaban. The most impressive Zoroastrian cemetery or dadgah in contempo-rary Iran is doubtlessly that of the city of Yazd with its three successive dakhmas, the old mountain -dakhma, formerly known as Dakhma-i Jam-shid, which has vanished at the end of the 20'1' century, the tower of si-lence built by Manekji in 1864, and the Gulistan dakhma as the last one, which had been built next to the old mountain -dakhma again (plates X/ 24). The mountain-dakhma was divided into a northern, upper part, where the deceased bodies were laid down, and a southern, lower part, where the clean bones were brought to,76 it is not clear whether this was an original design.

It was only in the second half of the 19th century, when Zoroastrians had achieved a certain degree of freedom and security that, together with Manekji's dakhma, the ex-tensive complex of kheilehs developed along the northern hill foot on the side of the open plain.

There was an opening, facing the Manekji dakhma, in the long wall of the room which is destroyed now. The atashsuz maintained its function when the last dakhma was built. As this was situated in another direction, with a deviation of nearly 90°, the short wall of the room, looking towards the new dakhma was perforated by holes,77 later a small shelter was added to the outside of the atashsuz (plates IX/18), in front of the holes, and according to the remaining ashes, also here fire was lit occasionally. Both of the new towers of silence have the above men-tioned holes in their walls corresponding with the light openings of the atashsuz and the attached shelter. There is no proof for an atashsuz at the old mountain dakhma of Yazd and its kheilehs, because of their ruined condition. But there was plenty possibility for an adequate arrangement. Light could shine into the old dakhma from any room of the kheileh below the crest of the op-posite ridge, and the remainders of a small structure on the very summit of the crest might well have been an atashsuz proper (plates IX/21). At the other rather well preserved ancient mountain dakhma, that of Kerman, no evidence for a contemporary atashsuz is preserved; not even a contemporary kheileh did survive there. But the dakhma itself with its huge walls mostly standing up to the top is an extraordinarily impressive monument (plates X/23). The new tower of silence of the standard type was erected by Manekji in 1867 on the next mountain spur, some hun-dred meters off, and for this later on a rather modern kheileh was built with an elaborately vaulted kitchen and partly two-storied aiwans78 (fig. 77 An analogous development can be observed at the dadgah of Sharifabad, north of Yazd, where in the original atashsuz with its fire altar a hole was pierced through the wall in direction of the new tower of silence, built in 1961/63.

The atashsuz too was installed in this kheileh with an eight-cornered, domed room on the upper floor at that corner of the building which overlooks both dakhmas. It is not clear from the evidence in the ruined building, whether this atashsuz had a veritable dadgah fire, like those in the Yazd area;79 the crown of the cupola above has fallen down and covered the centre of the room with an amass of debris, which now might cover the altar.

Moreover, there is an oblique window, cutting diagonally through the corner wall of the atashsuz in the direction of the old moun-tain-dakhma, clearly showing the intention to shed light also into the an-cient exposure site. As parts of the old dakhma wall opposite the the atashsuz are destroyed we cannot ascertain whether a light opening had been pierced subsequently through the wall of the old mountain -dakhma as well. Immediately below the rocky spur with the new tower of silence, and clearly belonging to its funeral environment, is a small house consisting of an aiwan and one room with fire place and chimney (plates X/23). It is nearly identical with the building below the Takht-i Rustam near Te-heran80 and in both cases it probably served for the guardians of the dadgah or for the salars. An even simpler house with one room only stood below the other north Iranian presumable mountain dakhma, Takht-i Kaikaus. The greatest variety of subsidiary buildings at a dakhma in Iran is preserved at Cham, between Yazd and Taft, built by and for the sur-rounding villages. The tower of silence was built in front of a theatre-like scenery of mountains. An impressive, paved access way with flights of steps leads up to a platform where, in front of the door high up in the dakhma wall, a deep aiwan on a high substructure sheltered the mourn-ers when they said their last farewell to the deceased before the body was brought into the exposure place by the salars.S] Down in the valley sev-eral kheilehs and a large house for the dakhmaban surround a tiny gar-den with a well shaft and a structure, which was probably the earliest atashsuz (plates IX/22). This is a very small and narrow aiwan with lat-eral benches for max. 6 persons to sit in, and a semicircular shelter for a fire place, attached to the aiwan opposite the dakhma (plates XI/25). The shelter essentially is comparable to that in front of the atashsuz at the dadgah of Yazd. But, whereas there the shelter is a later addition to the room with a fire altar, in Cham the sequence of the buildings is vice versa, as we shall see. The fire place could be served with fuel from the aiwan and the fire could shine out through 5 windows. - A second atashsuz was built in the shape of a small round tower with a spiral stair-case on the slope just behind the kheilehs (plates IX/22). There was no space for a fire altar in the small domed room on top, but up here in the 80 Siroux, \"Takht-e Rustam et Takht-e Kaikaus\", p. 96, fig. 56. 81 P.

The purpose of the tower was confirmed by an inscription, calling the structure ja-i chiragh, place for the lamp, and giving a date in the early 1940's as time of construc-tion by a pious person.82 Of the three windows, only the largest one is directed straight towards the dakhma; the others give on to the plain with the villages. It seems that the tower was not only used as an atashsuz but also as a look-out, to watch approaching people, e.g. the processions of the mourners with the corpse. An atashsuz of the type, which was the oldest at Yazd, was to be built in Cham as the last one. It is a square, domed room which was at-tached to the house of the dakhmaban (plates IX/22), accessible through a low, hidden gate from the dakhmanban's kitchen, probably for secu-rity's reason. The room was nearly filled out by a massive fire altar of stone and clay, which, however, seems to have never been taken into use. Instead a slender pier was set against the back wall of the room, up to the spring of the dome, and above its horizontal top the vault is black-ened with soot, obviously form candles or oil lamps, which were kindled there instead of a fire (plates VII/6). Light could shine out towards the dakhma through an opening in the opposite side of the dome (plates IX/22). All three light-houses stand more or less in a line directed to the point where the obligatory aperture is left open in the wall of the dak-hma, several meters to the right from the dakhma gate. It is worthwhile to observe the great variety of architectural solutions for an atashsuz which were developed all for the same purpose: to let some kind of light shine into the dakhma during the nights after a fu-neral, and in addition at any night as often as possible. The importance of this ritual obligation is also shown by the fact that, as we have seen, even abandoned dakhmas were provided with light from the atashsuz. This is most impressively demonstrated at Sharifabad, north of Yazd. When a new tower of silence was built there, the old atashsuz continued to be used and, like in Yazd, an opening was pierced through its wall in direction of the new dakhma. At the same time the old abandoned dak-hma was surrounded by a second circular wall as a protection against desecration. Also this new outer dakhma wall was pierced by a hole ex-actly in line with the window of the atashsuz on the one side and the opening in the old inner dakhma wall on the other. 82 Kind information by letter of Prof. Mary Boyce from March 13, 2000."},{"pageNumber":639,"pageContent":"The tradition of the atashsuz is carried on in the most recent devel-opment of Zoroastrian cemeteries, the aramgahs which replaced the towers of silence when exposure ceased to be performed about the mid-dle of the 20th century. The aramgahs, where the dead now are buried underground, with different attempts of protecting the earth from pollu-tion,83 still have a room in their compounds of subsidiary buildings, from which light is shining out into the graveyard through a window during the three nights after the funeral.84 (plates XI/26) It is scarcely possible to trace back the history of the atashsuz into the remote past with help of archaeological evidence; however, there are some literary arguments. Chardin reports that about 50 paces distant from the Isfahan tower of silence there was a small mud brick building, from which, after the corpse had been brought into the tower, the priest allegedly observed through 'a hole', which eye of the deceased was hacked out first by vultures and crows; from this he allegedly could tell the waiting relatives whether the soul of the deceased would go to para-dise or hell85. Chardin himself was sceptical about this 'ridiculous super-stition', and gave more credit to another and reasonable information: that the house served for some kind of ceremonies for the dead before expo-sure. Whereas the eye-magic and similar soothsaying legends, wide-spread and persisting among all kind of non-Zoroastrian believers, was pure malicious invention, the 'hole in the wall' may be a realistic fact, because a reasonable, although false, argument for its existence was given: that the priest had to make his observation from outside the tower in order not to scare away the vultures. It seems probable, that the non-Zoroastrian population noticed a hole, which of course must have been in the dakhma wall, not in the small building, and not knowing its true purpose fell upon an explanation, which was in accord with their mis-chievous view of Zoroastrian religious practices. That Zorastrians were 83 In Teheran, where exposure was stopped already in 1937, iron coffins and lining the grave with cement is reported (Boyce, \"Corpse, Disposal of in Zoroastrianism\"). In Kerman and Yazd aramgahs (since 1939 and 1960) and dakhmas were used together up to the 1970s. In Yazd at present the corpse is wrapped with white bandages and, using much incense (sir va sedow), laid in a grave, the lower part of which is somewhat nar-rower than the upper, and is covered by concrete slabs, so that a rather solid subterra-neous chamber is established in the hard and dry clay-and- gravel ground. The upper part of the grave is filled in with the excavated material. 84 Boyce, \"Some Points of Traditional Observance and of Change among the Zoroas-trians of Kerman\", last paragraph. 85 Chardin, Voyages en Perse et autres Heia de I 'Orient IX, p. 51."},{"pageNumber":640,"pageContent":"very restraint in giving information about their religious practices, cer-tainly due to bad experiences, is stated by nearly all European travellers. Chardin's report thus leads to the conclusion, that the 17th century tower of silence in Isfahan had its auxiliary building for funerary ceremonies, including the function of an atashsuz, closely similar to the situation at a 19th-20th century dadgah. And that the tradition of dadgah fires goes further back is proven by the fact that they are mentioned already in the instructions which the Parsis of India received from Zoroastrian priests of Persia in the 14th century.86 The idea that light is beneficial for the soul of the dead is certainly to be seen in context with the imagination of the importance which was attributed to light in general and especially to the sun in Zoroastrian re-ligion. The seemingly casual remark in the Videvdat, that the bones of those who cannot afford an astodan should be laid down on the ground, \"clothed with the light of heaven, and beholding the sun\"87, in fact gives us the basic reason of the instruction in the Dadistan-i Dinik for those whose bones were brought into a bone receptacle: that in this astodan \"for the sake of light coming to it\" a hole is made therein, and that the 'covering' ofthe astodan \"is to construct of a single stone which is cut perforated\".88 The archaeological monuments can scarcely provide sufficient material to follow up in detail Zoroastrian funerary practices as we know them to-day back to the Achaemenian period. But they clearly give proof of the importance in general, which these ceremonies persistently maintained throughout the centuries. Striking evidence comes from the rather preten-tious buildings with differentiated ground plans which were excavated in front of the royal rock tombs above the terrace of Persepolis.89 We may presume that similar ancient kheilehs stood in front of the royal tombs at Naqsh-i Rustam, where they must have been destroyed by later occupa-tion.90 The plateau of Hussein Kuh above the royal tombs is covered with 86 M.R.

At Issakvand sherds of Parthian cinnamon ware under the rock tombs corroborate the suggested Parthian date of tombs and relief, and lead us to the probable seat of the tombs' owners, an archaeological site on a rock above the Gamasiab River nearby, with the same type of sherds, presumably the palatial complex of a local dynasty.92 The polished sur-faces of rock-cut shelves under the tombs stand out in contrast to the other roughly chiselled surfaces, and indicate that they were used for some kind of ritual performances within the funeral and commemorative ceremonies. The same goes for the before mentioned rock-cut 'mauso-leum' on Hussein Kuh, where the carefully flattened entrance stair and the floor of the small antechamber indicates, that only this area, not the main room, was prepared for the public, i.e. for frequent visitors and mourners, certainly in connection with funerary ceremonies of some kind. The abundance of pottery sherds at the ancient funerary places gives evidence that the tradition of common meals after a funeral and at the recurrent days of commemoration goes back to the early times of Ira-nian Zoroastrian history. It may even attest a widespread minor habit like the smashing of pitchers after the meal, which is reported for Iran in the recent past93, and which is indicated by the great quantities of glass sherds which litter the ground at the old kheilehs of the early mountain-dakhma of Yazd, probably the sherds of wine bottles. of Cyrus is beyond the opposite limits of the palatial area. 91 Kleiss, \"Beobachtungen in der Umgebung von Persepolis und Naqsh-i Rustam\", pp. 142 ff., fig. 13,20. 92 Huff, \"Sasanidische Architektur\", pp. 28 f. 93 Boyce, \"Corpse, Disposal of in Zoroastrianism\", p. 284."},{"pageNumber":642,"pageContent":"KONTINUITÄT UND WANDEL IN DEN RITUALEN DER IRANISCHEN ZARATHUSTRIER Katayun Mazdapour* Die Rituale der Zarathustrier in der Sasanidenzeit können anhand der alten zarathustrischen Texte rekonstruiert werden.

Die Beschreibung der heutigen Rituale der Zarathustrier Irans beruht dabei auf eigenen Erfahrungen und Augenzeugenberichten anderer.1 Jedes Ritual besteht einerseits aus unterschiedlichen Teilen und bildet andererseits eine übergreifende Einheit, die diese einzelnen Teile in Be-ziehung zueinander setzt und auf diese Weise einen Gesamtverband konstituiert. Als eine unabhängige Einheit übernimmt das Ritual sodann eine bestimmte Funktion in der Konstruktion gesellschaftlicher Kultur und nimmt einen bestimmten Platz im Leben des Einzelnen ein.

Auf den ersten Blick scheint es, als beruhten diese Veränderungen lediglich auf den geistigen Voraussetzungen und Interessen der Mitglie-der der Gesellschaft und der Ritualakteure. Bei näherem Hinsehen sind sie jedoch auch realen Bedingungen und äußeren Faktoren unterworfen. Die geistigen Voraussetzungen und Interessen der Individuen sowie die äußeren Rahmenbedingungen sind die Voraussetzung für Kontinuität oder Wandel von Ritualen.

HISTORISCHER RÜCKBLICK Die Rituale der zarathustrischen Gesellschaft stützten sich bis zum Ende der Sasanidenzeit auf die Protektion einer der mächtigsten Regierungen der Welt. Daher waren sie niemals Zweifel oder Kritik ausgesetzt, und die Autorität des Glaubens und der Rituale war aus Sicht der Anhänger der zarathustrischen Religion unumstößlich. Es ist anzunehmen, dass die Stimmen der Kritiker (wie z.B. der opponierenden Christen) weder das einfache Volk noch die religiösen Führer erreichten. Dieser Zustand än-derte sich jedoch mit dem Niedergang der Sasaniden, in dessen Folge die zarathustrischen Geistlichen und die alten Rituale in die Defensive ge-drängt wurden. Opfer gravierender Veränderungen wurden die alten Ri-tuale jedoch erst, nachdem die zarathustrische Gemeinde Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts mit westlicher Kultur und Moderne konfrontiert wurde. In der Schrift Nämagihä ι Manuscihr werden wir mit der Beschrei-bung eines Disputs zweier Priesterbrüder im 9. Jh. Zeugen eines Streites über die Veränderung religiöser Rituale. Im Verlauf der Auseinanderset-zung zwischen Manuscihr, dem geistlichen Führer der Provinzen Färs und Kermän, und seinem jüngeren Bruder Zädsparam wird letzterer aus der Gemeinschaft der Gläubigen ausgeschlossen und somit das Reini-gungsritual barasnüm vor Veränderungen bewahrt. Als über 1000 Jahre später die Priester (mubad), denen die Rolle der Bewahrer und Vollzie-her der alten offiziellen Rituale zukam, mit den neuen Formen, Werten und Annehmlichkeiten des modernen Lebens konfrontiert wurden, ver-mochten sie es nicht mehr, die alten Traditionen gegenüber den neuen Herausforderungen zu beschützen. In der Folge beugten sich die Rituale und Traditionen der Zarathustrier, die sich bis dahin kaum verändert hat-ten, dem Druck westlicher Vorstellungen und Kultur. Das in Nämagihä ï Manuscihr erwähnte Datum 250 Yazdegerdi (881 n. Chr.) muss als historisches Ende der religiösen Dispute im Anschluss an die Sasanidenzeit und als Beginn einer Phase der Konsolidierung za-rathustrischer Rituale und religiöser Vorstellungen nach der islamischen Eroberung verstanden werden. Seit dieser Zeit erschienen die religiösen Rituale in versteinerter Form und blieben von Veränderungsprozessen,"},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"die aus der Sasanidenzeit zum Beispiel in Schriften wie dem Zand-ifra-gard-i widewdäd überliefert sind, unberührt. Es waren die fünfziger Jahre des 20. Jahrhunderts, in denen die alten Traditionen dem Ansturm neuer, aus dem Westen kommender Einflüsse erlagen und sich mit großer Geschwindigkeit veränderten. In den darauf folgenden Jahren verstarb die alte Generation, die noch an die uneinge-schränkte Gültigkeit von Ritualen und religiösen Vorstellungen geglaubt hatte. Dieses grenzenlose Vertrauen gegenüber den alten Traditionen hatte seinen Nährboden in der Isolation und Weltfremdheit, die das Le-ben vieler Zarathustrier bis dahin bestimmt hatten. Nun übernahmen Generationen die Führung, die nicht nur die neuen (technischen) Errun-genschaften der westlichen Welt benutzten, sondern auch mit den Wer-ten und Ideen der Moderne vertraut und aus der Isolation der alten Welt herausgetreten waren. Damit war der alte Kreis durchbrochen: Sowohl die geistigen Vorraussetzungen und Vorstellungen als Fundament von Ritualen als auch die einzelnen ritualkonstitutiven Teile, ihr Platz und ihre Rolle in den Gedanken und dem Leben der Menschen hatten sich verändert. Seit den fünfziger Jahren des 20. Jahrhunderts ist die Zahl jener Za-rathustrier, die ausschließlich die alten Glaubensvorstellungen in bezug auf die Rituale kannten, stark zurückgegangen. Demgegenüber ist die Zahl derjenigen angestiegen, die nicht nur mit den Glaubensvorstellun-gen der meisten anderen, nicht-zarathustrischen Iraner und den Erschei-nungsformen der westlichen Kultur sowie deren Ausdrucksformen in Iran vertraut waren, sondern auch neue Einsichten in ihre Religion und ihre eigene kulturelle Vergangenheit gewonnen hatten. Sie lebten in mo-dernen wirtschaftlichen Verhältnissen und hatten keinen Bezug mehr zu den Ritualen und Glaubensvorstellungen der alten Welt. Die Sicht dieser neuen Generation auf die alten Rituale brachte ein neues Verhältnis ge-genüber den Traditionen zum Ausdruck und zerstörte schließlich die alte geistige Ordnung, die grundlegend für die Beständigkeit der Rituale ge-wesen war. Das neue Bewusstsein, mit dem die meisten muslimischen Iraner der zarathustrischen Gemeinde begegneten, und die Ideen aus der westlichen Welt, denen einige Zarathustrier neuerdings wieder be-sonders nahe stehen, hatten bedeutenden Einfluss auf die Einstellung der Zarathustrier zu ihren alten Ritualen. Die Auswanderung aus Yazd und Kerman in Städte wie Teheran war ein weiterer Faktor, der neue Bedingungen für die Durchführung von Ritualen schuf. Das Dorf, die vertraute Umgebung Kermans oder Yazds"},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"wurden ersetzt durch die Großstadt, in der die moderne, ungewohnte Architektur der Häuser die Lebensgewohnheiten veränderte und die mo-derne Ökonomie an die Stelle der bäuerlichen, kleinstädtischen Wirt-schaftsweise trat. Der neuen Umgebung wurden schließlich auch die Ri-tualgegenstände angepasst. Weitreichender war jedoch die Veränderung zwischenmenschlicher Beziehungen—ob innerhalb der zarathustrischen Gemeinde oder in Kontakt zu Nicht-Zarathustriern—, die wiederum Ein-fluss auf die Durchführung der Rituale hatte. In der Folge wurden die ritualkonstitutiven Teile, ihr Zusammenhang und ihre Funktionen neu definiert. Die Fähigkeit der einzelnen ritual-konstitutiven Elemente, den neuen Herausforderungen zu widerstehen oder sich anzupassen, ist individuell verschieden. Sie basiert auf den Ei-genschaften des Elements und seiner Position auf der individuellen und kollektiven Werteskala. Darüber hinaus ist sie abhängig von den anderen Elementen, die ihrerseits einen bestimmten Rang in der bewussten oder unbewussten Wertehierarchie der ritualpraktizierenden Gesellschaft und der Individuen einnehmen; daher ist sie fortwährend den jeweiligen Verhältnissen unterworfen. Natürlich spielt auch der Einfluss anderer gesellschaftlicher Gruppen, die mit der zarathustrischen Gemeinde in dominanter Weise in Bezie-hung stehen, eine bedeutende Rolle bei der Wertschätzung eines Rituals durch die Ritualakteure. EINE AUSWAHL ZARATHUSTRISCHER RITUALE VOR DEM HINTERGRUND VON WANDEL UND KONTINUITÄT In den neun Abschnitten dieses Beitrags wird eine Auswahl alter schrift-lich fixierter zarathustrischer Rituale vorgestellt und mit der heutigen Ritualpraxis in Iran verglichen. Auf diese Wiese sollen Kontinuitäten und Veränderungen aufgezeigt werden. 1. Die mubad und die offiziellen Rituale Die formale Durchführung der alten religiösen Rituale und das Wissen um die einzelnen ritualkonstitutiven Teile obliegen in der Praxis den Priestern {mubad). In Iran begegneten die mubad den sozialen Verände-rungen, die seit der Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts Einfluss auf das religiöse Leben der Zarathustrier in Iran gewannen, ohne Gegenwehr. Statt Neue-rungen und Veränderungen zu bekämpfen, wandten sich viele Priester einem neuen Erwerbszweig zu, so dass es schließlich zu einem Mangel"},{"pageNumber":646,"pageContent":"an mubad flir die Durchführung der Rituale kam. Entgegen der Tradition fanden daher zwischen 1981 und 1983 auch Personen aus Laienfamilien Zugang zu dem bis dahin den Söhnen der mubad vorbehaltenen Bereich. Unter dem Namen mubadyär (Priestergehilfe) fuhren sie heute zusam-men mit den mubad die offiziellen Rituale durch. Die Rolle, welche die mubad bei der rituellen Leitung der zarathustrischen Gemeinde inneha-ben, muss vor dem Hintergrund ihrer großen Autorität in der Vergan-genheit betrachtet werden, in der sie u.a. das Recht des Schiedsspruchs und der Festlegung des Strafmaßes von Verbrechen besaßen. Während früher die Oberpriester (mubad-e bozorg) sowie deren Stellvertreter zur Anfertigung religiöser Rechtsgutachten (fatwä) befugt waren, werden letztere heute von dem iranischen Priesterrat (kankäs-e mubadän) er-stellt, der in der Praxis identisch mit der Teheraner Priestervereinigung (kankäs-e/angoman-e mubadän-e tehrän) ist. a. Rituale im Inneren des Feuertempels Die von den mubad und mubadyär durchgeführten oder unter ihrer Auf-sicht zur Ausführung gelangenden Rituale wurden stark vereinfacht. Diese Simplifizierung hat sich auch auf den Vollzug von Ritualen über-tragen, die in den Feuertempeln oder ,Festhäusern' (gähambär-häne) ausgeführt werden. Diese Rituale werden entweder in sehr reduzierter Weise durchgeführt oder ganz ausgelassen. Während viele religiöse Ze-remonien, die sich der Aufsicht der Priester entziehen, wie der Besuch von Schreinen, das Ablegen von Gelübden oder das Ausrichten ritueller sofre, aufwendig gefeiert werden, werden die ,Festhäuser' und andere Stätten, die für die Durchführung des yasesn und des vendïdâd sowie anderer langer alter Rituale (niyäyes) bestimmt sind, vernachlässigt und stehen leer. b. Rituale außerhalb des Feuertempels Den größten Teil der heute noch praktizierten zarathustrischen Rituale bilden Rituale, die von den mubad und mubadyär außerhalb der Feuer-tempel durchgeführt werden. Dabei handelt es sich hauptsächlich um die gähämbär und die Todesrituale. Zu den offiziellen Todesritualen nach der Bestattung gehören das sewwom (der ältere Begriff dafür ist sed), das cahärom (der ältere kermaner Begriff dafür lautet cäromun), das dahe (idaha), siruze (siruza) und ruze (ruza). Das ruze wird nach dem Tod ein Jahr lang monatlich durchgeführt. Wenn sich das Datum des Todes jährt, findet das säl-Ritual statt, das 30 Jahre lang jedes Jahr begegangen wird."},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":"Dieses Ritual ist in Iran umfangreicher als in Indien und schließt eine Bewirtung der Gäste mit ein. Zu den Todesritualen zählen in der Praxis auch die gähämbär. Sie besitzen eine lange Tradition und werden nor-malerweise im Namen eines Verstorbenen durchgeführt. In Teheran e-xistieren für die Durchführung dieses Rituals Stiftungsgebäude wie der „Irag-Saal\", das „Kulturzentrum Märkär\", das „Haus Narges\" und die zahlreichen Versammlungsräume der Feuertempel. In allen von Za-rathustriern bewohnten Städten sind für diesen Zweck Örtlichkeiten ge-schaffen worden. c. Gasan-hwäni und gähambär-tugi Das gasan-hwäni fand bis in die fünfziger Jahre in den Privathäusern statt. Es wurde zu positiven, freudigen Anlässen wie dem Kauf oder Bau eines Hauses begangen und heiter und fröhlich zelebriert. In der Praxis war das gasan-hwäni eine Einladung mit Bewirtung, an der die Priester teilnahmen und das niyäyes gelesen wurde. Heutzutage wird das gasan-hwäni nur noch selten in seiner traditionellen Form gefeiert. In der Praxis findet zwar noch eine Bewirtung mit Gästen statt, auf das Lesen der niy-äyes und der Gebete verzichtet man allerdings. Gähämbär-Feiern und Varianten des gasan können heute auch an öf-fentlichen Orten und in Stiftungsgebäuden beobachtet werden. Daneben werden die Jahreszeiten(?)-£ö/iam&ä/- in Form (?) der tugi gelegentlich auch von Seiten der Organisation der Zarathustrier und anderen Grup-pen, bisweilen aber auch von Privatpersonen ausgerichtet. Das gäham-bär-e tugi kann jederzeit problemlos durchgeführt werden. d. Der Todestag Zarathustras Der Tag hur des Monats dey ist der Todestag Zarathustras. Die Rituale für dieses Ereignis wurden früher individuell in den Privathäusern aus-geführt. Lediglich Familien, in denen erst vor kurzem eine Person ver-storben war, begingen den Tag in offizieller Weise unter der Anwesen-heit von Priestern. Heute wird dieses Ereignis öffentlich und aufwändig unter der Teilnahme von mubad gefeiert. In Teheran findet diese Zere-monie auf dem Friedhof qasr-e firuze statt. e. Forudog Forudog oder farwardingän (im dari der Zarathustrier: prudog, im Dia-lekt der Stadt Yazd: forudog) ist heute der Name für den Tag farwardin des gleichnamigen Monats (der erste farwardin-Tag im Jahr bzw. der 19."},{"pageNumber":648,"pageContent":"Tag des Jahres). Der Name frawadigän oder frawardiyän ist in den Tex-ten überliefert und bedeutet ,den letzten Tag des Jahres befreien'. Es ist überliefert, dass die Seelen an den zehn Tagen des frawardiyän—aus dem Paradies oder aus der Hölle—auf die Erde zu ihren Häusern zu-rückkehren und am Tag ormazd des Monats farwardin (in der Morgen-dämmerung des Neujahrstages) zu ihrem Platz—in der Hölle oder dem Paradies—zurückkehren. Heutzutage ist diese Vorstellung nicht weiter entfaltet worden, es wird aber implizit angenommen, dass die Rückkehr der Seelen am Tag farwardin des Monats farwardin stattfindet. An die-sem Tag wird eine umfangreiche Zeremonie auf dem Friedhof qasr-e firuze in Tehran vollzogen. Vor den 1950er Jahren gab es eine derartige Zeremonie nicht. Als forudog bezeichnete man den Tzgfarwardin des Monats esfand, und die Rituale für diesen Tag fanden im privaten Kreis in den Häusern statt. f. Porse-ye hamegäni Früher versammelten sich die Zarathustrier am Tag ormazd des Monats tir und am Tag ormazd des Monats esfand in den Häusern, in denen sich ein Trauerfall ereignet hatte, um ihr Beileid zu bekunden. Heute findet an diesen beiden Tagen im Beisein von Priestern das porse-ye hamegäni statt. g. Yast-e rapatwan In der Vergangenheit versammelten sich die Zarathustrier an den ersten fünf Tagen des Sommerneujahrs zwischen 12 Uhr bis 15 Uhr mittags (entspricht der liturgischen Tageszeit rapatwan (mp. rapihwin)) in den gähambär-häne und widmeten sich in absoluter Ruhe und Ungestörtheit ihren Gebeten. Die Beachtung der totalen Ruhe, das Unterlassen jeder überflüssigen Bewegung sowie das Bestreben, unbedingt jeden Kontakt des nackten Fußes mit dem Fußboden zu vermeiden, gehörten zu den besonderen Verhaltensweisen bei der Durchführung des jast-e rapatwan. Am Ende der Zeremonie wurde eine spezielle Speise mit dem Namen loqme-ye rapatwan, die aus einem speziellen Brot und einem Stück Obst bestand, an die Anwesenden verteilt. Gleichfalls wurde die Pflanze houm gepresst und mit Milch zu einem Getränk vermischt, von dem je-der Anwesende eine Flasche für seine Angehörigen mit nach Hause nahm. Heute führen nur noch die Priester in den Feuertempeln dieses alte niyäyes durch. Den Laien ist dieses Ritual nicht mehr geläufig."},{"pageNumber":649,"pageContent":"2. Todesrituale Die Abschaffung der Leichenaussetzung im dahme (der zarathustrische Ausdruck dafür ist dädgäh), war die einschneidendste Veränderung, die sich bei den zarathustrischen Ritualen in Iran ergeben hat. Zuerst wurde 1937 in Teheran der Friedhof qasr-e firuze gegründet, dann entstanden entsprechende Begräbnisstätten in Kerman (1939) und in Yazd (1957). Das von Manekji (1813-1890) in Teheran errichtete dahme musste sei-nen Betrieb aufgeben, so dass bis zum Bau des Friedhofs qasr-e firuze durch Arbäb Keyhosrow Sähroh in Teheran die Bestattung der Leichen auf dem privaten Grundbesitz der Zarathustrier stattfand. a. Das sagdid-Ritual Um die Leichendämonin (diw-e nasus) aus dem Körper des Verstorbe-nen zu vertreiben, wurde beim sagi#c/-Ritual ein Hund an den Leichnam zur Beschau herangeführt. Da man durch Erfahrung wusste, dass Hunde Tote von Lebenden unterscheiden können, wurde hier die natürliche Sinneswahrnehmung des Hundes für die Feststellung des Todes genutzt. Das sagdid-R\\lua\\ wurde offiziell noch bis 1950 in Yazd durchgeführt -in einigen Dörfern der Umgebung mag es inoffiziell allerdings auch heu-te noch praktiziert werden. Grundsätzlich ist es jedoch außer Gebrauch gekommen. Bereits vor den fünfziger Jahren des 20. Jahrhunderts hatte sich das sagüW-Ritual insofern verändert, als anstelle der Leichenbe-schau durch den Hund oder ein ihm ähnliches Tier ein Stück Brot auf die Brust des Verstorbenen gelegt und das Wegnehmen des Brotes durch den Hund als Beweis für den Tod des Menschen gedeutet wurde. b. Leichentransport und -wäsche Das Ritual, den Leichnam (zum Bestattungsplatz) zu tragen hatte sich— verglichen mit der in den alten Schriften überlieferten Ritualpraxis— bereits vor den 1950er Jahren verändert. Seitdem hat das Ritual noch-mals wesentliche Veränderungsprozesse durchlaufen, die vor allem durch den Transport des Leichnams mit dem Leichenwagen bedingt waren. Bei der Leichenwäsche finden heute auch Wein und Rosenwasser Verwendung. Das Waschen des Leichnams ist der Beruf einiger Perso-nen, die heute nicht mehr als besonders unrein gelten. Gelegentlich über-nehmen auch Verwandte des Verstorbenen die Leichenwäsche."},{"pageNumber":650,"pageContent":"c. Die niyayes und die nichtoffiziellen Todesrituale Die Rituale (niyäyes'), die in den ersten drei Tagen nach Eintreten des Todes im Namen der Gottheit sorus für den Verstorbenen vollzogen werden, werden heute in den Familien sehr unterschiedlich vollzogen. Insbesondere diepatit-Gebete (mp. petit, Reue- und Gnadengebete) sind weit verbreitet. Ab dem späten Nachmittag des dritten Todestages ge-winnen die Rituale einen offiziellen Charakter und werden unter Teil-nahme eines Priesters durchgeführt. Am ersten, zweiten und dritten Todestag wird die persönliche Habe des Verstorbenen gereinigt und unter den Anwesenden aufgeteilt. Die Schulden des Toten werden beglichen und wenn jemand zu Lebzeiten des Toten von ihm beleidigt oder gekränkt wurde, verzeiht er ihm. Als Zeichen für seine innige Vergebung legt die Person etwas Wohlriechen-des auf das Feuer. Diese Rituale, die nicht in den Schriften überliefert sind und von denen wir nicht wissen, wann sie den Todesritualen hinzu-gefügt wurden, werden noch heute in einigen Familien praktiziert. d. Die Unreinheit des Leichnams Dem Gedanken der durch den Kontakt mit einem Leichnam verursach-ten rituellen Unreinheit (mp. rëmariih) wird seit der Mitte des 20. Jahr-hunderts immer weniger Bedeutung beigemessen. Zwar werden Bett und Laken des Toten immer noch selbstverständlich weggeworfen, da sich der Tod heute allerdings meistens in Krankenhäusern ereignet, kann auch diese Vorschrift nicht in jedem Fall eingehalten werden. Vereinzelt besteht heute auch die Tendenz, die Idee ritueller Unreinheit als grund-sätzlich überflüssig und bedeutungslos zu betrachten. Dabei handelt es sich jedoch um Einzelpositionen, die von der Mehrheit der Zarathustrier nicht geteilt werden. 3. Das Ablegen von Gelübden Aus dem säyest näsäyest geht hervor, dass man beim Erbitten eines Wunsches (np. hägat, mp. äyaft) und beim Ablegen eines Gelübdes mit der Gottheit in Verbindung trat. Bei dieser Gottheit handelte es sich meistens um den Gott mäh, in dessen Namen besonders häufig Gelübde ausgesprochen wurden. Erfüllte sich der Wunsch, so wurden bestimmte Rituale (ostufrid-e izadän, mp. ustöfrld ï yaz.adän) vollzogen, für die die Teilnahme von Priestern belegt ist. Neben dem säyest näsäyest berich-"},{"pageNumber":651,"pageContent":"2    — ι ten auch Schriften wie das Saddar Bundehesh und das Revayat-e Därab Hormozyär von Ritualen, die das Ablegen von Gelübden betreffen. Heute scheint anstelle des ostufrid-e izadän und dem Lesen der niy-äyes eine der folgenden Praktiken üblich zu sein: Man tritt mit einer Gottheit (wie bahräm, astäd oder mehr), dem Feuer atas bahräm oder einem pïr (pir-e sabz oder pir-e närestäne) in Verbindung bzw. legt ein Gelübde ab, indem man entweder ein sofre ausrichtet (wie z.B. das sofre-ye dohtar-e säh-e pariyän, sofre-ye bi-bi sesambe, sofre-ye bah-man amesäspand, sofre-ye moskel-gosä) oder für ein sofre, das eine an-dere Person ausgerichtet hat, etwas mitbringt. Das Gelübde im Namen von nohoud-e moskel-gosä gehörte in der Vergangenheit zu den häufig-sten Gelübden und wird auch heute noch abgelegt. Zu den Ritualen, die noch heute nach Erfüllung eines Wunsches praktiziert werden, gehören Wallfahrten und das Spenden von Geld, Kerzen oder Dingen, die an ein Gelübde geknüpft waren: Man opfert Schafe, kocht äs-e nodri oder si-roug, kauft und verteilt nohoud-e moskel-gosä und erzählt die dazugehö-rige Geschichte. Eine Sitte, die heute kaum noch üblich ist, ist das Ge-lübde, an Tagen wie dem astäd ruz auf den Verzehr von Brot oder Spei-sen, die aus Weizen hergestellt werden, zu verzichten. In Bezug auf das Ablegen von Gelübden verdienen folgende Punkte Beachtung: a. Vergleicht man die gegenwärtige Praxis mit den Überlieferungen aus dem säyest näsäyest und dem Saddar Bundehesh, so ist zu konstatieren, dass die Gläubigen heute seltener mit den Gottheiten in Verbindung tre-ten. Gelübde im Namen der Gottheit mäh werden nur noch an ganz be-stimmten Tagen abgelegt: Fällt zum Beispiel der Tag mäh auf einen Samstag, so wird dieser Tag mähsambe genannt und man kocht äs-e nodri oder siroug. Wenn die Gläubigen heute mit einer Gottheit in Ver-bindung treten wollen, so wird zunächst ein Gebet (wie z.B. das bahräm yast) zur Eröffnung gelesen. Das Kochen einer Suppe oder siroug am Tag der Gottheit bahräm oder beim atas bahräm-Feuer stellt heute die Ausnahme dar. b. Der Besuch von Wallfahrtstätten undpir ist aufgrund der Verfügbar-keit modemer Transportmittel heute sehr viel stärker als in der Vergan-genheit verbreitet. 2 S. 115-116"},{"pageNumber":652,"pageContent":"c. Das Ausrichten religiös motivierter sofre und das Ablegen von Gelüb-den im Namen von Gottheiten erfreuen sich besonders seit dem Iran-Irak-Krieg großer Beliebtheit. Priester und viele Sozialreformer stehen diesen sofre jedoch kritisch und distanziert gegenüber. Die Priester spielen bei dem Ausrichten der oben genannten Rituale kei-ne Rolle und stehen häufig sogar in Opposition zu ihnen. Sie werden— außer zum Lesen der niyäyes für die Gottheiten—nicht zu den Veranstal-tungen eingeladen. Es sind hauptsächlich Frauen, die Gelübde ablegen und die damit in Zusammenhang stehenden Rituale durchführen. Auch die so/re-Geschichten werden hauptsächlich von Frauen erzählt. 4. Menstruation und Geburt Das dritte Kapitel des säyest näsäyest ist der Unreinheit von Geburt und Menstruation und den daraus resultierenden Formen von Enthaltsamkeit und Reinigung gewidmet. Veränderungen, die sich für Rituale ergeben, die in diesem Zusammenhang durchgeführt werden, können in zwei Gruppen unterteilt werden: a. Es bestehen große Unterschiede zwischen den Angaben im säyest näsäyest und anderen Pahlavischriften im Vergleich zu den Ritualen und Vorstellungen, die bereits vor den 1950er Jahren existierten. So ist es den Frauen heute z.B. nicht mehr gestattet, während der Menstruation das niyäyes zu lesen, obgleich dies im Widerspruch zu den alten Vor-schriften steht. Früher war menstruierenden Frauen die Teilnahme an Leichenprozessionen erlaubt, während es ihnen heute nicht gestattet ist, sich einem Toten zu nähern oder gar einen Leichnam zu sehen. Die Vor-schrift, die es den Frauen während ihrer Menstruation verbot, den Mond, die Sonne oder die Sterne anzuschauen, wurde auch schon vor den 1950er Jahren nicht mehr befolgt. Meinungsverschiedenheiten existierten in den alten Textes auch be-züglich der dastänestän, d.h. speziellen Häusern für die menstruierenden Frauen eines Dorfes oder einer Stadt. Abgesehen von Gerüchten, die über einzelne dastänestän kursierten (z.B. in Taft bei Yazd), liegen aus dem vergangenen Jahrhundert faktisch keine zuverlässigen Informatio-nen über diese Menstruationshäuser vor. Ebenso wurden auch Menstruationsvorschriften, wie das Vermeiden von Wasser für die Körperreinigung sowie das Arbeitsverbot und die Isolation in der Praxis häufig nicht beachtet. Die wichtigste Verände-"},{"pageNumber":653,"pageContent":"rung, die sich für diese Rituale bereits vor der Mitte des 20. Jahrhundert ergeben hatte, war die Abschaffung des Tabus, während der Menstruati-on Wasser für die Körperreinigung zu verwenden. Einer alten Vorschrift zufolge war es einer menstruierenden Frau nicht erlaubt, mit Wasser in Berührung zu kommen. Dennoch existierte schon vor den 1950er Jahren der Brauch, Frauen gleich nach Eintreten der Menstruation am ganzen Körper rituell mit Wasser zu waschen. Hierbei wurde sowohl das Prinzip ritueller Unreinheit als auch das der Heiligkeit des Wassers missachtet. b. Im Zuge der Veränderungen des 20. Jahrhunderts und der Emigration vieler Zarathustrier aus den Dörfern in die Großstädte haben sich die Vorstellungen von ritueller Unreinheit während Menstruation und Schwangerschaft rapide verändert. Die Einhaltung der alten Menstruati-ons- und Schwangerschaftsvorschriften wäre bei den Nachbarn in der neuen Umgebung auf Erstaunen und Verwunderung gestoßen. Da Frau-en meistens nur gemeinsam mit ihren Ehemännern wegzogen, waren sie in der neuen Umgebung auf sich allein gestellt. Es gab keine andere Frau, die während der menstruationsbedingten Isolationszeit ihre Pflich-ten im Haushalt übernommen hätte, während sich in Yazd die Frauen der Nachbarschaft in Notsituationen gegenseitig halfen. Die wichtigsten Gründe für die Veränderungen der Schwanger-schafts- und Menstruationsvorschriften waren: 1. Das alte Gesetz, demzufolge Wasser durch den Kontakt mit dem Kör-per einer menstruierenden Frau verunreinigt wird und diese Verunreini-gung des Wassers eine Sünde ist, geriet in Vergessenheit. Dementspre-chend war es nicht mehr erforderlich, dass menstruierende Frauen den Kontakt mit Wasser mieden und von der Körperpflege mit Wasser sowie der Erledigung der täglichen Arbeiten im Haushalt Abstand nahmen. 2. Im Gegensatz zu früher besaßen die modernen Häuser keinen beson-deren Trakt, der den rituellen Reinheitsvorschriften entsprach (wie z.B. der nän-o-sofre-Raum oder der pesgam-e boz.org, d.h. ein großer Raum für die Durchführung religiöser Zeremonien). Auch die Küche galt nicht mehr als heiliger Ort, weil das traditionelle Holzfeuer dort alsbald durch ein mit Öl betriebenes ersetzt wurde. Da die Frauen somit während der Menstruation häufig keinen speziellen Ort mehr für die Wahrung ihrer Isolationszeit besaßen, hielten sie sich gezwungenermaßen in allen Räumen des Hauses auf. 3. Die alten religiösen Rituale wurden nur noch sehr selten in den Pri-vathäusern abgehalten. Daher war es nicht mehr zwingend notwendig,"},{"pageNumber":654,"pageContent":"das Haus ganz oder zum Teil rituell rein zu halten. 4. Ein bedeutender Teil der Gesetze im dritten Kapitel des säyestnäsäy-est betrifft den medizinischen Bereich. Heutzutage werden Schwanger-schaft und Geburt nicht von dem Priester, sondern dem Arzt betreut. Dadurch wird die Einsicht gefördert, den außergewöhnlichen Zustand der Frau während der Schwangerschaft und der Niederkunft als medizi-nischen Prozess und nicht als Form ritueller Unreinheit zu begreifen. 5. Moderne Hygieneartikel und neuer technischer Komfort in den Wohn-häusern übten auch auf die Zarathustrier eine große Anziehungskraft aus. Sowohl die Laien als auch die Priester wollten mit dem Erwerb der neuen Produkte ihren Alltag bequemer und komfortabler gestalten. Die neuen Produkte der täglichen Hygiene erleichterten viele Probleme, die sich bis dahin in Zusammenhang mit der Menstruation ergeben hatten. 6. Trotzdem ist es menstruierenden Frauen bis heute nicht gestattet, hei-lige Orte zu betreten oder an Zeremonien teilzunehmen, die als heilig gelten. Man achtet sogar darauf, dass die Braut, wenn sie an dem girän-sofre Platz nimmt, rituell rein zu sein hat, d.h. sich nicht in der Menstru-ationsphase befindet. (Vor den 1950er Jahren vertrat der Vater oder ein Bevollmächtigter die Braut bei diesem Heiratsritual.) 5. Individualrituale und -gebete Individualrituale und persönliche Gebete (niyäyes) nehmen einen großen Teil der heutigen zarathustrischen Rituale in Iran ein und waren in be-sonderem Maße Veränderungen ausgesetzt. So wird zum Beispiel das traditionelle Geburtstagsfest, das man früher säl-giri nannte, heute in europäischer Weise gefeiert. Desgleichen haben auch die umfangreichen Hochzeitsrituale ein europäisches Aussehen bekommen. Diese Entwick-lungen hier im Einzelnen zu beschreiben, würde den Rahmen des Auf-satzes sprengen, zumal diese Themen auch in der Literatur nur ansatz-weise behandelt werden. Bei den Individualritualen und niyäyes sind folgende Veränderungen erwähnenswert: a. Das sedre-pusi-Ritual Beim sedre-pusi-Ritua\\ wird den Kindern zum Zeichen der Initiation in einer speziellen Zeremonie das sedre angezogen und das kosti um die Taille gebunden. Dieses Ritual war bis zur Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts keineswegs flächendeckend verbreitet, obgleich Manekji (1813-1890)"},{"pageNumber":655,"pageContent":"seine Wiederbelebung vorangetrieben hatte. Heute wird es im Rahmen eines großen Festes von den Priestern durchgeführt. Verglichen mit den in den alten Texten enthaltenen Vorschriften, hatten sich die Breite des koÊti, seine Qualität sowie die Qualität des sedre bereits schon vor den 1950er Jahren verändert. b. Die täglichen Gebete (niyäyes) Bis zur Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts war das tägliche fünfmalige Lesen der Gebete (niyäyes) und die Rezitation bestimmter Gebete an den ,Lieb-lingstagen' (ormazd, mehr, bahräm und sorus) üblich. Obwohl die Gläubigen kein Avestisch beherrschten, sprachen sie trotzdem bestimmte kleine Verse der Gebete mit. Zwar gibt es heute sogar noch unter den Jugendlichen Personen, die die täglichen Gebete verrichten, aber die ausführlichen, laut zu rezitierenden Gebete werden kaum noch gespro-chen. c. Das baresnum und das yast kardan Das baresnum oder noswe bezeichnet die rituelle Waschung des ganzen Körpers, die sich über 9 Nächte und Tage erstreckt und entsprechend der schriftlichen Überlieferung unbedingt von jedem Gläubigen mindestens einmal im Leben vollzogen werden muss. Das obligatorische noswe war bis zur Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts noch nicht ganz aufgegeben. Nach dem Iran-Iraq-Krieg ist das noswe jedoch offenbar vollständig aus dem Gebrauch gekommen, und es gibt heute niemanden mehr, der dieses alte Reinigungsritual noch stellvertretend für andere Personen durchführt. Jenes Ritual, das im säyest näsäyest mit dem Begriff yast kardan be-zeichnet wird, ist wahrscheinlich mit dem heutigen giti harid identisch. Unter giti harid versteht man die Ausführung einer bestimmten Anzahl von Ritualen (niyäyes). Sie ist für jeden Gläubigen mindestens einmal im Leben verbindlich. Allerdings ist es erlaubt, gegen Bezahlung stell-vertretend einen Priester mit der Durchführung dieses Rituals zu beauf-tragen. Im Laufe der Zeit hat sich diese Art der niyäyes-Lesung zu einem festen Ritual entwickelt, das von den Priestern für die Verstorbenen durchführt wird. d. Andere Gebete (niyäyes) Abgesehen von dem avestä- ye tacämhordan waren die cames-Gebete (d.h. bestimmte Gebete für das Urinieren und Ausscheiden von Exkre-menten) sowie eine Reihe von Ritualformeln für das Nägelschneiden"},{"pageNumber":656,"pageContent":"und ähnliche Tätigkeiten alle bereits vor den 1950er Jahren in Verges-senheit geraten. 6. Bäz-e nän hwordan Die Pahlavischriften pochen immer wieder auf das Sprechen von Gebe-ten (niyäyes) und das Wahren von Stille bei den Mahlzeiten. Bis zur Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts sprach man häufig zu Beginn und am Ende der Mahlzeiten ein bestimmtes Gebet (niyäyes), das unter dem Namen avestä-ye tacäm hwordan bekannt ist. Desgleichen wurde auch empfoh-len, das Essen in Stille und bäz einzunehmen. Heutzutage ist von diesen Ritualen fast nichts mehr erhalten. Besonders nach dem Krieg wird man kaum noch eine Familie finden, die ihren Kindern das bäz-e nän for-dern beibringt und sie dazu anhält, beim Essen Stille zu bewahren. 7. Das baresnum und das si sur Das baresnum bzw. noswe Reinigungsritual dient der rituellen Reini-gung von rimani, d.h. von ,Verschmutzung' oder ,Unreinheit'. Eine Deutung bringt den Zustand von rimani mit Krankheit und Tod in Ver-bindung, eine andere Erklärung stellt einen Zusammenhang mit Geburt und Tod her. Ein großer Teil der Deutungen von rimani bezieht sich auf die rituelle Unreinheit der Frau, den Geschlechtsverkehr und den Sa-menerguß sowie auf den Leichnam und den Kontakt mit ihm. In Schrif-ten wie dem säyest näsäyest, zand-e fragard-e vendidäd und vendidäd nehmen die Gesetze zur rituellen Unreinheit und rituellen Reinigung ei-nen großen Stellenwert ein. Das noswe und die rituelle Reinigung si sur (d.h. die dreizigmalige Reinigung mit Wasser und Rinderurin) waren noch bis zur Mitte des 20. Jahrhundert gebräuchlich. Über das obligato-rische einmalige noswe hinaus, das jeder Gläubige vollziehen mußte, war für Frauen, die ein behindertes Kind geboren hatten und für alle, die einen Leichnam berührt oder getragen hatten, entweder das noswe oder mindestens das si sur zwingend vorgeschrieben. Zuerst geriet das si sur und dann auch das noswe in Vergessenheit, ohne dass der Priesterrat in Teheran den Erhalt dieser rituellen Reinigungszeremonien angemahnt hätte. Obgleich diese alten Rituale in Orten wie Sharifabad eventuell noch lebendig seien mögen, weiß andernorts seit dem Krieg kaum noch jemand um die Bedeutung von rimani, und niemand lehrt sie mehr den Kindern. Desgleichen ist auch die Verwendung von Rinderurin für die"},{"pageNumber":657,"pageContent":"Reinigung gänzlich aus dem Gebrauch gekommen, und in bestimmten Situationen, wie z.B. bei der Leichenwäsche, verwendet man stattdessen Rosenwasser. Das Trinken von nirang, einem Getränk aus Rinderurin, das nur zu außergewöhnlichen Anlässen zubereitet und angewendet wurde, war bereits vor den 1950er Jahren nicht mehr üblich. 8. Feste Im Gegensatz zu den gähämbär, die unter Mitwirkung von Priestern durchgeführt werden, richten die Gläubigen Feste wie das nou-ruz, hordäd-ruz wa farwardin mäh, tirgän, mehrgän, sade und auch cahär-sambe-suri in eigener Regie aus. Bei einigen dieser Feste rezitieren die mubad allerdings in den Feuertempeln bestimmte, dem Anlass entspre-chende Gebete (niyäyes). Im Vergleich zu der Zeit vor der Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts sind heute auch bezüglich der Feste Veränderungen aufge-treten: So wird das cahär-sambe-suri beispielsweise—von einigen we-nigen Ausnahmen abgesehen—erst neuerdings wieder gefeiert. Für die Festlegung der Feste stehen zwei Kalender zur Verfügung: Der alte Ka-lender, der die kabise nicht berücksichtigt, war bis in die 1950er Jahre vor allem in Yazd und in Kerman gebräuchlich. Nach mehreren vergeb-lichen Versuchen, den alten Kalender durch einen neuen zu ersetzen, wurde letztendlich fast überall erfolgreich der neue Kalender eingeführt. Dieser entspricht in etwa dem modernen iranischen Kalender. a. Nou-ruz Das Neujahrsfest wurde bis zur Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts in Yazd und Kerman an zwei verschiedenen Daten gefeiert: Zum einen beging man das ormazd ruz. bzw. pange (nou-ruz-e mordegän), das sich an dem alten Kalender orientierte und in den Sommer fiel, und zum anderen feierte man das nou-ruz-e fasli, dessen Datierung dem offiziellen Kalender des Iran entsprach und auf den Frühlingsbeginn fiel. Auch die Rituale dieser beiden Neujahrsfeste unterschieden sich voneinander: Zehn Tage vor Beginn der beiden Neujahrsfeste (an dem ,kleinen pange' und dem ,großen pange') fand der Hausputz statt. Fünf Tage vor dem Sommer-Neujahrs-Fest wurde das gähambär-pange ausgeführt, das vor allem den Verstorbenen gewidmet war. Heute führt man dieses gähämbär in Tehe-ran ausschließlich vor dem Frühlings-Neujahr durch, während es in Yazd sowohl vor dem Frühlings-Neujahr als auch vor dem Sommer-Neujahr gefeiert wird."},{"pageNumber":658,"pageContent":"Im Vergleich zu heute fiel das sofre nou-ruzi-Ritua\\ des Frühlings-Neujahrs weniger umfangreich aus und wurde im nän-o-sofre-Zimmer unter dem wigu durchgeführt. Wie heute säte man auch früher Samen für das sabzi aus, das sich jedoch von dem sabzi für die Verstorbenen und dem des pange des Sommer-Neujahrs, dem so genannten sesa, un-terschied. Die rituellen Praktiken der beiden Neujahrsfeste sind äußerst umfangreich. Während dem Sommer-Neujahrsfest in Teheran heute kaum Aufmerksamkeit geschenkt wird, feiert man demgegenüber das Frühlings-Neujahr wesentlich ausführlicher als in der Vergangenheit. b. Hordäd-ruz wa farwardin mäh Dieses Fest, das in den Schriften „großes Neujahr\" genannt und mit dem zarathustrischen Begriff habdoru oder auch als „Fest des Königs Keyhosrou\" bezeichnet wird, wurde bis zur Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts in der Regel während der Sommer-Neujahrsfeierlichkeiten durchgeführt. Heute feiert man es—besonders in Teheran—während des Frühlings-Neujahrs. Während dieser Tage war es üblich, eine Divination (jäl-e ku-ze) vorzunehmen und um die Mittagszeit in den Privathäusern ein be-stimmtes sofre zu arrangieren sowie ein spezielles Gebet zu sprechen. Heutzutage wird dieses Fest mehr unter dem Motto der Geburt Zara-thustras und seiner Prophet-Werdung in moderner Weise—d.h. begleitet von zeitgenössischer Musik und einer Ausstellung—in öffentlichen Ver-sammlungsorten und Stiftungsgebäuden begangen. Abgesehen von der Rezitation des Gebets haben die Priester keinen Anteil an dem Fest. c. Tirgän Dieses fröhliche und mit Gesang zelebrierte Fest wird in der lebendigen zarathustrischen Tradition gasn-e tir-o-testar genannt und ist ein Fest des Wasserspielens und -spritzens. Am Tag der Gottheit tir des Monats tir knotet man sich Seidenfäden in sieben Farbtönen (Regenbogenfar-ben) um das Handgelenk, um die verknoteten Fäden am Tag der Gottheit bäd des Monats tir zu öffnen und dem Wind preiszugeben. Dieses Ritual und einige seiner Details bestehen noch heute fort. Da, wenn die Hitze im Monat tir ihren Höhepunkt erreicht, das Spritzen von Wasser auf Köpfe und Gesichter anderer eine spaßige Angelegenheit ist, erfreut sich das Fest sogar zunehmender Beliebtheit. 3 Das wigu ist eine aus Schilf geflochtene, quadratische Schale, die an der Decke aufgehängt ist und auf die man Lebensmittel und Gegenstände legt, damit diese vor Katzen und Insekten geschützt sind."},{"pageNumber":659,"pageContent":"Das berühmte Gedicht Aras-e kamängir von Seyäwos Kasrä3i, das den mythologischen Ursprung des Festes tirgän zu neuem Leben er-weckte, hatte großen Anteil an der Bekanntheit des Festes tiregän und des Bogenschützen Aras in der heutigen Zeit. Im Jahre 2002 wurde das tirgän-Fest im ganzen Land mit neuer Intensität gefeiert. Während des Festes wurde auch eine Divination (fal-e kuze) vorgenommen. d. Mehrgän Das Fest mehrgän findet in den religiösen Texten der Zarathustrier keine besondere Erwähnung. Es geht heute mit dem Opfern eines Schafes oder Huhnes und dem Rösten des Tieres im tanur einher. Einer alten Traditi-on entsprechend, die noch bis in die 1950er Jahre in Dörfern wie z.B. Horramsäh bei Yazd praktiziert wurde, wurde das Schaf von der Dorf-gemeinschaft gemeinsam gekauft, geopfert und gebraten. Man trieb das Schaf mit Musik und Gesang durch die Wohnviertel der Zarathustrier, um es schließlich im Gebäude des säwarahräm iz.ad zu schlachten. Nach der Rezitation entsprechender Gebete wurde das Fleisch dann unter den Anwesenden aufgeteilt. Diese Sitte ist heute noch in einigen wenigen Dörfern—wie z.B. Mubärake bei Yazd—üblich. In Kermän wurden auch Hühner geschlachtet, und im Morgengrauen wurde auf den Dä-chern der Häuser das mehr izad sofre ausgerichtet. Heute werden diese Rituale nicht mehr praktiziert. Seit dem Krieg hat man in Teheran sogar das Rösten des Schafes im tanur und die Bewir-tung von Gästen beim mehrgän-Fest aufgegeben. Die Gründe dafür sind zum Teil in den modernen Lebensumständen zu suchen, da in den mo-dernen Häusern weder ein Platz für das Schlachten von Schafen noch ein tanur für das Rösten derselben zur Verfügung steht. Selbstverständlich sind Schafe auch teuer, und es gibt niemanden mehr, der sich darauf ver-steht, das Schaf im tanur traditionsgemäß zu rösten. e. Sade und cahär-sambe-suri Während früher in Yazd weder beim sade noch beim cahär-sambe-suri das Entzünden eines Feuers üblich war und das sade eigentlich nur in Kermän (in seiner vollständigen Form) gefeiert wurde, werden heute beide Feste glanzvoll zelebriert. Das sade hat sich zu einem großen all-gemeinen Fest entwickelt, an dem auch die Priester teilnehmen. In Shari-fabad bei Yazd wird das hirombä-Ritual des Feuerentzündens heutzuta-ge im Frühling prachtvoll gefeiert."},{"pageNumber":660,"pageContent":"f. Sab-e celle Das sab-e celle wird von den Zarathustriern wie von den meisten ande-ren Iranern zu Winterbeginn begangen. Das alte horram-ruz-, ormazd-oder deymäh-Fest war bereits vor den 1950er Jahren in Vergessenheit geraten. 9. Mikxorituale Kleinere Ritualabläufe, die bis zu den 1950er Jahren verbreitet waren und zum Teil auch heute noch einen Platz im Alltag der Zarathustrier haben, können bis auf die alten Schriften zurückgeführt werden. Beispie-le dafür sind: a. Wohlriechendes auf das Feuer legen Bis zur Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts war die Sitte, etwas Wohlriechendes auf das Feuer zu legen, weit verbreitet. Die Häuser und Gassen, die man vor Sonnenaufgang gefegt und mit Wasser besprengt hatte, waren vom Duft wilder Raute (esfand) und Weihrauch (kondor) sowie dem Summen der Avesta-Rezitation erfüllt. Heutzutage—besonders nach der Auswan-derung vieler Familien aus Yazd und Kermän—wird dieser Brauch kaum noch praktiziert. b. Waschen von Gesicht und Hände bei Tagesanbruch Morgens nach dem Aufwachen die Hände, das Gesicht und den Mund zu waschen, ist heute eine in Iran weit verbreitete Sitte. Trotzdem ist festzustellen, dass das Beten des ashem vohu während des Hände- und Gesichtwaschens heute seltener praktiziert und auch den Kindern kaum noch beigebracht wird. Schon vor den 1950er Jahren war der Brauch, Gesicht, Hände und Mund mit Rinderurin zu reinigen, in Vergessenheit geraten. Lediglich menstruierende Frauen und Leute, die sich dem no.vwe-Reimgungsritual unterzogen, wuschen ihre Hände mit Rinder-urin. Heute gehören Reinigungsrituale mit Rinderurin gänzlich der Ver-gangenheit an. c. Niyäyes-sofre-Ritua\\e Wenn die Priester anlässlich der gähämbär oder im Rahmen von Toten-ritualen niyäyes lesen, legen sie Lebensmittel und Gegenstände auf das sofre. Einige dieser auf dem sofre platzierten Dinge, wie z.B. Milch, Wein, Raute (sodäb), Knoblauch und Zweige von Pflanzen und Blumen,"},{"pageNumber":661,"pageContent":". sind in den alten Schriften erwähnt. Daneben werden heute jedoch auch Lebensmittel auf das sofre gestellt, die für dieses Ritual eine Neuerung darstellen. So finden ζ. B. Kartoffeln großzügige Verwendung. Eine Ur-sache für die immer umfangreichere Gestaltung des sofre ist sicherlich der wirtschaftliche Wohlstand und der Einsatz moderner Küchenma-schinen. Entgegen dem, was in den Schriften verzeichnet ist und vor 1950 Sitte war, nimmt man heute jedoch bei dieser sofre in der Regel vom Opfern eines Schafes und dem Verzehr von Fleisch Abstand. ERGEBNISSE Wenn die oben getroffene Auswahl zarathustrischer Rituale dem Anspruch des Themas gerecht wird, sollte deutlich geworden sein, dass Rituale ihre Basis in den Überzeugungen und Vorstellungen der Ritualakteure haben. Diese Glaubensvorstellungen waren seit der Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts verstärkt den Einflüssen einer durch wissenschaftlichen und technischen Fortschritt geprägten Zeit ausgesetzt. Gegenüber den neuen Werten der profanen Welt konnten sich die alten Glaubensvorstellungen, die der sak-ralen Welt angehörten, nicht behaupten und verloren ihre Gültigkeit. Die religiösen Konsolidierungsprozesse im 9. Jahrhundert hatten die alten Glaubensvorstellungen und Rituale nicht mit Beweisen und Argu-menten untermauert, sondern lediglich durch Verweis auf die Tradition und die Verbundenheit mit den Ahnen. Dadurch fehlte es den nachfol-genden Priestern an Argumenten, um die religiösen Vorstellungen und Praktiken vor Neuerungen zu schützen. Obgleich die zarathustrischen Priester unter den Gläubigen Respekt und Achtung genossen, vermoch-ten sie es daher nicht, den Ansprüchen der Neuzeit zu begegnen und ihre Religion mit Mitteln der Moderne zu verteidigen. Damit war der Weg für Veränderungen, die Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts in massiver Weise eintraten, bereitet. Obgleich das alte Verständnis von ritueller Unreinheit (rimani) zum Teil schon vor den 1950er Jahren seine Bedeutung eingebüßt hatte, wur-den die mit dieser Vorstellung in Zusammenhang stehenden traditionel-len Handlungen und Verhaltensweisen noch eine Zeit lang beachtet. Nachdem jedoch die neuen Werte und Maßstäbe der profanen Welt das Denken der Menschen bestimmte, muteten die alten Reinheitsrituale fremd und sonderbar an. Sie verloren ihre Gültigkeit und wurden nicht mehr an die nachfolgenden Generationen weitergegeben. Da kein Be-wusstsein mehr für rituelle Reinheit existierte, schienen auch die auf die-sem Prinzip aufbauenden Rituale und Traditionen sinnentleert und über-"},{"pageNumber":662,"pageContent":"flüssig. Alte Reinigungsrituale, Menstruations- und Schwangerschafts-vorschriften sowie Regeln im Umgang mit Toten verloren daher ihre Bedeutung und wurden nicht mehr beachtet. Daher ist heute z.B. für einen jungen zarathustrischen Medizinstu-denten der Umgang mit einem toten Körper im Rahmen seiner Anato-miestudien völlig unproblematisch, obgleich die Tradition in solchen gravierenden Fällen ritueller Unreinheit überaus umfangreiche Reini-gungsrituale vorschreibt. An diesem Beispiel wird klar, dass, wenn es der zarathustrischen Gemeinde nicht gelungen wäre, sich für ein bestimmtes Maß an Verän-derungen zu öffnen, sondern alternativ in Abwehr zu den neuen Ver-hältnissen verharrt wäre, sie entweder auf den Anschluss an die Moderne (in Form von Ausbildung zarathustrischer Ärzte) verzichten oder den totalen Bruch mit den religiösen Traditionen erleben müsste. Der beson-dere Mechanismus, der dafür sorgt, dass Veränderungen in den Ritualen keinen absoluten Bruch mit den Traditionen bedeuten, besteht darin, dass Rituale aus verschiedenen Teilen bestehen, die einer bestimmten Ordnung entsprechend organisiert sind und eine unabhängige Einheit bilden. Werden nun einzelne Teile dieser Einheit verändert oder gar eli-miniert, so bleibt dennoch das unabhängige Ganze—eventuell in leicht veränderter Gestalt—bestehen. Dieser Mechanismus garantiert ein hohes Maß an Flexibilität im Umgang mit Neuerungen. Im Ergebnis können wir einen langsamen Veränderungsprozess bei den schriftlich fixierten Ritualen feststellen, der stets die Harmonie mit den bestehenden sozialen und mentalen Bedingungen in der zarathustri-schen Gemeinde gesucht hat. Obgleich daher, verglichen mit Schriften wie dem sâyest näsäyest, nur wenige Rituale in ihrer ursprünglichen Form erhalten geblieben sind, haben sich viele gerade durch ihre Anpas-sung an die jeweilige Situation zu grundlegenden Konstanten der zarathustrischen Religion entwickelt. Die Abschaffung der Kopfsteuer (1882) und die neue Wertschätzung, die der zarathustrischen Gemeinde seit Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts von Seiten der iranischen Muslime entgegengebracht wurde, wirkten sich auf bestimmte Rituale positiv aus: So erlebten einige Feste einen neuen Auf-schwung und werden heute ausgiebiger als früher gefeiert. Auch be-stimmte Todesrituale wie das z.B. das säl werden heute umfangreicher ausgeführt. Ein Grund dafür mag sicherlich auch der wachsende Wohl-stand der zarathustrischen Gemeinde Irans sein."},{"pageNumber":663,"pageContent":"Die Fähigkeit der ritualkonstitutiven Teile, durch Anpassung an die neuen Verhältnisse erhalten zu bleiben, beruht zum einen auf den indi-viduellen Eigenschaften des ritualkonstitutiven Teils und hängt zum an-deren von seiner Beziehung zu anderen ritualkonstitutiven Elementen und den Normen der Gesellschaft ab. So haben sich z.B. die Breite des kosti und die Qualität des sedre verändert, während das bäz-e nän Jor-dan ganz verschwunden ist.

Die Priester (mubad), die seit Jahrtausenden die zarathustrischen Ri-tuale bewahrt und diese u.U. sogar geschaffen haben, stehen heute den rituellen Veränderungen positiv gegenüber. Diese Aufgeschlossenheit gegenüber Neuerungen, die übrigens schon in den alten Schriften belegt ist, stellt eine Ursache für die große Vielfalt zarathustrischer Rituale in Iran dar. Neben den erwähnten sozialen und mentalen Ursachen hat sie wiederholt als unabhängige Kraft beim Wandel von Ritualen mitgewirkt.

At times it is a pitiable sight, depressing sight, [to see] that so many people are coming for hope. And God willing they get their answers in this life. [MrFB] Ever since its foundation in colonial times, Bombay (nowadays Mumbai) has been a multi-religious venue. The 'city of gold', or the 'city of dreams', as Bombay is often referred to,1 houses a multitude of gods and protagonists of the divine who are exhibited and worshipped in numer-ous temples, shrines, mandirs, mosques, dargahs, synagogues, churches, water tanks, wells and plenty of other religious places and spaces.2 Contrary to many such buildings, the gates of the Parsi (Zoroastrian) fire-temples are hermetically locked to non-Zoroastrians. Signposts placed at the entry-gates warn \"No admission except for Parsees\" (or similar), occasionally even threatening with legal consequences in case of transgression. Access to the 'towers of silence' (dokhme; doonger-wadi), which most travel guidebooks still rank as one of the city's main tourist attractions, has long since been denied to tourists and non-Parsis in general by the Parsi authorities (the Bombay Parsi Punchayat). * With collaboration by Mrs Zarin Marfatia (see below). I would like to take this op-portunity to express my sincere gratitude to Mrs Marfatia for all the time and energy she has put into the project. It has been a great pleasure to work (and to share meals) with her and to come to know her husband Jamsheed. 1 G. Tindall, City of Gold.

The main exception confirming the rule is the 'birthday of the waters' (Ava mahino Ava roj, i.e. the festival when the month and the day named after the [deity of the] waters [Ava] coincide). On that day, many Parsis, not the least Parsi-ladies in white dresses, in the evening before sunset can be seen at the beaches, the seashore, and the wells, in particu-lar the Bhikha Behram Well, where they pray and place their offerings such as flowers and coconuts.3 Compared with that, some Muslim and Hindu festivals such as Coconut Day, Holi, Diwali, and most of all the Muharram- and Ganesha-processions are celebrated on a grand scale, virtually involving the entire population. This includes many Parsis as well, whose lives in various ways are affected by these festivals and who, moreover, may participate in these celebrations in different capaci-ties and roles (as actors, spectators, or 'objects').4 EXTRAORDINARY POPULAR SANCTUARIES IN BOMBAY CITY Bombay does belong neither to the classical or traditional nor to second grade or the modem Indian pilgrimage places (tirtha). Nevertheless, the city possesses some places of worship that enjoy a special reputation among its inhabitants, the Bombayites. Probably the best-known temple is a temple devoted to Mahalakshmi. This temple—I am not aware of its history—is located at the shores of the Arabian Sea and seems to draw large crowds on a daily basis, but especially, I was told, on Fridays.5 Right opposite this temple, in the middle of a small bay, there is the sea-mausoleum of Haji Ali, which during low tide is regularly visited not only by Muslims, but by devotees belonging to different communities, es-pecially, it is reported, on Thursdays (at noon and 4pm).6 The history of 3 See Ph.

Still today, on the death-anniversary of the saint, in December, a ten-day fair is held that draws large crowds.8 In 1543, also at Mahim, the Franciscans built the oldest surviving church of the city, St. Michael's, which nowadays is a very popular venue for its Novenas taking place on Wednesdays.9 These Novenas are well known among Bombayites from all communities whom I have been talking to during my visits to the city (in 1991, 1994, 1997, 1998, 2000, and 2002). North of Mahim, at Bandra, another Christian sanctuary, Mount Mary, attracts people from different communities, especially dur-ing the fair that is held in September ( 10th through 17th) and on the festi-val of Mary's birth (September 8th). Close to the now posh area of Malabar Hill, where the 'towers of si-lence' are located, there is both a big Jain temple with a constant flow of devotees, and Walkeshwar temple—the present structure was built in 1715—, \"the most famous and ancient Siva sanctuary of Bombay\",10 to which a big and renowned water tank, called Banganga, is attached. Close by, another temple where a Shiva-lingam is venerated is to be found, the Babulnath temple, built in 1780. This sacred precinct also attracts worshippers from different communities who mainly come there on Mondays. Reportedly also more than 200 years old is the Siddhivi-nayak-temple housing a large black-stone figure ('idol') of Ganesha (with the trunk turned to the right instead of to the left) in central Bom-bay. This temple is reported to attract thousands of people daily, and on Tuesdays, the main day of worship, the queue of devotees is said to stretch over several miles.11 Tuesday is also the chief day of worship at one other of the city's main places of worship, the Mumbadevi temple, housing the tall stone statue of the former Koli-deity Mumbadevi who, 7 See David, Bombay, p. 77. 8 See David, Bombay, pp. 12-13. 9 On Wednesdays, the mass is celebrated at 6.15am, 7am, and 7.45am.

In fact, the three of them are reached by the same train-station (Marine Lines/Western Railways). Apart from these 'historic' sanctuaries, some place of more recent origin are much fre-quented. As was to be expected, this is especially true of the Sai Baba mandirs, which are crowded on Thursdays. Of course, there are many more religious places around, and some of them—temples, churches, mosques, etc.—may be well frequented, and large-scale religious events such as visits or performances (puja; ärti) of gurus, matas, or other (semi-) divine personalities occur quite regularly. In the preceding section, I have highlighted those places that are es-pecially well known for attracting visitors across the boundaries of reli-gious communities and that have a trans-local renown13—i.e. they are attended by people who travel to these sanctuaries, occasionally over greater distances in the city, and who may (or may not!) do their 'ordi-nary' worship at some local place in the vicinity of where they are living. The reader will have noted that most of these 'extraordinary'—or at any rate extraordinary well known and popular—places are linked to special timings such as festivals and fairs (Makhdum Fakih Ali Paru, Mount Mary, and many others) or, for the present discussion more importantly, to specific days of the week. Based on the foregoing, one may sketch the following weekly itinerary of a prototypical, extremely religiously in-clined Bombayite: Mondays to Babulnath, Tuesdays to Siddhivinayak and/or Mumbadevi, Wednesdays to St. Michael's, Thursdays to Haji Ali and/or a Sai Baba mandir, and Fridays to Mahalakshmi. Only the week-ends are conspicuously absent.14 12 See David, Bombay, p. 179. 13 Brief sketches of these and some other places, which according to my knowledge do not attract people from different communities in large numbers (such as the ISKCON Hare Krishna Temple, the Afghan Church, St. Thomas Cathedral, and the Jumma Mas-jid) can be accessed at http://www.mumbainet.com/travel/religious.htm (where they are grouped as \"Places of Worship in Mumbai\"). 14 Of course, this is not to stay that there are no rituals performed on Saturdays or Sundays. As to Sundays, one may well argue that one could certainly go to some church or the other, but as far as I know, the ordinary Sunday-services are far less popular than the 'special' services at St. Michael's and on Mount Mary. As to Saturdays, in certain periods, Maruti (Hanuman) is especially worshipped in his temples (on the so-called 'wealth-giving Saturdays'), see already R.E.

To begin with, the Iranshah fire-sanctuary now housed in a temple in the small village of Udvada, in Southern Gujarat,16 is some sort of a Parsi pilgrimage centre. There are a number of Parsi hotels and four guesthouses (dharamshalas) catering to the needs of the pilgrims. Furthermore, the second Atash Behram tem-ple, which was founded in Navsari in 1765,17 is held in great esteem, and so are the remaining six Atash Behram-temples, two of which are lo-cated in Surat, and four in Bombay. Apart from the pilgrimages to Ud-vada (and sometimes Navsari), often undertaken at specific days, which are regarded as auspicious for that regard, there is the idea of a visit to all eight—or, for Bombayites, all four—Atash Behrams in a row within a fixed span of time such as one day, or two days, during the festival dedi-cated to the spirits of the ancestors (muktad), or—in the case of Bom-bay—within one of the five daily gehs (watches of the day).18 Some Parsi travel agents offer organised trips to all eight Atash Behrams. The anniversary or 'birthday'-celebrations (salgireh) of the Atash Behram-fires are events that are celebrated on a grand scale, with thanksgiving services (yashan) and speeches held. These public events often attract several hundreds of devotees. Moreover, a good number of Parsis make it a point to visit the Atash Behram regularly for individual prayers. Another sanctuary, which is extremely popular among the Parsis, is the above-mentioned Bhikha Behram Well, named after its founder who had migrated from Broach in Gujarat to Bombay in 1715. The well was founded in 1725 as an act of thanksgiving. It is reported that some Mara-\"God of wind, Maruti, also called Hanuman, seems to evoke more devotion than any other\". In Bombay, the Maruti/hanuman-worship mostly takes place in smaller, local temples. 15 On these shrines see Robert Langer's paper in this volume. 16 On the history of this fire-sanctuary and its shifting locations see M. Stausberg, Die Religion Zarathushtras.

However, they did let him go when he showed his ritual garments, the shirt (sudreh) and the thread (kusti). Although it is pretty close to the sea, the well carries sweet water that is believed to contain blessings and to fulfil wishes. The present roof-structure was erected in 1954. The well may not be approached by non-Parsis,19 and whenever passing by I in-variably saw a number of devotees inside the precinct. It is reported that the well is visited by roughly 300 Parsis on 'auspicious' days, and on the 'birthday of the waters' (Ava mahino Ava roj) the number is reported to go into the thousands. The popularity of the well, which because of its structure comes pretty close to the idea of a 'shrine', may well have to do with its location in the vicinity of the main business and administrative district and Churchgate station, the starting point for many trains going to the suburbs. In this way, there is easy access to the well for Parsis travelling to the main city district. There are also some 'ordinary' (i.e., non-Atash Behram) fire-temples, which for the Parsis seem to be surrounded by a special aura, viz. a spiri-tual reputation that goes beyond the fact that these places are 'old' or 'well-maintained'. In Surat, the Goti Adarian which is located a little outside the city close to the Tapti River,20 seems to enjoy such a reputa-tion, and during two visits to Surat (in 1994 and 1997), several Parsis drew my attention to the special quality of this fire-temple (agiary) as a special resort when other avenues of solving crucial problems had failed. It seems that the Goti Adarian has more devotees attached to it than Su-rat's two Atash Behram-temples, and even people from Bombay make it a point to pay a visit to the Goti Adarian whenever they happen to be in Surat.21 In Bombay, currently there are two temples, which seem to be in-vested with a special aura that attracts especially many worshippers, al-beit necessarily Parsis only. These are the Aslaji Bhikhaji Agiary and the Banaji Atash Behram. However, whereas the Goti Adarian at Surat, at 19 However, Mrs Marfatia informs me (by e-mail) that \"a tank has been installed on the Churchgate side of the well which is meant for the use of non-Zoroastrians.\" 20 The literature provides contradictory information on the date when the fire was consecrated and the temple was built; see e.g. M.J. Giara, Global Directory ofZoroas-trian Fire Temples (Mumbai, 2002 (second edition)), p. 137. 21 I was also told that people from Nagpur (which has its own Agiary) have much faith in the fire-temple at Akola (Maharashtra) which houses a Dadgah-fire (i.e. a fire of the lowest category) consecrated in 1869 (date according to Giara, Global Directory of Zoroastrian Fire Temples, p. 67)."},{"pageNumber":670,"pageContent":"least as far as I am aware of, is not visited on any special days apart from the usual ones applying to all fire-temples—the 'birthday' (in this case Tir mahino Sarosh roj) and the days especially linked to fire (Adar roj, Ardibehesht roj, Behram roj, Sarosh roj)—, the two above-mentioned Bombay-temples are visited each on a particular day of the week: on Mondays (Banaji) and on Fridays (Aslaji) respectively. While this is somewhat unusual in view of the structure of the Zoroastrian calendar, where the concept of a week is irrelevant, this sort of behavioural pat-tern, which seems to be a genuine Bombay development, is much in line with the extraordinarily popular (non-Zoroastrian) sanctuaries introduced in the previous section of this paper. Hence, the visits to the Banaji (on Mondays) and the Aslaji (on Fridays) may be added to the weekly reli-gious itinerary of a pan-religious Parsi-Bombayite.

APPROACHING (THE STUDY OF) THE PLACES The above-mentioned events under scrutiny are not much liked by the spokesmen of the different schools presenting their version of 'Zoroas-trianism' .22 However, exactly because of their popularity both places and the ritual events taking place over there, attracted my attention ever since I accompanied my friends Rusi and Veera Khambatta to the Aslaji on what happened to be the festival in honour of Mithra (Meher mahino Meher roj) in March 1994. Long queues of worshippers were standing in the narrow lane outside the temple waiting for their turn to enter. In No-vember 1997 I made some further researches while in Bombay, includ-ing some preliminary interviewing. Finally, in 2000 I decided to take a closer look at what was going on at these places. Eventually, for reasons specified below, this investigation focused more on the Banaji than on the Aslaji. In this endeavour I was assisted by Mrs Zarin Marfatia, a married, (at the time of writing) 56 years old Parsi lady with one daughter living abroad. For several years, Mrs Marfatia had worked as Steno/Secretary and as a manager in a beauty parlour. In 1992 she obtained a Β A in history (as an external student from Mumbai's SNDT University), and in 2000 an 22 In Kreyenbroek/Munshi, Living Zoroastrianism, pp. 50-51, the events are classi-fied as \"Parsi Cults and Venerated Figures\".

Mrs Mar-fatia was (and still is) not a regular visitor to any of the places, and while she is clearly committed to and interested in her religion—witness her studies at the Madressa—she is not attached to any of the dominant 'schools' or 'movements' in contemporary Indian Zoroastrianism (such as 'neo-traditionalism', 'esotericism', 'orthodoxy', 'liberalism'). We basically worked on our project for a period of three weeks in September 2000, and for a further brief period of two weeks in Febru-ary/March 2002. Mrs Marfatia cleared the way with the relevant authori-ties that allowed us to study the places and to talk to the people on the spot.23 She also attended the places herself (where she would first per-form her own prayers) in order to observe what was going on. Moreover, Mrs Marfatia conducted two types of interviews, (a) A series of brief interviews, totalling 93, out of which 53 at the Banaji24 and 41 at the Aslaji.25 These interviews were mainly based on a short questionnaire comprising some ten questions.26 They were conducted on the spot—that is, mainly when people kept on arriving—and hence were not supposed to take more than five minutes (in order not to interfere too much with the devotees' routine).27 Moreover, Mrs Marfatia conducted (b) a num-ber of 12 structured in-depth-interviews (with 11 Parsis),28 which were 23 Mrs Marafatia wishes to express her gratitude to Ervad Nariman Panthaky who was very helpful to her throughout the interviews. 24 5 3% of the respondents at the Banaji were male. 25 5 6% of the respondents at the Aslaji were female. 26 One person was interviewed twice. The second interview was made in order to throw further light on some points made during the first session. The design of the ques-tionnaire was based on previous inquiries and available information. The wording was a joint product. It should be noted that our research started before Living Zoroastrianism by Kreyenbroek (and Mrs Munshi) was published. The core of this book consists of extended interviews with urban Parsis (all from Bombay). The interviews are set within a neo-traditionalist meta-frame. 27 At the Banaji, a serious limit to this method of recruitment was posed by the fact that it left out latecomers who would arrive just prior to the main event. This was be-cause, on the one hand, these people were generally not inclined to loose time in order to be interviewed and hence take the risk of missing what they've come for; on the other hand, Mrs Marfatia herself went inside and thus was prevented from meeting latecom-ers. At the Aslaji, these restrictions did not apply because there is no main event; people keep on arriving throughout the day. This, in turn, was a serious challenge to us, and was one of the factors that had led me to abandon the study of the Aslaji. 28 The main structure was the same as that used for the on-the-spot-interviews. How-ever, Mrs Marfatia was free to follow tracks of the conversation as it unfolded, and oc-casionally she made her own points and shared her own impressions."},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":"conducted at the interviewees' office or home. Most interviewees for that category (b) were contacted on the spot, and while the brief interview was conducted agreed to be interviewed again. That is why, in eight cases, there is an overlap between both categories. Among the 11 in-depth-interviews 8 are pertaining to the Banaji Atash Behram (with two also covering the Aslaji), while three are related to similar or historically akin places and events.29 Moreover, in relation to the Aslaji, Mrs Mar-fatia held three informal conversations (two of which with priests work-ing at this temple), which she subsequently put into notes. Hence, as to its representational rhetoric and the empirical material this study is based on, this paper results from a number of nested fram-ings of outsider-insider relationships: While the present writer is the in-sider to the reader, he is the outsider to Mrs Marfatia (who is the insider in terms of religious affiliation and ritual participation); Mrs Marfatia in turn is the outsider in relation to the insiders she was interviewing (i.e., the visitors to the places); during that process, however, she also became an insider and started to talk to people on these terms. During my several trips to Bombay, I repeatedly went to the respec-tive places. At the Banaji, at the time when the ritual event went on, I used to sit at a particular bench overlooking both entries to the temple and would try to count people as they came and went.30 This attracted a certain amount of curiosity. Invariably, people started to chat with me, and in this way, I was able to hear (and subsequently note down) some further stories and opinions about what was going on. As I did that three times in a row, I sort of became a regular feature of the scenario, and made friends with some attendees whom I would look forward to meet-ing again the next week. Some people offered their help in my work and supervised my counting (which almost everybody found a very odd thing to do). Occasionally, I also came to run into people whom I had met in other contexts such as in the reading room of the K.R. Cama Oriental Institute. During my second trip, my colleague Dr. Dorothea Lüddeck-ens, who had come to Bombay in order to study the funeral ceremonies of the Parsis,31 assisted me on the spot by also counting people. 29 These three interviews were not made use of for the present study. 30 Of course, it was out of the question that I entered the building.

THE ASLAJI The Aslaji Bhikhaji Agiary is a medium sized fire-temple in one of Bombay's most crowded and congested areas (Grant Road).32 It is lo-cated next to Shapur Baug, a small Parsi housing colony, which provides a primary clientele for the temple. Seth Aslaji Bhikaji—hence the name of the temple—had the fire consecrated and a first building erected in 1849 as a private place.33 The birthday of the fire is celebrated on Behram roz, Aspandad mahino.34 After Seth Aslaji Bhikaji's death, his wife transferred her rights to a Mr. Vakil who was her nephew as she had no issue.

He passed away in 1905 and the property was in-herited by his three sons, and they had it repaired in 1923. On March 15th, 1937 the Bombay High Court declared the hitherto private sanctu-ary a public institution and in that way it was deemed legal for the trus-tees to raise funds enabling them to have it repaired again in 1942. A floor on top of the old structure was added by the munificent donation of 32 Mrs Naju Panthaki, the wife of the priest in charge of the temple, has kindly com-mented upon the subsequent sections of this paper. (Not all her suggested modifications were incorporated though.) Mrs Panthaky was bom and brought up at the Aslaji. 33 Information provided by Mrs Panthaky who also stated that she had 'full faith' in the founder of the temple whom she referred to as 'Aslaji Bawa' (= 'father Aslaji' or 'respected Aslaj'; on the term bawa see also below). She said that she 'prays to him for family's health and happiness'. While I did find this ritual attachment to the founder of a temple somewhat unusual, Mrs Marfatia enlightened me that \"we [the Parsis] consider these departed souls as our benefactors and just as we remember our departed souls we add them to our list. For example my sister in law who stays in Cushrow Baug has a photo of Mr Wadia (the founder of Cushrow Baug), and often mentions gratitude to-wards his charities whereby the residents enjoy such pleasant homes. Similarly I often remember Bai Motlibai Wadia of Ν M Wadia Charities for the comfortable and beauti-ful home and surroundings enjoyed by us.\" 34 In 2003, this day corresponds to July 6lh. The panthaki, i.e., the priest who is in charge of the temple (since 1998, when his brother-in-law had passed away) explained to Mrs Marfatia that the fire is reinstalled every year on its birthday after the painting of the premises.

However, the main event is certainly Meher mahino Meher roj when the number of visitors easily goes into the thousands.37 The maximum, of course, is when Meher mahino Meher roj falls on a Friday. Meher Yazad and Shah Faridun These facts present somewhat of a puzzle, for neither the link of the Aslaji to the deity Mithra and the corresponding days in the Zoroastrian calendar, nor the link of the Aslaji to Fridays—or the corresponding connection between Mithra and Fridays—-have found a satisfactory ex-planation yet. For the devotees, to be sure, these links present rather a matter of fact, but nothing much to worry, bother, or reflect about. Both links, it seems, are of an indirect kind; they are created via the figure of the mythical hero Shah Faridun. During her visit to the Aslaji on September 14th, 2000, it was reported to Mrs Marfatia that the site of the temple had been \"a desert area until the footsteps of Shah Faridun descended upon the place, [and] he lid a diva [oil-lamp] of milk.\"38 Moreover, the managing priest (panthaki) of the Aslaji explained to Mrs Marfatia (also on September 14th, 2000) that the temple houses a locked 35 Information provided by Mrs Panthaky (based on trust deeds).

Unfortunately, I was only once in Bombay when that festival occurred. This is another reason why I decided not to follow up the study of the Aslaji and to focus on the Banaji instead. 38 Other respondents, however, who came to know about that legend in the course of the research-process did not know about that legend and disliked the idea of it."},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"wooden box containing silver portraits of 'Kukadaru Saheb'39 and Shah Faridun.40 It almost seems as if these silver pictures—just as reliquaries in shrines—are the storehouse of the miraculous powers attributed to the Aslaji, which is by some regarded as the mythical place. While there is no apparent connection between Kukadaru Saheb and Mithra/Fridays, there are some traces leading from Shah Faridun to Mithra. The history of the figure that eventually became 'Shah Faridun' goes back all the way to the Indo-European past and Avestan texts in which he appears as Thraëtaona, the son of Athbiia, the second mortal to press Haoma. Hence, the figure is part of the priestly tradition. Thraëtaona, the most victorious of the victorious (varaOrauuanan^m V9ra0rauuastamö) apart from Zarathushtra, is renowned for having slain the powerful dragon Azi Dahäka (Yt. 19,36-37). For that purpose, the heroic Thraëtaona used a victorious weapon (Yt. 19,92). According to the later traditions, also vividly remembered by Zoroastrians, Thraëtaona, now under the Middle and New Persian names of Frëdôn and Faridun respec-tively, is reported to have chained the dragon (now as Zohäk) onto Mount Demawand. The structural link between Thraëtaona and Mithra—a mortal and a deity—is made explicit in that both captured the charisma (xvaranah-) when it left Yima: Mithra captured it when it first left Yima, and when it went away for the second time, it was captured by Thraëtaona (Yt. 19,35-36). Moreover, there are some traces of common ancient poetic traditions related to the killing of the dragon.41 With some other protagonists of the divine both share the attribute, or epithet, of being 'victorious'; both are related to the slaying of the dragon, ex-pressed with the Avestan word jan- (derived from the root *ghren-)—in the case of Mithra, however, it is VaraOragna, flying in front of Mithra, who does the striking and smashing (Yt. 10,70-71)—; both carry a weapon for this purpose, Mithra his \"beautiful and easily brandished mace\" (Yt. 10,131 )42 that he is holding in his hand (Yt. 10,96) and with 39 'Dastur' Jamshedji S. Kukadaru (1831-1900) was a priest who has become famous for his pure lifestyle and the miraculous powers of his prayers. There are popular bust portraits of his. These, it seems, are believed to transport some of his 'manthric' powers. 40 Moreover, there are painted tiles of Dastur Kukadaru, Shah Faridun and Zara-thushtra on the way to the well. 41 See the comprehensive study by C. Watkins, How to Kill a Dragon. Aspects of Indo-European Poetics (Oxford/New York, 1995). 42 The translation is Gershevitch's, see I. Gershevitch, The Avestan Hymn to Mithra.

The link between the Aslaji, Shah Faridun, and the days and festival dedicated to Mithra (Mehr) thus seems to be founded on a long tradition and gains a certain plausibility when read in the light of a traditional his-43 On the etymological connections between the words referring to Mithra's (vazra-) and Thraëtaona's (vaddm) weapons respectively, see Watkins, How to Kill a Dragon, p. 332. 44 In the case of Thraêtaona the link to the priesthood is provided by the fact that he is the son of the mythical second haoma-presser. 45 The link between this mace and Mithra is made by J.J.

In an almost apodictic fashion, the point was confirmed by one respondent, Mr JB (62), who regularly has visited the Aslaji since 25 years, when he stated: \"On Meher roj if you ask for help from Shah Faridoon it is given.\" As many other visitors, he did experi-ence that help in his own life (in his case by his dog recovering from a critical illness). A 25-year-old lady reported that she was looking out for, and did eventually get, a job—a fact she ascribes to \"Meher Yazad's help.\" She also remarked: \"Somehow or other if we ask for something we always get it.\" The connection of the temple (Agiary) to the Fridays seems some-what more difficult to reconstruct, though. It is said that Faridun, or Shah Faridun as he is now referred to, did kill many demons and hence was clearly attributed powers that could be made use of in other con-texts. The 9th Century priest-theologian Zâdspram in passing matter-of-factly mentions that Frëdôn (Faridun) is summoned to remove those who inflict harm [32,3]. Moreover, two Persian Reväyat witness the fact that the hero was held to be a powerful fighter against diseases, and they rec-ommend the performance of a Yasna in the name of Faridun in order to avoid pestilence or remove sickness.50 Occasionally, the name of Faridun is also referred to in certain 'man-thric' formulae ('spells'; 'incantations'), the so-called nërang (nirang), e.g. in spells against fever and a spell for health (in manuscript Κ 27).51 In Middle Persian, the word nërang also refers to 'ritual' in general. For New Persian, the meaning of the word nirang is (by Steingass and oth-ers) given as 'fascination', 'incantation', 'magic', 'sorcery', 'deceit', etc. In this sense it corresponds to the word afsun (Middle Persian afsön), also signifying 'spell', 'incantation', and 'fascination'. Hence, it does not come as much of a surprise when we find amongst the Parsis a short prayer known as Afsun-e Shah Faridun, or, in a pleonastic, semi Persian, semi Gujarati fashion, as Afsun-e Shah Faridun-ni nirang (lit. Spell of Shah Faridun's Incantation). Today, this prayer is contained in small booklets (in Gujarati and English letters), which usually also contain some other prayers considered to be efficacious.52 These booklets are 50 See B.N. Dhabhar, The Persian Rivayats of Hormazyar Framarz and Others. Their Version with Introduction and Notes (Bombay, 1932), pp. 278-279. 51 See J. Hampel, Die Kopenhagener Handschrift Cod. 27.

One of these booklets praises the Afsun-e Shah Faridun-ni nirang in the following terms: Shah Faridun's Nirang helps to ward away evil spirits, black magic and the bad stars of our horoscope and helps us in giving us good health, our daily bread and fulfil our wishes. This prayer should be prayed sincerely and full faith & time alone will show the power & force of this prayer.53 Hence, side by side with the promise of the prayer's efficaciousness, the text also anticipates an explanation for any eventual failure (= lack of 'full faith' and 'time'). However, there are plenty of reports about the prayer having the desired effects.54 The history of the prayer is not entirely clear. It seems not to be part of 19th century prayer books, but in 1931, along with another Shah Faridun Nirang, which is meant to be written and carried as an amulet, it is printed in a book entitled Pâzand Nirang bä mäeni by Ervad Phiroze Shapur Masani, a prominent spokesperson ofthe 'esoteric' or 'mystical' movement known as Ilm-e Khshnoom,55 Ervad Dr. Ramiyar Karanjia who has drawn my attention to this publication also informs me (by e-mail) that it has been stated that Faridun was taught these Afsun by saintly men in the Alburz mountains when he was brought up there.56 We are also told that he used these Afsun in his life at different occasions like when he saw a boul-der tumbling and coming towards him or when he wanted to cross the river Jahun to go to Zohak's palace. the 101 Names of Dadar Ahura Mazda, Byram Yazad Nirang, Shah Faridun's Nirang, a Nirang for Desiring Health, a Nirang to bring fulfilment of desires, Setayash-I-Shaherevar, and the Khudavind ο Khavind Monajat. 53 Byram Yazad, Shah Faridun ni Nirang & Murad bar Lawani Bandagi, pp. 12-14.

So for three days, at a certain time only, and on certain days only, you had to say the whole prayer, and recite that long prayer for three days at a fixed time. And I must say that it has healed him.\" 55 On this movement and Masani see Stausberg, Die Religion Zarathushtras, vol. 2, pp. 118-124. 56 Probably, this tradition belongs to 'Ilm-e Khshnoom' as well."},{"pageNumber":679,"pageContent":"Oral traditions pertaining to that spell seem to go back roughly to the same period when it was first printed in Masani's book (1931). There is the example of a lady, born in a small village in 1935 where her father was acting as a practicing priest: When she was small, her father taught her Shah Faridun's Nirang.57 Interestingly, at the same period the spell was also used in Iran. Teheran's Mobed Mehraban Firouzgary informs me (by e-mail): \"I remember that my own mother prayed it for my younger sister, some 65 years back, when she was seriously ill.\" It should be pointed out that all these testimonies—both from oral histories and the printed book—come from priestly circles.58 The very idea of the special powers of Shah Faridun is, as we have seen above, firmly grounded in ancient priestly traditions as well. Nowadays, in Iran, the prayer seems to have come out of use; Mobed Firouzgary notes: \"I can say that since then it has been hardly used and [it] has been removed from all the recent Prayer books knowing that our religion does not allow mere superstitions.\"59 In India, however, it is still very much alive. In ritual practice, the Afsun-e Shah Faridun-ni nirang often goes along with prayers to the 'victorious' and 'successful' deity Behram (Behram Yazad; Avestan Vsrsthragna). Behram is one ofthe favourite divine beings (yazad) of contemporary Parsis,60 and these prayers cater for similar, if not the very same needs. Apart from specific prayers, such as the Behram Yasht and a short formula (nirang) linked to it, there is a ritual event called the Mushkel Aasan (Behram Yazad),61 which is gen-erally held on the day named after that divinity (Behram roj) and on Fri-days (or on Tuesdays). It is precisely this timing that, together with the structural and functional connection of Shah Faridun to Behram Yazad, may possibly if not 'explain', so at least give a glimpse of why the Aslaji is popular on Fridays. Thus, with its connections both to Meher Yazad 57 \"Mrs A\": Kreyenbroek/Munshi, Living Zoroastrianism, p. 95. 58 See also Boyce, A Persian Stronghold of Zoroastrianism, p. 63: \"...

While the fact that a silver portrait of Shah Faridun is stored inside the temple was mentioned to Mrs Marfatia by the managing priest, at least one of our respondents created a link between the special powers of Shah Faridun and the Aslaji by referring to the temple-well. Mr JKS, a pious 76-year-old gentleman who since his childhood daily visits the Aslaji where he prays for three hours—he also visits the Wadiaji Atash Behram \"365 days a year\", as he stated, and occasionally another temple as well—, casually remarked that Shah Faridun had been praying at the well.62 Furthermore, Mrs GW, a very religiously inclined lady (63) who visits all major fire-temples on their 'birthdays'63 and regularly goes to the Aslaji on Fridays (previously also on every Meher roj),64 stated, when Mrs Marfatia asked her about the association of Fridays with the Aslaji: 62 He also mentions that he is generally asked by friends and family-members to offer sandalwood to the fire on their behalf. 63 She prays twice a day and that takes her about 2 hours. While praying, she usually neither talks nor answers the phone. Moreover, she visits her local fire-temple at least twice a week, sometimes also 4-6 times a week. She does the Mushkel Aasan on Fri-days, has an oil-lamp (diva) lit throughout the day, takes incense (loban) around the house \"and we put sandalwood over it also and pray the Atash Nyaish\" [= the praise to the fire]. She sends sandalwood to the Iranshah fire-temple at Udvada on every Behram roj. \"I make the payment for the whole year to be placed on Behram roj every month.... My cousin goes every month so I give her the money for the whole year to be put on Behram roj and recently my son also did 12 Behram roj. ... he would come from Ah-medabad and would return the next day. He would not come here (Mumbai), he would return directly from there. And even when he was here if it fell on a Sunday he would go without fail on Behram roj.\" 64 When visiting the Aslaji on Meher roj she does the following: \"this I offer on Me-her Roj, 33 sandalwood sticks for 33 Farishtas ['angels']. ... And 2 sandalwood sticks one for the Dadgah fire and one after praying the Atash Nyaish I offer to the fire seeking blessings. [Mrs Marfatia asks: After reciting the Atash Nyaish?] Whatever I had to offer I first put, but we follow this system of holding one piece of sandalwood in hand whilst praying the Atash Nyaish and after completing it offer to the fire. If we have prayed the Atash Nyaish we have to offer something. We get their blessings, what else do we re-quire, we get their blessings, that's all.\""},{"pageNumber":681,"pageContent":"I do not know but it is believed that on Fridays at the well there is Pariya-mai. There is a tree there; we used to believe in it so we used to go there. And there is power (sat) in the tree and it was said that going there on Fri-days is good so we used to go on Fridays. And Friday is also the day associ-ated with Mushkel Aasan so one goes to any temple (agiary). So one goes to any temple. So earlier, as I was able to go, [I thought that] then I may as well go there [= to the Aslaji], This statement confirms the hypothesis that the popularity of Fridays may have to do with the Mushkel Aasan (via the link Shah Faridun/ Bah-ram Yazad) and it also introduces two further elements: the tree65 and the well. The idea that there is power (sat, lit. 'truth') in a tree—also the power contained in an amulet is referred to as sat—seems to imply that there is some sort of a divine being residing in it and providing special force to the tree, which is mostly applied for healing purposes. While our interviewee does not specify what sort of power is associated with the tree, in the case of the well she mentions the presence, weekly on Fridays, of a pariyamai. As Ervad Dr. Ramiyar Karanjia informs me, a Pariyamai is usually considered to be \"a benign feminine divine being\" generally thought to reside in a well. The word pariyamai is a composite consisting of the words mai (Guj.) meaning 'mother', but also used as a suffix of endearment and expressing respect, and pariya. This word ex-presses affection for the pari, a word that both in Gujarati and Persian de-notes a 'fairy', who, in this case, is clearly a positive being having nothing or little to do with the witches or she-demons of Zoroastrian scriptures sharing the same semantic root (Middle Persian parïg, Avestan parika). 66In the form 'Shah Pari', known from Iran,pari can also be seen as an abbreviation for 'Paridun' (= Shah Faridun).67 Hence, a different explana-tion ofthe word may be considered, according to which the pariyamai is a female 'relative' of Shah Faridun ('dear Pari-mother'), just as Iranian Zo-65 See also Mrs X (born in 1935) in Kreyenbroek, Living Zoroastrianism, p. 210 re-ferring to the Aslaji: \"And there are Parsis praying to the peepul tree also\". She con-nects that to \"a Hindu belief because Shiva is supposed to be in the peepul tree.\" 66 While the Pari are negative beings in the Zoroastrian scriptures, in Classical Per-sian literature and modern Iranian folklore, they are often presented as being of a friendly nature; they are considered as beautiful, able to fly and they often help the hu-mans; see M. Omidsalar, \"Peri (Pari)\", Enzylopädie des Märchens, vol. 10, 2002, pp. 744-746. 67 This, at least, is attested from Iran, see Boyce, A Persian Stronghold of Zoroas-trianism, p. 63. Boyce also reports that the village women \"were positive that Shah Pari was male\"."},{"pageNumber":682,"pageContent":"roastrians know the mysterious figure(s) of the 'daughter(s) of Shah-Pari' (= Faridun), held to be very powerful (and dangerous at night). Signifi-cantly, some Iranian Zoroastrian houses of Yazd have special rooms re-served for these beings—and these rooms are invariably connected to the main source of water supply of the respective house,68 just as the Pariya-mai at Aslaji is believed to be located in the temple-well. Indirectly, then, the Pariyamai possibly brings us back to Shah Faridun. Visitors and visits Just as the Afsun-e Shah Faridun-ni nirang is attested since at least 72 years—possibly it is much older—visits to the Aslaji on the dates tuned to Meher Yazad and Shah Faridun are equally well-established tradi-tions. Among our respondents, apart from persons going to the temple, often daily, since their childhood—partly because it is their 'regular' temple and they are staying close by (e.g., in Shapur Baug)—, there are others who attend the Aslaji on the specific dates since several decades. By way of example, the 63 years old lady quoted above with her state-ment referring to the Pariyamai residing inside the well,69 mentioned that 68 For an example, see Robert Langer's contribution to this volume with plate XIII/6. 69 Also in other respects, water is a key element in her religious practice: When the month devoted to the Waters comes, for 40 days she used to visit a particular temple in order to pray the Ava Yasht there. (She has also started to recite the Behram Yasht which she feels is rather a challenging practice: \"I also pray the Bahman Yasht in Bah-man Mah for 40 days but when praying this no word should be mispronounced and every word should be properly recited without interruption, then your prayer breaks. So when I pray it I lock the bedroom and pray inside and do not answer anyone, however much they knock. [Mrs Marfatia asks: Why only for Bahman Yasht and not other Yashts?] They say that you should pray with good attention otherwise it should not be prayed. Otherwise adverse effect can take place. Somebody told me so, otherwise I do not know. And even for Behram Yasht if you pray at one time at one place it has a bet-ter effect. ... So at around 10.30 or so I lock the room and start the a/c so I can pray slowly and peacefully. But in Behram Yasht if you get up, talk, then it is totally useless. But that also I am not able to do, sometimes I start to do 40 (Behram Yasht), but can do only for 14 days, sometimes 20 days, sometimes even one day is left and it is broken.\") This is how she describes her visits to a local fire-temple: \"The buoy ceremony is done at 6.15,6.20, when it is very dark, the ceremony is done at even 6.30 or 7am, but now it is early. Then I am there for about two hours, go to the well, light the divas, light the diva at the well, I pray the Ava Ardvisur at the well, at home I take some water in a glass and pray the Ava Yasht.\" She is also involved in practices making use of water that is blessed because Mrs Nergish Aibara—Mrs GW refers to her as \"aunty\"—who is held to possess special powers has prayed over it. She explains the practice in the fol-lowing terms: \"we fill the water bottles and take from home and at night time before"},{"pageNumber":683,"pageContent":"she visits the temple \"since the last 40 years, or whenever in town\" (she stays in a suburb, and it must take her at least one hour to reach the Aslaji).70 When asked if she remembered how it came that she started to go to the Aslaji, Mrs GW replied: No, nothing particular, but people used to believe and go there to [the] Aslaji, they used to talk, so even I felt like going there and I started going. I was spiritually inspired. Hence, even 40 years back, it seems that the Aslaji had a certain reputa-tion, and one further respondent, Mrs KKB (59)71 mentioned that she, time permitting, comes to the Aslaji on every Meher roj and on most Fridays since her earliest childhood. As a child Mrs KKB used to live in Shapur Baug, the Parsi residential colony next to the Aslaji. Her family would have rituals performed there and she has very pleasant memories of the temple. Mrs KKB reported that until about 55 years ago the tem-ple was a quiet place mostly attended by the Shapur Baug tenants, but that it afterwards became popular thanks to the efforts of the then man-aging priest(s) and that then the rumour started spreading that one's problems would be solved if one went to the Aslaji on Fridays or on a Meher roj. going to sleep we have to take two drops of water from the bottle and recite 2 Yathas and 1 Ashem, drink the water and then go to sleep. She [= Mrs Aibara] gives it to help during problems. It is a matter of faith. Some have some problems, others have other problems. We have been doing this every day since years. My husband has been having health problems since years and she used to give it for him. Once she mentioned that 'you come for him so often and get prayers said for your husband, why do you not get water for yourself, why did you not tell me? Next time when you come bring water for yourself also, I will pray over it. ' Sometime back my elder brother-in-law was operated upon and his health was deteriorating, his pressure was falling down, there was some problem with his hands and legs, there were other problems, his lungs also was giving problem, so I asked her and she said 'generally his health will go on like this but he will recover and come home'. So whenever there is some problem we ask her questions.\" They need to go there every 40 days in order to change the water or for prayers. It should be remembered that Mrs GW suffers from a serious leg problem. 70 She adds that because of a leg problem since three years she discontinued going of Fridays and now she goes on every Meher roj instead. Her husband always accompanies her, and so does her son whenever he is in Bombay (he lives in Ahmedabad). Her leg problem prevents her from visiting other temples where she has to climb too many stairs. 71 Mrs KKB has made a very successful career in the legal profession. She does not attend any other temples, but has a (female) guru by the name of Mrs Kamla Diwan who reportedly has Durga Mata's blessings within her. Mrs KKB related incidents of what she perceives to be miraculous help that she has experienced thanks to her guru."},{"pageNumber":684,"pageContent":"While there were few people among our respondents who would re-call the early days of the 'Aslaji-boom', there are some who are visiting the temple since a considerable span of time. One lady, Mrs AP, also residing in a suburb and with her 60 years belonging to the same age group as Mrs GW and Mrs KKB stated that she comes to the Aslaji on every Meher roj and on every Behram roj since 32 years. Mrs FN (67) and her husband attend the Aslaji always on Meher roj since over 30 years.72 Mr JB, a 62-year-old gentleman—who thus belongs to the same age-group—remarked that he comes to the Aslaji since 25 years \"when-ever time permits\". Mr NM, a gentleman who is slightly younger (53) said that he came to the Aslaji on Fridays since 20 years. A lady, Mrs. MW, 54 years old and also residing in a suburb remarked that she always comes on Fridays and Meher roj since 16 years, and a gentleman who is 63 years old said that he comes on all Fridays and always on Meher roj since 15 years. These reports may create the impression that visits to the Aslaji are basically an old peoples' pastime. However, this is far from true. While I did not execute any demographic survey and every selection of respon-dents is necessarily subjective and accidental, among the people who accepted Mrs Marfatia's invitation to share their experiences there was a good number of younger people: all in all 9 (= 22,5%)73 of the respon-dents belonged to the age-group of below 29—a vast majority of them being females (7 females/2 males) —, and 6 from the age-group of 30-44, equally divided according to gender. All respondents belonging to the latter age cohort turned out to be regular visitors, most of them at-tending since 4-6 years, one lady since 10 and another one since more than 20 years; the shortest span of time was given as one and a half years (a lady of 32 who since one and a half years always comes on Fridays and occasionally on Meher roj as well74). Among the younger people, three said that they were always coming since their childhood—a lady of 25 who since 5 years always comes on Fridays mentioned that her par-72 They were encouraged to do so by Mrs FN's mother-in-law. 73 Here and in the following percentages do not claim any statistical probability or precision (the size and nature of our sample preclude any such conclusions); percent-ages are just given in order to help the reader to grasp the size of the fractions con-cerned. 74 She remarked that her husband used to accompany her to the Aslaji but waited out-side while she went inside.

Among the 41 respondents, just two persons were new arrivals on the scene: One gentleman (53) had come for the second time and because he experienced miraculous help in connection with the Aslaji he is likely to become a regular, while a lady of 26—a lawyer by profession who lives in a suburb—who had also come for the second time was not at all happy with her experience. While she had been put off by the crowds during her first visit, the second visit did not give her more satisfaction; she stated that she did \"definitely not feel attracted because [she] did not get peace of mind or spiritual upliftment, though it was better than last time but not as well as experienced elsewhere.\" Hence she will likely drop out again. Apart from these two persons and a lady of 51 years, who said that she comes just \"occasionally\", all the remaining respon-dents claimed to be regular visitors (attending either on a daily basis, or coming on Fridays or/and Meher roj or/and Meher mahino Meher roj).76 30% of the respondents who provided information on that topic77 come there alone, while the majority is joined by other family members. 30% of the respondents come together with their respective spouse (or fiancé)—most of them regularly—, and almost as many come with their children or parents, while some others are accompanied by their sibling. Some of the regular visitors explicitly stated that they come in order to accompany somebody (e.g., the mother). Among 18 respondents who commented on that issue, four persons— three of them belonging to the youngest age cohort—said that it wouldn't matter if they for some reason or the other were unable to at-tend. Many others, however, expressed sentiments of attachments that make their regular attendance definitely appear as more than a simple habit. One lady who is a regular on Fridays said to \"consider [it a] duty to go every Friday, if possible, even if not well\". Several respondents stated that they \"feel bad\" if they can't attend. Others said to feel \"missed out\", or that there was \"something lacking\". If it does happen, a gentleman said that he asks for forgiveness. Others have strategies of compensation: They go on the next day, a Behram roj or any other day to \"make it up\", or ask somebody else to put sandalwood on their behalf.

Without a single exception, all our respondents said that they are praying on a daily basis, most of them once or twice a day—with two people (a girl of 14 and a lady of 21) praying thrice, and one lady, Mrs AP (60 years), four times a day.78 Most respondents guessed that they spend about 15 to 30 minutes on prayers every day—again with some exceptions (all of them among the more aged): 5 persons stated to pray for at least one hour, but some considerably longer, the extremes going into two and three hours. Most (but not all) of the persons who invest much time into prayers are also those who are long-time regulars. Out of the 31 persons providing information on this topic, 10 stated to spend 15 minutes inside the Aslaji. This would be roughly the time needed to do one 'full visit', including the purification, preparatory prayers, and the visit to the fire with the offering and the prayer. 9 per-sons said that they stayed there for 25 minutes to half an hour, two spend 45 minutes inside the temple, and three persons more than one hour (one of them a full three hours!). Among the 41 respondents who were interviewed on three Fridays in September 2000 and March 2002, 5 stated that they are not frequenting any other fire-temple, but most persons visit several temples. In other words: For almost 90% of the respondents, the Aslaji is an important in-gredient in a cluster of several Zoroastrian fire-temples, which they usually attend. Apart from the Aslaji many respondents reported that they visit the oldest Atash Behram fire-temple, the Iranshah, which is located some hours north of Bombay; more often than not the Iranshah is mentioned alongside one or several of the Atash Behram-temples in Bombay—the Wadiaji most frequently—and one or several of the local temples. More than half of our respondents—24 out of 41 persons79— positively stated that they also visit non-Zoroastrian sanctuaries.80 By far the most popular places are those relating to the Sai Baba of Shirdi.81 8 out of our 41 respondents (= 19%) have been to the Sai Baba sanctuary at Shirdi, and some go there regularly.82 Five respondents (12%) visit 78 One person did not provide any information. 79 One informant did not provide any information on that topic. 80 One lady of 37 who comes to the Aslaji since 6 years but does not go to other fire-temples remarked that her \"whole family was used to going to all sorts of places.\" 81 Only one respondent did refer to the Sathya Sai Baba. 82 One respondent, a gentleman of 53 who comes to the Aslaji since 20 years, re-"},{"pageNumber":687,"pageContent":"one ofthe Sai Baba Mandirs in Bombay. In this connection, it should be noted that the city's most prominent Sai Baba Mandir, called Sai-Dham, is in the close vicinity ofthe Aslaji, and at least one lady, a long time Friday and Meher roj regular to the Aslaji, explicitly stated that she goes to the mandir any time she visits the fire-temple. Five persons (12%) stated that they go to St. Michael's church, some occasionally, others regularly. Furthermore six persons (15%)—five of them ladies (the youngest being 37 years old)—remarked that they go to Mount Mary, some of them regularly. 'Hindu' places were listed comparatively less often—two persons (5%) mentioned the Siddhi Vinayak temple—, and there is a conspicuous absence of Muslim shrines. As far as I can see, there is no significant correlation between visits to those extraordinary popular sanctuaries on the one hand and gender or age on the other. One thing that emerges, though, is that out of the 9 re-spondents who reported that they pray for more than half an hour daily, just one attends non-Zoroastrian places.83 However, the nature of the cause-effect relation is not clear here: Are they just too consumed up by their own religion for being able to invest any time in visits to other places? Or are they just happy with their religion and spend so much time with it for this reason? Or have they not discovered yet that there are other worlds to explore as well? Our material just doesn't permit any conclusions—not even a well-founded hypothesis. A further guess—-for methodological reasons it would be exaggerated to call it a hypothesis—is that at least some of the people who don't visit any non-Zoroastrian places may experience (or have experienced) at the Aslaji what others are seeking in different contexts. As a matter of fact, apart from a general 'faith' in (the power of) the Aslaji, or devotional benefits such as a 'good feeling', 'peace', 'that kind of peace', 'peace of mind', 'spiritual upliftment', or just the 'feeling to go there', which were given by the majority of the respondents—26 out of 3984—as important factors drawing them to the temple, more than half of the respondents (24) said that they come to the Aslaji in connection to 'extraordinary' experiences such as supernatural help (15), miracles (10), the fulfillment of wishes (3) or the 'asking for blessings', the latter explicitly described ported to get 'callings' to go to Shirdi. 83 However, among those who pray for half an hour (and, hence, longer than most others), several go to 'other' places. 84 Three persons did not comment on this topic."},{"pageNumber":688,"pageContent":"by the respective interviewee as \"a little selfish attitude\".85 Two persons commented on this issue by declaring that they come as an act of thanks-giving or \"for well-being\" (a gentleman of 66 coming daily since 7 years). While there seems to be a general tendency for respondents from the upper age group to ignore the 'special benefits' in favour of the more devotional factors, this can probably not be made a general rule. There is little variation as to gender, with slightly more women (13) mentioning 'special benefits' than men (11). However, two ladies (but not a single man) remarked that they did not find the Aslaji especially beneficial. While some respondents chose rather general expressions such as \"wishes [are] fulfilled if [you have] faith in the Aslaji\", \"wishes [are] granted\", a \"wish [made] with sincerity gets fulfilled\", \"in every way always helped\", \"in every way [I] feel better about everything\", or that they \"feel prayers [are getting] answered\", others are reporting specific instances of divine assistance that they attribute to (their visits to) the Aslaji. In one case, the successful recovery from a heart attack (a lady of 45) was attributed to the Aslaji.86 In some cases, these concern financial matters and general success in economic life such as obtaining a satisfy-ing job (both for oneself or for other family members) or improvement in housing. Some other respondents mentioned bliss in family life: one lady mentioned that (unspecified) family-problems were resolved after she started to go to the Aslaji—initially she was advised to attend 9 consecu-tive Fridays making it some sort of a Parsi novena—and she also said to have become much more religious than before; one gentleman ascribed the fact that he has a happy family with two girls doing well and being married to Parsis to the beneficial power of the Aslaji. One lady—the one who attends at the request of her daughter who migrated to Austra-lia—gave the following example of a 'miracle' that she had witnessed in connection to the Aslaji: a son of hers was \"moving around with a non-Parsi girl, but now is married to a Parsi.\" 85 Several people mentioned more than one of these key-terms. 86 See also the interview with Mrs X (born in 1935) in Kreyenbroek, Living Zoroas-trianism, p. 210: [Question:] \"Do you go to the Aslaji on Meher mahino Meher roj? No, but since the last three months I have done it for my daughter's health, and there is an improvement!\" It should be added that Meher mahino Meher roj occurs only once a year. Hence, when Mrs X states to go there 'since the last three months', probably this refers to her going to the Aslaji on Fridays or on Meher roj."},{"pageNumber":689,"pageContent":"Jalbhai During the last decade or so, the miraculous power of the Aslaji has seen a further development in that it has 'incarnated' in the figure of a gen-tleman by the name of Jal Mistry, whom our respondents more often than not referred to as 'Jal uncle' or 'Jalbhai'. This elderly gentleman (who kindly answered some of our questions but did not want to be for-mally interviewed) generally makes himself available at the Aslaji from 4pm to 8.30pm. As Mrs Marfatia witnessed, people queue up in order to seek his help, guidance, or advice. At 8pm on one Friday, Mrs Marfatia saw around 15 persons queuing up for him. From the remarks of one respondent it emerges that one occasionally has to wait for more than half an hour before one's turn comes. Jal Mistry feels to be blessed by Hormazd (Ahura Mazda) and the 'holy fire', and that this blessing confers upon himself the ability to help people. In general terms, 'Jalbhai' advises to pray \"with good conscious-ness\"—even if it should be the bare minimum—and to wear decent clothes (including the sudreh and kusti87). From Mrs Marfatia's description it seems that 'Jal uncle' gets inspira-tion from the fire, or creates a link between the persons and (the powers of) the fire. People queue for him near the lesser consecrated fire, the Dädgäh, where 'Jalbhai' listens to their problems. He then proceeds to the second-grade consecrated fire, the Ädarän, which is located on the opposite side of the inner room. There he prays, only to return some time later in order to give advice to the people concerned. As Mrs Marfatia observed, he also took the photographs of people, for whom others sought help, to the presence of the fire, where he held his hands over the face of the person on the photo and prayed. In this way he obtained \"di-vine, spiritual guidance\", as he explained to Mrs Marfatia. Some respon-dents also mentioned that they get water blessed by 'Jal uncle' to be ap-plied at home. It was also reported that he 'gave prayers' to be recited and recommended to burn incense-sticks (agarbatties). 'Jalbhai' also visits hospitals or homes where he attends the sick and aged in order to help them. This is why he does not come to the Aslaji daily. 87 To Mrs Marfatia he related the incident of refusing to speak to a lady who had come to the temple without her ritual garments; he asked her to leave the temple (in-cluding the outer premises) immediately."},{"pageNumber":690,"pageContent":"Exactly half of our responds—20 out of 40 who commented on this issue—was aware of ' Jalbhai', while the other half was obviously not. Among those who were, apart from one lady of 27, who had come to the Aslaji for the first time and who expressed doubt and even commented about a \"nasty incident\" that she claimed to have happened with a friend of her, most reported overwhelmingly positive experiences. Four re-spondents—including a priest working at the temple—reported to 'take his blessings'. Some further respondents mentioned special benefits that they experienced as a result of Jal Mistry's intervention. Some men-tioned problems with jobs, others with health, which were resolved thanks to 'Jal uncle'. One lady who is a Friday and Meher roj regular in detail reported several 'miraculous' incidents related to children, and a couple told the story about the way they, thanks to the help extended by 'Jal uncle', had been able to retrace and re-establish ties to their son who had 'disappeared' for some time to another city. One further interviewee also related the incident both of a missing person—this time an aunt— and of a missing item; both were retraced exactly as predicted by Jal Mistry. There will certainly be many more stories to be told by people who have gratefully experienced what they perceive to be Jal Mistry's help. 'Jalbhai' is not the first pious old man who was apparently able to ex-tend divine ('miraculous') 'help' to people requiring that sort of divine intervention88—and in view of the frail living-conditions in Bombay it hardly comes as a surprise that many people are in need of'special' help. Moreover, by giving blessings and prayers, Mr Mistry provides services of the type which otherwise could be sought from priests, but which is actually provided by few members of the priestly class. Although he is well aware of the power of his blessings and prayers, Jal Mistry states that these powers ultimately derive from Hormazd and the fire; actually, he seems much too modest a person for claiming the status of a ([semi-] 89 divine) 'Baba'. Interestingly, 'Jalbhai' presents himself at the Aslaji 88 When I visited the late Behram Pithawala in Bombay in November 1997,1 found some persons around telling me that they were coming regularly for Mr Pithawala who had helped them through his prayers and his astrological counselling. (For Behram Pithawala see the interview in Kreyenbroek, Living Zoroastrianism, pp. 246-253 where this aspect of his activity is not touched upon). The prayers given by the late Ervad Nadersha Navroji Aibara and his wife Nergishbanoo were/are also perceived as very efficacious. 89 This is why I find it biased and inappropriate that he is classified as a 'Baba' who has \"rapidly acquired a relatively large following\" by Kreyenbroek, Living Zoroastrian-ism, p. 51."},{"pageNumber":691,"pageContent":"each Friday, and his appearance can be seen to be an extension of the spiritual presence and efficacy of Shah Faridun who in turn is linked to Meher Yazad. THE BANAJI For some people, the fact that Mr Mistry carries the name of 'Jal' links his appearance to the emergence of a ritual event that had started to take place at the Banaji fire-temple some years earlier. It seems entirely justi-fied to refer to what goes on at the Banaji as a (public) 'event'90 for con-trary to the Aslaji, where people (can) come anytime at a Friday or/and Meher roj, most visitors to the Banaji make it a point to be there at a cer-tain time of each Monday, namely at the beginning of the Aiwisruthrem geh, the watch of the day stretching from sunset to midnight.91 At that time of the day, a communal worship takes place. Hence, whereas the Friday and Meher roj regulars at the Aslaji share a common praxis with similar experiences and expectation, at the Banaji we come across the formation of a ritual assembly that is led and orchestrated by the most senior priest at this temple. However, from a historical perspective, this seemingly simply structured and comparatively short event reveals com-plex roots. Before entering that discussion, some words about the loca-tion, the Seth Cowasji Behramji Banaji Atash Behram, are in order. Contrary to the Aslaji, the Banaji belongs to the Kadmi group ('sect'), which is a minority within the Parsi community. Inspired by Ira-nian practices this group came into being in the 18th century. The Kad-mis are distinguished by a slightly different calendar and some specific practices (often following Iranian patterns) distinct from the majority, the so-called Shehenshahis.92 However, in spite of the Banaji being a Kadmi temple, at the ritual event studied here, the Kadmis are a clear minor-ity—out of 40 people who answered to this question during the on-the-spot interviews, just three (= 7,5%) turned out to be Kadmis. 90 Participation in which, though, is restricted to Parsis only. 91 One informant drew my attention to the fact that this timing may cause a hindrance for some potential participants; regarding her son, Mrs KT stated: [he comes] \"Only if he has got an off or something because he works in shifts. He loves to but he cannot. Mostly he goes to the Aslaji because he can't attend this. Aslaji does not have a fixed time. You can go and come anytime.\" 92 On these groups see Stausberg, Die Religion Zarathushtras, vol. 1, pp. 434-440. There are no statistics available on the demographic distribution of the groups."},{"pageNumber":692,"pageContent":"While the Aslaji Bhikhaji Agiary is a second-grade fire-temple which is neither particularly old nor in any other 'exterior' way especially signifi-cant, the Banaji is a temple housing an Atash Behram-fire, i.e. a fire of the highest category. The fire was 'enthroned' on December 13th, 1845, as Bombay's third Atash Behram (now there are four).93 Before the 'en-thronement' ceremony, the building was kept open for inspection by the general public (especially the non-Parsis who would want to see a Zoroas-trian temple from inside) and according to a chronicle, 16.000 Parsis were present when the fire was receiving its offering for the first time.94 In 1916, for the first time in Bombay, a fund for the celebration of festive gatherings including meals (gahambar) was established for (Zo-roastrian) ladies and children (all previous gahambars were exclusively male affairs). In 1922, a similar fund was established and gahambar meals for ladies and children were arranged.95 This was done inside the compound, which is furnished with facilities for the celebration of larger group ceremonies and events. Possibly this is part of the Iranian tradi-tions practiced by the Kadmis. Just as the other two Kadmi Atash Behram fire-temples—one in Bombay, one in Surat—the Banaji has no High Priest (dastur). The last High Priest passed away in 1916. At present, five priests are working at the Banaji,96 which is one of the two fire-temples in Bombay where a temple-bull (varasyo) is kept. The Banaji is located in a crowded area at what is one of Bombay's most busy roads (Maharishi Karve Road, formerly Queen's Road). There is a train station (Chami Road Station) right across the road from the temple, with easy access by a fly-over. This location provides very con-venient access to the temple, especially for those commuting from the suburbs. However, thanks to a garden surrounding the temple, the com-pound breathes a rather calm atmosphere providing a welcome shelter from the vibrant surroundings. Near the entrance of the temple-compound, which is surrounded by walls and protected by an iron-gate watched over by watchmen, there is 93 On the consecration of these fires in general see the paper by Mario Vitalone in this volume. 94 See M.J.

They have turns of 15 days each."},{"pageNumber":693,"pageContent":"a little shop selling sandalwood and all sorts of religious items, including Q7   · · ·   ·  ·  prayer books. The temple building itself is rather inconspicuous: a square one-floor building with a low roof and no exterior decoration. The main entrance is marked by a porch, from which a flight of steps leads into the building. Opposite to the porch a little square structure was erected in 1984 in order to provide a shelter to perform the ritual ablutions, which are required prior to entering the temple. This enclosure consists of two rooms, one for women, one for men. However, at busy periods such as Monday-nights, the space provided by that structure does not suffice in order to accommodate the crowd. That clearly indi-cates that larger crowds were not anticipated when this structure was erected in 1984. Passing between this structure and the porch, and then turning to the left behind the temple-building, on its North West side, one enters a walled enclosure that is further provided with furrows in the floor, which demarcate it as a ritual precinct. Inside this precinct, there is a palm tree and a pomegranate shrub—both requirements for the per-formance of so-called 'inner' priestly services98—and a huge well with a little structure into which one can place oil-lamps (divo). On all its four sides, the inside of the main temple building is sur-rounded by a corridor with a number of light-boxes (non-transparent, but translucent 'windows') to the outside and French windows to the inner rooms. Apart from a priests' room, which functions as the temple-office, a resting-room for the priest on duty and a storage room for ritual requisites, the space inside the temple is divided into three main units: The biggest unit, located on the South-western side, is a rectangular hall, decorated with portraits (of Zarathustra and members of the family of the founders) and mirrors. From this hall, a window and a door each lead to the other two spatial units. On the Southern side, one has a view into and access to the Dar-e mehr, i.e. the room where the so-called 'in-ner' rituals are performed (within ritual precincts, the urvis-gah). Here one also finds a consecrated fire of the lowest category (Atash Dadgah), which is needed for the performance of those rituals. Apart from the hall, there is direct access to this room both from the corridor and the priest's room. The third spatial unit consists of two interconnected rooms. For the devotees there is no direct access to this spatial unit from the sur-rounding corridor, and they necessarily have to enter it by way of the hall. 97 For a fuller description of the temple, see Giara, A Brief History ofthe Banaji Atash Behram, pp. 43-47. 98 On this category, see Ramiyar Karanjia's paper in this volume."},{"pageNumber":694,"pageContent":"From there they can reach a smaller rectangular prayer hall which is lighted from the adjoining domed fire-room, the so-called 'sanctum sanctorum', which is located right in the middle—and symbolic centre— of the building and which is illuminated by the Atash Behram-fire. Con-trary to all other Atash Behram-temples, the Banaji \"has the payer hall and the openings on one side only\",99 that is towards the square prayer hall, which on the opposite side of the main hall can also be entered from the priest's room. The ritual event in its current form As a rule, crowds of devotees flock to the fire-temples on auspicious dates, i.e. days linked to fire (such as the day and month dedicated to 'Fire', i.e. the divine being and element), on the 'birthday' (salgireh) of a specific fire, in particular of the Atash Behram-fires, during the festival honouring the spirits of the deceased (muktad) and the subsequent morn-ing of the New Year's day (Navroze). In the case of the Banaji, however, all these events are overshadowed by what goes on at Monday night when the entire building is packed by devotees who find it difficult to move inside. There are more visitors to the Atash Behram on Mondays than on any other day of the week. Most people start arriving in the evening, between 6 and 7pm. Before entering the Atash Behram-building, the devotees make their ablutions, and many pay a visit to the well(s), where they say prayers and light an oil-lamp. Hence, when night falls, the sight of the many oil-lamps at the well makes quite an impression. The main event drawing the crowd takes place at the change of the ritual watches (geh) at night, i.e. at the beginning of the Aiwisruthrem geh stretching from sunset to midnight (and hence the exact timing is slightly shifting ac-cording to the seasons). On Mondays, a communal prayer called Hum-bandagi precedes the feeding of the fire that is performed by a qualified priest (buoywalla). On September 18th, 2000, the communal prayer started at 7.15pm and continued until 7.35; one week later it started at 7.05pm and continued until 7.25pm; on February 24th, 2002, it started at 7.08pm and went on until 7.28pm. Including the feeding of the fire(s), the main event thus takes 25 to 30 minutes. After the feeding of the fire(s) by the priest, many if not most devotees perform individual acts of worship in connec-99 Giara, A Brief History of the Banaji Atash Behram, p. 46."},{"pageNumber":695,"pageContent":"tion to the fire(s). Then they leave the temple. The last persons leave the temple by around 9pm to 9.15pm when the gates are locked. The communal prayer (humbandagi) is conducted by Ervad Aspi Framroze Nalladaru, the most senior priest at the Banaji. Throughout the service, the priest is standing on a sort of lectern that is placed in the main hall, next to the wall connecting the main hall to the room housing the Atash Behram, the 'sanctum sanctorum'. The event starts with the singing of three songs. Then follow four prayers composed by Ervad Aspi Nalladaru (see below). The text of the prayers can be found in a booklet that is for sale in the shop at the entrance to the temple. Hence, those who don't (yet) know the prayers by heart can participate in the communal prayers by reading them out from the booklet. Previously, Ervad Nalladaru would also deliver brief talks ('sermons'), but that has been discontinued (for reasons given below). As we will see, this is not the only change that has occurred during the years. Beginnings and changes In the course of my research, I came across different views about the ori-gins of the Monday-night-event. It is fair to say that it gained a wider publicity in 1992, when the community magazine Parsiana devoted the cover story of its July edition to this event. In that article, it is stated: While initially it was a select following that came to the Atash Behram re-ligiously on Mondays, as word spread it has become a mass phenomenon, more so in the last four to five months. Nearly 200 Zoroastrians come to the Atash Behram every Monday from near and faraway.100 The author, Parinaz Gandhi, quotes two (male) devotees to the effect that they were coming regularly since three or four years' time. It seems that the beginnings must have been sometime in the mid or late 1980s. As a matter of fact, one of our on-the-spot respondents, Mr CC (55) who stated he goes daily to the Banaji for the last 25 years, felt that the event was started approximately around 1985 with 10/12 people attending at that time. Later on the event increased. Some of our other respondents claimed to attend the event since at least ten years, which would be around 1990. Mr JP, one of our main respondents was very firm in stat-ing that he would come to the Banaji on Monday-nights since 1990/91, 100 P.

Eight out of the 45 respondents whom Mrs Marfatia interviewed on three consecutive Mondays in September 2000 stated that they were at-tending the event since 7 years, and six of them did so continuously.101 The period of seven years is significant because it was exactly in 1993 that Ervad Aspi Nalladaru did redesign the event (see below). Interest-ingly, this change was not clearly recalled by any of our respondents who all felt that apart from the fact that Ervad Nalladaru had discontinued with the talks ('sermons') the character of the event had basically re-mained unchanged. However, from the interviews made by Mrs. Mar-fatia and myself plus other source-materials it becomes evident that the event did indeed change character. While timing, space and the main priestly actor have remained the same—with an increasingly larger audi-ence—, the logic of design of the event has been intentionally altered. Obviously, as the sheer number of participants shows, this change has done no harm to the popularity of the event—quite on the contrary. The nature of the change can be labelled as a transition from a ritual of invo-cation to a ritual of devotion. While the 'ritual of invocation'-pattern is linked to a mysterious fig-ure by the name of'Jal Bawa', the 'ritual of devotion'-design is linked to a ritual pattern known as 'Humbandagi' ('communal prayer'). The 'Humbandagi' is a well-established ritual pattern in Parsi ritual practice (see below), and everyone I've been talking to had an idea about what it refers to. However, the Monday-night Humbandagi at the Banaji has set a new standard for the type of ritual design called 'Humbandagi' both when it comes to the crowd it attracts and the regularity and continuity by which it is enacted. The success of this particular Humbandagi seems to have inspired others to follow suit, and currently we are witnessing the blossoming of this sort of ritual format among the Parsis.102 However, while the Humbandagi is the current ritual design, it is the link to 'Jal Bawa' that may explain both the initial attraction and the timing (and partly also the space) of the event. 101 With one exception, a man of27 (who is not a regular), all the others are between 49 and 65 years of age. 102 In recent years, weekly Humbandagis were introduced at two fire-temples in Bom-bay as well as in Poona and Surat."},{"pageNumber":697,"pageContent":"Jal Bawa In the current ritual practice, for a vast majority of participants, the fig-ure of 'Jal Bawa' is of no importance whatsoever. As a matter of fact, among the 53 on-the-spot respondents, just 8 had heard the name before. From those respondents, who commented on this issue, four sorts of opinions about 'Jal Bawa', who evidently was held to be a male figure, emerged. One gentleman of 53, who keeps coming to the Banaji on Mondays since seven years,103 remarked: \"He was a saint, his spirit comes on Monday evenings at the time of Aiwishruthrem Gah. Wishes are granted.\" Similarly, a lady referred to a statement made by a priest of the Atash Behram to the extent \"that Jal Bawa is a spirit who comes here on Mondays and fulfils everyone's wishes.\" Another respondent, one of the few Kadmis among our interviewees, a 55 years old gentleman who took part in the event since more than ten years, but now had discontin-ued to do so—nevertheless he was around to do his prayers at the change of geh—, referred to Jal Bawa as a \"spirit in the well\"; hence he consid-ered it \"helpful\" to pray near the well. Three respondents answered by telling the story of a priest who had overslept his duties and woke up when he heard that the bell inside the 'sanctum sanctorum' rang out of its own.104 However, opinions differed as to the question if Jal Bawa was the name of the negligent priest or of the figure miraculously doing the ritual on his behalf. One lady (55) who attended the Humbandagi since 4 years stated that Jal Bawa was \"some mobed [active priest], saintly per-son from the Atash Behram.\" None of our main interviewees had very clear ideas about Jal Bawa and already in 1992, the author of Parsiana's cover story felt at a loss when referring to the \"new cult figure named Jalbawa\" who \"lures crowds to the Banaji Atash Behram on Monday evenings\":105 \"Who was Jalbawa? No one seems to have any definite replies. There are no pic-tures of him... The absence of knowledge leaves everyone free to rely on their own imagination.\" 106 However, as the author readily admits, there is more to it: \"Of Jalbawa as a person, nothing is known, yet in his prayers is reposited considerable faith.\"107 As one of our interviewees, 103 However, he deliberately avoids the communal event by coming slightly earlier. 104 The ringing of the bell is a fixed part of the ritual of feeding the temple-fire (in the Indian version). 105 Gandhi, \"If it's Monday, it must be Banaji's\", p. 14. 106 Gandhi, \"If it's Monday, it must be Banaji's\", p. 15. 107 Gandhi, \"If it's Monday, it must be Banaji's\", p. 14."},{"pageNumber":698,"pageContent":"Mrs GW put it: \"Everybody says that there is power (sat, lit. 'truth') in Jal Bawa.\"108 As a matter of fact, the lack of knowledge about Jal Bawa clearly did not cause much concern to the people nor did it prevent our respondents to refer to him in their ritual practice. This dissonance between cognition and practice is clearly expressed (with an apologetic nuance) in the fol-lowing passage from the interview with Mr JP (33), a person who de-scribed himself as very orthodox, and who is a long-time regular to the Banaji on Mondays: I Jal Bawa, well, there is no Jal Bawa. It had started with the belief in Jal Bawa,... but as such I have never heard a story of himself or never seen a photograph about himself or never seen nor in the Atashbehram or nor any-where, just heard the name Jal Bawa. [At this point Mrs Marfatia who herself had never heard about Jal Bawa before joining me on this project adds the information that the priest leading the communal prayer himself had said that there is no such per-son. JP continues:] That's what I was wondering that we have been hearing since so many years that there is Jal Bawa, so when we also pray we just add his name mentally, there is no harm whatsoever, he is there or not there, maybe he has been there or not there, there is no harm taking his name. But I have never heard the story about him nor have I seen a photograph of him in the Agiary or Atashbehram or in the Humbandagi booklet. Nothing of that sort. The practice of 'taking the name' of Jal Bawa or 'adding his name men-tally' despite (or just because of?) the mystery surrounding this figure lies at the heart of what I have termed the 'ritual of invocation'. On the basis of the statements of our respondents, one can distinguish between two versions of this practice. According to one version, it seems that the devotees silently ('mentally') or even loudly audible mention the name of Jal Bawa while the priest performs the buoy-ceremony (i.e. the feed-ing of the fire with fragrant wood at the beginning of the respective watch of the day, accompanied by the recitation of certain prayers). Ac-cording to the second and more clearly expressed version, it consists in the devotee uttering the name while personally offering sandalwood to the fire after the performance of the buoy-ceremony, i.e. while putting 108 See also, above, Mrs GW's statement about the sat in the tree inside the com-pound of the Aslaji."},{"pageNumber":699,"pageContent":"the 'offering' on the ladle that the priest uses in order to convey the of-ferings of the worshipers onto the fire. (In turn, with the help of this la-dle, the worshipers receive a portion of the ashes from the fire, which many put on their forehead.) Mrs GW describes this process in the fol-lowing terms: And I even like the buoy-ceremony and immediately thereafter we offer the sandalwood in the name of Jal Bawaji, which we are holding in our hand. The priest brings out the khumcha [ladle] especially and we put the sandal-wood on it taking Jal Bawaji's name.109 When I first go I put the sandal-wood but I keep a special one for Jal Bawaji, which I offer after the buoy-ceremony. Some respondents were very explicit about the efficacy of that proce-dure: \"any boon asked will be granted\", as Mr CC (55) puts it. This atti-tude is confirmed by other respondents and by some remarks mentioned in the article published in Parsiana in 1992. A lengthy excerpt from an interview with a family of Kadmi-priests that I conducted in November 1997, is particular relevant in this regard:110 Many years back there was a gentleman by the name of Jal Bawa. It was a saying: If you remember him on a Monday, in the Aiwisruthrem geh, and, with your real inner being, means, if you remember ... him with full faith, then your wishes are going to be fulfilled and granted. So this was—nobody had confirmed it—, but it was a saying, for a very long time back, and it has been handed down from father to son, like my grandfather used ...\"' was told about it, and whenever there would be an unsolvable problem, as a last resort, my father would say, that this is supposed to be—ah—it works sometime, if you have got faith, you just have to, means, nobody knows who this man is or whatever, the whole story is not very well known, but this is the sort of thing, so, about two three times when people were in great difficulty, they found that when they did this, sort of, Monday, you just have to do your normal prayers as you use to do them and only after Aiwis-ruthrem Geh buoy [ceremony] that means, after the Aiwisruthrem geh [prayers], you have to offer sandalwood in the name of Jal Baawa and you have to make a mental wish or a mental note that whatever is my difficulty whatever it is just let it get solved ... 109 The suffix -ji denotes respect. 110 The interview was conducted with two priests. My friend Rusi Khambatta was present at the interview, partly acting as an interpreter. 111 Unfortunately, this part of the sentence was incomprehensible on the tape-recording."},{"pageNumber":700,"pageContent":"I will return to some of the information provided by this excerpt in due course, but here it suffices to draw attention to the ritual practice de-scribed by the interviewee: the making of a 'mental wish', or the placing of a 'mental note' while offering sandalwood in the name of Jal Bawa subsequent to the buoy-ceremony of Aiwisruthrem geh on Mondays. It was held that this wish would invariably be fulfilled. While this was a silent ritual practice, an inner mental affair of the single devotees, who were united in their individual efforts just by a process of synchronisation—everybody would be making his or her own 'mental wish' after the buoy-ceremony—, there are some indications that these wishes were uttered in a clearly audible fashion. These utterances could even be heard from outside the temple. Mrs FN, a 67 years old lady with a priestly family background, provided the following account in March 2002: I had an aunty who used to stay there in that complex or Atashbehram what-ever. 112 She used to tell me that previously people used to shout at the time of change of buoy that \"Jalbhai Mama,113 Jalbhai Mama\". They used to shout like that. But I have never heard of it—she used to tell me. Maybe it was pre-viously, now it is not there.114 They are saying that there is some sort of a soul, now if there is a picture of Jalbhai Mama I do not know, but people believe in his power, and that if you ask Jalbhai Mama he does help you. So in my des-perate situation with my cousins when they were in great trouble, I just stood there, not knowing where Jalbhai Mama is or what that particular thing is, I did close my eyes and I did ask Jalbhai Mama \"wherever you are, guide me and help us out with this trouble that was coming to our cousin and I will be absolutely obliged.\" And I just say \"thank you\", I do not know what it is. But I feel that people say that there is some kind of a spiritual presence there. I felt I should ask this Dasturji but I have never got the chance to do so. [Mrs Marfatia comments on this by saying that when she had inter-viewed people in 2000 nobody seemed to be aware of Jal Bawa, whereas several people whom she had interviewed in 2002 had answered in the affirmative. Mrs FN goes ahead:] Yes I have heard, my aunty herself told me that \"you will be surprised F.115 I can hear it right into my house the way they shout.\" They say he is some-body from Surat, she told me. 112 It seems that she is here referring to some Parsi blocks close by the Banaji. 113 Mama = maternal uncle. 114 Mrs FN attends the prayers irregularly since 3 to 4 years. 115 Here the name of Mrs FN is omitted."},{"pageNumber":701,"pageContent":"The Surat link will he explored further below. Here, two things shall be commented upon. First, the ritual practice of'shouting out' the name of Jal Bawa. Second, the process by which out of sheer desperation, as a 'last resort', a person seeks help in resolving trouble—in this case, other people's trouble116—from Jal Bawa (or 'Jalbhai Mama'117), a figure oth-erwise completely unknown to her. And it has helped—at least this is what she claimed. Mrs GW provides another instance for this proce-dure:118 ... I told her mother if you want to do it otherwise it is your wish, then for three Fridays or three Mondays or five Mondays, either you take her with you or go alone, go when [the] Jal Bawa ceremony is going on, offer san-dalwood and ask for blessing for your daughter's recovery. Then she met me once and she said \"Thank you very much, my daughter has recovered and has got married and now has a child\". Everybody says that there is power (sat) in Jal Bawa. Even though I cannot go I remember him every night. Mrs GW had herself started with a sequential pattern: ... At first, for several years I used to go every Monday. There might be a rare Monday I would miss.... Earlier when I had started I had decided to do 5, then I did 7, then 9,1 did like that, then missed one and restarted. Then I just continued unless there was some problem. Though I am not going now every evening I pray and remember, every evening, especially on Mondays because it is connected to Mondays. This sequential pattern is a challenge for practical reasons. For women it is virtually impossible to stick to for an extended period of time, for they won't enter the fire-temple during menstruation. Mrs KT, however, felt that she wanted to do it at least once, as sort of an extra-effort, after all the years she was regularly attending the event.119 In 1992, Parinaz Gan-116 Mrs FN stated: \"Not only that much I, mostly 90% I do not ask anything for my-self, but I have to ask for others so 1 always feel that God is there to help others also. Up until now I have always asked for others, up until now, and I feel that there is help, there is help definitely.\" 117 The fact that she calls Jal Bawa by this name probably implies confusion with the Aslaji's Jal Mistry who is addressed as 'Jalbhai'. Mrs FN and her husband go to the Aslaji and are familiar with Jal Mistry. However, it is very clear that what Mrs FN is describing here pertains to the Banaji. 118 The passage refers to a 22 years old girl who was suffering from serious kidney trouble forcing her to wear a special mask in order to prevent possible infections. 119 Mrs KT: \"But then you know it is very difficult to do 9 Mondays in a row; some-thing or the other comes up. But I have done it once at a stretch. [Mrs Marfatia: With a"},{"pageNumber":702,"pageContent":"dhi refers to an informant (mentioned by name) who had stated that three years back—that would be in 1989—he was advised by Ervad Aspi Nal-ladaru, the priest who is now leading the Humbandagi, \"to come regu-larly for seven or nine Mondays, then take a break for one Monday, and if he so chose, start the round again.\"120 Apart from the numbers 7—an auspicious number in Zoroastrianism—and 9—possibly an adaptation of the Novena-pattern familiar to most Parsis from St. Michaels—, the number 11 occasionally crops up.121 In general terms, the sequential order seems to be an expansion ofthe calendar-pattern that is otherwise an alien instrument to synchronise rit-ual practice in Zoroastrian traditions. The sequential pattern may be a strategy to elaborate on the wish-motif, for it requires greater efforts on behalf of the devotees. It also provides an instrument to rationalise the turn of events should the fulfilment of the wish fail—contrary to what was expected. In any way, the sequential extension of the visits is a mechanism that originally may have contributed to create a continuous adherence to the service. Probably it was a powerful incidence of turning an occasional participation into a regular habit. Be that as it may, in many ways the Jal Bawa events proved to be a success in the long run. The fulfilment of wishes was probably one, if not the most important, factor contributing to that success. However, from the interviews and the article by Gandhi it clearly emerges that it took several years before the event drew so large crowds that it became an affair everybody was aware of. The popularity of the event attracted the attention of a community magazine such as Parsiana, and Parsi-ana 's cover story in turn made it a primary community issue. It seems that initially not more than a handful of persons attended the ritual of Jal Bawa invocation. Then it spread—with the fulfilment of wishes and the miracles operating as the gravity pull—and starting like a snowball it eventually turned into an avalanche.122 The process seems to have accel-mind?] Yes, with a mind, otherwise it is just not possible, after 6 or 7 something comes up, so I said, I must do it at least once since I have been going for so many years.\" 120 Gandhi, \"If it's Monday, it must be Banaji's\", p. 14. 121 Among the Parsis, odd numbers are in general considered to be more auspicious than even numbers. In this context, Ramiyar Karanjia pointed out to me (by e-mail): \"This idea has gone so far that many people started believing that even navjote should be undergone at the age of 7 or 9 and not at 8\". 122 In November 1997, a priest at the Banaji described that process to me in the fol-lowing terms: \"... two, three times out of say five, people started getting results so what started spreading by word of mouth that 'if you do this sort of things it is going to help'"},{"pageNumber":703,"pageContent":"erated shortly before July 1992.123 The 200 participants mentioned by Gandhi—200 people is a big crowd by Parsi standards—may have been something like the culmination of that phase of the process. It is in the course of that development that the ritual eventually changed character, turning into a well-orchestrated communal prayer (humbandagi) or devo-tional ritual. At the same time, we can observe a turnover of participants, with some old ones dropping out—or not coming regularly any more— and many new ones starting to attend (see also below). In an interview that I conducted in November 1997, one Kadmi priest working at the Banaji drew a very down-to-earth picture of the religious needs of his coreligionists: I mean, most of the people who come here, certainly want something, I mean wherever most of them pray, somebody is asking for something, so basically, [the] basic purpose of prayer is this, and I mean on one pretext or the other people are coming to the temple, and I mean if you would have told them \"you just go and pray there\" they wouldn't be doing it, but if you tell them, I mean, if you tell them that \"you are going to have some sort of benefit from that\"—I mean that is human nature ... According to the priest, then, the prospect of benefits draws the people to the ritual. The problems and the 'miracles' reported in connection with the early Jal Bawa Monday-events are of a similar kind as those we encountered in connection with his namesake (Jal Mistry) at the Aslaji: stories concerning family disputes, healing and recovery, and divination (e.g. in finding out who had committed a theft or a murder). ...as time went by more and more people started coming and started believing in this... what started off Mondays or on Mondays was actually this sort of thing, but later on because of, nowadays what happens, it has become, I mean one person goes there and says ke [= that] Ί am going to Banaji fire temple', Parsis have got a habit of following the ... so if one person follows the other one also wants to follow ... This person must have told another person, the other person must have told a third person ... First, we used to have a gathering of 15-20 people, and it slowly started becoming 30-50 people, and as the people in half of them would not know what is going on, they would just say, 'oh, on Monday you should go', and they would come and when a lot of people started coming ...\" 123 Gandhi, \"If it's Monday, it must be Banaji's\", p. 14: \"While initially it was a select following that came to the Atash Behram religiously on Mondays, as word spread it has become a mass phenomenon, more so in the last four to five months.\" Note the implicit valuation: the initial religious circle standing against the current 'mass phenomenon'."},{"pageNumber":704,"pageContent":"The Surat connection: Zäl, the battle of Variav, and the problem of mixed marriages While Jal Bawa has attracted the attention of a wider public as a 'cult figure' emerging in Bombay in the late 1980s, there is in fact a longer tradition behind the figure. This tradition goes back to Surat.124 The members of the Kadmi priestly family, originally from Surat, working at the Banaji interviewed by me in 1997, were very firm that Jal Bawa was known since at least 3 generations and that this tradition was \"more than 80-100 years old\". This was confirmed by other sources. Among our respondents, Mr CC (55) voiced the opinion that Jal Bawa was \"originally from [the] Surat Atash Behram. People had faith that one should offer on Mondays in Aiwisruthrem geh\". This opinion received confirmation from Surat where Mrs Marfatia conducted two interviews in March 2002. One 71-year-old gentleman recalled that people were offering sandalwood in Jal Bawa's name at the Kadmi Atash Behram125 on Mondays in his childhood days. He professed to know nothing about Jal Bawa, \"but it is said that he was a person of an angelic majesty and he used to say: 'Lead a simple life'.\" Kersasp Nalladaru, the former managing priest (panthaki) of Surat's Kadmi Atash Behram who was bom in 1930126 remembered: ... my father also used to tell us that Zarthoshtis had a practice of offering sandalwood here in the name of Jal Bawa. [Mrs Marfatia: Any particular day or time?] On Mondays, they used to give me also sandalwood, which I used to offer here.127 [Mrs Marfatia: But who was he? Even your father was not aware of his story?] No, no one knows, they used to offer sandalwood in Jal Bawa's name, but nothing else was done. [Mrs Marfatia: Was he a saintly mobed or dastur?] No, nothing is known, I have heard this from my grandfather and my father, but no one knows who and what he was. This had gone on for sometime but in between this had stopped but it has now restarted.128 124 See also Gandhi, \"If it's Monday, it must be Banaji's\", p. 15. 125 The Seth Pestonji Kalabhai Vakil Kadmi Atash Behram was established in 1823. 126 From a genealogical point of view, Ervad Nalladaru was entitled to follow in the footsteps of his father and forefathers as a Dastur after his father passed away in 1968. The trustees, however, much to his frustration have denied him this right in 1975 (after he had challenged the policy of the Surat Parsi Punchayat). He tried to fight for what he considered his right and went to the High Court where his case is pending since 1980! 127 This refers to the time when he was performing the buoy-ceremony. 128 By this statement, Ervad Kersasp Nalladaru refers to the fact that Humbandagis"},{"pageNumber":705,"pageContent":"Later on in the interview, the conversation returned to the Jal Bawa is-sue, and this is what Ervad Nalladaru said: Even in Bahmanji Khurshedji Kumana's time129 sandalwood was offered in the name of Jal Bawa. My father used to say that. He expired at the age of 86 years on 23rd April 1934 ... Even at that time sandalwood was being of-fered in the name of Jal Bawa. [Mrs Marfatia: So we do not know how this story started?] At that time people used to say that on Mondays offerings should be made in the name of Jal Bawa. Many Behdins130 used to give me money for sandalwood and I also used to put the sandalwood on their be-half. Only in Aiwisruthrem geh. Hence, the figure of Jal Bawa remains a mystery, but it is sufficiently clear by now that there was a practice of offering sandalwood to the Kadmi Atash Behram at Surat in Aiwisruthrem geh on Mondays, and the exis-tence of this practice is attested since the 1930s at the very latest; possibly it already existed some decades earlier. In the 1980s, this ritual of invoca-tion, which seems to partly have fallen into oblivion in Surat by the time, was transferred to the Banaji Kadmi Atash Behram in Bombay where it gained an unprecedented popularity and later on came to be redesigned. If factually nothing is known about Jal Bawa, his name at least merits closer scrutiny. Hitherto, the name 'Jal Bawa' has simply been taken for granted—and so it was by our respondents. There second part—the word bawaM—is a common Parsi designation for 'father'. The word is also used as a term of respect, often referring to elders such as the grandpar-ents in the house. Hence, 'Jal Bawa' may be rendered as the 'respected Jal' or'father Jal'.132 similar to those held at the Banaji were introduced in the Surat Vakik Kadmi Atash Behram starting from January 7' , 2002. They use the booklet from Bombay. Recently, the attendance was at around 8-10 persons (information given to Mrs Marfatia on a trip to Surat in July 2003). 129 Ervad Bahmanji Khurshedji Kumana (1848-1934) \"has had the enviable record of 52 years of unbroken regular service at the sanctum of the Surat Kadmi Atash Beheram where he was proud to toll the Prayer Call till 82 years of age\", H.D.

Probably, their emendation is a result of their neo-traditionalist likings: Because 'Jal Bawa' seems to be a comparatively recent phenomenon (but see below), it can not be 'Zoroastrian' in the 'classical' sense and hence must be a leaning from somewhere else, in this case from the 'Baba-cult' of popular 'Hinduism'. 132 Bawa is also a colloquial Gujarati term for 'Parsi', often also used with an added"},{"pageNumber":706,"pageContent":"In my opinion, also the first member—'Jal'—can be easily explained by the phonetic change from 'Z' in Persian to ' J' in Gujarati. The most prominent example of this process is the name of Zarathushtra, Persian Zartost, that turned into Jartost in Gujarati. Hence, Persian Zäl is lurking behind Gujarati Jal, and 'Jal Bawa' signifies 'respected Zäl', or 'father Zäl'. The occurrence of that name in this context requires an explana-tion. In what follows, I will present two hypotheses of an admittedly somewhat speculative nature. Zäl, the vassal king of Sistën, is a legendary figure appearing in Fer-dowsi's epic Säh-nämeh and in the writings of some Arabic historians. However, Zäl is nowhere mentioned in the Avestan texts. Nor is he a prominent figure in Zoroastrian Middle Persian literature, but he is occa-sionally remembered as the son of Säm and the father of the great hero Rustam in Zoroastrian textual traditions,133 and his name is invoked in a list of the ancient heroes that is recited as part of several rituals. More-over, Zäl is a recognised, albeit rare, proper name among the Parsis. As is well known, within the epic traditions, Zäl is a very peculiar hero. In many ways, Zäl is an anomalous person, a hero of inversion.134 To begin with, when he was bom, he was a beautiful baby, but he had white hair. He had the appearance of an 'aged child'. When his father, Säm, saw the child he referred to the baby as an ' Ahremanic' and a 'de-monic' child. As he was scared that the nobles would ridicule him, Säm abandoned the baby, but it was found by the Simurgh-bird, who took the child to its nest and reared the boy with his own young. Following a dream, many years later, Säm went to search for his son and when he eventually found him, he took him home. When the child was about to leave the Simurgh, the bird tells him that he had given him the name of dastân-e zend (referring to dastän - 'trickery', 'strategem'). Furthermore, upon the child's departure, the Simurgh gives the future hero one of his feathers in order for the child to remain under the wings of his power. suffix of respect ('Bawaji'). As the term is mostly used in a scornful or ironic sense, this meaning of the term is probably less relevant here. 133 See, e.g., Dhabhar, The Persian Rivayats of Hormazyar Framarz and Others, p. 581. The origin and history of the legends of Zäl and Rostam is a much debated topic, see E. Yarshater, \"Iranian National History\", The Cambridge History of Iran. Volume 3(1). The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian Periods, ed. E. Yarshater (Cambridge et al., 1983), pp. 359-477; O.M. Davidson, Poet and Hero in the Persian Book of Kings (Myth and Poetics; Ithaca/London, 1994). 134 On the anomaly of Rostam and his ancestors (first of all his father Zäl) see David-son, Poet and Hero in the Persian Book of Kings, p. 76."},{"pageNumber":707,"pageContent":"The bird advises him to throw this feather into the fire if he should hap-pen to be in great danger. Should he throw the feather into the fire, the Simurgh promises that its powers will assist him. Hence, his specific destiny—he was born with white hair and was for a period living away from the human habitation and was raised by the Simurgh-bird—certainly puts him in a very special position, and Zäl alias Dastän is clearly invested with miraculous powers. My first hy-pothesis then would be that the 'taking the name' of Jal Bawa is a way to activate these powers. To offering of sandalwood to the fire in the name of Jal Bawa is like throwing the miraculous feather into the fire, and just as the Simurgh had promised to Zäl that his powers would emerge, the worshippers evidently placed their hopes in the effect resulting from their ritual acts. While this first hypothesis links the Jal Bawa to Zäl's childhood, the second hypothesis is linked to the circumstances of Zäl's marriage.135 Here, again we come across an inverted structure. To briefly resume the story: A very positive horoscope is cast for Zäl who is prepared for his future royal duties. Zäl makes a tour through the empire and happens to arrive at Kabol. There governs a brave and wise king by the name of Mehräb who, however, by race was an Arab and an offspring from the dragon-monster Zohak (chained by Faridun). Hitherto, Mehräb had been ignored by the nobles, for he was considered as a devil-worshipper who would follow a different religion and path. Zäl, however, falls in love with Mehräb's beautiful daughter Rodäbeh (of a pari-like face), and their desire to get married causes troubles because apart from the lovers all concerned parties are agreed that this would imply an illegitimate ge-netic-racial-religious mixing (Arabs/Iranians; dragons/heroes; devil-worshippers/God-worshippers; magic/religion; idolaters/God-worship-pers).136 Repeatedly, the idea of such a union is compared to the mixing of water and fire, or medicine and poison, and the reigning supreme 135 E. Yarshater, \"Iranian National History\", p. 464 refers to this as \"the most moving love story in the Shäh-näma\". D. Khaleghi Motlagh, Die Frauen im Schahname. Ihre Geschichte und Stellung unter gleichzeitiger Berücksichtigung vor- und nachislami-scher Quellen (Inaugural-Dissertation Köln, 1971), p. 39 calls it \"eine der schönsten Erzählungen der persischen Dichtkunst\" (on pp. 31-39 he gives a summary). 136 See also Khaleghi Motlagh, Die Frauen im Schahname, p. 39: \"Am Anfang gleicht der Aufbau der Erzählung dem eines Dramas. Die notwendigen Gegensätze sind vorhanden: zwei verschiedene Religionen, zwei verschiedene Nationalitäten und eine alte Feindschaft zwischen den Vätern der beiden Liebenden, also zwei völlig verschie-dene Welten, eine ferldünische und eine zahhäkische\"."},{"pageNumber":708,"pageContent":"king, Minocher, is clearly concerned about the qualities of the offspring such a union would produce. Zäl, however, is able to conquer the resistance, because Säm, his fa-ther, had promised him that he would never go against his wishes when he was returned to him by the Simurgh. Hence, Zäl was in a position of a moral superiority vis-à-vis his father (another inverted structure!) who was forced to reluctantly accept his son's decision. Zäl, in tum, favoured by a promising horoscope was able to convince the king and to success-fully pass a test made by the priests. Eventually, Zäl and Rudäbeh got married, and Rostam, the greatest warrior hero of all, would be an off-spring of this union between the daughter of a demon and the foundling of a bird.137 This account, it should be noted, certainly strikes an anathema in the Parsi context where 'mixed marriages' (of the type Zäl/Rudäbeh) have become a taboo issue in the early 20th century.138 It is tempting to specu-late that the figure of'father Zäl' in some way or the other alludes to this problem, or that he may possibly even have originated in this context. As a matter of fact, in the famous law Suit (Nr. 689 of 1906, the 'Parsi Pun-chayat Case') at the Bombay High Court,139 (possibly doubtful) evidence was produced to the effect that it was a practice in the surroundings of Surat for Parsi males to have non-Parsi mistresses and that the children who were bom from such unions were occasionally invested in the Zoro-astrian faith. Seen from this angle, the fact that 'father Zäl' made his first appearance in Surat may strike a note. However, there is more to it, for a Kadmi priest in Bombay whom I interviewed in 1997, reported a legend that is based on well-known ma-terial while at the same time substantially transforming it. The episode he alluded to is known as the 'battle' or 'massacre of Variav'. It seems to have first been transmitted orally before Parsi historians such as D.F. Karaka, S.M. Desai and J.J. Modi reported about the incident.140 The 137 The further heroic deeds of Zäl in the defence of Sistan and as a wise advisor of the Kayanian kings are irrelevant in this context. 138 Interestingly, though, current Parsis are not aware that Ferdowsi here clearly de-scribes a case of what by Indian standards would otherwise be termed a 'mixed mar-riage'. The reading of the text is evidently under the power of conceptual schemes that permit the very idea of a 'mixed marriage' in the Sâh-nâmeh. 139 See Stausberg, Die Religion Zarathushtras, vol. 2, pp. 52-57 with the relevant lit-erature. 140 For a review of early scholarship see H.E. Eduljee, Kisseh-i Sanjan (Bombay, 1991), pp. 100-105."},{"pageNumber":709,"pageContent":"historians have tried to link the report to historically documented cases of violence against the Parsis. No two accounts agree on what exactly was at stake, and it is unclear when—and if at all (!)—this 'battle' or 'massacre' happened. However, the main narrative pattern is quite clear. After the Parsis had settled (at a certain place), (for some reason or the other) they were attacked (by some group), but the Parsis were able to defend themselves. There are two versions about the following events. According to one (reported by Karaka) the frustrated aggressors repeated their attack and took the Par-sis who were attending a feast by surprise. The entire Parsi community— men, women, and children—was massacred. According to the other ver-sion (reported by Desai) the attack was repeated when the Parsi men had gone away to attend some feast or the other. However, the Parsi women, masking themselves, put on the armour of the men and fought the ene-mies. They were about to repel the aggressors when the veil fell off a woman's face. When the aggressors discovered that they were fighting against women, they doubled their efforts and eventually killed many of the women. Afterwards, they also attacked the men who had fallen asleep after enjoying the festive meal. Those Parsis who made it to es-cape, fled to Navsari. The story as I was told it by the Kadmi priest in 1997 follows the second version. However, the set-up of the story was changed in three respects. To begin with, the priest held that the event had occurred after the arrival of the Parsis to India and hence did pertain to the entire Indian Parsi community (and not to one local community alone). Hence, from a local legend, it is transferred to the history of the Parsi community as such; from a local episode it was transformed into a prototypical event. Second, as the priest told it, the massacre did only pertain to the women and their children. This is consequential, for taking into account that nar-ration places this massacre in an early period; it thereby pertains to most women and children of the entire Parsi population. Hence, after the mas-sacre, the Parsi men, when they awoke from their sleep, were left with-out most women and children. This is exactly where the third and most crucial transformation comes into play, for the priest continued his ver-sion of the story by saying that the Parsis, who were bereaved of (most of) their women, in order to make up for the shortage of girls and women decided to admit high-caste Hindu spouses for marriage. The children stemming from those marriages, the priest continued, were then referred to as 'behdin' (lay Zoroastrians)."},{"pageNumber":710,"pageContent":"Many Parsis will possibly find this narration offensive, and it is probably unreliable from a historical point of view. In any case, the story conveys a sort of genetic supremacy of the priesthood and it has the ap-pearance of being a priestly fabrication, possibly of Kadmi origin. It is the only time that I have heard this version of the story—hence it may be dismissed as one priest's idiosyncrasy—, but significantly I came to hear it in the context of an interview devoted to the Jal Bawa phenomenon. The (admittedly speculative) second hypothesis hence is that the figure of Jal Bawa, i.e. 'father Zäl'—Zäl, who intermarried just as the Parsis after the incident at Variav (at least according to that version of the leg-end)—is in different ways linked to the extremely sensitive issue of 'mixed marriages'. Possibly, Jal Bawa is a posthumous offspring of a version of the 'massacre of Variav' that was still commemorated in Surat in the late 19th century.141 Significantly, it was in Surat, where the Jal Bawa events are attested at least since the early 20th century. Re-designing the event: The invention and development of the Humbandagi Mrs Marfatia had herself never heard about a figure by the name of 'Jal Bawa' before venturing on the project with me. When she, in the course of an interview with Ervad Aspi F. Nalladaru of the Banaji that was held on September 21st 2000,142 asked him about 'Jal Bawa' his reaction was outright denial. This may come as somewhat of a surprise, for in Parsi-ana 's \"cover story\" Ervad Nalladaru was indirectly quoted in connection to Jal Bawa. Ervad Nalladaru was furious about that and he felt that he should sue the magazine. As a matter of fact, it seems that about half a year after Parsiana's July 1992 issue was published, the ritual event that took place on Mondays in the Aiwisruthrem geh was entirely redesigned: the individual prayers and invocations which had already implicitly ac-quired a communal dimension by the sheer mass of people present was intentionally redesigned into an organized ritual of communal devotion, a so-called Humbandagi. As the Humbandagi is not mentioned in the article published in Parsiana, it seems to be a later addition. A priest at the Banaji explained this process in the following terms: 141 See D.F. Karaka, History of the Parsis (London, 1884), p. 49. 142 I would like to take the opportunity to thank Ervad Nalladaru for his cooperation throughout the project. He gave two interviews to Mrs Marfatia and did not object to me being in the compound of the Banaji on Mondays."},{"pageNumber":711,"pageContent":"... when many people started coming here, the Trustees here, they decided ... that since so many of Zoroastrians are coming here ... so they ... told an-other priest ... to hold a sort of congregation and to hold some sort of prayers here, collective prayers ... ... and when a lot of people started coming, the Trustees suggested to [Er-vad Aspi] Nalladaru ... \"why don't you have some sort of Humbandagi done so that more people come to attend\" ... I find it doubtful that the trustees of the temple actually should have wanted to attract ever more people; probably they rather wanted to streamline the religious physiognomy of the event. Similarly, Ervad Aspi Nalladaru recalls143 that 'there used to be huge crowds who would as-semble in front of the kebla144 and would not allow others to come close to the kebla and immediately after the buoy145 they would rush out and others would try to get in. This used to cause chaos and therefore per-mission from the trustees was sought to form a system in order to avoid unpleasantness amongst the devotees.' Ervad Nalladaru drafted the prayers, which were then approved by the trustees. Ervad Nalladaru re-membered that on one Sunday the then managing trustee rang him re-questing him to start with the Humbandagi, and 'a board was put up say-ing that Humbandagi would be started from the next day itself. The first Humbandagi, Ervad Nalladaru recalls, was held on April 12th 1993. Humbandagi: Transformations of a ritual pattern The word humbandagi (or hambandagi) is a Parsi-Gujarati term, which is a compound of two Persian words: ham - 'together', 'in the same manner', and bandagi - 'devotion', 'prayer'. It is not clear when the term was first coined. Despite the word humbandagi being constructed out of two Persian terms, it is not a Persian word, nor does it—to my knowledge—occur in the New Persian writings of the Zoroastrians. As a matter of fact, there is no term univocally denoting 'communal worship' in Pahlavi either.146 143 Because Ervad Nalladuru did not want to have the interview taped, the following transcripts were made by Mrs Marfatia based on her notes and memory. This sort of information is indicated by the use of inverted commas ('...'). 144 I.e., the chamber in which the Atash Behram fire is housed. 145 I.e., the feeding of the fire performed by the priest. 146 The possible exception is mëzd. On this term see Anders Hultgàrd's paper in this"},{"pageNumber":712,"pageContent":"Probably the term humbandagi was invented as a result of a change in ritual practice, i.e. the establishment of communal worship. This may be the result of the fact that there was a decrease in the individual per-formance of the ritual duties; correspondingly, people started to pray to-gether.147 It seems that the Humbandagis were invented as a ritual pat-tern employed in public events and on festival days such as the New Year festival and festive occasions such as the 'birthday' of the temple-fires. One of the first references to the practice of Humbandagi's comes from Calcutta, where a Humbandagi was conducted on the request of the government in order to pray for the First World War to end.148 The prac-tice of heaving Humbandagi prayers during the festival honouring the spirits of the deceased (Muktad), which is still observed in some fire-temples in Bombay, is already attested from Karachi in the middle of the 20th century.149 Nowadays, such Humbadagis are also conducted in the West (e.g. in New Orleans). Usually, a Humbandagi consists of reciting the most important prayer-formulae (manthras): two Yathä Ahü Vairyô plus one Ashem Vohü. This is the primary ingredient that can be supplemented by other materials such as the Stum-no-kardo during Muktad or a portion of the Khorshed Niyayesh during spring New Year (Jamshedi Navroz). Instead of inserting further prayers, one can also add the (Gujarati or English) translation of the text and a speech or a 'sermon' of different length. The simple varieties of Humbandagis are performed on many occasions. In the case of the Monday-night-humbandagi at the Banaji, Ervad Aspi Nalladaru designed the prayers,150 and the amount of text recited volume. Datsur Dr. F.M. Kotwal has voiced the following opinion (by e-mail): \"I think the term myazd is used for a religious assemblage in which people participate in prayers with the priests keeping a hand-contact (payvand) with one another. Old prayer books indicate that such myazd festivals should be celebrated five times in a month: Mihr, Rashn, Bahram, Ashtad and Aneran.\" 147 This explanation was suggested by Dastur Dr. F.M. Kotwal in the following terms (e-mail): \"Hambandagi means congregational prayer. The concept seems to have been evolved in later times when a number of Parsis found it difficult to say their obligatory prayers individually. Again, it instils in them a spirit of harmony and devotion.\" 148 This is stated in the Athornan Nameh (reference kindly supplied by Ervad Dr. Ramiyar Karanjia.) 149 See Kreyenbroek, Living Zoroastrianism, p. 212. 150 In an article published in Jame Jamshed Weekly, on December 7th, 1997 (in Guja-rati), Ervad Nalladaru briefly described the way in which the prayers were \"getting writ-ten\"."},{"pageNumber":713,"pageContent":"has gradually grown.151 Because Ervad Nalladaru compiled the texts (from different sources), the participants could not simply fall back upon their common prayer books or the texts they had learnt by heart. This is why Ervad Nalladaru had photocopies of the prayers distributed. Ini-tially, this was one sheet only, but afterwards the number slowly in-creased. As this turned out to be increasingly unpractical some benefac-tor started to have little booklets containing the prayers distributed. In 2000, Mrs Marfatia picked up a booklet of 19 pages that had been pub-lished in June 1999 \"by A Well Wisher for Zoroastrian community\" [sic].152 According to that booklet, which was in use at the time of our work with the Banaji, in September 2000 and in February 2002, the Humban-dagi starts with three songs, followed by four prayers.153 Each prayer starts with two Yathä Ahü Vairyö plus one Ashem Vohü and is concluded by one Yenghe Hätqm—the third of the most ancient manthras—, fol-lowed again by one Ashem Vohü plus one Yathä Ahü Vairyö and finally two Ashem Vohü. The Yathä Ahü Vairyö/Ashem Vohü-sequence is thus used as an embedded, inverted double frame [of the type YYA ... HAYAA].'54 This frame-structure includes a compilation of 15 to 25 verses from different texts. In each prayer, at least one piece from the prayer in praise of the Moon (Mäh Niyayesh) is inserted. Moreover, apart from the second prayer, the prayers contain one passage—different in each case—that is to be recited thrice. When Mrs Marfatia interviewed Ervad Nalladaru on September 21st 2000, the priest explained to her that the first prayer is in honour of the (consecrated temple) Fire (Atash Padshah), the second in honour of the Moon (Mah Bakhtar), the third in honour of the divine protector Sarosh Yazad, and the fourth in honour of Shah Faridun. However, the set-up of this latter prayer is completely different from the usual Afsun-e Shah Faridun (see above). Instead, it combines a section from the prayer in 151 Several interviewees vividly recalled this process. 152 Banaji Atash Behram / Kavali-Ahurana-o-Jartosht / Dadar Hormazda ne vinanti / Khudavind Khavind / Hum Bandagi / and / Afsun Mantra. Apart from the prayers, the booklet contains an Introduction, a Qawwäli (text only), a Gujarati song (\"Dadar Hor-mazd ne vinanti\"), a Monäjät together with a synopsis in English, and several pictures. In 1997 and 2000 I have seen earlier booklets as well, but I am not aware when the first were printed. 153 According to the booklet (p. 10), the first prayer is to be recited thrice. However, Mrs Marfatia informs me that it is recited one time only during the Humbandagi. 154 H = Yenghe Hätqm-, Y = Yathä Ahü Vairyö-, A = Ashem Vohü."},{"pageNumber":714,"pageContent":"praise of the Moon (Mäh Niyayesh), one verse from the first Gatha (Y. 32,4) and from the Siwm-prayer. Moreover, in the first prayer, a specific (otherwise unknown) formula directed to Shah Faridun occurs that is to be recited thrice. The text which is composed to in honour of Sarosh Ya-zata neither explicitly refers to Sarosh, nor does it make use of any of the available materials (hymns) dedicated to this divine being. The second prayer, in honour of the Moon, combines a verse from the prayer in praise of the Moon with a verse from the Variant Yasht that is generally regarded as a powerful text for purposes of healing. In the booklet, the explanation kindly provided by Ervad Nalladaru is not echoed. Instead, the four prayers bear the following titles: \"Humban-dagi (No. 1)\"; \"Afshun for all Difficulties (No. 2)\"; \"Afshun Mantra (No. 3)\"; \"An Effective Afshun Mantra to Elevate any Type of Physical Body Ailment (No. 4)\".155 As even the first prayer contains a spell in the name of Shah Faridun, the entire set of prayers can be regarded as a spell (afshun). From the textual side, then, the Humbandagi is a communal worship based on textual materials, which Ervad Nalladaru has reframed as spells. In other words: Ordinary' prayer-materials are turned into spells, and through the Humbandagi the spells obtain a communal dimension. The efficacy ascribed to these prayers—and the appeal to their effi-cacy may be at the bottom of terming them 'spells'—is made explicit in the booklet, where each of the three spells is given a specific purpose ranging from \"quarrels of difference of opinion with other persons\" (No. 2), \"Peace in the Family\" (No. 3), reducing weakness and increasing vi-tality or fighting against \"severe illness\" (No. 4); moreover, directions for the application of the spells are added (No. 2.: \"most effective when recited Seven times in a Span of 24 hours\"; No. 3: \"thrice daily, at any time of the day\"; No. 4: \"thrice at any time of the day\" or, in more severe cases, seven times daily).156 Because Ervad Aspi Nalladaru, the leader of the communal prayers, had composed new texts (out of already existing ones) the Banaji Hum-bandagi has emerged as a new format for the Humbandagi as a ritual pat-tern.157 The Humbandagi at the Banaji was designed as a distinctive 155 To Mrs Marfatia Ervad Nalladaru confirmed the efficacy of the second and the fourth prayer by referring to personal experiences. 156 All quotations are from the booklet Banaji Atash Behram etc. 157 According to the booklet (Banaji Atash Behram, p. 2), the prayers were \"com-posed taking in to [sic] consideration varuous [sic] factors, viz. Monday, Aiwisruthrem Geh, Mahbakhtar, peace of mind\"."},{"pageNumber":715,"pageContent":"event. This process was powerfully reinforced by the introduction of the booklet, and the new medium allowed for a transfer of the Humbadagi as a weekly community event held at a temple to the individual prayers per-formed at other times and places. Indeed, two of our interviewees refer to their (or their relatives) using the booklet for their prayers privately (at home, or when travelling), in part, but not necessarily so, in case they can't make it to the event at the Banaji itself. Ervad Nalladaru also men-tioned that some people are visiting hospitals where they recite the Humbandagi prayers near the beds of the patients. Apart from a collection of single spells designed as remedies for spe-cific problems, though, the Humbandagi was clearly invented as an overarching unity for communal worship, and the fact of praying to-gether is by many participants believed to increase the inherent efficacy ofthe prayers. The booklet, for instance, states: \"All prayers can also be recited individually ... and are most beneficial when recited in a group.\"158 In one of the interviews with Mrs Marfartia, Ervad Nalladaru remarked 'that joint prayers bring blessings to everyone, even those sit-ting in the garden, just as a king159 would bestow small tokens to every-one he meets. It gives help, confidence, strength, etc. to the participants. For example, when participants in a manifestation march together it gains strength, so does nature observe the togetherness of the partici-pants and gives bigger award with the blessings of the Atashbehram.' The idea that it is better for a group of people to say joint prayers in-stead of each and everybody praying individually is generally empha-sised by the Parsis, but in ritual practice it is rather the exception than the rule. Apparently, for many participants in the Humbandagi, the experi-ence of a group of people—and, by Parsi standards, an extremely large group of people—praying together is a major attraction: \"even if you pray Yatha Ahu Vairyo or Ashem Vohu, whatever the complete book has it, it is fantastic because 200 to 300 people are praying it\" (Mr FB).160 That \"the feeling is really great\", as one interviewee (Mr JP) puts it, may be a by-product of the large gathering. Several respondents em-phasised that the Humbandagi 'feels nice'/'feels good'. Out of 46 respondents commenting on that issue, 30 (= 65%) stated that 'praying together' was one of the main things attracting them to the 158 Banaji Atash Behram, p. 4. 159 The consecrated temple-fire is usually referred to as a king (padshah). 160 It should be noted that Mr FB has been deeply involved in a religious movement that stresses communal prayers."},{"pageNumber":716,"pageContent":"Banaji on Monday nights; 12 respondents (= 26%), eleven of whom were attending since at least a year, even considered it to be the most important factor. One young respondent (16 years) felt that the commu-nal prayer \"increases concentration\", and two respondents did refer to the 'sound vibrations' produced by the communal recitation of the texts. One lady, Mrs FN (67), expressed herself in the following terms: I feel that at times often 'elation' feeling is there, you know. You feel that I am proud to be a Parsi and I am here with all so many praying together, it gives you that strength, I feel a moral strength in it, that's all. Possibly, for a miniscule community as the Parsis, the experience of a crowd of coreligionists gathering may indeed provide an experience of (communal) 'strength'. One interviewee, Mrs GW (63), clearly reflected the fact that communal prayers are indeed somewhat of an odd experi-ence in the Parsi context: Though there are too many people and we would feel hot, we would get dis-turbed, some pray in some manner, some others in another manner, yet I like it very much.... I have never seen this before—they are coming in such big numbers. For some others, though, the crowd seems to be a scaring experience, and a number of devotees have made it a point to visit the Banaji on Mondays while avoiding to come (or sitting outside) when the Humban-dagi is going on. In some instances, where Humbandagis are held, the prayers are fol-lowed by talks ('sermons'). Also Ervad Nalladaru started to give brief talks sometime after the Humbandagi sessions had taken roots.161 How-ever, later on—probably around 1998—he discontinued with the talks. Partly this was because he felt that preparing these talks created so much tension in him that it affected his health, and partly because a number of people were getting impatient, for they felt that the Humbandagi and the subsequent buoy-ceremony were unduly delayed by these lectures. This critical stance was also emphasised by one of our female interviewees, whereas according to Mr JP the talks \"used to actually pull the crowds 161 Judging from the recollections of our interviewees, these sermons were addressing a number of different issues. In part Ervad Nalladaru has conveyed very practical ad-vise, e.g., when to pray what (such as praying the Khorshed Niyayesh in order to please one's boss). At other times he seems to have talked about the formation of the planets. One interviewee reported that the priest had made a precise prediction about an earth-quake."},{"pageNumber":717,"pageContent":"previously\". He also felt that the 'sermons' should be restarted \"the sooner the better\". The priest and the blessings of the moon At this point, it may be appropriate to say some words on the biography and background of Ervad Nalladaru.'62 Aspi Faramroze Fardunji Nal-ladaru was born in Surat in 1930. His paternal uncle was the then head priest (dastur) of the Vakil Kadmi Atash Behram, where the Jal Bawa rituals took place since the early 20th century. In 1936, he had his Navjote done, i.e. he was initiated into the religion.163 Ervad Nalladaru's father, however, did not work as a priest, but as a weaving master and a dealer in silk fabrics. In that capacity he used to come to Bombay. There, at the Banaji, Aspi Nalladaru's first-grade initiation into priesthood (Nawar) was performed under the care and tutelage of the then managing trustee who at the gathering after the initiation would announce that he wanted to make the boy the temple's future buoywalla (priest responsi-ble for the ritual care of the fire). However, as he was about to perform the 101st birthday of the Banaji, Ervad Nalladaru got measles. In that way, his priestly career was briefly interrupted. His second-grade initia-tion into priesthood (Martab) was performed in 1945 at Surat's Vakil Kadmi Atash Behram. For a short while, he worked as a priest in the vil-lage of Siganpore near Surat. Back in Bombay, at the Banaji, the manag-ing trustee was facing some troubles with the buoywallas, and Ervad Nalladaru was made a buoywalla of the Atash Behram in 1946. At that time, there was no fixed salary for buoywallas. They had to live on the offerings made by the devotees. Since 1952 he was paid a regular salary. In 1996, when he completed 50 years of service, his salary was 1750 Rupees per month, which is a ridiculous amount when compared to 'secular' jobs. During the course of his service, Ervad Nalladaru per-formed virtually all priestly rituals including such complex ones as the Nirangdin—he did 20 Nirangdins—, the consecration of a new temple bull (varasyo), which he did thrice, and the shifting of the Atash Behram fire when the building was repaired (in 1960 and 1962). Ervad Aspi Nalladaru is married, has four children and several grandchildren. 162 The following account is based on Ervad Nalladaru's curriculum vitae and infor-mation provided by him during an interview with Mrs Marfatia on September 21st, 2000. 163 On the question, if the Navjote is properly classified as 'initiation' see Jan Snoek's contribution to this volume."},{"pageNumber":718,"pageContent":"Apart from this official and comparatively successful priestly career culminating in the Humbandagi (since 1993), there is another— complementary—side to his activity, and that is astrology.164 His father, the silk dealer, was an astrologer who would give free services four eve-nings a week and as Ervad Nalladaru recalled, long queues would be waiting outside. A paternal uncle of his, who was also a silk salesman, brought Ervad Nalladaru in touch with another reputed Parsi astrologer who would then teach him to draw charts (according to both Indian and foreign systems). Ervad Nalladaru himself offers astrological advice (free of charge, as he explicitly added). Apart from his astrological com-petencies, Ervad Nalladaru remarked that in his dreams he often gets 'warnings and good tidings', i.e. experiences of a divinatory kind. His commitment to and his reframing of the Humbandagi is the result of a fruitful combination of his priestly, astrological, and divinatory ex-periences. While the process leading to the introduction of the Humban-dagi by the trustees ofthe temple seems to be accidental from a historical perspective, in the eyes of the priest the opposite is true: In an article published in the Jame Jamsheed Weekly of August 28th 1994, Ervad Nal-ladaru recounts three divinatory experiences that had occurred to him at night inside the temple during his tum of service as buoywalla. In his eyes, all these experiences, which he links to the subsequent establish-ment of the Humbandagi—\"I was informed 48-49 years back about the start of Mondays at the Banaji Atashbehram\"165—, witness the power residing inside the temple and the power of the moon shining at night. Ervad Nalladaru even explains the somewhat mysterious timing of the Humbandagi—Mondays in the Aiwisruthrem geh—in astrological terms.166 For according to him, the Moon (Mah Bokhtar, Mah Yazad [the Moon Distributor, the Moon Divinity]) is the only planet that is 'suit-164 Mostly thanks to the studies of Antonio Panaino the significance of astrology in ancient Iranian culture and religion has recently found the attention it deserves (see, e.g. A.

Furthermore, he recounts that Dadar Hormazd (Ahura Maz-dah the Creator) had first given authority and control to the Sun, i.e. Khorshed Yazad. However, the Sun, Ervad Nalladaru explains, did real-ize that it (he) is not suitable to mankind because of its (his) heat and it (he) has to wander around from one celestial body to the next in 30 days. For this reason Khurshed Yazad selected a female divine being (farishta), the Moon, i.e. Mah Bokhtar Saheb. According to Ervad Nal-ladaru, the Moon with her \"most beautiful body in which coolness abounds\" and her \"great capacity for love\" distributes many blessings: She gives to the humans the strength to think, she causes good offspring to be born, she is the giver of happiness in married life, removes quarrels and bitterness, and causes the work to be done with love. In the presence of Mah Bokhtar humans can have enjoyment, can procure love, as a result of which good children can be born. She is a helper of women during their menstruation. If one chooses to have fun throughout the day then this is not possible, but if one chooses to have fun all night then it is possible because both serenity and love are given. She gives to a woman a good husband and to a man a virtuous wife. She gives a woman the status of a queen in her married life. She keeps her deco-rated with gold and jewellery. She gives a woman unlimited help. She is a provider of total happiness in the fields of music, dance, song, en-tertainment as also towards religion. She provides total help to a person during operations, accidents, or illness. And she assists in many such cases. The Humbandagi, then, is regarded as an effective means of distributing those blessings of the Moon (such as peace, enjoyment, joy, happiness, and help) to the worshipers. In order to safeguard that process, the timing of the event is crucial: it is held on Mondays, i.e. the day linked to the Moon (in the secular calendar), and in the evening geh, for Ervad Nalladaru argues that \"the strength of Mah Bokhtar Saheb increases after sunset\".167 The idea that the Moon is instrumental in distributing heavenly bless-ings to the earth is already attested in the Pahlavi literature.168 Apart 167 Ja me Jamshed Weekly, August 28th, 1994.

A New Persian text, the Sad dar Bondehes (56,1), has it that \"they should know that every benefit which the Creator Or-mazd bestows on the men of this world is (first) entrusted to the glorious moon and the moon bestows these benefits on men.\"169 The text con-cludes that everybody should recite the praise to the Moon when it is new moon (56,2). The Moon is also linked to certain vows (22,1 ; 44,28). Despite the continuity in the idea of the Moon being the Dispenser (Bokhtar) of blessings, different astrological parameters have obviously resulted in a transformation of the whole pattern. Be that as it may, judg-ing from our interaction with the participants this sort of a priestly justi-fication for the timing of the event, while providing a deep-structure plausibility is both unknown and irrelevant to the visitors, none of whom ever made any reference to the Moon. Visits and visitors When Parsiana published its cover story—roughly at the peak of the 'rit-ual of evocation'-period and shortly before the introduction of the Hum-bandagi—Parinaz Gandhi estimated that the event had almost 200 partici-pants.170 When I went to the Banaji on three consecutive Mondays in Sep-tember 2000 and once in February 2002, the numbers I counted were con-siderably higher. As matter of fact, the number had more than doubled. I did not restrict my counting to the number of people entering the compound—later on I realised that this would have greatly facilitated my work—, but my ambition was to count the people who were actually in-side the temple. The counting turned out to be a rather difficult undertak-ing, for, much to my surprise, I found that people were constantly mov-ing in and out ofthe temple; they did not just remain inside, once they had entered, but kept on coming out, before entering again,171 and this would recur many times. zum Manichäismus, Berlin, 14.-18.

Most devotees came rushing to the event between 6.30 and 7pm. According to my calculations, an average of 459 persons was attending the prayer meetings.172 That puts the number at around 0,85% of the en-tire Parsi population of Bombay. This extraordinary high number of weekly visitors is certainly benefi-cial for the persons who are deriving their income from the temple. Er-vad Nalladaru publicly addressed this aspect in an article published in the Jame Jamshed Weekly of December 7th, 1999: Now let us see what are the benefits of these Mondays. Firstly, whosoever it is—the watchman, or paniwalla173 or battiwalla174 or the buoywalla, everyone earns some money and a good quantity of sandal-wood is offered to the Atash Padshah saheb. So even the sandalwood seller earns. On all four occasions when I made attempts at counting the number of devotees, there was an almost equal distribution by gender, whereas the number of children was clearly below 3%. Remarkably, however, the youth of the community is very well represented among the participants, and several among the younger people give the event a particular flair in that they stay on at the spot after the Humbandagi. They are meeting their friends,175 chatting, presenting their vehicles, dresses and hair-cuts—while obviously enjoying themselves.176 One interviewee, Mrs YP (48) stressed the importance of the social dimension of the gathering, when she said: 172 September 11th, 2000: 427 persons; September 18th, 2000: 462 persons; Septem-ber 25th, 2000: 435 persons; February 24th, 2002: 511 persons. I have no clear idea why the number on the last-mentioned date was ( 10-20%) higher than on the previous occa-sions. It may have happened by chance, it may have been the season—or the event has become even more popular during the intervening period of one and a half years. 173 The 'paniwalla' fills water (pani) into the containers storing the water that is used for the ritual ablutions. 174 The 'battiwalla' prepares the oil-lamps (batti) that are lit by the devotees. 175 One 17 year old respondent explicitly mentioned 'meet friends later' as an attrac-tion to the event. 176 One interviewee, a gentleman of 33, voiced the opinion that \"they should improve in their dressing. They are visiting the Atash Padshah, they are visiting Agiaries and Athashbehrams, they should have a bit of sense what they wear and come. [Mrs Mar-fatia inquires if he was specifically referring to the girls.] Not only the girls, I tell you, to the boys also, you see they wear some pyjamas with checks, long T-shirts, they do not have a cap on their head ... at least some decency should be maintained, some re-spect has to be given, you are not attending a disco or a party\"."},{"pageNumber":722,"pageContent":"At least community-wise you are meeting together and the young generation is also coming, it is good, means because in our community gathering is not there, and our children are being converted by the Catholics. One long-time regular—a gentleman of 33 who has come for 10 years— did refer to the event as a meeting place for youngsters and old people and emphasised the gossip prior to and after the Humbandagi.177 One lady of 60 said that she 'likes the atmosphere' of the place. However, when asked about what attracts them to the Banaji on Monday nights and in what way their participation in the event had been beneficial to them, almost all respondents predominantly referred to reli-gious or spiritual motives and experiences. Apart from the experience of praying together, the idea of 'peace of mind' turned out to be a major stimulus for many people to attend.178 This idea is also referred to and partly promoted by Ervad Nalladaru, when he, in the above-mentioned article published in the Jame Jamshed Weekly of December 7th, 1999, highlights the following benefit of the Humbandagi: Secondly, every devotee comes here with some form of problem. Some have problems of children, some marital, some with society or monetary problems, court cases or health, etc and which have been helped by the Atash padshah saheb's blessings. They have received peace of mind and are still getting all those blessings from the Atash padshah saheb ... Hence, the priest is well aware that the people come with specific prob-lems on their mind,179 and just as with the Aslaji, many people place their hopes in the Banaji, and from the Jal Bawa-events the Humbandagi has inherited the expectation that problems can be solved in a miraculous fashion. As a matter of fact, out of 46 respondents who commented on that topic, 7 (15%) mentioned miracles as an important factor attracting them to the Hambandagi.180 Reports about 'miracles' and 'things hap-pening' also came to the forefront in two interviews.181 Independently of 177 One interviewee, however, lamented: \"gossiping has increased\". 178 20 out of 46 people (= 43%) who commented on this issue, mentioned 'peace of mind', mostly in combination with 'praying together' (and other options). 179 See also the statement by the other Kadmi priest quoted in full above. 180 One lady (34), however, who is not a regular, voiced exactly the opposite opinion: \"I do not believe in Humbandagi with these brief prayers—miracles will not happen. Any prayer will help.\" She wants to say that any ordinary prayer has the same power as the Humbandagi. 181 One interviewee stated: \"That was a miracle ... for me after the prayers I had re-cited\" [at the Banaji].

However, even many among those respondents, who did not explic-itly refer to 'miracles', were clearly convinced that the Humbandagi is an efficacious event. They claimed that their participation has borne results and that it has helped them in different ways. These beneficial aspects can be expressed in rather general terms such as 'wishes fulfilled', 'gen-eral help', 'bad time has gone away', 'it definitely helps in an unknown way', 'now showing the way more clearly'. As one interviewee put it: \"things improve, it does not harm\". 8 respondents mentioned concrete results: 'good marks' (at school), 'passed exams', 'sobered down', 'brother's transfer was stopped', 'bene-fit in health', 'speedy recovery', 'saved from accident', 'helped in job', 'financial help' (by getting a house), leg troubles, and a son who married a Parsi girl. Some respondents, it must be said, explicitly denied the intention of obtaining any reward ofthat type. For them it is 'faith' alone that mat-ters, the feeling that 'something good is got', that it 'feels nice' or that they are simply fulfilling a religious duty. Not everybody, it should be stated, asks boons for himself, but often wishes are made for others (mostly family-members), and at least one respondent frankly admitted that the desired aim has not (yet) been achieved: the trouble has not been solved.183 From some remarks it becomes clear that a number of people every Monday I want some miracle to happen...\" 182 One respondent claimed that this story had been reported in the Mumbai Sa-machar, a Parsi newspaper read by many Gujarati business-people. 183 This interviewee (Mr FB) expressed a rather inconsistent attitude towards the event. On the one hand he is highly critical towards any attempts of \"ordering God or blackmailing God\". He described himself as \"a firm believer\" and he professed: \"1 just go in a nice way when the Humbandagi is there.\" On the other hand, though, he frankly admits that he initially came with a specific purpose: \"... in fact coincidentally it hap-pened that I had some housing problem which I was doing and that's the reason I went to Atashbehram and I said 'lets go to the Atashbehram' and my wife said 'yes' and since this is there, we went on one Monday and it became a habit to go on, to continue.\" Later on he admitted: \"To be completely honest, for what I had gone, it has not happened yet.\""},{"pageNumber":724,"pageContent":"connect their visits to the Banaji to oaths.184 Among our respondents, the majority were regulars.185 An over-whelming majority of them (36 out of 44 [81%]) kept on coming for more than a year, and two third (29/44 [65%]) for more than two years. Significantly, however, even among those who came for less than a year, some mentioned that they were coming regularly, if not always. In other words, they have already made it a habit. Somebody (63) expressed the desire to make it at least to 11 consecutive visits. In this way, a constant flow of new participants is added to the fold of the participants. Hence, it seems that the event is not under threat of dying out. Among those who have recently joined the event, some express feel-ings of attachment in that they 'bother' in case they are for some reason or another unable to attend. For that case, 12 (= 42%) out of 28 visitors expressed negative feelings such as 'feeling bad', 'guilty', 'unhappy', 'uncomfortable', 'bothering' or 'missing something'. 8 respondents (= 29%) mentioned strategies of compensation such as coming on another day or earlier on Monday, saying the prayers at home from the booklet or asking somebody else to put sandalwood on their behalf. Another 29%, however, including some long-time regulars, felt that missing the Hum-badagi had no great effect on them. Apart from some respondents who did not comment on this issue, all respondents pray at least once a day (51% [25 out of 49]), if not twice (29% [14/49]) or even three times (20% [10/49]). Moreover, with one single exception (plus one who did not give any statement to this ques-tion), all respondents occasionally or regularly attend other fire-temples apart from the Banaji. The different temples mentioned by the respon-dents indicate that many come from the suburbs (such as Andheri, Ban-dra, Dadar, Jogeshwari). Significantly, however, the temple mentioned most frequently was the Aslaji (it was mentioned explicitly by 19%, but may be implied by others as well). As a matter of fact, there probably is a good deal of cross-linking between the Aslaji and the Banaji, for more than half of our respondents from the Aslaji reported that they go to the Banaji on Mondays. 184 One interviewee (Mrs YP) stated: \"my husband had suffered an accident, so I had taken an oath that if he gets OK, I would do 108\" [visits to the Humbandagi]. 185 11% stated that come sporadically or occasionally. Among the regular visitors, some claimed that they come 'always' (in some cases since 6-7 years)."},{"pageNumber":725,"pageContent":"Moreover, almost half (47%) of our respondents also attended non-Zoroastrian sanctuaries.186 Some respondents remarked that they went to some places out of curiosity once or twice, or just in order to accompany friends. Others, however, said to 'respect all religions', or 'believe in all' and to have 'no hesitation'. The distribution of the non-Parsi places is similar to the picture drawn by the respondents from the Aslaji. How-ever, some differences emerge: Most popular among the Banaji-respondents is Mount Mary—19% [Aslaji: 15%] of the respondents, mostly females, have been there, and many go there regularly—, closely followed by the Sai Baba sanctuary at Shirdi (17% [Aslaji: 19%]). The local Sai Baba mandirs and St. Michael's are equally attractive (8% each [Aslaji: 12% each]). Compared to the Aslaji, more people (9% [Aslaji: 5%]) visit the Siddhi Vinyak (Ganpathi) temple. Two respondents men-tioned that they had gone to the Muslim dargah of Haji Ali, and some people referred to 'other' places. There is neither a correlation of the frequency of visits to non-Zoroastrian places with the frequency of visits to the Banaji, nor with the frequency of prayer, age or gender of the participants. It should be men-tioned, however, that those who also attend non-Zoroastrian sanctuaries are not the miracle-seekers, i.e. those who have mentioned miracles as a major force attracting them to the Banaji. BY WAY OF A CONCLUSION To many readers, the fact that roughly half of our respondents are in some way or the other involved in different forms of non-Zoroastrian religious practice may come as somewhat of a surprise. However, while there are no reliable statistics on this question, judging from conversa-tions with a good number of Parsis over the years, I am not inclined to 187 believe that our respondents are in any way exceptional in this respect. Obviously, in a city like Bombay, exposure to non-Zoroastrian religious practice is hard to avoid. Already in the early 19th century, the Bombay Parsi Punchayat, the main body representing the Parsis to the govern-186 The number is slightly less compared to the respondents at the Aslaji (58%). 187 Kreyenbroek, Living Zoroastrianism, p. 296 states that \"[observances with non-Zoroastrian associations ... were mentioned by some of those we interviewed.\" This creates the idea that these were a minority. However, as far as I can see, Mrs Munshi did not make a systematic attempt to touch upon this issue in the interviews she conducted. Possibly (or indeed probably), the topic may have come up in more interviews had she done so."},{"pageNumber":726,"pageContent":"ment, made repeated attempts to curtail the adherence to non-Zoroastrian practices among the Parsis, especially the ladies.188 There is some evi-dence to the fact that the participation in non-Zoroastrian religious prac-tice also occurred, and still occurs, in Gujarat,189 but possibly it did and does so to a lesser extent. While the Parsis are free to attend many non-Zoroastrian places, non-Zoroastrians are prohibited from directly sharing Zoroastrian practices.190 Within the orbit of the Parsi community, however, the two Bombay fire-temples studied in this paper partly function according to a pattern simi-lar to many of the city's most popular sanctuaries in that both are held to be particular efficacious on one particular day of the week. In different ways, this posits them both inside and outside of the confined area of Zoroastrian ritual practice. In both cases, we are dealing with official, time-honoured places. In both cases, what goes on at these places is backed by the relevant religious authorities (the priests and the trustees). Hence, we are dealing with 'genuine', 'authentic' Zoroastrian develop-ments.191 On the other hand, though, the relevant ritual forms do not quite match the patterns provided by traditional Zoroastrian ritualistic. In both cases, contemporary history allows us to perceive ongoing elabora-tions, modifications and transformations over a period of several dec-ades.192 188 See J.R.B. Jeejeebhoy, \"Communal Discipline among the Bombay Parsees in Olden Times\", MP. Kharegat Memorial Volume I. A Symposium on Indo-Iranian and Allied Subjects (Bombay, 1953), pp. 295-323, p. 305. 189 For some instances see Stausberg, Die Religion Zarathushtras, vol. 2, pp. 89-99. 190 However, indirectly they may share in the blessings produced by Zoroastrian ritu-als, e.g. by having sandalwood offered to a fire through Parsi mediation. 191 In the case of the Banaji, the priest offers an astrological reasoning for the event. In the case of the Aslaji there are mythological roots. 192 On the distinction between 'modification' and 'transformation' in ritual change see J. Kreinath, \"Theoretical Afterthoughts\", The Dynamics of Changing Rituals. The Transformation of Religious Rituals within their Social and Religions Context, eds J. Kreinath/C. Hartung/A. Deschner (Toronto Studies in Religion; New York, in press): \"a modification is a change in ritual whereas in transformation is a change of ritual.\" In the case of the Banaji, we are dealing with both kinds of ritual change. Whereas we would from an emic perspective tend to describe the transition from the Jal Bawa ritual of in-vocation to the Humbandagi ritual of communal devotion as an instance of ritual trans-formation, from an emic perspective this development would rather appear as a modifi-cation. In his essay Kreinath also introduces some other concepts that might fruitfully be (and indeed have been implicitly) applied to the present contexts. I am here thinking of the concepts of continuity and discontinuity (describing the temporal dimension of ritual change), the distinction \"between changes of which participants are aware or un-"},{"pageNumber":727,"pageContent":"While both places attract large crowds on a specific day of the week, this is connected to two different ritual formats: Individual devotion throughout the day (and an expert of the divine after 4pm) at the Aslaji, communal worship—first by evoking a mysterious figure and later by singing songs and praying spells—at a specific time of the day at the Ba-naji. While the visitors to the Aslaji pray and make offerings at a fire and may also consult an expert of the divine, the hundreds flocking to the Banaji on Monday-nights are actors and participants in a ritual event. The design of this event picks up and at the same time transforms threads of established ritual forms. In unprecedented ways, what goes on at both places testifies to the productive vitality ofZoroastrian traditions. Once again, contemporary religious history turns out to be a transforma-tion rather than a decline of religions, religiosity, and ritual practice. The same can be said about the implications of urbanisation for relig-ion. Often, it is assumed that urbanisation is dysfunctional for religion. This should then be particularly true for such a megalopolis as Bombay that is known to be an industrious business-centre. Contrary to received wisdom, however, this does not necessarily imply that its inhabitants, the Bombayites, are an irreligious lot. Quite to the contrary, one may even put forward the hypothesis that the perils and the stress invoked by a city like Bombay may give rise to needs for safety and security, which are often handled in a religious manner. In other words, it may well be the case that a 'secular city' like Bombay with its extreme living-conditions in terms of pollution, over-crowding, transport, family-structures and housing creates very concrete needs that, for many people concerned, are (still) most efficiently catered for by religious practices. These needs range from problems affecting health, money, marriage and social status to a lack of 'peace of mind'. In this perspective, the two phenomena studied here can be read as developments in religious practice, which are specific to the urban setting. While it is certainly true that \"a strong sense of the menacing reality of the powers of evil disappeared\"193 in contem-porary Zoroastrian history, the need for divine protection and assistance is as vital as ever and it is dealt with in ritual formats such as those stud-ied in this paper. When seen in this light, these phenomena can be grouped together with some other rituals mentioned, such as the Mushkel Aasan (Behram Yazad) or the recitation of the Afsun-e Shah Faridun-ni nirang and the aware of' and the fact that changes may be \"intended or unintended by the practitioner\". 193 Kreyenbroek, Living Zoroastrianism, p. 294."},{"pageNumber":728,"pageContent":"Behram Yasht. All these rituals, ritual acts, ritual events and ritual places have one thing in common: they address, and are by many participants even judged to solve problems of a very tangible and practical sort.194 In our case, the traditional religion supplies the 'spaces' (and the 'texture') to deal with these issues in a ritual fashion that is elaborated upon in dif-ferent ways. The phenomena studied here are held to be effective means to obtain divine help and assistance for the actors/participants them-selves (or their relations)—and not so much for the souls and spirits of the deceased who are in the focus ofthe traditional priestly rituals. This shifting emphasis also lies behind the different timings of the events. While rituals such as the Yasna and the Bäj-dharnä are performed on the anniversaries or other memorial days of the ancestors—hence in the time set by the ancestors—, the Aslaji and the Banaji attract their devotees on specific days of the week—hence in the very time-frame that also gov-erns their 'daily' life. However, apart from their (ascribed) capacity to solve pressing prob-lems, the phenomena presented and discussed here supply ritual frames to obtain religious satisfaction, and the Humbandagi at the Banaji clearly illustrates the process of ritual transformation which enabled the event to accommodate different dimensions of ritual practice and at the same time to address different religious needs and expectations. All this clearly invites for and challenges ideas and theories about emotions, par-ticipation, agency, and efficacy in rituals, a discussion of which, how-ever, would go beyond the scope of this paper (and the limits of this book). 194 For Iranian Zoroastrianism, the sofreh-ui\\i&\\s and the shrines can be seen in the same perspective; see the papers by Sabine Kalinock and Robert Langer."},{"pageNumber":729,"pageContent":"APPENDIX: BIO-SKETECHES OF SIX MAJOR RESPONDENTS Mr FB: 35 years of age, originally not from Bombay; now stays in a posh Parsi living colony; married, no children; graduated in commerce; self-employed in gift items business; has mostly Parsi friends; has for some time been actively involved in the Pundolist movement;195 attends the Humbandagi \"maybe for a year\", accompanied by his wife (unless she has her period) and occasionally his mother and siblings.

Boyd / Ron G. Williams (Fort Collins) The Art of Ritual in a Comparative Context What form (or forms) might an adequate aesthetic approach to ritual take? This essay addresses this question by juxtaposing observations about Zoroastrian and Shinto ritual traditions with an analysis of a recent Western artwork by Christo. After briefly contrasting the two world views that provide contexts for understanding the Zoroastrian and Shinto liturgies, examples are given of how the aesthetic dimensions of the liturgies mirror these two perspectives. Implica-tions of such an approach for the role of aesthetics in ritual theory are noted: it privileges thought over practice and assumes that aesthetic features of the litur-gies can be isolated and explored on their own. An analysis of the aesthetic and ritualistic features of Christo's art provides an analogy that hints at a more satis-factory approach to the study of art in ritual. Christo's Running Fence Project suggests that a ritual artwork can be understood as a multiplicity of incommen-surable dimensions (in Gilles Deleuze's technical sense of \"multiplicity\"), and demonstrates how a ritual artwork requires a context yet maintains a sui generis function. The potential for such an analytic approach to the study of artful ritu-als is briefly explored by applying it to selected features of the Zoroastrian Äf-rinagän and Shinto morning service in order to suggest how each of these ritu-als, viewed as multiplicities, contains aesthetic and non-aesthetic dimensions that interact to produce transformation. Carlo G. Cereti (Rome) Prejudice vs. Reality. Zoroastrians and their Rituals as seen by two 19th Century Italian Travellers This paper summarizes the accounts on the Zoroastrian community in Bombay written by two Italian scholars, the Indologist Angelo De Gubernatis and the Anthropologist Paolo Mantegazza. Both were active in Florence in the late 19th century. (De Gubernatis later moved to Rome though.) By analysing their ac-counts, the author attempts to illustrate the representation of the Parsis then current in Italy. Moreover, the author analyses the stereotypes, which were put into, and discusses their possible correspondence with reality. Here, the focus is mainly on ritual. Thus, the paper discusses De Gubernatis' description of a Yasna ceremony that was performed explicitly for him in a Zoroastrian club-house and the vivid picture that he gives of the Parsis praying out in the open. Furthermore, the paper outlines Mantegazza's interesting, though unorthodox, * The abstracts were kindly provided by the authors, unless indicated otherwise."},{"pageNumber":731,"pageContent":"description of the funeral customs of the community.

Burkhard Gladigow (Tübingen) Sequenzierung von Riten und die Ordnung der Rituale (Sequencing Rites and the Order of Rituals) Typical structures of rituals have been a feature of ritual studies since Marcel Mauss. However, a further attempt to sequence rituals has so far never been made. This programmatic essay presents a systematic analysis of a sequential order of ritual elements. As such, it goes beyond the well-known distinctions between different phases in rituals for it is only by sequencing as many rites as possible (on the level of ritual elements) that specific constellations emerge, which hitherto remained largely inconceivable. These constellations pertain to sequences of rites that are 'quoted' in other rituals, a connection between rituals by means of similar ritual sequences ('interrituality'), shortened forms of ritual sequences ('abbreviations'), and, last but not least, incorporations of rites into more extended rituals ('complexity'). A sequencing of rituals according to this scheme may indicate to what extent the composition of rituals is the result of a process of professionalisation. An increasing degree of professionalisation on the one hand results in an increased demand to control the accuracy of the ritual performances and on the other hand to take into account the reactions of par-ticipants and audience. Here, it is important that the participants and the audi-ence are transformed and that they 'learn' something in the course of the tem-poral unfolding of a complex ritual. (Transi.

It argues that the Younger Avestan eulogistic portions of the Yasna are informed by, or indeed dependent on the YH. It examines the place of the seven-chapter Yasna in the seventy-two chapter Yasna and in the two other Zoroastrian high liturgies, which are based on the Yasna, namely the Visperad and Vendidad ceremonies. The Visperad and Vendidad ceremonies, in which the Yasna Haptaqhäiti is recited twice, give prominence to that text by the way the karde of the Visperad and the fargard of the Videvdad are inserted in between the häiti of the Yasna. The ΥΉ constitutes the centre and highpoint of each of the three Zoroastrian high liturgies, a position interpreted as indicating that the YH is the focal text of Zoroastrian high ritual. This view derives further support from an examination ofthe usage of the word yasna- in the Avesta, as a result of which emerges that, throughout the time Avestan texts were composed, the Yasna Haptaqhäiti was perceived as the Worship, or yasna-, par excellence and provided the model for the Younger Avestan eulogistic invocations characterized by the verb yazamaidë 'we worship'. Moreover, this article argues that the Ritual of the Waters (âb zôhr) is also influenced by the worship of the Waters in the YH. Dietrich Huff (Berlin) Archaeological Evidence of Zoroastrian Funerary Practices The Zoroastrian practice of exposure of the dead seems to have become com-pulsory in Iran during Sasanian times (3rd to 7th centuries). Archaeological evi-dence for this practice is scarce. Apart from some individual types, most monuments were developed from the royal Achaemenian tombs in Pasargadae and Naqsh-i Rustam. These were obviously designed for the disposal of com-plete bodies. However, having high substructures of stones or being placed high up in a rocky cliff, they obviously represent an attempt to avoid the pollution of earth and water. The best-known types of bone receptacles are rock-chamber tombs. In the course of history, they diminished in size from the royal rock tombs via the so-called Median rock tombs to the tiny niches in Fars. Pahlavi inscriptions on those niches identify them as dakhma, a general term for a tomb. Some inscriptions carry late Sasanian and early Islamic dates. Almost identical inscriptions denote small rock-cut troughs as dakhmas. This type of funeral boxes evidently derived from large rock-cut sacrophagi in the royal Achaemenian rock-tombs. Moreover, there are embellished sub-species of the trough dakhmas. These are free-standing rock-cut monuments like the twin re-ceptacles at Naqsh-i Rustam and others, wrongly held to be fire-altars. Apart from that, there were other free-standing, constructed monuments of different"},{"pageNumber":733,"pageContent":"types such as Tang-i Karam and Nurabad. After the Arab conquest, the for-merly open exposure sites had to be surrounded with walls, and finally a central pit became the common bone receptacle. The whole arrangement was now called dakhma. Different buildings nearby served for funeral ceremonies, in-cluding a chamber for a dakhma fire or lamp. Archaeological traces in front of ancient dakhmas indicate that rituals for the souls of the deceased were per-formed in antiquity as well. Anders Hultgârd (Uppsala) Ritual Community Meals in ancient Iranian Religion Ritual community meals in ancient Iranian religion are incompletely known and this paper makes an attempt to elucidate this phenomenon. The concept of (re-ligious) 'ritual/cultic community meal' is discussed and a definition is pro-posed. From a methodological point of view, it is problematic to explain an-cient rituals by referring to current practice because rituals and the meaning of terms pertaining to rituals have changed over time. The survey of ancient source-materials starts with rituals that indicate the enactment of community meals such as the yasna, drôn, usôfrit and äfrinagän ceremonies. Then the dif-ferent settings in which ritual community meals were or might have been per-formed are discussed (the Gähänbärs and other periodic festivals, funerary rituals and other settings). It seems that the Middle Iranian term mëzd, apart from other connotations, has been used to denote the ritual community meal. The picture of cultic community meals that emerges from passages in the Avesta, the Pahlavi texts, Graeco-Roman literature and Albiruni shows the im-portance of such rituals as a means of redistributing the sacrificial offerings. Some remarks on the structure and meaning of ritual community meals con-clude the paper. Albert de Jong (Leiden) Sub Specie Maiestatis: Reflections on Sasanian Court Rituals The Sasanian Empire (3rd to 7th centuries CE), is generally seen as a \"Zoroas-trian\" state. Most Sasanian kings are therefore represented, in the historical tra-dition and in modern scholarship, as kings with a profound commitment to their religion. The exact relations between religious and state organisations and ide-ologies in the Sasanian period, however, are by no means clear. The present article attempts to shed some light on this question by analysing information on court ceremonial, deriving mainly from the Islamic tradition. As was the case in many contemporary cultures, the special position of the king in the state organi-sation found an expression in a large number of rules for behaviour at court that distinguished the king as much from his subjects as possible. Since these rules seem to have been shared by the contemporary Byzantines and flowed into Is-lamic court culture, the question of the religious background or sanction of Sa-"},{"pageNumber":734,"pageContent":"sanian court ceremonial becomes very urgent. Several aspects of court ceremo-nial suggest that neither the concept of \"divine kingship\" nor the indigenous category of xwarrah (\"royal glory\") seem to have been very prominent, but that the rituals associated with the king are an expression of the Zoroastrian notion that piety and morality reveal themselves in the life of every individual and, on a very grand scale, in the righteousness and wealth of the king. Sabine Kalinock (.Frankfurt) Supernatural Intercession to Earthly Problems: sofreh Rituals among Shiite Muslims and Zoroastrians in Iran Despite profound differences in the religious doctrines of Zoroastrians and Shi-ite Muslims in Iran one can also discover similarities. One religious tradition that the Zoroastrian minority and the Shiite majority have in common is the sofreh, a ritual meal dedicated to supernatural beings or a saint. In both com-munities, it is a marginal ritual performed mainly by women, which is disap-proved by the primarily male religious orthodoxy. The article examines the sof-rehs as an expression of female experiences. The women reproduce their tradi-tional roles as nurturers of their families and use their skills to get into contact with the supernatural in order influence these forces for their own interest. The women's main concern is the making of vows (nazr). The reference to a higher reality enables the women to agency. It is argued that the women have created for themselves a space where they can express their thoughts, hopes and feel-ings and negotiate them with others. Zoroastrian and Muslim women share a lot of common experiences and aspirations as women living in a patriarchal soci-ety. The participation of Zoroastrian as well as Muslim women in the official rituals and their access to religious positions is limited. Thus women in both groups have developed their own rituals, which reflect autonomy, creativity and power. Ramiyar P. Karanjia (Mumbai / Heidelberg) The Bäj-dharnä (Drön Yast) and its Place in Zoroastrian Rituals. This paper on the Bäj-dharnä (previously, Drön Yast), a Zoroastrian ritual, be-gins with explaining the role of rituals in Zoroastrian tradition. At the outset the term Bäj-dharnä is explained and the different words used to describe the ritual are examined. The ritual is then described in perspective and its important role in the contemporary Parsi life is considered. The paper examines the various purposes for which the ritual is performed and the different divine beings in-voked for various performances. Other aspects of the ritual like the duration of performance, the qualifications of the priest, the merit of the ritual, time at which the ritual can be performed and the posture required of the priests while performing the ritual are also discussed. Moreover, the paper gives a brief de-scription of the various requisites needed in order to perform the ritual, and"},{"pageNumber":735,"pageContent":"discusses the ritual acts performed during the Bäj-dharnä. The textual structure of the texts recited during the ritual is analysed and the fixed and variable com-ponents of the text are identified. The paper then gives a brief history of the Bäj-dharnä-ritual and the various Pahlavi texts in which it is dealt with at length. Finally, by examining various criteria, an attempt is made to ascertain whether the Bäj-dharnä belongs to the categories of 'Outer' or 'Inner' rituals into which Zoroastrian priestly rituals are currently divided in India. Jean Kellens (Paris) Les précautions rituelles et la triade du comportement (Ritual precautions and the Triad of Behaviour) A philological investigation of Y. 1,21-22 comes to the conclusion that this for-mula does not express a general idea, but rather constitutes a ritual precaution in order to ward off imperfections that may have occurred while reciting chapters 0 and 1 of the Yasna. Y. 0,4 and Y. 11,17—both verses are identical—manifest a similar concern. In all these passages, the triad thought/word/action pertains to rituals rather than to ethics. (Transi. Michael Stausberg) Firoze M. Kotwal / Jamsheed Κ Choksy (Mumbai / Bloomington) To Praise the Souls of the Deceased and the Immortal Spirits of the Righteous Ones: The Staomi or Stum Ritual's History and Functions This article examines historical, theological, and performative aspects of a rit-ual of praise still popular among Zoroastrians. The introduction commences by tracing developments in the technical term, staoma- or stüm, of the ritual. Next, various Avestan or scriptural passages that refer to the ritual are discussed briefly. The ritual's history and historiography—from Achaemenian times to the present—are outlined in the following section. The theological meanings of the ritual as associated with the concept of order, with the notion of death of the body as a temporary state, with the notion of the immortality of the soul and spirit, with the belief that each soul and spirit should be propitiated by living humans, and with the notion that each act of praise receives reciprocation, are analyzed within textual and doctrinal contexts. Then the five stage ritual proc-ess itself—from the dedicatory formula through the rite and recitations to the closing statement—is documented and explained in conjunction with texts, translations, and visual depictions of an actual performance. Thereafter, the occasions on which the ritual is performed and the food offerings that are con-secrated on each occasion are scrutinized, as are variations in performance at various locales and at different times. Again, visual documentation from an actual performance is presented. Finally, concluding remarks return to the con-tinued relevance of the stüm ritual to the lives of Zoroastrians."},{"pageNumber":736,"pageContent":"Jens Kreinath (Heidelberg) Meta-Theoretical Parameters for the Analysis and Comparison of Two Recent Approaches to the Study of the Yasna This paper discusses the approaches of William R. Darrow and Ron G. Williams & James W. Boyd to the study of the Yasna. In focusing on such meta-theoretical parameters as methodology, logic of design, and discourse it is possible to analyze and compare these semiotic and aesthetic approaches. As tools for the meta-theoretical analysis and comparison, such terms as 'empirical data', 'analytical concepts' and 'discursive contexts' with their complex and interdependent relationships are introduced. Using these tools, it is shown how these approaches are shaped through the empirical data presented on a videotape, how they are constructed by use of a set of analytical concepts and how they participate in the different discursive contexts of ritual studies. In relating these mutually dependent components, it is argued that although the above-mentioned approaches study the same empirical data they construct different theoretical approaches while using similar analytical concepts. They use these concepts differently, because they address different discursive contexts and are therefore concerned with different theoretical issues. These parameters enable one to see—from a different perspective—how theoretical approaches work within a particular field of research, how they are constructed, and how they are situated within the particular contexts of scholarly discourse. Philip G. Kreyenbroek (Göttingen) Ritual and Rituals in the Nërangestân The Nërangestân is a text dealing with questions of ritual, which clearly formed part of the learned tradition ofthe Zoroastrian priesthood. The core of the text is in the ancient sacred language known as Avestan, with translations into Mid-dle Persian. Furthermore, the text contains lengthy additional comments by scholar-priests. These reflect the realities of contemporary ritual practice, thus affording some insights into the way Zoroastrian priests understood the nature of rituals, and sought to solve any problems that might occur. Moreover, the text suggests that several ceremonies, which are mentioned as separate rituals in the Middle Persian literature, in fact represent variations on a standard se-quence of liturgical texts and ritual actions. Another conclusion to be drawn from the evidence of the Nërangestân is that the Yasts (hymns to various divine beings which are now regarded as independent prayers and do not form part of any ritual), could be recited as part of a short rite on the day ofthe month when the divinity in question received special worship. This helps to explain the links between the Yasts and the 'calendar divinities', and also the fact that these texts have been preserved as part of the living tradition."},{"pageNumber":737,"pageContent":"Robert Langer (Heidelberg) From Private Shrine to Pilgrimage Centre: The Spectrum of Zoroastrian Shrines in Iran In Iran one finds numerous Zoroastrian shrines, the so-called pïr (pl.: pirän). Most of these shrines are connected with one of the Zoroastrian divine beings (ïzedân) or other mythological characters. In contrast with the Muslim context, neither the place nor the term refer to 'saintly persons'. Nevertheless, it is pro-posed that Zoroastrian and Muslim shrines share common roots and a history of mutual influence. Hence, Zoroastrian shrines have to be seen in the larger con-text of a common 'Iranian' culture of shrine worship and 'folk religious' prac-tice. Historical data on the shrines prior to the 20th Century is rare. Evaluating literary sources and ethnographic approaches (during two fieldtrips to Iran in 2001), the present author attempted to survey all historical and recent Zoroas-trian shrines. This data is used to place the pïrs in their socio-historical context and to describe the activities ('rituals') which are conducted at and in connec-tion with the shrines. The rituals encompass acts of individual devotion, com-munal festivities, and collective pilgrimages. The main section of the paper proposes a classification of Zoroastrian shrines along spatio-geographical and architectural criteria, which reflect the different social and religious functions of the pïrs. Typical examples of different 'private', 'local', 'trans-local', and 're-gional shrines', as well as 'pilgrimage centres' are discussed and illustrated with pictures. In concluding it is argued that the pirän are an important means for establishing contemporary Iranian-Zoroastrian identity. Dorothea Lüddeckens (Heidelberg) Bruch und Kontinuität in Todesritualen. Beobachtungen zu westeuro-päischen und zoroastrischen Bestattungen (Break and Continuity in Death Rituals. Some Observations on Western European and Zoroastrian Burial) Death always confronts the survivors with an experience of both rupture and continuity. The manifold possibilities of communication, which are inherent in the relationship with a physically living human being, are broken off. At the same time however a certain continuity beyond death is provided through memories and the goods which the deceased has left behind. Death rituals offer the opportunity to analyze structures which express both the rupture and the continuity and render both experiences perceptible, though the respective de-gree of significance accorded to the two modalities for experiencing death can vary greatly. In Western European death rituals, one observes a marked de-crease in the construction of rupture upon the death-event during the last cen-tury. At the same time, however, the constructions of continuity in the sense of a life-after-death were also on the decline. Recently new and alternative funeral"},{"pageNumber":738,"pageContent":"practices are once again showing strong structures of both rupture and continu-ity. One can observe the same in the death ritual of the Parsees in contemporary Mumbai: On the one hand the disposal of corpses in \"Towers of Silence\" signi-fies a banning of the dead from world-space and even more: their \"Ent-räumlichung\" ('de-spacialisation') - and thus a strong construction of rupture. At the same time, the ritual link between the survivors and the souls of the dead indicates a strong construction of continuity. This would suggest that strong constructions of rupture and continuity are reciprocally conditioned. Katayun Mazdapour (Teheran) Kontinuität und Wandel in den Ritualen der iranischen Zarathustrier (Continuity and Change in the Rituals of the Iranian Zoroastrians) A ritual consists of several elements and at the same time it makes up a generic unity that puts the single elements in relation to each other. Hence, ritual change can be located on three levels: changes concerning single elements within rituals, the increase or decrease of elements within rituals, and changes pertaining to the place and function of single elements within overriding ritual units. These changes can be brought about by single actors, but they ultimately depend on social forces and circumstances. In the modern period, when the Ira-nian Zoroastrian community came to be dominated by persons who affirmed Western ideas and values, the mental order, on which the ancient rituals were based, was destroyed. Other factors leading to a change in rituals were new ur-ban environments and new forms of social interactions and relationships. This process of ritual change, which to a large extent can be seen as an accommoda-tion to new intellectual, social, urban and economic environments, was not fought against but rather embraced by the priesthood. There were two main periods of ritual change: the 1950s and the war against Iraq (1980-1988). The main part of the paper presents a survey comparing current ritual practice with written prescriptions contained in the old normative scriptures, mainly the säyest- nësâyest. This survey is divided into nine sections: the priests and the 'official rituals'; funeral ceremonies; vows; practices pertaining to menstruation and birth; individual rituals and prayers; the main rituals of purifications; festi-vals; elements of rituals and smaller ritual acts (microrituals). The conclusion emphasizes the accommodative power of the rituals and its single elements and the open-mindedness of the priesthood warranting the diversity and change of the rituals and thereby guaranteeing their continuity in new forms, environ-ments and roles. [Michael Stausberg] Antonio Panaino (Bologna!Ravenna) Aspects of the 'Interiorization' of the Sacrifice in the Zoroastrian Tradition The first part of this article analyzes different meanings of the Avestan verb yaz- (\"to worship, consecrate and sacrifice\", both in the sense of \"immolation\""},{"pageNumber":739,"pageContent":"as well as in its \"symbolic\" results). The paper argues that the speculative di-mension of the Zoroastrian ritual (yasna-) is to be understood as a meta-temporal dimension where the final liberation from the \"mixed status\" (gu-mëzisn) of the physical world is anticipated. Thereafter, the paper discusses a number of Old and Later Avestan passages concerning a particular aspect of the yasna-. In these passages one finds references to a \"self-consecration\" of the uruuan- (\"[inner]-soul\" or \"breath-soul\"), and of other parts of the human be-ing, like the frauua$i- (\"pre-existing soul\" or simply \"pre-soul\"), the ustana-(\"animation\"), and the ast- (\"bone[s]\"). These Avestan sources are analyzed in the light of the Indian conception of the \"interiorization\" of the sacrifice. In particular, this idea is attested in the Brahmänic literature (and has already been studied by Ch. Malamoud and M. Biardeau). This comparison suggests some common patterns with the Zoroastrian ritual tradition. Through the worship offered to his own \"soul\", the sacrificer is raised up to the divine dimension, where he can meet Ahura Mazdä and the other gods. The comparison sheds new light on the initiatory, exoteric and speculative dimension of the Indo-Iranian ritual. Beate Schmermbeck (Heidelberg) „Oh Herr, erhöre unser Monägät\". Zarathustrische Traditionslinien einer persischen Gebetsgattung zwischen Indien und Iran (\"O Lord, hear our Monägät\". Zarathustrian Traditions of a Persian Genre of Prayer between India and Iran) In contrast to the classical Zarathustrian literature, which has been the subject of academic research for more than two centuries, scholars have ignored Zara-thustrian monägät. These songs of prayers composed either in a rhythmical, rhymed prose or in stanzas, are considered to be the epitome of a confidential nearness to god; they are the faithful's intimate communication with god. Originally deriving from Islamic traditions, these prayers have been reflected in Zarathustrian religious literature ever since the 13th century and have given rise to a variety of monägät of a more or less Zarathustrian character. Until a few decades ago, these mystically inspired prayers were a constituent part of the Zarathustrian religious everyday culture in Iran as well as in India, passed on as a rule by the female members of a family. This essay follows the ways of tradi-tion of the Zarathustrian monägät, presents the contents of the prayers in two examples, and thus illustrates the Zarathustrians' ritual everyday life. (Transi.

Some women were considered to have the same ability. In the eyes of the Pahlavi commentators and theologians, the power of the Yasna ritual came into expres-sion by the fact that it re-enacted the act of creation and foreshadowed that of eschatology, the two being intimately linked together. At the end of time, the Yasna ritual will no longer be necessary, and will be replaced by songs of praise. For the ritual to be effective, it has to be performed in the fire temple, where its place of performance guarantees that it will not go to the demons; when performed in other places, any failing in its performance causes it to go to the demons. The idea of the Yasna as a sacrifice raises the question of the somewhat paradoxical position of the original sacrifice, on the basis of which the Yasna was instituted. The bovine, the animal that undergoes immolation in the primordial sacrifice (and in eschatology) undergoes suffering not because of the sacrifice but because of the interference of the evil powers, and it can thus symbolize the suffering of humanity under the oppression of evil. Prods Oktor Skjœrvo (Cambridge, MA) Smashing Urine: On Yasna 48.10 Yasna 48.10, a passage in the Old Avestan GäOäs, an ancient Iranian text as-cribed to Zarathustra, has frequently been discussed by Western scholars, both philologists and historians of religion. Once the passage was taken as proof that Zarathustra rejected the use of haoma, although haoma played a central and crucial role in the Young Avestan sacrifice, the yasna. However, this is not the opinion of all modern scholars. The passage is grammatically straightforward by Old Avestan standards, but opinions have varied about its interpretation. I suggest that the prima facie meaning of the words points to the well-known Indo-Iranian myth of the dragon-slaying and the release of the fertilizing heav-enly waters upon the earth. In my opinion, the passage contains a disparaging statement about the rival poet-sacrificers' sacrifice of the haoma, which does not have the desired effect of removing the forces of chaos, implying that our poet-sacrificer's sacrifice does have the desired effect. This, in turn, indicates that the haoma sacrifice had the same function in the ritual performed in Old Avestan times as in Young Avestan times. Jan A.M.

These theories are briefly introduced, and it is demonstrated that the different theories focus attention to different features of the same ritual. On the one hand, thus, using different theories when analyzing and describing rituals may lead to a more detailed and more complete description. On the other hand, it is argued that descriptions of a ritual are necessarily influenced by the theory each author has in mind. Therefore, it is necessary for scholars to make themselves aware of the theoretical preconceptions they have in mind. By conscientiously making use of both their own theories and those of others scholars may come to see more aspects of the rituals they study and produce richer descriptions. The pa-per also demonstrates that the Navjote ritual may properly be regarded an ini-tiation ritual, according to the definitions proposed by the authors investigated. Michal Stausberg (Heidelberg) Contextualizing the Contexts. On the Study of Zoroastrian Rituals In this introductory essay, which to a varying degree is based on the single con-tributions to this volume, the editor of this volume discusses a number of con-textual settings for the study of Zoroastrian rituals. To begin with, the author reviews the importance assigned to rituals in the debate on Zarathushtra and the origins of Zoroastrianism. As this debate often argues with explicit and implicit comparisons the author goes on to discuss some methodological and theoretical problems in applying comparative perspectives to the study of the Yasna-ritual. While most of these studies have focused on the Yasna, it is evident that Zoro-astrianism possesses a network of interrelated rites and ceremonies. Most ritu-als are administered by male priests, and the 'ritual system' shows some charac-teristics of professional religion. At the same time, there is a complex interplay between priestly and lay rituals. Moreover, there are instances of gender-specific division of labour. A particular problem is the (lacking?) 'congrega-tional', or 'communal' dimension of the rituals. Starting from antiquity (He-rodotus), Zoroastrian rituals have aroused the curiosity and stimulated the imagination of outsiders. In the modem period, the study of Zoroastrian rituals has increasingly involved the interaction between Zoroastrians and foreign scholars.

While the week as a temporal unit is of no importance within traditional Zoro-astrian ritualistic, currently there are two fire-temples in Bombay that draw comparatively large crowds on specific days of the week. These are the Aslaji Bhikhaji Agiary and the Seth Cowasji Behramji Banaji Atash Behram. Whereas the Aslaji is visited mainly on Fridays and the days linked to Mithra in the Zo-roastrian calendar, at the Banaji a communal ritual event (Humbandagi) takes place at the beginnings of the fourth watch of the day (sunset to midnight) on each Monday. A counting of the number of worshippers attending this event conducted in September 2000 and in February 2002 revealed an average of 459 Parsis attended. The present paper is based on interviews that Mrs Zarin Mar-fatia conducted with worshippers and priests at both places. It discusses the devotees' practices, expectations and experiences with regard to the Aslaji and the Banaji and beyond. Based on oral history and some published documents, the study retraces the historical developments of the phenomena including their ongoing modifications, ramifications, and transformations. Moreover, it ex-plores some hitherto unperceived religious coherences lying behind what is going on from the perspective of the history of religions. Sarah Stewart (London) The Atas nu Gît: A Parsi Lay Ritual The Ätas nu Gît or Song of the Fire is a Gujarati text said to have been com-posed by two brothers in honour of the founding of the second Zoroastrian sa-cred fire Atas Bahräm) in Navsari in 1765; it appeared in publication in Bom-bay in 1879. In this paper, I look at the content of the song and the way in which it works both as an oral text and as a ritual performance. I examine its significance as a lay composition and the purpose it serves for the lay commu-nity - in terms of its religious content, and in providing a narrative account of certain historical events. These events pertain to the Parsi community as a whole and also refer to the local community in Navsari at the time of the com-position of the song. In the latter context, the song works as means by which to re-establish the solidarity of a community divided by internal issues. I also ex-amine the way in which two structures operate within the text. The first of these has been imposed upon the published version by the compiler of that text and gives us an insight into Parsi society in the mid nineteenth century. The second is a thematic structure that expresses certain theological ideas and is reminis-cent of a number of older Zoroastrian religious texts. Finally, I look at the way in which contemporary accounts of lay religious life illuminate references in the song to customs that are not described in detail and, in some cases are no longer observed but remain part of living memory."},{"pageNumber":743,"pageContent":"Werner Sundermann (Berlin) Zarathustra der Priester und Prophet in der Lehre der Manichäer (Zarathustra the Priest and Prophet according to the Maniehaean Teaching) The aim of this paper is to show that although Manichaeism has much in com-mon with the Zoroastrian doctrine as developed by the third century A.D., but nothing with Zoroastrian ritual practice, the Manichaeans did accept the person of Zoroaster in their own interpretation not only as a teacher of truth, a prophet, authorized, inspired and sent by the World of Light, but also as a priest. Zoro-aster is the only forerunner of of Mani's to fulfill his message by the word of gnosis and by ritual acts. In the first part ofthe paper, Zoroaster's role as a teacher of the divine revelation is exemplified by a Sogdian text published by Yoshida in 1979. The particular Maniehaean interpretation of a genuine Zoro-astrian piece of doctrine is underscored. In the second part, texts are presented and discussed which testify to a familiarity of Maniehaean authors with details of the Zoroastrian ritual, namely the famous Parthian \"Zoroaster fragment\" and the Middle Persian fragment ofthe \"Speech of/on Living Self' on Zoroaster. The Maniehaean authors approve of the Zoroastrian sacrifice and purification ceremonies as symbolic acts pointing out the redemption of the Living Soul from the bonds of the demonic matter. Mario Vitalone (Naples) Fires and the Establishment of Ätas Β ahräms in the Zoroastrian Tradition Fire occupies a central place in Zoroastrian devotional life. It is probably only in Sasanian period that the Zoroastrian priests gradually developed the differen-tiation of the temple fires into the three categories, which in the Islamic period were called Ätas Bahräm, Ädarän and Dädgäh. The first reference to the pro-cedures for the establishment of an Ätas Bahräm is found in the Pahlavi Riväyat Accompanying the Dädestän ï Dënïg, compiled in the post-Sasanian period. For the subsequent centuries, we have no other documentary evidence on the subject, until the taking up again of contact between the two Zoroastrian communities of Iran and India. The Persian reväyat of Kämdin Säpur dated 1558 fully incorporates the list of the fourteen fires of the Pahlavi Riväyat, with the addition of two more. As for the Parsi tradition, already prior to the arrival in India they were familiar with a procedure for the formation of sacred fire, even if we have no information about the level of their knowledge. The subse-quent tradition was certainly influenced by the reväyat of Kämdin Sapur and it is substantially on the basis of the methods recorded therein that the majority of the Atas Bahräms now existing in India were founded."},{"pageNumber":744,"pageContent":"Gemot Windfuhr (Ann Arbor) Zoroastrian and Taoist Ritual: Cosmology and Sacred Numerology The author had previously suggested that the Zoroastrian Yasna ritual is inti-mately correlated with the cosmos and calendar, and thus Time, in a nontrivial way. In particular, the instruments on the central ritual table correlate with the 12 months of the Zoroastrians calendar, and with other cosmological and meta-physical patterns in Zoroastrian thought. Such patterns reflect the fact that the Yasna ritual, its liturgical texts joined with the chapters of the Visparad, is prominently enacted during the seasonal festivals. So far, these patterns ap-peared to be unique to Zoroastrianism. This article suggests that the Taoist rit-ual is closer to the Yasna than any ritual in other traditions, and explores strik-ing similarities between the two. Even though both are the product of two inde-pendent ancient traditions, they both enjoyed strong royal support for extended periods at one time or another, and reflect a worldview and approach to ritual that appears to originate in Late Hellenism. The similarities include the ar-rangement of the ritual area as three mutually embedded worlds; the arrange-ment in form of a calendar; the arrangement of the eight priests/eight trigrams; positional shifts in forms of a magic square and other numerological patterns, and numerous others. Moreover, in both, the ritual arrangements, acts, and moves, are seen not as entities as such, but as nodes in a world matrix of pro-gressive and regressive cycles. A significant contribution to this investigation is the dialectic analysis of the ritual in terms of the sequence of acts, rather than of the liturgical texts, in the Yasna ritual."},{"pageNumber":746,"pageContent":"LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS Plates James W.
