It was here that Nick met many of the ex-Whare R.g adepti that both helped me in the Golden Dawn techniques. For many people the.A.O. Order and its teachings under Mathers was a mystery. The assumption was that Mathers continued a pure strain of the Golden Dawn unsoiled by the Stella Matutina, its Golden Dawn rival, and which took the bulk of the Golden Dawn membership with it after the break in 19oo. The contrast between what the Golden Dawn originally taught and .Alpha et Omega, via the rituals, has never seen the light of day until Nick decided to write this book. What Nick has uncovered about the .A.O. rituals will be a disappointment fo r Golden Dawn fa ns, as the later papers and ritual changes by Mathers appeared to be going backwards, rather than fo rwards. Nick lays all this out plainly fo r the readers with .A.O. ritual examples to contrast with the original Golden Dawn rituals. This has been an area that has cried out fo r more research and Nick has provided an excellent opportunity fo r us to gaze through the window of the later operations of the .Alpha et Omega. This book is something that should be on the shelf of all Golden Dawn students. In many respects it compliments my GOLDEN D.Alf'N R.fT'V.ALS.AND COMMENT.AR.fESbook which can be studied alongside this work to show how the different directions the Golden Dawn streams have developed."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"PI<§FACE The Golden Dawn Tradition is experiencing a period of rapid growth and development. For over xoo years the rituals of the l?.!!,.ricrucia11 Order of .Alpha et Omega (R.O.A.O.) have been locked away in private collections and unavailable fo r many occultists to study and compare. The publication of these rituals are particularly interesting as they demonstrate the direction Mathers moved after he was expelled from the original Order of the Golden Daw11. As Nick Farrell clearly demonstrates in this book, Mathers moved to a Masonic style of operation in marked contrast to the Stella Matutina which developed in a Magical direction. As the news of the imminent publication of these Rituals broke, accusations of oath breaking were levelled by some that believed themselves to be the exclusive owner of this intellectual property and claimed to be the historical R.O.A.O. Personally I believe that the rituals of a living Order have no place in print but clearly the R.O.A.O. has ceased to exist fo r many years and any organization or persons using such rituals have no more right to them than anyone else. Just because someone happens to be privy to a particular collection, or have fo und them in a library, does not provide them with any sort of exclusivity. And the publication of these rituals, at this time, ensures that all students of the Golden Dawn Tradition have the opportunity to study and compare them to other versions of Golden Dawn rituals. Initiates ofPaul Foster Case's Bui'lder.r of the .Adytum will find these rituals of particular interest as the B.O.T.A. Chapter rituals are based on the First Order Rituals of the R.O.A.O. almost \"word fo r word\" though Paul introduced a variety of elements to isolate the egregore ofB.O.T.A. from anyone using the R.O.A.O. rituals. Initiates of Working Chapters of B.O.T.A. will be surprised to find that many of the innovations fo und in the rituals of"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MATHER§� LAST SECR§T Working Chapters were not those of Paul Case. The Antiphony, alterations in the specific wording of Officers' speeches, etc. are almost entirely the work of Mathers. Paul introduced a number of Esoteric Masonic constructs into the Neophyte ritual, re­translated the Zelator Prayer of the Elements, changed Officer sceptres, the color of First Order robes, colored many of the First Order Diagrams, and subsituted Elemental Tablets derived from Crowley's 777 in the Grade rituals. Probably the most significant changes involved the modification of the Neophyte and Theoricus rituals to bring them more in line with his extensive research into the Cube of Space (graphical depiction of the spacial directions given in the Sepher Tetrjrah). But the remainder of the B.O.T.A. Chapter ritual is almost entirely the work ofMathers. It appears that the Builder! of the Adytum and its various offshoots are the last living Lineage of the R.O.A.O. in operation today. Nick Farrell has made every effort to keep the rituals and diagrams true to the original Nisi material even when the discrepancies were likely incorrect. This is valuable fo r those who want to examine the material as close to the original manuscripts as possible.

Order\", I looked at the history of the Order in terms of the wider Golden Dawn history. The book, titled }(J'ng over the Water, asked the question \"Who was the genius behind the Golden Dawn?\" There I proved that it was neither of its fo unders Westcott or Mathers, but rather the tradition itself. This book looks at the magical approach of the early .A. 0. using ritual material from the Berridge Temple in London. I will attempt to make a comparison between this and the Stella Matutina tradition, which most people are familiar with, at least in a bastardised fo rm, through the works of Israel Regardie. There have been no other attempts to publish .A.O. material in any co-ordinated manner. When K.irzg over the W'ater was announced a group whose leader claimed \"direct descent\" from the original.A.O. said they owned the rights to the.A.O. material in the book and it should be considered secret. Setting aside the questionable validity of such a claim, or that secrecy applies to documents which can be fo und in public libraries, this group was using later .A.O. rituals from the 192os, so the much earlier Berridge Temple material which was being published in K.lng over the Water would not harm them. Later this group made a public announcement that it had extensively re­written the rituals with the help of the Order's Secret Chief and even the 192os versions were not being used any more. ' R!Jsicrucian Order ofA!pha et Omega was rarely referred to by its full name. The .Alpha et Omega part of the name was always abbriviated to A.O. and was named letter by letter in English. Throughout this book we have referred to the order as A.O. and have left the full name Alpha et Omega for when it is specifically mentioned in full in the rituals."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16 MATHER.§, LAST SECR,?T The purpose of this book is two-fold. Firstly, it enables people who are interested in the Golden Dawn tradition and rituals to study them and their flow into different traditions. It is possible that the seed that was planted within the original Golden Dawn may have flowed in different directions in its successors. This is important fo r those who are building new Golden Dawn groups that will carry the tradition into the 21St century. But it also takes material out of the hands of those who sit like kings upon piles of photocopies dishing them out in return fo r favours, grades or still more papers. This gives a false power to those who should not have it. For example, one person spent years collecting documents. If you approached him he would say he could not give them to you because that would break an oath. Of course he could never have made any oath to a Golden Dawn or .A. O. Temple. However, he used the photocopies to get recognition from other orders about how advanced he was. In a debate on something important, he could trump it because he had a document that covered the subject. It was not knowledge or experience, just a good filing system. He suckered one group into making him a chief without having to do a stroke of meditation. Last I heard, he had died without ever turning up to one of the group's meetings. In the Golden Dawn there are two types ofknowledge. The first is the written knowledge which appears in papers, most of which have been published. If you were to take the published material and attempt to use it to become a magician you would fail. In fact I doubt there is a single magical order anywhere that can rely on the written material to produce adepts. Secondly there was oral instruction. This explains the teaching and places it in context. If you were to record this teaching it would fill many tapes and pages and pages of transcripts. Even then you would miss important points. I learnt magic sitting and listening to my teacher. I read his writings, but I learnt a lot more from listening. It was from these talks I got the Golden Thread which connected me to teachings and understand what they tried to do. This is magic. If you wrote notes about the same thing it would be knowledge or experience. The Golden Dawn did things differently. Knowledge was kept secret to such an extreme that the tradition suffered. In 1992 I"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"NICI(F.AR,l\\E,LL went to New Zealand ran a workshop in Hawkes Bay and several of the old group of Whare Rg • members attended. At that point I was not a member of the Golden Dawn and just talked about the Bri'tuh Western Mystery tradition. I was told later they had not heard that sort of material spoken since Whare Rg closed and realised how much they had missed being taught. But the secrecy worked against the flow of information and, although they were all high level Whare Rg people, they had to find their own source of teaching. Eventually Golden Dawn material fo und its way into the public which was presented in a fo rmat which could be superficially used. The first volume of a four volume set was issued in 1937 with the publication of THE GOLDEN D.ATVNby Israel Regardie. This information is now so completely 'outed' that it can no longer be considered secret. Everyone can buy the book and read it. Theoretically it would give you the same information as someone who was a G)=[§] in the Stella Matuti'na. Material which is sitting in a library or collection can also be considered public. Anyone visiting Dublin can sit down and read all of Yeats' Golden Dawn material, effectively having access to the same material as a G)=@] in the Stella Matuti'na. Equally the Slater collection gives someone the same information at hand as a G)=@] in the later .Alpha et Omega. But it is rubbish to think that having the information is equal to Magical ability. The Golden Dawn is a spiritual and magical system and NOT an intellectual exercise. Just because you are given a small amount of intellectual information it is not enough to actually VSE it practically. Each part of the Golden Dawn teaching requires deep thought and reflection to unlock its mysteries. The documents are therefore the tip of the Golden Dawn iceberg. None of the original Golden Dawn, .Alpha et Omega, Whare Rg, or Stella Matuti'na documents can be considered part of the oath of secrecy. They are owned by the tradition and represent the bare minimum • Whare Ra, which was initially part of Felkin's Stella Matutina Order, was the New Zealand branch of the Order, based in Havelock North, in the North Island. Later it became the Smaragdum Thalas.res Order. It survived the death of Dr. and Mrs. Felkin and was ably run by their daughter. It only closed its doors in 1978. It is referred to in this book as Whare Ra rather than Smaragdum Thalasses."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18 MATHER§, LAST SEC\"R,FT that all Orders, which choose to fo llow that tradition, need. I prefer that .ALL this traditional material would be published on a single website and groups could use the material in their own way. Armed with this information every group could grow and adapt. I say this from experience. I was trained in two .A.O. offshoots -Builders of the .Adytum and the Servants of the Light. I also received a lot of teaching directly and indirectly from the old adepts of Whare Re and was involved with Chic and Tabatha Cicero's Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn fo r nearly 12 years. Yet, when I came to look at the S.AME MATERJ.AL fo r my own group, The Magical Order Of The .Aurora .Aurea, it became something unique. While no-one could find anything unorthodox in the Golden Dawn fo rmula we use, the mechanics of magic born from our interpretation of the Golden Dawn system created a unique flavour without changing a wo rd in the established text. Pat Zalewski has fo und something similar in his presentation of the Golden Dawn material in his book Golden Dawn Rituals and Commentaries, as did Chic and Tabatha Cicero when they created their Hermetic Order OfThe Golden Dawn. It would be impossible to do this without absorbing the magic symbolism of the Golden Dawn. This is the essence of lineage. You do not have lineage because someone laid hands on you, or signed a certificate declaring that you have the right to initiate. The Golden Dawn itself may have been created without that particular lineage. Spiritual lineage comes fr om working within the tradition over a number of years and making contact with the energies behind it. These contacts define the tradition and those working within it. These are not Secret Chiefs sitting on the astral plane waiting fo r another group of luckless people to be their \"students.\" Nor are they guardians of an immutable fu ndamental TR.._ VTH which some students seem to crave. These are LIVING spiritual principles that work fo r the transmutation of creation and are given masks by the psychic perceptions of those who are lucky enough to observe them. Their work within the Golden Dawn tradition has been to transform it in every generation to make it more relevant. Oddly, there has been little on the surface that has changed with the Golden Dawn since it was fo unded over 122 years ago. However, under the bonnet, things are completely different."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"NICJ(FAR..., R,§LL 19 It is this transformation which can be seen within the A.O. in the different teachings and rituals of the Berridge Temple and that of the later Alpha et Omega. The difference can be seen by the magical instructions that are given in each paper. Some of it was overseen by Samuel Mathers himself as his Order slid into a more magical new generation. In J(,ing over the Water I made some statements about Mathers and Westcott which some found alarming. The first was that neither of them were initiates of the Golden Dawn. True, they initiated people into it and even wrote the rituals, but the truth was that neither of them went through the system they had created. There are two recorded instances of them carrying out a Golden Dawn ritual on themselves. The first is when Mathers was bound to the Crou of Suffering to take the oath on behalf of the Second Order. The experience fr ight ened him so much that he ordered \\Vestcott to take on the duty, permanently. After doing it once, \\Vestcott swore he would not do it either and delegated it to another adept. If you want to be considered an Initiate of a system, it would seem obvious that you have to be Initiated into that system. Mathers and Westcott were more than happy to keep their \"honorary\" CV=@J grades without experiencing the rites. The result was that under their direct rule the Order was not MAGICAL. It was only later when students had been through the entire Order system and meditated on its symbols that the magical current started to influence the Golden Dawn and awaken it. The initiates included A.E. Waite, the Felkins and Dr. Brodie-Innes. This makes Mina Mathers a Golden Dawn initiate, but not her husband. This is something that even Dion Fortune, who did not get on with Mina, had to recognise. It was the Initiates who made their own contacts who took the Order along with them. Pat Zalewski's Golden Dawn R.,ltualJ and Commentariu shows the latest development ofFelkin's system. This book aims to discuss the magic that was behind the A. O. rituals. In many cases it was inferior to Felkin's own efforts, but one can argue that it was the AO current that created the Brituh Magical Tra dition, through the likes of Dion Fortune and Wicca. The second point I made in I<:ing over the Water was that the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 MATHER§� LAST SECR,fiT Golden Dawn revolt did not include Wynn Westcott. He joined Berridge's London Temple and appears to have taken up the role of Cancellarius. His name appears on the ritual documents connected with Berridge's Temple fo r the rest of his time in London. He never resigned, at least during the reign of Mathers. While the so-called rebels may have wanted Westcott fo r his knowledge, it would imply that whatever forces were behind their version of the Order did not have a place fo r him. Westcott's support lends credence to those who felt the authority of the Golden Dawn, such as it was, passed onto the.A.O. rather than the Stella Matutina. However, as we will see later, this was more of a handicap than an assistance. In this book, I have attempted to provide commentary and a ABASICGU!DE torhe TRADTTION few explanatory articles about the rituals and knowledge lectures. Lately there have been several Golden Dawn books which have been just cut and paste versions of documents without any attempts to place them into context. This is a cop out. If you are going to stick your head up and publish documents you should at least have a stab at explaining what they mean. Otherwise you �������������� are just trying to make a name fo r yourself without adding anything fo r the reader. Looking at these rituals, I am interested in the M.AG/Cbehind the ideas. I am less interested in the history as opposed to looking at the evolution of magical techniques and differences between this material and the Stella Matutina. The reference material I am using is from the Berridge Temple which was the earliest.A.O. temple set up outside Paris. This ritual material was given a cursory examination in 1\\lng over the Water."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"N!Cl(FAJ(R.f:LL 21 The material was kept by a member ofBerridge's Temple until his death in the I9)0S. His name was Henry D. Kelf, a pharmaceutical chemist dispenser, who lived in Camberwell, London. His magical motto was 'Nisi Dominus Frustra'·. The pile of documents was given to Gerald Gardner who used it as the magical basis fo r his Witchcraft re-enactment. Various historians, quoting the Sword of Wisdom by Ithell Colquhoun, believe that there were three A. O. temples one after the other in London. The first was set up by Berridge, the second by Maiya Tranchell-Hayes and the third by Mina Mathers, after her husband's death. This appears to be based on a mis-reading of Dion Fortune, who said that her London temple, which had been under the control of the Scottish branch of the A. O. under Brodie-Innes, became part ofMina's. Brodie-Innes was the Chief Adept of the entire Order, at least on paper. Mina had come over from Paris and ruled his London temple. There is no evidence that Berridge's Temple ever closed and it would seem that Mina's Temple, was the same group. Colquhoun is not the most reliable of sources, but her belief that there were three London AO temples is a supposition that has been absorbed into the Golden Dawn myth. While the Berridge rituals are complete, the teaching material is not. I have included some of the teaching material so that people studying the Golden Dawn can use it. The material included Berridge's own messy diagrams, some of which we re-drew. We have left some diagrams in their original state. I have fo llowed the layout and spelling of the original documents where possible and resisted the temptation to correct the Hebrew. I suspect that ifV.H. Fr. N.D.F. knew that he was destined to be providing the only copy of the early A. 0. material to the world he would have been a bit more careful! The purpose of this book is not to bury the Alpha et Omega, but rather to encourage its development. There is material here which needs to evolve. By looking at it, meditating on it, and TR:riNG IT OVT the right people can make their own contacts and bring the Order to life in a meaningful way.

Equally, it could be the inspiration for other groups to start using Mathers' Last Secrets. Rather than using the system used in the Bristol Temple of the Stella Matutina, as set out in Regardie's Golden Dawn, the.A.O. gives new groups a \"new\" flavour and approach.

They forget to visualise the God -forms and the Inner Temple and then the whole thing degenerates into a badly scripted costume drama with only psychological value to the candidate,, - Pa ola Piacentini B EFOR.§ LOO.l(JNG at the ritual material it is important to understand some basics of ritual magic. Although humanity has grown up with the idea that magicians get what they want by pointing a wand and shouting a magical word, the reality is more complex. Ritual magic was developed in the ancient temples where the dramas of the Gods were acted out. Humans would take on the role of Gods in the various myths. These were not amateur dramatics but an expression of worship. In some rites, such as the worship of Mardok in Babylonia, the ruler of the country was given the starring role. \\Vhen we look at most of the serious fo rms of magic we see this reflected. The magician uses \"God-forms\" to help them see themselves having the same powers. The best magicians are those who can get into their part so deeply that fo r the duration of the ritual they really believe that they are God, but at the same time snap out ofit afterwards. Fused with this idea was a concept borrowed from the Memory"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"MATHER§, LAST SECR,fiT systems of Ancient Times. The Ancient Greek and Romans believed it was possible to remember anything which was visualised in an imaginary realm. When you realise how important memory was to the Platonic philosophers, you can see how the idea of locus, or place, entered into magic. The idea of an intense magical ritual is that the magician adopts an appropriate God-form, while at the same time imagining the magic taking place at an ideal sy mbolic location. Cabbalistically this use ofYetziratic fo rmula bridged the world of Spirit and the world of matter and allowed energy to cross between them. Today we call this creative visualisation in which you imagine something so intensely as taking place in your current environment that it becomes real. This is not daydreaming. The better you get at it, the more the imagined world takes on a life of its own. The imagined world becomes less \"created\" and more \"seen\". In the much later Dion Fortune Tradition each ritual would start with a path working, or inner journey, to a temple. In Dion Fortune's Society of Inner Light it involved a trip by camel across the desert to a temple where the ritual was to be conducted. Once the details of this inner location, complete with the appropriate God­fo rms, were fixed in the mind's eye the Officers and members would open their eyes and project what they had seen onto the physical environment. This is a magical approach that can be contrasted to the Masonic method, which is working a ritual very well and allowing the physical temple, symbols and psychological impact of the ritual to affect the candidate. When the Golden Dawn started it only used the Masonic method. The ritua l reads like it came from a Masonic Side­Order and many of its \"traditions\" come from what is called \"Fringe Masonry.\" However the Golden Dawn soon changed when Mathers wrote the Second Order ritual and three documents called Z.1, Z.2, and Z.3, in 1892. These provided an inner key to magical operations and initiations conducted in the Outer Order. What he did was base the @=@ ritual on a mock Egyptian poem which was called the Fo rmula of the Enterer. It is not clear where Mathers' got this idea from as it had not really been recorded as being part of any tradition. The poem can be broken down so that it can be used in any ritual. It was applied"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"NJCJ(F.Al(l(ELL 2) to the@=@ ritual, but it can be fitted into the other rites as well. The poem runs: The General Exordium The Speech in the Silence: The Wordr against the Son of Night: The Voice ofThoth before the Vniverse in the preserzce of the eternal Godr: The Formulas of JV.zowledge: The Wisdom of Breath: The Rgdix of Vibration,· The Shaking of the Invisible: The R.£lling Asunder of the Darkneu: The Becoming Visible of Matter: The Piercing of the Coils of the Stooping Dragon: The Breakingforth of the Light: All these are in the JV.zowledge ofTho-oth. The Particular Exordium At the Ending of the Night: At the Limits of the Light: Tho-oth stood before the Vnbom Ones of Time! Then was formulated the Vniverse: Then came forth the Godr thereof The Aeons of the Bomleu Beyond: Then was the Voice vibrated: Then was the Name declared. At the Threshold of the Entrance, Between the Vniverse and the Infinite, In the Sign of the Enterer, stood Tho-oth, As before him were the Aeons proclaimed. In Breath did he vibrate them: In Symbols did he record them: For betwixt the Light and the Dar kneu did he stand."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"MATHER§� LAST SECR§T If a practical magician were to build a ritual using this fo rmula he would take it line by line and include something that reflected both the poem and his intention. The Z documents give another dimension to the rituals. When a Temple was opened, the Hierophant, backed by the visualization and magical skills of any Second Order members who were present would visualise Egyptian gods around the Temple. These God­fo rms were made fr om astral material and were \"lifeless\" until they were empowered during the rite. Sometimes these God­fo rms overshadowed some Officers, other times they remained still, but their fu nction was to reflect different aspects of the divine light into the ritual. These God-forms could be felt by those psychically sensitive and would act as tools to bring about changes in the candidate. The Temple would be raised to a locus, which was the Temple of Maat or the Hall of Judgement from the Ancient E!J'pti'an Book of the Dead. The officers were instructed what God-forms to use and what symbols they were supposed to imagine. You would think that the working of a ritual in this way would have been fascinating fo r the early Golden Dawn members, but there is some evidence that not everyone liked the magical approach to ritual. Indeed, after Mathers was removed from the Golden Dawn, one of the Adepts involved in the coup said it meant that they could finally abandon the Z documents. There was a successful move within the Order to abandon magic. The Adeptus Minor grade was just going to be a traditional Masonic meeting where a paper was presented and people talked about doing things. Later under A.E. Waite this fr ag ment added a few more ceremonies before evolving into something more Masonic. It was the lack of this magical approach that led Felkin to start his Stella Matuti'na. This \"masonic approach\" within the Golden Dawn can be summed up as: initiations without magical techniques, an obsession with a perceived tradition, emphasis on g rades, a need fo r titles, being the head of a Temple made up oflarge numbers rather than good quality magicians and progression based on time served rather than magical ability. This war between Masonic and Magical sides within the Golden"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"NJCJ(FAJ(.R,§LL Dawn continues today. Usually the masonic people are more expert at discrete knifing and power-plays while the Magical types are usually too obsessed with the work to notice until it is too late.

The Pl(?PAI{#TION Let me first premise that the H[ood-win]k placed over your eyes at your preparation represented the Darkness of Ignorance, while the r[ope] round your w[aist] showed those earthly inclinations which ever attempt to drag down and fe tter the Soul. • The movement of the Kerux guiding the candidate to the various points of the temple as they are explained is a nice touch. It has not been documented in the early Golden Dawn or its off-shoots but it explains part of the ritual where the Kerux suddenly gets up and wanders anti-clockwise to pick up the candidate to take him to experience the chemical change. The riddle was that he was standing by the Candidate all along, if Mathers' system is followed.

Like Dr. Frankenstein, Mathers fo und that his monster was more powerful and complex than he could have imagined and he no longer understood it. This ritual from the Berridge Temple shows what the Golden Dawn were doing at the time of the revolt and Mathers' own ideas about how the ritual should go. Dated 19o1 they were written soon after the revolt. It would be tempting to think that these would be the rituals that Mathers had wanted to have, but fo r a variety of reasons had been stopped by the Golden Dawn system. But this is unlikely. In the old Golden Dawn he could have introduced changes without any problem, had he been so minded. Wynn Westcott did not block Mathers' potential changes, nor would he have had any problems with the differences between these and the old Golden Dawn rite. Westcott was a Mathers loyalist, at least in this respect. He never joined the rebels and after the coup, he swiftly al igned himself with the A. O. and held a senior post in Berridge's temple. If there had been anything radically wrong with Mathers' changes, Westcott would have left. Mathers would have seen the need fo r some changes to the tradition. Magically, it makes sense not to have exactly the same rite as those with whom you are in direct conflict. The maxim that which i.J built by thought and symbol can be destroyed by thought and symbol was known to Mathers. He was paranoid enough to assume that the rebels were attacking him, so making changes to the rite was a way of preventing it being used as an attack vector. It would appear that in writing the new rituals, Mathers chose to ignore certain aspects of the Cipher manuscripts and added some padding. But some of the changes performed here knock the entire structure of the tradition out of whack. Many of the worst of these changes were made with the goal of speeding up the @=@ ritual or to maximise the numbers of people who could be initiated at once. Mathers' guidelines enable more than a third of the ritual to be removed. To Mathers, this must have meant that those things were not as important as the parts that remained. However, if all Mathers' short cuts were taken we would be left mostly with just the oath as the ritual's major magical moment. This meant that everything Mathers wrote in his Z documents about the"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"MATHER§, UST SECR.?T transformation of the candidate and the effects of the ritual on the candidate's sphere of sensation was meaningless. Mathers believed that a large number of people could be initiated at once by the simple expedient of roping them together. Magically this is impossible, but in Masonic rituals it is done all the time at the expense of the candidates. Once initiated it seems that people would be rapidly progressed through the grades. The seating plan also supports this. Thus we see that more <!l=riDs and @=(l]s have seats, while there are few @=@s and CD=OQis. In orders where progress through the Outer Order is slower there are usually a large number of@=@s and <D=[@s who stay at that grade because of the workload required. If candidates are pushed through, and the magical effects of the ritual are ignored, then it is possible to get more into the higher grades. Mathers describes his new Order as being \"that Jection of the MyJteri'eJ of E!Jp t which it called the R.fJJt'crucian Order of the A.· .. 0 .· .. , He could be claiming that the Rosicrucian Order was part of the Mysteries of Egypt which was a popular theory at the time. But it is also possible to speculate that he was giving the order a connection with his own Isis rite, which was doing quite well and making him money in Paris. This would draw his .A.O. under the umbrella of something called the Mysteries of Egypt, perhaps acting as a Hermetic magical order. This is speculation, but with the changes he made it appears that he was hoping to turn his Isis ritual into a recruiting ground fo r the .A.O. and draw in large numbers of people. The Isis workings were never attempted in London, so the theory is weak. They fell out of fashion in Paris quickly too, but the fr amework fo r Mathers' idea could be here. The purification and consecration of the temple is described in two different ways, neither of which was used by modern Golden Dawn temples or Whare J?.e. The first had the Dadouchos and the Stolistes standing together and standing in the quarter and sprinkling water or cense at the same time before moving onto the next quarter. The other had them both doing the same thing facing the altar. This is shown in what is called A and B. The ritual includes words to be used fo r doing it the old Golden Dawn way with the Stolistes going first and then the Dadouchos. It looks like Mathers felt that the old way took far too long and was looking fo r a short cut. It was never fo rmalised. Magically purifying and"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"NJCI(FAJ(R.fiLL 71 censing the altar is not the same thing as doing the entire temple and with both the Dadouchos and Stolistes doing it at the same time the process would look silly. In modern Golden Dawn groups, and the Stella Matutina, the Dadouchos draws a fire triangle while the Stolistes a water triangle. Both also draw a cross. The idea is that they are sealing the temple with a Banner of the East. One draws the active side of the banner, while the other draws the passive. It does not appear that this teaching was a fe ature of either the AO or the early Golden Dawn. If the two officers were standing side by side they could not be drawing a completed banner. These notes prove that neither draws a cross before or afterwards. In the section 'Order and Procedure in the temple', the overwhelming masonic influence is clear. It follows classical meeting procedure with the minutes of the last meeting being read and approved followed by resolutions. Mter a fo rmal public meeting there was something that craft masonry dubs \"risings\". The Worshipful Master says \"Brethren, I rise fo r the (first, second, or third) time to enquire if any Brother has aught to propose fo r the good of Freemasonry in general or this the (full name and number of the lodge) in particular.\" All questions and statements are put to the Worshipful Master. These are fo r visitors to stand up and give fo rmal greetings fr om their Lodge. Typically this takes some time and has no basis in magic at all. It is like being stuck in a council meeting where most of the members just want to stand up and say \"hi!.\" Then we come to the omissions that we described earlier and we will highlight the impact of what they mean magically. cropening (stations of officers) and (circumambulation) may be passed over:�� This means that while the God-forms are placed over the officers by the Hierophant, they are not linked to the officers' sphere of sensation. Normally this section of the opening allows the Hierophant to fu se the God-form to the officer holding the role. While this is not critical, you would need to be a good Hierophant to carry on the rest of the ritual. It hints that God-forms were not being used or, if they were, they were not being used effectively."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"72 MATHER.§, LAST SECR.gT The lack of a circumambulation here is nuts. It means that light is not being drawn into the Temple and the Hall is not being elevated. A truly wonderful Hierophant would have to extend his own Sphere of Sensation to the fo ur points and do the circumambulation on his own body while drawing in light from the East. This is not easy and you would need proper instructions to do it. The lack of a circumambulation needs to be emphasised. In the Z.r document the writer devoted several pages to its importance. For example: c1s finned in the North, beginning from the Station of the Stolistes, the symbol of the Waters of Creation attracting the divine Sp irit and therefore alluding to the creation of the world by the spirit and the Waters, The Mysti'c Rtverse Circumambulation forms its procession from the South, from the Station of the Dadouchos, as symbolic of the Ending and Judgement of the World by Fire. But also the My stic Circumambulation commences by the Paths of Shin and Rtsh, as though bring into action the Solar Fire, while the reverse Circumambulation commences by the Paths of �h and Ttaddi as though bringing the Watery Rtflux into action ... The mystic circumambulation is called STMBOLJC OF THE RJSE OF THE LIGHT. .. the object is to attract and make a connection between the Divine Light .Above and the Temple., To the writer of the Z documents, if the circumambulations are not done, then the Temple is NOT connected to the Divine Light. Magically, if the temple is not connected to the Divine Light there is no ritual. It is a Masonic style drama. Yet it is this pivotal point of the opening that Mathers believes can be dropped fo r the sake of convenience. To even suggest it, it implies that the ritual's magical intent has been removed and replaced with a masonic approach of only doing the ritual on the earth plane. If you are conducting a ritual without the magical elements of the Z documents you are not doing Golden Dawn magic and the speed at which Mathers was prepared to ignore the Z documents should be a cause fo r alarm"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"NICI(F.Al(l{?LL 73 fo r those who claim that Mathers was the genius of the Golden Dawn. Those who defend him might suggest that these shortcuts were more likely to have just been in Berridge's London te mple.

So soon after the revolt of the Isis temple, he would not want to repeat his mistake of losing control again.

At worst, the candidate would suffer from confusion between Light and Darkness. ccFurther, if actually necessary the temple may be declared open or closed by sceptre. In other words the Hierophant holding the wand by the grip and holding it aloft saying: By the power vested in me by this sceptre I declare this temple Open (or Closed) in the .......... . grade of ......... ..... , Mathers says that this should not be done too often \"especially in the other grades of the first order\". The technique appears to have always been in the Golden Dawn and was used in the Stella Matutina too. It is really an emergency situation where someone drops down dead, or a fire breaks out. However the statement that it should not be \"done too often\" implies that it was an over used short-cut. c:Also the mystical repast is a symbol of harmony within the Order.,, In other words if you drop this fr om the ritual everyone will end up at each other's throats. I tend to agree with this. When it comes time fo r the candidate to be brought into the temple it is clear that the ritual allows fo r more than one. In fact if there were too many then the Hegemon was given assistants to cope with the workload. While this was done in masonry, magically it is about as acceptable as a heart surgeon conducting two or three operations at the same time. There can only be one reason fo r \"roping together\" candidates and that is to get the maximum number through the system in the shortest possible time. The Order cannot possibly be interested and fo cused on an individual, but is instead treating its lower order members like cattle. Magically, the ritual is designed fo r one individual. The"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"NJCI(F.Al(l(ELL 75 elements on the altar represent his or her body. If you rope up several people together then the elements have to represent all of them. If the Hegemon is guiding a candidate around the temple, then they can only take one by the hand. This means that the others are variously removed from that guiding principle. Symbolically they will be dependant on leaders. Magically, there are moments in the outer order grade rituals where it is theoretically possible to rope together people. When the candidates enter into the grade and are explained the mysteries of that grade, it could be \"safe\" to bring them all in at once. As the diagrams have become more ritually significant to my initiation methods, and the magical work on the candidate's sphere of sensation more intense, I have stopped the practice. It is better to do one candidate well, rather than lots of riff-raffbadly. What is shown by Mathers tends to happen in an Order that is obsessed with the status that results fr om having large numbers of people. If you are concentrating on the work and the processes required by the Order, large numbers of people are a hindrance. If a leader is lacking in se lf-confidence they feel secure if they have a large number of people looking up to them. It does not matter if candidates are so badly adjusted by the rite that they end up in the hospital, or don't know which way up a pentagram is done; if they see you as a leader of a big group, you can at least fe el good about yoursel£ The Oath is a departure from the original Golden Dawn oath and in parts it is more reasonable and in others reflects Mathers' own hurt about the revolt against him. Firstly there is the requirement that the ritual is being carried out by an \"authorised representative of a (the) Very Honoured Chief (Chiefs) of thi.I Temple\". It is not clear how many people in the .A. O. were ever initiated by someone who was not an authorised representative but it seems to have been considered a potential problem. From a modern Golden Dawn perspective, this means that those who claim \"lineage\" from the .A. O. would have to be able to show that their line of initiatory descent was authorised by the Chiefs of a working.A.O. temple. A paper lineage, even by a chief, or someone holding a (]):@] issued after a temple closed would not only be invalid, it would be in breach of the Oath. Besides the usual request to keep the name, members and"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"MATHER§, LAST SECR§T proceedings of the order secret you are given a huge get out clause. \"Vnleu permitted to reveal them,,. This meant that the Chiefs of the Temple, and Mathers himself, could carry out actions that broke their oath of secrecy because they could give themselves permission. Mathers could give a list of names and addresses of anyone who is a member of the Order to the local paper if they wished, but a lesser being could not. The great unwashed would have to request permission from Mathers before they could reveal information. This makes the reason fo r secrecy more ambiguous. Either the information is so toxic to ordinary people or the order or there is no real reason fo r the secrecy in the first place. The idea of secrecy in magical orders comes from the medieval craft guilds. If a Master had a radical technique fo r doing something he would lose his income if he shared it. He would swear his apprentice to secrecy so that the technique fo r making money was not lost and they would keep it secret too. This ended up in the Alchemical tradition, which was essentially a craft guild, and Freemasonry. Mathers has added that a person will not originate or encourage cJtrife, schzlm, mtlchief making or opposition to the head of the Order,. Mathers does not say the head of the Temple, which means that while he was protected by oath, Berridge was on his own. Berridge would be hoping that the promise to \"maintain fraternal harmony and concord,, would cover him. However the fact that Mathers fe lt the need fo r special protection by the oath, meant he felt that clause was not enough. The next part of the oath was a straight insult of those who had not followed Mathers into the new Order. He warns that anyone who breaks their oath is ccexpelled from this Order, as perju rer and a liar, not worthy of moral worth, and unfit fo r the society of all upright and true persons,. Given that Mathers' best fr iend in London at the time was Edmund Berridge and his second best chum was Aleister Crowley, both of whom had an abusive relationship with the truth, one has to wonder ifhis insult was worthy. There is the usual threat that the breaker of their oath ccmight even fa ll paralyted or slain without visible weapon,, to which Mathers added ccas if smitten by the lightning of heaven,. None of the rebels suffered from being struck by lightning either divine or literal."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"NICI(F.Al(.l{?LL 77 It seems Mathers fe lt in the position of wielding electrical power when required (which is always handy if the fu ses blow). The passing of the gates has one of those strange things that is optional. After the candidate has been barred and has survived the challenge from the officer, the hoodwink is supposed to be raised fo r a second so he or she can see. This means that challenges often provide circumstances to see divinity or to learn. For some reason, Mathers thought this important point \"optional\". Now it is tricky to engineer during the ritual, particularly if you are carrying scripts, but not that difficult. It is hard to see why Mathers did not think it important. The reception to the light has been shortened and lost a lot of dramatic effect. In the Golden Dawn, Stella Matutina, and Whare R.g all three chief officers have something to say before the hoodwink is removed. Here, only the Hierophant gives a much briefer sentence. In our view this is one of the more dramatic parts of the rite and Mathers has made a pig's ear of it. The instructions say that the three officers are around the altar at the time of this which makes it impossible fo r the triangle of wands to be above the candidate's head unless they stand back. Instead of performing the K!Jabs om Pax invocation over the candidate, Mathers uses his The Manifestation of the Name .A. O fo rmula before hand. In the Golden Dawn and other off­shoots this is the point when the White Triangle of the Order is burned in the candidate's Sphere of Sensation. But the White Triangle actually means the Supernal light and its connection to the Order is secondary. What is important is the Khabs om Pax fo rmula that connects the candidate to the light. But that the Manifestation of the .A. O. fo rmula is NOT the same thing, as you can see in the beginning of the ritual it is fo cused on representing the Order. The name .Alpha et Omega is seen as the Rising Light or the Golden Dawn, or the Order, whereas the K!Jabs om Pa x fo rmula is connected to the divine extended light i.e., \"may the light be extended in abundance upon you\". True, the Order is a vehicle fo r the light, but it is NOT the Light itself. Mathers seems to believe that the light of the ORJ)E� or the rising light, should be placed, in priority, before the Light in Extension. In Christian terms it is like putting the Church and its Pope before Christ.

This ritual is a backwards step fr om the more magical Golden Dawn and towards its Masonic roots. Mathers may have done this in the hope of attracting more Masonic members, who were well educated and wealthy, although he did not backtrack on the admission of women. This rite is streamlined fo r those who wanted to mass produce initiates rather than a complex system of interlocking magic. The short cuts indicate that Mathers either did not consider the magical information in his own Z documents as important, or that it was less important than getting bums on seats.

It is like the Eastern Orthodox priest who goes into the vault of his church and has a torch burst into flame, which he then hands to the faithful. In the Stella Matutina the Hierophant is appointed by the Second Order and is required to say his Oath to them. In Mathers' version of the ritual there is none of this. If the Hierophant did approach the Second Order it was done during a different, unrecorded, ritual. Although the Hierophant is required to set aside his sceptre, there is no indication that a new person replaces him. Much of the ritual is fo cused on the magical use of the Password of the Aeon as a Name ofPower. This technique is not used much now, even if it is still part of the Golden Dawn tradition. It is often used fo r security as beings who do not know it are not permitted into any Inner or Outer Order workings. The Password of the Aeon taps into the link between the temple and the Egregore of the Order. It is the key to an energetic reservoir which powers the Order fo r the entire solar cycle. We see in this rite the officers picking up their weapons in the name of the password. They are empowered fo r that solar cycle. Mathers' version of this ritual, however cut down and simplified"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"N!Cl(F.Al(R.f:LL it may be, reveals this important tradition as a magical operation. It answ ers many questions about why there were no consecration rituals fo r officers' weapons. Without the consecration using the Password of the Aeon they were simply dead wood. While the use of the password is done to death in this ritual, it is lacking in more important symbols that should be part of any Equinox rite. These rituals should emphasise solar cycles, and the change of tides, and other Golden Dawn rituals do this much better. Mathers appears less interested in going into any symbolic depths. Mathers' ritual only appears to apply to the Vernal Equinox and there were no other equinox rituals in the Nisi collection. It is possible that Berridge's temple only celebrated the Vernal Equinox, but this is unlikely. Either there is a missing rite or the Vernal Equinox was the same with the words Autumn in the place of Spring. S'VMMAI(T This rite is a lot shorter and less impressive than what had gone before and what was being used by the rebels. For a ritual to do with solar cycles there is little sunshine to see here. It is password obsessed and this seems to fit into the idea that Mathers wanted a more masonic approach fo r his Order."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"86 MATHER.§' LAST SECJ?..?T �gggii� RJT'V.AL ifCD=ITQ1 Grade if z:§L.ATOI( •••••• Grade if ..<dator Ta lmid 1\"i.j�n ol(Disciple * Implements Altar, Pilla rs, Banners as in Grade ofNeophyte.

The @=@ was a precursor to it and to many is a far more interesting ritual. If the Q)=[jQ] is done with the minimum of magical input, just by reading the script, it is somewhat of an anti-climax. But the rite was supposed to work with the material aspect of the personality and evolve it towards the Light. In the late 189os Mathers attempted to write some Z Notes on the Q)=[jQ] ritual while he was still in the Golden Dawn. These were printed by Pat Zalewski in his In ner Order Teachings of the Golden Dawn and might have been part of an attempt to do something similar fo r all the elemental grade rituals. However, the difference between the Z.I documents fo r the@=@ and these papers is huge. You would be excused fo r thinking that they had been written by two different people. The genius behind the Z documents seems to have gone out to lunch while his clever, but somewhat unimaginative brother trotted out a rather pedestrian explanation of the CD=[lQ]. Zalewski points out that the paper was handed out at the ThAM grade of the Alpha et Omega. It was eventually boosted to @=[3] in theA.O. (because it was considered \"too powerful\" for the ThAM) when the material it contained was given out by Brodie-Innes to the.Amen-R.g Temple in 189): Following Mathers' fo rmula there is little, other than a Spartan number of God-forms, used for this ritual. Most of the God­fo rms are the ones you would expect. Sandalphon (Hierophant), Metatron (Hegemon), Samael (Hiereus) are the new ones and they are apparently used fo r the whole ritual. The other god­fo rms are the same as the @=@. Mathers says that the God-form • The CD=[!Q] paper was printed by Zalewski in The Golden Dawn Ritual! and Commentariu on page 167."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"NICI(F.Al{.RfiLL 109 of.ADON.A/ H.A .ARfiTZstands in the East, while in front of the Tablet ofEarth is JC Z!]D HE CH.AL (looking like an old vigorous man, wearing a gold cross, black robe over his left shoulder and a golden sceptre in his right hand). Opposite him is MALJVIH the bride. These three invisible god-forms form a triad which work through the visible officers. Confusingly, Mathers says that if the Officer is of the correct grade, he should use these as god­fo rms, apparently fo rgetting that they are also supposed to be Sandalphon, Metatron and Samael. While your are required to shed the different god-forms at different parts of the ritual, say starting with the Invisible ones, moving to the angels and then back again, it is not a g ood idea to hold two at once. There are problems with linking two different symbols at the same time . In this case you would be making an association between JC -<:gD HE CH.AL and Samael. This is only remotely fair ifyou think that the Earth is a place of darkness, evil, death and destruction. Sandalphon is fine as the Archangel that responds to.ADON.AI H.A .A !?fiT� but Metatron, as the Angel of Kether, is the opposite ofMALJVIH. We do not know if this paper was being used by Berridge and the .Alpha et Omega . It has come down to us from Wh are R.e where it was used, although the God-forms were not. The paper has not appeared in the NISI documents, but there is reason to suspect that it was not part of the .A.O. corpus. The biggest magical change in this ritual comes in the pivotal moment in the ritual when the Hierophant interposes between the Hegemon and the Hiereus. In the Stella Matutina you learn that this is so that you can tell the difference between extremes, fo r by going the middle way you can overcome all blockages in your life and sphere of sensation. This is managed by the Hierophant thundering down the middle pillar and dramatically knocking aside the blocks placed on the candidate by both the Angels Samael and Metatron. These blocks are caused by going to extremes in life. Many people have reported \"a Mars energy\" which seems to come from the ground to knock aside something inside them and open the way and provide clarity Mathers is suggesting something else. In this ritual he has clearly described it as an interposing between the two fo rces. The Hierophant's wand, rather than crashing through the barriers"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"110 MATHER§, LAST SECRgT which fly away, stops at the crown. It stays around the level of the candidate's brow centre, or third eye. Theoretically this would cause the third eye, or aj na centre, to become active and create a sympathetic opening of the sacrel centre. This sounds reasonable, as the path between the base centre and the sacral has to be clear fo r the next level of working. Any imbalances are shifted upwards towards the Crown centre where they can be safely undone. The Hierophant then is mediating the fo rces ofSamael and Metatron. There are fe w problems with this. Firstly, the fu nction of the CD=UQI ritual should be mostly connected to the base centre and not the sacral. Secondly, leaving the Hiereus's sword and the Hegemon's Sceptre above that of the Hierophant's is a bad symbol. It implies that an ideal place fo r the Light represented by the Hierophant's wand is below that of the side pillars of the tree. In this position extremes control the central column. This movement cannot be done with your arm straight. This is important when you consider that the CD=UQI grade sign is based on it. Until now all depictions of this grade sign have been similar to the Nazi salute, but with the arm straight and the hand turned thumb upwards. The angle of the arm is H degrees but it would be impossible to stop at the brow centre, unless the Hierophant was a dwarf and the candidate was a giant. The only way to do it the way Mathers' describes is if the Hierophant's arm is bent at the elbow at 45' degrees. This is exactly what we see in drawings of the grade sign which appear in the later .A. O. documents. It would appear that Mathers had changed the grade sign fo r the Earth Grade so that it fitted into the Cipher documents and ritual's description but was different from the early Golden Dawn. It seems sad that Mathers' one magical contribution to this ritual does not pan out. It may not be magical at all. Mathers may have just changed it with the sole purpose of having a different grade sign to the rebels. The Banner of the West seems to have a lif e of its own wandering away from its owner. Normally we see the Banner of the West attached to the Hiereus, other than when we are at a point in the ritual where we enter a Sphere on the Tree of Life. Like its name suggests, it spends a lot of time in the Western quarter. But in the opening of the CD=UQI we see the Banner of the West in the East flanking the Hierophant. If we use Mathers' paper as a"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"NICJ(F.Al(RfiLL III reference, the logic fo r this can only be that the candidate spends all ofhis time in Malkuth and therefore the banner must be in the same positions that it is in fo r the final points of the <!J=[2], Q)=[ID and@=[]]. But again Mathers has missed what the Banner of the West represents. It is a fo rm of protection against those fo rces which come from the West. It prevents lower energy flooding into the temple. Malkuth is a holy sphere, but as the ritual opens, the temple has not been elevated to that spiritual state. By putting the Banner of the West in the East during the first point of the ritual, when the temple has not been lifted fu rther into the Immeasurable Region, you are symbolically allowing the fo rces of the West control of the temple. You are asking the Hiereus to defend it without his main symbol of protection. Mathers has done little to stop the lower aspects of Malkuth expressing themselves in the ritual. He could have placed some protection on the portal which fo rms between the pillars. However the ritual does not mention anything about this. The officer whose job it is to keep the dog-faced demons at bay is huddled behind the black pillar and well away fr om any problems that might come growling and snuffiing from the West. The other traditional use of the Banner of the West was to shut off access to a path. By placing it next to the Hierophant throughout the first part of the ritual you are blocking off access to the paths on the left (as you look to the East) and allowing access to the right hand path. The effect of this would be to allow the lunar path ofQQph to dominate the ritual. Add these two factors together, shifting the Banner of the West means you are flooding the temple with unbalanced, astral, lunar energy, while at the same time letting anything you like to come from the place of greatest darkness to enter the Temple of Solomon. Magically this would be suicide, but it works if you are using a rational masonic approach to symbols and rituals. If there is a \"rule\" that when a ritual enters into a sphere on the Tree of Life, the banners are bought together, the rule becomes more important than magical considerations such as psychic self defence. The rule and the tradition will provide a meaning of its own. But the Golden Dawn is so layered that sometimes those rules don't work or are less important than magical considerations.

During the opening we find something that Pat Zalewski mentions in his Golden Dawn Ri,tua!J Commentaries. In the early Golden Dawn and Whare Rg, the Hierophant orders the temple to be consecrated with fire before being purified with water, yet the reverse is done and the temple is purified and then consecrated. In Mathers' ritual this is tidied up so that it is done correctly. cl.n only two ritua!J in the Golden Dawn are the Water and Fire CoruecratioTU reversed: the CD=[iQ] ceremony and the coruecration of the Vault.

When [purifying and] consecrating a person in Earth the reverse occurs and this should be the only exception. In the Golden Dawn Cipher Manu.rcripts Fire and Water are given in [purifYing and] coTUecrating the candidate. Mathers suggested the coTUecration of the Temple should follow the same pattern. ,, . What the Berridge Temple Zelator ritual shows is that Mathers seems to have reached the same conclusion as Zalewski by the time he had formed the .A.

However since the Regardie Golden Dawn rituals were hacked, it is difficult to find a fu ll Golden Dawn version of this rite, so there is much material in here which has not been seen before. There are some curiosities. Firstly there is the use of a red lamp in the North before the Earth tablet. Normally I would think it was a mistake by the person making the copy, however the copyist has added the information which is different fr om the last diagram, one which simply talks about a lamp being in fr ont of theN orthern tablet. Saying it is red it would have required a jump in his mind to add the extra information. Placing a candle before an active tablet was standard procedure in the Golden Dawn right through to Whare R.g. However in Wh are R.g at least these were coloured, black fo r earth; blue, fo r water; red, fo r fire and Yellow fo r Air. This colour tradition was rolled into the Order of the Ta ble J?..gund where it is still used. Qg!te why red lamps are being used seems odd. Red does not really fit into the symbolism of the Earth grade. By placing it there in the a>=C2J grade you are implying that the fiery aspects of the Earth grade have carried you to this level, which is not true. Red lamps were part of Catholic worship· where it indicates the presence of God in the reserved sacrament and were quite easy to find. However in an age of candles white ones would have been easier to locate. 'I make this reference because there is a rumour put about by Ithell Colquhoun that Mathers converted to Roman Catholicism, perhaps under the influence of his Paris Temple. A paper The R.t_a/ and True /?.£1icrucian Order appeared in the April 1917 issue of.Atoth Monthly. In it Mathers states: \"We have profound respect fo r Christianity and are in no sense hostile to the Roman Catholic Church ... and we consider that the Roman Catholic Church has resolutely preserved in its ceremonies the August Symbols of the Divine Wisdom\". (pp.21o-212). This is hardly a conversion by any stretch of the imagination."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"MATHER.§, LAST SECR.f:T The instructions say there is a cup of water in the North side and red lamp in the South. This is clearly a substitute fo r the Stolisties and the Dadouchos who are not present in this ritual. It is most likely that the that the copyest was confused. Magically, there should be a lamp of some sort in front of that elemental tablet regardless of what colour it should be. This has the magical effect of passively lighting up that tablet of that element to work with the candidate as they go through the initiation. One thing that is missed here is that the elements placed on the altar represent aspects of the candidate's sphere of sensation. These are dragged out to the quarters where they are arranged by the god-forms of the officers and then used to purify the candidate. They are then drawn together at the conclusion of this part of the ritual. In the second part of the ritual there is a difference in the position of the pillars. In Wh are R,g they were placed a little West of the altar meaning that the candidate had to step between them to approach the altar. In Mathers' ritual they are placed on either side of the altar at some distance away. Regardie appears to be between the two extremes. Two pillars are always a portal. In the Wh are R,g version you have to go through it just a little to experience the deeper mysteries of the <2>=[2]. In Mathers version the Mysteries .AR.f: the portal. When the candidate stands at that point something is supposed to happen and what is interesting in the difference between these two ideas is that they both lead you to different places, quite literally. Neither is wrong and neither is completely right. Now we come to the reason why the Bannerofthe Ea.ttand West are missing. Although not in the original diagram, the instructions fo r the ritual indicate that Mathers hung the diagram of the Serpent on the Paths on the Banner of the West and this is placed either on or close to the altar. Wh are R.g placed the Banner of the West in the West fo r both parts of the ritual. We have a problem here. Did Mathers' just put the diagram on the Banner of the West fo r convience, or did he do it deliberately? If it was the fo rmer then he was an idiot if it was the latter then there might have been a sinister purpose. Placing the diagram on the Banner of the West is a serious piece of Magic. The attachment of an object to the Banner of the West stops"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"NICI(F.AJ(J<?LL it from taking any action and neutralises it. Magically, Mathers is showing the candidate the symbol of the tree, which is a symbol of spiritual progress, but at the same time blocking its use completely. The purpose might be an attempt to prevent a person travelling up the tree \"until they are ready\". This diagram appears again in the (3)=ffi] and it might be at this point that Mathers wanted people to travel up the path. If this was the case he underestimated the power of the Banner of the West. Doing something like this in an initiation ritual to a candidate cuts them off from the powers of the East and risks stopping them making any progress beyond the �=[2]. One of the adepts of Wh are R.g once taught me a technique which involved shutting down someone's psychic abilities permanently using the Banner of the West. It could only be carried out in certain circumstances, and under tough ritual conditions, but the primary symbol was attaching the person to the Banner. Attaching the Serpent diagram to the Banner of the West would have a similar effect. The Serpent is a vision of a person's progresss in the Order. It is placing a map in their sphere of sensation. If you place this diagram on the Banner of the West it would mean that when a candidate rose to the spiritual state represented by the �=[2] and the the 21St Path they would be stopped from going any fu rther. They may progress in the Order, but magicially and spiritually they would be frozen. The Banner of the West freezes whatever is behind it and in this case it is the Hierophant and the path of Samekh. This would appear fair enough, given that path is blocked fo r now. Indeed, if the Banner had been placed behind the Hierophant this would make sense. But by tying the Banner of the West to the Serpent diagram you are sending a strong magical message that the candidate may not ever progress up the path ofSamekh. It is a symbol that they are cut off fr om the Higher Self who dwells in the Middle Pillar and is represented by the Hierophant in this ritual. The question is why would Mathers do this? So far the @=@ and CD=[!Q] appears to be a dumbing down of the system to something that is purely intellectual and Masonic. But this is a hidden magical change. It is a deliberate blocking of spiritual progress and it means that any attempts by a person to rise beyond the First Order will be"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"MATHER.§' LAST SECRfiT stopped. It could have been incompetence on the part of Mathers. He might have believed that all he was doing was stopping the candidate going up the Middle Pillar without going into Hod and N etzach first. Or it could have been a deliberate attempt to keep his students at a level which would not threaten him again. This would make Mathers a paranoid megalomaniac of epic proportions who was desperate to prevent anyone getting the magical ability to challenge him ever again. The Banner of the EaJt is not mentioned in this ritual. It would be safe to assume that it was held by the Hierophant, although the other grade rituals suggest the Kameas might have been attached to the Banner. Although the Banner of the EaJt was not used as a barrier, like the Banner of the West, it does not seem to be a good symbol upon which to hang Kamea diagrams. When you put one symbol on top of another you have to think \"what will this do to the candidate.\" Binding the source oflight of a ritual to a blind planetary fo rce is not sensible. This ritual uses active and passive spirit pentagrams before performing the elemental pentagram. The modern Golden Dawn just use active spirit pentagrams for Air and Fire and Passive Spirit pentagrams fo r Water and Earth. Whare Rg tended towards using the Modern Golden Dawn System in personal workings, but I was told that they used the version described here fo r the elemental grades. I have not seen a reverse ritual written down when you use both spirit pentagrams. SVMMAI(T Mathers did little to this ritual. If you rule out that it was all part of a cunning plan to neuter the long term spiritual progress of his students, then it indicates Mathers had either fo rgotten the magical importance of some of the symbols of the ritual, or fo r the sake of convenience, was happy to get rid of them fo r the weakest of reasons."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"NJCJ(F.AJ\\.RfiLL ••••• RJT'V.AL if{]=[[] Grad e of PI(ICTIC'VS BBR�iii Grade of Practicus Bei-.AMON' jr.J�-�l':J.

Some of these speeches are complicated and use archaic language which would have been difficult, even in Mathers' day. It is telling that some of the easiest of speeches are lifted from the Chaldean Oracles of Z!!foa.rter. These are normally considered difficult to manage, so it says much that other speeches fill officers with dread as they try to work them. The idea of making a few improvements to sentence structure did not appear to enter Mathers' mind. Few changes to the wording to the original Golden Dawn Ritual have been made. Although there are no Z documents to apply to this ritual, the instructions mention that the Hierophant corresponds to Axieros; the Hiereus corresponds to Axiokersos etc. implies that these titles over ride the God-forms of earlier workings and are applied throughout the G)=[ID ritual. If this is so, then Mathers has gone down an incredibly simple route in comparison to what was being performed in Wh are R.g. It would appear that Mathers just wanted the Samothracian God-forms and no other divine fo rces. There is also the note that the Kerux is not present. Some Modern Golden Dawn groups have suggested that although officers are not mentioned in the grades, they should still be present, just unused. Q.Ejte where they would sit is never explained. Mathers makes it clear that the Dadouchos, Stolistes should not be present after the CD=[lQ] and the Kerux after the (2)=[2]. I agree completely with Mathers as there is some important teaching.

These tend to Hood into the temple, if they are not carefully controlled. This makes the positions of the Hegemon and Hiereus vital. In the Stella Matutina they were placed along the Western Wall. The Hiereus was armed with his banner which could keep those negative and unbalanced fo rces in check. Pat Zalewski suggests that this fo rms a fire triangle of power between the officers. This would help balance the water energy as it comes pouring out of the tablet. Mathers did not see this.

Magically, it would prevent the candidate using the symbolism of this diagram in their sphere of sensation. The final point places the Garden of Eden Diagram on the Banner of the 1-Ve.rt and places it halfWay between the Hierophant and the East and the candidate. This appears to be designed to prevent the candidate fr om going up the path ofMem, but it would disconnect him from the light represented by the East and the Hierophant.

The Moon is in the increase on the side of Gedulah, and from it proceed sixteen principal and sixteen secondary rays, which together make p, the number of the Paths ofYetzirah.

It is to be noted that the symbol of the Sign Pisces is fo rmed of the two lunar crescents of Gedulah and Geburah bound together, Wand thus shows the [lunar J nature of the Sign. The Dogs are the Jackals of the Egyptian Anubis, guarding the Gates of the East and of the West, shown by the two Towers, between which lies the Path of all the Heavenly Bodies ever rising in the East and setting in the West.

And the word used in the passage in Numbers 21 fo r Fiery Serpents, is the same as the name of the angels ofGeburah, the same spelling, the same pointing, Seraphim, around the middle Pillar of the Sephiroth, because that is the reconciler between the Fires of Geburah and Severity, and the Waters of Chesed or Mercy, and hence it is said in the New Testament, that it is a type of Christ, the Reconciler. And the Serpent is of Brass, the Metal ofVenus, whose Sphere is called Nogah or External Splendour, as shown fu rther in the Alchemic symbol of the Planet Venus, wherein the circle of the Sun is exalted above the Cross of corrosion. •And therefore it is said in the Zohar, that alone of the Shells is the Serpent Nogah fo und in Holiness, and he is called the Bilauxt of Justice. Why then is he called the External or false Splendour? Because he indeed uniteth the Paths but comprehendeth not the Sephiroth. Nevertheless he is also the Celestial Serpent of Wisdom.

The ritual mentions the \"priest with the mask of. .. ,\" but in the AO rituals, masks are not listed as being part of the equipment. It appears that the mask reference might suggest the God-forms that are being used at the time. Nisi has given us two Tarot cards to look at - the Star and the Tower. These are superficially similar to those published by Regardie and Wang and Pat Zalewski. However, there are some differences. The Star card emphasises the water which is being poured from the two jars. The fronds on the Palm Trees have lost the planetary attributions that Zalewski provides and Regardie misses. The Tree ofLife has leaves in the later decks, while on this it doesn't. The Tower lacks a lot of the detail of the Stella Matutina decks, although it has more in common with Regardie than Zalewski. Here there are two circles with triangles emerging from the Sun (Zalewski and Regardie have three). The two figures falling from the Tower are different with one seeming to lean out of the window and being sick rather than falling. Mathers has not been shy about depicting the Q!!ppoth. Felkin later tried to replace it by putting the circles in the same form as the geomantic fo rm of Rubeus. NISI also calls it the Tower rather than the Blasted Tower. The @=[]] text would appear to have been totally unchanged from the Early version of the Ritual, but there has not been a published version of this ritual before. The startling difference is the naming of the 12 princes of the Q!!ppoth. The Hermes Temple in Bristol was theoretically under the control of the Felkins who were running their \"Whare Ra\" temple in New Zealand. The administration of Bristol by the New Zealand temple was non­existent. Just before Regardie was initiated the English temple had decided to undergo an experiment. The fe eling was that the Golden Dawn rituals were too long and almost a third of the elemental grade rituals were spent presenting diagrams to the candidate. The temple decided to take a hatchet to the elemental grade rituals and remove most of the diagrams and present these to the candidate as part of their course packets. It is incredibly unlikely that if the Felkins had known of this plan they would have ever approved of it. First to go were the so-called"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"NICl(F.Al\\_R.fiLL 209 evil diagrams. The Bristol temple was terrified ofblack magic and felt that the naming of these beings in open temple would cause the candidate to be overly influenced by evil fo rces. The names and diagrams related to evil beings were cut from the rituals and were given to the candidate after the rite, often with the whispered advice that the names should not be spoken out-loud. But the g iving of the evil names, which happens throughout the grade rituals always fo llows a similar exposure to diagrams which show things like the Seven Heavens. The idea is similar to the process of the CD=OQJ where the candidate first experiences pure good and then pure evil so that they can identify these fo rces and chart a middle way between them. It was also quite unlikely that the \"inepti\" of the Bristol Temple, as Regardie was fond of ca lling them, would have understood the magical implications of what they were doing, or even researched them. It is myth that theAO and Golden Dawn temples closed when the book was published because Regardie had revealed their secrets. The AO at the time was using a slightly different ritual than the ones which have been published in Nisi. Its elemental grade rituals were more or less the completed ones which we see here. They are more involved than anything seen in Regardie's The Golden Dawn. Wh are R.e was doing extremely well and did not suffer any real problems until the 196os. The Bristol temple appears to have been going until the 196os and its adepts were still meeting occasionally for rituals until the 197os. Part of the reason fo r this was that Regardie had published the hacked rituals and teachings of the Bristol temple. As far as the existing temples were concerned they still had secrets. The rituals, as published, were lacking the inner mechanics to make them work properly. It is telling that after the publication of the book, Bristol went back to the original Stella Matutina rituals, probably after a stiff letter from Mrs Felkin who was still technically its boss. In the late 197os, Wh are R.g, closed its doors and burnt most of its material. The direct lineage of the Golden Dawn was ended. While the rest of the world was unaware of the death of Wh are R.g, something significant did happen around the same time. Chic Cicero and other Regardie friends decided to restart the order. To"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"210 MATHER§� LAST SECR.§T do this they depended on Regardie's book and memories from the man himself and this is where the holes started to become obvious. People were expecting an awful lot from Regardie. According to Bristol records he only ever attended Bristol seven times during a two and a half year period. To expect someone in their eighties to remember details of a ritual that took place 40 years earlier was unfair. It is clear that he relied on his book, like many other people would do as they fo llowed the Ciceros in the resurgence of the \"Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn\" that followed. When we installed the fu ll ve rsions of the elemental grade rituals within the Magical Order of the .Aurora .Aurea we fo und that the @=[]],in particular, was a lot longer. Superficially, the candidate is led to one of the diagrams by an officer who appears to read out what was on it. It seems pointless. Indeed some modern Golden Dawn orders, if they use the diagrams at all, slap photocopies on the floor of the temple and casually mention them. The one exception to this appears to be the elemental tablets, which are accorded a high status as magical tools. In Whare Ra each diagram was seen like a magical implement and an important part of the ritual. Percy Wilkinson, a @=[3], once told me that the officer had to use the diagram to stimulate the candidate's Ruach. For years I wondered what he meant and experimented with sending a ray through the diagram into the candidate's heart centre. This has changed over the years. The candidate is shown the diagram, the godform of the officer is extended over the candidate and an image of the diagram is projected onto their sphere of sensation. Depending on the diagram this creates an effect. For a while I assumed that the diagrams were providing a set of symbols fo r the candidate to understand unconsciously. But the result is more direct and the diagram shapes the candidate's sphere of sensation to bring about change. The elemental grade rituals are a fo rm of psychic surgery where the diagrams shape the candidate's sphere in their own image. When you look at the diagrams it seems strange that some of the information is repeated in various grades. For some reason, geomantic figures are shown in all the grades, lineal figures are also shown in different varia tions, as are tarot cards. We are shown"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"NIC.l(F.AJ?.... R.fiLL 211 several versions ofQlippoth diagrams which fe el out of place in an initiation oflight. The presentation of the geomantic figures enables the energy of the initiation to be earthed so that there is a physical result from the initiation. The geometric shapes of the lineal figures would cause the candidate's sphere of sensation to correctly align at a Briatic level. There are many diagrams with trees on them in which planetary symbols are overlayed upon them. The effect of these is to open the sphere of sensation to the implications of planetary fo rce on the personal Tree ofLife. There are some traditional Golden Dawn diagrams where the \"magic implement effect\" must be limited. One \"diagram\" is a shopping list of tarot attributions which would have had limited symbolic effect. There are others which have since gone missing and we have to build them based on their description. In a couple of cases this has proved difficult, but was resolved by groups that use the full rituals. For example, in the Magical Order of the .Aurora .Aurea, we re-drew them so that they were more graphical. There were some other things that were cut from the elemental grade rituals. These included the Hierophant outlining the knowledge that the candidate would have to learn in the grade.

The cubical altar represents the Universe, right and left of it, and bound thereto by a cord attached to a circle which typifies the centre of the earth, are two smaller demons, one male, the other fe male, they hold the cord in their hands. The whole figure shows the gross generative powers ofNature on the material plane; and is analogous to the Pan of the Greeks, and the Egyptian goat ofMendes, the symbol ofKhem. In certain respects this Key represents the brutal fo rces of nature, which to the unbeliever only obscure and do not reflect the luminous countenance of God.

It is not because it shows Mathers in a radical departure from the past, but rather it is quite the opposite. Mathers kept the same Portal ritual which he developed fairly early on in Golden Dawn history. Comparisons between this ritual and George Pollexfen's copy of the Portal fr om 1895' show that the two rites were identical. \\Vhat makes this important is that it is the first time that the Golden Dawn ritual has been published. For years some believed that Regardie had published the early Golden Dawn rituals in his Complete Sys tem of the Golden Dawn. However, Regardie printed material which was in the Gardiner collection. The Portal Version was similar to the one he had printed in his earlier The Golden Dawn book, which is a version written by the Stella Matutina. The only thing different was the placement of the diagrams, which were moved by Felkin's 1Fhare R.g."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":".. �. � � \" r·--MATHER.§, LAST SECR§T �11fM..J&u-.CM4 -f.- Jai;-;.L 11u..!l.4� .N� a-_j ,.( .g6d &&nu 4t:,��P> .!ti�::EJ Westcott's diagram of the earlier version ofthe Portal (above) is identical to Nisi, although some of the diagrams appear to have been placed in slightly different positions (this might be a copyist's error). We have seen that Mathers changed some of the rituals, movements and diagrams of the Outer Order rituals, but he did not touch this one. This ritual is completely different from that of the Stella Matutina and attempts to fo llow the same models that were used for the Outer Order. The difference between this ritual and the other grade rituals is that Mathers did not have the Cipher Manuscript to pr ovide him with a structure. It shows. This Portal ritual was unpopular within the Golden Dawn. One of the reasons that Annie Horniman quit the Golden Dawn was that the rebels were using an \"unauthorised version\" of the Portal ritual. Once Mathers had gone, the rebels had started to re-write"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"NJCJ(F.Al(R.§LL the Portal ritual into the fo rmula that would evolve into the version that Regardie published in his Complete Sys tem of the Golden Dawn. A re-write was needed. The ritual shows the weaknesses of Mathers and Westcott and the lack of understanding that they had of the magical aspects of the Golden Dawn. It shows a tendency to default to the Masonic methods when they were not sure what to do. Firstly we see that they have done something odd to the pillars. The black pillar is placed in the South West and the white one in the North East. This is so wacky that there has to be a really good reason fo r it. I have been unable to find a Masonic reason, so I will go fo r a magical one. Throughout the entire Outer Order the pillars have been associated with portals and gateways. They are always seen together. Placing them in this position slashes a large vortex across the temple from the North East to the South West. This vortex can only be the Veil ofParoketh. The pillars are flipped so that the White one is on the left and the black is on the right. Flipping the Pillars is not a mistake. It is done several times within the Golden Dawn tradition. Westcott says in Flying Roll IX: cin every diagram and picture, the right hand side of the observer is next to the Pillar of Mercy-Chokmah, Chesed, and Net'{_ach; while the Pillar of Severity is on the observer's left hand. Tet when you app ly the Tr ee of Life to yourself, your right side, arm, and leg represent the side of Strength and Severity, Binah, Geburah and Hod, and your left side refers to the Pillar of Mercy. So that when you look at a diagram, you are looking, as it were, at a man focingyou, that your ri'ght si'de faces his left. His Merciful si'de forms the right hand Pi'llar i'n front of you, so that i't i's as if you looked at yourselfi'n a mirror. That i's, the whi'te Mercy or Jachin Pillar is on your right hand as you approach the .Altar from the West and from the Hiereus. (See Ch roniCles II. iiz� q.) cAnd call the Na me on the right hand (of hi'm who enters) Jachin, and the Na me of that on the left, Boa{;\" In this rite we have the Hierophant Inductor sitting on the other side of portal, mirroring the candidate and providing the perfected image of reality. The pivot of these two worlds is the altar, which is the point"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"MATHER§' LAST SECR.§T where the veil opens. This explains why the veil ofParoketh is not represented physically as it is in the later Portal Rite, but is talked about all the time. The Enochian tablets are away from the altar in the \"real wo rld\". Like the vault, where the elemental tablets are only allowed on the door, they cannot enter this spiritual world. The analogy to the vault is strengthened by the fact that the diagram of the Cherubim is on the outside of the veil. They are guarding it as they would the doors of the vault, and mirror the seven palaces of the Briatic World, which are a micro-symbol of the Vault itself. So why did Mathers and Westcott create Paroketh from the North East to the South East? The North-East is attributed to the Letter Heh and the South West the letter Nun which gives us the password of CD=[lQ], which is the beginning of the Outer Order. The North East is the place where the Kerux makes his announcements and the South \\Vest is where his throne is placed. The Banners balance the Pillars. The Banner of the \\Vest is on the side of matter and the Banner of the East is on the side of Spirit. This emphasises the duality ofTiphareth. There are only two inner order officers. Irritatingly we have no idea what they are wearing because the Nisi ritual has been unable to su pply us with that information. \\Vhile it is likely that this would be unchanged between the early and late .Alpha et Omega , my copy of the later .A. O. ritual is missing an officer's description. It is likely that the Hierophant Inductor wore a white robe and golden shoes and the Hierophant's lamen. The Associate Adept wore black, possibly with the Hiereus's lam en. Unfortunately, this is just speculation and both could be dressed in white. Magically it looks like we are trying to deal with two great fo rces of polarity which drive the candidate upwards into Tiphareth. So far, we can say that Mathers and Westcott are onto something and the ritual looks interesting. But suddenly the rot settles in. We come to the opening which uses what Mathers calls a CONVET.ANCE of the Signs. Mathers was obsessed with the Masonic idea that by stating passwords or giving grade signs you somehow conferred some magical power on a person or allowed them to project it. His entire ritual fo r the @=[3] was based around this idea. \\Vhile @=[3] was rarely performed, it must have been a source of disappointment to those who took part, particularly if"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"NICJ(F.Al(R.f:LL they had to part with large amounts of cash to obtain it. The opening has the candidate repeating all the divine names, numbers and passwords of the grades. The idea is that it elevates the people in the room by linking into their sphere of sensation and causing it to ascend. Few can reach an elevated state by this method and certainly no one in the Outer Order. The Hierophant Inductor mentions that the candidate has passed five exams and stayed in the @=[]] fo r a period of seven months. This is traditional Golden Dawn, but could explain why there were so many seats required fo r the G:l=[[] and @=[]] grades. The time delay would have created a bottle neck at the @=[]], while candidates, who might have been rushed through the other grades, had to wait no matter how fast their Chief wanted to advance them. The candidate enters the temple without a blindfold and is tested by the Associate Adept. This confirms symbolically that he has all the required knowledge to enter the Portal. Unlike the other grades, where he only needs to remember some of the information, the candidate is here required to symbolically know everything the Outer Order has to teach him. This idea was carried on in the Stella Matutina version of the ritual. He is then required to make an oath on the Tablet ofEquilibrium, which is in the centre of the fo ur tablets lying flat on a table. None of these tablets have been opened as part of the ritual and therefore are passive. Indeed it would be hard to fit these all tablets onto a conventional cubic altar without some inelegant overhang. Magically this act will not serve to balance much of the candidate and would not be as powerful as the Ritual of the Elements which was written by the Stella Matutina. Mathers appeared to think that it was possible to go through fo ur intense elemental rituals and then tie up the whole lot by giving spirit a halfhearted attempt to manifest. The candidate is then required to go to the Black Pillar and place his right hand on it, while making his oath while holding the Banner of the West in his left hand. Since the black pillar represents the Outer Order this makes sense. The Banner is in his left (passive) hand which means that he is binding his unconscious self. This unbalancing increases his active power which then finds its balance by touching the pillar. He is polarising his positive side with the"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"MATHER§J LAST SECRfiT Outer Order. He is not required to touch the White Pillar, nor does he cross into the East and southern part of the temple. This suggests that Mathers and Westcott did not consider the person truly through the veil ofParoketh. Nor does the ritual try to take the candidate up any paths, although it tells them the way. Mathers is still referring to the ritual as being fo r the Order of the Golden Dawn. It is fo ur years since the split, which means it is unlikely that he changed the rituals and no one in the .A. O. realised that they should not copy that name down. There then begins a tour of the diagrams which are placed on the outer side ofParoketh. The candidate is led to the fo ot of the altar and the Hierophant comes down off his throne to show him his lamen. The ritual does not indicate that anyone is moving with the sun. To do that they would have to cross the veil ofParoketh. The diagrams on the altar are explained by the Hierophant who stands on the opposite side ofit. There is little movement. The candidate is shown the diagrams and tarot keys, which must have been quite large and hung on the wall. The diagram of Pan and the two tarot keys are picked up by the Hierophant and taken to the altar before they are returned to their place. The \"magic bit\" of the ritual is when the candidate is told the password, given the grade signs and his sash. One can only fe el that this is an anti-climax. The Portal sash described here is different fr om the Stella MatutinaJ having a gold border and the \"Emblem of the G)=ffi] Grade\" embroidered in Gold along with the 24th, 2)th and 26th paths. Mathers and Westcott jumped the gun with this. Although the candidate has been shown the Tarot cards connected to these paths, he has not awarded them the title of Lord or Lady of the 24th, 2)th and 26th paths. Like the Stella Matutina rite, the candidate is not the master of these paths until they have reached the G:>=ffiJ properly. There are those who will claim that I am biased in favour of the Stella Matutina because of my links to Wh are R.g. The truth is that I do prefer its version of the Portal Ritual. It not only does more magically, it fits much better into the structure of the Golden Dawn."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"NJCJ(F.Al(l(ELL This ritual does not do enough to attempt to balance the elements in the candidate, nor does it deal with the Egyptian magic of the previous five grades. It started promisingly, but it ended up being a long talky rite that really gives the candidate nothing. Given that it was not actually based on the cipher manuscripts, the rebels clearly felt that they could jettison it and write their own, although they have used it as an influence. Their initial mistake appears to have been copying this ritual too closely and placing the diagrams on the dais. Later they were moved and given a better position. There is a theory that the Portal ritual was broken off from the G)=lli] to shorten it. It would mean that the full G)=lli] would follow soon after. Some believe it was even done on the same day. This would explain the the Sash, and lack of a Portal curriculum or a waiting period of nine months between the Portal and the G)=ffil. As the relationship between the First and Second Orders became more complex, the Portal ritual had to be redeveloped to become a more stand alone rite. Mathers did not bother, but the rebels did. However, the lack of a curriculum was never really worked out. Modern Golden Dawn groups tend to ask fo r a IO,ooo word essay summing up their experience in the First Order. This ritual was not worthy of the Golden Dawn. It does not develop the techniques of the First Order. It tries to be a Second Order ritual, but symbolically fails to give any magical guidance into Tiphareth. It provides no balancing, and therefore loses the significant teaching of the Portal, which is, that it is only through the balancing of the elements that spirit can manifest in the body of Osiris."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"MATHER.§J LAST SECR§T G)=[ill RJTV.AL Of .ADEPT'VS MJNOI( (1908) .Arrangement of the TEMPLE or the OPENING 3rd dept Vault Door D Chief .Adept Officers are required to workJ namely: 2nd .Adept Chief Adept (])=@] called Merciful Exempt Adept.

Th ird .Adept: Know then Oh Aspirant, that the Order of the Rose and Cross hath existed from time immemorial; and that its mystic rites were practiced and its hidden knowledge communicated in the initiations of the various races of antiquity. Egypt, Eleusis and Samothrace, Persia, Chaldaea and India alike cherished its mysteries and thus handed down to posterity the Secret Wisdom of Ancient Ages. Many were its Temples and among many nations were they established, though in the process of time some lost the purity of their primal knowledge. Howbeit, the manner of its introduction into mediaeval Europe was thus: In 1378 was born the Chief and Originator of our Fraternity in Europe. He was of a noble family but poor and in the fifth year of his age was placed in a monastery where he learned both Greek and Latin. While yet a youth he accompanied another brother PAL on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, but the latter dying in Cyprus, he himself went to Damascus. There was then in Arabia a temple of our Order which was called in the Hebrew tongue, 1JrJ1, Dam Car, the \"Blood of the Lamb\". He was duly initiated and took the mystic title ofC.R.C, Christian Rosenkreutz, or Christian Rose-Cross. He then so far as improved his knowledge of the Arabian tongue that in the following year he translated the Book M into Latin, which he afterwards bought back to Europe. After three years he went on into Egypt. There was another temple of our Order. He remained there fo r a time, still studying the mysteries ofN ature. Mter this he travelled by sea to the City of Pezza or Fez, where he was made welcome by the temple of our Order which was there established and he obtained the knowledge and acquaintance with the habitants of the Elements who revealed unto him many of their secrets. Of the Fraternity at Fez, he confessed that they had not"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"NI CI(F.Al(J?.fiLL retained our knowledge in its primal purity and that their Qill>alah was, to a certain extent, altered to their religion. Nevertheless he learned much there. Mt er a stay of two years he came back into Spain where he endeavoured to reform the errors of the learned according to the pure knowledge he had received. But it was to them a laughing matter and they reviled and rejected him as the Prophets of old were rejected. Thus also was he treated by those of his own and other nations when he showed them the errors in religion that had crept in. So after five years residence in Germany he initiated three of his fo rmer monastic brethren. Fratres G.V., LA., and LO. who had more knowledge than many others of that time. And by these fo ur was made the fo undation of the Fraternity in Europe. These worked and studied the writings and other knowledge which C.R.C. had bought with him; and by them was some of the magical language transcribed (which is that of the elemental tablets) and a dictionary thereof made and the rituals and part of the Book M were transcribed. For the true order of the R.C. descended into the depths and ascenths even unto the throne of God Himself and includeth even Angels, Archangels and Spirits. These fo ur Fratres were also erected a building to serve fo r a Temple and headquarters of their order and called I the Collegium ad Spiritum Sanctum, or College of the Holy Spirit. This being now finished, and the work of establishing the Order extremely heavy, and because they devoted much time to the healing of those sick and possessed, who resorted to them, they initiated fo ur others, vi�: Fratres R.C.

Westcott said that he did not have a hand in writing it·. Mathers told Westcott that the ritual came from materials provided to him by a Frater Lux Ex Tenebris who was a continental adept. Later, Felkin was to claim that Frater L.E.T. was a Dr. Thiesen, ofLiege, although research by Bob Gilbert fo und that such a person did not exist. There is nothing to suggest in any of the letters that Mathers sent Westcott that Frater L.E.T. was an incarnate human. Mathers went to Paris but said that he was \"much in communication with\" Frater L.E.T and \"other Chiefs\". This is not the phrase you would use if you were regularly meeting people to sort out a ritual. It is the sort of language you would use if you were conducting some fo rm of seance. The other comment from Mathers to Westcott about Frater L.E.T. was \"you are right when you suspected that I was in contact with a higher level adept\", which is definitely the language ofTheosophical style contacts. Fra. Vota Vita Mea, in his letter of June 20, 1888 to Westcottt revealed that Frater L.E.T. was, at one level, the Archangel Raphael. The letter describes an Inner Working which had an anotation by Mathers. In the working: ccFra.

The claim was made in a letter to Florence Farr. Horos claimed she was his secret chief in an attempt to con money from him. Aft er that experience, Mina and Samuel never claimed to meet any Secret Chief in the flesh ever again. It would appear that the Second Order corpus was received telepathically from the Angel Raphael. There are el ements of the <3>=lli! ritual which we know came fr om Westcott, particularly to do with the Lam ens and the construction of the Vault. It was Westcott who wrote the BOOI(OFTHE TOMB and he was constructing the lamens in the U.K. (and showed them to Annie Horniman). However, Westcott clearly didn't think that his efforts were as significant as the ritual. He fe lt that Mathers had obtained a ritual from somewhere and it was good. Even Waite was impressed with what Mathers had written, saying that the <3>=llil had the \"root matter of a greater scheme than ever dawned in the consciousness of any maker ofMasonic degrees\". For this reason, it is unsurprising that Mathers made few changes to the <3>=llil, and neither did, fo r that matter, the rebel temples. Felkin believed it came from a perfect Rosicrucian source and felt it unwise to tinker with it. The Nisi version does contain some minor changes to the ritual and hints that Mathers was mass initiating people through the rite. It is written with handy breaks to enable each candidate to be taken through at that point. The ritual refers to \"aspirants\" at various points, but during the crucifixion it only talks about \"the aspirant\". The most significant change that can be seen is the regalia of the three Adepti Officers. There are Alchemical Sigils of the Principles placed on the back of each Officer. This is not mentioned in the Gardner version of the Golden Dawn <3>=lli!, nor in the Yeats version, or in the published Stella Matutina versions. They do appear in the Pollexfen manuscripts which are dated fr om I89f· It would appear that these changes were made late in the Golden Dawn history but only used by Mathers' .Alpha et Omega .

The use of the world MIHI is unusual as it is not a magical word and simply means \"Me\". It might be a fault of the person writing the ritual as it could be shorthand fo r the phrase JESVS MIHI OMNJ.A which was written in the circular table of the Vault and means JesUJ ir everything to me. Since the phrase was written in the centre of a planetary vault, its use here makes sense. The magician sees himself at the vault's heart and taking control of the planets in the Name ofJesus. However, MIHI by itself is meaningless. Whether it is MIHI or JESVS MIHI OMNJ.A, it is only said at the beginning and towards the East. The Berridge Temple rituals only went as far as �=ffiJ.

It does not appear to have existed in the Stella Matutina. The Nisi version of the paper contains many mistakes and is also difficult to follow in places. In the �alistic Cross the fo rmula is written differently from the traditional Golden Dawn method. Instead of \"Ve Geburah\" and \"Ve Gedulah\" and \"le-Olam\" is written \"Ye Geburah\" and \"Ye Gedulah\" and \"Le Olahm\". While it might be a mistake it is a telling one. The �alistic Cross is the most repeated ritual in the Golden Dawn and one which Zelators should know by heart. Replacing Ve with Ye is inexcusable and means that the person did not understand what they were saying. This is a document that is supposed to have been copied and checked to make sure such mistakes did not appear. Some of the Nisi documents show signs that this checking took place but it seems that the process of checking a student's notebooks was somewhat slap dash under Berridge. The result would have been V.H. Frater Nisi saying Ye Geburah and Ye Gedulah. This version of the �alistic Cross says fo r the first line to be drawn from the fo rehead to the chest, in other words the heart. Modern Golden Dawn groups take that line down to the solar plexus and imagine the line continuing to the floor. One would expect that a Z.A.M. document would explain such visualisations, if any were required. Instead we have here a series of ritual"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"NICI(F.Al(,R.§LL 299 movements without magic or explanations. So far this document is exactly what one would expect from first knowledge paper of the Outer Order. The only thing different is that the Z.A.M. is allowed to use his Lotus Wand or Magic Sword. But no instructions are provided fo r using these magical weapons. There is an emphasis on Invoking Pentagrams rather than Banishing ones. Modern Golden Dawn orders have an obsession with banishing and hardly ever perform an invoking one. Yet all the early material suggests it was always the other way around and that both the Invoking and the Banishing provided protection. In this version of the ritual the idea that the ritual provides a Magic Circle, which must be completed, is stressed. You are creating a magic circle of protection similar to one which would have been chalked on the floor in Medieval magic. The invoking provides protection when you are calling something to you. A banishing was used in rituals where you wanted to repel something. The paper completes what is now known as the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram and then appears to go on to attempt to explain parts of the Supreme Ritual (or Ritual B). This is a Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram fo r Adepts and something not seen before. Some who have seen this paper think that these instructions are fragments of the Ritual B paper which somehow became merged with the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram paper. This is because it looks like a fragment of the standard Ritual B which contains the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram that was handed out at N.A.M./Z.A.M. in the Golden Dawn and Stella Matutina. This fragmentation of documents happens a lot within the Golden Dawn. Yeats' documents, fo r example, contain lots of fr agments of larger works. These were often mixed up in places. If the instructions are followed using this version, it would seem that Mathers is suggesting that as you draw your pentagram you should vibrate an additional divine name. This divine name is based on whether the elemental direction is active or passive. If it is Air or Fire you would use the Divine Name Elohim, if it is Water or Earth you would use the divine name El. If you have set up the tablets you are supposed to draw your pentagram using the three mystical names of the Tablet instead. This aspect of the paper could be better written so that it says: \"Then with the sword trace in the Air towards the East the invoking pentagram of fair size (rather"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"jOO MATHER.§' LAST SECR.§T less than ordinary person) while vibrating the divine name Elohim commencing at the top. Carry the wand to the centre of the 'k pronouncing the name: i11i1\" vibrating it as much as possible.\" If the ritual uses the tablets, then with the sword trace in the Air towards the East the invoking pentagram of fair size (rather less than ordinary person) while vibrating the divine name: OR!J !BAH .AOZJ:l commencing at the top. Carry the wand to the centre of the 'k pronouncing the name: i11i1\", etc. It also requires an additional invoking or banishing pentagram to be drawn over the tablet of spirit while vibrating the Names on the Tablet. This approach fo r the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram was not used by the Stella Matutina and may have been unique to the .Alpha et Omega. It is an interesting complication to the rite. One of the crucial things about the Supreme Ritual of the Pentagram and the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram is the orientation of the elements and their control under spirit. In the Outer Order the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram has nothing to do with elements. The@=@, who knows nothing of the elements, is just drawing an invoking or banishing symbol. However, in the Z.A.M. Grade the elemental nature of the pentagram is revealed, but the question then becomes one ofhow that element is controlled or powered by spirit. This is not a problem with the Supreme Ritual because Active and Passive Spirit Pentagrams are drawn before each elemental pentagram. In this Advanced Lesser Ritual you are drawing the fr ame of the pentagram with Elemental Power and then placing the divine name of the element within it. You are then hoping to create the missing spirit controls by drawing the active and passive spirit pentagrams in the centre. The advantage of this Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram is that it is quicker than the Supreme Pentacle but I am unsure ifit offers much. It does provide us with the link between the British Mystery Tradition, which includes Dion Fortune and Wicca. In these traditions you would draw an invoking earth pentagram at each of the quarters while invoking elemental fo rces and angels. The \"Magus\" would then go to the altar and open the Lodge to spirit (in the instances I have seen using the Golden Dawn's Opening of the Portal sign)."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"N!Cl(F.AJ?.... J\\?LL jOI The pronunciation of the Enochian Names is also unusual with an emphasis on the last letter by duplicating it. There is the optional idea of placing the Sigils of the various divine names in the centre of the pentagrams as you draw them. This paper shows that you do not always have to use the active and passive spirit pentagrams together (as you do when you are performing the initiations). Many people consider a normal method of using spirit pentagrams, I am not so sure it is so wise. By working the active and passive fo rms of spirit pentagrams together you are getting a balanced fo rm of energy. They are self polarising and activate the element evenly. If you do it the way Mathers describes, the spirit pentagrams look for polarity from the quarters opposite and are harder fo r the magician to balance. This is just my comment, as the method of drawing active spirit pentagrams fo r fire and air and passive pentagrams for water and earth is considered part of the Golden Dawn tradition."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"j02 MATHER§' LAST SECR.§T R.t,\"tual B The S'VPRJ:ME R.JT'VAL of the P�NTAGI(#M ��ai The pentagram is a powerful symbol representing the operation of the Eternal Spirit and of the fo ur Elements under the Divine Presidency of the letters of the name iT'iiDiT\".

The diagram was presented to the candidate during the @=[]] ritual, but was purged from the Bristol Temple before Regardie was a member. It is important when interpreting the Hexagram rituals. In his GOLDEN D.A WN RJTV.ALS .AND COMMENT.ARJES Pat Zalewski ties the diagram to the Alchemical Circulation Process where the Prima Materia is raised through Malkuth and through each of the Sephiroth until it reaches Kether and then it comes back down again returning to a liquid. Each point on the triad is a stage of Cohobation when the liquid is reunited with its residue. Officially the explanation of the diagram was that it showed the Trinity operating through the Sephiroth, and reflected downwards in the fo ur triangles of the Elements, through the Tree ofLife. The next important thing which has been added to the diagrams of the \"broken\" Hexagram ritual is that of the Sigil of the Sun. This was missing in the Regardie documents and is important when you look at the planetary versions of the Lesser Hexagrams. The placing of the sun symbol on the Hexagram makes the solar nature of the fo ur fo rms clear. It is clear that Mathers intended the planetary Sigils to be placed in the position of the sun in the Lesser Ritual of the Hexagram. This is something that has disappeared from the Golden Dawn tradition over the years. Perhaps the most surprising thing that is included in these papers is the fth form of the Hexagram. This is the Hexagram's equivalent of an inverted Pentagram. If you look at its structure it means something similar. The entire heavens are subverted and thrown down. As a fo rm it does not fit into the sequence of the others in that it does not have a direction assigned to it. Likewise Nisi did not attribute the planets to the angles. It is unclear if Mathers, or whoever introduced it, wanted people to use it. He has waved the symbol in front of you and said \"It is probably better fo r a Z.A.M. not to play with this\". He gives occasions fo r its use and these are benign.

The Bristol Temple was quite paranoid about anything that smacked ofBlack Magic. Bristol conducted an investigation of Dion Fortune's Inner Li'ght polarity rituals before her death. They frowned at what they thought was a wo man lying on the altar and the use ofblack candles. It was a ritual to Isis in her Binah aspect, but on the basis of what they saw, Bristol severed all links to Inner Li'ght. I would have thought that if Dion Fortune was really performing Black Magic the last thing she would do is invite the members of the Bristol Temple to the meeting.

With the names behind it, it was always assumed to be highly magical and the cutting edge of something from which all Western Magic sprang. The names of Mathers and Westcott are projected like Gods into that mythology and the people who took part are accorded the roles of Saints. The realit y is disappointing. The historical Golden Dawn, as fo rmed by Mathers, Westcott and Woodman was a shadow of its glorious mythology and rather than Magical Gods we find weedy heroes too weak to lift a sword. The Golden Dawn was an idea, or a seed, which dropped into the lap of two very clever, hermetically-minded men who tended to see Magic in the same way that they saw their Masonic lodge rites. They created a system based on the seed that they had been given. They looked upon their work and believed that by admitting women into a masonic lodge, or openly discussing magic, they were being radical. Certainly the Golden Dawn adapts itself extremely well to a Masonic approach to ritual and that co-masonic style operation was exactly what Mathers and Westcott seem to have wanted. But the Golden Dawn was more than that. The seeds once planted in the minds of \\Vestcott and Mathers started to shape them. Mathers also realised that there was more in his creation and created the magical Second Order. But their students of the Golden Dawn were also changing. Magicians are not Masons and by creating a magical Second Order, Mathers' Order had enough Magicians to cause trouble and too many Masons who knew what to do about it. Mathers was an autocratic eccentric. If this had not been the case, and he realised that teaching was walking and learning with"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"MATHER.§, LAST SECR,fiT students, and not acting like Moses to the Children of Israel, chances are the Order would not have split. But Mathers was still at heart a Mason in his approach and he could not surrender enough control to be a true magical leader. Unfortunately, he was too much of a magician to be an adequate Masonic-style leader either. The split in the order first removed the old guard of Westcott and Mathers into their own order called the .Alpha et Omega. What was left of the old Order split into two, one fo r Masons and the other fo r Magicians. What this book shows is that Mathers carried on with business as usual. Although it is not conclusive, it would appear that Berridge's temple even kept the Isis-Urania temple name. The man, who is supposed to be the magical brains of the Golden Dawn, should have come up with changes and papers that would knock the socks off what was being done by the rebels. But Mathers didn't. There was little new material created by Mathers' after the split and the higher grades were ignored. When analyzing the rituals I moved from states where I thought they were interesting, to fe elings of despair and betrayal. Like many people reading these rituals, I believed the myth that Mathers or Westcott were magicians of some stature. In front of me was proof that they were not. Instead we see a mostly quasi-Masonic status quo. Although the material in this book is different from what has been published, that is only relative to the Stella Matutina rituals of Regardie, rather than that of any inspired Mathers' Genius. What we see in Nisi are just tweaked, traditional, (and previously unpublished), versions of Golden Dawn rituals. The rituals were not performed in a magical way. Instructions throughout Nisi suggest that the Order was geared to do mass initiations, which is the hallmark of a non-magical group·. There are cuts to important parts of the ritual which magically render it useless. No magician would dare tamper with the structure to the extent that Mathers has allowed in the @=@. ·No one can initiate more than one person at a time using the Z documents because there is too much visualisation and concentration required. Symbolically the ritual is designed to do one person at a time. If you are told to do otherwise, your group is not doing magical ritual."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"N!Cl(F.Al(R..ftLL Yet somehow we are supposed to believe that it was this Order that created magicians like Dion Fortune, Aleister Crowley and seeded the entire British Western Mystery Tradition. By making the Founders of the Golden Dawn into gods we ignore those real magicians who were drawn to it like moths to a flame and added their ideas to the mix. The .A.O. developed until it became more magical thanks to John Brodie-Innes, Maiya Tranchell-Hayes and Mina Mathers. The Stella Matutina moved down similar lines thanks to the Felkins. In each of the stars of the Golden Dawn we can see additional studies and mentorship from those who understood the symbols behind it. Crowley would not have existed without Alan Bennett, nor Fortune without Maiya Tranchell-Hayes. These people went on to create their own orders and traditions, but were inspired by the Golden Dawn system. The Felkins, in particular Mrs. Felkin, looked fo r their magic within the Golden Dawn system and, by studying closely, fo und it. The publication of The Golden Dawn book by Regardie only started to make an impact long after most considered the Golden Dawn dead. Modern magicians who had grown up on books written by Crowley and Fortune had a different more modern view ofMagic. They had ideas which were compatible with the Golden Dawn ideas, but were never explicitly stated in the system. For example when I read the Th e Golden Dawn, the image in my head was one enhanced by teachings ofFortune, Butler and Paul Foster Case. Later I would be influenced by those who had been trained by the heavily magical New Zealand Golden Dawn. Then the ideas of David Goddard, Pat Zalewski, Dolores Ashcroft­Nowicki would be added in, until I finally joined Chic Cicero's Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. That brought more ideas, which changed again when I set up the Magical Order of the .Aurora Aurea. Each of those influences were like filters that changed my view of the Golden Dawn until it became what it is today. When I looked at Mathers and Westcott, I saw my own ideas reflected, rather than what these people really were. This is normal within Golden Dawn groups. However, these early .A.O. documents, with their masonic shortcuts, faulty reasoning and other holes in the system, show that this Golden Dawn order was not something I"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"M.A THE�, LAST SEC�T would have joined, or would have let me in ifl wanted. It was cut off from the magical approach I have sought. The Golden Dawn might be the root of Modern Magic, but as a spiritual tradition it too has grown. It is one of the beauties of a system that it can be opened up deeper when seen by modern eyes. That is not the magical genius ofWestcott and Mathers, but the symbols that are behind the Order. Those who fight over whether Westcott or Mathers was the real hero of the Golden Dawn have little to play with. The situation is similar to the cult film.z::dJ?..POZwhere a man who claims to be the magician who has led the hero to his destiny, shouts \"I bred and I led you\". The hero replies \"And I have looked into the face of the fo rce that put the idea in your mind. You are bred, and led, yoursel£\" That is not to say that Mathers and Westcott were not vital to the Golden Dawn story, but the real hero is still that mysterious Angel of the Golden Dawn Hl{.V which continues to add layer upon layer of spiritual meaning upon the Golden Dawn framework. It was not just Mathers or Westcott that created the Golden Dawn system, but the countless students who made the links between the various parts of the system and made it into something whole. The challenge of the modern Golden Dawn Orders is not to look to its history to provide \"Just Men\" and then make them perfect, but to put their own creativity into the ever growing Golden Dawn tradition and work on themselves. These .A. O. rituals answer another important question. They are confirmation that the Order was never perfect. It never contained the complete truth. Truth, which was there, has to be fo und by the magician. Using the terms of the ritual, they have to complete the Word with their Higher Self and part the veil. There are those who gather Golden Dawn documents in the hope that they will find in them the \"right way\" of doing things. These rituals show that, although there was a common thread, it appears that some ideas were added and dropped from the Golden Dawn tradition. Ways of doing pentagrams and hexagrams, grade signs evolved in accordance with what the Temple Chiefs thought at the time. This is normal, but gives headaches to those who look to the Golden Dawn fo r a replacement fo r their spumed religious fundamentalism."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"NICI(F.Al(R§LL When you read at the .A.O. papers in this book, or even the early Golden Dawn rituals, or Whare Re you are looking at a group that grew old and died. When I talked to the Whare Re adepts it was clear that, while they loved the Order, it had become too dated to survive the rigours of the modern age. When Whare Re closed in 1978 a letter from the Chiefs listed what had happened: ccThoJe of you who have been preJent at recent E'iuinox Ceremoni'eJ will Jurely have been aware� not only of the la ck of numbers� but also the lack of power, in the Temple. ThoJe who have read their annual reports can Jcarcely have failed to notice that no new memberJ have been admitted Jince 197f· Indeed there have been no grade ceremonies at all for the last two years or more . ... �� The leadership of Wh are Re throughout the 197os was to blame. Rather than adapting to the changing society and being aware of the esoteric trends, the last chiefs held on too rigorously to the letter of the tradition and let the soul within it die. Teachings that were considered too difficult were taken out of the grades where they belonged and placed in higher ones or dropped completely. When the Spirit of the Golden Dawn could not grow within that order, it simply left and attempted to find an expression elsewhere. While the Golden Dawn lineage died with the closure of Whare Ra, the Tradition is immortal and has evolved into something new. The message here is that those Golden Dawn groups who evoke the past too much, or lean on a made up \"tradition\" which often cannot be traced back fu rther than the 197os, or a typo in Israel Regardie, are doomed to repeat its mistakes. They are guilty of initiating people into a dusty corpse rather than the living Tradition. I have met people who believe it necessary to accept Westcott's history lecture as a literal truth and quote from the Black Book (the sixth edition of The Golden Dawn) as ifit were the Bible. Ultimately, they go nowhere because Golden Dawn magicians are required to think. They need to be studying the material and finding the truth of the system fo r themselves. Rather than re-enacting an Order that never was, it is important to create something that reflects the age and the magicians who live in it."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"MATHER§, LAST SECR.§T Mathers' .A.O. is no more and the material here is proof as to why it died, but that is not to say that its bones might not make a decent soup fo r a modern Golden Dawn Order (and no, I am not sure that is the best metaphor). There are a number of fields which need to be experimented with, even ifit is just checking out Mathers' versions of the Hexagrams. But I should sound a word of caution. There will be those who will use these rituals as an ultimate authority and claim these are the last word on the Golden Dawn and its rituals. But the A. O. rituals used by Berridge's Temple were really the second draft of a system which is still being written. Claiming Mathers was the last authority on the Golden Dawn is a bit like saying Paul ofTarsus was the last word on Christianity. It is never a good idea to accept the absolute authority of a half ­starved, unemployed Englishman, who visited Scotland once, but who wanders the streets of Paris in a kilt, speaking in a fake Scottish accent. It is unlikely that we would ever listen to a man who thinks the world will be put right by putting the Stuarts back on the Throne of Scotland! I think that Mathers' problem was that he stood between two phases of esoteric history. The first phase was where Esoteric training was conducted by men using a Masonic method of initiation where a symbol is allowed to develop in a Student over time. As the world got smaller, and other Mystery Traditions from throughout the world become known, humanity became better educated. This made this masonic approach as useless as a telegram in the Internet age. The second phase, which started after the Golden Dawn closed its doors, was the age of the true Magical Order. Mathers could not make that jump into a Magical Order, so the torch had to be carried by others. These pa pers show how Masonic his Order was and how he became out of touch from the magical theories that were developing. It is a warning to those who are setting up Magical Groups. You must always go with the Magic and always stay in touch with the world you live."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"NICJ(F.Al(R_?LL � Bibliography � Dion Fo rtune and the Inner Light, Gareth Knight, Thoth Publications, Loughborough, UK.

In these documents, the authors declare a method and society involved in the transformation of man into a compassionate, socially aware individual, committed to the service of the Brotherhood of Humanity, and the extension of the true gifts of Mankind. Compassion (R.C., \"rake\", Hebrew fo r \"tenderness\") is the true mark of a Rosicrucian and the motivation of our Work. In 1888, three high ranking Adepts of the Western Mystery Tradition fo rmed the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (H.O.G.D.). Around the turn of the century, a series of events culminated in the revolt of the Adepti of the H.O.G.D. and the consequent expulsion of MacGregor Mathers who at this time was the only remaining fo under. The remaining Adepti continued the Order as the Stella Matutina (with the support of one of the fo unders, William Wynn Westcott) and MacGregor Mathers went on to reformulate the Order as the R.p,sicrucian Order of the .Alpha et Omega . Much of this has been documented by R.A. Gilbert and Darcy Kuntz and we direct those interested in such to the published works of these gentlemen.
