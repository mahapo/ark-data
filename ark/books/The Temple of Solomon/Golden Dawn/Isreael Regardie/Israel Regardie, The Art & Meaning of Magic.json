RegardiePublished by Helios, 1969The Publication of This Book was made possible through the co−operation of:THE SANGREAL FOUNDATION INC.P.O. Box 2580Dallas, Texas, 75221Of all the subjects which comprise what nowadays is called Occultism, the most misunderstood ofall is Magic. Even Alchemy, which to some of us is annoyingly dark and obscure, evokes far moresympathy and understanding as a rule than does Magic. For example, the psychologist Jung hasobserved of alchemy in his essay The Ego and The Unconscious that \"it would be an unpardonabledepreciation of value if we were to accept the current view, and reduce the spiritual striving of thealchemists to the level of the retort and the smelting furnace. Certainly this aspect belonged to it; itrepresented the tentative beginnings of exact chemistry. But it also had a spiritual side which hasnever yet been given its true value, and which from the psychological standpoint must not beunderestimated.\" Yet Magic, strange to say, receives no such evaluation−−except insofar as the termMagic is allied to the unconscious, and is said to represent a primitive attempt to cognise theUnconscious. There is, hence, hardly more than the barest minimum attempt to arrive at anunderstanding of its processes. For the moment, I do not wish to analyse the possible reasons for thisamazing phenomenon. What is more to the point, however, is to provide some more or lessintelligible approach to the subject so that given an initial glimpse of the bright light flooding theworld of magic, more people may feel disposed to devote just a liltle of their energies and time to itsstudy. The advantages and benefits are such as to make this effort extremely worth while.Putting it simply and briefly, let me say at the outset that Magic concerns itself in the main with thatself−same world as does modern psychology. That is to say, it deals with that sphere of the psyche ofwhich normally we are not conscious but which exerts an enormous influence upon our lives. Magicis a series of psychological techniques so devised as to enable us to probe more deeply intoourselves. To what end? First, that we shall understand ourselves more completely. Apart from thefact that such self−knowledge in itself is desirable, an understanding of the inner nature releases usfrom unconscious compulsions and motivations and confers a mastery over life. Second, that we maythe more fully express that inner self in every−day activities. It is only when mankind as a whole hasreached, or perhaps when the more advanced men and women in the world have evolved, somedegree of inner realisation that we may ever hope for that ideal utopian condition of things−−a widetolerance, peace, and universal brotherhood. It is to ends such as these that Magic owes its raisond'etre.Approaching the matter from another point of view, it may be said that Magic deals with the sameproblems as Religion. It does not waste its or our valuable time with futile speculations with regardto the existence or nature of God. It affirms dogmatically that there is an omnipresent and eternal lifeprinciple−−and thereupon, in true scientific fashion, lays down a host of methods for proving it foroneself. How may we know God? Here, as before, there is a well−defined and elaborate techniquefor dealing with the human consciousness as such and exalting it to an immediate experience of theIsrael Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicTHE ART OF MAGIC1"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"universal spirit permeating and sustaining all things. I say advisedly that its technique iswell−defined. For the system has an abhorrence of the attitude of those good−natured butmuddle−headed thinkers who, refusing to accept their human limitations as they are now, aim toohigh without dealing with the manifold problems in the way.Let us assume that yonder building is ten storeys high. How may we reach the roof? Certainly not byignoring the very obvious fact that at least two hundred feet intervene between us and the roof! Yetthat is precisely the attitude of the so−called simplicity cult in mystical religion. God, they affirm, isan exalted state of infinite consciousness to which the microcosmic mind must be united. So far, sogood−−and here Magic is in accord with their view. Therefore, these people propose to attemptgaining the summit of attainment by ignoring the steps between man as we find him now and thesupreme end−− God. It is as though they wished to jump from the ground to the roof of the aforesaidbuilding.Magic adopts a slightly different attitude. It is one, however, which is markedly similar to thecommon−sense attitude of the mythical man in the street. To get to the top of the building we musteither climb the various flights of stairs leading there, or else take the lift upwards. In either case, it isa graduated process−−an evolution, if you wish.Man, holds the magical theory, is a more or less complicated creature whose several faculties offeeling, sensation, and thinking have slowly been evolved in the course of aeons of evolution. It isfatal to ignore these faculties, for evidently they were evolved for some useful purpose in answer tosome inner need. Hence, in aspiring towards divine union, surely a laudable goal, we must be quitesure that our method, whatever it is, takes into consideration those faculties and develops them to thestage where they too may participate in the experience. If evolution is held up as a suitable process,then the whole man must evolve, and not simply little bits or aspects of him, whilst other parts of hisnature are left undeveloped at a primitive or infantile level of being. Moreover, these faculties mustbe so trained as to be able to \"take\" the enormous tension sure to be imposed upon them by soexalted but nevertheless so powerful an attainment. Each faculty must be deliberately trained andcarried stage by stage through various levels of human and cosmic consciousness so that graduallythey become accustomed to the high potential of energy, ideation, and inspiration that mustinevitably accompany illumination and an extension of consciousness. Failure to consider such aviewpoint in terms of its dynamics undoubtedly must account for the catastrophies so frequentlyencountered in occult and mystical circles.To present a bird's−eye view of the entire field of Magic, let me summarily state that for conveniencethe subject may be divided into at least three major divisions. One−− Divination. Two −− Evocationand Vision. Three −− Invocation. I will define each separately and at some little length.With regard to the first division, the magical hypothesis is quite definite. It holds that divination isnot ultimately concerned with mere fortune−telling−−nor even with divining the spiritual causes inthe background of material events, though this latter is of no little unimportance. On the contrary,however, the practice of divination when conducted aright has as its objective the development of theinner psychic faculty of intuition. It is an enormous asset spiritually to have developed an exquisitesensitivity to the inner subtle world of the psyche. When carried on for a sufficiently long period oftime, the practice builds slowly but efficiently a species of bridge between the consciousness of manand that deeper hidden part of his psyche of which usually he is not aware−−the Unconscious, orhigher Self. In these deeper spiritual aspects of his nature are the divine roots of discrimination,spiritual discernment, and lofty wisdom. The object of divination is quite simply, then, theconstruction of a psychic mechanism whereby this source of inspiration and life may be madeIsrael Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicTHE ART OF MAGIC2"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"accessible to the ordinary consciousness, to the ego. That this mechanism is concerned at the outsetwith providing answers to apparently trivial questions is by itself no objection to the technique itself.The preliminary approaches to any study may seem unworthy to or incompatible with that study.And divination is no exception to the general trend. Nor is the objection valid that the technique isopen to frequent abuse by unscrupulous charlatans. But practised sincerely and intelligently andassiduously by the real student, consciousness gradually opens itself to a deeper level of awareness.\"The brain becomes porous to the recollections and dictates of the soul,\" to use a currenttheosophical expression, is a true statement of the actual results of the training. As the object ofanalytical psychology is the assimilation of the repressed content of the Unconscious to the ordinarywake−a−day consciousness, so by these other magical means the human mind becomes aware ofitself as infinitely vaster, deeper and wiser than ever it realised before. A sense of the spiritual aspectof things dawns upon the mind−−a sense of one's own innate high wisdom, and a recognition ofdivinity working through man and the universe. Surely such a viewpoint elevates divination abovethe level of a mere occult art to an intrinsic part of mystical endeavour.Geomancy, Tarot and Astrology, these are the fundamental techniques of the divinatory system.Geomancy is divination by means of earth. At one time, its practitioners actually used sand or blackearth in which to trace its sigils and symbols−−a typically primitive or mediaeval method. TodayGeomantic diviners use pencil and paper, relying upon graphite in their pencils to formulate,theoretically, a magical link between themselves and the so−called divining intelligences orelementals of Earth. It is, so far as my own experience goes, a highly efficient technique, and I canclairn at least an 80% degrce of accuracy over several years. Tarot is the name of a set of cards,seventy−eight in number, which were introduced into Europe in either the fourteenth or fifteenthcentury from . . . ? No−one knows where they came from. Their origin is a complete mystery. At oneperiod in Europe there were no such cards available, so far as we can see. At another time, the cardswere circulating freely. Little mention need be made of astrology, since that has long been one of themost popular methods with which the public has been made familiar. Anyone who practises thesemethods with this objective in mind will assuredly become aware of the results I have described.And while, it is true, his querents for divination may receive perfectly good answers to the questionsthey have asked, departing from his threshold in the spirit of gratitude and wonder, the intuitivedevelopment accruing to him will constitute the more important side of that transaction.It is when we leave the relatively simple realm of divination to approach the obscure subject ofEvocation that we enter deep waters. Here it is that most difficulty has arisen. And it is in connectionwith this phase of Magic that the greatest misunderstanding and fear even has developed.In order to elucidate the matter, let me again turn to the terminology of modern psychology. Theterm \"complex\" has achieved a fairly wide notoriety during the last quarter of a century since thecirculation of the theories of Freud and Jung. It means an aggregation or group of ideas in the mindwith a strong emotional charge, capable of influencing conscious thought and behaviour. If myinterest is Magic, then naturally every item of information acquired, no matter what its nature, islikely to be built by association into that constellation of ideas clustering around myinterest−−becoming in the course of years a thorough−going complex. Mrs. Jones my dairywoman,because of her professional predilection, will have her complex centering about milk and cows andbutter and the price of eggs.Over and above this definition, however, is the more subtle one of a group of ideas or feelingscongregating about a significant or dominant psychic theme, such as sex or the need to overcomeinferior feelings, or some psychic wound of childhood, tying or locking up nervous energy. Thus, asa result of repression, we may find a complex of which the possessor is totally unconscious−−aIsrael Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicTHE ART OF MAGIC3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"complex expressing itself in a sense of insecurity, obsession by morbid unreasonable fears, andpersistent anxiety. Moreover, a constellation of feelings and moods and emotional reactions mayexist which have become so powerful and yet so obnoxious to reason as to have become completelysplit off from the main stream of the personality. What modern psychology calls a complex in thissense, the ancient psychology of Magic, which had its own system of classification andnomenclature, named a Spirit. The system of classification was the Qabalistic Sephiros or the tenfundamental categories of thought.Thus, should we essay translation of terms, the sense of inferiority we might call the spirit ofTipharas, whose name is said to be Soras, inasmuch as the Sun, one of its attributions orassociations, is considered the planetary symbol of the individuality. Hence an affliction to thepersonality, which may be considered a general or rough definition of the inferiority sense, couldwell be referred to Soras−−since the spirit in the case of each Sephirah is considered evil. Thatcomplex expressing itself in insecurity is the spirit of Yesod and the Moon, whose name isChashmodai. This sphere of Yesod represents the astral design or foundation imparting stability andpermanence to physical shapes and forms, in a word it is a symbol of security and strength. Shouldwe be confronted with a case where the emotions were split off from consciousness−− this is theinfluence of the spirit of Hod and Mercury, Taphthartharath. One wallowing in emotional chaos,having refused to develop equally consciousness and the rational faculties, is subject to the spirit ofNetsach and Venus, Haniel. A purely destructive or suicidal neurosis which causes one to exhibit thesymptomatic tendency deliberately to break things, or to use them in attack against oneself, is of amartial quality, belonging to Gevurah and Mars, the spirit Samael.This, naturally, is the subjective point of view. That there is a purely objective occult theory I do notdeny, but that cannot be dealt with here.How, nowadays, do we deal with the psycho−neuroses in the attempt to cure them−−to eliminatethem from the sphere of the patient's thinking and feeling? Principally by the analytical method. Weencourage the patient to narrate freely his life−history, to delineate in detail his early experiences inconnection with his father and mother, his reactions to brothers and sisters, to school and playmatesand the entire environment. He is asked to dwell particularly on his emotional reaction to theseearlier experiences, to re−live them in his imagination, to recount and analyse his feelings towardsthem. Moreover, his dreams at the time of analysis are subjected to a careful scrutiny. This isnecessary because the dream is a spontaneous psychic activity uninterfered with by the wakingconsciousness. Such activity reveals present−day unconscious reactions to the stimuli oflife−−reactions which modify, even form his conscious outlook. In this way the patient is enabled torealise objectively the nature of this complex. He must detach himself from it for a short space oftime. And this critical objective examination of it, this understanding of its nature and the meanswhereby it came into being, enables him, not once and for all, but gradually and with the passage oftime, to oust it from his ways of thinking.Magic, however, at one time proceeded according to a slightly different technique. It too realisedhow devastating were these natural but perverse ways of thinking, and how crippling was the effectthey exercised on the personality. Indecision, vacillation, incapacitation of memory, anaesthesia offeeling and sense, compulsions and phobias, besides a host of physical and moral ills, are theresultants of these complexes or spirit−dominants. So completely is the patient at the mercy ofobsessing moods as almost to be beside himself, thus suggesting to the vivid imagination of theancients an actual obsession by some extraneous spirit entity. So, in order to restore man to hisformer efficiency, or to the standard of normality, these afflictions must be eliminated fromconsciousness.Israel Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicTHE ART OF MAGIC4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"As its first step, Magic proceeded to personalise them, to invest them with tangible shape and forrm,and to give them a definite name and quality. It is the nature of the psyche spontaneously to givehuman characteristics and nomenclature to the contents of its own mind. In doing this, the magicalsystem receives the official blessing, if I may say so, of no less a modern psychological authoritythan Dr. C. G. Jung. In his commentary to The Secret of the Golden Flower, Jung names thesecomplexes \"autonomous partial systems.\" Referring to these partial systems, he asserts: \"Being alsoconstituents of the psychic personality, they necessarily have the character of persons. Suchpartial−systems appear in mental diseases where there is no psychogenic splitting of the personality(double personality), and also, quite commonly, in mediumistic phenomena.\" It is, as I have said, anatural tendency of the human mind to personalise these complexes or groupings of special ideas. Asanother proof of this, we may cite the phenomenon of dreams, in which quite frequently the patient'spsychic difficulties or complexes are given symbolically some human or animal form.Proceeding a step further, the ancient science of Magic postulated that to eliminate this complex itwas necessary to render it objective to the patient's or student's consciousness so that he mightacquire some recognition of its presence. Whilst these subconscious knots of emotion, or astralspirits, are unknown and uncontrolled, the patient is unable to control them to the best advantage, toexamine them thoroughly, to accept the one or to reject the other. First of all, was the hypothesis,they must acquire tangible, objective form before they may be controlled. So long as they remainintangible and amorphous and unperceived by the ego, they cannot adequately be dealt with. By aprogramme of formal evocation, however, the spirits of the dark underworld, or complexes of ideasinhabiting the deeper strata of unconsciousness, may be evoked from the gloom into visibleappearance in the magical triangle of manifestation. Evoked in this technical way, they may becontrolled by means of the transcendental symbols and formal processes of Magic, being broughtwithin the dominion of the stimulated will and consciousness of the theurgist. In other words, theyare once more assimilated into consciousness. No longer are they independent spirits roaming in theastral world, or partial systems dwelling in the Unconscious, disrupting the individual's consciouslife. They are brought back once more into the personality, where they become useful citizens so tospeak, integral parts of the psyche, instead of outlaws and gangsters, grievous and dangerousenemies threatening psychic unity and integrity.How are these evoked? What is the technical process of rendering objective these autonomouspartial−systems? Magic parts company here with orthodox psychology. Many months of tediousanalysis at enormous financial outlay are required by the present−day psychological method to dealwith these problems, and few there be who are strong enough or patient enough to persist. Themagical theory prefers a drastic form of emotional and mental excitation by means of a ceremonialtechnique. During the Evocation ceremony, divine and spirit names are continuously vibrated as partof a lengthy conjuration. Circumambulations are performed from symbolic positions in thetemple−−these representing different strata of the unconscious, different regions of the psychicworld. Breath is inhaled into the lungs, and, rather like the pranayama technique of the Hindu Yogis,manipulated by the imagination in special ways. By means of these exercises, consciousness isstimulated to such a degree as to become opened, despite itself, to the enforced upwelling of thecontent of the Unconscious. The upwelling is not haphazard but is definitely controlled andregulated. For the Qabalists were thoroughly familiar with the ideas of suggestion and association,arranging their conjurations so that by means of association of ideas there would be suggested to thepsyche the train of ideas required−−and only that train. The particular partial−system is then exudedfrom the sphere of sensation and projected outwards. It embodies itself in so−called astral or ethericsubstance normally comprising the interior body which serves as the foundation or design of thephysical form, and acting as the bridge between the body and the mind, of which it is the vehicle.The astral form now reflecting the partial system projected from the Unconscious, attracts to itselfIsrael Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicTHE ART OF MAGIC5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"particles of heavy incense burned copiously during the ceremony. Gradually, in the course of theceremonial, a materialisation is built up which has the shape and character of an autonomous being.It can be spoken to and it can speak. Likewise it can be directed and controlled by the operator of theceremony. At the conclusion of the operation, it is absorbed deliberately and consciously back intothe operator by the usual formula. \"And now I say unto thee, depart from hence with the blessing of(the appropriate divine name governing that particular type of complex) upon thee. And let thereever be peace between me and thee. And be thou ever ready to come and obey my will, whether it beby a ceremony or but by a gesture.\"Thus the defect in consciousness caused by the spirit obsession is remedied and, because of theaccession to consciousness of the tremendous power and feeling involved in such a repression, thepsyche of the operator is stimulated in a special way, according to the nature of the spirit. Torecapitulate, the purpose of Evocation is that some portion of the human psyche which has becomedeficient in a more or less important quality is made intentionally to stand out, as it were. Givenbody and name by the power of the stimulated will and imagination and exuded astral substance, itis, to continue to use metaphor, specially nourished by the warmth and sustenance of the sun, andgiven water and food that it may grow and flourish.Familiarity, of course, is requisite before this type of Magic should be attempted. It requires studyand long training. Arduous and persistent toil needs to be undertaken with the appropriate formulaebefore one dare apply oneself to so formidable and perhaps dangerous an aspect of the magicalroutine. But it has this advantage over the analytical procedure. lt is infinitely speedier when once thetechnique has been mastered and the special association tracks have been familiarised, andconsiderably more thorough and effective as a cathartic agent. I hope one day to see a modificationof it in current use by our psychologists.There is an important variation of this technique. At first sight, it may seem to bear but littlerelationship with the Evocation method. But it too has as its objective the necessary assimilation ofthe unconscious content of the psyche into normal consciousness. Its object, also, is the enlarging ofthe horizon of the mind by enlarging the student's intellectual conceptions of the nature of theuniverse.The elementary technical processes of this method call for the drawing or the painting of colouredsymbols of the elements Earth, Air, Water, Fire and Ether. Each of these has a different traditionalsymbol and colour.To Earth is attributed a yellow square.Air is a blue circle. Israel Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicTHE ART OF MAGIC6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Water is a silver crescent. Fire, the red triangle, and Ether is the black egg. After staring intently at the symbol of some one particular element for several seconds, and thenthrowing the vision to some white or neutral surface, a reflex image of the complementary colour isseen against it. This is a normal optical illusion without having in itself any special significance. Theoptical reflex obtained, the student is counselled to close the eyes, imagining that before him is thesymbolic shape and complementary colour of the element being used. The shape is then to beenlarged until it seems tall enough for him to visualise himself walking through it. Then he mustpermit the fantasy faculty of the mind full and unimpeded play. What is particularly important is thatat this stage he must vibrate certain divine and archangelic names which tradition ascribes to thatparticular symbol. These names may be found in the first volume of my work The Golden Dawn.In this way, he enters imaginatively or clairvoyantly by means of a vision, into the elemental realmcorresponding to the nature of the symbol he has chosen. By employing element after element, heacquires a sympathetic contact with the understanding of the several hierarchical planes existingwithin Nature, and thus widens tremendously the sphere of his consciousness.From the psychological point of view, we might understand the magical theory to imply that theUnconscious (which has been compared to the nine−tenths of an ice−berg concealed under water andnot at all visible) may be classified into five principal layers or sub−divisions. These five levelscorrespond to the five elements, the most superficial being Earth, and the deepest being Ether orSpirit. By following such a vision or fantasy technique the candidate's ordinary consciousness isenabled to cross the otherwise impenetrable barrier subsisting between it and the unconscious. A linkis formed between the two aspects of mind, a bridge is constructed, across which the psyche maypass at any moment. Entering these various psychic levels by way of an imaginative projection isanalagous to forming an association track by means of which idea, inspiration, and vitality are madeavailable to consciousness.The vision thus obtained corresponds generally to a sort of dream, experienced however in a fullyconscious state−− one in which none of the faculties of consciousness, such as will, criticism andkeen perception are in any way in abeyance. The goal of analysis, from the synthetic andconstructive point of view, is accomplished readily by such means. A wide range of knowledge andfeeling is thereby opened up and assimilated without strain or difficulty to the advantage andspiritual development of the individual.Israel Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicTHE ART OF MAGIC7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Interpretation of the vision is an important factor. The neglect of interpretation may account for theintellectual sterility and spiritual emptiness so frequently observed in those who employ similarmethods. Acquaintance with the methods of Jung's symbolic analysis of dreams and spontaneousfantasies may be extremely useful here, providing a useful adjunct to the Qabalistic reference ofsymbols to the ten Sephiros of the Tree of Life. Before passing on, it is interesting to note that Junggives towards the end of his book Two Essays on Analytical Psychology an account of a patient'sspontaneous fantasy which is curiously similar to the tattwa technique I have just described. He callsit a \" 'vision' which by intense concentration was perceived on the background of consciousness, atechnique that is perfected only after long practice.\" It is so interesting that I am constrained to quoteit here: \"I climbed the mountain and came to a place where I saw seven red stones in front of me,seven on either side, and seven behind me. I stood in the middle of this quadrangle. The stones wereflat like steps. I tried to lift the four stones that were nearest to me. In doing so I discovered that thesestones were the pedestals of four statues of gods which were buried upside down in the earth. I dugthem up and so arranged them around me that I stood in the middle of them. Suddenly they leanedtowards one another so that their heads touched, forming something like a tent over me. I myself fellto the earth, and said, 'Fall upon me if you must, for I am tired.' Then I saw that beyond, encirclingthe four gods, a ring of flame had formed. After a time I arose from the ground and overthrew thestatues of the gods. Where they fell to the earth four trees began to grow. And now from the circle offire blue flames shot up which began to burn the foliage of the trees. Seeing this I said 'This muststop. I must go into the fire myself so that the leaves may not be burned.' Then I stepped into the fire.The trees disappeared and the ring of fire contracted to one immense blue flame that carried me upfrom the earth.\"Divination, Evocation and Vision are the preliminary techniques of Magic. We have observed thatthere is considerable justification for their employment−− when there is adequate understanding oftheir meaning and technical procedure. But these are preliminary methods only. They are but stepsleading to the consummation of the supreme sacrament. The inevitable end of Magic is identical tothat conceived of in Mysticism, union with God−head. Magic conceives of divinity as Spirit andLight and Love. It is an all−pervasive and omnipresent vital force, permeating all things, sustainingevery life from the most minute electron to the largest nebula of mindstaggering dimensions. It is thisLife which is the substratum of the entirety of existence, and it is this primal consciousness in whichwe live and move and have our being. In the course of manifestation, cosmic centres develop withinits infinitude, centres of lofty intelligence and power, whereby the cosmic high tension may bemodified and reduced to a lower key so as ultimately to produce an objective manifestation. Thesecosmic centres of life are what for the moment we may name the Gods (not spirits)−−beings ofenormous wisdom, power and spirituality in an ascending hierarchical scale between us and theunknown and unnamed God. The particular hierarchy that they form receives in Magic a clearclassification in terms of the Qabalistic Tree of Life.In an earlier paragraph I gave the metaphor of a man striving to reach the roof top of a severalstoreyed building. Now Magic conceives of spiritual development in an analogous way. That is tosay, it conceives a personal evolution as progressive and orderly. Divinity is the objective we seek toreach, the roof top. We, those of us cherishing the mystical ideal, are below on the ground. Not withone leap may we attain the summit. An intervening distance demands to be traversed. To reach theroof we must use either stairs or lift. By means of the magical technique we employ the invocation ofthe Gods, who answer metaphorically to the stairs or lift, and attempt union with their wider andvaster consciousness. Since they represent the several cosmic levels of energy and mind interveningbetween us and the supreme goal, as we unite ourselves in love and reverence and surrender to them,by so much the nearer do we approach to the ultimate source and root of all things.Israel Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicTHE ART OF MAGIC8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Using the plan of the Tree of Life as his guide, the magician invokes the lower Gods or Archangelsas they are named in another system, desirous of mingling his own life with, and surrendering hisown being to, the greater and more extensive life of the God. Thus his spiritual perceptions becomefiner and more sensitive, and his consciousness becomes with time accustomed to the high tension ofthe divine force flowing through him. His interior evolution proceeding, he invokes the God of theSephirah or plane immediately above. Following the same procedure, he attempts to assimilate hisown essence, his own integrated consciousness, to that of the divinity he has invoked. And soon−−until finally he stands upon the lofty Darien peak of spiritual realisation, united with thetranscendental life of infinity, feeling with universal love and compassion, conscious of all life andevery thing as himself with supreme vision and power. As Iamblichus, the Neoplatonic theurgist,once expressed it: \"If the essence and perfection of all good are comprehended in the gods, and thefirst and ancient power of them is with us priests (i.e. theurgists or magicians) and if by those whosimilarly adhere to more excellent natures and genuinely obtain a union with them, the beginningand end of all good is earnestly pursued; if this be the case, here the contemplation of truth, and thepossession of intellectual science are to be found. And a knowledge of the Gods is accompanied with. . . the knowledge of ourselves.\"So much for theory. How does the art of invocation proceed? Most important of all is theimaginative faculty. This must be trained to visualise symbols and images with the utmost clarity,ease, and precision. The necessity for this springs from the fact that certain God−forms are to bevisualised. Most popular in magical techniques are the Egyptian God−forms. There seems to be acertain quality of specific definiteness about forms such as Osiris, Isis, Horus and Nuit, for example,which renders them peculiarly effective for this kind of training. In another system, where theArchangels are synonymous with the divine Gods, forms are visualised based upon an analysis of theindividual letters comprising of God−name. That is to say, should we employ the Jewish Qabalisticsystem, each Hebrew letter has attributed to it a colour, astrological symbol, divinatory meaning inTarot and Geomancy, and element. When building up the so−called Telesmatic image of theArchangel in the imagination, we take each letter as representing some particular part or limb of theForm, and some particular shape, feature, or colour. Thus from the letters of its name, a highlysignificant and eloquent form is ideally constructed.Seated or Iying in a perfectly relaxed physical state, one in which no muscular or nervous tensioncan send a disturbing message to the brain, the student endeavours to imagine that a particularGod−form or Telesmatic Image surrounds him or coincides with his physical shape. Sometimes but afew minutes suffice to produce a conscious realisation of the presence, though more often than not agood hour's work at the least is required to procure worthwhile results. As concentration andreflection become more intense and profund, the body becomes vitalised by streams of dynamicenergy and power. The mind, too, is invaded by Light, great intensity of feeling, and inspiration.The name of the God or Archangel is meanwhile frequently vibrated. This vibration serves two ends.One, to keep the mind well concentrated on the ideal form by means of repetition. Two, the vibrationawakens in the depths of the microcosmic consciousness that magical faculty which is akin orcorresponds to its macrocosmic power. Rhythmic breathing likewise is undertaken so as totranquilise mind and body, and to open the subtler parts of the inner nature of the omni−presentall−permeating life. Visualisations of the letters of the Name moreover are practised. According totraditional rules, the letters are manipulated by the mind as moving within the forms, or occupyingcertain important positions on plexuses or major nerve centres. The totality of these methodsconspire to exalt the consciousness of the operator, to lift up his mind by no devious or uncertainroute to a nobler interior plane where is a perception of the meaning and transcendental nature andbeing of the God.Israel Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicTHE ART OF MAGIC9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Over and above all these methods, or, more accurately, combining these techniques, is a final phaseof Magic which I propose only to touch upon in brief−−Initiation. The necessity and rationale of thisprocess depends upon the postulated ability of a trained initiate to impart something of his ownillumination and spiritual power to a candidate by means of a ceremony. Such a magnetictransmission of power is conceived to stir up the inner faculties of the candidate−−faculties dormantand obscured for many a sorry year. As Psellus, another Neoplatonist once remarked of Magic, \"Itsfunction is to initiate or perfect the human soul by the power of materials here on earth, for thesupreme faculty of the soul cannot by its own guidance aspire to the sublimest intuitions, and to thecomprehension of Divinity.\"Since the divine principles of man are obscured and latent within him, so that consciousness, of itselfand by itself is unable to climb to the distant heights of spiritual intimacy with universal life, Magicin the hands of a trained and experienced Magus is the means whereby that eclipse of the inner lightmay be overcome. By means of several initiations, the seeds of awakening are sown within the soul.Later they are fanned and stimulated into an active living flame lighting the brain, illuminating thesoul, and providing the necessary guidance to accomplish the purpose of incarnation.The number of ceremonies and their detailed implication must differ, naturally, with differentsystems, though in general meaning all are in complete accord. In one system of initiation which isof especial significance to me personally, the major initiation ceremonies are seven in number. Thefirst of these is a ceremony of preparation, consecration and purification, bringing to the dull gaze ofthe neophyte some vague intimation of the Light to which he aspires and which seems lost in the dimdarkness afar. The seed of the Light is sown deeply within him by way of suggestions embodied inritual speeches so that, time and devotion to the work acting as incubating agents, it may grow andblossom into the full−grown tree of illumination and divine union. The next five ceremonies areconcerned with developing what are termed the elemental bases of the soul. Consciousness, placedunder the surveillance of the Light, requires to be strengthened in its elemental aspects. So that whenthe Light ultimately does indwell the soul of man, the elemental self may be strong enough and pureenough to support the soul so that it may safely bear the full brunt of the divine glory. At first, thismay not appear perhaps an urgent necessity. But if one remembers the pathologies of mysticism, thewell−meaning but scatterbrained and unpractical people of this world who have been totally unfittedfor the conquest of life by a mild species of psycho−spiritual experience, then the magical routineobtains some degree of justification. It is in vain that the wine of the gods is poured into old crackedvessels. We must make certain that the vessels are intact and strong, capable of retaining and notspilling the wine poured from above.The five elemental ceremonies having been experienced, and the seeds of the divine Earth, Air,Water, Fire and Ether sown within the human soul, the candidate is ready for the final initiation ofthis particular series. The central point of this initiation is the invocation of what commonly is calledthe higher Self, or the Holy Guardian Angel. This is the central core of the individuality, the root ofthe Unconscious. Before union with the Infinite may be envisaged, it is necessary that everyprinciple in the human constitution be united so that man becomes one united consciousness, and nota disconnected series of separate discrete consciousnesses. The intelligence of the physical cellscomprising the body, the principle of the emotions and feelings, the sphere of the mind itself, thesemust be united and bound together by a conscious realisation of the true nature of the Self employingthem, the higher Genius. Integrity produced through the agency of the telestic or initiatory rites, thenthe whole human being, the entire man may set forth upon that lengthy but incomparable bright roadwhich leads to the end, and to the beginning also, of life. Then, and only then, is man able to realisethe meaning of life, and the purpose of his multitudinous incarnations on earth.

With these latter he is now capable of dealing and, moreover, of completely mastering them, sothat no longer do they enslave him. By no ties either of attachment or disgust is he bound to theduties of this earth−−ties which must necessitate his further and continued incarnation until he hassuccessfully severed them.Freedom obtained through the acquisition of integrity in its truest and divinest sense, then the nextmagical step in evolution is possible of recognition and achievement−−the conscious return of manto the divine Light from which he came.Israel Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicTHE ART OF MAGIC11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MAGIC IN EAST AND WESTby Israel RegardieWhen I was about seventeen years of age, a friend loaned me a copy of Major L. A. Waddell'sLamaism. In those days it impressed me tremendously, no doubt because of its massive size. In everysense it was a heavy tome, and tomes then suggested depth and weight of scholarship and insight.Naturally I knew nothing at that time about Magic, and beyond a few theosophical allusions next tonothing of Buddhism. So the greater part of the significance and wide erudition of the book musthave passed me by completely, though it is a veritable storehouse of knowledge.Then, out of the blue it appeared on my horizon again, again through the agency of a friend. In thelight of the little knowledge and experience gained through the passage of several years, its contentsexcited me enormously−−and it was with the utmost interest that I reconsidered it. For me, one of thethings that stood out most emphatically this time was the extraordinary similarity between−−even thefundamental unity of−−the highest and most basic magical conceptions of both East and West.Whether this is due, as many exponents of the Eastern wisdom would claim, to the direct importationof occult philosophy and practice from the Orient to Western civilization, it is not my intention nowto argue. Nonetheless, it is my considered belief that in Occidental countries there has definitely beena secret tradition on a practical level−−a tradition which for centuries has orally transmitted the finerpart of this magical knowledge. In fact, so jealously reserved at all times was this tradition that bymost people it was hardly suspected at all. Very few were the fortunate individuals who in any agewere drawn as though by invisible currents of spiritual affinity to the concealed portals of itstemples.Occasionally a small portion of this closely concealed tradition wormed its way outwards into books.Some of these latter are those which were written by Iamblichus and the later Neoplatonists, and alsoby students such as Cornelius Agrippa, Pietro d'Abano, and Eliphas Levi, etc. Its cruder elementsfound expression in the far−famed Clavicles, Grimoires and Goetias. Yet for the most part the truesequence of teaching, and the vast implications of its practical knowledge were, as above stated,maintained in strict privacy. The reason for this secrecy may have been the feeling that there are onlya small number in any age, in any country, amongst any people, who are likely to appreciate orunderstand the deeper or sublimer aspects of Theurgy, the higher magic. It requires sympathy, muchinsight and a capacity for hard work, which needless to say few people possess. And there is,consequently, but little point scattering broadcast these pearls of bright wisdom which can only bemisunderstood.Indubitably this conclusion is corroborated by Waddell's Lamaism. In point of fact, a good deal ofso−called esoteric magical knowledge is there contained−−though it is presented wholly withoutcomprehension. Hence his statement of that particular aspect of Lamaism is vitiated and renderedpractically worthless. And while I may agree with Waddell that some of the Lamaistic practices havelittle to do with historical Buddhism, his sneers as regards an esoteric Buddhism on the magical sideof things are simply laughable, for his own book is a clear demonstration of precisely that one factwhich he has perceived not at all.His book, obviously, was intended primarily to be an objective account of the Buddhism indigenousto Tibet and as practised by its monks and hermits. Unfortunately, the prejudices andmisunderstandings of the author are scarcely concealed. So that while indubitably he did pick upsome of the crumbs dropped haphazard from the esoteric table of the Lamas, and recorded themIsrael Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicMAGIC IN EAST AND WEST12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"probably as he found them, nevertheless he had not the necessary training, knowledge or insight intothe subject possessed undoubtedly by some of the higher initiated Lamas with whom he hadconversed. The result was that he was unable to make anything of that information. In fact, hisaccount of their practices sounds simply silly and absurd. Psychologically, he succeeds not inthrowing ridicule on the Lamas but only upon himself.Certain aspects of Theurgy or Western Magic have now been comparatively clearly set forth. Someearly reviewers and critics were of the opinion that my former work The Tree of Life was as plain anelementary statement of its major traditional principles as had yet publicly been made. And DionFortune's book The Mystical Qabalah, a frank masterpiece, is likewise an incomparably finerendition of the mystical philosophy that underlies the practice of Magic. I therefore suggest that byemploying the theorems laid down in those two books, and applying them to the material inWaddell's Lamaism, we may arrive at an understanding of some otherwise obscure portions ofTibetan Magic.It may be well, at first, to confess that a good part of the magical routine refers to a psychic plane, tocertain levels of the Collective Unconscious, though by no means does that wholly condemn it ascertain mystical schools feel inclined to do. Other branches concern such phenomenalaccomplishments as rain−making, obtaining good crops, scaring away demons, and similar featswith which both Eastern and Occidental legend have familiarised us. Feats, moreover, which requirea good deal of explaining away by the rationalist and mechanistic scientist. Finally, there is thatunhappily large part which verges on witchcraft pure and simple. With this latter, I am at no timeconcerned. But I maintain, as a primal definition, that Magic whether of the Eastern or Westernvariety, is essentially a divine process−−Theurgy, a mode of spiritual culture or development. Fromthe psychological viewpoint, it may be interpreted as a series of techniques having as their object thewithdrawal of energy from objective and subjective objects so that, in the renewal of consciousnessby a re−emergent libido, the jewel of a transformed life with new creative possibilities and withspontaneity may be found. It comprises various technical methods, some simple in nature, othershighly complex and most difficult to perform, for purifying the personality, and into that cleansedorganism freed of pathogenic strain invoking the higher Self. With this in mind, then, a good manyof the apparently unrelated items of Magic, some of its invocations and visualising practices, take ona new and added significance. They are important psychological steps whereby to repair, improve orelevate consciousness so that eventually it may prove a worthy vehicle of the Divine Light. Asentence or two written many years ago by William Quan Judge in his pamphlet An Epitome ofTheosophy express so exactly the impression to be conveyed that it is convenient to quote: \"The realobject to be kept in view is to so open up or make porous the lower nature that the spiritual naturemay shine through it and become the guide and ruler. It is only 'cultivated' in the sense of having avehicle prepared for its use, into which is may descend.\"This conception is likewise the point of view of our magical system. The technical forms of Magicdescribed in The Golden Dawn, such as Pentagram and other rituals, astral assumption ofGod−forms, evocations (though not necessarily to physical manifestation) of elemental and planetaryspirits, skrying in the spirit−vision, and the invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel, are all performedwith that single objective held ever before one. Theurgy and the exponents of the Eastern mysticismsare thus in complete accord on the fundamental theoretical principles.To illustrate now what I mean by the complete misunderstanding which a purely objective account ofmagical practices is capable of achieving, it will be found interesting to consider but a fewstatements made by Waddell. First of all, let me quote from page 152 (2nd edition) of his work: \"Thepurest Gelugpa Lama on awaking every morning, and before venturing outside his room, fortifiesIsrael Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicMAGIC IN EAST AND WEST13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"himself against assault by the demons by first of all assuming the spiritual guise of his fearfultutelary . . . Thus when the Lama emerges from his room . . . he presents spiritually the appearanceof the demon−king, and the smaller malignant demons, being deluded into the belief that the Lama isindeed their own vindictive king, they flee from his presence, leaving the Lama unharmed.\"Surely this is a puerile interpretation. Though the fact itself of the assumption of the spiritual formsof tutelary deities is perfectly correct, the rationale he provides is infantile and stupid. So far asWestern Theurgy is concerned, centuries of effort have shown that one of the most potent adjuncts tospiritual experience, as aiding the assimilation of the lower self into the all−inclusive psyche, is theastral assumption of the magical form of a divine Force or a God. By means of an exaltation of themind and soul to its presence, whilst giving utterance to an invocation, it is conceded that there maybe a descent of the Light into the heart of the devotee, accompanied pari passu by an ascent of themind towards the ineffable splendour of the spirit.So far as the reason for and explanation of this process is concerned, it may be well to state brieflythat according to the magical hypothesis, the whole cosmos is permeated and vitalised by Oneomnipresent Life, which in itself is both immanent as well as transcendent. At the dawn of themanifestation of the universe from the thrice unknown darkness, there issue forth the Lives−−greatgods and spiritual forces, Cosmocratores, who become the intelligent architects and builders of themanifold parts of the universe. From their own individual spiritual essence, other lesser hierarchiesare begotten, and these in turn emanate or evolve from themselves still other groups. These are theywhich represent in the hidden depths of the psyche those primordial ideas which Jung speaks of asarchetypal images ever present in the Collective Unconscious of the race. Thus it is that through theunion of the human consciousness with the being of the gods in an ascending scale that the soul ofman may gradually approach the final root and source of his being. In the Buddhist scheme this is\"the essence of mind which is intrinsically pure,\" the Dharmakaya, the unconditioned divine body oftruth. The intent to frighten malignant demons has no inclusion within the scope of this technique.Whether the later hypothesis is original with Major Waddell or not is difficult to surmise, though thethesis is common to all primitive peoples. Probably it was made by a Lama in a lighter vein to put anend to leading questions, though at the same time it is true that in moments of psychic danger, theassumption of a Godform is of enormous assistance. Not because the threatening elemental ordemon. for example, is fooled or frightened by the form, But because the operator, in openinghimself to one phase of the divine spirit by the assumption of its symbolic form, does take uponhimself or is empowered with the authority and dominion of that God.It was in Egypt, so far as the western form of magic is concerned, that these cosmic forces receivedclose attention and their qualities and attributes observed and recorded. Thus arose theconventionalised pictographs of their Gods which are profound in significance, while simple in themoving eloquence of their description. It is the Egyptian God−forms that are used in occidentalmagic, not those of Tibet or India. The technical use of these God−forms consists in the applicationof the powers of will and imagination−−as well as of sound and colour. A very profound paragraphmay be found in The Mahatma Letters, where K. H. wrote to A. P. Sinnett: \"How could you makeyourself understood−−command in fact those semi−intelligent forces, whose means ofcommunicating with us are not through spoken words but through sounds and colours, in correlationsbetween the vibrations of the two. For sound, light and colour are the main factors in forming thesegrades of intelligence . . .\"Though it is hardly politic to enter more deeply into this matter, the remarks of K. H. apply equallyto other forces and powers than elemental. The astral form of colour and light assumed in theimagination creates a mould or a focus of a special kind into which, by technical modes of vibrationIsrael Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicMAGIC IN EAST AND WEST14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"and invocation, the force or spiritual power desired incarnates. By the clothing of one's own astralform with the ideal figure of the God, now vitalised by the descent of the invoked force, it is heldthat man may be assumed or exalted into the very bosom of Godhead, and so gradually return, withthe acquisition of his own humanity, to that unnameable mysterious Root wherefrom originally hecame.Another instance of Waddell's lack of humour and insight occurs on page 322. In describing thetraining of the novice, it is said that the Lama adopts a \"deep hoarse voice, acquired by training inorder to convey the idea that it emanates from maturity and wisdom.\" It is not known to me whetherany of my readers have witnessed any kind of a magical ceremony, or heard an invocation recited bya skilled practitioner−−though I should say few have. The tone always adopted is one which willyield the maximum of vibration. For many students a deep intoning, or a humming, is the one whichvibrates the most. Therefore that is the ideal tone whereby to awaken from within the subtle magicalforces required. It will have been noted too that the best invocations are always sonorous andintensely vibrant. The idea that the voice should suggest maturity and wisdom is merely silly. This isanother instance of Western contempt rather than a sympathetic attempt really to understand aforeign system. The Tibetan specimens of ritual given by Waddell contain an amusing number ofOms, Hums, Has, and Phats, but then Western conjurations contain equally amusing barbarousnames of evocation. Yah, Agla, etc.With this question of sound in magical conjurations I have dealt at some length elsewhere. Suffice toremark here that in The Secret Doctrine Madame Blavatsky suggests that the vibratory use ofconjurations and sound generally have a profound significance. \"Sound and rhythm,\" she observes,\"are closely related to the four elements . . . Such or another vibration in the air is sure to awakencorresponding powers, union with which produces good or bad results, as the case may be.\" Thewhole subject of sound, and the employment of so−called barbarous names of evocation, requiresthoroughly to be studied before one dare suggest an explanation accusing either Magi or Lamasmerely of a pose of wisdom.One notes with aroused attention too that the Tibetans have a form of what is called here in theOccident the Qabalistic Cross. On page 423 of his book, there is the following description: \"Beforecommencing any devotional exercise, the higher Lamas perform or go through a manoeuvre bearinga close resemblance to 'crossing oneself' as practised by Christians. The Lama gently touches hisforehead either with the finger or with the bell, uttering the mystic Om, then he touches the top of hischest, uttering Ah, then the epigastrium (pit of stomach) uttering Hum. And some Lamas addSva−ha, while others complete the cross by touching the left shoulder, uttering Dam and then Yam.It is alleged that the object of these manipulations is to concentrate the parts of the Sattva, namely thebody, speech, and mind upon the image or divinity which he is about to commune with.\"Israel Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicMAGIC IN EAST AND WEST15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" Prior to commenting upon the above, it is imperative to indicate certainfundamental theories to be found in some books of the Qabalah. If thereader is familiar with Dr. Wm. W. Westcott's splendid Introduction tothe Study of the Kaballah or with Dion Fortune's more recent book TheMystical Qabalah he will have seen there a diagram attributing the TenSephiroth to the figure of a man. Above the head, forming a crown, isKeser which represents the divine spirit, and at the feet is Malkus, whileto the right and left shoulders are attributed Gevurah and Gedulah, Marsand Jupiter, Power and Majesty. In Qabalistic pneumatology, Keser is acorrespondence of the Monad, the dynamic and essential self−hood of aman, the spirit which seeks experience through incarnation here onearth. That this Sephirah or potency is placed above the head ratherthan, say, within the brain or in the centre of the heart, is highlysignificant. It is the light of the Spirit which shines always into thedarkness below. (\"The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord.\" Andagain, \"When his candle shined upon my head and by his light I walkedthrough darkness.\") This is an idea which has its parallels in other systems too. For example, in TheEpitome of Theosophy we find Judge writing: \"It is held that the real man, who is the higher self,being the spark of the Divine, overshadows the visible being, which has the possibility of becomingunited to that spark. Thus it is said that the higher Spirit is not in the man, but above him.\"All mystical and magical procedure has as its object so to purify the lower self that this higher Selfwhich normally only overshadows us and is seldom in full incarnation, may descend into a purifiedand consecrated vehicle. The theurgic tradition asserts that, by the proper performance of theQabalistic Cross amongst other things this end may be accomplished. As a devotional exercise ormeditation, it is used in collaboration with the formulation of certain lineal figures, the vibration ofnames of power, and followed by the invocation of the four great archangels. Its western form is asfollows:1. Touch the forehead, and say Atoh (Thou art)2. Touch the breast, say Malkus (the Kingdom)3. Touch the right shoulder, say ve−Gevurah (and the Power)4. Touch the left shoulder, say ve−Gedulah (and the Glory)5. Clasping the hands over the heart, say le−Olahm. Amen (for ever, Amen.)6. Here follow suitable Pentagrams made facing the cardinal quarters, and the vibration of names ofpower.7. Extend the arms in the form of a cross, saying:8. Before me Raphael, Behind me Gabriel.9. on my right hand Michael, on my left hand Auriel.10. For before me flames the Pentagram.Israel Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicMAGIC IN EAST AND WEST16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"11. And behind me shines the six−rayed Star.12. Repeat 1−5, the Qabalistic Cross.So far as this little ritual is concerned, one may describe its action as under several heads. It firstinvokes the power of the higher Self as a constant source of surveillance and guidance. It places thesubsequent procedures under the divine aegis. Having then banished by the tracing of the appropriatepentagrams all non−essential beings from the four cardinal points with the aid of the fourfour−lettered names of God, it then calls the four Archangels−−the four concretized functions of theinterior psychic world, and the dual pair of opposites−−to protect the sphere of magical operation,that is the circle of the Self. In closing, it once again invokes the higher Self, so that from thebeginning to the end, the entire ceremony is under the guardianship of the spirit. The first section,comprising points one to five, identifies the higher Self of the operator with the highest aspects of theSephirotic universe. In fact, it affirms the soul's essential identity with the collective consciousnessof the whole of mankind.If one attempted a further analysis, the Hebrew Word Atoh, meaning \"Thou\", would refer to thedivine white brilliance, the higher Self overshadowing each man. By drawing down the Light to thepit of the stomach−−which symbolically represents the feet, since to bend down to the feet wouldmake an awkward gesture−−the vertical shaft of a cross of Light is established in the imagination.The horizontal shaft is affirmed by touching both the shoulders, and vibrating words which state thatthe qualities of the higher self include both power and majesty, severity and loving−kindness.Equilibrium is the especial characteristic of the cross as a particular symbol, and the tracing of theQabalistic Cross within the aura affirms the descent of the spirit and its equilibrium withinconsciousness or within the magical sphere. This meaning is further emphasised by the gesture ofclasping the hands over the Tipharas centre, the heart place of harmony and balance, and sayingle−Olahm, Amen, forever.The Sanskrit word Sattva implies purity and rhythm and harmony, and of the three Gunas or qualitiesrefers to Spirit. Similarly in the Western equivalent of this schema, Alchemy, the three qualities arecorrespondences of the three major Alchemical principles, Salt, Sulphur and Mercury. Of these theUniversal Mercury is an attribution of Keser−−that holy angel who is the divine guardian andWatcher, overshadowing the soul of man, ever awaiting an ordered approach so that its vehicle maybe lifted up to its own glory. There is here, then, a very great resemblance between the Tibetandevotional exercise and that which is enjoined as one of the most important practices of theQabalistic Magic of the Occidental tradition.In that section of the book where Waddell describes the Lamaistic celebration of the Eucharist,another important parallelism is to be found. It describes how the priest or lama who conducts theceremony is obliged to have purified himself during the greater part of the preceding twenty fourhours by ceremonial bathing, and by having uplifted his mind through continual repetition of mantrasor invocations. The actual description of the inner or magical aspect of the ritual, while notparticularly well stated, is given for what it is worth: \"Everything being ready and the congregationassembled, the priest, ceremonially pure by the ascetic rites above noted, and dressed in robe andmantle, abstracts from the great image of the Buddha Amitayus part of the divine essence of thatdeity, by placing the vajra of his rdor jehi t'ag upon the nectar vase which the image of Amitayusholds in his lamp, and applying the other end to his own bosom, over his heart. Thus, through thestring, as by a telegraph wire passes the divine spirit, and the Lama must mentally conceive that hisheart is in actual union with that of the god Amitayus and that, for the time being, he is himself thatgod.\"Israel Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicMAGIC IN EAST AND WEST17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"After this meditation, the rice−offerings and the fluid in a special vase are consecrated by very\"fierce\" invocations and cymbal music. Then the consecrated food and water is partaken of by theassembly.From the theurgic viewpoint the rationale of the Eucharist is quite simple. There may be innumerabletypes of Eucharist, all having different ends in view. A substance is chosen having a special affinityaccording to the doctrine of sympathies for a particular kind of spiritual force or god andceremonially consecrated. Thus a wheaten wafer is of the substance of the Corn−goddess, attributedeither to the powers of Venus, or to the element of Earth, presided over by Ceres or Persephone.Penetrative oils would be specially referred to the element of Fire, the tutelary deity of which isHorus. Olives would be sacred to the force represented by the astrological sign Aquarius, the elementAir, and the goddess Hathor. And wine is referred to Dionysius and the solar gods generally, Osiris,Ra, etc. By an elaborate table of correspondences it is possible to select any substance to be thephysical basis for the manifestation of a spiritual idea. The consecration, ceremonially, of thematerial basis by means of an invocation of the divine force accomplishes what is vulgarly called themiracle of transubstantiation. To use more preferable magical terminology, the substance istransformed from a dead inert body into a living organism, a talisman in short. The consecrationcharges it and gives it a soul, as it were.At this juncture, I must register my emphatic disagreement with those writers on science and Magicwho impressed unduly or in the wrong way by modern psychology, explain the effect of a talismanas due entirely to suggestion. This is sheer nonsense. And I can only assume that whoever makes thissort of argument is without the least experience of this type of magical work. It is this kind ofexperience which comprises or should comprise the first part of one's early practical work in thetechnical side of Magic. And lack of experience in even this elementary aspect of technical virtuosityvitiates every opinion on other forms.We are confronted here by the same problem that arose over a century ago in another sphere. Theearly great magnetisers after Mesmer−−great names like de Puysegur, Deleuze, du Potet andLafontaine−−claimed that by means of will and imagination they were able to open themselves to aninflux from without and then to transmit from their own organisms a species of vital power or animalmagnetism. This force pervading all space they claimed could be used therapeutically. Later on,when attempting to appropriate the trance phenomena and healing methods inaugurated by themesmerists, physicians of the orthodox school eliminated the theory of an actual transmissible forceand in its stead employed the theory of suggestion. Beginning with Braid and continuing through aline of very fine investigators, a duplication of magnetic phenomena was achieved purely bypsychological means without recourse to any hypothesis of animal magnetism.But because phenomena can be produced by one method does not necessarily imply that itsduplication by another is false. It may well be that similar feats can be accomplished by quiteseparate techniques based upon differing hypotheses−−each valid in its own sphere and each capableof explaining one set of facts. In any event, the reality of animal magnetism, or the transmission ofwhat in the East has been termed prana, vitality, has never been disproved.On the contrary, it is a simple matter to prove it quite adequately. Let any normal healthy personsuspend his fingers over the arm of a second person, imagining and willing that his prana coursesout from his fingers in long filmy streamers of energy. If the second person sits quite still andcultivates an objectivity of feeling and waiting. he will soon sense either a cold draught on that armor a tingling in his own finger tips which proceeds from the influx of prana. This is an experiencequite apart from suggestion, for it may be attempted with those who have no idea of the fundamentalIsrael Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicMAGIC IN EAST AND WEST18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"principles involved and who, therefore, are not directly susceptible to suggestion on this score.Spontaneously, and without prompting, they will observe the fact that a tangible transmission ofvitality has been effected. It should be possible to test it by some very delicate instrument. Moreover,in a dark room. these streamers issuing from the fingers can be readily seen if the hand is held infront of a black cloth.Furthermore, one's ability to generate this power is capable of culture. I have elaborated this themefrom the point of view of autotherapy in The Art of True Healing. And it is also my suggestion thatthe interested reader consult Dr. Bernard Hollander's work Hypnotism and Self−Hypnotism wherethe problems of suggestion and animal magnetism are discussed at some length in connection withexperimental work−−and that most intelligently.Briefly, let me say that suggestion does not invalidate in the least the fact of animal magnetism, northe effect of a charged talisman. For, as I have intimated, we are confronted by the same problemthat years earlier had arisen as to whether the trance and therapeutic phenomena of mesmerism wereindeed due to suggestion or to a surcharge of vitality. If power can be passed to an individual as Icontend it can, why not to some specific substance which is particularly appropriate in its nature toreceiving a charge? Tradition has always asserted that metals, gems and precious stones, vellum andparchment make good material bases for talismans. If the vitality of the operator be augmented bysimple meditation exercises such as have been described in The Art of True Healing, or by thestraightforward magical methods of invocation and visualization of God−forms, then a verypowerful charge is imparted to the material basis of the talisman.Of itself, however, the talisman is nothing. It only becomes efficacious when properly consecratedand vitalised. Thus the Eucharistic substance is worthless as such until it has been duly consecratedby an appropriate magical ceremony, and transmuted into the vehicle of an appropriate type of force.The mode of consecration is of course, another matter, not to be described here inasmuch as it is alengthy and technical business. One of the important parts of such a ceremony for the consecration ofa talisman or a Eucharistic substance, is the assumption of the God−form astrally. When the operatorhas determined the nature of the divine force he is desirious to invoke, and having selected thematerial substance congruous in nature to that force, he must endeavour during his ceremony ofconsecration so to exalt the spirit within him that he actually becomes identified, in one way oranother, with the consciousness of that particular force or deity. The more thorough and complete isthis dynamic union, the more automatic and simple does the mere subsequent charging of thetelesmata become. In the case of the Eucharist the idea, however, is not only spiritual identificationwith the deity as a preliminary to the ascent to the unknown universal God, but the alchemicaltransmutation of the lower vehicles into a glorified body. While the higher consciousness of theMagus may certainly be dissolved in ecstasy, it becomes imperative to create a magical link betweenthat divine consciousness and his physical body and emotions. Therefore, the ceremonialmagnetising of a material substance, be it a wafer or wine or herb, impregnates it with that samedivine force. Its consumption assumes that transmuting force into the very being and fibre of theMagus, to carry out the work of transformation. As the pseudonymous Therion once wrote: \"Themagician becomes filled with God, fed upon God, intoxicated with God. Little by little his body willbecome purified by the internal lustration of God; day by day his mortal frame, shedding its earthlyelements, will become in very truth the Temple of the Holy Ghost. Day by day matter is replaced bySpirit, the human by the divine, ultimately the change will be complete; God manifest in flesh will behis name.\"It requires some little magical experience fully to appreciate this, but this simplified explanation willI think throw more light on the actual nature of the ceremony than does the description of Waddell.Israel Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicMAGIC IN EAST AND WEST19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"I do not wish to discuss in more than a few words the validity of a Eucharistic ceremony celebratedother than by the operator himself. Bearing in mind that a properly performed Eucharistic ceremonyresults in the production of a talisman, it becomes clear that this kind of operation is principally ofbenefit to him who performs it. It seems to my way of thinking a useless rite to partake of theEucharist en bloc. The Buddha is supposed to have remarked that no ceremonies are of the least availin obtaining salvation or redemption. To me, it seems not that he attacked the magical tradition inthese words, but rather wholesale ceremonies in which the audience plays no active part at all. Thereis no willed stimulation of their own spiritual principles−−it is a passive vicarious participation in thelabours of other people. Magic, with Buddhism, agrees with Madame Blavatsky's dictum that \"thepivotal doctrine of the Esoteric philosophy admits no privileges or special gifts in man save thosewon by his own ego through personal effort and merit . . .\"There is one final topic I should like to refer to at some length before leaving this comparative study.In so doing it is necessary to leave Waddell for the moment to refer to the writings of two otherTibetan scholars, Madame Alexandra David Neel and Dr. W. Y. Evans Wentz. Both of thesescholars have written with sympathy and understanding on Tibetan religion and magical practices.The subject to be considered is a Tibetan mystery play in relation to Western magical ritual.\"Chod\" is a kind of mystery drama, and the magician or yogi is the sole actor therein. Dr. EvansWentz, in his masterly introduction to the translation of the play or ritual in Tibetan Yoga and SecretDoctrines explains that \"The Chod\" Rite is, first of all, a mystic drama, performed by a single humanactor, assisted by numerous spiritual beings, visualised, or imagined, as being present in response tohis magic invocation. Its stage setting is in some wild awe−inspiring locality, often in the midst ofthe snowy fastnesses of the Tibetan Himalayas, twelve to fifteen or more thousand feet abovesea−level. Commonly by preference it is in a place where corpses are chopped to bits and given tothe wolves and vultures. In the lower altitudes of Bhutan and Sikkim, a densely wooded junglesolitude may be chosen; but in countries wherein corpses are cremated, such as Nepal and India, acremation ground is favoured. Cemeteries or localities believed to be haunted by malignant anddemoniacal spirits are always suitable.\"Long probationary periods of careful preparation under a master of Chod are required before thenovice is deemed fit or is allowed to perform the psychically dangerous rite . . . At the outset, thecelebrant of the Chod Rite is directed to visualise himself as being the Goddess of the All−Fulfilling(or All−Performing) Wisdom by whose occult will he is mystically empowered; and then, as hesounds the thigh−bone trumpet, invoking the gurus and the different orders of spiritual beings, hebegins the ritual dance, with mind and energy entirely devoted to the one supreme end of realising,as the Mahayana teaches, that Nirvana and the Sangsara are, in reality, an inseparable unity.\"Stanzas three to seven inclusive suggest the profound symbolism underlying the ritual; and thissymbolism, as will be seen, is dependent upon the Five Directions, the corresponding Five\"Continents\" of the lamaic cosmography with their geometrical shapes, the Five Passions (hatred,pride, lust, jealousy, stupidity) which the yogin triumphantly treads under foot in the form ofdemons, and the Five Wisdoms, the antidotes to the Five Passions . . . In the ninth stanza comes thedramatic spearing of the elements of Self with the spears of the Five Orders of Dakinis. As theMystery proceeds, and the yogin prepares for the mystic sacrifice of his own fleshly form, there isrevealed the real significance of the Chod or 'cutting of'.\"Thus the Chod as explained by Evans Wentz is seen as a highly intricate magical ceremony in whichthe lama, identifying himself with a Goddess through the visualised assumption of her astral or idealform, invokes what we in the West would call angels, spirits and elementals to attend upon hisIsrael Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicMAGIC IN EAST AND WEST20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"ceremony. These he deliberately invites to enter his own sphere. No longer does he act, as in otherspecialized forms of invocation, by selecting one particular force only and attempting forcibly tokeep all others out from his sphere of consciousness. Now he makes a vacuum as it were; he openshimself completely, and wholly receptive permits whatever influences will to permeate him throughand through, and partake of his nature. In one sense, he sacrifices his being to them. His mind, hisemotions and feelings, and the organs and limbs of his physical body, and the minute cells and livescomposing them, are all handed over to the invaders for consumption, if so they wish. \"For ages, inthe course of renewed births I have borrowed from countless living beings−−at the cost of theirwelfare and life−−food, clothing, all kinds of services to sustain my body, to keep it joyful incomfort and to defend it against death. Today, I pay my debt, offering for destruction this bodywhich I have held so dear. I give my flesh to the hungry, my blood to the thirsty, my skin to clothethose who are naked, my bones as fuel to those who suffer from cold. I give my happiness to theunhappy ones. I give my breath to bring back the dying to life.\"It is briefly, a very idealised form of personal sacrifice in which the whole individuality is opened up,hypothetically, to whatever desires to possess it. As a magical operation it must rank very high intechnical virtuosity, and for him who is sufficiently endowed with the magical gifts to perform it amost effectual ritual so far as results are concerned.The final stage of the drama is ably described by Mme. David Neel in this passage: \"Now he mustimagine that he has become a heap of charred human bones that emerges from a lake of blackmud−−the mud of misery, of moral defilement, and of harmful deeds to which he has co−operatedduring the course of numberless lives, whose origin is lost in the night of time. He must realise thatthe very idea of sacrifice is but an illusion, an offshoot of blind, groundless pride. In fact, he hasnothing to give away, because he is nothing. These useless bones, symbolising the destruction of hisphantom \"I,\" may sink into the muddy lake, it will not matter. That silent renunciation of the asceticwho realizes that he holds nothing that he can renounce, and who utterly relinquishes the elationspringing from the idea of sacrifice, closes the rite.\"In attempting a comparison between this Chod Rite and European magical rituals, we are at theoutset confronted not by the problem of inferiority of conception or technical skill, as many haveheretofore thought, but by a vast difference of metaphysical outlook. That is to say, there is amarkedly enunciated opposition both of philosophic and pragmatic aim. In common with all schoolsand sects of Buddhism, the Mahayana is directly antagonistic to the ego idea. The whole of itsphilosophy and ethical code is directly concerned with the elimination of the \"I\" thinking. It holdsthat this is purely a fantasy bred of childish ignorance, very much as the mediaeval notion that thesun circumambulated the earth was the result of imperfect knowledge. Therefore the whole of itsreligious and philosophic scheme is directed towards uprooting this fantasy from the thinking of itsdisciples. This is the Anatta doctrine, and its importance to Buddhism is grounded in the belief thatfrom this fantasy spring all sorrow and unhappiness.European Magic, on the other hand, owes its fundamental doctrines to the Qabalah. Whilst havingmuch in common with the broad outlines of Buddhism, the metaphysics of the Qabalah areessentially egocentric in a typically European way. Nevertheless, the terms of its philosophy are sogeneral that they may be interpreted freely from a variety of angles. Whilst decrying the ills andlimitations that accompany the false ego sense, it emphasises not so much the destruction of the egoas, with true Western practicality, its purification and integration. It is a very useful instrument whenit has been taught the needful lesson that it is not identical with the Self, but only one particularinstrument, one small phase of activity comprised within the larger sphere of the total individual.Hence, the practical theurgy that arises as a superstructure from the basic theoretical Qabalah mustIsrael Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicMAGIC IN EAST AND WEST21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"also be affected by such a viewpoint. Instead of seeking to remove the ego as such, it seeks to extendthe limited borders of its horizon, to enlarge its scope of activity, to improve its vision and itsspiritual capacity. In a word so to enhance its psychological worth that in taking cognisance of theuniversal Self permeating all things, it may become identified with that Self. Here, then, is afundamental distinction in the point of view envisaged.Just as the \"Chod\" has its roots in the primitive Bon animism of pre−Buddhistic Tibet, having beenvery clearly re−shaped by the Mahayanists, so the Western Ritual I propose to consider here also hasa very crude origin. It dates possibly to the centuries immediately preceding our own Christian era.\"The Bornless Ritual\", which is the name it has come to be known by, may be found in itselementary form in Fragments of a Graeco−Egyptian Work upon Magic, published in 1852 for theCambridge Antiquarian Society by Charles Wycliffe Goodwin, M.A. The ritual has since undergoneconsiderable transformation. From a simple primitive prayer to ward off evil, in the hands of skillfultheurgists trained in the Western tradition of the Golden Dawn, it has been evolved into a highlycomplex but most effectual and inspiring work. The Ritual, as such, now consists of a lengthyproem, five elemental invocations, and an eloquent peroration. Sandwiched between them is aEucharistic ceremony.In the prologue, the operator identifies himself with Osiris by means of the visualised assumption ofthe Egyptian God−form. That is to say, he formulates about him the form of Osiris. His imaginationmust be pictorially keen and vivid enough to visualise even the smallest details of dress andornamentation in clear and bright colour and form. As a result of this effort, if he is successful, nolonger is the ceremony conducted by a mere human being. On the contrary, the invocations andcommands issue forth from the very mouth of God−head. Osiris in magical symbolism is humanconsciousness itself, when finally it has been purified, exalted, and integrated−− the human ego as itstands in a balanced position between heaven and earth, reconciling and uniting both. In a GoldenDawn initiation ritual, one officer, whilst assuming the astral mask of the God, defines its nature byaffirming: \"I am Osiris, the Soul in twin aspect, united to the higher by purification, perfected bysuffering, glorified through trial. I have come where the great Gods are, through the Power of theMighty Name.\"The lama, when performing the Chod Rite, likewise imagines himself to be one of the dakinis, TheGoddess of the All−Fulfilling Wisdom. She, so runs the interpretation of Madame Alexandra DavidNeel, represents esoterically the higher will of the lama. The concepts of both rituals actually arevery similar.But here the resemblance, superficial indeed, ends. For in the Chod ritual the lama or hermit,invoking the various orders of demons and spirits, identifies them with his own vices and sosacrifices himself. He sees his ego comprised of hatred or wrath, pride, lust, jealousy and stupidity,and throws these qualities to the invading spirits and demons for consumption. He visualises hisbody as a corpse being dismembered by the wrathful goddess, and its organs also being preyed uponby a host of malignant entities. In a few words, a species of dissociation is intentionally induced.Now in the Western system, the various orders of elementals are also invoked from their stationsduring this Bornless Ritual. But they are commanded to flow through the Magus with a view, not topreying upon him and thus destroying him, but to purify him. The intent is totally different. At eachstation or cardinal quarter, the appropriate tutelary deity is invoked by means of the formulation ofthe astral form and the proper lineal figures. In the East, as a result of the vibration of the appropriatebarbarous names of evocation that \"have a power ineffable in the sacred rites\", and by enunciatingthe Words of Power, the Sylphs rush through his sphere of sensation like a gentle zephyr blowing theIsrael Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicMAGIC IN EAST AND WEST22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"foul dust of pride before them. The Salamanders, raging from the South, consume with a burning firethe jealousy and hatred within him. Lust and passion become purified by the Undines invoked fromthe West, as though the Magus were immersed in purest water from which he issues spotless andconsecrated. Whilst the Gnomes, coming from the North, cleanse him from sloth and stupidity,exactly as muddy and impure water is cleansed by being filtered through sand. The operator, all thewhile, is conscious of the injunction a propos the elementals given in one of his initiations. Or rather,the injunction has become a part of his unconscious outlook upon life. \"Be thou, therefore, promptand active as the Sylphs, but avoid frivolity and caprice. Be energetic and strong as the Salamandersbut avoid irritability and ferocity. Be flexible and attentive to images like the Undines, but avoididleness and changeability. Be laborious and patient like the Gnomes, but avoid grossness andavarice. So shalt thou gradually develop the powers of thy soul, and fit thyself to command thespirits of the elements.\"The elemental invocations over−−very difficult work, to do which requires at least seventy or eightyminutes of intense magical concentration−−the operator, being convinced of the presence of theinvoked force and the salutary effect of their respective purifications upon him, begins the secondstage of his work by invoking the fifth element, the alchemical quintessence, Akasa or the Ether, inboth its negative and positive aspects. The effect of these two invocations is to equilibriate theelementals already commanded to the scene of operations. Also, it tends to provide an etheric mouldor astral vacuum into which the higher spiritual forces may descend to make contact with theUnconscious psyche of the operator.At this juncture it is customary to celebrate the mystic repast which again seems the reverse inintention of the Chod banquet. At least, the reversal is only apparent. The Magus celebrates theEucharist of the four elements, after reciting powerfully the Enochian invocation of the mysticalTablet of Union beginning 01 Sonuf vaorsagi goho lada balta−−\"I reign over you, saith the God ofJustice . . .\" The perfume of the rose on the altar, the low fire of the lighted lamp, the bread and salt,and the wine are thus powerfully charged with the divine force. So that as he partakes of theelements, the influx of the spirit elevates not only his own ego but all the innumerable cells and liveswhich comprise his own lower vehicles of manifestation. And more too, for it affects all the spiritualbeings, angels, elementals, and spirits who, in answer to invocation, now pervade his astral sphere.Thus he accomplishes that which the tenets of all mystical religion enjoin, the elevation of all theinferior lives as man himself evolves. This he does, in this case, by the agency of the magicalinvocations and the Eucharist, so that not only does he himself become blessed by the impact of thedivine spirit, but so do all the other beings present partake with him of the glory. There is nowith−holding of blessing. For here, as in the Chod Rite, there is no retention of power from anybeing.At the opening of the ceremony, all forces and all beings whatsoever are carefully banished by theappropriate banishing rituals so as to leave a clean and holy space for the celebration of theceremony. But into this consecrated sphere all the orders of elementals, comprised within thefive−fold division of things, are called. And it is this mighty host who, having purified the sphere ofthe magus by having consumed the undesirable elements within him, are consecrated and blessed bythe Eucharist and the descent of the refulgent Light. The whole operation is sealed by the peroration:\"I am He! The Bornless Spirit, having sight in the feet!Strong and the Immortal Fire! I am He the Truth! I am He who hate that evil should be wrought inthe world! I am He that lighteneth and thundereth! I am He from whom is the shower of the life ofearth! I am He whose mouth ever flameth! I am He, the Begetter and Manifester unto the Light! I amIsrael Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicMAGIC IN EAST AND WEST23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"He, the Grace of the World! 'The Hearth girt with a Serpent' is my Name.\"It coincides with the re−formulation of the god−form of Osiris. And with each clause of the finalhymn, the magician makes the effort in imagination to realise that they answer to the divine qualitiesand characteristics of the God, whose Light is even now descending upon him. The end result isillumination and ecstasy, a transporting of the consciousness of the magus to an identity with theconsciousness of all that lives, an ineffable union with the Light, the One Life that permeates allspace and time.It will be conceded I hope that the Western conceptions of Magic are in no way inferior, as so manyunfortunately have come in the past several years to believe, to those prevalent in Tibet and the East.It is only that the philosophic forms are somewhat different. And this difference has its root invarying psychological needs−−and these at no time are irreconcilable.Here then I must content myself with these comparisons between various points of magical interestcommon to both East and West. My desire to compare them sprang originally from a perusal ofMajor Waddell's really erudite book−−where the reader may find other items of great and absorbinginterest. But I do feel that unless he has the magical key to these practices and various ceremonieswhich the Lamas perform, he is apt to be bored and left without a proper understanding of them.With all due respect to the Eastern wisdom for which assuredly I have a great and profoundreverence, it is my belief that in this instance a study of Theurgy as developed by Western genius ismore capable than aught else of throwing an illuminating ray on the true nature of spiritualdevelopment by means of the path of Magic. There are many paths to the one goal of the BeatificVision. Of these paths, meditation is one. Probably in its development of meditation and the purelyintrospective processes of Yoga, the East is far in advance of the West. Certainly there is no bettertext−book on that subject than the Patanjali Yoga Aphorisms, And I appreciate the fact thatBlavatsky brought Theosophy from the East. But Theurgy has climbed to sun−illuminated heights inthe Western Schools. Our hidden sanctuaries of initiation, where Magic has long been successfullyemployed, but all too rigidly suppressed from the notice of the outer world, have a finer, nobler andmore spiritual interpretation than any to be found in Eastern systems.For myself, I can only say that experience demonstrates that Theurgy makes no confusion in itsstatement of ideals. It introduces no superstitious chaos concerning the fear of demons, etc., which isonly too apparent in the Tibetan scheme, judging from Waddell's book. Every magical effort of theLamas is described as being due to fear or hatred of evil spirits, though I do not doubt but that manylamas have a finer understanding of their system than this. Theurgy nurtures the ideal that itstechnique is a means of furthering one's spiritual development so that thereby one may consummatethe true objects of incarnation. Not selfishly, but that one may be the better able thereafter to helpand participate in the ordered progress of mankind to that perfect day when the glory of this worldpasses, and the Sun of Wisdom shall have arisen to shine over the splendid sea.Israel Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicMAGIC IN EAST AND WEST24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE MEANING OF MAGICby Israel RegardieWe live today in a world of great material progress and mechanical ingenuity. On every hand isflouted the social advantages of the world−wide communication bequeathed to us by such moderninventions as aviation, radio and space−craft. Time seems to disappear in the face of such things, andspace dwindles almost to nothing. The peoples of the earth are drawn far closer together than everthey have been before in recorded history. By way of paradox, however, simultaneously with thisunique advance in scientific progress, a large proportion of mankind is supremely miserable. Itsuffers the pangs of dire starvation because scientific methods have yielded an over−production offoods and manufactured articles without having solved the problem of distribution. Yet modernscience has become invested with a nature which originally was not its own. Despite the chaos ofinternational affairs, and the fear of another catastrophic war present in the minds of most people, ithas become robed in a mighty grandeur, almost of divinity. Perhaps it is because of this feeling ofinsecurity and fear that this condition has come about, for the human psyche is a cowardly thing atcore. We cannot bear to be honest with ourselves, accepting the idea that whilst we are human we arebound to feel insecurity, anxiety and inferiority. Instead, we project these fears outwards upon life,and invest science or any body of knowledge with vast potential of affect so as to bolster up ourdwindling fund of courage. So science has become, thanks to our projected affect, an authority thathardly dares to be questioned. We cannot bear that it should be questioned for we must feel that inthis subject at least is authority, unshakeable knowledge and the security we so dearly crave. Thephenomenon is hardly dissimilar to that of a few centuries ago when religion, formal religion of thechurches, was the recipient of this obeissance and respect. For many people, science has nowbecome their intellectual keynote, by whose measuring rod−−despite their own personal neurosesand moral defects−−all things soever are ruled, accepted or rejected.Pursuits no matter of what nature which temporarily are not popularly favored, even though in themlies the hope for the spiritiual advancement of the world, or subjects which do not possess thesanction of those who are the leading lights in the scientific world, are apt thus to receive as their lotneglect and gross misunderstanding. When many folk are introduced to Magic, for instance, the firstreaction is either one of stark fear and horror−−or else we are greeted by a smile of the utmostcondescension. This is followed by the retort intended to be devastating that Magic is synonymouswith superstition, that long ago were its tenets exploded, and that moreover it is unscientific. This, Ibelieve, is the experience of the majority of people whose prime interest is Magic or what nowpasses as Occultism. It seems that just as their hope for security and their desire for unshakeableknowledge becomes projected upon science, so their inner fears and unfaced terrors are projectedupon this maltreated body of traditional knowledge, Magic. Disconcerting this reaction can mostcertainly be, unless criticism and the call for definitions immediately is resorted to. By these meansalone may we who champion Magic obtain a begrudged hearing.Science is a word meaning knowledge. Hence any body of knowledge, regardless of itscharacter−−whether ancient, mediaeval, or modern−−is a science. Technically, however, the word isreserved primarily to imply that kind of knowledge reduced to systematic order. This order isencompassed by means of accurate observation experimentally carried out over a period of time, theclassification of the behaviour of natural phenomena alone, and the deduction of general laws toexplain and to account for that behaviour. If this be the case, then Magic must likewise claiminclusion within the scope of the same term. For the content of Magic has been observed, recordedand described in no uncertain terms over a great period of time. And though its phenomena are otherIsrael Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicTHE MEANING OF MAGIC25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"than physical, being almost exclusively psychological in their effect, they are of course natural.General laws, too, have been evolved to account for and explain its phenomena.A definition of Magic presents a rather more difficult task. A short definition which will reallyexplain its nature and describe the field of its operation seems practically impossible. One dictionarydefines it as \"the art of applying natural causes to produce surprising effects.\" Havelock Ellis hasventured the suggestion that a magical act is a name which may well be given to cover everyconceivable act in the whole of life's span. It is Aleister Crowley's suggestion that \"Magic is thescience and art of causing changes to occur in conformity with will.\" Dion Fortune slightly modifiedthis by adding a couple of words−− \"changes in consciousness.\" The anonymous mediaeval author ofThe Goetia, or Lesser Key of King Solomon has written a proem to that book where occurs thepassage that \"Magic is the highest, most absolute, and most divine knowledge of Natural philosophy. . . True agents being aplied to proper patients strange and admirable effects will thereby beproduced. Whence magicians are profound and diligent searchers into Nature.\"Have these definitions taught us anything of a precise nature about the subject? Personally I doubt itvery much; all are too general in their scope to tend towards edification. Let us therefore ceaseseeking definitions and consider first of all certain aspects or fundamental principles of the subject,Afterwards, perhaps, we may have sufficient trust worthy and evidential material at our disposal toformulate anew a definition which may convey something intelligible and precise to our minds.Within the significance of the one term Magic are comprehended several quite independenttechniques, as I shall mention on a later page, in another essay. It may be advantageous to examinesome of these techniques. Before doing so, however, it might be well to consider a part of theunderlying theory. I know many will say by way of criticism of this discussion, that it is nothing butprimitive psychology−−and only the psychology of auto−suggestion at that. There will be a decidedsneer, barely concealed.However, this objection does not completely dispose of the subject by any means. A very great dealmore remains to be said. Not that I would deny that in Magic the process of self−suggestion isabsent. Most certainly it is present. But what I must emphasise here is the fact that it is present in ahighly evolved and elaborate form. It almost makes the technical approach of some of our modernexperimenters look puerile and undeveloped. We are not to suppose for one moment that theinnovators and developers of the magical processes in days gone by were naive or fools, unaware ofhuman psychology and the structure of the mind itself. Nor that they refrained from facing many ofthe psychic problems with which we nowadays have had to deal. Many of the early magicians werewise and skilled men, artists and sages, well−versed in the ways and means of influencing andaffecting people.We know that they understood a good deal about hypnotism and the Induction of hypnoidal states. Itis highly probable that they speculated, as have done innumerable modern psychologists, upontechnical methods of inducing hypnoidal states without the aid and help of a second person. But theysoon became aware of all the obstacles and barriers that beset their path. And these were many. Ibelieve that in Magic they devised a highly efficient technical procedure for overcoming thesedifficulties.When Coue some years ago burst upon our startled horizon with his spectacular formula of \"day byday in every way I am getting better and better\" many believed that here at last we were presentedwith the ideal method of getting down to brass tacks, of finally being able to impinge upon theUnconscious mind, so called. Hundreds of thousands of people surely must have gone to bed atIsrael Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicTHE MEANING OF MAGIC26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"night, determined to induce a relaxation that was as nearly perfect as they could obtain, andattempted to enter the land of slumber while muttering sleepily the magical formula over and overagain. Others listened to music in dimly lighted rooms until they experienced some sense ofexaltation and then mumbled the healing phrase until they felt that surely some favourable resultmust occur.Assuredly some lucky people got results. They were, however, few and far between. Some of thesedid overcome certain physical handicaps of illness, nervousness, so−called defects in speech andother mannerisms, and thus were able to better themselves and their positions in the world of reality.Others were less fortunate−−and these were by far the greater number, the great majority.What was the difficulty that prevented these people, this large majority, from applying the magicalformula until success was theirs? Why were they not able to penetrate that veil stretched between thevarious levels of their minds.Before we answer these questions−−and I believe that Magic does really answer them−−let usanalyze the situation a little more closely.The unconscious in these systems of so called practical psychology, metaphysics, andauto−suggestion, is considered a slumbering giant. These systems hold that it is a veritablestorehouse of power and energy. It controls every function of the body every moment of every day,nor does it sleep or tire. The heart beats seventytwo times per minute, and every three or fourseconds our lungs will breathe in oxygen and exhale carbonic acid and other waste products. Theintricate and complex process of digestion and assimilation of food which becomes part and parcel ofour very being, the circulation of blood, the growth, development and multiplication of cells, theorganic resistance to infection−−all these processes are conceived of as immediately under thecontrol of this portion of our minds of which we are not normally aware−−the Unconscious.This is only one theoretical approach to the Unconscious. There are other definitions of its nature andfunction which altogether preclude the practical possibility of resorting to suggestion orauto−suggestion for coping with our ills. For example, there is the definition provided by Jung withwhich in many ways I am in sympathy, and it might be worlh our while to quote it at some length.He wrote in Modern Man in Search of a Soul that \"man's unconscious likewise contains all thepatterns of life and behaviour inherited from his ancestors, so that every human child, prior toconsciousness, is possessed of a potential system of adapting psychic functioning . . . Whileconsciousness is intensive and concentrated, it is transient and is directed upon the immediate presentand the immediate field of attention; moreover, it has access only to material that represents oneindivdual's experience stretching over a few decades.... But matters stand very differently with theunconscious. It is not concentrated and intensive, but shades off into obscurity, it is highly extensiveand can juxtapose the most heterogeneous elements in the most paradoxical way. More than this, itcontains, besides an indeterminable number of subliminal percepions, an immense fund ofaccumulated inheritance−factors left by one generation of men after another, whose mere existencemarks a step in the differentiation of the species. If it were permissible to personify the unconscious,we might call it a collective human being combining the characteristics of both sexes, transcendingyouth and age, birth and death, and, from having at his command a human experience of one or twomillion years, almost immortal. If such a being existed, he would be exalted above all temporalchange; the present would mean neither more nor less to him than any year in the one hundredthcentury before Christ; he would be a dreamer of age−old dreams and, owing to his immeasurableexperience, he would be an incomparable prognosticator. He would have lived countless times overIsrael Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicTHE MEANING OF MAGIC27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"the life of the individual, of the family, tribe and people, and he would possess the living sense of therhythm of growth, flowering and decay.\"Granted this kind of definition, the whole idea of suggesting ideas to this \"dreamer of age−olddreams\" sounds utterly presumptuous. Only a simpleton, living a superficial intellectual and spirituallife, would have the audacity to dare give this \"being\" suggestions relative to business, marriage, orhealth. Such a concept then immediately rules out the use of suggestion, demanding moresophisticated approaches.For the time being, and only for the purpose of this disscussion, let us grant validity to the firstconcept of the unconscious as being a titan who will respond to suggestions if the latter can be gottenthrough to him. The theory goes, therefore, that if, in the face of some bodily ill or disfunction, wecould literally tell the Unconscious what we want done, these results could occur in answer to ourconcentrated wish. Theoretically, the theory sounds all right. Unfortunately, for one thing, it does nottake into consideration the fact that early in life an impenetrable barrier is erected within the psycheitself. A barrier of inhibition is built up between the unconscious and the conscious thinking self−−abarrier of prejudices, false moral concepts, infantile notions, pride and egotism. So profound is thisarmoured barrier that our best attempts to get past it, around it, or through it are utterly impotent. Webecome cut off from our roots, and have no power, no ability, to contact the deeper, the instinctual,the more potent side of our natures.The various schools of auto−suggestion and metaphysics all have different theories and techniqueswith regard to overcoming this barrier. That some people do succeed is unquestionable. One meetsalmost every day an individual here and there who is able to \"demonstrate\"−−to use the ghastly wordthey so glibly employ. These few are able to impress their Unconscious minds with certain ideaswhich fall as though upon fertile soil, fructify and bring salutary results. These we cannotdeny−−much as sometimes we would like to, so offensive is their smugness, their dogmatic attitude,their unthinkingness.But by far the great majority of their devotees fail lamentably. They have not obviously been able toovercome this difficulty by the employment of the usual routinesI am sure the ancient sages and magi knew of these problems−−knew them very well. I am also quitesure that they realized that the technique they used was, amongst other things, a process ofsuggesting a series of creative ideas to themselves. But what I am equally certain of is this. They hadperfected an almost ideal method which proved itself able to penetrate this hitherto impenetrableendopsychic barrier. They were able to reach this imprisoned titan locked up in the hearts of everyone of us, and set it free so that it could work with them and for them. Thus they became almostIyrical in their descriptions of what could not be accomplished by the individual who employed theirtechniques with courage and perseverance.As I say, they knew of the existence of this psychic armoring, and knew it only too well. All theirmethods were directed to mobilizing all the forces of the individual, reinforcing his will andimagination, to the end that he could overcome himself to realize his kinship, his identity and unitywith the unconscious self.What these methods were, I hope to describe in some small detail in these pages. Some of them mayappear irrational to us. They certainly are irrational. But that is no argument for rejecting themsummarily. A great part of life itself is irrational. But it is incumbent upon us to accept life in all itsaspects, rational and irrational as well. One of the very earliest things a psycho−analytic patientIsrael Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicTHE MEANING OF MAGIC28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"learns is this one fact−−that he has at least two sides to his nature, a rational and an irrational side.Together they comprise a single discrete self, his personality. If he denies the validity or existence ofeither one of them, he does violence to himself and must suffer accordingly. Both of these twofactors must be permitted to exist side by side, the one affecting the other. In this way, the individualgrows, intellectually, emotionally and spiritually, and all his ways will prosper. With denial, nothingbut trouble, neurosis and disease can follow.These irrational processes that were instituted of old as the technique of Magic comprise the use ofinvocation or prayer, of the use of the imagination in formulating images and symbols, of employingthe religious sense to awaken ecstasy and an intensity of feeling, of rates of breathing that wouldalter the accustomed neuro−physiological patterns and so render more permeable the barrier withinthe mind itself. Everything that would conduce to a heightening of feeling and imagination, thatwould lead to the instigation of an overpowering ecstasy, would be encouraged, for it would be inthis psychological state that the normal barriers and confines of the conscious personality could beover−ridden in a tempestuous storm of emotional concentration.It was the ancient theory that the unconscious or the deeper levels of the psyche could be reachedprincipally by two methods. These were intense concentration, and intensity of emotion. The formeris extremely difficult of achievement. Certainly there are methods whereby the mind itself may betrained so to concentrate that eventually a funnel, as it were, is created by the mind, through whichsuggestions could be poured into the unconscious to work their way out in the various ways desired.But such methods are for the very few. There is only an individual here and there who has thepatience and the indomitable will to sit by himself for a certain period during the day, and each day,and subject himself to an iron mental discipline.The emotional intensity, while not easy to cultivate, at least is more within the bounds andpossibilities of achievement than is the other. It was this method that the ancient magicians cultivatedto a very fine art. They devised innumerable means whereby the normal physiological habits couldbe changed and altered, so as to permit of this impingement upon the underlying basis of the self.To summarise, there is Divination, the art of obtaining at a moment's notice any required type ofinformation regarding the outcome of certain actions or events. Fortune telling so−called is an abuse.The sole purpose of the art is to develop the intuitive faculties of the student to such an extent thateventually all technical methods of divination may be discarded. When that stage of development hasbeen reached, mere reflection upon any problem will automatically evoke from the intuitivemechanism within the information required, with a degree of certainty and assurance involved thatcould never be acquired save from an inner psychic source.Another phase−−perhaps that which has been stressed more than all others−−is Ceremonial Magic inits widest sense. Comprised within this expression, are at least three distinct types of ceremonialendeavour, all, however, subject to one general set of rules or governed by one major formula. Theword \"ceremonial\" includes rituals for initiation, for the invocation of Gods so−called, and theevocation of elemental and planetary spirits. There is also the enormous sphere of talismans, andtheir consecration and charging. Ceremonial is probably the most ideal of all methods for spiritualdevelopment since it entails the analysis and subsequent stimulation of every individual faculty andpower. Its results are genius and spiritual illumination. But personal aptitude is so potent a factor inthis matter, as well as in divination, that although the word \"Art\" may be applied to cover theiroperation it would be unjust to Magic to denominate it a Science.The third, and in some ways the most important branch for my particular purpose at the moment, isIsrael Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicTHE MEANING OF MAGIC29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Vision, or the Body of Light technique. It is with this latter that I shall deal exclusively in this essay,as it contains elements which I feel answer more definitely to the requirements of a Science than anyother.In discussing Magic, the reader's pardon must be sought if reference is continually made to atechnical philosophical system named the Qabalah. They are so interlaced that it is well−nighimpossible to separate them. Qabalah is theory and philosophy. On the other hand, Magic is thepractical application of that theory. In the Qabalah is a geometrical glyph named the Tree of Life,which is really a symbolic map both of the universe in its major aspects, and of its microcosm, man.Upon this map are depicted ten principal continents, so to say, or ten fields of activity where theforces constituting or underlying the Universe function in their respective ways. In man these areanalysable into ten facets of consciousness, ten modes of spiritual activity. These are called theSephiros. I cannot enter more fully into an outline of this map here though I have repeatedly referredto it here and in other essays; but the reader will find it adequately described in various books orarticles on the subject.Now consider with me that especial Sephirah or subtle aspect of the universe called by the QabalistsYesod. Translated as the sphere of the Foundation, it is part of the Astral Light−−an omniform planeof magnetic, electric, and ubiquitous substance, interpenetrating and underlying the whole of thevisible perceptible world. It acts as a more or less permanent mould whereupon the physical world isconstructed, its own activity and constant change ensuring the stability of this world as acompensating factor. In this world function the dynamics of feeling, desire and emotion, and just asthe activities of this physical world are engineered through the modalities of heat and cold,compression and diffusion, etc., so in the astral are operative attraction and repulsion, love and hate.Another of its functions is to exist as the memory of nature, wherein are automatically andinstantaneously recorded every act of man and every phenomenon of the universe from timeimmemorial to the present day. The nineteenth century Magus, Eliphas Levi, has written of thisastral Light that: \"There exists an agent which is natural and divine, material and spiritual, auniversal plastic mediator, a common receptacle of the vibrations of motion and the images of forms,a fluid and a force, which may be called in some way the Imagination of Nature....\" And again heregisters the conviction that it is \"the mysterious force whose equilibrium is social life, progress,civilization, and whose disturbance is anarchy, revolution, barbarism, from whose chaos a newequilibrium at length evolves, the cosmos of a new order, when another dove has brooded over theblackened and disturbed waters.\"It is interesting to glance from this theurgic concept to a psychological one which is not very unlikeit. The following paragraph is more or less of a paraphrase of Jung's ideas concerning it, culled froman essay of his entitled Analytical Psychology and Weltanschauung. It is an extension of the ideaspreviously quoted. He defines it first of all as the all−controlling deposit of ancestral experience fromuntold millions of years, the echo of prehistoric world−events to which each century adds aninfinitesimally small amount of variation and differentiation. Because it is in the last analysis adeposit of world−events finding expression in brain and sympathetic nerve structure, it means in itstotality a sort of timeless world−image, with a certain aspect of eternity opposed to our momentary,conscious image of the world. It has an energy peculiar to itself, independent of consciousness, bymeans of which effects are produced in the psyche that influence us all the more powerfully from thedark regions within. These influences remain invisible to everyone who has failed to subject thetransient world−image to adequate criticism, and who is therefore still hidden from himself. That theworld has not only an outer, but an inner aspect. That it is not only outwardly visible, but also actspowerfully upon us in a timeless present, from the deepest and most subjective hinterland of thepsyche−−−this Jung holds to be a form of knowledge which, regardless of the fact that it is ancientIsrael Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicTHE MEANING OF MAGIC30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"wisdom, deserves to be evaluated as a new factor in forming a philosophic world−view. I suggest,then, that what the Magicians imply by the Astral Light is identical in the last resort with theCollective Unconscious of modern psychology.By means of the traditional Theurgic technique it is possible to contact consciously this plane, toexperience its life and influence, converse with its elemental and angelic inhabitants so−called, andreturn here to normal consciousness with complete awareness and memory of that experience. This,naturally requires training. But so does every department of science. Intensive preparation isdemanded to fit one for criticial observation, to provide one with the particular scientific alphabetrequired for its study, and to acquaint one with the researches of one's predecessors in that realm. Noless should be expected of Magic−−though all too often miracles are expected without duepreparation. Anyone with even the slightest visual imagination may be so trained as to handle in buta short while the elementary magical technique, by which one is enabled to explore the subtleraspects of life and the universe. To transcend this \"many−coloured world.\" To gain admittance toloftier realms of soul and spirit is quite another matter. One calling for other faculties and otherpowers, particularly a fiery devotion and an intense aspiration to the highest.But with the latter, I am not just now concerned, even though it is the pulsing heart and moreimportant aspect of Theurgy. It is with the scientific aspect of Magic, its more readily verifiableaspect, that I shall deal now. Elsewhere I have given as traditional attributions or associations to thesphere in question the following symbols. Its planet is said to be the Moon, its element Air, itsnumber Nine, its colour purple−−and also silver in another scale. The Pearl and Moonstone are itsjewels, aloes its perfume, and its so−called divine name is Shaddai El Chai. The Archangelattributed to it is Gabriel, its choir of Angels are the four Kerubs ruling the elements, and itsgeomantic symbols are Populus and Via. The Tarot symbols appertaining to this sphere are thosecards in each of the four suits numbered IX, and closely associated with it also is the twenty−firsttrump card entitled \"The World.\" Here we find depicted a female form surrounded by a greengarland. Actually this trump card is attributed to the thirty−second path of Saturn which connects thematerial plain to Yesod. How, now, arises the question, how were these symbols and namesobtained? What is their origin? And why are they so called attributions or correspondences of thatSephirah called the Foundation?First of all, meditation will disclose the fact that all have a natural harmony and affinity one with theother−−though not perhaps readily seen at the first glance. For example, the Moon is, to us, thefastest moving planet. It travels through all the twelve signs of the zodiac in about twenty−eightdays. The idea of rapid change is there implicit, revealing the concept that the astral, while almost atimeless eternal deposit of world events, is nevertheless the origin of mutations and alterations whichlater influence the physical world−−in the same way that impulse and thought must precede anyaction. Its element is air, a subtle all pervading medium−−comparable to the astral light itself−−amedium without which life is quite impossible. Nine is the end of all numbers, containing thepreceding numbers within its own sum. It always remains itself when added to itself or multiplied, orsubtracted, suggesting the fundamental all−inclusive self−sustaining nature of lhe realm.What is still more important, however, from the scientific viewpoint is that they are things, names,and symbols actually perceived in that sphere by the skryer in the spirit−vision. As a matter of solidproof, one could quote numerous visions and astral journeys obtained by different people in differentplaces at different times, in which all the traditional symbols appear in dynamic and in curiouslydramatic and vital form.Magic, as already remarked, is a practical system, and every part has been devised for experiment.Israel Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicTHE MEANING OF MAGIC31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Each part is capable of verification using appropriate methods. Each student may check it forhimself, and thus discover the realities of his own divine nature as well as of the universe both withinand without him, independently of what any other man may have written in books. We ask forexperiment; demand it even, for the sake of mankind. We invite the earnest and sincere student toexperiment for himself with that technique described in Chapter Ten of my book The Tree of life,and then compare his results, the journey to any one Path or Sephirah, with the correspondencesbriefly delineated in my other work A Garden of Pomegranates or in Dion Fortune's book TheMystical Qabalah. It is with the utmost confidence that I say one hundred astral journeys obtained inthat way will correspond in every instance with the major symbols, names, numbers, and ideasrecorded in the several books of the Qabalah.Let me quote from the record of a colleague an illuminating passage or two illustrating what I mean.The following is a \"vision\" or waking dream−−fantasy of the so−called thirty−second path. \"Wemarched down the wide indigo road. There was a cloudy night−sky−−no stars. The road was raisedabove the general level of the ground. There was a canal each side beyond which we could see thelights of what appeared to be a large city. We went on like this for a long way, but then I noticed inthe distance a tiny figure of a woman, like a miniature−−she seemed to be naked, but as she drewnear, I saw a scarf floating round her. She had a crown of stars on her head and in her hands weretwo wands. She came towards us very quickly, and I gazed fascinatedly at a string of pearls reachingfrom her neck to her knees−−and gazing, found that we had passed through the circle of her pearls,and she had disappeared!\"The student of the Qabalah who has only a passing acquaintance with Tarot symbolism, willrecognize here the twenty−first Atu of \"The World,\" the path attributed to Saturn, linking thephysical to the astral worlds. He will probably be very surprised to learn that the symbols on thesecards represent dynamic and exceedingly vital realities. But I must pass on to a brief description ofthe entrance to Yesod.\"Now the sky is clear and full of stars... The Moon, a great yellow harvest moon, rises slowly up thesky to a full arch . . . and we saw the moonbeams shining on the high purple walls of a city. We didnot delay to look about, but marched quickly to the centre of the city, to an open space, in the midstof which was a round temple like a ball of silver. It was approached by nine steps, and rested on asilver platform. It had four doors. Before each was a large angel with silver wings... Inside, we werein a very airy place. Light breezes lifted our clothes and our hair−−the interior was very white andclear silvery−−no colours. Suspended in the centre was a great globe, like the moon itself.... Whilewe looked we saw that the globe was not suspended in the air; it rested on immense cupped hands.We followed the arms up and saw, far up near the roof, deep dark eyes looking down, dark like thenight sky. And a voice said . . .\"Little point would be gained to continue with the rest of the quotation. This passage is given heresolely that the reader may refer to the description of the astral plane in the textbooks, and then to therecurrence in this vision of the major symbols, and the dynamic form of dramatization. Let thestudent take good notice of the presence of the correct numbers, colours, planetary attributions, andabove all the hint as to how much valuable knowledge may be acquired. Note the four doors to theTemple−−representing the four major elements of fire, water, air and earth. For this astral world isalso referred to the Ether (of which the element Air is a surrogate), the fifth element,quintessentialising the lower elements, the Temple to which the other elements are but doors.Suspended in the centre of the temple was a globe, symbolic possibly of the element Air itself which,in the Hindu Tattwa system, is represented by a blue sphere. Before each of the doors stands anangel. These are the four Kerubic Angels, the vice−regents of the four cardinal quarters and elementsIsrael Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicTHE MEANING OF MAGIC32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"ruling over a particular elemental world under the dominance of one of the letters of theTetragrammaton. Possibly they are representations of the interior psychic delimitation of the soul'sspatial area, so to speak, the absence of which would indicate an unhealthy diffusion orde−centralization of consciousness. Also the four cardinal points of space would be represented bythese four angelic figures−−concretizations, too, of the double play of the moral opposites. East isopposite to west, and north oposite to south, whilst each of these quarters has attributed to it someparticular moral quality or psychic function. The sense of being in an airy place with light breezesbears out the formal attribution of air−−a curious confirmation of the duality of meaning implied inpneuma, wind and spirit, a duality which occurs not only in the Greek, but in Hebrew, Arabic, and ahost of primitive languages.Individual after individual has been trained independently to visit this and other Sephiros. Whileeach vision is somewhat different in its detail and form to that here quoted, nevertheless there is astartling unanimity so far as concerns the essential symbolic features. This constitues definitescientific proof of the surpreme reality of the world of Magic, and demonstrates the possibility ofpersonal experiment and research. Scientific research is possible in this world of astral orUnconscious realities, because they are effective things, that is, objective influences that work andinfluence mankind. This sphere is the deposit of the world experience of all times, and it is thereforean image of the world that has been forming for aeons, an image in which certain features, theso−called dominants, have been elaborated through the course of time. These dominants are theruling powers, the gods and archangels and angels−−that is representations of dominating laws andprinciples functioning in the cosmos. And since it is a world functioning in the brain structure andsympathetic nervous system of every individual it is a world which is open to every one who wishesto overcome the fear which centuries of mal−education have projected upon it, and discover forhimself anew the reality of its dynamic urges and influences.With but little ingenuity, specific tests may be undertaken with the object of testing the relationshipbetween geometrical symbols, the vision obtained therefrom by means of the body of lighttechnique, and the correspondences of these figures recorded in the proper books. It has been writtenthat various elements−−Fire, Water, Spirit, Air and Earth−−−are attributed to the five points of thePentagram. Depending entirely on the direction in which the lines are traced, so will the figureinvoke or banish the beings pertaining to that element. For example, if the student traces theinvoking Pentagram of Fire in each of the four cardinal quarters, and then employs the sensitive sightof the Body of Light which previously he has cultivated, he will see appear almost immediately thefire elementals or Salamanders, the personalized fiery constituents of his own psyche. The tracing ofthe banishing fire pentagram will see them literally scuttle away without hesitation, subsiding intothe Unconscious realm to which they belong, and from which they were called. Or let the student dothis experiment in the presence of a reliable clairvoyant, not mentioning what figure is being traced.The results will be highly illuminating. I know some objection may be raised by immediatelyresponding \"telepathy.\" But so far as I can see, the response arouses far more obscure problems thanthe rationale to which objection is made, for telepathy certainly requires explanation along scientificand dependable lines, quite difficult at this stage of the game. These and a host of other rigorous testsconstitute definite and precise scientific experiment of a significant and highly authoritative nature.In the sense that several people may travel to certain paths and there undergo experiences whereinthe essential features are identical or in which the psychic dominants coincide, Magic may beassumed to be a definite, coherent science. It is precise and accurate. Magic is the accumulatedrecord of psychic and spiritual experience which we have inherited from the past, from formergenerations of mankind.Israel Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicTHE MEANING OF MAGIC33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"On the other hand, it is clear that each of these visions would differ materially as to context, that is inthe dramatic sense. The context, act and scene so to speak, depend entirely upon personalidiosyncrasy, intellectual integrity, and the spiritual capacity to discover and absorb the truth,whether it is painful to the ego or not. Where the personal element enters so powerfully as it doeshere, the adventure must be labelled an Art. Creative imagination in one person will be used toformulate with an established conventional set of symbols a whole string of incidents andexperiences−−illuminating and tending to the expansion of his consciousness−−which to the visionof a simple unimaginative person would occur in far simpler and matter−of−fact form.Sophisticated people, with a smattering of modern psychology, are likely to assume that Magicdiscloses nothing but the hidden depths of the Unconscious. They will say that these journeys arecomparable to dream experiences which are referred to the working and dramatizing power of thesubconscious mind. What difference does it make if the Qabalists named this sphere or type ofconsciousness the Foundation or Astral World and the moderns the Unconscious? The terms arecognate, and the symbols interchangeable; both mean the same thing, when all things are considered.If Magic possesses weapons that are more penetrating and incisive than scientific ones, shall wereject them because Magic is the discredited house where they are stored? If magical methods revealour secret selves more directly, and unlock the vast store of wisdom and power within our souls,showing us how to control them in ways that neither psycho−analysis nor any modern science hassucceeded to do, should we not be foolish to reject its benefits?Magic is a scientific method. It is a valid technique. Its approach to the universe and the secret oflife's meaning is a legitimate one. If it assists us to become more familiar with what we really are, itis a Science−−and a most important one. And to the scientist, whether he be psychologist orphysicist, it will open up an entirely new universe of tremendous extent. If it succeeds in making usbetter men and women, a little more kind and generous, a little more aware of the spiritual heights towhich we are capable of climbing with but a little exertion, then it is the religion of religions. Andshould it spur us to greater efforts in order to render life and living more beautiful and intelligible,should it make us more anxious to eliminate ugliness, suffering, and ignoble misery, surely it is anArt before which all other Muses must bow the head and bend the knee in reverential and perennialpraise!Israel Regardie: The Art Meaning of MagicTHE MEANING OF MAGIC34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Regardie: The Art and Meaning of Magic;Bibliographical NoteBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTEIn \"Magic in East and West\" the magical techniques referred to are dealt with in some detail inMAGICAL RITUAL METHODS by W.
