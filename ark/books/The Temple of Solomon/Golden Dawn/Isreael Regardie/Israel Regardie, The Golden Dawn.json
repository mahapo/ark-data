It was then that (according to history and \"myth\") Dr. William Westcott discovered a cipher manuscript that led to the founding of an English branch of Die Goldene Dammerung in 1888. It was this Golden Dawn that attractedsome of the most talented personalities of the time - including W. 8. Yeats, Algernon Blackwood, Arthur Machen, Florence Farr, Annie Horniman, A. E. Waite, S. L. MacGregor Mathers, Dion Fortune and Aleis- ter Crowley. And it was this Golden Dawn that itself provided a NEW DAWN for \"occultism\" in the early 20th century. In the early 1900s, the original Order began to fragment. First Crowley pub- lished many of the G.D. rituals in The Equinox and left to form his own order, the A.A., in 1905. The original Isis-Urania Temple expelled Mathers, and then - as The Stella Matutina - under the direction of Waite, put more emphasis on mysticism than had the original G.D. Later Dion Fortune broke off from this Temple to form her own Inner Light group. It was as a member of the Stella Matutina that Israel Regardie first published a nearly complete set of the rituals and teachings in 1937-40 as the first edition of this present work. Later he sold the copyrights for this and most of his other books at that time to the Aries Press, and I purchased them in 1968 and brought out the second edi- tion, with new material from Regardie, in 1969. As Sam Webster points out in the Epilogue to this fifth edition, this book has been the foundation for much of the \"occult revival\" of the last half of the twentieth cen- tury. It has provided resource materials for Wicca, the New Paganism, various magi- cal groups, and for tens of thousands of serious students. And as Cris Monnastre points out in her Introduction, it is now beginning to pro- vide a structure into which modern psychology can flow to bring about a solution to the present world crisis which demands a dramatic expansion of consciousness and of the 'tools' of awareness. It is the actual \"structured\"experience of magic - whether it be attained through group or solitary work - that is vital to the accelerated evolution of human con- sciousness beyond present limitations, and to the expansion of human awareness from communal to global dimensions. And it is this that is essential to avoida~ce of nuclear rw3r and to the restor~tion of Nature to the environment and of humanity lo Nature. The Golden Dawn is a curriculum of study, a workbook to the Great Work, and Cris Monnastre has provided guidelines to the practical approach to the Work. I can- not emphasize enough the importance of personal work, for it is that - whether undertaken alone or with a group - that is important. Only personal work can accomplish true initiation. And The Golden Dawn is a valid curriculum for personal work even for those associated with other than Golden Dawn groups or systems of magical study. One of the great messages of the New Age is that of eclecticism - if it works, use it! There are many other valuable and valid resources for our evolution, and in this time of \"quick-"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"ening\", all are pertinent. But it is a personal and regular program of meditation that brings order to what otherwise might prove chaotic. Such a program, combined with the simple magical exercises of \"The Middle Pillar\" and \"Banishing Ritual of the Pen- tagram\", and the keeping of a journal will initiate your own journey to the Light! I want to give special appreciation to the writers who have added important materials to this new edition, but I also want to give personal appreciation to Israel Regardie for having recognized in 1937 that the \"time for secrecy\" was over. The twentieth century is a time in which the knowledge of the past has to be brought for- ward and integrated into a new \"common sense\" upon which a new humanity can be built. Once, years ago, when I first talked about buying the Golden Dawn copyrights from the Aries Press, another occult writer made a statement to the effect that no one could \"own\" this knowledge -for it all came originally from God! I think that concept describes exactly what we are dealing with: true Spiritual Technology, Treat it as such! Throughout this edition we have retained the original pagination so that referen- ces to the original four volume edition could still be identified. I have made correc- tions to the original where they were needed, but unless important to the readers' perception I have not made changes to the style. In addition, I am very much indebted to Cris Monnastre, MaDhyan Anupassana, George Wilson, Hal Sundt and Sam Webster for their help and their contributions. In most cases these are identified by initials, along with my own, in footnotes. And it is with a great deal of pleasure that I announce that Cris Monnastre has been instrumental in bringing together these, and other G.D. practitioners, who will be producing a future series of \"Golden Dawn Manuals\" to develop individual techniques and exercises for study and use.

This book is different, for several reasons, and you will find advice on how to use it in the introductions by Cris Monnastre and Israel Regardie. Because it is a big book, and because it is both a text for study and a guide to practice as well as an encyclopedic reference work, you will use it many different ways. In the Table of Contents, we have listed the major rituals in italics for easier location, and we have provided an extensive listing of the illustrations and tables to be make reference use easier and faster. Hopefully, in a subsequent edition, we will be able to provide a comprehensive index. Page Numbers. There are two sets of them: those referring to this edition will be found at the top outer margin, or at the bottom center. Those that refer to the original four-volume edition may be found bracketed at the left margin to indicate approximately the location of the page break in the text. At the top of the page will be found reference to the original Volume and Book numbers. It is hoped in this way that references to the original edition found in other works may be easily located. Corrections and Additions. Any book of this size can be expected to have some errors. We have corrected all those in the original edition that we could locate, and have subjected this edition to several proof-readings. Yet, we know that some will continue to be found. It is our hope that readers will consider this book so important that they will send us notes of such further corrections that we may make in future editions. We have also made some additions in the form of short introductions to some of the sections and as footnotes to the text where we felt clarification was needed. Future Work. The Golden Dawn is a complete system of Ceremonial Magic. Within the system may be found the basic technologies of spiritual develop- ment and their practical application. Future books and tapes in this series will simplify and expand these techniques, including the initiatory rituals, for greater ease of study and use. Lodges and Study Groups. The Golden Dawn system is not dependent on a£filiation with any group proclaiming itself as \"Golden Dawn\" or \"Rosicrucian\". Nor, even though the initiatory rituals describe a lodge system, is group practice necessary for their enactment. All magic must ultimately take place in the psyche of the student. There are existing Golden Dawn Lodges, and Lodges and Study Groups of other organizations teaching ceremonial magic. Often the most practical way to make contact with a group is by placing an advertisement in a local New Age or Occult tabloid or magazine. xii"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Introduction To The Fifth Edition \"Inheritor of a Dying World, we call thee to the Living Beauty. Wanderer in the Wild Darkness, we call thee to the Gentle Light. Long hast thou dwelt in Darkness - Quit the Night and seek the Day.\" With these poetic and deeply symbolic words, the three principal officers in the Neophyte Grade ceremony ritually bring the candidate into the Order of the Golden Dawn as well as to the Light. This is not unlike Edinger's explanation in Ego and Archetype of the circular development of the ego-Self axis of which the anima may be the bridge. The \"Night\" is the unconscious, and the \"Day\" increased consciousness. Edinger refers to an alternating process of ego-Self separation and ego-Self union as a spiral-like psychological development throughout all of life. Whereas this is natural to the human condition, the system of the Golden Dawn acts as a precise catalytic agent which accelerates this growth toward Soul much as a \"hot house\" or \"grow light\" influen- ces the quality and development of plant growth. One may ask why the necessity for \"acceleration.\" Considering the world's current political arena and that we are no longer, in a deeper reality, separate nations but a worldwide community, as much \"consciousness\"as possible is gravely necessary unto the very survival of our planet. Additionally, what with pervasive technological implementation, we also must estab- lish and maintain connection with the instinctual, transpersonal, and powerfully \"rooted\"experience of the deeper layers of the unconscious. And for this, the Golden Dawn provides its wonderous reservoir of symbol, sacrament, and ceremonial. It is important to establish that Israel Regardie did not look upon the Golden Dawn system as an abstruse or interesting \"occult\" oddity of the turn of this last cen- tury. In his initial introduction for the first publication of this book in the late nineteen thirties he writes, \"It is for this reason that I hold that the Golden Dawn magic, the technique of initiation, is of supreme and inestimable importance to mankind at large. In it the work of academic psychology may 5nd a logical conclusion and fruition, so that it may develop further its own particular contribution to modern life and culture. For this psycho-magical technique of ceremonial initiation indicates the solution of the 'anima' problem. 'Arise! Shine! For thy light is come!' \" And Regardie unreser- vedly maintained this position until his death in 1985. Thinking through and fully understanding the usage of such terms as \"occult\" or \"magic\" apart from their historically negative or even lurid connotations is fun- damental. The association of these words with \"black\" magic or Satanism has uniform- ly been the result of hysteria, narcissistic theatrics, capitalization by the media, or psychosis. To truly explore the \"dark arts\" (or in other words, apprehend the arche- type of the shadow) through systematic ritual work demands not only extraordinary knowledge, discipline, and training, but a great deal of plain hard work toward which would-be dabblers never seem inclined. For any of us to integrate our \"darkerl'side is a lifelong and necessary process, buf a process which yields toward a more fullness of Self. As Edinger comments, \"All these aspects of the rejected shadow are equated with the 'King,' which means psychologically that acceptance of the shadow and compassion xvii"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"for the inferior manare equivalent to acceptance of the Self.\"The masses have projec- ted (and not integrated) their shadow from the witch burnings of Salem to con- gressional hearings on censorship of lyrics in rock music. The\"occu1t\"means nothing more than the study of what is \"hidden\" beyond the perception of the five senses. Electricity could be construed as an \"occult\"force, and indeed to primitive man (as it manifested as an electrical storm) who partook of the mysterious since this was beyond the bounds of the ordinary. But electricity is no longer a \"magical\" force, for modern man has understood and harnessed it. So too, there are other forces beyond electricity and even nuclear power awaiting their further discovery and definition by man. And as Crowley articulated, \"magic\"means creating change through conscious- ness at will. The alchemist preceded the chemist, the astrologer the astronomer. And the Magician is a threshold to an inner frontier which encompasses the limitless possibilities of the manifested and unknown universe as being contained, dormant, but inevitably actualized \"within\" the psyche. There is no better explanation of the structure, function, and basic concepts of the Golden Dawn system than in Regardie's introduction to the original edition of this book contained herein. This extensive and clarifying narrative demands reread- ing again and again. The Golden Dawn is a \"system\" of discovering, dialoguing, and even negotiating with the collective unconscious and is not a religion, philosophy or even a cult. As the candidate is about to take the obligation of the Neophyte, the Hierophant assures him or her that, \"There is nothing contrary to your civil, moral, or religious duties in this Obligation.\" Furthermore, the Hierophant reminds the can- didate to respect all religions, for each contains a spark of the divine. The key theme in both the Neophyte Grade and the ritual of Adeptus Minor is that of being brought to the Light. This Light is also referred to as L.V.X. In the introduc- tion to Volumes 111 and IV of The Golden Dawn, Regardie's excellent analysis of the keyword (I.N.R.I.) and subsequent gematric correspondences and conclusions will bear fruit from continued study and meditation regarding this Light. But a true \"se- cret\" of the entire system is that this Light is not a metaphysical or philosophically speculative construct meaning grace, spirituality, or healing (although the Light does bring all of these) but is an ACTUAL FORCE which although independent of egoic man can be generated by man through the use of his consciousness to bring about CHANGE AT WILL! Although the so-called \"new\" physics has begun to come closer with any variety of theoretical models for this \"force,\" the brilliant work of Fred Alan Wolf in such books as Star Wave has come closest to explaining L.V.X. and the paradigmatic raison d'etre for not only what the Golden Dawn is based upon, but why it \"works\"! Wolf's work echoes Regardie's intuitive leap of fifty years ago when Regardie felt (as in the above quotation) that psychology would find its \"logical conclusion and fruition\" within the Golden Dawn system! Although Wolf makes no reference to the Golden Dawn or L.V.X. per se, he has dealt a death knell to a classical physics model of psychological theory while a quantum mechanics model has been astoundingly and secretly kerneled within the profound symbology and initiatory technique of the Golden Dawn system for countless years! To quote Wolf, \"It is my dream that quan- tum physics will bridge the gap between science and mysticism. As such it must lead thinkers and researchers to a new view of human behavior. B.F. Skinner was not so wrong in attempting to deal with behavior scientifically, but he was the Newton of behaviorists. We now search for the Einstein and the Bohr of human behavior to develop the quantum model of human beings.\" L.V.X. is generated in a number of ways and these are through ceremonial magic, the Middle Pillar technique, the Vibratory Formula of the Middle Pillar, and the Opening by Watchtower. Although Regardie published a progressive ritualuse of the Opening by Watchtower in Ceremonial Magic, I would advise the beginning student to leave this particular ceremony strictly alone until he or she felt well within the initiatory containment and safety of the Second Order either through personal work xviii"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"or within an initiatory group. (Later in this introduction I will offer suggestions for the individual to plan a safe and successful approach to this Work overall.) This Light knows no moral or conscionable dictate. (Fire can bum your hand as surely as cook your favorite recipe!) But this is the \"holy and formless fire\" which either man- ifests in our external environment through the screen of our disciplined and CON- SCIOUS image making (Crowley gave great emphasis to developing the concentrated image making aspect of consciousness) as well as through the auto- matic UNCONSCIOUS complexes of our personalities. And hence Regardie insisted upon some form of psychotherapeutic work once the unconscious had been activated by the ritual work since it was unlikely that the Neophyte had yet even knowledge of the possibility of control of image building with consciousness and what effect this could have on the personal life, let alone the discipline to imple- ment it. The Neophyte was equally unlikely to be aware of the \"sleeping dogs\" (to use a phrase of Blavatsky's) or unconscious complexes of the personality and how those unknown parts of ourselves influence our lives. This brings us to a discussion of \"initiation.\" Initiation means \"beginning\" and if performed effectively, brings the candidate to an entirely new threshold and phase of experience. Initiation in itself does not bring \"happiness\" or \"wishes come true.\" It is a starting point for difficult personal work ahead, and once the symbols are activated within the sphere of the candidate, it can mean many months, even years of difficult inward personal labor from one Grade to the next. The INNER completion of a ritual Grade does in fact bring a new awareness, more personal free- dom from automatic parts of oneself, increased control over conscious image build- ing, and a greater power, but with most of us this is usually hard won and painful. As to who is capable of initiating, the question of \"succession\" or \"lineage\" or the \"transfer of power\" has been debated for years regarding its pros and cons. Ulti- mately, the only person who can truly initiate another is one who has not only done the work pertaining to the particular Grade, but for the complete Order into which he or she initiates someone else. Unless the totality of the symbols is within the sphere of sensation of the initiator, little will be activated within the candidate and the ritual will be shallow the theatrics. As Jung wrote in a foreword to a book of Michael Fordham's \"The treatment of the transference reveals in a pitiless light what the healing agent really is: it is the degree to which the analyst himself can cope with his own psychic problems.\" Just as the analyst can no more guide an analysand through territory he or she never struggled with or confronted within him or herself, so too the initiator's effectiveness rests upon how well he or she has built the \"Temple not made with hands\" within his or her own psyche. In the late 1960s, the seeds of my destiny were actively fertilized toward what I much later understood as my personal \"dance\" with the unconscious, the process of magical initiation, the Golden Dawn system, and the Western Mystery Tradition. In the earlier part of 1969, I had had a brief, albeit intoxicating, exposure to Jungian analysis in San Francisco. In the latter part of 1969, by way of a powerful and unusual synchronicity, I had been told about a Los Angeles organization called Builders of the Adytum which had been founded by Paul Foster Case (who I was to much later find out had been a participant in a Golden Dawn Temple of the earlier 1900s). It took a full year for these connections to ripen before I embarked upon Case's excellent correspondence lessons in a committed way. His work introduced me to an exciting and enriching world of the symbolism of Tarot, Qabalah, and basic ritual. These lessons provided me with a solid foundation which has played a significant part in my magical career ever since. In that first year, I had a profound sense of a sudden major change of conscious- ness which manifested as frequent mystical-like experiences and a daily and perva- sive \"feeling\" of numinosity regarding my experience of life around and within me. As I look back on my early journal entries during this year, on the surface they"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"appear naive, almost child-like as to the extent of a new found trust in the transper- sonal and a \"sweetness\" and joy with life. This was not unlike what Regardie had referred to in The Eye And The Triangle as the \"awakening\" which comes unbidden and cannot be determined by good works, conscious wishes, or the best of intentions. My former way of experiencing life was over and behind me. I had truly become a fresh inquisitive Child of the Universe. I enjoyed this upwelling type of experience almost daily for at least a year as an infant enjoys suckling the warm nourishing breast. But the Child was to grow into greater consciousness and Light, and although the Child leads with delight, sparkle, and vivaciousness; responsibility, hard work, and even the pain of struggle and loss are inevitable once psychic contact with the gods pre- sents the challenge toward further consciousness and inner growth beyond the safety of womb, new birth and breast. In the fall of 1971, I had \"accidentally\" noticed a copy of Llewellyn's then current edition of Regardie's The Golden Dawn in a bookstore. I perused these books with a combination of awe, confusion, and reverence. The material was abstruse, and I remember while looking through its pages that I had a fleeting moment of fear (an Alice falling down the rabbit hole!!) as well as a sense of recognition, and realization that this information would thoroughly upset my current constructs of viewing life. My \"rational\" side felt ready for a fall! I left the books remaining on the store shelf! Over the next several weeks, Regardie's writing became intensely more visible to me through any variety of additional \"accidents.\" In early October, without my - - requesting, a stranger spbntaneously gave me Regardie's tklephone number and encouraged me to contact him. I spoke with Reaardie for the first time on October 9, 1971. I &ote in my journal simpli that day \"I seek Initiation.\" I wrote further, \"How sweet the Rose.\" I had virtually no idea at the time how powerful these simple words, their meaning, and the images they engendered were to become for me over the next 15 years! On the evening of October 20, 1971 I had had my most powerful and perhaps last mystical experience of this earlier period. While meditating on the Tarot Trump, \"The Hermit,\" I was aware of a separate \"consciousness\" other than my own which I sensed clearly communicating the following via an inner awareness: \"Come! Join Me at the Summit, and we shall watch the Dawn come upon us before others even know the Hour of Awakening is at hand. Run! Hurry! So that you too might sing with Me and rejoice in the Morning Light!\" Two days later I sat opposite Regardie in his office in Studio City, California. I was 25 years of age, and I knew absolutely noth- ing about the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn! I knew that Regardie had been practicing as a Reichian therapist at that time and my initial meeting with him was for purposes of introducing myself, inquiring about Reichian technique, and exploring with him why he felt psychotherapy was of such importance along with a magical regimen. I was too shy to venture any serious ques- tions about the nature of magic, and the few I hinted toward he avoided completely. Midway through my time with him, he had me read aloud from Light On The Path by Mabel ~ollins.'klthbu~h a lengthy passage, it is well worth quotinihere since it givis the student the first inkling of the personal Genius or more poetically, the Holy Guar- dian Angel.

I entered into Reichian therapy with Regardie for a period of approximately two years. Apart from Reich's method of therapy, he also incorporated some basic prana- yama yoga techniques and chiropractic adjustments. But he also occasionally worked at activating one chakra located below my breastbone and above my solar plexus which on the Tree of Life would correspond to Tiphareth. Within a brief time, I felt the \"streamings\" referred to by Reich in his writings and others who have experienced this kind of therapeutic work. But the experience of this particular chakra being activated was beyond description! On one occasion I experienced an actual glowing, pulsating sphere within the center of my body which felt like an electrified tennis ball! Years later, however, I am convinced that this kind of occurrence was not just the result of Regardie's success as a good Reichian therapist, but also due to many years of his own dedicated work with the Middle Pillar technique which he frequently referred to as the \"sine qua non\" of all magical work. In other words, Regardie was able, by a kind of process of induction, to begin to open me up to the entrance of powerful healing creative energy from profoundly deep reservoirs of the uncon- scious (and in the absence of verbal therapy!). Wilhelm Reich had called this energy \"orgone\" and, in his opinion, it is what numberless generations before revered and worshipped as \"God.\" A Jungian may call this Soul, Self, or \"meaning\" depending upon individual interpretation. Or a Freudian may relate to this phenomenon as a release of libido. But the Magician calls this experience and influx of energy L.V.X. and with proper training and dedication, is able to release it him or herself WITHOUT THE AID OF AN OUTSIDE PERSON OR AGENCY! Regardie had a phenomenal ability in generating this kind of energy quickly and efficiently. However, once in 1982 he confided to me that if any person worked the Middle Pillar technique twice daily for a significant period of time, that the same result would eventually occur. If this daily work were combined with sustained relax- ation and prolonged rhythmic deep breathing, one could, in effect, become one's OWN \"Hierophant\"and trust that one's personal Genius would guide one within the pure intention of sincere effort. Several months into my therapeutic work with Regardie, he one day suddenly placed a copy of Crowley's The Holy Books in my hands. I had read very little of Crowley at that time. He asked me to open the book at random and suggested that by doing so, I mught have a more conscious sense of my \"Dharma\" or destiny. I opened to the Path of Tav, the Path of Saturn, the Astral plane, and the Path of the uncon- scious. My \"dance\" with the inner life, the nonrational and unconscious life has blessedly unfolded ever since! My therapy with Regardie ended in 1974 and for the next two years we were occasionally in contact with each other. I then moved out of the Los Angeles area, and we maintained a correspondence for several years. Throughout this time, he still con- tinued to be reticent regarding any discussion of magical matters. In 1979, while I was experiencing anxiety and an acute depression, he suggested I begin working the Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram daily for a full year and in complete silence during that time. The tide had turned, and this was my true entry into practical magic! In 1981, Regardie gave me a gift of approximately 200 pieces of his lifelong magi- cal paraphernalia and equipment which is currently in a bank vault and will even- tually be sent as a gift to the Warburg Institute in London, England for preservation and future generations to appreciate and experience. At this same time, Regardie had also made a gft of his practical alchemical equipment to another friend. He had se- cretly maintained an alchemical laboratory in a garage adjacent his house for nearly 10 xxi"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"years! Although Regardie's earlier conceptions pertaining to the \"Stone of the Wise\" reflected that the alchemical process was one of spiritual transformation, in the latter years before he died he changed his thinking and did believe in an actual \"philosopher's stone.\" He had told me about such a Stone where one took off slight shavings with a sharp knife and mixed them with a small amount of white wine to be ingested daily. He also had several physicists and mathemati- cians around the country quietly working toward a scientific solution of the \"Stone of the Wise.\" This was not an aging man's fantasy attempting to defy death's inevitability. Metaphorically, this was a Leonardo DaVinci who was making \"intuitive drawings\" of his conception of the \"flying machine\"! Between 1981 and 1983, I studied magic under Regardie in his home and per- sonal Temple in Sedona, Arizona. Hundreds of hours of personal instruction, stim- ulating conversation, practical ritual, magical drill, and warm companionship replaced his reticence of discussing magical topics ten years before! This time with him had been a period of true asylum for me, and experiencing the pristine though primitive atmosphere of his home in Sedona with its \"red rock landscapes and quiet lifestyle contributed to the romantic conception of the \"magical retirement.\" In the summer of 1983, Regardie and I traveled to Fiji, Australia and New Zealand for magical as well as personal reasons. His magical career had turned full circle with his re-connection with the Felkin's legacy in New Zealand, and power- ful feelings and memories were stirred within him with a disquieting poignancy. He had once remarked that the \"giants\" of magic had all died, and while in New Zealand reflected upon who would continue on with the work he had so carefully helped to preserve over the past fifty years. In New Zealand, I purchased a novel by Mary Renault, which I read on the tedious plane ride. Its title proved to be predic- tive. When Regardie and I returned to the United States, I was never to see him again. He died two years later. The novel I read was entitled The King Must Die. Regardie's work and legacy is that he established a bridge from the Victorian magicians to the modem day inquiring student. But the crucial question is how does that student approach and benefit from this vast and complex wealth of sym- bology and ritual without the aid of a guide or the support of a working group. And more importantly, how does the Golden Dawn system successfully make a \"difference\" in the individual's usual way of experiencing life. I am convinced that by working assiduously, or as Crowley would say \"Work. . . Work blindly, foolishly, misguidedly, it doesn't matter in the end. Work in itself has absolute virtue\" is an essential attitude to be taken toward this work. And hard work it is! I know of two women who intuitively decided to perform the Neophyte cere- mony, imagining the roles of the officers while acting as Neophyte. Although they had no duly installed Hierophant presiding, and may not have understood the magical formulae underlying their action at the time, the results were remark- able in terms of their individual magical growth and eventually being linked with an active Temple. Upon approaching this book, I would make the following suggestions. For the first several weeks, read Regardie's introduction to the original edition contained herein. I would suggest several careful readings since this gives the student an overview of the history, structure, and function of not only the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn but of the Great Work itself. Allow this material to settle deeply into consciousness by reflecting, meditating, or associating any variety of images or ideas to it. Then I would suggest reading the First Knowledge Lecture and then immediately begin the task of memorizing the Hebrew alphabet and its correspondences, both found within the First I Knowledge lecture. Within this system, the Hebrew alphabet has no connotation I of religion or sect. Its letters are considered \"generic\" and \"holy\" symbols-pow- erful doorways into the inner world-and are not associated with dogma or eso- I I teric religious organization. A convenient way of memorizing these letters is to I place them on \"flash\" cards, not unlike what we have all become acquainted i xxii I i"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"- -- rh a small amount of ,-- : 1, arm companionship T-=. before!

The next step is to acquire a notebook of some kind and begin a magical journal which must be kept daily, even if it is only to quickly jot down that no work was accomplished on a given day or that one was ill. I have heard so many excuses throughout the years that journal keeping is cumbersome, purposeless, or simply not convenient, but the journal is essential. Not only is it a means of keeping track of one's progress, but it becomes the means for an active dialogue with the her world and one's unconscious. The way in which a journal is kept can be as varied as is appro- priate to any one personality, but apart from the date and time and a record of one's magical work; dreams, fantasies, body sensations, events of the day, synchronicities, astrological aspects and transits, and spontaneous imagery can all be incorporated at the choice of the student. At this point, I would suggest the student make a full year's commitment to per- forming the Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram twice a day. And this should be done with a vow to silence, meaning that one does not discuss one's personal work with friends, even if they be of likernindedness. The purpose of this is to begin building with \"thought,\" that is, by paying \"attention\" to a particular system of symbols they are then \"built\" within the \"sphere of sensation\" or aura much as a sculptor creates with clay. The Astral Light as termed by French occultist Eliphas Levi (Louis Al- phonse Constant) is malleable by FOCUSED and CONCENTRATED thought! The symbols thus created within the aura act as doorways for healing, inspiration, protec- tion, and guidance and prevent emotional and psychological contagion. How many of us have felt depleted by being around a depressed person or otherwise influenced by a negative environment. Using the description of this ritual in the First Knowledge lecture as a guide, with right hand at full extension straight ahead, the Banishing Pentagram begins just opposite the left hip tracing a large inverted 'Y\" down to the right hip crossing up to and outwards from the left shoulder, over to the right shoulder, and then most impor- tantly reconnectingat the starting point. The dagger is never lowered and also traces a circle connecting each pentagram. The tracing is imagined as blue flame flecked with gold, not unlike a gas flame. The four archangels are imagined as towering figures which bring a refreshing Air from the East, cleansing Water from the West, purifying Fire from the South, and Earth as a stabilizer in perseverance from the North. The ritual is performed without expecting results, change, or power, but quietly per- severed in for a full year while carefully noting how it affects the personality and outer life. Ideally, the ritual should be performed in the same location apart from the gaze of others, and if possible, in a place set apart from day to day interference. At this point, I would then suggest the student read the Neophyte Ritual slowly, carefully, and contemplatively over the period of at least a month while still maintain- ing daily devotion to the Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram and persevering in the memorization work discussed above. It is within this ritual that are the formulae for future practical magical operations as well as it being the engine whereby the can- didate is brought to the Light. The importance of this ritual cannot be emphasized enough, not only in its content, but in the movements and identities of the officers as well as a kind of \"glamour\" that is created by a number of the speeches. Although the style of writing is at times oblique, this is not only a ritual to be understood in terms of its content, but to be additionally \"experienced\" devoid of rational explanation of content! And the writing style facilitates this greatly. Toward the end of this month, the student may wish to add the Neovhvte meditation which also is contained within the ~irst ~nowied~e lecture. ~lthoug'h ~e~ardie was never attracted to or impressed by these simple meditations at the end of each Knowledge Lecture, I have - found them of immense value. This then is a suggested schema for approaching each of the elemental rituals and Knowledge Lectures in the Outer Order that follow the Neophyte Ritual. The xxiii"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"elemental rituals have been criticized from a variety of courts as to their superfi- ciality or continued maintenance of Victorian occult \"claptrap.\" Nothing could be further from the truth! Anyone who would make such allegations has not expe- rienced these rituals in full Temple again and again and seen their worth, stimu- lating possibility and enduring freshness. If the student would persevere slowly and with discipline in the above for at least six months, a very firm foundation would be laid indeed! At that point, a study of the Inner Order rituals and the material of Books Four, Five, and Six will not only be easier to comprehend, but a fertile inner \"soil\" within the psyche will have been well prepared for the plant- ing of powerful inner life generating seeds. At this point the student should begin to pay persistent attention to the \"Z documents, appreciating that a life- time will never exhaust their amazing wealth of possibilities and inspiration. Finally, echoing Regardie's earlier warning, and a fair warning it is, the Enochi- an system of magic should be left strictly alone until one has left no other stone unturned in this book to the point where every correspondence is memorized, every technique understood, and every ritual experienced. The above suggestions presuppose that the student will be working alone, and working alone can be a very effective way to approach one's Holy Guardian Angel or personal Genius through attention to this inner awareness, inspiration, and guidance. The \"Right\" persons or situation will automatically be available for the individual as he or she is ready for them, as in the often quoted occult aphorism, paraphrased: when the student is ready, the teacher will appear. SO there should be a relaxed attitude toward persisting in the work and knowing that one is guided in spite of oneself! However, the student may eventually be brought into contact with a group and the following are important issues to reflect upon. ALL groups have a hierarchy or \"pecking\" order even if this may be heatedly denied by the group. Regardie felt that the Golden Dawn system was particularly effective in activating the darker or unknown parts of each member. While this may be true, it has been my observation that ANY group (be it even most benign and well-intentioned in its purpose) still grapples with projections of all kinds and ultimately with the issue of POWER! A talented and creative professor of mine once commented to me several years ago that the next great frontier for psychological research (beyond the current fascination with sex roles) was power! Participation in group effort automatically calls for multiple parental and sibling projections and each person's genetic material comes into play. The student's only safeguard in these situations is \"consciousness,\" which is not easily come by! Regardie felt the only way for these conflicts to be worked through was for the individual to be in psychotherapy in tandem with magical work. His adamant insistence upon this is something to be seriously examined. While driving back to his home from Flagstaff, Arizona one day through a tentative drizzling rain, Regardie had confided to me that it had taken him about seven years to recover from his breach with Crowley. At some point, Dion For- tune had offered him rest and asylum in her country home in the neighborhood of Glastonbury in England. There the younger Regardie went to heal and plan his life further. Fortune was fascinated by this \"new\" brand of self-exploration called Freudian \"analysis\" and even went so far as to engage in being (what was then called) a \"lay\" analyst. This term meant that the analyst was not bound by the training, educational, or licensure restrictions which were adopted in the United States sometime after World War 11, but instead studied privately under a mentor who more often than not was one's own analyst. I would speculate that Fortune was a significant influence on Regardie at that time in terms of aiding him toward a different kind of explanation of the chaos and abandonment he had been experiencing up to that point as well as helping him to forage an expanded understanding of the future direction of his life within the contain- ment of his interests in magic and mysticism. Regardie experienced Jungian analysis in London and Reichian therapy later in New York City. While he maintained a profound respect for Jung's theoretical con- cepts, he felt that Reichian technique was infinitely more effective than free associa- xxiv"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"; 5 rs their superfi- r '.;?thing could be , .. 1~3 has not expe- jii-i- :-.sir worth, stimu- ~b.

While both approaches to therapy have their merits and limitations, I am more convinced that the \"match\" between therapist and client is a more salient issue than orien- tation. I would suggest that the student who engages in therapy in tandem with magical work read the first edition of Robert Langs' Psychotherapy, A Basic Text, as a guide, paying particular attention to what Langs refers to as the \"frame- work.\" The \"framework (or Jungian \"temenos\") is universal and essential, and depending on how well a therapist maintains it, determines the outcome and effectiveness of therapy. In Regardie's first edition of The Middle Pillar in 1938 he wrote, \"These ideas are mentioned not because a systematic union of Magic and Psychology will be here presented, but in the hope that this effort will spur some psychologist acquainted with magical and mystical techniques to attempt such a task. Who- ever does succeed in welding the two indissolubly together, to him mankind will ever be grateful.\" And so this book has great value for therapists as well to explore its content for fresh ideas and catalytic suggestions toward innovative research. Jung's The psycho lop^ of Transference is immeasurably illuminated by Golden Dawn concepts of Rosicrucianism and alchemy. When Jung speaks of the \"rose\" in this work, by interpreting that rose as the Rose Cross of the Inner Order, one's associations and insights are deeply enriched knowing that this is not an abstruse alchemical reference, but a powerful engine for any variety of practical purpose. Additionally, Edinger's development of such themes in Ego and Archetype as the \"blood of Christ\" or the four elements is markedly enhanced when understood with the respective Golden Dawn concepts pertaining to the Hebrew letter \"Shin\" or the significance of the four elements on the altar in the Neophyte Hall. The Current of The Hermetic Order the Golden Dawn is alive with a bril- liant blaze reignited by Regardie's patient tending to it over the past 50 years when many a storm threatened to extinguish it when it became a small spark. And the student willfind that Current by personal inner work and not through external organizations, initiations for a fee, or publicized Grade attainments. As Paul Foster Case wrote in The Trzie and Invisible Rosicrzician Order, \"There is a true Rosicrucian Order. If you are duly and truly prepared, you will undoubtedly make contact. . . in due season.. . I do not condemn pretenders. They condemn themselves.\" Llewellyn Publications and Carl L. Weschcke are to be congratulated on this special presentation of the first paperback edition of this significant work. That the original pagination has been maintained for purposes of reference and future research is only one example that points to the long standing commitment of Llewellyn to high standards and impeccable quality. Many people have played an invaluable and special role in my life since 1980, and I would like to acknowl- edge some of them now. The contributing editors to this edition: Anupassana, George Wilson, and Hal Sundt have taken immense time and responsibility for making this an unparalleled edition of critical and extended material. Adam For- rest has been my faithful Golden Dawn companion and guide, and Chic Cicero has achieved attainments in actualizing Golden Dawn symbolism seldom possi- ble. I also wish to thank Stephan Hoeller, for the first Light, Don Kraig for stim- ulating conversation and ideas, and my dear friends in New Mexico for bringing me closer to the Feminine. Finally, I wish to heartfully thank Richard Auger Ph.D. for his patient participation in my own perilous \"Night Sea Journey.\" When Regardie finished his introduction to the original edition, he con- cluded with the words that his work was done.

Cris Monnastre Corpus Christi Los Angeles, 1986 xxv"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION Volume I . It would be trite to say that life is a strange, wonderful and mysterious process. But it is! In his Triumphal Chariot of Antimony, the alchemist Basil Valentine describes his antimony as a deadly poison on the one hand, yet, when purified alchemically, as a potent medicament on the other. Apparently this Golden Dawn material has to be de- scribed in rather the same way-reminding me of an old adage concerning money. It passes ihrough the lives of an infinite number of people to change their lives catalyti- cally, but in the process always remaining untouched itself. At the same time, it recalls to mind several letters that were received years ago following the publication of the first of the four volumes in the original edition. Any- one would have thought, judging from the tone of some of these letters, that I had become exalted to the throne of God Almighty himself. Even a few came from active Order members scattered in various parts of the world, corroborating many of the critical allegations made earlier in My Rosicrucian Adventure. Though the latter book was published independently of The Golden Dawn, it was originally written to serve as an introduction to the whole body of Order teaching. On the other hand, there was a long letter from the late Captain J. Langford Gar- stin, under his Order sacramental name, chiding me severely for publishing the se- cret teachings of the Order, and asking me in the future never again to refer to the Order by name. And, strangely enough, one of the last letters received from Aleister Crowley before we became estranged (as described in The Eye in the Triangle) stated two things. First, in connection with my statement that one of the officiating officers had hurried through an initiatory ritualas though reading a batch of grocery bills-he remarked that I should have rudely told him to go to Jericho, or words to that effect. And secondly, relative to the material itself, he roundly scolded me, stating I had absolutely no right whatsoever to have published this material and to have broken my sacred obligation to secrecy. Many decades earlier, he had published these same Order teachings in the Equinox-only under direct command from the Secret Chiefs of the Order, at least that was his claim. If Aleister Crowley disapproved of my action, I have to be egostistical enough to assume that my editorial job was far better than his own with his amanuensis of that time, Captain J. F. C. Fuller. My version ceftainly was more orderly, more adherent to the letter of the Order system, and unmarred by too many extraneous comments and some hideous garbling. So there we are. Some approved of the publication of these books; a very few dis- approved. That's all there is to it. Whatever I have done in the past, has been done. I have, basically, no regrets. Perhaps the only fleeting or hesitant regret that I do have is a doubt as to whether publication has actually done much good, whether students at large were able to utiliie the system in the manner I had hoped for. This is a serious doubt; oral instruction is invaluable, and should be given only under the guidance of a teacher, or within the framework of an Order. The past two or three decades have revealed something else as a definite disad- vantage. The average student approaching The Golden Dawn has simply been over- whelmed by the sheer weight and wealth of original teaching material. As he glances through the large four-volume set, understanding but little of it, he becomes alto- 1"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"2 The Golden Dawn gether confused, thrust headlong into despair, and does not pause long enough to study the system in small sections until he does discover its intent and purpose. In the Order-or any occult organization for that matter-no student was ever bombarded with too much study material at the beginning. He is spoonfed small doses, as it were, monthly. Some critics regard this procedure as a \"come on,\" as bait merely to keep the student paying his monthly dues for long periods of time. In some instances, this ma)- well be true. On the contrary, it is sometimes given in this forni, I am sure, so that the student can study a little of it at a time, transmuting it into personal property by assimilating it piecemeal into his own psychic structure. Then more teaching was assigned, and so on. Periodically an examination, oral and written, was given, not to grade the student in conventional terms, nor to put him on the spot, but to ascertain whether or not he had grasped and understood the preceding lessons. This procedure is not possible in a book like The Golden Dawn. Of course it could have been re-written in lesson form with the above intent in mind, cautioning the stu- dent not to proceed until he had thoroughly grasped each segment of the work. But it was not done that way. Under these circumstances, therefore, it remains only for the intelligent student to work out his own study technique or regimen. If he is not astute enough to perceive the practicality or necessity of the abov~, then quite evidently he is not intelligent enough to deal with the material itself, and it should not be in his possession at all. This is the counsel I would give to the serious student of the Great Work. Study the contents of the first two volumes, now combined to form a single book, as if you were a member of an Order, and were receiving a monthly monogram or lesson from headquarters. Glance through all the material once or twice just to get the drift of it, and then allocate to yourself a few pages only at a time. If these pages are not clear at first, which is more than likely, then I would strongly suggest supplementing them with additional reading. First of all, I would recommend an oldbook of mine, The Garden of Pomegranates. This is a simple outline of the Qabalah comprising the backbone of the Order philosophy. It has been out of print for several years. Thanks to Llewellyn Publications it is on its way back into cir- culation once more in a new edition. It should prove a useful guide through the initial knowledge lectures of the Order as given in volume one of The Golden Dawn. In particular, two Order papers in this volume are supremely important docu- ments. They are The Path of the Chameleon (p. 95) which deals comprehensively with the Tree of Life, and another one entitled The Microcosm (p. 100). It is my suggestion that they should be studied over and over again, if necessary using The Garden of Pomegranates as a companion and as an aid to simplification. Sometimes the language of S. LiddellMacGregor Mathers, who apparently was the author of these papers, was not as simple as it might have been. Be that as it may, nothing should deter the serious student frbm extracting the last drop of intellectual nutriment from these papers. There is also the new edition of The Tree of Life (Samuel Weiser, New York, 1968), which provides an elementary introduction to magical procedures, the heart and core of the practical work of the Order. With these two simple books, and only a few pages of The Golden Dawn handled at any single time, most of the complex problems should be eliminated. Such a course is analogous to the procedure used in driving across the country, say from Los Angeles to New York City, approximately three thousand miles. This is a considerable distance. But by setting intermediate goals and marking them on your road maps the journey is made much easier. Then each day one aims not for New York but for the next town or city, perhaps three or four hundred miles from your pres- ent stop. In this way, the limited objective is easily reached without the driver being overwhelmed by the enormity of the distance to his final goal, New York City."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introduction 3 Much the same progress should be followed here where the study material is concerned. Make sure you allow enough time for this initial material to be absorbed before you press onward. More haste means less speed. Take your time. There is no hurry. In many such cliches, there is a profound wisdom. In the opening passages of the very first initiatory ritual of the Order is found the re- markable phrase \"By names and images are all powers awakened and reawakened.\" This simple phrase sets the stage, as it were, for all subsequent Order teaching. In effect it reveals the essential fact involved in all practical magical work. Most of the later instructions merely elaborate the necessity for the correct vibration of the highest Divine Names, and the building up in the imagination of pictures of one kind or another. In all of the major rituals, and in all such instructions as those on talismans and telesmatic images, the basic factors are those mentioned in the very simple phrase given above. Never let it be forgotten, when apparently submerged in a mass of complicated attributions and technical details, that the essence of magic is simple. So simple in fact, that a vast'amount of self-discipline and training is required to make it effective. The counsel given in the Portal document (p. 175 of volume One), preparing the student for the Adept grade is of the greatest importance here. It should be read, reread, and then studied some more. One of the items referred to for the first time in this Portal document is \"building the Tree of Life in the aura.\" I have found this rudimentary scheme so useful and so important in my own growth and development that it came to have tremendous significance in my own daily practice. There is rarely a time when I permit myself to fall asleep at night without \"lighting the lamp above my head\", as I personally de- scribe for myself the formulation of Kether. This powerfulmagical technique is vital and I cannot recommend if too highly. I have elaborated this rudimentary outline considerably in a simple little manual I wrote over thirty years ago entitled The Art of True Healing. It should also prove useful to the student just getting the feel of these magico- mystical methods. This particular Portal document is one of the most practical of all in The Golden Dawn curriculum. The reader should study it almost beyond all else, applying its recommendations in his efforts to integrate The Golden Dawn teachings into his life and mind. Its counsel is invaluable. If only the students who had written to me to com- plain of the overwhelming quantity and quality of teaching, had first heeded its instructions and counsel, their opinion might have been different. It is a sensible and rational approach to a vast subject with almost infinite ramifications. Once this counsel has been well heeded, and closely adhered to, then the student could start dealing with the simplest elements of ritual and ceremonial procedures. An attempt to handle the complex initiatory rituals of the Grades without proper preparation and guidance, can only end in failure. Much the same is true of the com- plicated ceremonies described in the third volume. Leave them severely alone until you have studied them sufficiently to know what you are doing. This may take con- siderable time. Start off first with what is known as the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram (p. 106, Volume I). This is a simple procedure. Follow the written instructions to the letter-literally, and then the ritual itself will present no difficulties. Problems only arise when the student propels himself in to these activities without proper study and preparation. Stay with this simple ritual until you become expert. Then begin to prac- tice what should be done with the imagination as you make the appropriate gestures with your outstretched arm (without a magical weapon-that comes later), and the appropriate movements around your own axis or around the room where you work. Do not leave the topic until absolute perfection has been obtained, else you may be obliged to return and master it before you can proceed to more advanced matters."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"4 The Golden Dawn Then experiment with the simple Rose-Cross Ritual (p. 46 of Volume 111). Though this ritual is described in a later volume than the two now under discussion, it could well be taken out of context and mastered at the same time as the Pentagram Ritual. This ritual of the Rose-Cross teaches the formulation of the symbol in the four corners of the room, as well as above and below the axis where you stand. It results in surrounding yourself with the traditional symbol. It will provide basic discipline in at least three important matters: 1. Tracing geometrical figures with the hand. 2. Imagining them clearly in your mind. 3. Vibrating the appropriate names. A simple instruction on the latter process is to be found in the Portal paper already mentioned, as well as in several other very important documents scattered through the remaining volumes. Study could be supplemented by consulting another old book of mine TheMiddle Pillar (Llewellyn Publications, St. Paul, 1970), which sum- marizes most of the Order teachings on this topic. The meditations given in Volume I are relatively simple, though some of the de- scriptive material attached to them are not likely to be applicable to the beginner. In addition to these, or else as an alternative, I would like to recommend a series of meditations or psychophysical exercises which could do much to prepare the student in a more dynamic way for this phase of things. They are to be found in a little book recently written by me called Twelve Steps to Spiritual Enlightenment (Sangreal Founda- tion, Texas, 1969). It should prove useful in this connection. It might also be worthwhile for the student really to start studying the initiatory rituals, beginning naturally with the 0 = 0 or ~eo~h~te degree. ~~ak, I would counsel patience. Do not hurrv. Read the ritual manv times in order to clearly understand its kportance, its themkof bringing the candihate to the Light, and what is involved in the various movements of the officers. Only when thoroughly conversant with these ideas, should the student attempt to place himself in his imagination within the ritualistic movements themselves. This should be done in segments, a little at a time, until he feels at ease practicing the ritualistic movements inhis imagination. The same type of procedure should be followed with each of the following elemental initia- tions. Naturally, this involves a great deal of effort and time, and should be extended over many weeks or months. Hurrying through it in order to get to the next grade will only defeat your own purpose, and you will derive next to nothing from what you do. Again and again, it has to be stated-Make haste slowly! Don't hurry. Some of the speeches made by various officers during the ceremonies are magnificent and are well worth memorizing. The adoration that is a constant through all the rituals and which is of Gnostic origin is certainly one of these: Holy art thou, Lord of the Universe. Holy art thou, whom Nature hath not formed. Holy art thou, the Vast and the Mighty One. Lord of the Light and the Darkness. Another lovely passage which deserves a place in all of one's private devotions and spiritual exercises is this one: Glory be to Thee, Father of the Undying. For thy Glory flows out rejoicing to the ends of the earth. Perhaps one of the most important of these passages to be memorized, and which is unequivocally at the core of all the Qabalistic teaching in the Order is the excerpt from the Neophyte ritual: Unbalanced Power is the ebbing away of life."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Introduction Unbalanced Mercy is weakness and the fading out of the Will. Unbalanced Severity is cruelty and the barrenness of Mind. A whole textbook could be elaborated on this one simple piece of teaching. Since the Order system is replete with such choice gems, it is clear that volumes would be required to elaborate the beauty and full meaning of its teaching. Still another dynamic passage which could be incorporated into one's daily practice of the Middle Pillar technique: I come in the power of the Light. I come in the Light of Wisdom. I come in the Mercy of the Light. The Light hath healing in its Wings! All of these are beautiful and their eloquence lingers with deep feeling in my memory. In one's private spiritual work, a place could be found for many of them. As one progresses in the Path of Light, they take on more significance and radiance, tending to evoke higher states of consciousness. I should like to add a little more to the general counsel of this all-important Por- tal document If the student has not recentlv brushed uv on his or her anatomv and physiology, the essentials df which are absilutely necessary parts of the intellGctua1 armamentarium of a well-educated verson. I should like to recommend an excellent manual which has impressed me kd which should answer the average need rather well. It is Logan Clendenning's The Hzi~nan Body. It once appeared in a paperback edition, which was rapidly sold out. I am hoping it will soon be reprinted in a simi- lar edition. The following books are recommended in lieu of those mentioned in the text. From my viewpoint, they are more up-to-date and therefore more useful. For a general outline of psychological functioning, I would suggest Psychology by Norman MUM (Houghton Mifflin, Boston). On the dynamic side, An Elemen- tary Textbook of Psychoanalysis by Charles Brenner (Anchor Books, New York, 1957) is superb, to be followed by Man and His Symbols edited by Carl G. Jung (Doubleday, New York, 1964). The Function of the Orgasm by Wilhelm Reich (Orgone Institute Press, New York, 1942) is a must. A cheaper paperback edition has appeared since that date. I consider it a necessity, because, without intending to do so, Reich has succeeded in building a bridge between the modem psychologies and occultism. Were he alive, he would have a fit to learn of this interpretation-but fit or no fit, it is still a fact. What he had to say, and the therapeutic method he developed and called vege- totherapy, have been found of inestimable value in my life, and the two hundred hours of therapy I had years ago comprise an experience that today, in retrospect, I would not be without. With these materials in mind, the serious student might well be persuaded, as I was once, to enter psychotherapy. It is of small consequence what analyt- ical school he selects. All are useful. All provide help for the student in his search for the Light, and serve as excellent preparation for the serious disci- pline of Magic and self-knowledge. Where the divinatory techniques are concerned, the counsel given in the Portal paper under consideration is still valid. Newer and better books on astrology have been published since that Portal paper was first written. Dane Rudhyais Astrology of Personalifj is an excellent textbook for the inquisitive student. The author regards astrology as the \"algebra of life,\" which gives meaningful relationships to the events of life. A more comprehensive but less philosophical text is the A to Z Horoscope Maker and Delineator by Llewellyn George (Llewellyn Publications, St. Paul). These two should be studied together. With regard to alchemy, while some of the basic definitions of the so-called"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"6 The Golden Dawn Knowledge lectures are accurate enough so far as generalizations go, they may be of small value when examining classical spagyric texts. The later work of the Order is also surprisingly vague on alchemy, and contributes little to clarify understanding. Some extraneous help is obviously required on this topic. I strongly recommend The Alchemist's Handbook by Frater Albertus (Paracelsus Research Society, Salt Lake City, 1964). While lacking in literary style, it is nevertheless one of the most complete introductions to alchemy I have ever found, providing as it does, an ABC of practical instruction. I know of no other that even attempts this task. The Order instructions on Geomancy are in the fourth volume of the original edition (Volume I1 of this new one). I mention it here, albeit prematurely, because the Portal paper brings up the topic. There is no equivalent instruction elsewhere. I grew to like this as a divinatory method, using and experimenting with it extensively for several years. It can be operated swiftly and easily to get a direct \"yes\"or \"no\"answer, though a great many more details can be elicited with but little application and study. In spite of A. E. Waite's stuffiness and turgidity, his short method of Tarot divina- tion using a ten card layout, as described towards the end of his bookA Pictorial Key to the Tarot (University Books, New York), is a useful, simple and direct method. It can and should, of course, be supplemented by some of the brief Order definitions as laid down in the second volume of this edition. Practice will demonstrate its value. The unsuspecting student will rapidly discover his intuition and psychic faculties will undergo a marked stimulation and development bv the use of these methods. 1Gofar as the Portal document sugge& the s&dent reflect on \"words and the power of words,\" I am reminded of something I have long wanted to say, but some- how neglected. I would like strongly to recommend The Miracle of Language by Charlton Laird (Premier Books, New York, 1953), a superb piece of writing, with deep insight and humor, relative to the origins of our own language. And secondly, the topic of general semantics is an absolute necessityfor the serious student on the Path. Language in Action by S. I. Hayakawa (Harcourt Brace, New York, 1939) is a lucid, insightful introduction to a difficult subject, which should be followed by People in Quandaries by Wendell Johnson (Harper, New York, 1946). Few mystics or occult teachers have taken general semantics to their bosoms. Most of them, I fancy, know nothing about the subject. A few hold it in disdain, perhaps out of fear. With considerable pleasure, I urge every student to read TheProb- lem of Good and Evil or The Chrisfos by Vitvan (School of the Natural Order, Baker, Nevada). Both of these books attempt to correlate the ancient wisdom both of the East and the West with the techniques ofcount ~orz~bski who developed general seman- tics. Reading this literature should considerablv broaden the mental and spiritual horizons of&e sincere and serious student. It hl also help him keep a le&l head where the occult jungle is concerned, so that he will not fall prey to the vast mass of fantasy and hysteria which have sadly infiltrated this field. If it appears that in dealing with this opening volume of The Golden Dawn I have done little else than recommend a wide selection of books, I had a purpose in so doing. Those books suggested are excellent additions to the basic requisites of a sound occult library. Secondly, they may succeed in training the would-be mystic and student of magic to be skeptical, well-informed, and intuitive all at the same time. Thirdly, they will go far towards disciplining his mind, enabling him to manage more intelligently this mass of material subsumed under the words The Golden Dawn. Such a preparation is not easily come by, and for that reason should not be lightly treated. November 25,1968 ISRAEL REGARDIE"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Introduction 7 NOTE TO THIRD EDITION As a final word I should like to add that the Introduction written for the original edition is still important, in my estimation. It should certainly be stud- ied by the new student. When stimulated by enquiries from correspondents in various countries all over the world, I have often returned to it myself, reading it with renewed interest as though written by other than myself long ago. Com- posed under trying circumstances, it succeeded in conveying nonetheless the essential facts surrounding the history and noble teaching of the Order. I do not think the Order will have good reason for disowning it, should this book survive and be read a century or two from today. It emphases the funda- mental theme of Order teaching-\"Long hast thou dwelt in darkness. Quit the Night and seek the Day.\" I pray this will never be forsaken. November 14,1969 INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION Volume II This second volume (comprising Volumes I11 and IV of the first edition) should present little problem to the student who has scrupulously followed the counsel detailed in the Introduction to the first volume (Volumes I and I1 of the first edi- tion). Exactly the same procedure should be followed where this particular vol- ume is concerned as with the first. These volumes are nothing less than an ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PRACTICAL OCCULTISM, and the wise student will regard them as absolutely that, and per- haps a good deal more. Most phases of the ancient knowledge are explored and described in full in one document or another. They need to be read and studied and practiced over a long period of time for their usefulness fully to be realized. An encyclopedia should be handled with loving care; how much more so then, an encyclopedia which elaborates so many hitherto obscure aspects of the secret knowledge? \"Before all things are the Chaos, the Darkness and the Gates of the Land of the Night.\"Thus runs one excerpt from a ritual in this particular volume. It is partic- ularly apt. All the ritual workings and descriptions of the magical rubrics to be employed will at first appear utterly chaotic and without meaning. Only with consistent effort and a well-laid out plan of study and practice will this chaos gradually lift to be replaced by enlightenment, order, and meaning. \"After the formless and the Void and the Darkness, then cometh the knowl- edge of the Light'! Let the student therefore give himself ample time to study casually at first this next volume-remembering that it contains the last two volumes of the old edi- tion, replete with the most illuminating material conceivable, which requires to be understood thoroughly. Even after the lapse of forty years, when I first became aware of this teaching through Aleister Crowley's several volumes of The Equinox, I still thrill inwardly with spiritual excitement as I glance through the volumes to be commented on. I can wish no less for the sincere student who is willing to devote time and effort to comprehending the nature of this magical system. The first two documents that should be thoroughly studied are the descrip- tions of the usages of the Pentagram and Hexagram. The language is unneces- sarily archaic, and one of the aids to comprehension that I would suggest is this: After reading it many, many times so as to be quite sure that the contents are understood, try to rewrite the instructions in simple every-day English. This is not as difficult as it sounds. The benefit to be derived from this is an increase in understanding far greater than anything you would initially expect."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"8 The Golden Dawn In the earlier volume, there was a lesser forin of Pentagram ritual given for daily usage, together with the simple Rose-Cross ritual. If the student has fol- lowed this recommendation, by the time he gets to studying this present volume, he should be quite expert in tracing these lineal figures. All that is required now is a slight expansion of his already existent knowledge, to incorporate the new but basic data to be found in these two documents. The rewriting that the student will do is to enable him to omit all extraneous and unnecessary verbiage, leaving the essence of the instruction uncomplicated and simple. It will be this simple material which needs to be assimilated to the previously learned data. Continuing with the study of the rituals, let the student study the beautiful simplicity of the construction of such rituals as are intended for the consecration of the various weapons or instruments that are to be used. There is no need to rush headlong into making the instruments. Delay this process for a while until the meaning of the ceremonies is assimilated into the psyche. Again, I would sug- gest that the students select a simple consecration ceremony, such as that for the Lotus Wand, and analyze it with as much attention and care as he would have done the Neophyte Ritual in the preceding volume. Apart from all else, it lays down the simplest possible forms or principles upon which ceremonies should be constructed. Though the manufacture of the elemental weapons is a simple enough procedure, although a time-consuming one, these should be postponed until all the conseaation ceremonies have been studied closely enough to have yielded their ultimate secrets. There are far more complicated rituals depicted in Volume I11 (old edition) but these particular shorter consecration ceremonies take the prize for simplicity, sincerity and efficacy. I was particularly impressed by the skill and ingenuity involved in the writ- ing, for example, of the consecration ceremony for the four elemental weapons. Its virtuosity renders it altogether unique. These matters make one ponder anew the origins of The Golden Dawn and its teachings. What McGregor Mather has written and published is of course good; of this there is little question. But not one of three published works-The Kabbalah Unveiled, The Greater Key of King Solomon, and The Sacred Magic of Abramelin- bears the intrinsic stamp of genius or uniqueness. Nothing that Dr. William Wynn Westcott wrote is exempt from the same criticism. His book on the Kaballah is simple, clear and informative-but it bears no resemblance to the peculiar quality or character of the Golden Dawn documents which I suggest contain the hallmarks of genius. Whoever was the originator of the Golden Dawn system left the mark both of genius and uniqueness on every phase of the work. He is still unknown- he, or a line of continental Rosicrucian Adepts, or? . . . we do not know! Volume 111 (of the first edition) contains the 2-2 document, which the stu- dent will recognize as being a finely structured analysis of the Neophyte Ritual, breaking it down into several movements and sections. This then serves as the basis for the construction of several elaborate types of ceremonies. These will be altogether without meaning until and unless the students have thoroughly stud- ied the Neophyte Ritual. Nor will it convey much if he has neglected to master the basic principles of the Qabalah, particularly the dynamics involved in Tetra- grammaton, the four-lettered Nameand how, by the descent of the Divine Fire, it becomes converted into the Pentagrammaton. With a display of great erudition, even the letter Shin representing the divine fire becomes classified according to the Three Mother letters, (Aleph, Mem, Shin-Air, Water, and Fire), each serving as the basis of a distinct type of ritual. This document is one of the intrinsic signs of the genius of the G. D. I have been impressed by its magnificence as well as practicality for nearly forty years, when I first discovered it in Equinox 3. Time has not diminished the lustre, nor familiarity its mark of uniqueness. Z-1 is an important paper descriptive of the Neophyte Ritual, given to the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Introduction 9 newly inducted Adeptus Minor for whom it discloses a depth of symbolism and a wealth of practical formulae he could never have previously thought possible. The beginner who glances through this grade initiation may perceive very little in it, until he studies this particular document. It explains the meaning and purpose of the manifold symbols employed, the regalia worn by the officers, and the various move- ments made by the offxiants. A companion document 2-3 explains the symbolism of the admission of the Candidate. I still find this an extremely interesting document that reveals level upon level of insight, no matter how many years elapse between readings. An occasional perusal of its material will prevent the student from taking a prosaic attitude towards this and other initiatory rituals. Both of these papers are among the most important of all Order documents, since so many general magical formulae are there described. They pertain to a great many magical matters, other than initiation. As an aside, for the serious student who is interested in making comparisons and drawing deductions, I recommend a slim volume entltled The Ceremony oflnitiation by W. L. Wilmshurst, an eminent British Freemason. This little volume, though privately printed in 1953, is available to the general public, being obtainable through J. M. Wat- kins, London. It purports to be an analysis and commentary onMasonic initiations. Its similarity to the 2-2 document is startling, though the latter is of course written on a much deeper level than its Masonic equivalent, and is esoterically slanted. But without knowing anything about Masonry, the student could read this volume side by side with 2-2, and develop a very clear idea of the nature of Masonic initiation Other papers in this final volume are still no less valuable than the day they were first published. Those on clairvoyance, astral projection, and skrying are still the most complete instructions on these subject yet written. I doubt if much can be added to them, or whether they can be improved upon. Even a great deal of Aleister Crowley's later magical writing, which is always excellent, does not elaborate very much more on some of this basic Golden Dawn magical teaching. The material in the 4th Volume (first edition) or the last half of this present Volume I1 (second edition) is of maximum importance. Here are to be found the ground rules as it were governing magic in all of its many branches. Would you know what a talisman is? And how it is constructed? The necessary information is to be found here. Sigils-what they are, and how made, are also elucidated in this volume. Full instruction in all such matters is given in several documents republished in this volume. There is no other text which is as explicit. Francis Barrett's The Magus and Henry Cornelius Agrippa's far older work on magical philosophy give the si@s derived from the magic squares, but neither is particularly explicit in description, etc. This deficiency is repaired in these G. D. manuscripts. Is it divination that interests you? The Order method of Tarot reading is second to none. In the first place, the description of the cards themselves is unique. From these descriptions the enterprising student could draw or paint a pack for himself. Whether he produces a finely polished, artistic pack or a set of crude amateurish drawings as I have, makes no difference. The effort alone will have made strong multi-sensory impressions on his psyche. These will be drawn upon, consciously or unconsciously, when divining. ~urthermore, some of the character descriptions given of the Court cards give one pause. These are evidently not the work of a mere gypsy fortune teller. They be- tray sound psychological insights of an unusually penetrating nature, and many a professional writer has drawn on them in one way or another. I know at least a couple of books which have used them at great length, though without acknowledgement, but in this instance that does not mean very much. Some abstruse teaching relative to the Tarot and other germane matters is scat-"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"10 The Golden Dawn tered through several of these Order documents. One matter which I have never seen taken up by astrological writers is that concerning starting the Zodiac with the Star Regulus in Leo. The teaching emphasizes that were this done, the constellations and the signs would coincide. \"Within the Zodiac,\" wrote Louis MacNiece in his book Astrology, \"there are twelve constellations.. . These bear the same names as the twelve signs used by the astrologers, but astrologically they have nothing to do with the case. If you are told that the Sun was in that particular sign when you were born between March 31 and April 30-this does not mean that you were born under the actual group of stars &own as Aries. Once upon a time de Sun was (or appeared to be) amAg tgat goup at that time of vear, but he is not there now, thanks to what is known as the1~recession of the equinoies' (a very slow shift in the sky as observed from theearth, that takes 25,800 years to come full circle). The signs that most modem astrologers deal with are 12 exactly equal sections of the total circle of the Zodiac. Each section measures 30\" and it makes no difference what fixed stars are contained in it. \"This disconcerting fact provides ready ammunition for opponents of astrology ,, ... As all students of the subject know, due to the precession of the Equinoxes, the signs and the constellations are now separated by as much as a whole sign. This has led to two distinct schools in astrology, the Tropical and the Sidereal. The adoption of the Order recommendation, could lead to some closing of the distance between these two approaches. One of the things that slightly puzzles me occasionally is the frequency with which the almost wholly untutored beginner invariably selects the Enochian system to start with. He is intrigued by its mystery and its complexity. It is the most com- plicated of the Order sub-systems, and really is used as the basis for synthesizing all the previously given knowledge of the Order. Qabalah, Tarot, Geomancy, skrymg, ritual magic, etc. are all drawn together and worked up into a single majestic system. Therefore to appreciate it, one must have acquired a good working knowledge of all the partial systems. As such, it is the province of the seasoned veteran in occult mat- ters, of the mature well-informed student, certainly not the tyro. In Crowley's A.A. (which he founded on what he thought and hoped were the ashes of the G.D.), this kind of selection would not altogether have been frowned on. In fact, one of the cardinal rules which was never to have been abrogated, was that the Probationer should personally select from all that he has read, anything that per- sonally appeals to him. And for one year he was required to do whatever practices his own ingenium selected. But the A.A. is not the GoldenDawn, even though it has its roots deeply buried in the fertile soil that was prepared by Mathers and Westcott. Nor is the G.D. completely dead. I am glad to hear periodically that there is a Temple here and there which still continues to use the time-honored methods. Under these circumstances, someone has to try and drum some rationality into the beginning student whose enthusiasm and fanaticism may well run away with him. For this reason, I suggest the Enochian system-rich, suggestive and powerful that it is-be left alone until a great deal of prior knowledge and magical experience be obtained. The Adeptus Minor obligation contains the following clause, which is the quin- tessence of the entire Golden Dawn magical work: I further promise and swear that with the Divine Permission I will, from this day forw&d, apply myself to the Great Work-which is, to purify and exalt mv Spiritual Nature so that with the Divine Aid I mav at length attain to be more thkAhuman, and thus gradually raise and unite kiyselfvto my Higher and Divine Genius, and that in this event I will not abuse the great power entrusted to me."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Introduction 11 Many years after Crowley had become exposed to this obligation, and had labored hard on the road to magical accomplishment, he took this obligation and trans- lated it as seeking and acquiring the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guard- ian Angel. In the use of this archaic language, he merely followed McGregor Mathers who had translated into English The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage, where this phrase was first used. As the Tiphareth clause of the obligation, it is the most important one of all the ten clauses. And in one way or another, its fulfillment is pointed to in nearly every important phase of the Order work. Regardless of which phase you may think of- skrying in the spirit-vision, ceremonial magic, formation of telesmatic images, etc.- this one goal is in the background, giving meaning and substance to all else. No matter, then, what aspect of the work the student devotes himself to, he should never lose sight of this one clause, and the goal to which it refers. One particular passage in 2-2 found immediately after its opening confirms this notion in a specially powerful way. Describing the temple in reference to the Sephiroth, it says: The Temple as arranged in the Neophyte Grade of the Order of the Golden Dawn in the Outer, is placed looking towards the YH or YHVH in Malkuth in Assiah. That is, as Y and H answer unto the Sephiroth Chokmah and Binah in the Tree, (and unto Abba and Aima, through whose knowledge alone that of Kether may be obtained) even so, the Sacred Rites of the Temple may gradually, as it were, in spiteof himself, lead the Neophyte unto the knowledge of his Higher Self. (Italics mine.) There are several other passages confirmatory of this important set of ideas. One of them relates to the Hierophants' wand which \"represents him as touching thereby the Divine Light of Kether and attracting through the Middle Pillar to Malkuth.\" Another concerns the so-called Banner of the East which \"affirms the mode of action employed by the Divine Light in its operation by the Forces of Nature. Upon it is the symbol of the Macrocosm so colored as to affirm the action of the Fire of the Spirit through the Waters of Creationunder the harmony of the Golden Cross of the Recon- ciler . . . The whole represents the ascent of the Initiate into Perfect Knowledge of the Light. \" (Italics mine.) In the Adeptus Minor Ritual is to be found the analysis of the so-called keyword 1.N.RI. It is found in several places thereafter; its very frequency should make the stu- dent suspect its importance. Few, however, take time out to apply basic Qabalistic and magical principles to elucidate its meaning. So in order to convey some idea of elementary meanings, I have decided to show the student what can be done with these four English letters LN.R.1. They are, of course, the initials of a Latin phrase once placed by the Romans at the head of the Cross representing the phrase \"Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.\" Several other theological meanings to these letters have been given at different periods in history by various groups of people and scholars. For example, the medieval alchemists suggested that I.N.R.I. meant \"Igne Natura Renovatur Integra.\" \"The whole of Nathre is renewed by Fire.\" Another example of about the same period elaborated the four letters to \"Igne Nitrum Raris Invenitum,\" translated as \"shining (or glittering) is rarely found in fire.\" The Jesuits in their day interpreted it as \"Justum Necare Regis ImpiusU-'lt is just to kill an impious king.\" J.S.M. Ward in his book Freemasonry and the Ancient Gods gives yet another example:"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The Golden Dawn I. Yam= Water N. Nour =Fie R. Ruach= Air I. Yebeshas = Earth Thus the four letters may be used as Hebrew initials of the four ancient ele- ments. In the nineteenth century when the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn came to be formed, these letters were picked up and integrated into the complex structure of the Order symbolism. To understand the interpretation used by the Order, we need only the most superficial knowledge of the basic attributions given in the Sepher Yetzirah, the Tarot pack of cards, a smattering of Gnosticism and astrology. The first gesture is to convert the four letters into their Hebrew equivalents and then to direct Yetziratic attributions, as follows: I. = Yod = Virgo N. = Nun = Scorpio R = Resh = Sun I. = Yod = Virgo The final 'T', being repetitious, is dropped, only to be picked up again in a later place in order to extend the significance of the meanings derived from the analysis. This breakdown, though not getting us very far, is nonetheless highly sugges- tive. Elementary astrology will extend the meaning a little. Virgo represents the virginal sign of nature itself. Scorpio is the sign of death and transformation; sex is involved here as well. Sol, the Sun, is the source of light and life to all on earth; it is the centre of our solar system. All the so-called resurrection gods are known to be solar connected. The Sun was thought to die every winter when vegetation perished and the earth became cold and barren. Every Spring, when the Sun returned, green life was restored to the Earth. In various of the grade rituals as well as the elementary knowledge lectures of the Order, we find the following which we can add to the data already obtained: Virgo=Isis-who was Nature, the Mother of all things. Scorpio=Apophis-death, the destroyer. Sol=Osiris-slain and risen, the Egyptian resurrection and vegetative God. Here we now begin to get a definite sequence of ideas that proves somewhat meaningful. The simplicity of a natural state of affairs in, shall we say, the Garden of Eden representing the springtime of mankind, is shattered by the intrusion of the knowledge of Good and Evil, sexual perception. This is due to the intervention of the destroyer Apophis, the Red Dragon, or Lucifer, the Lightbearer, who changed all things-by illuminating all things. Thus the Fall-as well as the Fall of the year. This is succeeded by the advent of Osiris the resurrection God who is quoted as stating: \"This is my body, which I destroy in order that it may be renewed.\"He is the symbolic prototype of the perfected solar Man, who suffered through earthly experience, was glorified by trial, was betrayed and killed, and then rose again to renew all things. The final analysis of the keyword sums up the formula with the initials Isis, Apophis, Osiris=IAO, the supreme God of the Gnostics. (IAO is pronounced ee- ah-oh!) Since the Sun is the giver of life and light, the formula must refer to Light as the redeemer. The Order was predicated on the age-old process of bringing Light to the natural man. In other words, it taught a psycho-spiritual technique leading to illu- mination, to enlightenment. In this connection, one should always remember those beautiful versicles about the Light in the opening chapter of the Gospel according to St. John. In the very first or Neophyte Ritual of the Golden Dawn, the candidate is startled"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Introduction 13 to hear the strangely-worded invocation \"Khabs Am Pekht. Konx om Pax. Light in Extension.\" In other words, may you too receive the benediction of the Light, and undergo the mystical experience, the goal of all our work. 'The enlightenment by a ray of the divine light which transforms the psychic nature of many may be an article of faith,\" says Hans Jonas in his excellent book The Gnostic Religion, \"but it may also be an experience . . . Annihilation and deification of the person are fused in the spiritual ecstasis which purports to experience the immediate presence of the acosmic essence. \"In the gnostic context, this transfiguring face-to-face experience is Gnosis in the most exalted sense of the term, since it is knowledge of the unknowable.. . The mysti- calgnosis theou-direct beholding of the divine reality-is itself an earnest of the con- summation to come. It is transcendence become immanent; and although prepared for by human acts of self-modification which induce the proper disposition, the event itself is one of divine activity and grace. It is this as much a 'being known'by God as a 'knowing' him, and in this ultimate mutuality the 'gnosis' is beyond the terms of 'knowledge' properly speaking . . .\" Since this is the basic theme recurrent through all the Golden Dawn rituals and teaching, we would expect to find it repeated and expanded in the analysis of the Keyword of the Adeptus Minor grade. And of course it is there, clearly defined. The word1Light'is translated into LVX, the Latin word for Light. A series of physi- cal mimes or gestures are employed by the officiants to represent the descent of this Light, as well as to summarize the symbolism of the previous findings. So one Adept or officiant raises his right arm directly in the air above him, while extending his left arm straight outwards (as though to make a left turn when driving a car). This forms by shape the letter 'l: A second Adept raises his arms as though in supplication above his head-the letter 'V'. The third Adept extends his arms outwards forming a Cross. All together finally cross their arms on their chests, forming the letter X: (A single person may of course perform the identical gestures.) The letters formlLVX'which is now interpreted as the 'Light of the Cross'. It is so interpreted because the letters 'INRI' were initially found on the Cross, as well as because LVXmeans Light. Finally the 1etters'LVX'themselves are portions of one type or another of the Cross. A process of repetition is followed in order to synthesize all these variegated ideas and gestures, and to add one more mime to replace the second 'I' that was eliminated for being repetitious. As the 'L' sign is being made, the Adept says: \"The Sign of the Mourning of Isis.\" This expresses the sorrow of Isis on learning that Osiris had been slain by Set or Apophis. As the Y' sign is made, the Adept says: \"The Sign of Apophis and Typhon.\" These are other names for Set, the brother and murderer of Osiris, whose body was so mutilated that only the phallus could be found by Isis who had searched all over crea- tion for him. As the Adept spreads his arms outward from the shoulders forming actively the"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"14 The Golden Dawn Cross, he says: \"The Sign of Osiris Slain.\" Then crossing one arm over the other on the chest, he adds: \"And risen. Isis, Apophis, Osiris, 1.40.\" Thus what started out to be a simple abbreviation of a traditional Latin sentence on the Cross above the head of Jesus, has now evolved by a Qabalistic process of exegesis into a complex series of evocative ideas and symbolic gestures which extend tremendously the root idea. And by knowing these ideas, the gestures may be used practically to aspire to the illumination it suggests. This is the essential value of the sacramental actions. The Rosicrucian equivalent of this formula is found in the Fama Fraternatitas, one of the original three classical Rosicrucian documents. Ex Deo Nascimur. In Jesu Morirnur. Per spiritus sanctus reviviscimus. \"From God are we born. In Christ we die. We are revived by the Holy Spirit.\" Nor is this all. If we take 'LVX' as symbols of Roman numerals, we have 65. This number, therefore, attains the symbolic equivalent of Light, gnosis and illumination. The Adeptus Minor obligation imposed on the candidate during the ritual initia- tion, obligates him, as already demonstrated, to aspire and work and practise so that by enlightenment he may one day \"become more than human.\" This is the Qabalistic philosophy summarized in the statement that the Adept seeks to unite himself to his higher soul or his higher Self, symbolized again in the Hebrew word Adonai. All the above notions therefore are synthesized in this word Adonai, literally translated \"My Lord.\" Its Hebrew letters are: Aleph Daleth Nun Yod 1 + 4 + 50 + 10 = 65. This number is also that of LVXLight. Qabalistically the process enables us toper- ceive a necessary connection between Adonai and the Light, their identity. From here we can move in a variety of exegetical directions. But enough has been said, I hope, to show the student not to accept superficially any phase of the Rituals and the teachings, but to subject them to the most exact- ing scrutiny. November 25,1968 ISRAEL REGARDIE <13> INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST EDITION It was in the year 1890 that Dr. Franz Hartmann, in an endeavour to provide a simple outline of the vicissitudes of what came to be known as the Rosicrucian Order, wrote a book entitled In the Pronaos of the Temple. The central figure of this history was.a monk, Fr. R C.-described in the earliest Rosicrucian manifesto the Fama Fraternifatis as the \"pious, spiritual and highly-illuminated Father . . . It is said that he was a German nobleman who had been educated in a convent, and that long before the time of the Reformation he had made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in company with another brother of this convent, and that while at Damascus they had been initiated by some learned Arabs into the mysteries of the secret science. After remaining three years at Damascus, they went to Fez, in Africa, and there they obtained still more knowledge of ma~c. and of the relations existine between the macrocosm and microcosm. After havini also travelled in Spain, he reLrned to Germany, where he founded a kind of convent called Sancfus Spiritus, and remained there writing his secret science and con- tinuing his studies. He then accepted as his assistints, at first, three, and after- <14> wards, four more monks from the same convent in which he had been educated, and thus founded the first society of the Rosicrucians. They then laid down the results of their science in books, which are said to be still in existence, and in the hands of some Rosicrucians. It is then said that 120 years after his death, the"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Introduction 7 5 entrance to his tomb was discovered. A stair-case led into a subterranean vault, at the door of which was written, Post annos CXX patebo. There was a light burning in the vault, which, however, became extinct as soon as it was approached. The vault had seven sides and seven angles, each side being five feet wide and eight feet high. The upper part represented the firmament, the floor, the earth, and they were laid out in triangles, while each side was divided into ten squares. In the middle was an altar, bearing a brass plate, upon which were engraved the letters,A.C.R.C., and the words Hoc Universi Compendium vivus mihi Sepulchrum fen'. In themidst were four figures sur- rounded by the words, Nequaquam Vacuum. Legis Jugum. Liberfas Evangelii. Dei Gloria Intacta. Below the altar was found the body of Rosenkreuk, intact, and without any signs of putrefaction In his hand was a book of parchment, with golden letters marked on the cover with a T, and at the end was written, Ex Deo nascimur. In Jesus morimur. Per Spiritum Sanctum reviviscimus.\" It was upon this schema and from this original body, to state it briefly, that the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn claimed direct descent. Its history lecture, however, volunteered very few verifiable details as to the historical facts which, from the scholarly point of view, we should be acquainted with-the details for <15> example of the line of descent from, say, 1614 to 1865. Current within the present day Order was the belief that at various dates within the period named, the Order as an organised body of students ceased to exist. Instead, there was an oral continuation of teaching from isolated initiates here, there and everywhere, until more recent times when religious and political conditions did not militate against the advisability of formulating a group. With the institution of a definite body, the original system of grades was re-established, and the systems of Alchemy, the Qabalah andMagic once more were taught to zealous, aspiring Neophytes. As a cloak to their activities, they likewise continued in the early agreement of the Order which was: \"First, that none of them should profess any other thing than to cure the sick, and that gratis. Second, None of the posterity should be constrained to wear one certain kind of habit, but therein to follow the custom of the country. Third, that every year, upon the day C. they should meet together at the house Sanchrs Spiritus, or write the cause of his absence. Fourth, Every Brother should look about for a worthy person who, after his decease, might succeed him. Fifth, The word R C. should be their seal, mark, and character. Sixth, The Fraternity should remain secret one hundred years. With this preliminary account, we may turn to the claims of the Order within the more historical times of the late 19th century, though unfortunately, these claims are no more verifiable and certainly no clearer than those which characterised its beginning. <16> \"The Order of the Golden Dawn,\" narrates the history lecture of that Order, \"is an Hermetic Society whose members are taught the principles of Occult Science and the Magic of Hermes. During the early part of the second half of last century, several eminent Adepti and Chiefs of the Order in France and England died, and their death caused a temporary dormant condition of Temple work. \"Prominent among the Adepti of our Order and of public renown were Eliphas Levi the greatest of modem French magi; Ragon, the author of several books of occult lore; Kenneth M. Mackenzie, author of the famous and learned Masonic Encyclo- paedia; and Frederick Hockley possessed of the power of vision in the crystal, and bhose manuscripts are high$ esteemed.

D. \"The Rosicrucian revival of Mysticism was but a new development of the vastly older wisdom of the Qabalistic Rabbis and of that very ancient secret knowledge, the Magic of the Egyptians, in which the Hebrew Pentateuch tells you that Moses the founder of the Jewish system was learned', that is, in which he had been initiated.\" In a slender but highly informative booklet entitled Data of the History of <17> the Rosicrucians published in 1916 by the late Dr. William Wynn Westcott, we find the following brief statement: \"In 1887 by permission of S.D.A. a con- tinental Rosicrucian Adept, the Isis-Urania Temple of Hermetic Students of the G.D. was formed to give instruction in the mediaeval Occult sciences. Fraters M.E.V. with S.A. and S.RM.D. became the chiefs, and the latter wrote the rituals in modern English from old Rosicrucian mss. (the property of S.A.) supplemented by his own literary researches.\" In these two statements is narrated the beginning of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn - an organisation which has exerted a greater influence on the development of Occultism since its revival in the last quarter of the 19th century than most people can realise. There can be little or no doubt that the Golden Dawn is, or rather was until very recently, the sole depository of magical knowledge, the only Occult Order of any real worth that the West in our time has known. A great many other occult organisations owe what little magical knowledge is theirs to leakages issuing from that Order and from its renegade members. The membership of the Golden Dawn was recruited from every circle, and it was represented by dignified professions as well as by all the arts and sciences, to make but little mention of the trades and business occupations. It included physicians, psy- chologists, clergymen, artists and philosophers. And normal men and women, hum- ble and unknown, from every walk of life have drawn inspiration from its font of wisdom, and undoubtedly many would be happy to recognise and admit the enor- mous debt they owe it. <18> As an orgmation, it preferred after the fashion of its mysterious parent always to shroud itself in an impenetrable cloak of mystery. Its teaching and methods of instruction were stringently guarded by serious penalties attached to the most awe-inspiring obligations in order to ensure that secrecy. So well have these obligations, with but one or two exceptions, been kept that the general public knows next to nothing about the Order, its teaching, or the extent and nature of its mem- bership. Though this book will touch upon the teaching of the Golden Dawn, con- cerning its membership as a whole the writer will have nothing to say, except perhaps to repeat what may already be more or less well-known. For instance, it is common knowledge that W. B. Yeats, Arthur Machen and, if rumour may be trusted, the late Arnold Bennett were at one time among its members, together with a good many other writers and artists. With regard to the names given in Dr. Westcott's statement it is necessary that we bestow to them some little attention in order to unravel, so far as may be possible, the almost inextricable confusion which has characterised every previous effort to detail the history of the Order. M.E.V. was the motto chosen by Dr. William Robert Wood- man, an eminent Freemason of the last century. Sapere Aude and Non Omnis Moriar were the two mottos used by Dr. Westcott, an antiquarian, scholar, and coroner by profession. S. R M. D. or S'Rhiogail Ma Dhream was the motto of S. L. MacGregor Mathers, the translator of The Greater Key of King Solomon, the Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin theme, and TheKabbalah Unveiled, which latter consisted of certain <19> portions of the Zohar prefixed by an introduction of high erudition. He also"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Introduction 17 employed the Latin motto Deo Duce Comite Ferro. S. D. A. was the abbreviation of the motto Sapiens Dominabitur Astris chosen by a Fraulein Anna Sprengel of Nuremburg, Germany. Such were the actors on this occult stage, this thedramatis per- sonae in the background of the commencement of the Order. More than any other figures who may later have prominently figured in its government and work, these are the four outstanding figures publicly involved in the English foundation of what came to be known as The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. How the actual instigation of the Order came to pass is not really known. Or rather, because of so many conflicting stories and legends the truth is impossible to discover. At any rate, so far as England is concerned, without a doubt we must seek for its origin in thh~ocietas ~osicruciana in Anglia. This was an organisation formulated in 1865 bv eminent Freemasons, some of them claiming authentic Rosicrucian initia- tion from continental authorities. Amongst those wh; claimed such initiation was one Kenneth H. Mackenzie, a Masonic scholar and encyclopaedist, who had received his at the hands of a Count Apponyi in Austria. The objects of this Society which con- fined its membership to Freemasons in good standing, was \"to afford mutual aid and encouragement in working out the great problems of Life, and in discovering the se- crets of nature; to facilitate the study of the systems of philosophy founded upon the Kaballah and the doctrines of Hermes Trismegistus.\" Dr. Westcott also remarks that today its Fratres \"are concerned in the study and administration of medi- <20> cines,andin their manufacture upon old lines; they also teach and practise the curative effects of coloured light, and cultivate mental processes which are believed to induce spiritual enlightenment and extended powers of the human senses, especially in the directions of clairvoyance and clairaudience.\" The first Chief of this Society, its Supreme Magus so-called, was one Robert Wentworth Little who is said to have rescued some old rituals from a certain Masonic storeroom, and it was from certain of those papers that the Society's rituals were elaborated. He died in 1878, and in his stead was appointed Dr. Wi R. Woodman. Both Dr. Westcott and MacGregor Mathers were prominent and active members of this body. In fact, the former became Supreme Magus upon Woodman's death, the office of Junior Magus being conferred upon Mathers. One legend has it that one day Westcott discovered in his library a series of cipher manuscripts, and in order to decipher them he enlisted the aid of MacGregor Mathers. It is said that this library was that of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anelia. and it is likewise asserted that those ci~her manuscripts were among the rituals Gd clocuments originally rescued by ~obe; Lit- tle from Freemason's Hall. Yet other accounts have it that Westcott or a clerical friend found the manuscripts on a bookstall in Farringdon Street. Further apocryphal legends claim that they were found in the library of books and manuscripts inherited from the mystic and clairvoyant, Frederick Hockley, who died in 1885. Whatever the real origin of these mysterious cipher manuscripts, when eventually deciphered with the aid of MacGregor Mathers, they were alleged to have contained the <21> address of a Fraulein Anna Sprengel who purported to be a Rosicrucian Adept, in Nuremburg. Here was a discovery which, naturally, not for one moment was neglected. Its direct result was a lennthy correspondence with Fraulein Sprengel, culmi&ting in the transmission of aurhdrity to woodman, Westcott and Mathers, to formulate in Enaland a semi-public occult organisation which was to employ an elaborate magical~ceremonial, ~abalistic teakg and a comprehensive scheme of s~iritual training. Its foundation was desiened to include both men and women on a'basis of perfezequality in contradistinction to the policy of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia which was comprised wholly of Freemasons. Thus, in 1887, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was established. Its first English Temple, Isis-Urania, was opened in the following year. There is a somewhat different version as to its origin, having behind it the"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"18 The Golden Dawn authority of Frater F. R, the late Dr. Felkin, who was the Chief of the Stella Matutina as well as a member of the Societas Rosicruciana. According to his account, and the following words are substantially his own, prior to 1880 members of the Rosicrucian 9rder on the Continent selected with great care their own candidates whom they thought suitable for personal instruction. For these pupils they were each individu- ally responsible, the pupils thus selected being trained by them in the theoretical traditional knowledge now used in the Outer Order. After some three or more years of intensive private study these pupils were presented to the Chiefs of the Order, and if approved and passed by examination, they then received their initiation into the Order of the Roseae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis. <22> The political state of Europe in the nineteenth century was such that the strictest secrecy as to the activities of these people was very necessary. England, however, where many Masonic bodies and semi-private organisations were flourishing without interference, was recognised as having far greater freedom and liberty than the countries in which the continental Adepts were domiciled. Some, but by no means all, suggested therefore that in England open Temple work might be inaugurated. And Dr. Felkin here adds, though without the least word of explanation as to what machinery was set in motion towards the attainment of that end, \"and so it was . . . It came about then that Temples arose in London, Bradford, Weston-super- Mare, and Edinburgh. The ceremonies we have were elaborated from cipher manu- scripts, and all went well for a time.\" Since the history of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn subsequent to this period has already been narrated elsewhere there is little need to repeat it. Those who may be interested in a detailed meticulous history of the Rosicrucian claim as it has existed in Europe during the past three hundred years are advised to consult Arthur Edward Waite's The Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross. While in my small work My Rosicru- cian Adventure the events that occurred to the Golden Dawn, culminating in this pres- ent publication of its teaching and rituals, are delineated at some length. The motives which have confirmed me in this decision to ad contrary to the obligation of secrecy are there presented and discussed. And with these directions, let us pass from histori- cal bones to what is the dynamic life and soul of the Order, its teaching and cere- monial technique of initiation <23> Before one can grasp the nature of ceremonial initiation, which was the assumed function of the Golden Dawn, a few fundamental notions of the philosophy underlying its practice must be grasped. The basic theory of the Order system was such as to idenhfy certain of the grades with various spritual principles existing in the universe. Hence a philosophy which describes, classifies, and purports to understand the nature of the universe must be studied before the sigruficance of the grades can be appreciated. One of the most important backgrounds of the system is the scheme of the Qabalah, a Jewish system described at length in my Tree of Life and the knowledge lectures herein. Since it is primarily a mystical method, the Qabalah has innumerable points of identitvwith the more ancient systems elaborated by other peoples in other ;arts of the world. 1ts most important roo~concept is that the uitirnate root from which this universe, with all things therein, has evolved is Ain Souh Aour, Infinite or Limitless Light. ~b far as our \"minds are capable of conceivikg such metaphysical abstractions, this is to be understood as an infinite ocean of brilliance wherein all things are held as within a matrix, from which all things were evolved, and it is that divine goal to which all life and all beings eventually must return. Issuing from or within this Boundless Light, there manifests what is called the Tree of ~ifc ~abalists have produced a convekonal glyph indicating thereupon ten numerations or Sephiroth which are the branches of that Tree growing or evolving"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"<24> within space, ten different modes of the manifestation of its radiation - ten varying degrees of but one ubiquitous substance-principle. The first of these numerations is called Kether, the'crown, and is the first manifes- tation from the Unknown, a concentration of its Infinite Light. As the radiant apex of this heavenly tree, it is the deepest sense of selfhood and the ultimate root of sub- stance. It constitutes the divine centre of human consciousness, all the other prin- ciples which comprise what we call man being rather like so many layers of an dnion around a central core. From this meta~hvsicaland universal centre dualitvissues. two distinct principles of activity, the oninked Chokmah, Wisdom, and thgother ina ah, Understanding. Here we have the roots of polarity, male and female, positive and negative, fire and water, mind and matter, and these two ideas are the noumena of all the various opposites in life of which we have cognisance. These three emanations are unique in a special way, and they especially sym- bolise that \"Light which shineth in darkness,\" the Light of the spiritual Self. As Light shines into darkness, illuminating it without suffering a diminution of its own exist- ence, so the workings of the Supernals, as these three Sephiroth are called, overflow from their exuberant being without thereby diminishing in any degree the reality or infinite vitality of their source. They are considered hence to have but little relation with the inferior Sephiroth which issue from them, except as stem and root. Yet though hardly in any philosophic relation to our phenomenal universe, we find when engaged in magical working that it is customary - even necessary - to open our- selves by invocation to its influence so that this divine power of the Supernal <25> Light, descending through the human mind, may sanctify and accomplish the object of the ceremony itself. The Supernals are often portrayed diagram- matically and symbolically as a woman clothed with the Sun,stars above her head and the moon at her feet - the typical anima figure of modem psychology. She represents thus that First Matter of the Alchemists, the description of which given by Thomas Vaughan in his Coelum Terrae is interesting to quote as indicating further the nature and qualities of the Supemals: \"A most pure sweet virgin, for noth- ing as yet hath been generated out of her.. . She yields to nothing but love, for her end is generation, and that was never yet performed by violence. He that knows how to wanton and toy with her, the same shall receive all her treasures. First, she sheds at her nipples a thick heavy water, but white as any snow; the philosophers call it Virgin's Milk. Secondly, she gives him blood from her very heart; it is a quick, heavenly fire; some improperly call it their sulphur. Thirdly and lastly, she presents him with a secret crystal, of more worth and lustre than the white rock and all her rosials. This is she, and these are her favours.\" From this first triad, a second triad of emanations is reflected or projected downwards into a more coarse degree of substance. They likewise reflect the nega- tive and positive qualities of two of the Supemals with the addition of a third factor, a resultant which acts as a reconciling principle. In passing, I should add that plane- tary attributions are given to these Sephiroth as expressing the type of their opera- tion Kether is Spirit, Chokmah refers to the Zodiac, and Binah is attributed to Saturn. <26> The fourth Sephirah is Chesed, meaning Grace or Mercy; also Gedulah is its other name, meaning Greatness, and to it is referred the astrological quality called Jupiter. Its concept is one of construction, expansion and solidification. Geburah is the fifth enumeration, Power of Might, and it is a symbol of creative power and force. Its planetary attribution is Mars, its quality being that destructive force which demolishes all forms and ideas when their term of usefulness and healthy life is done. It symbolises not so much a fixed state of things, as an act, a further passage and transition of potentiality into actuality. Six is the harmonising and reconciling Sephirah, Tiphareth. The word itself"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"20 . The Golden Dawn means beauty and harmony. It is attributed to the Sun, the lord and centre of our solar system. Just as Kether referred to the most secret depths of the Unconscious, the core of man's life, so Tiphareth is its reflection, the ego, the ordiiry human consciousness. This Sephirah completes the second triad, which is a triad of consciousness, as the firsttriad of the Supernal Light may be considered the triad of that which is supremely divine, the Superconscious. Nehnch, Victory, to which the planet Venus is referred, is the first Sephirah of the third and reflected triad, and marks an entirely different order of things. Here we enter the elemental sphere, where Nature's forces have their sway. It is also the region in the human sphere of what we may term the Unconscious. The magical tradition classifies this Unconsciousness into several strata, and to each of them is attributed some one of the four elements, Fire, Water, Air and Earth. Netsach is attributed <27> to the element of Fire, and so far as concerns the classification of man's prin- ciples, it represents his emotional life. Its opposite pole on the Tree of Life, is Hod, which means Splendour, which receives the attribution of the planet Mercury. Its element is Water, and its action rep- resents fluidic mind, the thinking, logical capacity in man, as well as what may be called his magical or nervous force - what the Hindu systems denominate as Prana. The third of that triad is Yesod, the Foundation, the ninth Sephirah, the operation of the Sphere of the Moon. This is the airy sphere of the fourth dimension, termed in occultism the Astral plane. Here we find the subtle electro-magnetic substance into which all the higher forces are focussed, the ether, and it constitutes the basis or final model upon which the physical world is built. Its elemental attribution is that of Air, ever flo-g, shifting, andin a constant flux - yet because of that flux, in perpetual stabilitv. lust as the tremendous speed of the particles insures the stabilitv of the atom, so the fleeting forms and motio; of Yesod * all its implications constitute the per- manence and surety of the physical world. Pendant to these three triads isMalkufh, the Kingdom, referred to the element of Earth, the synthesis or vehicle of the other elements and planets. Malkuth is the physi- cal world, and in man represents his physical body and brain, the Temple of the Holy Ghost - the actual tomb of the allegorical Christian Rosenkreutz. These Sephiroth are not to be construed as ten different portions of objective space, each separated by millions and millions of miles -though of course <28> they must have their correspondences in different parts of space. They are, rather, serial concepts, each condition or state or serial concept enclosing the other. Each Sephirah, be it spiritual, ethereal, or physical, has its own laws, conditions, and \"times,\" if one may borrow terminology from Dunne's Experiment with Time. The distinction between them is one of quality and density of substance. The difference may well be one of dimension, besides representing different type-levels of con- sciousness, the \"lower\" worlds or Sephiroth being interpenetrated or held by the \"higher.\" Thus Kether, the Crown, is inMalkuth, as one axiom puts it, by virtue of the fact that its substance is of an infinitely rare, attenuated, and ethereal nature, while Malkuth, the physical universe is enclosed within the all-pervading spirit which is Kether in precisely the same way that Dunne conceives Time No. 1, to be enclosed or contained, or moving as a field of experience, within Serial Time No. 2. So far as concerns the Suvernals, for these are the ideas which must vrincivallv interest us, the Qabalah teaches us that they comprise an abstract impersinal phnci- ple. That is, it is explained as an exalted condition of consciousness rather than of sub- stance; an essenceor spirit whichis everywhere and at all times expressed in terms of Light. In one sense, and from a comparative point of view, it may help our under- standing if we imagine it to have certain similarities to what our leading Analytical Psychologists call the Collective Unconscious."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Introduction 21 Though wholly impersonal in themselves and without characteristics that are readily understandable to the ordinary mind, the Supemals are, to all <29> intents and purposes, what is commonly thought of as God. In the Tibetan Buddhist system, an analogous concept is Suntaya, the Void. And the realisation of the Void through Yoga processes and the technical medi- tations of the Sangha is, to quote Dr. Evan-Wentz's book The Tibetan Book of the Dead, to attain \"the unconditioned Dharmakaya, or the Divine Body of Truth, the primordial state of uncreatedness, of the Supramundane Bodhic, All-conscious- ness-Buddhahood.\" In man, this Light is represented by the very deepest levels of his Unconscious-a mighty activity within his soul, which one magical system calls the higher and Divine Genius. Though the Golden Dawn rituals persistent- ly use phraseology which implies the belief in a personal God, that usage to my mind is a poetic or dramatic convention. A number of its very fine invocations are addressed to a deity conceived of in a highly individualistic and personal man- ner, yet if the student bears in mind the several Qabalistic definitions, these ritu- als take on added and profound meaning from a purely psychological point of view. That is, they are seen to be technical methods of exalting the individual consciousness until it comes to a complete realisation of its own divine root, and that universal pure essence of mind which ultimately it is. It may be convenient for the reader if I tabulate the names of the Sephiroth with the Grades employed in the Golden Dawn, together with a few important attributions: <30>1. Kether. The Crown. Spirit. 2. Chokmah. Wisdom. 3. Binah. Understanding. 4. Chesed. Mercy. 5. Geburah. Might. 6. Tiphareth. Harmony. 7. Netzach. Victory. Fire. 8. Hod. Splendour. Water. 9. Yesod. Foundation. Air.

Earth Zelator @=!id In the consideration of the Grades, I shall not discuss any others than those existing between Zelator and Adeptus Minor. My reason for doing so is that it is impossible for the ordinary individual to understand those above the Grade of Adeptus Minor, and individuals who lay claim openly to such exalted Grades, by that very act place a gigantic question mark against the validity of their attain- ment. He that is exalted is humble. And to have tasted that which is conveyed by the Adeptus Minor Grade is so lofty an experience that few in their right minds, unless they were extremely saintlike in character, would consider themselves as having passed officially to a higher spiritual state. Before proceeding to an analysis of the Grades, and the ceremonies which were supposed to confer them, it has been thought advisable to con- sider the nature of initiation itself, which was the avowed function and purpose of the Order. What exactly is Initiation? Those of us who <31> have read some of the neo-occult and pseudo-Theosophical literature will also have heard the word initiation just too often to feel wholly at ease. Lesser Initiations and Greater Initiations have been written of at some length. But the entire subject was surrounded with that vague air of"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"22 The Golden Dawn mystery, that halo of sanctity and ambiguity whose only excuse can be ignorance on the part of the writers thereof. The degree of phantasy and attenuated sentimentality which has obtained expression from these sources, plus the real lack of knowledge as to the objects of these degrees and mysteries, act as a constant source of irritation. Par- ticularly, when we remember that they were issued to satisfy people spiritually hungry, and yearning with an indescribable hunger for but a few crumbs of the divine wisdom. Learned dissertations have been published describing in meat detail the folk customs of Australian aborigines and ~il~nesian and other irimftive peoples. All the strange habits and unfamiliar rites of these tribes are varaded before our we -from theirkour of birth, through the vicissitudes of their ;motional life, to th; moment of death and interment. We are asked to accept that these are initiations. The sole import attached to the word\"initiation\"in this connection is that of the formal accept- ance of a boy at puberty, for example, into the communal life of his people. Moreover, Jane E. Harrison, Sir J. G. Frazer and a host of other excellent scholars have provided us with a wealth of anthropological data so far as the Greeks <32> and Romans of another day are concerned. Some knowledge of their religious rites and observances is displayed. The daily habits of the people are carefully noted and recorded in many a tome. They also describe, though more haltingly and with rather less confidence, the circumstances surrounding the Ancient Mystery Cults. The symbolism of these mys- teryreligions was, we see, in certain aspects uniform. All were dramas of redemption, plans of salvation, ways of purgation. Degrees of initiation, baptism by water, a mysti- cal meal for the privileged, dramatic plays depicting the life and death of some god or other - these are the familiar incidents of the cults described by our scholars. But the obvious question arises, what spiritual vzlue have such things for us? Do they help our own interior development so that we may solve our personal problems and handle more satisfactorily the rather difficult process of living today? And is this sort of thing what the Adepts of old implied by initiation? And if this is all there is to it, why should so many modems have been so curiously perturbed and excited by it all. Some other meaning must be latent herein; some other purpose to the rite must have been understood by their original observers whereby they were spiritually assisted and aided not only to deal adequately with life but to further the conquest and manifestation of their own latent spiritual nature. For despite every record, and every learned attempt to penetrate into the sigrufi- cance of these rites, as to the exact procedure of the Theurgic technique we still obtain no lasting satisfaction, or understanding. There was undoubtedly a secret <33> about these celebrations, both ethnic and early Christian, which no exoteric record has divulged or common sense, so-called, succeeded wholly to explain away. And the reason no doubt it this. Though the early writers felt no hesitancy in expounding certain principles of the philosophy of their Mysteries, none felt it incumbent upon hiiself to record in black and white the practical details of the magi- cal technique. Hence it is, in the absence of a description of the practical elements of these rites, that our scholars, anthropologists and philosophers do not feel inclined to attach much significance to the ancient Mysteries other than an ordinary religious or philosophic one. That is, it is their belief that ordinary notions of an advanced theological or philosophical nature were promulgated therein. For I may add in pass- ing the complete esoteric technique of initiation has never previously passed into open publication. It has been reserved in all secrecy for initiates of the sacred schools of Magic. While various documents explaining the principia of this wisdom were cir- culated amongst the members of these schools, the oaths of secrecy attaching to their receipt was such that in recent times, as I have said, few lay exponents of the ancient religions and philosophies have never so much as suspected the existence of these"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"principia. The root of the word itself means \"to begin,\" \"to commence anew.\" Initiation is thus the beginning of a new phase or attitude to life, the entry, moreover, into an entirely new type of existence. Its characteristic is the opening of the mind to an awareness of other levels of consciousness, both within and without. Initiation means above all spiritual growth - a definite mark in the span of human life. <34> Now one of the best methods for bringingabout this stimulus of the inner lde, so that one does really begin or enter upon an entirely new existence characterised by an awareness of higher principles within, is the Ceremonial tech- nique. By this we mean that a Ceremony is arranged in which certain ideas, teaching and admonitions are communicated to the candidate in dramatic form in a formally prepared Temple or Lodge room. Nor is this all - otherwise, no claim could be made on behalf of Magic that it really and not merely figuratively initiates. For the utterance of an injunction does not necessarily imply that it can sink sufficiently deeply into consciousness so as to arouse into renewed activity the dormant spiritual qualities. And we have already witnessed the invalidity and spiritual bankruptcy of innumer- able organisations, religious, secular, and fraternal so-called, which have their own rituals and yet, taking them by and large, have produced very few initiates or spiritually- minded men and women, saints or adepts of any outstanding merit. The efficacy of an initiation ceremony depends almost exclusively on the initiator. What is it that bestows the power of successful initiation? This power comes from either having had it awakened interiorly at the hands of some other competent initiator, or that a very great deal of magical and meditation work has successfully been performed. It is hardly necessary at this juncture to labour at a description of these exercises and technical processes of development which were undertaken by candidates and would-be initiators. These have been delineated at length elsewhere, both in my Tree of Life, and in an incomparably fine form in the Golden Dawn <35> documents resented herein. But it is necessarv to emvhasize the fact that an anterior per'sonal training and prolonged magiial effoA are the sole means by which one is enabled so to awaken the dormant sviritual life of another that he mav well and truly be called \"initiated.\" Now we know from an examination of the above mentioned documents and of ancient literature that the object of the Theurgic art, as the magical concept of initia- tion was then termed. was so to vurifv the versonalitv that that which was there imprisoned could sprkg into open'destati'on. As on: of the alchemical expositors has exvressed it: \"Within the material extreme of this life. when it is rmrified. the Seed of the Spirit is at last found.\" The entire object of all magicHl and alch'emkal processes is the purification of the natural man, and by working upon his nature to extract the pure gold of spiritual attainment. This is initiation. These Golden Dawn rituals and ceremonies of initiation are worthy of a great deal of study and attention. It is my sincere and fervent hope that meditation and a close examination will be made of the text. Now, if we examine these texts carefully, we shall find that we can epitomise in a single word the entire teaching and ideal of those rituals. If one idea more than any other is persistently stressed from the begin- ning that idea is in the word Light. From the candidate's first reception in the Hall of the Neophytes when the Hierophant adjures him with these words: \"Child of Earth, long hast thou dwelt in darkness. Quit the night and seek the day,\" to the <36> transfiguration in the Vault ceremony, the whole system has as its objective the bringing down of the Light. For it is by that Light that the golden banner of the inner life may be exalted; it is in light where lies healing and the power of growth. Some vague intimation of the power and splendour of that glory is first given to the"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"24 The Golden Dawn aspirant in the Neophyte Grade when, rising from his knees at the close of the invoca- tion, the Light is formulated above his head in the symbol of the White Triangle by the union of the implements of the three chief officers. By means of the Adeptus Minor ritual, which identifies him with the Chief Officer, he is slain as though by the destruc- tive force of his lower self. After being symbolically buried, triumphantly he rises from the tomb of Osiris in a glorious resurrection through the descent of the white Light of the Spirit. The intervening grades occupy themselves with the analysis of that Light as it vibrates between the light and the darkness, and with the establishment within the candidate's personal sphere of the rays of the many-coloured rainbow of promise. \"Before all things,\" commences a phrase in one ritual, \"are the chaos, the dark- ness, and the Gates of the Land of Night\" It is in this dark chaotic night so blindly called life, a night in which we struggle, labour and war incessantly for no reasonable end, that we ordinary human beings stumble and proceed about our various tasks. These gates of the far-flung empire of the night indeed refer eloquently to the material bondage whichwe ourselves have created - a bondage whereby we are tied to our circumstances, to our selves, to trial of every kind, bound to the very things we so despise and hate. It is not until we have clearly realised that we are <37> enmeshed in darkness, an interior darkness, that we can commence to seek for that alchemical solvent which shall disperse the night, and call a halt to the continual projection outwards of the blackness which blinds our souls. As in the Buddhist scheme, where the first noble truth is sorrow, so not until we have been brought by experience to understand life as sorrow, can we hope for the cessation of its dread ravage. Only then does the prospect open of breaking the unconscious pro- jection, the ending of which discloses the world and the whole of life in a totally dif- ferent light. \"One thing only, brother, do I proclaim,\" said the Buddha, \"now as before. Suffering and deliverance from suffering.\" These restricting circumstances and bonds are only the gates of the wilderness. The use of the word \"gate\"imp1ies a means both of egress and ingress. By these gates we have entered, and by them also may we go out if so we choose, to enter the brilliance of the dawning Sun, and perchance greet the rising of the spiritual splen- dour. For \"after the formless, the void, and the darkness, then cometh the knowledge of the Light.\" As intimated above, one first must have realised that one's soul is lost in darkness before a remedy can be sought to that irresponsible participation mystique, the unconscious projection outwards of interior confusion, and aspire to that divine land which is, metaphorically, the place of one's birth. In that land is no darkness, no formlessness, no chaos. It is the place of the Light itself - that Light \"which no wind can extinguish, which burns without wick or fuel.\" Being \"brought to the Light\" then is a very apposite description of the <38> function of Initiation. It is the Great Work. There is no ambiguity in the con- ception of the Rituals, for it appears throughout the entire work from Neo- phyte to Adeptus Minor and perhaps beyond. For the Path is a journeying upwards on the ladder of existence to the crown of the Tree of Life, a journey where every effort made and every step taken brings one a little nearer to the true glory of the Clear Light. As we know, the experience of the rising of the Light in both vision and waking state is common to mystics of every age and of every people. It must be an experience of the greatest significance in the treading of the Path because its appearance seems always and everywhere an unconditional psychic thing. It is an experience which defies definition, as well in its elementary flashes as in its most advanced transports. No code of thought, philosophy or religiGn, no logical process can bind it or limit it or express it. But always it represents, spiritually, a marked attainment, a liberation from the turmoil of life a Ad froi psychic cbmplic&ins and, as Dr. C. G. ~un~ has expressed the matter, it \"thereby frees the inner personality from emotional and imaginary"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Introduction 25 entanglements, creating thus a unity of being which is universally felt as a release.\" It is the attainment of spiritual puberty, marking a significant stage in growth. Symptomatic of this stage of interior growth is the utter transformation that comes over what previously appeared to be \"the chaos, the darkness, and the Gates of the Land of Night.\" While man is assumed into godhead, and the divine spirit is brought down into manhood, a new heaven and a new earth make their appearance, and familiar objects take on a divine radiance as though illumined by an inter- <39> nal spiritual light. And this is what, in part at any rate, was meant by the old alchemists, for the finding of the Philosopher's Stone converts all base metals into the purest gold. In his book Centuries of Meditation, Thomas Traherne gives an interesting description of the rapture of the inner personality, its reaction to the world, when it is freed by the mystical experience from all entanglements. He says: \"The corn was orient and immortal wheat, which never should be reaped, nor was ever sown. I thought it had stood from everlasting to everlasting. The dust and the stones of the street were as precious as gold; the gates were at first the end of the world. The green trees when I saw them first through one of the gates, transported and ravished me, their sweetness and unusual beauty made my heart to leap, and almost mad with ecstasy, they were such strange and wonderful things. The men! 0 what venerable and reverent creatures did the aged seem! Immortal Cherubim! And the young men glittering and sparkling angels, and maids, strange seraphic pieces of life and beauty. Boys and girls tumbling in the street, and playing, were moving jewels . . . I knew not that they were born or should die. But all things abided eternally as they were in their proper places. Eternity was manifest in the Light of the Day, and some- thing infinite behind everything appeared . . .\" And to illustrate the magical attitude towards life and the world when initiation has produced its true result, there is another exalted panegyric by Traherne which I cannot desist from quoting. For let me add that Magic does not countenance a retreat from life, an escape from the turmoils of practical life. It seeks only to trans- <40> mute what formerly was dross into gold. Initiation has as its object the com- mencement of a new life, to transform the base and low into the pure and unutterably splendid. \"All appeared new and strange at first, inexpressibly rare and delightful and beautiful. I was a little stranger which at my entrance into the world was saluted and surrounded with innumerable joys. My knowledge was Divine; I knew by intuition those things which since my Apostacy I collected again by the highest reason. My very ignorance was advantageous. I seemed as one brought into the state of innocence. All things were spotless and pure and glorious; yea, and infinitely mine and joyful and precious. I knew not that there were any sins, or complaints or laws. I dreamed not of poverties, contentions, or vices. All tears and quarrels were hidden from my eyes. Everything was at rest, free and immortal. I knew nothing of sickness or death or exaction. In the absence of these I was entertained like an angel with the works of God in their splendour and glory; I saw all in the peace of Eden. . . All Time was Eternity, and a perpetual Sabbath. . .\" Such is the stone of the Philosophers, the Quintessence, the Summurn Bonum, true wisdom and perfect happiness. Psellus, the Neoplatonist, has written that the function of Initiatory Magic was \"to initiate or perfect the human soul by the powers of materials here on earth; for the supreme faculty of the soul cannot by its own guidance aspire to the sublimest intui- tion and to the comprehension of Divinity.\" It is a commonplace aphorism in Occult- ism that \"Nature unaided fails.\" That is to say that the natural life, if left to itself, and isolated from the impact of a higher type of life or consciousness, can only <41> produce a commonplace thing of the natural life. It reminds us of the senti- ment of the alchemists who expressed contempt of their first matter as it existed in its natural or impure state, in the condition where it normally is found. But"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"26 The Golden Dawn this first matter, cleansed and purified by the psycho-chemical art of alchemy, that is to sav bv Initiation -is that which is transformed into the most vrecious thine in the whoie korld. But until cleansed and purified it is of little dr no value. kature, however, aided where she had left off by wise and devout men, may surpass herself. And this is why Psellus claims that the soul of itself and by itself is not able to attain to divinity unless and until it is guided by Initiates and thus enfolded into another life. It is to effect this integration, to bring about this initiation, this exaltation of the con- sciousness above its natural state to the light divine, that the magical system of the Golden Dawn, or of any other legitimate initiating system, owes its existence. The function of every phase of its work, the avowed intention of its principal rituals, and the explicit statement of its teaching, is to assist the candidate by his own aspirations to find that unity of being which is the inner Self, the pure essence of mind, the Buddha-nahue. Not only does the system imply this by its ritualistic movements and axiomata, but there are klear and unmistakable passages where these ideas are given unequivocal expression. Thus, we find it written that the entire object of initiation and mystical teaching is \"by the intervention of the symbol, ceremonial and sacrament, so to lead the soul that it may be withdrawn from the attraction of matter and delivered from the absorption therein, whereby it wallcs in somnambulism, knowing <42> not whence it cometh nor whither it goeth.\" And moreover, in the same Ritual, celebrated at the autumnal and vernal Equinoxes, the Chief Adept officiating recites an invocation beseeching guidance for the newly-installed Hiero- phant. It is asked \"that he may well and worthily direct those who have been called from the tribulation of the darkness into the Light of this little kingdom of Thy love. And vouchsafe also, that going forward in love for Thee, through him and with him, they may pass from the Desire of Thy house into the Light of Thy presence.\" This is succeeded by sentences read by the Second and Third Adepti: ''The desire of Thy house hath eaten me up,\" and \"I desire to be dissolved and to be with Thee.\" And finally, that not the least vestige of misunderstanding or misconception may remain as to the objects of this divine Theurgy, let me reproduce one last quotation from this same ritual. Referring to the Supemals and the Temple that in old time was built on high, the speech adds: \"The holy place was made waste and the Sons of the house of Wisdom were taken away into the captivity of the senses. We have wor- shipped since then in a house made with hands, receiving a sacramental ministration by a derived Light in place of the cohabiting Glory. And yet, amidst Signs and sym- bols the tokens of the Higher presence have never been wanting in our hearts. By the waters of Babylon we have sat down and wept, but we have ever remembered Zion; 'and that memorial is a witness testifying that we shall yet retum with exultation into the house of our Father.\" Thus and unmistakably is the true object of the Great Work set before us, and we shalldo well ever to keep eye andaspiration firmly fixed thereto. For while the <43> road to the spiritual Zion demands great exertion, and because it is a way that at times proceeds by devious route; there is great temptation to linger by the roadside, to stroll down pleasant side-lanes, or to play absent-mindedly with toys or staves cut but to assist o;r forward march. But if ie forget not to what koble ci6 the winding path leads us, little danger can overtake any who pursue it steadfast to the end. It is only when the abiding city is forgotten that the road becomes hard, and the way beset by unseen danger and difficulty. Prior to attempting to describe a few of the salient points of the Rituals -briefly, for since they appear within these volumes, they must be individually studied and experienced so that an individual point of view may be acquired - it may be advis- able to devote a few explanatory words to the Art of Ceremonial Initiation itself. A useful and significant preface may be taken from Dr. Jung's commentary to Wilhelm's translation of The Secret of The Golden Flower, where there is much that"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"explains the ritualistic functions of Magic. \"Magical practices are,\" he declares, \"the projections of psychic events which, in cases like these, exert a counter influence on the soul, and act like a kind of enchantment of one's own personality. That is to say, by means of these concrete performances, the attention or better said the interest, is brought back to an inner sacred domain which is the source and goal of the soul. This inner domain contains the unity of life and consciousness which, though once possessed, has been lost and must now be found again.\" From one point of view the officers employed in these Rituals represent <44> just such psychic projections. They represent, even as figures in dreams do, different aspects of man himself - personifications of abstract psychological principles inhering within the human spirit. Through the admittedly artificial or con- ventional means of a dramatic projection of these personified principles in a well- ordered ceremony a reaction is induced in consciousness. This reaction is calculated to arouse from their dormant condition those hitherto latent faculties represented obiectively in the Temple of Initiation by the officers. Without the least conscious effbrt on the part of fibaspirant, an invofmtary current of sympathy is produced by this external delineation of s~iritual Darts which mav be sufficient to accom~lish the purpose of the initiation cerimony. the aesthetic aGpeal to the imagination'- quite apart from what could be called the intrinsic magical virtue with which the G. D. documents Z. 1. and Z. 3. deal at some length - stirs to renewed activitythe life of the inner domain. And the entire action of this type of dramatic ritual is that the soul may discover itself exalted to the heights, and during that mystical elevation receive the rushing forth of the Light. Applying these ideas then, to the Neophyte or @= - so called because it is not attributed to any of the enumerations or Sephiroth on the Tree of Life since it is a preliminary or probationary grade - we find that the Kerux is an officer who per- sonifies the reasoning faculties. He represents that intelligent active part of the mind which functions ever in obedience to the Will - the Qabalistic Ruach, in a word. The higher part of that mind, the aspiring, sensitive, and the intuitive conscious- <45> ness is represented by the Hegemon, who seeks the rising of the Light. And the Hierophant, in this initial ceremony of Neophyte, acts on behalf of the higher spiritual soul of man himself, that divine self of which too rarely, if ever at all, we become aware. \"The essence of mind is intrinsically pure,\" is a definition of the Bodhisattva Sila Sutra, and it is this essential state of enlightenment, this interior Self, Osiris glorified through trial and perfected by suffering, which is represented by the Hierophant on the dais. He is seated in the place of the rising Sun, on the throne of the East, and-with but two or three exceptions never moves from that station in the Tem- ple. As the Qabalah teaches, the everlasting abode of the Higher Self is in the Eden of Paradise, the supernal sanctuary which is ever guarded from chaos by the flaming sword of the Kerubirn whirling every way on the borders of the abyss. From that aloof spiritual str6nghold it gazes down upon its vehicle, the lower man, evolved for the purpose of providing it with experience - involved in neither its struggles or tribulations, yet, from another point of view, suffering acutely thereby. And seldom does that Genius leave its palace of the stars except when, voluntarily, the lower self opens itself to the higher by an act of sincerest aspiration of self-sacrifice, which alone makes possible the descent of the Light within our hearts and minds. Thus when the Hierophant leaves the Throne of the East, he represents that Higher Self inaction, and as Osiris marks the active descent of the Supernal splendour. For he says, as he leaves the dais with wand uplifted: \"I come in the Power of the Light. I come in the Light of Wisdom. I come in the Mercy of the Light. The Light hath healing inits wings.\" <46> And having brought the Light to the aspirant, he returns to his throne, as though that divine Genius of whom he is the symbol awaited the deliberate willing return of the aspirant himself to the everlasting abode of the Light."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"28 The Golden Dawn Even in the communication of the usual claptrap of secret societies, the signs and grips, all these are explained solely in terms of the quest for the Light. Also the various groupings of officers and their movements in the Temple are not without profound meaning. These should be sought out, since they constantly reiterate the implicit pur- pose of the rite. Thus, at the altar, the three principal officers form about the candidate a Triad, representing in symbolic formation again the Supernal clear Light of the Void, and this also is represented by the number of the circumambulations about the con- fines of the Temple. The white cord bound thrice about the waist has reference to the same set of ideas. Even upon the altar of the Temple are symbols indicating the rise of Light. A red calvary cross of six squares as symbolic of harmony and equilibrium is placed above a white triangle -the emblem of the Golden Dawn. They form the sym- bol of the Supernal Sephiroth which are the dynamic life and root of all things, while in man they constitute that triad of spiritual faculties which is the intrinsically pure essence of mind. Hence the triangle is a fitting emblem of the Light. And the place of the Cross above the Triangle suggests not the domination of the sacred spirit, but its equilibriation and harmony in the heart of man. Despite the fact that the whole of this intricate symbolism can hardly be realised by the candidate at the time of his initia- tion, its intrinsic value is such that unconsciously as an organised body of sug- <47> gestion it is perceived and noted and strikes the focal centre. We are taught by tradition that the entire object of the sacred rites was the purification of the soul so that its power could gradually dissolve the impediments of, and percolate through, the heavy body and opaque brain. \"Know\" says Synesius, \"that the Quintessence and hidden thing of our stone is nothing else than our viscous celestial and glorious soul drawn out of its minera by our magistery.\" Hence the entire trend of the preliminary Neophyte grade of the Golden Dawn is towards the purifica- tion of the personality. It fulfills the testimony of the Hermetic Art so that the Light within could be fermented and perfected by the ceremonial method of initiation. Purification and consecration - this is the insistent and uncompromising theme caught by the candidate's ear. \"Unpurified and unconsecrated thou canst not enter our sacred Hall!\"Fire and water assist in these several consecrations until, eventually, the candidate is placed in the position of balanced power, between the two Pillars, where the first link is effected with his higher and divine Genius. The Neophyte Ritual really stands by itself. It is an introductory ceremony shadowing forth all the major formulae and techniques. With the Adeptus Minor ritual it is concerned almost entirely with the Light itself. The five grades that are placed between them have as their object the awakening of the elemental bases of what must develop into the instrument of the higher. Awakened and purified, <48>' they may be consecrated to the Great Work, in order that they may become worthy vehicles for the indwelling of the Light. First, however, it ishecessary that they be awakened. For, psychological truism that it is, until their presence is realised their transmutation cannot be accomplished. In symbolic form and pagean- try, the ceremony of each grade calls forth the spirits of a particular element. And as a steel placed in ciose to a magnet receives soie degree of its magnetism, and comparable to the electrical phenomenon of induction, so the presence of power induces bower. Contact with tGe appropriate type of elemental jorce prodices an identical type of reaction within the sphere of the Neophyte, and it is thus that growth and advancement proceeds. The speeches of the officers deal almost exclusively with the knowledge pertaining to that element and grade, and excerpts from fragmentary remains of the ancient Mysteries and from certain of the books of the Qabalah do much towards producing an impressive atmosphere. The element offered for the work of transmutation in the Grade of Zelator is the"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Introduction 29 earthy part of the Candidate. The ritual symbolically admits him to the first rung of that mighty ladder whose heights are obscured in the Light above. This first rung is the lowest sphere of the conventional Tree of Life, Malkuth, the Sanctum Regnum. To it are ascribed the first grade of Zelator, and the element of Earth. Herein, after the Earth elementals are invoked, the Candidate is ceremonially brought to three stations, the first two being those of evil and the presence divine. At each of these stations the Guardians reject him at the point of the sword, urging him in his unprepared <49> state to return. Hi third attempt to go forward places him in a balanced posi- tion, the path of equilibrium, the Middle Way, where he is received. And a way is cleared for him by the Hierophant, who again represents the celestial soul of things. During his journey along that path, the stability of earth is established within him, that eventually it may prove an enduring temple of the Holy Spirit. Some have criticised these elemental grades a little harshly and severely; others have rejected them entirely. In a letter sent to me from a former Praemonstrator of one G. D. Temple, these rituals too were condemned in that they were said to be sim- ply a parade, redundant and verbose, of the occult knowledge that one of the Chiefs possessed at that time. In one sense, of course, what those critics claim is perfectly true. The principal formulae and teaching are concealed in the preliminary Neophyte Grade and that of Adeptus Minor. It is the development of the ideas in these cere- monies which constitutes the Great Work - the disclosure of the essence of mind, the invocation of the higher Genius. These, however, are the high ends and the final goals of the mystic term. Notwithstanding his limitations these are ultimates to which every man mist work. Meanwhile, in orzer to render that attainment possible in its fullest sense, several important matters require attention. The personality must be har- monised. Every element therein demands equilibriation in order that illumination ensuing from the magical work may not prodice fanaticism and pathology instead of Adeptship and integrity. Balance is required for the accomplishment of the Great work. '%quiiib~um is the basis of the soul.\" heref fore, the four grades of <50> Earth, Air, Water and Fire plant the seeds of the microcosmic pentagram, and above them is placed, in the Portal ceremony, the Crown of the Spirit, the quintessence, added so that the elemental vehemence may be tempered, to the end that all may work together in balanced disposition. These grades are therefore an important and integral part of the work, despite shortsighted hostile criticism. To compare them, however, with those which precede and follow, is symptomatic of an intellectual confusion of function. It is rather as if one said that milk is more virtuous than Friday - which, naturally, is absurd. Yet similar comparisons in magical matters are constantly being made without exciting ridicule. It is obvious that different categories may not be so compared. The purpose of the Neophyte ritual is quite dis- tinct from that of Zelator, and it is mistaken policy to compare them. What rightly could be asked is whether the Zelator and the other elemental grades accomplish what they purport to do. That is another matter. The concensus of experienceaopin- ion is on the whole that they do, and I am content for the time being to accept that authority. The candidate by these gradgs is duly prepared, so it is argued, to enter the immeasurable region, to begin to analyse and comprehend the nature of the Light which has been vouchsafed him. The first three elemental grades could be taken just as quickly as the candidate, at the discretion of the Chiefs, desired. There were no requirements other than to indicate by examination that the appropriate meditations had been performed and certain items of Qabalistic knowledge necessary to the magical routine committed to memory. <51> Before proceeding further in the analysis of the grades, there is one rather fine prose passage in the Zelator grade which must be given here - a passage of beauty, high eloquence, and lofty significance. \"And Tetragrammaton"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"30 The Golden Dawn placed Kerubim at the East of the Garden of Eden and a Flaming Sword which turned every way to keep the path of the Tree of Life, for He has created Nature that man being cast out of Eden may not fall into the Void. He has bound man with the stars as with a chain. He allures him with scattered fragments of the Divine Body in bird and beast and flower. And He laments over him in the Wind and in the Sea and'in the Birds. And when the times are ended, He will call the Kerubim from the East of the Garden, and all shall be consumed and become infinite and holy.\" It would be a happy task, were it advisable, to devote several pages of this introduction to praising the excellence of what are called the four elemental prayers. Each one of the elemental Initiation ceremonies closes with a long prayer of invoca- tion which issues, as it were, from the heart of the elements themselves. These must be silently read, continuously meditated upon and frequently heard fully to be appreciated, when the reader will find his own personal reactions crystallising. Recited by the Hierophant at the end of the ceremony, these prayers voice the inherent aspiration of the elements towards the goal they are striving in their own way to reach, for here they are conceived as blind dumb forces both within and without the personal sphere of man. They are given assistance by the human beings who, having invoked them and used their power, strive to repay in some way the debt owed to these other struggling lives. <52> The grade after the Earth ceremony is that of Theoricus. It is referred to the Ninth Sephirah on the Tree of Life, Yesod, the Foundation, and to it are attributed the sphere of the operation of Luna and the element Air. Here the can- didate is conducted to the stations of the four Kerubim, the Angelic choir of Yesod. The Kerubim are defined in that ritual as the presidents of the elemental forces, the vivified powers of the letters of Tetragrammaton operating in the Elements. Over each of these rules some one of the four letters of the mirific word and the Kerubim. It is always through the power and authority and symbol of the Kerub that the elemen- tal spirits and their rulers are invoked. In this ritual, as in all the others, important practical formulae of ceremonial magic are concealed. At this juncture, of the ceremony, with the Airy elements vibrating about him and through hi, the Zelator is urged to be 'prompt and active as the Sylphs, but avoid frivolity and caprice. Be energetic and strong as the Salamanders but avoid irritability and ferocity. Be flexible and attentive to images, lie the Undines, but avoid idleness and changeability. Be laborious and patient like the Gnomes, but avoid grossness and avarice. So shalt thou gradually develop the powers of thy soul and fit thyself to command the spirits of the elements.\" In each of the grades, several drawings and diagrams are exhibited, each one conveying useful knowledge and information required in the upward quest. The Tarot Keys are also dealt with, as indicating pictorially the stages of that journey, and depicting the story of the soul. It may not be possible because of the exigencies of space to reproduce in these volumes a pack of Tarot cards based upon esoteric <53> descriptions - though I should very much liked to have done so. But by using the Waite and the available French and Italian packs, and by comparing them with the accounts given in the rituals, the imagination of the reader will render this omission unimportant. The third grade is that of Practicus referred to the Sephirah Hod, the Splendour, the lowest of the Sephiroth on the left hand side of the Tree, the Pillar of Severity. Its attributions refer to the sphere of the operation of Mercury, but more especially to the element of Water which in this ceremony is invoked to power and presence. As I have previously remarked, and it bears constant reiteration, the Tree of Life and the Qabalistic scheme as a whole should be carefully studied so that the aptness of the attributions both to the Sephiroth and the Paths may be fully appreciated. Two Paths lead to the Sphere of Splendour, the Path of Fire from Malkuth, and the Path of the"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The Golden Dawn I ~ing Sword which turned - t - 15 created Nature that man t r.wmd man with the stars as I- - :- 5 Divine Body in bird and I - : md in the Sea and in the ! ; 5-lbim from the East of the r - 5 83d holy.\" I : r:de several pages of this I t -.?e four elemental prayers.

Two Paths ,-- Malkuth, and the Path of the Introduction 3 1 reflection of the sphere of the Sun from Yesod. Water is germinative and maternal, whilst Fie is paternal and fructifying. It is from their interior stimulation and union, the alchemical trituration, that the higher life is born, even as has been said, \"Except ye be baptised with water and the Spirit ye cannot enter the Kingdom of heaven.\" Therefore in this grade, the Candidate is led to the sphere of stagnant water * which by the presence of solar and fiery elements is vitalised and rendered a perfect aeative base. Most of the speeches in this ritual are depicted as issuing from the Samothracian Kabiri, the deluge Gods, though the main body of the ritual consists of the sonorous and resonant versicles of the Chaldaean Oracles, the translation, I <54> believe, of Dr. Westcott, with a few modifications authorised by Mathers. Briefly, the entire symbolism of the Practicus grade is summarised by the position on the altar of the principal Golden Dawn emblems so arranged that \"the hoss above the Triangle repiesen& the power of the Spirit rising above tke triangle of the Waters.\"That also indicates the immediate task of the Candidate. At this iuncture. too, the diagrams displayed begin to take on especial significance, and thoLgh their theme apparently is biblical in nature, accompanied by explanations in a curious phraseology consonant therewith, they are nevertheless highly suggestive, as con- taining the elements of a profound psychology. After this grade follows an automatic wait of three months, referred to the regimen of the elements, a period as it were of silent incubation, during which time the rituals were given to the candidate that he may make copies for his own private use and study. The fourth grade of Philosophus carries the candidate one step further. The Sephirah involved is Netsach, Victory, to which is referred the operation of the planet Venus and the element of Fire, while the paths that connect to the lower rungs of the ladder are principally of a watery nature. Thus the elements encountered are of an identical nature with those of the preceding grade, but their order and power is quite reversed. Previously the water was predominant. Now the Fire rages and whirls in lurid storm, with water only as the complementary element whereon it may manifest, and in order that due equilibrium may be maintained, as it is written: - 'The Ruach Elohim moved upon the face of the Waters.\" These two are the primary terrestrial elements which, intelligently controlled and creatively employed may lead <55> eventually to the restoration of the Golden Age. By their transmutation a new paradise may be re-created from the darkness and chaos into which formerly it had fallen. For the Light may not legitimately be called forth upon man, nor dwell within him, until chaos has been turned into equilibrium of complete realisation and enlightenment. Not until order has been restored to the lower elements of his earthy kingdom, neither peace nor inner security may be his rightful lot. The symbols depicted while traversing the Path of Peh, which joins the spheres of Fire and Water, indicate the results as it were of the first stages of the Path, for the Tarot card shown demonstrates the destruction of a Tower by lightning. The three holes blasted in the walls syrnbolise the Supernal Triad, the establishment of the divine through and following the destruction of the outer self. Though Fire and Water, warmth and moisture, are essentially creative, their stimulation within the being of the Neophyte draws his attention, perhaps for the first time, to the chaotic condition of his natural existence, and the complete psychic muddle into which his ignorance and spiritualimpotence have stranded him. Evocative of the highest within his soul, these elements equally call forth that which is base and low. The result of the first step is analytical, an unbalancing, the levelling down of all that man formerly held true and holy - the chaos, the darkness, and the Gates of the Land of Night. An unhappy state, but a very necessary one if progress is to be made and if the pre- liminary chaos is to be transcended. From these ruins may be erected the new temple of Light, for it is always from the rubbish heap that are selected the materials for the"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"32 The Golden Dawn <56> manifestation of god-head. These symbols have a dual reference. Not only do they refer to the epochs of creative evolution whose memory has long since faded even from the visible memory of nature, but also to the recapitulations of these periods within personal progress on the Path. \"The Aspirant on the threshold of Initiation,\" observes Crowley very aptly, \"finds himself assailed by the 'complexes' which have corrupted him, their externalisation excruciating him, and his agonised reluctance to their elimination plunging him into such ordeals that he seems (both to himself and to others) to have turned from a noble and upright man into an unutter- able scoundrel.\" These are the experiences and events which occur to every aspirant when initiation forces the realisation upon him that \"all is sorrow.\" In fact, it is my belief that the criterion or hall mark of successful initiation is the occurrence of these or similar experiences. The whole universe, under the stimulation of the magical elements and inward analysis, seems to tumble like a pack of cards crazily about one's feet. This is the solve half of the alchemical solve et coagula formula. Analysis must precede synthesis. Corruption is the primitive base from which the pure gold of the spirit is drawn. Moreover the alchemical treatises are eloquent in their description of the poisonous nature of this condition which, though extremely unpleasant, is a highly necessary one, and success in its production is at least one symptom of good working. It is held that the highest results may not be obtained until this particular type of change has occurred. So far as the nature of the environment and the creative power of the personal self permits, the task implied by the <57> coagula formula is to assemble them and remould them nearer to the heart's desire. And here again, the alchemists are adamant in their insistence upon the aphorism that \"Nature unaided fails.\" For the alchemist, so the tradition asserts, commences hi work where Nature has left off. And were this solve phenomenon to occur spontaneously in the course of nature, the result and the outcome - the coagulation of previously dissolved elements - would not be very dissimilar to that which previously existed. But with the technique of initiation, the chaos is lifted up and fermented so to speak, that from it, with the aid of the invoked white Light of the divine Spirit, a higher species of being, illumined and enlightened, may develop. In two Altar diagrams - one called the Garden of Eden, shown in the Practicus grade, and the other called The Fall shown in the Philosophus grade, all these ideas are expanded and synthesized. They should be carefully studied and receive long meditation, for in them are many clues to the spiritual and psychological problems which beset the traveller on the Path, and they resume the entire philosophy of Magic. Many hints, moreover, which may be found useful as assisting meditation are contained in The 'Curse'from a Philosophical Point of View in the second volume of Blavatsky's Secret Doctrine in connection with the Prometheus myth and the awaken- ing of Manas, mind. Since both of these diagrams mav be found reproduced in the body of the text very little by way of explankon need h&e be said. The first depicts a per- sonified representation of the three fundamental vrincivles in Man. Each of these is apI;arently separate, functioning independently bn its own plane without co- <58> operation with, because apparently unaware of, either the higher or the lower. Principally, it represents man in the now departed morning of the race, in the primal rounds of evolutionary effort when self-consciousness had not yet been won by self-induced and self-devised efforts, and when peace and harmony pre- vailed both within and without by right of heritage rather than through personal labour. The diagram appears in the Water grade of Practicus, since Water is a fitting representation of this placid peace. At the summit of the diagram stands the Apoca- lyptic woman clothed with the Sun of glory, crowned with the twelve stars, and the moon lying at her feet. Her symbolism pertains to the supernal essence of mind, rep- resenting thus the type and symbol of the glittering Augoeides, the Neschamah."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Introduction 33 Speaking of an analogous psychological conception in his commentary to The Secret of the Golden Flower, Dr. C. G. Jung remarks that this figure represents \"a line or principle of life that strives after superhuman, shining heights.\" At the base of the tree stands Eve, the Nephesch or unconscious who, in opposition to this divine Genius, stands for the dark, \"earthborn, feminine principle with its emotionality and instinctiveness reaching far back into the depths of time, and into the roots of physiological con- tinuity.\" Between the two stands Adam, supported by the fundamental strength of Eve, the Ruach or Ego not yet awakened to a realisation of its innate power and possibility. From the larger point of view he represents the race as a whole and \"is the personified symbol of the collective Logos, the 'Host', and of the Lords of Wisdom or the Heavenly Man, who incarnated in humanity.\" Otherwise he represents <59> the individual Candidate on the Path, prior to the awakening of the \"sleeping dogs\" within his being, to use Blavatsky's apt expression. Beneath these three figures sleeps a coiled dragon, silent, unawakened. None it would seem is aware of that latent power, titanic and promethean, coiled beneath - the active magical power centered in man, his libido, neutral, of vast potentialities but neither good nor evil in itself. Very similar in some respects is the diagram revealed in the Philosophus Grade. As the divine peace of the Garden of Eden was manifested during the Water grade, so in this Grade of Philosophus, the power of Fire is shown to have called forth catas- trophe. Formerly coiled beneath the tree, the hydra-headed dragon in this Diagram has usurped its proper place. Its several homed heads wind their way up into the very structure of the Tree of Life, even unto Daath at the foot of the Supernals. Lured downwards by the tree of knowledge - and remembering in what sense the Bible speaks of the verb \"to know,\" we gather that the root of the trouble was an imperfect apprehension of creative power - towards the \"darkly splendid world wherein con- tinually lieth a faithless depth,\" Eve, the lower self, ceases to give support to Adam. She has yielded to the awful fascination of the awakening psyche. Far easier is it to fall than to climb to the distant heights. Yet only from one viewpoint is the Fall catas- trophic. The awareness of the rise of the Dragon endows man also with consciousness of power - and power is life and progress. The Dragon stands as the symbol of the great enemy to be overcome, and, as the task of equilibration proceeds, the great prize awaiting success. <60> The Fall as a state of consciousness is analagous to that condition de- scribed by various mystics as the dark Night of the Soul. It is accompanied by a sense of intolerable dryness, a dreaded awareness of the fact that all the powers of the soul seem dead, and the mind's vision closed in dumb protest, as it were, against the harsh discipline of the Work itself. A thousand and one seductions will tend to lure the candidate from the contemplation of the magical goal, and there will be presented to him a thousand and one means of breaking in spirit his vow to \"persevere in the divine science\"without breaking it in letter. And it will appear that the mind itself will run riot and become unstable, warning the candidate that it were better for him to enjoy a lull in his magical operations. This state is allegorically referred to by the alchemists in their descriptions of the poisonous Dragon which follows upon the cor- ruption of their First Matter. Vaughan calls it: \"a horrible devouring Dragon - creep- ing and weltering in the bottom of her cave, without wings. Touch her not by any means, not so much as with thy hands, for there is not upon earth such a violent, transcendent poison.\" But as the mystics teach, if this condition be patiently endured, it passes, a higher spiritual consciousness gradually dawning in the heart and mind. So also in the alchemical writings, we find that Vaughan observes: \"As thou hast begun so proceed, and this Dragon will turn to a Swan, but more white than the hovering virgin snow when it is not yet sullied with the earth.\" The Qabalistic Sephirah of Daath is the conjunction of Chokmah and Binah on"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"34 The Golden Dawn the Tree of Life, the child of Wisdom and Understanding -knowledge. It <61> refers to the symbolic sphere formed within or above the Rmch by means of experience obtained, and this assimilated becomes transmuted into intuition and faculty of mind. But fundamentally it is the ascent of the Dragon or, if you wish, an upwelling of the Unconscious archetypes - a highly dangerous and unbalancing ascent, until they are assimilated to consciousness - which first renders Daath a possibility. It is the Fall which is responsible for the acquisition of self-knowledge. 'Thus it stands proven\" claims Blavatsky, \"that Satan, or the red Fiery Dragon, the 'Lord of Phosphorus' and Lucifer, or 'light-bearer,' is in us; it is our Mind - our temptor and Redeemer, our intelligent liberator and saviour from pure animalism\" In the evolutionary scheme, the Fall occurs through a higher type of intelligence coming into close contact with nascent humanity, thus stimulating the psyche of the race - or so the magical tradition has it. The recapitulation of this process within the individual sphere of consciousness proceeds through the technique of initiation whereby the Red Dragon is stirred into activity through contact with the fructifying powers of the elements, invoked through the skill and power of a trained initiator. The use of the divine prerogative, brought about by the magic of every-day experi- ence, the awakening of Daath, brings disaster at first because the awakened psyche is imperfectly understood and so abused for personal ends. But that very disaster and that abuse confers the consciousness of self, and is instrumental, at least in part of breaking up the primitive participation mystique. Consequently, the realisation of sorrow as it impinges on the ego, or at least the sense of personal mental and <62> emotional discomfort, and an understanding of its causes, invariably con- stitute the first impetus to perform the Great Work, even as it comprises the motive first to seek the services and aid of the analytical psychologist. This impetus and this self-consciousness are the prime implications of Daath. Its signification is a higher type of consciousness, the beginning of a spiritual rebirth. It acts as a self- evolved link between the higher Genius, on the one hand, at peace in its Supernal abode, and, on the other hand, the human soul bound by its Fall to the world of illu- sion and sense and matter. Not until that self-consciousness and acquired knowledge are turned to noble and altruistic ends, so long will sorrow and suffering be the inevit- able result. Continually will the Red Dragon, the inverted power of the eros, ravish the little kingdom of self until such time as we open ourselves to the deepest levels of our unconsciousness, reconciling and uniting them with our conscious outlook, thus conquering the foe by driving it back to its proper realm. In such a way may we use, but neither ignore nor repress, the experience of life and its fruit to transcend our own personal limitations and attain to a participation mystique on a higher and self-con- scious level. Let me quote a few especially appropriate lines from Jung in connection with this Fall, when the fundamental basis of the Ruach has been attracted to the kingdom of shells and when Malkuth has been disassociated from the other Sephiroth: \"Con- sciousness thus torn from its roots and no longer able to appeal to the authority of the primordial images, possesses a Promethean freedom, it is true, but it also partakes of the nature of a godless hybris. It soars above the earth, even above mankind, <63> but the danger of capsizing is there, not for every individual to be sure, but collectively for the weak members of such a society, who again Promethean- like, are bound by the unconscious to the Caucasus.\" For the Adept to be cut off from his roots, from contact with the vitalising and necessary basis of his Unconsciousness, will never do. He must unite and integrate the various levels of his entire Tree. His task must be to train and develop the titanic forces of his own underworld, so that they become as a powerful but docile beast whereon he may ride."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Introduction The Adeptus minor grade continues the theme of these two diagrams. Escorted into the Vault, the Asvirant is shown the lid of the Tomb of Osiris, the Pastos, wherein is buried our Father, ehristian Rosenkreutz, and on that lid is a whkh brings fulfillment as it were to the narrative of the preceding diagrams. It is divided into two sections. The lower half of the painting depicts a figuFe of idam, similar to his presen- tation in the Practicus grade diagram, though here the heads of the Dragon are fa- back from the Tree, showing the Justified One, the illuminated adept, by his immola- tion and self-sacrifice rescuing the fallen kingdom of his natural self from the clutches of an outraged eros. But above this, as though to show the true nature behind the deceptive appearance of things is illustrated a noble figure of majesty and divinity described in the Ritual in these words. \"And being turned I saw seven golden <64> Light-bearers, and in the midst of the Light-bearers, one like unto the Ben Adam, clothed with a garment down to the feet, and girt with a golden girdle. His head and his hair were white as snow, and his eyes as flaming fire; his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace. And his voice as the sound of many waters. And he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went the Sword of Flame, and his countenance was as the Sun in his strength.\" It is to effect this redemption of the personality, to regenerate the power of the dragon, and attempt to bring the individual to some realisation of his potential godhead, that is the object of the Adeptus Minor Ceremony. It is for this reason that I hold that the Golden Dawn magic, the technique of initiation, is of supreme and inestimable importance to mankind at large. In it the work of academic ~sychology may find a logic'al conclusion and fruition, s; that it may develop further its own particular contribution to modern life and culture. For this psych&magical techniqie of ceremonial initiation indicates the psychological solu- tion of the anima problem. \"Arise! Shine! For thy light is come!\" Between the grade of Philosophus and the Portal, an interval of seven months was prescribed, the regimen of the planets. During that period, devised to assist the gradual fructification of the seeds planted within, a review was advised of all the pre- ceding studies. Such a review certainly was imperative. As one of the Chiefs of the Order expressed it:-'Temember that there is hardly a circumstance in the rituals even of the First Order which has not its special meaning and application, and <65> which does not conceal a potent magical formula. These ceremonies have brought thee into contact with certain forces which thou hast now to learn to awaken in thyself, and to this end, read, study and re-read that which thou hast already received. Be not sure even after the lapse of much time that thou hast fully dis- covered all that is to be learned from these. And to be of use unto thee, this must be the work of thine own inner self, thine own and not the work of another for thee so that thou mayest gradually attain to the knowledge of the Divine Ones.\" The Grade of the Portal, which conferred upon the Candidate the title of Lord of the Paths of the Portal of the Vault of the Adepti, is not referred to a Sephirah as such. It may, however, be considered as an outer court to Tiphareth, exactly as the Adeptus Minor ceremony may be considered Tiphareth within. Its technical attribution is the element of Akasa, Spirit or Ether which is magically invoked by the usual procedure of invoking pentagrams and the vibration of divine names following upon the con- juration of the powers of the four subsidiary elements. To this grade, there is attached no elemental prayer as in the former grades, but there is one remarkable invocation employed which bears quoting here. In full Temple, the English version is not used, but it is vibrated in the original Enochian or Angelic tongue - a language which is at once sonorous, vibrant and dramatically impressive. The following is the fullversion of which an abridged one was normally used in the Temple: \"I reign over you, (here"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"3 6 The Golden Dawn the Order version names the three Archangels of the element) saith the God of Justice in power exalted above the firmament of wrath. In whose hands the Sun is as a <66> sword and the Moon as a through-thrusting fire. Who measureth your gar- ments in the midst of my vestures and trussed you together as the palms of my hands. Whose seat I garnished with the fire of gathering. Who beautified your gar- ments with admiration. To whom I made a law to govern the holy ones, and delivered you a rod with the ark of knowledge. Moreover, ye lifted up your voices and sware obedience and faith to him that liveth and triumpheth. Whose beginning is not nor end cannot be. Who shineth as a flame in the midst of your palaces and reigneth amongst you as the balance of righteousness and truth. Move therefore and show yourselves. Open the mysteries of your creation. Be friendly unto me, for 1 am the ser- vant of the same your God, a true worshipper of the Highest.\" This grade, referred to the veil Paroketh, which separates the First and Second Orders, is intermediate between the purely elemental grades and the spiritual grade of Adeptus Minor. A crown to the four lower elements, this Rite formulates above Earth, Air, Water and Fire, the uppermost point of the Pentagram, revealing the administration of the Light over and through the kingdom of the natural world. It con- u u u cerns itself with the recapitulation of the former grades, co-ordinating and equilibriat- ing the elemental self which, symbolically sacrificed upon the mysticalaltar, is offered tothe service of the higher ~enius. 1n that grade, Eoo, aspiration to the divine is strongly stressed as the faculty by which the veil of the inner sanctuary may be rent. It is the way to realisation. The five Paths leading from the grades of the First to the Second Orders are symbolically traversed, and their symbols impressed within the sphere of sensation. <67> A gestation period of at least nine months had to elapse prior to initiation to the grade of Adeptus Minor, and since there can be no misunderstanding the purpose and nature of this beautiful ceremony it requires the minimum of com- ment from my pen. It explains itself completely in one of the speeches: \"Buried with that Light in a mystical death, rising again in a mystical resurrection, cleansed and purified through him our Master, 0 Brother of the Cross of the Rose. Like him, 0 Adepts of all ages, have ye toiled. Like him have ye suffered tribulation. Poverty, tor- ture and death have ye passed through; they have been but the purification of the gold. In the alembic of thine heart through the athanor of affliction, seek thou the true stone of the wise.\" The form of this ritual is beautiful in its simplicity and warrants a brief descrip- tion. First of all, the candidate is led in, arrayed with insignia and badges and calling himself by his various titles and mottos. But he is warned that not in any vainglorious spirit are the mysteries to be approached, but in simplicity alone. This is the signal for him to be divested of all his ornaments and insignia, and by the Temple entrance, just prior to being bound upon a large upstanding cross of wood, he stands alone, clad in a simple unornamented black gown. The reader is earnestly recommended to study this Ritual again and again, until almost it becomes a part of his very life, incorporated into the fabric of his being, for herein are highly important and significant formulae of mystical aspiration and of practical magic. In it is exemplified the technical \"Dying God formula about which in The Golden Bough Frazer has written so eloquently. Examples of this are to be found in every mythology and every mystical <68> religion that our world has ever known. But I doubt that it has ever attained to a more clarified and definite espression than in this ceremony of the Adeptus Minor grade. For we are clearly taught by precept and by example that we are, in essence, gods of great power and spirituality who died to the land of our birth in the Garden of Hesperides, and mystically dying descended into hell. And moreover the ritual demonstrates that like Osiris, Christ, and Mithra, and many another type of god-man, we too may rise from the tomb and become aware of our true divine"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Introduction 3 7 natures. The principal clause of the lengthy Obligation assumed while bound to the cross, indicating the trend of its teaching, and the import of its objective, is: \"I further solemnly promise and swear that, with the Divine permission, I will from this day for- ward apply myself unto the Great Work, which is so to purify and exalt my spritual nature that with Divine aid I may at length attain to be more than human and thus gradually raise and unite myself to my higher and divine Genius, and that in this event, I will not abuse the great power entrusted to me.\" The preface to the assumption of the obligation is under these circumstances a tremendously impressive occurrence, and few could fail to be even faintly moved by it. It consists of an invocation of an Angelic power: \"In the divine name IAO, I invoke Thee thou great avenging Angel HUA, that thou mayest invisibly place thy hand upon the head of this Aspirant in attestation of his obligation. . .\" It is not difficult to realise that this is a critical and important phase of the ceremony. During this obligation, because of the symbolism attached to it and because of the active aspiration which is induced at this juncture, illumination <69> may quite easily occur. In one of the documents describing certain effects ensuing from this initiation, one of the Chiefs has written,that the object of the ceremony conceived as a whole \"is especially intended to effect the change of the con- sciousness into the Neschamah, and there are three places where this can take place. The first is when the aspirant is on the cross, because he is so exactly fulfilling the sym- bol of the abnegation of the lower self and the Union with the higher.\" The Obligation assumed, the candidate is now removed from the cross, and the Officers then narrate to him the principal facts in the history of the founder of the Order - Christian Rosenkreutz. On a previous page was given a summary of these historical facts. When the History lecture mentions the discovery of the Vaultwherein the Tomb and body of the illustrious Father were discovered, one of the initiating adepts draws aside a curtain, admitting the candidate to a chamber erected in the midst of the Temple similar to that described in the lecture. A few words roughly de- scribing it may not be considered amiss. As a climax to the very simple Temple fumi- ture of the Outer grades, it comes as a psychological spasm and as a highly significant symbol. The vault itself is a small seven-sided chamber, each side representing one of the seven planets, with their host of magical correspondences. The mediaeval Rosi- crucian manifesto the Fama Fraternitatis, translated in Arthur Edward Waite's Real His- twy of theRosicrucians, describes it at great length, though I shall here quote but briefly: \"We opened the door, and there appeared to our sight a vault of seven sides and seven - comers, every side five fddt broad and thcheight of eight foot. Although the <70> sun never shined in this vault, nevertheless it was enlightened with another Sun, which had learned this from the sun, and was situated in the upper part of the centre of the ceiling. In the midst, instead of a tomb-stone, was a round altar.. . Now, as we had not yet seen the dead body of our careful and wise Father, we therefore removed the altar 'aside; then we lifted up a strong plate of brass, and found a fair and worthy body, whole and unconsumed. . . .\" Around this fundamental symbolism, the Golden Dawn adepts, displaying a genius of extraordinary insight and synthesis, had built a most awe-inspiring super- structure. The usual Order symbolism of the Light was represented by a white triangle centred by the Rose - this placed upon the ceiling. The floor design was so painted as to represent the Red Dragon and the forces of the primitive archetypes upon which the candidate trod as emblematic of his conquest. Placed in the centre of the Vault was the Pastos of Rosenkreutz - though the Pastos is also referred to as the Tomb of Osiris the Justified One. Both of these beings may be considered as the type and symbol of the higher and divine Genius. Immediately above this coffin rested the circular altar mentioned in the Fama. It bore paintings of the Kerubic emblems, and upon these were placed the four elemental weapons and a cross, the symbol of"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"38 The Golden Dawn resurrection. At one point in the ceremony, the acting Hierophant, or Chief Adept as he is now called, is interred in the Pastos as though to represent the aspirant's higher Self which is hidden and confined within the personality, itself wandering blindly, lost in the dark wilderness. The whole concatenation of symbols is an elaborate and dramatic portrayal of the central theme of the Great Work. In a word, it depicts <71> the spiritual rebirth or redemption of the candidate, his resurrection from the dark tomb of mortality through the power of the holy Spirit. In the symbol of the Vault, the psychologist no doubt will see a highly interesting and complex array of Mother symbols, traces of which, used in very much the same way, may be found in the literary fragments we inherit from the mystery cults of an- tiquity. It would be possible, and quite legitimate so to interpret the Vault. For even the Order interpretation refers the Vault in its entirety to the Isis of Nature, the great and powerful mother of mankind and all that is. And an analysis of the separate parts of the Vault - the Venus door, the Pastos, the two Pillars - would subscribe to that view. For regeneration and the second birth have always as creative psychological states been associated with the Mother. And it may be recalled that the Neschamah or that principle in man which constantly strives for the superhuman shining heights, is always portrayed as a feminine principle, passive, intuitive and alluring. Whilst the universal counterpart of this human principle, represented on the Tree of Life by the Supernals, is always described by the mediaeval alchemists as a virginal figuie, from whose life and substance all things have issued, and through whose agency man is brought to the second birth. The reader is earnestly recommended to study this Ritual again and again until almost it becomes a part of his very life, incorporated into the very fabric of his being. Very little aesthetic appreciation will be required to realise that in this and the other rituals are passages of divine beauty and high eloquence. And the least <72> learned will find ideas of especial appeal to him, as the scholar and the pro- found mystic will perceive great depth and erudition in what may appear on the surface as simple statement. Properly performed, with initiated technique and insight, these rituals are stately ceremonies of great inspiration and enlightenment. The apparent complexity of the above delineated scheme may be thought by some individuals to be entirely too complicated for modern man and not sufficiently simple in nature. While one can deeply sympathise with the ideas of the extreme sim- plicity cult in Mysticism, nevertheless it is evident that the complex and arduous nature of the routine is no fault of Magic. Man himself is responsible for this awkward situation. To be purified was considered by the alchemists and the Theurgists of a bygone day as not nearly enough. That purification and consecration was required to be repeated and repeated, again and again. Because of countless centuries of evolu- tion and material development - sometimes in quite false directions - man has spiritually repressed himself, and thus gradually forgotten his true divine nature. Meanwhile, as a sort of compensation for this loss, he has developed a complexity of physical and psychic constitution for dealing adequately with the physical world. Hence, methods of spiritual development refusing to admit the reality of that many- principled organisation may not be recognised as valid, for the sole reason that man is not a simple being. Fundamentally and at root he may be simple; but in actuality he is not. Having strayed from his roots, and lost his spiritual birthright in a jungle of delu- sion, it is not always easy to re-discover those roots or to find the way out from the Gates of the Land of Night. <73> In contradistinction to the above mentioned type of amorphous mystical doctrine, Magic does recognise the many-faceted nature of man. If that intri- cate structure so painfully constructed be considered an evil, as some seem to think, it is a necessary evil. It is one to be faced and used. Therefore Magic connives by its technique to use, develop, and improve each of these several principles to its highest"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Introduction 39 degree of perfection. \"Thou must prepare thyself\" councils Vaughan \"till thou art conformable to Him Whom thou wouldst entertain, and that in every respect. Fit thy roof to thy Godin what thoucanst, and in what thou canst not He will help thee. When thou hast thus set thy house in order, do not think thy Guest will come without invita- tion. Thou must tire Him out with pious importunities. Perpetual knockings at His door, Tears sullying his transparent rooms, Sighs upon sighs; weep more and more- He comes. This is the way thou must walk in, which if thou dost thou shall perceive a sudden illustration, and there shall then abide in thee fire with light, wind with fire, power with wind, knowledge with power, and with knowledge an integrity of sober mind!\" Not enough is it to be illuminated. The problem is not quite as simple as that. It is in vain that the wine of the Gods is poured into broken bottles. Each part of the soul, each elemental aspect of the entire man must be strengthened and transmuted and brought into equilibrium and harmony with the others. Integration must be <74> the rule of the initiate, not pathology. In such a vehicle made consecrate and truly holy by this equilibriation, the higher Genius may find a worthy and fit dwelling. This and this alone, may ever constitute the true nature of initiation. With each of the grades just described, a certain amount of personal work was provided, principally of a theoretical kind. The basic ideas of the Qabalah were impar- ted by means of so-called knowledge lectures, together with certain important sym- bols and si@cant names in Hebrew were required to be memorised. The lamens -insignia worn over the heart - of the various Officers were referred in divers ways to the Tree of Life, thus explaining after a fashion the function of that particular office in the Temple of Initiation. Each path traversed, and every grade entered, had a so- called Admission Badge. This usually consisted of one of the many forms of the Cross, and of symbols of the type of the Swastika, truncated Pyramid, and so forth. To these astrological and elemental attributions were referred. Most of these symbols possess great value, and since they repeatedly recur under different guises through the stages of personal magical work undertaken after the Adeptus Minor grade, they should receive the benefit of prolonged brooding and meditation. Three of the most important items of personal study to be accomplished while in the First or Outer Order, apart from the memorisation of the rudiments of the Qabalah were: (a) The practice of the Pentagram Ritual with the Qabalistic <75> Cross, (b) Tattwa Vision, and (c) Divination by Geomancy and the simple Tarot method described by Waite in his Key to the Tarot. The Pentagram Ritual was taught to the Neophyte immediately after his initia- tion in order that he might \"form some idea of how to attract and come into com- munication with spiritual and invisible things.\" Just as the Neophyte Ceremony of admission contains the essential symbolism of the Great Work, shadowing forth sym- bolically the commencement of certain formulae of the Magic of Light, so potential within the Pentamam Ritual and the Oabalistic Cross are the e~itomes of the whole of that work. Inall Gagical procedure it fundamental, for it is a iesture of upraising the human consciousness to its own root of perfection and enlightenment by which the sphere of sensation and every act performed under its surveillance are sanctified. Thus it should precede every phase of magical work, elementary as well as advanced. The written rubric has previously appeared in my Tree of Life, and I may now add a word or two concerning the further directions which are orally imparted to the Can-"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"40 The Golden Dawn didate after his admission. The prime factor towards success in that exercise is to imagine that the astral form is capable of expansion, that it grows tall and high, until at length it has the sem- blance of a vast angelic figure, whose head towers amongst the distant stars of heaven. When this imaginative expansion of consciousness produces the sense that the height is enormous, with the Earth as a tiny globe revolving beneath the feet, then above the head should be perceived or formulated a descending ray of brilliant Light. As the candidate marks the head and then the breast, so should this brilliance <76> descend, even down to his feet, a descending shaft of a gigantic cross of Light. , The act of marking the shoulders right and left whilst vibrating the Sephirotic names, traces the horizontal shaft of the cross, equilibriating the Light within the sphere of sensation. Since it has been argued above that the Great Work consists in the search for the Light, this ritual truly and completely performed leads to the accom- plishment of that Work and the personal discovery of the Light. The Pentagrams trace a cleansing and protecting circle of force invoked by the four Names of four letters each about the limits of the personal sphere, and the archangels are called, by vibra- tion, to act as great stabilising influences. The study of the different types of divination may seem difficult to understand in an Order which purported to teach methods of spiritual development. Many will no doubt be rather perplexed by this. Divinationusually is said to refer exclusively to the low occult arts, to fortune-telling, and the prognostication of the future. Actually, however, so far as the Order is concerned, the principal object for these practical methods is that they stimulate, as few exercises can, the faculties of clairvoyance, imagination, and intuition. Though certain readings or interpretations to the geo- mantic and Tarot symbols may be found in the appropriate text books, these rule of thumb methods do not conduce to the production of an accurate delineation of the spiritual causes behind material events. These interpretations are usual to the begin- ner in the art, for he requires a foundation of the principal definitions employed upon which his own meditations can build. These textual delineations in actual <77> practice serve only as a base for the working of the inner faculties, provides for them a thrust-block as it were from which they may \"kick-off.\" In short, the effort to divine by these methods calls into operation the intuitive and imaginative faculties to a very large extent. Everyone without exception has this faculty of divin- ing in some degree, varying only in his ability to make it manifest. In most people it is wholly dormant. Again, while divination as an artificial process may be wholly unnecessary and a hindrance to the refined perceptions of a fully developed Adept, who requires no such convention to ascertain whence a thing comes and whither it is going, yet these aids and stimuli have their proper place for the Neophyte. For those in training they are not only legitimate but useful and necessary. It may be interesting for the reader to attempt to acquire intuitive knowledge on any matter without the divinatory aids first, and it will be seen how extremely difficult it is to get started, to pick upon any one fact or incident which shallact as a prompt or a starter of the interior mechanism. Hav- ing failed in this way, let him see how much further he really may go by the judicious and sensible use of one of the Order methods. There is no doubt that the opening of the mind to an intuitive perception is considerably aided by these methods. And this is particularly true with regard to the rather lengthy Tarot method which was given to the initiate while engaged in the fulfilment of his Adeptus Minor curriculum. Like all magical techniques,>iGnation is open to abuse. The fict, however, that abuse is poss- ible does not, as again and again must be reiterated, fully condemn the abused tech- nique. The application of ckon sense to the magical art is as necessary as it is to all else. <78> There was a movement on foot in one of the Temples a little while ago to"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"eliminate the study and practice of Geomancy from the scheme of training of the Outer Order. The prevailing tendency is so to simplify the road to Adeptship as to reduce the practical requisites to an absolute minimum by eliminating every phase of the work which does not come \"naturally,\" and whose study might involve hard work. Most of the newly admitted candidates to this Temple within the past five years or more are utterly without any practical acquaintance with this technique. Originally, Astrology was taught as part of the regular routine. All instruction on this subject seems now to have been thoroughly extirpated from the Order papers. Perhaps in this particular instance the omission is just as well. For recent years have seen a great deal of meticulous attention paid to this study by sincere and honest researchers, and there have been published many first-rate books explaining its intricacies. All that the Order demands of the Adeptus Minor is that he should be able to draw up a map showing the position of Planets and Signs, preparatory to certain operations requiring the invocation of Zodiacal forces. Tattwa vision requires but little mention in this place, for full instructions in this technical method of acquiring clairvoyance may be seen a later volume. They are comviled from a number of documents and verbal instructions obtainine within the Ordlr. Since these oral \"tid-bits\" and papers were very scattered, it hasvbeen found necessary to reorganise the whole matter. In that restatement, however, I have exer- cised no originality nor uttered personal viewpoints on any phase of the <79> technique, confining my labour solely to re-writing the material in my posses- sion. It may be interesting for the psychological critic to reflect upon the fact that it was this technique to which most members of the Order devoted the greatest attention - the only technique in which, more than any other single branch of the work, there is greater opportunity for deception and self-deception. While in many ways the Order technique may appear different from the vision method described in my Tree of Life, both are essentially the same. For they teach the necessity of an imaginative formation of an intellectual or astral form, the Body of Light, for the pur- pose of exploring the different regions of the Tree of Life or the several strata of one's own psychic make-up. The simpler aspects of this investigation are taught just after the grade of Philosophus, though naturally the full possibilities of this method and the complete details on the technical side do not reveal themselves until the teaching of the Second Order has been received. In addition to these technical methods there were meditations on the symbols and ideas of the whole system, and it was quite frequently suggested that the student go through the ceremonies, after having taken the grades, and build them up in his imagination so that he re-lives them as vividly as when he was in the Temple. The practical exercise that accompanied the Portal grade was one in which the aspirant built up, again in the imagination, a symbolic form of the Qabalistic Tree of Life, pay- ing at first particular attention to the formulation of the Middle Pillar in the sphere of sensation or aura. This latter was conceived to be an ovoid shape of subtle <80> matter, and the imaginative formulation of the various Sephiroth therein whilst vibrating the appropriate Divine Names went far towards opening, in a safe and balanced way, the psycho-spiritual centres of which the Sephiroth were but symbols. This technique, with the so-called Vibratory Formula of the Middle Pillar which is a development therefrom, I consider to be one of the most important practi- cal systems employed in the Order. Though the documents describe it in a very rudimentary and sketchy fashion, nevertheless it is capable of expansion in several quite astonishing directions. I have discussed and expanded this technique at con- siderable length in my book The Art of True Healing. So far, I have confined myself to a bird's eye view of the routine as established in the First or Outer Order of the Golden Dawn. The graduated training of the entire Outer was intended as a preparation for the practical work to be performed in the"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"42 The Golden Dawn Inner or Second Order of the Roseae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis. The assignation of personal magical work seems deliberately to have been postponed until after the Vault reception. It was held that the Ceremony formulated a link between the Aspirant and his Augoeides, that connection serving therefore as a guide and a powerful protection which is clearly required in the works of Ceremonial Magic. Since at the commencement of each serious operation the Initiate must needs exalt himself towards his higher and divine Genius that through him may flow the divine power which alone is capable of producing a pure magical work, the initial forging of that link is a matter of supreme importance. Let me now detail the curriculum of work prescribed in the Second <81> Order. The training of the Adeptus Minor consisted of eight separate items, and I quote the following from a syllabus \"A-General Orders,\" now in circulation. \"Part One. A. Preliminary. Receive and copy: Notes on the Obligation. The Rit- ual of the @= Grade. The manuscript, Sigils from the Rose. The Minutum Mundum. Having made your copies of these and returned the originals you should study them in order to prepare to sit for the written examination. You must also arrange with the Adept in whose charge you are,about your examination in the Temple on the practical work.\" \"Part Two. Receive the Rituals of the Pentagram and Hexagram. Copy and learn them. You can now sit for the written examination in these subjects and complete 'A' by arranging to be tested in your practical knowledge in the Temple. \"Part One. B. Implements. Receive the Rituals of the Lotus Wand, Rose Cross, Sword, and the Elemental Weapons. Copy and return them. There is a written exam- ination on the above subjects - that is on the construction, symbolism, and use of these objects, and the general nature of a consecration ceremony and the forming of invocations. This can be taken before the practical work of making is begun or at any stage during it. \"Part Two. This consists in the making of the Implements which must be passed as suitable before the consecration is arranged for, in the presence of a Chief or other qualified Adept. The making and consecration are done in the order given abwe unless it is preferred to do all the practical work first, and make arrangements for con- secration as convenient. <82> \"Part One. G. Neophyte Formulae. Receive and copy Z. 1. on the symbols and formulae of the Neophyte Ritual. Z. 3, the symbolism of the Neophyte in this Ceremony. Copy the God-form designs of the Neophyte Ritual. The written examination on the Z. manuscripts may now be taken. \"Part Two. To describe to the Chief or other suitable Adept in the Temple the arrangement of the Astral Temple and the relative position of the Forms in it. To build up any God-form required, using the correct Coptic Name.\" The above three sections, A. B. G., completed the course prescribed for the Zelator Adeptus Minor, the first sub-grade.

The sole omissions are the documents lettered H. J. L. and part of M. \"J\" consists simply of an elaborated commentary upon the Adeptus Minor Obligation, written in a florid ponderous style reminiscent of Eliphas Levi-cum- Arthur Edward Waite. \"H Clavicula Tabularum Enochi, is a more or less lengthy manuscript, turgid"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"44 The Golden Dawn and archaic, for the most part repeating, though not as clearly, the contents of \"S, The Book of the Concourse of the Forces.\" Incidentally, this document is practically a ver- batim duplicate of part of a lengthy manuscript to be found in the Manuscript Library of the British Museum, Sloane 307. A good deal of the advice given is typically mediaeval, and definitely unsound from a spiritual viewpoint, and is certainly not in accord with the general lofty tenor of the remaining Order teaching. It explains how to find precious metals and hidden treasure, and how to drive away the elemental guardians thereof. It is an inferior piece of work - as also is the document \"J-.\", and so I have decided to omit both. \"M\" has two sections, the Hermes Vision which I do propose to give, and the Lineal Fimres of the Sevhiroth. Because of the extreme comvlexitv of the latter, and because ;will be imposiible to reproduce the several geome&cal drawings in coldur which accomvanv that manuscrivt. the writer has deemed it sufficient to restate it in a I J I, general manner as a note to the instruction on Telesmatic Images. <86> The whole of the above decribed material I have arranged and classified in an entirely different way. The contents of these volumes will be found divided up into so many chapters or separate books, each complete by itself. And the material in each book will be seen to be consistent and appertain to parts of the magi- cal technique which are placed with it. The Table of cdn'ents desckbes my methGd of arrangement. Clearly from these disclosures there may be drastic results. But the good, I trust, will immeasurably and ultimately outweigh whatever evil may come. That some care- less people will hurt themselves and bum their fingers experimenting with matters not wholly understood seems almost inevitable. Theirs, however, will be the fault. For the formulae of Magic require intensive study prior to experimental work. And since all the important formulae are given in their entirety, and nothing withheld that is of the least value, there should be no excuse for anybody harming himself. No serious hurt should come to anyone. On the contrary, the gain to those serious students of Magic and Mysticism who have initiative and yet refuse to involve themselves with corrupt occult orders, and it is to these that I fain would speak, should be im- measurable. You are being given a complete system of attainment. This you must study and develop at your own leisure, appyling it in your own particular way. The system is complete and effectual, as well as noble. The grade rituals as I shall reproduce them have been tampered with, in some cases unintelligently. Their efficacy, however, is not impaired, for the principal portion of those grade rituals, which teaches <87> the art of invocation, is intact. So that the unwise editing that they have received in the past several years has not actually damaged them; all that has been removed are a few items, more or less important, of Qabalistic knowledge. If the reader feels that these might be value to him, and for the sake of tolerable complete- ness would lie to have them, by studying such Qabalistic texts as the Zohar and the Sepher Yehirah both of which are now in English translation, or some such work as Waite's Holy Kaballah, he will be in possession of the fundamental facts. It is in other parts of the Order work that injudicious tampering has been at work. Most of this is now restored and I believe that this book is an accurate representation of the whole of the Order work from Neophyte to Theoricus Adeptus Minor. Some portions of the manuscripts have required editing, principally from the literary point of view. Whole paragraphs have had to be deleted, others shortened, sentences made more clear, the redundant use of many words eliminated, and a general coordination of the manuscripts undertaken. Certain other sections - those dealing at length with Talismans, Sigils, Clairvoyance, Geomancy and the Enochian Tablets - have been completely rewritten to render them more coherent. But noth- ing that is essential or vital to the magical tenor or understanding of any document"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Introduction will be omitted, changed oraltered. This I avow and publicly swear. Where personally I have seen fit to make comment on any matter in order to clarify the issue or to indi- cate its antecedents, or connections in other parts of the work, that comment or remark is so marked by me with initials. <88> Let me therefore urge upon the sincere reader whose wish it is to study this magical system, to pay great attention to the scheme of the grade rituals, to obtain a bud's eye view of the whole, to study every point, its movement and teach- ing. This should be repeated again and again, until the mind moves easily from one point of the ritual to another. The synthetic outline of those rituals presented in this Introduction should be found helpful as assisting in this task. Let him also study the diagrams of the Temple lay-out, and build up in his imagination a clear and vivid pic- ture of that Temple together with the appropriate officers and their movements. Then it will be an easy matter to devise a simple form of self-initiation. It will be simple to adapt the text to solo performance. But a careful scrutiny and examination of the entire system should long precede any effort to do practical work, if serious harm and danger is to be avoided. The language needs first of all to be mastered, and the sym- bolic ideas of the whole system assimilated and incorporated into the very fibre of one's being. Intellectual acquaintance with every aspect of the subject is just as necessary as personal integrity and selfless devotion to an ideal. Sincerity is indeed the most trustworthy shield and buckler that any student may possess, but if he neglects the intellectual mastery of the subject, he will soondiscover where his heel of Achilles is located. But these two combined are the only safeguards, the fundamental requisites to an insight into the significance of Magic. Not only are they the only sure foundation, but they conduce to the continual recollection of the goal at the end, which understanding arises through penetrating to the root of the matter, without which the student may stray but too readily from the narrow way stretching <89> before him. No matter how brilliant his intellectual capacity, no matter how ardent his sincerity or potent his dormant magical power, always must he remember that they matter absolutely in no way unless applied to the Great Work - the knowledge and conversation of the Higher and Divine Genius. \"Power without wisdom,\"said a poet, \"is the name of Death.\" And as Frater D. D. C. F. so rightly said of one phase of magical work, but which has its application to the whole scheme, \"Know thou that this is not to be done lightly for thine amusement or experiment, seeing that the forces of Nature were not created to be thy plaything or toy. Unless thou doest thy practical magical works with solemnity, ceremony and reverence, thou shalt be like an infant playing with fire, and thou shalt bring destruction upon thyself.\" In devia- tion from these injunctions lie the only actual dangers in the divine science. One of the essentials of preliminary work, is the committing to memory of the important correspondences and attributions. And I cannot insist too strongly that this is fundamentaL The student must make himself familiar first of all with the Hebrew Alphabet, and learn how to write the names of the Sephiroth and Deity Names in that tongue -he will realise their value when he approaches the practical work of invoca- tion. Much time should be spent studying and meditating upon the glyph of the Tree of Life and memorising all the important attributions - divine Names, names of Archangels, Angels and Spheres and elements. All the symbols referred to the lamens of the officers should be carefully meditated upon, as also the various <90> admission badges, and other symbols given in the knowledge lectures. Above all, a great deal of time and attention should be paid to the Middle Pillar technique and the Vibratory Formulae of divine names. The student can easily adapt any fair-sized room to the exigencies of a Temple. The writer has worked in one hardly larger than a long cupboard, about ten feet long by six or seven wide. All furniture from the centre should be cleared away, leaving a central space in which one may freely move and work A small table covered with a"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"46 The Golden Dawn blackcloth will suffice for the Altar, and the two Pillars may be dispensed with but for- mulated in the imagination as present. He may find it very uskful to paint flashing Angelic Tablets according to the instructions found elsewhere, as well as the Banners of tvhe East and West, pla&g these in the appropriate cardinal quarters of his impro- vised Temple. If he is able to obtain small plaster-casts of the heads of the Kerubirn - the lion, the eagle, bull and man - and place these in the proper stations, they will be found together with the Tablets to impart a considerable amount of magical vitality and atmosphere to the Temple. What actually they do bestow is rather subtle, and perhaps indefinable. They are not absolute essentials, however, and may be dis- pensed with. But since Magic works by the intervention of symbol and emblem, the surrounding of the student's sphere with the correct forms of magical symbolism, assists in the imvressiner of those svrnbols within the aura or sphere of sensation, the true magical ~eA~le. Th-is may be 6ft to the ingenium and the Sonvenience of the-stu- dent himself to discover after having made a close examination of the documents involved. <91> Another matter upon which brief comment must be made concerns the Instruments. It would have given me great pleasure to have had illustrations of these reproduced in colour, for only thus can one appreciate their significance and the part they play in ceremonial. But this unfortunately has not been possible. Thus they are given only in black and white, which obviously cannot impart anything but the merest fraction of their actual beauty and suggestiveness. And I impress upon the serious student, even implore him, to betake upon himself the trouble of making these instruments himself. They are very simple to fashion. And the results obtained, to say little of the knowledge acquired or the intuitive processes that somehow are stimulated by that effort, are well worth even a great deal of bother. To adopt tem- porarily part. of the terminology now current among analytical psychologists, and identify the latent spiritual self of man with what is known as the Unconscious, then be it remembered that this vast subterranean stream of vitality and memory and inspiration can only be reached by means of a symbol. For the latter, states Jung, \"is the primitive expression of the Unconscious, while on the other hand it is an idea cor- responding to the highest intuition produced by consciousness.\" Thus these wea- pons and magical instruments are symbolic representations of psychic events, of forces inhering within the potentiality of the inner man. By means of their personal manufacture, magical consecration and continual employment they may be made to affect and stimulate the dormant side of man's nature. It is aninteresting fact that in his practice, Jung encouraged his patients to paint symbolic designs which some- <92> times were comparable to the Eastern mandalas. It seems that the effort to paint these designs had the effect of straightening out stresses and knots in the unconscious, thus accomplishing the therapeutic object of the analysis. And not only were they thus means of self-expression but these designs produced a counter-effect of fascinating, healing and stimulating to renewed activity the hitherto unmani- fested psyche. With the exception that the ordinary magical student is not neurotic or psy- chopathic, the techniques are rather similar. For the magical tradition has always insisted upon the routine to be followed by the aspirant to that art. He was required to fashion the implements himself, and the more laborious he found that task, with the greater difficulties thrown before him, by so much more were those efforts of spiritual value. For not only are these instruments symbols or expressions of inner realities, but what is infinitely more of practical worth, their actual projection in this way from within outwards, the physical fashioning and painting of these instruments, also works an effect. They bring to life the man that was asleep. They react upon their maker. They become powerful magical agents, true talismans of power. Thus, the Lotus Wand is declared in the Ritual to have the colours of the twelve"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Introduction 4 7 signs of the Zodiac painted on its stem, and it is surmounted by the Lotus flower of Isis. It symbolises the development of creation The Wand has ever been a symbol of the magical Will, the power of the spirit in ation. And its description in the instruc- tion on the Lotus Wand is such that it is seen to embrace the whole of nature - the Sephiroth, the spiritual aspects of the elements, and the action of the Sun <93> upon all life by a differentiating process. Even as the whole of nature is the embodiment of a dynamic will, the visible form and vehicle of a spiritual con- sciousness. The Lotus flower grows from the darkness and gloom of the secret depths, through the waters, ever striving to open its blossoms on the surface of the waters to the rays of light of the Sun. So is the true magical or spiritual will secreted within the hidden depths of the soul of man. Unseen, sometimes unknown and unsuspected, it lies latent though the whole of the life. By these rites of Magic, its sym- bols and exercises, we are enabled to assist its growth and development, by piercing through the outer husks of the restricting shell, until it bursts into full bloom - the flower of the human spirit, the Lotus of the higher Soul. \"Look for the flower to bloom in the silence.. . It shall grow, it will shoot up, it will make branches and leaves and form buds while the storm continues, while the battle lasts. . . It is the flower of the soul that has opened.\" Note, moreover, the descrivtion of and the comment made bv Jung to a sym601ic design brought to him by oneof his patients, evidently a desi& like to the Lotus Wand, for he savs: \"The vlant is freauentlv a structure in brilliant fierv colours and is shown bowing but of a Led of darkss ind carrying the blossom df light at the top, a symbol similar to the Christmas tree.\" This is highly suggestive, and students both of Yoga and Magic will find in this curious indications of the univer- sality of cogent sym601s. ~agical processes and symbols are, in short, receiving con- firmation at the hands of experimental psychology. It remains for the reader to benefit thereby. <94> The Rose-Cross is a Lamen or badge synthesising a vast concourse of ideas, representing in a single emblem the Great Work itself - the har- monious reconciliation in one symbol of diverse and apparently contradictory con- cepts, the reconciliation of divinity and manhood. It is a highly important symbol to be wom over the heart during every important operation It is a glyph, in one sense, of the higher Genius to whose knowledge and conversation the student is eternally aspiring. In the Rituals it is described as the Key of Sigils and Rituals. The Sword is a weapon symbolising the critical dispersive faculty of the mind. It is used where force and strength are required, more particularly for banishing than for invoking - as though conscious intellection were allied to the vower of Will. When empLyed in certain magical ceremonies with the point upwarhs, its nature is transformed into an instrument similar to the Wand. The Elemental weavons of the Wand, Cup, Dagger, and Pentacle are symbolical representations of the forces em- ployed for the manifestation of the inner self, the elements required for the incama- tion of the divine. They are attributed to the four letters of Tetragrammaton All of these are worth making, and by creating them and continually employing them intelligently in the ways shown by the various rituals, the student will find a new power developing within him, a new centre of life building itself up from within. One last word of caution. Let me warn the student against attempting difficult and complex ceremonies before he has mastered the more simple ones. The syllabus provided on a former page for the use of the Minor Adept grades the work <95> rather well. The consecration ceremonies for the magical implements are, of their kind, excellent examples of ceremonial work Classical in nature, they are simple in structure and operation, and provide a harnionious and easily flowing ritual. A good deal of experience should be obtained with the constant use of these and similar types which the student should himself cor:struct along these lines. A"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"48 The Golden Dawn variety of things may occur to his mind for which a variety of operations may be per- formed. This of course, applies only to that phase of his studies when the preliminary correspondences and attributions have been thoroughly memorised and what is more, understood, and when the meditations have been performed. This likewise is another matter upon which too much emphasis cannot be laid. Above all, the Pentagram and Hexagram rituals should be committed to memory so that no effort is required to recall at a moment's notice the points or angles of these figures from which the invocation of a certain force commences. Short ceremonies should be devised having as their object the frequent use of these lineal figures so that they become a part of the very manner in which the mind works during ceremonial. After some time has elapsed, and after considerable experience with the more simple consecration formulae, the student feeling more confident of himself and his ritualis- tic capacity, let him turn to the complex ceremonies whose formulae are summarised in the m&uscripts Z. 2. These req;ire much preparation, intensive study, and a great deal of rehearsal and ex~erience. Moreover. he must not be disa~vointed if, at first, the results fall s'hort of his anticipi&ions. Persistence is'A admirable ancl <96> necessary virtue, particularly in Magic. And let him endeavour to penetrate into the reasons for the apparent worthlessness or puerility of the aims of these formulae, such as transformation, evocation, invisibility, by reflection on the spiritual forces which must flow through him in order to effect such ends. And let him beware of the booby trap which was set up in the Order - of doing but one of these ceremonies, or superficially employing any phase of the system as though to pass an examination, and considering in consequence that he is the master of the technique.

There are, however, two prinapal ones which should be mentioned. The Ashkenazic, a dialect mostly in emplpt in Germany,Poland, and Russia; and the Sephardic used in Spain, Portugal, and the editerranean general1 . Now since the Qabalah attained its prominence in S ain, most ~abalists have employed the%phardic dialect. Personally I have found that the Ashtenazic dialect answers more nearly than the other to the requirements of transliteration into English, and many roblems that have assailed modem students would have beennon-existent had they known oFthe pronunciation which1 employed in my former works. Actually, however, students must discover which of these two suits his own personal predilection and answers to the necessity imposed by the results of study and experience. The Order teaching em loys the Sephardic ronunciation, and I havenot ventured tolnterfere with that in any way at g. I simply mention Jematterhere to render impossible the likelihood of confusion arising.

Keep this state for a few minutes at first-and for longer as you get more used to preventing the mind from wandering. Think now of the subject for meditation in a general way-then choose out one thought or image and follow that to its conclusion. The simplest rhythm for the beginner is the Fourfold Breath. 1. Empty the lungs and remain thus while counting 4. 2. Inhale, counting 4 so that you feel filled with breath to the throat. 3. Hold this breath while counting 4. 4. Exhale, counting 4 till the lungs are empty. This should be practised, counting slowly or quickly till you obtain a rhythm that suits you-one that is comforting and stilling. Having attained this, count the breath thus for two or three minutes, till you feel quiet, and then proceed with the meditation. <106> THE QABALISTIC CROSS AND LESSER RITUAL OF THE PENTAGRAM Take a steel dagger in the right hand.

As a form of prayer the invoking ritual should be used in the morning, the banishing in the evening. Invoking The NAMES should be pronounced inwardly in the breath vibrating it as much as possible and feeling that the whole body throbs with the sound and sends out a wave of vibration directed to the ends of the quarter. 2. As a protection against impure magnetism, the Banishing Ritual can be used to get rid of obsessing or disturbing thoughts. Give a mental image to your obsession and imagine it formulated before you. Project it out of your aura with the Saluting Sign of a Neophyte, and when it is about three feet away, prevent its return with the Sign of Silence. Now imagine the form in the East before you and do the Banishing Rit- ual of the Pentagram to disintegrate it, seeing it, in your mind's eye, dis- solving on the further side of your ring of flame. 3. It can be used as an exercise in concentration. Seated in meditation or lying down, formulate yourself standing up in robes and holding a dagger. Put your consciousness in this form and go to the East. <log' Make yourself \"feel\" there by touching the wall, opening your eyes, stamping on the floor, etc."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"First Knowledge Lecture 55 Begin the Ritual and go round the room mentally vibrating the words and trying to feel them as coming from the form. Finish in the East and try to see your results in the Astral Light, then walk back and stand behind the head of your body and let yourself be re- absorbed. (In the introduction, page 106, I have given instructions for the per- formance of the Qabalistic Cross. When tracing the Pentagrams, the imagina- tion should be exerted to visualize them as flaming stars all about one. The impression should be of a fire ring studded in four places with stars of flame. Likewise, when vibrating the angelic names, the student should endeavour to imagine four vast towering figures about him. But see further in my book ''The Middle Pillar.\" 1.R) <110> THE PILLARS In the explanation of the Symbols of the Grade of Neophyte, your atten- tion has been directed to the general mystical meaning of the Two pillars called in the Ritual the \"Pillars of Hermes\" of \"Seth\" and of \"Solomon.\" In the 9th chapter of the Ritual of the Dead they are referred to as the \"Pillars of Shu,\" the \"l'illars of the Gods of the Dawning Light,\" and also as \"the North and Southern Columns of the Gate of the Hall of Truth.\" In the 125th Chap ter, they are represented by the sacred gateway, the door to which the aspirant is brought when he has completed the negative confession. The archaic pidures on the one Pi are painted in black upon a white ground, and those on the other in white upon a black ground, in order to express the interchange and reconciliation of opposing forces and the eternal balance of light and darkness which gives force to visible nature. The black cubical bases represent darkness and matter wherein the Spirit, the Ruach Elohim, began to formulate the Ineffable NAME, that Name which the ancient Rabbis have said \"rushes through the universe,\" that Name before which the Darkness rolls back at the birth of time. The flaming red triangular capitals which crown the summit of the Pillars represent the Triune manifestation of the Spirit of Life, the Three Mothers of the Sepher Yetsirah, the Three Alchemical Principles of Nature, the Sulphur, the Mercury and the Salt. Each Pillar is surmounted by its own light-bearer veiled from the material world. At the base of both Pillars rise the Lotus flowers, symbols of regener- ation and metempsychosis. The archaic illustrations are taken from < 11 1 > vignettes of the 17th and 125th chapter of the Ritual of the Dead, the Egyptian Book of the Per-em-Hnt or the Book of Coming Forth into the Day, the oldest book in the world as yet discovered. The Recension of the Priests of ON is to be found in the walls of the Pyramids of the Kings of the 5th and 6th Dynasties at Sakarah, the recension of the 1 lth and 12th Dynasties on the sarcophagi of that period, and the Theban recension of the"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"56 The Golden Dawn: Volume I Book One 18th Dynasty and onward is found on papyri, both plain and illuminated. No satisfactory translation of these books is available, none having been yet attempted by a scholar having the qualifications of mystic as well as Egyptologist. The Ritual of the Dead, generally speaking, is a collection of hymns and prayers in the form of a series of ceremonial Rituals to enable the man to unite himself with Osiris the Redeemer. After this union he is no longer called the man, but Osiris, with whom he is now symbolically identified. \"That they also may be One of us,\" said the Christ of the New Testament. \"I am Osiris\" said the purified and justified man, his soul luminous and washed from sin in the immortal and uncreated light, united to Osiris, and thereby justified, and the son of God; purified by suffering, strengthened by opposi- tion, regenerate through self-sacrifice. Such is the subject of the great Egyp- tian Ritual. The 17th Chapter of the Theban recension consists of a very ancient text with several commentaries, also extremely old, and some prayers, none of which come into the scheme of the original text. It has, together with the 12th chapter, been very carefully translated for the purpose of this lecture by the V. H. Frater M. W. T., and the V. H. Soror S. S. D. D. has made many <112> valuable suggestions with regard to the interpretation. The Title and Preface of the 17th Chapter reads: \"Concerning the exaltation of the Glorified Ones, of Coming and Going forth in the Divine Domain, of the Genies of the Beautiful land of Amentet. Of coming forth in the light of Day in any form desired, of Hearing the Forces of Nature by being enshrined as a living Bai.\" And the rubric is: \"The united with Osiris shall recite it when he has entered the Harbour. May glorious things be done thereby upon earth. May all the words of the Adept be fulfilled.\" Owing to the complex use of symbols, the ritual translation of the Chap- ter can only be understood by perpetual reference to the ancient Egyptian commentaries, and therefore the following paraphrase has been put to- gether to convey to modem minds as nearly as possible the ideas conceived by the old Egyptians in this glorious triumphal song of the Soul of Man made one with Osiris, the Redeemer. \"I am TUM made One with all things. \"I have become NU. I am RA in his rising ruling by right of his Power. I am the Great God self-begotten, even NU, who pronounced His Names, and thus the Circle of the Gods was created. \"I am Yesterday and know Tomorrow. I can never more be overcome. I know the secret of Osiris, whose being is perpetually revered of RA. I have finished the work which was planned at the Beginning, I am the Spirit made manifest, and armed with two vast eagle's plumes. Isis and Nephthys are their names, made One with Osiris. \"I claim my inheritance. My sins have been uprooted and my <113> passions overcome. I am Pure White. I dwell in Time.

I move in the firmness of my Strength. I undulate as the Waves that vibrate through Eternity. Osiris has been claimed with acclamation, and ordained to rule among the Gods. Enthroned in the Domain of Horus where the Spirit and the Body are united in the presence of the Ancient of Days. Blotted out are the sins of his body in passion. He has passed the Eternal Gate, and has received the New Year Feast with Incense, at the marriage of Earth with Heaven. \"TUM has built his Bridal Chamber. RURURET has founded his shrine. The Procession's completed. HORUS has purified, SET has consecrated, SHU made one with OSIRIS, has entered his heritage. \"As TUM he has entered the Kingdom to complete union with the Invis- ible.

I have come from afar, where the Acacia Tree grew not. Where the tree thick with leaves is not born. Where there come not beams from herb or grass. I have entered the Place of Mystery. I have communed with Set. Sleep came upon me, I was wrapped therein, bowing down before the hidden things. I was ushered into the House of Osiris. I saw the marvels that were there. The Princes of the Gates in their Glory.\" The illustrations in this chapter represent the Hall of Truth as seen through the open leaves of its door. The Hall is presided over by a God who holds his right hand over the cage of a hawk, and his left over the food of eter- nity. On each side of the God is a cornice crowned by a row of alternate feathers and Uraei symbolising justice and fiery power. The door leaf which completes the right hand of a stall is called 'Tossessor of Truth controlling the Feet,\" while that on the left is 'Tossessor of strength, binding the male and female animals.\" The 42 Judges of the Dead are represented as seated in a long row, and each of them has to be named, and the Sin over which he pre- sided has been denied. This chapter describes the introduction of the initiate into the Hall of Truth by ANUBIS, who, having questioned the aspirant, receives from him an account of his initiation, and is satisfied by his right to enter. He states that he has been taken into the ante-chamber of the Temple and there <116> stripped and blind-folded, he had to grope for the entrance of the Hall, and having found it, he was reclothed and anointed in the pres- ence of the Initiated. He is then asked for the Pass-words and demands that his Soul should be weighed in the Great Balance of the Hall of Truth, whereupon ANUBIS again interrogates him concerning the symbolism of the door of the Hall, and his answers being found correct, ANUBIS says: 'Tass on, thou knowest it.\" Among other things the Initiate states that he has been purified four times, the same number of times that the Neophyte is purified and conse- crated in the ceremony of the Neophyte. He then makes the long Negative Confession, stating to each Judge in turn that he is innocent of that form of Sin over which he judges. Then he invokes the Judges to do him justice, and afterwards describes how he had washed in the washing place of the South, and rested in the North, in the place called \"Son of the Deliverers\" and he becomes the Dweller under the Olive Tree of Peace, and how he was given a tall flame of fire and a sceptre of cloud which he preserved in the salting tank in which mummies were swathed. And he found there another sceptre called \"Giver of Breath and with that he extinguished the flame and shat- tered the sceptre of cloud, and made a lake of it. The initiate is then brought to the actual Pillars, and has to name them and their parts under the symbol of the Scales of a Balance. He also has to name the Guardian of the Gateway, who prevents his passage, and when all these are propitiated, the plea of the Hall itself cries out against his steps, sayingtBecause I am silent, because I am pure,\" and it must know that his aspirations are pure enough and high"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"First Knowledge Lecture 59 enough for him to be allowed to tread upon it. He is then allowed to <117> announce to Thoth that he is clean from all evil, and has overcome the influence of the planets, and THOTH says to him: 'Who is He whose Pylons are of Flame, whose walls of Living Uraei, and the flames of whose House are streams of Water?\" And the Initiate replies \"Osiris!\" And it is immediately proclaimed: 'Thy meat shall be from the Infinite, and thy drink from the Infinite. Thou art able to go forth to the sepulchral feasts on earth, for thou hast overcome.\" Thus, these two chapters, which are represented by their illustrations upon the Pillars, represent the advance and purification of the Soul and its union with Osiris, the Redeemer, in the Golden Dawn of the Infinite Light, in which the Soul is transfigured, knows all, and can do all, for it is made One with the Eternal God.

The King and the Queen are the correlations of the Abba and the Aima in that suit; the Knight or Prince answers to Micro- prosopus, and the Knave or Princess which was anciently a female figure, is referred to the Bride, Kallah or Malkah. Combining, then, the material attributions of the Sephiroth and the Path, it results that: 0. Fool=The Crown of Wisdom, the Primum Mobile acting through the Air on the Zodiac. 1. The Juggle-The Crown of Understanding, the beginning of material production, the Primum Mobile acting through the Philosophic Mercury on Saturn. 2. High Priestess=The Crown of Beauty, the beginning of Sovereignty and Beauty, the Primum Mobile acting through the Moon on the Sun. 3. Empress=The Wisdom of Understanding, the Union of the powers of Origination and Production; the Sphere of the Zodiac acting through Venus upon Saturn. 4.

It shows in a glyph the teaching proper to the Practicus on entering the Sephirah HOD which he has reached by the Paths of SHIN and RESH from MALKUTH and YESOD respectively. At the summit are the THREE SUPERNAL SEPHIROTH summed up into ONE-AIMA ELOHIM, the Mother Supernal-The Woman of the Apocalypse (Chap. 12) clothed with the SUN, the MOON under her feet, and on her head the Crown of Twelve Stars. It is written 'So the Name JEHOVAH is joined to the Name ELOHIM, for JEHOVAH planted a Garden Eastward in Eden.' From the Three Supernals follow the other Sephiroth of THE TREE OF LIFE. Below the TREE, proceeding from MALKUTH is THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE of GOOD AND of EVIL which is between the Tree of Life and the World or Assiah or Shells, represented by the Coiled Up DRAGON with Seven Heads and Ten Horns-being the Seven Infernal Palaces and the Ten Averse Sephiroth. (These are described in the text of the Rituals but are not read to the Candidate at his Grade. When studying this diagram, these de- scriptions should be looked up, but they are not required for the exam.) The River NAHER flows forth from the Supernal Eden and in DAATH it is divided into Four Heads:- PISON: Fire-flowing to GEBURAH where there is Gold. <145> GIHON: Water-the Waters of Mercy, flowing into CHESED. HIDDIKEL: Air-flowing into TIPHARETH. PHRATH (Euphrates) : Earth - flowing into MALKUTH."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"74 The Golden Dawn: Volume I Book One It is written 'ln DAATH the Depths are broken up and the Clouds drop down dew.\" The word Naher has the meaning 'perennial stream1-'never failing waters' as opposed to other words mearung Torrent or Brook. The River going out of Eden is the River of the Apocalypse, the Waters of Life, clear as crystal proceeding from the Throne, on either side of the Tree of Life, bearing all manner of Fruit. Thus the Rivers form a Cross and on it The GREAT ADAM, the SON who is to rule the Nations, was extended from TIPHARETH and his arms stretch out to GEBURAH AND GEDULAH, and in MALKUTH is EVE, sup- porting with her hands the TWO PILLARS. <146> ON THE GENERAL GUIDANCE AND PURIFICATION OF THE SOUL Learn first, 0 Practicus of our Ancient Order, that true Equilibrium is the basis of the Soul. If thou thyself hast not a sure foundation, whereon wilt thou stand to direct the forces of Nature? Know then that as Man is born into this world amidst the darkness of Nature and the strife of contending forces, so must his first endeavour be to seek the Li ht through their reconciliation. Thus, thou who hast trial and trouble of t f is life, rejoice because of them, for in them is strength, and by their means is a athwa opened unto that light Divine. How shod it be ot K erwise, 0 man, whose life is but a day in Eternity, a drop in the Ocean of Time? How, if thy trials were not many, couldst thou purge thy soul from the dross of Earth? Is it but now that the higher life is beset with dangers and difficulties; hath it not been ever thus with the Sages and Hierophants of the Past? They have been persecuted and reviled, the have been tormented of men, yet through this has their glory increased. f;ejoice, therefore, 0 Initiate, for the greater thy trial, the brighter thy triumph. When men shall revile thee and speak against thee falsely, hath not the Master said \"Blessed art thou.\" Yet, 0 Practicus, let thy victories brin thee not vanity, for with increase of knowl- B edge should come increase o wisdom. He who knows little, thinketh he knows much; but he who knoweth much hath learned his own ignorance. Seest thou a Man wise in his own conceit? There is more hope of a fool than of him. Be not hasty to condemn other's sin. How knowest thou that in <147> their place.thou couldst have resisted the tem ation? And even were it so, why shouldst thou despise one w !? o is weaker than thyself? Be thou well sure of this, that in slander and self-righteousness is sin. Pardon therefore the sinner, but encourage not the sin. The Master con- demned not the adulterous woman, but neither did he encourage her to commit the sin. that th soul is firm that the Evil 8ne will gain neither man nor courage is the begin- ning of virtue. Therefore fear not the S irits, but be firm and courteous with them, for thou hast no right either to z espise or to revile them, and this too may lead thee into sin. Command and banish the Evil ones. Curse them by"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Fourth knowledge Lecture 75 the Great Names of God, if need be; but neither mock nor revile them, for so assuredly thou wilt be led into error. A man is what he maketh himself within the limits fixed by his inherited destiny; he is a part of mankind. His actions affect not himself only, but also those with whom he is brought into contact, either for good or for evil. Neither worship nor neglect the physical body, which is thy temporary connection with the outer and material world. Therefore let thy mental equilibrium be above disturbances by material events. Restrain the animal passions and nourish the higher aspirations; the emotions are purified by suffering. Do good unto others for God's sake, not for reward, not for gratitude from them, not for sympathy. If thou art generous, thou wilt not long <148> for thine ears to be tickled by expressions of gratitude. Remember that unbalanced force is evil, that unbalanced severity is but cruelty and oppression, but that also unbalanced Mercy is but weakness which would allow and abet evil. True prayer is as much action as Word; it is Will. The Gods will not do for man what his Higher Powers can do for himself, if he cultivate Will and Wis- dom. Remember that this Earth is but an atom in the Universe, and thou thyself but an atom thereon. And that even couldst thou become the God of this Earth whereon thou crawlest and grovellest, thou wouldst even then be but an atom and one among many. Nevertheless, have the greatest self- respect, and to that end sin not against thyself. The sin which is unpardonable is knowingly and wilfully to reject spiritual truth, but every sin and act leaveth its effect. To obtain magical Power, learn to co11trol thought. Admit only true ideas which are in harmony with the end desired, and not every stray and con- tradictory idea that presents itself. Fixed thought is a means to an end; therefore pay attention to the power of silent thought and meditation. The material act is but the outward expression of the thought, and therefore it hath been said that \"the thought of foolishness is sin.\" Thought therefore is the commencement of action, and if a chance thought can produce much effect, what cannot fixed thought do? Therefore, as has been already said, es- tablish thyself firmly in the Equilibrium of Forces, in the centre of the cross of the elements, that Cross from whose centre the creative word issued in the birth of the dawning universe. As it was said unto thee in the Grade of Theoricus: \"Be thou <149> therefore prompt and active as the Sylphs, but avoid frivolity and caprice. Be energetic and strong like the Salamanders, but avoid irritability and ferocity. Be flexible and attentive to images like the Undines, but avoid idleness and changeability. Be laborious and patient like the Gnomes, but avoid grossness and avarice.\" So shalt thou gradually develop the powers of thy Soul and fit thyself to command the spirits of the elements. For wert thou to summon the Gnomes to pander to thy avarice, thou wouldst no longer command them, but they would command thee. Wouldst thou abuse the pure creatures of God's creation to fill thy coffers and to satisfy thy lust for Gold? Wouldst thou defile the Spirits of driving Fire to"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"76 The Golden Dawn: Volume I Book One serve thy wrath and hatred? Wouldst thou violate the purity of the Souls of the Water to pander to thy lust and debauchery? Wouldst thou force the Spirits of the evening breeze to minister to thy folly and caprice? Know that with such desires thou canst but attract the evil and not the good, and in that can the evil will have power over thee. In true religion there is no sect. Therefore take heed that thou blas- pheme not the name by which another knowethhis God for if thou doest this thing in Jupiter, thou wilt blaspheme YHVH; and in Osiris YEHESHUAH. ''Ask of God and ye shall have, Seek and ye shall find. Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\" <150> THE GARDEN OF EDEN AFTER THE FALL This diagram is described in the Philosophus Ritual. It shows in a glyph the teaching proper to a Philosophus on entering the Sephirah NETZACH which he has reached by the Three Paths of QOPH, TZADDI, AND PEH from the SEPHIROTH-MALKUTH, YESOD and HOD respectively. The Great Goddess EVE, being tempted by the fruits of the TREE OF KNOWLEDGE whose branches tend upwards to the seven lower Sephiroth, but also downward to the Kingdom of Shells, reached down to them and the two pillars were left unsupported. Then the Sephirotic Tree was shattered. She fell and with her fell the Great ADAM. And the Great Red Dragon arose with his seven heads and ten horns, and EDEN was desolated-and the folds of the Dragon enclosed MALKUTH and linked it to the Kingdom of the Shells. And the heads of the Dragon rose into the seven lower Sephiroth, even up to DAATH at the feet of Aima Elohirn. Thus were the four Rivers of EDEN desecrated and the Dragon Mouth gave forth the Infernal Waters in DAATH-and this is LEVIATHAN, The Piercing and Crooked Serpent. But TETRAGRAMMATON ELOHIM placed the Four Letters YHVH of the NAME and the Flaming Sword of the Ten Sephiroth between the devas- tated Garden and the Supernal Eden, that this should not be involved in the Fall of ADAM. And it became necessary that a Second Adam should arise to <151> restore the System, and thus, as ADAM had been spread on the Cross of the Four Rivers, so the Second ADAM should be crucified on the Infernal Rivers of the four armed Cross of DEATH-yet to do this He must descend into the lowest, even MALKUTH the Earth, and be born of her. (Psalm 74. 'Thou breakest the Heads of Leviathan in pieces.') And on the Dragon Heads were the names of the eight Kings of EDOM and on his horns the names of the Eleven Dukes of EDOM, for DAATH hav- ing developed in the Dragon a new Head, the Seven Headed Dragon with Ten Horns became Eight Headed and Eleven Homed. (Genesis, 36:31 to 43. Chronicles 1: 43 to 54.) NOTE: The Edomites were the descendants of Esau who sold his birthright.

Yet when you apply the Tree of Life to yourself, your right side, arm, and leg represent the side of Strength and Severity, Binah, Geburah and Hod, and your left side refers to the, Pillar of Mercy. So that when you look at a diagram, you are looking, as it were, at a man facing you, that your right side faces his left. His Merciful side forms the right hand Pillar in front of you, so that it is as if you looked at yourself in a mirror. Just as the man looks at you, so does the Moon look at you and so you say that the Moon in her increase is on the side of Mercy, the right hand pillar of the Sephiroth; and in her decrease, the crescent is on the left hand Pillar of Severity. A Diagram, then, is a picture of a Man or the Moon facing you. The Tem- ple Pillars are similar: Black Pillar Severity Left North White Pillar Mercy Right South Black Pillar Boaz Stolistes White Pillar Jachin Dadouchos That is, the white Mercy or Jachin Pillar is on your right hand as 162> you approach the Altar from the West and from the Hiereus. (See Chronicles 11. iii, 17.) \"And call the Name on the right hand (of him who enters) Jachin, and the Name of that on the left, Boaz.\" Now Boaz= Strength, Severity, Binah, Black Pillar, and Jachin= White Pillar of Mercy. So in making the Qabalistic Cross on your breast it is correct to touch the Forehead and say Ateh-Thou art; the Heart-Malkuth; Right Shoulder, ve- Geburah; left shoulder ve-Gedulah, and with the fingers clasped on the breast say, Le, olahm, amen!

The Circle denotes Sun and Gold; the Crescent the Moon and Silver, respectively analogous to the Red and White Alchemical natures. The Cross is the symbol of corrosion. The corrosion of metals is usually of the complementary colour to that to which they naturally approximate. Thus Copper, which is reddish, becomes green in its corrosion of verdigris, etc. Mercury is the only planet which unites these three primary forms in one symbol. Saturn is composed of the cross and the crescent showing that Lead is corrosive internally and Luna externally. Jupiter is the reverse. Mars is Solar internally but corrosive externally. Venus is opposite. Copper is externally of the nature of Gold, but inter- mlly corrosive. Hence the name of the Sphere of Venus is Nogah-denoting External Splendour but internal corruption. The Serpent Nehushtan, which Moses made when the Children of Israel were bitten by Serpents of Fire in the Wilderness, is the Serpent of the Paths of the Tree. And he set it on a pole-that is, twined it round the middle Pillar of the Sephiroth. And the word used in the passage in Numbers 21 for Fiery Serpents is the same as the Name of the Angels of Geburah, the same spell- ing, the same pointing, Seraphim. Round the Middle Pillar of the Sephiroth, because that is the Reconciler between the Fires of Geburah or Severity, and the Waters of Chesed or Mercy-and hence it is said in the New <166> Testament that it is a type of Christ, the Reconciler. And the serpent is of Brass, the Metal of Venus, whose Sphere is called Nogah, or External Splendour, as shewn further by the Alchemical Symbol of Venus, wherein the Circle of the Sun is exalted above the Cross of Corrosion. And therefore it is said in the Zohar that \"Alone of the Shells is the Serpent Nogah found in Holiness\" and he is called the Balance of Justice. Why, then, is he called the External or False Splendour? Because he indeed uniteth the Paths, but comprehendeth not the Sephiroth. Nevertheless, he is also the Celestial Serpent of Wisdom. But the Serpent of the Temptation is the Serpent of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and of Evil, and not that of the Tree of Life. Here is a method of writing Hebrew words by the Yetsiratic attribution of the Alphabet, whence results some curious hieroglyphic symbolism. Thus Tetragrammaton will be written by Virgo, Aries, Taurus, Aries. Eheieh,by Air, Aries, Virgo, Aries. From Yeheshua, the Qabalistic mode of spelling Jesus, which is simply the Tetragrammaton with the letter Shin placed therein, we obtain a very peculiar combination-Virgo, Aries, Fire, Taurus, Aries. Virgo born of a Virgin, Aries the Sacrificial Lamb, Fire the Fire of the Holy Spirit, Taurus the Ox of the Earth in whose Manger He was laid, and lastly Aries the flocks of sheep whose Herdsmen came to worship Him. Elohim yields Air, Libra, Aries, Virgo, Water-the Firmament, the Balanced Forces, the Fire of the Spirit (For Aries is a fiery Sign), operating in the Zodiac, the Fire God dess, and the Waters of Creation."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"84 The Golden Dawn: Volume 1 Book One <167> The terms Raven or Crow, Lion and Eagle have various Al- chemical significations.

The Cucurbite is a lass boiler attached to the lower part of the Alembic. It consists of a tube, a ead, and a receiver added thereto for purposes of distillation. 8, The Athanor or Philoso hical Furnace is to produce a raduated heat.

It describes how various verses are taken from the book of Exodus, and by methods of permutation, are formed into seventy-two names of three letters each. To each of these names is added the suffix Yeh or El, thus yielding angelic names and formulae. These seventy-two Angels are allotted to each quinary, or division of 5\", in the celestial heavens, so that with the other names a very complete hierarchy is given. Thus every Sign of the Zodiac has an Archangel, Angel, Angel of its corresponding house, and a vast sub-hierarchy. Too much space would have been consumed to detail the methods by which these names are given. So I have contented myself to list, simply, all the Archangelic and Angelic Names of the twelve Zodiacal Signs, and state that they are very important names, and their arrangement should be care- fully studied. The documents on Tarot attribute two of these Angels to each of the 36 small cards, and the anglicised transliteration of their names will there be found. But I have thought it advisable here to give the Hebrew letters and spelling so that the student may have them at his hand when dealing with the matters of Sigh and Telesmatic Images, which are, as elsewhere explained, formed from the Hebrew spellings.

A Thesis on the Rituals. 2. A meditation on the crosses which have been used as admission badges in the Grades. This is a preparation for the meditation which precedes the @-a Grade and should be applied for when you have been a Portal Member for seven months. 3. A complete diagram of The Tree of Life. 4. The practice of control of the Aura. 5. The placing of The Tree of Life in the Aura. 6. Tattwas-Astrology-Divination. 1. The Thesis. Read the rituals. Build themupin imagination. Compare the Opening and Closing in the various Grades. Note the general underlying scheme for each Elemental Grade-and note where the differences occur. Follow the careers of the various Officers. Note at what Grade an Officer disappears. Make a precis of each Ritual so that the general scheme becomes apparent. This is of the greatest assistance when you are called on to take Office because you will not then need to follow everything in the Ritual but need only turn to the page where your Office is mentioned and when you have no more to say, you can turn to the Closing and put the Ritual aside till required for that. Ability to do this and to move correctly in the <176> Temple adds greatly to the harmony and repose of the whole Ceremony. Note the positions of the various officers-what mathematical shapes they make among themselves from time to time as they take up their places in the Temple. It may be a triangle, a cross, a pentagram, etc. Read the speeches carefully, and read them sometimes aloud so that you get familiar with the sound of your own voice in saying the words. Note that some speeches are designed to create atmosphere by their archaic form and should be read rhythmically and sonorously, while others are informative and should be read in such a way as to make their points clear. Examples of archaic passages are challenges of Gods: \"Thou canst not pass the Gate of the Western Heaven unless thou canst tell me my Name.\" And the speeches of the Kabiri in the Grades of Practicus and Philosophus. Information is given in speeches about Tarot Keys and diagrams. Note the technique for traversing the various Paths-the words, and the badges with which the Path is entered, the length of the circumambulation and the special symbolism described therein. Let all these things soak into your mind, make notes as ideas occur to you-and presently your personal reaction to the Grades will crystallise out and you will be able to write your thesis."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"88 The Golden Dawn: Volume I Book One 2. Make a list and drawings of the crosses which have been given you as Admission Badges throughout the Grades, from the Swastika of the <177> Zelator to the Five-squared cross which you put on as you stood at the Altar at the second point of the Portal Grade. Read what is said of them in the Rituals and knowledge lectures, and make notes about them. 3. The Tree of Life. This should be done fairly large in order that the writing and symbols should be clear. It is essential to show the Deity Names, Names of Archangels and Angels in Hebrew in the Sephiroth, and to num- ber the Paths and give their attributions. Apart from this, the Tree should be your personal synthesis of the Order symbolism as it applies to the Tree of Life. Colours may be used. 4. Control of the Aura. If you are not already familiar with the parts of your own body such as nervous system, respiratory system, digestive sys- tem, get some simple text-book such as is used in ambulance work, or attend a course of first-aid lectures so that, before starting to work on your subtle body, you may know something about your physical body. Your physical body is interpenetrated by a subtle body or aura which also surrounds the physical body like an egg of light. You should now begin to practise controlling this aura or Sphere of Sensation. This means that you must first try to get our emotional reactions under conscious control. Instead of automatical l' y liking this, disliking that, you must try to understand the mechanism which underlies these feelings. To assist you in this, the study of psychology is recommended. There are many books on the subject, of which the following are easy to understand and clearly stated. Psychology by Wm. McDougall (Home University Library). <178> Psychoanalysis for Normal People by Geraldine Coster. Psycho-Synthesis by the Dean of Chester Cathedral. Machinery o the Mind by Violet Firth. Having bui I t up some idea of the mechanism of your mental processes, you should now try to make yourself negative or positive at will towards peo- ple or ideas. If you are likely to meet someone who always makes you argumentative and irritable, decide that your aura is closed to their power of irritating you and that your mind will not be disturbed by what the say. It is good sometimes to listen to views with which you disagree to teac h you not only to make no verbal response, but to keep your feelings in abeyance also. In this way you come to learn how much of your disagreement is due to preju- dice or personal factors, and how much to your regard for abstract truth. Again, sometimes practise opening your aura to people or ideas in an endeavour to see things from another's point of view. The practice of deep breathing is also of help in establishing poise and in controlling nervousness. It is good to expand the chest to its fullest extent and then to expand the diaphragm below the ribs as well and then to let the breath out slowly and steadily on a vowel sound such as ah or '0'. If you are nervy, you will find that your breathing is shallow and that your muscles are tense. You tend to clench your hands and tighten <179> up the abdominal muscles. To cure this, take a deep breath to full capacity, hold it while tensing and relaxing alternately the ab- dominal muscles. Do this (i.e. the tensing and relaxing of the muscles) three"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"<180> THE MIDDLE PILLAR AND THE HUMAN BODY"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"90 The Golden Dawn: Volume 1 Book One times and then relax completely into a chair. Allow all your muscles to go limp and let your breath out to the last gasp. Do the whole process three times, if necessary. It is designed to stimulate the solar plexus which is the heart of the nervous system which governs emotion. Another good exercise is to say the Deity Names aloud. Take a deep breath and say them softly, smoothly and slowly, imagining the while that your voice travels out to the confines of the Universe. This can be done in conjunction with the Pentagram Ritual. 5. The Tree of Life in the Aura. In the aura which interpenetrates and surrounds our physical bodies, we are to build up a replica of the Tree of Life. The Pillar of Severity is on our right side, the Pillar of Mercy on our left, and the Pillar of Benificence in our midst. THE MIDDLE PILLAR EXERCISE It is best to build up the Middle Pillar first. To do this stand up and raise yourself in imagination to your Kether-a brilliant light above your head. Imagine this light descending to Daath, at the nape of your neck, and thence to Tiphareth in your heart where it glows like sunlight and whence it radiates into the other Sephiroth. From Tiphareth the light goes to Yesod in the region of the hips, and thence to Malkuth in which your feet are planted. Having made a clear image of the Middle Pillar, you can then establish the other Sephiroth by vibrating the Deity Names. This can be done as <181> an alternative to the Pentagram Ritual as a preparation for meditation. 1. Imagine yourself standing in the Temple, facing West. The Black Pillar of Severity will be on your right-the White Pillar of Mercy on your left. You will make the Middle Pillar as you stand between them. 2. Imagine now that the Black Pillar is reflected in your right side-the White Pillar in your left. 3. Take a deep breath and raise your consciousness to your Kether above your head and vibrate the Name EHEIEH-which means I am. Imag- ine the Light flowing down through Daath (at the nape of your neck) to Tiphareth. 4. In the same manner, establish Yesod in the name SHADDAI EL CHAI, and Malkuth in the Name ADONAI HA-ARETZ. 5. Make the Qabalistic Cross to indicate that you have called down the Light of your Kether and balanced it in your aura. Then let your imagination dwell on the aura and see it oval and clear, pulsating with the glow from Tiphareth. If you are called to see anyone who is ill, who is depressed, or who has a depressing effect on you, you should do this exercise beforehand. In the case of the person who has a depressing effect on you, you may also imagine that your aura is hardened at the edge so that they are unable to penetrate it, and so deplete you of vitality (which is generally what such sensations mean). In all these practices it is well to remember that 'Strength is in Silence.'If you talk about them, save to your Chief, or if you try to analyse their <182> effects, you will not benefit by them. Try them with simple faith and"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Fifth Knowledge Lecture 91 in silence for a year before rationalising them. It is better at first to keep your aura to yourself, rather than to try to flow out towards others. Unless you are particularly vital and well-balanced, you will only waste energy. So-called modes of healing and of 'doing good to others' should be eschewed for a time. Such methods have a technique of their own and required trained and balanced minds and bodies to carry them out. Get yourself right first before you attempt to interfere with others in any way but the ordinary ways of kindly decent society. When you have practised the exercise of the Middle Pillar for some time and can visualise it easily, you can establish the other Sephiroth. 6. Tathvas-Astrology-Divination. The Tathvas are designed to assist you in your researches into the Soul of Nature. They are at first done with a senior member, and later can be done alone or with a companion of your own Grade. They should never be allowed to become uncontrolled day- dreams. The method taught should be strictly adhered to-a definite time, preferably in the morning being set aside-and they should not be at- tempted when you are feeling tired or when your mind is too occupied with other things to let you 'get away.' They should not be done too frequently- once in three weeks or a month is enough, once a week if time and cir- cumstances permit. Notes of the pictures and symbols seen should be kept together in a book. Astrology. This should be done as time permits. The subject is <183> vast and highly technical, and can be studied fully through the various schools and correspondence classes if you are interested in it. From the Order Lectures you should be able to set up a true birth horo- scope for any place and any time. You can practise setting up horoscopes for the cases given in Alan Leo's little book 1001 Notable Nativities and see whether you can tell for what the horoscope was remarkable. You should attempt the reading of a horoscope for someone you know and then get the data for someone about whom you know nothing, and see whether you can give a reading which satisfies their friends. The Order requires only that you should be able to set up an accurate horoscope and that you should know how to work out the aspects and how to make a simple assessment of the good and bad factors in a horary figure. If Astrology interests you further, it is a very fascinating field of research. Divination. You may try to develop your intuition by the use of horary and natal astrology, geomancy, and the reading of the Tarot Cards by the method given in the small book by Mr. A. E. Waite. You are advised to attempt only questions in which you are not emotionally involved because methods of divination can be a fruitful source of self-deception to those who are psychic but not self-knowing. If you are given to having intuitions you must learn to say not only 'I was right about that' but also 'I was quite wrong about that,' and if you advertise only suc- cesses (as is usual) at the bar of your own conscience, learn to assess them honestly. The interval of time between Portal and 0 -a should be given <184> to the study of the whole make-up of yourself. All these methods are designed to assist you to get as far as you can along the road to self-"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"92 The Golden Dawn: Volume I Book One knowledge. You are to realise the different layers of your being-some of which you have been led through symbolically in the Outer Grades-'Which in one sense quitteth not Malkuth-the Kingdom of yourself. This line of thought, coupled with the study of the Rituals, may lead you to realise what it was you gathered together in the first point of the Portal Ritual, and what it is you are trying to perfect to lay on the Altar of the Spirit. (Note: The reader or student who is interested particularly in this sub- ject of the Sphere of Sensation, or aura as it is called, would be well-advised to study very carefully the Order Tarot teaching. There is much in that set of documents which concerns the application of the idealogy of the Qabalistic Tree of Life to a sphere. In that case the Pillar arrangement becomes slightly altered or extended so as to produce 4 Pillars about an invisible axis, the Mid- dle Pillar. There is also much profound wisdom in the very skeletal at- tributions of the five divisions of the Tarot Pack to the surface or parts of the solid sphere. The Aces to the North pole, and the 36 decanate Cards to the South pole up to the Ecliptic, while in between range the Princess cards which are the Thrones of the Aces, the other Court cards, and the Trumps. The studied application of this intricate scheme to the extended arrangement of the Tree of Life, and thence to the human personality and sphere <185> in all its branches will yield a wealth of significant material. I have also elaborated this scheme in two books. In The Art of True Healing I have dealt with the Aura and the Middle Pillar solely from the therapeutic point of view. My other book, The Middle Pillar, considers the technique from a considerably wider view. Moreover it attempts to associate the results of training with the terminology of Analybcal Psychology. I. R) We are told in the Portal that the nine months' wait which must inter- vene before the Portal is again opened for the Aspirant has a correspondence to the nine months of gestation before birth. As the unborn child, stage by stage, grows through the ancestral history of the race so the Candidate in the Portal by a single circumambulation for each, recalls his past Grades and, at the end of the first point regards their symbols upon the Altar as parts of his body, and contemplates them as coming together in one place-the unity of his person. In the second point, he sacrifices his name-symbol of his idea of him- self in order that the idea of a new self and a new consciousness may be attained. This has a correspondence in the birth of a child. It emerges from the membranes and placenta which hitherto have been its body and source of life and finds itself not 'dead' after the dread change, but translated to a larger consciousness. Thus the Portal foreshadows the kind of change and development necessary for understanding the symbolism of the @ = a. We do not know what consciousness the unborn child has-how far it"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Fifth Knowledge Lecture 93 <186> has choice in its development-through what agency it unfolds the potencies of its tiny seed and draws to itself the necessary materials for growth. The miracle happens-and gives us courage to believe that a similar miracle is even now enacting whereby a body will be ready for us when this, which seems so real to us, shall share the same fate as the placenta and membranes which 'die' at our birth. But tradition, as embodied in our Order and shown somewhat less directly in the revealed religions, teaches that this development can be assist- ed by conscious effort-indeed, that there comes a time when this effort must be made through the body and mind we are now endowed with. And realising that we are indeed in a Path of Darkness groping for Light, we must feel our way to an understanding of the meaning of life-the reason for death. To those who feel the call to make this effort, comes the Order with a series of pictures, symbolic of the growth of the soul to new life. The meditations given with each Grade are designed to lead the mind towards ideas which will assist in self-knowledge-universal impersonal ideas which each must find in his own way-'the secrets which cannot be told save to those who know them already.' The Aspirant is led to look backwards. First he must acknowledge his debt to evolution through which has been perfected the instrument wherein his mind works and gathers material. Then, through meditation, he is led to see himself as not only self-conscious-as one who receives impressions- one who criticises and watches-one whose will is interfered <187> with-one who is misunderstood-one to whom others are 'per- sons' or masks (from Latin Persona, a mask)-but, standing outside himself, he now becomes one who endeavours to sense how his mask appears to others-sees himself as part of the consciousness of others, as one who impresses, one who is criticised and watched, one who interferes with the will of others, one who misunderstands. He ma recall periods in his life when his convictions were sure, his judgments Lr sh and unjust, his actions shameful, and view himself in that picture dispassionately as an entity operative in the give and take of life, something growing and as outside the category of blame as is the bitterness of unripe fruit. As the knowledge of his place and relative importance in the Universe matures, he will attain strength to be honest with himself-ashamed of noth- ing he finds in his mind-one watching the antics of his personality with tolerant amusement-yet always learning. He will reflect on words, and the power of words. He will catch himself weaving them-twisting their meaning-deceiving himself and others with them. He will catch himself under obsession to them-he will see how they fix and make possible the recall of events and emotions, and with this knowl- edge he will become aware of how his words affect other people. As he begins to realise the tremendous miracle of words, the magic both good and evil of human communion by words, he will begin to grasp why the Order reiterates the importance of silence. The true Magician must under- stand his tools and, in periods of silence, he must contemplate words as one"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"94 The Golden Dawn: Volume I Book One of them. As he thus traverses the long road to dispassionate self- <188> knowled e, and no longer has to waste energy in doing battle for and indu 7 ging wounded feelings in defence of a totally false idea of himself, he is led to meditate on the varied symbols of the cross, and from this to contemplate the Crucified One, revealed to the West as Jesus of Nazareth. This life and the sayings of Jesus given in the Meditation should be studied and pictured in the mind. The mind must be taught to die to useless churnings over ast things and vain apprehensions about future things. This is difficult, ! or human phantasies die hard, but once the effort is made, however transient the result, it becomes easier with time to replace wasteful thoughts with those that clus- ter round a powerful symbo f eternal truth. tp As the time for the a = 6 Ceremony approaches, the Aspirant should withdraw as far as may be from externals that these symbols may work in his mind. He will find them waiting on the threshold of his mind ready to tell their story as he walks about or is occupied in mechanical tasks. Once a place has been made for them no 'time' is required to develop them. They grow in the waste places. Definite times, too should be set aside for Meditation whereinideas may be formulated as far as possible. Before going to sleep, the Aspirant should do the, Pentagram <189> Ritual and impress on his mind that he must recall on waking any teaching that has been given him in dream or vision. This may be assisted, if on waking, he calls before his mind the Sun rising, thinly veiled in clouds. This should be done at least the week preceding the Grade. The Ceremony will be a true initiation for the Aspirant only in so far as he has prepared himself to receive it. Like a word, it is a symbol, the communication of whose essence depends on the understanding and experience of the recipient. <190> MEDITATION LET THE ASPIRANT meditate upon the Cross in its various forms and aspects as shown in the Admission Badges throughout the Grades. Let him consider the necessity and prevalence of sacrifice throughout nature and religion. Let him realise the saying of the Master 'Whosoever shall save his life shall lose it, and whosoever shall lose his life shall save it.' 'Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone, but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.' Let him endeavour to realise his own place and relative importance in the Universe, striving to stand outside himself and allowing only such claims as he would allow to another. Let him carefully abstain from talking of himself, his feelings or"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Fifth Knowledge Lecture 95 experiences that he may gain continence of speech, and learn to control the wasteful activities of his mind. Let him contemplate the Sun as thinly veiled in clouds. <191> CONCERNING THE TREE OF LIFE This is the Book of the Path of the Chameleon-the knowledge of the colours of the forces which lie beyond the physical universe. Study thou well that saying of Hermes 'that which is below is like that which is above,' for if that which is below is conformed according to the Law of the Concealed One-Great is his Name-be thou well assured that the closer thou adherest unto the Law of the Universe in thy working, by so much the more is thy Magical working just and true. Recall what was said unto thee in the Ritual of the Paths of the Portal of the Vault of the Adepti. 'Therefore, by the straight and narrow path of Samekh, let the Philosophus advance like the arrow from the Bow of Qesheth.'Now Qesheth the Bow is the Rainbow of Promise stretched above the earth, whose name is formed from the letters of the Paths leading from Malkuth. If then it be by the Path of Samekh that the Philosophus should advance to the knowledge of the Adept, turning aside neither unto the right hand nor unto the left, whereon are the evil and threatening symbols of Death and the Devil, he must have a perfect and absolute knowledge of the Bow, ere he can follow the Path of the Arrow. But the Bow is of brilliant and perfect colour, whose analysis and synthesis yield others of the same scale, and hence is this book entitled \"The Book of the Path of the Chameleonn- that Path, namely which ascendeth alone through the force of Qesheth, - the Bow. And if thy knowledge and application of the outer knowledge, which thou hast already learned, be faulty and incorrect how wilt thou be <192> able to keep thyself from turning aside unto thy hurt? Therefore, learn not knowledge by rote only as an unreasoning child, but medi- tate, search out and compare, and to the end, see that thou think but little of thyself-for only he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. Magical knowl- edge is not given unto thee to tickle thy vanity and conceit, but that by its means, thou mayest purify and equilibriate thy spiritual nature and honour the Vast and Concealed One. This is the explanation of the first diagram of the Paths-the Sephiroth being in the feminine scale and the Paths in the masculine or King's scale. It is the Key of the Forces which lie in Qesheth the Bow. Treasure it in thy heart and mark it well, seeing that therein is the key of nature. Meditate on it and reveal it not unto the profane, for many and great are its mysteries. NOTE: There are four scales of colour which correspond to the Four Worlds. They are: The King Scale Atziluth Wands Yod Fire The Queen Scale Briah Cups Heh Water The Prince Scale Yetzirah Swords Vau Air The Princess Scale Assiah Pentacles Heh Earth"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"The Golden Dawn: Volume I Book One The Colors differ according to the World or aspect of the Great Name they represent: Thus Samekh in: The King Scale is Deep Blue The Queen Scale is Yellow The Prince Scale is Green The Princess Scale is Grey Blue <193> Tiphareth in: The King Scale is Rose The Queen Scale is Gold The Prince Scale is Pink The Princess Scale is Tawny Yellow The Tree of Life for the use of an Adeptus Minor is compounded of the first two scales.

And from the rays of this Triad there appear three colours in $lkuth to ether with a fourth which is their synthesis. Thus from the orange tawn of 5 od and the green nature of Netzach, there goeth forth a certain greenis K 'citrine' colour, yet ure and transluient withal. From the orange tawny of Hod mingled rnth &e puce of Yesod there oeth forth a certain red russet brown, 'russet' yet gleamin with a hidden &e. And from the reen of Net- R f Fen zach and the uce of yesod &ere goeth forth a certain other dar ening 'olive' yet ric and glowing withal. And the synthesis of all these is a lack- ness which bordereth upon the Qlip 0th. Thus are the colours of the sep&oth completed in their feminine or Rainbow scale. Moreover, though the Tree of Life operates thou h all the Ten , Sephiroth, yet it is referred in a special manner to Ti hareth. 1 lso, though the branches of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and stretch into the seven lower Sephiroth and downwards into the Kin dom of Shells, yet it <198> is referred especiall unto Malkuth. ~imilardy with Netzach and Hod, the right and le columns of the Sephiroth are referred respec- tivel thereto.

This sphere surroundeth the physical body of a man as the Celestial Heavens do the body of a Star or a Planet, having their forces mirrored in its atrnos- phere. Therefore its allotment or organization is the copy of that Greater World or Macrocosm. In this \"Magical Mirror of the Universe,\" therefore, are the Ten Sephiroth projected in the form of the Tree of Life as in a solid sphere. (See also the Astronomic view of the Tarot in Part Eight.) A man's physical body is within the Ten Sephiroth projected in a sphere. The divisions and parts of the body are formed from the Sephi- roth of the Tree of Life, thus. Kether is above the Crown of the Head, and represents a crown which indeed is powerful, but requires one worthy to wear it. In the crown of the head is placed the faculty of Neschamah, which is the power of Aspi- ration unto that which is beyond. This power of Neschamah is especially attributed unto the Supernal Triad in Assiah, of which there are three man- ifestations which are included in the general concept, Neschamah. From Chokmah and Binah are formed the sides of the brain and head. Therein exist the intellectual faculties of Wisdom and Under- standing, shining into and illuminating their inferior, the Ruach. They are the mansions of the practical administration of the intellect, whose phys- ical shewing forth is by reflection in Ruach. In the Magical Mirror of the Universe, or the Sphere of Sensation, Man is placed between four pillars of the Tree of Life as projected in a sphere. These keep their place and move not. But the Man himself places in his Sphere of Sensation c204> that point of the Zodiac which ascended at the moment of his birth and conception (for the same degree of the Zodiac ascendeth at both, otherwise the birth could not take place). That is to say that at those times the same degree of the Zodiac is ascending in the East of the Heav- ens of the Star whereon he is incarnated. Thus doth he remain during that incarnation facing that particular point in his sphere of sensation. That is to say, this sphere doth not revolve about the physical body. From Chesed and Geburah are formed the arms. Therein exist the faculties of operative action, wherefore at their extremities are the symbols of the Four Elements and the Spirit, thus:- Thumb. ............................. ..Spirit 3rd Finger. ........................... .Fire Index Finger. ......................... Water Little Finger. ......................... .Air Second Finger.. ...................... .Earth The arms are the manifestors of the executive power of the Ruach, and therein are the faculties of touch strongly expressed."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Fifth Knowledge Lecture 101 From Tiphareth is formed the trunk of the body, free from the <205> members, and therein as in a receptacle of influences are situated the vital organs. The blood is Spirit mingled with and governing the watery princi- ple. The lungs are the receptacles of Air which tempereth the blood as the wind doth the waves of the sea-the mephitic impurities of the blood in its traversal of the body requiring the dispersing force of the Air, even as the sea, under a calm, doth putrify and become mephitic. The heart is the great centre of the action of Fire, lending its ter- rible energy as an impulse unto the others. Thence cometh from the fiery nature the red colour of the blood. The part above the heart is the chief abode of the Ruach, as there receiving and concentrating the other expressions of its Sephiroth. This part is the central citadel of the body and is the particular abode of the lower and more physical will. The higher will is in the Kether of the body. For the higher will to manifest, it must be reflected into the lower will by Neschamah. This lower will is immediately potent in the lower membranes and thus, in the region about the heart, is the lower will seat- ed Like the King of the body upon its throne. The concentration of the other faculties of the Ruach in and under the presidency of the Will, at the same time reflecting the administrative governance of Chokmah and Binah, is what is called the human con- sciousness. That is, a reflection of two creative Sephiroth under <206> the presidency of the Four Elements, or the reflection of Aima and Abba as the parents of the human Jehovah. But the human Neschamah exists only when the higher Will is reflected by the agency of aspiration from Kether into the lower body, and when the flaming let- ter Shin is placed like a crown on the head of Microprosopus. Thus only doth the human will become the receptacle of the higher Will and the action of Neschamah is the link therewith. The lower will is the human Jehovah-an angry and jealous God, the Shaker of the Elements, the manifestor in the life of thebody. But illuminatedby the higher Will, he becometh Yeheshuah, no longer angry and jealous, but the self-sacrificer and the Atoning and Reconciling One. This as regards the action of the more physical man. Unto this Ruach also are presented the reflections of the Macrocos- mic Universe in the Sphere of Sensation. They surround the Ruach which, in the natural man, feeleth them but vaguely and comprehendeth them not. The faculties of the Earth are shown forth in the organs which digest and putrify, casting forth the impurities, even as the Earth is placed above the Qlipoth. Thou wilt say, then, that the Ruach cannot be the reasoning mind, seeing that it reflecteth its reason from Chokmah and Binah- but it is the executive faculty which reasoneth, which worketh with and combineth the faculties reflected into it. The reasoning mind, therefore, is that which useth and combineth the Principia of Chokmah and Binah so that the parts of Chokmah and Binah which touch the Ruach are the initiators of the reasoning power. The reason itself is a process and but a simulacrum of the action of the higher Wisdom and Understanding. For the Air is not the Light-only the"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"102 The Golden Dawn: Volume I Book One <207> translator of the Light. Yet without the Air, the operations of the Light could not so well be carried out. The word Ruach, Spirit, also meaneth Air. It is like a thing that goeth out thou knowest not whither, and cometh in thou knowest not whence. 'The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh nor whither it goeth. So is every one that is born of the Spirit.' This Air, theRuach, permeateth the whole physical body but its concen- trated influence is about the heart. Yet, were it not for the boundary force of Chokrnah and Binah above, of the sphere of sensation surrounding it, and of Malkuth below, the Ruach could not concentrate under the presidency of the Name, and the life of the body would cease. Thus far concerning the Ruach as a whole, that is, the action of the Will in Tiphareth. From Netzach and Hod are formed the thighs and legs, and they ter- minate in the symbols of five, as do the arms; but they are not so moveable, owing to the effect of Malkuth. In them are placed the faculties of support and firmness and balance; and they show the more physical qualities of the Ruach. In them is the sustaining force of the Ruach. They are the affirmation of the Pillars of the Sephiroth, as answering to the Passive, the arms more answering to the two pillars which are Active. They are the columns of the Human Temple. From Yesod are formed the generative and excretory organs, <208> and therein is the seat of the lower desires, as bearing more on the double nature of, on the one hand, the rejection of the Qlippoth, and on the other hand the simulacrum of the vital forces in Tiphareth. It is the spe- cial seat of the automatic consciousness. That is, not the Will, but the simulac- rum of the Will in Tiphareth. Yesod is the lowest of the Sephiroth of the Ruach, and representeth \"Fundamental Ation.\" It therefore governeth generation. In Yesod is therefore the automatic consciousness or simulac- rum of the Will. This automatic consciousness is to the Nephesch what the Daath action is to the Ruach. Thus, therefore, there being a simulacrum or reflection of the heart and vital organs in the parts governed by Yesod, if the consciousness of the Tiphareth be given unto this wholly, it shall pave the way for disease and death. For this will be a withdrawing of the vital forces of the Name, which are in the citadel of Tiphareth, to locate them in Yesod, which is a more easily attacked position. For the automatic consciousness is the translator of the Ruach unto the Nephesch. From Malkuth is formed the whole physical body under the command and presidency of the Nephesch. The Nephesch is the subtle body of refined astral Light upon which, as on an invisible pattern, the physical body is extend- ed. The physical body is permeated throughout by the rays of the Ruach, of which it is the material completion. The Nephesch shineth through the Material body and formeth the Magical Mirror or Sphere of Sensation. This Magical Mirror or Sphere of Sensation is an imitation or copy of the Sphere of the Universe. The space between the physical body and the <209> boundary of the sphere of Sensation is occupied by the ether of the astral world; that is to say, the container or recipient of the Astral"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Fifth Knowledge Lecture 103 Rays of the Macrocosm. The Nephesch is divided into its seven Palaces, combining the Sephirotic influences in their most material forms. That is, the world of passions dominated by the Ruach, or by the world which is beyond. That is, its Sephiroth are passionate, expressing a passionate dominion. Thus, its three Supernal Sephiroth, Kether, Chokmah and Binah, are united in a sense of feeling and comprehending impressions. Its Chesed is expressed by laxity of action. Its Geburah by violence of action. Its Tiphareth is expressed by more or less sensual contemplation of beauty, and love of vital sensation. Its Hod and Netzach, by physical well-being and health. Its Yesod, by physical desires and gratifications. Its Malkuth, by absolute increase and domination of matter in the material body. The Nephesch is the real, the actual body, of which the material body is only the result through the action of Ruach, which by the aid of the Nephesch, formeth the material body by the rays of Ruach, which do not ordinarily proceed beyond the limits of the physical body. That is to say, in the ordinary man the rays of Ruach rarely penetrate into the sphere of Sensation. Shining through infinite worlds, and darting its rays through the confines of space, in this Sphere of Sensation is a faculty placed <210> even as a light is placed within a lantern. This is a certain sense placed in an aperture of the upper part of the Ruach wherein act the rays from Chokmah and Binah which govern the reason- Daath. This faculty can be thrown downwards into the Ruach, and thence can radiate into the Nephesch. It consists of seven manifestations answering to the Hexagram, and is like the Soul of Microprosopus or the Elohim of the human Tetragrammaton. Therefore in the head, which is its natural and chief seat, are f ormed the seven apertures of the head. This is the Spiritual Consciousness as distinct from the human consciousness. It is manifested in 7 as just said or in 8 if Daath be included. The Father is the Sun (Chokmah). The mother is the Moon (Binah). The wind beareth it in his bosom (Ruach). Its Nurse is the Earth (Nephesch). The power is manifested when it can be vibrated through the Earth. The following is the true attribution of the seven apertures of the head: ...... Right Ear. ..... .Saturn Left Ear. .Jupiter Right Eye.. .... Sol Left Eye. ...... .Luna Mouth. ....... .Mercury (who is the messenger of the Gods) Right Nostral. . Mars Left nostral.. .. Venus These latter represent here the sonoriferous sense. The right and left eye, the luminous sense, as the Sun and Moon are the luminaries of-the Macrocosm. The right and left nostrils through which the breath pass- es, giving strength to the physical body, are under Mars and Venus. The mouth is under Mercury, the messenger and the Speaker. This spiritual consciousness is a focus of the action of Neschamah.The lower will-power should control the descent of this spiritual consciousness"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The Golden Dawn: Volume I Book One into the Ruach, and thence into the Nephesch, for the consciousness must <211> descend into the Nephesch before the images of the Sphere of Sensation can be perceived. For it is only the rays of this consciousness permeat- ing the Ruach that can take cognizance thereof. This faculty of the spiritual con- sciousness is the seat of Thought. Thought is a Light proceeding from the radiation of this spiritual consciousness, traversing the Ruach as Light traver- Seth Air, and encountering thereafter the symbols reflected in the sphere of Sen- sation, or magical mirror of the Universe. These symbols are by its radiation (i.e. that of the Thought) reflected again into the Spiritual Consciousness where they are subjected unto the action of the ReasoningMind and of the Lower Will. That is, in the ordinary natural man when awake, the thought acteth through the Ruach, subject when there to the action of the Lower Will, and submitted to the reasoning power derived as aforesaid from Chokmah and Binah. But in the ordi- nary man when sleeping, and in the madman, the idiot, and the drunkard, the process is not quite the same. In the sleeping man, the concentration of the Ruach in his heart during the waking time hath produced a weakening of the action of the Ruach in its subsidiary Sephiroth in the Physical Body. To preserve the salu- tary conjunction of theRuach with theNephesch in the physical body (whoselim- its are fixed by the Sephiroth of the Ruach) it is necessary to weaken the concentration in Tiphareth to repair the strain which is produced by the concen- tration of the Ruach therein during the waking state. This reflux of the Ruach into its subsidiary Sephiroth produceth naturally a weakening of the Lower < 212 > Will; and the Ruach, therefore, doth not reflect so clearly the Reasoning Faculty. Wherefore, the thought of the spiritual consciousness reflecteth the image in a confused series, which are only partially realised by the lowerwill. (This is as regards the ordinary natural man in sleep.) In the madman, as considered apart from obsession (thought-obsession is frequently the accompaniment of mania, and still more frequently its cause) the thought and lower will are very strongly exercised to the detriment of the rea- soning faculty. That is, that there is an alliance between the two former which overpowereth the action of Chokmah and Binah in the latter. Monomania is shown in the consideration of only one certain symbol which is too attractive to the Will. A chain of thought is therefore simply a grad- uated vibration arising from the contact of a ray of thought with a symbol. If con- trolled by the reasoning power and licensed by the Will, such vibrations will be balanced and of equal length. But if uncontrolled by the lower Will and the Rea- son, they will be unbalanced and inharmonious. (That is, of uneven length.) In the case of the drunkard, the equilibrium of the Sphere of Sensation and consequently of the Nephesch, is disturbed. In consequence the thought rays are shaken at each vibration, so that the sphere of sensation of the Neph- esch is caused to rock and waver at the extremities of the Physical Body where the Ruach action is bounded. The thought therefore is dazzled by the sym- bols of the Sphere of Sensation, in the same way as the eyes can be dazzled in front of a mirror if the latter be shaken or waved. The sensation"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Fifth Knowledge Lecture 105 <213> therefore then conveyed by the thoughts is that of the Sphere of Sensation oscillating and almost revolving about the physical body, bringing giddiness, sickness, vertigo and the loss of idea of place and posi- tion. Nearly the same may be said of Seasickness, and the action of cer- tain drugs. Restoration of the equilibrium of the Sphere of Sensation after this naturally produceth a slackening of the concentration of the Ruach in Tiphareth, whence sleep is an absolute necessity to the drunkard. This is so imperative that he cannot fight against the need. If he does so, or if this condi- tion be constantly repeated, the thought rays are launched through the Sphere of Sensation so irregularly and so violently that they pass its bound- ary without either the lower Will or the Reasoning Power or even the Thought itself consenting thereto; and the latter is therefore without the pro- tection of the will. Thence arise the conditions of delirium tremens, and an opening is made in the Sphere of Sensation which is unguarded, and through which hostile influences may enter. But this latter cometh under the head of obsession. All thought action in the spiritual consciousness originateth in radia- tion, and radiation is as inseparable from the spiritual consciousness as it is from Light. This Spiritual Consciousness is the focus of the action of Neschamah. The spiritual consciousness is, in its turn, the Throne or Vehicle of the Life of the Spirit which is Chiah; and these combined form the Chariot of that Higher Will which is in Kether. Also it is the peculiar faculty of Neschamah to aspire unto that which is beyond. The Higher Will manifests itself through Yechidah. The Chiah is the real Life Principle, as distinct from the more <214> illusionary life of the Physical Body. The Shining Flame of the Divine Fire, the Kefher of the Body, is the Real Self of the Incarnation. Yet but few of the sons of men know it or feel its presence. Still less do they believe in or comprehend those Higher Potencies-Angelic, Archangelic or Divine, of which the manifestation directly touching Yechidah is the Higher Genius. This Yechidah in the ordinary man can but rarely act through the spiritual consciousness, seeing that for it to do so the King of the Physical Body, that is the Lower Will, must rise from his Throne to acknowledge his superior. That is the reason why, in some cases, in sleep only doth the Higher Will manifest itself by dream unto the ordinary man. In other cases it may be manifested; at times through the sincere practice of religious rites, or in cases where the opportunity for self-sacrifice occurreth. In all these cases the Lower Will hath for a moment recognised a higher form of itself, and the YHVH of the man hath reflected from the Eternal Lord of the Higher Life. This Yechidah is the only part of the man which can truly say-EI-IEIEH, I am. This is then but the Kether of the Assiah of the Microcosm, that is, it is the highest part of man as Man. It is that which toucheth, or is the manifestation of a higher and greater range of Being. This Yechidah is at the same time the Higher Human Self and the Lower Genius, the God of the Man, the Atziluth of his Assiah, even as Chiah and Neschamah form his Briah, and Ruach his Yetzirah. This is the Higher Will and the Divine Consciousness, as Daath is the Spiritual Con-"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"106 The Golden Dawn: Volume I Book One sciousness, Tiphareth the Human Consciousness, and Yesod the Auto- matic Consciousness. It is the Divine Consciousness because it is the only part of man <215> which can touch the All-potent forces. Behind Yechidah are Angelic and Archangelic Forces of which Yechidah is the manifestor. It is therefore the Lower Genius or Viceroy of the Higher Genius which is beyond, an Angel Mighty and Terrible. This Great Angel is the Higher Genius, beyond which are the Archangelic and Divine. Recall the Tiphareth clause of an Adeptus Minor: ''I further solemnly promise and swear that with the divine permission I will from this day for- ward apply myself unto the Great Work which is so to purify and exalt my spiritual nature, that with the Divine Aid I may at length attain to be more than Human, and thus gradually raise and unite myself to my Higher and Divine Genius, and that in this event, I will not abuse the great power entrust- ed unto me.\" Note that this clause answereth unto Tiphareth, seeing that it is the Lower Will that must apply itself unto this work, because it is the King of the Physical Man. All the Shining Ones (whom we call Angels) are microcosms of the Macrocosm Yetzirah, even as Man is the microcosm of the Macrocosm of Assiah. All Archangelic forms are microcosms of the Macrocosm of Briah, and the Gods of the Sevhiroth are conseauentlv the Microcosms of the Mac- rocosm of Atziluth. hiref fore apply this ierfeiting of the Spiritual Nature as the preparation of the Pathway for the Shining Light, the Light Divine. The evil persona of a man is in the Sphere of the Qlippoth, and the devils are the Microcosms of the Macrocosm of the Qlippoth. This evil per- <216> sona hath its parts and divisions, and of it the part which toucheth the Malkuth of the Nephesch is its Kether. Tremble therefore at the evil forces which be in thy own evil persona. And as above the Kether of a Man are his Angelic and other forms, so below the Malkuth of the Evil Per- sona are awful forms, dangerous even to express or think of. <217> TASK UNDERTAKEN BY THE ADEPTUS MINOR This, then, is the task to be undertaken by the Adeptus Minor. To expel from the Sephiroth of the Nephesch the usurpation by the evil Sephiroth; to balance the action of the Sephiroth of the Ruachin those of the Nephesch. To prevent the Lower Will and Human Consciousness from falling into and usurping the place of the Automatic Consciousness. To render the King of the Body, the Lower Will, obedient to and anxious to execute the commands of the Higher Will, that he be neither a usurper of the faculties of the Higher, nor a sensual despot-but an Initiated Ruler, and an anointed King, the viceroy and representative of the Higher Will, because inspired thereby, in his Kingdom which is man. Then shall it happen that the Higher Will, i.e., the Lower Genius, shall descend into the Royal Habitation, so that the Higher Will and the Lower Will shall be as one, and the Higher Genius shall descend into the Kether of the Man, bringing with him the tremendous illumination of his Angelic Nature. And the Man shall become what is said of Enoch. \"And"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Fifth Knowledge Lecture 107 Chanokh made himself to walk with God, and he was not, for God took him.\" (Genesis, V. v. 24.) Then also this shalt thou know, that the Nephesch of the Man shall become as the Genius of the Evil Persona, so that the evil persona itself shall be as the power of the Divine in the Qlippoth, as it is said: \"Whither shall I go from thy Spirit, or whither from thy Presence shall I flee? If I ascend up to Heaven, thou art there. If I make my bed in Hell, behold thou art there.\" (Ps. cxxxix.) Therefore even the Evil Persona is not so evil when it fulfileth <218> its work. For it is the beginning of a dim reflection of the Light unto the Qlippoth, and this is what is hidden in the saying that \"Typhon is the brother of Osiris.\" Hear thou, then, a mystery of the knowledge of evil. The @ = Ritual of the Adeptus Minor saith that even the \"Evil helpeth for- ward the Good.\" When the evil Sephiroth are expelled from the Nephesch into the Evil Persona, they are, in a sense, equilibriated therein. The evil per- sona can be rendered as a great and strong, yet trained, animal whereupon the man rideth, and it then becometh a strength unto his physical base of action. This Mystery shalt thou keep from the knowledge of the First Order, and still more from that of the Outer World, that is as a formula, seeing that it is a dangerous secret. Now then shalt thou begin to understand the saying \"He descended into Hell,\" and also to comprehend in part this strength, and thus begin to under- stand the necessity of evil unto the material creation. Wherefore, also, revile not overmuch the evil forces, for they have also a place and a duty, and in this consisteth their right to be. But check their usurpation, and cast them down unto their plane. Unto this end, curse them by the mighty names if need be, but thou shalt not revile them for their condition, for thus also shalt thou be led into error. There is also a great mystery that the Adeptus Minor must know, viz.: How the spiritual consciousness can act around and beyond the sphere of Sensation. ''Thought\" is a mighty force when projected with all the strength of the lower Will under the guidance of the reasoning faculty and illuminated by the Higher Will. Therefore, it is that, in thy occult <219> working, thou art advised to invoke the Divine and Angelic Names, so that thy Lower Will may willingly receive the influx of the Higher Will, which is also the Lower Genius behind which are the all-potent forces. This, therefore, is the magical manner of operation of the Initiate when \"skry- ing\" in the spirit vision. Through his own arcane wisdom, he knows the dis- position and correspondences of the Forces of the Macrocosmos. Selecting not many, but one symbol, and that balanced and with its correlatives, then sendeth he a thought-ray from his Spiritual Consciousness, illuminated by his Higher Will, directly unto the part of his Sphere of Sensation which is consonant with the symbol employed. There, as in a mirror, doth he perceive its properties as reflected from the Macrocosmos, shining forth into the Infinite Abyss of the Heavens. Thence can he follow the ray of reflection therefrom, and while concentrating his united consciousness at that point of his sphere of sensation, can receive the direct reflection of the ray from the"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The Golden Dawn: Volume I Book One Macrocosmos. Thus receiving the direct ray as then reflected into his Thought, he can unite himself with the ray of his Thought so as to make one continuous ray from the corresponding point of the Macrocosmos unto the centre of his consciousness. If, instead of concentrating at that actual point of the sphere of Sensation he shall retain the thought-ray only touching the sphere of sensation at that point, he shall, it is true, perceive the reflection of the Macrocosmic Ray answering to that symbol in the sphere of his Con- sciousness. But he shall receive this reflection tinctured much by his own nature, and therefore to an extent untrue, because his united con- <220> sciousnesses have not been able to focus along the thought-ray at the circumference of the Sphere of sensation. And this is the reason why there are so many and multifarious errors in untrained spirit visions. For the untrained seer, even supposing him free from the delusions of obsession, doth not know or understand how to unite his consciousnesses and the har- monies between his own sphere of sensation, and the universe, the mac- rocosmos. Therefore is it so necessary that the Adeptus Minor should correctly understand the principia and axiomata of our secret knowledge, which are contained in our Rituals and Lectures. OF TRAVELING IN THE SPIRIT VISION The symbol, place, direction, or Plane being known whereon it is desired to act, a thought-ray as before is sent unto the corresponding part of the Sphere of Sensation of the Nephesch. The Thought-Ray is sent like an arrow from the bow, right through the circumference of the Sphere of Sensa- tion direct unto the place desired. Arrived there, a sphere of astral Light is formed by the agency of the Lower Will, illuminated by the Higher Will, and acting through the spiritual consciousness by reflection along the Thought- Ray. This sphere of Astral Light is partly drawn from the surrounding atmos- phere. This sphere being formed, a simulacrum of the person of the Skryer is reflected into it along the thought-ray, and this united consciousness is then projected therein. This Sphere is then a duplicate, by reflection, of the Sphere of Sensation. As it is said: \"Believe thyself to be in a place and thou art there.\" In this Astral Projection, however, a certain part of the consciousness must remain in the body to protect the Thought-Ray beyond the <221> Sphere of Sensation (as well as the Sphere itself at that point of deparhue of the Thought-Ray) from attack by any hostile force, so that the consciousness in this projection is not quite so strong as the con- sciousness when concentrated in the natural body in ordinary life. The return taketh place with a reversal of this process, and save to persons whose Nephesch and physical body are exceptionally strong and healthy, the whole operation of skrying and traveling in the Spirit Vision is of course fa- tiguing. Also there is another mode of astral projection which can be used by the more practised and advanced Adept. This consisteth in forming first a sphere from.his own Sphere of Sensation, casting his reflection therein, and then ' projecting this whole sphere to the desired place, as in the previous method."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Fifth Knowledge Lecture But this is not easy to be done by any but the practised operator. Thus far, regarding Skrying and Travelling in the Spirit Vision. (These instructions are considerably amplified with practical examples in a later volume dealing with Astral vision and clairvoyance. I. R.) <222> CONCERNING THE MICROCOSMS OF MACROCOSM As thou well knowest there be many and numberless other inhabitants of the Macrocosmos besides Man, Angels, and Devils. The animals are microcosms in a sense, yet not so complete as man. In them are many and great mysteries. They also have their magical mirror or sphere of sensation. But its polarisation is usually horizontal rather than perpendicular, and this is owing to the Sephiroth not being shown therein. This Sphere, then, is not bounded by the Sephirothic columns, but they are especially governed by the Stellar System without the Sephiroth. They are therefore ruled by the Paths, rather than by the Sephiroth, and are consequently classed each under an Element or a Planet, and a Sign. Thus each followeth a formula which may be translated into letters, and these again form a vibratory name. As it is writ- ten: \"And Adam gave names unto all the cattle and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field.\" (Gen. 11, v. 20.) Yet they are ruled by the name YHVH, though classed rather by one or more of its letters: Thus, Fish, etc., are under the influence of Water Birds are under the influence of Air Quadrupeds are under the influence of Fire Creeping things and insects are under the influence of Earth There are some which partake of two elements, but in them one element is usually chief, and besides the Elements, each is under a Planet and a Sign. The vegetable kingdom is again under a somewhat different <223> Law. These are under a Planet and a Sign, a planet first differentiated by a Sign. The Mineral Kingdom is under the Signs only. Vegetables have a Sphere of Sensation, but corresponding only to the Planets and Zodiacal Signs. The Minerals have also a Sphere which correspondeth unto the Signs only. But the metals are under the Planets only, and therein is the difference between them and the Minerals, wherefore also are they stronger. Shining Stones are especially under the Light; and they are, as it were, centres for the action thereof in the darkness of matter, as it is said: \"My light is concealed in all that shineth.\" (This passage is believed to be from the Zend-Avesta.) They are therefore under the rule of the three active elements with an earthy base. Shining through all things as a whole, are the rays of the Macrocosmos. Besides these classes of life there be multitudinous existences representing Forces of the Macrocosm, each with its own microcosm. Such are Elemental Spirits, Planetary Spirits, Olympic Spirits, Fays, Arch-Fays, Genii, and many other potencies which cannot be classed under these forms."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"110 The Golden Dawn: Volume I Book One Thus the Macrocosmic Universe is one vast infinite sphere contain- ing so many and diverse infinite microcosmic forms, of which the perfect knowledge is only known unto the advanced Adept. Also it shall here suffice to say that thou shalt make a distinction between the Four-handed race (the quadrumana, Apes and monkeys) which be midway between Man and Beast and other animals. For they be <224> neither the oneor the other, but are the fallen and debased result of a most ancient magical effect to formulate a material and imme- diate link between the human and animal microcosms. This is elsewhere treated of, and it shall here be sufficient to say that they are not an ascent, from the beast unto the Man, but a mistaken magical fall from a man unto a beast. Anciently they were a terrible power upon this planet, as then hav- ing more of the man than of the animal, whereas now they have more of the animal than of Man. The ancient traditions of their primal conditions are preserved unto this day in the legends of ogres and, in certain records, can- nibalism and its rites. Regarding the beasts, they are, for the most part, easily obsessed, and they have not the spiritual responsibility of the man. Their nature is not evil, but, following a natural law--seeing that man is head of the Assi- atic creation--so the animal is higher than the vegetables or mineral. Also bear thou well in mind that the race of the transformers are given unto cru- elty. Such are above all the race of creeping things. As Man hath his Ruach which is upright in the Tree of Life, so hath the beast his Ruach which is horizontal; as it is said: \"The Ruach of a man which goeth upwards (i.e. directeth itself upwards), and the Ruach of the beast which goeth down- wards (or crosswise) in the Earth.\" The Neschamah in the Beast is not. The beast consisteth of a Ruach and a Nephesch with a rudimentary Daath or Spiritual Consciousness. This Daath ever seeketh that which is beyond it and thence are beasts not responsible, but are submitted unto obsession, and herein is a great mysteryr~an, therefore, is placed at the head of the beasts. Woe, woe, unto him if he teacheth their elementary Daath cruel- ty and injustice instead of mercy and justice. For the Man is a God unto the Beast, and the aspiration of the Beast is toward the Man, c225' and great is the office of the Beast, for he prepareth the foundation for the man. Man is responsible for creation, and since he was orig- inally placed in creation to be its Lord, as he is, so will the creation fol- low him. And thus it is possible for the Genius of a Nation to change the climate of a country, and the nature of the beasts therein. Men fell from primal estate, and then they who were formless became imaged in form, deformed. And this is a mystery of the Demonic Plane which entereth not into this section. The Elemental Spirits and others of their kind are an organisation not quite so complete as man. In spiritual consciousness more keen, and yet in some ways his spiritual superior though organically his inferior. They are the formers of the primal Man, that is the Elementary Man, and they have other and greater-offices, for in them are many worlds and ranks and spheres. They are as the younger man (i.e. child) and towards them also is Man responsible, and he hath wrought them much injustice."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Fiffh Knowledge Lecture OF OBSESSION, TRANCE, DEATH Obsession always entereth through a cutting off of the Higher from the Lower Will, and it is ordinarily first induced by a Thought-Ray of the Spiritual consciousness (whence one danger of evil thoughts) ill-governed, penetrat- ing the Sphere of Sensation and admitting another potency, either human embodied, or human disembodied, elemental or demonic. The first action of such a force is to flatter the lower will, until he shall have established firmly an entrance into the Sphere of Sensation, and thus shall cause a strain on the Nephesch which shall render the Ruach less concentrated. As soon as the Ruach is sufficiently dispersed to repair the strain on the physical body, the lower will is weakened, and is soon seized upon and bound by the invader. Whence arise the sensations of chill and drowsiness which are the usual forerunners of obsession. Now to yield the force necessary to overpower the lower will from any chance of communication with the higher the obsessing idea proceeds by seizing upon the Daath, and this consequently is the great point of attack, especially the part in the physical body which is at the back of the head about the junction with the Spine. Now unless the lower Will shall voluntarily endeavour to restore the connection, it is impossible for the Higher Will to intervene, seeing that the Lower Will is King of the Physical Body. Remember that no obsessing force can overpower the lower will, if that shall bravely and in spite of all opposition aspire unto the Higher Will. Trance may arise from the action of obsession, or from the ac- <227> tion of the Higher Will, therefore its aspects are varied. Death superveneth in the naturalman, when the mental action of the Ruach and the Nephesch is definitely and thoroughly interrupted in the physical body. In the Adept death can only supervene when the Higher Will consenteth thereto, and herein is implied the whole Mystery of the Elixir of Life.

The setting is Ancient Egyptian, particularly based upon the 125th Chapter of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, and the@= ElHall is also called \"The Hall of Maat,\" the \"Hall of Two Truths\", and the \"Hall of Dual Manifestation.\" The Hall of Maat is the scene for the weighing of the Soul where the crucial judgment of the deceased is made. Just as the deceased Anils soul hangs in the balance, the soul and aspiration of the candidate for @ = Grade of Neophyte hang between light and dark, evolution or devolution. The numerous gods of the Egyptian judgment are represented in the @ = mby the stations of the officers, their functions and movements in the temple. These stations and the god-forms attributed are fully described in the \"Z\" documents (later chapters in this book).l All are well worth the time to read carefully-\". . . therefore learn not as an unreasoning child, but meditate, search out and compare,. . .Ir2 Besides the seven officers and their corresponding god-forms, there are Invisible Stations, with associated deities, which do not move in the temple and are very significant as representing the balance of opposing forces in the Hall of Two Truths. The Invisible Station corresponding to the Yesod, the 9th Sephirah on the Tree of Life, immediately East of the Altar which is in the upper region of Malkuth in the @ = El temple, is the abode of a Set-like god-form associated with the Evil Triad and at the same time with a dark reptilian god associated with Typhon (see descrip- tion of three in one, in \"Z. 3.\" He is the Accusor, the Evil Genius, who would bind the candidate's soul in darkness with forces of the Qlippoth. In the Neophyte Initiation the Accusor rises from the base of the Altar at the time of the soul's greatest danger. During this vulnerable time, four Invisible Stations attributed to the Sons of Horus3 protect the vital organs, symbolic of the essential life forces, until after the Oath has been taken and judgment has been passed. Before the Hierophant administers the Oath he leaves the Throne of the East. The god-form of Osiris, represented by the Hierophant on the Throne, remains there maintaining the balance of forces in the temple. As the Hierophant passes between the Pillars on the way to the Altar, he assumes a second form of his Office which is having consented to take the obligation, is unprepared for this most delicate hase of initiation. Thrice bound and hoodwinked, the seeker is graver than he knows, uninitiated and in ignorance, totally de en- P dent on the surroundin balance of forces. The Hierophant's 0 fice now represents the can%idatels Higher and Divine Genius, which in his blindness he cannot realize himself.

However \"well prepared\" or knowledgeable before initiation, the critical choice of the aspirant's soul is the same for everyone, and is especially equal in the equilibrating system of the Golden Dawn. Also present for the judgement, disappearing after the Oath, are the Invisible Stations of the 42 Assessors. These god-forms are more like accusors than assessors, as the deceased in the Book of the Dead is required to deny to each one of them a particular crime or fault in the \"Negative Confession.\" In the @ = rn temple these gods are represented through visualization by the officers, reinforced by other members pre- sent. Contemplation of these and the other god-forms and stations will enhance experience of the ceremony and facilitate the establishing of the Neophyte energies in all participants. THE TREE OF LIFE IN THE TEMPLES OF THE OUTER ORDER The representation of the Tree of Life in the Outer Order temples reflects the harmony and balance of that simple and infinite diagram. The philosophy of the Qabalah is expressed in the temple's changing patterns throughout the grade rituals and in the rhythm of activity within the ritu- als individually. Regardless of nationality, religion, language, etc. of the god-forms and forces represented, they are consistently balanced and in alignment with the different levels of manifestation in the temple and on the Tree, in their attributes, functions and with the magical purpose of the ceremonies. Systematically working through the grades can provide unexpected insights, new perspectives and a broader understanding of the synthesis of magical, religious, and scientific aspects of the Great Work as it relates to the rowth and processin of the aspiring student. The four Sephiroth o f the @=a are the on f y ones shown in the Outer Order temples. The stations and officers as appropriate, follow the Tree thru the Elemental Grades from @ =n to @ = Malkuth is the Sephi- rah of the Neophyte and Zelator grades, Theoricus is in Yesod, Practicus in Hod, Philosophus in Netzach. In a sense all Outer Order ceremonies take place in Malkuth as they never leave the world of Assiah represent- ed macrocosmically by Malkuth. The floor plan of the temple as an ideal, geometrically perfect reality may not be visible in the less than erfect surroundings of the partici- pants' living room, bedroom, union I! all, or whatever place has been cho- sen for a ceremony. There are significant connections to be discovered in the arrangement of the temple. Experimentation and application of num- ber systems, including the Hebrew alphabet and numbers, and geometri- cal concepts like the symbols introduced as Meditations in the Knowledge Lectures of each grade can lead students to lea s in understanding of the relationships between the Qabalah and the Go I! den Dawn system. Practice in drawing the Tree in different wa s, connecting paths with Sephiroth in the endless vane of patterns, wil aid in determlning a satisfactory eo- a r metric model an a method of drawing the Tree which students o P the Qabalah and the Golden Dawn will use countless times. The potential for discovery is exponential with conscious, receptive experience of the ritu- als-literally walking the Paths-and dedicated, directed study, assimi- lating and synthesizing knowledge and experience over time.

The Double Cubical Altar in the centre of the Hall, is an emblem of visible Nature or the Material Universe, concealing within herself the mysteries of all dimensions, while revealing her surface to the exterior senses. It is a double cube because, as the Emerald Tablet has said \"The things that are below are a reflection of the things that are above.\"The world of men and women created to unhappiness is a reflection of the World of Divine Beings created to Happiness. It is described in the SEPHER YETSIRAH, or The Book of Formation, as \"An Abyss of Height\" and as an ''Abyss of Depth \"An Abyss of the East\" and \"An Abyss of the West\", \"An Abyss of the North\" and \"An Abyss of the South.\" The Altar is black because, unlike Divine Beings who unfold in the Element of Light, the Fires of Created Beings arise from Darkness and Obscurity. On the Altar is a White Triangle to be the Image of that Immortal Light, that Triune Light, which moved in Darkness and formed the World of Darkness and out of Darkness.

At its East, South, West and North Angles are aRose, Fire, Cup of Wine and Bread and Salt. These allude to the Four Elements, Air, Fire, Water, Earth.

Thus also, the Truths which by material Science we investigate, are but special examples of the all-per- vading Laws of the Universe. So, within this pure and limpid fluid, lie hidden and unperceived of mortal eyes, the elements bearing the semblance of blood, even as within the mind and brain of the Initiate lie concealed the Divine Secrets of the Hidden Knolwedge. Yet if the Oath be forgotten, and the solemn pledge broken, then that which is secret shall be revealed, even as this pure fluid reveals the sem- blance of blood. Kern adds fluid from the other dish. Let this remind thee ever, 0 Neophyte, how easily by a careless or unthinking word, thou mayst betray that which thou hast sworn to keep secret and rnayst reveal the Hidden Knowledge imparted to thee, and planted in thy brain and in thy mind. And let the hue of blood remind thee that if thou shalt fail in this thy oath of secrecy, thy blood may be poured out and thy body broken; for heavy is the penalty exacted by the Guardians of the Hidden Knowledge from those who wilfully betray their trust. <39> Hierophant comes to the table.

As a whole these grades represent the fundamental work of the Outer Order which is to equilibrate the elemental forces in the working tem- ple and in the psyches of individuals, whether participating as officers or as aspiring candidates for advancement. These ceremonies will be referred to here generally as the Grade Cere- monies for the purpose of providing an overall description of the ritual pat- terns repeated and expounded in progression thru the Outer Order. To provide ceremonies which can be read and performed from the text, lengthy explanations concerning the many details of performance are not practical. At the same time, familiarity with the essential formula and basic under- standing prior to attempting the ceremonies will effect a smooth flow of ritual work enhancing effectiveness. This also makes it easier for participants to become aware of specific relationships and symbolism described by pre- cise ritual activity within the basic framework of the Grade Ceremonies. Study of the pattern common to all four would also aid in memorization of the ceremonies. Performance of any magickal working from memory is a realizable ideal worth some time and effort as the subtleties of the energiesat work are more easily perceived when the mind is free from chores like find- ing the right page, reading instructions or wondering why you're standing and everyone else is sitting. The further participants can get from ordinary day to day consciousness the more receptive they can become to the extra- ordinary influences which are only available to the intuitiveless intel- lectual faculties. Much can be understood only by experience as an initiate, then as dif- ferent officers, and in the steeping of students in the study and practice of the Grade Ceremonies, individually and/or collectively, over a period of time. .Don't be discouraged by errors during ceremony - They are sure to occur. To let imperfection stop the aspiring student would end the spiritual journey at the very first step which recognizes and accepts human ignorance and error. As the dedicated student continues to patiently aspire to be more than human, to transcend physical limitations, while forgiving himself for mis- takes and setbacks along the way, the ceremonies will become increasingly precise and effective. Regular repetition awakens and establishes the ener- gies gradually through sincere sustained effort. When a mistake is made dur- ing ritual work, simply return to the point immediately preceding the error with as little disruption as possible and carefully repeat from there after mak- ing certain of the correct procedure. Hopefully, no matter how elevated by study and initiation the student's understanding may become, he will dis- cover that the Grade Ceremonies are not to be learned, performed, perfected and left behind; the potential for insight is endless, with levels upon levels of meaning and symbol never exhausted, always new. Initiation into the Elemental Grades is a starting point from which"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"136 The Golden Dawn: Volume I1 Book Two students may begin to comprehend the wholeness of the Outer Order. By the synthesis of the four elements, in relation to the Hall of the Neophytes and as a preparation for Inner Order Initiation and work, continuous inte- gration will dynamically balance the forces in the entire being. The Openings and Closings of each grade follow a similar format which is relatively easy to follow and brief to carry out. There are a few points of etiquette appropriate to anyone involved whether in a group or alone, as an officer or observer, which add significance to the ceremony and empha- size the special existence of the spiritual temple wherever it is located. The intention behind special names, clothing, movement-i..e., every- thing concerning ritual work-is to produce a state of mind quite different from the ordinary non-ritual state. These special signals, in association with all that is done in performing the ceremonies, cultivate a \"habit\" which will trigger participants to assume this state of mind spontaneous- ly in preparation for magickal work. Students can, with a little imagina- tion, find numerous ways of consciously producing mental receptivity to the intended work. One could begin by quieting the mind with rhythmic breathing and meditation on an appropriate image; for example, a great preparation for a Grade Ceremony would be to contemplate the appropri- ate symbolism as in the Meditation given in each Grade's Knowledge Lec- ture.* Groups or individuals may decide upon a special rite of entry into the temple signaling commencement of ceremonial behavior when all is ready to begin. A quiet, though not somber, mood should be encouraged, limiting extraneous speech, movement and noise. Make doubly sure all is arranged and supplies available as needed before starting to avoid last minute shuf- fling. Lock doors, draw curtains, take the phone off the hook and in gen- eral ensure as much as possible that there will be no rude or embarrassing interruptions. Discretion in magical activities, as is advised in the @= El Initiation so emphatically, is as important to the unseen workings and effectiveness of ceremony as the secrecy of the visible, physical location of the temple is to the protection from unwanted observation, eavesdropping, or even deliberate interference. In any temple of the Outer Order, the Sign of the Enterer or Projecting Sign is given toward the East upon entering and the Sign of Silence given when leaving. These Signs, special to the @= El Grade of Neophyte are used in the Elemental Ceremonies in a specific way, as the interpene- tration of the @= which encompasses the whole, is followed through the Outer Order. These Signs are not given for grade identification in the Elemental Ceremonies but as signals to indicate the beginning and ending of individual events, usually by an officer. Non-officiating members move very little or not at all in the temple but when necessary movement is always clockwise and the Projecting Sign is given in that direction when passing the East. Upon returning to seat or station the Sign of Silence is given signifying completion of that activity. Officers give the Sign of the Enterer toward the Hierophant before begin- ning any movement, before addressing the Hierophant and in *Val.

This is done by rising in place (without holding instruments) facing the East and giving the Sign. Then the officer may take up instrument, speak or move as needed. Upon completion of speech or action the Sign of Silence is given before the next activity begins. Opening the Activity with Projection of energy from the Officer's Station toward the East, carrying out the duty, then Closing with the Sign of Silence to end the energy flow which the Projecting Sign begins aeates a precision in the ritual work, and helps define individual duties of officers and parts of ceremony.

The Hierophant knocks once to signal the onset of the Ceremony when the temple is ready: members robed, seated and quiet; lamps, candles, incense lit; officers at stations wearing appropriate lamens, nemysses, man- tles; with copies of the ritual if needed. The Hiero. tells the officers to assist in Opening the Grade and directs either the Kerux (in @ = and @ = B) or the Hegemon (in @ = rn and 0 = m) to check the temple door. This is done without opening the temple door because the office of Sentinel, open to the members of the Neophyte Grade, is dropped from all grades after @= 2. The Hierophant tells Hiereus to see that all present are members of that Grade. Hiereus rises, giving Sign of Enterer. Then holding his Sword up right, Hiereus asks the members to give the Sign of the grade, which all mem- bers (except the Hiereus and Hierophant) give toward the Altar. Hiereus puts down Sword and gives the Grade Sign after the other members before assuring the Hiero. that all present are members of the Grade, and then gives the Sign of Silence to signal completion of his duty. The Hiero. then gives the Grade Sign towards the Altar, alone. 3. The Stolistes and Dadouchos, stations and offices open to Zelators (mem- bers of the @ = grade), putlfy and conseaate the temple Opening of the @= grade. These officers and their functions are drop ed from the remaining higher grade rituals, as the sentinel is from the a = h . The office of Kerux is omitted likewise from the @ = ade of Practicus as the sta- tion apropos to @ = a. The Ceremonies of &= and @ = b are per- formed with the Chief Officers only. 4. The Hiereus and/or Hegemon name the Element and any Planet, Path(s) and Spheres associated with Path(s) at Hierophant's request. Officers are seated at this time and the short responses by Heg. and/or Hier. are given from their stations without rising, giving @ = Signs. 5. The Hierophant knocks once and stands to announce the Adoration to the East. All members stand, face East, and give the Sign of the Grade, remaining in that position for the duration of the Hierophant's prayer. After \"Arnen!\"all release Grade Sign and remain standing quietly, facing East. 6. The Hierophant now goes to the quarter of the temple appropriate to the Grade, and faces the Enochian Tablet in that direction. The officers follow, and stand in balanced arrangement behind him, forming a Hexagram, facing as the Hierophant. The Tablet should be positioned and centered in that"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"138 The Golden Dawn: Volume I1 Book Two direction, if possible, with the center of the tablet at eye level. A symbol of the Element of the grade is before the Tablet on a small table or side altar. The Hierophant hands Sceptre to officer on his right, takes up the symbol, ges- tures with it three times towards the Tablet: left, right, then center, and pro- claims the invokation of the element by the Divine God Name given to the Sephirah of the Grade. Replacing the symbol before the Tablet, the Hiero- phant takes his Sceptre again in order to trace the invoking figure. The invokation is performed by tracing certain figures in the air in front of and concentric to the Enochian Tablet. With the Sceptre the Hierophant first traces the Circle which will contain the Invoking Pentagrams and con- fine the invoked force of the Element to the quarter. This Invoking Circle is traced in a clockwise direction beginning at the left, or North, as if the top of the Circle represented the East. The Circle is visualized in brilliant white light and is traced from the North edge past the top, completing one full rota- tion at the top, or East. This principle of invoking energy is represented in the Opening of the @= by the Mystical Circumambulation which also begins in the North led by the Kerux, and describes one complete round on the return to the East. Both Circles symbolize the Rising of Light which pre- cedes invokation, and provides the container where the invoked forces are concentrated and focused in the formula of the Magic of Light. The Circle is traced silently, then the Hiero. lowers the Sceptre to the position where the Invoking Pentagram of Spirit will begin. Whether the Spirit invoked is active or passive depends upon the nature of the Element to be invoked. (A de- scription of both the Active and Passive Spirit Pentagrams and how to trace them is given in a later chapter - see page 9, Volume 111.) The Spirit Pen- tagram, active or passive, is visualized in white light, within the Circle already traced, and is \"charged\" by thrusting the Sceptre toward the center, visualizing the figure glowing strongly in the astral light, the brilliance of the Pentagram flaring brightly at the force of the Hiero.'~ projection. The Hierophant then begins the Invoking Pentagram of the Element, following the Circle around with Sceptre from the angle where the Spirit Pentagram ended to the angle where the Pentagram of the Element begins (see page 13, Volume I11 for specific instructions on invoking the Elements by Pentagram). The Pentagram of the Element is visualized in the color of that element as described in the lecture on the Supreme Ritual of the Pentagram and \"charged in the same manner as the Pentagram of Spirit. Both Invoking Pentagrams are traced in silence. Vibrating forcefully, using a full breath, the Hierophant invokes by the Divine Names and Images of the Grade, with Sceptre raised toward the direction of invokation. Again handing his Sceptre to the officer on his right, the hiero. takes up the symbol in front of the Tablet and with it traces the Kerubic Sign of the ele- ment in the center of the Pentagram already traced, \"charging\" the Sign as before. Then, vibrating fully, he invokes in the names of the Archangel, in the three Great Secret Names of God, and in that of the King of the Tablet. The Hiero. replaces the symbol, takes his Sceptre, and all officers return to their stations. The non-officiating members who have been standing, facing the direction of invokation throughout, are also seated as before."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Elemental Grade Ceremonies 139 7. In the name of the Divine Name or Grand Word of the Grade, the Hierophant declares the temple open in the particular grade. 8. Hierophant, Hiereus, and Hegemon, in that order, give the Knocks of the Grade in succession, each completing the alarm before the next begins. Thus the opening of the Grade Ceremony is completed. Initiation into the Elemental Grades 1. Hierophant announces dispensation to advance the candidate for the grade. Hegemon rises and salutes Hierophant with the Sign of the Enterer or Projecting Sign, answering the command to prepare the candidate. If the Hegemon passes the East on the way to the door, moving always clockwise around the temple, the Projecting Sign of the Enterer is given as in @ = circumambulation. The Sign of Silence is given toward the East before leav- ing the temple to prepare the candidate, who is always hoodwinked at first part of the ceremony of advancement. The Hegemon gives the candidate an admission badge to hold in the right hand and gives the knocks of the grade, called 'the alarm', when ready to enter. 2. The candidate is tested in the Token, Step, Grand Word, Mystic Number, and Mystic Password of his present grade. 3. The candidate pledges secrecy concerning the mysteries of this grade, going to the Quarter appropriate to the grade and making the pledge there toward the Tablet. The hoodwink is then removed. 4. The candidate is placed between the Pillars, facing a Portal in the grade to which he seeks admission, represented by the Hebrew letter pictured in the correct direction in relation to the temple. This is a Path on the Tree of Life, in relation to the Sephirah the temple is in. 5. Circumambulations are made in the Rituals of the Paths, the candidate visits the stations, hears speeches of the officers, sees diagrams of the Tree and the Garden of Eden in relationship to the Path. 6. In the East, the Hierophant explains symbolism of the admission badge to that particular Path or Sephirah, and the admission badge is set aside. The symbolism of the Path is explained. 7. Hierophant takes candidate to the West of the Altar and describes, and explains, the symbolism on the Altar, including a Tarot Key on the Path. Also explains other Temple symbolism. 8. Hierophant confers the title Lord or Lady of the (number) Path. Can- didate is led out between Path working and reception into the Grade. Reception into the Sephirah of the Grade 1.

Next the symbolism of Cross, Triangle, etc. on the Altar is explained by the Hierophant. 6. The Hegemon gives his speech on the symbolism of the Sephirah, the Planet, and indicates the Karnea, Sigils and Signs appropriate, as displayed in the temple. 7. The Hierophant confers Mystic Title of Grade upon the candidate and gives the symbol of the Element, which is its name in Hebrew, and proclaims him or her Lord or Lady of (number) Paths. Closing 1. The Hierophant knocks to announce Closing. All rise. 2. Temple security is seen to, the door checked as in the Opening. 3. Hierophant knocks once and all face East for the Adoration. All Salute the East with the Grade Sign after \"Amen\". 4. Hierophant goes to the Quarter and Tablet appropriate to the Grade, and officers arrange themselves behind him as in Opening. 5. Hierophant knocks once and then announces the Elemental Prayer, which all recite together. 6. After the Prayer, Hierophant makes Banishing Pentagrams, first of Spirit, active or passive, then of the Element - tracing and charging each with Sceptre before the Tablet. 7. Hierophant then gives License to Depart, after which all return to places. 8. Hierophant declares the temple closed. 9.

These Twelve Circles further represent the 12 Foundations of the Holy City of the Apocalypse, while in Christian Symbolism the Sun and the Twelve Signs are referred to Christ and His Twelve Apostles. <62> Hegemon leads Neophyte to Hiereus and then returns to his place and is seated. Hiereus leads Neophyte to the South, and says: Hiereus On the Southern side of the Holy Place stood the Seven-Branched Candlestick, wherein was burned pure olive oil. It is an image of the Mystery of the Elohim, the Seven Creative Ideas. The symbolic drawing before you represents its occult meaning. The Seven Cir- cles which surround the Heptagram, represent the Seven Planets and the Seven Qabalistic Palaces of Assiah, the Material World - which answer to the Seven Apocalytic Churches which are in Asia or Assiah - as these again allude to the Seven Lamps before the Throne on another Plane. Within each circle is a triangle to represent the Three Fold Creative Idea operating in all things. On the right hand side of each is the Hebrew Name of the Angel who governs the Planet; on the left side is the Hebrew Name of the sphere of the Planet itself; while the He- brew letter beneath the base is one of the duplicated letters of the Hebrew Alphabet which refer to the Seven Planets. The Seven Double Letters of the Hebrew Alphabet have each two sounds associated with them, one hard, and one soft. They are called \"double\", because each letter represents a contrary or permutation, thus: Life and Death; Peace and War; Wisdom and Folly; Riches and Poverty; Grade and Indignity; Fertility and Solitude; Power and Servitude. <63> These Seven letters point out 7 localities; Zenith, Nadir, East, West, North, South, and the Place of Holiness in the midst sustaining all things. The Archetypal Creator designed, produced, combined and"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Zelator Ritual 151 formed with them the Planets of the Universe, the Days of the Week, and in Man, the Gate of the Soul. He has loved and blessed the num- ber 7 more than all things under His Throne. The powers of these 7 letters are also shown forth in the 7 Palaces of Assiah, and the Seven Stars of that Vision are the 7 Archangels who file them. He leads Neophyte to W. -of Altar, and returns to his place, and is seated. Hierophant comes to E. ofAltar, takes censer from Altar, and holding it with chain short, makes cross and three forward swings, replaces it, and says: Hiero Before the Veil of the Holy of Holies, stood the Altar of Incense, of which this Altar is an image. It was of the form of a double cube, thus representing material form as a reflection and duplication of that which is Spiritual. The sides of the Altar, together with the top and bottom, consist of ten squares, thus symbolising the Ten Sephiroth of which the basal one is Malkuth, the realisation of the rest upon the material plane, behind which the others are concealed. For were this double cube raised in the air immediately above your head, you would but see the single square forming the lowest side, the others from their position being concealed from you. Just so, behind the material Universe, lies the concealed form of the Majesty of God. <64> The Altar of Incense was overlaid with Gold to represent the highest degree of purity, but the Altar before you is black to represent the terrestrial Earth. Learn then, to separate the pure from the impure, and refine the Gold of the Spirit from the Black Dragon, the corrupt- ible body. Upon the Cubical Altar, were Fire, Water, and Incense, the Three Mother Letters of the Hebrew Alphabet; Aleph, Mem, and Shin. Mem is silent, Shin is sibilant, and Aleph is the tongue of a balance between these contraries in equilibrium, reconciling and mediating between them. In this is a great Mystery, very admirable and recondite. The Fire produced the Heavens, the Water, the Earth, and the Air is the reconciler between them. In the year, they bring forth the hot, the cold, and the temperate seasons, and in man, they are imaged in the head, the chest, and the trunk. I now confer upon you the Mystic Title of Periclinus de Faustis, which signifies that on this Earth you are in a wilderness, far from the Garden of the Happy. And I give you the s bol of ARETZ which is the Hebrew name for Earth, to which the 6?= Grade of Zelator is referred. The word Zelator is derived from the ancient Egyptian Zaruator, sigrufylng \"Searcher of Athor\", Goddess of Nature; but others assign to it the meaning of the zealous student whose first duty was to blow the Athanor of Fire which heated the Crucible of the Alchemist. <65> Hierophant resumes seat on Dais: Kern leads new Zelator to seat in North West.

He returns to his place by E, saluting, and by S. and W.* In the Zelator Grade, the symbolism of the Tenth Sephirah Malkuth is especially shown, as well as the Tenth Path of the Sepher Yetsirah. Among other Mystic Titles, Malkuth is called SHAAR, the Gate, which by metathesis becomes ASHUR, meaning the number Ten. Also in Chaldee it is called THRAA, The Gate, which has the same number as the Great Name ADONAI, written in full: Aleph, Daleth, Nun, Yod, which both equal 671 in total numeration. It is also called the \"Gate of Death, \"The Gate of Tears\", and the \"Gate of Justice\", the \"Gate of Prayer\", and \"The Gate of the Daughter of the Mighty Ones\". It is also called \"The Gate of the Garden of Eden\" and the Inferior Mother, and in Christian symbolism, it is connected with the Three Holy Women at the foot of the Cross. The Tenth Path of the Sepher Yetsirah which answereth to Malkuth is called \"The Re- splendent Intelligence\", because it exalts above every head and sit- teth upon the Throne of Binah.

The Distinguishing Badge of this Grade, which you are now entitled to wear is the Sash of the <87> Zelator, with the addition of a white cross above the triangle and the numbers @ and in a circle and square respectively, left and right of its summit - and beneath the triangle, the number 32 between two narrow parallel white lines. The meaning of the Tablet of Earth was explained to you in the preceding Grade. Hierophant returns to East and sits down. Hegemon guides Zelator to him. The Three Portals facing you are the Gates of Paths leading from this Grade. That on the right connects with the Grade of Philosophus, that on your left with the Grade of Practicus, while the central one leads to the Portal.

Hegemon leads the Theoricus between the Pillars, past Hierophant, making the Saluting Sign of a Neophyte in passing, circumambulates the Hall and halts at Hierophanf's Throne. Hierophant rises as they approach, red lamp in hand. AXIEROS, the FIRST KABIR, spake unto Kasmillos the Candidate, and said: \"I am the apex of the Pyramid of Flame. I am the Solar Fire pouring forth its beams upon the lower World - Life-giving, Light- producing. By what symbol dost thou seek to pass by?\" Heg By the symbol of the Pyramid of Flame. Hiero Hear Thou the voice of AXIEROS, the First KABIR: \"The Mind of the Father whirled forth in reechoing roar - comprehending by in- <98> vincible Will, ideas omniform, which flying forth from that One Fountain issued. For, from the Father alike were the Will and the End, by which yet they are connected with the Father, according to alternating Life through varying vehicles. But as they were divided asunder, being by Intellectual Fire dis- tributed into other Intellectuals. For the King of all previously placed before the polymorphous World, by which the Universe shines forth decked with ideas all various, of which the Foundation is One and Alone. From this: the others rush forth distributed and separated through the various bodies of the Universe and are borne in swarms through its vast Abysses, ever whirling forth in Illimitable Radiation. They are Intellectual Conceptions from the Paternal Fountain, par- taking abundantly of the Brilliance of Fire in the culmination of Unresting Time. But the Primary, Self-perfect Fountain of the Father pours forth these Primogenial Ideas. These being many, ascend flashingly into the Shining World and in them are contained the Three Supernals - because it is the Operator - because it is the Giver of the Life- bearing Fire - because it filleth the Life-producing Bosom of Hecate - and it instilleth into the Synoches, the enlivening strength of Fire, endued with Mighty Power. <99> The Creator of all, Self-operating, formed the World, and there was a certain mass of Fire, and all these self-operating He produced, so that the Cosmic Body might be completely conformed - that the"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"1 70 The Golden Dawn: Volume II Book lbo Cosmos might be manifest and not appear membranous. And He fixed a vast multitude of in-wandering stars, not by a strain laborious and hurtful, but to uphold them with stability, void of movement - forcing Fire forward into Fire.\" Hereunto is the speech of AXIEROS. Hegemon leads Theoricus to the seat of Hiereus who rises holding his red Lamp. They halt before him. Hiereus ,AXIOKERSOS, the Second KABIR, spake to Kasmillos the Can- didate and said: \"I am the left basal angle of the Triangle of Flame. I am the Fire Volcanic and Terrestrial, flashingly flaming through Abysses of Earth - Fire-rending - Fire penetrating - tearing asunder the curtain of Matter - Fire constrained - Fire tormented - raging and whirling in lurid storm. By what sign dost thou seek to pass by? Heg By the Symbol of the Pyramid of Flame. Hegemon returns to his place - signing Theoricus to remain. Hiereus Hear thou the voice of AXIOKERSOS, the Second KABIR: \"For not in Matter did the Fire which is in the Beyond First enclose His Power in acts, but in Mind; for the Former of the Fiery World is the Mind of Mind, Who fist sprang from Mind, clothing the one Fire with the <loo> other Fire, binding them together so that He might mingle the foun- tainous craters while presening unsullied the brilliance of His own Fire - and thence a Fiery Whirlwind drawing down the brilliance of the Flashing Flame - penetrating the Abysses of the Universe; thencefrom downwards all extend their wondrous rays, abundantly animating Light, Fire, Aether and the Universe. From Him leap forth all relentless thunders, and the whirlwind- wrapped, storm-enrolled Bosom of the All-splendid Strength of Hecate, Father-begotten, and He who encircleth the Brilliance of Fire and the Strong Spirit of the Poles, all fiery beyond.\" Hereunto is the speech of AXIOKERSOS. Hiereus leads Theoricus round to Hegemon who rises with Lamp. Heg AXIOKERSA, the Third KABIR, spake to Kasmillos the Candidate, and said: ''I am the Right Basal Angle of the Triangle of Flame. I am the Fire astral and fluid, winding and corruscating through the Fir- mament. I am the Life of beings - the vital heat of existence. By what Sign dost thou seek to pass by?\" Hiereus prompts Theoricus and returns to his place afterplacinga seat West of the Altar for Theoricus. Theo By the Symbol of the Pyramid of Flame.

Hegemon places Theoricus in the seat in the West facing Hierophant. Hiero Stoop not down unto the darkly splendid World wherein contin- ually lieth a faithless Depth, and Hades wrapped in clouds delight- ing in unintelligible images, precipitous, winding, a black ever-rolling Abyss, ever espousing a Body, unluminous, formless and void. Nature persuadeth us that there are pure daemons and that even the evil germs of Matter may alike become useful and good. But these are Mysteries which are evolved in the profound abyss of the Mind. Such a Fire existeth extending through the rushings of Air or even a Fire formless whence cometh the Image of a Voice, or even a flashing Light, abounding. whirling forth, crying aloud. Also there is the <102> vision of the Fire-flashing Courser of Light, or of a Child borne aloft on the shoulders of the Celestial Steed, fiery or clothed in gold, or naked and shooting with a bow, shafts of light, and standing on the shoulders of a horse. But if thy meditation prolongeth itself, thou shalt unite all these sym- bols in the form of a LION. Then when no longer are visible to thee the Vault of the Heavens, and the Mass of the Earth; when to Thee, the Stars have lost their light and the Lamp of the Moon is veiled; when the Earth abideth not and around thee is the Lightning Flame - then call not before thyself the Visible Image of the Soul of Nature, for thou must not behold it ere thy body is purged by the Sacred Rites - since, ever dragging down the Soul and leading it from the Sacred Things, from the confines of Matter, arise the terrible Dog-faced Demons, never showing true image unto mortal gaze. So therefore first the priest who governeth the works of Fire must sprinkle with the lustral water of the Loud, Resounding Sea. Labour thou around the Strophalos of Hecate. When thou shalt see a terrestrial Demon approaching, cry aloud and sacrifice the Stone MNIZOURIN. Change not the barbarous Names of Evocation, for they are Names Divine, having in the Sacred Rites a power ineffable. And when, <103> after all the phantoms have vanished, thou shalt see that Holy and Formless Fire - that Fire which darts and flashes through the Hid- den Depths of the Universe, Hear Thou the Voice of Fire. Hereunto is the speech of Kabir. Hegernon conducts the Theoricus to the foot of Hierophant's Throne, and taking the Triangular Pyramid, hands it to Hierophant. The Solid Triangular Pyramid is an appropriate hieroglyph of Fire. It is formed of four triangles, three visible and one concealed, which yet is the synthesis of the rest. The three visible triangles represent Fire, Solar, Volcanic, and Astral, while the fourth represents the"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"1 72 The Golden Dawn: Volume I1 Book Two latent Heat - AUD, active - AUB, passive - AUR, equilibrated - while ASCH is the name of Fire. (Puts Pyramid aside.) The Thirty First Path of the Sepher Yetsirah which answereth unto the Letter SHIN is called The Perpetual Intelligence, and it is so- called because it regulateth the proper motion of the Sun and the Moon in their proper order, each in an orbit convenient for it. It is therefore a reflection of the Sphere of Fire, and the Path conned- ing the Material Universe as depicted in Malkuth with the Pillar of Severity and the side of Geburah, through the Sephirah HOD. Hierophant rises. Hegemon steps back and when he has descended from the Dais, indicates to Theoricus to follow him. He leads Theoricus to the West of <104> the Altar, Hegemon follows and stands on the South Side - Hierophant being on the North. Before you upon the Altar, is the Twentieth Key of the TAROT, which symbolically represents these ideas. To the uninitiated eye it apparently represents The Last Judgment with an angel blowing a trumpet and the Dead rising from their tombs - but its meaning is far more occult and recondite than this, for it is a glyph of the powers of Fire. The Angel encircled by the rainbow, whence leap corruscations of Fire, and crowned with the Sun, represents MICHAEL, the Great Archangel, the Ruler of Solar Fire. The Serpents which leap in the rainbow are symbols of the Fiery Seraphim. The Trumpet represents the influence of the Spirit de- scending from BINAH, while the Banner with the Cross refers to the Four Rivers of Paradise and the Letters of the Holy Name. He is also AXIEROS, the first of the Samothracian Kabiri, as well as Zeus and Osiris. The left hand figure below, rising from the Earth is SAMAEL, the Ruler of Volcanic Fire. He is also AXIOKERSOS, the Second Kabir, Pluto and Typhon. The right hand figure below is ANAEL, the Ruler of Astral Light. She is also AXIOKERSA, the Third Kabir, Ceres and Persephone, Isis and Nephthys. She is, therefore, represented in duplicate form, and rising from the waters. Around both these figures dart flashes of Lightning. <105> These three principle figures form the Fire Triangle, and further rep resent Fire operating in the other Three Elements of Earth, Air, and Water. The central lower figure with his back turned, and his arms in the Sign of the Two equals Nine, is AREL, the Ruler of latent heat. He is rising from the Earth as if to receive the properties of the other three. He is also KASMILLOS, the Candidate in the Samothracian Mys- teries, and the Horus of Egypt. He rises from the rock-hewn cubical Tomb and he also alludes to the Candidate who traverses the Path of Fire.

Hiero (knocks) Frater Poraios de Rejectis, before you in the East lie the Por- tals of the 30th, 25th, and 28th Paths leading from the Two equals Nine Grade of Theoricus to those Grades which are beyond. Of these, the only one now open to you, is the Thirtieth which leads to the Three equals Eight Grade of Practicus. Take in your right hand the Solar Greek Cross, and follow your Guide through the Pathway of the Sun. Heg Before the Intellectual Whirlings of Intellectual Fire, all things are subservient through the Will of the Father of All. Hegemon leads Theoricus between Pillars and halts before Hierophant, who rises, red Lamp in hand. Hiero AXIEROS, the First Kabir, spake unto Kasmillos the Candidate and said: \"I am the Sun in greatest elevation, bringing upon Earth the ripening heat -frudifymg all things - urging forward the growth of vegetable nature, Life-giving, Light-producing - crowning sum- mer with golden harvest, and filling the lap of plenteous Autumn with the Purple vintage of the Vine.\" Thus far the voice of AXIEROS! Hegemon leads Theoricus to the Seat of Hiereus who rises with red Lamp. <108> Hiereus AXIOKERSOS, the Second Kabir, spake unto Kasmillos the Candidate, and said: 'l am the Sun in greatest depression be- neath the Equator when cold is greatest and heat is least -with- drawing his light in darkening winter, the Dweller in mist and storm.\" Thus far the voice of AXIOKERSOS. Hegemon leads Theoricus to his own seat and taking red Lamp says: Heg AMOKERSA, the Third Kabir spake to Kasmillos the Candidate and said: '1 am the Sun in Equinox, initiating Summer or heralding Win- ter - mild and genial in operation, giving forth or withdrawing the vital heat of life.\" Thus far the voice of AXIOKERSA! Hiereus places a seat West of the Altar. Hegemon indicates this to Theoricus. A11 are seated, facing Hierophant. Hiero The Father of All congregated the Seven Firmaments of the Cosmos, circumscribing the Heaven with convex form. He constituted, a Sep- tenary of Wandering Existences, suspending their disorder in well- disposed zones. He made them six in number and for the seventh, he cast into the midst thereof the Fire of the Sun - into that Centre from which all lines are equal - that the Swift Sun may come around that Centre eagerly urging itself towards that Centre of Resounding Light. As rays of light, His locks flow forth, stretching to the confines of Space, and of the Solar Circles, and of the Lunar flashings and of the Aerial Recesses, the Melody of the Aether and of <109> the Sun and of the Passages of the Moon and of the Air.

Unwearied doth Nature rule over the Worlds and Works, so that the Period of all things may be accomplished. And above the shoulders of the Great Goddess, is Nature in her vastness exalted. Thus far the voice of the Kabiri. Hegemon conducts Theoricus to Hierophant, to whom he hands the Solar Greek Cross. The Solar Greek Cross is formed of thirteen squares which fitly refer to the Sun's motion through the Zodiac, these Signs being further arranged in the arms of the Cross according to the Four Elements with the Sun in the centre and representing that luminary as the cen- tre of the whole. The Thirtieth Path of the Sepher Yetzirah which <110> answereth to the Letter Resh is called the Collecting Intelligence, and it is so called because from it the Astrologers deduce the judg- ment of the Stars, and of the Celestial Signs, and the perfections of their science according to the rules of their resolutions. It is therefore the Reflection of the Sphere of the Sun and the Path con- necting YESOD with HOD - Foundation with Splendour. Hierophant rises. Hegemon and Theoricus step back and follow him to the Altar where he places Theoricus in the West, Hierophant North, Hegemon South. Before you upon the Altar is the Nineteenth Key of TAROT which symbolically resumes these ideas. The Sun has twelve principal rays which represent the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac. They are alternately waved and salient as symbolising the alternation of the masculine and feminine natures. These again are subdivided into the 36 Decanates or sets of ten degrees in the Zodiac, and these again into 72, typlfylng the 72 quinances or sets of five, and the 72-fold Name Schemhamphoresch. Thus the Sun embraces the whole creation in its rays. The seven Hebrew Yods on each side, falling through the air, refer to the Solar influence descending. The Wall is the Circle of the Zodiac, and the stones are its various degrees and divisions. The two children standing respectively on Water and Earth repre- < 11 1 > sent the generating influence of both, brought into action by the rays of the Sun.

Hiereus The Cup of the Stolistes partakes in part of the Symbolism of the Laver of Moses and the Sea of Solomon. On the Tree of Life, it embraces nine of the Sephiroth, exclusive of Kether. Yesod and Malkuth form the triangle below, the former the apex, the latter the base. Like Caduceus, it further represents the Three Elements of Water, Air, and Fire. The Crescent is the Water which is above the Firmament, the Circle is the Firmament, and the Triangle the con- suming Fire below, which is opposed to the Celestial Fire sym- bolised by the upper part of the Caduceus. Hiereus puts admission badge aside. Hegemon directs Theoricus to Hierophant whose chair should now be moved back towards the West, and placed in readiness for the Candidate at the Closing. Hiereus and Hegemon stand either side of the Altar, facing it. Before you is represented the symbolism of the Garden of Eden. At the summit is the Supernal Eden, containing the Three Supernal Sephiroth, summed up and contained in Aima Elohim, the Mother <114> Supernal, the Woman of the twelfth chapter of the Apocalypse, crowned with the Sun and the Moon under her feet, and upon her head the Crown of Twelve Stars, Kether. And whereas the Name, YOD HE VAU HE, is joined to the name Elohim, when it is said Tet- ragrammaton Elohim planted a Garden Eastward in Eden, so this represents the power of the Father joined thereto in the Glory from the Face of the Ancient of Days. And in the Garden was the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and of Evil, which latter is from Malkuth, which is the lowest Sephirah between the rest of the Sephiroth and the Kingdom of Shells, which latter is represented by the Great Red Dragon coiled beneath, having Seven Heads (the Seven Infernal Palaces) and Ten Horns - (The Ten Averse Sephiroth of Evil, con- tained in the Seven Palaces). And a River Naher went forth out of Eden, namely from the Super- nal Triad, to water the Garden (the rest of the Sephiroth), and from thence it was divided into Four Heads in Daath, whence it is said \"In Daath the Depths are broken u and the clouds drop down dew.\" The first Head is PISON, which if' owsinto Geburah (whence there is Gold.) It is the River of Fire. The Second Head is GIHON, the River of Waters, flowing into Chesed. The Third is HIDDEKEL, the River of Air, flowing into Tiphareth, and the Fourth which receiveth the virtues of the other three, is PHRATH, Euphrates, which floweth down <115> upon the Earth. This River going forth out of Eden is the River of the Apocalypse, the Waters of Life, clear as crystal proceeding out of the Throne of God and the Lamb, on either side of which was the Tree of Life, bearing Twelve manner of Fruits.

As it was said to you in the Thirtieth Path, \"And above the shoulders of that Great Goddess is Nature in her vastness exalted.\" The Three equals Eight Grade of Practicus is referred to the Sephirah Hod and the Thirtieth and Thirty First Paths - those of Resh and Shin are bound thereto. The Sign of this Grade is given thus. With the hands together, raise the arms till the elbows are level with the shoulders. With the thumbs and fore-fingers make a triangle on your breast thus (show- ing it) - a triangle apex downwards. This represents the Element of Water, to which this Grade is attributed. The Grip or Token is the general Grip of the First Order. The Grand Word is a Name of ten letters, ELOHIM TZABAOTH, which means Lord of Hosts. The Mystic Number is 36, and from it is formed the Pass-word of this Grade which is ELOAH, one of the Divine Names. <116> It should be lettered separately when given thus - Aleph, Lamed He. Unto this Grade and unto the Sephirah Hod, the Eighth Path of the Sepher Yetsirah is referred. It is called the absolute or perfect Path, because itis the means of the Primordial, which hath no root to which it may be established, except in the penetralia of that Gedulah (Magxuficence) which emanate from the subsisting properties thereof. The distinguishing badge of this Grade which you are now entitled to wear, is the sash of the Theoricus with the addition of a purple cross above the white cross and the numbers three and eight within a circle and a square respectively, left and right of its summit - and below the number 32, the numbers 30 and 31 in purple between two narrow purple Lines. This grade is especially referred to the Element of Water and therefore the Great Watch Tower of Tablet of the West forms one of its principal emblems. Hierophant and Theoricus turn towards it. It is known as the Second or Great Western Quadrangle or Tablet of Water, and it is one of the Four Great Tablets delivered unto Enoch by the Great Angel Ave. From it are drawn the Three Holy Secret Names of God - EMPEH ARSEL GAIOL - which are borne upon the Banners of the West, and numberless Divine and Angelic Names which appertain unto the element of Water. The meanings of the <117> Tablets of Earth and Air were explained to you in the preceding Grades. Turning to the Altar, Hierophant indicates the Cross and Triangle.

And the Countenances of Darkness half-formed arose - they abode not - they hasted away - and in the Darkness of Vacancy, the Spirit moved and the Lightbearers existed for a space. I have said Darkness of Darkness - are not the Countenances of Darkness fallen with Kings? Do the Sons of the Night of Time last for ever? And have they not yet passed away? Before all things are the Watersand the Darkness and the Gates of the Land of Night. And the CHAOS cried aloud for the Unity of Form - and the Face of the ETERNAL arose.

And thus was formulated the Eternal Hexad - the number of the Dawning Creation. Hegemon conducts the Practicus to the foot of Hiero's throne - handing to Hiero the Calva y Cross of twelve squares. The Calvary Cross of Twelve Squares fitly represents the ZODIAC which embraces the Waters of Nu as the ancient Egyptians called the Heavens, the Waters which be above the Firmament. It also alludes to the Eternal River of Eden, divided into four Heads which find their correlations in the four triplicities of the Zodiac. Places Cross aside. The 29th PATH of the Sepher Yetsirah which answereth unto the let- ter QOPH is called the Corporeal Intelligence - and it is so called because it forms the very body which is so formed beneath the whole Order of the Worlds and the increment of them. It is therefore the reflection of the Watery Sign of Pisces and the Path connecting the material universe as depicted in Malkuth with the Pillar of Mercy and the side of Chesed, through the Sephirah NETZACH, and through it do the Waters of Chesed flow down. Hiero, Hegemon and Practicus come to the West of the Altar. Before you upon the Altar is the 18th Key of TAROT which sym- bolically resumes these Ideas. It represents the MOON with four Hebrew YODS like drops of dew falling, two dogs, two Towers, a <130> winding Path leading to the Horizon, and, in the fore-ground, Water with a Crayfish crawling through it to the land. The Moon is in its increase on the side of Mercy, Gedulah, and from it proceed sixteen principal and sixteen secondary rays, which make 32, the number of the Paths of Yetsirah. She is the Moon at the feet of the Woman of Revelations, ruling equally over the cold and moist natures and the passive elements of Earth and Water. It is to be noted that the symbol of the Sign is formed of two lunar crescents bound together. It thus shows the lunar nature of the Sign. The Dogs are the Jackals of the Egyptian ANUBIS, guarding the Gates of the East and of the West, shown by the two Towers between which lies the Path of all the heavenly bodies ever rising in the East and setting in the west. The Cray-fish is the Sign Cancer and was anciently the Scarabeus or Khephera, the emblem of the Sun below the Horizon as he ever is when the Moon is increasing above. Also, when the Sun is in the Sign Pisces the Moon will be well in her increase in Cancer as shown by the Cray-fish emblem. Hiero returns to place. Hegemon remains with Practicus West of Altar.

For the Mind of the Eternal Father said, Into Three, governing all things by Mind. And there appeared in it the Triad, Virtue, Wisdom and Multicient Truth. Thus floweth forth the form of the Triad, being Pre-existent, not the first Essence, but that whereby all things are measured. Heg For thou must know that all things bow before the Three Supernals.

Hiero, Hegemon, and Practicus come West of the Altar. Before you upon the Altar is the 17th Key of TAROT which sym- bolically resumes these ideas. The large STAR in the centre of the Heavens has seven principal and <135> fourteen secondary rays and this represents the Heptad multiplied by the Triad. This yields 21 - the Number of the Divine Name EHEIEH which, as you already know, is attached to KETHER. In the Egyptian sense, it is SIRIUS the Dog-Star, the Star of Isis- Sothis. Around it are the Stars of the Seven Planets each with its seven-fold counterchanged operation. The nude female figure with the Star of the Heptagrarn on her brow is the synthesis of Isis, of Nephthys, and of Athor. She also rep resents the planet VENUS through whose sphere the influence of Chesed descends. She is Aima, Binah, Tebunah, the Great Supernal Mother - Aima Elohim, pouring upon the Earth the Waters of Crea- tion which unite and form a River at her feet, the River going forth from the Supernal Eden which floweth and faileth not. Note well, that in this Key she is completely unveiled while in the 21st Key she is only partially so. The two Urns contain the influences from Chokmah and Binah. On the right springs the Tree of Life, and on the left the Tree of Knowledge of Good and of Evil whereon the Bird of Hermes alights, and therefore does this Key represent the restored World, after the formless and the Void and the Darkness, the New ADAM, the Coun- tenance of the Man which falls in the Sign AQUARIUS. And therefore doth the astronomical ripple of this sign represent, as it <136> were, Waves of Water - the ripples of that River going forth out of Eden - but, therefore also, is it justly attributed to Air and not unto Water because it is the Firmament dividing and containing the Water.

Hiero Ere the Eternal instituted the Formation, Beginning and End existed not. Therefore, before Him, He expanded a certain Veil, and therein He instituted the Primal Kings. And these are the Kings who reigned in Edom before there reigned a King over Israel. But they subsisted not. When the Earth was formless and void - behold this is the reign of EDOM. And when the Creation was established, lo, this is the reign of Israel. And the Wars of titanic <139> forces in the Chaos of Creation, Lo, these are the Wars between them. From a Light-bearer of unsupportable brightness, proceeded a radi- ating flame, hurling forth, like a vast and mighty Hammer, those sparks which were the Primal worlds. And these Sparks flamed and scintillated awhile, but being unbalanced, they were extinguished. Since lo, the Kings assembled, they passed away together, they themselves beheld, so they were astonished. They feared. They hasted away. And these be the Kings of Edom who reigned before there reigned a King over Israel. Hegemon takes Practicus round the Tempk, and halts before Hiereus who rises with Red Lamp in hand. Hiereus The Dukes of Edom were amazed, trembling they took hold of the Mighty Moab, Lord, when Thou wentest out of SEIR, when Thou marchedst out of the Field of Edom, the Earth trembled and the Heavens dropped - the Clouds also dropped Water. Curse ye MEROZ, said the Angel of the Lord - curse ye bitterly, the inhabitants thereof, because they came not to the help of the Lord - to the help of the Lord against the Mighty.

Was the Lord displeased against the Rivers? Was Thy Wrath against the Sea that Thou didst ride upon Thy horses and Chariots of Salva- tion? Thou didst cleave asunder the Earth with the Rivers. The Mountains saw Thee and they trembled. The deluge of waters rolled by. The Deep uttered His voice and lifted up His hands on high. The SUN and the MOON stood still in their Habitations. At the Light of Thine arrows they went - at the shining of Thy Glittering Spear. Thou didst march through the Land in indignation. Thou didst thrash the Heathen in Thine Anger. Thou didst march through the Sea with Thy Horses - through the depth of the Mighty Waters. Hegemon leads practicus to Hiero and gives Hiero the Calvary Cross. The Calvary Cross of Ten Squares refers to the Ten Sephiroth in balanced disposition, before which the Formless and the Void rolled <142> back. It is also the opened out form of the Double Cube and of the Altar of Incense. Places Cross aside. The 27th PATH of the Sepher Yetzirah which answereth unto PEH is called the Exciting Intelligence, and it is so called because by it is created the Intellect of all created Beings under the Highest Heaven, and the Excitement or Motion of them. It is therefore the Reflection of the Sphere of Mars, and the Recipro- cal Path connecting Netzach with Hod, Victory with Splendour. It is the lowermost of the three Reciprocal Paths. Hiero, Heg, and Practicus come to the W. of Altar. Hiero Before you upon the Altar is the 16th Key of TAROT, which sym- bolically resumes these ideas. It represents a Tower struck by a Lightning Flash proceeding from a rayed circle and terminating in a triangle. It is the Tower of Babel struck by the Fire from Heaven. It is to be noted that the triangle at the end of the flash, issuing from the circle, forms exactly the as-"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"192 The Golden Dawn: Volume II Book Two tronomical symbol of Mars. It is the Power of the Triad rushing down and destroying the Col- umns of Darkness. Three holes are rent in the walls, symbolising the establishment of the Triad therein and the Crown at the summit of the Tower is falling, as the Crowns of the Kings of Edom fell, who are also symbolised by the men falling headlong. On the right hand side <143> of the Tower is LIGHT and the representation of the Tree of LIFE by ten circles this disposed. On the left hand side is DARKNESS and eleven circles symbolising the QLIPPOTH. Hierophant returns to his throne. Hegemon and Practicus remain West of Altar.

The symbol of VENUS on the Tree of Life is shown in the East. Hierophant is seated in the East; Hiereus and Hegemon North and South of the Altar, respecfively, beside the Pillars. Hegemon requires the Sash of the Grade, and Badge of LAMEN of Hegemon. Hiero Honoured Hegemon, you have my commands to present the Prac- ticus with the necessary Admission Badge and to admit him. Hegemon instructs Practicus to knock, gives him Lamen, and admits him. In the North West are the Portals of the 29th and 28th PATHS b which you have symbolically entered this Grade from the 0 = d and the @ = Grades respectively, while in the North is the Portal of the 27th PATH by which you have just passed from the Grade of Practicus. Hegernon leads Practicus to Hiereus. Hiereus By what symbol dost thou enter herein? Heg By the peculiar Emblem of the Hegemon which is the Calvary Cross of Six Squares. Hiereus This Cross embraces, as you see, Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod and Yesod, and rests upon Malkuth. Also, the Calvary Cross of Six Squares forms the Cube, and is thus referred to the Six Sephiroth of Microprosopus which are Chesed, Geburah, Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod and Yesod. Hegemon faces Practicus to the Diagram at the Altar. Hiero comes West of Altar and points to Diagram. Hegemon resumes seat. <146> Hiero This is the symbolic re resentation of THE FALL. For, the Great Goddess who, in the b= Grade was supporting the Columns of the Sephiroth, in the sign of the @ = Grade, being tempted by the Tree of Knowledge (whose branches indeed tend upward into the Seven Lower Sephiroth, but also tend downward anto the Kingdom of Shells) reached down unto the Qlippoth, and immediately the Columns were unsupported and the Sephir- otic system was shattered, and with it fell ADAM, the MICRO- PROSOPUS. Then arose the Great DRAGON with Seven Heads and Ten Horns, and the Garden was made desolate, and MALKUTH was cut off from the Sephiroth by his intersecting folds, and linked unto the Kingdom of Shells. And the Seven Lower Sephiroth were cut off from the Three Supernals in DAATH, at the feet of AIMA ELOHIM. And on the Heads of the Dragon are the Names and Crowns of the Edomite Kings. And because in DAATI-I was the greatest rise of the Great Serpent of Evil, therefore is there, as it were, another Seph- irah, making for the Infernal or Averse Sephiroth, Eleven instead of Ten. And hence were the Rivers of Eden desecrated, and from the Mouth"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"194 The Golden Dawn: Volume I1 Book 7kuo of the DRAGON rushed the Infernal Waters in DAATH. And this is LEVIATHAN, The Crooked Serpent. But between the Devastated Garden and the Supernal Eden, YOD <147> HE VAU HE ELOHIM placed the Letters of THE NAME and THE FLASHING SWORD that the uppermost part of the Tree of Life might not be involved in the Fall of Adam. And thence it was necessary that the SECOND ADAM should come to restore all things and that,as the First Adam had been extended on the Cross of the Celestial Rivers, so the SON should be crucified on the Cross of the Infernal Rivers of DAATH. Yet, to do this, he must descend unto the lowest first, even unto Malkuth and be born of her. The @ = Grade of PHILOSOPHUS is referred unto the Seph- irah NETZACH and the 27th, 28th, and 29th PATHS are bound thereto. The Sign of this Grade is given by raising the hands to the fore-head, and with the thumbs and index fingers forming a triangle, apex up thus. . . . This represents the element of FIRE to which this Grade is allotted, and also the Spirit which moved upon the Waters of Creation. The Grip or token is the general Grip of the First Order. The GRAND WORD is a Name of nine letters - YOD HE VAU HE TZABAOTH, which means Lord of Armies. The Mystic Number is 28 and from it is formed the Pass Word KAPH CHETH, which should be lettered separately when given. It means Power. Unto this Grade, and unto the Sephirah NETZACH, the Seventh Path of the Sepher Yetzirah is referred. It is called the Recondite <148> Intelligence, and it is so called because it is the Refulgent Splendour of all the Intellectual Virtues which are perceived by the Eye of the Mind and by the Contemplation of Faith. The distinguishing Badge of this Grade which you will now be entitled to wear, is the sash of a Practicus, with the addition of a bright green cross above the violet cross and the numbers @ in a cir- cle and in a square on either side of its summit, and below the number 31, the numbers 27/28, and 29 in bright green, between narrow bars of the same colour. This Grade is especially referred to FIRE and therefore, the Great Watch-Tower or Terrestrial Tablet of the South forms one of its prin- cipal Emblems. It is known as the Fourth or Great Southern Quad- rangle and is one of the Four Great Tablets delivered unto ENOCH by the Great Angel Ave. From it are drawn the Three Holy Secret Names of God OIP TEAA PEDOCE, which are borne upon the Ban- ners of the South, and numberless Divine and Angelic Names which appertain unto the Element of Fire. The meanings of the other Tablets have already been explained to you. The Triangle surmounting the Cross upon the Altar represents the Fire of the Spirit surmounting the Cross of Life and of the Waters of Edom. You will note that it thus forms the Alchemical Emblem of Sulphur. The Red Lamps at the angles of the Triangle are the Three- fold form of Fire."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Philosophus Ritual 195 <149> Hiero resumes his seat.

This Grade is related to the Planet VENUS, Ruler in NETZACH. Its Symbol, when inscribed on the Tree of Life is shown in the East. It embraces the whole of the Sephiroth, and is therefore a fitting emblem of the Isis of Nature; hence, also, its circle is represented larger than that of Mercury.

It is here given in the colours of the King's scale, and is also assigned to the Four Sephiroth ruling the Grades of the Outer - Earth to Malkuth, Air to Yesod, Water to Hod and Fire to Netzach. It is again, the Cross which heads the Praemonstrator's Wand, who represents the Sephira Chesed, the Fourth Sephirah. Four is also the number of Jupiter, whose Path unites Chesed to Netzach. The Cross is therefore a fit Emblem for a Philosophus of the Grade of @= 0. In this diagram are represented the Circle, the Point, the Line, the Cross, the Square and the Cube. For the Circle is the Abyss, the Nothingness, the AIN. The Point is Kether. Now, the Point has no dimension, but in moving, it traces the Line.

So therefore, are the square and the Cross but one Symbol, deriving from the Circle and the Point. Below, is shown the Occult Symbol of Malkuth, the Tenth Sephirah. It is in Four parts, corresponding to the Maltese Cross. They are Fire of Earth, Water of Earth, Air of Earth, Earth of Earth, as is indicated by the Symbol. They correspond to the Four Grades of the First Order, <169> which in one sense, quitteth not Malkuth, being the Grades of the Four Lowest Sephiroth of Malkuth in Assiah.* Upon them, is sur- charged a white Hexagram in a Circle. The 6 and the 4 make 10, the number of Malkuth on the Tree. The Hexagram is also the Sign of the Macrocosm - of Tiphareth, and of the Six Upper Sephiroth, where- fore here it is white - Spirit ruling over matter. Six is a perfect num- ber, for its whole equals the sum of its parts. Six are the middle points of the planes bounding a cube, which derives from the square, and from the Cross, if the centre point moves thus (indicates third direction). In these numbers and figures are hid many revelations. Remember that the whole number of Malkuth is 496 - which is again a perfect number. Malkuth must then be equated and perfect- ed by the 6 ruling the 4: and the link between 6 and 4 is the number of the Pentagram. 2ndAd.

In a field he is reaping off with the Scythe of Death the fresh vegetation which springs from corrupting bodies buried therein - fragments of which - such as <179> hands, heads and feet appear above the soil. Bones also are strewn upon the surface. One of the heads wears a kingly crown; another is apparently that of a person of little note, showing that death is the equaliser of all conditions. The five extremities, the head, hands and feet, allude to the powers of the number five, the Letter He, the Pen- tagram - the concealed Spirit of Life and the Four Elements - the originator of all living form. The Sign of Scorpio especially alludes to stagnant and foetid water - that property of the moist nature which initiates putrefaction and decay. The eternal change from life into death through death into life, is symbolised by the grass which springs from and is nourished by putrifying and corrupting car- casses; the herbiage, in its turn affords food to animals and man, which again when dead, nourisheth vegetable life and bring to growth and perfection the living herbiage. This is further shown by the figure itself putrifylng and decaying as it reaps the grass of the field. \"As for man, his days are as grass, as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.\" The top of the scythe forms the Tau Cross of Life, show- ing that what destroys also renews. The whole is a representation of the eternal transmutation of the life of nature, which reforms all things into fresh images and similitudes. This symbol represents the corrosive and destructive action of the infernalFire as opposedto the Celestial - the Dragon of the Waters, the Typhon of the Egyptians, the Slayer of Osiris - which later yet rises again in Horus. The Scorpio, Serpent of Evil, delineated before <180> the figure of Death in the more ancient form of the Key, refers to the mixed and transforming, therefore deceptive, nature of this em- blem. Behind him, is the Symbol of the Nameless One, representing the Seed and its germ, not yet differentiated into Life, therefore incapable of definition. The Scorpion is the emblem of ruthless de- struction; the Snake is the mixed and deceptive nature, serving alike for good and evil; the Eagle is the higher and Divine Nature, yet to be found herein, the Alchemical Eagle of distillation, the Renewer of life.

In his left hand, which points downwards, he holds a lighted torch, and in his right, which is elevated, a horn of water. The left hand points downwards to show that it is the infernal and burning, not the celestial and life-giving flame which is kindled in his torch-just as when the Sun is in Cap- ricornus, to which cold and earthy Sign this Key corresponds, Solar light is at its weakest and the natures of cold and moisture triumph over heat and dryness.

Thus he represents the gross and materialised Ele- mental Forces of Nature; and the whole would be an evil symbol, were it not for the Pentagram of Light above his head which regu- lates and guides his movements. He is the eternal renewer of all the changing forms of Creation in conformity with the Law of the All- Powerful One (Blessed be He) which controlling law is typified by the controlling Pentagram of Light surmounting the whole.

This drawing represents the more ancient form of the 14th Key of Tarot, for which the later and more usual form of Temperance was soon substituted, as better representing the natural symbolism of the Path Sagittarius. The earlier figure was considered not so much a representation of this Path alone, as the synthesis of that and the others conjoined. The later figure, therefore, is better adapted to the more restricted meaning. The more ancient form shows a female figure crowned with the crown of five rays, symbolising the Five Principles of Nature, the concealed Spirit and the Four Elements of Earth, Air, Water and Fire. About her head is a halo of light. On her <192> breast is the Sun of Tiphareth. The Five-rayed Crown further al- ludes to the Five Sephiroth Kether, Chokrnah, Binah, Chesed and Geburah. Chained to her waist are a Lion and an Eagle, between which is a large cauldron whence arise steam and smoke. The Lion represents the Fire in Netzach -the Blood of the Lion, and the Eagle represents the Water in Hod, the Gluten of the Eagle - whose reconcilement is made by the Air in Yesod, uniting with the vola- tilised Water arising from the cauldron through the influence of the Fire beneath it. The chains which link the Lion and the Eagle to her waist, are symbolic of the Paths of Scorpio and Capricornus as"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"218 The Golden Dawn: Volume 11 Book Three shown by the Scorpion and the Goat in the background. In her right hand, she bears the Torch of Solar Fire elevating and volatilising the Water in Hod by the fiery influence of Geburah, while with her left hand, she pours from a vase the Waters of Chesed to temperate and calm the Fires of Netzach. This later form is the usual figure of Tem- perance, syrnbolising in a more restricted form than the preceding, the peculiar properties of this Path. It represents an Angel with the Solar emblem of Tiphareth on her brow, and wings of the aerial and volatilising nature, pouring together the fluidic Fire and the fiery Water - thus combining, harmonising and temperating those op posing elements. One foot rests on dry and volcanic land, in the background of which is a volcano whence issues an irruption. The other foot is in the water by whose border springs fresh vegetation, contrasting strongly with the arid and dry nature of the distant land. On her breast is a square, <193> the emblem of rectitude. The whole figure is a representation of that straight and narrow way of which it is said \"few there be that find it\" which alone leads to the higher and glorified life. For to pursue that steady and tranquil mean between two opposing forces, is indeed difficult, and many are the temptations to turn aside either to the right or to the left - wherein, remember, are but to be found the menacing symbols of Death and the Devil. The 25th Path of the Sepher Yetzirah to which the Tarot Key of Tem- perance is referred, is called the Intelligence of Probation, and it is so called because it is the primary temptation by which the Creator tries all righteous persons. That is, that in it, there is ever present the temptation to turn aside to the one hand or the other. 2nd and 3rd Ads. give Cup and red lamp to Phil. who holds them in form of Tau Cross. Ch. Ad. Let this remind you once more, that only in and by the reconciliation of opposing forces is the Path-way made to true occult knowledge and practical power. Good alone is mighty and Truth alone shall pre- vail. Evil is but weakness and the power of evil magic exists but in the contest of unbalanced forces, which in the end, will destroy and ruin him who hath subjugated himself thereto. As it is said \"Stoop not down, for a precipice lieth beneath the Earth - a descent of seven steps; and therein, is established the throne of an evil and fatal force. Stoop not down unto that dark and lurid world. Defile not thy brilliant flame with the earthy dross of matter.

Both refer in natural succession of numbers to the six follow- ing the five. Thus all progress is by steps, gradual and secure. The inner revelation may come suddenly to some, even in the twinkling of an eye or it may be after long waiting - a slow and gradual pro- cess from the beginning, yet ever the liquid must be prepared to the point of saturation. The Hierophant's Lamen is a synthesis of Tiphareth, to which the Calvary Cross of six squares, forming the cube opened out, is fitly referred. The two colours, red and green, the most active and the most passive, whose conjunction points out the practical application of the knowledge of equilibrium, are symbolic of the reconciliation of the celestial essences of Fire and Water, for the reconciling yellow < 195> unites with blue in green, which is the complementary colour to red, and with red in orange which is the complementary colour to blue. The small inner circle placed upon the Cross alludes to the Rose that is conjoined therewith in the symbolism of the Rose and Cross of our Order. The field of the Banner of the East is White, the colour of light and purity. As in the previous case, the Calvary Cross of six squares is the number six of Tiphareth, the yellow Cross of Solar Gold, and the cubical stone bearing in its centre the sacred Tau of Life, and having bound together upon it the form of the Macrocosmic Hexagram, the red triangle of Fire and the blue triangle of Water - the Ruach Elohim and the Waters of Creation. The six angles of the Hexagram described upon the Tree of Life will give the Planets referred to it as follows: Daath, Saturn; Chesed, Jupiter; Geburah, Mars; Netzach, Venus; Hod, Mercury; Yesod, Luna - while in the centre is the Sun of Tiphareth. Upon my breast is a symbol, which, 0 Lord of the Paths of the Portal of the Adepti, is as yet unknown to you. It is no Symbol of the Order of the Stella Matutina, nor of the First or Outer Order, nor even of your Degree. It is the symbol of the Red Rose and the Cross of Gold, uniting the powers of the 4 and 5 and of the 6 within itself, but to learn its full meaning, it is needful that you be admitted to the fellowship of that other Order to which the Stella Matutina is one of the Veils. Of this matter, you have no right to speak to any below your degree. Admission further can be earned no more by excellence in intellec- <196> tual learning alone, though that also is required of you. In token that all true knowledge cometh of grace, not of right, such admission is granted, not on demand, but at the discretion of the Greatly Hon- oured Chiefs of the Second Order.

Second Despise not sadness, and hate not suffering, for they are the Initi- ators of the heart; and the black robe of mourning which thou wearest is at once the symbol of sorrow and of strength. Boast not thyself above thy brother if he hath fallen, for how knowest thou that thou couldst have withstood the same temptation. Slander not, and revile not. If thou canst not praise, do not condemn. When thou seest another in trouble in humiliation, even though he be thy enemy, remember the time of thy own humiliation when thou didst kneel before the door of the Tomb, clothed in the Robe of Mourning, with the Chain of Affliction about thy neck, and thy hands bound behind thy back, and rejoice not at his fall. And in thine intercourse with the members of our Order, let thy hand given unto another be a sincere and genuine pledge of frater- nity.

Frater Hodos Chamelionis, what is the symbolic age of the Aspirant? Hodos His days are an hundred and twenty years. Second It is written: \"My Spirit shall not always strive with man, seeing that he also is flesh, yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.\" <211> Associate Adeptus Minor, unto what do those 120 years of the Aspirant's symbolic age correspond? Third To the Five Grades of the First Order through which it is necessary for the Aspirant to have passed before he can enter the Tomb of the Sacred Mountain. For the three months interval between the Grades of Practicus and Philosophus are the Regimen of the Elements; and the seven months between the Philosophus and the Portal sym- bolise the Regimen of the Planets; while the Elements and the Planets both work in the Zodiac; so that three plus seven multiplied by twelve yieldeth the number 120. Second 0 Aspirant, ere thou canst enter the Tomb of the Adepti of the Rose of Ruby and the Cross of Gold, it is necessary to take a solemn Obligation of Secrecy, Fidelity, Fraternity, and Justice. But as in all the previous obligations, there is nothing contained therein con- trary to thy civil, moral, or religious duties. Art thou willing to take such a pledge? Aspirant I am. Second Let the Aspirant be bound to the Cross of Suffering. The Aspirant is led to the Cross, and his hands put through the running nooses and cords are bound about his waist and feet. Two Adepti stand on either side to supporf him, and Third Adept takes his place ready to hand Cup and Dagger to Second Adept who stands in front of and facing Aspirant. <212> Second Adept holds out Rose Crucifa to Aspirant, saying: Second The Symbol of Suffering is the symbol of strength. Wherefore"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Adeptus Minor Ritual bound as thou art, strive to raise this holy symbol in thy hands, for he that will not strive shall not attain.

Second Adept raises his hands on high to invoke the force; then lowers them and takes crucifix which is replaced by Third Adept on Altar. Aspirant is now bound more firmly to the cross. Second Repeat after me your sacramental Name, and say: OBLIGATION Kether I, (Christian Rosenkreutz), a member of the Body of Christ, do this day spiritually bind myself, even as I am now bound physically upon the Cross of Suffering. Chokmah That I will to the utmost lead a pure and unselfish life, and will prove myself a faithful and devoted servant of this Order. Binah That I will keep secret all things connected with the Order, and its Secret Knowledge, from the whole world, equally from him who is a member of the First Order of the Stella Matutina, as from an uniniti- <213> ated person, and that I will maintain the Veil of strict secrecy be- tween the First and Second Orders. Chesed That I will uphold to the utmost the authority of the Chiefs of the Order, and that I will not initiate or advance any person in the First Order, either secretly or in open Temple, without due authorisation and permission; that I will neither recommend a Candidate for admission to the First Order without due judgment and assurance that he or she is worthy of so great confidence and honour, nor unduly press any person to become a candidate; and that I will superintend any examination of Members of lower Grades without fear or favour in any way, so that our high standard of knowledge be not lowered by my instrumentality; and I further undertake to see that the necessary interval of time between the Grades of Practicus and Philosophus and between the latter Grade and the Portal, be, when possible, maintained. Geburah Furthermore, that I will perform all practical work connected with this Order in a place concealed and apart from the gaze of the outer and uninitiated world, and that I will not display our Magical Imple- ments, nor reveal the use of the same, but will keep secret this Inner Rosicrucian Knowledge even as the same hath been kept secret through the ages; that I will not make any symbol or Talisman in the Flashing Colours for any uninitiated person without a special per- <214> mission from the Chiefs of the Order.

Hod I further promise to support the admission of both sexes to our <215> Order, on a perfect equality, and that I will always display brotherly love and forbearance towards the members of the whole Order, neither slandering nor evil-speaking, nor repeating nor tale-bear- ing, whereby strife and ill-feeling may be engendered. Yesod I also undertake to work unassisted at the subjects prescribed for study in the various practical grades from Zelator Adeptus Minor to Adept Adeptus Minor, on pain of being degraded to that of Lord of the Paths of the Portal only. Malkuth Finally, if in my travels I should meet a stranger who professes to be a member of the Rosicrucian Order, I will examine him with care before acknowledging him to be such. Such are the words of this my Obligation as an Adeptus Minor, whereunto I pledge myself in the Presence of the Divine One, and of the Great Avenging Angel, HUA, and if I fail herein - may my Rose be disintegrated and my power in Magic cease. Third hands Dagger to Second Adept and holds Cup conveniently for him. Second dips point of Dagger in Wine and makes Cross on Aspirant - on brow, feet, right hand and left hand, and heart, saying: (for brow) There are Three that bear witness in Heaven; the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these Three are One. (for feet) There are Three that bear witness on Earth; the Spirit, the Water, and the Blood, and these Three agree in One. <216> (right Hand) Except ye be born of Water and the Spirit, ye cannot enter the Kingdom of Heaven.

This is done. Third Know, then, 0 Aspirant, that the Mysteries of the Rose and the Cross have existed from time immemorial, and that the Rites were prac- tised, and the Wisdom taught, in Egypt, Eleusis, Samothrace, Persia, Chaldea and India, and in far more ancient lands. The story of the introduction of these mysteries into mediaeval Europe has thus been handed down to us. In 1378 was born the Chief and Originator of our Fraternity in Europe. He was of noble German family, but poor, and in the fifth year of his age was placed in a cloister where he learned both Greek and Latin. While yet a youth he accompanied a certain brother P. A. L on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, but the latter, dying at Cyprus, he himself went to Damascus. There was then in Arabia a Temple of <217> the Order which was called in the Hebrew tongue \"Damkar\" (13bf), that is \"The Blood of the Lamb.\" There he was duly initiated, and took the Mystic title Christian Rosenkreutz, or Christian of the Rosy Cross. He then so far improved his knowledge of the Arabian tongue that in the following year he translated the bookM into Latin, which he afterwards brought back with him to Europe. After three years he went on into Egypt, where there was another Temple of the Order. There he remained for a time still studying the mysteries of Nature. After this, he travelled by sea to the city of Fessa, where he was welcomed at the Temple there established, and he there obtained the knowledge and the acquaintance of the habitants of the Elements, who revealed unto him many of their secrets. Of the Fraternity he confessed that they had not retained their Wisdom in its primal purity, and that their Kabala was to a certain extent altered to their religion. Nevertheless, he learned much there. After a stay of two years he came to Spain, where he endeavoured to reform the errors of the learned according to the pure knowledge he had received. But it was to them a laughing matter, and they reviled and rejected him, even as the prophets of old were rejected. Thus also was he treated by those of his own and other nations when he showed them the errors that had crept into their religions. So, after five years residence in Germany, he initiated three of his former <218> monastic brethren, Fratres G. W., I. A., and I. O., who had more knowledge than many others at that time. And by these four was made the foundation of the Fraternity in Europe. These worked and studied at the writings and other knowledge which C. R C. had brought with him, and by them was some of the Magical Language transcribed (which is that of the Elemental Tab- lets) and a Dictionary thereof made; and the Rituals and part of the Book M were transcribed. For the True Order of the Rose Cross descendeth into the depths, and ascendeth into the heights - even unto the Throne of God Himself, and includeth even Archangels, Angels and Spirits."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"The Golden Dawn: Volume ZZ Book Three These four Fratres also erected a building to serve for the Temple and Headquarters of their Order, and called it the Collegium ad Spiritum Sanctum, or the College of the Holy Spirit. This being now finished, and the work of establishing the Order extremely heavy, and because they devoted much time to the healing of those sick and possessed, who resorted to them, they initiated four others, viz: Fratres R C. (the son of the deceased father's brother of C. R C.), C. B. a skillful artist, G. C., and P. D., who was to be Cancellarius; all being Germans except I. A., and now eight in number. Their agree- ment was: 1. That none of them should profess any other thing, than but to cure the sick, and that freely. 2. That they should not be constrained to wear any distinctive dress, <219> but therein follow the custom of the country. 3. That every year on the day of Corpus Christi, they should meet at the Collegium ad Spiritum Sanctum, or write the cause of ab- sence. 4. Everyone should look for some worthy person of either sex, who after his decease might succeed him. 5. The word RC. to be their mark, seal, and character. The Fraternity to remain secret for one hundred years. Five of the Fratres were to travel in different countries, and two were to remain with Christian Rosenkreutz. Second Frater 1.0. was the first to die, and then in England where he had wrought many wonderful cures. He was an expert Kabbalist as his book H witnesseth. His death had been previously foretold him by C. R C. But those who were later admitted were of the First Order, and knew not when C. R died, and save what they learned from Frater A., the sucessor of D. of the Second Order and from their lib- rary after his death, knew little of the earlier and higher Members, and of the Founder, nor yet whether those of the Second Order were admitted to the Wisdom of the highest members. The discovery then of the Tomb wherein that highly illuminated Man of God, our Father C. R. C., was buried occurred as follows. After Frater A. died in Gallia Narbonensi, there succeeded in his <220> place Frater N.N. He, while repairing a part of the building of the College of the Holy Spirit, endeavoured to remove a brass memorial tablet which bore the names of certain brethren, and some other things. In this tablet was the head of a strong nail or bolt, so that when the tablet was forcibly wrenched away it pulled with it a large stone which thus partially uncovered a secret door, (he draws back curtain, revealing door), upon which was inscribed in large letters \"Post CXX Annos Patebo\" - After an hundred and twenty years I shall open, with the year of our Lord under, 1484. Frater N.N., and those with him then clearedaway the rest of the brickwork, but let it remain that night unopened as they wished first to consult the ROTA. Third You will now quit the Portal for a short time, and on your return the Ceremony of Opening the Tomb will be proceeded with. Take with"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Adeptus Minor Ritual 233 you this Wand and Crux Ansata, which will ensure your re-admis- sion. Aspirant goes out, carrying the Wand and Crux of Chief Adept. SECOND POINT Prepare Tomb as in diagram. Chief Adept lies in Pastos on his back to repre- sent C. R C. He is clothed in full Regalia; on his breast is the complete Sym- bol of the Rosy Cross suspended from the double Phoenix Collar. His arms are crossed on breast, and he holds Crook and Scourge; between them lies the <222> book T. Lid of Pastos closed and Circular Altar stands over it. Other Adepti outside Tomb as before. On the Altar are replaced Rose Cross, Cup of Wine, Chain and Dagger. Second Associate ~deptus Minor, let the Aspirant now be admitted. Third Ad. opens the door, and admits Aspirant, who carries Wand and Crux of Chief, He is placed in fronf of and facing Vault Door. Second Before the Door of the Tomb, as symbolic Guardians, are the Ele- mental Tablets, and the Kerubic Emblems, even as before the mysti- cal Gate of Eden stood the watchful Kerubim, and the Sword of Flame. These Kerubic Emblem be the powers of the Angles of the Tablets. The Circle represents the four Angles bound together in each Tablet through the operation of the all-pervading Spirit, while the Cross within forms with its spokes the Wheels of Ezekiel's Vision; and therefore are the Cross and the Circle white to represent the purity of the Divine Spirit. And inasmuch as we do not find the Elements unmixed, but each bound together with each - so that in the Air we find not only that which is subtle and tenuous, but also the qualities of heat, moisture and dryness, bound together in that all- wandering Element; and further also that in Fire, Water and Earth we find the same mixture of Nature - therefore the Four Elements are bound to each Kerubic Emblem counterchanged with the colour of the Element wherein they operate; even as in the Vision of Ezekiel <223> each Kerub had four faces and four wings. Forget not therefore that the Tablets and the Kerubim are the Guardians of the Tomb of the Adepti. Let thy tongue keep silence on our mysteries. Restrain even the thought of thy heart lest a bird of the air carry the matter. Third Upon more closely examining the Door of the Tomb, you will per- ceive, even as Frater N. N., and those with him did perceive, that beneath the CXX in the inscription were placed the characters IX thus: POST CXX ANNOS PATEBO Ix being equivalent to Post Annos Lux Crucis Patebo - At the end of 120 years, I, the Light of the Cross, will disclose myself. For the letters forming LVX are made from the dismembered and conjoined angles of the Cross and 120 is the product of the numbers from 1 to 5, multiplied in regular progression, which number five is symbolised in the Cross with four extremities and one centre point.

Every side was five feet broad, and eight feet high, even as the same is faithfully represented before you. Second Adept enters and passes by North to East of Vault, and turns to face West. Third Adept places Aspirant on North facing South, and takes his place at South facing North. <224> Second Although in the Tomb the Sun does not shine, it is lit by the symbolic Rose of our Order in the centre of the first heptagonal ceil- ing. In the midst of the Tomb stands a circular Altar with these devices and descriptions on it: A.G.RC.-Ad Gloriam Roseae Crucis. A.C.RG.-Ad Crucis Roseae Gloriam. Hoc Universal Compendium Unius Mihi Sepulchntm Feci- Unto the Glory of the Rose Cross I have constructed this Tomb for myself as a Compendium of the Universal Unity. Within the next circle is written: Yeheshua Mihi Omnia-Yeheshua is all things to me. In the centre are four figures of the Kerubim enclosed within circles surrounded by the following four inscriptions and each dis- tinguished by one of the letters of the Tetragrammaton:- Yod-Lion-Nequaquam Vacuum- Nowhere a Void. Heh-Eagle-Libertas Evangelii- Liberty of the Gospel Vau-Man-Dei Intacta Gloria- Unsullied Glory of God. Heh(f) -Ox-Legis Jugurn- Yoke of the Law. and in the midst of all is Shin, the Letter of the Spirit forming thus the Divine Name Yeheshua, from the Tetragrammaton. Therefore, by God's Grace, having come thus far, let us kneel down together, and say: <225> All kneel, joining wands above Altar. Second Unto Thee, Sole Wise, Sole Mighty and Sole Eternal One, be praise and Glory forever, Who has permitted this Aspirant who now kneeleth before Thee to penetrate thus far into the Sanctuary of Thy Mysteries. Not unto us, but unto Thy Name be the Glory. Let the influence of Thy Divine Ones descend upon his head, and teach him the value of self-sacrifice, so that he shrink not in the hour of trial, but that thus his name may be written on high, and that his Genius may stand in the presence of the Holy Ones, in that hour when the Son of Man is invoked before the Lord of Spirits and His Name in the pres- ence of the Ancient of Days. It is written: \"If any man will come after Me, let him take up his cross, and deny himself, and follow Me.\""},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"236 The Golden Dawn: Volume II Book Three Third Adept hands Chain to Aspirant, and takes Wand and Cross from him. Second Take therefore this Chain, 0 Aspirant, and place it about thy neck and say: I accept the Bonds of Suffering and Self-Sacrifice. 2nd and 3rd Adepts rise. Aspirant repeats words as directed. Second Rise, then, my Frater, in the symbol of self-renunciation and extend thine arms in the form of a cross. Aspirant rises, feet together, and arms extended. Second Associate Adeptus Minor, take from the Altar the Dagger of Penance and the Cup of Tribulation, that I may confirm the vow of the <226> Aspirant forever by marking him afresh with the Stigmata of the Cross. Seco~d takes Dagger from Third and marks Aspirant anew as at Obligation: brgw, feet, right hand, left hand, and heart. Gives Dagger back to Third who replaces it on Altar, and then hands Aspirant the Rose Crucifix. Second Take that symbol, raise it with both hands above thy head and say: \"Thus will I uphold the Sign of Suffering and of Strength.\" And I heard the voice of the King of Earth cry aloud and say: \"He that aideth me in my suffering, the same shall partake with me in my ris- ing.\" Replace then, 0 Aspirant, that Cross upon the Altar, and say: \"In and by that Sign, I demand that the Pastos of our founder be opened, for my victory is in the Cross of the Rose.\" For it is written Yf ye be crucified with Christ, ye shall also reign with Him.\" Aspirant replaces Crucifix and repeats words as directed.

And let the humble prayer of thy heart be: \"God, be merciul to me a sinner, and keep me in the pathway of Truth.\" Third Thus, then, did Frater N. N. and his companions, having moved <228> aside the Circular Altar, and having raised the brazen plate or lid of the Pastos, discover the body of our Founder, with all the ornaments and insignia as here shown before you. Upon his breast was the Book T, a saoll explaining in full the mystic Tarot; at the end of which was written a brief paragraph concerning Christian Rosen- kreutz, beneath which the earlier Fratres had inscribed their names. Following this came the names of the three Highest Chiefs of the Order, viz: Frater Hugo Alverda, the Phrisian, in the 576th year of his age. Frater Franciscus de Bry, the Gaul, in the 495th year of his age. Frater Elman Zata, the Arab, in the 463rd year of his age. Last of all was written: Ex Deo Nascimur; In Yeheshuah Morimur; Per Spiritum Sanctum Reviviscimus.

Chief (indicating Diagram of the Minutum Mundum) Behold the diagram Minuturn Mundum sive Fundamental Coloris - the Small Uni- verse or Foundation of Colour. Treasure it in thy heart, and mark it well, seeing that herein is the Key of Nature. It is, as thou seest, the diagram of the Sephiroth and the Paths, with the colours appro- priately attributed thereto. See that thou reveal it not to the profane, for many and great are its mysteries. Kether is the highest of all, and herein scintillates the Divine White Brilliance, concerning which it is not fitting that I should speak more fully. Chokrnah is Grey, the mixture of colours. Binah is darkness, <235> the absorption of colours. And thus is the Supernal Triad completed. In Kether is the root of the Golden Glory, and thence is the yellow reflected into Tiphareth. In Chokrnah is the root of Blue, and this is reflected into Chesed; in Binah is the root of Red, and this is reflected into Geburah. And thus is the first reflected Triad completed. The beams of Chesed and Tiphareth meet in Netzach and yield Green. The beams of Geburah and Tiphareth meet in Hod and yield a tawny Orange. The beams of Chesed and Geburah fall in Yesod and yield Purple. And thus is the Third Triad completed. And from the rays of the Third Triad are these three colours shown in Malkuth, together with a fourth which is the synthesis. For from the Orange Tawny of Hod and the Greening Nature of Netzach is reflected a certain Greenish Citrine - Citron; from the Orange Tawny mixed with the Puce of Yesod proceedeth a red russet Brown -Russet; and from the Green and the Puce cometh a certain other darkening green - Olive. The synthesis of all these is blackness and bordereth on the Qlippoth. But the colours of the 22 Paths are derived from and find their roots in those of the First Reflected Triad of the Sephiroth, the Three Supernals not otherwise entering into their composition, and thus are their positive colours found. Unto the Air is ascribed the Yellow colour of Tiphareth. Unto the Water is ascribed the blue Colour of <236> Chesed. Unto the Fire is ascribed the Red Colour of Geburah. The Colours are to be found in Malkuth. Those of the Planets are in the Rainbow scale; thus: Saturn -Indigo; Jupiter - Violet; Mars - Red; Sol - Orange; Mercury -Yellow; Venus - Green; Luna - Blue. Unto the Signs of the Zodiac are ascribed the following: Aries - Scarlet; Taurus - Red-Orange; Gemini - Orange; Cancer - Amber; Leo - Greenish-Yellow; Virgo - Yellowish-Green; Libra - Emerald; Scorpio - Greenish-Blue; Sagittarius - Blue; Cap ricornus - Indigo; Aquarius - Purple; Pisces - Crimson. Further, thou wilt observe that the colours of the Paths and the Sephiroth form a mutual balance and harmony on the Tree.

Second The colours of the Crook and Scourge are taken from those of the <237> Minutum Mundum Diagram, and they thus represent the just equi- librium between Mercy and Severity on the Tree of Life. The Crook therefore is divided into the colours symbolic of: Kether, Aleph, Chokmah, Taurus, Chesed, Leo, Tiphareth, Aries, Hod, Capricor- nus. And the Scourge into those syrnbolising: Netzach, Scorpio, Tiphareth, Gemini, Binah, Cancer, Geburah, Mem. Third (indicates Sword and Serpent) The colours of the Minutum Mundum are also the key to those which compose the Admission Badge of the Sword and Serpent; and thus by their aid it may be the better examined and comprehended. The one is ascending, the other is descending; the one is fixed, the other is volatile; the one unites the Sephiroth, the other the Paths. Furthermore, in the Serpent of Wis- dom is shown the ascending Spiral, and in the Sword the rush of the descending White Brilliance from beyond Kether, differentiated into various shades and colours, darkening more and more as they near Malkuth. Chief (indicates Diagram of Mountain) This is the symbolic Mountain of God in the centre of the Universe, the sacred Rosicrucian Mountain of Initiation, the Mystic Mountain of Abiegnus. Below and around it are darkness and silence, and it is crowned with the Light ineffable. At its base is the Wall of Enclosure and Secrecy, whose sole Gate- way, invisible to the profane, is formed of the Two Pillars of Hermes. The ascent of the Mountain is by the Spiral Path of the Serpent of <238> Wisdom. Stumbling on between the Pillars is a blindfolded figure, representing the Neophyte, whose ignorance and worthlessness while only in that Grade is shown by the @ = m, and whose sole future claim to notice and recognition by the Order is the fact of his having entered the Pathway to the other Grades, until at length he attains to the summit. I now proceed to instruct you in the mystic symbolism of the Tomb itself. Let the Altar be moved aside. @one) It is divided into three parts - the Ceiling which is White; the Heptagonal Walls of seven Rainbow colours, and the Floor whose prevailing hue is black; thus showing the powers of the Heptad between the Light and the Darkness. On the ceiling is a Triangle enclosing a Rose of 22 petals, within a Heptangle formed of a Heptagram reflected from the Seven Angles of the Wall. The Triangle represents the Three Supernal Sephiroth; the Heptagram, the Lower Seven; the Rose represents the 22 paths"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Adeptus Minor Ritual 243 of the Serpent of Wisdom. The Floor has upon it also the Symbol of a Triangle enclosed within a Heptagram, bearing the titles of the Averse and Evil Sephiroth of the Qlippoth, the Great Red Dragon of Seven Heads, and the inverted and evil triangle. And thus in the Tomb of the Adepti do we tread down the Evil Powers of the Red Dragon (ChiefAdepf stamps thrice on diagram) and so tread thou upon the evil powers of thy nature. For <240> there is traced within the evil Triangle the Rescuing Symbol of the Golden Cross united to the Red Rose of Seven times Seven Petals. As it is written \"He descendeth into Hell.\" But the whiteness above shines the brighter for the Blackness which is beneath, and thus mayest thou comprehend that the evil helpeth forward the Good. And between the Light and that Darkness vibrate the Colours of the Rainbow, whose crossed and reflected rays, under the Planetary Presidency are shewn forth in these Seven Walls. Remember that thou hast entered by the door of the Planet Venus, whose symbol includes the whole Ten Sephiroth of the Tree of Life.

The remaining squares represent the Keru- birn and the Eternal Spirit, the Three Alchemic Principles, the Three Elements, the Seven Planets, and the Twelve Signs, all operating in and differentiating the rays of each planet. Note that in all, the Cen- tral upper square alone remains white and unchanged, representing the changeless Essence of the Divine Spirit, thus developing all from the One, through the Many under the government of One. The colours of the varying squares may be either represented by the colour of the Planet and the colour of the Force therein mixed <242> together, or by these colours being placed in juxtaposition, or in any other convenient manner; but the foundation of them all is the Minutum Mundum Diagram. The symbolism of the Altar was briefly explained to you in the Second point. Upon the Altar stands a black Calvary cross, charged with a Rose of Five times Five petals, representing the interchanging energies of the Spirit and the Elements. Chief leads Aspirant out of Tomb. Two Adepti replace Altar, and all resume their places as at beginning of Third Point. Chief The head of the Pastos is white, charged with a golden Greek Cross and Red Rose of 49 Petals.

This may be done with both hands, and is always exchanged by plac- ing the hands, with fingers thus arranged, over the wrist of the Frater <243> or Soror being greeted. You will note that this grip must never be exchanged except across the Pastos. You will also remember that you must observe strict silence in regard to the place where you received this rite. It is well for you to understand that you are expected to promise that you will never tell anyone when, at what time, or where, of from whom you received this grip, or who was present at your initiation into this Order. The Signs and Passwords you have already received. Finally, you must understand that you are never permitted to say to anyone not a member of this Order that you are a Rosicrucian.

Among those characteristics which are truly necessary in the pursuit of magical knowledge and power, there is hardly any one more essential than thoroughness. And there is no failing more common in modern life than superficiality. There are many who, even in this grade which has been gained by serious study, after being charmed and instructed by first view of the Vault of Christian Rosencreutz, have made no attempt to study it as a new theme. There are many who have attended many ceremonial admissions and yet know nothing of the attribution of the seven sides, and nothing of the emblematic arrangement of the forty squares upon each side. Some of you do not even know that Venus is in an astrological sense mis- placed among the sides, and not two in five have been able to tell me why this is so, or what is the basis of the arrangement of the seven colors and forces. Many have told me which element out of the four is missing, and others have told me that the sign Leo occurs twice, but very few can tell me why the two forms of Leo are in different colours in each case, and only a few can tell me without hesitation which Three Sephiroth have no planet attached. And yet even in the a = grade you are told you must analyse and comprehend that Light or Knowledge, and not only take it on per- <281> sonal authority. Let us then be Adepti in fad, and not only on the surface; let our investigations be more than skin deep. That only which you can demonstrate is really known to you, and that only which is comprehended can fructify and become spiritual progress as distinguished from intellectual gain. Unless you can perceive with the soul as well as see with the eye your progress is but seeming, and you will continue to wander in the wilds of the unhappy. Let your maxim be Multum non multa - Much, rather than many things. And tremble lest the Master find you wanting in those things you allow it to be supposed that you have become proficient in. Hypocrisy does not become the laity; it is a fatal flaw in the character of the occultist. You know it is not only the teacher in this Hall before whom you may be humiliated, but before your higher and divine Genius who can in no wise be deceived by outward seeming, but judgeth you by the heart, in that your spiritual heart is but the reflection of his brightness and the image of his person, even as Malkuth is the material image of Tiphareth, and Tiphareth the reflection of the crowned Wisdom of Kether, and the concealed One. There is but a couple of pages in the 5-6 Ritual which refer to the sym- bolism of the seven sides of the Vault. Read them over carefully, and then let us study these things together. First, the seven sides as a group, and then the forty squares that are on each side. 266"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Symbolism of the Seven Sides The seven sides are all alike in size and shape and subdivision, and the forty squares on each side bear the same symbols. But the colouring is varied in the extreme, no two sides are alike in tint, and none of the squares <282> are identical in colour excepting the single central upper square of each wall, that square bearing the Wheel of the Spirit. The Seven walls are under the planetary presidency, one side to each planet. The sub- sidiary squares represent the colouring of the combined forces of the planet; the symbol of each square is represented by the ground colour, while the symbol is in the colour contrasted or complementary to that of the ground. Now these planetary sides are found to be in a special order, neither astronomical nor astrological. The common order of the succession of the planets is that defined by their relative distances from Earth, putting the Sun, however, in the Earth's place in the series thus: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon. Saturn is farthest from the Earth, and the Earth is be- tween Mars and Venus. Beginning with Satum in the case of the Walls of the Vault, the order is Satum, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Mercury, Venus, Moon. Here Mercury and Venus are transposed. But there is something more than this. For Saturn, the farthest off, is neither the door nor the East, nor anywhere else that is obviously intended. For it is the comer between the South and the South-West sides. Nor is Luna, at the other end of the scale, in any notable position on the old lines. There is, then, a new key to their order to be found and used, and such as are very intuitive see it at a glance. The planets are in the order of the Rain- bow colours, and in colours because this Adeptus Minor grade is the especial exponent of colours. You Adepti are in the Path of the Chamelion - Hodos Chamelionis. <283> If now you take the planetary colours and affix the planets and arrange them in the order of the solar spectrum and then bend up the series into a ring and make the chain into a Heptagrarn, and turn the whole about until you get the two ends of the series to meet at the Eastern point, you will have this mysterium: Violet-Jupiter. Indigo-Saturn. Blue-Moon. Green-Venus. Yellow-Mercury. Orange-Sun. Red-Mars. Science teaches, and has rediscovered a great truth, that however valu- able the seven colours of the prism may be, there are rays invisible and so not demonstrated here by space. Beyond the red end of the spectrum begins the violet, and these have a great chemical or Yetsiratic force. These forces, ever present and unseen, are represented by the Chief Adept standing erect at the Eastern angle, the most powerful person in the group, and delegate of the Chiefs of the Second Order, and through them of the mystic Third Order. He it is who has, symbolically, at any rate, passed from death unto life, and holds the Keys of all the creeds. And he it is who may place in our hands the Keys of the locked Palace of the King if we are able to make our knocking heard. Rep resenting the East, coming from the East, he faces the Western world, bring- ing intuition with him; before him lies the symbolic body of our Master C.R.C., our grand exemplar and founder - or at other times, the empty"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"The Golden Dawn: Volume 11 Book Three pastos, from which he has arisen, the Chief Adept. He has Mars and Geburah at his right hand, andJupiter and Gedulah at his left hand. He faces Venus in the West, the Evening Star, which represents the entry of the Candidate who has toiled all day until the evening. <284> At even he enters the Western door of the planet Venus, that sole planet unto whose symbol alone all the Sephiroth are conformed. At \"evening time there shall be light,\" the light of the mixed colours. So the newly admitted Adept comes in contact with totality of the planetary forces for the first time. A great opportunity opens before him; let him see well that he use it worthily. He enters through the green side of the vault. Green is the colour of growth; let him see that he grows. Upon each side of the vault are forty squares, five vertical series and eight horizontal, the whole being symbolically 5' x 8'. Now thepublished and printed Fama Fratematitas says these forty feet were divided into ten squares. If you are mathematicians you would know that ten similar squares could not alone be placed in such an area and yet fill it. Ten squares alone to fill a rec- tangle could only be placed in an area of the shape 5' x 6'. Hence in the Fama, ten squares are marked and salient\" - they are the Sephiroth. Besides the Ten Sephiroth, there are the following: There are the Four Kerubim, Three Alchemical Principles, Three Elements, Seven Planets, Twelve Zodiacal Signs, One Wheel of the Spirit - thus 40 in all. The Spirit Wheel is on every side and always in the centre, and is always depicted unchanged in black upon white. Upon the side there are always the 4 Kerubic emblems - zodiacal, yet different, for the Eagle replaces Scorpio. (Scorpio has three forms, the Scor- pion, the Eagle, and the Snake for the evil aspect.) These Kerubim represent the letters of the name YHVH, and <285> note that they are always arranged in the Hebrew order of the let- ters. Yod for the Lion, Heh for the Eagle, Vau for the Man, Heh final for the Ox, the Tauric Earth. Note that these four Zodiacal signs are not in their own colours, but as symbols of the elements have elementary colours. As Zodiacal signs, then, they are found to be compounds of the zodiacal and planet colours; but they are here as Kerubic emblems compounded of the Elemental colour and the Planetary colour of the side. The Three Principles are composed of the colour of the Principles, and the colour of the Planet of any particular wall. Mercury being fundamentally blue, Sulphur red, and Salt yellow. The Three Elements have fundamentally the usual three colours, Fire red, Water blue, Air yellow. Note that Earth is missing. The Seven planets have their colours as are often stated, and note that each of the seven is set beside its appropriate Sephirah, so that there are three Sephiroth which have no Planet: Kether, Chokmah, and Malkuth. The 12 Zodiacal Signs are the lower portion of the sides of the vertical column. The central one has none of the twelve; they are so allotted between the four remaining columns. Further note that they are only three ranks, the 5th, 7th, and 8th; none are in the 6th rank from above. This arrangement then shows: Four Triplicities and three Quaternaries."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Symbolism of the Seven Sides Observe well the arrangement; it is complex but not confused. <286> 1.

The Cardinal line shows the signs from the right in the order of astronomical sequence of the solar course: vernal equinox, summer solstice, autumn equinox, winter solstice. Rank 8. The common line shows the Signs again in a different position. Here the earliest in the year is Gemini on the left of Mem, and passing left to Virgo, you then go round to extreme right to Sagittarius, pass centrewards to Pisces close to Makuth. The colouring of each square is dual - a ground colour, and the colour of the emblem. The ground colour is a compound of the colour of the Planet of the side tinting the colour of the Force to which the Square is allotted. Each side has the Square of its own planet in its own unmixed colour, and with this exception all the coloured grounds are compound. The em- blem colour is always complementary to the ground colour. The ritual of the Adeptus Minor gives the definite colours of each planet and sign which are to be used in this system. There are other allotments of colour to each of these symbols and forces, but these are retained as mys- teries yet to be evolved and revealed when you have become familiar with the present simple and elementary system."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"CONCERNING THE USE OF THE VAULT <287> By G.

All who are eligible should use the Vault when it is in its place. When working it is well to be clothed in the White Robe and yellow sash, yellow slippers and yellow and white Nemyss on your head. Rose Cross should be upon the breast. Remember that within the Vault you never use a banishing Ritual. The chamber is highly charged by the Ceremonies which have been held there and the atmosphere thus created should not be disturbed. At first I do not recommend you to fast asa preliminary. Though later on when you set yourselves to attain some definite point, this may be necessary. Being then clothed, and at peace, you enter the Vault, light the candle, and kindle either a pastile in the small censer or, if you prefer it, some incense in the larger one. Place a chair as near Fast as you can, and having shut the door stand in the East, facing West, the door by which you entered, the wall bear- ing the symbol of Venus. Now cross your hands upon your breast in <288> the Sign of Osiris Arisen, breathe in a fourfold rhythm, regularly, and compose your mind. Then being calm and collected, make the full L VX Signs, repeating the accompanying words, and endeavour to bring down the Divine White Brilliance. Having done this, seat yourself, and give yourself up to meditation, tranquil and without fear. At first try to feel, it may be, or to see the play of the colours as they pass and repass from side to side and from square to square. Then await with serene expectation what mes- sage may be vouchsafed to you. When you are used to the place it is well to extinguish the light, for the darker the material atmosphere the better it is. Before leaving the Vault make the L V X Signs, and quit it with arms crossed upon breast in the Sign of Osiris risen. If you have elected to work in a group of two or three, proceed in the same manner, but take care to place yourselves in balanced disposition. Let me warn you never to argue, even in a friendly manner, while in the Vault. It may often happen that one of you sees more or less differently from the others. In this case make an audible note of the differences but do not go on to discuss it till you have ended the sitting, as any discussion is apt to disturb the delicate currents and so break the thread of your vision. It is permissible to take notes in writing during the sitting, but on the whole it is perhaps more satisfactory to impress everything clearly on your mind and write it down 2 70"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"On The Use of the Vault 2 71 immediately afterward. The next seven visits should be devoted to a careful study of each side of the Vault in turn, recalling all you know about each before you begin, and hav- ing your queries defined before you expect replies.

Again you may draw aside the Altar, lift the lid of the Pastos and contemplate the figure you may perceive lying within it. For this you should have a small candle lit on the Altar. Or you may lie down in the Pastos yourself and meditate there. Sometimes you may see the simulacrum of C. R. C. in the Pastos, or it may be your own Higher Self. In every case you should gain knowledge, power, and satisfaction.

The first Temple founded in England in 1887-88 under the governance of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was named very appropriately Isis-Urania. Isis-Urania is Venus, and she is the occult planet which rep- resents the Genius of this Order - Venus, the Evening and the Morning Star, presaging the rising of the Sun of ineffable Light. Venus is also, as Isis, a sym- bol of the Qabalistic Shekinah, the Glory of the Presence Divine, the Holy Spirit. After the Revolt in the Order about 1900, the schismatic sect appro- priated as the name of their Order, Stella Matutina, the Morning Star, thus continuing the significance of the enlightening function and purpose for which the Order was founded originally. For, if one may speak of the Order as having a specific purpose, then that sublime motive is to bring each man to the perfection of his own Kether, to the glory of his own higher Genius, to the splendour of the Golden Dawn arising within the heart of his soul. And its technique is always encompassed through the uplifting of the heart and mind by a theurgic invocation to Isis-Urania, the symbolic personification of the Sephiroth of the Supernal Light. It is well known that Venus is a planet peculiarly associated with occult and mystical aspiration. In The Secret Doctrine we find Blavatsky stating that \"Venus, or Lucifer, the planet, is the light-bearer of our Earth, in both <291> a physical and mystical sense.\" And in quoting from the Stanzas of Dzyan, she presents the statement that \"Thus Earth is the adopted child and younger brother of Venus.\" Hence a good deal of wisdom is con- cealed in the very choice of the name of the Order. To this we will have occa- sion to refer on a later page. In the Ritual of the Grade of Adeptus Minor, the Third Adept, reading from the historical account of the origins of the Order, states that \"The True Order of the Rose Cross ascendeth into the heights even unto the Throne of God himself.\" If the reader will well have studied the preliminary knowledge material of the Outer Order, he will remember it is said that the symbol of Venus - a true symbol of growth and development - embraces all the Ten Sephiroth of the Qabalistic Tree of Life. Since the Order is under the pres- idency of Venus, and in view of the above quotation, it would seem that the Order considered from a variety of viewpoints is allied to the Tree of Life, and vice-versa. Thus the system of grades, and the division of the organisation into Three Separate Orders - the Order of the Golden Dawn in the Outer, the Second Order of the R.R. et A.C., and the unnamed Third Order of Mas- ters, whose Sephiroth obtain above the Abyss - is based upon a natural and a very recondite series of correspondences. \"As above so below.\" So that as the Tree of Life consists of a glyph which represents not only a material 272"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"The Three Chiefs 2 73 physical universe but also a uranography of the invisible and spiritual world, so does the Order consist, in all actuality, of more than an external Order. Concealed within and behind the grade system, is the invisible Order, of true adepts, unknown and, in most cases, unnamed Masters. At the close of the Second Point of the 5-6 Ceremony, there are <292> named, without further reference, the Names and Ages of the \"Three Highest Chiefs of the Order\". These Chiefs are Hugo Al- verda, whose age is given as 576, Franciscus, who died at the age of 495 years and Elman Zata, who died at the age of 463. In addition to these three there is Christian Rosencreutz the Founder who died at the age of 106 years. . - These enormous ages, unbelievably long in the case of the three chiefs, imply - that is if we accept the history in its obvious and literal sense - that, as Adepts, they had discovered and employed the secret of the Elixir of Life, in order to prolong the period of their usefulness on Earth. And though they have died, that is discarded their purely physical instruments, it is not to be supposed they are cut off from our sphere of activity. Such is not the occult teaching. Apart from the probability that they may have since incarnated voluntarily once more on this plane to continue their work on behalf of man- kind in their own silent ways, they would have become what are known in the East as Nirmanakayas. Speaking in The Secret Doctrine of one group of Adepts, Blavatsky gives a definition of Nirmanakayas which is distinctly worth quoting: \"Maruts is, in occult parlance, one of the names given to those Egos of great Adepts who have passed away, and who are known also as Nir- manakayas; of those Egos for whom - since they are beyond illusion -there is no Devachan (heaven) and who, having either voluntarily renounced it for the good of mankind, or not yet reached Nirvana, remain invisible onEarth.\" Such must therefore be the. nature of the divine guardians -of our Order. A few lines following the above quotation in The Secret Doctrine, <293> Madame Blavatsky further remarks \"Who they are 'on earth' - every student of Occult science knows.\" Whether they do or not, at any rate, it is clear the Order has a little to say on this matter. There is an enormous amount of significant material in The Secret Doc- trine which should be very suggestive to the student of the magical wisdom. For The Secret Doctrine assists in the comprehension of the Order knowledge, and likewise the Order knowledge makes brilliantly clear what are otherwise highly obscure passages in that colossal monument of Blavatsky's erudition. The only one of these points that I wish to consider at the moment is this question of Adepts in relation to the Order. In the first half of Volume Two of The Secret Doctrine, there is a passage or two which I must quote: \"Alone a handful of primitive men - in whom the spark of divine Wisdom burnt bright, and only strengthened in its intensity as it got dimmer and dimmer with every age in those who turned it to bad purposes - remained the elect custodians of the Mysteries revealed to mankind by the divine Teachers. There were those among them, who remained in their Kumaric (divine purity) condition from the beginning; and tradition whispers, what the se- cret teachings affirm, namely, that these Elect were the germ of a Hierarchy, which never died since that period.\" The magical tradition has it too that the Three Chiefs and Christian Rosencreutz were of those who retained their"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"2 74 The Golden Dawn: Volume II Book Three knowledge of their divine origins and spiritual nature, and they have been constantly with us. The student would be well-repaid to study what H. P. B. has to say in the first Volume of The Secret Dodrine about the stem and <294> root of Initiators, that Mysterious Being who, born in the so-called Third Race of our evolutionary era, is called \"The Great Sacrifice\" and'the tree from which in subsequent ages, all the great historically known Sages and Hierophants . . . have branched off.\" More cannot be quoted here, but it is all highly significant, and the employment of Order methods cor- roborates a great deal of what she wrote. But I do intend to quote from what she calls the Catechism of the Inner Schools, which deals still further with the theme of the Secret Chiefs of our Order, or the undying Adepts of all Ages. 'The inner man of the first.. . only changes his body from time to time; he is ever the same, knowing neither rest nor Nirvana, spurning Devachan and remaining constantly on Earth for the Salvation of mankind.. . . Out of the seven virgin-men (Kumara) four sacrificed themselves for the sins of the world and the instruction of the ignorant, to remain till the end of the present Manvantara. Though unseen they are ever present. When people say of one of them, 'He is dead', behold, he is alive and under another form. These are the Head, the Heart, the Soul, and the Seed of undying knowledge. Thou shalt never speak, 0 Lanoo, of these great ones before a multitude, mention- ing them by their names. The wise alone will understand.\" Though I have lit- tle intention to speak of them more clearly, little harm can be done from what is already stated above, for the names used are clearly the pseudonyms or magical mottos of those great beings. If however, we consider these Chiefs from a wholly different point of view, the results are not less suggestive. Some students of the Order <295> have thought that these Three Chiefs may be considered as repre- sentative of certain principles in Nature or Sephiroth of the Tree of Life, particularly as it is said that the Order of the Rose Cross (the Ankh or the Venus symbol) ascendeth unto the Throne of God himself. How may we dis- cover, then, what principles are involved, and why? Two hints are given in the Adeptus Minor Ritual as to what procedure the student may follow in order to elucidate these obscure mysteries. Almost deliberately the ritual states, in the first place, that Darncar, whither our Father C. R. C. journeyed, may be transliterated into Hebrew, thus yielding 12D1, two words which, if translated mean the \"Blood of the Lamb\". The Lamb has always been a sym- bol of the Higher Ego. Secondly, there is the analysis of the Key-word I. N. R. I., whereby the English letters are transliterated into Hebrew, attributed to certain Yetziratic correspondences, Egyptian deities, signs and ideas. This must, then, be our technique with regard to this problem. The Qabalah is the means whereby we may unlock the closed doors of the veiled intimations which abound in the Order rituals. Through the application of this technique to the Names and Ages of the Chiefs, one may reasonably conclude that, as the historical lection of the Third Adept showed, They represent the Triune Supernal Light, the Divine White Brilliance invoked in the Vault of the Adepti - the letter Shin ex- tended, bursting through the balanced elemental powers of Tetragram- maton to confer the attainment of the Grade. If we transliterate the Names"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"The Three Chiefs 2 75 into Hebrew, first, of all, we have the following:- <296> b3b933N1b = 541 = 10 = 1 = Kether YJlil = 84 = 12 = 3 = Binah 8 ]~a%n = 776 = 20 = 2 = Chokmah 4 (It may be here remarked that the method of reducing numbers to units as shown above, while often called Theosophical addition, is actually the mode of working called Aiq Beker, or the Qabalah of Nine Chambers. This method of working was eliminated from the Order papers issued in one Temple by several high-grade initiates, whose natural stupidity was far in excess of their adeptship. By this method of Aiq Beker, the 22 letters and 5 finals of the He- brew alphabet are grouped together by threes according to units, tens, and hundreds in nine divisions.) Elman Zata is represented in the Rituals as being an Arab; that is his origins are in the South and East, representing heat and fire, and so the Alchemical Sulphur is a fit attribution. Sulphur is also an attribution of Chok- mah, to which also the element of Fire is allocated. Hugo is called the Phri- sian. If we refer this place to Frisia in Denmark, the North, then the Al- chemical Salt is a proper reference - Binah, and the element of Water, the Great Salt Sea. Franciscus is the Gaul, which country is a point between the North and the South, a temperate zone. Hence, he is the reconciler between them, a mediator, surely the Alchemical Mercury. Thus from this point of view, the Gematria of the Names of the Three Chiefs, allies them with the Light of the Supernal Sephiroth, that Light whichascendeth into the heights, even unto the Throne of God himself. Leaving, however, the Gematria of their individual Names for a moment, and proceeding to the Qabalah of the numbers of their <297> Ages, an equally interesting and significant fact is revealed. Hugo's age is given as 576, which reduces to 18=9. Franciscus age is given as 495, which reduces to 18=9. Elman's age is given as 463, which reduces to 13=4. 9 plus 9 plus 4, added together yield 22.22 is the number of the letters of the Hebrew Alphabet, the totality of the Paths linking the Sephiroth on the Tree of Life. This number also represents, therefore, the Serpent of Wisdom which rises from Malkuth to Kether, the ascending Spiral, the path which the aspirant to the Great Order must tread. In short, the Chiefs represent the Path itself which is to be followed, even as They represent the goal which is at the end thereof. Each initiate, it is the universal tradition of the Mystic path, must not only tread the Way, but must become, even as did these Three Chiefs, that Path itself. By referring the number 22 in a slightly different way to the Qabalah of Nine Chambers, we may obtain 220, which is the Gematria of Kor 13, the Lamb, Abi-Agnus, the Strength of our Race - also the initials of Christian Rosenkreutz. Moreover, 2 plus 2, equals 4, which is the number of Dalefh, which means a door, referred to Venus, the symbolical figure which em- braces the whole Tree of Life, revealing that compassion or love is that fiery"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"2 76 The Golden Dawn: Volume I1 Book Three force which binds together through an orderly growth and progression the whole Sephirotic Scheme into a Unity. And Daleth and Venus are the attributions of that door into the Tomb of the Justified One, the Vault of the Adepti, even as the reciprocal Path of Venus, Daleth, on the Tree of Life, is the Secret Gate which leads out from the Garden of Venus into the <298> newer life, the Glory of the Boundless Light. The secret of that Gate abides in the womb of the Great Mother, the intrinsic regenerating nature of the Empress of the Tarot - Isis-Urania. Again, there are other considerations. At the end of the Order document on the symbolism of the neophyte grade there is the statement that \"Nephesch ha-Mesiach, the Animal Soul of the Messiah\" is \"the Shekinah or Presence between the Kerubim.\" Note that the Shekinah represents, as I previously attempted to point out, Airna Elohim, the Supernal Sephiroth as a synthetic Unity, the Divine White Brilliance. Since this is spoken of as between the Kerubim, the Middle Pillar of the Tree, which is thus by definition the Path of the Redeemer or Messiah, the path of the Sushumna traversed by the Kun- dalini serpent is referred to. Now Messiah in Hebrew is spelt i19Wb and its Gematria is 358. There is another word in Hebrew having precisely the same enumeration, and that word is Will, Nachash, meaning a Serpent. As we demonstrated above, the ascending Spiral is represented by the Serpent of Wisdom, which is the path of the 22 letters of the Alphabet - and to this Ser- pent are the ages of the Thee Chiefs referred. Thus between the Serpent of Wisdom which represents the Way to the Crown, the Paths of the Tree of Life, and the Power of the Chiefs of the Order, there is seen agematria connection. Interestingly enough, in all ancient systems, the Serpent is also the Tempter, Lucifer - and once again, Lucifer is Venus, the Redeemer. Thus the Three Chiefs of the Order of the R. R et A. C. are the symbolic representatives of the Way to that Land which is beyond \"honey, <299> and spice and all perfection1', the Way to the Light itself. But they are also the Light at the end of the Way; they have become the divine attainment. How significant becomes the statement \"I am the Way, the Truth and the Life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me.\" There is one last correspondence before closing this paper. The sym- bolic drama of the Adeptus Minor Ritual has as its goal the union of the aspirant with the divine nature of Christian Rosencreutz. Theoretically, it is assumed that our Father C. R C. is the type and symbol of spiritual attain- ment, a man who achieved union with his Higher and Divine Genius, and was brought to the Light of his Kether. He is portrayed as a living man, who symbolically died, and like Osiris of old, was glorified through trial, perfect- ed through suffering, and rose again in a mystical resurrection. Now in the Ritual, he is referred to as \"The Light of the Cross\"and this latter is pictorially shown as \"I, CXX, which is 120. The Light of the Cross, CXX, is of course the LVX, the Light of the Supernals. Now 120 reduces to 12, and it is interesting to note that 12 is also the numeration of the Great Angel I-IUA who is invoked to overshadow the Aspirant when he is bound to the Cross of Obligation. HUA is, in the Zohar, one of the mystical Titles of Kether, the Crown of the Tree. Analysis of the Name expands the idea considerably. The Name is composed of three letters, Heh, Vau, Aleph. Heh is 5 in number, the Pentagram which is"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"The Three Chiefs 2 77 also the symbol of the microcosm. Vau is 6, the Hexagram, the symbol of the Macrocosm, the Greater World. Aleph is Unity. Thus the whole name sym- bolises the union of the microcosm with Macrocosm, and is a com- <300> plete synthesis of the nature'of the Adeptus Minor Grade itself, the accomplishment of the Great Work. So that the very expression of C. R C. - I, the Light of the Cross\" with the implication of its number, iden- tifies him mystically with the Great Angel HUA. Both become therefore the symbolic representatives of the higher and divine Genius of the Candidate for initiation - giving us the rationale of dramatic ceremonial, that the depicting of the life of a revered personality who at one time in the past attained, may also induce within the heart and mind of the aspirant the overwhelming glory of that same attainment. It becomes peculiarly significant to trace out, in this slight way, the unity and identical nature of all the symbols employed, and show how by analogous methods and meditation the whole of the Order teaching may be expanded into a profound and highly sigruficant system.

The elements themselves in the symbol of the Cross are governed by Yhvh. But the letter Shin, representing the Ruach Elohim, the Divine Spirit, being added thereto, the Name becometh Yeheshuah or Yehovashah - the latter when the letter Shin is placed be- tween ruling Earth and the other three letters of Tetragrammaton. From each re-entering angle of the Pentagram, therefore, issueth a ray, representing a radiation from the Divine. Therefore is it called the Flaming Pentagram, or Star of Great Light, in affirmation of the forces of Divine Light to be found therein. Traced as a symbol of good, it should be placed with the single point upward, representing the rule of the Divine Spirit. For if thou shouldst write it with the two points upward, it is an evil symbol, affirming the empire of matter over that Divine Spirit which should govern it. See that thou doest it not. Yet, if there may arise an absolute necessity for working or conversing with a Spirit of evil nature, and that to retain him before thee without tor- menting him, thou hast to employ the symbol of the Pentagram xeversed - (for, know thou well, thou canst have no right to injure or hurt even evil Spirits to grabfy curiosity or caprice) - in such a case, thou shalt hold the blade of thy Magical Sword upon the single lowest point of the Penta- <lo> gram, until such time as thou shalt license him to depart.

Spirit is pro- duced by the One operating in all things. The elements vibrate between the Cardinal points for they have not an unchangeable abode therein, though they are allotted to the Four Quarters in their invocation in the Ceremonies of the First Order. This attribution is derived from the nature of the winds. For the Easterly wind is of the Nature of Air more especially. The South Wind bringeth into action the nature of Fire. West winds bring with them moisture and rain. North winds are cold and dry like Earth. The S.W. wind is violent and explosive-the mingling of the contrary elements of Fire and Water. The N. W. and S. E. winds are more harmonious, uniting the influence of the two active and passive elements. Yet their natural position in the Zodiac is: Fire in the East, Earth in South, Air in West, and Water in the North. Therefore they vibrate: Air between West and East. Fire between East and South. Water between North and West. Earth between South and North. Spirit also vibrateth between Height and Depth. So that, if thou invokest, it is better to look toward the position of the winds, since the Earth, ever whirling on her poles, is more subject to their influence. But if thou wilt go in the Spirit Vision unto their abode, it is better for thee to take their position in the Zodiac. Air and Water have much in common, and because one is the container of the other, therefore have their symbols been at all times transferred, and the Eagle assigned to Air and Aquarius to Water. Nevertheless, it is better that they should be attributed as before stated and for the foregoing reason is it that the invoking sign of the one and the banishing sign of the other counterchange in <15, the Pentagram.

In certain cases, especially when working by or with the forces of the Planets, it may be wise also to use the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Hexagram. In order that a Force and a current and a colour and a sound may be united together in the same symbol, unto each angle of the Pentagram certain He- brew divine Names and Names from the Angelic Tablets are allotted. <16> These are to be pronounced with the invoking and banishing Penta- grams as thou mayest see in the foregoing diagrams. The attributions of the angles of the Pentagram is the key of its Ritual. Herein, during or* invokation without the use of the Tablets of the Elements, thou shalt pronounce the Divine Name A1 with the Pentagram of Water, and Elohirn with Fire, etc. But if thou art working with the Elemental or Enochian Tablets, thou shalt use the Divine Names in the Angelic lan- guage drawn therefrom.

The Hexagram is sometimes called the Signet or Symbol of the Macrocosm, just as the Pentagram is called the Signet Star or Symbol of the Microcosm. Ararita is a divine name of Seven letters formed of the Hebrew initials of the sentence: \"One is his beginning. One is his individuality. His permutation is one.\" As in the case of the Pentagram, each re-entering angle of the Hexagram issueth a ray representing a radiation from the divine. Therefore it is called the Flaming Hexagram, or the six-rayed Signet Star. Usually, it is traced with the single point uppermost. It is not an evil symbol with the two points upward, and this is a point of difference from the Pentagram. Now if thou dost draw the Hexagram to have by thee as a Symbol, thou shalt make it in the colours already taught and upon a black ground. These are the Planetary Powers allotted unto the Angles of the Hexagram. (King Scale) (Queen Scale) Unto the uppermost .................................. ....

Golden <21> The order of attribution is that of the Sephiroth on the Tree of Life. Hence ariseth the Supreme Ritual of the Hexagram according to the Angles from which it is traced. The uppermost angle answereth also to Daath and the lowest to Yesod, and the other angles to the remaining angles of the Microprosopus. The Hex- agram is composed of the two angles of Fire and Water, and is therefore not traced in one continuous line like the Pentagram, but by each Triangle separately. All the invoking Hexagrams follow the course of the Sun in their current, that is from left to right. But the banishing Hexagrams are traced from right to left from the same angle as their respective invoking Hexagrams con- tra y to the course of the Sun. The Hexagram of any particular Planet is traced in two Triangles, the first starting from the angle of the Planet, the second 287"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"288 The Golden Dawn: Volume ZZZ Book Four opposite to the commencing angle of the first. The Symbol of the Planet itself is then traced in the centre. Thus in the case of the invoking Hexagrams of Saturn, the first triangle is traced from the angle of Saturn, following the course of the Sun, the second triangle from the angle of the Moon. (Only trace the central Planetary symbol in practice - the others are shown onlw for illustration.) \" INVOKING Diagram 6 BANISHING q But the invoking Hexagram of the Moon is first traced from the angle of the Moon, its second angle being traced from the triangle of Saturn. The banishing Hexagram for Jupiter, for example, is traced from <22> the same angle as the invoking Hexagram, and in the same order, but reversing the current's direction. In all cases the Symbol of the Planet should be traced in the centre. But for the Sun all six invoking Hexagrams of the Planets should <26> be traced in their regular planetary order and the symbol 0 traced in the centre. And for his banishing hexagram also, all the six banishing hexagrams of the other Planets should be employed in their regular order, only that the symbol of the Sun should be traced therein. Remember that the symbol of Luna varieth, and as D in her increase she is favourable. But C is not so favourable for good in her decrease. The sym- bol of Luna in the centre of the Hexagram should be traced D if in her increase; by C if in her decrease. Remember that C represents restriction and is not so good a symbol as D, and at the full Moon exactly it is 0, but at new Moon a dark circle e. The last two forms of Luna are not good in many cases. If thou wilt invoke the Forces of the Head of the Dragon of the Moon thou shalt trace the lunar invoking Hexagram and write therein the symbol A, and for the tail W. These Forces of A and W are more easy to be invoked when either the Sun or the Moon is with them in the Zodiac in conjunction. In these invokations thou shalt pronounce the same Names and Letters as are given with the Lunar Hexagram. A is of a benevolent character, and W of a malefic, save in a very few matters. And be thou well wary of dealing with these forces of A and W or with those of Sol and Luna during the period of an eclipse; for they are the Powers of an eclipse. For an eclipse to take place both the Sun and Moon must be in conjunction with them in the Zodiac, these two luminaries being at the same time either in conjunction or opposition as regards each other."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Diagram 7 INVOKING BANISHING 4 3 SHADDI EL CHAI x+f\":~g*x: 1. n - D B ELOHIM TZABAOTH"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Diagram 8 Invoking Banishing ELOHIM GIBOR"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Diagram 9 Invoking ELOAH VE-DA Six Invoking Hexag~ams for Sol."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"Diagram 10 Banishing ELOAH Six Banishing Hexagrams for Sol. 292"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Hexagram Ritual 293 In all Rituals of the Hexagram as in those of the Pentagram, thou shalt complete the circle of the place. Thou shalt not trace an external circle round each Hexagram itself unless thou wishest to confine the force to one place - as in charging a Symbol of Talisman. <27> From the attribution of the Planets, one to each angle of the Hex- agram, shalt thou see the reason of the sympathy existing between eachsuperior planet and one certain inferior Planet. That is, that to which it is exactly opposite in the Hexagram. And for this reason is it that the Triangle of their invoking and banishing Hexagrams counter-change. The superior Planets are Saturn, Jupiter, Mars. The inferior Planets are Venus, Mercury, Luna. And in the midst is placed the Fire of the Sun. Therefore the superior Saturn and the Inferior Luna are sympathetic, so are Jupiter and Mercury, Mars and Venus. In the Supreme Ritual of the Hexagram the Signs of the 8 = Grade are to be given, but not those of the Grades of the First Order, notwithstand- ing these latter are made use of in the Supreme Ritual of the Pentagram. And because the Hexagram is the Signet Star of the Macrocosm or Greater World, therefore is it to be employed in all invocations of the Forces of the Sephiroth: though the Signet Star of the Pentagram represents their operation in the Luna World, in the Elements and in Man. If thou wilt deal with the Forces of the Supernal Triad of the Sephiroth, thou shalt make use of the Hexagrams of Saturn; for Chesed those of Jupiter, for Geburah those of Mars; for Tiphareth those of the Sun, and for Netzach those of Venus, and for Hod those of Mercury, and for Yesod and Malkuth those of the Moon. Know also that the Sephiroth are not to be invoked on every slight occa- sion, but only with due care and solemnity. Above all, the forces of Kether and Chokrnah demand the greatest purity and solemnity of heart and mind in him who would penetrate their mysteries. For such high knowledge is only to be obtained by him whose Genius can stand in the Presence of the Holy Ones. See that thou usest the Divine Names with all reverence and humility for cursed is he that taketh the Name of the Vast One in vain. <28> When thou tracest the Symbol of a Planet in the centre of a Hex- agram, thou shalt make the same of a proportionable size to the interior of the Hexagram, and thou shalt trace them from left to right gen- erally following the course of the Sun as much as possible. Caput and Cauda Draconis may follow the general rule. When thou shalt invoke either the Forces of one particular Planet or those of them all, thou shalt turn thyself towards the Quarter of the Zodiac where the Planet thou invokest then is. For owing both to their constant motion in the Zodiac and to the daily movement of the same, the position of a Planet is continually changing, and therefore it is necessary for thee in such a case to erect an Astrological Figure or Scheme of the position of the Planets in the heavens for the adual time of working, so that thou mayest see the direction of each Planet from thee.

ADDENDUM Now in the Supreme Ritual of the Hexagram, when thou shalt wish to attract in addition to the forces of a Planet, those of a Sign of the Zodiac wherein he then is, thou shalt trace in the centre of the invoking Hexagram of the planet, the Symbol of that Sign of the Zodiac beneath his own; and if this be not sufficient, thou shalt also trace the invoking Pentagram of the Sign as it is directed in the ritual of the Pentagram. In the tracing of the Hexagram of any Planet thou shalt pronounce therewith in a vibratory manner as before taught, both the Divine Name of the Sephirah which ruleth the Planet and the Seven-lettered Name Ararita, and also the particular letter of that Name which is referred to that par- ticular Planet. Now if thou shalt wish to invoke the forces of One particular Planet, thou shalt find in what Quarter of the heavens he will be situate at the time of working. Then thou shalt consecrate and guard the place wherein thou art by the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Hexagram. Then thou shalt perform the Lesser Invoking Ritual of the Hexagram, yet tracing the four figures em- ployed from the angle of the Planet required, seeing that for each Planet the mode of tracing varieth. If thou dealest with the Sun, thou shalt invoke by all six forms of the Figure and trace within them the Planet Symbol and pro- nounce the Name Ararita as has been taught. Then shalt thou turn unto the quarter of the planet in the Heavens and shalt trace his invoking Hexagram and pronounce the proper Names, and invoke what Angels and Forces of that Nature may be required, and <36> trace their Sigils in the air. When thou hast finished thy invocation thou shalt in most cases license them to depart and perform the Banishing Ritual of the Planet which shall be the converse of the invoking one. But in cases of charging a Tablet or Symbol or Talisman, thou shalt not perform the Banishing Symbols upon it which would have the effect of entirely de-charging it and reducing it to the condition it was in when first made - that is to say dead and lifeless. If thou wishest to bring the Rays of all or several of the Planets into action at the same time, thou shalt discover their quarter in the Heavens for the time of working, and thou shalt trace the general Lesser Invoking Ritual of the Hexagram, but not differentiated for any particular Planet, and then thou shalt turn to the Quarters of the respective Planets and invoke their Forces as before laid down; and banish them when the invocation is finished, and con- clude with the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Hexagram.

It is carried by the Z. A. M. at all meetings of the Second Order at which he has the right to be present. It is to be made by himself unassisted, and to be consecrated by himself alone. It is to be untouched by any other person, and kept wrapped in white silk or linen, free from external influences other than his own on the human plane. The Wand has the upper end white, the lower black. Between these are the 12 colours referring to the Zodiacal Signs, in the positive or masculine scale of colour. At the upper end of the white is fixed a Lotus flower in three whorls of 26 Petals: the outer 8, the middle 8, and the innermost 10. The calyx has four lobes or sepals of orange colour. The flower centre is orange or gold. The Lotus Wand should be from 24 to 40 inches long, and of wood about half an inch thick. The several bands of white, 12 colours, and black may be paint- ed or enamelled, or formed of coloured papers pasted on. The length of colours should be such that the white is a little the longest, then the black, while the 12 colours are equal, and smaller than the black. The colours must be clear, brilliant and correct. They are as follows: White: Aries-red: Taurus-red-orange: Gemini-orange: Cancer- amber: Leo-lemon-yellow: Virgo-yellow-green: Libra-emerald: Scorpio- green-blue: Sagittarius-bright-blue: Capricornus-indigo: Aquarius- violet: Pisces-crimson: black. The Lotus flower may be made of sheet metal or card board, in 3 whorls of 8,8, and 10 petals, white internally and tips curved in a little, olive outside with 5 markings as shown in diagram. The centre is orange, or a brass bolt to keep all together will do. As a general rule, use the white end in invocation and the. black <40> end to banish. The white end may be used to banish by tracing a banishing symbol against an evil and opposing force which has resist- ed other efforts. By this is meant that by whatever band you are holding the Wand, whether white for spiritual things, by black for mundane, by blue for Sagittarius or by red for fiery triplicity, you are, when invoking, to direct the white extremity to the quarter desired. When banishing, point the black end to that quarter. The Wand is never to be inverted, so that when very material forces are concerned, the black end may be the most suitable for invocation, but with the greatest caution. In working on the plane of the Zodiac, hold the Wand by the Portion you refer to between the thumb and two fingers. If a Planetary working be required, hold the Wand by the Portion rep- resenting the day or night House of the Planet, or else by the Sign in which the Planet is at the time.

Should the action be with the Elements, one of the Signs of the Triplicity of the Elements should be held according to the nature of the Element intend- ed to be invoked. Bear in mind that the Kerubic Emblem is the most powerful action of the Element in the triplicity. For example, Leo - Violent heat of summer. Aries - Beginning of warmth in spring. Sagittarius, waning of heat in autumn. <41> Hold the Wand by the white porh'on for all Divine and Spiritual Mat- ters or for the Sephirotic influences, and for the process of rising in the Planes. Hold the Wand by the black part only for material and mundane matters. The 10 upper and inner Petals refer to the Purity of the Ten Sephiroth. The middle 8 refer to the counter-charged natural and spiritual forces of Air and Fire. The lowest and outer 8 refer to the powers of Earth and Water. The centre and amber portion refers to the Spiritual Sun, while the outer calyx of 4 orange sepals shows the adion of the Sun upon the life of things by differentiation. The Wand should never be used inverted. The Lotus Flower is not to be touched in working, but in Sephirotic and Spiritual Things, the Flower is to be inclined towards the forehead; and to rise in the Planes, the orange coloured centre is to be fully directed to the forehead.

For this purpose, you build up an astral image of the person, in the centre of the room, and call down the Light upon him, after surrounding him with the six crosses. When the ceremony is done, command the astral shape you have made to return to the person, bearing with it the peace of Yeheshuah. 5.

It is to be made by each Adept alone, and consecrated by himself and never touched by any other person; and wrapped in white silk or linen when not in use. It is a complete synthesis of the Masculine, Positive or Rainbow scale of Colour attributions, which is also called \"The Scale of the King.\" The four ends of the Cross belong to the four Elements, and are coloured accordingly. The white portion belongs to the Holy Spirit and the Planets. The Twenty-two petals of the Rose refer to the twenty-two Paths. It is the Cross in Tiphareth, the receptacle and the centre of the Forces of the Sephiroth and the Paths. The extreme centre of the Rose is white, the reflected Spiritual bright- ness of Kether, bearing upon it the Red Rose of Five Petals and the Golden Cross of Six Squares; four green Rays issuant around the Angles of the Cross, from which the Second Order takes its name. They are the Symbols of the Receiving Force. Upon the white portion of the Symbol, below the Rose, is placed the Hexagram, with the Planets in the order which is the key of the Supreme Ritual of the Hexagram. Around the Pentagrams, which are placed one upon each Elemental coloured arm, are drawn the symbols of the Spirit and the Four Elements, in the order which is the key to the Supreme Ritual of the Pentagram. <52> Upon each of the floriated ends of the Cross are arranged the Three Alchemical Principles, but in a different order for each Element, and as showing their operation therein. The upmost Arm of the Cross, allotted to Air, is of the yellow colour of Tiphareth. In it the flowing Philosophic Mercurial nature is chief and without hindrance to its mobility; hence the ever moving nature of Air. Its Sul- phureous side is drawn from the part of Fire, whence its luminous and elec- trical qualities. Its Saline side is from the Water, whence result clouds and rain from the action of the Solar Forces. The lowest Arm of the Cross, allotted to Earth, is of the four colours of Malkuth, the Earth being of the nature of a container and receiver of the other influences. The Citrine answers to its Airy part, the Olive to the Watery, the Russet to the Fire, and the black to the lowest part, Earth. Here also is the Mer- curial part chief, but hindered by the compound nature whence its faculty becomes germinative rather than mobile, while the Sulphur and the Salt are 310"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"The Rose Cross Lamen 311 respectively from the sides of Water and Fire, which almost neutralize their natural operation and bring about the fixedness and immobility of Earth. The extremity allotted to Fire is of the scarlet colour of Geburah, and in it the Sulphureous nature is chief, whence its powers of heat and burning. The Salt is from the side of Earth, whence the necessity for a constant substantial pabulum whereon to act, and the Mercury is from the side of Air, whence the leaping, lambent motion of flame especially when acted upon by wind. The extremity allotted to Water is of the blue colour of Chesed, and in it the Saline side is chief as exemplified in the salt water of the Ocean, to which all waters go; and from whence also is derived the nature of always preserv- ing the horizontal line. The Mercurial part is from Earth, whence the weight and force of its flux and reflux. Its Sulphuric part is from the Air <53> whence the effect of waves and storms. So that the disposition of these Three Principles forms the key of their Alchemic operation in the Elements. The White rays issuing from behind the Rose at the inner angles be- tween the Arms, are the Rays of the Divine Light issuing and corruscating from the Reflected Light of Kether in its centre; and the letters and symbols on them refer to the analysis of the Key Word of an Adeptus Minor, I. N. R. I. by which the opening of the Vault is accomplished. The Twelve letters of the Twelve Petals follow the Order of the Signs of the Zodiac. Uppermost is Heh, the letter of Aries, followed by Vau, Zayin Cheth, Teth, Yod, while the letter of Libra, which is Lamed is lowermost. Ascending are Nun, Samekh, Ayin, Tzaddi, Qoph. The Seven Double Letters of the middle row are allotted to the Planets in the order of their Exaltations, the planets being wanderers; the Stars are fixed with respect to the Earth. These letters are Peh, Resh, Beth, with Daleth exact- ly over Libra, followed by Gimel, Caph, Tau. The Three Mother letters are allotted to the Elements and are so ar- ranged that the Petal of Air should be beneath the Arm of the Cross allotted to Air, while those of Fire and Water are on counterchanged sides, so that the forces of the Arms of the Cross should not too much override the Planetary and Zodiacal forces in the Rose, which might otherwise be the case were the Petal of Fire placed on the same side as the Arm of Fire and that of Water on the side of Water. (The Mode of Sigil Formation from the Rose Petals is taught in the sup- plement to this Ritual, reproduced in Book Seven in Volume Four.) The back of the Cross bears inscriptions in Latin: \"The Master Jesus Christ, God and Man,\" between four Maltese Crosses which represent the Four Pyramids of the Elements opened out. This is placed at the upmost part because therein is affirmed a <54> Descent of the Divine Force into Tiphareth, which is the central point between Supernals and Inferiors. But at the lowest part is written the motto of the Zelator Adeptus Minor, because therein is the affirmation of the elevation of the Human into the Divine. But this is impossible without the assistance of the Divine Spirit from Kether, whence the space above Malkuth is white upon the front aspect of the Cross, white being the Symbol of the Spiritual rescued from the"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"312 The Golden Dawn: Volume I11 Book Four Material. In the centre is written in Latin between the Symbols of the Alchemical Principles, of which the outermost is Sulphur, the Purgatorial Fire of Suffer- ing and Self-Sacrifice, \"Blessed be the Lord our God who hath given us the Symbol Signum.\" And this is a word of six letters, thus representing the six Creative Periods in the universe. The Cross may be cut out of cardboard and the coloured portions may be painted or formed by pasting on portions of coloured papers of the required size and shape. The Colours must be correct, clear and brilliant. If they are not, the Symbol is useless either as a Symbol or Insignium. If this occurs the whole should be destroyed, for faulty colours or shapes in Divine Symbols are a degradation of Divine things and are practical blasphemy, because it is substituting the Evil and disorderly for the Good. NOTES ON THE ROSE CROSS It is unfortunate that I have not been able to reproduce the symbol in its colours as painted by the Adeptus Minor. Black and white give no indication of the beauty and impressive quality which this symbol possesses. The reader should therefore make one for himself and colour it according to these directions. The upper arm, above the Rose, attributed to the Element of Air, is paint- ed in bright yellow. Various lacquer enamels are now available, the <55> use of which produces just the right kind of brilliance required for these magical symbols and flashing Tablets. Over the yellow should be painted the symbols shown in its direct complement, pale mauve. The right arm attributed to Water, is blue, and the symbols should be painted thereon in orange. It is difficult to describe the correct tone or depth of colour in these complementaries, but the student will know when he has hit upon the right hue for then the symbols will begin visibly to flash. The left arm, the Fire arm, is red, and the symbols appear on it in bright emerald green. Beneath the Rose are two sections. The first is white, upon which a hexagram with planetary attributions is painted in black. Beneath this is the Earth section, which should be painted in the four colours of Malkuth: Citrine, Olive, Russet, and Black. Superimposed on this, the penta- gram and symbols will be painted in white. The Petals of the Rose wil be painted in the appropriate colours of the King Scale, and the Letters, on them, in the complementary colours, the Cross within is Gold, the barbs green, and the Rose red.-1.R <57> CONSECRATION ROSE CROSS CONSECRATION CEREMONY 1.

For this reason it is under the Presidency of Geburah and of Mars, whose Names and Forces are to be invoked at its consecration, which should take place in the day and hour of Mars, or else during the course of the Fiery Tattwa. Any convenient sword may be adapted to this use, but the handle, hilt and guard must be such as to offer surfaces for inscriptions. It should be of medium length and weight. The motto of the Adeptus should be engraved upon it, or upon the hilt in letters of emerald green, in addition to the mystic devices and names. The hilt, pommel and guard are to be coloured a flame red. The blade should be clean and bright. Pentagrams should be painted on salient portions, because this is the lineal figure of Geburah. The Divine and Angelic Names related to Geburah are then to be added in emerald, and also their Sigils taken from the Rose. The Sword must then be consecrated in due form. Here again let the Zelator Adeptus Minor remember his Obligation never to use his knowledge of practical Magic for purposes of Evil, and let him be well assured that if he do this, notwithstanding his pledge, the evil he endeavours to bring about will re-ad on himself. He will experience in his own person and affairs that very thing which he has endeavoured to bring about for another. So also may he perish and be blotted out from among us. To obtain real force implanted in any magical weapon, by consecration, the Adept requires to be healthy, pure, strong in mind, free from anxi- <63> ety and apart from disturbances. He requires also to have mastered the details of the ceremony and to be familiar with the proper penta- grams and other symbols.

So that even if only one is to be used the others should be also present, even as each of the Four Elemental Tablets is divided in itself unto Four Lesser Angles representing the other three Elements bound together therewith in the same Tablet. Therefore also let the Z. A. M. remember that when he works with these forces he is as it were dealing with the Forces of the Letters of the Divine Name. Each Implement must be consecrated, and when this has been done, no one else must touch it. THE WAND FOR FIRE The staff of the Wand should be of wood, rounded and smooth and per- forated from end to end. Within it should be placed a magnetised steel rod, just so long as to project 1/16 inch beyond each end of the wood. It is often convenient to form the Wand of cane which has a natural hollow through it. If of cane, there should be three natural lengths according to the knots, so that these knots may be placed similarly to the manner in the figure which is such as a turner would produce. Eighteen inches is an extreme length; (Note: That of the present writer is about ten inches long.-I.R.) The magnet would be a strong one. One end of the wood should be cone-shaped. The North end of the magnet, known by its repelling the so-called North Pole of a compass needle, should be placed at the end of the Wand which is plain.

This is explained under the chapter concerning the Hegemon. Of the Temple in Reference to the Sephiroth. The Temple, as arranged in the Neophyte Grade of the Order of the Golden Dawn in the Outer, is placed looking towards the Yh of Yhvh in Malkuth in Assiah. That is, as Y and H answer unto the Sephiroth Chokmah and Binah in the Tree, (and unto Abba and Aima, through whose knowledge alone that of Kether may be obtained) even so, the Sacred Rites of the Temple may gradually, and as it were, in spite of himself, lead the Neophyte unto the knowledge of his Higher Self. Like the other Sephiroth, Malkuth hath also its subsidiary Sephiroth and Paths. Of these Ten Sephiroth, the Temple as arranged in the Neophyte Grade, in- cludeth only the four lower Sephiroth in the Tree of Life, viz: Malkuth, Yesod, Hod, and Netzach, and the Outer side of Paroketh, the Veil. Paroketh formeth the East of the Temple. First in importance cometh the symbolism of the East. The Three Chiefs who govern and rule all things, the Viceroys in the Temple of the unknown Second Order beyond, are the reflections therein of the Powers of Chesed, Geburah and Tiphareth. They represent: the Imperator - Geburah and the Grade @ = : the Praemonstrator - Chesed and the Grade 0 = m: the Cancellarius - Tiphareth and the Grade @ = m. <83> Now the Imperator governeth because in Netzach, which is the highest Grade of the First Order, 6 = a, is the Fire reflected from Geburah.* The Praemonstrator is Second, because in Hod, which is the next highest Grade, @ = m, is the Water reflected from Chesed. The Third is the Cancellarius, because in Yesod, @ = m, is the Air reflected from Tiphareth. Thus the Order is governed by a Triad, one in intention but having different functions: the Imperator to command: the Praemonstrator to instruct: the Cancellarius to record. The proper mantle of Office of the Imperator is the flame scarlet Robe of Fire and Severity, as on him do the energy and stability of the Temple depend: and if he has sub-officers to assist him, they partake of his sym- bolism. His Mantle is the symbol of unflinching Authority, compelling the obedience of the Temple to all commands issued by the Second Order; and upon the left breast thereof, is the Cross and Triangle of the Golden Dawn, both white, representing the purification of the Temple in the Outer Order by Fire. He may wear a Lamen similar to that of Hierophant, of the same colours, but depending from a scarlet collar, and he may bear a Sword similar to that of Hiereus. His place in the Temple is at the extreme right of the Dais and at the Equinox he takes the Throne of Hierophant when that Office is vacated. 'Note: This reflection is passed from Geburah into the Imperator, Fire being the \"Head\" of the God-Name of Jehovah, ie. Yod, Heh, Vau andHeh Final. Likewise, the Outer Order follows this Elemental Ordering, consisting of itself, the body of the Demiurge, with Nekach being the upper-most of the four elemental grades, corresponding to FIRE. This is clearly an intentional ritual ranking, as the new Philosophus is told at the conclusion of his or her initiation.. . \"You are, as havingrisenso high in the Order, to.. .aid.. .the Membersof the Second Order.. . also to supervise the studies of the. . . less advanced brethren,. . .\" @ook Three, p. 150) H.S."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"332 The Golden Dawn: Volume 111 Book Five The proper Mantle of Office of the Praemonstrator is the bright blue Robe of Water, representing the reflection of the Wisdom and Knowledge of Chesed. His duty is that of Teacher and Instructor of the Temple, always limited by his Obligation to keep secret the Knowledge of the Second Order from the Outer Order. He superintends the working of the Outer Order, see- ing that in it nothing be relaxed or profaned; and duly issues to the Temple any instruction regarding the Ritual received by him from the Greatly Hon- oured Chiefs of the Second Order. He is therefore to the Temple the Re- flector of the Wisdom beyond. His sub-officers partake of his sym- <84> bolism. The White Cross and Triangle on his left Breast on the Robe represents the purification of the Outer Order by Water. He may wear a Lamen like that of Hierophant, but blue upon an orange field and depending from a collar of blue. He may bear a Sceptre surmounted by a Maltese Cross in the Elemental Colours. The proper Mantle of Office of the Cancellarius is the yellow Robe of Air. Upon him depend the Records of the Temple, the order of its working, the arrangements of its Meetings and the circulation of its manuscripts. He is the Recorder and, more immediately than either of the preceding Chiefs, the Representative of the executive authority of the Second Order over the Outer. His duty is to see that in no case knowledge of a Grade be given to a Member who has not properly attained to it. He is the immediate circulator of all communications from the Second Order. His sub-officers partake of his symbolism. His White Cross and Triangle represent the purification of the Outer Order by Air. Cancellarius may wear a Lamen like that of Hierophant, but of yellow on a purple field, and depending from a purple Collar; and he may bear a Sceptre surmounted by a Hexagram of amber and gold. The Sceptres of the Chiefs should be of the same colour as their Mantles, with a gold band to represent Tiphareth, being the first Grade of the Inner Order. The Sword of Imperator should have a plain scarlet hilt, with gold or brass mountings, while the Sceptre of Praemonstrator should be blue with a gold band. The proper seat of the Chiefs is beside the Hierophant, and if desired the Imperator and Cancellarius may be seated to the right and Praemonstrator and Immediate Past Hierophant to his left - the Calcellarius and Immediate Past Hierophant being nearest to the Hierophant on their respective sides. The Chiefs stand before the Veil in the East of the Temple, as the Representatives of the Inner Order and therefore no meeting can be held without one of them. Preferably all Three Chiefs should be present. <85> The other Officers of the Temple exist only by their authority and permission. Because the East of the Temple is the outer side of Paroketh,allMembers of the Second Order wear the Crossed Sashes of a Lord of the Paths of the Portal of the Vault only - no higher Grade being allowed to be shown in a Temple of the First Order. Members of the Second Order should be seated in the East of the Temple when practicable. Any Past Hierophant may wear a Mantle of a Hierophant and a Jewel of that Larnen, but not a large Collar Lamen. Immediate Past Hierophant may have a Sceptre of a Hierophant. The Chiefs, or Members asked to represent them on the Dais, wear white gowns. The cords and tassels of all Mantles of Chiefs or Officers should"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Enterer of the Threshold 333 be white to symbolise spiritual purity and influence of the Divine and Shin- ing Light. Members of the Outer Order wear a black gown or tunic, with a Sash indicating their Grade across it. The Black Sash crosses from the left shoulder (from the side of the Black Pillar, as they first received it), and the White Sash from the Right shoulder. Egyptian Head-Dresses, or Nemysses are worn by the Chiefs and Officers, those of the Chiefs being of the Colour of their Mantles striped with the complementary colour; those of the Officers being striped equally black and white. Members may wear similar nemysses in black and white or plain black squares of approved pattern. The Key to the formation of the tunic and nemyss is the Crux Ansata for the nemyss makes the oval, and the arms and body of the tunic, the cross. THE SYMBOLISM OF THE TEMPLE The Bases of the two Pillars are respectively in Netzach and Hod; the White Pillar being in Netzach and the Black Pillar in Hod. They represent the Two Pillars of Mercy and Severity. The bases are cubical and black to <86> represent the Earth Element in Malkuth. The columns are respec- tively black and white to represent the manifestation of the Eternal Balance of the Scales of Justice. Upon them should be represented in coun- terchanged colour any appropriate Egyptian designs, emblematic of the Soul. The scarlet tetra-hedonal capitals represent the Fire of Test and Trial: and between the Pillars is the porchway of the Region Immeasurable. The twin lights which burn on their summits are \"The Declarers of the Eternal Truth.\" The bases of the tetrahedra, being triangular, that on the white pillar points East, while that on the Black points West. They thus complete the Hex- agram of Tiphareth - though separate, as is fitting in \"The HalI of the Dual Manifestation of Truth.\" The Altar, whose form is that of a double cube, is placed in the Eastern part of Malkuth, as far as the Neophyte is concerned. But to the Adeptus Minor, its blackness will veil on the East Citrine, on the South olive, on the North russet, while the West side alone, and the base, will be black, while the summit is of a brilliant whiteness. The Symbols upon the Altar represent the Forces and Manifestation of the Divine Light, concentrated in the White Triangle of the Three Supernals as the synthesis; wherefore, upon this sacred and sublime Symbol, is the obligation of the Neophyte taken as calling therein to witness the Forces of the Divine Light. The Red Cross of Tiphareth (to which the Grade of @ = is referred) is here placed above the White Triangle, not as dominating it, but as bringing it down and manifesting it unto the Outer Order; as though The Crucified One, having raised the symbol of self-sacrifice, had thus touched and brought into action in matter, the Divine Triad of Light. Around the Cross are the Symbols of the Four Letters of the Name Jehovah - the Shin of Yeheshuah being only implied and not expressed in the Outer Order. At the East is the Mystical Rose, allied by its scent to <87> the Element of Air. At the South is the Red Lamp, allied by its Flame"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"334 The Golden Dawn: Volume 111 Book Five with the Element of Fire. At the West is the Cup of Wine, allied by its fluid form to the Element of Water. At the North are Bread and Salt, allied by their substance to the Element of Earth. The Elements are placed upon the Altar according to the Winds. \"For Osiris on-Nophris who is found perfect before the Gods, hath said: 'These are the Elements of my Body, Perfected through Suffering, Glorified through Trial. For the scent of the Dying Rose is as the repressed Sigh of my suffering: And the flame-red Fire as the Energy of mine Undaunted Will: And the Cup of Wine is the pouring out of the Blood of my Heart. Sacrificed unto Regeneration, unto the Newer Life: And the bread and Salt are as the Foundations of my Body, Which I destroy in order that they may be renewed. For I am Osiris Triumphant, even Osiris on-Nophris, the Justified: I am He who is clothed with the Body of Flesh, Yet in whom is the Spirit of the Great Gods: I am The Lord of Life, triumphant over Death. He who partaketh with me shall arise with me: I am the Manifestor in Matter of Those Whose Abode is the In- visible: I am purified: I stand upon the Universe: I am its Reconciler with the Eternal Gods: I am the Perfector of Matter: And without me, the Universe is not.' \" Technically, the Door is supposed to be situated behind the seat of Hiereus in the West; but it may be in any part of the Hall, seeing that the walls represent the Barrier to the Exterior. 'The Gate of the Declarers of <88> Judgment\" is its name - and its symbolic form is that of a straight and narrow Doorway, between two Mighty Pylons. \"The Watcher against the Evil Ones\" is the name of the Sentinel who guards it and his form is the symbolic one of Anubis. THE STATIONS OF THE OFFICERS The Hierophant is placed in the East of the Temple, on the outer side of the Veil Paroketh, to rule the Temple under the Presidency of the Chiefs. There he fills the place of a Lord of the Paths of the Portal of the Vault of the Adepts, acting as Inductor to the Sacred Mysteries. The Insignia and Sym- bols of Hierophant are: The Throne of the East in the Path of Samekh, outside the Veil. The Mantle (or Cloak. See pg. 111, Vol. 111) of bright flame scarlet, bearing a white cross on the left breast. The Lamen suspended from a white Collar. The Crown-headed Sceptre. The Banner of the East. The position of the Throne on the Path Samekh is fitting for the Inductor to the Mysteries, as there being placed in that balanced and central position"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"Enterer of the Threshold 335 of that Path by which alone is safe entrance to the mystical knowledge of the Light in Tiphareth. Being placed before Parokethat the point of its rending, it there marks the shining forth of the Light through the Veil; and that transla- tion of the Three Supernals to the Outer Order, which is represented by the red Calvary Cross and the White Triangle upon the Altar. Thus the station of Hierophantls Throne, fitly represents the Rising of the Sun of Life and Light upon our Order. The Robe of scarlet represents the flaming energy of the Divine Light, shining forthinto infinite Worlds. Upon the left breast is a White Cross to rep- resent purification unto the Light, and this Cross may be one of the following forms:- In which case it alludes ei- CALVARY: <89> ther to the moss of six squares of Tiphareth or to the Cross of the Rivers.

A Cross of the Elements, symbolis- ing their purification through the Light of the Four-lettered Name Yhvh in Tiphareth.

PYRAMIDAL: EQUILATERAL: + MALTESE: It is indifferent which of the Crosses be employed, seeing that each rep- resents the operation of the Light through the Veil. The Sceptre represents the forces of the Middle Pillar. It is scarlet with gold bands to represent the places of the Sephiroth Daath, Tiphareth <90> and Yesod, the pommel being Malkuth. The shaft represents the Paths Gimel, Samekh and Tau. The Grip by which it is wielded, is the path Tau, representing the Universe governed by and attracting the forces of the Light. The Names of Sephiroth and Paths are not marked thereon, but the Hierophant Initiate of the Second Order should remember the sublimity of the symbolism while he wields it. It represents him as touching thereby the Divine Light of Kether and attracting it through the Middle Pillar to Malkuth. It is called \"The Sceptre of Power\" and invests him with the power of declar-"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"336 The Golden Dawn: Volume 111 Book Five ing the Temple Open or Closed in any Grade, if time be short, and this is done by saying: \"By the power in me vested by this Sceptre, I declare this Temple duly opened (or closed) .\" This method of Opening and Closing \"by Sceptre\" should only be used in great emergency where time presses. It should not be used in a Ceremony Elemental Spirits have been invoked - especially not in the Closing. The Lamen is partially explained in the Portal Ceremony thus: \"The Hierophant's Lamen is a synthesis of Tiphareth, to which the Calvary aoss of six squares, forming the cube opened out, is fitly referred. The two colours, red and green, the most active and the most passive, whose conjunction points out the practical application of the knowledge of equilibrium, are sym- bolic of the reconciliation of the celestial essences of Fire and Water. For the reconciling yellow unites with blue in green, which is the complementary colour to red, and with red in orange which is the complementary colour to blue. The small inner circle placed upon the Cross alludes to the Rose that is conjoined therewith in the symbolism of the Rose and Cross of our Order.\" But in addition to this, it represents the blazing light of the Fire of the Sun bringing into being the green vegetation of the otherwise barren Earth. And also the power of self-sacrifice requisite in one who would essay to <91> initiate into the Sacred Mysteries. So as the Sceptre represents the Authority and Power of the Light, the Lamen affirms the qualifica- tions necessary to him who wields it, and therefore is it suspended from a white collar, to represent the Purity of the White Brilliance from Kether. Hence it should always be worn by the Hierophant. The Banner of the East is also partially explained in the Portal:-\"The field of the Banner of the East is White, the colour of light and purity. As in the previous case, the Calvary Cross of six squares is the number of six of Tiphareth, the yellow Cross of Solar Gold, and the cubical stone, bearing in its centre the sacred Tau of Life, and having bound together upon it the form of the Maaocosmic Hexagram, the red triangle of Fire and the blue triangle of Water - the Ruach Elohirn and the Waters of Creation.\" In addition to this explanation, it affirms the Mode of Action employed by the Divine Light in its operation by the Forces of Nature. Upon it is the symbol of the Macrocosm so coloured as to affirm the action of the Fire of the Spirit through the Waters of Creation under the harmony of the Golden Cross of the Reconciler. Within the centre of the Hexagram is a Tau cross in White, to represent its action as a Triad; and the whole is placed on a white field representing the Ocean of the Ain Soph Aour. The Banner is suspended fromagold coloured bar by red cords, and the pole and base should be white. The base represents the purity of the foundation - the shaft, the Purified Will directed to the Higher. The golden cross-bar is that whereon the Man- ifested Law of Perfection rests; the Banner itself, the Perfect Law of the Universe, the red cords and tassels the Divine Self-renunciation, Whose trials and sufferings form, as it were, the Ornament of the Completed Work. The whole represents the ascent of the Initiate into Perfect Knowledge of the Light - therefore in the address of the Hiereus the Neophyte hears \"Even the Banner of the East sinks in Adoration before Him,\"as though that <92> symbol, great and potent though it be, were yet but an inferior pre-"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"Enterer of the Threshold 337 sentment of the Higher, fitted to our comprehension. \"Expounder of the Sacred Mysteries\" is the name of the Hierophant, and he is \"Osiris\" (Aeshoorist) in the Nether World. (St added as a suffix to a name indicates the influence from Kether.) The Station of Hiereus is at the extreme West of the Temple and in the lowest point of Malkuth where he is enthroned in its darkest part, in the quar- ter represented black in the Minutum Mundum Diagram. Representing a Terrible and Avenging God at the Confines of Matter, at the borders of the Qlippoth, he is enthroned upon Matter and robed in Darkness, and about his feet are Thunder and Lightning - the impact of the Paths of Shin and Qoph - Fire and Water, terminating respectively in the russet and olive quarters of Malkuth. There, therefore, is he placed as a mighty and avenging Guardian to the Sacred Mysteries. The Symbols and Insignia of Hiereus are: The Throne of the West in the Black of Malkuth, where it borders on the Kingdom of Shells, The Black Robe of Darkness, bearing a white cross on the left breast; The Sword of Strength and Severity; The Lamen suspended from a Scarlet Collar. The Banner of the West. The position of the Throne of the West at the limits of Malkuth is fitting for the Avenger of the Gods, for he is placed there in eternal affirmation against the Evil Ones - \"Hitherto shall ye come and no further.\" The Throne is also placed there as a seat of witness and of punishment decreed against Evil. The Robe or Mantle is of Darkness, threatening and terrible to the Outer, as concealing an avenging Force ever ready to break forth against the Evil Ones. On the left breast is a white Cross to represent the Purification <93> of Matter unto the Light. The Sword represents the Forces of the Pillar of Severity as a whole, but the places of the Sephiroth are not necessarily indicated thereon. The guard is Hod and may be of brass; the Grip is the Path of Shin and may be of scarlet, and the pommel,Malkuth, may be black. The grip by which it is wielded, being the Path Shin, represents the Universe governed by the flaming force of Severity, and represents the Hiereus as wielding the Forces of Divine Severity. \"The Sword of Ven- geance\" is its name. The Lamen is partially explained in the Portal thus: The Outer Circle includes the four Sephiroth, Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod, and Yesod, of which the first three mark the angles of the triangle inscribed within, while the con- necting Paths Nun, Ayin, and Peh form its sides. In the extreme centre is the Path Samekh through which is the passage for the Rending of the Veil. It is therefore a fitting Lamen for Hiereus as representing the connecting Link be- tween the First and Second Orders, while the white triangle established in the surrounding Darkness is circumscribed in its turn by the Circle of Light.\" In addition to this explanation, the Lamen represents \"The Light that shineth in Darkness though the Darkness comprehendeth it not.\" It affirms the pos- sibility of the Redemption from Evil and even that of Evil itself, through self- sacrifice. It is suspended from a scarlet Collar as representing its dependence on the Force of Divine Severity over-awing the evil. It is a symbol of tremen-"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"338 The Golden Dawn: Volume 111 Book Five dous Strength and Fortitude, and is a synthesis of the Office of Hiereus as regards the Temple, as opposed to his Office as regards the outer world. For these reasons it should always be worn by Hiereus. The Banner of the West completes the symbols of Hiereus. It is thus explained in the Zelator Grade: \"The White Triangle refers to the three Paths connecting Malkuth with the other Sephiroth; while the red cross is the Hid- den Knowledge of the Divine Nature which is to be obtained through their aid. The Cross and Triangle together represent Life and Light.\" In <94> addition to this explanation from the Zelator Grade, it represents eternally the possibility of Rescuing the Evil; but in it the Tiphareth cross is placed within the White Triangle of the Supernals as thereby rep- resenting that Sacrifice as made only unto the Higher. The red Cross may be bordered with gold in this instance, to represent the Perfect Metal obtained in and through the Darkness of Putrefaction. Black is its field which thus rep- resents the Darkness and Ignorance of the Outer, while the White Triangle is again the Light which shineth in the Darkness but which is not compre- hended thereby. Therefore is the Banner of the West the symbol of Twilight - as it were the equation of Light and ~arkness. The pole and the base are black, to represent that even in the Depths of Evil can that symbol stand. The cord is black, but the transverse bar and the lance-point may be golden or brass and the tassles scarlet as in the case of the Banner of the East, and for the same reasons. The Banner of the West, when it changes its position in the Temple, rep resents that which bars and threatens, and demands fresh sacrifice ere the Path leading to the Higher be attained? \"Avenger of the Gods\" is the name of Hiereus, and he is \"Horus in the Abode of Blindness unto, and Ignorance of, the Higher.\" Hoor is his name. The Station of Hegemon is between the Two Pillars whose bases are in Netzach and Hod, at the intersection of the Paths Peh and Samekh, in the symbolic Gateway of Occult Science - as it were, at the Beam of the Balance, at the Equilibrium of the Scales of Justice; at the point of intersection of the Lowest Reciprocal Path with that of Samekh, which forms a part of the Mid- dle Pillar. She is placed there as the Guardian of the Threshold of Entrance and the Preparer of the Way for the Enterer - therefore the Recon- <95> ciler between Light and Darkness, and the Mediator between the Stations of Hierophant and Hiereus. The Symbols and Insignia of Hegemon are: The Robe of Pure Whiteness, bearing on the left breast a Red Goss. The Mitre Headed Sceptre. The Larnen suspended from a Black Collar. The Robe represents the Spiritual Purity which is required in the As- pirant to the Mysteries and without which qualification none can pass be- tween the Eternal Pillars. It represents the Divine Light which is attracted thereby and brought to the aid of the Candidate. It symbolises the Self- The White Triangle is the Supemals which lay beyond the Abyss from which No-One returns, because the only entry to resurrection is Death. . . without compromise or abridgement.

It also signifies the atonement of error, the Preparer of the Pathway unto the Divine. Upon the left Breast is a Cross, usually the Calvary fonn, of red to repre- sent the energy of the lower Will, purified and subjected to that which is Higher - and thus is the Office of Hegemon especially that of the Reconciler. The Mitre-Headed Sceptre is the distinctive ensign of Office of Heg- emon. On the Tree of Life it represents the forces of the Pillar of Mercy. It should be of scarlet with gold bands and pommel. The bands represent the places of the Sephiroth Chesedand Netzach - the shaft being formed by the Paths Vau and Kaph, the grip by which it is wielded being the Path Qoph, while the pommel is Malkuth. The Mitre is gold with red mountings and each point terminates in a ball. The mitre is charged with a red calvary cross of Six squares. This Mitre represents the Wisdom of Chokmah as a duplicated aspect of Kether, attracted by the symbol of self-sacrifice. The Sceptre is wielded by the forces of Flux and Reflux, shown by the grip being referred to the Path Qoph, and it represents the attraction into the Universe of the Forces of Divine Mercy. The Sephiroth and Paths are marked only as bands, and owing to its meaning, should be carried by Hegemon in all conduct- <96> ing of the Candidate, as representing to the latter the attraction of the Forces of his Higher Self. It is called \"The Sceptre of Wisdom.\" The Lamen is explained in part in the Grade of Philosophus thus: \"The peculiar emblem of the Hegemon is the Calvary Cross of Six Squares within a Circle. This Cross embraces Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod and Yesod, and rests upon Malkuth. Also the Calvary Cross of Six Squares forms the cube and is thus referred to the Six Sephiroth of Microprosopus which are Chesed, Geburah, Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod and Yesod.\" In addition to this explanation, it represents the black Calvary Cross of Suffering as the Initiator by Trial and Self-Abnegation, and the Opener of the Way into the Comprehension of the Forces of the Divine Light. It is therefore suspended from a black Collar to show that Suffering is the Purgation of Evil. \"Before the Face of the Gods in the Place of the Threshold is the name of Hegemon, and she is the Goddess Thma-Ae-St having the following Cop- tic forms: Thrna-Ae-St - This as regards the Middle Pillar and the influence from Kether. Thma-aesh - This more Fiery as regards her influence with respect to the Pillar of Severity. Thrnaa-ett - This more Fluidic with regard to her influence with respect to the Pillar of Mercy. She is the Wielder of the Sceptre of Dual Wisdom from Chokmah and therefore is the Mitre head split in two and not closed, to indicate the Dual Manifestation of Wisdom and Truth: even as the Hall of the Neophytes is called \"the Hall of the Dual Manifestation of the Goddess of Truth.\" The Three Inferior Officers do not wear Mantles, but only Lamens sus- pended from black Collars.

The upper point of the Wand rests on Kether and the Wings stretch out to Chokrnah and Binah, thus com- prehending the Three Supernal Sephiroth. The lower seven are embraced by the Serpents whose heads fall on Chesed and Geburah. They are the twin Serpents of Egypt and the currents of Astral Light. Furthermore, the Wings and the top of the Wand form the letter Shin, the symbol of Fire; the Heads and upper halves of the Serpents form Aleph the symbol of Air; while their tails enclose Mem, the symbol of Water - the Fire of Life above, the Waters of Creation below, and the Air symbol vibrating between them.\" In addition to this, the Caduceus of Kerux represents the balanced forces of Eternal Light working invisibly in the Darkness - even as the Light borne before the hood-winked Candidate at his Initiation, is symbolic of the Light which guides him in the darkness of the world though he sees it not nor knows it. This Caduceus is the Rod of Hermes, containing invisible and unsuspected forces, the rules of whose administration may be revealed through meditation. It is the outer form of the Wand surmounted by the Winged Globe below which the Twin Serpents are shown - the Wand of the Chief Adept in the @ = Grade. The Lamen of Stolistes is thus explained in the Grade of Practicus: \"The Cup of Stolistes partakes in part of the symbolism of the Laver of Moses and the Sea of Solomon. On the Tree of Life it embraces nine of the Sephiroth exclusive of Kether. Yesod and Malkuth form the triangle below, the former apex, the latter the base. Like the Caduceus, it further represents the three Elements of Water, Air, and Fire. The crescent is the Water which is above the Firmament; the circle is the Firmament, and the triangle is the consuming Fire below, which is opposed to the Celestial Fire symbolised by the upper part of the Caduceus.\" <98> In addition to this explanation, the Cup represents the Recepta- cle and Collector of the more Fluidic Forces of the Light, and is the symbol of an inexhaustible Bowl of Libation from which Reservoir the Adept may draw the Reserved Forces of the Light - which matter again calls for meditation. The Lamen of Dadouchos is thus explained in the Grade of Zelator: \"The Hermetic Cross, which is also known as Fylfot, Hammer of Thor, and Swastika, is formed of 17 squares taken from a square of 25 lesser squares. These 17 fitly represent the Sun, the Four Elements and, the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac.\" In addition to this, the Lamen has a more extended meaning. The Her- metic Cross, the Bolt of Whirling Flame, which is represented by the cross of Four Axes whose heads may be either double of single and turned in either direction, is a symbol of terrific Strengthland represents the Fire of the Spirit, cleaving its way in all directions through the Darkness of Matter. Therefore is it borne on the Lamen of Dadouchos whose office is that of Purification and Consecration by Fire, and from it also may be drawn by meditation several formulae of strength."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"Enferer of the Threshold 341 The Kerux is the principal form of Anubis, as the Sentinel is the sub- sidiary form.

The Stolistes is stationed in the Northern Part of the Hall to the North- West of the Black Pillar whose base is in Hod, and is there as the Affirmer of the powers of Moisture, Water, reflected through the Tree into Hod. The Cup is the Receptacle of this, filled from Hod so as to transmit its forces into Malkuth, restoring and purifying the vital forces therein by Cold and Mois- ture. \"Goddess of the Scale of the Balance at the Black Pillar\" is the name of Stolistes and she is \"The Light Shining through the Waters upon Earth,\" Aura-Mo-Ooth, and there is a connection between her and the Aurim or Urirn of the Hebrews. The Dadouchos is stationed towards the midst of the Southern part of the Hall, to the South-West of the White Pillar whose base is in Netzach and is there as the Affirmer of the Powers of Fire, reflected down the Tree to Net- zach. The Censer is the Receptacle thereof - the transmitter of the Fires of Netzach to Malkuth, restoring and purifying the vital force therein by Heat and Dryness. \"Goddess of the Scale of the Balance at the White Pillar\" is the name of Dadouchos and she is ''Perfection through Fire manifesting on Earth.\" Thaum-Aesch-Nia-eth, and there is a connection between her and the Thummirn of the Hebrews. The Stolistes has the care of the Robes and Insignia of the Temple as syrnbolising by their cleansing and purification the Purging away of the Evil of Malkuth by the Waters of the Spirit. The Dadouchos has charge of all lights, fires and incense, as represent- ing the purifying and purging of Malkuth by Fire and the Light of the Spirit. These Officers also purify the Temple, the Members and the Candidate by Water and by Fire, as it is written: '7 indeed baptise you with Water, <loo> but One shall come after me who shall baptise ye with the Holy Ghost and with Fire.\" This completes the names and titles of the Officers of a Temple and they are Seven in number and may all be taken by a Frater or Soror.

They represent, as it were, Veiled Divinities sending a form to sit before the Veil Paroketh, and, like the Veils of Isis and Nephthys, impenetrable save to the Initiate. The <101> synthesis of the Three Chiefs may be said to be in the form of Tho- 0th Who cometh from behind the Veil at the point of its Rending. Yet separately, they may be thus referred: The Imperator, from his relation to Geburah, may be referred to the Goddess Nephthys, The Praemonstrator, from his relation to Chesed, may be referred to the Goddess Isis, The Cancellarius, from his property of Recorder, may be referred to the God Thoth: No ceremony of the Outer Order may take place without a Chief - pre- ferably the Three Chiefs or their Vice-gerants present - and on account of the Stations on the Dais, it is well to have these stations filled by an Adept, should a Chief be absent. These Stations and those of the Officers are called the Visible Stations of the Gods, and descriptions of the forms which an Adept Officer builds up as a focus of force are given in another paper. THE INVISIBLE STATIONS These are: 1. The Stations of the Kerubim.

The Stations of Isis, Nephthys, Aroueris. 1. The Kerubim: The Stations of the Man, the Lion, the Bull, and the Eagle are at the Four Cardinal Points without the Hall, as invisible Guardians of the limits of the Temple. They are placed according to the winds - beyond the Stations of Hierophant, Dadouchos, Hiereus, and Stolistes - and in this order do their symbols appear in all Warrants of Temples. The Kerub of Air formulates behind the Throne of Hierophant. She has a young girl's countenance and form, with large and shadowing wings; and she is a power of the Great Goddess Hathor who unites the powers of Isis and Nephthys. To the Sign Aquarius is she referred as a correlative, <102> which represents Springs of Water breaking upon Earth; though as a Zodiacal Sign it is referred to Air, the container of Rain. The Egyp- tian name of the Sign Aquarius is Phritithi. Note: \"Thou shalt not confound the Kerubim with their Signs of the Zodiac, notwithstanding that the latter be under the Presidency of the former, seeing that the Kerub representeth a far more Sublime Potency, yet acting by a har- monious sympathy through the particular Sign allotted unto their corre- spondence.\" . The Kerub of Fire has the face and form of a Lion with large and clashing wings. He formulates behind the Throne of Dadouchos and he is a power of the Great Goddess Tharpesh or Tharpheshest, the latter syllable being nearly Pasht. The action of the Lion Kerub is through the Flaming Fire of Leo of which the Egyptian name is Labo-Ae. The Kerub of Water has the face and form of a Great Eagle with large and glistening wings and he formulates behind the throne of Hiereus. He is a power of the Great God Thoomoo, and his operation is by the Sign of Scor- pio, which is called in Egyptian Szlae-Ee. (Note: In Egyptological works the name of this God is Tum or Tmu.-I. R.) The Kerub of Earth has the face and form of a Bull with heavy and darkening wings. He formulates behind the Throne of Stolistes and he is a power of the Great God Ahaphshi and his operation is by the Sign Taurus called Ta-Aur in Egyptian. 2. The Children of Horus: Between the Invisible Stations of the Keru- bim are those of the Four Vice-gerants of the Elements and they are situated at the Four Comers of the Temple, at the places marked by the Four Rivers of Eden in the Warrant; for the body of a Warrant, authorising the formation and establishment of a Temple, represents the Temple itself - of which the Guardi- ans are the Kerubim and the Vice-gerents in the places of the Rivers.

Kabexnuv or Dabexnjemouv. 3. The Station of the Evil One. This station is in the place of Yesod and is called the Station of the Evil One, the Slayer of Osiris. He is the Tempter, Accuser, and Punisher of the Brethren and in Egypt is represented mostly with the head of a Water-Dragon, the body of a Lion or leopard, and the hind- parts of a Water-horse. He is the Administrator of the power of the Evil Triad: The Stooping Dragon, Apophrassz. The Slayer of Osiris-Szathan Toophon. The brutal power of Demonic Force-Bessz. The Synthesis of this Evil Triad \"The Mouth of the Power of Destruc- tion\" is called Ommoo-Szathan. 4. The Station of Harpocrates. The Invisible Station of Harpocrates is in the Path of Samekh, between the Station of Hegemon and the Invisible Sta- tion of the Evil Triad. Harpocrates is the God of Silence and Mystery, whose Name is the Word of this Grade of Neophyte. He is the younger brother of Horus, Hoor-Po-Krattist. 5. The Stations of Isis and Nephthys. The Stations of Isis and Nephthys are respectively at the Places of the Pillars in Netzach and Hod, and these Great Goddesses are not otherwise shown in the Grade, save in <104> connection with the Praemonstrator and Imperator, as operating through the Hierophant, seeing that Isis corresponds to the Pillar of Mercy and Nephthys to that of Severity; and therefore the positions of the Pillars or Obelisks are but, as it were, the Places of their feet. The Station of Aroueris. The Invisible Station of Aroueris (Horus the Elder) is beside the Hierophant as though representing the power of Osiris to the Outer Order - for while the Hierophant is an Adeptus, he is shown only as Lord of the Paths of the Portal - so that, when the Hierophant moves from the Throne of the East, he is no longer Osiris but Aroueris. Yet when the Hierophant is on the Dais the Station of Aroueris is that of the Immediate Past Hierophant who sits on the Hierophant's left. Aroo-ouerist. This ends the Constitutory Symbolism of a Temple in the @ = Grade of Neophyte. Should a Member have occasion to quit his place, he shall do it moving with the course of the Sun; and as he passes the place of Hierophant, he shall salute with the Sign. And when he enters or quits the Temple, he shall salute the Hierophant's Throne when within the Portal. <105> THE SYMBOLISM OF THE OPENING OF THE @ = GRADE OF NEOPHYTE The Opening Ceremony begins with the Cry of the 'Watcher Within\" who should come to the right front of Hierophant and raise his Wand. This"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"Enterer of the Threshold Symbol of the Ray of the Divine Light from the White Triangle of the Three Supernals thus descends into the Darkness and warns the Evil and un- initiated to retire, so that the White Triangle may be formulated upon the Altar through the combined effect of the formulae of the Opening Cere- mony. Having done this, he sees that the Entrance is properly guarded. And then the Hierophant calls to the Hiereus to test the members by the Signs, the knowledge of which shows that they, though in the Land of Blindness and Ignorance, have yet seen that Triangle of Divine Light from the Three Super- nals formulated in Darkness. It is then noted that the names of the three chief Officers begin with the Letter of Breath the Coptic 8 . In the name of Osiris the 8 is mute, and silent, and concealed, as it were, by 'H' the Eta. In the name Horus, it is manifest and violently aspirated, while in the name Thmaest, it is partly one and partly the other, for it is compounded with the Letter IT' in 0. (H \"Ae\" is attributed to Chesed - Q, to Aries, and to Earth and Saturn. This is intended to affirm the Unknown Life, which is Inspired from the Beyond, sent out to Aries, the commencement of the Spring of the year, the Life which after being Inspired, is breathed forth again; and also the pos- sible use of that Breath, between the Inspiration and the Expiration, in the combination between it and the Forces of the Microcosm.) <106> The whole is a rehearsal of the properties of the reflection of the Element Air down through the Middle Pillar of the Sephiroth, rep- resenting the reflection of the Air from Kether, through Tiphareth to Yesod, and even to the Citrine part of Malkuth. For the subtle Aether is, in Kether, inspired from the Divine Light beyond; thence reflected into Tiphareth, wherein it is combined with the Reflexes from the Alchemical Principles in that great Receptacle of the Forces of the Tree. In Yesod, it affirms the founda- tion of a formula and from Malkuth it is breathed forth or reflected back. And this formula the Adept can use. Standing in his Sphere of Sensation he can, by his knowledge of the Sacred Rites, raise himself unto the contem- plation of Yechidah and from thence aspire (in the sense of Adspire, i.e., to attract towards you in breathing) downwards into himself the Lower Genius as though temporarily to inhabit himself as its Temple. Another formula of Vibration is here hidden. Let the Adept, standing upright, his arms stretched out in the form of a Calvary Cross, vibrate a Divine Name, bringing with the formulation thereof a deep inspiration into his lungs. Let him retain the breath, mentally pronouncing the Name in his Heart, so as to combine it with the forces he desires to awake thereby; thence sending it downwards through his body past Yesod, but not resting there, but taking his physical life for a material basis, send it on into his feet. There he shall again momentarily formulate the Name - then, bringing it rushing upwards into the lungs, thence shall he breathe it forth strongly, while vibrat- ing that Divine Name. He will send his breath steadily forward into the Universe so as to awake the corresponding forces of the Name in the Outer World. Standing with arms out in the form of a Cross, when the breath has been imaginatively sent to the feet and back, bring the arms forward in \"The"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"346 The Golden Dawn: Volume III Book Five Sign of the Enterer\" while vibrating the Name out into the Universe. On com- pleting this, make the \"Sign of Silence\" and remain still, contemplating the Force you have invoked. <107> This is the secret traditional mode of pronouncing the Divine Names by vibration, but let the Adept beware that he applies it only to the Divine Names of the Gods. If he does this thing ignorantly in working with Elemental or Demonic Names, he may bring into himself terrible forces of Evil and Obsession. The Method described is called \"The Vibratory Formula of the Middle Pillar.\" After noting the Names of the Three Chief Officers, comes the re- capitulation of the Stations and duties of the Officers, thus occultly affirming the establishment of the Temple so that the Divine Light may shine into the Darkness. Then follows the purification and consecration of the Hall by Water and by Fire, thus marking the limitation of the Four Cardinal Points at the Four Quarters, and the Equation of the Elements. This is the Baptism of the Place and, as it were, the Preparation of a fitting Shrine for the Forces of the Divine Light. While all this goes forward, especially after the Hiero- phant's \"for by Names and Images are all powers awakened and re- awakened,\" the Officers become clothed in their God-forms and the In- visible Stations awake. The Procession of Officers is then formed in the North in readiness for the \"Mystic Circumambulation in the Path of Light\" (that is to say, none of the partakers is hood-winked). It is formed in the North, beginning from the Sta- tion of Stolistes, the symbol of the Waters of Creation attracting the Divine Spirit, and therefore alluding to the Creation of the World by the Spirit and the Waters. The Mystic Reverse Circumambulation forms its Procession in the South, beginning from the Station of Dadouchos, as symbolic of the End- ing and Judgment of the World by Fire. But also, the Mystic Circurnambula- tion commences by the Paths of Shin and Resh, as though bringing into action the Solar Fire; while the Reverse Circumambulation commences beside those of Qoph and Tzaddi as though bringing the Watery Reflux into action. <108> The Order of the Mystic Ciramambulation. First comes Anubis, the Watcher within; next Thmaest, the Goddess of the Hall of Truth; then Horus; then the Goddesses of the Scales of the Balance, then Members, if the Hall be large enough, and at the end the Watcher Without, Sentinel. It is as though a gigantic Wheel were revolving, as it is said: \"One Wheel upon Earth beside the Kerub.\" The Name of the Sphere of the Primum Mobile, Rashith ha-Gilgalim, sigrufies the heads or beginnings of Whirling Motions or Revolutions. Of this Wheel in the Mystic Circumambulation, the ascend- ing side begins from below the Pillar of Nephthys, and the descending side from below the Pillar of Isis; but in the Reverse Circumambulation, the contrary. Now the nave or axis of this Wheel is about the Invisible Station of Har- pocrates - as though that God, in the Sign of Silence were there placed affhnhg the Concealment of that Central Atom of the Wheel, which alone revolves not. The Mystic Circurnambulation is called symbolic of the Rise of Light and"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"Enterer of the Threshold 347 from it is drawn another formula for the circulation of the breath. It is the formula of the Four Revolutions of the Breath (not, of course, of the actual air inspired, but of the subtle Aethers which may be drawn thence and of which it is the Vehicle - the aethers which awaken centres in the subtle body through the formula). This formula should be preceded by that of the Middle Pillar, described previously. By this method, having invoked the Power you wish to awaken in yourself, and contemplated it, begin its circumambulation thus: Fill the lungs and imagine the Name vibrating in the contained Air. Imagine this vibration going down the left leg to the sole of the left foot - thence passing over to the sole of the right foot - up the right leg to the lungs again, whence it is out-breathed. Do this four times to the rhythm of the Four- fold breath. (Note: In this connection read very carefully the section <109> in Volume 4, entitled The Four Serpent Formuhe of the Four Aces of the Tarot. Some hint may be there gleaned of the relation of the breath to the Macrocosmic forces.-I.R.) The Object of the Mystic Circumambulation is to attract and make the connection between the Divine Light above and the Temple. Therefore the Hierophant does not quit his post to take part therein, but remains there to attract by his Sceptre the Light from beyond the Veil. Each member in pass- ing gives the Sign of the Enterer, thus projecting the Light forward on his Path from East to West, as he receives it from the Hierophant's Throne. Horns passes only once, for he is the Son of Osiris and inherits the Light by birthright from him. Therefore he goes at once to his station to fix the Light there. Thmaest, the Goddess of Truth, passes twice because her rule is of the Balance of the Two Scales, and she retires to her Station between the Pillars there to complete the reflex of the Middle Column. The Watcher Within and the rest circumambulate thrice as affirming the completion of the Reflection of the Perfecting of the White Triangle of the Three Supernals upon the Altar. Then follows the Adoration of God, the Vast One, the Lord of the Universe - at which again all give the Sign of the Enterer, the Sign of the Pro- jection of the Force of the Light. Then only does the Watcher declare that the Sun has arisen and that the Light shineth in Darkness. Now comes the Battery of the @ = Grade - the single knock of Hierophant repeated by Hiereus and Hegemon. This affirms the establishment of the White Triangle and therefore the Completion of the Opening Ceremony. The Mystic Words \"Khabs Am Pekht\" which accompany the knocks seal the image of the Light. Their significance implies, by various Qabalistic methods of analysis, as well as by a certain reading of the Coptic and Egyptian hieroglyphics, \"Light in Extension\" or \"May Light be extended in Abundance upon you.\" < 110> Konx Om Pax is the Greek corrupted pronunciation of this, put here to link it with its right origin. The Grade of Neophyte has 0 or the Circle for its Number, as if hiding all things under the negative symbol.

Visible Stations. 2. Invisible Stations. The Visible Stations are the places of the Officers, each of whom has a special astral shape suitable to the forces he represents. On the dais are places for the Three Chiefs, the Past Hierophant and the Hierophant. The order in which they sit (as you face East) is: Imperator-Nephthys Cancellarius-Thoth Hierophant-Osiris Past Hiero.-Aroueris Praemonstrator-Isis The names below are those of the God-forms they represent. The following are the descriptions of the God-forms of the seven Officers of the Neophyte Grade. Hierophant: Osiris in the Netherland. Expounder of the Mysteries in the Hall of the Dual Manifestation of the Goddess of Truth. Hierophant is represented by two God-forms, the Passive and active aspects of Osiris. Seated on the Dais as Hierophant, he is clothed in the God- form of Osiris. He wears the tall white crown of the South flanked by feathers striped white and blue. His face is green, the eyes blue, and from his chin hangs the royal beard of authority and judgment, blue in colour and gold tipped. He wears a collar in bands of red, blue, yellow, and black - <117> and on his back is a bundle strapped across his chest by scarlet bands. He is in mummy wrappings to the feet, but his hands are free to hold a golden Phoenix Wand, a Blue Crook and Red Scourge. The hands are green. His feet rest on a pavement of black and white. The God-form of Osiris never moves from the Dais. When the Hiero- phant has to move from the Dais, he is covered by the form of Osiris in action - Aroueris, which is built up by the Past Hierophant, seated on Hiero- phant's left. If no one is seated as Past Hierophant, then inner Members help the Hierophant to formulate the second God-form. Aroueris, Horus the Elder, is very lively to look upon - like pure flames. He wears the Double Crown of Egypt, the cone shaped crown in red inside the white crown of the North, with a white plume. His nemyss is purple banded with gold at the edges. His face and body are translucent scarlet. He has green eyes and wears a purple beard of authority. He wears a yellow tunic with a waist cloth of yellow striped with purple, from which depends a lion's tail. In common with all Egyptian Gods, he has a white linen kilt show- ing like an apron under the coloured waist cloth. His armlets and anklets are of gold. He carries in his right hand, a blue Phoenix Wand and in his left, a blue Ankh. He stands on a pavement of purple and gold."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"Enterer of the Threshold Hiereus: Horns in the Abode of Blindness unto and Ignorance of the Higher. Avenger of the Gods. He wears the Double Crown of the South and North, red and white, over a nemyss of scarlet banded with emerald green. His face is that of a lively hawk - tawny and black with bright piercing eyes, his throat is white. His body, like that of Aroueris, is entirely scarlet. He wears collar, annlets, and anklets of emerald; a waist cloth of emerald striped red, from which depends a lion's tail and he carries in his right hand an Emerald Phoenix Wand, and in his left a blue Ankh. He stands on a pavement of emerald and scarlet. <118> Hegemon: Thmaa-Est \"Before the Face of the Gods in the Place of the Threshold.\" Thmaa-est wears a black nemyss bound at the brow with a purple band from which rises, in front, a tall ostrich feather of green striped with red in equal bands. She wears a banded collar of red, yellow, blue and black. Her tunic is emerald green reaching to the feet where it is banded to match the collar. She has purple and green shoulder straps and a purple girdle also bor- dered in the colours mentioned above. Her face and body are natural colour-i.e., a light Egyptian red-brown. She wears armlets of emerald and red, and carries a combined form of Lotus and Phoenix Wand. It has an orange flower - a blue stem, and ends in an orange Sign of the Binary. In her left hand she carries a blue Ankh, and she stands on a pavement of yellow and purple, bordered with blocks of red, blue, yellow, black, in succes- sion. Kerux: Anubis of the East. Watcher of the Gods. Anubis has the head of a black jackal, very alert, pointed ears well prick- ed up. His nemyss is purple banded with white; he wears a collar of yellow and purple bands, and a tunic of yellow flecked with tufts of black hair. His body is red. His waist cloth is yellow striped with purple and from it hangs a lion's tail. His ornaments are purple and gold; his Phoenix Wand and Ankh, blue. He stands on a pavement of purple and yellow. Stolistes: Auramo-00th. \"The Light shining through the Waters upon Earth.\" \"Goddess of the Scales of the Balance at the Black Pillar.\" Auramo-00th is mainly in blue. Her face and body are natural. She wears a blue Crown of the North from which springs a delicate gold plume, over a Vulture head-dress of orange and blue. Her collar is orange and blue, she carries a blue Ankh and a Lotus Wand, having an orange lotus on a green stem. Her plain blue tunic reaches to the feet. She stands on black <119> Dadouchos: Thaurn-Aesch-Niaeth. \"Perfection through Fire mani- festing on Earth.\" \"Goddess of the Scales of the Balance at the White Pillar.\" Thaum-aesch is mainly in red. Her face and body are natural. She wears a red Crown of the South, flanked by two feathers in green barred black, over a vulture head-dress in red and green. Her collar is red and greenand she car- ries a green Ankh and a Lotus Wand with a red flower and a green stem. Her simple red tunic reaches to the feet and she stands on black."},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"356 The Golden Dawn: Volume 111 Book Five Sentinel: Anubis of the West. His form is the same as that of Kerux but his nemyss, ornaments, and dress are black and white. He has a lion's tail and carries a black Phoenix Wand and Ankh. He stand on black. (Note: If the reader, who is interested, will consult some such text as The Gods of the Egyptians by Sir E. Wallis Budge, he will find pictures of the gods referred to. He would be well-advised to make his own tracings or drawings of them with colour as directed by these instructions.-I.R.) THE THREE CHIEFS Imperator: Nephthys Nephthys has a face and body of translucent gold. She is crowned with a Cap over a vulture head-dress of black and white, the vulture head being red. Her collar and ornaments are black and white, and she wears a black robe to the feet. It is bordered in black and white. She carries a blue Ankh and a Lotus Wand with a green flower and a blue stem. She stands on black and white pavement. Praemonstrator: Isis. Isis has a face and body of translucent gold. She is crowned with a Throne over a vulture head-dress of blue and orange. The vulture <120> head is red. Her robe is of blue bordered with gold. Her ornaments are blue and orange, and she carries a blue Ankh and a Lotus wand with a green flower and a blue stem. She stands on blue and orange. Cancellarius: Tho-0th. The God-form of Thoth is built up by the Cancellarius or the officer seated on the right of Hierophant. This is his visible station, but during a Neophyte Grade, he also has an invisible station in the East while the Obliga- tion takes place. He has an Ibis head, black beak and white throat. His nemyss is yellow bordered with mauve. His collar yellow with a middle band of squares in mauve and green. His tunic is mauve with yellow stripes, and he has a lion's tail. His limbs are natural colour, his ornaments are red and green. He carries a blue Ankh, and a stylus and writing tablet. He stands on mauve and yellow. THE INVISIBLE STATIONS These fall naturally into four groups given below in order of their importance. 1. Stations in the Path Samekh in the Middle Pillar - Hathor - Har- parkrat - Evil Persona. 2. Kerubim. 3. Children of Horus. 4. The Forty-'Itvo Assessors. 1. Hathor: This Great Goddess formulates behind Hierophant in the East. Her face and limbs are of translucent gold. She wears a scarlet Sun Disc, resting between black horns from the back of which rise two feathers in white, barred blue. She has a black nemyss - a collar of blue, red, blue; and blue bands which support her robe of orange, bordered with blue and red."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"Enterer of the Threshold 357 Her ornaments are blue and orange. She carries a blue Ankh and a Lotus Wand with a green flower and a blue stem. She stands on black bordered with blue. <121> Harparkrat: He formulates in the centre of the Hall between Hegemon and the Altar, where he sits or stands on a Lotus, facing East. His face and body are translucent emerald green. He has blue eyes, and a curl of blue hair, denoting youth, comes round his face on the right side. He wears the double crown, red and white. His collar is yellow and blue; his waist cloth is yellow and blue with a mauve girdle, whence depends a lion's tail. His Lotus has leaves alternately blue and yellowland rests on a pavement of mauve and orange. He has no insignia. His left forefinger is on his lips. Omoo-Sathan. Typhon, Apophis, Set. The Evil Persona is a composite figure of the powers arising from the Qlippoth. It rises from the base of the Altar standing East of the Altar facing West, in the Sign of Typhon. He is black, and has an animal, somewhat lizard-like, head, a black body, and tail, and he stands on black. His nemyss is of olive green decorated with russet, his collar of russet and citrine. He has a white apron and a waist cloth of dull red striped with russet. He has no ornaments. 2. The Kerubim. The Kerub of Air is formed behind~athor and she is a power of Hathor, and has the same general colouring. She has a young girl's countenance and behind her are spread large and shadowing wings. The Kerub of Fire is in the South beyond the seat of Dadouchos. It is a power of the Great Goddess Tharpesh, and has the face and form of a Lion with large and clashing wings. The colouring is very lively and flashing Leo green with ruby and flame-blue and Emerald green. The Kerub of Water is formed behind Hiereus and is a power of the Great God Toum or Tmu. It has the face and form of a great Eagle with large and glistening wings. The colours are mostly blue and orange with some green. <122> TheKerub ofEarth isin the North behind the Seat of Stolistes. It is a power of the Great God Ahapshi and has the face and form of a Bull with heavy darkening wings, and the colours are black, green, red, with some white. These forms are not described in detail. We are to imagine them there as great stabilising forces whose forms vary according to circumstances. 3. The Children of Horus. These have their invisible stations in the cor- ners of the Hall. They are the guardians of the viscera of the human being - every part of whom comes up for judgment in its right time and place. Ameshet: The man-faced is in the North East. He has a blue nemyss band- ed with red, blue and black. His face is red and he has a black ceremonial beard. Round the shoulders of his white mummy shape are bands of red, blue and black, three times repeated. He stands on red, blue and black with a border of green, white and yellow. Tmoomathaph, the Jackal-faced, is in the South East. He has a black face with yellow linings to his pointed ears. He wears a blue nemyss with borders of black, yellow and blue - the same colours apprearing threefold at his"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"358 The Golden Dawn: Volume Ill Book Five shoulders. He has a white mummy shape and stands on blue, yellow and black, with a border of green, yellow, mauve. Kabexnuv: The Hawk-faced, is in the North West. He has a black and tawny face, and a nemyss of black bordered with red, yellow, black. The same colours appear three fold, at his shoulders. He has a white mummy shape and stands on red, yellow, and black with a border of green, mauve, white. Ahepi: The Ape-faced, is in the South West. He has a blue nemyss bor- dered with red, blue and yellow bands. These colours appear on his <123> shoulders in the same order. His face is red; and he stands on red, blue, and yellow, with a border of green, orange, and mauve. Note: Tmoomathaph is sometimes written Duamutef. Kabexnuv is sometimes written Qebhsenef. Ahephi is sometimes written Hapi. Ameshet is sometimes written Mesti. 4. The Forty-Two Assessors. These are not described at all save to say that they make the Sign of the Enterer as the Candidate is passed by them. They are Witnesses in the Judgment Hall of Osiris. <124> THE CANOPIC GODS THE SYMBOLISM OF THE FOUR GENII OF THE HALL OF THE NEOPHYTES By G. H. FRATRE Sub Spe In a Temple of the Grade of Neophyte, the Four Gods, Ameshet, Ahephi, Tmoumathaph, Kabexnuf, said also to be Vice-gerants of the Ele- ments, and answering to the Rivers of Eden as drawn in the Warrant of the Temple, are said to rule in the four Comers of the Hall between the Stations of the Kerubim. In Egyptian Mythology, these Gods are also said to be the Children of Horus, and to partake of his symbology. If now, we regard the Neophyte Ceremony as representing the entrance into a new life, Regeneration -Mors Janua Vitae - the Egyptian symbology wherein that idea was so clearly and exactly worked out becomes important. Bear in mind that a new life means a new plane or a higher world, a passing, say, from the Kether of Assiah to the Malkuth of Yetzirah. Now as behind Kether depend the Veils of the Negative Existence: Ain, Ain Soph and Ain Soph Aour, so through Negative Existence must pass the Soul that goes from Assiah to Yetzirah, or vice-versa. This process is illus- trated by the Neophyte Ceremony as described in 2-3., and as seen by the clairvoyant eye. In Egyptian mythology, the Dead, when the Ceremonies are complete, the Soul weighed and passed, the Body mummied and preserved from corruption, became one with Osiris, and is called an Osirian. Hence, the Hierophant, who represents Osiris when the Candidate is placed in the North, speaks to him in the character of his Higher Soul - \"The Voice of my undying and Secret Soul said unto me\" etc.. Osiris, however, is a mummied form, and the body of the Egyptian dead was mummied at this part of the Ceremony. Let us now consider the"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"Enterer of the Threshold 359 <125> nature of the body which is mummied. The body itself may be con- sidered as a vehicle whereby the life forces act, and the medium whereby these life-forces act is what are termed the Vital organs. Withdraw or destroy any of these, and the life ceases to function in that body. Not less important, then, than the body itself, the vehicle of the Soul, are the Organs, the media for the action of organic life, and it is equally important to preserve these from corruption, yet not together with the body. For as the body of Osiris was broken up, so must the body of the Osirian be divided. This is the meaning of the viscera being preserved apart from the body. The death and resurrection of Christ has other symbology and the teachings belong to a higher Grade. Let none therefore object that His Body was laid in the Tomb entire. (The Body of Osiris was first laid in the Chest or Pastos whole. The division into 14 parts was subsequent. N. B. 1 plus 4 = 5, the five wounds.) For even as Yod Heh Vav Heh must be known before Yod Heh Shin Vav Heh can be comprehended, and as Moses must precede Christ, so must the Mysteries of Osiris first be known. Now the Guardian of the Hall and of the Neophytes against the Qlip poth (whose Kether is Thaumiel, the Dual or Two-headed One, the Demons of Corruption and disintegration) is the Hiereus or Horns, and to the Chil- dren of Horns, who partake of his symbology, are the viscera committed, to guard them against the demons of disintegration and corruption. As the elements and the forces of the Elements are to the world, so are the vital organs and the Life which animates them to the human body. Appropriately, then, are the vital organs and the life which animates them, placed under the charge of the Vice-gerents of the Elements, the Children of Horns, the Great Gods Ameshet, Ahephi, Tmoumathaph and Kabexnuf, who regulate their functions in material life, and guard them after so-called death, when the man that was has become an Osirian. Consider then, what are these vital organs and their functions. < 126> Broadly they may be divided into the alimentary system and the cir- culatory system, for in this classification we take no account of the brain or reproductive organs which belong to another classification, and are not Elemental nor concerned in the maintenance of the life of the mate- rial body. Each of these divisions may be further divided into that which divides or distributes to the body - that which is needed for life, and that which casts out from the body and renders to the Qlippoth that which is unnecessary or pernicious. From this arises a four-fold division as in the following dia- gram: A. C. { Powers that divide Alimentary and distribute 1 Circulatory System System Powers that cast out B. D."},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"360 The Golden Dawn: Volume 111 Book Five With this Key, the division becomes easy, for in the Alimentary System, the stomach and the upper intestines divide the food taken into the system by a process called digestion, and by assimilation retain what is necessary. This therefore is \"Fin the diagram. But the lower intestines receive and cast out that which is rejected, these therefore will be represented by \"B\". In the circulatory system, the heart is the organ which distributes the blood which it receives washed and purified by the lungs. Hence the lungs and heart are represented by \"C\". The matter rejected from the circulatory system is reject- ed and cast forth by the liver and gall-bladder, which therefore will be rep- resented by \"D\". Now as to the treatment of these vital organs in the process of mum- mification. Seeing that during life they were under the guardianship of the Great Gods mentioned, so in death they were dedicated each to one <127> of these, who were the four Genii of the Under-world, or the Lesser Gods of the Dead. These vital organs then, being taken out and separately embalmed, were placed in egg-shaped receptacles, symbolic of Akasa, under the care of Canopus, the Pilot of Menelaus, and the God of the Waters of Creation, the Eternal Source of Being, whose symbol was a jar; and under the especial pro- tection of that one of the Genii of the Underworld or Vice-gerents of the Elements to whom that particular organ was dedicated. Hence each egg- shaped package was enclosed in a jar whose lid was shaped like the head of that especial God. Now Arneshet was also termed \"The Carpenter\" for he it is who by the medium of his organ, the Stomach, frames the rough materials and builds up the structure of the body; to him the Stomach and Upper Intestines were dedicated (A). Ahephi was also termed \"The Digger\" or \"Burier\" for he puts out of sight or removes that which is useless or offensive in the body, and to him the Lower Intestines or Bowels were dedicated (B). Tmoumathph was also called \"The Cutter\" or \"Divider\" for he divides and distributes the blood bearing with it the Pram and the Subtle Ether by the Holy Science of Breath brought into the body, and to him were the lungs or heart dedicated (C). Kabexnuf was termed \"The Bleeder\" for as a stream of blood is drawn from the body, so is a stream of impurity drawn from the blood, and cast out into the draught by the action of the Liver and Gall-Bladder, and to him therefore, these organs were dedicated (D). These jars were called Canopic Jars and were disposed in a certain order round the Mummy. Consider now, the points of the compass to which they would naturally be attributed. Reason itself will insist that the organs of the Alimentary System, the most material and earthy, should be in the North, and the warm and vital heat of the Circulatory System should be to < 128> the South, while in the cross division, the Receptive and distributive organs should be placed to the East, the source of Life and Lightland the organs that purify and cast out should be to the West that borders on the Qlippoth. This gives us the following arrangement:"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"Enterer of the Threshold East Yet this arrangement, would, as it were, symbolise the entire separation of the Alimentary System and the Circulatory System, which is contrary to Nature, for they continually counter-change, and thus arises Life. Wherefore in the Hall of the Two Truths, the portions of Ahephi and Kabexnuf are reversed, and the order becomes. East-Ameshet. South-Tmoumathph North-Kabexnuf West-Ahephi Now these, being thus arranged, do partake of the symbology of the elements to which they belong. For Ameshet being to the East, the quarter of Air, has the head of a Man. Tmoumathph, to the South, has the head of a Jac- kal who is the purveyor of the Lion, (for these are the Vice-Gerents of the Elements, while the Kerubim are the Lords thereof); so Tmoumathph is properly a jackal. Kabexnuf in the West, in the region of Water, has the form of a Hawk, the subordinate form to the Alchemic Eagle of Distillation, and the form also, of Horus, the Hiereus, beside whom is his station, and of whose symbology he partakes. <129> Ahephi in the North,has the head of an Ape. The symbology of the Ape in Ancient Egypt is very complex. Here it may be taken that while Apis, the Bull, represents the Divine Strength of the Eternal Gods, the Ape represents the Elemental Strength which is far inferior and blended with cunning. Ahephi, however, has other symbology and other attributes. For by reason of the fertilising qualities of the Nile and of the fad that what is brought down by the Nile as refuse from the Land of the Sacred Lakes is, to Egypt, its life and the source of its fertility, so there arises a correspondence between the Nile and the lower intestines, and both are under the care of Ahephi (Hapi) who thus was worshipped as Nilus, and in this connection he has for his symbol, a head-dress of Lotus Flowers. Now, further, the Alimentary System is under the special guardianship of Isis and Nephthys. Isis who conquers by the power of Wisdom and the for- ces of Nature, guards Ameshet. And Nephthys who hides that which is se- cret, guards Ahephi - whence also, until recent days, in the fulness of Time, the sacred sources of Ahephi, the Nile, were kept secret from the whole world. Tmoumathph is under the guardianship of Neith, the Dawn. This is the Celestial Space, who makes the Morning to pass and awakes the Light of a Golden Dawn in the Heart of Him whom the Eternal Gods shall choose, by the Sacred Science of the Breath.

When, therefore, the Candidate kneels at the foot of the Altar, or where the Corpse lies on the Bier preparatory to the passing over the River towards the West, and the Soul stands before Osiris, and the Goddesses stand by and watch while the Beam sways and the decision is taken - then, the <130> body of the Candidate is, as it were, broken up as the body of Osiris was broken, and the Higher Self stands before the place of the pillars, but the lower self is in the invisible station of the evil persona. Then is the Candidate nigh unto death, for then, symbolically, his Spirit passes through the Veils of the Negative Existence, passing from the Kether of Assiah to the Malkuth of Yetzirah. Therefore, unless the Genii of the Under- world were then present and directing their forces on the vital organs, he must inevitably die. Let their symbols then be represented in all operations and formulae drawn from the symbolism of the Hall of the Two Truths, for they are of the utmost importance, but as their stations are Invisible, so shall their symbols be astral and not material. Thus shall perfect health of body be preserved, which is of utmost importance in all magical working and thus shall the lessons of the Hall of the Neophytes be duly carried out in our daily life."},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"<131> Z. 3 THE SYMBOLISM OF THE ADMISSION OF THE CANDIDATE THE ADMISSION OF THE CANDIDATE The Candidate is waiting without the Portal under the care of the Sentinel - \"The Watcher Without\" - that is, under the care of the form of Anubis of the West symbolically that he may keep off the \"Dog-Faced Demons,\" the opposers of Anubis, who rise from the confines where matter ends, to deceive and drag down the Soul. The Ritual of the 31st Path says: \"Since ever dragging down the Soul and leading it from sacred things, from the confines of matter arise the terrible Dog-Faced Demons never showing a true image unto mortal gaze.\" The Hierophant gives a single knock to announce the just commence- ment of a vibration in the Sphere of Sensation of the Candidate. He then states that he holds the Dispensation from the G. H. Chiefs of the Second Order, to affirm that the effect of the ensuing Ceremony upon the Candidate is only authorised by the Higher Powers for the purpose of Initiation which shall ultimately lead to the knowledge of his Higher Self. He is admitted to the Grade of Neophyte which has no number, concealing the commence- ment of all things under the similitude of no thing. The Hegemon, the representative of the Goddess of Truth and Justice, is consequently sent to superintend the preparation, symbolising that it is the Presider of Equilibrium who is to administrate the process of Initiation, by the commencement of the forces of equilibrium in the Candidate himself, through the symbols of rectitude and self-control. But the actual <132> preparation of the Candidate should be performed by the Sentinel - the 'Watcher Without\" - to show that this preparation must be accomplished before the establishment of equilibrium can occur. Therefore, does the Hegemon superintend the preparation rather than perform it actually.A Triple Cord is bound round the body of the Neophyte, symbolising the binding and restriction of the lower nature. It is triple in reference to the White Triangle of the Three Supemals. Then, also, are the eyes bandaged to symbolise that the light of the material world is but darkness and illusion compared with the radiance of the Divine Light. The preparation also rep- resents a certain temporary binding and restriction of the natural body. The Hierophant, being a Member of the Second Order and therefore initiated into the Secret Knowledge of the symbolism, shall, together with any Officers and Members also of the Inner Order, remember what tremen- dous Gods and Goddesses they represent - the Divine Forces of the Eternal in the administration of the Universe. The Ritual should be read in a loud, clear, stem and solemn voice so as to impress the Candidate with the solem- nity of the occasion. In this, there should be no foolish nervousness or hesita- 363"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"The Golden Dawn: Volume 111 Book Five tion, but the Ritual as performed by an initiated Hierophant should become in his hands something more than this. Thus should he act. Let him remember what particular God he rep- resents. Exalting his mind unto the contemplation thereof, let him think of himself as a vast figure, standing or moving in the likeness of that God, colossal, his head lost in the clouds, with the light flashing round it from the head-dress of the God - his feet resting upon Earth in darkness, thunder and rolling clouds, and his form wrapped in flashes of lightning - the while vibrating the Name of the God. Thus standing, let him endeavour to hear the voice of the God whom he represents and of the God-Forms of the other officers as previously explained. <133> Let him speak, then, not as if unto an assembly of mortals but as to an assembly of Gods. Let his voice be so directed as to roll through the Universe to the utmost confines of space. Let the Candidate rep- resent unto him, as it were, a world whom he is beginning to lead unto the knowledge of its governing Angel. As it is written \"The lightning lighteneth out of the East and shineth even unto the West, even so, shall the coming of the Son of Man be.\" The Candidate during the Ceremony is addressed as Child of Earth, as representing the earthly or terrestrial nature of man - he who comes for- ward from the darkness of Malkuth to endeavour to regain the knowledge of the light. This is what is meant by the speech of the Hegemon, because the Path of the Initiate is but darkness and foolishness to the natural man. The single knock given by the Hegemon without the door represents the con- senting will of the natural man to receive the force formulated by the Hiero- phant, and is answered by the Kerux within as if a witness were confirming the same. This being done, the Kerux, as a witness, demands authority from the Hierophant to admit the Candidate into the Hall of Truth and Justice. The Hierophant, in granting the permission, seals the Candidate with a new name given to the physical body of the outward man, but signifying the aspirations of his Soul. As a consequence of the affirmation of the Motto as the Name of the Candidate in the hall of Truth, Osiris as once sends forward the Goddess of the Scales of the Balance to baptise him with Water and the companion Goddess to consecrate him with Fire. As it is written \"Unless a man be born of Water and of the Spirit, he shall in no wise enter the Kingdom of Heaven.\" The Kerux instantly bars the Candidate's passage to mark that though he has been admitted, the natural man of unpurified desires cannot be a dweller in the Hall of Truth. The Goddesses of the Scales immediately purify and consecrate him, which operation calls into action the forces of the <134> Pillars in his own sphere of sensation. This is the first of four conse- crations because when the Pillars of the Tree are projected onto the Sphere of Sensation there are four pillars, of which the Middle Pillar is the axis. (Note: This idea is elaborated more clearly and at greater length in the Astronomical View of the Tarot, in Book Eight, Volume 4.-I. R.) At this point of the Ceremony, the astral appearance of the Candidate is that of a form wrapped in darkness as if extinguished thereby, and having unto his right and unto his left the faint semblance of the Two Great Pillars of"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"Admission of the Candidate 3 65 Fire and of Cloud, whence issue faint rays into the Darkness which covers him. hediately above his sphere of sensation: there will appear a ray of bright light as if preparing to penetrate the darkness covering him. The result of this will be that the Candidate, during the whole of the ceremony of Admission, will usually appear to be somewhat automatic and vague. The reception and consecration take place symbolically in the darkest part of Malkuth. The moment this is finished, the Candidate is conducted to the foot of the Altar, that is under the citrine part of Malkuth which receives the impact of the Middle Column. Now, the Hegemon throughout the Ceremony acts as guide, prompter and answerer for the Candidate. His office toward the Candidate is analogous to that of his Higher Soul - wherefore also, the Hegemon holds in his hand the mitre-headed sceptre to attract, since it is the sceptre of Wisdom, the Higher Self of the Candidate. At this momemt, as the Candidate stands before the Altar, as the simulacrum of the Higher Self is attracted, so also arises the form of the Accuser in the place of the Evil Triad. This similarly attracts the simulacrum of the Evil Persona of the Candidate - and were it not for the power of the 42 lettered name in the Palaces of Yetzirah (the Gods of which name are usually called the \"Great Assessors of Judgment1') the actual evil Persona would at once formulate and be able to obsess the Ruach of the Candidate. For, seeing that at this time, the simulacrum of the Higher Soul is attracting the <135> Neschamah of the Candidate, the human will is not as powerful in the Ruach for the moment, because the Aspirant of the Mysteries is now, as it were, divided. That is, his Neschamah is directed to the contempla- tion of his Higher Self attracted by the Hegemon. His natural body is bound and blinded, his Ruach threatened by the simulacrum of the Evil Persona attracted by Omoo-Szathan, and a species of shadow of himself thrown for- ward to the place of the Pillars, where the Scales of Judgment are set. At the same time that the first consecration establishes a semblance of the Pillats to his right and left, it also has drawn forth from him a semblance of himself to the place vacated by the Hegemon between the Pillars. (That is, the cere- mony induces a species of schizophrenia so that the initiation may be effect- ed. But see Jung's Commentary to The Secret of the Golden Fher, and also my book on alchemy The Philosopher's Stone.-I. R.) Here then stands the shadow of the Candidate while the Scales of the Balance oscillate unseen. Unseen also and colossal, there is imaged before him Tho-0th) as Mettatron, in the Sign of the Enterer of the Threshold, ready, according to the decision of the human will, to permit or withhold the de- scent of the Lower Genius of the Candidate. Meanwhile, the Great Assessors of Judgment examine into the truth of the accusations formulated by the Evil and averse antithesis. The Assessors of Judgment come not under the head of invisible stations, but during the Obligation and circumambulation of the Candidate, until he is brought to the Light, they hover immediately about the limits of the Temple and their evil antithesis immediately below. Therefore, when the Candidate stands before the Altar before the Obligation, is the decision actually taken by the human will of the Candidate. Rarely in his life has he been nearer death, seeing that he is, as it were, disintegrated into his component parts. The process of sym-"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"366 The Golden Dawn: Volume ZZZ Book Five bolic judgment takes place during the speech of the Hierophant to <136> the Candidate, the answer of the Hegemon and his consent to take the Obligation. The moment the Candidate thus consents, the Hierophant advances be- tween the Pillars as if to assert that the Judgment is concluded. He ad- vances by the invisible station of Harpocrates to that of the Evil Triad, which he symbolically treads down, so that as Aroueris he stands upon the opposer. He then comes to the East of the Altar, interposing between the place of the Evil Triad and the Candidate. At the same time, the Hiereus advances on the Candidate's left, the Hegemon on his right, thus formulating about him the symbol of the Higher Triad before he places his hand upon the symbol of the Three Supernals upon the Altar. Again, before doing so, he has been bidden to kneel in adoration of that symbol, as if the natural man abrogated his will before that of the Divine Consciousness. As he kneels in the presence of the Triad of Aroueris, Thmaa-est and Horus, he places his left hand in that of his Initiator as affirming his passive reception of the Ritual, but his right hand is on the white triangle as symbolis- ing his active aspiration towards his Higher Self. His head is bowed as rep resenting the Voluntary submission of the human will to the Divine - and for this latter reason he repeats in the Obligation his name in the outer world. The Hierophant gives one knock, affirming that the submission unto the higher is perfect. Only at this moment, does the invisible and colossal figure of Tho-0th cease to be in the Sign of the Enterer and give the Sign of Silence, permitting the first real descent of the Genius of the Candidate, who de- scends to the invisible station of Harpocrates as a witness of the Obligation. The Hiereus and the Hierophant return to their Thrones, and therefore it is not Aroueris, but Osiris himself that addresses the speech to the Can- didate - 'The Voice of my Higher Self,\" etc., which confirms the link established between the Neschamah and the Genius by formulat- <137> ing the conception thereof into the Ruach. For this, Osiris speaks in the character of the Higher Soul, the symbolic form of which is standing between the columns before him. The affirmation of the Higher Soul as the God of the man does not mean that this is the only God, but rather that it is the only presentment of him which the natural man can grasp at all. Neither is it just to say that the Higher Soul is one with God, seeing that the part is by no means the whole, nor can the whole be accurately and sufficient- ly described as an assemblage of parts. Let not the reverence for the God of thy self cause thee by a misconception to lose thy reverence for the Gods who live for ever - the Aeons of Infinite Years. Herein is a great error and one which may, in its ultimatum bring about the fall of the Genius, a sin which entails none the less terrible consequences because it is a sign of the higher plane where the choice is not between good and evil but between the higher and the lower forms of good. Therefore is the Mystic Circurnambulation in the Path of Darkness led by the Kerux with the symbolic light, as formulating that the Higher Soul is not the only Divine Light but rather a spark from the Ineffable Flame - and the Kerux, in his turn, is but the Watcher of the Gods. After the Kerux comes"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"Admission of the Candidate 367 the Hegemon, the translator of the Higher Self, leading the Candidate; and then come the Goddesses of the Scales of the Balance, the Stolistes and the Dadouchos. They move once round; the formation in darkness of the Binah angle of the White Triangle of the Three Supernals. The Hierophant knocks once as they pass him in affirmation of Mercy - the Hiereus in affirmation of Severity; and the invisible Assessors each give the Sign of the Enterer as the Candidate passes on his way. At the second passing of the Hierophant, the knock affirms the commencement of the angle of Chokmah. The Kerux bars the Candidate's approach to the West to mark that the natural man cannot obtain the understanding of even the Son of Osiris unless by purification and equilibrium. Again is the Candidate <138> purified and consecrated, the Pillars about his Sphere of Sensation being rendered more manifest. After this second consecration, the Candidate is allowed to approach the place ofl'The Twilight of the Gods\" and for a brief space the hood-wink is slipped up, to present a glimpse, but a glimpse only, of the Beyond. In the challenge of the Hiereus to know the Name is signified the knowledge of the formula. For if the formula of Horus be not with the Candidate, that of Osiris cannot be grasped. But to the Can- didate the power of Horus as yet can only appear as a terrible and incom- prehensible force - \"The Force of the Avenger of the Gods\", whence the speech of the Hegemon for him. The Candidate cannot as yet comprehend that before Mildness can be exercised rightly, the forces of Severity and Mercy must be known and wielded, but to accomplish this the greatest courage and energy is required and not hysterical weakness and absence of resolution in action. Hence in the answer of the Hiereus is an affirmation of the necessity of courage and of the danger of fear, and he gives one knock to seal the vibration of that force imaged in the Candidate's sphere of sensa- tion. The next barring and consecration of the Candidate is an extension of the previous one and the commencement of the formulation of the angle of Kether. The hood-wink is again slipped up giving a still further glimpse of the nature of the Divine Light, though to the mind of the Candidate, an imperfect one. Therefore it is to him, as expressed in the answer of the Hegemon, a light dimly seen through the Darkness, yet heralding a Glory beyond. The speech of the Hierophant formulates the forces of the hidden central pillar. After this, the Candidate passes to the Altar of the Universe, which receives the influences of the three Pillars, as though then the Ray from the Divine would descend into the darkness of the mind, for then, but not till then, is he fitted to realise what are the first things necessary to the \"Search for the Shining Light.\" <139> The Hierophant now leaves his Throne and passes between the Pillars, either halting there during the prayer or halting at the places of Harpocrates, or that of the Evil Triad, or East of the Altar. It does not particularly matter which, but one of them may seem more appropriate to a particular candidate than another and the Hierophant will usually find that he halts at the right place instinctively. The Hiereus stands on the left of the Candidate, the Hegemon on his right, thus forming the Triad of the Supernals. The Kerux, Stolistes and"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"368 The Golden Dawn: Volume III Book Five Dadouchos represent an inferior and supporting Triad behind him as if they affirmed that he has passed the Judgment of the Balance. It is best, though not absolutely necessary, that the Hierophant and the Hiereus should hold their Banners. In any case, it should be done astrally. The Higher Self of the Candidate will be formulated in the invisible sta- tion of Harpocrates behind the Hierophant, who in his present position is Aroueris. The Hierophant gives a single knock to seal the matter and then invokes the Lord of the Universe. Then only is the hood-wink removed definitely. The Hierophant, Hiereus, and Hegemon join sceptres and sword above the Candidate's head, thus formulating the Supernal Triad, and assert his reception into the Order. They recite the mystic words to seal the current of the Flowing Light. The Higher Self remains in the station of Harpocrates, and at this point, the spirit-vision should see a gleaming white triangle formulated over the Candidate's head. The Hierophant now calls forward the Kerux, cautioning the Candidate that the Light has preceded him without his knowledge. It represents to him here, a vague formulation of ideas which as yet he can neither grasp nor analyse. This Light is not a symbol of his Higher Self, but a Ray from the Gods to lead him thereto. Only after having thus been brought to the Light is the Can- <140> didate led to the East of the Altar - the place of the station of the Evil Triad - to affirm that with this Light he will be able to cast out and trample on his own Evil Persona which, when it has been put in its place, will then become a support to him. It is to the Hiereus, \"The Avenger of the Gods\" therefore, that the duty of entrusting the Candidate with the secret signs, etc., is delegated. It is he who places him for the first time between the Pillars and superintends his final consecration - thus bringing the peculiar force in matter of the Hiereus to the aid of the Candidate, so that he may more safely and resolutely combat the temptations of the Evil Persona. The Hierophant has returned to his Throne while the Hegemon holds the insignia of the Hiereus while he confers the Signs, etc. She thus affirms the necessity of the force represented by the Hiereus to the Candidate. The Hierophant on the Throne, the Hiereus East of the Black Pillar and the Hegemon East of the White Pillar again form a Triad which here rep- resents the reflection of the Three Supernals. The Higher Soul is formulated between the Pillars in the Place of Equilibrium. The Candidate is in the place of the Evil Triad and the Hiereus now advances to the place of Harpocrates between the Pillars to give the words. After the giving of the words and signs, the Hiereus draws the Can- didate forward between the Pillars and for the second time in the Ceremony, the Higher Soul stands near and ready to touch him. The Hiereus returns to his place East of the Black Pillar so that the Three Chief Officers may formu- late and draw down to the Candidate, by their insignia, and the influence of their symbols, the forces of the Supernal Triad. It is important, therefore, that at this point, they should be in these places. The Candidate now stands between the Pillars, bound with a rope lie"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"Admission of the Candidate 3 69 the mummied form of Osiris, between Isis and Nephthys. The final Conse- cration now takes place by the Goddesses of the Scales of the <141> Balance. The Candidate stands for the first time during the Cere- mony at the point representing the equilibrium of the balance. Meanwhile, the Kerux goes to the North, ready for the circumambulation so as to link that with the final Consecration of the Candidate. The final Conse- cration is also demanded by the Hiereus - Horns, the powerful Avenger of Osiris, as still menacing the Evil Persona of the Candidate. Its effect is to seal finally, in balanced formation, the Four Pillars in the Sphere of Sensation of the Candidate. This does not imply that they were not naturally there before. But in the natural man, the symbols are unbalanced in strength - some being weaker and some stronger. The effect of the Ceremony is to strengthen the weak, to punfy the strong, and so begin to equilibriate them and at the same time make a link between them and the corresponding forces of the Macrocosm. This being done, the Hierophant commands the removal of the Rope which has hitherto been purposely retained, symbolically to restrain the actions of the natural man, whose temptation is towards the Evil Persona. The Four Pillars being thus firmly established, the Candidate is invested with the Badge of the White Triangle of the Three Supernals formulating in Darkness. Now, also, the Higher Self is enabled in reality to form a link with him, if the human will of the natural man be in reality consenting thereto. The free-will of the natural man is never obsessed either by the Higher Soul or by the Ceremony, but, the will consenting, the whole of the Ceremony is directed to strengthening its action. As the badge is placed upon him, it is as if the two Great Goddesses, Isis and Nephthys, stretched forth their wings over Osiris to re- store him again to life. The Mystic Circurnambulation follows in the Path of Light to represent the rising of Light in the Candidate, through the operation of self-sacrifice. As he passes the Hierophant's throne the red Calvary Cross is astrally formed above the astral White Triangle on his fore-head, so that so long as <142> he belongs to the Order, he may bear that potent and sublime sym- bol as a link with his Higher Self and as an aid in searching out the forces of the Divine Light - if he will. The Higher Soul or Genius now returns to the invisible station of Har- pocrates, the place of the hidden Centre, yet continuing to retain the link formed with the Candidate. The address of the Hierophant is intended sim- ply to effect the distinct formulation of the symbols of the @ = Grade of Neophyte in the Candidate, and it is therefore only when this is finished that the Watcher Anubis announces that the Candidate has been duly admitted as an initiated Neophyte. The Hiereus is charged with a warning address as again confirming the will of the Candidate and addressing a final menace to the Evil Persona. The Hierophant then states clearly what the Candidate must begin to study. He affirms that the symbols must be equilibriated in the sphere of sensation before a link can be formulated between them and the Forces of the Mac- rocosm. The necessity of examination is insisted upon so that this may be completely done."},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"3 70 The Golden Dawn: Volume 111 Book Five The Kerux then pours out the two fluids to make the semblance of blood. This is to fix in the Candidate's sphere the symbols of the forces of transmutation in Nature and also to make an astral link between these and the Candidate's physical life, as a guard of the secrecy of the Mysteries. This particular form of transmutation is used as showing the effect of a mixture of forces as producing a third appearance totally different from them. The red colour is symbolic of the blood of the Candidate. In the Ancient Mysteries, the Candidate's blood was actually drawn at this time and preserved as an avenging link in case of his proving unworthy. Our transmutation effects the matter quite as well, seeing that the astral link is formally established. The final speech of the Hierophant is further intended besides its apparent meaning, to affirm that a person only partially initiated is neither fit- ted to teach nor to instruct even the outer and more ignorant in Sub- <143> lime Knowledge. He is certain, through misunderstanding the prin- ciples, to formulate error instead of truth. CLOSING The greater part of the closing ceremony is explained by the opening. The Reverse Circumambulation, however, is intended to formulate the withdrawal of the Light of the Supernal Triad from the Altar, so that it may not be profaned by abiding without due guard. Not that the Divine Light would suffer thereby, but because it might initiate an Avenging Current if profaned. This is what is implied by the Law of Moses in the prohibition about offering unconsecrated Fire either before or within the Veil of the Tabernacle. As a vibratory formula, the 'reverse Circumambulation rep resents the reversal of the current and the restoration of the Operator to his ordinary condition. The Mystic Repast then follows. It is a communion in the Body of Osiris. Its Mystic Name is \"The Formula of the Justified One,\" and it is sufficiently explained in the section concerning the Altar. The Kerux, in finishing, inverts the Cup, as the Watcher of the God, to show that the symbols of self-sacrifice and of regeneration are accomplished. The proclamation is confirmed by the Hierophant and the Chief Officers giv- ing the three strokes, emblematic of the Mystic Triad, and they repeat the Mystic Words. The Hierophant, in his final speech, seals the link first formulated be- tween the Members and the Supernal Triad for each one present that it may prove to him or her, a guide for the ultimate attainment of the Supreme Initia- tion - if he will. THE SYMBOLISM AND MEANING OF THE STEP, SIGNS, GRIP OR TOKEN AND THE WORDS They have this three-fold interpretation: 1. Apparent meaning. 2. Spiritual or mystical reference. 3. Practical application. <144> Each is therefore considered under three heads. The Step. (1) The foot is advanced about six inches representing the foot"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"Admission of the Candidate 3 71 on the side of Chesed put forward and taking a hesitating step in darkness - the left foot, to represent the power of Isis or the beginning of action rather than Nephthys as the end thereof. The term 6 inches is employed here only to render it more intelligible to English Initiates. It means a convenient measure of 6, and preferably 6 times the measure of the Phalanx of the thumb - Spirit and Will. 2. It symbolises the beginning of the stamping down of the Evil Persona. The foot is advanced 6 metrical distances answering to the number 6 of Tiphareth - Osiris - alluding therefore to the self-sacrifice necessary to accomplish this. 3. It represents the practical application of the beginning of a magical force. Let the Adept, in using the Sign of the Enterer, give the step as he com- mences the Sign and let him imagine himself colossal, clothed with the form of the God or Goddess appropriate to the work - his head reaching to the clouds - his feet resting upon Earth. And let him take the step as if he stamp- ed upon the Earth and the Earth quaked and rocked beneath him. As it is said \"Clouds and Darkness are round about Him - lightnings and thunders the habitation of His feet.\" Its secret name is \"The Step of the Avenger.\" THE SALUTING SIGN 1. That of groping forward in search of truth. 2. It represents the involution and bringing forward of the Light into the material to aid the will of the Candidate in his search for and aspiration towards the Higher. 3. Standing as before described, in the form of the God, and elevating the mind to the contemplation of Kether, take the step like a stroke with the foot, bring the arms up above the head as if touching the Kether, and <145> as the step is completed bring the hands over the head forwards. Thrust them out direct from the level of the eyes horizontally - arms extended, fingers straight, palms downwards, the hands directed towards the object it is wished to charge or to affect. At the same time, sink the head till the eyes look exactly between the thumbs. In this way, the rays from the eyes, from each finger and from the thumbs, must all converge upon the object attacked. If any of them disperse, it is a weakness. Thus performed, this Sign is a symbol of tremendous attacking force and of projection of willpower, and it should be employed in all cases where force of attack is required - especially in charging of Talismans and the like. Generally, it is best to have the thumbs and all the fingers extended - but if a particular effect is desired, you may extend only the fingers appropriate thereto, keeping the rest folded back in the hand. Herewith also, may be com- bined the attribution of the Planets to the head: (Mars to the right nostril, Mercury to the Mouth, etc., as explained in the Microcosm Lecture), sending at the same time an imaginary ray of colour of the Planet desired from the part of the head attributed to it. But, when finished, be careful to withdraw the rays again or they will remain like so many outlets of astral force and thus exhaust you. The best way to protect yourself against this is to give the Sign of Silence immediately. For the first Sign should always be answered by the second. The secret names of the Saluting Signs are \"The Attacking Sign\" or"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"3 72 The Golden Dawn: Volume I11 Book Five \"The Sign of the Enterer of the Threshold.\" THE SIGN OF SILENCE 1. This is simply that of secrecy regarding the Mysteries. 2. It is the affirmation of the station of Harpocrates, wherein the Higher Soul of the Candidate is formulated in part of the admission Cere- <146> mony. It is the symbol of the Centre and of the'lroice of the Silence\" which answers in secret the thought of the heart. 3. The Sign of Silence withdraws the force put out by the Sign of the Enterer. Take upon thyself as before taught the colossal form of the God Har- pocrates. Bring the left foot sharply back, both heels together - beat the ground once with the left foot as it is placed beside the right. Bring the left hand to the mouth and touch the centre of the lower lip with the left fore- finger. Close the other fingers and thumb, and drop the right hand to the side. Imagine that a watery vapor encircles and encloses you. This is the reflux of the current. This Sign is also used as a Protection against attack. The Sign represents a concentration of astral light about the person. Having given the Sign as above, it is a protection against all attack and danger of obsession. To make it yet stronger, the form of the God should be taken. If Spiritual force is required, formulate as if standing on a Lotus or rising from it. For force in con- templation and meditation, formulate as if seated upon a Lotus. But for more material force, as if standing upon a Dragon or a Serpent like some statues of Harpocrates. As a defence and protection, the Sign is as strong as the Banish- ing Pentagram, though of a different nature. And as the Sign of the Enterer represents attack, so does this sign represent defence thereto, as a shield is a defence against the Sword. From this Sign is a formula of invisibility derived. (See Ritual in Part Six.-I. R.) The Secret Names of this Sign are: \"The Sign of the God of Silence\" or the \"Sign of Defence or Protection.\" It may be performed with any finger of either hand, but it is most protective when the left forefinger is used, the Water of Chesed, for the fingers of the right hand represent more violent action, and those of the left more watery action. (If you have not a convenient implement, a Sigil or a Pentagram may be traced with any finger of any hand according to the correspondence required.) <147> It may here be remarked that the so-called Christian Sign of Benediction, consisting of the thumb and first two fingers only, pro- jected, is the affirmation of Osiris, Isis and Nephthys - or Spirit, Fire, and Water. With regard to taking on mentally the forms of the Gods, it may here be noted that the process is of great assistance and use in all magical working, whether of invocation or of evocation, contemplation, meditation, skrying in the spirit vision, alchemy, etc. For the forms of the Gods do here represent a certain symbolic material action of the Divine Forces. THE GRIP AND THE PASSWORD 1. The steps are taken and the Grip exchanged simultaneously. They mean seeking guidance in the darkness and silence of the Mysteries."},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"Admission of the Candidate 3 73 2. It shows that a steady and resolute will, acting in union with good, will accomplish what it desires, no matter how often it fail at first. It inculcates the necessity for harmony and brotherly love - of doing away with pettiness and of too much self-concentration - for allowances for the weaknesses of others within limits - of shunning resolutely anything in the nature of slan- der. So that in the grip of the Neophyte the Initiates meet hand to hand and foot to foot in the true greeting of a brother or sister, and not in the veiled hos- tility of an enemy. For, in the working of the Inner, where all invoke the same forces in the same manner, he or she becomes unsympathetic with the rest, separates himself or herself from them, and though he weaken the combina- tion of working, yet he still more certainly attracts upon himself a reflex current from the Avengers of Evil. The Name of the God of Silence which is the Grand Word of this Grade also represents the silence of the Sacred Mysteries to be observed towards the Outer Order. It shows also the necessity for respect towards the <148> secrets of any Frater or Soror committed to your care, not en- deavouring to search them out for purposes of curiosity nor repeat- ing them when discovered, nor in any way referring to them so as to wound the other, nor in any way employing them as a means of causing humiliation, but to keep them as a sacred trust and not to be deflected by them from acting justly and harmoniously together. 3. In any magical ceremony, or other working, if more than one mem- ber be taking part, all present, putting themselves into the form of the God as taught, should exchange Sign, Grip and Words, so as to establish a current of harmony and the affirmation of a mutual direction of will towards the same object. THE PASSWORD 1. Merely to guard the Secrets of the Order against any Members resigned or not working; hence changed each Equinox. 2. It is an affirmation of the different spiritual as well as the different physical constitutions of the Candidates - that all natures cannot be the same without evil and injury resulting thereby - but that each nature should be brought to its own Kether - the best of its kind. This too, may be done in all things. It is the basis of Alchemy. 3. It should be pronounced as if attracting the Solar Force - the Light of Nature, during the 6 months following the Equinox at which it is issued, as a link with the Solar Force, between that and the Order. This password, therefore, may also be used in a magical ceremony as attracting the support of the Light of Nature acting upon natural forces. THE CEREMONY OF THE EQUINOX The whole formulae of the Ceremony of the Equinox are intended to create a magical link between the Sun, as the Light of Nature, and the Order; and it should be celebrated within 48 hours at least of the Sun's actual entry into Aries or Libra. The single knock given by the Hierophant <149> heralds the initiation of a fresh current. The Password, as already explained, is the symbol of the connecting link of the purpose of the"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"3 74 The Golden Dawn: Volume III Book Five ceremony and therefore, before beginning fresh operation to attract a fresh current, the Kerux proclaims that the former password is abrogated. In the whole Ceremony, save at the exchange of Insignia, the Hierophant, Hiereus, Hegemon, Stolistes and Dadouchos remain in their places - the Kerux, or Watcher of the Gods being the only one who moves. First comes the establishment of a vertical current in the direction of the middle column by the exchange of words between the Hierophant and the Hiereus, while the Hegemon, who is in the whole Ceremony of the Equinox the important Officer, by reason of his insignia, seals and arrests the current in the centre by a single knock and the words \"I am the Reconciler between them.\" Then follows the cross current established between the Stolistes and Dadouchos - again fixed and sealed by the Hegemon, thus symbolising the equilateral cross of the Elements (of which the centre would naturally be about the invisible station of Harpocrates) but is arrested by the Hegemon between the Columns. The cross currents are thus thrown into the image of the Calvary Cross of the Rivers to ally it with the symbolism of Tiphareth and of the Sephiroth. Then the Hierophant, Dadouchos, Hiereus and Stolistes formulate a cir- cle enclosing the symbol, which is again sealed by the Hegemon. Then the Officers, being careful to follow the course of the Sun deposit in turn, their Insignia upon the Altar, taking therefrom instead the mystical symbols of the Body of Osiris corresponding to their Cardinal Points. The Hegemon takes the Lamp of Kerux. The Kerux then circumambulates, halting at the Cardinal Points and facing them, representing the course of the Sun through the Zodiac in order to attract the Solar Ray, but under the control of its Superior, the Light of Osiris, and the adorations are performed at the Stations of the Kerubim to mark the limits of the Circle. <150> This time, it is with the Lamp of the Watcher of the Gods and with the Sign of the Calvary Cross of Tiphareth that the Hegemon seals in the centre the Solar Light. The formal assertion of the entry of a new current of Light is proclaimed, and the Mystic Words are recited to close the ceremony. From this Ceremony there are many practical formulae derivable which will be easily comprehended by the Z. A. M. who has mastered the whole of this lecture. Only let him remember that the formulae of the Ceremony of the Equinox represents the sudden attraction and sealing of a Force in Nature then in operation - rather than a continuous and graduated ceremony to build up the same. Consequently also, it is well to use the password then in being as an adjunct to the other Names employed in magical ceremonies as bringinginto operation the link with the Solar Light.

In such Supernal Realms, the Ain Soph, though negative to us, is there intensely positive. Thence came forth the Gods, the Voice, the Aeons, and the Name. The Egyptian Gods are generally most differentiated by their Crowns: Amen-Ra by the high feathers, Mo-00th (Maut) has the same headdress as Horus. She corresponds to Aima Elohim. The high Hermes-Tho-0th has the same headdress as Amoun Kneph, the Sacred Spirit. Remember that Tho- oth, Truth, has two aspects - the higher and the lower. The higher is Absolute, the lower is suitable to human comprehension. To tell the higher form of a truth to one who cannot understand it is to lie to him because, though correctly formulated, it will not be correctly received. The Forms of Thmaah.

This document, which was presented to advanced members of the Zelator Adeptus Minor grade, lists under the name of the Pentagrammaton several modes of magical working. It comprises, altogether, seven formulae. For the first five of these, I have provided herewith examples of the appro- priate kind of Ritual in order to enable the reader or stude.nt to form some notion of their nature. They are not produced here that they may be slavishly \"Note: Here we have the heart of the Golden Dawn's Magic of Light. Just as the profane Ego, the \"Ferson\" of the Neophyte is bound by oath of submission and faith to the current invested in the Golden Dawn in the neophyte Ritual, so too, every semi-autonomous process, conscious and unconscious,dwelling with that ego in the Kingdom of the Mind must likewise be initiated as a Neophyte in the Golden Dawn. At every conceivable level of your personality, the little whirling wheels of the Cross-Flux of the Elemental Forces represented by I. H. V.

My motive in includ- ing them is only to assist the student as showing him a completed type of ceremony. The formula for Spiritual Development so-called, is represented by two distinct rituals each quite different in structure, yet equally efficacious in its own especial way. The Bornless Ritual, the second of the two, was repro- duced in rudimentary form in my Tree of Life. Because of the excellent dove- tailing of certain Order formulae and speeches with the barbarous words of the older Ritual, rendering it in practice a magnificent and inspiring cere- mony, I have decided to republish it here so that interested students may ob- serve how older fragments may be treated. So far as the writer is concerned, the section on Divination never acquired much meaning, but it was thought advisable to retain it in the event that significance may be seen in it by others. As an example of the first stages of that mode of operation, there is given an experience recorded many years ago by G. H. Frater Sub Spe, and to some it may prove suggestive. The sec- tion on Alchemy remains quite obscure since the subject does not interest me; and I regret that I have not been able to acquire a record of an operation based on it. (N. B. Since this was written, my book entitled The <154> Philosopher's Stone has been published. It is a fairly protracted survey and analysis of alchemical ideology.-I. R.) The Requiem Ritual is an original contribution, though based on fun- damental formulae, and I hope it will be found useful. So far as the first sections on actual Ceremonial Magic are concerned a few remarks may seem appropriate. Let it be noted first of all that a formal Circle and Triangle are required only in that type of operation called Evoca- tion. It is preferable to paint the circle and divine names on the floor or on canvas, or on a neutral coloured sheet of linoleum so that the circle and names appear brilliant and clear cut. But for convenience' sake, and for quick- er working, it is useful to lay out a circle in coloured tapes. The colour naturally will depend on the nature of the ceremony. At the appropriate angles of quarters of this taped circle, pentacles or flashing Tablets of the requisite Divine Names or symbols may be placed. The other ceremonies, Consecration and Invisibility for example, re- quire no such device, for the performance of the Banishing Rituals of the Pen- tagram and Hexagram followed by the Consecrations - either as in the Neophyte Ceremony or as in the Opening by Watch-Tower - clears a space for working which is amply protected. This procedure suffices for most operations, though in Evocation the greatest precautions and protections are necessary, and these are afforded by the presence of the Circle and Di- vine Names. A great deal of attention should be paid to that part of the ceremony demanding the Invocation of the Higher. Success herein spells success for the entire ceremony. That is, there should be a clear consciousness of the pres- ence of the divine force coursing through the operator. He should become aware of the awakening of a titanic force within him. It is an unmistakable sensation. So strong and powerful can this become, that at times it may almost seem to be a physical one. If this Invocation is slurred over or <155> inconsequentially performed, then a great deal of power must be"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"3 78 The Golden Dawn: Volume 111 Book Five expended unnecessarily on the remaining parts of the ritual in order to redeem the entire operation from failure. And the operation would suffer from the disadvantage of having been effected by the human part of the magician, instead of by his own Higher Genius. If the Vibratory formula of the Middle Pillar is very powerfully employed, using the name appro- priate to the operation on hand, and if the force thus invoked is distributed throughout the Sphere of Sensation by the formulae of the Mystic Cir- curnambulation - both of which are fully described in Z. 1, Book Five -then the chances of success are great. It is imperative to stress this point for it is my belief that the greater number of the cases of failure in, let us say, evocation are due solely to hastening past this important stage to the actual and stated purpose of the ceremony. This haste causes failure. Failure brings about dis- appointment in the formula as a whole. This is why so little work has been done on this particular system of Magic. In passing, may I say that before the Vibratory Formula of the Middle Pillar can be at all successfully employed, the student should have put in a great deal of work on the exercise called the Formulation of the Middle Pillar. This exercise, described in the Portal paper reprinted in Part One and at great length in my book The Middle Pillar, awakens the magical centres in the psycho-spiritual make-up of the student. Needless to say, that without the power derived, directly or indirectly, from these Sephirotic centres of chak- ras, there can be no successful Magic. When a certain amount of success has been obtained in this formulation, then the vibratory formula should be assiduously practised. Its results are salutary - and quite apart from the spiritual and psychic effect, which is that to be aimed at, its reaction inciden- tally on the physical health and vitality is so marked as almost to be miraculous. The two important adjuncts to success in Ceremonial Magic <156> are briefly the God-form and the Vibration of the Divine Name. The assumption of the appropriate form of the Egyptian God - or the Telesmatic Image especially built up by the imagination based upon the signification of the letters of the Name - and the powerful vibration of the Name itself by the Vibratory Formula of the Middle Pillar are bound, if all other conditions are complied with, to yield salutary results. The symbolic God-form held firmly in the imagination, the Name vibrated with great force - then the subsequent invocations, and the gradual materialisation or other manifestation of the force, require practically no effort. The most frequent mistake, and of course a natural one, is to concentrate upon the stated pur- pose of the operation. The type of Invocation of the Higher employed in most of the cere- monies shown here has no authority obtaining within the Order. It is fun- damentally the result of my own spiritual bias. The Higher invocations more usually employed within the Order approximate to the nature of ordinary prayers. These, for many reasons into which I do not wish to enter, do not please me. The procedure delineated above should of course be followed in all other types of ceremonial - for the consecration of Flashing Tablets and Talismans; and especially in operations striving towards invisibility or trans-"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"Magical Formulae of Neophyte Grade 3 79 formation is the successful invocation of the divine force necessary. One final word as to these ceremonies. The student is not to assume that these operations in themselves are important. That is, from the spiritual point of view, the fact that the Magician can attain invisibility or effect a transformation or a materialisation is relatively unimportant. What does matter however, is that these operations comprise a discipline and a type of trainkg which is almost indispensable in the serious labours of spiritual development. The student who has struggled with these formulae, and who has kept his aspiration to the divine keen and untarnished, has a disciplined and a powerful instrument at his command. <157> Index for general reference to the Enterer Ceremony of the @ = Grade 1.

I-Announcement aloud that all is prepared for the commencement of the actual Evocation. If it be a good spirit the Sigil is now to be placed within the White Triangle on the Altar, the Magician places his left hand upon it, raises in his right hand the magical Implement em- ployed (usually the Sword) erect; and commences the Evocation of the Spirit N., to visible appearance. The Magician stands in the Place of the Hierophant during the Obligation, irrespective of the particular quarter of the Spirit. But if the nature of that Spirit be evil, then the Sigil must be placed without and to the West of the White Triangle and the Magician shall be careful to keep the point of the Magical Sword upon the cen- tre of the Sigil. J-Now let the Magician imagine himself as clothed outwardly with the sem- blance of the form of the Spirit to be evoked, and in this let him be careful not to identify himself with the spirit, which would be dan- gerous; but only to formulate a species of mask, worn for the time being. And if he knows not the symbolic form of the Spirit, then let him assume the form of an Angel belonging unto the same class of operation, this form being assumed. Then let him pronounce aloud, with a firm and solemn voice, a convenient and potent oration and exorcism of the Spirit unto visible appearance. At the conclusion of this exorcism, taking the covered sigil in his left hand, let him smite it thrice with the flat blade of the Magic <161> Sword. Then let him raise on high his arms to their utmost stretch, holding in his left hand the veiled sigil, and in his right the Sword of Art erect. At the same time stamping thrice upon the ground with his right foot. K-The veiled and corded sigil is then to be placed in the Northern part of the Hall at the edge of the Circle, and the Magician employs the ora- tion of the Hierophant, from the throne of the East, modlfylng it slightly, as follows: \"The voice of the Exorcism said unto me, Let me shroud myself in darkness, peradventure thus may I manifest myself in Light, etc.\" The Magician then proclaims aloud that the Mystic Cir- cumambulation will take place. &The Magician takes up the Sigil in his left hand and circumambulates the Magic Circle once, then passes to the South and halts. He stands (hav- ing placed the sigil on the ground) between it and the West, and repeats the oration of the Kerux. And again consecrates it with Water and Fire. Then takes it in his hand, facing westward, saying, \"Creature of. . . . . . . ., twice consecrate, thou mayest approach the gate of the West.\" M-The Magician now moves to the West of the Magical Circle, holds the Sigil in his left hand and the sword in his right, faces South West, and again astrally masks himself with the form of the Spirit, and for the first time partially opens the covering of the Sigil, without however entirely removing it. He then smites it once with the flat blade of the"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"382 The Golden Dawn: Volume 111 Book Five sword, saying, in a loud, clear, and firm voice: \"Thou canst not pass from concealment unto Manifestation, save by the virtue of the Name Elohim. Before all things are the Chaos and the Darkness, and the Gates of the Land of Night. I am He Whose Name is darkness. I am the Great One of the Path of the Shades. I am the Exorcist in the midst <162> of the Exorcism. Appear thou therefore without fear before me, so pass thou on.\" He then reveils the Sigil. N-Take the Sigil to the North, circumambulating first, halt, place Sigil on the ground, stand between it and the East, repeat the oration of the Kerux, again consecrate with Fire and Water. Then take it up, face North, and say \"Creature of. . . . . . thrice consecrate, thou mayest approach the Gate of the East.\" 0-Repeat Section M in North East. Magician then passes to East, takes up Sigil in left and Sword in right hand. Assumes the Mask of the Spirit form, smites the Sigil with the Lotus Wand or Sword, and says, \"Thou canst not pass from concealment unto manifestation save by virtue of the name YHVH. After the Formless and the Void and the Darkness, then cometh the knowledge of the Light. I am that Light which riseth in the Darkness. I am the Exorcist in the midst of the exorcism. Appear thou therefore in visible form before me, for I am the Wielder of the Forces of the Balance. Thou hast known me now, so pass thou on to the Cubical Altar of the Universe!\" P-He then recovers Sigil and passes to Altar, laying it thereon as before shown. He then passes to the East of the Altar, holding the sigil and sword as already explained. Then doth he rehearse a most potent Conjuration and invocation of the Spirit unto visible appearance, using and reiterating all the Divine, Angelic, and Magical Names appropriate to this end, neither omitting the signs, seals, sigils, lineal figures, signatures and the like from that conjuration. Q-The Magician now elevates the covered Sigd towards heaven, removes the veil entirely, leaving it yet corded, crying with a loud voice, \"Crea- ture of. . . . . . long hast thou dwelt in darkness. Quit the Night and <163> seek the Day.\" He then replaces it upon the Altar, holds the Magical Sword erect above it, the pommel immediately above the centre thereof, and says, ,'By all the names, Powers, and Rites already re- hearsed, I conjure thee thus unto visible appearance.\" Then the Mys- tic Words. R-Saith the Magician, 'As Light hidden in the Darkness can manifest there- from, so shalt thou become manifest from concealment unto mani- festation.\" He then takes up the Sigil, stands to East of Altar, and faces West. He shall then rehearse a long conjuration to the powers and spirits immediately superior unto that one which he seeks to invoke, that they shall force him to manifest himself unto visible appearance. He then places the Sigil between the Pillars, himself at the East facing West, then in the Sign of the Enterer doth he direct the whole current of his will upon the Sigil. Thus he continueth until such time as he shall perceive his Will power to be weakening, when he protects"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"Magical Formulae of Neophyte Grade 383 himself from the reflex of the current by the sign of silence, and drops his hands. He now looks towards the Quarter that the Spirit is to appear in, and he should now see the first signs of his visible manifesta- tion. If he be not thus faintly visible, let the Magician repeat the con- juration of the Superiors of the Spirit, from the place of the Throne in the East. And this conjuration may be repeated thrice, each time end- ing with a new projection of Will in the sign of the Enterer, etc. But if at the third time of repetition he appeareth not, then be it known that there is an error in the working. So let the Master of Evocations replace the Sigil upon the Altar, holding the Sword as usual: and thus doing, let him address a hum- <164> ble prayer unto the Great Gods of Heaven to grant unto him the force necessary to correctly complete that evocation. He is then to take back the Sigil to between the Pillars, and repeat the former pro- cesses, when assuredly that Spirit will begin to manifest, but in a misty and ill-defined form. (But if, as is probable, the Operator be naturally inclined unto evocation, then might that Spirit perchance manifest earlier in the Ceremony than this. Still, the Ceremony is to be performed up to this point, whether he be there or no.) Now as soon as the Magician shall see the visible manifestation of that Spirit's presence, he shall quit the station of the Hierophant, and consecrate afresh with Water and with Fire, the Sigil of the evoked spirit. S-Now doth the Master of Evocations remove from the Sigil the restricting cord, and holding the freed Sigil in his left hand, he smites it with the flat blade of his sword, exclaiming, \"By and in the Names of.. . . . . I do invoke upon thee the power of perfect manifestation unto visible appearance.\" He then circumambulates the circle thrice holding the sigrl in his Right hand. T-The Magician, standing in the place of the Hierophant, but turning towards the place of the Spirit, and fixing his attention thereon, now reads a potent Invocation of the Spirit unto visible appearance, hav- ing previously placed the sigil on the ground, within the circle, at the quarter where the Spirit appears. This Invocation should be of some length; and should rehearse and reiterate the Divine and other Names consonant with the working. That Spirit should now become fully and clearly visible, and should be able to speak with a direct voice, if consonant with his <165> nature. The Magician then proclaims aloud that the Spirit N. hath been duly and properly evoked in accordance with the sacred Rites. U-The Magician now addresses an Invocation unto the Lords of the plane of the Spirit to compel him to perform that which the Magician shall demand of him. I V-The Magician carefully formulates his demands, questions, etc., and writes down any of the answers that may be advisable. The Master of"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"384 The Golden Dawn: Volume 111 Book Five Evocations now addresses a Conjuration unto the Spirit evoked, binding him to hurt or injure naught connected with him, or his assist- ants, or the place. And that he deceive in nothing, and that he fail not to perform that which he hath been commanded. W-He then dismisses that Spirit by any suitable form, such as those used in the higher grades of the Outer. And if he will not go, then shall the Magician compel him by forces contrary to his nature. But he must allow a few minutes for the Spirit to dematerialise the body in which he hath manifested, for he will become less and less material by degrees. And note well that the Magician (or his companions if he have any) shall never quit the circle during the process of evocation, or afterwards, till the Spirit hath quite vanished. Seeing that in some cases, and with some constitutions, there may be danger arising from the Astral conditions, and currents established, and without the actual intention of the Spirit to harm, although if of a low nature, he would probably endeavour to do so. Therefore, before the commencement of the Evocation, let the operator assure himself that everything which may be necessary, be properly arranged within the circle. But if it be actually necessary to interrupt the Process, then let him stop at that point, veil and re-cord the Sigil if it have been unbound or un- covered, recite a License to Depart or a Banishing Formula, and per- <166> form the Lesser Banishing Rituals both of the Pentagram and Hexa- gram. Thus only may he in comparative safety quit the circle. Note-Get the Spirit into a White Triangle outside the midheaven, then shall he speak the truth of necessity. CONSECRATION OF TALISMANS A-The place where the operation is done. B-The Magical Operator. C-The Forces of Nature employed and attracted. D-The Telesma or material basis. E-In Telesmata, the selection of the Matter to form the Telesma; the prepa- ration and arrangement of the place. The drawing and forming of the body of the Telesma. In Natural Phenomena the preparation of the operation; the formation of the Circle, and the selection of the mate- rial basis, such as a piece of Earth, a cup of Water, a Flame of Fire, a Pentacle, or the like.

Naming aloud the Nature of the Telesma or Operation. G-The Telesma or material Basis is now placed towards the West, and duly consecrated with Water and Fire. The purpose of the operation, and the effect intended to be produced is then to be rehearsed in a loud"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"Magical Formulae of Neophyte Grade 385 and clear voice. H-Placing the Talisman or material basis at the foot of the Altar, state aloud the object to be attained, solemnly asserting that it will be attained, and the reason thereof.

Place a good Telesma or Material Basis within the White Triangle on the Altar. Place bad to the West of same, holding the sword erect in the right hand for a good purpose, or its point upon the centre of the Triangle for evil. J-Now follows the performance of an Invocation to attract the desired spirit to the Telesma or material basis, describing in the air above it the lineal figures and sigils, etc., with the appropriate instrument. Then, taking up the Telesma in the left hand, let him smite it thrice with the flat of the blade of the Sword of Art. Then raise it in the left hand (holding erect and aloft the Sword in the right hand stamping thrice upon the Earth with the right foot). K-The Talisman or Material basis is to be placed towards the North, and the Operator repeats the Oration of the Hierophant to the candidate. \"The voice of the Exorcism said unto me, Let me shroud myself in darkness, peradventure thus shall I manifest myself in light. I am the only being in an abyss of Darkness. From the Darkness came I forth ere my birth, from the silence of a primal sleep. And the Voice of Ages answered unto my soul, Creature of Talismans, the Light shineth in the darkness, but the darkness comprehendeth it not. Let the Mystic Circumambulation take place in the path of Darkness with the symbolic light of Occult Science to lead the way.\" L-Then, taking up the Light (not from the Altar) in right hand, circumambu- late. Now take up Telesmata or M. B., carry it round the circle, place it on the ground due South, then bar it, purify and consecrate with Water and Fire afresh, lift it with left hand, turn and facing <168> West, say, \"Creature of Talismans, twice consecrate, thou rnayest approach the gate of the West.\" M-He now passes to the West with Telesmata in left hand, faces S.E., partly unveils Telesmata, smites it once with the flat blade of the Sword, and pronounces, \"Thou canst not pass from concealment unto manifestation, save by virtue of the name Elohim. Before all things are the Chaos and the Darkness, and the gates of the land of Night. I am He whose Name is Darkness. I am the great One of the Paths of the Shades.

Quit the Night and seek the Day.\" He then replaces it in the Altar, holds the Magical Sword erect above it, the Pommel immediately above the centre thereof, and says, \"By all the Names, Powers, and rites already rehearsed, I conjure upon thee power and might irresistible.\" Then say the Mystic Words, Khabs Am Pekht, etc. R-Saith the Magician, \"As the Light hidden in darkness can manifest there- from, so shalt thou become irresistible.\" He then takes up the Teles- mata, or the M. B., stands to East of the Altar, and faces West. Then shall he rehearse a long conjuration to the Powers and Spirits irn- mediately superior unto that one which he seeks to invoke, to make the Telesmata powerful. Then he places the Talisman or M. B. be- tween the Pillars, himself at the East, facing West, then in the Sign of the Enterer, doth he project the whole current of his Will upon the Talisman. Thus he continueth until such time as he shall perceive his will power weakening, when he protects himself by the Sign of <170> Silence, and then drops his hands. He now looks toward the Talis- man, and a flashing Light or Glory should be seen playing and flick- ering on the Talisman or M. B., and in the Natural Phenomena a slight commencement of the Phenomena should be waited for. If this does not occur, let the Magician repeat the Conjuration of the Superiors from the place of the Throne of the East. And this conjuration may be repeated thrice, each time ending witha new projection of Will in the Sign of the Enterer, etc. But if at the third time of repetition the Talisman or M. B. does not flash, then be it known that there is an error in the working. So let the Master of Evocations replace the Talisman or M. B., upon the Altar holding the Sword as usual, and thus doing, let him address an humble prayer unto the Great Gods of Heaven to grant unto him the force necessary"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"Magical Formulae of Neophyte Grade 387 to correctly complete the work. He is then to take back the Talisman, to between the Pillars, and repeat the former process, when assuredly the Light will flash. Now as soon as the Magician shall see the Light, he shall quit the station of the Hierophant and consecrate afresh with water and with fire. S-This being done, let the Talisman or M. B. have the cord removed and smite it with the Sword and proclaim \"By and in the Names of.. . . . .,I invoke upon thee the power of. . . . . .\" He then circumambulates thrice, holding the Talisman or M. B. in his right hand. T-Then the Magician, standing in the place of the Hierophant, but fixing his gaze upon the Talisman or M.B. which should be placed on the ground within the Circle, should now read a potent invocation of some length, rehearsing and reiterating the Divine and other <I71 > Names consonant with the working. The Talisman should now flash visibly, or the Natural Phenomena should definitely commence. Then let the Magician proclaim aloud that the Talisman has been duly and properly charged, or the Natural Phenomena induced. U-The Magician now addresses an Invocation unto the Lords of the plane of the Spirit to compel him to perform that which the Magician requires. V-The Operator now carefully formulates his demands, stating clearly what the Talisman is intended to do, or what Natural Phenomena he seeks to produce. W-The Master of Evocations now addresses a conjuration unto the Spirit, binding him to hurt or injure naught connected with him, or his assist- ants, or the place. He then dismisses the Spirits in the name of Jehovashah and Jeheshua, but wrap up Talisman first, and no Banish- ing Ritual shall be performed, so as not to discharge it, and in the case of Natural Phenomena it will usually be best to state what duration is required. And the Material Basis should be preserved wrapped in white linen or silk all the time that the Phenomena is intended to act. And when it is time for it to cease, the M. B. - if water, is to be poured away; if Earth, ground to powder and scattered abroad; if a hard substance as a metal, it must be decharged, banished and thrown aside; if a flame of fire, it shall be extinguished; or if a vial containing air, it shall be opened and after that well rinsed out with pure water. 111. v N - INVISIBILITY A-The Shroud of Concealment.

The affirmation aloud of the reason and object of the working. I-Announcement that all is ready for the commencement of the operation. Operator stands in the place of the Hierophant at this stage, placing his left hand in the centre of the white triangle and holding in his right the Lotus Wand by the black end, in readiness to concentrate around him the shroud of Darkness and Mystery. (N. B. In this operation as in the two others under the dominion of Shin, a Pentacle or Telesma suitable to the matter in hand, may be made use of, which is then treated as is directed for Telesmata.) J-The Operator now recites an Exorcism of a Shroud of Darkness to sur- round him and render him invisible, and, holding the Wand by the black end, let him, turning round thrice completely, formulate a triple circle around him, saying, \"In the Name of the Lord of the Universe, etc., I conjure thee, 0 Shroud of Darkness and of Mystery, that thou encirclest me so that I may become invisible, so that seeing me, men see me not, neither understand, but that they may see the thing that <173> they see not, and comprehend not the thing that they behold! So mote it be.\" K-Now move to the North, face East, and say, \"I have set my feet in the North, and have said 'I will shroud myself in Mystery and conceal- ment.\" Then repeat the Oration, \"The Voice of my Higher Soul, etc.,\" and then command the Mystic Circumambulation. &Move round as usual to the South, Halt formulating thyself as shrouded in darkness, on the right hand the Pillar of Fire, and on the left the Pillar of Cloud, but reaching from Darkness to the Glory of the Heavens.

R-Still formulating the shroud, say, \"Before all Magical manifestation com- eth the knowledge of the hidden light.\" Then move to the pillars and give the signs and steps, words, etc. With the Sign of the Enterer, pro- ject now thy whole will in one great effort to realise thyself actually fading out, and becoming invisible to mortal eyes; and in doing this must thou obtain the effect of thy physical body actually gradually becoming partially invisible to thy natural eyes, as though a veil or cloud were formulating between it and thee (and be very careful not to lose thy self-control at this point.) But also at this point is there a cer- tain Divine Exstasis and an exaltation desirable, for herein is a sensa- tion of an exalted strength. S-Again formulate the shroud as concealing thee and enveloping thee, and thus wrapped up therein, circumambulate the circle thrice. T-Intensely formulating the Shroud, stand at the East and proclaim, \"Thus have I formulated unto myself a shroud of Darkness and of Mystery, as a concealment and guard.\" U-Now rehearse an invocation of all the Divine Names of Binah, that thou mayest retain the Shroud of Darkness under thy own proper control and guidance. V-State clearly to the shroud what it is thy desire to perform therewith. W-Having obtained the desired effect, and gone about invisible, it is re- quired that thou shouldst conjure the Powers of the Light to ad against that shroud of Darkness and Mystery so as to disintegrate it, lest any force seek to use it as a medium for an obsession, etc. Therefore rehearse a conjuration as aforesaid, and then open the <175> shroud and come forth out of the midst thereof, and then disin- tegrate that shroud, by the use of a conjuration to the forces of Binah to disintegrate and scatter the particles thereof, but affirming that they shall again be readily attracted at thy command. But on no account must that shroud of awful Mystery be left without such disintegration, seeing that it would speedily attract an occupant which would become a terrible vampire praying upon him who had called it into being. And after frequent rehearsals of this operation, the thing may almost be done \"per Motem.\" D TRANSFORMATIONS A-The Astral Form. B-The Magician. C-The Forces used to alter the Form.

The Magician mentally places the form as nearly as circumstances permit in the position of the Enterer, < 176> himself taking the place of the Hierophant, holding his Wand by the black portion ready to commence the Oration aloud. J-Let him now repeat a powerful exorcism of the shape into which he desires to transform himself, using the Names, etc., belonging to the Plane, Planet, or other Eidolon, most in harmony with the shape desired. Then holding the Wand by the black End, and directing the flower over the head of the form, let him say, 'ln the name of the Lord of the Universe, Arise before me, 0 Form of.. . . . ., into which I have elected to transform myself. So that seeing me men may see the thing that they see not, and comprehend not the thing they behold.\" K-The Magician saith, 'Tass toward the North, shrouded in darkness, 0 Form of.. . . . .,into which I have elected to transform myself.\" Then let him repeat the usual Oration from the Throne of the East. Then com- mand the Mystic circumambulation. L-Now bring the Form around to the South, arrest it, and formulate it there, standing between two great Pillars of Fire and Cloud. Punfy it with Water and by Fire, by placing these elements on either side of the Form.

And at this point he must see as if in a cloudy and misty manner the outline of the form enshrouding him, though not yet completely and wholly visible. When this occurs, but not before, let him formulate himself as standing between the two vast Pillars of Fire and Cloud. S-He now again endeavours to formulate the Form as if visibly enshroud- ing him; and still, astrally, retaining the form, he thrice circurnam- bulates the place of working. T-Standing at the East, let him thoroughly formulate the shape, which should now appear manifest, and as if enshrouding him, even to his own vision; and then let him proclaim aloud, \"Thus have I formulated unto myself this Transformation.\" U-Let him now invoke all the Superior Names, etc., of the Plane appro- priate to the Form that he may retain it under his proper control and guidance. V-He states clearly to the Form what he intends to do with it. W-Similar to this W section of Invisibility, save that the conjurations, etc., are to be made to the appropriate plane of the form instead of to Binah. <178> V SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT A-The Sphere of Sensation. B-The Augoeides. C-The Sephiroth, etc. employed. D-The Aspirant, or Natural Man. E-The Equilibration of the Symbols. F-The Invocation of the Higher. The limiting and controlling of the lower and the closing of the material senses, to awaken the spiritual. G-Attempting to make the Natural Man grasp the Higher by first limiting the extent to which mere Intellect can help him herein; then by purification of his thoughts and desires. In doing this let him formu- late himself as standing between the Pillars of Fire and Cloud. H-The Aspiration of the whole Natural Man towards the Higher Self, and a prayer for Light and guidance through his Higher Self, addressed to the Lord of the Universe. I-The Aspirant affirms aloud his earnest prayer to obtain Divine Guidance, kneels at the West of the Altar; in the position of the Candidate.in the Enterer, and at the same time astrally projects his consciousness to the East of the Altar, and turns, facing his body, to the West, holding astrally his own left hand with his astral left. And he raises his Astral right hand holding the presentment of his Lotus Wand by the White portion thereof, and raised in the Air erect. J-Let the aspirant now slowly recite an oration unto the Gods and unto the Higher Self (as that of the Second Adept in the entering of the Vault) but as if with his Astral Consciousness, which is projected to the East of the Altar. (Note: If at this point the Aspirant should feel a sensation as of"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"392 The Golden Dawn: Volume 111 Book Five faintness coming on, let him at once withdraw the projected Astral and properly master himself before proceeding any further.) <179> Now let the Aspirant, concentrating all his intelligence in his body, lay the blade of his Sword thrice on the Daath point of his neck, and pronounce with his whole will, the words \"So help me, the Lord of the Universe and my own higher soul.\" Let him then rise, facing East, and stand for a few moments in silence, raising his left hand open, and his right holding the Sword of Art, to their full length above his head; his head thrown back, his eyes lifted upwards. Thus standing let him aspire with his whole will towards his best and highest Ideal of the Divine. K-Then let the Aspirant pass unto the North, and facing East solemnly repeat the Oration of the Hierophant, as before endeavouring to pro- ject the speaking conscious self to the place of the Hierophant (in this case to the Throne of the East.) Then let him slowly mentally formu- late before him the Eidolon of a Great Angel Torch-bearer, standing before Him as if to lead and light the way. L-Following it, let the Aspirant circumambulate, and pass to South, then let him halt, and aspire with his whole will, first to the Mercy side of the Divine Ideal, and then to the Severity thereof. And then let him imagine himself as standing between two great Pillars of Fire and Cloud, whose bases indeed are buried in black ever rolling clouds of darkness, which symbolises the chaos of the World of Assiah, but whose summits are lost in glorious light undying, penetrating unto the White Glory of the Throne of the Ancient of Days. M-Now doth the Aspirant move unto the West, faces S. E., and repeats alike the speeches of Hiereus and Hegemon. <180> N-After another circumambulation, the Adept aspirant halts at the South and repeats the meditation in L 0-And so he passes unto the East, and repeats alike the words of the Hierophant and the Hegemon. P-And so let him pass to the West of the Altar, ever led by the Angel Torchbearer. And he projects his Astral, and he implants therein his consciousness, and his body kneels what time his soul passes be- tween the Pillars. And he prayeth the Great Prayer of the Hiero- phant. Q-And now doth the Aspirant's Soul re-enter unto his gross-form; and he dreams in Divine Exstasis of the Glory Ineffable which is in the Born- less beyond; and so meditating doth he arise, and lifts to the Heavens, his hands, and his eyes, and his hopes, and concentrating his Will on the Glory, low murmurs he the Mystic Words of Power. R-So also doth he presently repeat the words of the Hierophant concerning the Lamp of the Kerux, and so also passeth he by the East of the Altar unto between the Pillars; and standing between them(or formulating them if they be not there as it appears unto him) so raises he his heart unto the Highest Faith, and so he meditates upon the highest God- head he can dream of. Then let him grope with his hands in the dark- ness of his ignorance, and in the Enterer sign invoke the Power that it"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"Magical Formulae of Neophyte Grade remove the darkness from his spiritual vision. So let him then en- deavour to behold before him in the Place of the Throne of the East, a certain light or Dim glory, which shapeth itself into a Form. (Note: And this can be beholden only by the mental vision. Yet, owing unto the spiritual exaltation of the Adept, it may sometimes appear as if he beheld it with mortal eye.) <181> Then let him withdraw awhile from such contemplation and formulate for his equilibriation once more the Pillars of the Temple of Heaven. S-And so again doth he aspire to see the Glory conforming - and when this is accomplished, he thrice circumambulates, reverently saluting with the Enterer the Place of Glory. T-Now let the Aspirant stand opposite unto the Place of that Light, and let him make deep meditation and contemplation thereon. Presently also imagining it to enshroud and envelope him, and again en- deavouring to identify himself with its glory. So let him exalt himself in the likeness or eidolon of a colossal Being, and endeavour to realise that this is the only True Self, and that the Natural Man is as it were the base and throne thereof, and let him do this with due and meet reverence and awe. And therefore he shall presently proclaim aloud 'Thus at length have I been permitted to begin to comprehend the form of my Higher Self.\" U-Now doth the aspirant make entreaty of that Augoeides to render com- prehensible what things may be necessary for his instruction and comprehension. V-And he consults It in any matter he may have especially sought for guidance from the Beyond. W-And lastly, let the Aspirant endeavour to formulate a link between the Glory and his self-hood; and let him renew his obligation of purity of mind before it, avoiding in this any tendency to fanaticism or spiritual pride. (And let the Adept remember that this process here set forth is on no account to be applied to endeavouring to come in contact with the higher soul of Another. Else thus assuredly will he be led into error, hallucination, or even madness.) IV. 1 DIVINATION A-The Form of Divination. B-The Diviner. C-The Forces acting in the Divination. D-The subject of the Divination.

G-The first entry into the matter. First assertion of limits and correspon- dences: beginning of the working. H-The actual and careful formulation of the question demanded; and con- sideration of all its correspondences and their classifications. I-Announcement aloud that all the correspondences taken are correct and perfect; the Diviner places his hand upon the instrument of Divina- tion; standing at the East of the Altar, he prepares to invoke the forces required in the Divination. J-Solemn invocation of the necessary spiritual forces to aid the Diviner in the Divination. Then let him sayI1'Arise before me clear as a mirror, 0 magical vision requisite for the accomplishment of this divination.\" K-Accurately define the term of the question; putting down clearly in writ- ing what is already known, what is suspected or implied, and what is sought to be known. And see that thou venfy in the beginning of the judgment that part which is already known. L-Next let the Diviner formulate clearly under two groups or heads (a) the arguments for, (b) the arguments against, the success of the subject <183> of one divination, so as to be able to draw a preliminary conclusion therefrom on either side. M-First formulation of a conclusive judgment from the premises already obtained. N-Same as section L 0-Formulation of a second judgment, this time of the further develop ments arising from those indicated in the previous process of judg- ment, which was a preliminary to this operation. P-The comparison of the first preliminary judgment with one second judg- ment developing therefrom, so as to enable the Diviner to form an idea of the probable action of forces beyond the actual plane, by the invocation of an angelic figure consonant to the process. And in this matter take care not to mislead thy judgment through the action of thine own preconceived ideas; but only relying, after due tests, on the indication afforded thee by the angelic form. And know, unless the form be of an angelic nature its indication will not be reliable, seeing, that if it be an elemental, it will be below the plane desired. Q-The Diviner now completely and thoroughly formulates his whole judg- ment as well for the immediate future as for the development thereof, taking into account the knowledge and indications given him by the angelic form. R-Having this result before him, let the Diviner now formulate a fresh divination process, based on the conclusions at which he has arrived, so as to form a basis for a further working. S-Formulates the sides for and against for a fresh judgment, and deduces conclusion from fresh operation. T-The Diviner then compares carefully the whole judgment and decisions arrived at with their conclusions, and delivers now plainly a succinct and consecutive judgment thereon. <184> U-The Diviner gives advice to the Consultant as to what use he"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"Magical Formulae of Neophyte Grade 395 shall make of the judgment. V-The Diviner formulates clearly with what forces it may be necessary to work in order to combat the Evil, or fix the Good, promised by the Divination. W-Lastly, remember that unto thee a divination shall be as a sacred work of the Divine Magic of Light, and not to be performed to pander unto thy curiosity regarding the secrets of another, and if by this means thou shalt arrive at a knowledge of another's secrets, thou shalt respect and not betray them. V il ALCHEMY A-The Curcurbite or the Alembic. B-The Alchemist. C-The processes and forces employed. D-The matter to be transmuted. E-The selection of the Matter to be transmuted, and the formation, cleans- ing and disposing of all the necessary vessels, materials, etc., for the working of the process. F-General Invocation of the Higher Forces to Action. Placing of the Matter within the curcurbite or philosophic egg, and invocation of a blind force to action therein, in darkness and silence. G-The beginning of the actual process. The regulation and restriction of the proper degree of Heat and Moisture to be employed in the working. First evocation followed by first distillation. H-The taking up of the residuum which remaineth after the distillation from the curcurbite or alembic; the grinding thereof to form a powder in a mortar. This powder is then to be placed again in the curcurbite. The fluid already distilled is to be poured again upon it. The curcur- bite or philosophic egg is to be closed. <185> I-The curcurbite or Egg Philosophic being hermetically sealed, the Alchemist announces aloud that all is prepared for the invocation of the forces necessary to accomplish the work. The Matter is then to be placed upon an Altar with the elements and four weapons thereon; upon the white triangle and upon a flashing Tablet of a general nature, in harmony with the matter selected for the working. Standing now in the place of the Hierophant at the East of the Altar, the Alchemist should place his left hand upon the top of the curcurbite, raise his right hand holding the Lotus Wand by the Aries band (for in Aries is the beginning of the life of the year), ready to commence the general invocation of the forces of the Divine Light to operate in the work. J-The pronouncing aloud of the Invocation of the requisite general forces, answering to the class of alchemical work to be performed. The con- juring of the necessary Forces to act in the curcurbite for the work required. The tracing in the air above it with appropriate weapon the necessary lineal figures, signs, sigils and the like. Then let the Alchemist say: \"So help me the Lord of the Universe and my own Higher Soul.\" Then let him raise the curcurbite in the air with both hands, saying: \"Arise herein to action, 0 ye forces of the Light"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"The Golden Dawn: Volume I11 Book Five Divine.\" K-Now let the matter putrefy in the Balneum Mariae in a very gentle heat, until darkness beginneth to supervene; and even until it becometh entirely black. If from its nature the mixture will not admit of entire blackness, examine it astrally till there is the astral appearance of the thickest possible darkness, and thou mayest also evoke an elemental form to tell thee if the blackness be sufficient. But be thou sure that in this latter thou art not deceived, seeing that the nature of such an <186> elemental will be deceptive from the nature of the symbol of Dark- ness, wherefore ask thou of him nothing further concerning the working at this stage but only concerning the blackness, and this can be further tested by the elemental itself, which should be either black or clad in an intensely black robe. (Note, for this evocation, use the names, etc., of Saturn.) When the mixture be sufficiently black, then take the curcurbite out of the Balneum Mariae and place it to the North of the Altar and perform over it a solemn invocation of the forces of Saturn to act therein; holding the wand by the black band, then say: \"The voice of the Alchemist\" etc. The curcurbite is then to be unstopped and the Alembic Head fitted on for purposes of distillation. (Note: In all such invocations a flashing tablet should be used whereon to stand the cur- curbite. Also certain of the processes may take weeks, or even months to obtain the necessary force, and this will depend on the Alchemist rather than on the matter.) L-Then let the Alchemist distil with a gentle heat until nothing remaineth to come over. Let him then take out the residuum and grind it into a powder; replace this powder in the curcurbite, and pour again upon it the fluid previously distilled. The curcurbite is then to be placed again in a Balneum Mariae in a gentle heat. When it seems fairly re-dissolved (irrespective of colour) let it be taken out of the bath. It is now to undergo another magical ceremony. M-Now place the curcurbite to the West of the Altar, holding the Lotus Wand by the black end, perform a magical invocation of the Moon in her decrease and of Cauda Draconis. The curcurbite is then to be exposed to the moonlight (she being in her decrease) for nine con- <187> secutive nights, commencing at full moon. The Alembic Head is then to be fitted on. N-Repeat process set forth in section L. 0-The curcurbite is to be placed to the East of the Altar, and the Alchemist performs an invocation of the Moon in her increase, and of Caput Draconis (holding Lotus Wand by white end) to ad upon the matter. The curcurbite is now to be exposed for nine consecutive nights (end- ing with the Full Moon) to the Moon's rays. (In this, as in all similar exposures, it matters not if such nights be overclouded, so long as the vessel be placed in such a position as to receive the direct rays did the cloud withdraw.) P-The curcurbite is again to be placed on the white triangle upon the Altar. The Alchemist performsan invocation of the forces of the Sun to act in"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"Magical Formulae of Neophyte Grade 397 the curcurbite. It is then to be exposed to the rays of the sun for twelve hours each day; from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. (This should be done pre- ferably when the sun is strongly posited in the Zodiac, but it can be done at some other times, though never when he is in Scorpio, Libra, Capricornus, or Aquarius). Q-The curcurbite is again placed upon the white triangle upon the altar. The Alchemist repeats the words: \"Child of Earth, long hast thou dwelt, etc.\" then holding above it the Lotus Wand by the white end, he says: '1 formulate in thee the invoked forces of Light,\"and repeats the mystic words. At this point keen and bright flashes of light should appear in the curcurbite, and the mixture itself (as far as its nature will permit) should be clear. Now invoke an Elemental from the curcur- bite consonant to the Nature of the Mixture, and judge by the nature of the colour of its robes and their brilliancy whether the matter has attained to the right condition. But if the flashes do not appear, and if <188> the robes of the elemental be not brilliant and flashing, then let the curcurbite stand within the white triangle for seven days; having on the right hand of the Apex of the triangle a flashing tablet of the Sun, and in the left one of the Moon. Let it not be moved or disturbed all those seven days; but not in the dark, save at night. Then let the opera- tion as aforementioned be repeated over the curcurbite, and this pro- cess may be repeated altogether three times if the flashing light cometh not. For without this latter the work would be useless. But if after three repetitions it still appear not, it is a sign that there hath been an error in the working, such being either in the disposition of the Alchemist or in the management of the curcurbite. Wherefore let the lunar and the solar invocations and exposures be repeated, when without doubt, if these be done with care (and more especially those of Caput Draconis and Cauda Draconis with those of the Moon as taught, for these have great force materially) then without doubt shall that flashing light manifest itself in the curcurbite. R-Holding the Lotus Wand by the white end, the Alchemist now draws over the curcurbite the symbol of the Flaming Sword as if descending into the mixture. Then let him place the curcurbite to the East of the Altar. The Alchemist stands between the pillars, and performs a solemn invocation of the forces of Mars to ad therein. The curcurbite is then to be placed between the Pillars (or the drawnsymbols of these same) for seven days, upon a flashing tablet of Mars. After this period, fit on the Alembic Head, and distil first in Balneum Mariae, then in Balneum Arenae till what time the mixture be all distilled over. S-Now let the Alchemist take the fluid of the distillate and let him <189> perform over it an invocation of the forces of Mercury to act in the clear fluid, so as to formulate therein the alchemic Mercury, even the Mercury of the philosophers. (The residuum or the dead head is not to be worked with at present, but is to be set apart for future use.) After the invocation of the Alchemic Mercury a certain brilliance should manifest itself in the whole fluid, that is to say, it should not only be clear, but also brilliant and flashing. Now expose it in an her-"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"398 .The Golden Dawn: Volume 111 Book Five metic receiver for seven days to the light of the Sun; at the end of which time there should be distinct flashes of light therein.

T-Now the residuum or Dead Head is to be taken out of the curcurbite, ground small and replaced. An invocation of the Forces of Jupiter is then to be performed over that powder. It is then to be kept in the dark standing upon a flashing Tablet of Jupiter for seven days. At the end of this time there should be a slight flashing about it, but if this come not yet, repeat this operation up to three times, when a faint flashing of Light is cerfain to come.

The receiver containing the distillate is now to be placed between the Air and Water Tablets, and the curcurbite with the Dead Head between the Fire and Earth Tablets. Now let the Alchemist perform an invocation using especially the Supreme Ritual of the Pentagram, and the lesser magical implement appropriate. First, of the forces of Fire to ad in the curcurbite on the dead head. Second of those of Water to act on the <190> distillate. Third, of the forces of the Spirit to act in both (using the white end of Lotus Wand). Fourth, of those of the Air to ad on the distillate; and lastly, those of the Earth to act on the Dead Head. Let the Curcurbite and the receiver stand thus for five consecutive days, at the end of which time there should be flashes manifest in both mix- tures. And these flashes should be lightly Coloured.

This must be white with golden charges, and is to be placed on or within the white triangle between the vessels. He then addresses a most solemn invocation to the forces of Kether; to render the result of the working that which he shall desire, and mak- ing over each vessel the symbol of the Flaming Sword. <191> This is the most important of all the Invocations. It will only succeed if the Alchemist keepeth himself closely allied unto his Higher Self during the working of the invocation and of making the Tablet. And at the end of it, if it have been successful, a keen and trans- lucent flash will take the place of the slightly coloured flashes in the receiver of the curcurbite; so that the fluid should sparkle as a dia- mond, whilst the powder in the curcurbite shall slightly gleam. W-The distilled liquid is now to be poured from the receiver upon the residuum of the Dead Head in the curcurbite, and the mixture at first will appear cloudy. It is now to be exposed to the Sun for ten days con- secutively (ten is Tiphareth translating the influence of Kether.) It is then again to be placed upon the white triangle upon the Altar, upon a flashing Tablet of Venus, with a solemn invocation of Venus to act therein. Let it remain thus for seven days, at the end of which time see what forms and colour and appearance the Liquor hath taken, for there should now arise a certain softer flash in the liquid, and an elemental may be evoked to test the condition. When this softer flash is manifest, place the curcurbite into the Balneum Mariae to digest with a very gentle heat for seven days. Place it then in the Balneum Mariae to distil, beginning with a gentle, and ending with a strong heat. Distil thus till nothing more will come over, even with a most violent heat. Preserve the fluid in a closely stoppered vial, it is an Elixir for use according to the substance from which it wasprepared. If from a thing medicinal, a medicine; if from a metal, for the purifying of metals; and herein shalt thou use thy judgment. The residuum thou shalt place without powdering into a crucible, well sealed and luted. And thou shalt place the same in thine Athanor, bringing it first to a <192> red, and then to a white heat, and this thou shalt do seven times in seven consecutive days, taking out the crucible each day as soon as thou hast brought it to the highest possible heat, and allowing it to cool gradually. And the preferable time for this working should be in the heat of the day. On the seventh day of this operation thou shalt open the cruc- ible and thou shalt behold what Form and Colour thy Caput Mortuum hath taken.

APPENDIX TO THE JUPITER TALISMAN RITUAL The foregoing is a fairly good example of a Ritual for the Consecration of a Talisman employing the formulae of the Neophyte Ceremony described in the document 2.2. Properly performed, it takes about one and a half <224> hours. There is a slight variation of this which can be employed, using the formula of the Rite of the Kerubic Stations from the Theoricus grade ceremony. If this is added, and the student should certainly experiment with its employment since it produces an astonishingly power- ful effect, the total time taken by the ceremony will be around two hours. The result of this addition is to build up more deliberately an astral body of incar- nation for the invoked spiritual force. The best place for the insertion of this phase of the ceremony is after the three circumambulations, when the operator has projected the entire force of his will upon the talisman which is placed between the two Pillars. In this instance, the following appendix is added to page 221, just prior to the invocation repeated from page 215. I will repeat part of the rubric. Circumambulate three times with Talisman in right hand. Return to the Throne of the East, and holding the Talisman aloft, proclaim: Behold the Exorcist in the midst of the Exorcism. And the power of the Exor- cist said unto the Talisman, Let us enter the presence of the Ancient of Days. Arise, and come with me. Still holding Talisman aloft, attract the light as you pass between the Pillars. Circumambulate, saying: Amoun the Concealed One spake and said: I am the Secret of Secrets hidden in the heart of all things. I am the Grace of the majesty divine. I am the Lord of perfected work. Having circumambulated once, stop in the East, face East, saying: Before thou canst be a means for the manifestation of the divine light thy body must be formed from the swift-flowing air. Place Talisman before the Air Tablet, and make round it the invoking circle and Pentagram of Active Spirit with Wheel, and Air Pentagram with Aquarius Kerub: <225> In the name of Yhvh, and in the name of Shaddai El Chai, and in the name of Raphael, your archangel, Spirits of Air, ye I command.

Concentrate upon this Talisman the substance of your realm, so that the all-potent forces descend- ing may impart unto it a tireless strength, and an all prevailing energy. So that unto me it may be a Talisman ever helping me to aspire unto the Divine with the extended flame of an all-penetrant vision. Creature of Talismans, thou hast the fire of life. So pass we on. Take up Talismans, and pass round completely, holding the Talisman alofl, and attracting the Light. I have passed through the Gates of Wisdom and come unto the palace of Peace. Give me your hands, 0 ye Lords of Truth, for I am made as ye. Ye are the teachers of the soul.

FRATER Sub Spe The Preparation for Divination - Opening Ceremony of @ = The Temple is the Aura or Sphere of Sensation. The Hierophant is the Diviner, the positive active will which manipulates and controls all the other bodily functions, and all the forces operating in the Aura. Sitting in as comfortable position as possible, close the eyes, and begin to fix attention on the Pole Star and circumpolar constellations, endeavour- ing to visit each prominent star and then to pass from one to another. Then, in the same way to visit the South Polar constellations. Then to be conscious of both simultaneously as one might be of head and feet. In this way the astral grew gradually colossal, and the sensation arose of being outside of, and in fad containing the whole starry universe. The earth had become a mere insigruficant speck. The sense of human form was wholly lost, but there was a sense of up and down, and of the pole of a spherical aura. Endeavoured to place this so as to correspond with the centre of Draco, the Kether of the Starry Sphere. This caused a more definite idea of the sphere and of the Sephiroth and Paths therein, and the belt of the Zodiac coloured of a hollow sphere or magic circle, wherein a blinding white light was in the place of Kether, and thick darkness onMalkuth. Stood immediately in front of Kether and realised that the blackness of Malkuth guarded the sphere from evil and sub-human forces, the Qlippoth, or on this spiritual plane, the bondage to the material. Endeavoured to formulate this Black Darkness into a giant Guard- ian, realising also that it was my own negative will saying \"Thus far, and no further.\" <272> In front of this Guardian which I perceived, was the reflection of my own material universe, i.e., everything I was or could possibly be conscious of in the body, \"All thoughts, all passions, all delights - what- soever stirs this mortal frame,\" but only the reflection thereof as in a mirror, and having therefore no power to move the spiritual consciousness. The form was a square of earth cast in the form of a double cube answering to the Tenth Sephirah, for every possible thought or emotion of the body, however lofty, was represented there, even to the highest spiritual aspirations, all dominated by the white triangle of the Triune God and the Red Cross of self- sacrifice. I then realised that even the reflection of my own universe, including my very thoughts and aspirations in the body, stood without a colossal portal of a Temple, my Spiritual Will being within, and the shadowy Portal grew up be- tween the perceiving consciousness and the perceived Universe. Two vast pillars of positive and negative, the eternal contraries, were the Gateway; and the pure white of equilibrium and eternal silence was between them. My 451"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"452 The Golden Dawn: Volume 111 Book Six spiritual conscious Will now advanced as it were below the centre of its sphere, near to that point of equilibrium so as to survey through the portal of the Pillars the reflection of my own universe. Fixing myself there as immovable - because eternally right, being dominated only by the forces of the Eternal God, my lower nature lay before me as it were, mapped out. In front the Great Portal shutting out all that had not attained to, and retained, perfect equilibrium, beyond and as far distant from the point of equilibrium as my own consciousness, was my evil self, the root of all evil. And I was now conscious in that past which was the root of all good. And thus again an equilibrium was preserved between the Pillars. At an equal distance again beyond this evil self, were the reflection of <273> the perceived universe, formulated as the cubical altar whereon were the symbols of the elements and the triangle and cross, and beyond this the dark and threatening black figure of the Great Guardian of the West. Furthermore, from my right hand came the cool influence of mois- ture, from my left the warmth of fire, and from the moist warmth at the point of equilibrium sprang the idea of generation, birth, growth and development which forces were directed upon the Cubical Altar, bringing the forces of Life into my universe. Yet - all this was rnyseIf. I realised that far beyond the possibilities of bodily thought there were in myself forces, powers and knowledge far transcending all that the body can ever perceive or imagine in its loftiest flights. In this manner I was able to order and direct the forces of the intellec- tual brain - the Kerux, Anubis, the \"Watcher without\" being the conscious intellectual brain which thinks and ads in the material body. The Watcher within, the higher intuitive intellect whose workings are mostly unconscious to the material man. Recognising now the importance of maintaining this exalted attitude and preventing the entrance of any material and mundane thoughts, my spiritual will ordered the logical intellect, by will-force rather than definite thought, to clear the Temple, and the intellect bearing a ray of white light from the supreme and lighted by the lamp of wis- dom commanded all material things to stand aloof. Then and not till then the Spiritual Will which now seemed to be myself, began to function. It initiated a current of force and commanded the higher intuitional intellect to see that the sphere was properly closed against material thoughts. This was accom- plished by a communication between the intuitional intelligence and the physical logical brain, the latter keeping guard over the material body (by this time almost forgotten, its cerebrations having become uncon- scious). <274> The Spiritual Will now directs the Guardian of the West to make sure that all forces operating are forces of good, and in obedience to the Spiritual Will, whose controlling force is the ineffable Power of God Him- self. This is done by every force treading down the evil, and invoking and bringing forward the light into the material. The sensation here should be that every force in the sphere of sensation is in unity and affirming the Will of God. A certain equilibrium having thus been established the whole sphere of Sensation should be vitalised by the vibratory formula of the Middle Pillar."},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"Preparafion for Divination 453 The sensation is that the consciousness which is in the spiritual will draws in a deep inspiration of divine power from the supreme hierarchy, and by an effort of Will sends it down to the Guardian of the west, whence it rushes forth in strength and power, vitalising the Genius of equilibrium between the Pillars, and thence the whole sphere. The attention is then fixed on each force in turn, now alive and clothed with a definite symbolic form. In this it is desirable to use the forms of the Gods of Egypt, so as to avoid the chance of illusion through memory creeping in by the appearance of the human officers one is accustomed to see. Each of this considered in detail assumes a symbolic form. Note, that as the present purpose is to examine the reflection of some earthly event or force, the symbology is particularly regarded with reference thereto. Thus the Hiereus specially guards against the intrusion of any material wish or thought or emotion which might disturb the perfect calm of the divining mind. The Dadouchos is not alone the power of heat and dryness but of energy, fire, passion, impetuous zeal; and Stolistes is not alone cold or moisture, but pleasure, love, luxury, etc. In fact the forces of Wands and Cups. The fiery zeal prepares the way for the prayer which rises from the soul like incense, this prayer being related also to the suffering which is the purification by Fire. <275> The receptive and negative forces of the Cup are those which develop the perception of the symbology of the various forces. The intuitive intellect (Anubis, the Watcher within) regulates the imaginative forming of the sphere of sensation itself - guides the formulated move- ments thereof - keeps alive the light of occult science and grasps the ray of Divine Wisdom. So the genius of equilibrium, Thmaah, must introduce the question to be investigated, for unless this be done by perfect equilibrium no good result can be attained. I now felt every force moved by my own higher intuition, directed by the Spiritual Will. All thoughts of earth were lost altogether, and only the great forces were perceived, which might produce a material result, but that result was not perceptible. Unless this result is attained at this stage, I have found it useless to go further. I next endeavoured to mark the limits of the sphere of sensation by the consecrations of fire and water. Now a complete establish- ment of calm and passive equilibrium in the Sphere was required, and the formulation of a vortex to draw in the highest spiritual influences. I there- fore, directed as in the 6 = m, the circumambulation of these mighty forces, as it were, a great wheel which set revolving, whose centre was the point of silence, the Throne of Harpacrat. The whole sphere then adored the Lord of the Universe. At this stage I found that I could formulate the figure of a terrestrial globe in the place of the Altar, and fixing the attention on any point of the surface, get a mental picture of what was transpiring there, recognising at the same time that it took place by the action and reaction of the great forces which moved by the Will of God and were therefore in all things perfectly good. This rendered impossible any feeling of joy or sorrow at any event, any hope or any fear, any affection for any individual, or any antipathy. The <276> desire to know became simply a desire to be associated in the knowledge of God and therefore so far united to Him."},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"454 The Golden Dawn: Volume I11 Book Six Unless this stage is reached at this point, earthly thoughts have intruded, the Temple has not been properly cleansed and guarded, and according to my experience no true results can be expected.

Also several pieces of oral instruction are here included. I have kept rigidly to the technique as taught and practised in the Order-1.R) \"The subject of clairvoyance must always be in the highest degree interesting to all who are aspiring after Adeptship even in its lowest grades.. . We frequently meet with two opposite attitudes towards the subject, both in the outer world and amongst our junior members. Both these attitudes are hindrances to its proper study, and therefore I shall preface my remarks by a few words concerning each of them. \"The &st is fear of clairvoyance. And the second is a disproportionate estimate of its value. \"Both of the& attitudes arise from a misunderstanding of its true charac- ter. People imagine that somehow the power of clairvoyance is obtained secondhand from the powers of evil; or that its exercise will bring those who practice it under their influence. Or, on the other hand, they imagine that the power of clairvoyance will save them a great deal of trouble, and give them a short and easy path to the information and guidance they desire. In fact, that these may almost be attained at will. Nay more, would such a power not fully satisfy that curiosity which is one of the pitfalls of the superficial student? \"The properly trained clairvoyant need have no fear that he will thereby expose himself to the powers of evil. It is the untrained natural clair- <12> voyant who is in danger. Training will give him knowledge, dis- cipline and protection, such as will protect him from the onslaught of the averse powers. \"On the other hand, let him who desires to save himself trouble and to gain knowledge to which he has no claim, be very well assured that only 'in the sweat of his brow' can he obtain this power and exercise it in security. And that he who seeks to gratify his curiosity will either be mortified by dis- appointment or distressed by discoveries he would much prefer not to have made. Trained, humble, and reverent clairvoyance is a great gift, opening up new worlds and deeper truths, lifting us out of ourselves into the great inpouring and outpouring of the heart of God.\" (G. H. Fratre F.R.'s notes.) The earliest experiments in clairvoyance as taught by the Order are with the Tattwa symbols. These, with their traditional names, significances, sym- bols and colours are: 456"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"Clairvoyance 457 Akasa-Ether or Spirit. Symbol: black or indigo egg. Vayu- Air. Symbol: a sky-blue disc or circle. Tejas-Fire. Symbol: Red equilateral triangle. Apas-Water. Symbol: a silver crescent. Prithivi-Earth. Symbol: a yellow square or cube. In brief, the traditional occult concept of the Tattwa is that of a vital current of ether or force-the Hindu Pranas-which issues in a steady stream from the Sun. That stream is five-fold, and flows around our earth, vitalising its astral substance or its sphere of Sensation. In short, they are the currents of sub-planes of the Astral Light. The theory has it that the Element of Akasa is strongest at dawn, when the Sun rises, and its power continues for the space of two hours, when its force subsides and glides into Vayu, Air. Yellow Square El PRITHM-EARTH VAYU-AIR TEJAS-FIRE ver Crescent 2 APAS-WATER TATTWA SYMBOLS"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"458 The Golden Dawn: Volume TV Book Seven This also persists or is in course for the same period. Each Tattwa or <13> current of force is believed to exist strongly for this length of time, each merging at the end into the succeeding Tattwa in the order given above. After the current of Prithivi is exhausted, the cycle recommences with Akasa, and continues in the same order again and for the same periods. As no element on our plane can exist in an unmixed form, but <14> contains within itself-the constituents of all the others, or possesses several grades or planes of its own substance, so each Tattwa is sub- divided into five divisions, currents or planes. Akasa of Akasa, Spirit of Spirit, would be the most Tenuous and purest form of that element, the integral nature of Spirit-its highest essence. Vayu of Akasa would refer to its airy quality; Tejas of Akasa to its fiery and dynamic aspect; Apas of Akasa, its fluidic and watery phase, while Prithivi of Akasa, its most terrestrial phase, or that aspect of its power which more nearly than the others contacts the earth. The same five-fold division, in the same five-fold order, applies equally to the other elements. The student is strongly urged to make these symbols, and have a set of them with him for working. The primary or simple Tattwa should be made about two or two and a half inches in height. It is recommended that coloured papers be used rather than water colours, since the brilliance of the former is much greater than the latter. The lacquer paints which are now easily obtain- able may also be used to good effect. If the symbols are cut from coloured papers, they should be pasted oh clean unused cards length upwards. The method of indicating a sub-Tattwa, or a charged or compound Tattwa, is to paint or paste upon the principal symbol a smaller symbol of the charge or sub-element. Thus, in the case of Tejas of Prithivi, Fire of Earth, Prithivi which is the major symbol should be made about two and a half inches square, whilst the red triangle, each angle about half an inch long, should be pasted in the centre of the larger symbol. It is a useful preliminary also to write on the back of the card the appropriate Divine and Angelic Names. The method of using these Tattwa symbols for clairvoyance is a simple one. My remarks in the following example will refer to the element of Prithivi, Earth, the yellow square, and what is said of this will apply <15> equally well to the remaining symbols. Though the method is simple, it is far from fool-proof, and the description of it should be read several times. The student should be calm and quiet, and, sitting in his chair, take the card bearing the symbol of the yellow square in his hand, and gaze intently at it for about twenty seconds. Quickly transferring his attention from the sym- bol to any white surface, such as the ceiling, or a sheet of paper at his side especially provided for the purpose, he will see, by reflex optical action, the same shape but in a direct complementary colour. This will be a sort of luminous lavender-blue, or pale translucent mauve. The actual tint of this complementary colour will depend wholly on the depth of the yellow used in the first place, as well as upon the lighting conditions prevailing at the time of the experiment. Immediately this mauve square is seen, the student should close his eyes, and endeavour to visualize in imagination this mauve square as stand-"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"Clairvoyance 459 ing before him. This clearly perceived by the mind's eye, let the student at once imagine that it enlarges itself, becoming an object large enough for him to pass through. The next step is to imagine that he is actually passing through this square, as though it were a door. The best method of doing this is to employ the Neophyte sign, the Sign of the Enterer, which is that of \"groping for light.\" It is essentially a projecting sign, and the effect should be of having projected himself through this door or gateway. It is recommended that the student rise to his feet at this juncture and, still visualizing the enlarged square with closed eyes of course, perform this Sign of Horus physically, and believing himself through it, sit down ready to commence the vision. One of the other instructions puts it thus: \"First meditate on the element selected, soak yourself in it till, if it be Fire, you feel hot; if Water, wet, and so on, all the time co-ordinating the symbol with your sensations. Then, laying aside the symbol, and closing your eyes, endeavour to project and <16> enlarge that symbol before you, regarding it as a gateway through which you are to pass . . . Deliberately will to pass through the gateway. Let him imagine that he can hear it close behind him.\" Yet another version, this time written by D.D.C.F. says: \"Keep up the design, form and colour in the Akasic Aura, as clearly as they appeared in material form to the outward seeing. Transfer the vital effort from the optic nerve to the mental perception, or thought-seeing as distinct from the seeing with the eye. Let one form of apprehension glide on into the other. Produce the reality of the dream vision by positive will in the waking state. . . Then maintaining your abstraction from your surroundings, still concentrated upon the symbol and its correlated ideas, you are to seek a perception of a scene or panorama or view of the plane. This may also be brought on by a sense of tearing open, as a curtain is drawn aside, and seeing the 'within' of the symbol before you.\" The principal idea is to imagine the symbol, in its complementary colour, as a door and to pass through it. Having imagined that there has been a passing through the door, and clearly realising, in this instance, the mauve Square behind him, the seer should make an effort to look about him. Let him endeavour to see objects, entities, or some sort of landscape. Most always these take the form of pale stilled pictures, seen as it were with the mind, or the eye of imagination. Hillocks, meadows, rocks, vast brown boulders may be seen, and what is most important, there should be a strong sense of being within the element; the seer should understand, as he has never quite real- ised before, the true nature, the 'feel' of Earth. Before aught else occurs, the Divine Names appropriate to that element should now be vibrated, beginning with the Deity Name. The student should vibrate each slowly and audibly several times. Thus, he would vibrate Adonai Ha-Areh, three or four times, then the name ofAuriel the Archangel of <17> Earth, followed by the name of Phorlakh the Angel of Earth. These will usually suffice though the Hebrew name of the element and cardinal quarter may also be employed. Various changes may now be perceived to occur to the landscape; it will become alive, vivified and dynamic, and the sense of the element should become even more clearly and vividly defined."},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"460 The Golden Dawn: Volume ZV Book Seven Also a being may appear, one whose characteristics pertain to the element of Earth, and his garments, their colours, and his other ornaments should be in the appropriate colours. Under no circumstances should the Seer wander from his doorway alone; he should always wait until one of these elemental beings or \"guides\" appears, and he should continue vibrating the names until one does appear, or until he obtains the sense that one is present. Some- times, and with some students, there is no clear vision of these occurrences or beings, but only a sense or intuition or powerful instinct that such and such a thing is happening, and that such a type of being has appeared. This often is more trustworthy than the use of sight or other sense. The guide having made his appearance, he is to be tested by every means at the Seer's disposal. First of all, it is well to assume the Sign of the Grade to which that element is referred. In this instance, the Sign of the Zelator should be made, by physically as well as astrally raising the right arm to an angle of forty-five degrees. The guide should answer this with the same Sign or another which is unrnistakeable proof that he belongs to the element and has been sent to act as guide. If there is deception, these signs will cause him distress, or at once the vision will break up, or the false guide will disap- pear. He should also be asked clearly and deliberately whether he comes to act as guide in the name of the appropriate Deity Name. If all this strikes the Seer as satisfactory, and his doubts settled, let him follow the guide to wherever he is being led, carefully noting whither he goes, and asking ques- tions about the element or whatever he sees. <I83 A very important thing is here to be noted. On these subtler planes, or within the realms of these symbols, form takes on sym- bolic implication which we, on earth, have obscured if not lost. It is only human beings who swathe themselves in garments whose shape and colour bear no relation to their true character. \"Even on our own plane, the clothing of animals is pregnant with meaning, and on the astral plane this is far more emphatically the case. An elemental may, for some purpose of its own, mas- querade for a time in alien garb, but we are given a certain definite procedure to follow in dealing with them.\" The Signs of the elemental Grades, the vibration of divine and angelic names, and the tracing of appropriate pentagrams are symbols which power- fully affect these elemental inhabitants of the astral, and prevent or disclose deception. It is but rarely that there will be necessity to resort to anything so drastic as the Pentagrams in these tattwa visions, for the vibration of the He- brew name either of the element, or of the Archangel will restore order and harmony. The true form, colour, clothing, even adornments such as jewels and embroideries are consonant to the element and character of the beings under discussion. And unless they are, the Seer may be sure he is being imposed on, and should act accordingly - at once. In a short while, after only a few astral experiences, these symbolic ideas will have been sufficiently familiar to the student to enable him at once to detect error or imposition. In the event of employing a charged or compound Tattwa such as let us assume, Fire of Earth, indicated by a Red Triangle within a larger Yellow square, it may happen that the seer may find himself being escorted from one guide to another, and passed from one plane to another. The same test"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"Clairvoyance 461 should be applied, and not the slightest loophole should be left for the entry of even the smallest incongruous item. The divine names of the secondary Tattwa should be vibrated, and the grade Sign attributed to it should <19> be assumed. Only when fully satisfied, and he must never permit himself to be easily satisfied, should the Seer proceed. If the first guide be left behind, he must be accorded courtesy of farewell. ''Always treat these beings with courtesy and in accord with their rank. Pay deference to the superior orders, the Archangels, Angels and Rulers. To those of lower rank, bear yourself as an equal; and to those lower still, as to servants whom you treat politely, but do not allow familiarity. Elementals pure and simple, such as fairies, gnomes and so on, must be treated with firmness and decision, as they are often mischievous and irresponsible, even though free from malice.\" It is also said to be a good practice, since form is symbolic in these regions, to imagine yourself as large as possible, always taller than the being confronting you; and under every circumstance maintain self-control and fearless demeanour. At first, and for the first half-a-dozen experiments, the student should be content with the simple observation of the landscape and, if possible, the type of guide who appears in answer to the Names. At the beginning it is more important to acquire facility in passing through these symbolic doors than in acquiring impressive visions. The Seer will find himself on the right track if he is content, for quite some little time, with a glimpse of a hill, a cave, an underground hall, or an Angel of the Element, and so on, returning after the brief visit. With facility acquired, he may stay in the vision for a longer period, which should be relatively full of incident and action, and should impart no little knowledge. The method of leaving the Tattwa and returning to Earth is the precise reversal of the initial process. After thanking the guide and bidding him farewell, the Seer should retrace his footsteps to the symbolic Door - the purple or lavender-blue square. It is insisted that this return should be made as definite as possible. That is, there should be no sudden departure from the place and finding oneself back in one's normal state of mind. <20> The Seer will be wise if he carefully follows the passage he has waked through, even if it has been a very long way, the reason being that it is well to keep the two states of consciousness, the two planes, quite distind from one another. There should be no merging of the elemental plane into the plane of everyday consciousness, and the best way of ensuring this is to make both coming and going follow a definite and distinct tech- nique. After having found your way back to the door, you pass through it, again with the Sign of the Enterer, and return to your body. At once stand up, and make physically and firmly the Sign of Silence, raising the left forefinger to the lips, and stamping with the right foot. Always note that the first Sign of the Enterer is answered and followed by the Sign of Silence. It is not well to repeat these experiments too frequently at first; some advise an interval of several days between them, for the first few months of one's efforts in this direction. But when performed, the seer should make every effort to avoid self-delusion and deception. He should be alert the whole time, and never embark on these experiments when tired or not"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"462 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Seven physically well. At the least threat of incoherence, or the entry of incon- gruous symbols or elements into the vision, the names, signs, and symbols should be repeated. Thus and thus alone may he hope to avoid delusion. These planes are a source of untold danger to whosoever is not able to take them with the proverbial grain of salt. Flattery, which is one of the most fre- quent types of delusion encountered, and the most common source of trou- ble, should be avoided like the plague. Madness lies that way and I cannot stress too strongly that vanity should be wholly discarded, and flattery eschewed. During his adventures, the Seer should endeavour to describe carefully and in full detail the landscape of the vision. He should discover if possible the special attributes and nature of that plane, the type of its in- <21> habitants -spiritual, elemental and so on; the plants, animals and minerals which would correspond to its nature; the operation of its influence upon Man, animals, plants and minerals here. The process of working by placing the symbol upon the forehead, instead of imaginatively passing through it, is not a good practice. S.R.M.D. claims that it is liable to derange the brain-circulation and cause mental illusions and disturbance, headache and nervous exhaustion. It is also necessary to avoid self-hypnotism, for this would dispose towards medi- umship and make the Seer the playground of forces. The Seer at all costs must control, and not permit himself to be controlled. If in danger at any time, or should he feel that he cannot accommodate the forces of the vision to his will, or that his self-control is breaking, he should resort to the vibration of the Names, and then retire from the vision. By continuing these practices for a long period of time, the inner clair- voyance will develop, and with perseverance the visions will grow from vague indeterminate pictures, hardly distinguishable from imaginative con- cepts, to vivid powerful experiences. But even when these do occur he should under no circumstances accept them on their face value or neglect his tests, for the whole astral plane, apparently, seeks to delude the Seer and if he opens himself, by neglecting the tests, he is lost. With considerable practice, too, the symbols may be discarded for they will not be required to give entrance to the planes, though for the beginner no attempt should be made to work without the use of the actual material symbol. It will be found wisest to keep as much to the physical plane as possible, by employing the physical symbols, and by making the appropriate signs and steps with the physical body, as well as by speaking audibly and describing the vision as it pro- ceeds. When the student has become fairly proficient with the use of simple Tattwas, he should experiment with the compound Tattwas, and not <22> be satisfied with his ability to skry until he is perfectly familiar with every part of the planes represented by those symbols. Then he can devise further experiments with other symbols. The use of the element Akasa, the indigo egg, was in the Order usually postponed until entry had been obtained into the Second Order. The reason for this was that no traditional Names are provided for use with this symbol as with the other four, and the student must discover or devise his own. As has already been"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"Clairvoyance 463 described at length the entrance into these subtle planes is obtained by means of the Divine Names; the rule being to invoke the highest Names known by the Seer. Any student who has studied the Adeptus Minor Cere- mony, and the Ritual of the Pentagram will realise what Names are required for use with this symbol of Akasa. Eheieh, Agla, Yeheshuah, and Eth will be the general Names for the simple Tattwa, and the compound or charged Akasa cards will demand the use of the Names from the Enochian Tablet of Union. It will be found a good plan to prepare cards of the Geomantic symbols painted in their appropriate colours, for these make perfect \"doors\" through which the Seer can pass. And while these symbols are also attributed to the elements, the vision acquired from the Geomantic symbols using the names of the appropriate Rulers and genii will be quite distinct in character from those of the Tattwa cards. The Hebrew letters, the Tarot cards and Sigils, the planetary and zodiacal Signs, and Sigils of every description may be used to yield the symbolic door to a subtle plane. A vast new field of knowledge is thus opened up. The names appropriate to each of these symbols are given in these papers, which should be carefully studied by the student. And he should remember that the formula of the employment of the divine Names and signs applies equally to these other symbols as they did to the Tattwa cards. There was a good deal of glib parlance within the Order as to <23> 'astral vision\" and \"etheric vision.\" The former was described as the ordinary Tattwa vision, in which objects and landscapes, though vivid and alive, are yet \"flat\" as though reflected on a mirror, rather like a cinematograph film. \"In this form of descrying, note that you see objects reversed, as to right and left, for which suitable allowance must be made.\" The use of the phrase \"mirror-like vision\" is actually a very adequate descrip- tion. Yet this is capable, as development proceeds, of merging into another type of vision - a full-blooded clairvoyance, in which things and people are seen in three dimensions, and as though the seer were not merely watching the scene, but were actually in it. Some explained that as \"etheric vision\" although the actual Order documents describe this as the clairvoyance ensu- ing from astral projection. Greatly Honoured Fratre D.D.C.F. states: ''If instead of this simple vision a ray of yourself is sent out and actually goes to the place (astral projection) there is not necessarily the sense of reversal of objeds.. . Scenes, things, instead of being like pictures, have the third dimen- sion, solidity; they stand out like bas-relief, then haut-relief, then you see as from a balloon, as it is said, by a bird's-eye view. You feel to go to the place, to descend upon it, to step out upon the scene, and to be an actor there.\" The same rules laid down for the simpler method of skrying should be followed here, and always the highest divine names should be used, and constant tests applied. The paper which follows this, dealing with Skrying and Astral Pro- jection by V.N.R. will explain the process a little more fully by means of set- ting forth an example of its working. Another technique, making use of this faculty, was described in a paper recording a lecture by Fratre Sub Spe. The idea was to re-read the rituals, and then endeavour to re-tread the Paths astrally. One example given, was that"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"464 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Seven the Seer should formulate in imagination a vast pylon, and within its gates he should visualise the Hebrew Letter Tau, the 32nd Path. This should <24> be preceded by a study of the Ritual of the Theoricus Grade, es- pecially of the Rite of the Kerubic Stations. Then, imagining himself passing through this Letter Tau, and entering the Pylon, he should proceed to make the appropriate Pentagrams and Hexagrams, and vibrating the Divine Names appropriate to that plane. The resulting vision should be similar to the passage of the Path in the ceremony, but whereas this latter was purely symbolic, the former may be real and dynamic, and may develop into an initiation in the true sense of the word. The same technique may be applied to every Path and to every Sephirah. Developing still further from this, there is another practice which passes beyond mere clairvoyance, though making use of it. This is called Rising on the Planes, and is a spiritual process after spiritual conceptions and higher aims. \"By concentration and contemplation of the divine, you formulate a Tree of Life passing from you to the spiritual realms above and beyond your- self. Picture to yourself that you stand in Malkuth, then by the use of the Divine Names and aspiration, you strive upwards by the Path of Tau towards Yesod, neglecting the crossing rays which attract you as you pass up. Look upwards to the Divine Light shining downward from Kether upon you. From Yesod, leads upward the Path of Samekh, Temperance; the Arrow, cleaving upwards, leads the way to Tiphareth, the great central Sun.\" D.D.C.F. also suggests that, having risen to Tiphareth, the Adept skryer should formulate to himself that he is bound to a Cross, exactly as occurred in the Adeptus Minor Ceremony, and by invoking the Great Angel HUA beseech help and guidance in the pathway of Light. By this method, he may more easily ascend the planes which lead to the glory of the Crown. Thus formulating in the imagination the different parts of the Tree of Life, and vibrating the God- names appropriate to the Sephiroth or Paths, the Seer may find him- <25> self, if his aspiration is sincere and keen, rising towards the Spiritual Light, bathed in that golden glory of effulgence which is continuously shed from above. Though it may seem rather out of place to quote Aleister Crowley here, yet he has written things in his Magick on this subject that are so very impor- tant that I am impelled to quote them here for the benefit of the student. The important drill practises, in his belief, are: \"1. The fortification of the Body of Light by the constant use of rituals, by the assumption of God-forms, and by the right use of the Eucharist. \"2. The purification and consecration and exaltation of that Body by the use of rituals of invocation. \"3. The education of that body by experience. It must learn to travel on every plane; to break down every obstacle which may confront it.\" In a footnote to the above, he has appended a footnote which I re- produce herewith: \"The Aspirant should remember that he is a Microcosm. 'Universus sum et Nihil universi a me alienum puto' should be his motto. He should make it his daily practice to travel on the Astral Plane, taking in turn each of the most synthetic sections, the Sephiroth and the Paths. These being thoroughly"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"Clairuoyance 465 understood, and an Angel in each pledged to guard or to guide him at need, he should start ona new series of expeditions to explore the subordinate sec- tions of each. He may then practice Rising on the Planes from these spheres, one after the other in rotation. When he is thoroughly conversant with the various methods of meeting unexpected emergencies, he may proceed to investigate the regions of the Qlippoth and the Demonic Forces. It should be his aim to obtain a comprehensive knowledge of the entire Astral Plane, with impartial love of truth for its own sake; just as a child learns the geography of the whole planet though he may have no intention of ever leaving his native land.\" The clairvoyance thus obtained may be used to watch the prog- <26> ress of Ceremonies, when it becomes a highly useful gift, sometimes a necessity; and also in observing what occurs astrally when certain Sigils or Pentagrams are traced or Names vibrated. There are several methods of testing and protection, in addition to those already mentioned. The supreme method of protection - though it is infinitely more than technical means of banishing - is through the assump- tion of the God form Harpocrates. The astral image should be formulated either as rising from a Lotus, or else standing erect over two crocodiles. Little need be said about this technique; it is adequately described elsewhere, in Z.1. Incidentally, this is an excellent preparation for meditation or vision, to formulate the form about and around one, and to identify oneself with it. In the event, during any vision, that the Seer is approached by entities, as to whose integrity or true character he has some doubts, the simplest form of testing is to formulate between the Seer and the approaching entity the Ban- ner of the West. As described in the document about the symbolism of the Neophyte Ceremony, this Banner is that which bars and threatens. It is one of the insignia of the Hiereus, whose throne is in the West of the Temple, and his office is that of\"Avenger of the Gods,\"so situated as to represent a seat of wit- ness and of punishment decreed against evil. And all his insignia partake of this symbolism. Thus, should the being be of an evil nature - \"thus far and no farther\" is the message indicated to it by the Banner. The interposition of the Banner would be immediately efficacious, by causing it to disappear instantaneously. If, however, the entity is well-intentioned and not evil, no harm will have been done by that formulation. No balanced force, no power of good, will object or resent legitimate forms of testing its integrity. Since, likewise, the Banner of the East, one of the insignia of the Hiero- phant in the East of the Temple, \"represents the ascent of the Initiate <27> unto perfect knowledge of the light,\" it may assist to formulate this Banner about his own being. The Central Cross of the banner will suggest his own form with outstretched arms - a true calvary cross. About him, the Seer will visualise vividly the interlaced red and blue triangles of the Tiphareth hexagram, at the same time imagining that the white triangle of the Supernals has descended into his heart. The alternate and occasionally simultaneous use of these Banners is a powerful means of banishing the evil, and invoking balanced power to one's aid. In the rubrics of certain rituals, the injunction occurs to formulate this Banner about talismans or flashing Tab- lets that are being consecrated, as this process assists the descent or the incar-"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"466 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Seven nation of the Light, or the invoked force, into the symbol. The employment of the Rose-Cross together with the vibration of the Pentagrammaton, YHShVH is likewise another method of ensuring protec- tion and of banishing evil. Usually, as previously stated, any threat of danger on the elemental planes represented by the Tattwa symbols may be met sim- ply by the vibration of the appropriate divine names, and, though very rarely necessary, by the banishing Pentagrams traced in the air. The Rose Cross and the Pentagrammaton will apply more to planes above or more powerful than those of the Tattwas. Experience combined with a sound instinct will dictate to the Seer when such symbols should be used. He will find it occasionally of great assistance to commence his experiments by the preliminary use of the Banishing Rituals and by burning some incense. In the Outer Order of the Stella Matutina, or the Golden Dawn, formal dress for this type of work as for Temple ceremonies consisted of a black gown, red slippers, and a black and white nemyss; the sash of the grade could also beworn. In the Order of the R.R et A.C., it was customary to wear a white gown, yellow or gold slippers, a nemyss of white and yellow stripes, <28> and the Rose-Cross lamen on one's breast. The Lotus Wand should be employed and held in the hand whilst skrying, and the Four Elemental Weapons - Fire Wand, Water Cup, Air Dagger, and Earth Penta- cle, should be placed before one. If there is a small table convenient, this should be covered with a black cloth, and the implements grouped on this as upon the Altar, while the Cross and Triangle of the Order should be put in the centre. Sometimes, a sympathetic projection into the elements may be encompassed by the preliminary use of the appropriate Prayer of the Ele- ments provided in the grade rituals."},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"<29> OF SKRYING AND TRAVELLING IN THE SPIRIT-VISION By V. H. SOROR, V.N.R Having acquired the general rules, it is probable that the student will discover for himself particular methods more or less suited to his own par- ticular temperament. But it may prove useful to some for me to write in some detail the mode of skrylng and of astral projection which I have proved likely to bring successful results, and which by reasons of its continual tests would tend to lessen the many chances of illusion. Before proceeding further it may be well to refer to the Microcosm Lecture (in Volume One) regarding the theory of skrymg and astral projection. The rules for skrying and astral projection being almost similar, the two subjects can be studied together, the one being taken as the complement of the other. You can commence the operation \"skrying\" simply. That is to say, not projecting the astral beyond the sphere of Sensation into the Macrocosmos, but retaining it and perceiving some scene in the Universe refleded in the symbol which you hold, this latter being to you as a mirror which shall reflect to you some scenes not within your range of sight. And secondly, you can continue the operation by using the same symbol, and by passing through it project yourself to the scene in question, which before you had only per- ceived as a reflection. The latter process will probably appear more vivid to the perception that the prior one, just as in material vision one is less <30> likely to be deceived by going to a place and actually examining it, than by obtaining knowledge of it from a mere reflection in a mirror. For example, in the room in which I am now, I see refleded in a mirror a portion of the garden. I obtain an impression of all within my range of sight, but not nearly so powerful a one as when I step out into the garden to the spot in question, and examine all the objects therein, feel the atmosphere, touch the ground, smell the flowers, etc. But it is well to practise both methods. The latter will probably be found to be more instructive, though far more fatiguing, since you will, when pro- jecting the astral, have to supply it with much vitality, drawn mostly from the Nephesch. In both skrying and astral projection, then, the key of success would appear to be, alternately to employ Intuition and Reason, firstly by permit- ting each thought-picture to impress itself on the brain in the manner com- prehended generally by the word 'inspiration,' followed by the reason applying its knowledge of correspondences to an affirmation or correction of the same. You must be prepared to receive impressions of scenes, forms and 46 7"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"The Golden Dawn: Volume IV Book Seven sounds as vivid thought forms. \"Thought forms\" I use for want of a better word. There are distinctly in these experiences, things heard, things felt as well as things seen, which would prove that the qualities that we are here using are really the sublimated senses. That the faculty of clairvoyance, etc. exists is easily provable after a little patient exercise with one of the first methods given unto us for the practice of skrying. Take the Tattwa cards, and from them choose one at random, without looking to see what symbol it may.represent, and lay it down on a table face downwards. Then try mentally to discover the symbol. To do this make your mind a blank as much as possible (yet always keeping control over the same) chasing therefrom, for the time being, the reasoning element, <31> memory, etc. You will find that after a few moments of gazing atten- tively at the back of the card, that it will seem as though the thought form of the Tattwa appeared to enter the mind suddenly, and later, when more practised, it will probably appear to you as if the Tattwa symbol were trying to precipitate itself materially through the back of the card. (1) But sometimes, especially if the cards have been long kept together in the pack in the same order, we may find that the back of the card in question is charged astrally nof with the symbol upon its face, but with that upon the card whose face has been next its back in the order of the pack. Some may find it easier to turn the card over astrally, that is in imagina- tion, and in imagination endeavour to perceive what flashes into the mind at that moment. As it is with the Tattwas that our first experiences are made, I will choose one to illustrate the following rules, preferably one that shall be in harmony with the time that I commence my working. (2). RULES FOR SKRYING Work if possible in an especially prepared magical room, S. M. altar in the centre, on which stand the four elements and the Cross and Triangle, incense burning, lamp lighted, water in the cup, (3), bread and salt. As well as these, place on the Altar our four magical implements. Clothe your- self in your White Robe, and 6 = sash, wearing on breast your Rose- Cross. Have by you your Sword and Lotus Wand. Sit at the side of the Altar fac- ing the Quarter of the Element, Planet or Sign with which you are working. Should any other Frater or Soror be with you, arrange that they shall sit in balanced disposition (5) around the Altar. That is, if the forces with which you work be in the West, your place is East of the Altar facing West across it. Should it be inconvenient for you to have your own consecrated room, or to have all or any of your implements for your experiment, do your utmost to imagine them as astrally existing about you, and in any case in astral <32> projection wear the garments and insignia astrally all through the experience. In fad, after constant, most constant, practice you will not probably find the absolute physical so necessary. Yet remember, that though the material in magical working is the least important of the planes in one sense, yet in another it is of the utmost importance for it crystallises the astral plane and completes it. And also have before you the exact correspondences"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"Skrying and Astral Projection of certain universal formulae (for in the aforesaid insignia and implements you hold a perfect representation of the Universe (6), the contemplation of which should in itself tend to prevent your mind dwelling on irrelevant sub- jects, but on the contrary compel your attention to the sublime studies of the mysteries of the Macrocosm.) Also do these Insignia, which have been con- secrated, give you a certain power through their having attracted rays of force from the Infinite Invisible more or less potent in proportion to your development. The importance of using the implements on every occasion would appear to be great. For the implement assists the invoking of a ceremony, and the latter should help the implement, and therefore every voyage, for exam- ple, to the realms of Fire or Water should add a flame to the Wand and mois- ture to the Cup. Next purify the room with Fire and Water and the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. Imagine that we have chosen as a Tattwa, Apas- Prithivi. For this symbol naturally, use the correspondences of Water and Earth, but bear in mind that the World of Water is here chiefly expressed, the Earth being secondary. Therefore in this particular example, it is well to use principally the Cup, the Pentacle only in a minor sense. To imply this, use the Cup to make even many of the Earth symbols, and only occasionally employ the Pentacle in working the particular symbol. <33> In this suppositious case of w , thoroughly to fill yodphere with the idea of this Tattwa, draw with the Cup around your Room the Greater Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram both of Water and of Earth. Then return to your seat, and for Process One, Skrying, do the following. Place the Tattwa card before you on the Altar, take the Cup in the right hand and the Pentacle in the left, and look at the symbol long and steadily until you can perceive it clearly as a thought vision when you shut your eyes. Vibrate the Names of Water and of Earth (Empeh Arsel, etc.) and try to realise the mental union more and more. It may help you to perceive it as a large cres- cent made of blue or silvery water containing a cube of yellow sand. Con- tinue trying to acquire a keen perception of the Tattwa until the Element and its shape and its qualities shall seem to have become a part of you, and you should then begin to feel as though you were one with that particular Ele- ment, completely bathed in it, and as if all other Elements were non-existent. If this be correctly done, you will find that the thought of any other Element than the one with which you are working will be distinctly distasteful to you. Having succeeded in obtaining the thought vision of the symbol, con- tinue vibrating the Divine Names with the idea well fixed in your mind of calling before you on the card a brain picture of some scene or landscape. This, when it first appears, will probably be vague, but continue to realise it more and more of whatever nature (imagination or memory, etc., (8), you may believe it to be - remembering that this is a passive state of the mind, and not yet is the time to test or reason (9). Only when the thought picture shall have become sufficiently tangible and vivid, and you find that you are beginning to lose the sense of confusion and vagueness should you begin to apply tests. Before this period, all reasoning, all doubting, is destructive to the"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Seven experiment. In all probability, the thought picture may become so clear to <34> you (though this may be a matter of time and much practice) that it will seem as though the picture were trying to precipitate through the symbol. In such a case as this there can be no difficulty, for the vision will be nearly as clear to the perception as a material one might be. But you can arrive at a great deal by merely receiving the impression of the landscape as a thought. For example, I perceive appearing an expanse of sea, a slight strip of land - high grey rocks or boulders rising out of the sea. To the left a long gallery of cliffs jutting out some distance into the sea (10). This appears suf- ficiently vivid, so I begin my tests. I suspect my memory chiefly, so I draw in front of the picture on the card, with the Lotus Wand, a large TAU in light. Then, believing that I may have constructed the scene in imagination, I now formulate on the card a large Caph. In this case, neither of these symbols banish or dim the scene in any way, so I continue. (But if the scene vanishes or changes or becomes blurred, it is well to b~nish with a Pentagram what- ever may remain on the card, and simply recommence the process at the point where you are endeavouring to attract a picture on the card.) I now draw over the picture with the Cup the water Pentagram, and with the Pentacle the Earth Pentagram (1 1) using the correct vibration. This inten- sifies the picture, and I now perceive flung into it many figures, principally of the Water spirit type. On gazing further, and repeating the vibration, I per- ceive a much larger figure than the elementals, overshadowing them, clothed in blue and white, with some glimmering of silver. To obtain detail I must work for some time longer, and must continue invoking with my water and earth Symbols, and look and test alternately. Believing that sufficient has been herein explained to enable a student to understand the general method of this process of skrying, I will proceed further to the rules for astral projection, but be it remembered that it <35> is possible to carry this vision very far indeed, and that the student should by no means stop where I have done. ASTRAL PROJECTION (12). Therefore you will follow the rules given in the preceding pages for Skrying, until the point where the symbol of the Tattwa has become per- fectly vivid to the perception and when you feel as though you were almost one with the Element. You may modlfy the earlier stages of the working by so enlarging the symbol astrally that the human being can pass through it. When very vivid, and not until then, pass, spring or fly through it, and do not begin to reason till you find yourself in some place or landscape (13). And as before, only test when the landscape shall have become a tangible and some- what complete picture. If you have made your mind a blank as much as poss- ible, the first idea that enters your mind (that is to say vividly) after you have traversed the symbol should be a correct correspondence of the Tattwa in question. Having already, by the process of skrying, obtained a vision of w ,in this particular case I will use the same symbol, on which I still perceive the reflect- ed picture, and will leap through it, and go astrally to the scene in question. I"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"Skrying and Astral Projection 4 71 therefore astrally fly or leap through it. My first impression is to find myself standing on a boulder slightly out at sea, which I had noted as an im ortant point in the picture. I realise that I am standing clothed in my @ = dinsignia and white robe, on this rock, facing the shore. Turning to the right I am conscious of the gallery of cliffs, and to the left and back of me the sea, everywhere. (On the planes, it would appear well to act exactly as one would in a physical experience or a landscape, realising each step as one goes, not trying to look on both sides at once or at the back of one's head, but turning first to <36> the right hand and examining that, and then to the left, then turning right around, and so on. It is better as much as possible to remain in one spot (until very experienced) to avoid reflexes. In fact, the more prac- tically the experiences are worked, the more chance of success.) I have an impression that the air is very cold. I stoop down and feel the rock, which I find is of a coral nature. Ihave already tested this vision in pro- cess One (skrymg), but it is well to repeat the same, to see if I am sufficiently in touch with the landscape. I therefore trace with my astral Lotus Wand the symbols I evoked before, the TAU and the CAPH, in white light, making them very forcibly. In fact, I do not cease tracing them until I actually perceive them as vividly as I do the landscape. Seeing that the scene does not vanish or become dim (14) I now with my Astral Cup and Pentacle, draw in Light very large Water and Earth Pentagrams, standing on the sea. These, even more than the former symbols should be continued and accentuated until they become to the impression of the mind as living entities as the landscape itself. If these latter be correctly drawn and sufficiently realised, there will be little chance of illusion during the rest of the experience. The drawing of these Pentagrams standing above the sea appears at once to increase the vitality of the scene, for the rather intangible Elementals and Angelic Being that I had perceived in the reflected picture became more and more real to the impression. Had I commenced at once with astral projection without the introduc- tion of my Skrying experience, I should have had probably to evoke these figures. In such a case, using the Invoking Pentagrams of Water, I should con- tinue vibrating the Deity Names, etc. of these Elements (employing as well as the names before mentioned, those of the Angels and Rulers, such names as Tharsis, Kerub, etc., being very potent) and would call upon a force <37> by right of these names and symbols to manifest, and I should con- tinue this process until some forms appeared. After careful examination, by first receiving the impression and then testing it, I can describe the following. The Angelic being, feminine in type, pale brown hair and light grey-eyes, is draped in blue and white, draperies heavy in nature, and wears a crown formed of crescents. She holds in the left hand a curious cup, heavy, and with a squarish base, and in the right a wand with a symbol much much like the positive element of Water. The Elementals vary in type, the majority being of the mermaid and merman nature, but again many tending to the Earth and Air nature. Turning to the Angelic Bein I make the @ = Signs and LVX Signs, and to the Elementals the 0 = #f and a = Signs, and by right of these"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"472 The Golden Dawn: Volume IV Book Seven (that is to say by the knowledge of the central spirit, and, in their instance of that of water and earth) I ask to have explained some of the secrets of the working of the plane of w The Angel having answered my signs by similar ones, gives the impres- sion that she is willing to instruct me. (This can enter the mind as an ex- traneous thought, or may be heard (15) clairaudiently.) She shows how even the work on this particular spot is varied, and according to the types of the Elementals is the labour allotted. Some of the Elementals tending to the gnome type are digging in the cliffs, with spiky instruments, and boring holes therein, thereby permitting the water to enter freely. (This may explain the spongy rather than broken aspect of the rock). The mermaid and merman Elementals, which are in the large majority, I think, receive some of the dust, which they carry into the sea. (Some of this may go to form islands.) Others also are bringing earth and weeds and such-like from the depths, also <38> probably to form land. There are also figures holding funnel-like Cups who rise from the sea, and having drawn air into them, dive again, carrying that element into the sea. (16) It can be understood how these investigations can be carried to very great detail, but to be as brief as possible I ask if I may be shown the effect of this Ray of W on the Universe generally and on this Planet in particular. I understand that the effect of the Ray is generating and fruchfying generally, and on the whole beneficient, though everytlung would depend on the Force with which it was united. Its correlative would be thick rich water, containing such substance. I ask for its influence on the Earth. (To do this I can show as a thought-picture this planet of ours, with its continents, seas, etc., drawn thereon, and pray this Angel to send a ray first to one spot and then to another.) In answer I perceive the ray falling right through the water of the Earth, as if the affinity lay with all land under water. '\"The Lifter of Earth in the Waters is its Name\" does the Angel say. Nearly all vegetation attracts this ray, but very especially water plants, most of all those growing under water. The Zoophyte only partially attracts it, this latter seeming rather largely composed of some active element, Fire, I think. Among animals the Ray appears to fall on the seal and hippopotamus, and has a general affinity for most amphibious animals. With fish, the link seems to be small, a tortoise, a frog, and a snail are shown me, and some water-fowl of the duck type, very few actual birds, a sea fowl to an extent. Falling on man, on the savage it would appear to be beneficial to health generally, to give a feeling of well-being, and would also govern to some extent generation. Its tendency would be to accentuate sensuality and lazi- ness. On the intellectual man it increases intuition, with some desire <39> to clothe idea with form, therefore the first vague development of form in the mind of the artist. (As before remarked, these experiences can be carried very far indeed, but as this experience has already become rather voluminous I will cease at this point - believing that sufficient is here expressed to suggest the manner of working these astral experiences generally.)

Theseare provided as"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"Skrying and Astral Projection simple examples of the technique, and the procedure to be followed. The first of them is the fiery sub-element of Earth, Tejas of Prithivi. Vestigia states that she found herself, after going through the imagined symbols, \"in a volcanic district. No fire is to be seen, but the type of land is volcanic. Hill and mountains, hot air, and sunny light. Using a Pentacle, and calling on the Earth Names, I see before me a species of Angelic King Elemental. On testing him, I find that he gives me the Neophyte Saluting Sign, and the Philosophus (Fire) Sign. He bows low to the symbols that I give him, and says that he is willing to show me some of the working of the plane. He has a beautiful face, somewhat of the Fire type, yet sweet in expression. He wears a Golden Crown, and a fiery red cloak, opening on to a yellow tunic, over which being a shirt of mail. In his right hand he bears a wand, the lower end or handle being shaped somewhat as the Pentacle implement, and the staff and upper end being as the Fire Wand. In his left hand (but this I do not clearly see) he bears a Fire Wand; I think that the right hand points upwards and the left downwards, and is a symbol to invoke forces. Little figures of the gnome type come at his call. When commanded some broke the rocky parts of the Mountain with pick-axes which they carry. Others appear to dig in the ground. In breaking off these rocky pieces, there fall away little bits of bright metal or copper. Some of these Gnomes collected the bits of metal and carried them away in little wallets slung by a baldrick from their shoulders. We followed them and came to some mountainous peaks. <44> From these peaks issued some large and fierce, some hardly perceiv- able, fires. Into cauldrons or bowls placed above these fires, the collected pieces of metal were placed. I was told that this was a lengthy pro- cess, but asked that I might see the result of what appeared to be a gradual melting of this metal. I was then shown some bowls containing liquid gold, but not I imagine, very pure metal. I again followed my guide, the Angelic King Elemental Ruler, who gave me his name as Atapa, and followed by some gnomes bearing the bowl of liquid gold, we came, after passing through many subterranean passages cut in the mountains, to a huge cavern of immense breadth and height. It was like a Palace cut out of the rock. We passed through rudely cut passages, until we reached a large central hall, at the end of which was a Dais on which were seated the King and Queen, the courtier gnomes standing around. \"This Hall seemed lighted by torches, and at intervals were roughly cut pillars. The Gnomes who accompanied us pre- sented to the King and Queen their gold. These latter commanded their attendants to remove this to another apartment. I asked the King and Queen for a further explanation, and they appointing substitutes in their absence, retire to an inner chamber which appeared more elevated than the rest. The architecture here seemed to be of a different kind. This small hall had several sides, each with a door, draped by a curtain. In the center of the Hall was a large tipod receiver containing some of the liquid gold such as that we had brought with us. The King and Queen who before had worn the colours of Earth now donned, he the red, and she the white garments. They then with their Earth-Fire Wands invoked and joined their wands over the Tripod. There appeared in the air above, a figure such as Atapa, he who had brought me here. He, extending his wand, and invoking, caused to appear from each"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"4 76 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Seven door a figure of a planetary or zodiacal nature. These each in turn held out his wand over the gold, using some sigil which I can but dimly follow. <45> The gold each time appearing to undergo a change. When these last figures have retired again behind the curtains, the King and Queen used a species of ladle and compressed together the gold, making it into solid shapes and placing one of these at each of the curtained doors. Some gold still remained in the bowl. The King and Queen departed, and it seemed to me that I saw a figure again appear from behind each curtain and draw away the pieces of gold.\" The second one I shall quote is a vision of Spirit of Water, Akasa of Apas, also by Vestigia. \"A wide expanse of water with many reflections of bright light, and occasionally glimpses of rainbow colours appearing (perhaps symbolising the beginning of formation in Water). When divine and other names were pronounced, elementals of the mermaid and merman type appear, but few of other elemental forms. These water forms are extremely changeable, one moment appearing as solid mermaids and mermen, the next melting into foam. \"Raising myself by means of the highest symbols I have been taught, and vibrating the names of Water, I rose until the Water vanished, and instead I beheld a mighty world or globe, with its dimensions and divisions of Gods, Angels, elementals, demons-the whole universe of Water (like the tablet ruled by EMPEH ARSEL GAIOL), I called on this latter name, and the Universe seemed to vivlfy more and more. I then called on HCOMA, and there appeared standing before me a mighty Archangel (with four wings) robed in glistening white, and crowned. In one hand, the right, he held a species of trident, and in the left a Cup filled to the brim with an essence which appeared to be derived from above. This essence, brimming over, poured down below on either side. From the overflowing or overrunning of this Cup, which derives its essence from Atziluth, apparently the cup being in Briah, the World of Yetzirah obtains its moisture. It is there differentiated into its various operative forces. \"These operative forces are represented by Angels each with <46> their respective office in the world of moisture. These forces working in Yetsirah, when descending and mingling with the Kether of Assiah, are initiating the force of that which we as human beings call Moisture.\" THE VISION OF THE UNIVERSAL MERCURY \"We stood upon a dark and rocky cliff that overhung the restless seas.

In the construction of a Talisman, care should be taken to make it, as far as is possible, so to represent the Universal Forces that it should be in exact harmony with those you wish to attract, and the more exact the symbolism, the more easy it is to attract the force - other things coinciding, such as consecration at the right time, etc. A SYMBOL should also be correct in its symbolism, but it is not neces- sarily the same as a Talisman. A FLASHING TABLET is one made in the complementary colours. A flashing colour, then, is the complementary colour which, if joined to the original, enables it to attract, to a certain extent, the Akasic current from the atmosphere, and to a certain extent from yourself, thus forming a vortex which can attract its flashing light from the atmosphere. Therefore, to make anything of this description which shall be really operative, so does it pro- portionately tire you. The complementary colours are: White complementary to Black and Grey Red complementary to Green Blue complementary to Orange Yellow complementary to Violet Olive complementary to Violet Blue Green complementary to Red-Orange Violet complementary to Citrine Reddish Orange complementary to Green Blue Deep Amber complementary to Indigo Lemon Yellow complementary to Red Violet Yellow Green complementary to Crimson <52> The other complementaries of other mixed colours can easily be found from this scale. Coming now to the nature and method of formation of the Talisman, the first thing to be remembered is that it is not always a just and right thing to form a Talisman with the idea of completely changing the current of another person's Karma. In any case you could only do this in a certain sense. It will be remembered that the words of the CHRIST which preceded His cures were \"Thy sins be forgiven thee,\" which meant that the Karmic action was ex- hausted. Only an Adept who is of the nature of a God can have the power, even if he have the right, to take upon himself the Karma of another. That is to say, that if you endeavour to change completely, (I am not now speaking of adapting and making the best of a person's Karma), the life current, you must 479"},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Seven be of so great a force that you can take this Karma from them by right of the Divine Power to which you have attained - in which case you will only do it in so far as it does not hinder their spiritual development. If, however, this is attempted on a lower plane, it will usually be found that what you are endeavouring to bring about is in direct opposition to the Karma of the person concerned. It will not work the required effect and will probably bring a current of exhaustion and trouble on yourself. Without doing much good you will have attracted his own Karma into your own at- mosphere and, in fact, brought it on yourself. These remarks only apply to an attempted radical change in the Karma of another, which is a thing you have no right to do until you have attained the highest adeptship. The formation or adaptation of Talismans in ordinary matters should be employed with great discernment. What may assist in material things is often a hindrance spiritually, seeing that for a force to work, it must attract <53> elemental forces of the proper description, which may thus, to an extent, endanger your spiritual nature. Also, in making Talismans for a person, you must endeavour to isolate yourself entirely from him. You must banish from your mind any feeling of love or hate, irritation, etc., for all these feelings operate against your power. It is but rarely that a Talisman for the love of a person is a right and justifi- able thing to construct. Pure love links us to the nature of the Gods. There is a perfect love between the Angels and the gods because there is perfect har- mony among them, but that is not the lower and earthly love. Thus a Talis- man made for terrestrial love would be sealed with the impress of your own weakness, and even if successful, would read on you in other ways. The only way in which real power can be gained, is by transcending the material plane and trying to link yourself to your Divine and Higher Soul. That is why trou- ble is so great an initiator, because trouble brings you nearer spiritual things when material things fail. Therefore, a Talisman as a rule is better made for one in whom you have no interest. In the work of actual consecration, it is always a good thing to punfy the room and use the Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. All these are aids which the Adept, when sufficiently advanced, will know when to use and when not to do so. It is better, if possible, to finish a Talisman at one sit- ting, because it is begun under certain conditions and it may be difficult to put yourself in the same frame of mind at another time. Another point that beginners are apt to run away with, is that Talismans can be made wholesale. Suppose a dozen Talismans were made to do good to as many different people, a ray from yourself must charge each Talisman. You have sent out a sort of spiral from your aura which goes on to the Talis- man and attracts a like force from the atmosphere - that is, if you have learned to excite the like force in yourself at the moment of consecra- <54> tion. So that, in the case supposed, you would have a dozen links con- necting with you, like so many wires in a telegraph office, and when- ever the force which any of these Talismans was designed to combat be- comes too strong for the force centred therein, there is an instahtaneous"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"Talismans and Sigils 481 communication with you - so that the loss of force to which you would be continually liable might be such as to deplete you of vitality and cause you to faint. In cases where Talismans and symbols have done their work, they should be carefully de-charged, and then destroyed. If this is not done, and you take a symbol, say of water, still charged and throw it into the fire to get rid of it, you are inflicting intense torment on the Elemental you have attract- ed, and it will re-ad on you sooner or later. Also, if you throw away a still charged Talisman, thus desecrating it, it will become the property of other things, which, through it, will be enabled to get at you. It is for these reasons that the Talisman should be de-charged with the Pentagram and Hexagram according as it partakes of the planetary or zodiacal nature - and these remarks apply equally to Flashing Tablets. If a Talisman is given to a person who goes away, and does not return it, you can render it inoperative by invoking it astrally and then de-charging it with great care and force. A FLASHING TABLET should be carefully made charged, and conse- crated, and then each morning the Adeptus should sit before it and practise clairvoyance, endeavouring to go through it to the plane it represents, and then to invoke the power and ask for strength to accomplish the matter desired, which will be granted if it be a lawful and laudable operation. Any Flashing Tablet of two colours should be as nearly balanced in pro- portion of the extent of colour as possible - the ground one colour, and the charge another. There is also a mode in which three colours can be <55> used in a planetary talisman. This is done by placing the seven colours on the Heptagram, and drawing two lines to the points exac- tly opposite, which will thus yield two flashing colours. This properly drawn, will give the effect of a flashing light playing on the symbol, partly visible physically and partly clairvoyantly, i.e., if properly charged. An advanced Adept should be able to charge his Tablet to a certain extent as he con- structs it. The radical colour of the Planet is symbolical. But a Talisman for har- mony of idea say, could be well represented by the TIPHARETH of VENUS - a beautiful yellow-green, and so on. The Lion Kerub of VENUS would represent spiritual fire and thus sym- bolises the inspiration of the poet - the colour being a soft and beautiful pearl grey, and the charges should be white. The Watery part of Venus would represent the reflective faculty and answer to spiritual beauty, colour a bluish-green. The Vault contains a perfect scale of Talismans of every de- scription of Planet, and shows how a planetary man will look at everything according to the colour of his aura, due to the planet under which he is born. The real Adept comes forth from the sides to the centre. He is no longer under the dominion of the Stars. Having made a Magical Talisman, you should use some form of charg- ing and consecrating it, which is suitable to the operation. There are certain words and Letters which are to be invoked in the charging of a Tablet, the Let- ters governing the Sign under which the operation falls, together with the Planet associated therewith (if a planetary Talisman). ThuS, in Elemental"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"482 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Seven operations, you take the Letters of the appropriate zodiacal triplicity, adding AL thereto, thus forming an Angelic Name which is the expression of the force. Hebrew Names as a rule, represent the operation of certain general forces, while the names on the Enochian or Angelical Tablets represent a species of more particular ideas. Both classes of Names should be used in these operations. <56> After preparing the room in the way laid down for the consecra- tion of lesser magical implements, supposing this to be an Elemental Talisman, first formulate towards the Four Quarters the Supreme Ritual of the Pentagram as taught. Then invoke the Divine Names, turning towards the quarter of the Element. Let the Adeptus then, being seated or standing before the Tablet, and looking in the requisite direction of the force which he wishes to invoke, take several deep inspirations, close the eyes, and holding the breath, mentally pronounce the letters of the Forces invoked. Let this be done several times, as if you breathed upon the Tablet pronouncing them in the vibratory manner. Then, rising, make the sign of the Rose and Cross over the Tablet, and repeat- ing the requisite formula, first describe round the Talisman, a circle, with the appropriate magical implement, and then make the invoking Pentagrams five times over it, as if the Pentagrams stood upright upon it, repeating the let- ters of the Triplicity involved with AL added. Then solemnly read any invocation required, making the proper sigils from the Rose as you pro- nounce the Names. The first operation is to initiate a whorl from yourself. The second, to attract the force in the atmosphere into the vortex you have formed. Then read the Elemental Prayer as in the Rituals, and close with the Signs of the circle and the cross (that is the Rose-Cross) after performing the necessary Banishing. Be careful, however, not to banish over the newly consecrated Talisman, as that would simply decharge it again and render it useless. Before Banish- ing, you should wrap the charged Talisman in clean white silk or linen. <57> SIGILS In the Opening Ceremony of the grade of @ = Adeptus Minor, the Complete Symbol of the Rose and Cross is called the \"Key of Sigils and of Rituals,\" and it is further said that it represents the Forces of the 22 Letters in Nature, as divided into a Three, a sevin, and a Twelve. (See Diagram 20, Pg. 56 of Vol. 111) The inner Three Petals of the Rose symbolise the active Elements of Air, Fire, and Water, operating in the Earth, which is as it were the recipient of them, their container and ground of operation. They are coloured, as are all the other petals, according to the hues of the Rainbow in the masculine (posi- tive) scale. The seven next Petals answer to the Letters of the Seven Planets, and the Twelve Outer to the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac. Now if thou wilt trace the Sigd of any word or name either in the Air, or written upon paper, thou shalt commence with a circle at the point of the ini- tial letter on the Rose, and draw with thy magical weapon a line from this cir- cle unto the place of the next letter of the name. Continue this, until thou hast"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"Talismans and Sigils 483 finished the word which the letters compose. If two letters of the same sort, such as two Beths or Gimels, come together, thou shalt represent the same by a crook or wave in the line at that point. And if there be a letter, as Resh in Metatron, through which the line passeth to another letter and which yet formeth part of the name, thou shalt make a noose in the line at that point thus: 0 to mark the same. If thou art drawing the Sigil thou mayest work it in the respective colours of the letters and add these together to form a synthesis of colour. Thus the Sigil of Metatron shall be: blue, greenish-yellow, orange, red-orange, and greenish- blue: the synthesis will be a reddish-citron. (Note: If the reader will draw a Rose, copied from the complete symbol of the Rose-Cross, about three-and-a-half to four inches in diameter, and trace the above Sigds on a piece of fairly transparent paper placed over the Rose, he will learn for himself how these Sigds are drawn. He should experi- ment tracing half a dozen or so of these.-I.R.) Now we will trace, for example, the Sigils of the Forces under Binah, the Third Sephirah. Incidentally, the Sigils for the plane of a Sephirah are always worked out on this system in this order: First. Sigil of the Sephirah-Binah. Second. Sigil of the Divine Name, representing the force of the Sephirah in the World of Atziluth. For Binah, YHVH ELOHIM. Third. The Sigil of the Archangel, representing the force of the Sephirah in Briah-Tzaphqiel. Fourth. Sigd of the Choir of Angels, representing the force of the Sephirahin Yetzirah-Aralim. Fifth. The Sigil of the Sphere of the Planet representing the force of the Sephirah in Assiah-Shabbathai. Finally, the Sigils of any other names whose numbers have some relation to the powers of the Sephirah or its Planet. <60> Yet these latter (the Sigils of the Intelligence and Spirit) are more usually taken from the Magical Kamea or Square of the Planets according to a slightly different system as will be shown hereafter."},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":". 1.

The Sigil shall then serve thee for the tracing of a Current which shall call into action a certain Elemental Force. And know thou that this is not to be done lightly for thine amusement or experiment, seeing that the Forces of Nature were not created to be thy plaything or toy. Unless thou doest thy practical magical works with solemnity, ceremony and reverence, thou shalt be like an infant playing with fire, and thou shalt bring destruction upon thyself. Know, then, that if thou essay in the imagination to form an astral image from the Names, the first letter shall be the head of the Figure or Form, and the final letter shall be its feet. The other letters shall be, and represent in their order, its body and members. AGIEL, for example, shall give thee an Angelic Form of the following nature and appearance: Aleph, Air. The head winged, and of a golden colour, with long floating golden hair. Gimel, Luna. Crowned with bluish silver crescent, and with a face like that of a grave and beautiful woman, with a bluish halo. Yod, Virgo. The body of a maiden clothed in grass green robe. Aleph, Air.

The Keys of the Tarot may help thee in the form. <62> See well also that thou makest the Image as pure and beautiful as possible, for the more impure or common the figure, the more dangerous is it unto thee. Write upon the breast its Sigil, upon the girdle its Name, and place clouds below the feet. And when thou hast done this with due solemnity and rigid correctness of symbolism, shunning as thou wouldst shun death any suggestion of coarseness or vulgarity in an Angelic symbol, then hear what it shall say unto thee. Seraphim will give thee an Angelic Figure like a Wamoress with Flame playing about her, and a countenance glorious like the Sun, and beneath her feet the stormy Sea and thunder clouds, and lightning about her, and a glow as of Flame. She has a triangular helmet or head-dress of Flame like the sym- bol of Fire. Graphiel will give thee a Great Angel like a Female Wamor with a most glorious countenance, crowned with the Crescent and flashing with Light, and surrounded by Flame and Lightning and with Four Wings.

Unless this is done, it is dangerous to vibrate only with the astralforces, because the vibra- tion attracts a certain force to the operator, and the nature of the force attrad- ed rests largely on the condition of mind in which the operator is. The ordinary mode of vibrating is as follows: Take a deep and <63> full inspiration and concentrate your consciousness in your heart, which answers to Tiphareth. (Having first, as already said, ascended to your Kether, you should endeavour to bring down the white Brilliance into your heart, prior to centering your consciousness there.) Then formulate the letters of the Name required in your heart, in white, and feel them written there. Be sure to formulate the letters in brilliant white light, not merely in dull whiteness as the colour of the Apas Tathva. Then, emitting the breath, slowly pronounce the Letters so that the sound vibrates within you, and imagine that the breath, while quitting the body, swells you so as to fill up space. Pronounce the Name as if you were vibrating it through the whole Universe, and as if it did not stop until it reached the further limits. All practical occult work which is of any use, tires the operator or withdraws some magnetism, and therefore, if you wish to do anything that is at all important, you must be in perfect magnetic and nervous condition, or else you will do evil instead of good. When you are using a Name and drawing a Sigil from the Rose, you must remember that the Sephirah to which the Rose and Cross are referred, is Tiphareth, whose position answers to the position of the heart, as if the Rose were therein. It is not always necessary to formulate before youinspace the telesmatic angelic figure of the Name. As a general rule, pronounce the Name as many times as there are letters in it. <64> FURTHER ON TELESMATIC FIGURES As before taught the Names of all Angels and Angelic Forces terminate, with few exceptions, in either AL or YAH. The Divine Name AL belongs to Chesed and it represents a good, powerful, and mighty force, but of some- what milder operation than the Name YAH. Since not only the Angels but even devils are said to draw their force and power directly from the prolific source of the divine energies, therefore frequently to the names of evil spirits, is AL added. The Name YAH is added to the name of an Angel or Spirit who exercises only a good and somewhat beneficent office. This being understood, these two terminations being rather in the nature of incidental attributions than of essential distinction, they need not be taken too much notice of in the construction of a telesmatic image. In building up such an image, you can either imagine it astrally before you, or paint the actual resemblance. Care should however be taken to pro-"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"488 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Seven nounce the Divine Names belonging to the world under which the teles- matic image under course of construction would fall. Thus to ATZILUTH are allotted Deific Names. To BRIAH, Archangelic and so on. It is also useful to employ the Sephirotic Nameswhich are comprised in the special world to which the Telesmatic Image is allotted. It is well to note that the four Worlds themselves formulate the Law involved in the building up or expression of any material thing. The world of ATZILUTH is purely archetypal and primordial, and to it, as before said, Deific Names are applied. BRIAH is creative and originative, and to it certain Great Gods called Archangels are allotted. YETZIRAH is formative and Angelic Orders are allotted thereunto. ASSIAH which is the material world consists of the great Kingdoms of the Elementals, human beings, and <65> in some cases of the Qlippoth - though these latter really occupy the planes below Assiah. From these remarks it will be seen that a Telesmatic Image can hardly apply to Atziluth; that to Briah it can only do so in a restricted sense. Thus a Telesmatic Image belonging to that world would have to be represented with a kind of concealed head, possessing a form shadowy and barely indicated. Telesmatic Images, then, really belong to YETZIRAH. Therefore it would be impossible to employ the telesmatic image of a Divine Name in Atziluth, for it would not represent that in the world of Atziluth, but rather its correlation in Yetzirah. In Assiah you would get Elemental forms. The sex of the figure depends upon the predominance of the masculine or the feminine in the whole of the Letters together, but a jumble of the sexes should be avoided in the same form. The image built up should be divided into as many parts as there are letters, commencing at the upper part and so on in order. In addition to this method of determining the sex of the Teles- matic Image of a Name, certain Names are inherently masculine, others feminine, and some epicene, irrespective of the mere testimony of the Letters. SANDALPHON, for instance is thus analysed: SAMEKH Male PEH Female NUN Male VAU Male DALETH Female NUN Male LAMED Female Therefore masculine predominates, and if it were an ordinary Name you would make a masculine Form out of it. But as this Name is especially applied to the feminine Kerub, it is an exception to the rule; it is an Archangelic Name, belonging to the Briatic World and not merely an Angelic Name relat- ing to Yetzirah. SANDALPHON is also called Yeher, meaning \"left,\" and its letters are: female, female and male, so that, in this case, it may be any of these. <66> The Seven Letters composing the Name SANDALPHON are thus adapted to the Telesmatic Image. SAMEKH Head. Would represent a beautiful and active face rather thin than fat. NUN Neck, would be admirably full."},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"Talismans and Sigils DALETH Shoulders of a beautiful woman. LAMED Heart and chest, the latter perfectly proportioned. PEH Hips strong and full. VAU Legs massive. NUN Feet sinewy and perhaps winged. If it be desired to build up an elemental form out of this Name a very peculiar figure would result. SAMEKH Head fierce, but rather beautiful. Blue NUN Neck with eagle's wings from behind. Blue-green DALETH Shoulders feminine, rather beautiful. Green-blue LAMED Chest of a woman. Emerald PEH Strong and shaggy hips and thighs. Red VAU Legs of a Bull. Red-orange NUN (final) Feet of an Eagle. Green-blue This it will be seen, is almost a synthetical Kerubic Figure. This figure may be represented, as it were, with its feet on the Earth, and its head in the clouds. The colours in the scale of the King would synthesize as a delicate and sparkl- ing green. The uncovered parts of the body would be blue, the countenance belonging to Sagittarius would be almost that of a horse. The whole form would be like that of a goddess between ATHOR and NEITH holding a bow and arrows, that is if represented as an Egyptian symbol. If again, we endeavour to translate this Name into symbols on a <67> Tattwic Plane, we get the following: SAMEKH comes under FIRE NUN comes under WATER DALETH comes under WATER OF EARTH LAMED comes under AIR PEH comes under FIRE NUN comes under WATER. These would be synthesized thus: A silver crescent on a red tiangle placed over a yellow square. All three would be charged and enclosed within a large silver crescent. Now, taking an example, the Telesmatic Image appertaining to the Let- ter ALEPH. This on the Briatic Plane, would be rather masculine than feminine and would be resumed by a spiritual figure hardly visible at all, the head-dress winged, the body cloud-veiled and wrapped in mist, as if clouds were rolling over and obscuring the outline, and scarcely permitting the legs and feet to be seen. It represents the Spirit of Ether. In the Yetziratic World, it would be like a Warrior with winged helmet, the face angelic but rather fierce, the body and arms mailed and bearing a child - the legs and feet with mailed buskins and wings attached to them. In ASSIAH, this same letter ALEPH is terrific energy and represents, as it were,mad force (the shape of the Letter is almost that of a Swastika). On the human plane, it would represent a person who was a lunatic and at times given to frightful fits of mania. Translated to the elemental plane, it would represent a form whose body fluctuated between a man and an animal, and"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"490 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Seven indeed, the Assiatic form would be a most evil type with a force something like that compounded of that of a bird and that of a demon - an altogether horrible result. The Letter ALEPH represents spirituality in high things, but when translated to the plane contiguous to or below Assiah is usually <68> something horrible and unbalanced, because it is so opposed to mat- ter that the moment it is involved therein, there is no harmony be- tween them. Radiating forces of Divine Light, otherwise called Angelic Forms, have not gender in the grosser acceptation of the term, though they can be classed according to the masculine and feminine sides. As, for example, in the human figure, sex is not so strongly marked in the upper part, the head, as in the body, while yet the countenance can be distinctly classed as of a rnas- culine or a feminine type. So, also, on quitting the material plane, sex be- comes less marked, or rather appreciable in a different manner, though the distinction of masculine or feminine is retained. And herein is the great error of the Phallic Religions - that they have transferred the material and gross side of sex to Divine and Angelic planes, not understanding that it is the lower that is derived from the higher by correlation in material development, and not the higher from the lower. Gender, in the usual meaning of the term, belongs to the Elemental Spirits, Kerubic Forms, Fays, Planetary Spirits and Olympic Spirits - also to the Qlippoth in its most exaggerated and bestial aspects, and this is a ratio increasing in proportion to the depths of their de- scent. Also, in certain of the evil Elemental Spirits, it would be exaggerated and repulsive. But, in the higher and angelic natures, gender is correlated by forms, either steady and firm, or rushing. Firmness like that of a rock or pillar is the nature of the feminine; restlessness and movement, that of the Masculine. Therefore, let this be clearly understood in ascribing gender to angelic forms and images. Our tradition classes all forces under the heads of vehement and rushing force, and firm and steady force. Therefore a figure representing the former would be a masculine and that representing the latter, a feminine form. But for convenience in the formation of Telesmatic images of ordinary occult names and words, the letters are arranged in masculine and feminine classification. This classification is not intended to affirm that the let- <69> ters have not in themselves both natures (seeing that in each letter as in each Sephirah is hidden the dual nature of masculine and fem- inine) but shows more their tendency as regards the distinction of force beforementioned. Those, then, are rather masculine than feminine to which are allotted forces more rapid in action. And those, again, are rather feminine than mas- culine which represent a force more firm and steady whence all letters whose sound is prolonged as if moving forward are rather masculine than feminine. Certain others are epicene, yet incline rather to one nature than to another."},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"Talismans and Sigils TELESMATIC ATTRIBUTIONS OF THE LETTERS OF THE HEBREW ALPHABET ALEPH.

Concentrate upon your Tiphareth, the centre about the heart, and draw down into it the White Rays from above. Formulate the letters in White Light in your heart. Inspire deeply, and then pronounce the Letters of the Name, vibrating each through your whole system - as if setting into vibra- tion the Air before you, and as if that vibration spread out into space. The Whiteness should be brilliant. The Sigils are drawn from the lettering of the Rose upon the Cross, (See pg. 56, Vol. 111) and these are in Tiphareth, which corresponds to the heart. Draw them as if the Rose were in your heart. In vibrating any Name, pronounce it as many times as it has letters. This is the Invoking Whirl. Example: The Vibration of Adonai Ha-Aretz.

FURTHER CONCERNING THE FORMATION OF TELESMATIC IMAGES (Note: This is a precis of the document numbered \"M\" - Lecture on the Lineal Forms of the Names of the Sephiroth.-1.R)"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"Talismans and Sigils 493 Translate the letters of the Name of each Sephirah into the numerical equivalents whichwill be yielded by reference to the Qabalah of Nine Cham- bers. If these letters and numbers are again translated into their Yetziratic attributions and combined with the lineal figures represented by the num- bers, an analysis of the name is obtained compounded of two scales of interpretation. For instance, in the case of Kether, the letters are Kaph, Tau, Resh. Caph is referred in the Sepher Yetzirah to Jupiter, Tau to Saturn, and Resh to the Sun. Again, the lineal figure of Caph, which reduces to the number 2 by Aiq Bkr or the Qabalah of Nine Chambers, will be the Cross. Tau reduces to 4, whose lineal figure is the square. Resh reduces also to 2, symbolised likewise by the Cross. There are three letters in the name Kether - which itself, as a whole, may be symbolised by a triangle. If the above symbolic lineal figures are placed within the lineal figure of the whole Name, the Triangle, \"a species of Hieroglyphic form of each Sephirah will result. This may <73> again be represented by a cognate Angelic form, as taught in the For- mation of Sigds from the Rose.\" The Yetziratic attributions will yield the information as to what colours, symbols, etc. are to be used in formulating the Image. The same principle applies to the remaining Sephirotic names. <74> TALISMANS AND SIGILS There are innumerable methods of forming Sigils for use in connection with Talismans and their construction. One method, using the Rose of the Zelator Adeptus Minor, has previously been described. In the Order this was the method most often used. Herein, will be found methods of forming talis- manic emblems and sigils from the Kameas of the Planets, or their Magical Squares, and also from the Geomantic points and symbols. So far as the Geomantic symbols are concerned, the student will do well to become acquainted with the instruction on Geomancy in the section on Divination. (Pg. 112-136, Vol. IV) After having become fully acquainted with the names of the symbols, and their forms, as well as having obtained some experience of divination by that method, let him note that geomantic sigils or Talismanic emblems, as they are sometimes called, are formed from the Geomantic figures by drawing various lines from point to point. These characters are then attributed to their ruling planets and ideas. The simplest form of each will be found on page 75. Innumerable more sigils, and a host of other designs may be formed from the fundamental Geomantic symbols. As many as ten or a dozen dif- ferent emblems may be derived from two or three of the symbols. If the stu- dent uses a little ingenuity and imagination in this matter, he will discover quite a lot as to the nature and import of Sigils. The significance of the emblems may be divined, from one point of view, by employing them as \"doors\" through which to skry in the spirit-vision. More can be learned this way concerning the real implication of Sigils than almost by any other method."},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"The Golden Dawn: Volume ZV Book Seven The signatures and Seals of the Angels and Genii who rule over each of the symbols may be found in the full instruction on Geomancy.

Occasionally, a square of any convenient"},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"496 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Smen number of compartments may be substituted for the wheel or one form may be used for the obverse and the other for the reverse of the Talisman. Sigils of the Planetary Squares Another very important mode of forming Sigils anciently was through the medium of the Kameas of the Planets, or the Magical squares. Magical squares are arrangements of numbers so arranged as to yield the same num- ber when added horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Also the sum of the total of all the numbers in the square is a number of special significance to the planet to which that square is referred. The method of forming Sigils from these is very simple. The knowl- edge of how this was done, however, had, during the time of my membership in the Order, completely faded from memory, and none of the members or the Chiefs of the Temple could give any information. Yet this was the prin- cipal method employed by the traditional authorities in obtaining Sigils. The method of using the Rose-Cross is an anachronism, and while in certain instances it is very useful or perhaps the most convenient mode, it has no root in antiquity. Not only had the knowledge of Sigils from the Karneas faded from the Order, but the Chiefs even eliminated the magical squares from the knowledge lectures. It was claimed that a number of mistakes had <79> crept into the numbers on the squares. Had they known it, the method and the correct form of the Squares were in certain books and manuscripts in the British Museum. None of them, however, made the least attempt to recover the true or accurate form of the Kameas. The sole requisite to tracing Sigils of the Planetary names formed from the Kameas isAiq Beker, or the Qabalah of Nine Chambers. (Incidentally, this too was eliminated from the knowledge lectures.) By this method, the letters of the Hebrew Alphabet are grouped together according to the similarity of their numbers.

The name of the method obtains from the letters placed in the first two chambers. In the first chamber are Aleph, Yod, and Qoph, whose num- bers are 1,10, and 100, while in the second chamber are Beth, Caph, Resh-2, 20, and 200-thus Aiq Bkr. The usual form is given below; while there is another method of using the same grouping of letters and numbers but plac- ing them in chambers referred to the Sephiroth. Now in order to find the Sigil of a Name by using the Kamea, it is necessary to reduce those letters and their numbers to tens or units by means of the above quoted scheme. For example, in the case, say, of Zuzel, the Spirit of Saturn, the letters are Zayin 7, Aleph 1, Zayin 7, and Lamed 30. The only letter which requires reduction in this instance will be Lamed which reduces to 3. The next step is to trace a line on the square following the succes- <80> sion of numbers. Thus, in the name of Zazel, the line will follow the numbers 7,1, return to 7 again, and then to 3. A little circle should be placed on the first letter of the Sigil to show where the name begins. The so-called Seal or Sigil of the Planet is a symmetrical design so arranged that its lines pass through every number on the square. The Seal thus becomes an epitome or synthesis of the Kamea. Below are given the Karneas of the seven planets together with the traditional Seals of their Planets, Intelligences, and Spirits. The student will do well to attempt to work these out himself. I shall give one more example of a more difficult kind, in order that no misunderstanding may exist about the method of Sigil formation. The name Taphthartharath is the Spirit of Mercury, and his Sigil would be traced upon the magical Square having 64 squares, 8 on each side. The attribution of Squares to planets follows the attribution of the Sephiroth on the Tree of Life; thus Mercury is referred to the eighth Sephirah HOD. Now Taphthartharath is composed of seven letters, Tau 400, Peh 80, Tau 400, Resh 200, Tau 400, Resh 200, and Tau 400. This will reduce by Aiq Beker to 40,8,40, 20,40,20,40. A continuous line will be traced beginning with a circle in the square of 40, and moving to each of the numbers quoted. All the other Sigils follow this same rule. There are also appended the Sigils and attributions of the Olympic Planetary Spirits. Nothing was known in the Order about them, and they too were extirpated from the papers. More information may be found in the Hcp- tameron of Pietro de Abano.

The Seals and Names of the Intelligences should be used on all Talismans for a good effect. Those of the Spirits of the Planets serve for evil, and should therefore not be used in any operation of a benefi- cial kind.

Thus to make use of, when it is absolutely necessary to do so, the Sigils of the Spirits, the Seals and Names of the Intelligences should be inscribed on the same Talisman as well.

It has also been conveyed to me that the American temples, under the Mathers and Brodie Innes jurisdiction, circulated this document.

The mode of skrying in the Spirit-visionusing the Tattwa symbols is sound enough, and has been described elsewhere. But other aspects suggest that the two sys- tems are not likely to mix particularly well.

General Observation. There are five Tattwas or Principles: 1. Akasa-Ether. 2. Vayu-the Aerial principle. 3. Tejas-the Principle of Light and Heat. 4. Apas-Watery Principle. 5. Prithivi-the Earthly Principle. But the first Cause of these is the Great Controller of all things, the One Light, the Formless. From Him first came into appearance Ether; thence the Air, the motion producing Ether waves which causes Light and Heat, and so on in the above order. 514"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"The Yogi comes to know the principle of these five Tattwas, their Sukshma Sharira, but how? Further on you will see how. The Astrologer who has no knowledge of the Swara is as worthless as a man without a wife. It is the soul itself; it is the Swara, the Great Controller of all, who creates, pre- serves, and destroys, and causes whatsoever is in this World. Experience and Tradition both say no knowledge is more precious than this knowledge of the Swara. None else lays bare the workings of the machinery of this world, or the secret workings of this world. By the power of Swara may be destroyed an enemy. Power, wealth, and pleasure, all these can be commanded by Swara. The beginner in our <97> Science must be pure and calm in mind and in thought, virtuous in actions, and having unmixed faith in his spiritual teacher. He must be strong in his determination, and grateful. Swara in the Body. Ten manifestations of this Swara are in the body. But before the Neophyte is told this, he must gain a thorough knowledge of the nervous system. This is very important, and according to his knowledge of this science, the Neophyte gains success. To give a rough outline of the parts we have chiefly to deal with in our endeavour to explain the elementary treatise: There are ten principal nerves, this includes the tubes, etc. It is in the ten manifestations of Swara that the ten so-called Vayus move. We mean by this ten forces which perform ten different functions. The three most irnpor- tant nerves are the following, as the beginner has only to deal with these: 1. Ida-the left bronchus. 2. Pingala-the right bronchus. 3. Sushumna-in the middle. The ten Vayus are: 1. Prana, in the breast. 2. Apana, about the excretory organs. 3. Samana, in the navel. 4. Undana, middle of the throat. 5. Vyana, pervading the whole body. 6. Kurmana, the eyes, helping them open. 7. KirMa, in the stomach, producing hunger. 8. Nag, whence comes vomiting. 9. Devadatta, causes yawning. 10. Dhananjaya, that which doth not leave the body after death. These ten vayus, or forces, have their play in the ten principal nerves, not one in each. They are the regulators of the body of man. If they go on working properly, a man remains perfectly healthy; if not, different kinds of diseases spring up. <98> A Yogi keeps them always working, and consequently diseases never come to him. The key to all these nerves lies in the working of the Prana Vayu, or vital principle drawing the air through the Ida, the Pingala, and the Sushumna. When the Air is drawn through the Ida it is felt coming out or going in through the left nostril. When through the Pingala, in the right nostril. When through the Sushumna it is felt through both nostrils simul- taneously. The air is drawn or felt through either or both of the nostrilsat cer- tain appointed times. Whenever in any given time, the Breath goes in and"},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"516 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Seven comes out of the wrong nostril it is a sure sign some sort of disease is coming on. The Ida is sometimes called the Chandra Nadi, or the Moon Nerve. The Pingala, the Surya Nadi or Sun nerve. These are called, the former, the Chan- dra Swara and the latter the Surya Swara. The reason is that when the breath is in the Ida it gives coolness to the body, and that when in the Pingala it gives heat to the body. The Ancient Magi used to say the place of the Moon in the human body was in Ida, and the Sun in Pingala. The Course of the Breath. The Lunar month, it is well known, is divided into two parts, the fortnight of the Waxing and the fortnight of the Waning. On the first fortnight, or the Bright Fortnight, just at Sunrise of the first day the Breath must come into the left nostril and must be so for three days suc- cessively. At the beginning of the 4th day the Breath must come through the right nostril and must do so for the three succeeding days, when again the 7th day must begin with the Moon breath, and so on in the same order. Thus we have said that such and such days begin with such and such a breath. But how long is our breath to remain in one nostril? For five Gharis, or 2 hours. Thus when the first day of the Bright fortnight begins with the Moon Breath, after five Gharis, the Sun Breath must set in, and this again <99> must change into the Moon Breath after the same interval of time. So on for every day. Again, the first day of the dark fortnight must begin with the Sun Breath, and proceed in the same way, changing after five Gharis and the three suc- ceeding days. It will be seen that all the days of the month have been divided into the Ida and the Pingala. In the Susharnna, the Swara flows only when it changes, either in its natural course or in certain other conditions to be after- wards mentioned. This is the course of Nature. But a Yogi commands Nature. He turns everythmg into his own way. Rules for this will be given in the prop er place. COURSE OF THE TATTWAS For five Gharis, as we have above said, the breath flows through our nos- trils. In these 5 Gharis, or two hour periods, the Tattwas have their course. In the first we have Akasa, in the second Vayu, in the third Tejas, in the fourth Apas, in the fifth Prithivi. Thus in one night and day, or 60 Gharis, we have twelve courses of these 5 Tattwas each remaining one Ghari and returning again in two hours. There are again further five subdivisions of each Tattwa in a Ghari. Thus, Akawa is subdivided into Akas-Akasa; Akas-Vayu; Akas- Tejas; Akas-Apas; Alas-Prithivi - and similarly with the other four. How to know which of the Tattwas is at a certain time in course, not merely by a mathematical calculation but with the certainty of an eye witness, is of the greatest importance in the practical part of this science. We shall come to it further on. The Ida. When the Breath is in Ida, that is in the left Nostril: then only is it well to perform the following actions. Stable works such as erecting a build- ing, or the construction of a well or tank, going on a distant journey, entering a new house, collection of things, giving gifts, marriage, making jewels or"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"Tattwas 517 clothes, taking medicines and tonics, seeing a superior or master for <loo> any purpose of trade, amassing of wealth, sowing of seed in a field, negotiations, commencement of trade, seeing of friends, works of charity and faith, going home, buying of animals, doing work for the benefit of others, placing money on security, singing, dancing, taking up abode in any village or city, drinking or making water at the time of sorrow, pain, fever, etc. All these acts should be done when the Swara is in Ida. It must however be kept in mind that the Tattwas Vayu and Tejas are to be excluded from these actions, likewise Akasa. During the Tattwas Prithivi and Apas only, are these actions to be done. In a fever, the Yogi keeps his Chandra Swara going, and brings the Apas or Water Tattwa in course, so the fever is all over in a very short time. How mas- tery is gained over the Tattwas will come further on. The Pingala. In the Surya Swara only, are the following actions to be done: Reading and teaching hard and difficult subjects of knowledge, sexual intercourse, shipping, hunting, mounting a hill or fort, riding a donkey, camel or horse, swimming over a powerful stream or river, writing, painting, buying and selling, fighting with swords or hands, seeing a king, bathing, eat- ing, shaving, bleeding, sleeping - and such like. All these secure success and health, as the case may be, if done in the Surya Swara. The Sushumna. When the Breath comes out of both nostrils at the same time, it is flowing in the Sushamna. Nothing ought to be done under these conditions, for everything turns out badly. The same is the case when the Breath is now in one and now in the other nostril. When this is the case, sit down and meditate upon or over the Sacred Hansa. This joining of the Breath is the only time for Sandha, meditation. NOTE. Zanoni secured success in gaming for Cetosa and overcame the effects of the poisoned wine of the Prince di D as follows. In the first place, he changed his breath to the right nostril, and threw an <101> envelope of the Akasa Tattwa over his antagonist, who consequent- ly became all empty, the money in gaming flowing towards the Surya Swara. In the latter case he brought the Water, Apas, Tattwa into course, directed it with the full force of his trained will towards the poisoned wine, and consequently the burning heat of the poison was counteracted for a very long time, and before it could recover strength enough to act on the system, it was there no longer. S. R. M. D. THE TATTWAS To each of the five Tattwas a special colour has been assigned. Akasa- Black; dark; or no colour really. Vayu-Green (blue by some). Tejas-Red. Apas, White or really all colours. Prithivi-Yellow. It is by these colours that a practical man finds on the spur of the moment which Tathva is at the time in course. Besides, these Tattwas have different shapes and tastes. These figures are seen by taking a bright mirror and letting the breath fall upon it, as it comes out of the Nose. The divided part takes one of the following forms according to the Tattwa then in course. Prithivi-a figure having four Angles. Apas, a half moon, or crescent. Tejas, triangular. Vayu, spherical. Akasa, oval like a human ear. To sum up their qualities:"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"518 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Smen Prithivi-moves always in the middle of the -Paths of Air and Water.

For practice, let a man take five little bullets or counters coloured: red, yellow, green or blue, white or silver, and black. And place or carry them in his pocket. Now let him close his eyes and take one of them out of his pocket. The colour of the bullet will be that of the Tattwa then in course. Whilst still keeping the eyes closed, let him see if the colour of the bullet floats before them. He must not suppose he will be correct all at once. By and by the confu- sion will disappear, and colours well-defined, staying for the proper length of time, will begin to come before him, and the colour of the bullet will be the same as that seen before his eyes. And then he will have gained the power of knowing which of the Tattwas is in course, and can at pleasure find them. There is a particular method of concentrating the mind and practising with the eyes for this purpose, which will come with practise. Let him ask any of his friends to imagine one of the five colours, say a flower. He will only have to shut his eyes to find the Tattwa then in course, and he can astonish his friends by naming the colour. Again, if a man sitting amongst his friends finds the Vayu Tattwa set in, let him be sure that those of his friends who are in perfect health and in a normal state both of body and mind, wish to go away. Let him ask them to say frankly, and they will answer \"yes.\" In what way other Tattwas affect both the body and mind of man will be stated in another place. Some higher secrets are purposely reserved for those who safely and honestly pass the elementary stage. When the man has reached the stage of finding at will any of the Tattwas, let him not imagine he has become perfect. If he goes on practising, his inward sight becomes keener, and he will recognise the five subdivisions of the Tattwas. On and on let him go with his meditation, and innumerable shades of color will be recognised according to the different proportions of the Tattwas.

To avoid the tediousness, let him meditate upon his breath, as is laid down in the chapter of meditation of the Tattwas. Action to be done during the different Tattwas. Actions of a sedate and stable nature are those of the sort enumerated under the Chandra Swara, to be done when Prithivi the Earthy Principle is in course. Those of a fleeting nature, which are to be done and gone through very soon are to be done dur- ing Apas. Actions of a hard nature, those in which a man has to make violent struggle to hold his own, are to be done during Tejas. If a Yogi wishes to kill a man he must try to do so with the Vayu Tattwa. In the Akasa, nothing should be done but meditation, as works begun during this always end badly. Works of the above nature only prosper in the Tattwas specified; and those whose actions prosper may see this by experiment. MEDITATION AND MASTERY OVER THE TATTWAS We have previously given summary rules for distinguishing the various colours of the different Tattwas which are of great use to the beginner. But now we are going to explain the final method of mastering the Tattwas, and of practising. This is a secret which was only imparted to the most promising Adepts of Yoga. But a short practise will fully show the important results to be gained by this practice. The student will by degrees become able to look into futurity at will, and have all the visible world before his eyes, and he will be able to com- mand Nature. During the day, when the sky is clear, let him once or twice for <104> about an hour or two withdraw his mind from all external things; and sitting on an easy chair, let him fix his eyes on any particular part of the blue sky, and go on looking at it without allowing them to twinkle. At first he will see the waves of the water, this is the watery vapour in the atmosphere which surrounds the whole world. Some days later, as the eyes become prac- tised, he will see different sorts of buildings and so on in the air, and many other wonderful things as well. When the Neophyte reaches this stage of practise, he is sure of gaining success. After this he will see different sorts of mixed colours of Tattwas in the sky, which will after a constant and resolute practice show themselves in their proper and respective colours. To test the truth of this, the neophyte during the practice should occa- sionally close his eyes and compare the colour floating in the sky with that which he sees inwardly. When both are the same the operation is right. Other tests we have given before, and other wonders resulting from this will of themselves present themselves to the Yogi. This practice is to be done in the daytime."},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"52 0 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Seven For the night, let the student rise about two o'clock in the morning, when everything is calm, when there is no noise, and when the cold light of the stars breathe holiness, and a calm rapture enters into the soul of man. Let him wash his hands, feet, the crown of his head, and the nape of his neck with cold water. Let him put his shin bones on the ground, and let the back of his thighs touch his calves, and let him put his hands upon his knees, the fingers point- ing towards the body. Let him now fix his eyes on the tip of his nose. To avoid this tediousness, he must always, especially during the meditation, meditate upon his breath, coming in and going out. Besides the above, this has many other advantages given elsewhere. It may here be said that by constant practice of this meditation over his breath, the man is to develop two distinct syllables in his thought. It is evi- <105> dent that when a man draws his breath in, a sound is produced which is imitated in Han. When out, the sound Sa. By constant prac- tice, the going in and coming out of the breath is so much connected with these sounds that without any effort the mind understands Han-sa with the production of these sounds. Thus we see that one full breath makes Han-Sa, this is the Name of the Ruler of the Universe, together with his powers. They are exerted in the working out of natural phenomena. At this stage of perfec- tion, the Yogi should commence as follows: Getting up at two or three in the morning, and washing himself in the aforementioned manner, let him know and fix his mind upon the Tattwa then in course. If the Tattwa in course be then Prithivi, let him think of it as some- thing having 4 angles, a good yellow colour, sweet smelling, small in body, and taking away all diseases. Let him at the same time repeat the word LAM. It is very easy to imagine such a thing. If it be the Apas Tattwa, let him imagine something of the shape and brightness of the half moon, putting down heat and thirst, and that he is immersed in the ocean of Water. Let him at that time repeat the word VAM. If the Tattwa be Tejas, let him imagine it as something triangular in shape, shedding a red glare, consuming food and drink, burning away everythmg, and thus making itself unbearable. At the same time let him repeat RAM. If the Tattwa be Vayu, let him imagine it as something of a spherical shape, of a colour Green, or Blue, like the green leaves of a tree after rain, and carrying him with a mighty power away from the ground and flying in space like the birds. And let him repeat the syllable PAM. If the Tattwa be Akasa, let him imagine it as having no shape but giving forth a brilliant light, and let him repeat the syllable HAM. <106> By diligent practice, these syllables uttered by the tongue of a Yogi become inseparable from the Tattwas. When he repeats any of these, the special Tattwa appears with as much force as he may will, and thus it is that a Yogi can cause whatever he likes, lightning, rain, wind, and so forth. CURE OF DISEASES Every disease causes the breath to flow out of the wrong nostril, and the"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"Tattwas 521 wrong Tattwa to come into course. When the breath therefore is restored to the proper nostril, and the proper Tattwa has been brought into course, let not anyone expect that all that is necessary has been done. If the disease be obstinate and the attack a very violent one, the man will have to persevere in battle a very long time before he conquers. If a beginner cannot succeed very soon, let him aid the power of his breath by a suitable medicine, and Swara will be restored very soon. It may be noticed that the Chandra Swara is generally the best for all dis- eases. Its flow is an indication of the soundness of Health. In cold, cough, and other diseases, this breath ought to flow. Of the Tattwas as well as of the Swaras, no one causes pain if it goes on properly. In this state it ought not generally to be meddled with. But when anyone gains an undue predominance and causes diseases, it ought to be at once changed. Experience shows that the Apas and the Prithivi Tattwas are the only ones generally good for health, and indeed, the fact that during the course of the Apas Tattwa the breath is felt 16 fingers breadth below the nose, and during the Prithivi 12 fingers, argues at those times a more sound and powerful working of the functions of the body, than when it is felt only 8, or 4, or no finger-breadth below the nose. Akasa therefore is the worst for health, and in a state of ill-health, a man will generally find in course, either Akasa, Vayu, or Tejas. <107> Let him therefore, when need be, proceed in the following manner. After having changed his Breath, from the wrong nostril to the proper one, generally the Left, and pressing the opposite side by a cushion so that it may not change again, let the man sit on an easy chair and bind his left thigh a little above the knee joint with his handkerchief. In a short time, whose length, varies inversely as the deficiency of practice, and directly as the violence of the disease, he will perceive that the Tattwa changes to the one immediately below it and so on; and then the next, and so forth. If he be an acute observer of the conditions of his body, he will perceive that slowly his mind is becoming more and more easy. Let him tighten his bandage still more if need be. When at last he reaches the Prithivi Tattwa, he will find in the state of his health a great change for the better. Let him preserve in this state, or, still better, the Apas Tattwa for some time, and return to it occasionally for some days, even after the attacks of the disease have ceased. He will no doubt be cured. FORECAST OF FUTURITY Although a Yogi obtains the power of knowing everything that is, has been, or is to be, beyond the reach of the senses, yet generally he becomes indifferent to such knowledge, forgetting himself, as he does, in his eternal presence before the Light which breathes beauty into all we see in the world. We shall therefore represent him here revealing if not all his knowledge of Futurity, only on questions being put to him by others. But our Neophytes may as well put the questions themselves, and then answer them according to the laws here laid down. When a man comes and says to the Yogi that he has a question to ask, let him:"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"522 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Smen (a) see which of the Tattwas is in course. If the Tattwa be Prithivi, the question is about some root, something belonging to the vegetable <108> kingdom, or something in which the Earthy nature is pre- dominant. (b) If it be Apas, it is about some Life, birth, death, etc. (c) If Tejas, the question is of metals, gain or loss, etc. (d) If Akasa, he means to ask nothing. (e) If Vayu, about some journey. These are but elementary things. The practical Yogi who can distinguish between the mixture of the Tattwas can name the particular things. Now let him see through which of his nostrils the Breath is flowing, which is the fortnight then in course of passing, which the days, and what direction of himself, the enquirer. If the breath comes through the Left nostril, to, secure complete success in the work which makes the subject of the question, and which will be of the sort specified under Ida, he must have the following coincidences: The fortnight must be bright, that is of the Waxing Moon; the day must be even, 2, 4,6, and so on; the direction must be East or North. If these things coincide the man will get what he wants. Again, if the Surya and Swara coincide with the dark fortnight, the day odd, the direction South and West, the same result may be predicted but not so thoroughly. The action will be.of the sort prescribed under Pigala. According as any of these do not coincide, will the success be more or less imperfect. It must be remembered that the breath at the time must not be flowing through the wrong nostril. This has many bad consequences; we only just touch the subject. Of the Wrong Swara. If at the commencement of the day the wrong Swara arises, the Lunar for the Solar, and vice versa, a man may expect some- thing wrong. If it happens the first day, there is sure to be some sort <109> of mental uneasiness. If the second, some loss of wealth. If the third, a journey will come. If the fourth, some dear object will be de- stroyed. If the fifth, loss of kingdom. If the sixth, loss of everything. If the seventh, illness and pain sure to come. If the eighth, death. If the Sun breath flows in the morning and at noon and the Moon in the evening, a sad discomfiture will be the result, the reverse being a sign of Victory. If a man, going to travel, raises his foot which coincides in direction with the empty nostril at the time being, he will not get what he desires from his travels."},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"BOOK EIGHT DIVINATION"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"GEOMANCY CHAPTER ONE The figures of Geomancy consist of various groupings of odd and even points in 4 lines. Of these the greatest possible number of combinations is 16. Therefore these sixteen combinations of odd and even points arranged on four lines are the sixteen figures of Geomancy. These are again classed under the heads of the Elements, the Signs of the Zodiac, and the Planets ruling these. Two figures are attributed to each of the Seven Planets, while the remainder are attributed to Caput and Cauda Draconis-the Head and Tail of the Dragon, or the North and South Nodes of the Moon. Furthermore, to each Planet and Sign certain ruling Genii are attributed, as shown on pages 114 and 115. CHAPTER TWO Roughly speaking, the mode of obtaining the first four Geomantic figures, from which the remainder of the Divination is calculated, is by mark- ing down at random on paper with a pencil held by a loosely tensed hand 16 lines of points or dashes, without counting the number placed in each line during the operation. And all the time thinking fixedly of the subject of the demand. When the 16 lines are completed, the number of points in each line should be added up, and if the result be odd a single point or cross should be made in the first of the three compartments to the right of the paper. <113> If even, two points or crosses. These 16 lines will then yield four Geomantic figures. The results, odd and/or even, of lines 1 to 4 inclusive comprise the first figure. Of lines 5 to 8 the second figure; of lines 9 to 12 the third; of lines 13 to 16, the 4th figure, as shown in the diagram on page 114. The symbol of a Pentagram either within or without a circumscribed cir- cle should be made at the top of the paper on which the dashes are made. The paper itself should be perfectly clean and should have never been previously used for any other purpose. If a circle be used with the Pentagram, it should be drawn before the latter is described. The Pentagram should always be of the \"invoking\" type, as described in the Pentagram Ritual. Since the Pentagram concerns the element of Earth, it should therefore be drawn beginning at the top descending to the lower left hand point, carefully closing the angle at the finish. Within the centre of the Pentagram, the Sigil of the \"Ruler\" to which the matter of the question specially refers, should be placed. If the question be of the Nature of Saturn, such as agriculture, sorrow, death, etc., the Sigil of Zazel should be placed in the Pentagram. If of Jupiter, concerning good fortune, feasting, church preferment, etc., the Sigil of His- mael. If of Mars, war, fighting, victory, etc., the Sigil of Bartzabel. If of the Sun, power, magistracy, success, etc., the Sigil of Sorath. If of Venus, love, music, pleasure, etc., the Sigil of Kedemel. If of Mercury, such as science, learning, knavery, etc., the Sigil of Taphthartharath, etc. If of travelling, fishing, etc., under Luna, then the Sigil of Chasmodai. In the diagram appended the Sigil of Hismael is employed. During the marking down of the points, the attention should be fixed 524"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"Geomancy 525 upon the Sigil within the Pentagram, and the mind should carefully consider the question proposed. (Note: A common practice is to repeat audibly the name of the Ruler as though to invoke him, followed by a short sentence concerning the matter of divination.-I. R.) The hand should not be moved from the paper until the 16 lines of points are complete. A pencil is therefore preferable to a pen for this purpose-unless, of course, a very reliable fountain pen is employed. It is practically more convenient to draw or rule four lines aaoss the paper beforehand to mark off the space for such four lines composing a Geomantic Figure as shown on the previous page. The first four Geomantic figures formed directly from the 16 lines of points are called The Four Mothers. It is from them that the remaining figures necessary to complete the Geomantic scheme of direction are derived. These should now be placed in a row from right to left, for the greater convenience of the necessary calculations - though much practice may render this unnecessary. The first figure will be attributed to the South, the Second to the East, the Third to the North, and the Fourth to the West. <116> EXAMPLE PLAN OF GEOMANTIC DIVINATION 15 points odd * 15 points odd 16 points even Fortuna Minor 14 boints even * * 15 points odd * 16 points even 15 voints odd Amissio 14 boints even It * 12 voints even * * 6 boints even 9 ~oints odd 7 boints odd * Fortuna Major 10 voints even * * 11 boints odd 10 points even Rubeus 10 points even * I+"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"526 The Golden Dawn: Volume IV Book Eight <114> GEOMANTIC Sigil of Name of Ruler Planet which Sign of Ruler rules Answer Zodiac Bartzabel 9 Kedemel 3 Taphthartharath 3 Chasmodai 3 Sorath 7 Taphthartharath Kedemel Bartzabel Cs Hismael b Zazel a Zazel * Hismael Zazel and 83 Bamabel Hismael and % Kedemcl Sorath Mars d cy Aries Venus 9 Tautus Mercury g Luna I) Sol 0 Mercury g Venus 9 Mars 6 Jupiter Saturn r) Saturn r) Jupiter Saturn fi and Mars 8 Venus and 9 Jupiter Sol 0 Gemini Cancer SLk Virgo fi Libra q Scorpio 9 Sagittarius llg Capricorn = Aquariw Pisces Cauda Draconis Q Caput Draconis 3 Chasmodai Luna Cancer (Note: When attributing the above Geomantic figures to the Tree of Life, the two Saturnian figures represent the Three Supernals.

The Tenth from the 3rd and 4th figures; the 1 lth from the 5th and 6th figures, the 12th from the 7th and 8th figures. The rule is to compare or add together the points of the corresponding lines. If, for instance, the first line of the First Mother consists of one point, and the first line of the Second Mother also consists of one point, these two are added together, and since they are an even number two points are marked down for the first line of the Resultant.

CHAPTERTHREE For the greater assistance of the Diviner in forming a judgment upon the general condition of the scheme of 12 figures thus far obtained, it is usual to deduce from them three other subsidiary figures. These three are of less importance than the twelve previous figures, and are not to be considered at all in the light of component figures of the scheme, but only as aids to the general judgment. These other figures are known as the Right Witness, Left"},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"53 0 The Golden Dawn: Volume IV Book Eight Witness, and the Judge. The two witnesses are without significance in the divination, except as they are the roots from which the figure known as the Judge is derived. The Right Witness is formed from the 9th and 10th figures by comparing the points in the manner before shown in the formation of the Resultants. That is the corresponding lines of points in the two figures are compared together, and the addition, whether odd or even, comprises the points of the Witness. The Left Witness represents the combination in a similar manner of the 11th and 12th figures. The Judge again is formed in precisely the same way from the Two Witnesses, and is therefore a synthesis of the whole figure. If he be good, the figure is good and the judgment will be favourable; and vice versa. From the nature of the formation of the 15th figure, the Judge, it should always consist of an even number of points, and never of odd. That is, in add- ing together the four lines of points comprising the Judge, the result should be an even number. For if the Judge were a figure of odd points it would show that a mistake had been made somewhere in the calculations. The Reconciler isa 16th figure sometimes used for adding the Judgment by combining the Judge with the Figure in the Particular House sigmfymg the thing demanded. Thus, in the preceding scheme, the Judge <121> formed is Populus, and the Second Figure, being Amissio, their combination also yields Amissio. In order to discover where $ The Part of Fortune will fall, add together all the points of the first twelve figures. Divide that number by twelve, and place the Part of Fortune with the figure answering to the remainder. If there is no remainder it will fall on the 12th figure. The Part of Fortune is a symbol of ready money, money in cash belonging to the Querent, and is of the greatest importance in all questions of money. CHAPTER FOUR The following is the signification of the 12 Houses of Heaven, in brief: First House (Ascendant) Life, health, querent, etc. Second House Money, property, personal worth. Third House Brothers, sisters, news, short journeys, etc. Fourth House Father, landed property, inheritance. The grave, the end of the matter. Fifth House Children, pleasure, feasts, speculation. Sixth House Servants, sickness, uncles and aunts, small animals. Seventh House Love, marriage, husband or wife. Partnerships and associa- tions, public enemies, law suits.

A figure is, therefore, strongest when in what is called its house, very strong when in its exaltation, strong in its Triplicity, ve y weak in its Fall; weakest of all in its detriment. A figure is in its fall when in a House opposite to that of its exaltation, and in its detriment when opposite to its own house. The Geomantic figures, being attributed to the Planets and Signs, are dignified according to the rules which obtain in Astrology? That is to say they follow the dignities of their Ruling Planets, considering the Twelve Houses of the scheme as answering to the Twelve Signs. Thus, the Ascendant or First House answers to Aries, the Second House to Taurus, the Third House to Gemini, and so on to the Twelfth answering to Pisces. Therefore the figures of Mars will be strong in the First House, but weak in the Seventh House, and so forth.

Cauda Draconis is strong in the dignities of Saturn and Mars. <133> CHAPTER SEVEN Remember always that if the figures Rubeus or Cauda Draconis fall in the Ascendant, or first house, the figure is not fit for Judgment and should be destroyed without consideration. Another figure for the question should not be erected before at least two hours have elapsed. 'Note: These geomantic rules are those of classical astrology. Thus, the recently discovered planets Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, Chiron, etc. should not be substituted for the classical ruler- ships. C.L.W."},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"538 The Golden Dawn: Volume lV Book Eight Your figure being thoroughly arranged as on a Map of the heavens, as previously shown, note first to what House the demand belongs. Then look for the Witnesses and the Judge, as to whether the latter is favourable or otherwise, and in what particular way. Put this down. Note next what Figure falls in the House required. Also whether it passes or springs - that is whether it is also present in any other House or Houses. These should also be considered - as for example in a question of money stolen, if the figure in the second House be also found in the sixth House, it might also show that the thief was a servant in the house. Then look in the Table of Figures in the Houses and see what the Figure signifies in the special House under consideration. Put this down also. Then look in the Table for the strength of the figures in that House. Followix~g this, apply the astrological rule of aspects between houses, noting what houses are Sextile, Quintile, Square, Trine, etc. Write the \"Good\" one side and the \"Evil\" on the other, noting also whether these figures also are \"strong\" or \"weak,\" \"friendly\" or \"unfriendly\" in nature to the figure in the House required. Note that in looking up the aspects between houses, there are two diretions, Dexter and Sinister. The Dexter aspect is that which is contrary to the natural succession of the houses; the Sinister is the reverse. The Dexter aspect is more powerful than the Sinister. Then add the meaning of the figure in the Fourth House, which will sigrufy the end of the matter. It may also assist you to form a Recon- <134> ciler Figure from the Figure in the house required and the Judge, noting what figure results and whether it harmonises with either or both by nature. Now consider all you have written down, and according to the balance of \"good\" and \"evil\" therein form your final judgment. Consider also in \"money\" matters where the Part of Fortune falls. For example, let us consider the figure previously set up and form a judgment for Zoss of money in business\" therefrom. Populus is the Judge, and we find that in questions of money, which con- cern the Second House, it signifies \"medium good.\" The question as a whole is of the nature of the Second House, where we find Carcer. We then discover that Carcer here is \"evil,\" as showing obstacles and delays. The Part of For- tune is in the Ascendant with Amissio, sigrufylng loss through Querent's own mistake, and loss through Querent's self. The figure of Amissio springs into no other house, therefore this does not affect the question. \"Carcer\" in the Second House is neither \"strong\" nor \"wea!!; its strength for evil is medium. The figures Sextile and Trine of the Second are Conjuntio, Fortuna Major, Fortuna Minor, and Acquisitio, all \"good\" figures, helping the matter and \"friendly\" in nature. This signifies well intentioned help of friends. The figures square and opposition of the Second are Fortuna Minor, Conjunctio, Albus which are not hostile to Car- cer, therefore showing \"opposition not great.\" The figure in the Fourth House is Fortuna Major which shows a good end but with anxiety. Let us now form a Reconciler between the figure of the Second House which is Carcer and the Judge, Populus, which produces Car- cer again, a sympathetic figure, but denoting delay - delay, but helping the Querent's wishes. Now let us add all these together:"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"Geomancy 1. Medium 2. Evil and Obstacles, delay. <135> 3. Loss through querent's self. 4. Strength for evil, medium only. 5. Well-intentioned aid of friends. 6. Not much opposition from enemies. 7. Ending-good; but with anxiety. 8. Delay, but helping Querent's wishes. And we can formulate the final judgment: That the Querent's loss in business has been principally owing to his own mismanagement. That he will have a long and hard struggle, but will meet with help from friends. That his obstacles will grad- ually give way, and that after much anxiety he will eventually recoup himself for his former losses. SUMMARY OF STAGES IN GEOMANTIC DMNATION: 1. If Rubeus or Cauda Draconis in Ascendant destroy the figure. 2. Note the House to which the question belongs. See if the figure there springs into another house. 3. Form the Judge from the two witnesses. 4. Part of Fortune-that is, if money question. 5. See if Figure in House concerned is \"strong\" or \"weak.\" If it pass or spring into any other house. 6. See figures Sextile and Trine, Square and Opposition. 7. Friendly or unfriendly. 8. Note the figure in Fourth House, sigxufying the end or outcome. 9. Form a Reconciler from Judge and the figure in House to which the demand appertains. (Note: Although this whole instruction of Geomancy describes the process as being performed throughout on paper with a pencil, yet it should be remembered that this description is but a makeshift for the convenience of the unenterprising student. By defini- tion, Geomancy is a scheme of divination by and through the Element of Earth. Therefore the student with initiative, to whom this method appeals, should act accordingly. <136> Let him therefore prepare a quantity of clean and dry black earth - or desert sand, if possible, but not that taken from the sea-shore - and also a tray or wooden box which is to be resewed solely for the purpose of housing this consecrated earth. The outside of the box might be decorated with sigils or symbolic paintings in har- mony with the general idea, and painted in the four Malkuth colours. A small slender wand, pointed to make clean sharp holes or markings, should be prepared since it will be with this instrument that the sixteen lines of dots or holes in the earth will be made. When all has been duly prepared, the box of Earth should be given a ceremonial consecration; the , student who has studied the general formulae of consecration will know exactly what should be done. In actual divinatory practice, the invoking Earth Pentagram endosing the Sigil, and the sixteen rows of dots from which the Four Mothers will be formed, can be quickly marked on the Earth with this special wand or pointer. Then, for convenience' sake, the student can transfer these four primary figures to paper, calculate the remaining eight figures to be placed on the Map and proceed to judgment exactly as this instruction lays down. Experience shows that the actual use of Earth as a means of forming the fundamen- tal magi&] link between the initiated diviner and the Geomantic divinatory Genii is psy- chologically more valid and effectual than with paper and pencil, besides yielding far more satisfactory results.-I.

THE FOUR KINGS The Four Kings or Figures mounted on Steeds represent the Yod forces of the Name in each suit, the Radix, Father, and commencement of Material Forces. A Force in which all the others are implied and of which they form the development and completion. A force swift and violent in action, but whose effed soon passes away, and therefore symbolised by a figure on a steed rid- ing swiftly, and clothed in complete amour. Therefore is the knowledge of the scale of the King so necessary for the commencement of all magical working. THE FOUR QUEENS Are seatedupon Thrones, representing the Forces of Heh of the Name in each suit, the Mother, and bringer forth of material Force, a Force which develops, and realises the Force of the King. A force steady and unshaken, but not rapid though enduring. It is therefore symbolised by a figure seated upon a Throne but also clothed in armour. THE FOUR PRINCES These Princes are figures seated in Chariots, and thus borne forward. They represent the Vau Forces of the Name in each suit; the Mighty son of the King, and the Queen, who realises the Influence of both scales of Force. A prince, the son of a King and Queen, yet a Prince of Princes, and a <145> King of Kings. An Emperor, whose effed is at once rapid (though not so swift as that of a king) and enduring (though not as steadfast as that of a Queen). It is therefore symbolised by a figure borne in a chariot, and clothed with amour. Yet is his power illusionary, unless set in motion by his Father and Mother. THE FOUR PRINCESSES Are the Knaves of the Tarot Pack. The Four Princesses or Figures of Amazons standing firmly by themselves, neither riding upon Horses, nor seated upon Thrones, nor borne on Chariots. They represent the forces of Heh final of the Name in each suit, completing the influences of the other scales. The mighty and potent daughter of a King and Queen: a Princess powerful and terrible. A Queen of Queens, an Empress, whose effect com- bines those of the King, Queen and Prince. At once violent and permanent, she is therefore symbolised by a figure standing firmly by itself, only partially draped and having but little armour. Yet her power existeth not save by reason of the others, and then indeed it is mighty and terrible materially, and is the Throne of the Forces of the Spirit. Woe unto whomsoever shall make war upon her when thus established! The Sphere of Influence of the Court Cards of the Tarot Pack.

Above his Helmet, upon his cuirass, and on his shoulder pieces and buskins he bears, as a crest, a winged black Horse's head. He grasps a Club with flaming ends, somewhat similar to that in the symbol of the Ace of Wands, but not so heavy, and also the Sigil of his scale is shewn. Beneath the rushing feet of his steed are waving flames of Fire. He is active, generous, fierce, sudden and impetuous. If ill-digrufied he is evil- minded, cruel, bigoted, brutal.

At her side is a couchant leopard on which her hands rest. She bears a long Wand with a very heavy conical head. The face is beautiful and reso- lute. Adaptability, steady force applied to an object. Steady rule; <147> great attractive power, power of command, yet liked notwithstand- ing. Kind and generous when not opposed.

She wears a Corinthian shaped Helmet, and crown, with a long plume. It also is surmounted by a tiger's head, and the same symbol forms the buckle of her scale-mail buskins. <148> A mantle lined with Tiger's skin falls back from her shoulders. Her right hand rests on a small golden or brazen Altar, ornamented with Ram's heads, and with Flames of Fire leaping from it. Her left hand leans on a long and heavy club, swelling at the lower end, where the sigil is placed. It has flames of fire leaping from it the whole way down, but the flames are ascending. This Club or torch is much longer than that carried by the King or Queen. Beneath her firmly placed feet are leaping Flames of Fire.

There being 36 Decanates and only seven Planets, it follows that one of the latter must rule over one more decanate than the others. This is the Planet Mars which is allotted the last decan of Pisces and first of Aries, because the long cold of the winter requires a great energy to overcome it and initiate spring. The beginning of the decanates is from the Royal King Star of the Heart of the Lion, the great star Cor Leonis, and therefore is the first decanate that of Saturn in Leo. Here follow the general meanings of the small cards of the Suits, as classified under the Nine Sephiroth below Kether.

RIOGHAIL MA DHREAM."},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"TAROT DIVINATION This form is especially applicable to Divination concerning the ordinary material events of daily life. It is a mode of placing the cards based upon the scheme of the dominion of the Tarot Symbols. The more rigidly correct and in harmony with the scheme of the Universe is any form of Divination, so much the more is it likely to yield a correct and reliable answer to the enquirer. For thenand then only is there a firm link, and bond of union, established between it and the Occult forces of Nature. The moment the correct correspondence .of the Symbols employed ceases to be observed, the link between them and the inner Occult forces is strained, and in some cases broken. For this cause, therefore, is it that the same mode of Divination will sometimes yield a true and sometimes false answer, and at other times a partly true and partly false; because the correspondences are either not rigidly observed or else made use of by an ignorant and uninitiated person. Therefore the Diviner should enter upon the Divination with a mind clear and unprejudiced, neither disturbed by anger, fear, nor love, and with a sound knowledge of the correspondences of the symbols which he employs. Also he should be able to employ his clairvoyant and intuitive faculties therein when necessary and should avoid as much as possible a warped or strained decision. Also it is not well to divine repeatedly concerning the same matter; and the Diviner should also recognise that even the material occult forces do not act as the instruments of a blind fatality, but rather in accord- ance with the will of the more spiritual powers which are behind them. Also it may be well for the Diviner to put on his insignia, and make over the pack any invoking hexagram or Pentagram, either with the hand <178> alone, or with convenient magical instruments. And it may also be advisable in some instances to invoke an elemental force consonant with the matter, to aid in the divination. And let it not be forgotten that in working with the lesser magical implements all the four should be at hand, even though only one be actually employed. For if this be not done, it will give undue force to the suit corre- sponding to the Element invoked, and instead of being an aid in the matter, it will be a hindrance to correct reading. (A formula which may be found useful to assist concentration, and to formulate a link between the Diviner and the intelligences referred to the Tarot, is to take the pack in the left hand, and with the right hand hold the Wand or any lesser instrument.

Lay thine hand invisibly on these consecrated cards of art, that thereby I may obtain true knowledge of hidden things, to the glory of the ineffable Name. Amen.\"-I.R.) THE OPENING OF THE KEY The mode of performing the Divination called \"The Opening of the Key\" is by five consecutive operations of laying out the cards, they having been previously well shuffled, and, in addition in the first and fourth cases, having been cut as well, and in a certain manner. These five operations answer respectively, the first to the Dominion of the Four Princesses under the presidency of the Four Aces; the Second to that of the Kings, Queens and Princes, referred to the Twelve Houses; the Third to that of the Twelve Keys attributed to the Signs; the Fourth to that of the smaller cards answering to the 36 Decanates; and the Fifth and last to the rule of the Sephiroth in the Celestial Heavens. <179> These are five distinct operations, consecutively executed from the mode of Operation called the \"Opening of the Key,\" which, as has been before said, is especially applicable to the daily events of life. The first of these methods shows the opening of the matter as it then stands. The 2nd) 3rd, 4th, its consecutive development, and the 5th its termination. Before commencing the Divination, one of the sixteen court cards should be selected to represent the significator of the enquirer, and should answer as nearly to his description. WANDS generally-very fair-haired and red-haired persons with fair complexion. CUPS generally-moderately fair persons. SWORDS-generally-dark persons. PENTACLES generally-very dark persons. KINGS-Generally men. QUEENS-Generally women. PRINCES (KNIGHTS) -Generally young men. PRINCESSES (KNAVES) -Generally young women. Of these the Queens and Princes in reading the cards during the pro- cesses almost always represent persons connected with a matter under con- sideration. The Kings, if looking against the diretion of the reading, or if meeting it, represent the coming of a person or event, or phase of an event, but if looking with the diretion of the reading represent the departure of a person or the going off or wane of some event. The Princesses (Knaves) if looking with the diretion of the reading, represent general opinion in harmony with, and approving the matter; but if looking against the diretion of the reading the reverse. If the Diviner be performing the Divination for a person at a distance and of whose general description he is ignorant, he can select the significator by cutting the pack, and taking one of the court cards of that suit, cut to <180> represent him of course earnestly thinking of the person at the time. It is usually much better for the Enquirer to shuffle or cut the cards him-"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"568 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Eight self; but if the Diviner should have to do this himself, he must, while doing so, earnestly think of the person enquiring, or concerning whom the Divination is performed. In all cases of shuffling and cutting the person doing so should think earnestly of the matter in hand. In cutting, ifa false cut be made, that is to say if one or more cards should drop in the process, the cards should be at once reshuffled, and again cut clearly, otherwise it is probable that the answer will be unreliable. (Note: If the matter be important, he should wait twelve hours be- fore reshuffling.) In the laying out of the Cards, if any are inverted, they must remain so and must not be turned round, as that would alter the direction in which they would be looking. A card has the same meaning and forces, whether right or inverted, so that no particular attention need be paid to the circum- stances. The order of the cards as laid down must also not be interfered with. In the reading of the cards when laid out, the Significator of the Enquirer is the start- ing point, and reading proceeds by counting over certain cards in the direction in which the face of the Court card chosen as Significator of the Enquirer is turned. The mode of counting is as follows, recognising the card from which one starts as the No. 1. From every Ace-Five cards (spirit and four elements). Princess (Knave) -Seven cards (seven palaces of Malkuth) . King, Queen, Prince-Four cards, (letters of Tetragrammaton). Smaller cards-Its own number (a Sephirah). Key of Aleph Mem Shin-Three cards (number of the Mother let- ters). <181> Key of duplicated letters-Nine cards (number of planets and Caput and Cauda Draconis) . Key of single letters Twelve (number of signs). The counting is continued till one alights on a card which has already been read. Thus, in the following example, we will suppose that the significator is the Queen of Cups, and that she is looking to the left. We should read as follows: Queen of Cups-a fair woman; counting four, we come to Five of Pentacles, i.e. \"Loss of money\" and as it has on one side the Moon and on the other a card of Pentacles, it shows that it is through deception in business matters,) we then count 5, the number of the card, from the 5 of Pentacles, which falls on the 6 of Cups \"Success.\" But as this has on one side the Foolish Man, and on the other the Ace of Wands, this will not be great owing to unwise conduct. Then we count six from the 6 of Cups, still going in the same dire&& which brings us to the Queen of Cups, a card we have already read, - so we finish there. Significator looking to left"},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"Tarot Divination 569 SIGNIFICATOR-QUEEN OF CUPS Thus the reading will be \"A rather fair woman has lost money through some cheating in business, and though she is again beginning to succeed, this success is liable to be damaged by unwise conduct on her part for which she will have herself to thank. If the significator were the Knave of Wands, and (looking towards the right) we should count seven to the 2 of Pentacles, then two from that to the 5 of Pentacles; then five from that to the Hierophant, twelve from that to the Queen of Cups, four from that to the King of Pentacles; then four to <182> the Foolish Man, and thence three to the 2 of Pentacles, where we stop, having read that card already. \"A young woman is just making a change in her business, which brings her loss of money through some deceit on the part of a fair woman, and a dark man whose foolish advice has led to the change.\" The cards would then be paired two by two, from opposite ends as hereafter shown: thus: Moon and Tower, \"The deceit is dis- covered.\" 5 of Pentacles and Queen of Cups, \"on the part of this person who has brought about her loss.\" 2 of Pentacles and Hierophant, \"by advising the change.\" Knight of Cups and Knave of Wands, \"for the young woman meets an older man,\" King of Pentacles and Fool \"who counteract the foolish advice of the dark man.\" Ace of Wands and 6 of Cups \"and she in consequence suc- ceeds better, but only by the dint of energy and hard work.\" The scheme of Divination called \"The Opening of the Key\" is worked out in the following manner. I adjoin an example carried carefully through the five stages for the instruction of the Z.A.M. The complete pack of 78 cards is employed. FIRST OPERATION Representing the Opening of the Question The sigmficator being chosen, the enquirer shuffles the cards, thinking earnestly of the matter under consideration. He then places the cards in a single packet on the table before him, face downwards. This represents the Name YHVH, which is now to be separated unto the component letters. He therefore is to cut the pack as nearly in the middle as his eye can direct, and to face the uppermost portion to the right of the lowermost; the former will rep- resent YH and the latter VH (final). He again is to cut the packet to the right hand into two parts, as nearly in the centre as he can, and place the upper- most part to the right again. This will represent Y and the lower part the remaining H. He is now to cut the packet to the left, its uppermost <183> part will represent V and its lower part H (final). So that he will now have four packets nearly equal in size, answering from right to left to the name YHVH-;I1;I3 under the presidency of the Four Princesses (knaves) and through them to the four radical forces (Aces). These four packets are then turned face upwards without altering their relative position, and the meaning of their four bottom cards thus shown may be read as an indication of the matter. Each packet is now examined to find in which the Significator of the Enquirer is, being careful not to alter the order of the Cards. The packet containing the Significator is retained for reading, and the others are put aside and not used in this particular reading (operation). Carefully note to"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"570 The Golden Dawn: Volume W Book Eight which of the Four letters the packet containing the sigruficator of the En- quirer corresponds. If to Y and Wands, energy and strife. If to H and Cups, pleasure. If to V and Swords, sickness and trouble. If to H final and Pentacles, business and money. The packet containing the significator is now spread out face upwards in the form of a horseshoe (count in the way the Sigruficator looks) and its meaning is read in the manner previously described. First by counting to certain cards until one is alighted upon which has been pre- viously read; and then by pairing them together in succession from opposite ends of the horseshoe. (You do not miss the significator.) Before commencing counting from the Sigruficator, the Diviner should first notice what suit predominates in the number of cards. In this a majority of Wands would signify energy, quarrelling, opposition. Of Cups, pleasure and merriment. Of Swords, trouble and sadness, sometimes sickness and death. Of Pentacles, business, money, possession, etc. Also if in the cards laid out there should be either three or four cards of a sort, such as 3 Aces, 4 Fives, etc., their meaning should be noted according to the table hereafter given. A majority of the Keys shows forces beyond one's control. <184> EXAMPLE Supposing that a young man asks the question \"Shall I succeed in my present affairs?\" His complexion is fair, and his hair light brown. The Diviner therefore takes the Prince of Cups for Sigruficator.* (Had he been an older man he would have selected the King of the same suit instead) and requests Enquirer to carefully shuffle the pack and place it face downwards on the table before him. He then instructs him to cut the pack as nearly in the centre as possible, and to place the uppermost half well to the right, and then to cut each of the packets as nearly in the centre as possible, putting each upper- most half to the right of and beside the lower half, thus yielding four packets of nearly equal dimensions. n Full Pack u '\\ These four packets are now turned face upwards and we find them thus placed as regards the four bottom cards. Whoever cuts, cuts to his own right 'I've left this as it was in the original to illustrate the process, but the reader will soon discover that the example, and the illustration, that follows does indeed use the King of Cups, and not the Prince, as the Significator. C.LW."},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"Tarot Divination 571 Here the 10 of Wands is strong, being in the place of Yod which governs Wands-Fire. The Six of Swords is moderately strong, being in the place of Heh which rules Cups-Water, which is not a hostile and contrary element to Air; the 4 of Pentacles is weak because it is in the place of Vau which rules the contrary element to Earth, viz. Air; and the Chariot-Cancer, a watery sign is fairly strong, being in the place of Heh final, which rules Earth, a friendly ele- ment to Water. The Diviner then reads these 4 Cards as a preliminary thus: \"The Enquirer works very hard and gains but little money, yet matters are <185> beginning to improve.\" Because the 10 of Wands shows cruelty, harshness, etc. 6 of Swords, labour and work. 4 of Pentacles, gain of money, and the Chariot, success. The Diviner then examines the Four Packets to find in which one the Sigruficator is. It proves to be in the one of which the 6 of Swords is the bot- tom card. This is in the place answering to the letter Heh, which represents pleasure and rules Cups. This is so far a good omen, as it shows society and merriment. This pack of cards is retained for reading, the others are put aside as not bearing on the question. Let us suppose that this packet consists of 20 cards, and that they are in the following order. The Diviner spreads them out in the form of a horseshoe: The suit of Cups is distinctly in the majority-pleasure, visiting friends, love-making, etc. There are 3 Knaves which indicates Society of the young. From which the Diviner reads that the Enquirer is fond of young people and of flirting, etc. There being no other set of 3 or 4 cards of a sort, the Diviner proceeds to read by counting from the Significator, whose face is turned towards the 9 of Wands. The counting therefore proceeds in the direction of the arrow, thus: 4 from the King of Cups, 10 of Pentacles. 10 from this, 8 of Cups. 8 from this, Wheel of Fortune. 9 from this, Knave of Wands, 7 from this, 10 of <186> Cups. 10 from this, 5 of Wands. 5 from this, Knight of Wands. 4 from this, Ace of Pentacles. 5 from this, 10 of Cups. And as this card has already been taken, this form of reading finishes here. In this reading as hereafter explained, each card is modified by the card"},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"5 72 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Eight in either side of it; if it be an end card, such as the 6 of Swords, in this case it is modified not only by the card next to it, Ace of Pentacles, but also by the card at the opposite end, Knave of Wands. If these cards are of a contrary element to the card itself, they very much weaken and neutralize its force, but if the contrary element is only in one card, and the other is of a connecting nature, it does not much matter. This is explained later among the tabluated rules. The King of Cups is between the 9 of Wands and the Wheel of Fortune, both of which cards are of a fiery nature, and therefore contrary to Cups which is Water, and therefore it shows that the Enquirer is rather lacking in perseverance and energy. 10 of Pentacles, \"His business will begin to prosper,\" 8 of Cups, 'but yet he will lose interest in it, owing to his love of pleasure and society\" (shown by 8 of Cups having the suit on each side of it). Wheel of Fortune, \"and through his fortune chang- ing for the better.\" Knave of Wands (Knight of Wands on one side and 6 of Swords on the other), \"He yet is anxious through falling in love with a grace- ful and sprightly girl with chestnut hair and fair complexion whom he has recently met\" (shown by Knight of Wands turned contrary to the course of the reading). 10 of Cups,\"His suit is at first favourably received,\"5 of Swords, \"but some slanderous reports and mischief making\" (not altogether without foundation) \"come to her knowledge.\" Ace of Pentacles, 'though his increas- ing prosperity in business,\" 10 of Cups, \"had lead her to regard him with favour.\" The Diviner now pairs the cards from opposite ends of the horse- shoe, thus: <187> Knave of Wands ,,She is anxious about this.II 6 of Swords Knight of Wands \"And he begins to neglect his business which yet is fairly good.

This concludes the reading in the First Operation, which may be thus resumed:"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"Tarot Divination 573 \"The enquirer is a fair young man who works very hard, and has hitherto gained but little money, yet matters are beginning to improve.

But yet he will lose interest in it owing to his love of pleasure and society, and though his fortune is changing for the better he has yet much anxiety through falling in love with a graceful and sprightly girl with chestnut hair and fair complexion whom he has recently met. His suit is at first favourably received, but some slanderous tales and mischief-making not altogether without foundation, come to her knowledge, though his increasing prosperity in business has led her to regard him with favour.

She, however, prefers a dark young man who is much admired generally by the fair sex, but he has already gained the affection of a young woman with dark brown hair and blue eyes.\" SECOND OPERATION (Representing the development of the Matter.) The Enquirer again carefully shuffles the cards, and places the Pack on the table face downwards, but is not to cut them. The Diviner now takes the Pack and deals it round card by card in 12 Packets face downwards in rotation as in the following diagram: (Deal and read in order of Houses against the direction of the Sun.) So that the first packet answering to the Ascendant will consist of the lst, 13th, 25th, 37th, 49th, 61st, 73rd cards, as shown, and SO on. This Operation is under the presidency of the Court Cards, <189> whose dominion in the Celestial Heavens falls immediately be- tween that of the 4 Knaves and that of the Keys answering to the 12 Signs of the Zodiac. It represents the 12 Astrological Houses of Heaven, as shown. Without altering the relative order of the packets, or of the cards in the packets, the Diviner examines each in succession, till he finds the one which contains the Significator. This he retains for reading, noting carefully to which astrological house it corresponds and gathers up the other packets, and puts them aside, as they are not of any further use in this operation. As before, the Diviner reads the packet containing the Significator, by spreading them out in the form of a horseshoe, first reading by counting the cards in order from the Significator in the direction in which the face of the figure on the card is turned, and next by pairing the cards together from the opposite ends of the horseshoe. It is hardly likely that in so small a packet there will be either 3 or 4 cards of a sort, but if there be, the Diviner takes note of the same, and also observes which suit predominates. I now continue the"},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Eight Houses examples commenced in the previous operation. I must here ob- <190> serve that the example is purely of my own invention, and of course is not contained in the Book T, wherein only the mode of working is given I have purposely taken a commonplace, trivial, and material question for elucidation. (S.RM.D.) EXAMPLE (Cont.) We will suppose the Enquirer to have duly and carefully shuffled the Cards, thinking of his affairs, and that the Diviner has dealt them round into 12 packets as above shown. The packet containing the Significator is located in the Ascendant, and it contains the following cards in the order given. This mode of reading shows that as the Sigxuficator is in the Ascendant it will principally relate to the Enquirer's manner of living at this point. The Significator is in this case right way up, whereas in the previous reading it was inverted and is looking towards the 9 of Swords, which direc- tion therefore the reading proceeds, counting thus: 4 from King of Cups- Knave of Pentacles; 7 from this-Sun; 9 from this-Knave of Pentacles; 7 from this-Sun; where the reading ends."},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"Tarot Divination 575 King of Cups \"The Enquirer is unhappy\" (looking to 9 of Swords) \"and makes the acquaintance of the girl with the dark hair and blue eyes with whom the dark young man (his rival) is in love.

THIRD OPERATION (Continuing the Development of the Question) The Enquirer again carefully shuffles the cards, while thinking earnestly of her affairs. The pack is not cut. The Diviner deals out the cards into 12 Pac- kets in precisely the same manner as in the Second Operation. Only instead of being referred to the 12 Astrological Houses, these 12 Packets are under the presidency of the 12 Keys of the Tarot attributed to the 12 Signs of the Zodiac. The first packet, Emperor-Aries, the 2nd, Hierophant-Taurus, the 3rd, Lovers-Gemini, and so on. As before the Diviner selects the packet which contains the Sigxuficator for reading, and rejects the rest. He notes also the meaning of the Key answering to the Sign of the Zodiac, under which the Packet falls. He spreads the cards out in the form of a horseshoe, exactly as before. I now continue the example before commenced. EXAMPLE We will suppose that the Packet containing the King of Cups is that whose position answers to the Hierophant-Taurus and that it consists of the following cards, arranged as in the diagram on page 192. The Hierophant and the majority of the cards in this packet <192> being Keys alike show that the forces at present at work are ceasing to be under the control of the Enquirer. The reading proceeds according to the usual order of counting, as follows: King of Cups, 2 of Wands. Magician-Queen of Wands; Universe-Tower; 2 of Wands again. It"},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"5 76 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Eight may be mentioned that supposing a packet to consist of six cards, and the Sigru£icator to be a Knave, or counting 7 from it, it would come back to the Knave again, this would show that the Enquirer would ad according to his own ideas in this point of the question, and would not let his line of action be influenced by the opinion of others. (The reading would then proceed by the pairing of the cards as usual:) kg of CUPS \"Though anxious concerning several matters, he (the Enquirer) is 2 of Wands beginning to succeed better by this line of action Magician \"which seems to be quite the best. But the older woman (who pre- viously made mischief and was represented by the Queen of Cups m Queen Wands the 1st Operation) who is artful and a gossip Universe-Tower \"again injures the matter because she wishes to get an influence over 2 of Wands the Enquirer herself.\" Pairing the cards, the Diviner proceeds: 2 of wands \"Her influence cunningly exercised, brings about a complete disrup- Tower tion of the whole matter. Universe \"The entire matter becomes invested with trickery and glamour Magician Queen of \"as she he& pays him a good deal of attention and sympathy King of Cups 2 of Pentacles \"which furthers her plans by bringing about a friendship between them.\" <193> FOURTH OPERATION ('The further development of the Question) As before the Enquirer is instructed to shuffle the pack and place it on the table but not to cut it. The Diviner takes the Pack, turns it face upwards, and goes through it, being careful not to disarrange the order of the cards, till he finds the Significator; at this point he cuts the Pack, that is to say, he takes the Sig- nificator and the cards which had been beneath it and places them on the top of the remainder, turning the whole face downwards again, ready for dealing out, (Very careful here: S.A.) The consequence of this Operation is that the Significator becomes the top card in the pack (bottom, really; face on table.) The Diviner takes off the Significator, places it face upwards on the middle of the table and then the following 36 Decanates-36 cards out in the form of a circle round it, face upwards, answering to the 36 Decanates of the Zodiac, and showing the further development of the Question. These are dealt round in the order and direction of dealing as the 12 packets in the two previous operations. The reading proceeds by the same law of counting, but instead of count- ing from the Significator itself, it begins from the first card of the 36, and always goes in the direction of dealing. The suit which is in the majority and the circumstances of either 3 or 4 cards of a sort being found in the 36 Decanates are also noted. When the reading by counting is finished the cards are paired together: 1st and 36th; 2nd and 35th; 3rd and 34th; and so on, placed in order successively upon the Significator. I now continue the exam- ple before commenced:"},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"Tarot Divination 577 E(AMPLE We will suppose the Enquirer to have shuffled the pack, and that the Diviner takes it in his hands, and in turning it up finds the bottom card to be Temperance. On going through it he comes to the Significator, thus: He therefore takes the cards from King of Cups to Temperance included and places them above (or behind, SA.) the 5 of Pentacles, being careful not to disturb their relative order. This has really the effect of cutting the pack be- tween the Queen of Wands and the King of Cups and of course when he again turns them face downwards ready for dealing, the King of Cups will necessarily be the top card and the Queen of Wands the bottom card; Tem- perance being immediately above the 5 of Pentacles, the former top <195> card. The Diviner takes the top card, the Significator and places it face upwards in the centre, and then deals round in succession 36 cards, face upwards in the order shown in the Diagram on page 194."},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"5 78 The Golden Dawn: Volume IV Book Eight Let us suppose them to be thus arranged. The reading always proceeds in the same direction as the dealing in this form of operation, commencing the counting from the 1st card dealt. We here find 12 out of the 22 keys; 7 of Wands; 7 of Cups; 5 of Swords; 6 of Pentacles; total 37 including Significator. The preponderance of the Keys represent \"Influences beyond the control of the Enquirer.\" There are four Princes (Kings)-\"Meetings with influential persons,\" and four Eights, \"Much news and correspondence.\" The counting proceeds as follows from the first card dealt. King of Cups-Six of Cups-5 of Pentacles-Hermit-4 of Cups-Fortitude-4 of Swords-7 of Cups-Justice-5 of Cups-King of Swords-Emperor-6 of Cups again. King of Cups \"The Enquirer's love of pleasure-going 6 of Cups 5 of Pentacles \"brings about loss of money and business Hermit \"and he is forced to be more prudent, \"and not go into the society of others so much, which has already 4 of CUPS brought him anxiety\" (shown by 4 Cups between 2 Wands, contrary element weakening effect on this card.) Fortitude \"He works more closely, 4 of Swords \"and begins to get better. 7 of Cups 'Yet he has not sufficient energy in his nature to stick to work for long.\" Justice 'The retributive effect of this is 5 of CUPS \"that he loses his friends.\" < 196> King of Wands \"And his former rival who, though rather a vain man, is energetic and hard working Emperor 6 of Cups \"replaces him in popularity and esteem.\" Pairing them now, the Diviner proceeds: Kin of Cups ~eafh 'The Enquirer loses pleasure in consequence 6 of Cups 4 of swords \"and becomes less energetic even than before, and more anxious for 7 of CUPS pleasure-going than ever, Moon Chariot \"yielding to the temptation of idleness and vanity by means of fraud. 8 of Swords \"He embezzles the money of his employer, and sees prison staring hi Ace of Pentacles in the face.\" 8 of Cups 'The result of this is the loss of good name Temperance of \"and of hi situation of trust. 5 of Pentacles"},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"Tarot Divination 5 79 10 of Wands 2 of Cups \"His former friends and admirers turn a cold shoulder to him. Foolish Man \"And the result of his folly is that he is arrested and brought before a Justice court of law. 7 of Wands Hierophant \"The decision is adverse Judgment Hermit \"and judgment very justly given against him.

It is always necessary for the Diviner to employ his intuition in reading, and sometimes he may have to clairvoyantly \"go through\"a card of doubtful signification. Thus in the reading just given it is only the circumstance of the Moon, Chariot, 8 of Swords, Ace of Pentacles being followed by other com- formative caids which justifies such an evil meaning of them. FIFTH OPERATION (Conclusion of the Matter) The cards are to be again carefully shuffled by the Enquirer but NOT cut. The Diviner then takes the Pack, and deals it card by card in rotation into ten answering to the Tree of Life. This refers to the rule of the 10 Sephiroth in the Celestial Heavens. This being done, the Diviner selects the packet containing the Significator for reading, noting carefully under which Sephirah it falls, and taking this as ageneral indication in the matter. This packet is then spread out in a horseshoe form, and read in the usual way, counting from <198> the Significator and this time in the direction in which the face of the figure looks. The cards are finally paired together as in the previous Operation. This completes the Mode of Divination called \"The Opening of the Key.\" I now give the conclusion of the example."},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"580 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Eight We will suppose that the cards have been shuffled and dealt in the following manner into 10 Packets answering to the Sephiroth in the Tree of Life: El 1,11,21,31,41,etc. 2 3.13.23.33. tl 2, 12,22.32. 4??,53,63,73. 42,52.62,72. 5 4 10,20,30,40,50,60,70. The packet containing the Significator falls under Binah, containing the 3,13, 23,33,43,53,63, and 73rd cards dealt. This is an argument of sadness and trial. The cards are spread as follows:"},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"Tarot Divination 581 The counting proceeds as follows: King of Cups-Star-Judgment- King of Cups again. Evil cards are in the majority, another argument of loss and trouble. King of Cups \"He has hopes of thus re-establishing his fortunes and that a favourable Star result will ensue for him.\" Judgment The diviner then pairs them thus: King of Cups \"He plunges therefore into speculation by which he loses heavily (7 7 of Pentacles Pents. is near Hanged Man.) Knave of Cups \"and hi love affair comes to nothing. Hanged Man Star Judgment \"All his expectations are disappointed Knight of \"and his life for a time is arduous, petty, and uninteresting\" 8 of Swords (The coming of trouble is here shown by the Knight of Pentacles looking against the direction of the reading. If it were turned the other way it would show that his troubles were quitting him and that matters would improve.) This completes the operation, and shows the general development and result of the question. <200> TABULATED RULES 1. Shuffling, Cutting, Dealing and Examining. In shuffling, the mind of the Enquirer should be earnestly fixed on the matter concerning which he desires information. If any cards fall in the pro- cess, they should be taken up without being noticed and the shuffling resumed. The shuffling being concluded, and the pack placed upon the table, if any cards fall to the ground, or become turned in a different direction, the shuffling should be done again. A cut should be clean and decided. If any cards fall from the hand in the performance, the operation of shuffling should be repeated before they are again cut. In dealing, care should be taken not to invert the cards, and their relative order should be strictly observed. In examining a pack of cards, their relative order should be rigidly maintained, as without care in this respect, one may be easily pushed under or over another, which would of course have the effect of completely altering the counting in the Reading. 2. Of the Selection of the Significator, and of the Complexion assigned to the Court Cards. Wands generally-fair and red-haired person. Cups generally-moderately fair. Swords generally-moderately dark. Pentacles generally-very dark. The Kings-Men. Queens- Women. Princes-Young Men. Princesses (Knaves) -Young women."},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"582 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Eight Therefore the Significators are to be thus selected. For example, a dark complexioned middle-aged man, King of Pentacles. A fair young woman, Princess (Knave) of Cups, etc. In the actual reading of the cards, these descriptions can be <201> modified by those which are on either side of them, thus: The Queen of Cups, which indicates a fair woman with golden brown hair, if between cards of the suits of Swords and Pentacles, would show a woman with rather dark brown hair and dark eyes. As before stated, the Prin- ces and Queens almost invariably represent actual men and women con- nected with the subject in hand. But the Kings sometimes represent either the coming on or going off of a matter; arrival, or departure, according to the way in which they face. While the Princesses (Knaves) show opinions, thoughts, or ideas, either in harmony with or opposed to the subject. 3. Of the Generalsignification of theMajority of a particular suit and of the particular signification of either 3 or 4 cards of a sort in a reading: A majority of Wands-Energy, quarrelling, opposition.

Idea, thought, spirituality, that which endeavours to rise above the material. (That is, if the subject which is enquired about be spirit- ual.) But if the Divination be regarding a material event of ordinary life, this card is not good, and shows folly, stupidity, eccentricity, and even mania, unless with very good cards indeed. It is too ideal and unstable to be gen- erally good in material things. 1. Magician or Juggler. Skill, wisdom, adaptation. Craft, cunning, etc., always depending on its dignity.

Differing from, though resembling in some respects, the meaning of The Magician, The Prophet, and The Lovers. Occult Wisdom. 6. The Lovers. Inspiration (passive and in some cases mediumistic, thus differing from that of the Hierophant and Magician and Prophet.) Motive, power, and action, arising from Inspiration and Impulse. <205> 7.

Divine Inspiration (but active as opposed to that of the Lovers). In the mysti- cal titles, this with the Hierophant and the Magician are the 3 Magi. 10. Wheel of Fortune.

Synthesis. World. Kingdom. Usually denotes the actual subject of the question, and therefore depends entirely on the accompanying cards. 6. On the Signification of the Cards. A card is strong or weak, well-dignified or ill-dignified, according to the cards which are next to it on either side. Cards of the same suit on either side strengthen it greatly either for good or evil, according to their nature. Cards of the suits answering to its contrary element, on either side, weaken it greatly for good or evil. Air and Earth are contraries as also are Fire and Water. Air is friendly with Water and Fire, and Fire with Air and Earth. If a card of the suit of Wands falls between a Cup anda Sword, the Sword modifies and connects the Wand with the Cup, so that it is not weakened by its vicinity, but is modified by the influence of both cards; therefore fairly strong. But if a card pass between two which are naturally contrary, it is not affected by either much, as a Wand between a Sword and a Pentacle which latter, being Air and Earth, are contrary and therefore weaken each other. Here the question being of the Wand, this card is not to be noticed as forming a link between the Sword and Pentacle. <207> A FEW EXAMPLES GIVEN BY S.R.M.D. 9 10 5 Very strong and potent in action.

If of opposite elements they mutually weaken each other. If at the end of the pairing of the cards in a packet, one card remains over, it siwes the partial result of that particular part of the Divination only. If an evil card and the others good, it would modlfy the good. If it be the Significator of the Enquirer, or of another person, it would show that matters would much depend on the line of action taken by the per- son represented. The reason of this importance of the single card is, that it is alone, and not modified. If two cards are at the end instead of a single one, they are not of so much importance. 8. On the Fxercise of ~laimoyance and Intuition. The Diviner should, in describing any person from a Significator in the actual reading, endeavour, by Clairvoyance and using the card in question as a symbol, to see the person implied using the rules to aid, and restrict, his"},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"Tarot Divination 587 vision. In describing an event from the cards in the reading, he should employ his intuition in the same manner. Personal descriptions are modified by the cards next them; e.g, the Knave of Wands represents usually a very fair girl, but if between cards of the suit of Pentacles, she might be even quite dark, though the Wands would still give a certain brightness to hair, eyes, and complexion. 9. On counting in the Reading. In all cases of counting from the card last touched, the card itself is 1, that next it is 2, and so on. From every Ace-5 is counted. From every Princess (Knave) -7 is counted. From every other Court card-4 is counted. From every small card-the number of its pips. From every Key answering to an Element-3 is counted. From every Key answering to a Sign-12 is counted. From every Key answering to a Planet-9 is counted."},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"<209> Unofficial THE TAROT TRUMPS By G. H. Soror, Q.L. The cards of the Lesser Arcana present to us the vibrations of Number, Colour and Element-that is, the plane on which number and colour func- tion. Thus, in the Ten of Pentacles we have the number Ten and tertiary colours, citrine, olive, and russet, working in Malkuth, the material plane. Whereas in the Ten of Wands we have the number Ten and the tertiaries working in pure energy. In these cards, the Sephirah is indicated by the colouring of the clouds; the plane by the colouring of the symbols The four honours of each suit taken in their most abstract sense may be interpreted as: Potential Power ......................................................................... The King Brooding Power ..................................................................... The Queen Power in action ....................................................................... The Prince Reception and Transmission ........................................... The Princess All these cards are coloured according to their elements plus the Sephirah to which they are attributed. With the Greater Arcana, the Trumps, however, we are given the Keys to divine manifestation, each one an indi- vidual force to be considered independently. It must never be forgotten that the Trumps are, intrinsically, glyphs of cosmic not human forces. 0. The Foolish Man. This card as usually presented shows a man in motley striding along, heedless of the dog which tears his garments and threatens to attack him. In this is seen only the lower aspect of the card,giving no hint to the Divine Folly of which St. Paul speaks. But in the Order pack, an effort is made to reveal the deeper meaning. A naked child stands beneath a rose-tree bearing yellow roses-the golden Rose of Joy as well as the <210> Rose of Silence. While reaching up to the Roses, he yet holds in leash a grey wolf, worldly wisdom held in check by perfect inno- cence. The colours are pale yellow, pale blue, greenish yellow-suggestive of the early dawn of a spring day. I. The Magician. It represents the union and balance of the elemental powers controlled by mind. The Adept dedicating the minor implements on the Altar. The paths of Beth and Mercury link Kether the Crown with Binah, the Aimah Elohim. The Magician, therefore, is reflected in the Intellect which stores and gathers up knowledge and pours it into the House of Life, Binah. The number of the Path, 12, suggests the synthesis of the Zodiac, as Mercury is the synthesis of the planets. The colours yellow, violet, grey and indigo, point to the mysterious astral light surrounding the great Adept. It is a card linked with the name Tahuti and Hermes as the previous one is with Krishna and Harparkrat or Dionysius. II. The High Priestess. The High Priestess rules the long path uniting 588"},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"The Tarot Trumps 589 Kether to Tiphareth, crossing the reciprocal Paths of Venus and Leo. She is the great feminine force controlling the very source of life, gathering into herself all the energising forces and holding them in solution until the time of release. Her colours, pale blue, deepening into sky blue, silvery white, and silver, relieved by touches of orange and flame, carry out these ideas. Ill. The Empress. She is an aspect of Isis; the creative and positive side of Nature is suggested here. The Egyptian trilogy, Isis, Hathor and Nephthys, symbolised by the crescent, full moon, and gibbous moon are represented in the Tarot by the High Priestess, Hathor. The Empress, Isis, takes either the crescent moon or Venus as her symbol. Justice, Nephthys, takes the gib- bous moon. Isis and Venus gives the aspect of Love, while Hathor is rather the Mys- tic, the full moon reflecting the Sun of Tiphareth while in Yesod, transmitting the rays of the Sun in her path Gimel. In interpreting a practical <211> Tarot it is often admissable to regard the Empress as standing for Occultism. The High Priestess for religion, the Church as dis- tinguished from the Order. The Empress, whose letter is Daleth, is the Door of the inner mysteries, as Venus is the door of the Vault. Her colours are emerald, sky-blue, blue- green and cerise or rose-pink. W. The Emperor. Here we have the great energising forces as indicated by the varying shades of red. It may be noted here that the red paths remain red in all planes, varying only in shade. Thus Aries, the Emperor, the Pioneer, the General, is blood and deep crimson, red, pure vermillion or flowing fiery red. He is Ho Nike, the Conqueror, hot, passionate, impetuous, the apotheosis of Mars, whether in love or in war. He is the positive masculine as the Empress is the positive feminine. V. Hierophant. The High Priest is the counterpart of the High Priestess. As Aries is the house of Mars and the exaltation of the Sun, so Taurus is the house of Venus and the exaltation of the Moon. He is the reflective or mysti- cal aspect of the masculine. He is the thinker as the Emperor is the doer. His colours unlike those of the Emperor, vary considerably. Red, orange, maroon, deep brown, and chestnut brown, suggest veiled thought, interior power, endurance, contemplation and reconciliation. This card fre- quently indicates the hidden guardianship of the Masters. V1. The Lovers. The impact of inspiration on intuition, resulting in illumination and liberation-the sword striking off the fetters of habit and materialism, Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the Dragon of fear and the waters of Stagnation. (Note: Incidentally note that this is the design of the Order card. Andromeda is shown manacled to a rock, the dragon rising from the waters at her feet. Perseus is depicted flying through the air to her assist- ance, with unsheathed sword. The design is wholly different from that of the Waite pack.-I.R.) <212> The colours are orange, violet, purplish grey and pearl grey. The flashing colour of orange gives deep vivid blue while the flash- ing colour for violet is golden yellow. The flashing colours may always be introduced if they bring out the essential colour meaning more clearly. In practise this card usually signifies sympathetic understanding."},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"590 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Eight VII. The Chariot. Here we have a symbol of the spirit of man controlling the lower principles, soul and body, and thus passing triumphantly through the astral plane, rising above the clouds of illusion and penetrating to the higher spheres. The colours amber, silver-grey, blue-grey, and the deep blue violet of the night sky elucidate this symbol. It is the sublimation of the Psyche. V111. Strength. This also represents the mastery of the lower by the higher. But in this case it is the soul which holds in check the passions, although her feet are still planted on earth, and the dark veil still floats about her head and clings around her. The colours, pale greenish yellow, black, yellowish grey and reddish amber, suggest the steadfast endurance and for- titude required, but the deep red rose which is the flashing colour to the greenish yellow, gives the motive power. IX The Hermit. Prudence. These three trumps should be collated in studying them for they represent the three stages of initiation. The man wrapped in hood and mantle, and carrying a lantern to illuminate the Path and a staff to support his footsteps, He is the eternal seeker, the Pilgrim soul. His hood and mantle are the brown of earth, and above him is the night-sky. But the delicate yellow-greens and bluish greens of spring are about him, and spring is in his heart. X Wheel ofFot.lune. In the Etz Chayim, or the Tree of Life, the Wheel is placed on the Pillar of Mercy, where it forms the principal column linking Netzach to Chesed, Victory to Mercy. It is the revolution of experience and progress, the steps of the Zodiac, the revolving staircase, held in <213> place by the counterchanging influence of Light and Darkness, Time and Eternity-presided over by the Plutonian cynocephalus below, and the Sphinx of Egypt above, the eternal Riddle which can only be solved when we attain liberation. The basic colours of this Trump are blue, violet, deep purple, and blue irradiated by yellow. But the zodiacal spokes of the wheel should be in the colours of the spectrum, while the Ape is in those of Malkuth, and the Sphinx in the primary colours and black. XI. Justice. Nephthys, the third aspect of Luna, the twin sister of Isis. Jus- tice as distinguished from love. Her emblems are the Sword and the Scales. Like her sister, she is clothed in green, but in a sharper colder green than the pure emerald of Isis. Her subsidiary colours are blue, blue-green, pale green. It is only by utilising the flashing colours that we can find the hidden warmth and steadfastness. XI1. The Hanged Man. An elusive, because a profoundly sigruficant sym- bol. It is sacrifice - the submergence of the higher in the lower in order to sublimate the lower. It is the descent of the Spirit into Matter, the incarnation of God in man, the submission to the bonds of matter that the material may be transcended and transmuted. The colours are deep blue, white and black intermingled but not merged, olive, green and greenish fawn. Xlll. Deafh. The sign of transmutation and disintegration. The skeleton which alone survives the destructive power of time, may be regarded as the foundation upon which the structure is built, the type which persists through the permutations of Time and Space, adaptable to the requirements of evolu- tion and yet radically unchanged; the transmuting power of Nature working"},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":"The Tarot Trumps 591 from below upwards, as the Hanged Man is the transmuting power of the spirit working from above downwards. The colours are blue-green, both dark and pale, the two dominant colours of the visible world, and the flashing colours of orange and red-orange. <214> XN. Temperance. This is the equilibrium not of the balance of Libra but of the impetus of the Arrow, Sagittarius, which cleaves its way through the air by the force imparted to it by the taut string of the Bow. It requires the counterchanged forces of Fire and Water, Shin and Qoph, held by the restraining power of Saturn, and concentrated by the energies of Mars to initiate this impetus. All these are summed up in the symbolism of the figure standing between Earth and Water, holding the two amphorae with their streams of living water, and with the volcano in the background. The colours are bright-blue, blue-grey, slate-blue, and lilac-grey. XV. The Devil. This card should be studied in coniundion with No. 13. They are the two great controlling forces of the ~niverie, the centrifugal and the centripetal, destructive and reproductive, dynamic and static. The lower nature of man fears and hates the transmuting process; hence the chains binding the lesser figures and the bestial forms of their lower limbs. Yet this very fear of change and disintegration is necessary to stabilise the life-force and preserve continuity. The colours are indigo, livid brown, golden brown and grey. XV1, The Tower. As always red remains persistent throughout the four planes, although modified in tone. Thus we find vivid scarlet shading into deep sombre red and vermillion shot with amber. The contrasting shades of green serve to throw the red into relief. The tremendous destructive in- fluence of the lightning, rending asunder established forms to make way for new forms to emerge, revolution as distinguished from transmutation or sublimation, the destructive as opposed to the conservative, energy attack- ing inertia, the impetuous ejection of those who would enclose themselves in the walls of ease -&id tradition. XV11. The Star. This shows the seven-pointed Star of Venus shining above the Waters of Aquarius, the guiding force of love in all its forms and aspects, illuminates the soul during her immersion in Humanity, so <215> that the bonds of Saturn are dissolved in the purified Waters of Bap- tism. The dove of the Spirit hovers above the Tree of Knowledge giving the promise of ultimate attainment - and on the other side gleams of the Tree of Life. Pale colours suggest dawn and the morning Star - amethyst, pale grey, fawn, dove colour and white, with the pale yellow of the Star. XVIII. The Moon. Here also is a river but it is the troubled waters of Night, wherein is to be described a crayfish, counterpart of the Scarabeus. From the water's edge winds the dark path of toil, effort and possible failure. It is guarded by the threatening watchdogs, seeking to intimidate the way- farers, while in the distance the barren hills are surmounted by the frowning fortresses still further guarding the way to attainment. It is the path of blood and tears in which fear, weakness, and fluctuation must be overcome. The colours arc dark crimson, reddish brown, brownish crimson and plum colours -- but their sombre hues are lightened by the translucent faint"},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"592 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Eight greens and yellows to be found in their counterparts. XIX The Sun. The Watery Paths of trial and probation are counterbal- anced by the fiery paths of Temptation, Judgment, and Decision. In violent contrast to the sombre colouring of Aquarius and Pisces, we are confronted by the flaring hues of the Sun and Fire. The too-aspiring Icarus may find his waxen wings of Ambition and Curiosity shrivelled and melted by the fiery rays of the Sun and the heat of Fire, but approached with humility and reverence, the Sun becomes the beneficient source of life. Protected by an enclosing wall, standing by the Waters of repentance, the Pilgram may submit himself humbly but without fear to the searching Light and absorb warmth and vitality from it for the struggle before him. The colours are clear-orange, golden-yellow, amber shot with red, and the con- trasting blue and purple. <216> XX The Last Judgment. The three trumps attributed to the Elemental Paths are perhaps the most difficult to understand. They represent the action of forces exterior to the experience of humanity, not the influence of environment but the impact of the Supernals upon the sub- lunary. In the Air we have pure spirit holding in leash the lust of the flesh. In water, the sublimating power of sacrifice. Here in Fire, we are shown the cos- mic forces concentrating on the pilgram from all sides. Judgment is pro- nounced upon him. He is not the judge nor does decision rest in his hands. Lazarus cannot emerge from the Sepulchre until the voice cries out, \"Come forth!\" Nor can he cast aside the conflicting grave-clothes until the com- mand, \"Loose him!\" is given. Man of himself is helpless. The impulse to ascend must come from above, but by its power he may transcend the sepulchre of environment and cast aside the trammels of desire. Here once more, the fiery energy of red bums through the planes. Fiery scarlet, glowing crimson, burning red are emphasized by the passive greens. XXI. The Universe. Observe that this represents not the World but the Universe. It should be remembered that to the ancients, Saturn represented the confines of the Solar system. They had no means of measuring either Uranus or Neptune. To them, therefore, Saturn passing through the spiral path of the Zodiac, marked at its cardinal points by the symbols of the Kerubim fonning the Cross, was a comprehensive glyph of the whole. Thus, in this card we find a synthesis of the whole Taro or Rota. The cen- tral figure should be taken as Hathor, Athor, or Ator, rather than Isis, thus indicating the hidden anagram which may perhaps be translated thus: ORAT - man prays. ATOR - to the Great Mother. TARO - who turns. ROTA - the wheel of Me and Death. The colours like those of the Wheel of Fortune include the <217> colours of the Spectrum and those of the elements, but they are placed against the indigo and black of a Saturn, with the white gleam of the Stars shining in the darkness and the misty figure of the Aimah Elohim in the midst. In the practical Tarot, this card is taken to sign* the matter in hand, that is the subject of any question that has been asked.

It is a process in which the whole Universe does not disdain to take part, for Man is himself the Microcosm of the Mac- rocosm and the Child of the Gods. And again, the Macrocosm must itself be undergoing a corresponding process in which the experience not only of humanity but of each individual must be an integral part. The fragments are gathered up into the baskets, that nothing may be lost; and from the feeding of the multitude there remains not less but more than the unbroken bread and fish - fit emblems of Earth and Water. Cease not to seek day and night the Purifying Mysteries. (Note: This paper on the Trumps is not an official document. It should be conceived rather in the nature of a so-called Side Lecture or Flying Roll. That is not to say that it is unimportant, or that there is little of interest therein.

It represents the Heavens polarized on the plane of the Ecliptic, not on the plane of the Equator of our Earth, so that its North Pole is the veritable North Pole of our Heavens and not merely that part of them to which the North Pole of our Earth now points. Another very important difference is that, throughout the true Tarot, the teaching assigns the commencing Point of the Zodiac to the bright Star \"Regulus\" which is in Leo. And it measures Right Ascension and Longitude from that point, and not from a suppositious point divided by the Equinox and called the 0\" of Aries (though in reality now far removed from the con- stellation of that name), which has been adopted by modern or western astronomy and astrology. By this now usual way of reckoning, and the Precession of the Equi- noxes, it has gradually come to pass that the signs (or divisions, each of 30°, of the Zodiac) no longer coincide with the constellations of the same name, and each decade of years shows them slowly but surely receding. But the Tarot method of reckoning from the star named Regulus has, it will be seen, the effect of making the Signs and the Constellations coin- cide. \"Regulus\" is also named Cor Leonis - \"The Heart of the Lion.\" \"Reg- ulus\"means \"Star of the Prince.\"l'Regulus\"coincides with the position of the \"heart\" in the figure of Leo upon the Star Maps. <219> (Note: The principia or fundamental ideas of this astronomical view of the Tarot may be found, as least in its essential form, in the astronomical writings of Claudius Ptolemy of Alexandria. Naturally, this reference only concerns the signs, constellations and other astronomical divisions noted. The expansion of this scheme, and its allocation to other forms of universal symbolism, such as the Tarot cards, Hebrew letters, and Enochian Tablets, has its roots in the synthetic genius of the Golden Dawn. The idea of projecting the Tree of Life into a solid sphere, having application among other things to the starry heavens and the constellations, <220> certainly is peculiar to this system alone. Most of the fundamentals inhering in the other aspects of the Golden Dawn teaching may be found in exoteric occult literature of past centuries. But, as again I must insist, the peculiar practical application of them as exemplified in the Golden Dawn routine can nowhere else be found, save, of course, in other authentic esoteric systems.

(Abridged Treatise arranged for the use of the Z.A.M. 's in Anglia by S.RM. D.) The Zelator Adeptus Minor shall know that the great \"King Star\" or \"Heart of the Lion,\" which is in Leo upon the path of the Ecliptic and one of the \"Four Tiphareth Points\" (see later) of the Celestial Heavens, is the com- mencement and Ruler of all our reckoning of Longitude (or Ecliptic). The Path of the Sun itself is the commencement of our reckoning of the Latitude in the searching out of our Hidden Wisdom. Also the Dragon, the constellation Draco, surroundeth the Pole Kether of our Celestial Heavens. But the Northern Pole and Kether of the Material Planet (even of our Erthe, earth) looketh constantly unto Binah, for as much as she is under sorrow and suffering. When, oh Lord of the Universe, shall she turn from her evil ways so that she shall again behold Kether? Wherefore she is now a place of trial. For each thing in this world of Assiah looketh towards that which is its Natural Governor, and to what part of the Celestial Heavens the Kether of a Planet constantly looketh, by that part is that Planet ruled. For in all things shine the Sephiroth even as hath been sufficiently said. The Four Knaves (Princesses) rule the celestial Heavens from the North Pole of the Zodiac to the 45\" of Latitude North of the Ecliptic. They form the Thrones of the Four Aces, who rule in Kether. The Four Kings, 4 Queens, 4 Princes rule the Celestial Heavens from the 45\" of North Latitude down to the Ecliptic. The 12 Tarot Keys attributed to the 12 Signs of the Zodiac rule the Celestial Heavens from the Ecliptic, down to the 45\" of South Latitude. The 36 smaller cards of the Suits (from two to ten) rule the Celestial Heavens from the 45\" South of the Ecliptic to the South Pole, or the Malkuth <222> place therein. And all calculation arises from the Star \"Regulus,\" the 0\" of our Leo.

The centre is the most pronounced in its accord with the nature of its Ruler, and the two outer portions are tinged with the nature of the Ruler of the dominion bordering thereon. For example, in the case of Leo, the Dominion of Fortitude, the central 10 degrees will have most of this nature. For the beginning ten degrees are tinged with the nature of Cancer, and the last ten degrees with the nature of Virgo, the nature of Leo however predominating the mixture. The whole Heavens then, are thus divided into Four Great Belts or Zones: The Uppemost being the Dominion of the Knaves like a Cross within a Circle. The Second Belt under the Dominion of the other Court cards represents a Belt of Influence descending vertically. The Third Belt under the Dominion of the 12 Keys related to the Signs of the Zodiac, represents a Belt of Influence acting horizon- tally. This Zone in union with the second Belt will therefore yield a great Zone of 12 Crosses encircling the heavens. The Fourth Belt consists of 36 Decans under the Dominion of the 36 small cards of the four suits, the numbers 2-10 of each suit. In each of these sets of 3 parts of a Sign, the central one will be more pronounced in effect than the lateral parts.

This latter Sephirah together with that of Yesod will be completely hidden from view, so that Tiphareth will be the exact centre of the Sphere. Also the Sephiroth Chokmah, Binah, Chesed, Geburah, Netzach and Hod will be duplicated. As also the Paths, Aleph, Beth, Gimel, Vau, Cheth, Caph, Mem, Qoph, and Shin, and so many of the others will be even quad- rupled. But although Tiphareth and Yesod will be concealed, there will be four especial points where the influence of each will be indicated. As projected in the before-described Celestial Sphere, Kether will gov- em a Radius of 10\" around the North Pole, thus embracing the whole body of the Constellation Draco. Chokmah will be on the 60\" North Latitude; embracing a radius of 10°, the right foot of Hercules; the left arm, hand, and part of head of Bootes. Also on the other side of the Heavens, a radius of 10\" including the head and shoulders of Cepheus, and the head of Lacerta. Binah, has a similar radius and is posited on the same parallel of <232> Latitudes, and includes the pole Star of the Earth, the head of Camelopardelus, the tip of the tail of Draco; also Lyra and left knee of Hercules in the opposite side of the Heavens. Chesed with a similar radius, and posited in the 30\" of North Latitude, will include part of Coma Berenices, of Bootes, and of Virgo, and parts of Andromeda and of Pegasus. And so with the other Sephiroth of the outer Pillars, each being 30\" dis- tant from the line of the Sephiroth above and below it, and having a radius of 10\". The central line of the Two Pillars of Mercy and Severity will respec- tively traverse, that of Mercy the 15\" of Virgo and 15\" of Pisces; that of Severity the 15\" of Gemini and the 15\" of Sagittarius. The four Yesod points will be on the line of the 60\" of South Latitude, and at similar Zodiacal points. From which circumstances the path of Influence or nature of the Sun will be along the line of the Ecliptic, coinciding with Tiphareth, and that of the Moon will be on the 60\" of South Latitude answering to the Yesod points on that line. <236> THE LAW OF THE CONVOLUTED REVOLUTION OF THE FORCES SYMBOLISED BY THE FOUR ACES ROUND THE NORTHERN POLE (Note: Though this is not official to the grade of Zelator Adeptus Minor, nor included within the general Tarot instructions usually issued, it is mani- festly written by Greatly Honoured Frater S.R.M.D. Some students consider it a highly important piece of work, claiming that it was part of the study pre- scribed for the Theoricus Adeptus Minor.

In the Book \"T,\" it is written: ''Also the Dragon (i.e. Draco, the constella- tion at the Northern pole of the Heavens) surroundeth the Pole Kether of the Celestial Heavens.\"It is further laid down that the Four Aces, (symbolised by the Princesses and Amazons), rule the Celestial Heavens from the Northern Pole of the Zodiac unto the 45th Degree of Latitude North of the Ecliptic, and from the Thrones of the Four Aces which rule in Kether. And again it is stated that: The Throne of the Ace of Cups ...............................................

Now in the Four Faces of YHVH, Fire and Water be contrary, and also Earth and Air be contrary. And the throne of the Element will attract and seize, as it were, the Force of that element, so that herein be the Forces of Antipathy and of Sympathy, or what are known chemically as attraction and repulsion. Recall also the allotment of the Triplicities: Aries, Leo, Sagittarius = Fire = Wands of the Tarot. Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces = Water = Cups of the Tarot. Gemini, Libra, Aquarius = Air = Swords of the Tarot. Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn = Earth = Pentacles of the Tarot. Now, the order of the Princesses, and consequently of the Thrones, is formed from right to left thus: Heh (final) Vau Heh Yod Princess Princess Princess Princess of of of of Pentacles Swords Cups Wands Taurus Aquarius Scorpio Leo Earth Air Water Fire While that of the Aces is formed from left to right, though their motion is from right to left: Yod Heh Vau Heh (final) Ace Ace Ace Ace of of of of Wands Cups Swords Pentacles This, then will be the order of their movement.

In the ordinary course the Ace of Wands would pass to Station 3; the Ace of Cups to Station 2; the Ace of Swords to Station 1; the Ace of Pen- tacles to Station 12. <238> But the Station 2, being the Throne of the Ace of Wands,attracts and arrests the movement of that Force so that instead of passing into Station 3, it remains on Station 2 until the other Aces have passed over it in turn. Ace of Wands remains on Station 2, Ace of Cups passes also on to Station 2, Ace of Swords passes on to Station 1, Ace of Pentacles passes on to Station 12. Again, Ace of Cups passes to Station 3, Ace of Wands remains at Station 2, Ace of Swords passes also on to Station 2, Ace of Pentacles passes also on to Station 1. Again, Ace of Cups passes on to Station 4, Ace of Swords passes on to Station 3, Ace of Wands remains at Station 2, Ace of Pentacles passes also on to Station 2. Again, Ace of Cups passes to Station 5, Ace of Swords passes to Station 4, Ace of Pentacles passes on to Station 3, Ace of Wands still remains on Station 2. But Station 5 is the Throne of the Ace of Cups. Therefore it attracts and arrests that Force, in the same manner that the Throne of the Ace of Wands acted previously in attracting and arresting the Ace of Wands, the result of which has been to make that Force which previously was leading become the last of the Four. Again, Ace of Cups remains on Station 5, Ace of Swords passes also on to Station 5, Ace of Pentacles passes also on to Station 4, Ace of Wands, now at last passes into Station 3.

Wherefore all these Forces combining, at length cause it to move forward. The movement then continues, thus: The Ace of Swords passes on to Station 6, The Ace of Cups remains on Station 5,"},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":"Tree of Life in a Sphere The Ace of Pentacles passes also on to Station 5, The Ace of Wands passes also on to Station 4.

Again, The Ace of Swords remains on Station 8, The Ace of Pentacles passes also on to Station 8, The Ace of Wands passes on to Station 7, The Ace of Cups now at length passes on to Station 6, and so on. The movement of the Aces will be very similar to the convolutions of Draco thus: The Course of the Aces: And will imply a much more sustained exercise of force through the Thrones than elsewhere. So that the generic effect of the Thrones will be that of the seasons, while the other stations will give the variations thereof in <241> accordance with their natures and with the order of the movement of the aces in them. And as Kether acted directly upon Tiphareth which is, as it were, the centre and focus of the Sephiroth when projected in a sphere, so do the Aces ad upon the Sun as the centre and focus of the Solar System. So that the Sun, according to his position with regard to the Equinox and the Earth's surface will translate the effect of the seasons, he being the translator of the force of heat thereto, whether the then position of the Equinoctial points coincide with what we call 0\" Aries, and 0\" Libra (reckoning from Regulus) or not. So that his effect North of the Equator shall produce when just leaving the Equinoctial point, the effect of Aries, whether he be with that constellation actually in the heavens or not. Conversely also, for the South of the Equator (as in the country of Aus- tralia) his quitting the Equinoctial point southward will translate the same effect of Aries. But this rule shall not for one moment affirm that Aries and Libra are identical in nature. Nor that the Zodiac proper is inoperative. Nor that the nature of the Sun is not modified by the constellation in which he is.

And now as the Forces symbolized by these Aces, pass in succession over these stations, so will they awake certain terrestrial action, according unto the sign of the division of the Zodiac above which they pass in the do- main of the Knaves of Princesses, and according unto the nature thereof. Nevertheless, the force roused by the Ace when on its Throne will be of longer duration than at other points. And hence it is that the Signs of the Zodiac be divided into <242> Fixed or Kerubic, Moveable or changing, and common or fluctuat- ing, according unto the nature of the power which can be awakened therein. And again, these will be varied according unto their Elements, for the Elements have a various classification. NOTE BY S.RM.D. I think it is here advisable to transcribe the following from Cornelius Agrippa: \"Of The Four Ekts and Their Natural Qualities: \"It is necessary that we should know and understand the nature and quality of the Four Elements, in order to our being perfect in the principles and groundwork of our studies in the Talismanic or Magical Art. \"Therefore, there are four Elements, the original grounds of all cor- poreal things, viz.: Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, of which elements all inferior bodies are compounded, not by way of being heaped up together, but by transmutation and union; and when they are destroyed, they are resolved into elements. \"But there are none of the sensible elements that are pure. But they are more or less mixed, and apt to be changed the one into the other, even as earth being moistened and dissolved becomes water, but the same being made thick and hard becomes earth again, and being evaporated through heat it passes into air, and that being kindled into fire; and this being ex- tinguished into air again; but being cooled after burning becomes water again, or else stone or sulphur, and this is clearly demonstrated by light- ning. \"Now every one of these Elements has two specific qualities: the former whereof it retains as proper to itself; in the other as a mean, it agrees with that which comes directly after it. For Fire is hot and dry; Water cold and moist; and Air hot and moist; and so in this manner, the Elements, according to two contrary qualities are opposite one to the other, as Fire to Water, and Earth to Air. ''Likewise the Elements are contrary one to the other on another ac- count. Two are heavy, as Earth and Water; and the others are light, as <244> Fire and Air. Therefore the stoics called the former 'passives,' but the latter 'actives.' And Plato distinguishes them after another man- ner, and assigns to each of them three qualities, viz.: To the Fire brightness, thinness and motion. To the Earth, darkness, thickness, and quietness. And according to these qualities the Elements of Fire and Earth are contrary. Now"},{"pageNumber":630,"pageContent":"612 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Eight the other Elements borrow their qualities from these, so that the Air receives two qualities from the Fire, thinness and motion, and from the Earth one, darkness. In like manner, Water receives two qualities from the Earth, dark- ness and thickness; and from the Fire one, motion. But Fire is twice as thin as Air, thrice more moveable, and four times lighter. The Air is twice more bright, thrice more thin, and four times more moveable than Water. There- fore, as Fire is to Air, so is Air to Water, and Water to Earth. And again, as the Earth is to the Water, so is Water to Air, and Air to Fire. And this is the root and foundation of all bodies, natures, and wonderful works. And he who can know and thoroughly understand these qualities of the Elements and their mixtures shall bring to pass wonderful and astonishing things in Magic. \"Now each of these Elements has a threefold consideration, so that the number of four may make up the number of twelve; and by passing by the number of seven into ten, there may be a progress to the Supreme Unity upon which all virtue and wonderful things do depend. Of the first Order, are the pure Elements, which are neither compounded, changed, nor mixed, but are incorruptible and not of which but through which the virtues of all natural things are brought forth to act. No man is fully able to declare their Virtues, because they can do all things upon all things. He who remains ignorant of < 243 > TABLE SHOWING QUALITIES OF ELEMENTS A Heat, dryness, excessive lightness, brilliance, excessive subtlety, motion rapid.

These are the infallible medium, and are called the Middle Nature, or Soul of the Middle Nature; very few there are that understand the deep mysteries thereof. In them is, by means of certain numbers, degrees and orders, the perfection of every effect in what thing soever, whether natural, celestial, or super-celestial. They are full of wonders and mysteries, and are operative in Magic, natural or divine. For, from these, through them, pro- ceeds the binding, loosing, and transmutation of all things - the knowledge and foretelling of things to come, also the expelling of evil and the gaining of Good Spirits. Let no one, therefore, without these three sorts of Elements, and the true knowledge thereof, be confident that he can work anything in the occult science of Magic and Nature. \"But whosoever shall know how to reduce those of one order into another, impure into pure, compounded into simple, and shall understand distinctly the nature, virtue, and power of them, into number, degrees and order, without dividing the substance, he shall easily attain to the knowledge and perfect operation of all natural things, and celestial secrets likewise; and this is the perfection of the Qabalah, which teaches all these before men- tioned; and by a perfect knowledge thereof, we perform many rare and won- derful experiments. In the original and exemplary world all things are all in all. So also in this corporeal world. And the elements are not only in these inferior things; but are in the Heavens, in stars, in devils, in angels, and likewise in God Himself, the maker and original example of all things. \"Now it must be understood that in these inferior bodies the <246> elements are gross and corruptible, but in the heavens they are, with their natures and virtues, after a celestial and more excellent man- ner than in sublunary things. For the firmness of the celestial Earth is there without the grossness of Water, and the agility of Air without exceeding its bounds. The heat of Fire without burning, only shining, giving light and life to all things by its celestial heat.\" End of transcription. Now the successive effect of the passage of the Aces over the Stations above the place of a Sign in the excitement of the Forces of that Sign may be readily calculated by the tables of the qualities of the elements simple and mixed, always being careful to take also into account the effect of the Throne upon the Season as well, and the nature of the Sign. It is said that Kether is in Malkuth, and again, that Malkuth is in Kether but after another manner. For downwards through the Four Worlds the Malkuth of the less ma- terial will be linked unto the Kether of the more material.

And the connecting thread of the AIN SOPH is extended through the worlds of the Ten Sephiroth and is in every direction. As the Ten Sephiroth operate in each Sephiroth, so will there be a KETHER in every MALKUTH, and Malkuth in every Kether. Thus: ADONAI MELEKH will be the MALKUTH of ATZILUTH, METATRON will be the KETHER of BRIAH. SANDALPHON METRATON will be the MALKUTH of BRIAH. NEPHESCH ha-MESSIAH CHAIOTH ha QADESH will be the KETHER of YETZIRAH. ASCHIM will be the MALKUTH of YETZIRAH. <247> RASI-IITH ha GILGALIM, the KETHER of ASSIAH. CHOLEM YESODOTH, the MALKUTH of ASSIAH. THAUMIEL, the KETHER of the QWPOTH. The symbol of the connection between MALKUTH of YETZIRAH and KETHER of ASSIAH will be of a form somewhat resembling that of an hour glass.

And also the modus operandi of the translation of force from one plane into another is in this, and hence doth the title of the Sphere of Kether of Assiah signify the commencement of a whirling motion. Now also, in the diagram of Minutum Mundum, there be four colours attributed unto Malkuth. Citrine, russet, olive, andblack. And if we consider them as in a vertical sphere, we shall find citrine uppermost and horizontal, russet and olive midmost and vertical, black lowermost and horizontal. And again, these four represent in a manner the operation of the four elements in Malkuth; for example: Citrine-Air of Earth Russet-Fire of Earth Olive-Water of Earth Black-Earth of Earth <248> From the diagram of the hour glass symbol it will be manifest"},{"pageNumber":633,"pageContent":"Tree of Life in a Sphere then that MALKUTH of YETZIRAH will be the transmitter of the Yetziratic forces unto KETHER of ASSIAH, and that the latter will be the recipient thereof, and that the Hour-glass symbol or double cone, will be the translator from the one plane unto the other. Here, therefore, let us consider the Yet- ziratic nomenclature of the Tenth Path answering unto Malkuth, and of the First Path answering unto Kether. The Tenth Path: It is called the Resplendent Intelligence and it is so-called because it is exalted above every head, and sitteth on the Throne of Binah, and it illuminateth the splendour of all the Lights, and it causeth the current of Influence to flow from the Prince of Countenances, i.e. Metatron. The First Path: It is called the Wonderful or Hidden Intelligence (The Highest Crown) for it is the Light to cause to understand the Primordial without commencement, and it is the Primal Glory, for nothing created is worthy to follow out its essence. Whence it is plain that MALKUTH is, as it were, the collector together and synthesis of all the forces in its plane or world. While KETHER being su- perior unto all else in its plane or world, will be the recipient and arranger of the forces from the plane beyond, so as to distribute them unto its subor- dinate Sephiroth in a duly ordered manner. And therefore any force of the multitudinous and innumerable forces in Malkuth may act through the upper cone of the hourglass symbol, and by means of the lower one translate its operation into KETHER below, but its mode of transmission will be through the cones by the thread of the Ain Soph, or of the Unformulated. So that in the transmission of force between two worlds the Formulate must first become Unformulate, ere it can reformulate in new con- <249> ditions. For it must be plain that a force formulated in one world, if translated into another will be unfomulated, according to the laws of a plane different in nature. Even as water in its fluid state will be subject to dif- ferent laws to those governing it when in the conditions of either ice of steam. And as before said, there being in the Minutum Mundum diagram four chief elemental divisions of the Sephirah MALKUTH, each of these will have its correlative formula of transmission unto the succeeding Kether. Hence also in the Order Tarot teaching is there the Dominion of the four Knaves or Princesses of the Tarot pack around the North Pole. Why then is it that it is the Four Amazons or Knaves, answering unto the final Heh of YHVH, that are here placed, rather than the Four Kings, Queens or Princes, or one of each nature? We are taught that these are the Vice Regents of the name in the Four Worlds, and that they are thus attributed among the Sephiroth. Yod Heh Vau Heh (final) Chokmah Binah Tiphareth Malkuth King Queen Prince Princess Now as Kether of Assiah is to receive from Malkuth of Yetzirah, it is necessary that in and about Kether there should be a force which partaketh of the nature of Malkuth, though more subtle and refined in nature. And there-"},{"pageNumber":634,"pageContent":"616 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Eight fore is it that the final Heh, or Princess force, have their dominion placed about Kether. They are so placed that they may attract from the Malkuth of the Higher and form the basis of action for the Aces. So that a refined matter may attract its like, and the spiritual forces may not lose themselves in the void, to produce but a mistaken and whirling destruction for want of a settled basis. And herein is the mutual formula in all things, of a spirit and of a body, seeing that each supplies unto each that wherein the other is lack- <250> ing, yet herein also must there be h certain condition, otherwise the harmony will not be perfect. For unless the body be refined in nature, it will hinder the action of a spirit cognate unto it. And unless the spirit be will- ing to ally itself unto the body, the latter will be injured thereby and each will mutually react on the other.

Lines of dashes show the mode in which these lies are caught and con- voluted by the Hour-Glass symbol"},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"Tree of Life in a Sphere 617 Therefore, also, let the Adeptus Minor understand that there <251> may be fault of the spirit as well as of the body, and that there is little difference between the material and sensuous person, and the envious, malicious and self-righteous person - save that from their being more subtle and less evident, the sins of the latter are more insidious than those of the former, though both are alike evil. But it is as necessary to govern the Spirit as to refine the body, and of what use is it to weaken the body by abstinence, if at the same time uncharitableness and spiritual pride are encouraged! It is simply translating one sin into another. And therefore are the final Heh forces so necessary in Kether, as it is said in the Tenth Path of the Sepher Yetzirah: \"It is so called because it is exalted above every head, and sitteth on the Throne of Binah.\" Now, in the Tree, the two Sephiroth, Chokmah and Binah, are referred unto the Briatic World which is also called the Throne or vehicle, that is of the Atzilutic World unto which latter Kether is referred on the Tree. And referring unto the dominions of the Four Princesses, thou shalt find that in the sphere they include Chok- mah and Binah as well as Kether. Now there will be, not one, but four formulae of the application of the Four Forces of Malkuth, unto the revolution of the Aces in Kether, and these acting not singly but simultaneously and with a different degree of force. Were Malkuth or Kether in the same plane or world the transmission of these forces from the one unto the other would proceed more or less in direct lines. In this case, seeing that Malkuth and Kether be in different planes or worlds, the lines of transmission of these forces are caught up and whirled about by the upper cone of the hour glass symbol into the vortex where through passeth the thread of the unformulated, i.e. the Ain Soph. Thence they are projected in a whirling convolution (yet according unto their nature) through the lower cone of the hourglass symbol unto Kether. Whence it resulteth that these formulae are of the nature of the <252> Dragon, that is to say, moving in convolutions, and hence they are called the Dragon or Serpent Formulae. Now imagining MALKUTH of Yetzirah to be in a vertical position above Kether of Assiah, it will be plain that the whole of the black part of Malkuth will be towards Kether, but only a portion of the russet and olive parts, and that the citrine parts will be entirely removed and on the further side. Wherefore the natural operation of these four forces towards Kether will be: black, rather horizontal than vertical, and acting fully. Citrine rather horizon- tal than vertical but acting at the edge of the circumference of Kether, and slightly rather than strongly. Russet and olive rather vertical than horizontal, and acting moderately. <253> Now these four formulae will imply four simultaneous move- ments in the revolution of the forces symbolised by the four aces round the Northern Pole. The first and most forcible in its immediate action will be that answering unto the Earth of Malkuth of Yetzirah, transmitting unto Kether of Assiah, and following the convolutions of the Constellation Draco. It is called the Direct or Creeping Formula and for this reason the Dragon may be wingless and footed as regards its symbolic representation. This formula has been thor-"},{"pageNumber":636,"pageContent":"The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Eight DIRECT OR CREEPING FORMULA oughly explained in the beginning of this section on the revolution of the Aces. In the expressions Earth of Malkuth, etc., it should be remembered that these do not imply pure but mixed elemental natures, seeing that Malkuth receiveth the ultimate effect of all the forces in the Tree of Life, even as the colours which be attributed thereto be not primaries, but tertiaries. There- fore each element in Malkuth will be counterchanged with others, even as the Kerubim in the Kerubim in the Vision of Ezekiel have each, not one but four heads and counterchanged. The second and least forcible in its immediate action will be the Dragon formula answering unto the Air of Malkuth of Yetzirah, transmitting unto Kether of Assiah, and following the convolutions of four serpents upon the four triplicities of the elements in the Zodiac or more properly speaking, upon the stations in the Dominions of the Princesses above them. (Now also the Throne in each Dominion is marked in the Book T as embracing more than a third of each dominion, because of the enduring effect of its force.) This formula is also called the looped or Flying Fomula, and hence the serpents may be represented footless, but winged. Its action is more round the cir- cumference at its edge, than that of the other formulae. This formula of operations will be readily understood on reference to the diagram thereof, but more especially from the four diagrams showing the change of order and course of the aces. In this formula the heads of the four serpents will"},{"pageNumber":637,"pageContent":"Tree of Life in a Sphere 619 be above the four cardinal signs. <254> The Third Dragon Formula, moderately forcible in its immediate action, is that answering unto the Fire of Malkuth of Yetzirah, Transmitting unto Kether of Assiah, and following the law of the attraction and repulsion of the elements of the triplicities of the Zodiac. This is also called the Leaping or Darting Formula, and its serpents may be represented both footed and winged - footed to represent the attraction of the elements, winged to represent the repulsion by the contrary elements. This formula is more vertical in action, while the preceding two are more horizontal as LOOPED OR FLMNG FORMULA before shown. This formula will be readily understood from the four dia- grams thereof and also from those showing the change of order in the course of the Aces. As before the heads of the serpents rest upon the Stations above the Cardinal Signs. The explanation of the course of one of the four serpents will be <255> sufficient to explain the whole.

REVOLVMG OR KOWING FORMULA The Fourth Dragon Formula and moderately forcible, is that answering unto the Water of MALKUTH of Yetzirah, transmitting into the Kether of Assiah, and following the Law of the Zodiacal succession of the Signs in gradual Order. This is also called the Reuolving or Flowing Formula, and its serpent may be represented neither winged nor footed, but with fins to sym- <257> bolise its flowing movement. This formula will be more vertical in action, and can be readily understood from the diagram thereof, and from those showing the change of order in the course of the Aces. This formula may be best symbolically represented by the four Aces revolving as in a smaller wheel upon a great circle whose body is composed of the powers of the twelve Signs, so that this latter in its turn revolves upon the stations above the Zodiac. The effect of the revolution of the Wheel of the Aces will be to excite by the Ace of Wands the Fiery Signs, by the Ace of Cups the Watery Signs, by the Ace of Swords the Auy Signs, and by the Ace of Penta- cles the Earthy Signs. Yet through the forces of the revolution of the Serpent as well, the forces of the Aces will be in their turn modified by the zodiacal natures in the body of the Serpent. And as before said the action of these formulae will be simultaneous though differing in degree, and of them all that first explained which fol- loweth the convolutions of the Constellation Draco is the strongest in opera- tion. And it is to be noted that in two of these formulae, the heads of the Serpents are with the Order of the Signs, and in the other two against the natural order of succession of them in the Zodiac. Also the action of the Spirit of Malkuth of Yetzirah transmitting unto Kether of Assiah will equal that of continued vibratory rays, acting from the centre to the circumference, and thus bringing into action the force from the \"Thread of the Unformulate\" MEZLA. Recall that which is written in the Chapter of the Chariot-(Ezekiel, 1.45.) \"And I beheld, and lo! a tempestuous whirlwind came out from the North, a mighty cloud, and a fire violently whirling upon itself, and a splen- dour revolving upon itself, and from the midmost as an eye of brightness from the midst of the fire. And from the midmost the forms of the Four Chaioth.\""},{"pageNumber":640,"pageContent":"BOOK NINE THE ANGELIC TABLETS"},{"pageNumber":641,"pageContent":"<260> INTRODUCTION TO THE ENBCHIAN SYSTEM To the First Order of the Golden Dawn little was said of the Angelic Tablets or Watch Towers. They were mentioned in the Grade Rituals but their subject matter did not enter into the Knowledge Lectures directly. But the detailed study of the Tablets and the method of using them with the Enochian invocations for skrylng in the Spirit-Vision formed a definite part of the course of work prescribed for the Adeptus Minor of the RR et A.C., though I have never met anybody who had done it with any degree of thoroughness.1 There was a considerable mass of detailed and highly complex instruc- tion on this subject, contained in a number of documents. There are in my possession manuscripts totalling at least 70,000 words, besides some large charts, diagrams and coloured boards. Therefore it has been found necessary to provide a paper which attempts to cover the whole ground in logical sequence giving quotations where necessary from the original documents of G.H. Frater D.D.C.F. This probably will be of more general use than repro- ducing the whole rather disconnected mass of Enochian literature, which in many cases is simply a development of the fundamentals, and thus can be worked up by each individual reader who studies this book. <261> At the outset, let it be said that a good deal of systematic study will be required to appreciate the value and subtle sigruficance of this system. It is one of the most amazing magical schemes that I have ever encountered, since it provides a thorough-going and comprehensive syn- thesis of the entire magical system of the Golden Dawn. Every important item of knowledge and pratice found itself incorporated within the scope of these Angelic Tablets. Every worth-while technical form of Magical pro- cedure and all branches of ritualistic work find themselves represented in a single noble system.2 'Israel Regardie was a member of the Hermes Lodge for only a brief time in the 1930'9, his main magical tutelege being with Crowley years prior to his admission to the G.D. The Hermes Lodge, founded by Dr. R W. Felkin as an ofkhoot of his Arnoun Temple of the Stella Matutina was a third generation G.D. temple which likely never inherited much of the oral materials and private papers of the original Mathers-Farr-Yeats Golden Dam Mathers continued to expand the original G.D. into the Second Order. At the time, Felkin didn't wholeheartedly embrace this newer growth of Mathers even after their reapproadunent and reconciliation. Brodie-Innes and Bemdge were in closer contact.

H.S. 624"},{"pageNumber":642,"pageContent":"The Enochian System 625 Therefore, because it is a synthetic amalgamation of all the Order Work, the student will find it necessary and imperative to have made himself thoroughly familiar with all the other items of knowledge taught by the Golden Dawn. He must know his Tarot and Geomantic attributions so well that the names, symbols and ideas are all at his finger tips - this, naturally, in addition to the basic knowledge items of the Hebrew Alphabet, Tree of Life, and the Qabalah generally. The formulae of practical Magic derived from the Z documents, dealing with the symbolism of the Candidate, the Temple, and the Ceremony of the Neophyte Grade, will require to be not only memorised and known, but understood. The student will need to be perfectly acquaint- ed with the Pentagram and Hexagram Rituals, the formulae of the Consecra- tion Ceremonies, the general art of invocation, and formulating Telesmatic images, and drawing Sigils. The Tablets are excellent instances of Talismans and Flashing Tablets. D. D. C. F. says in his Notanda to the Book of the Concourse of the Forces, that \"the tablets of Enoch require in truth many years of study, and will repay such an expenditure of time and energy. The knowledge embodied in this manuscript is very superficial and elementary, and entirely fails to do justice to the Enochian scheme. You must take it as only a feeble attempt to <262> provide what is seen at first glance, by the intellect, and as having no relation to the world of Spiritual truth which the Tablets enshrine and which a high Adept can make them give out.\" Very little is known about the origin of these Tablets and the invocations that accompany their use. Practically nothing was said in the Order which explained this matter, though in the Adepus Minor Ritual it is said that Chris- tian Rosenkreutz and his immediate colleagues, whose supposed date is circa 1400 A.D., transcribed some \"of the magical language, which is that of the Elemental Tablets.\" So far as we are able to make out, however, the System originated by means of the ceremonial skrying of Dr. John Dee and Sir Edward Kelly towards the close of the 16th century. The original diaries of Dr. John Dee, recording the development of the system, may be found in Sloane Manuscripts 3189-3191 in the British Museum. But this stands out very clearly, that in these diaries is a rudimentary scheme which bears only the most distant relation to the extraordinarily developed system in use by the Order. Whoever was responsible for the Order scheme of the Angelic Tablets - whether it was Mathers and Westcott or the German Rosicrucian Adepts from whom the former are supposed to have obtained their knowl- edge - was possessed of an ingenuity and an understanding of Magic such as never was in the possession either of Dee or Kelly.* \"This paragraph is repeatedly quoted without due credit. (Unfortunately, it is also mis-informa- tion, and no credit to the late Israel Regardie.) First, the original system of Dee and Kelly was vastly more sophisticated than even the Golden Dawn version, but it had not been pulled together at that time, so Regardie had insufficient materials at hand to form his judgement. Second, the Golden Dawn reduces all occult symbology to an \"Elemental-Bias\", and then com- bines elemental attributions quite mechanically to constitute everything into what they took of the Dee System. This is valid and powerful! H.S."},{"pageNumber":643,"pageContent":"626 The Golden Dawn: Volume ZV Book Nine Some of the Order clairvoyants have claimed that Dee and Kelly in some way obtained access to the construction of the Enochian system whilst they were in Central Europe. It is claimed that numerous Rosicrucian centres exist- ed in Germany, Austria, and Bohemia, and both Dee and Kelly were received therein. Whilst this may be a plausible theory, there is not the least vestige of objective evidence for this assumption. Still others have believed that it rep- resents a revival of certain species of Atlantean Magic, though those <263> who press this theory do not explain the Dee diaries, not his account of the method he and Edward Kelly employed to acquire the roots of this system. Roughly, the facts which are concerned with the origins of the system are these. Over one hundred large squares filled with letters were obtained by Dee and Kelly in a manner which we cannot quite determine. When work- ing, Dee, for example, would have before him on a writing table one or more of these Tables, as a rule 49\" x 49\", some full while others were lettered only on alternate squares. Then Sir Edward Kelly would sit down at what they called the Holy Table on which were various magical pentacles, and which also rested on wax seals. On this Table was a large Crystal or Shewstone, in which, after a while, he reported to see an Angel who would point with a wand to letters on certain charts in succession. Kelly would thereupon report to Dee that the Angel pointed, for example, to column 4, rank 29, of one of the many charts, and so on, apparently not mentioning the letter, which Dee would then find on the table before him and write it down. When the Angel had finished his instruction, the message - when it concerned certain of the major invocations or Calls - was rewritten backwards. It had been dictated the wrong way round by the Angel since it was considered too dangerous to communicate in a straightforward manner, each word being so powerful a conjuration that its direct pronunciation or dictation would have evoked powers and forces not desired at that moment. Regardless of their origin, these Tablets and the whole Enochian system do represent realities of the inner planes. Their value is undoubted, as only a little study and application prove. Whilst it may seem, at first sight, that their governance is solely in the world of the elementals, that is the Astral plane, there is much to indicate that they extend to planes which are spiritual and divine in nature. In any event the magical conception of the Elements is rather different from that which obtains in most so-called occult philoso- phies. <264> Perhaps a word or two of caution might be added. Undoubt- edly prudence is required in this matter. It is a very powerful sys- tem, and if used carelessly and indiscriminately will bring about disaster and spiritual disintegration. The warnings given in connection with the Invo- cations are not to be regarded as conventions or as platitudinous moralisings. They represent a knowledge of true facts, and the student will do well to take cognisance thereof. Let him study the theory first of all, so that he has a thorough knowledge of the construction of the squares and pyramids. This must be so ingrained within his mind, that a glance at the Tablets will automatically start an associative current which will bring up without delay the attributions of any given letter or square which strikes the eye. Only"},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"The Enochian System 62 7 when this has been accomplished, dare he venture to the actual use of the Pyramids with the God-forms, or to the employment of the Invocations in ceremonial. At this juncture, also, let me record one or two facts about the Angelic language in which the invocations are couched. The Outer Order rituals state, when the Tablets are pointed out in the Temple to the Candidate, that they are written \"in what our tradition calls the Angelic Secret Language.\" The Tablets in use in the Temples, as well as those reproduced herein, are let- tered in English. These, however, are a translation or, more accurately, a trans- literation of characters belonging to the Enochian Alphabet. These letters will be found reproduced on a later page. It is said that these Letters are not simple in character, but partake of the nature of Sigils. In the section on Talis- mans, it will have been noticed that certain Geomantic emblems and As- trological symbols are referred to these letters. This Angelic Secret Language, whatever its origin, is a true language. It has, quite clearly, a syntax and grammar of its own, and the invocations in that language are not mere strings of words, but sentences which can be trans- lated, not simply transliterated into English. For instance, the Invo- <265> cation of the three Archangels ruling over the Spirit Tablet, em- ployed in the opening of the Portal Grade reads: \"01 Sonuf Vaorsagi Goho Iada Balata. Lexarph, Comanan, Tabitom. Zodakara, eka; zodakare od zodamran. Odo kikle qaa, piape piaomoel od vaoan.\"This, translated, means \"I will reign over you, saith the God of Justice. Lexarph, Comanan, Tabitom, move, therefore. Show yourselves forth and appear. Declare unto us the mysteries of your creation, the balance of righteousness and truth.\" In a First Order side-lecture issued to newly-initiated Zelatores by G. H. Fratre Sub Spe, there is this note on the Enochian system and language which might be worth reproducing: \"One more point is shown you in this first part of the 1 = 10 Grade, and that is the Great Terrestrial Watch-Tower or Tablet of the North. At present it will probably be to all of you who are here present, with the exception of those who have passed into the Second Order, an absolute sea of mystery. It appears a curious arrangement of squares and letters in different colours, and perhaps you may wonder to see English and not Hebrew letters upon it, seeing that it is one of the most ancient symbols in the world. I may tell you, ,without betraying any knowledge which is beyond you, that these letters are transliterated for convenience. I do not think there is any one present, except myself, who could read the original language in which they are written. But I may tell you that it is a great curiosity merely from the linguistic point of view, because that language and those characters in which it is written, are a perfect language which can be translated, and yet there is no record, so far as I am aware that that language was ever spoken, or those characters were ever used by mortal man. Now that Muller and other great philologists have said that it is impossible that any human being should invent a lan- guage, here is a language which has existed for as far back as we are <266> able to trace. We find traces of it on rock-cut pillars and on temples, apparently as old as the world. We find traces of it in the sacred mys- teries of some of the oldest religions in the world, but we find no trace of it"},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"The Golden Dawn: Volume lV Book Nine ever having been used as a living language, and we hold the tradition that it is the Angelic secret language. Only one instance of this I may perhaps be allowed to give. The high priest of Jupiter in the earliest days of Rome was called Flamen Dialis, and you will find that the most learned are utterly ignorant as to whence came the word Dialis. They will tell you that it is ancient Etruscan, but beyond that they can tell you nothing. It is not the geni- tive of any known nominative. On that Tablet (Earth) you will see that the second of the Three Holy Secret Names of God is Dial.\" Although no philologist, and without the least scientific knowledge of comparative languages, yet I have found the study of this Angelical or Enochian language an absorbing interest. Going through the invocations with the intention of compiling a dictionary of the extant words has con- vinced me personally that we have here fragmentary pieces of a very ancient tongue - a language which is far older even than the Sanskrit. It must have been a living tongue at one time, though many thousands of years ago, and it may therefore be claimed for Enochian that the fragments we do have are in the oldest language of which we have any knowledge. In short, though as pure speculation, it is believed that the language in which these invocations are written are remnants of the tongue of the age-old Atlanteans. True, there are no means for the time being of proving this speculation, or of bringing forward the least convincing item of corroboration other than that it is an instinctive or intuitive conviction. In the quotation rendered above, Fratre Sub Spe does give one example of an Enochian word appearing in antiquity, and this to some may prove suggestive. If only we knew it, there probably are hordes of words similar to the case quoted, and these may come to light when expert attention is given to the subject. <267> Since writing the above, another instance of an Enochian word has come to my attention. Reading Charles Johnson's translation of, and Theosophical commentary upon, the great Upanishads of India, I find reference to a certain character of legend, Uma Haimavati. The Kena Upanishad speaks of her as the daughter of the Snowy Mountain, and she is, interprets Mr. Johnson, a symbol of the hidden Wisdom personified as the child of the Himalaya who reveals the Eternal. And Charles Johnson then proceeds, \"Curiously, while the inner significance of the name of this woman greatly radiant is lost in Sanskrit, it must have been clear in the older tongue which lies behind Sanskrit; for it remains in the group of younger Aryan tongues called Slavonic. Here, the root Urn is the common word for intelligence.\" The italics marked in Johnson's commentary are mine. This point must strongly be indicated, for the significance of that word Urn is retained, not alone in the Slavonic as shown by Mr. Johnson, but also in the Enochian or Angelical language. For example, in the Second Enochian Key, used to invoke the Angels of the Spirit Tablet, and in the Sixteenth Key we find the word \"OM translated by \"Understand.\" (Let me remark here too, that the translation of the words in the Enochian invocations came from the same occult or angelic source as the invocations themselves, and were not made by either Dee or Kelly.) Again, in the Fifteenth Key, we find the English version of the Call \"0 thou.. . who knowest\" as equivalent to \"11s.. . ds omax. \" While in the Call of the Thirty Aethers, \"Oma\" is rendered as \"understanding.\""},{"pageNumber":646,"pageContent":"The Enochian System 629 Thus there is every indication to believe that if there was a language \"which lies behind Sanskrit'' as supposed by Mr. Charles Johnson and of course by many others, which according to the philosophy of the Ancient Wisdom is that of Atlantis, then the Enochian or Angelical language bears several strong points of resemblance to it. <268> Yet, the puzzle is this. Prior to the previously described cere- monial skrying of Dr. Dee and Sir Edward Kelly towards the close of the 16th century there is absolutely no trace of any part of the Enochian magi- cal system or Angelical language in Europe. There are innumerable ancient and mediaeval records of so-called \"barbarous names of evocation,\" many of them being assembled apparently in sentences and runes, etc. But none of these latter have the coherence which the Enochian language does have, nor do they betray traces of grammar and syntax which are clearly indicated in the Angelical Keys. In some incomprehensible manner, this pair of psychics must have stumbled on a thread which unfolded, perhaps from their own subconscious memory of former lives, parts of this strange tongue of a by- gone age. Stumbled, I use advisedly, for a close perusal of their diaries both published and unpublished reveals nothing to indicate that Dee or Kelly had anydung but the remotest idea of what it was that they were recording so care- fully. The way they have recorded the invocations, as shown in Sloane mss 3191 in the British Museum, indicates they had never studied its intricacies or grammar, and thus many words became jumbled and joined together. Only a little study of the Calls is necessary to reveal their mistakes, and to re- store what is clearly the original arrangement of words. For instance, the word \"L\" or \"EL,\" meaning \"The first\" or \"One\" is invariably joined on to the succeeding word in the Dee version; there is no necessity for this. It is clear that the Angelical language was not in the possession of a possessive case, and thus we find several instances of the English translation, where the possessive case is used, not tallying exactlywith the Enochian. We find 'Zonshi Tox\" translated by \"His Power\" when strictly it ought to be, if the words are literally to be translated \"The power of him.\" and 'Elzap Tilb\" is rendered \"Her course\" instead of \"The course of her.\" I mention this simply to show that the language is a real one, and not a mere jumble of <269> unmeaning words to which an arbitrary translation was given. With the publication of the invocations here, I hope that serious ex- perienced philologists will devote some attention to this matter so that we can thrash out once and for all, on the objective plane, the true nature of the language and the vertical source of its origins. It is said in the @ = Ritual that some of the early ~ratres of the Order compiled a dictionary of this language. At any rate, such is not in existence now, though the writer, using the Angelical Calls, has compiled a dictionary of the extant Enochian words. Unfortunately, it is not possible to include this dictionary with the present account of Order Teaching. Incidentally, for practical purposes, the language is pronounced by tak- ing each letter separately, whenever a lack of vowels renders it necessary. But, with a little practice, the pronounciation will come instinctively when"},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":"630 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Nine the student wants it. \"Z\" is always pronounced \"Zod\" with a long \"0.~1 My last word is an insistence upon the necessity for a thorough grasp of the preliminary part. It should be read again and again, so that the student actually absorbs the material, rather than learns it by a feat of memory or con- scious intellection. It may take some months this way, but once it has made it a part of his mode of thinking, so that it has been assimilated into the very structure of his brain, the real significance and meaning of the system will begin to dawn on him. I. Regardie <274> THE BOOK OF THE CONCOURSE OF THE FORCES PART ONE The Enochian Tablets are four in number, each referred to one of the elements of Earth, Air, Fire and Water. In addition to these four there is another smaller Tablet, which is called The Tablet of Union, referred to the element of Ether or Spirit. Its function, as its name implies, is to unite and bind together the four elemental Tablets. For purposes of study the four Elemental Tablets or Watch-Towers are arranged as are the elements in the Pentagram, although the order is rather different9 1. 2. Air Tablet Water Tablet 3. 4. Earth Tablet Fire Tablet To each Tablet are referred innumerable attributions, which will be dealt with in the course of this paper, the principal elementary ones being those of colour. Certain squares on each Tablet were painted in the colour of the Ele- ment, according to the King Scale, whilst others were left wholly or partly white. Thus in each Tablet there are four principal types of square. There are those oE 1. The Great Cross of 36 squares, lettered in black on white, stretching through the entire Tablet. 2. The Sephirotic Calvary Crosses, lettered also in black on white, in the four comers on the Tablets. 3. The Kerubic Squares, which are always in the elemental colour of the Tablet, and are the four squares immediately above each Sephirotic Cross. <275> 4. The Servient Squares, always in the colour of the Tablet, and con- sist of the 16 squares of each lesser angle beneath each Seph- irotic Cross. lUnfortunately, Israel Regardie overlooked Spirits and Apparations, Dee's published journals where pronunaation keys are given.

NANTA, attributed to Earth, is painted in black letters. 3rd line. <276> BITOM, attributed to Fire, is painted in red letters. 4th line. Each of these twenty squares is attributed in part to Spirit, and its let- ters are used in combination with those on the Elemental Tablets in the for- mation of certain Names. The most important item on each Angelic Tablet is the Great Cross whose shaft descends from the top to bottom and whose bar crosses the Tablet in the centre. This Cross comprises 36 squares, and has a double verti- cal line which is called Linea Dei Patris Filiique, the Line of God, the Father and the Son, and Linea Spiritus Sancti, the Line of the Holy Spirit, crossing this horizontally, and containing one rank of letters. The Linea Spirifus Sancti is always the seventh line or rank of letters from the top, while the two vertical columns of the Linea Dei Patris Filiique are always the sixth and seventh columns counting from either right or left. From this Great Cross, various Angelic and Divine Names are pro- duced, which are of supreme importance. First of all there are the \"Three Great Secret Holy Names of God\" which are found in the Linea Spiritus Sand. This line comprises twelve letters, which are divided into names of three, four, and five letters reading from left to right.

Thus in the Air Tablet, the Great King is BATAIVAH. It is pro- duced: And so for the other three Angelic Tablets.

Each is a name of seven let- ters. In the case of the Air Tablet, the Six Seniors are: HABIORO AAOXAIF HTMORDA AHAOZPI AVTOTAR (Note the overlapping of letters in the central squares).

They are attributed to the Sun and Planets, and are on a different and higher plane than are the elemental names. The attribution to the points of the Hexagram is: The King is attributed to the Sun, and the six Solar Hexagrams invoke him. The Senior formed on the left hand of the Linea Spiritus Sancti is attributed to Mars; that on the right hand to Venus. The Name of the Senior formed by the letters in the upper half of the Linea Dei Patris (which is the left descending column of the Cross, as the right column is the Linea Dei Filiique) is attributed to Jupiter, and the lower half to Mercury. The Senior formed by the letters on the upper half of the Linea Dei Filiique is referred to Luna, whilst the Name formed by the letters in the lower half is referred to Saturn. These rules apply to each of the Four Tablets and are constant and invariable throughout. These three sets of names - the Holy Names of God, the Name of the King, and the Names of the Six Seniors, are all taken from the Great Central Cross. Their Names are always painted in black letters on a white ground. We must now refer to the lesser Angles of each Tablet. The order given to the arrangement of the Four Tablets also applies to the structure of each individual Tablet, for each is shown together with its appropriate sub- elements. The Great Cross is the mechanism which divides the Tablet and separates (and binds together) the four sub-elements or Lesser Angles, as they are called, from the other. In the centre of each Lesser Angle will be seen a Cross of Ten squares. This is called the Sephirotic Calvary Cross. From the letters arranged on this Cross are taken two divine names which call forth and control the angels and spirits of the Lesser Angle, and their names are used in a preliminary invoca- tion when working magically with a square of a lesser angle. From (279, the verticalY~ne of the Sephirotic Cross, reading from above down- wards, comes a Deity Name of six letters. Thus, in the Air Lesser Angle of the Air Tablet, we find, in the white descending line of the Cross, the name IDOIGO. It is with this name that the Angels and Spirits of the Lesser Angle are to be called. From the cross-bar, rea&~ng from left to right, comes the deity name of five letters, ARDZA, which is used to command those Angels called by the first name. Thus in every Sephirotic Cross in every Lesser Angle, we obtain two divine names. One on the descending shaft, always of six letters, and one on the cross-bar, reading from left to right, of five letters. These names must be read in these prescribed directions, for if they are reversed, they call forth evil forces. Like the Names from the Great Cross, these Names on the Sephirotic Cross are painted in black letters on white. But unlike the former, these latter are employed with the Penta- gram. We now come to the coloured squares grouped above and below the Sephirotic Cross in each of the Lesser Angles. The most important of these . are the four above the cross-bar of the Sephirotic Cross - called the Kerubic Squares. From these four squares are derived four names of four letters each. Thus, for the top rank of the Airy Angle of the Air Tablet, we have: R Z (I) L A"},{"pageNumber":655,"pageContent":"638 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Nine Note that the white square in the centre, belongs to the Sephirotic Cross and is not included in the names derived from the Kerubic Squares. From these four letters we obtain four names, thus: RZLA. ZLAR. LARZ. ARZL. These Four Names, the Names of the Four Kerubic Angels of the Lesser Angle, rule the servient squares below the Sephirotic Cross, and of the four, the first is the most powerful as the others are derived therefrom. By prefix- ing to these four names a letter from the appropriate line of the Tablet of Union, we obtain even more powerful names, archangelic in char- <280> acter. Thus for the Kerubic Rank of the Air Lesser Angle of the Air Tablet, which we are using as our example, the letter \"E1'of the word \"EXARP\" on the Tablet of Union is prefixed. This produces ERZLA. EZLAR. ELARZ. EARZL The rule is that thefirst ktfer of the appropriate line of the Tablet of Union is prefixed only to the Names formed from the Kerubic Squares. In the Airy Angle of the Water Tablet, the principle Kerubic Name is TAAD. The name formed by the addition of the appropriate letter from the Tablet of Union is HTAAD: and so on. As an example of this method applied to the remaining servient squares of the Air Angle of the Air Tablet, we find: X is added to the 16 servient squares of the angle of AIR. A is added to the 16 servient squares of the angle of WATER. R is added to the 16 servient squares of the angle of EARTH. P is added to the 16 servient squares of the angle of FIRE. Hence EXARP will be used entirely on the Air Tablet, and is never used on the other three Tablets. The First letter applies to the Kerubic Squares of each of the four Lesser Angles, whilst the remaining four letters apply to the sixteen servient squares of those Angles as shown above. The other names of the Tablet of Union are attributed similarly to Water, Earth, and Fire. As an example, I give below Names formed from the Lesser Angle of Fire in the Water Tablet: HNLRX HLRXN HRXNL HXNLR. AXPCN APCNX ACNXP ANXPC. AVASA AASAV ASAVA AAVAS. ADAPI AAPID APIDA AIDAP.

The Sephirotic Cross therefore represents the Sephiroth modified by the letter of the lesser angle. Thus Kether in the Airy Lesser Angle is the Kether of Vau. In the Watery Lesser Angle, it is the Kether of Heh, and so on. The letters, in this case, as elsewhere explained, refer to the four Worlds. Referring to the other squares of the lesser angles, in the Kerubic Rank the outside square is always attributed to the letter corresponding to the Ele- ment of the Lesser Angle. In the Tablets of Air and Water, the Name reads right to left in the two upper quarters; in the two lower quarters it reads from left to right. In the Tablets of Earth and Fire, left to right in the upper, <284> but in the two lower quarters form right to left. Thus in the Four Tablets, the Name reads: FIRE EwmFl Though the last two groups of the name are the same, this does not indi- cate that the squares are identical. Their elemental composition differs enor- mously in each lesser angle, as a little later will be seen. The Servient Squares beneath the Calvary Cross may be considered as of four vertical columns of four squares each, or, looking at it from a different angle, of four horizontal ranks also of four squares each. In attributing the let- ters of Tetragrarnmaton to these Servient Squares, the rule is that they follow the attributions of the Kerubic Squares. The columns (that is reading from above downwards) follow the order of the Kerubic Squares above, and this order is invariably followed downwards for the ranks, reading from right to left. Thus in the Air Lesser Angle of the Air Tablet, the Kerubic Rank has attribution to the Name: VAU HEH YOD HEH (Final) Therefore applying the above rule, the Servient squares beneath the Seph- irotic Cross follow: VAU HEH YOD HEH (Final) (Final) HEH * * * * YOD * * * * HEH * * * * VAU * * * *"},{"pageNumber":659,"pageContent":"642 The Golden Dawn: Volume IV Book Nine From this example, it will be clearly indicated that each square has a double attribution to the letters of Tetragrammaton, none being the same since a column and a rank differ. Thus, Column VAU rank YOD does not <285> coincide in nature with Column YOD rank VAU. We must now approach the reason for this complex series of references of the letters of the Tetragrammaton to the squares. According to these attributions, so are certain Astrological, Tarot, Geomantic and Hebrew symbols referred to the Squares. It will be remembered that in attributing the letters of the Name to the Great Cross, we subdivided the latter into groups or blocks of three squares each. Every block was attributed to some one letter of Tetragrammaton. Now the Signs of the Zodiac are to be attributed to the Great Cross, and each of those twelve Signs is to be referred to three squares constituting one group or block. The order of their attribution is governed by the letters of the Great Name already referred to the arms of the Great Cross. For instance, Fiery Signs (Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius) are attributed to YOD. Watery Signs (Can- cer, Scorpio, and Pisces) are attributed to HEH. Airy Signs (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) are attributed to VAU. Earthy Signs (Taurus, Virgo, and Cap- ricorn) are attributed to HEH final. Thus each group of three squares, constituting a single unit, is attributed to one sign of the Zodiac, depending upon the letter of the Name referred to that group. Each Zodiacal Sign, being divisible into three Decanates, or divisions of ten degrees, it follows that each of three Decanates of the Sign may be referred to one of the squares in any group of three squares. The Sign refers to the group, the Decan refers to one square of that group. The rule governing the attributions of the Twelve Signs to the Great Cross is: the Four Kerubic or Fixed Signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquar- ius) are referred to the squares of the Linea Spiritus Sandi. The Four Car- dinal Signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn) are referred to the left side of the Linea Dei Patris Filiique, and the Four Mutable Signs (Gemini, <286> Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces) to the right side of the Linea Dei Patris Filiique. The decanate system as employed by.the Order will be found in the part of this book dealing with the significance of the Tarot Cards. They begin with the attribution of the first decanate of Aries to the planet Mars, and ending with the last decanate of Pisces also ruled by Mars. The order of planets for the decanates follows the order of Sephiroth on the Tree of Life: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, and Luna. There are 36 small cards of the Tarot, as explained in the appropriate documents, attributed to the decanates of the Twelve Signs. Therefore to each of the decanate squares on the Great Cross will be attributed one of the small cards of the Tarot. 2,3, and 4, of each of the four Suits of Tarot are referred to Cardinal Signs. 5,6,7 to the Kerubic or Fixed Signs; and 8,9, and 10 to the Mutable Signs.

The attribution of the Sephiroth to the ten squares of the Sephirotic Cross is shown on the Admission Badge to the 27th Path of Peh, and reproduced in one of the Knowledge Lectures. The planetary attributions to the Sephirotic Cross as used in the Enochian system are rather different from those used on the Tree of Life. But the system that is here employed is constant, and applies to each of the sixteen Sephirotic Crosses on the four Tablets. In this mode of attributing the planets to the Sephiroth on the Calvary Cross of the Lesser Angles, Saturn is excluded, and Jupiter and the Tarot Trump, the Wheel of Fortune is attributed to Kether. The title of this card is \"The Lord of the Forces of Life,\" and Kether is the origin and source of Life. To Chokmah is attributed Mercury, the Tarot Key, The Ma- <288> gician, \"The Magus of Power\" seeing that Chokmah is the dis- tributor of the power from Kether, even as Mercury is the mes- senger of Jupiter of classical mythology. To Binah is referred the Moon, and the Tarot Key, 'The Priestess of the Silver Star,\" even as Binah is the completer of the Triad of the Supemals, and as it were High Priestess to the Inferior Sephiroth. (Compare also, says S.R.M.D., the position of the Path of Gimel in the Tree of Life.) To Chesed, Venus, and the Key of The Empress, \"The Daughter of the Mighty Ones.\" Chesed is, as it were, the first of the Inferiors below Binah, and the Path of Venus is thus reciprocal between Chokmah and Binah, forming, as it were, the base of the Triangle of the Supernals.

The remaining four squares of the Sephirotic Cross have no planetary or astrological attributions. The ten squares of the Sephirotic Cross also stand for the Ace and small cards of the Suit represented by the Element of the Lesser Angle. Thus Wands are attributed to the Fire Angle, Pentacles to the Earth Angle, etc. The Kerubic Squares are allotted, as their name implies, to the four Kerubirn whose emblems follow the order of the letters of Tetragram- maton: YOD HEH Lion-Leo Eagle-Scorpio King Queen VAU HEH (final) Man- Aquarius Bull-Taurus Prince Princess These last are of the suit corresponding to the Element of the Lesser <289> Angle as explained above, viz: Wands to Fire and Yod; Cups to Water and Heh; Swords to Air and Vau; Pentacles to Earth and Heh final. It was previously shown how the squares of the Servient part of each lesser angle were given a double attribution to the letters of the Name. They were seen to be ruled by a letter governing the rank, and also by a letter governing the column. In order to work out the astrological attributions of this allocation, note that the columns go by the triplicity of the Kerubic Square at the top, the ranks by quality. By this method there results a highly intricate and ingenious subdivision of elements in the sub-elements of the Lesser Angles. YOD and Fire are referred to the Cardinal Signs, T' % 6 M. HEH and Water are referred to the Kerubic or Fixed Signs, 'd Q lll, -. VAU and Air are referred to the Mutable Signs, # rrg % X. HEH final and Earth are referred to the Elements, A VA 8 . As to the reasons of this latter attribution, S.R.M.D. says that the Four Cardinal Signs are called the most fiery because most solar in nature. That is, the Equinoxes and Solstices occur when the Sun is in these signs. The Kerubic or Fixed Signs are considered watery because they are the most shining and glittering in nature. The remaining four Mutable signs are called the most Airy because they are the most subtle in nature. While the four elements are the most Earthy because their operation is mainly terrestrial. Incidentally, instead of the usual Earth symbol, the planet Saturn is used in the Enochian system, because, to quote S.R.M.D. \"though one of the seven Lords who wander (planets), Saturn is yet here classed with those <290> who abide because he is the heaviest of the seven and thus formeth a link between the Wanderers and Abiders.\""},{"pageNumber":662,"pageContent":"The Enochian System 645 The following diagram shows how any Lesser Angle may be worked out ng the above rules: Wed OMS am Blue EARTH ANGLE OF WATER TABLET One final set of attributions concerns the Tablet of Union, which is referred to Spirit.

It is im- perative to understand thoroughly the basic principles of attributions before beginning the analysis of the Pyramids based on each square. What follows will have little meaning if the reader has not worked out these references and attributions for himself. The following diagram shows the Letters of Tetragrammaton attributed to the Four Enochian Tablets in detail. The figures refer to the order of read- ing the Hebrew letters, but must under no circumstances be confused with the order of the Angelic names on the Tablets, which always read from left to right. In the 4= 7 Grade the admission badge for the 28th Path was a Pyramid. It was described as having a square base, and four sides composed of equilateral triangles cut off so as to leave a flat top. These four sides were attributed to the four Elements, and the flat to was conceived to be the throne of Eth, the Spirit. Hitherto, the Squares o I' the Enochian Tablets have been treated as a single whole, and as being flat. In reality, however, they are represented as being pyramids like that described above. The practical magi- cal significance of this will be shown hereafter, but for the moment we must consider the method of producing the sides of these Pyramids, and their attributions. With the exception of the Tetragrammaton letter, upon which everything else depends, all the other attributions appear and are included in the definition of the nature of the Pyramid. Each side of the Pyramid is coloured according to its own appropriate element, or left white for Spirit. It by no means follows for example that a square from the Airy Angle of Air will build up a completely yellow pyramid.

The following will be the standard of reference, so that later should mention be made of Triangle No. 2, the following diagram will show its position. The Pyramid is supposed to be in position on the Tablet, so that Triangle No. 2 points to the top of the Tablet. To work out the pyramid of any square completely, it is necessary to know the attributions of the Four Triangles and the element of each. Since every Tablet comprises four distinct divisions, each of these must be considered separately as each produces a different type of pyramid. The rules for analysing the pyramid based on the squares will be concisely put thus:"},{"pageNumber":665,"pageContent":"648 The Golden Dawn: Volume IV Book Nine Great Cross. Triangle No. 1.

Triangle No. 4 is coloured according to the element of the <294> Tablet; thus Red for Fire Tablet, Blue for Water, Black for Earth, Yellow for Air. Triangle No. 1 is to be coloured according to the triplicity of the Sign attributed to it, that is as to whether it is of an Earthy, Fiery, Watery, or Airy nature. Triangle No. 3 is to be coloured in that of the Element ruled by the Planet attributed to it. The rule governing the latter is: Sun and Jupiter rule the element of Fire. Saturn and Mercury rule the element of Air. Venus and Moon rule the element of Earth. Mars rules the element of Water. On the other hand there are alternative methods, the use of which calls into operation other forces than elemental. Thus the colour of No. 1 may be in the colour of the Sign itself, as Red for Aries, and Blue for Sagittarius, etc. Triangle No. 3 may also be coloured in the colour of the Planet itself, Orange for the Sun, Green for Venus, etc. If these latter are used, planetary and zodia- cal forces would be inferred in lieu of purely elemental ones. The former, however, may be found to be the most practicable for most circum- stances.

For these 4 Vertical lines resemble 4 mighty Pillars each divided into twain by a light line shewing this forth; The Father Himself, in the absence of the line. And in its presence shewing the Son. \"As aforesaid the central points of these 4 Great Crosses do shew in the Celestial Heavens, and do correspond unto the 4 Tiphareth points referred to in the Book of the Astronomic view of the Tarot. Naturally then the Linea Spiritus Sancti coincides with the Zodiacal Belt wherein is the Path of the Sun who is the administrant of The Spirit of Life, and \"The Lord of the Fire of the World.\" The Four Linea S. S. then form the complete circle of the Ecliptic, a circle at the centre of the Zodiacal circle. \"It is demonstrated in the Tarot manuscripts that when the 10 Sephiroth in their grouping which is called the Tree of Life are projected in a Sphere (Kether coinciding with the North Pole, Malkuth coinciding with the South Pole, the Pillar of Mildness with the Axis) then the Pillars of Severity and of"},{"pageNumber":673,"pageContent":"656 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Nine Mercy are quadrupled, i.e. there are five Pillars instead of three Pillars. \"The same scheme is therefore applicable to the Celestial Heavens, and the mode of the governance of these Tablets in the Heavens is also set forth in the Tarot manuscripts. But as before and as there is said, the rule of <305> these Four Tablets, Terrestrial as well as in the Heavens, is in the Spaces between the 4 Pillars. That is, between the double Pillars of Severity and Mercy. In these vast spaces at the ends of the Universe are these Tablets placed as Watch-Towers, and therein is their dominion limited on either side by the Sephirotic Pillars, and having the great central cross of each Tablet coincidingwith one of the 4 Tipharethpoints in the Celestial Heavens. Therefore even in the small squares into which each Tablet is divided, each represents a vast area of dominion, having the correlation thereof in the Universe, in the Planets, in our Earth, in the Fixed Stars, and even in Man, in animals, vegetables, and minerals. \"Therefore do the 4 Perpendicular or Vertical Lines of the 4 Crosses rep- resent 4 Great Currents of Force passing between North above and South below, intersecting the Tiphareth points and thus affirming the existence of the Hidden Central Pillar of the Tree of Life forming the Axis of the Sphere of the Celestial Heavens. \"Therefore are these Lines which are vertical called Uea Dei Patris Filiique,' as manifesting that Central Column wherein are Kether and Tiph- areth, Macroprosopus and Microprosopus. \"The Calvary Cross of 10 Squares which are in each of the 4 Lesser Angles of each Tablet are attributed unto the action of the Spirit through the 10 Sephiroth herein. This Cross of 10 Squares is the admission badge of the 27th Path leading unto the Grade of Philosophus, the only Grade of the First Order in which all the Tablets are shewn. It represents the Sephiroth in balanced disposition, before which the Formless and Void roll back. It is the form of the opened out double cube and altar of incense. Therefore it is placed to rule each of the Lesser Angles of each Tablet. \"A knowledge of these tablets will then, if complete, afford an <306> understanding of the Laws which govern the whole creation. The dominion of the Tablet of Union is above that of the 4 Terrestrial Tablets and towards the North of the Universe. \"Of the letters on the Tablets, some be written as capitals. These are the initial letters of certain Angels' names drawn forth by another method, not now explained, and the offices of these do not concern a Z.A.M. Some squares have more than one letter. In these cases, either letter characterises the Square. The higher one is preferable. The lower is weaker. If two letters are side by side, the presumption is in favour of equality. Where two letters are in one square, the best plan is to employ both. But one alone may be used with effect. \"Of the difference between these Mystical Names of the Angels of the Tablets and the Hebrew Names such as Kerub, Auriel, and Michael, etc. Those Hebrew Angel Names which have been taught unto the First Order are rather general than particular, attending especially to an office or rule whereunto such an Angel is allotted.

Each one of these Angels is a mighty Prince, a Mighty Angel of the Lord and they are of Him. They are as chief Watchmen and Overseers, set over several and respective <307> parts of the World, viz: East, West, North, South, as under the Almighty, their Governor, Protector, Defender.

The Names yielded by the analysis of the Sigils are to be considered as the Elemental Kings of the entire Tablet. There should be no confusion between the nature and function of the King whose name is derived from the whorl in the centre of the Great Cross, and the elemental King whose name is implicit in the sigil. The King of the Quarter bearing the Banners of the Names of God is planetary in nature, rep- resenting rather the operation of the divine spirit through the Element and its four sub-elements. Whereas, the King whose name is derived from the Sigrl is a powerful elemental force. His operation is essentially elemental, and his nature is elemental, and he does not represent in any way the opera- tion of the Spirit. That is not to say that hdis an evil force. On the contrary; but it is purely and intrinsically an elemental force and as such should be han- dled by invocation with great care.-I. R.) PART TWO THE CONCOURSE OF THE FORCES The Keys of the Governance and Combinations of the Squares of the Tablets. They are the Sphynx and the Pyramid of Egypt; that is, the combination of the Kerubs being the Sphynx. The combination of the Elements being the Pyramid. Now learn a mystery of the Wisdom of Egypt: 'When the Sphynx and the Pyramid are united, thou hast the formulae of the magic of Nature.\" \"These are the keys of the wisdom of all Time; and its beginning - who knoweth it? In their keeping are the sacred mysteries and the knowledge of Magic and all the Gods.\" In the Ritual of the 32nd Path leading unto the Theoricus Grade, it is thus written: '\"The Sphynx of Egypt spake and said: I am the synthesis of the Elemental Forces. I am also the symbol of Man. I am Life. I am Death. I am the Child of the Night of Time.\" The solid Pyramid of the Elements again is the Admission Badge of the 28th Path leading to the Philosophus Grade. It is attributed to the Four Elements. Therefore on its base is the word Olahm, meaning World, and upon its sides are the names of the Elements:Aesh, Ruach, Mayim, Aretz or Ophir. Yet the Apex is not allowed to remain vacant, nor quite acute in shape, but is cut off and so a small square is formed at the Apex, and the Letters Eth, meaning Essence are placed therein. This small square maketh of the pyramid a certain Throne or shrine. On this throne a certain ruling force is seated. Within the Throne is a <311> sacred symbol. Place then within each Pyramid its appropriate sphynx, and the image of its God above. Take thou each Pyramid as the key of the nature of each Tablet Square. The Sphynx of each will vary in form according to the proportion of the elements comprising the Square. The God of Egypt, whose image is to be placed above each Pyramid, shall represent the force ruling under the direction of the Great Angel of the"},{"pageNumber":677,"pageContent":"660. The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Nine Square. (That is, under the Name formed by the addition of a letter from the Tablet of Union.-I.R.). This God shall be the symbol of the power of the Light acting therein, as the Angel shall be the descent of that Light itself. The Angelic Name may be typified by the correspondences of the four Letters of the Angel's name, adding ALto the Name -the letters of the Name standing for head, bust, arms, body, and lower limbs, etc., as taught in the instruction on Telesmatic Images. Place the name in Theban or Enochian letters on the girdle. The four forms of the Sphynx are: The Bull .............................................................................. Wingless The Eagle or Hawk ............................................................ Winged Angel or Man ...................................................................... Winged Lion ...................................................................................... Wingless This variation as to wings is another reason why, in grouping the Tablets and the lesser angles of the same, the two forms of Air and Water are placed above the two Tablets of Earth and Fire. From the pyramid of the square, the symbolic form of each Sphynx is formed thus: The upmost of the four Triangles (Triangle No. 2.) sheweth the head and neck, and in the case of the Angel or Eagle, it shows whether wings are to be added to the form of the Sphynx. The two triangles right and left (Triangles No. 1 and 3) show the body with the arms or Fore-limbs here also. If Angel or Eagle there are Wings added unto the representation of the Figure. The lowest triangle (No. 4.) adds the lower limbs, and the tail of the Bull, Eagle and Lion. <312> When Air and Fire predominate there is a male tendency. When Water and Earth, the type tendeth to female. It is to be understood that what is here written regarding the Sphynx of the Pyramid and the God of Egypt ruling above is applicable especially unto the 16 squares of the Servient Angels in each lesser angle. Concerning the Skrying of the Squares Se~ent in the Spirit Vision. Have in readiness the necessary implements and insignia; also let the Zelator Adeptus Minor have before him the symbol of the Pyramid of the square. Rehearse the Angelic calls appropriate thereunto and, having invoked the appropriate names governing the Plane and division thereof in question. Let the Z.A.M. imagine unto himself that he is enclosed within that Pyramid. Or let him believe that he is voluntarily standing within an atmosphere corres- ponding unto that symbolised by the Pyramid of the Square, whether of Heat or Moisture, of Cold or Dryness, or of combinations of these. Let him then endeavour to follow the Ray therefrom unto the limits of the Macrocosmic world and to find himself in a scene corresponding unto the nature of the Pyramid Square. That is, either of landscape, or clouds, or water, or fire, or ether, vapour, or mist, or raying light, or a combination or combinations of these, according unto the nature of the Plane. For the Pyramids of the Squares are not solid pyramids of brick or stone built by the hand of man. But rather the symbolical representation of the elemental formula governing the plane of that particular sphere. Having arrived at the plane required, let the Z.A.M. invoke the God of"},{"pageNumber":678,"pageContent":"The Enochian System 661 Egypt who rulethabove the Pyramid by the power of the Angel of the Sphere - the name formed by adding the appropriate Tablet of Union letter to the Angel's name. At the same time, vibrate the Egyptian (Coptic) Name of the God or Goddess, whereby he shall perceive before him the colossal <313> symbolic form of the God or Goddess. Let him againuse the Angelic formulae, and test it by the power of symbols and signs. If it abide these tests, thus showing it is a true image, then let him request it to make manifest before him the Sphynx of its power. This shall also appear in a colossal figure and shape, and should be test- ed by the proper formula. He shall continue his invocations until he can behold it clearly, even invoking the Angel of the plane by the superior Names, and by the God of Egypt. Also let him vibrate the name of the Angel, invoking it by its own name, and by the knowledge of its symbolic (teles- matic) image, the Sphynx and by the name of the God of Egypt, and by his own particular symbolic form, according to the formula of the Square. Thus therefore in this manner only - if thou wishest to escape from delusion - shalt thou be able to discern truly, by skrying, the nature of the plane and of its operation. Standing before the Sphynx, and saluting it with the proper signs, and invoking the God of Egypt by his proper and true names, thou shalt ask by the virtue and power of those symbols and names for the knowl- edge of the operations and influences of that plane. Thou shalt ask concern- ing the special attributes of that vast portion of the confines of the universe included in that sphere, its varying nature, its elemental nature; its inhabi- tants, elemental and spiritual etc.; the operation of its rays through the Greater World, that is, the Universe; of its influence upon this particular planet, upon animals, plants, minerals, and lastly upon man the Micro- cosm. And when thou shalt have obtained all this reflect that even then it is but a small part of the knowledge of the Wisdom of the Formulae contained in the plane - even of that one square. NOTES BY FRATRE S.RM.D. For quick working, make sixteen plain triangles; 4 red, 4 blue, 4 yellow, and 4 black. Make also Kerubic Figures. A red lion, a black bull, blue eagles, <314> yellow angel. (Note: These should be made all about the same height and width, so that when they are cut, the separate pieces may be pieced together - as in a jigsaw puzzle - in different combinations, without there being too great a discrepancy in size.-I. R.). Divide each into three; the centre piece being halved by a horizontal cut. From these make composite sphynxes to lay under the pyramid. (Note: the Sphynx in this instance becomes a synthetic kerubic figure. Thus you can make a Sphynx with the head of a Lion, the shoulders and wings of an Eagle, the body of a Man, and the hind-legs and tail of a Bull, etc.-I.R.). Make small Egyptian Gods to place above the Pyramid. (Note: When drawing these God forms if a little tongue is left at the bottom of the card- board on which the form is painted, that tongue can be fitted very easily into a slot of about the same size at the top or throne of the Pyramid.-I.R.)."},{"pageNumber":679,"pageContent":"662 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Nine Make a shallow inverted Pyramid of card-board. Fill the sides as re- quired with the coloured triangles to represent the several squares. Let the Pyramid be shallow enough to show all four sides at once. These be the Gods of Egypt who rule above the Pyramids of the sixteen servient Angels and squares of each Lesser Angle. In the middle of each pyramid is the sphynx of its power. Revere then the sacred symbols of the Gods, for they are the Word manifested in the Voice of Nature. These be the Elohim of the Forces of the Eternal, and before their faces the forces of Nature are prostrate. (Note: It is perhaps hardly necessary to suggest to the student that he should not attempt to employ the Sphynx and God-form formula with the Pyramid until he has had much experience in ordinary Tattwa vision. When he has become perfectly acquainted with the nature of the subtle planes, and has learned to apply the simple forms of tests, so that he is quick to detect imposition or deception, then he may skry in the planes symbolized by the Pyramids.-I.R.) <318> In order to show something of the nature of these Enochian pyramids as revealed by skrying therein with the spirit-vision, I have thought it advisable to include here two or three examples of simple visions obtained by members of the old Order. These are provided only as instances of the procedure and results to be obtained. Under no circum- stances should the student permit his own skrylng researches to be influ- ences and moulded by these visions. He must not attempt to make his own accounts of the nature of the Pyramids accord with those given here. The technique alone should be noted, and the manner of applying tests - but nothing further than that should be used in actual practice. 1. \"A vision of the 'N' square in the Airy Lesser Angle of the Water Tablet. The full name is nhdD, and the Pyramid God is Ahephi. \"Having recited the 4th and 10th Enochian Calls, and invoked the Angelic Names of the Tablet of Water, and the Airy Angle, I was carried up by the gentle moving waves of warm moist Air, through which I could see bright blue sky with greyish white clouds moving across rapidly. I rose in the Air till I found myself on a vast sandy plain, on the right little vegetation, on the left a broad river with trees and grass on its banks. A cool breeze was blowing from the river across the plain, and seemed to refresh the green after the heat of the day. \"I called on Ahephi to appear and the form gradually filled the place till the scene disappeared altogether. Tested by the letters, it grew immensely larger, and seemed to have a yellow and blue striped Nemyss, whitish wrap- pings, with broad blue bands round it, and a greenish yellow light shown about it. I gave the L.V.X. signs and asked to be shown the Sphynx of its power. This gradually appeared through the yellow light behind the God- form, human head, very fair and bright face, wings, yellow and blue nemyss, claws of Eagle extended in front, and hind-legs and tail of a lion in re- clining position. <319> \"On asking for the action of the force of the Square, was shown a bubble of Water into which Air was continually pouring, and expanding it till it burst and disappeared, the energy seeming then to pass"},{"pageNumber":680,"pageContent":"SPIRIT: or one triangle of each element WATER: or 3 out of 4 Water HUUG)PLV) Hierophant 051 RlS on throne Praemonstrator Imperator EARTH: or 3 out of 4 Earth FIRE: or 3 out of 4 Fire ZUUP Hiereus HORU AIR: or 3 out of 4 Air Past Hieroghant Hiero. off Throne 2 WATER 2 EARTH ATiiOfL Invisible Station Azaewup Kerub of East 2 FIRE 2 WATER 50THI5 Invisible Station WHW&~ Kerub of West HARPOCmTrs Invisible Station Z~k)pTrot(pat (r) between Altar and Hegemon 2 AIR 2 WATER APIS Invisible Station Azs~~ Kerub of North 2 FIRE 2 EARTH ANLl A15 Kerux AnarBi 2 AIR 2 EARTH 2 FIRE 2 AIR ~A~HT (se hLt Invisible Station eap+ew Kerub of South FIRE WATER EARTH AMESHET Invisible Station N.E.

Asking its effect on the animal world, I was shown a Deer standing by a lake. A current of force passing over it, seemed to bring the dawn of reason and glimmering of consciousness, the first con- scious stirrings of an animal.

This again shewed me a mighty <320> Angel who answered my signs, and when in that of the Theoricus I saw that a brilliant ray descended into the outstretched palm of each of her hands. On my asking for guidance and information, she gave me one of these rays, which I beheld as a crystal cord whose other end rested in the Eternal. The Angel led me first among the Ethers, and after a space I beheld stars and worlds innumerable. \"Through the brighter Suns, particles passed - coming out the other side as blackened cinders. Then came forth a mighty hand which gathered these cinders and welded them into a mass, lifeless and vast. Then we passed to this Earth - to a frigid scene, all snow and huge blocks of ice. The cold was intense, but I felt it not. Here were polar bears, and seals, as also many sea gulls. In places, the ice was stationery but again it was violently moved, block crashing against block with deafening roar. The inhabitants of the place were small and bloodless, wrapped chiefly in the skins of polar bears. \"The influence of this square on Man, makes him violently impetuous in the absence of difficulty, but instantly hopeless in the face of an obstacle, abandoning at once every project.

That these occurred throughout the Universe but with different effect. That on our evil planet the effed was sometimes disastrous, being perverted from their original inten- tion by our evil sphere. But on other higher planes the effed was always beneficial, clearing away that which had fulfilled its purpose and replacing it by fresh influence.

Prepare for private use Four Tablets with correct lettering as given in the Official Lecture; and a Tablet of Union. 2. Make the Four Tablets coloured as brilliantly and as flashingly as poss- ible, and in exact proportion. This should be done with coloured papers. They may be done in water-colours, but this is not so good. (Enamel or Lacquer paints are best.-1.R) 3. The Four minor Implements are to be used with the Enochian Tablets. A small Altar should be arranged in the room at the time of working. It should be draped with a black cloth, with a lighted candle by the wand, incense burning by the dagger, gold and silver or bread and salt with the Pentacle, and Water in the Cup. 4. Use the Ritual of the Hexagram for the Invocation of the King and the Six Seniors. 5. Use the Ritual of the Pentagram for the Spirit and the Four Elements. 6. The Calvary Cross Names call forth with a word of Six Letters and com- mand with a word of Five. They rule the Lesser Angles in which they are situated, and should be used in the preliminary invocation. 7. The Six Seniors and Kings are on a higher plane and should be invoked with the Hexagram Ritual. The Names of the Six Seniors are each of Seven letters, that of the King Eight. 8. The Deity Names consist of a Name of Three letters, Four letters and Five letters, respectively, corresponding to the Supernal Triad, IAO. Also to the triad of YI-IVH, Yeheshuah, Yehovashah. <324> 9. The Name of the King and the Letters from the centres of the Great Central Crosses initiate the Whirl, and should not be used by those who do not understand its action. 10. Remember that the East is attributed to Air, South to Fire, West to Water, North to Earth, when you summon Spirits or Forces. When, however, you go to seek Spirits or Forces on their own planes, the attribution of the elements to the Cardinal points is as in the Zodiac, as follows: East to Fire, South to Earth, West to Air, North to Water. 11. .

At the same time divide the surface into four quarters, and imagine yourself outside the spher- oid. This is objective working. 13.

Perhaps the most convenient method for a beginner to <325> adopt is to apply this scheme to the Earth, treating the Three Deity names as the Three Signs of the Zodiac in one quarter. For example, take the Fire Tablet and place OIP on the Sign Leo, TEAA in Virgo, and PDOCE in Libra. And so on with the other God Names, treating the Kerubic Sign as the point de depart, one quarter of a house in Astrology being roughly equal to the square of each letter. Each of these spaces, under these circumstances, would appear to be governed by a heroic figure of, say, twelve feet high, not winged. But the Spirit Names and the names above the Calvary Cross, even on the Earth plane, bring forth figures of tremendous size and beauty, which could easily lift a human being in the palm of the hand. From the fiery Lesser Angle of Fire, I have seen AZODIZOD, the figure being fiery red with flaming wings and hair of emerald green. ZODAZODEE, black and white, flashing and flaming. EEZODAHZOD, blue and orange, with a mist of flame about him. ZODEEZODAH, orange, with hazy gold wings like gold gauze, and nets of gold around him. Having selected one of the above methods, let the Zelator Adeptus Minor perform the Lesser Banishing Rituals with the Sword. Invoke, with the minor implement, the Element required. Our example being the Square of OMDI, a watery and earthy square in the Lesser Angle of Earth in the Great Southern Quadrangle or Fire Tablet, we take the Fire Wand. In the four quarters we invoke, with the equilibriating Pentagram for Actives, and the Fire Pentagram, using only the Tablet Names: \"EDELPERNAA, (the Great King of the South). VOLEXDO and SIODA, (the two Deity Names on the Sephirotic Calvary Cross). I command ye in the Divine Name OIP TEAA PEDOCE and BITOM that the Angel who governs the Watery and Earthy square of OMDI shall obey my behest and submit to me when I utter the holy name OOMDI (pronounced Oh-Oh-Meh-Deh- ee) .I' <326> Having repeated this Invocation in the Four Quarters, turn to the East if you wish to go to the plane, or to the South if you wish to invoke the Spirits to come to you. Look at the painted Tablet which you have prepared until you can carry it in your mind, then close the eyes and vibrate the name OMDI and OOMDI until your whole body trembles and you almost feel a sensation of burning. (The items which follow are quite open to discussion and are simply my own personal experience.-S.A.) Then pass through the Tablets and try to"},{"pageNumber":687,"pageContent":"6 70 The Go2den Dawn: Volume IV Book Nine see some sort of landscape. My experience of this particular plane was a dull red crumbling earth. I first found myself ina Cave. Asa symbol I was told that this Square of OMDI was like the roots of a tiger lily; the Square MDIO to the right, representing the Life working in it. The square IOMD to the left, rep- resented the sap flowing through the stalk and the leaves, as it were; the Square DIOM to the left of that, the orange flower with the black spots upon it, fitly representing Air, Fire and Earth - yellow, red and black. Afterwards I invoked the King and Six Seniors to explain the general bearings of the Quadrangle. After passing through several fiery planes, each of them of greater whiteness and brilliance than the last, I seemed to be stationed on a high tower situated in the centre of the Quadrangle between the two a's in the centre of the Great Cross, and I was told by the Six Seniors that they were partly representative of the planets, but that their Names should really be read in a circle, in a way we should be taught later, etc. Final note. From the lectures circulated among the Adepti, (S.A. here refers to certain statements made in the Clavicula Tabularum Enochi which is here omitted.-I.R.), I have gathered that the Angels placed over the Kerubic Squares of the Lesser Angles of the Great Quadrangle have the following properties: <327> Air Angle. \"Knitting together and destruction.\" Centrifugal and centripetal forces. Expansive and contractive, etc. Water Angle. \"Moving from place to place.\" Motion, vibration, changing of forms. Earth Angle. \"Mechanical crafts.\" Creative or productive of results on the material plane. Fire Angle. \"Secrets of Humanity.\" Controlling human nature, clear vision, etc. And that the Subservient Angels of these Angles, that is the Angels of the sixteen servient squares under the Sephirotic Cross, rule: Air Angle. \"Elixirs.\" Purification from illusions, diseases, sins, etc. by sublimination. Water Angle. \"Metals.\" the right methods of polarising the Soul so as to attract the LVX. Earth Angk. \"Stones.\" The fixing of the Higher Self in the purified body. Fire Angle. \"Transmutations.\" The consecration of the body and the transmutation brought about by consecration. (It is to be noted that the Lesser Angles in each Quadrangle have identi- cal properites and qualities differing only according to the primary Element of the Tablet in which they are situated. That is, the Lesser Angle of Air in the Air Quadrangle will be very similar in nature to the Lesser Angle of Air in the Water Tablet, or the Earth and Fire Tablets; and that the only difference bet- ween them will be in the nature of their particular Quadrangle. The Lesser Angle of Air is said to be concerned with \"physic\" or healing. The use of the Lesser Angle of Air in the Fire Tablet would have to be for quite different objects and purposes than for example the Air Lesser Angle of the Earth Tablet. And so for the other Lesser Angles in the primary Elements.- I.R.)"},{"pageNumber":688,"pageContent":"PART THREE THE CONCOURSE OF THE FORCES THE FORTY-EIGHT ANGELJCAL KEYS OR CALLS These Calls or Keys which follow are only to be made use of with the greatest care and solemnity; especially if they be pronounced in the Angeli- cal Language as given. Anyone profaning them by using them with an impure mind, and without a due knowledge of their attribution and applica- tion, shall be liable to bring serious spiritual and physical harm unto him- self. The first Nineteen Calls or Keys, of which 18 alone are expressed, are attributed unto, and to be used with, The Tablet of Union and the Four other Terrestrial Enochian Tablets. The first Key hath no number and cannot be expressed, seeing that it is of the God-Head. And therefore it hath the number of 0 with us, though in the Angelic Orders it is called First. Therefore, their Second Key is with us the First. Unto the Tablet of Union are attributed Six Calls, of which the First is the highest and above the other five. The remaining Twelve Calls, together with Four of those belonging unto the Tablet of Union, are allotted unto the Four Tablets of the Elements. The First Key governeth generally, that is as a whole, the Tablet of Union. It is to be used first in all invocations of the Angels of that <329> Tablet but not at all in the invocations of the Angels of the other four Tablets. The Second Key is to be used as an invocation of the Angels of the Let- ters E.H.N.B. representing the especial governance of the Spirit in the Tablet of Union. It is also to precede in the second place all invocations of the Angels of that Tablet. Like the First Key it is not to be employed in the invocations of the Angels of the four other Tablets. (The Numbers such as 456 and 6739, etc. which occur in some of the Calls contain mysteries which are not here to be explained.) The next Four Keys or Calls are used both in the Invocations of the Angels of the Tablet of Union, and in those of the Angels of the Four Terres- trial Tablets as well. Thus: The Third Key is to be used for the invocation of the Angels of the letters of the line EXARP, for those of the Air Tablet as a whole, and for the Lesser Angle of this Tablet which is that of the Element itself - Air of Air. The Fourth Key is to be used for the Invocation of the Angels of the let- ters of the line HCOMA, for those of the Water Tablet as a whole, and for the Lesser Angle of this Tablet - Water of Water. 6 71"},{"pageNumber":689,"pageContent":"6 72 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Nine The Fifth Key is to be used for the Invocation of the Angels of the letters of the line NANTA, for those of the Tablet of Earth as a whole, and for the Lesser Angle of this Tablet - Earth of Earth. The Sixth Key is to be used for the Invocation of the Angels of the letters of the line BITOM, for those of the Tablet of Fire as a whole, and for the Lesser Angle of this Tablet - Fire of Fire. This finishes the employment of the Keys of the Tablet of Union. The remaining Twelve Keys refer to the remaining Lesser Angles of the Four Terrestrial Tablets, as hereafter set forth in the following Table.

So that, to invoke, for example, the Angels of the line NANTA of the Tablet of Union, thou shalt first read the First and Second Keys, and then the Fifth Key, and then employ the necessary Names. And to invoke the Angels of the Lesser Angle IDOIGO, Air Angle of the Tablet of Air, thou shalt read the Third Key only, and then employ the necessary Names. But to invoke the Angels of the Lesser Angle VADALI, Water Angle of the Tablet of FIRE, thou shalt first read the Sixth Key, and then the 17th Key, and after that use the necessary Names. Whereas, for the Angle of FIRE OF FIRE therein, the Sixth Key alone would suffice, as also for the King and Angelical Seniors of that Tablet. And so of the other Angles of the other Tablets, these rules shall &ce. Now, though these CALLS are thus to be employed to aid thee in the Skrylng of the Tablets in the Spirit Vision, and in magical working therewith, yet shalt thou know that they be allotted unto a much higher plane <332> than the operation of the Tablets in the Assiatic World. And, there- fore, are they thus employed in bringing the Higher Light and the All-Potent Forces into action herein; and so also, are they not to be profaned, or used lightly with an impure or frivolous mind as before said. Also these CALLS may be employed in the invocation of the Chiefs of the Elementals according to the title of the Book T associated therewith. And in this case, it will be well to employ the names of the Archangels Michael, Raphael, etc., and their inferiors. And thou shalt understand that these He- brew names are more general as representing Offices; while those of the Angelic Tablets are more particular as representing Natures.

No one in the Order, or my Temple, seemed to know anything about it. Whether this same condition applies to the other Temples is hard to say, though, from conversation with certain of the Adepti of those Temples, I gather the same conditions there prevailed. Nothing that was of practical value, as throwing any light on the nature and function of the game, was thrown on the subject by any of the Order mem- bers within the sphere of my acquaintance. It is probable that the knowledge of this system died with the early members.* All that I ever heard were fulsome praises of its remarkable divinatory capacity, together with quite a few amusing comments by those who manifestly knew nothing about it, though no precise indication was conveyed as to its rocedure. On two of three occasions I have asked Adepti of the rank of d= to play a game with me using my chess pieces and boards though each politely backed out of the invitation. Also the unmounted state of the Order chess-pieces was a clear indication that they had never and could never have been employed - like other aspects of the Order teaching. And the actual documents on the subject that were shown to me were vague and obviously incomplete, giving no indication as to the true nature of this matter. No doubt it was in- <347> tended, by those who wrote the papers and devised the system, that the Adept should apply his own ingenuity to the bare-bones pro- vided of the game, and formulate from that skeleton outline, as from the Enochian Tablets themselves, a complete system of initiation, and a pro- found magical philosophy. It is not therefore my intention to say very much about Rosicrucian chess, although it can be stated that the perspicacious stu- dent will divine ideas of great import and discover a depth of magical significance hidden under the cloak of an apparently trivial game. However, the student who has mastered the foregoing sections of the Book of the Concourse of the Forces will no doubt be able to divine the relationship existing between the profundities of the Enochian Tablets and this chess-game. It will have been necessary as a preliminary step to have *Keep in mind how late Israel Regardie became involved m active Temple work.

H.S. 68 3"},{"pageNumber":701,"pageContent":"684 The Golden Dawn: Volume IV Book Seven become perfectly familiar with the attributions of the Squares, so that any pyramid can be built up instantaneously in the imagination too. By this, I mean, that while playing a chess-game, the movement of a piece from one square to another should provide much material for thought, for the squares on the boards, as on the Tablets, may be formulated as Pyramids. Some experience, also, in employing the Pyramids for skrying in the Spirit-Vision will be required before any real appreciation of Enochan chess can be acquired. In this game, the pieces are Egyptian god-forms, and the boards are cer- tain adaptations of the Enochian Tablets. The Tablet of Union, however, is not used. Tablets are reproduced as Chess-boards minus the Great Central Cross, the Sephirotic Cross, and the Kerubic Squares over the Calvary Cross in each Lesser Angle. This leaves only the Se~ent squares in each of the Four Lesser Angles - sixteen in number, which gives us sixty-four squares per board - the number of squares in the ordinary chess-board. One of the papers written by Greatly Honoured Fratre N.O.M., <348> gives a short history of Chess as it was derived from the Indian Chaturanga, the Persian Shatranju, and the Arabic Chess. But since it contains very little that is of any practical import, I have thought better not to include it. A few words now as to the nature of the Boards. The Boards consist of the purely elemental part of each Tablet. There is nothing in the symbolic structure of the Board to suggest the operation of the Spirit in any of its aspects through the Elements. This operation of the Spirit and its potencies, however, is indicated not by the squares, but by the pieces and their move- ments over the board. To be of any real magical value, the board should be a sort of Talisman or Flashing Tablet. That is, it should be fully painted, showing all the triangles of the Pyramids as brightly and as flashingly as possible. The little flat squares shown at the summit of the Pyramid, indicating the throne of the god-form, are not necessary on these boards. The triangles are completely formed, and the resulting pyramidal shape is not truncated. The four Angles of each Tablet will thus stand out quite brightly, since the elemental colour of the quarter will show its nature, even though the triangles of yellow, blue, black and red will jostle each other cheek by jowl. When fully painted, the board is most impressive as a flashing Tablet. The student may know he has done his work properly when there appear white flashings at the angles of the squares. This is important, for the object of a Flashing Tablet is to attract an appropriate type of force. And if these chess-boards are made as Flashing Tablets, they will automatically attract force and their utilisation will become the more significant. In brief, each square is, as it were, the name and sym- bolic address of a different Angelic force. The flashing squares will attract the commencement of the operation of that type of Angelic power, and the movement of the Chess God-forms over the squares may produce even brighter flashes and indicate the operation of the divine forces <349> therein. With these hints the student is left to work this out for himself. There will be, in short, four different Boards. Each is representative of"},{"pageNumber":702,"pageContent":"Enochian Chess 685 one of the Four Quadrangles or Watch-towers of the Elements, and the Angelic Names on the latter will be implied on the Boards even although no letters or Names are painted on them. The use of any of the four Boards will depend upon particular purposes, and the attributions of Elements as in the diverse schemes of Divination will determine which of the four boards must be used at any given time. In Tarot, the Element of Air, the Sword suit, indicates Sickness and Sorrow and unhappiness generally. Hence, in Eno- chian chess, for divining for some such question as touches upon trouble or unhappiness the Air Board would be employed. The Fire Board will repre- sent the Tarot suit of Wands, implying swiftness, energy, activity. The Water Board indicates the Tarot suit of Cups of pleasure, happiness, merry-making, and marriage. The Earth Board will refer to all material plane matters of money, work, employment, occupation, and so forth. The Four Boards of the Rosicrucian game, although different, neverthe- less agree in certain particulars. In each board it is convenient to speak of the arrangement of the Lesser Angles as an Upper and Lower Rank - Air and Water forming the Upper Rank, and Earth and Fire the Lower. It is evident that the columns of the one Rank are continuous with those of the other; and in this continuity a certain regular rule is observable. Every column of eight squares commencing in the Upper Rank is continued below by a column of the opposite Element. Thus the Fiery columns below invariably stand on the Watery columns; the Watery on the Fiery; the Airy on the Earthy; and the Earthy on the Airy. A different arrangement of the horizontal Files or Ranks of Squares is observable, and there is a difference in the Upper and Lower Tablets. <350> In the Upper Tablets the Kerubic Rank of squares is continuous with the Elemental bnk; and the Cardinal is continuous with the Common sign Rank, whereas in the lower Tablets of Earth and Fire the various Ranks - Kerubic, Cardinal, etc., are continuous right across the board. The pieces employed are, as previously remarked, Egyptian God-forms. A full set of chess-pieces numbers twenty men and sixteen pawns. (Note the possible relationship of the thuty-six pieces to the tm-six decanate cards of the Tarot.) The game is played by four players, representing the Four Lesser Angles of the Board, thus giving each player one set of five pieces and four pawns. The five pieces represent the operation of the Spirit and Four Elemental Rulers - the Five points of the Pentagram, the five letters of YHShVH, and the Tarot Ace and Court Cards. The pawns are their servants or vice-gerents. Strictly to be in order, each of the twenty principal pieces represents a different God-form, thus: Fire set.

King-Osiris Knight-Horns Queen-Isis Bishop-Aroueris Castle-Nephthys. However, this tends to confusion, creating in practice far too complex a game. It will be found that four sets of the same five god-forms will suffice. There are only five major god-forms, the others being variations or different aspects of those types. These are: Ositis, bearing crook, scourge, Phoenix wand. He is represented as sit- ting on a throne, silent unmoving. He is the King and represents Spirit, the operation of the Great Cross in the Tablets. He corresponds to the Ace in Tarot, the root-force of any element. Horus, a God with Hawk's head, double mitre, and standing upright, as though to stride forward. He is the Knight of Enochian Chess and represents the operation of the ten-squared Sephirotic Cross in the Fire Angle of any Tablet or Board, and corresponds to the King in the Tarot, the figure astride a horse. Isis, an enthroned Goddess with a Throne symbol mounted on the vul- ture head-dress. In Rosicrucian Chess, Isis is the Queen, and represents the operation of the Sephirotic Cross in the Water Angle of any Tablet. She cor- responds to the Tarot Queen who is shown seated on a throne. Arouetis, a human shaped God, with a double mitre. He is the Bishop in Enochian chess, and his form is that of a standing figure, to indicate his swift adion. He represents the operation of the Sephirotic Cross in the Airy Angle of any Tablet, and represents the Prince or Knight of the Tarot - the figure driving a chariot. Nephthys, a Goddess with an Altar or Crescent symbol above the vulture head-dress. She is the Castle or Rook of the Chess game. This piece is always represented as somewhat larger than the others, and is <352> enclosed within a rectangular frame, within which she is enthroned. Her office is the representation of the operation of the Sephirotic Cross in the Earth Angle of any Tablet, and represents the Princess or Knave of the Tarot - the Amazon figure who stands alone. These are the five principal forms used for each of the four angles of the"},{"pageNumber":704,"pageContent":"Enochian Chess 687 Board. Some difference should be made in the tone of the colouring of the front or face of the piece to indicate its angle on the board. Coloured bands may suffice for this purpose. Moreover the back of the piece - for it is cus- tomary to use flat pieces, not round as in ordinary chess - should be painted in the appropriate colour of the element it represents soas to avoid confusion in the recognition of its power. Thus the back of the King, as Osiris form, should be painted white to represent Spirit, and this rule applies to all four Kings in the four Angles. The Knight, Horus, should be coloured red. The Queen, Isis, should be blue; the Bishop, Aroueris, yellow, and the Castle, Nephthys, should be black and set in a large frame. Each piece should be cut about three inches high. For practical use, these pieces should be mounted on square wooden bases, and those bases painted in different colours. It will be by the bases that their place on the board may be recognised. For example, there are four sets of Chess pieces to be set out in the four comers of the board. Each piece is more or less like its corresponding piece in some one of the other corners. The pieces placed in the Air quarter of the board, therefore, will be mounted on yellow bases. Those in the Water Angle will have blue bases. The pieces in the Earth Angle will have black bases, and those in the Fire quarter will have red bases. Thus, as in the Four Angelic Tablets, there results a minute sub- division of the sub-elements of the Tablet. There will be an Osiris piece, a King with a white back, on a yellow base, indicating that he is a King belong- ing to the Air Angle. He represents the sub-element of Spirit of Air, <353> the most spiritual and subtle phase of that element, the Tarot Ace of Swords. A King with a blue base indicates his place in the Watery Angle. A Queen, an Isis figure with a blue back, set on a red base, shows that she is the Queen of the Fire Angle, representing the Watery Aspect of the Fire sub-element of any Tablet, the Queen of Wands. A Bishop, yellow backed, mounted on a black base, shows that he belongs to the Earth Angle, as against a Bishop with a yellow base whose place is in the Air Angle and who, therefore, corresponds to the Prince of Swords in the Tarot pack. And so for the rest. With but one or two slight exceptions, the pieces move exactly as do the corresponding piece sin Chess. The Queen here does not have the full liberty of the board as she does normally, nor is she the most powerful piece on the board. Here she can only move to every third square. This she can make in any direction, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally - but only three squares at any time. She can leap over intervening squares, and take pieces on the third square from wherever she stands. The other exception is that no Cast- ling is permitted. The Pawns in this Enochian Chess represent the God-forms of the four sons of Horus, the Canopic Gods. Their attributions are: Fire. Kabexnuv, mummy-shaped, hawk-headed. the Knight's pawn. Water. Tmoumathph, mummy-shaped, dog's head, Queen's pawn. Air. Ahephi, mummy-shaped, ape-headed, th.2 Bishop's pawn. Earth. Ameshet, mummy-shaped, human-headed, the Castle's pawn. The same rule for colouring the other pieces applies to the pawns. Their"},{"pageNumber":705,"pageContent":"688 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Nine backs should be painted in the colour of the piece they serve. Thus the back of the Knight's pawn will be painted the colour of the Knight, red. The base will be coloured according to the Lesser Angle in which it is placed. So that in each of the Four Angles you will have four pawns on bases in the <354> colour of its sub-element. The Airy Angle, for example, will have four pawns mounted on yellow bases. Those pawns will have four different coloured backs to indicate the piece, and therefore the element, which they represent and serve. The pawn moves only one square at a time, and not two for the first move as in modern chess. The rule of en passant does not apply here, although the regular method of taking with pawn, via the diagonal, either to right or left, holds equally well. It will be noted that the King has no pawn. Since he is Osiris, the other four pieces and their pawns are his personal servants and vice-gerents. His place on the board is always on the corner of the Lesser Angle, where the cor- responding Letters of Tetragrammaton would be placed on the Angelic Tablets. On the four comers of the board as a whole, therefore, will be found the Four Kings. Identical in every way, they yet differ in the colour of their bases, the colour of the Angle which they rule. Some variation might be made as to the posture of the God. For instance, the Fire King could be cut as a standing figure, the Water King sitting, and so forth. Let it be noted that on the corner squares, two pieces will always be found. The king and the piece cor- responding to the Letter of the Angle will occupy the same square. A piece or pawn threatening, that is giving check, to the corner square also checks the King as well as whatever other piece happens to be upon that square. In setting up the pieces for play, the rule of Tetragrammaton on the Kerubic Square of the Tablets, has application. That is, the order in which the letters of the Name YHVH are placed on the uppermost squares of the Ser- vient Squares of any Lesser Angle, as reflected from the Kerubic Squares above, also govern the placing of the pieces. The Bishop will be placed on the Vau Square, the Queen on the Heh Square, the Castle on the Heh final Square, etc. The student who has thoroughly assimilated the prin- <355> ciples involved in the attributions of the Enochian Tablets will find all this perfectly straightforward, and experience no difficulty herein. With regard to this injunction to set out the pieces on the board follow- ing the prime player's setting, whose chessmen are arranged accocding to the order of Kerubs, note that the remaining three sets of pieces are arranged, on any board, exactly in that order regardless of the order of Kerubs in their Angle. That is to say, if the prime player chooses an Earth of Water setting, his pieces will be set out: King and Castle on the corner square, then follow the Knight, Queen, and Bishop. The other three sets of Air, Water and Fire pieces on that board, are set out precisely in that order, either horizontally or ver- tically as the case may be. It thus follows that there may result sixteen possible arrangements of pieces. That is, since there are four Kerubic ranks on each board, and there being four separate boards, the chess-pieces may be arranged on the board in"},{"pageNumber":706,"pageContent":"Enochian Chess 689 sixteen different settings. The reason for any particular setting - if divina- tion is the motive for play - must depend on the prime player's synthetic grasp of the Order teaching. Let him remember that there are sixteen figures of Geomancy, each with a special and specific divinatory value. It should be remembered that these Geomantic figures are each under the influence of a Zodiacal genius and a planetary ruler. Not only so, but each is attributed to a Hebrew letter, therefore to a corresponding Tarot Trump, with its allocation to a sign and a constellation in the heavens with all the hierarchical ideas that the latter implies. Thus the playing of this game resumes the whole phi- losophy of Magic. The prime player must be guided in his selection of boards not only by choice of element as previously described, but by any one of these sixteen root sigrufications of Geomancy. For each one of these sixteen figuresmay be applied to the sixteen Lesser Angles of the Enochian Tablets and <356> chess-boards. So that each angle comes under the operation of a Geomantic ruler and genius, and under the dominion of that por- SETTING OF THE ENOCHIAN CHESS-MEN FOLLOWING THE AIR ANGLE OF THE FIRE TABLET (The mows indicate direction of play) tion of the starry heavens corresponding to its Tarot trump. The method of attributing the figures to the Angles is identical with the process described for the squares of both columns and ranks in the Lesser Angles. Thus the Airy"},{"pageNumber":707,"pageContent":"690 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Nine Lesser Angle of the Air Chess-board would be Mutable (Airy) Air, referred to the Zodiacal sign Gemini, and hence to the Geomantic figure of <357> Albus, which is a mercurial figure under the presidency of Taph- thartharath The Watery Angle of the Air Tablet would be Kerubic or Fixed (Watery) Air, which is the Sign Aquarius, and the Geomantic figure of Tristitia, attributed also to Saturn, and the ruler over it is Zazel. The Earthy Angles of the Air Tablet, is elemental Air, referred to the Geomantic figure of Fortuna Minor, also a solar or Leo figure, ruled by Sorath. The fiery Angle is Cardinal Air, the Zodiacal Sign of Libra, and Puella would be the Geomantic figure, with a Venusian nature, ruled by Kedemel. The same principle is involved in allocating the Geomantic figures to the other Tablets and angles. The magical and divinatory value of the Geo- mantic figures must therefore decide the choice of Chess-boards and Lesser Angle settings. The yellow and red men are so placed that they advance to the attack of the black and the blue respectively by the columns; while the latter advance by the ranks. That is, the Actives are shown as a vertical force, while the Passives are shown as operating horizontally, shewing the Cross of Life, cor- responding to the forces of the Court Cards and the Zodiacal Trumps in the Tarot. The central squares of the board contain the 16 signs that are allotted to each Lesser Angle. And it is only from these 16 squares that the pieces - except the Rook and the King - develop their full influence or defensive force. The Watery and Airy Boards are counterparts of each other, so far as the arrangement of the signs, etc., of the squares are concerned. And the same is true as regards the Earth and Fire Boards. Every Board has its uppermost and lowermost ranks of the passive or female element; and its two central ranks are of the active or male element. The most striking difference between the Air and Water, and the Earth and Fire Boards is in the fact that in the former the ranks are broken; whereas in the latter they are not only continuous across each board, but they <358> are continuous right across both boards when in situ. To this is due the greater balance and evenness seen in the play of the pieces in the lower boards. <359> OFFICIAL RITUAL The correct application of the action of the moveable images (representing the motion of The Ruling Angels over the Servient Squares) is called The Playe or Raying of the Chequers of the Tablets.

Wherever it goeth, it commenceth and initiateth a fresh current, whence it is represented by the motion of only one square in any direction and there staying for this purpose before moving onward. So that his action is not hurried, but represents a"},{"pageNumber":708,"pageContent":"Enochian Chess balanced movement. Yet in his beginning of action is he at first a mute force, as though throned upon the water; as in the end of his action he is a life manifested and throned upon the earth. And herein is a mystery of the Lord Aeshoori (Osiris) when enthroned between Isis and Nephthys, thus rep resenting the beginning and end of the action of Him in whom end and beginning are not, but rather concealment and then manifestation. Herein is a great mystery of life, for His Thrones are not in the two active elements, see- ing that these latter are his horse and chariot of transition in the passage from concealment into manifestation. This piece, then, is the syrnboliser of the action of the potencies of the crosses on the Servient Squares. Of the Chess Knight, the Tarot King. The move of this piece is three squares cornerwise every way (as in ordinary chess) and representeth the leaping action of the flickering flame. Wherefore also is he not stopped in his course by a piece or an intervening square, even as Fire seizing on a matter <360> speedily rendereth it transparent. This piece representeth the ac- tion of Fire as the Revealer of the Strength of the Spirit, even as Hoor is the avenger of Aeshoori. It is a force potent and terrible, the King in the elemental operations. Thus it openeth the locked doors of matter and sheweth forth the treasure hidden therein. Therefore hath all life its beginnings in a Fire Celes- tial. And the number of squares covered by the move of the Knight in the midst of the Board (reckoning from the Square on which he standeth, but not including it) is 16 squares, of which 8 are checked, and 8 are passed over. Of the Chess Queen, The Tarot Queen. The move of this piece is unto every third square from her (reckoning the square whereon she standeth as the first) as well cornerwise, as well perpendicular, as horizontal. Thus again covering 16 squares out of a square of 25 squares, of which 8 are threatened, and 8 are passed over. But she threateneth not a piece upon the intervening square of her move. And her movement is as that of the waves of the sea, and (like the Knight) she is not hindered in her motion by a piece on an interven- ing square. This piece re resenteth the undulating action of water and of the isher of Life. 1 sea, and she is ascribe unto the Great Goddess Isis, who is the Cher- The Chess Bishop or Fool, the Tarot Prince. The move of this piece is any number of squares cornerwise (that is only on the diagonal) in any direction even unto the limits of the Tablet. He representeth the keen and swift wind, and he is ascribed unto the God Aroueris. He is stopped by any piece in his way, even as the wind is stopped by a material barrier. He representeth the swift vehicle of the Spirit. The Chess Castle or Rook, the Tarot Princess or Knave. The move of this piece representeth the ponderous and formidable force of earth and its motion is any number of squares in a square direction, perpendicular or horizontal (but not cornerwise) even unto the limits of the board. <361> It is ascribed unto Nephthys the Goddess. It representeth the completed action of the Spirit in matter. Therefore is its movement square, and also stopped by intervening pieces, yet powerful from the length and breadth of its range. The Pawns. The four pawns represent certain forces formed by the con-"},{"pageNumber":709,"pageContent":"The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Nine junction of the Spirit with each of the four elements severally, and they are severally ascribed unto Ameshet, Ahephi, Tmoumathph, and Kabexnuv, who stand before the face of Aeshoori. And their movement is but one square forward, perpendicular, and they threaten one square forward di- agonal on each side, thus formulating the symbol of the Triangle, for they each represent a mixture of three elements under the presidency of the Spirit. Therefore, each is, as it were the servant of the God or Goddess, before whom he standeth. Yet, they be all, ina manner, alike in their action, although their Lords be different. Each is the servant of the God or Goddess whose ele- ment is expressed in his symbol, without its contrary. In each set of three elements, taken together, two must be contrary. Wherefore, for example, Ameshet, who represents Water, Fire, and Earth, is the servant of Nephthys, whose element Earth is expressed in this attribution without the contrary of Air. Ahephi, who represents Air, Fire, and Water, is the servant of Aroueris, whose attribution is Air. Tmournathph, who represents Water, Air, and Earth, is the Servant of Isis, whose attribution is Water. Kabexnuv, who represents Fire, Air, and Earth, is the servant of Horus, whose attribution is Fire. One of the rules concerning the Pawns in actual play is that should one reach the 8th square of its column, it may be exchanged for the piece of which it is vice-gerent. That is, as in ordinary chess, a pawn which reaches the eighth square may be exchanged for any piece the player desires - but in Enochian chess the exchange is limited by the elemental attributions of the <362> pieces. So that were an Ahephipawn the servant of Aroueris, to sur- vive the battle of the entire game and win through to the top of the board, it could be excpnged for a Bishop, even though the Bishop were untaken and still on the board. And so with the others. The opening of chess play is known under the technical title of \"Awak- ening the Abodes.\" As already stated the game is set for four players, each of whom works the pieces at each of the four angles, playing in rotation. Should the game be used for the purposes of divination, the first player would be the querent, the one asking the question, or the person representing the matter about which information is required. This first player chooses which angle of the board he will play from, bearing in mind the divinatory qualities of the elements as set forth in the documents on Geomancy and Tarot. The major difference between Enochian chess and the modern game is that in the former, when using it for divinatory purposes, the moves are decided by the throwing of a dice. Depending upon the number disclosed by the dice, so must a certain piece be moved, for the numbers are attributed to pieces. The actual details of the move - that is whether to right or left, back- ward or forward, to take an opponent or to press forward - are quite obviously left to the personal ingenium and divining mind of the player. The dice only determines specifically that such and such a piece shall be played. The Prime Mover, or the owner of the Ptah piece, plays first, and his first move is to be decided by the throw of the dice to indicate which piece or"},{"pageNumber":710,"pageContent":"Enochian Chess 693 pawn he must first play. Each player follows in rotation, deosil, that is round the board with the sun from the prime player. First the prime player moves, and if his setting is Air, then follow the Water pieces, the Fire pieces, the Earth pieces, and then back again to the Air who is the prime mover. <363> The actual attributions of the numbers on the dice to the Enoch- ian chess-pieces are as follows: If the player throws: 1. He moves a King or any Pawn. 2. He moves a Knight. 3. He moves a Bishop. 4. He moves a Queen. 5. He moves a Castle. 6. He moves a Pawn. At the first move of the game, if the dice cast throws up 1, it clearly can- not apply to the King, for this piece cannot move at all until the pawns have been cleared before him. In that event, a pawn would require to be moved. The reason for the attribution of the numbers on the dice above shown to the chess-pieces are fairly simple. The explanation must be sought in the numbers and powers of the squares on the Sephirotic crosses. On the ten- squared cross, Kether, the Crown, is the first square, which is a fairly sound attribution to the King, who is Osiris, Spirit - the Number 1. Number 2 on the Cross is Chokmah, the Yod of Tetragrammaton, Abba, and therefore the Knight is appropriate. 3 is Binah, to which is referred in the Enochian attributions, the High Priestess card of the Tarot. The mitre of the High Priest- ess determines the selection of the Bishop. 4 is Chesed, to which is attributed the Tarot tnunp The Empress, who is the chess Queen. and 5 is the Castle, referred to Geburah, and the Tarot card The Tower struck by lightning. The remaining number 6 refers to the movement of any pawn, one square. It is not always necessary to use four players. Two individuals may play, each operating two lesser angles and two sets of pieces. Fire and Air would be pitted against Water and Earth. If this is done, then the two sets of elemental pieces of any player must be regarded as a single unit in practice. That is to say if the first player whose pieces are the allies of Fire and Air, checks the Earth King, the second player must not continue the movements of <364> the Water pieces, which are his allies, until he has moved the Earth King out of check by any of the usual technical forms of chess. The reader who understands and appreciates ordinary chess manouevring will appreciate what is expected of him in the course of play. When the so-called \"stale-mate\" occurs, which is when a player has no piece or pawn that he can move without incumng check, that is the King not being in check but so placed that he could not move without getting in to check, the result is that the player whose King is affected loses his turn until his state of \"stale-mate\" is removed. For the purposes of Divination, an additional piece was employed. This was called the Ptah. Any book dealing with the Egyptian God-forms will de- scribe the form in question. A small figure of this should be made, and on the"},{"pageNumber":711,"pageContent":"694 The Golden Dawn: Volume N Book Nine board it will represent the question or matter of divination. The mode of employing it is simple. It has no power at all, and is not actually used in the play. It is only used by the first player to be set on any square in the Lesser Angle from which he begins his play. Any square, that is, except the one on which the King first stands. The King must reach, in the course of the game, this square on which the Ptah is set and remain there for one round of the game undistrubed - that is without moving therefrom - and unchecked. A knowledge of the nature of the Pyramids with their elemental composition, and some knowledge of the Angelic forces represented by those squares and Pyramids, will decide the player as to what square shall be selected for the placing of the Ptah. If the divinatory question concerns the fiery Lesser Angle of the Element of Earth, a question involving Capricornus and the figure Car- cer ruled by Zazel, then the Ptah probably should be placed upon a square of the Angle which is of the nature of Cardinal Earth, as rep- <365> resenting the Yod type of Earth, or on Elemental Fire, that is the Heh (final) type of Fire. The ingenium of the interested student will guide his judgment herein. NOTES CONCERNING THE BOARDS AND THE PLAY GENERALLY Every Lesser Angle throughout the Tablets has a diagonal line of four squares starting from its prime square; which are allotted respectively to Aries, Gemini, Scorpio and Earth. From these four squares the Bishops can move one square into a square of Libra, Sagittarius, Taurus or Water, these completing the series of squares in that Lesser Angle :n which a Bisho~ can move. Let us call this the Aries System of diagonal squares. This diagonal is crossed by another which in the Airy and Watery boards is composed of Cancer, Leo, Virgo and Air Squares, having as subsidiaries, squares of Aquarius, Pisces, Capricorn and Fire. In the Earthy and Fiery board the second series of Four form the diagonal, and the first the sub- sidiaries. Let us call this the Cancer series. If we now examine the Boards we shall see that the Aries system of any Lesser Angle is joined diagonally to the Aries system of the other three Lesser Angles; and that the Cancer also is sjmilarly joined to every other Cancer system. So that we have two systems of squares; viz: the Aries and the Cancer; of the whole, each containing four squares allotted to every sign it contains. This resembles the black and white systems of squares of the ordinary board; and it is as if we allotted the White to Aries, and the black to Cancer. When beginning a game see to which system the Ptah square belongs. Because if it be a square of the Aries system the attack of the opposing Queens is insignificant, while that of the Bishops is strong. In such a case the number of pieces is 6; 2 Bishops, 2 Knights and 2 Rooks. That is, in these mat- ters the Airy attack is strong, and the Watery weak. <366> If the Ptah be on a square of the Cancer System, one opposing Queen directly attacks this Square, but the Bishops do not. In this case the number of attacking pieces is 5; one Queen, 2 Knights, and 2 Rooks. That is, in these matters the Airy attack is insignificant, while the Watery"},{"pageNumber":712,"pageContent":"Enochian Chess 695 is strong. If an opposing Queen can attack the Ptah, the defence should note well which Queen it is and should remember that this fact greatly enhances her power. He should thereupon not hesitate to exchange what might otherwise be considered a more powerful piece for her. She should certainly be ex- changed for a Bishop, and probably also for a Knight. The YHVH order of the pieces corresponds with their respective offen- sive and defensive Powers. Yod. Knight. The most offensive piece. Meh. Queen. More offensive than defensive. Vau. Bishop. More defensive than offensive. Heh (final) Rook. Most defensive. That is in a general sense. Because, according to the circumstances of the actual play, every piece is able to assume both roles of attacking or defending. Note that, as in ordinary chess, opposing Kings may not occupy con- tiguous squares. There must always be one square between them. This, however, does not apply to the Kings who are allies. That is, if Fire and Air are allies, then the Kings of these elements may approach each other and occupy contiguous squares. Naturally they do not check each other. When a King has once been moved from the corner square which he occupied with another piece at the beginning of the game neither he nor that piece can be moved back again to that square unless it be vacant. If the Prime Player's King is checked and he cannot move it, his game is arrested and his pieces cannot move until the pieces of his ally can release his King. That is to say that his pieces remain in situ but having during <367> that time of check no power of action and can neither attack nor threaten; they only block the squares occupied. If the allied King can be check-mated, his partner continues to play and to seek to release him. When both Kings are checkmated, the game is at an end, and the partners checkmated have lost the game. The game is also lost by the first player, when though neither he or his ally is checkmated, the enemies hold such a position that the Prime Player cannot possibly attain the Ptah square. The Knights or Fiery forces of the Elements meet and clash violently in all parts, and are strong in attack against every thing and everywhere. Their moves, like Fire, pass unarrested through the other elements in irregular courses like the lambent flame, leaping both diagonally and square-wise at every move. They contain the potential forces of the other pieces. Their force is similar to the Tarot King, and to Chokmah. They are the Abba forces, and with the Queens represent the Briatic forces of the scheme. The Queens or Watery forces of the Elements never clash with one another, but ever undulate onwards, each in its own course unaffected by opposing or crossing waves. But the Watery forces only move in their respec- tive pre-ordained courses; they cannot leave their limits and enter upon the domain of others. Water, like Fire, is unarrested and undulating, and like Air and Earth it can act diagonally or square-wise, containing the potential force of Air and Earth. They are the Queen of the Tarot, and Binah. They are the Aimah, and are of Briah. The Bishops are subtle and sharp, Airy in quality, moving rapidly, but"},{"pageNumber":713,"pageContent":"696 The Golden Dawn: Volume IV Book Nine easily arrested in their course. They clash not with opposing bishops, and the friendly Airs support each other in attack and defence. Where the active Airs whirl the passives cannot come. They are the forces of the Princes, and of Yet- zirah, the Son. The Rooks are the heavy resisting powers of the Princess, the Earth by nature, mighty indeed in action when preceded by the action of the <368> other three. That is, when in any matter the forces of Fire, Water, and Air have been absorbed and equilibriated, i.e. removed from the board, the mighty powers of the castles come into play. But woe to him who too early calls these ponderous forces forth. The Rook moves through columns as through ranks. She is able, there- fore, to reach every square on the board, and is very powerful. But her move- ment is very ponderous, and it is a piece that is not moved many times in a game unless the forces of the other Elements have been absorbed in its work- ing out. While the Aleph, Mem, and Shin forces are in full operation the Rook is easily attacked and with difficulty defended, unless she remain quiet, and act as a firm basis of support and defence to the side. If she, however, makes the mistake of entering early into action she is nearly sure to fall a prey to the more subtle forces whose proper sphere is attacked. If the more subtle forces do not bring about a solution of the question, and the matter has to be fought out to the bitter end, that is, if the Yetziratic and Briatic forces are absorbed and balanced in the matter, then do the pon- derous forces of Assiah, the Princess, engage in powerful combat. End of Volume Four completing the Work"},{"pageNumber":714,"pageContent":"EPILOGUE In 1903 the Golden Dawn was disbanded in a flurry of scandal and its sundry Adepts left to form their own tribes leaving the Order to die. But did it? Like an oak, shattered by the storm, which scatters wide its acorns, The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn bequeathed a body of Knowledge, teachings and information to the ensuing generations. This became the root of the modem Neo- Pagan movement, which is the fastest growing religion in this country, according to the Institute for the Study of American Religion In the last twenty years we have seen a vast and varied resurgence in the study of the Occult and MagicMArts. Whole new realms of thought and consciousness have been opened, new arts and veins of creativity have been tapped. Many of these we can trace back to that not so old and yet ancient school called the Golden Dawn. To understand the place of the Golden Dawn today, we must first examine its original purpose and intent. Immediately upon gazing into the system we see that its initiatory rituals served primarily to teach a philosophy and doctrine of Magickal thought. Each ritual presented the candidate, within the confines of a highly charged magickal space, a huge parcel of information to be assimilated before the next initia- tion. Other groups, such as Aleister Crowley's O.T.O., are not teaching orders and so many turn to the G.D. to found their practice within a coherent system. Besides the communication, there is the transmission of the Magickal current. Magickly, according to the \"Z\" papers, the initiations served to imprint the energies of the system into the aura of the candidate. Together. the initiations attempted to build the ~abalistic microcosm called the Tree of-me into the soul of the ~kdidate. The intent was to both evolve the subject soul and to provide an artifice whereby the soul could articulate its will. As a system of thought the Golden Dawn brought together and energized the sundry branches of Hermetic and Magickal Practice. For the first time since perhaps the ancient Egyptians, the divergent streams of rnagickal energy like daemonology,* astrology and tarot were fused together in a single coherent albeit unwieldy system For the Adepts the system was a vessel and vehicle for Magickal Power. The Golden Dawn as RR et AC functioned as framework within which to operate as a group. From this platform the adventurous could set out to explore new magicks while at the same time the mage could plot the course of her development by analogy to the Qabalistic Tree of Life. The value of this last to the aspirant is incalculable. By means of reference to the phases of consciousness and the symbols attributed to them the mage could always determine \"where she is\" and thus never be lost, a most hor- rible fate. Today, however, this system functions exponentially, and it provides a baseline of information and technique for reference. All too often at the Neo-Pagan Festivals one overhears hushed whispers, 'Well, in the G.D. they.. .\" 'Not \"demonology\" in the common usage of evil spirits; rather duemonology concerns super- natural beings (including even The Holy Guardian Angel) intermediate between humanity and God. C.LW. 69 7"},{"pageNumber":715,"pageContent":"698 The Golden Dawn We hear in the opening of the Neophytes \"by names and images are all powers awakened and reawakened.\" Dion Fortune rightly notes that these thought-forms or structures of mind are vessels of power and the means of communication with the powers. As these structures endure beyond the minds of their creators they are available to those who use the names and images as published in such a work as this. In fact these natural forces, anthropomorphised into entities, are accessed by the newcomer through a relatively minute amount of concentration for these symbols were sturdily formulated by the founders of the system. This ease of application is a major attraction to the users of the Golden Dawn system of magick. The energies that would have otherwise been nec- essary to make contact with spiritual powers could then be used toward cre- ative application of the essences invoked. Today, the task of the practitioner is to induce, through the rites and formu- lae, the trancendental spirit of the Order into the re-created forms, thereby reincarnating the \"soul of the Mysteries\" essentiarto the reflowering of the Order. The study of Magick leads one into harmony with Nature and the Universe at large. A major factor in the development of the Neo-Pagan movement was a growing concern with the environment and its abuse. Magick in the form of Wicca or the Craft formed the spiritual link whereby this awareness could express itself. The G.D. provided much of the technology. It is interesting to note that an Adept of the G.D., J.W. Brodie-Innes, trav- eled extensively in the British Isles to study Witchcraft. Now the Witches stud his Order in the learning of their Craft. ~f;e elemental arrangements and attributions employed by the modern Witches often have their roots in the G.D. The very concept of the Circle and the Guardians at the Four Quarters was not extant in the older family tradi- tions at least until after the demise of the G.D. The G.D. has been a fountain head of inspiration for the new Pagans. One beautiful example of use of G.D. technology in a new and creative manner is a variant on the Lotus Wand seen at an East coast festival. That pagan had formed a staff topped by a crystal ball. The shaft was painted in the traditional rainbow attributed by the Golden Dawn to the Zodiac and the Sigils of the Signs were painted in their flashing colors. There is at least one group that, bein unable to decide u on a pantheon from any specific culture, chose to use the d~. system of ~nocftiana to found their tradition upon. The G.D. practice was chosen over the others as being clearer, more easily worked and more highly developed. Another line of development in the modem Craft is called Traditionalist Wicca, (not to be confused with the Family Traditions). Upon realising that the inordinate amount of Enochiana and G.D. style techniques was not a later accretion as previously thought, its adherents researched still deeper into the origins of their Book of Shadows or Grimoire. They concluded that the origina- tor of their readition either had access to G.D. material before their popular publication or had been a member. Thelema is another thriving avenue of thought that must be examined in the light of the Golden Dawn. Without a thorough knowledge of Gold- en Dawn symbolism and ritual the Book of the Law, Liber AL, is either impenetrable or ridiculous. The formula of \"Ra-hoor-khuit hath taken his seat in the East at the Equinox of the Gods\" (AL. I, 49) only becomes meaningful within the context of the Golden Dawn Equinox ceremony. The system of magick and philosophy founded by Aleister Crowley and developed further by many others is deeply indebted to the Golden Dawn. The pri- mary rituals for daily practice in Thelemic Magick, 'The Star Ruby,\" \"V. vel Reguli\" and the like, are patterned after the G.D. Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, the"},{"pageNumber":716,"pageContent":"Epilogue 699 Greater Pentagram ritual and others. Their practice without previous mastery of the G.D. forms is difficult if not fruitless. Thelema, as a semi-organised collective of the Magick Users, goes to great lengths to include the structure of the G.D. in the A :. A :. (seeMagick in Theory &Prac- tice). The grade structure employed is practically identical, although augmented with yoga and a different separation of learning tasks. However,the states of magickal con- sciousness as symbolised by the grades are the same. Crowley used the space in the RR et AC mythos of the Third order to \"slot in\" his conception of the A :. A :.. None- theless it was built fidy upon the foundation of the Golden Dawn and evolved further by his successors in that light. Before one can fully appreciate the subtlety of the magicks of Wi and Love it is necessary to have a firm grounding in magickal technology. No organized body of magickal practice is more geared to the neophyte than that of the Golden Dawn. Only Franz Bardon comes near in completeness and many find his works impenetrable and filled with blinds. In many ways the G.D. practices and exercises are like the \"forms\" of Tai Chi and other martial arts. As the student masters the outer forms the inner energy and understanding blossoms within her. This is one meaning behind the aphorism \"the rituals shall be half known and half concealed.. .\" (AL I, 34.) This factor of having to master the forms before they are truly useful has been pointed to as evidence thit the system is contrived. his and the apa;ently unsupport- able overlays of one subsystem on top of another that Mathers and Crowley et a1 built into the atkibutional tabies makes the totality insusceptible to rational analysis. Yet the fact that the Adept, after long practice, can make the system \"work\" demands that we ask how and sends us on that quest called \"Initiation\". A glance at the gymnast gracefully and easily executing maneuvers that would injure or kill the average per- son provides a fit analogy to the spiritual gymnastics of the adept and her required training period. In the midst of the modem search for initiation into this Magick of Light it would serve the student well to examine the Alternative Health Community. Here she would find a faint but clear echo of the healing work reputed among the Adepts of the G.D. Israel Regardie speaks of the processes of healing through the use of the Middle Pillar. How similar to this are the practices of Shiatsu and Polarity Therapy! In all of these forms the Healer uses her own energies to readjust the flow of vital energies in the client. The ability to channel energy, call it Light, chi, magnetism or whatever, is essen- tial to the practice of Ceremonial Magick. This is tlie same force that forms the Pen- tagrams and sigils drawn in the rituals. Having developed these methods and tech- nologies to a peak within the magickal substratum of Western culture, it is interesting and grabfying to see analogies of Golden Dawn technologies coming into general use. Since the early part of this century we have learned much about ourselves and the Universe we live in. Many new paradigms for viewing the world and many new technologies for manipulating it have been discovered. Today we have the phe- nomenal tools that Information Theory provides to examine how the varied aspects of this System called the Golden Dawn hold together. Jungian psychology would work hand in hand with the Magickal images to access levels of consciousness previously untapped with so much precision, as the G.D attributions provide keys telling the researcher what to expect and how to inter- pret the results. Whole system or Gestalt psychology enables the magicker to see the many spirits and voices as parts of the self and yet the magickal technologies provide a means for articulating the interactions in a powerful and meaningful way."},{"pageNumber":717,"pageContent":"700 The Golh Daum These are ways the magickal worldview of the G.D. could be explored in the field of psychology, and yet the Hermetic Science also delved into the physics of nature. Now that the scientists have caught up with the ancient Hermetic philosophers in noting that the observer affects the observed (see Heisenberg's Uncertainty Princi- ple, Bohr's Copenhagen Interpretation, and Schr'ddinger's Cat) it is now possible to correlate the teachings of ancient wisdoms, if we have the courage to see them clearly. One profitable vein of research is in R Buckminster Fuller's Synergetic Geomet- ries which link the patterns of thought to the interpatternings of the stars and sub- atomic particles. This is clearly a not so faint echo of the axiom \"As above, s~ below.\" Another is in reexamining the ancient Egyptian teaching as brought to light by the researches of RA. Schwaller de Lubicz connecting consciousness and matter in hieroglyphic expression. We may find the eternal wisdom of the ancient sages etched in stone and built into their architecture helpful in understanding humanity as part and not separate from Nature.

As we approach the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Golden Dawn, it is being reexamined by young thinkers with an eye to revamping it in light of the dis- coveries of the last 80 years since it \"collapsed\". Or did it collapse? Perhaps it is better to remember that the Golden Dawn Sys- tem of Magick is not a Book but is a living growing, self-redifying organism that will endure unto the end for in the end there is naught to endure.
