Although he was born in England, he spentmost of his life in the United States. As a young man, Regardie studied everytext on magic and mysticism that he could get his hands on. In 1932, Regardiewas a twenty-five-year-old published author, with two of his most importantbooks in print that year: A Garden of Pomegranates, which describes themystical system known as the Qabalah, and The Tree of Life, a comprehensivetextbook covering virtually every aspect of magic from the perspective of apracticing magician. This later book is still considered to be Regardie’smagnum opus.Publication of The Tree of Life brought Regardie an invitation into the StellaMatutina, the most viable remaining offshoot of the Hermetic Order of theGolden Dawn. He was initiated into the order in January of 1933 and maderapid progress through the grades. However, Regardie was very disappointedwith the state of affairs within the group. He left the Stella Matutina at the endof 1934, having concluded that much of the order’s teachings would soon belost due to neglect. Three years later, he published much of the order’steachings in four volumes titled The Golden Dawn. This was a game-changingevent in the world of ceremonial magic.In 1938, Regardie published The Philosopher’s Stone, a work on spiritualalchemy. At the time of its writing, Regardie was convinced that medievalalchemy was a thinly veiled psycho-spiritual process—that the laboratoryoperations of alchemy said to work on various substances in order to change“lead into gold” were in reality focused solely on man’s mind, soul, and spirit.The manuscript of Gold was written sometime between 1938 and 1941, asindicated by the date at the end of the original introduction. The subject of"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Gold, like The Philosopher’s Stone, is spiritual alchemy. However, Gold takesup exactly where the earlier book left off, comparing the Great Work ofalchemy to the goals of Eastern mysticism—samadhi of yoga and satori of ZenBuddhism. It was during this period that Regardie immersed himself in thestudy of psychology and psychotherapy, a fact that is clearly evident in Gold.We were presented with this unpublished Regardie manuscript by a sourcewho wishes to remain anonymous. The lone copy of this text was damaged, andbecause of the poor condition of the paper, it was necessary to reconstruct oneor two sentences. Such occurrences are very minimal, however, and are clearlyindicated in our footnotes.Israel Regardie is often credited as the person most responsible for removingthe veil of secrecy surrounding ceremonial magic and Western occultism. Fordecades, students have appreciated Regardie’s expertise and wisdom. Hisreader-friendly style of writing is a cherished hallmark of all his works.Therefore, it is with great pleasure that we present Gold.

It is the knot and link of all theElements, which it contains in itself, as being also the Spirit whichnourishes all things, and by the assistance whereof Nature works in theUniverse. [...] Know then, my dear Son, that the ignorant man cannotcomprehend the secret of the Art, because it depends upon the Knowledgeof the true Body, which is hidden from him.—from THE TRUE BOOK OF THE LEARNED GREEK ABBOT SYNESIUS (by anonymous)he history of alchemy is a tale of knowledge discovered, nearly lost,rediscovered, and reinterpreted. The “Royal Art,” the “Hermetic Art, and“the Philosophy of the Wise” are just a few of the epithets associated with thespiritual science of alchemy, a word composed of the Arabic words al andkhemi, referring to “the Egyptian matter.” Alchemy traces its roots to BronzeAge Egypt, where the prevailing religious beliefs and practices surroundingmummification led to an elementary understanding of chemistry, which in turnbecame linked to magic and the concept of eternal life. Beginning in the sixthcentury BCE, Greek philosophers such as Heracleitus, Pythagoras, Aristotle,and Plato began to incorporate alchemical ideas into their teachings. Over time,Greek thought and Egyptian spirituality merged into Hermeticism and Neo-Platonic philosophy, which spread across the Greek-speaking world. Some ofthe earliest surviving texts on alchemy, including works by Zosimos ofPanoplis, date from the Hellenistic period (roughly 300 BCE–300 CE)."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"In legend, the founder of alchemy was reputed to be none other than the fabledmaster Hermes Trismegistus. “Hermes the Thrice Great” was said to be anancient Egyptian priest and magician credited with writing forty-two bookscollectively known as the Hermetic literature. These books, including theEmerald Tablet and the Divine Pymander, describe the creation of theuniverse, the soul of humanity, and the way to achieve spiritual rebirth.In the latter stages of the Roman Empire, alchemical principles found theirway into works by Plotinus and Proclus. However, by the fourth and fifthcenturies, the Church’s persecution of all non-Christian religions and paganacademies resulted in scholars fleeing en masse into Persia. An importantschool founded in the city of Harran during this time was instrumental inpreserving all manner of Hellenistic knowledge. After the Muslim conquest ofEgypt in the seventh century, the Arabs absorbed the knowledge of theAlexandrian alchemists and carefully preserved many Greek and Arabic textson the subject. Thus the Islamic world became the caretaker of the alchemicalarts and all other ancient sciences, which they brought to Spain in the eighthcentury. From the ninth to the eleventh century, Spain became a repository ofalchemical knowledge; notable Arabic alchemists included Jabir ibn Hayyan(known by the Latinized name “Geber”) and Ibn Sina (“Avicenna”).The Crusades, as well as the Christian reclamation of Moorish Spain, broughtthe knowledge of alchemy back into Europe, and a good number of alchemicaltexts were translated from Arabic into Latin. Important medieval alchemistswho benefited from having access to this information included AlbertusMagnus, or “Albert the Great” (1200–1280), the most prolific author of his dayand a champion of natural science; Englishman Roger Bacon (1220–1292), achief advocate of experimental science in the Middle Ages; and FrenchmanNicolas Flamel (1330–1418), who studied astrology and Qabalah in addition toalchemy. Other scholars such as Raymond Lully (1235–1315) and Arnold ofVillanova (1235–1311) probed the spiritual side of alchemy.The Renaissance period was the golden age of European alchemy. It wasduring this time that Cosimo de’ Medici commissioned Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499) to translate the Corpus Hermeticum. The works of Hermes Trismegistus"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"were considered so important that Ficino had to put aside translation of theentire works of Plato until after the Corpus Hermeticum had been tackled.Another Renaissance figure, Basilius Valentinus (or Basil Valentine), wroteseveral important treatises including The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony(1604) and The Twelve Keys (1599). Possibly the greatest alchemist of all wasGerman-Swiss physician Paracelsus (1493–1541), who maintained theHermetic view that human life was inseparable from the life of the cosmos.Paracelsus is credited with starting what would later become the science ofpharmacology.By the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, alchemists and philosophers suchas John Dee, Robert Fludd, Jean Baptiste van Helmont, and Sir Isaac Newtonwere regularly studying the practical and mystical aspects of the spagyric art.However, by the eighteenth century the once-revered science was beingsteadily usurped by its prodigy—interest in alchemy declined as modernchemistry gained popularity and respect. In time, only mystics sought outalchemy’s hidden wisdom. To the general public, alchemy became unfairlytarnished as a primitive pseudo-science.What is alchemy? The “separative art” is an early form of sacred chemistrythat explores the nature of various substances. It is a multifaceted naturalscience–philosophy rooted in a spiritual worldview in which everything in thecosmos contains a universal spirit that is the origin of all matter, which is aliving thing. Alchemy teaches that by combining the four basic qualities ofliving matter (earth, fire, air, and water) in certain ratios, the alchemist can“speed up” the processes of nature, with the goal of perfecting and transforminga substance to its highest possible potential as a universal medicine, the elixirof life, or the Philosopher’s Stone. At its core, alchemy is concerned withpurification, transformation, and growth. Its objective is to bring all things,especially humanity, to their preordained state of perfection.Alchemy has always had a dual nature and two lines of approach. Practicalalchemy is concerned with transforming a base material into a higher, morepurified substance, such as the turning of lead or a lesser metal into gold, or theextraction of a medicinal substance from a plant in order to create a healing"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"elixir. This is the type of alchemy readers traditionally think of when theyencounter the term—a laboratory stocked with furnaces, bellows, stills,condensers, and glass beakers.While many alchemists worked in a lab, the principal interest of manyalchemical philosophers was spiritual. These alchemists did not look merelyfor the substance of gold; they sought to give the quality of gold to their ownbeing, to transmute the base metals—the gross and impure parts of their ownnature—into spiritual gold, or divine wisdom.Spiritual or inner alchemy is concerned with the transformation of the humansoul from a state of baseness to one of spiritual enlightenment. In mysticalterms, alchemy is symbolic of a conversion from the heavy, leaden, physical,earthbound consciousness to the refined gold of the divinely inspired being. Itcreates a road map of the internal energies that can affect the purification ofbody, mind, and soul.The goal of alchemy is called the Magnum Opus, or the “Great Work.” Thisrefers to the purification and evolution of something lesser and baser intosomething greater and more exalted—whether the practitioner is working withmetals, vegetable matter, or human consciousness. The process of alchemy isoften symbolized by the transformation of lead, the darkest, heaviest, and leastvaluable of the metals, into pure gold, the most brilliant and valuable of metals.The classical texts of alchemy are rich in symbolism and allegory. Some ofthese books contained little more than alchemical prints and illustrations.Others had few illustrations but were filled with cryptic language, enigmaticrhymes, and perplexing metaphors and allegories. The practical reason usuallygiven for this coded language is that the alchemists wished to hide theirlaboratory techniques from those who would profane the sacred art. However,it was also thought that only those who were spiritually pure could decode themessage and unlock the divine secrets of the art. “Alchemy is not merely an artor science to teach metallic transmutation, so much as a true and solid sciencethat teaches how to know the center of all things, which in the divine languageis called the Spirit of Life.” 1"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Alchemy has gained popularity in recent years through the works of Swisspsychologist Carl G. Jung, who construed alchemy as an age-old method ofpsychological transformation clothed in the terminology of metalworking. Thesystem developed by Jung, known as analytical psychology, became one of themost common mechanisms for the interpretation of occult phenomena in thetwentieth century. The main thrust behind Jungian psychology is that all occultand religious phenomena are psychological in nature and are connected to therelationship between the individual and the realm of the collective unconscious.The primary inhabitants of the collective unconscious are the archetypes—pre-existent ideas or basic categories of human awareness. They are centers ofpsychological energy that tend to surface in human consciousness throughsimilar forms and images. These images are timeless and universal.Jung was intrigued by the fate of Austrian psychoanalyst Herbert Silberer,whose magnum opus, Problems of Mysticism and Its Symbolism (1917), 2represented the first serious attempt to correlate the methods of psychoanalysiswith the literature of alchemy, Rosicrucianism, and Freemasonry. Unfortunately,Silberer’s work was thoroughly rejected by his mentor Sigmund Freud and helater committed suicide because of it.Jung was influenced by the work of Silberer and the fact that alchemicalsymbolism kept appearing in the dreams of patients who had no knowledge ofalchemy at all. Jung came to believe that these symbols originated from thecollective unconscious of humanity, and that the work of alchemy was a processof individuation, or self-realization toward a fully integrated personality. In1926, Jung had a remarkable dream in which he saw himself as a seventeenth-century alchemist engaged in the Great Work. This dream led Jung to arevelation that alchemy was a connecting link between the spiritual wisdom ofthe ancient Gnostics and the modern science of psychology. Jung described hisrevelation in his autobiography:[Alchemy] represented the historical link with Gnosticism, and [...] a continuity therefore existedbetween past and present. Grounded in the natural philosophy of the Middle Ages, alchemy formedthe bridge on the one hand into the past, to Gnosticism, and on the other into the future, to the modernpsychology of the unconscious. First I had to find evidence for the historical prefiguration of my owninner experiences. That is to say, I had to ask myself, “Where have my particular premises already"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"occurred in history?” If I had not succeeded in finding such evidence, I would never have been able tosubstantiate my ideas. Therefore, my encounter with alchemy was decisive for me, [...] Only bydiscovering alchemy have I clearly understood that the Unconscious is a process and that ego’srapports with the unconscious and his contents initiate an evolution, more precisely a realmetamorphoses of the psyche.3Beginning in the 1940s, much of Jung’s work focused on the psychologicalimplications of alchemy as revealed in his text Psychology and Alchemy(1944). Jung’s view became very popular, particularly in the twentieth century,because it provided a way for alchemy to be explored in a manner that did notdirectly contradict the theorems and principles of modern science. As a result,alchemical symbols, metaphors, and concepts have been extensively adoptedinto a wide variety of psychological and spiritual endeavors in ways that themedieval alchemists could have scarcely imagined. In a series of filmedinterviews he gave in 1957, Jung reiterated his basic alchemical theory:Of course I cannot tell you in detail about alchemy. It is the basis of our modern way of conceivingthings, and therefore it is as if it were right under the threshold of consciousness. It gives you awonderful picture of how the development of archetypes, the movement of archetypes, looks whenyou see them as if from above. From today you look back into the past, and you see how the presentmoment has evolved out of the past. Alchemical philosophy—it sounds very curious. We should give itan entirely different name. It does have a different name, it is called Hermetic philosophy, though ofcourse that conveys just as little as the term alchemy. It is the parallel development, as Gnosticismwas, to the conscious development of Christianity, of our Christian philosophy, of the whole psychologyof the Middle Ages.4Israel Regardie’s education in alchemy began early. In 1926, the same yearthat Jung dsreamt he was an alchemist, a nineteen year-old Regardie joined theWashington College of the Societas Rosicruciana in America, where he studiedmany aspects of Hermetic philosophy. By the end of 1929, Regardie was livingin London. At this time he was “studying mysticism in all its phases, branchesand variations.”5 Having served for a time as Aleister Crowley’s secretary inParis, Regardie became an esoteric author in his own right with the publicationof A Garden of Pomegranates and The Tree of Life in 1932. Publication of thelatter opened the way for Regardie’s initiation and advancement into variousgrades of the Stella Matutina. After leaving the order in 1934, Regardie"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"continued to study and write books, including The Golden Dawn (1937), TheArt of True Healing (1937), and The Philosopher’s Stone (1938).The study of the human psyche was also a subject that was close toRegardie’s heart. He underwent a lengthy Freudian analysis and studiedpsychotherapy with Dr. E. Clegg and Dr. Laurence J. Bendit in London. In1937, Regardie returned to the United States and turned his attention topsychology. He studied with Dr. Nandor Fodor in New York and entered theColumbia Institute of Chiropractic (CIC, today’s New York ChiropracticCollege), graduating in 1941 with a doctorate in psychology. In his applicationto the CIC, Regardie wrote:Since 1931 I have done a good deal of journalism on philosophical and psychological topics, and havewritten eight books, five of which so far have been published. [...] I had read widely on Psycho-Analysis and Analytical Psychology. In 1935 I began studying it from a practical point of view, andhave received about 150 hours of analysis with three leading Harley and Wimpole Streetpsychologists. I practiced Massage in London for two years under London County Council license.[...] Was trained in hypnotic procedure by the superintendent of an English mental hospital and by aprivate practitioner. I have used, as a lay practitioner, both the methods of Analytical Psychology andhypnosis ever since.6After graduating, Regardie established a clinical practice and taught anatomyfor a time while at CIC before enlisting in the United States Army in 1942. In1944, he relocated to California and set up practice as a chiropractor and aReichian therapist. He also taught psychiatry at the Los Angeles College ofChiropractic. During this time he contributed articles to various psychologymagazines, including the American Journal of Psychotherapy and PsychiatricQuarterly.Regardie’s first text on alchemy, The Philosopher’s Stone, was written over atwo-week period in the winter of 1936–37 when he was bedridden in Londonwith a severe bout of bronchitis. To make the best use of this time, he wasdetermined to tackle a lengthy and difficult text on alchemy, Mary AnneAtwood’s A Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery (1850), whichdocumented the enormous impact of Hermetic philosophy on human spirituality.The essence of Atwood’s hypothesis was that alchemy was actually a methodfor transforming the human soul through altered states of consciousness, and that"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"all mention of metals, minerals, and alchemical processes were merely symbolsand metaphors for spiritual alchemy.It was during his illness, spent studying Atwood, that Regardie experiencedhis eureka moment concerning alchemy. He was convinced that alchemy was inreality a thinly veiled psycho-spiritual process, and that all alchemicaloperations concerning the transmutation of various substances were focusedsolely on man’s mind, soul, and spirit. In other words, “practical” laboratoryalchemy was simply wrong-headed, and only theoretical, spiritual, orpsychological alchemy was valid. In The Philosopher’s Stone, Regardieadmitted that while a certain number of alchemical texts could be construed ashaving a literal, “primitively chemical” interpretation, he was adamant thatalchemical writings should be “interpreted solely in terms of psychological andmystical terms.” At this period in his life, Regardie felt that laboratory alchemywas at best a blind that veiled sublime spiritual truths through symbolism, andat worst a shell game perpetrated by “puffers.”In The Philosopher’s Stone, Regardie presents three seventeenth-centuryalchemical treatises—“The Golden Treatise of Hermes,” “The Six Keys ofEudoxus,” and “Coelum Terrae”—documents infused with riddles andemblematic language used to communicate to fellow alchemists in secret. In theintervening chapters, Regardie skillfully pulls the psychological import fromthe symbols and metaphors of these three cryptic texts, drawing upon his owninspiration as well as knowledge gained though the writings of Silberer, Jung,and others. His approach was to analyze these seventeenth-century textsemblematically, using the symbol systems of magic, Qabalah, and Jungianpsychology to explain how the laboratory operations of alchemy were reallypsychoanalytical methods for self-realization and spiritual attainment.Gold, written between 1938 and 1941, is a direct follow-up to ThePhilosopher’s Stone, containing many of the same assertions about alchemy. Inthe present book, which might well be called called “Volume Two” of ThePhilosopher’s Stone, Regardie continues to shed light on the psycho-spiritualmeaning behind the cryptograms of the spagyric art. This time, only onealchemical treatise is presented for dissection and analysis, The True Book of"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"the Learned Synesius, a Greek Abbot, Taken Out of the Emperour’s Library,Concerning the Philosopher’s Stone, written by an anonymous alchemist whocould not have been Synesius of Cyrene, bishop of Ptolemais. As in hisprevious book, Regardie discusses this treatise in the language of Jungianpsycho-analysis, magnetism, and hypnosis. But here the discussion is morespecific, with Regardie citing his own experiences as a therapist, as well assome examples from pioneers in hypnosis and the study of the human aura. Healso explores the similarities between alchemy, Taoist philosophy, yoga, andZen Buddhism.Approximately thirty years after writing The Philosopher’s Stone and Gold,Regardie completely reversed his thinking about laboratory alchemy. Thischange of heart was a result of his having attended a seminar by Albert Riedel,acclaimed founder of the Paracelsus Research Society in Salt Lake City, Utah,which offered instructional courses in practical alchemy. The work of FraterAlbertus, as Riedel was known, was instrumental in reviving the laboratorypractice of alchemy in the latter half of the twentieth century. In his introductionto the second edition of The Philosopher’s Stone, Regardie describes hismeeting with Albertus and his next eureka moment concerning alchemy:It took only a few minutes to realize that I was talking to the first person I had ever met who knewwhat he was talking about on the subject of Alchemy. We promised to keep in touch—and we did.This promise later eventuated in an invitation to attend a seminar on Alchemy that he wasconducting at the newly instituted Paracelsus Research Society in Salt Lake City. Most of the materialpresented in the Seminar concerned Alchemy, Qabalah, Astrology, etc.—with which I was alreadytheoretically familiar—though even there some radically new and stimulating viewpoints wereobtained. But the piece-de-resistance was the laboratory work. Here I was wholly dumbfounded.It took no more than a few minutes to help me realize how presumptuous I had been to assertdogmatically that all Alchemy was psycho-spiritual. What I witnessed there, and have since repeated,has sufficed to enable me to state categorically that, in insisting solely on a mystical interpretation ofAlchemy, I had done a grave disservice to the ancient sages and philosophers.7Admitting that he had to eat crow with regard to his previously held beliefs,Regardie was happy to do so, although he decided against rewriting his earliertexts on alchemy. Nevertheless, he still felt that a mystical and psychologicalinterpretation of some alchemical texts was legitimate. “There is unequivocallythis aspect of the subject.” Some alchemical texts “cannot be interpreted except"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"in these terms.” 8 Therefore, he let his original texts on spiritual alchemy standas they had been written and suggested that students supplement their readingswith alchemical texts “of more recent vintage.”This continues to be good advice. Today there are several good books onpractical alchemy, which is undeniably an important part of the hermetic art.Should students be inclined to learn more about the laboratory methods ofalchemical work, they should consult The Alchemist’s Handbook by FraterAlbertus, The Practical Handbook of Plant Alchemy by Manfred Junius, ThePath of Alchemy by Mark Stavish, and Real Alchemy and The Way of theCrucible by Robert Allen Bartlett. Additionally, articles by practicingalchemists are included in the second half of the latest edition of Regardie’sThe Philosopher’s Stone: Spiritual Alchemy, Psychology, and Ritual Magic.Why has Gold not been published until now? The manuscript has been held inthe hands of a friend of Regardie for several years. By the time Regardie wrotethe second introduction to his classic text The Golden Dawn in 1968, hisinteraction with the Paracelsus Research Society caused him to drasticallyrethink his belief that practical laboratory alchemy was specious. He wasabsolutely stunned at the revelation that alchemy was a bona fide physicalscience and not merely a metaphoric structure for mysticism. Since Regardie nolonger agreed with his previous approach to the subject of alchemy, he nolonger wished to see Gold published. Thus the manuscript remained lockedaway in a drawer for decades.However, with the passage of time, the owner of the document realized theinherent value of Regardie’s original thoughts, and while the psycho-spiritualapproach to alchemy was certainly not the only way to tackle the spagyric art,the alchemical information as well as the Jungian approach presented in Goldwas still valid, vital, lucid, and practical. Rather than let this important bookcontinue to crumble away into dust, the owner decided to let it be publishedand made available to interested readers, students of alchemy, and admirers ofRegardie’s writings. So when we were contacted by the document’s steward,we were thrilled and honored to be able to serve the esoteric community bysaving this significant text."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The subject of Gold is spiritual alchemy, an important topic in its own right.Although Regardie was wrong in his initial assessment of laboratory alchemy,he was right to lavish high praise on inner alchemy.A spiritual alchemist is the subject of his own alchemical experiments; heanalyzes, identifies, or separates the various parts of his own psychic makeup.Nothing can remain repressed or shoved into the cellar of the subconsciousmind. No portion of the psyche can remain buried. The tools and substancesdescribed in alchemy represent the various states of consciousness and themethods for achieving them. The alchemical metals of lead, iron, copper, tin,mercury, silver, and gold, as well as other substances enshrined in alchemicalliterature, are emblems of the numerous life experiences the soul must endure inorder to build a worthy spiritual body—a sturdy vehicle for the Divine Light.The internal quest for the Stone of the Wise brings us to the crossroads ofscience and religion—to the junction between the mind and the soul. And it ishere that we find the connection that exists between ancient magic and modern-day psychology.Franz Hartmann put it this way:Alchemy is that science which results from a knowledge of God, Nature, and Man. A perfectknowledge of either of them cannot be obtained without the knowledge of the other two, for thesethree are one and inseparable. Alchemy is not merely an intellectual, but a spiritual science; becausethat which belongs to the spirit can only be spiritually known. Nevertheless, it is a science dealing withmaterial things, for spirit and matter are only two opposite manifestations or “poles” of the eternal one.Alchemy is an art, and as every art requires an artist to exercise it, likewise this divine science and artcan be practiced only by those who are in possession of the divine power necessary for that purpose.It is true that the external manipulations required for the production of certain alchemical preparationsmay, like an ordinary chemical process, be taught to anybody capable of reasoning; but the resultswhich he would accomplish would be without life, for only he in whom the true life has awakened canawaken it from its sleep in the prima materia, and cause visible forms to grow from the Chaos ofnature. Alchemy in its highest aspects deals with the spiritual regeneration of man.9Changes Made to Regardie’s TextAs we pointed out in the foreword, the only surviving copy of Gold was inpoor condition, and as a result one sentence had to be reconstructed asindicated in the relevant footnote."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Gold, like Regardie’s other early works, featured Qabalistic words writtenwith an Ashkenazic dialect. This is a form of Hebrew pronunciation used incentral Europe wherein the Hebrew letter tau, or tav, is sometimes pronouncedas an “s” rather than a “t” or “th.” Although Ashkenazic may have been theHebrew pronunciation that Regardie grew up with, and was probably thedialect spoken by his Hebrew tutor in the early 1920s, it was not the dialectpreferred by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and its offshoots, all ofwhich employed the more common Sephardic, or Mediterranean dialect. TheSephardic version is used almost exclusively by Western magicians today. Withthis in mind, we have changed Sephiros to Sephiroth, Keser to Kether, Daas toDaath, Tiphares to Tiphareth, Malkus to Malkuth, and so on, to reflect themodern usage. In his later years, Regardie also turned to Sephardic spellingsand pronunciations, so we are confident that he would have approved of thesechanges to his text.Explanatory titles have been added to the various chapters that Regardie hadoriginally listed as numbered “commentaries.” Because of this change, readerswill have a better preview of what is contained within the chapters.Additionally, all British spellings have been changed to American, which, inthe original manuscript, were not consistently one way or the other.Readers should note that Regardie’s use of the term “man” or “men” torepresent humanity as a whole was common for the time period in which Goldwas written and was not intended to be sexist or to refer only to males. It wasconventional for authors of Regardie’s era to use these terms to reference allhumankind, regardless of gender.The following is a description of the various chapters and sections of Gold.Regardie’s Introduction examines claims and theories around the authorshipof The True Book of the Learned Greek Abbot Synesius, as well as the socialand spiritual environment in which the book was written.Following the Introduction, The True Book of the Learned Synesius, a GreekAbbot, Taken Out of the Emperour’s Library, Concerning the Philosopher’sStone is given in its entirety."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Chapter One: Alchemy and Psychology continues the discussion thatRegardie started in his book The Philosopher’s Stone concerning what hebelieved to be the true nature of alchemy and its relation to spirituality,philosophy, and psychology. To be concise, Regardie thought that descriptionsof chemical operations in alchemy constituted a smoke screen designed toconceal the real subject of the Royal Art: the human mind: “Since the advent ofmodern psychological knowledge,” he writes, “we have been given a key to theunderstanding of myths, epics, legends and dreams of every kind ... It is to thisbranch of scientific research that we must first turn in seeking an elucidation ofthe enigmas and obscurities of the alchemical works.”Chapter Two: The Universal Agent, Polarity, and the CollectiveUnconscious examines the animating principle of the universe known by manynames: Spirit, Mercury of the Wise, anima mundi, First Matter, Quintessence,etc. This Agent is divided into the two great universal polarities of masculineand feminine within the processes of alchemy, just as it is within the humanpsyche.Chapter Three: The Mystical Experience explores the one thing that lies “atthe foundation of every great religion” and is shared by mystics the world over,regardless of which faith they ascribe to: enlightenment, illumination, or unionwith God. Visualization, devotional exercises, and prayer are cited as some ofthe techniques whereby the mystic can achieve this state of mind, withparticular emphasis on the experience of satori in Zen Buddhism.Chapter Four: The Great Work investigates the various processes that thealchemist must undergo in order to complete the Great Work of integration.Awareness of this Living Mercury must be “widened, enhanced andheightened.” This is neither an easy nor a quick process.Chapter Five: The Secret Fire examines how alchemical change isaccomplished in the human psyche, mainly through harnessing and directing thespiritual forces of the libido, “the power and active side of the psyche, theenergy which must be released from the primordial deeps.” Through consciouseffort, training, and voluntary disintegration, the mind’s root essence is laid"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"bare and the “libido or vital stress normally resident in the Unconscious isactivated, welling up to the surface to heat or stir up the contents of the mind.”Chapter Six: Magnetism, Visualization, and Healing looks at themanipulation of vital life force using mesmerism, hypnotism, relaxation, and theconcerted use of the imagination and will.Chapter Seven: Alchemical Symbolism and the Aura explores the richsymbology that fills the pages of alchemical treatises such as The True Book ofSynesius. Implications of alchemical color symbolism and the color attributionsof the planets are examined with special regard to how these symbols can beused to effect change within the human aura.Chapter Eight: In Conclusion summarizes Regardie’s analysis of all thepreceding chapters in plain language, stripped of its alchemical symbolism andmetaphor.The sections that follow contain elements that we have added to supplementRegardie’s text of Gold, beginning with Appendix I: The Art of True Healing.In chapter six, Regardie mentions a meditative method that he had developedfor the control and transmission of vital life force—a therapeutic technique thatcould be utilized for healing oneself as well as others. Regardie published thisin 1937 in a little book called The Art of True Healing: A Treatise on theMechanism of Prayer, and the Operation of the Law of Attraction in Nature.10This text provides a practical application of the principles discussed in Gold,particularly with regard to the conscious manipulation of the Secret Fire inspiritual alchemy. Therefore, it seemed appropriate to add this paper as anappendix to the present book. The version of The Art of True Healing providedhere is taken straight from the author’s personal copy, signed “I Regardie,advance copy, April 1st, 1937. 11 am,” complete with Regardie’s owncorrections penciled in the margins. It is also much shorter than later versionsof this paper. Nevertheless, Regardie’s ingenuity shines through even in thisearly version.The Art of True Healing provides readers with a healing ritual based on theMiddle Pillar exercise, a Golden Dawn method for charging energy centerswithin the aura. Regardie, more than any other individual, saw the vast"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"potential of the Middle Pillar exercise that was given, albeit in an incompleteform, in the papers of the Stella Matutina. He realized that this simple ritualcould be adapted for a variety of exercises with different levels of complexityand purpose, and consequently provided an outline of his therapeutic techniquein The Art of True Healing. It is through rituals and exercises like this thatstudents can accomplish the internal work of spiritual alchemy.In Appendix II: Correspondences for Healing Rituals, we provide lists ofQabalistic, elemental, planetary, and zodiacal attributions that can be employedby readers who wish to use Regardie’s ritual technique from appendix I. Abasic Middle Pillar exercise and sample healing ritual is given. This can easilybe adapted for many different therapeutic purposes.The latter portion of this book contains a glossary, bibliography, and index.Contemplation of alchemical symbolism—conscious as well as subconscious—is meant to captivate and inspire the student on many levels. This emblematiclanguage speaks directly to the human soul on the true nature of the alchemist’s“gold.” However, eternal wisdom remains dormant in humanity so long as amundane state of ignorance and superficiality exists. Inner alchemy is theuncovering of this interior wisdom and the removal of obstacles between thehuman mind and its intrinsically pure divine source. Throughout his lifetime,Israel Regardie did much to remove blinds and obstacles to students’understanding of important spiritual truths. His work in Gold helps to furtherthis objective in no small way.Gold is an important addition to the collective corpus of the alchemical arts.This is because the science of alchemy cannot be adequately understood if thereader approaches it from one perspective only. It is no simple thing, but rathera coherent, holistic system, similar to Qabalah or astrology. The student ofQabalah cannot hope to grasp the magnitude of that mystical tradition bystudying the Hebrew alphabet without internalizing the Sephiroth of the Tree ofLife. Similarly, one cannot understand astrology by mechanically delineating azodiacal chart without understanding the philosophical ideas that help toexplain the spiritual milestones of human life. The same is true of alchemy. Tounderstand alchemy correctly, the practitioner cannot just do laboratory work"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"or only perform the exercises of spiritual alchemy—the true alchemist must doboth. This is why alchemy stands beside Qabalah and astrology as one of thefoundational pillars of Hermetic philosophy.The laboratory approach can no longer be ignored by the knowledgeablereader, and so the works of modern alchemists such as Frater Albertus, MarkStavish, and Robert Allen Bartlett must be consulted if one is to have any hopeof attaining a full comprehension of the matter. However, Mary Anne Atwood’sA Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery and Herbert Silberer’sProblems of Mysticism and Its Symbolism should also be consulted, becausethey provided crucial early links in the study of dream and myth interpretationof alchemical symbolism. Works such as these foreshadowed Carl Jung’sbreakthrough psychological viewpoint as set forth in his work Psychology andAlchemy. And it was Atwood’s text, along with the Jungian approach, thatinspired Israel Regardie to pen first The Philosopher’s Stone and then Gold.Regardie’s experience as a practicing Golden Dawn magician andpsychotherapist provided him with a unique perspective on the symbolism andlanguage of the spagyric art. Gold provides readers first and foremost with amagical interpretation of alchemy—a perspective that is based on Regardie’sstudy of Qabalah and magical imagery; the powers of the human mind andpsychic vitality; visualization and prayer; color and planetary magic; yoga andzen; magnetism and the manipulation of the vital life force; the focused use ofhuman willpower and imagination; and the mystical goal of the Great Work ofalchemy—often referred to as enlightenment, illumination, or union with God.It would indeed be difficult to have a complete and thorough understanding ofalchemy without exploring Regardie’s unparalleled insights as set forth inGold.The history of literature abounds with tales of forgotten writings —texts lostto the ages through fateful mistakes, deliberate destruction, or simplecarelessness. Israel Regardie’s writings played a central role in shapingmodern ceremonial magic and establishing the connections between magic,alchemy, and psychology.

His environment was the lurid world ofGnosticism and Neo-Platonism. Various forms of mystical thought, someoutrageous in the fantastic proportions they reached, were openly flourishing inthe intellectual center of the Western world of that day, Alexandria. It was about311 B.C. that there Alexander the Great had founded his colony. Almostimmediately the little community had established a Ptolemaic school ofphilosophy where the prevailing ideas, modified by later influences, wereessentially Platonic and Aristotelian."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"From her founding, the city had been the heir and protector of a sternphilosophy. Gradually she had become rich and commercial, very worldly andvery attractive. Because of her wisely chosen situation on the coast and becauseof the canal system by which the produce of Upper Egypt found an outlet to thesea, the city became very significant and important. That is, she developed intothe one port through which flowed the riches of the Mediterranean cities, ofIndia, and of the fertile granary of the Nile Valley. Each consignmentcontributed its toll in commissions and duties to her merchant princes and to thecity government. In consequence, wealth had so accumulated there that, withinone or two hundred years after the date of her foundation, there had arisenalready many famous buildings, including the celebrated library.She was a cosmopolitan city. We would have found there many racialdivisions, with many and diverse interests. A large native population crowdedcertain districts—a native population which still held to the world of theancient Egyptian gods and beliefs. In the northeast, another section was set offas the Jewish quarter, where we would have seen a motley crowd of Hebrewtraders and merchants and scholars. An unyielding Jehovistic faith struggledwith an advancing world for right of continuance. From the date of themartyrdom of St. Mark, the Christian infiltration had been making graduallyincreasing progress both from the numerical and social points of view. Greeks,Jews, Egyptians and the Christians—each perhaps differing from the other inmany ways, with nevertheless an agreement in one particular at least. Theyagreed on the religious particular of the existence of God. Though here, even inthis single agreement, were several important theological differences based onracial temperament and varying psychological needs.The craze of the time, possibly a deep and urgent psychological necessity inview of the insecure nature of social and political life, comparable in manyways to the present day, was a syncretism. The Pauline attempt of some threehundred years earlier to wed Greek thought to Jewish Messianism by means ofan intellectual or spiritual vision is a particular instance of that tendency.Everywhere, and on every hand, people were extravagantly undertakingsynthetical combinations of all the existent religions, cults, and philosophies. It"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"was a mad confused world this, just prior to the victory of Church authorityover independent inspiration and religious experience in anticipation of thecomplete extinction of intellectual effort and spiritual initiative in the DarkAges.Synesius was educated in all that characterized Neo-Platonism. It is evidentthat some of his writings, the essay De Insomniis, for example, wereprofoundly influenced by Plotinus, Later, however, he evolved to the viewpointthat his personal pagan philosophy was not necessarily incompatible withChristianity. He was a man of great determination and many talents with arobust common sense. Synesius was not in reality a mystic, even although astrain of mysticism peers out here and there from his writing. Historically heappears to us rather as of a very positive extraverted character. The role ofphilosopher was one which, perhaps in moments of over-ambition andaspiration, he had imposed upon himself, guided more by personal predilectionthan by inherent capacity. It is difficult to imagine that it was one assigned tohim by nature. Such a role, it is evident to us now, rested upon a very fragileand shallow foundation. As a bishop, he was militant, and a deep patriot. Buthe was neither a profound nor an original thinker, as is evidenced by his essaysand letters. The volume The Essays and Hymns of Synesius, edited andintroduced by A. Fitzgerald and published by the Oxford University Press, isample proof of this assumption. He was, in fact, something of a dilettante, aman moderately well-versed in the culture of his age. The charm of his writingrests in the intimate contact and sympathy that his writings establish with thereader, rather than in any spontaneity or originality of thought or expression.I have written thus far about Synesius and his milieu to convey some slightpicture of the bishop of Ptolemais who is supposed to have been the author ofthis text. Quite apart from the intrinsic evidence of the writing which I proposeto examine soon, it is more or less obvious that Synesius of Cyrene, a Christianabbot during the fourth century, could not have been its author. The nature of hisvery few extant writings as evidenced by the volumes I have cited above,depict him as of another nature than a writer on alchemy. Scholarship maintainsthat whilst he occasionally wrote in a mystical vein he himself was no mystic."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"And this is not difficult to understand. A more or less educated man of todaywould unwittingly express himself, should he essay expression in writing, in thescientific and conventional clichés of our time. This would not necessarilyindicate that this person was a scientist—a logical empiricist. In such of hisliterary output as we possess, we clearly may detect the strains of Platonismand Neo-Platonism in addition to the pre-dominant Christian feeling. He wassimply expressing himself in the ideology and intellectual clichés of his age.But that is to say quite another thing than that such a man could have beencapable of writing alchemical obscurities.Yet at the same time, another viewpoint is most certainly not impossible. I donot wish to be a partisan. A critic, above all, must be impartial, weighing suchevidence, large or otherwise, as makes its way into his ken. We know that thejargon of alchemy is one that has persisted more or less in the same basic formthroughout the centuries. Greek alchemy displays fairly much the samecharacteristics as later European alchemy. Chinese texts, au fond, are verysimilar to those of Byzantium and of India, of Persia and Arabia. It is not at allimpossible that in Alexandria at Synesius’ day were alchemists and alchemicalwriters. It is not even impossible, though this we do not definitely know, that hehimself had met them and had been influenced by them. In fact, it is highlyprobable that he did. But speculation will tell us nothing of this, and I must notforce the issue. It simply makes it very difficult to determine the author of thetext, if such determination is considered important.The entire evidence presented makes me feel dubious in accepting Synesiusas the author of The True Book. Actually, the message conveyed by the titleitself—that it is the true book of the abbot, having been taken or stolen out ofthe Emperor’s library—by the mere fact of its insistence arouses suspicion thatall is not well. The emphasis, it seems to me on psychological grounds, isslightly overdone. It is as though a psychotic with marked paranoic symptomswere to walk into a psychiatric consulting room and say, without prompting orjustification, “Oh no; I was not really being followed here. I don’t actuallybelieve I am being spied upon.” Suspicion would immediately be aroused bysuch spontaneous and uninvited denial. You would wonder why it was"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"necessary to give assurance in advance of the absence of paranoicsymptomatology. Likewise here. The title alone would have been enough—sufficiently interesting or convincing by itself—without having had to add that ithad been taken from the Emperor’s library.There are, furthermore, several references to alchemical authorities of a muchlater age. A former colleague of mine, a scholar with a profound and unrivalledknowledge of alchemical literature and history, does not believe however thatsuch references necessarily prove the spurious nature of the text. It is hiscontention that these alchemical manuscripts may have been privatelydistributed and circulated for generations. It may well have been that someover-zealous owner of the text in, let us say, the fourteenth century, interpolatedquotations from alchemical writings of his day in order to buttress up his ownbelief in the art. In so doing, he failed to recognize that he had almostcompletely ruined an authentic text of an earlier age.Be that as it may, the treatise mentions Geber twice, and Alphidius once. Thedate of Geber, the Arabian prince alchemist, is difficult to place. It rangesanywhere from the sixth to the tenth century. We may therefore hazard a safeguess in the assumption that he lived about the eighth century. Alphidius datesconsiderably later. If we except the theory that there may have been an originalGreek manuscript written by the abbot Synesius in which several centuriesafterwards interpolations were inserted—and this of course may never beproved—then we are obliged to consider The True Book of the LearnedSynesius as having an origin at the earliest in the thirteenth century, or it may bea little later. Some may feel inclined to posit the theory that Synesius was giftedwith prevision.Who the author of this text was, we do not really know. His modesty inbestowing the fruits of his pen and the cloak of his erudition on a Neo-Platonicabbot defeats us in our search into origins. But whoever he was, he must havefelt that the system he was attempting to delineate had certain points of contactwith that espoused by Synesius. Otherwise, why should he have taken thetrouble to mention Synesius by name? Why not Plotinus or Iamblichus—oranyone of the host of celebrities who, so far as the authority of mere name"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"values is concerned, might have answered to his purpose equally? Possibly hisname was chosen to render the work more acceptable to those of the Christianfaith. Nevertheless, when attempting to widen our understanding of this treatise,we must remember this allusion to the doctrines of Neo-Platonism, where weare confronted with fundamental religious doctrines.So far as the actual text and its bibliography is concerned, there is little tosay. In the year 1678, the first English edition was published in London, as maybe seen by the imprint on the title page reproduced herein. (See illustration onpage 30.) The True Book of Synesius, in that edition, was inconspicuouslytucked away at the back of a much larger and better known alchemical treatiseby Basil Valentine, The Triumphal Chariot of Antimony with annotations byTheodore Kirkringius, M.D. Prior to this, the most easily accessible copy of thetext was a Latin version, one edition of which was published from Amsterdamin 1671. The French edition appeared in Paris in the year 1612, in a volumeentitled Traites de la Philosophie, etc.Whether or not there was a Greek original from which the Latin and Frencheditions were rendered is open to question. There is so little trustworthyevidence of any kind that one hesitates to express any opinion. For sooner orlater, some of the larger libraries in Europe, in which ancient manuscripts haveresided for long centuries without being pored over and disturbed byinquisitive minds and roaming hands, may be opened to research andinvestigation, if they are not previously destroyed by vandals. Possibly thensome sort of original text may come to light. Meanwhile I am inclined to doubtthat there is an original Greek text, for the style and tenor betray quite a lateperiod of expression.So far as I personally am concerned, however, it does not matter a rap whoreally wrote the book. This matter may be left to scholars of the future todecide. Why should we be bothered about abstract problems of this type? WhatI am interested in, however, is a purely practical consideration. That is to say,is there anything in this text which is of any importance to us? I claim there is.I may as well take my stand here at the outset, and express my fundamentalplatform. It is my contention that alchemical writing is of a peculiar type. It"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"belongs to that vast realm of expression which has a close kinship withmythology, religion, poetry and dream. In a word, it is material that has issuedfrom the hidden depths of man’s unconscious psyche. Not only so, but I believethat we can learn a very great deal from it. The alchemists have much to giveus. If we are humble and receptive, there is much that we may obtain—information by way of a psychological technique of psychic integration andillumination that make our modern therapeutic systems look like the dabblingsof triflers and dilettante. So serious am I in this belief, and so convinced am Ifrom prolonged investigation of this branch of knowledge and its applicationabove all to my own psychological practice, that I propose to examine this textof Synesius in terms of the general principles underlying its assumptions.Whether Synesius wrote it or not is unimportant. What Synesius or the realauthor has said, that for me is significant. It is this inner kernel of value that Ihave always sought irrespective of where it was that the search has led me.And here in The True Book there are discoveries to be made.

Andthe advantage therefore which is in this Art, lies in the Mercury, Sun and Moon.Diomedes saith, make use of such a matter as to which thou must not introduceany strange thing, neither pouder nor water, for that several things do notimprove our Stone, and thereby he sufficiently instructs him, who understandshim, that the tincture of our Stone is not drawn from any thing but the Mercuryof the Philosophers, which is their principle, their root, and their great Tree,sprouting forth into boughs and branches."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The First OperationSublimationIt is not Vulgar but Philosophical whereby we take away from the Stonewhatever is superfluous, which, in effect is nothing else, but the elevation of thenot-fixed part by fume and vapor, for the fixed part should remain in the bottom,nor would we that one should be separated from the other, but that they remainand be fixed together.

And this blacknessappears sometimes in forty dayes, more or less, according to the quantity of thematter, and the industry of the Operator, which contributes much to theseparation of the said Blackness.

I tell thee that this must be done so often, that there shall remainnothing but the Murc. For this distillation there is no time limited, but it is donesooner or later according to the greater or lesser quantity of the water,proportionably to the quantity of the fire.

To make white."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"ICHAPTER ONEALCHEMY AND PSYCHOLOGYn the Middle Ages, alchemy was a body of knowledge accorded the utmostrespect and veneration. It had penetrated every form of learning. Before itsshrine the savants of philosophy and theology paid humble homage. Nowadaysthe various histories of chemistry which are considered authoritative lookaskance at the noble parent of their science. It is an object of derision andcontempt. Few modern historians, however, realize that it is not from alchemyproper that the chemical art was derived. Rather it was from the mistakenefforts of uninitiated operators—those who despite clear instruction, workedwith actual vulgar materials. These, came derisively to be known as thePuffers. It is from these pseudo-alchemists, and not from the accreditedphilosophical authorities, that we have inherited the earliest chemicaldiscoveries.To this day, the real nature of alchemy—or rather an intelligible interpretationof alchemical texts—remains a dark mystery to academic scholarship. It isclaimed by some that a crude and archaic form of chemical practice and metalworking indubitably underlies these texts. And to understand them, we musttherefore apply a primitive chemical and scientific interpretation. In a verypenetrating and erudite work entitled Alchemy, Child of Greek Philosophy, theauthor, Arthur John Hopkins, ventures a theory and posits statements which,whilst in harmony with the currently accepted ideas on the subject, are in myestimation erroneous. He says, “But because the true theory of alchemy, theoriginal Egyptian theory, was no longer understood, the writers of WesternEurope were never able to carry out in practice the promises expressed in theirbooks. The actual gold which was looked for was never produced.” 12Though it is not my intention to labor upon the idea of a physicaltransmutation of metals, since that is a subject calling for special treatment byspecialists, nevertheless the issue raised here requires some little discussion."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The contention is that the evidence we have from the past is not onlyuntrustworthy but that the alchemists themselves were knaves and liars. Itsuggests that the testimony of these alchemists that actually they did producegold, is false testimony. The assumption, I contend, is false. Its psychology isundoubtedly fallacious. The factor involved in so sweeping a statement is dueno doubt not only to the widespread extraverted attitude of the day, but to thesense of antagonism experienced by our modern scientists to the means bywhich the alchemists are said to have produced that gold. No matter howproduced, and regardless of the unacceptableness or the repugnance of thetransmuting mechanism to us today, the fact is that Flamel, Van Helmont,Sendivogius, and many another claimed not only to have produced goldartificially but to have had it tested and accepted as currency. We haveevidence as valid as any of that of past times that this gold was tried thoroughlyby all the acid tests of the jewelers. There was no question merely of tinting orof a surface plating of a metal to suggest solid gold, as Hopkins suggests.Chemical tests had already been sufficiently well developed for the goldsmithsto have seen through so superficial a metallurgical artifice.Hopkins’ theory is that originally alchemy grew out of a simple artisanship.Here he repeats the celebrated French scholar Berthelot, and it is obvious thatArthur Edward Waite, who propounds a similar view in The Secret Traditionin Alchemy,13 derives his conclusions from the same source. In Egypt, where theart is said to have had its inception, the colors of nature were drab, and meagre.The sun, hot and glaring and cruel, burned the life and color out of thevegetation, and the environment in consequence appeared but dull andmonotonous and uninteresting. Sand and desert stretched for miles about theEgyptian cities. As a result, the people were moved to improve upon nature.This they did by employing in their building operations stones and bricks ofdifferent colors and textures in order to relieve the wide neutrality and boringmonotony about them. Also they painted designs and pictures of bright andvaried hue in their interiors, as compensation for the drabness and lifelessappearance of nature in which they lived."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"They loved clothes colored with rich bright dyes, and the so-called “royalpurple” intrigued them enormously. Theirs was a distinct leaning towardsjewelry. Bracelets and necklaces and rings of gold and silver, exquisitelyworked and chased, were especially desirable. Since gold and silver, preciousmetals, were beyond the reach of the simple inhabitant of those days, the desirefor ornamentation gave impetus to the alloying of metals. These were cunninglymixed and tinted by a bronzing surface treatment so as to give the appearance ofthe “genuine article.” “The first appearance of these colored metals on themarket,” suggests Hopkins, “must have come as a novelty and created a demandvery encouraging to the manufacturer.” 14At the beginning therefore there was apparently no deliberate deception ordisgrace involved in the practice of tinting metals. Nevertheless it was fromthis need to give cheap and tawdry baubles to the common people that arosealchemy with its aspiration towards the real transmutation of metals.Such a view, while no doubt a correct one in the main, is faulty in at least oneparticular. It takes no cognizance of the view that long prior to such acommercial exploitation of alloyed metals, was a long tradition of mystical andhigh religious thought. To ignore this is at once to knock away the foundationsfrom under one’s feet. And without such a realization all one’s speculationspartake of modernity in its worst sense—of theories deprived of all substance,suspended in mid-air, timeless because not grounded in our history andintellectual evolution. Earlier in his work, Hopkins had mentioned theestablished fact that for at least a couple of thousand years before the Christianera, the Egyptians had evolved a very profound religious culture. This wascentered about Osiris, the resurrection God. By the psychological mechanism ofportmanteau symbolism, displacement and condensation—mechanism soclearly operating in those spontaneous irruptions of psychic activity, dreamsand fantasies, mechanisms with which the genius of Freud has familiarized us—he became associated with the solar Gods Ra and Khephra. Consequently theredeveloped too the association with yellow, the physical golden color of the sun.Hence to become Osiris by the various religious means of the ancientEgyptians, implied a species of union or identification with the Sun, or that"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"ultimate reality of life implied by the Sun, the source of light and life and virtue.And it is evident that to a religious people, the body-consciousness with itsdown-tending desires and predilections came to be symbolized as dark, heavy,and leaden in nature. The spirit represented by the Sun and by Osiris wasconsidered as light, activity, and the purest gold. It was the lead consciousnessof which they wished to be relieved, with its burden of guilt, fear and anxiety. Itwas this that they wished to open up, and thus transmute, to the pure gold of theheavenly Osiris, the Redeemer and Mediator. From this elementary andprimitive reasoning the sacerdotal classes had developed an imposingsuperstructure of mystical realization. It is evident that the priests, who weknow had already evolved a complex spiritual scheme, noble and fine in manyways, would have been able to develop a psychological technique wherebysuch a transmutation from the lead of corruption to the gold of psychicincorruptibility could be accomplished."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"OsirisI believe that the Hopkins or generally accepted scientific view is certainlyvalid in respect of a certain class of texts. Alchemy has of course severalplanes of interpretation, and an equal number of classes of texts. Neverthelesshis view is not one that can be over-zealously or too widely applied. Thepresent text, for example, is a case in point. No doubt it is spurious in the sensethat The True Book of the Learned Synesius cannot be the work of Synesius the"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"abbot of Ptolemais in the fourth century. It must therefore be considered amediaeval forgery. On the other hand it is typical of a distinct class ofalchemical literature. The very definitions employed—and I must mention thefact that this work is famous for its classical and almost perfect definitions—lead one to suppose that another level of interpretation must be sought.Excluding the idea that this particular book is an early chemical text-book, asI maintain we are forced to exclude, then we are confronted by the problem asto what other direction we may turn for a solution. I may say briefly here thatthere are several other interpretations possible. There is the religious or moralviewpoint, and the mystical and occult. Naturally each of these exegeticalapproaches applies its own norm of interpretation to certain parts of certaintexts to confirm its own particular hypothesis.Since the advent of modern psychological knowledge, with particularreference to the clinical findings of those great pioneers Sigmund Freud and C.G. Jung, we have been given a key to the understanding of myths, epics, legendsand dreams of every kind, whether racial or individual. These findings are sotremendous in implication that to ignore them would be unwise—even stupid. Itis to this branch of scientific research that we must first turn in seeking anelucidation of the enigmas and obscurities of the alchemical works. Since these,like dreams and myths, issue from the dark submerged levels of the humanpsyche, and inasmuch as they do not seem to respond to any of the ordinaryinterpretations along scientific mechanistic lines, then we are forced to turn thepsychological key. And the lock opens!Because they were humanly penned, these obscurities must have somemeaning in terms of human consciousness. Everything humanly created hasmeaning and significance of some kind. Even nonsense has some significance inthat it is an outpouring of a particular human mind. We have only to discover thehidden motive of that mind, and the nonsense at once becomes intelligible. I amconvinced that the attempt to employ the psychological key to these darkmysteries of alchemy will yield significant material and ideas. A technique isyielded, moreover, which indicates that these early writers whoever they mayhave been, so far from having been lost in a meaningless maze of gibberish, as"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"most modern critics unjustifiably have come to think, knew very well what theywere writing. And that, moreover, they possessed a very profound andextensive knowledge of the deeps and intricacies of the various levels of man’sown mental, moral and spiritual nature. This knowledge I believe to have somevalue even for us today.Such a point of view is imperative. Not only is it so for the reasons I havestated, but because we find it infuriating and injurious to our sense of self-esteem to be baffled by the intellectual or literary expression of our fellows. Icontend this must be true for several reasons. Even if we assume that thisespecial text is spurious and could never have been penned in the earlycenturies of the Christian era, yet the mere fact that some ten centuries later itsactual composer did attribute it to Synesius must have some particular meaning,some psychic significance of no little import.Synesius, as we know, was a Neo-Platonist who converted to Christianity,becoming eventually a pillar of the Church. It was his belief that Paganism andthe newer dispensation, so far from being antagonistic, had a very great deal incommon one with another. He held that they should unite to form a singlereligious and philosophical unit. Accordingly, in the mere accident ofattribution alone I am inclined to seek a spiritual or philosophical signification.I suggest the text must be interpreted on a high philosophical or mystical level,using the symbolism and technique of Analytical Psychology as the meanswhereby the quasi-religious or philosophical interpretations may be renderedacceptable to modern thought and scholarship. That some spiritual or inwardand not a chemical interpretation is imperative is borne in upon us by one ortwo of the definitions provided in the text itself.For example, the first sentence of the second section reads: “My son, it isnecessary that thou work with the Mercury of the Philosophers and the Wise,which is not the Vulgar, nor hath anything of the Vulgar.”Here is a direct injunction not to stoop down into the mineral world. How, inview of such a caution, could one confuse metallurgical processes with those ofphilosophy? What is the Mercury of the wise? Our text suggests the answer. “Itis the first Matter, the Soul of the World.” At once we are plunged into the"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"deeps of early philosophy and religion, a late reflection of Platonic speculation.According to archaic philosophy, the Soul of the World is the one reality. It isthe ideal world, of which the actual physical world susceptible to the physicalsenses is the negation or phenomenon. Likewise it is considered as anomnipresent life principle, pulsating throughout all space, and permeating everyliving thing. It is life itself, and without it no thing could be. Life andconsciousness, in mystical philosophy throughout the ages, are identical. Wherethe one is, there may we find the other. Hence to work with the Mercury of thePhilosophers is to confine one’s labors metaphysically to the ever-present spiritof life, ubiquitous and infinite, pulsing in the core of the human heart.Though the human psyche is a whole or unity, it has its own variouscompartments or functions which roughly we may designate as Conscious andUnconscious. That is to say, that certain of our thinking processes areconsciously performed, whilst at the same time there is a vast field ofcerebration and psychic activity of which normally we have not the vaguestawareness. The appearance of dream and fantasy is eloquent proof of thisunconscious activity.The enormously wide field of hypnotic experiment, unacceptable though itmay be to some who prefer the comfort of dogmatic theories to actualindisputable facts, stands as eloquent proof of the concept of the Unconsciousand unconscious psychic activity. Modern psychology and psychologicaltechnique owe their very existence to Mesmer and to the pioneer work of greathypnotists such as Janet, Charcot, Bernheim and Liébault. These labored withsuggestion therapy and trance-states to indicate that the individual in his wakingstate may be influenced by a multitude of ideas and feelings, of the existence ofwhich he has not the least conscious awareness whatsoever. For example, Dr. J.Milne Bramwell, possibly the greatest living authority on hypnotism, records avast number of Experiments that he made. A series of them were with a Miss D.She was, he says, a very ordinary girl of board school education.15 Herarithmetical powers were in keeping with this. She could do ordinary examplesin multiplication and subtraction only if permitted to do them with pencil and"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"paper. Mental arithmetic was beyond her. There was no particular aptitude forappreciating the passage of time.On one particular occasion she was placed deeply under hypnosis at 3:55p.m. Dr. Bramwell gave the suggestion that at the expiration of 5 hours and 20minutes after she awoke she was to make a cross on a piece of paper and towrite down the time she believed it to be. At about 9:15 the mother of the girlnoticed that Miss D. was restless. Five minutes later the girl wrote rapidly on apiece of paper “20 minutes past 9.” 16 The French psychologist Delboeuf madeinnumerable similar experiments to this one many years before with similarsatisfactory results.17These and a host of like experiments seem to indicate that the subliminalconsciousness or the Unconscious, or any other name that you may prefer to usefor this dark hidden side of one’s being, possesses a remarkable time sense. Orelse that it can calculate and function totally in independence of whatconsciously we think and do.If suggestions implanted in the mind from without may so affect theindividual, may it not be also that from within the psyche there may be evolveda certain content the effect of which may not be too dissimilar to post-hypnoticsuggestions? It is on this hypothesis that Freud and others have labored at greatlength. And it is this hypothesis that they have proved.Just as human physiology is based upon universal principles, so also it seemsis human psychology. In the collective universal sense, we are confronted thenwith what Plato would have called the world of Ideas, and with what the veryeminent psychologist C. G. Jung has chosen to call the Collective Unconscious.This postulate is not a matter of speculation nor a necessity imposed upon ourthinking by any philosophical dialectic. It is a matter of everyday clinicalexperience. Symbols and ideas and inspirations charged with exuberance andvitality appear constantly in dreams, and influence the personality in a profoundand lasting way. When all the superfluities and personal aspects are explainedor analyzed away, these are seen to belong wholly or in part to thatmythological world in which the ancients lived. This same world of theUnconscious still lives in each one of us, albeit deeply buried. It is the world of"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"universals which Jung has named the Collective Unconscious—that which allmen have in common and share, unknown to themselves, with each other. Hedefines it more particularly in these terms: “As a common human heritage ittranscends all differences of culture and consciousness and does not consistmerely of contents capable of becoming conscious, but of latent dispositionstowards identical reactions. Thus the fact of the collective unconscious issimply the psychic expression of brain-structure irrespective of all racialdifferences. By its means can be explained the analogy, going even as far asidentity, between various myth-themes and symbols, and the possibility ofhuman understanding in general. The various lines of psychic development startfrom one common stock whose roots reach back into the past. Here too lies thepsychological parallelism with animals.” 18 It is this world too, or thispsychological principle, which Synesius or our mediaeval forger has termedthe Mercury of the Wise, or the Soul of the World.Moreover, this same text gives us such a definition of the alchemical art as toindicate beyond the possibility of doubt that no chemical interpretation can besought. Assuming the reality or tangibility of the First homogeneous Matterwhich is to be coagulated after purification into the so-called Philosopher’sStone, what then is the object of alchemy? “Consider what Geber sayes,”counsels our text, “that our Art consists not in the multitude of several things,because the Mercury is but one only thing, that is to say, one only stone whereinconsists the whole Magistery; to which thou shalt not add any strange thing,save that in the preparation thereof thou shalt take away from it whatsoever issuperfluous, by reason that in this matter, all things requisite to this Art arecontained.” 19The philosophical meaning is indisputable. Since all particulars spring from,or are contained in the Universals, or since the physical world is a falling awayfrom the reality of God but is nevertheless contained in God, all we have to dois to eliminate the superfluities, the unrealities, in order to become aware ofReality. Looking at it again from another viewpoint, the sole object required bythe art is the latent root of consciousness, using this term in its widest sense asthe all-inclusive Self, and this is possessed by every man and woman alike."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Therein are contained in potentiality all the factors and instruments necessary toperfection. Furthermore, Synesius says, “Know, that the Quintessence and thehidden thing of our stone is nothing else than our viscous, celestial and glorioussoul drawn by our magistery out of its mine.”In modern clinical psychology, if the analysand would recover his mental andphysical well-being and live healthily and sanely, the deeper levels of his ownbeing must be recognized and expressed. Thus the value of attention to dreams,which are the spontaneous activities and workings of the unconscious aspect ofthe psyche. To live wholly and completely we must take cognizance of theUnconscious, and admit of the validity of its existence together with the rationalsuperficial side of us. We must accept the emotional and feeling side of us aswell. It is this part of us which modern life tends to make us repress, inhibit andforget from childhood on. But this cannot be. It is an unrighteous condition ofthings. For our very being is then disrupted and torn too terribly asunder bysuch a deliberate denial to be endured. Our lives become sterile andinsignificant. All ease and meaning and beauty in life vanish in the samemeasure as integrity is lost. And this psychic affliction is responsible for thevast increase today of ill-health and neurotic manifestation, both physical andmental.By resurrecting this shadow side of us—which alas it seems to have becomewhen actually it is the Light world of surpassing brilliance and divine beauty—and letting our smaller selves, our superficial egos, be immersed or baptized inthat mystical sea of the Wise, then are we restored and made whole. Such is theelixir of life—the rediscovery of the operation of natural law in the innerspiritual world, the recovery of a hitherto lost part of ourselves. It consists inthe “extraction of our celestial and glorious soul from its mine.” That is theterminology of Synesius. Should we attempt a translation of the “glorious andviscous soul” that he speaks of into the terminology of the Jungian psychologywe have more than interesting parallels. In Jung’s book Modern Man in Searchof a Soul there is a very important and significant essay “Postulates ofAnalytical Psychology.” In that essay he makes some statements about theUnconscious which, in time to come, may be considered as classical"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"definitions. For my purpose here, they are illuminating, giving us some idea ofwhat it is that we are to excavate from our alchemical mine. In that book, Jungwrites: “While consciousness is intensive and concentrated, it is transient andis directed upon the immediate field of attention; moreover, it has access onlyto material that represents one individual’s experience, stretching over a fewdecades ... It (the Unconscious) is not as concentrated and intensive, but shadesoff into obscurity; it is highly extensive and can juxtapose the mostheterogeneous elements in the most paradoxical way. More than this, itcontains, besides an indeterminable number of subliminal perceptions, animmense fund of accumulated inheritance-factors left by one generation of menafter another, whose mere existence marks a step in the differentiation of thespecies. If it were permissible to personify the Unconscious, we might call it acollective human being combining the characteristics of both sexes,transcending youth and age, birth and death, and, from having at his command ahuman experience of one or two million years, almost immortal.” 20To have discovered a “being” such as this within one’s heart would be anevent of supreme and paramount significance in any individual’s life. It is aconcept enough to inspire us with an entirely new vision of existence. It is avision of the whole of the universe, making possible a full and unconditionedacceptance of, and compliance with, the eternal laws of life which after all arethe laws of the Unconscious. This is in its widest sense the Philosopher’sStone. Man is glorified by the integration of the personality into one entire unitduring some psychic process in which the ego gradually becomes reconciled toand united with its dynamic stem and root, the Unconscious or the Soul of theWorld. And his every psychic principle, permeated anew with life and vitality,perfected through free and complete expression of its own innate superiorwisdom, is made golden and glowing like some rare psychic jewel. Themagnetic emanations so to speak, issuing from such an individual, becomepurified and engender themselves anew. Their colors, to the sensitive able tofeel and perceive them, become alive and flashing, capable of exertingpowerful effects on whomsoever and whatsoever is brought into vital contactwith them."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"It is this conception, briefly, rather than chemistry, which underlies, I think,the willful deliberate obscurantism of alchemy.[contents]12.

I feel it would be wiser for the reader to work out his own lengthyreactions to its stimulus. But I should like to indicate in a slightly fuller fashioncertain of the ideas dominating the philosophy and practice of alchemy.Principal amongst these, and common to the whole range of alchemicalliterature, regardless of the age or clime in which that literature first appeared,is the belief in some universal agent, some homogeneous medium into which theego, the unpurified Stone, is to be dissolved and then reconstructed accordingto another pattern. In the Aurea Catena Homeri 21 it is said, “A medium of unionis wanting. They (the students) should look for such a medium. One metal doesnot and cannot enter into a radical union with another without their medium ofunion; this medium they may have lost at the melting furnace, near the mines. Gothere and look for it, or take its like.” 22Ingenuity of the most fertile kind has been exercised throughout the ages innaming this medium in such a guise that it shall not be recognizable save tothose whose intellectual and spiritual gifts have elevated them above the herd.Fantastic and arbitrary some of the definitions may seem to have been, butmeditation will reveal to the enquiring mind that reality to which they point. Ipropose dilating upon this topic more fully a little further on. As Synesius saysof the alchemists of all time, and their spagyric expositions: “And though theyare different in their expressions, yet are they not in any way discordant onefrom another, but ayming all at one end, and speaking of the same thing, theyhave thought fit (above all the rest) to name the proper Agent by a term, strange,nay sometimes contrary to its nature and qualities.” 23"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The True Book further states: “My Son, it is necessary that thou work with theMercury of the Philosophers and the Wise, which is not the Vulgar, nor hathany thing of the Vulgar, but, according to them, is the First Matter, the Soul ofthe World, the cold element, the blessed Water, the Water of the Wise, theVenemous Water, the most sharp Vinegar, the water of celestial grace, theVirgin Milk, our mineral and corporeal Mercury.” 24With this clue provided by our author almost any true alchemical treatise mayreadily be understood. The basic formula has been defined and we may goforward from the dark towards the light. It is assumed in alchemicalmetaphysics that throughout space there is diffused a universal andhomogeneous sub-stratum of a very subtle, fine and tenuous spiritual principle.“It is not possible for us to make that water by Art, but Nature alone begets it.”25 This must be postulated or experienced before anything else may be done.Some have called it Hyle, others have termed it spirit, and the moderns name itthe Collective Unconscious: and we have already read by what names our texthas so eloquently described it. The entirety of alchemical literature, as I havesaid, is replete with enigmatical descriptions of this ethereal substance, thisuniversally pervasive medium into which they seek to reduce their workingmetals. From this substance, if name it such we must, mind and matter havetheir origin. Or, shall I say, these two extreme functions of the psyche are butopposite poles of its homogeneity, male and female, positive and negative.“Know then, my Son,” asserts Synesius, “that almighty God together with thisUniverse created two Stones, that is to say, the White and the Red, both whichare under one and the same subject.” 26The duality here of the white and the red is similar to the reference on anotherpage of this treatise to the Sun and the Moon. There is the specific caution thatthey are not the Vulgar Gold and Silver nor the Vulgar Sun and Moon. Thislatter is explicable on the ground that the metals and the planets in alchemy areattributed one to another. Not only so but they are frequently usedinterchangeably as surrogate symbols. The caution therefore suggests asubjective transcendental line of psychological enquiry—more along theJungian lines."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"If the luminaries are not the vulgar objective luminaries, then what are they?To answer this, philosophy and religion must be called to our conference.Traditionally, the Sun and consequently Gold, refer, as previously I haveintimated, to the freed human consciousness. Free association on dreammaterial confirms this. The Freudians have a vast series of correspondences orassociations to gold. At first sight these seem entirely opposed to the meaningdilated upon here. Their attitude is to reduce the content of the dreams to basicinfantile experience, or rather to the memory of such experiences. Gold to aninfantile consciousness would refer to its own excreta. For one thing the colorof its faeces would be the determining factor, and for another the idea of value.Sun and MoonValue in faeces, you may ask in amazement? But the child, you mustremember, has a primitive set of values entirely opposed to that of the adult.The child is a defenseless little entity, without means of self-protection or self-assertion. His own body, his activities, and the functional activities of his"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"organism are his only possessions. He has nothing else in the world. These alsoare the sole means of expression of his will, of his feelings. His environmentcontains giants, powerful personalities, mother and father, who more often thannot in the early days fulfill his every wish and whim, but who later create anatmosphere which is in collision with the impulse of the child. Angry andannoyed by the superiors about him, how may he indicate his displeasure?Crying after a while is recognized to be futile. Sometimes it works, sometimesit does not.From a very early age, the child learns of moral values in connection with itsbodily functions. If its bowels move, mother or nurse smiles and says it is agood child. On the other hand, these godlike beings frown severely if thebowels do not operate, and he is a bad child. These are notions which, whilstapparently trivial, are deeply ingrained in us and survive unconsciously in theadult, as everyone acquainted with psychology knows.Likewise the child learns that if the bowels move mother is satisfied andhappy. When stasis occurs, the whole nursery is in a furor, and a very great dealof attention of different kinds is bestowed upon this kingly child. This being so,if the child feels neglected or annoyed or irritated with its parents—as so easilycan happen—what more simple than that he should withhold his excreta, whichclearly have been stamped with importance and great value? These valuablecontents of his bowels are the sole means left of displaying his satisfaction withthe external environment. These are his possessions, the actual withholding ofwhich is employed to procure his own ends. The parents, worried andfrightened by the possibility of serious illness resulting, bestow attention andconcern upon him. Pleased and happy, he gives up his treasure. The movementnot only gives him personal pleasure, but it is certainly indicative of anunderlying sense of treasure, value, and personal possession. Thus goldreceives, later on in life, some of this transferred effect. It is in directassociation with this early primitive treasure of his infancy.But what issues from the bowels has a superior symbolic significance merelyto this. For one thing, the symbolic meaning is more important than the symbol—power and pleasure being the meaning here. And this is certainly what gold"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"does represent. Moreover, the bowel itself is an involuntary muscle or visceraunder the dominion of the old nervous system, the sympathetic. As such itrepresents the mode of activity of the basic factor of the psyche, theUnconscious. This underlies all human activity no matter of what kind. It is tothis stratum of our psychic constitution that constantly we must turn foredification of obscure psychological problems.Thus the freed consciousness which I have mentioned above must refer to onewhich has attempted to enlarge its own horizon by becoming aware of, orincluding within itself, as much as it can of the Unconscious and its continuousactivity. In particular it so refers when the ego has passed through a rigorousdiscipline and training so that exalted it manifests its own innate divine nature.It is masculine and positive, as the Moon and Silver are feminine and passive.The Sun is Father of all, the giver of life and light, warmth and heat, the joy ofall existence. Whereas the Moon reflects the light of the Sun, and is the motherwho bears life or reflects it when once it has been radiated upon her.Astrologically, the Moon and Silver also refer in general terms to theinstinctive and emotional background of man, that foundation of dynamicimpulse upon which his consciousness rests, and from which it has emerged.Hence it is said “our Suns and Moons are in their nature living.” 27 What elsecould they be, then, than living?This idea is fundamental to all archaic systems of thought. Even in theChinese text The Secret of the Golden Flower translated by Richard Wilhelm,we find a similar emphasis. There we find mention of the Yang and Yinprinciples, the two opposite principles inhering within Nature and consequentlyin man. For the laws of the cosmos, whatever their nature, are likewise existentand operative in the human psyche. In his Introduction to the text, Wilhelmwrites: “Yin is shadow, therefore the north side of a mountain and the south sideof a river (because during the day the position of the Sun makes the riverappear dark from the south). Yang in its original form shows flying pennants,and, corresponding to the character yin, is the south side of a mountain and thenorth side of a river. Starting with the meaning of “light” and “dark,” theprinciple was then expanded to all polar opposites, including the sexual."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"However, both yin and yang are only active in the realm of phenomena, and wehave their common origin in an undivided unity, yang as the active principleappearing to condition, and yin as the passive principle seeming to be derivedor conditioned. It is therefore quite clear that a metaphysical dualism is not atthe bottom of these ideas. Less abstract than yin and yang are the concepts ofthe creative and receptive (Ch’ien and K’un) that originate in the Book ofChanges (I Ching) and are symbolized by Heaven and Earth. Through the unionof Heaven and Earth, and through the activity of the two primordial forceswithin this scene (an activity governed by the one primal law Tao) theredevelop the ‘ten thousand things’ that is, the outer world.” 28This latter philosophical tenet of the undivided unity from which yang and yinhave their origin and in which they are grounded is comparable to thealchemical Mercury. In point of fact, it is so defined in the several texts. Fromits homogeneity spring forth the opposites, the white and the red, the Sun andthe Moon, Gold and Silver, “for these two are the world’s eternal way.” 29 TheChinese text itself defines the philosophical Mercury in a way that would not beunacceptable to the European alchemists. “Master Lu Tsu said: That whichexists through itself is called Meaning (Tao). Meaning has neither name norform. It is the one essence, the one primordial spirit. Essence and life cannot beseen. It is contained in the Light of Heaven. The Light of Heaven cannot beseen. It is contained in the two eyes. Today I will be your guide and will firstreveal to you the secret of the Golden Flower of the Great One, and, startingfrom that, I will explain the rest in detail.” 30The Golden Flower is the Chinese glyph for what in Europe has been termedthe Stone of the Philosophers. Interestingly enough there is a set of mythologicalcorrespondences or associations in which the right eye is attributed to the Sunand the left eye to the Moon.The triad of Mercury, Sun and Moon refer to the three major classifications ofthe psyche—a classification which also has been expressed as Mercury, Saltand Sulphur. Mercury is the fundamental consciousness principle itself, thatwhich underlies every psychical activity. It is the very nature and substance ofthe thinking principle, the underlying Self, or, as one Buddhist Sutra puts it, “the"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"essence of mind which is intrinsically pure.” 31 Whilst the Sun and Moonrespectively, as before defined, are two polarities or opposites functioning inthe psyche, the rational thinking activity and the emotional and feeling activity.Let us imagine a piece of string, at each end of which there is a knot. One knotlet us call mind or consciousness, and the other knot the body and the feelingsand emotions associated with the physical aspect and instinctual expression oflife. The entire stretch of string between the two represents the fundamentalstuff, as it were, of which both knots were made, the stuff of whichconsciousness itself is composed, the Mercury of the Wise, that subtle dynamicspiritual link existing between mind and body. It unites them firmly together,enabling the communications or impulses of the one to be impressed upon andconveyed to the other.Moreover, this same dualism or polarity exists and repeats itself in everydepartment or aspect of the psyche. The polarity of the mind expresses itself ina self-conscious thinking ego, some of which is conscious and someunconscious—and a much larger feeling and emotional and instinctual principlewhich likewise is dual in nature and operation. This medium, separating andbinding together the polar functions of the psyche, is also the realm of memory,personal and racial, and of forgotten impression; the seat of enormous vitalityand the life forces impressed with the stamp of an inconceivable antiquity.Since theorize we must here, because only psychological or interior mysticalexperience along the alchemical lines can give final proof, this is the sphere ofwhat present-day psychologists consider to be that deep primitive level ofintelligent being from which the superficial self with all its powers andfaculties has gradually and laboriously emerged in the course of theevolutionary process.In his essay De Insomniis, the Neo-Platonist Synesius makes an incursion intophilosophy, contriving to bridge that chasm stretching between mind and matter.His attempted solution is the postulation of this principle or medium which hechooses to name “phantasia” 32 and which, in his estimation, makes the longsought-for bridge. He claims it belongs exclusively neither to mind nor matter,neither to intellect nor emotion, but mediates each. It is, in his own words, a"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"“no man’s land” obtaining between the unreasoning and reason, the bodilessand the body, and is a boundary common to both. Through it, the divineelements of mind and consciousness are brought into contact with thoseelements furthest removed from them—body, matter and instinct. He definesthis bridge as that “perception of perceptions,” and also as “the first body of thesoul.” 33 Here we have, basically anyway, the concept of a breath or pneumatic-body, the etheric or astral sheath of metaphysics which is the vehicle of theevolving self. He speaks of it as “lurking there in its fastness and directing thegovernment of the living being as from a citadel, for about it Nature hasconstructed all the functions of the brain.” And in The True Book, Synesius (forso let us conveniently name our unknown scribe) says: “If they are acquaintedwith the Medium, they shall find all things feasible and fortunate.” 34Once having admitted the possibility of such an unseen medium existing innature, both within and without, a further problem arises. How may we becomeaware of its presence? Here it is that alchemy is such an irritating problem tomost who have made but a slight study of it. Actually no instructions are given.Not only are the texts vague in their definitions of that basic material withwhich we are to work, but they offer apparently no intelligible clue as to whatmeans are to be employed to tap it and use it. Apart from the fact that mostwriters continually exhort the reader to prayer and meditation and frequentperusal of the classical texts, all appears dark and forbidding. It is more thanpuzzling.On the other hand, there are some people who claim that this is precisely themajor virtue of alchemy. It is their contention that the alchemical writers weremen of ineffable religious experience. That is, their experience related to thespiritual aspects of the universe and man. And what they wrote therefore,obscure though it may seem to us, incorporates and embodies and expressesthose experiences. Runs the argument accordingly, that by steeping oneself bymeditation in their writings, by constant reflection on significant phrases, andintrospection of a deep and penetrating kind, those writings by themselves andof themselves will awaken within the sincere reader, otherwise prepared by"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"life, an echo, some dim formulation, an uneasy awakening of a similar spiritualexperience.How could this occur? What is the rationale of such a theory?It is not far to seek, nor difficult to understand. We must recall to mind thepsycho-analytical technique of free association. Understanding this, the clue isat hand. To ponder over ideas which convey very little to the rational side ofone may not conduce at first to deep understanding. But, by permitting the mindslowly to dwell upon enigmas, whether they be actual dreams thrown up by thepsyche or the mysterious dream-like references of alchemy—both use the samearchaic symbolic language—by allowing the mind freely to drift from words,cryptic phrases and ideas, there are formed association tracks in the mind.Other words link themselves in strange combinations to the original thought.The idea of “cat” may, by association, bring about a vast concatenation ofthoughts totally, at first sight, unrelated to our feline pet. It may evoke thethought of a mouse since, after all, cats do catch mice. Not too irrational anassociation. From that we could drift to traps, where mice are caught andpractically guillotined. Cheese—cheese is used as the tasty bait whereby thesemice are lured to their doom. Cheese—Switzerland, where an excellent cheeseis made and exported over the face of the whole wide world. Switzerland,hotels, restaurants, sports, ice, and mountains. Mountains—this strikes onstrange unfamiliar roots—and one pauses. In wonder one gazes at mountains—alittle awe-stricken and mute before such eternal grandeur looming in theunconquerable heights. Even the most garrulous and superficial amongst us isno little impressed, even inspired by these majesties of nature. The mind flitsfrom mountain to—well, did not Moses receive the law on Horeb? Thepsalmist, did he not declare that from the hills came his help from on high—anddid not Jesus ascend the mountain to deliver his great sermon? And so on ...slowly following associations freely backwards, noting first of all the purelypersonal reactions arising in the mind, to be followed by more abstract andimpersonal archetypes. If no inhibition develops to hinder the tracingbackwards of the track, then yet others arise, and so forth. Finally a species ofmeditation has developed by means of which the mind enters into an immediate"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"experience of that with which it deals. The process is entirely distinct from theclear-cut precise operations of the intellect and its ratiocinative processes. Butsince it does conduce to an increased understanding it possesses a very greatvirtue. It produces results, and as such it is most emphatically to be encouraged.In modern times, because of our history and environment with its specialsocial habits, we are become a people which has violated itself and frustratedits own nature. We have become over-conscious, top-heavy as it were, livingtoo much and too often on the surface. It is a one-sided mode of life, anexaggeration of one particular psychic function at the expense of another. Wehave lost contact with the vital processes and dynamic cycles of nature. Lifehas become mechanized in most of its branches, and with it we too havebecome fixed. Our thinking is done for us by the newspapers. We feel as film-stars have taught us to feel and as we are dictated to by insidious suggestionsfrom our politicians. Our work and occupations are sterile and fruitless oflasting or satisfying result. As a result we are cut off from our roots.The danger is a typical one of over-civilization. One that has afflicted notonly us moderns but the peoples of earlier and equally great civilizations. Awall becomes erected through habit in the mind itself. It eventually comes to actas an impenetrable partition between consciousness and that kinetic side of itsnature which we name the Unconscious. A cleavage or duality is thusengendered in the individuality, and integrity and happiness are lost—acondition reflecting itself from the individual into the national order and life,and vice-versa.Thus our age is sterile and uneasy and barbarous. That whole continents andnations may live in a perpetual state of fear of the outbreak of war—even inundeclared but none the less hideous states of war—sounds incredible. But thisis the age. These things exist. This is our experience. Is not this barbarism?None of us consciously desires such a state of affairs. Yet merely its presenceindicates its nature as an expression of mass psychology. That is to say, it is anemanation of some part of ourselves of which individually we are not aware.And so it becomes projected outwards, to be seen not as the mote in our owneye, but the beam in our neighbor’s. The Unconscious has become transformed"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"into a dangerous entity individually because of abuse, repression, and lack ofunderstanding. What wonder that collectively it has been transformed into auniversally terror producing monster, a fearful destructive process theresponsibility for which no one will shoulder.Yet the responsibility is ours. Each one of us has this psychic stratum that wecall the Unconscious. And that Unconscious is but a part of what has beennamed the Collective Unconscious. We are a part of it, and so are individuallyresponsible for the state of the collective psychic sphere and its activity. Henceany technique enabling us, no matter how, to penetrate this hard and fastdivision set up in the psyche, to dissolve as with a sharp acid the false andarbitrary dualism which inhibits our living the deeper inner life of us, issupremely essential. Nothing could be more important for us all. AnalyticalPsychology is a modern technique for achieving this supreme height of self-understanding, and a very efficient one it is, too. By means of free association,deliberate fantasy and dream analysis, a way is opened up whereby thespontaneous irrational activities of the psyche may be understood and therebyassimilated into the conscious structure of the ego. With understanding comesinsight that these inner spiritual activities are to be encouraged, since they areco-equal factors in the personality and constitute the vital creative root of ourbeing.We have then one instrument to hand whereby we may improve ourunderstanding of the hermetic significance of The True Book. It is, I confess,one instrument only. Being a partitive system it gives a one-sided partialpicture. But at the same time it does serve as an efficient means of coordinatingour other spheres of knowledge, the sum total of which will enable us to bringthis text, or at least parts of it, into the clear light of intellectual appreciation.Let us take the contents of this work and subject them, not so much at first torational criticism as to subjective digestion. What we must aim at is to let thebook work upon us, to let it evoke from the dark within that which answers toit.

Butapart from this theory, another great illumination is shed upon our present textand similar works by a study of comparative religious philosophy andmysticism. No matter to what religious literature we turn, or to what people wemay go for our information on such topics, always do we find a completeagreement on fundamentals. Surface creeds and differentiations of formal ritualmay differ. But at the foundation of every great religion is one identical thing—the basic mystical experience. Every system, from archaic times until today,bases itself on that single fact. Under certain conditions, different men andwomen, regardless of race or creed, have experienced a sudden exaltation tothe heights—a momentous and incomparable experience. An obscuration of theordinary human consciousness occurs, a sense at absolute freedom developsspontaneously, and an awareness arises, at first dimly and vaguely, of theineffable nature of the experience. No longer human, the individual findshimself in sweet and intimate contact with, what, no doubt because of earlytraining, he presumes to call divinity under one of its innumerable guises. Sostaggering is this experience always, that never at any time, in spite of thedifficulty of clear definition or explanation, is there the least shred of doubt butthat what has occurred is some incomprehensible linking of the human soul withsomething larger, greater and finer—with God, the Oversoul, the Absolute, theVoid.Not only so, but these systems did not rest idly with the initial experience ofany one individual. Scientifically they labored to evolve a method whereby anyindividual anxious to experience similar interior results could do so, providedhe applied himself vigorously and patiently and sincerely to the practice of sucha technique. Thus we have in India and Tibet even to this day, the various Yoga"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"and Tantra systems. These we may safely say display a rare and fine knowledgeof the human psyche and its mechanism such as has never been equaled. EarlyChristianity, culminating in Gnosticism, was shot through with all sorts of cultspracticing analogous forms of spiritual culture. Magic, likewise is a similarthough archaic technique which proceeded by a way of invocations and theexaltation of consciousness and, particularly, through an appeal both to theaesthetic sense and the imagination. Using the latter as its principal engine,consciousness could formulate to itself specialized images and mental forms ofvarious kinds. Through these visualized formulations, links were created bywhich or through which the primitive archetypes of the Unconscious, if we wishto use psychological nomenclature, or a cosmic level of consciousness, couldpour into the human soul.Devotional exercises and prayer are yet further means, having a very widefollowing and appeal. Quiescence of mental function, relaxation of thought andfeeling, and complete passivity of will, are still others that have foundadherents and devotees at different times in the world’s history. But all of themhave in view the same experience, no matter by what name it is called, or thespecial terms used in describing the ineffability of that which makes itsunheralded entry into the mind.Our difficulty in appreciating methods such as these may be attributed to thefact that no longer do we Westerners inherit the feeling of them in our blood.Because of bias and prejudice and predilection, the Church in past times neveropenly encouraged these techniques, however widely they may have beenprivately pursued. It had come to rely exclusively on one or two favoriteapproaches, and absolutely refused to tolerate any individual who wassufficiently independent in spirit to apply himself to others. At all times theChurch recommended prayer, devotional exercises and meditation of certainlimited kinds. In fact, the Church considered devotion to be its greatest spiritualweapon; love of God and Christ as a means to attain the distant heights of glory.In itself, this weapon is certainly not to be despised. But the Church committedthe supreme error in failing to recognize that what is one man’s meat may wellbe another’s poison. Not all are so constituted by nature as to be capable of"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"great devotion. Some actually may be incapable of it. Nor is everybodyintellectually fitted for these stupendous flights into the lofty and rarefiedheights of metaphysics and philosophy. Likewise it is only an individual hereand there who is capable of sustained and prolonged meditation, in its deepestimplication of Yoga training. By this I am to be understood as defining Yoga asa rigorous mental discipline, in which the mind is turned in on itself so as toobtain a complete awareness and control of its own faculties, resulting in thearousal of various spiritual functions and powers normally latent within. In thissense, Yoga has many points of similarity with Magic. And it was thesemethods which the Church objected to principally. So it was that the knowledgeof the psyche revealed by these technical processes became lost to Europeanthought and culture.Occasionally there must have arisen an individual here and there who had anintuitive knowledge of these things, or had received in the East some similarspecial training. Perhaps as so often happens, he had in some accidental waystumbled not only on this wonderful experience, but also on the technicalmethods whereby it might suitably be induced—or had in some other waysought to revive that knowledge. Such an individual we know historically wasbitterly opposed and persecuted as dangerous and inimical to the faith. Thetragic fate of the Albigensians, to name out of a large number but one particulargroup, is eloquent testimony to the horrible tactics of organized ecclesiasticism.In view of the fact that so-called occult disciples of the mind develop peculiarpowers which in the popular mind are conceived of as “magical,” and which inthe religious mind are ascribed only to Christ and perhaps a few saints, it isagain obvious why such persecutions occurred. In the opinion of the Church,Christ was a unique being. He was not, as is maintained by modern religiousand ethical groups, a very highly evolved spiritual type comparable to Buddhaor Krishna and similar individuals. He was the Son of God. As such, he wasunique. He was alone in the entire history of the world. Consequently anyperson who claimed to develop, no matter by what mystical or other means,potencies of soul and spirit similar to those possessed and exercised by Christ,stood in direct competition as it were to the Church’s claim. The Church has"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"always preferred to ignore the claims of other religions, especially the claimsof the various mystical and occult systems that such powers were notsupernatural but quite normal to people who had pursued certain techniques andtrainings.One may not close this topic of the possible relation of alchemy to religionand religious experience without first making at least some reference to thataspect of Buddhism called Zen. To define Zen is, in one sense of the word,impossible. It does not readily lend itself, because of its peculiar nature, todefinition. But if we examine it generally our insight may be so sharpened as toenable us to divine something of its meaning. By doing so we will thus havereceived an overwhelming illumination into the possible import of allalchemical writing.“The Wisdom of Enlightenment,” says the Sutra of Wei-lang, “is inherent inevery one of us. It is because of the delusion under which our mind works thatwe fail to realize it ourselves, and that we have to seek the advice and guidanceof the highly enlightened one before we can know our essence of mind. Youshould know that so far as Buddha-nature is concerned there is no differencebetween an enlightened man and an ignorant one. What makes the difference isthat one realizes it, while the other is kept in ignorance of it.” 35Buddha"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"In a word, the basis of Zen is self-realization. The entire object of thepeculiar Zen approach to life was to realize this pure essence of mind, theBuddha-nature so-called. At the outset I should like to add, by way ofspeculation, that if one translates the Alchemical Mercury by the Buddhist term“pure essence of mind” and then interprets alchemy closely along Zen lines, thattranslation of terminology becomes an event of supreme and momentousimportance. It will give us another highly significant clue into what it was thatthe alchemists were desirous of achieving, and the nature of the transmutationthey sought to produce.What therefore is Zen? We know what Buddhism is—more or less. From thiswe would be led to suspect that Zen is but one of its several branches. This isquite true, as far as it goes. But Zen is more. It claims to be a special“transmission outside the scriptures, rising through and beyond words andletters, pointing directly to the mind-essence of man, a seeing into one’s ownnature and the attainment of enlightenment.” 36The teaching of Gautama Buddha was spread in India five hundred yearsprior to the birth of Christ—a thousand years before Mohammed. BuddhistScriptures were translated into Chinese by native and Indian translators,dynasty after dynasty, from the first century of our era. The essence ofBuddhism, however, was carried from India to China in 520 A.D. byBodhidharma, known generally as the first Zen patriarch. The wisdom ofenlightenment perceived by the Buddha, and the inner experience of the silent-sitting Bodhidharma, was likewise inherited by his successor, and similarlyhanded down through many generations. It was thus that Buddhism entered andwas nurtured and promulgated in China and Japan. Its aim was the realizationof what Buddha himself realized—the emancipation and illumination of themind.Zen is an extra-canonical branch of Buddhism, relying upon no sacredscripture or text. Its ultima thule is experience. Its system and its teachersattempt to break through the inflexible strata of the mind by various techniquesand artifices so that the student may, in one swift flash of enlightenment, realizehis own inner core of wisdom. The core is there all the time. You and I, and"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"everyone else in the world, possess this core of wisdom. In one sense, it is thatprima materia which the alchemists claimed to be the most common thing in thewhole world. But we neglect it because of lack of realization of its presence. Ifonly we could divine it, realizing that deep within us behind the blind façade ofconventional thinking, is the real self which we have never known, the wholeface of life in consequence could be altered and enriched for us.The following excerpts from a letter of Yengo (Yuan-wu in Chinese) mayanswer somewhat the question “What is Zen?”The great truth of Zen is possessed by everybody. Look into your own being and seek it not throughothers. Your own mind is above all forms, it is free and quiet and sufficient; it eternally stamps itself inyour six senses and four elements. In its light all is absorbed.Yengo continues:Zen has nothing to do with letters, words or sutras. It only requests you to grasp the point directly, andtherein to find your peaceful abode.And finally:Putting your simple faith in this, discipline yourself accordingly; let your body and mind be turned intoan inanimate object of nature like a stone or a piece of wood; when a state of perfect motionlessnessand unawareness is obtained all the signs of life will depart and also every trace of limitation willvanish. Not a single idea will disturb your consciousness, when lo! all of a sudden you will come torealize a light abounding in full gladness. It is like coming across a light in thick darkness; it is likereceiving treasure in poverty. The four elements and the five aggregates are no more felt as burdens;so light, so easy, so free you are. Your very existence has been delivered from all limitations; you havebecome open, light, and transparent. You gain an illuminating insight into the very nature of things,which now appear to you as so many fairylike flowers having no graspable realities. Here ismanifested the unsophisticated self which is the original face of your being; here is shown all bare themost beautiful landscape of your birthplace. There is but one straight passage open and unobstructedthrough and through. This is so when you surrender all—your body, your life, and all that belongs toyour inmost self. This is where you gain peace, ease, nondoing, and inexpressible delight. All thesutras and sastras are no more than communications of this fact; all the sages, ancient as well asmodern, have exhausted their ingenuity and imagination to no other purpose than to point the way tothis. It is like unlocking the door to a treasury; when the entrance is once gained, every object cominginto your view is yours, every opportunity that presents itself is available for your use; for are they not,however multitudinous, all possessions obtainable within the original being of yourself? 37Zen is based upon a fundamental philosophical fact. Logic and the ordinaryprocesses of thought are unable by themselves to solve the riddle either of the"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"universe or of oneself. Analytical Psychology in all its branches, has recently inthe past several years shown us the validity of this assumption. For in many ofthe thought processes that we pursue, as we were wont to think, so abstractlyand impersonally, we are guided not by the pure inevitable light of reason, butby personal idiosyncrasy and actual wish and whim. We may not be consciousof such a direction to our thought, but there it is, an unconscious motivation,coloring the very flower of our metaphysical effort.Behind all its apparent trivialities and irrationalities that we shall soonuncover and examine, Zen asks us to acquire a new outlook upon life andourselves. We may then see life as it really is, and obtain final satisfaction toour deepest needs. The new point of view to be adopted or cultivated is onewhich will strike right through the apparent duality of existence with its “Aequals A” or “A equals not A.” We shall realize that words by which weattempt to measure so much of life are but words and no more. Words haveceased to correspond with facts; we have become slaves to words. So we mustpart company with words and return to facts.The following indicates with what contempt the Zen masters treated words inthe way we normally use them. Yen, the national teacher of Ku-shan, when hewas still a student monk, studied for many years under Hsueh-feng. One day,seeing that his student was ready for a mental revolution, the master took holdof him, and demanded roughly, “What is this?”Yen was aroused as if from deep slumber and at once comprehended what itall meant. He simply lifted his arms and swung them to and fro. Feng said,“What does this mean?”“No meaning whatever, sir,” came quickly from the disciple.To our great disappointment, despite the greatness of our philosophers andtheologians, we have not been able to obtain peace of mind, perfect happiness,and a thorough understanding of life and the world. We have come to the end ofour tether and there are no further steps to take which would lead us to abroader field of reality. This is only too true of today, as it was of periods inpast history. This is the beginning of Zen."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"It argues that logic is one-sided, and that illogicality so-called, what Jungcould call the irrational side of life, is in the last analysis not necessarilyillogical. What is superficially irrational has after all its own order which is incorrespondence with the true state of things. The irrational is not the chaotic—as will be testified to by anyone who has undergone some degree ofpsychological analysis or received the mystical experience. So far from thisbeing true, life becomes more orderly, understandable and endurable throughjust such an acceptance of its irrational side.When Shui-lao was trimming the wisteria, he asked his master Ma-tsu thequestion “What is the idea of the Patriarch’s coming over here from the West?”Ma-tsu replied, “Come up nearer and I will tell you.”As soon as Shui-lao approached, the master gave him a kick, knocking himcompletely over. This fall, however, says Prof. Suzuki, opened his mind at onceto a state of satori. He rose with a hearty laugh, as if an event, most unexpectedand most desired, had taken place.Thus we find in Zen an insistence upon the apparently illogical. It isdeliberately employed as a needed corrective to the inflexibility and sterility ofmost of our ordinary conscious thinking. Zen is a joyful and spontaneousemphasis of the irrational and much larger elements of ourselves. The result isa breaking up of the tyranny of mind. We will have realized how much we havebeen chained and imprisoned to solely false concepts of ourselves and theuniverse. At the same time it will be a spiritual emancipation, for then thepsyche will no longer be divided against itself. Not only are we beings with aconscious thinking process but there is a process of another order altogetherwhich is equally, if not more, important. And if this latter be not recognized,there is no peace, no happiness and no serenity.By acquiring this intellectual freedom, the soul is in full possession of itself.Birth and death no longer torment it, for there are no such sharp divisionsanywhere in nature—apparent though they seem. There is no dichotomy inconsciousness. No Unconscious and No Conscious. They are both aspects ofthe psyche without cleavage. There are only unknown recesses in our mindswhich lie beyond the threshold of the relatively constructed consciousness."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"“Beyond” is used only because it is the most convenient term to indicate their“position.” Actually there is no “beyond,” no “underneath,” no “upon” in ourconsciousness. The mind is an indivisible unit which cannot be divided or torninto pieces or compartments. The phrase the “unknown recesses of the mind” isbut a concession to our ordinary method of talking.Whatever field of consciousness is known to us is generally filled withunqualified assumptions, dogmas, prejudices, and the results of unexaminedcrystallized mental habits. To get rid of these, to open the spring of living waterwithin—which is necessary for arriving at the Zen experience known as satori—the Zen psychologists sometimes point to the presence of some hithertoinaccessible region in our minds. Though in reality there is no such region apartfrom our everyday consciousness, we talk of it as generally more easilycomprehensible. When all hindrances to the ultimate truth are eliminated, weall realize that there are, after all, no such things as hidden recesses of mind, oreven the truth of Zen or alchemy appearing as mysterious for so long. Alchemyand Zen run parallel one with another, and the truth of one system is the truth ofthe other.But how does Zen work? Granted that the mind in its ordinary working isbarren and sterile, what shall we do? How does Zen propose to break down theinflexible habits of thinking to reveal the bright clear mirror of the mindbeneath? At the core of all Zen procedure is the koan—so extensively used and,like the spagyric riddles of our text, so little understood. The koan is neither ariddle nor a witty remark, however much it may seem to partake of both. It has,remarks Professor Suzuki in his Introduction to Zen Buddhism, a most definiteobjective, the arousing of doubt and pushing it to its furthest limits.38 Astatement built upon a logical basis is approachable through its rationality;whatever doubt or difficulty we may have had about it dissolves itself bypursuing the natural current of ideas. All rivers are sure to pour into the ocean;but the koan is an iron wall standing in the way and threatening to overcomeone’s every intellectual effort to pass ... You feel as if your march of thoughthad been suddenly cut short. You hesitate, you doubt, you are troubled andagitated, not knowing how to break through the wall which seems altogether"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"impassable. When the climax is reached, your whole personality, your inmostwill, your deepest nature, determined to bring the situation to an issue, throwsitself with no thought of self or no self, of this or that, directly and unreservedlyagainst the iron wall of the koan. This throwing your entire being against thekoan, unexpectedly opens up an hitherto unknown region of the mind.Intellectually, this is the transcending of the limits of logical dualism, but at thesame time it is a regeneration, the awakening of an inner sense which enablesone to look into the actual working of things. For the first time, the meaning ofthe koan becomes clear and in the same way that one knows that ice is cold andfreezing. The eye sees, the ear hears, to be sure, but it is the mind as a wholethat has satori; it is an act of perception, no doubt, but it is a perception of thehighest order ... The wall of koan once broken through and the intellectualobstructions well cleared off, you come back, so to speak, to your relatively-constructed consciousness.Thus the koan is a sort of intellectual riddle which challenges the mind tooverthrow itself by an introspection of far reaching implications. It is a riddlebefore which the mind bends as before a gale and is broken, producing a statewhich well might be compared to the alchemical corruption. The alchemicalaphorisms are riddles of the same obscure order, for their writers constantlyenjoin us to turn the mind upon itself. For example, Hermes in The GoldenTreatise says, “My Son, whatsoever thou hearest, consider it rationally. For Ihold thee not to be a fool. Lay hold, therefore of my instructions and meditateupon them, and so let thy heart be fitted, as if thou wast thyself the author ofthat which I now teach.” 39The type of riddle which we find in alchemy includes such statements as this.“Take the flying volatile and drown it flying, and divide and separate it from itsrust which yet holds it in death.” 40 “Extract from the ray its shadow andimpurity by which the clouds hang over it.” “Return then, O my Son, the extinctcoal to the water for thirty days, as I shall note to thee.” 41 And many another.They are quite different in expression from those employed in Zen, but I haveno doubt the object is the same. Moreover, the effect is similar. For if onereflects upon the hermetic writings, one comes to feel as though a knock-out"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"blow has been administered to the mind. In the ordinary terms of mind, thesethings are not understandable. We cannot come to terms with these mysteries,these riddles. They seem to belong to another order of being which we cannotreach. But we take the riddle, make it part of ourselves, worry over it, and itcreates a species of mental crisis. We are taken to the edge of the abyss. Shallwe retreat or ... ? There is the gulf stretching in front of one. Shall one take thechance of plunging?The riddles used by the Zen masters are, as I have said, totally different insubject matter but not in essence. We are asked in Zen to consider that theclapping of two hands makes a noise—what would be produced by one hand?Obviously, taken on its face value, it is nonsense of the grossest kind—but it isunanswerable, and thus by its very irrationality and irrelevancy produces theintellectual crisis so earnestly desired. Another is “What was your original facebefore you were born?” 42Questions were asked which likewise challenged the questioner’s veryintegrity and sanity almost. For instance, Nan-chuan was once asked byHyakulo, one of his fellow-monks, if there was anything he dared not talk aboutto others. The master answered “Yes.”Whereupon the monk continued, “What then is this something you do not talkabout?”The master’s reply was “It is neither mind, nor Buddha, nor matter.”But the monk answered and said, “If so, you have already talked about it.”“I cannot do any better. What would you say?”“I am not a great enlightened one,” answered Hyakulo.The master replied, “Well, I have already said too much about it.”Possibly one may think this is much ado about nothing. But before reachingthis conclusion the advice of Hermes in The Golden Treatise is worthy ofconsideration. Put yourself in the place of the master, and by this identification,attempt to divine what he is endeavoring to achieve. If you do this, some degreeof understanding will arise as to the object of this cross-talk whichsuperficially is so meaningless. A friend of mine, when confronted by the"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"questions and answers of Zen, said it reminded him of a childish game he usedto play. He would ask a playmate:“Do you know Mr. John Doe?”The playmate of course could answer, “I don’t think so. Who is he?”“Who?” would enquire my friend, facetiously.“Mr. John Doe.”“Never heard of him!”Even this, so gleefully indulged in by children, is strictly speaking of the sameirrational order as the Zen koan and zazen, and if carried to the same logicalconclusion, no doubt would produce the same result.Another of these irrational statements is expressed in a couplet:Empty-handed I go, and behold the spade is in my hands; I walk on foot, and yet on the back of an oxI am riding. 43The method of application is best expressed by a Zen master himself. Tau-huisays, “Just steadily go on with your koan every moment of your life. If a thoughtarises, do not attempt to suppress it by conscious effort, only renew the attemptto keep the koan before the mind. Whether walking or sitting, let your attentionbe fixed upon it without interruption. When you begin to find it entirely devoidof flavor, the final moment is approaching; do not let it slip out of your grasp.When all of a sudden something flashes out in your mind, its light willilluminate the entire universe, and you will see the spiritual land of theEnlightened Ones fully revealed at the point of a single hair.” 44Zen is thus a unique product of the Oriental mind. At least it has been soconsidered until recently. But I think if we analyze alchemical writing aright,we will see that its method is similar. Its uniqueness consists, so far as itspractical aspect goes, in its methodical training of the mind in order to mature itto the state of satori. The mind may grow by itself even when left to nature toachieve her own ends. But man cannot always wait for her. He likes to meddle,for better or for worse. “Art perfects what nature began” is an alchemicalaphorism, and it has application to the matter on hand. The position is similar tothat taken by the advocate of the Eastern Yoga systems. It is true that all men"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"eventually may obtain liberation and spiritual freedom. But the processes ofNature, whilst certain, are slow and ponderous. By the application of humanintelligence and sympathetic skill, these natural processes may be considerablyaccelerated, and the development of spiritual evolution hastened. Thus bothalchemy and Zen Buddhism are processes deliberately designed to further whatNature began and what Nature eventually may finish by herself. The advocatesof both systems believe that, when certain stages of psychic development havebeen reached, it is possible to accelerate it enormously by judicious and carefultraining. The goal of that training is what the Zen Buddhists name Satori, andthe alchemists call it the transmutation of lead or baser metals into gold.Satori is the sudden flashing into consciousness of a new truth hithertoundreamed of. It is a sort of mental catastrophe taking place all at once aftermuch piling up of matters intellectual and demonstrative. The piling reaches alimit of stability when the whole edifice tumbles madly to the ground, theputrefaction so often spoken of in alchemy. Suddenly, a new heaven is open tofull survey. When the freezing point is reached, water turns in an instant to ice.The liquid has suddenly turned into a solid body, and no more flows freely.Satori similarly comes upon a man unawares, when he feels that he hasexhausted his whole being. Religiously, it is a new birth. Intellectually andpsychologically, it is the acquiring of a new viewpoint which partakes of alllevels of consciousness. The world now appears as if clothed in someresplendent garment into which everything fits by right of place.In one sense Zen Buddhism has nothing to do with religion in the ordinarymanner of thinking. Here we find nothing to do with the ordinary concepts ofGod, the soul, repentance, sin, and salvation. Rather we must assume that it ismore akin to a psychology than a religion. It seeks to produce radical and far-reaching changes in the consciousness of its devotees, changes andtransmutations induced within because of a sense of present inadequacy andinsufficiency. The outlook upon life is somehow defective. Within there is nopeace of mind, no stability and integrity. There is a warfare waged betweendifferent elements within the personality, and the crucial problem is somehowto solve that warfare, to bring quiet and peace to a troubled mind. Zen’s method"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"is so to aggravate that conflict until it reaches a peak when the intellect itselfcrumbles, unable any more to fight. It gives up—relaxing its efforts finally inthe face of too formidable obstacles. And then takes place that miracle of theages. It is as though there were an element within, latent and dormant throughoutthe ages, which is stirred to activity only by the aggravation of conflict and bythe threat of possible spiritual extinction. Only when the mind has accepteditself and released its tension does this other dynamic element commence itsoperation, transmuting in an instant the entire personality and changing thewhole outlook upon life.I suggest that if alchemy is rigidly interpreted along such lines as these, as itsown internal evidence seems definitely to suggest, we have more than asatisfactory clue as to its nature. Its mysteries are riddles deliberately inventedso as to tax the reader’s patience and activate the innate intelligence. The mind,rendered furious by these inexplicable obscurities, rams itself headlong into thestone wall of darkness, and in time sees itself defeated by the inevitable. Thiscontinued and persisted in, as the alchemists intended it should be, results inpsychic relaxation and an unburdening of the soul, and the manifestation of newprinciples intrinsic to the personality.For the Neo-Platonist of Synesius’ day, the source of true knowledge wassupposed to exist likewise not in the development of logical thought but in thoseecstatic moments of ineffability when the soul became conjoined with thedivine Being itself. The belief was held that when we seek to define God byintellectual definitions we confine him within the boundaries represented byour finite notions of what truth must be, and, therefore, degrade him. We attainto God, so held the Neo-Platonists, not by making our knowledge morecomplete, correcting what we know by a deeper and richer intellectualknowledge, but by giving up altogether our feeble attempt at comprehension. Byrelaxing the fibers of the mind, and allowing the distinct yet arbitraryconceptions of the intellect to fade away, we may enter into an immediate andineffable identity of feeling. Centuries earlier, Plato had argued that to knowGod it was necessary to eliminate the sense and bodily life. The Neo-Platonistswent much further. They said we must get rid of the intellect as well. The"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"predominant tinge to the entire philosophy was that no intellectual process willbring us into that immediate vital contact with reality which is Deity. Rather,such a process is a hindrance. The ultimate method of religion as a practicalscheme is not thought, but mystic contemplation and feeling, an unconditionedacceptance of the irrational element of life. This is the way to regeneration.And the final goal is that indefinable ecstasy in which the finite personality andthought and self-consciousness drop away, and the individual consciousnessmelts to a oneness with the Absolute wherein no trace of difference orseparation abides.This recognition of the side of immediate experience is also found, it must beadmitted in all honesty, in Christianity in the doctrine of the Holy Spirit. In laterChristian mysticism a direct Neo-Platonic influence continued—and stillcontinues today. But at first the Church emphasized the fact of a single historicalrevelation in the past—that of Christ. Accordingly, the insistence upon theauthority of a definite and final historical revelation in Palestine came more andmore to be the orthodox body of Christianity. The mystical attempt to elevatethe personal ego in the acquisition of a higher state of consciousness wasconsidered dangerously lawless, and condemned as heresy. It was the Churchview that no man by himself and by his own unaided efforts could attain divineillumination save by the grace and intervention of God. This view thereforeexpressly outlaws all human effort and aspiration in a mystical direction. ForProvidence, at a moment’s notice, and to us in a wholly capricious way, couldilluminate a clod. Sterile and uncreative as it is, such a conception permeateseven alchemical literature. We find certain of the alchemists expressing theopinion that only by prayer and the grace of God could the knowledge of thesecret Fire of the Wise be revealed. Others, nevertheless, stressed meditationand human effort as the means by which divine grace was obtained.Because it was heresy to develop in a mystical direction, the alchemicaljargon came into being. Or at least, shall we say it was adopted by those whohad occult and mystical ideas to express. It was a convenient code already fullydeveloped. For several reasons it became imperative to employ a medium forthe expression not only of the religious or mystical experience, but to describe"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"the technical means whereby such illuminations, and that which developedtherefrom, could be induced. The hermetic writings were also means by whichthe alchemist wished to make himself known to his unknown brethreneverywhere who had likewise done the same work and achieved the sameresults. He craved as only such a human being can crave the society of thosewith whom he could converse freely of those wonderful things—those withwhom he could reside and travel without having to put a continual restraintupon his words and actions. Alchemical literature is one repetitive testimony tothis end and to this obfuscation of motive, despite the fact that occasionallyactual chemical formulae were used as a cloak. And despite the fact too thatimposters and charlatans had employed impossible fraudulent receipts as ameans of enhancing their own vile reputations, or to swindle the avaricious orunsuspecting of their worldly goods.When examining this and similar texts, if the reader will bear such ideas inmind, I feel he will approach that which the unknown author had in his heart toexpress. As Synesius himself says: “Upon this ground was it that they werepleased to speak by figures, types, and analogies, that so they might not beunderstood but by such as are discreet, religious, and enlightened by (divine)Wisdom. All which, notwithstanding, they have left in their writings a certainmethod, way and rule, by the assistance whereof the wise man may comprehendwhatever they have written most obscurely, and in time arrive at a knowledgeof it.” 45[contents]35.

In the GoldenTreatise of Hermes Trismegistus, it is defined as: “In the caverns of the metalsthere is hidden the Stone that is venerable, splendid in color, a mind sublime.and an open sea ... Know that this matter I call the Stone; but it is also namedthe feminine of magnesia, or the hen, or the white spittle, or the volatile milk,the incombustible ash, in order that it may be hidden from the inept andignorant, who are deficient in goodness and self-control; which I havenevertheless signified to the Wise by one only epithet, viz., the Philosopher’sStone.” 46 It is this concept that answers to the spiritual principle affirmed byevery religious scheme, the Oversoul, the Soul of the World, the One Lifevivifying all things, the Light itself. It is commonplace that the mysticalexperience is also termed illumination because its major characteristic is aflooding of the mind and entire personality by an incomparable brilliance. Nosimile will describe its luster and incandescence. Sun and moon and stars fadeaway into utter blackness before its face—the light that was never seen on landor sea. And Synesius here says of the splendor which is “the force, thebeginning and the end of the whole work” that it is “a clear Light, which shedstrue goodness into every Soul that hath once tasted of it.” 47Dormant within man, because obscured by his busy everyday but superficialconsciousness, it passes unnoticed and unvalued. Thus the alchemists say theirfirst material is uncommonly cheap. Hermes asserts “Our most precious stonecast forth upon the dunghill, being most dear, is made altogether vile.” 48Whilst Thomas Vaughan, in a letter from the R. C., says: “This matter whichfor the crowd is vile, exceedingly contemptible and odious, yet not hateful butlovable and precious to the wise, beyond gems and tried gold. A lover itself of"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"all, to all well-nigh an enemy, to be found everywhere, yet discovered scarcelyby any, though it cries through the streets to all: Come to me all ye who seekand I will lead you in the true path. This is that only thing proclaimed by thetrue philosophers, that which overcometh all and is itself overcome by nothing,searching heart and body, penetrating whatsoever is stone and stiff,consolidating that which is weak, establishing resistance in the hard.” 49No one notices or becomes aware of that within him which is most valuable.It requires to be mined from the depths, from the cavern of the metals which isman himself. The alchemical references to man as a mine, and to his differentprinciples as metals or minerals, is by no means so utterly fantastic or absurdas at first sight may have seemed. Man, chemically is an aggregation of variousminerals. His physical constitution consists of calcium, phosphorus,magnesium, iron, potassium, sulphur and so forth, in various proportions. Infact, his wellbeing depends on a certain balance of these minerals beingmaintained. In a sense, then, man is, as the alchemists claimed, a mine. Deepwithin that mine is latent that first principle of consciousness which in itself isboth the beginning of life and the goal of the Great Work.This principle of life so obscurely defined is that which they call the Mercuryof the Philosophers. That this cannot possibly refer to common quicksilver orhydrargyrum is persistently thrust home to us as we read their writings. “Thename of Mercury doth only properly agree with that which is volatile.” 50“Mercury substance of all metals; it is as a water by reason of the homogeneitywhich it possesses with vegetables and animals and it receives the virtues ofthose things which adhere to it in decoction.” 51 “If your argent vive has no life,it is not what they mean.” 52 “The matter of our stone, mercury, is a commonlydiffused subject, and though it is found with greater ease in some minerals, itmay be discovered everywhere.” 53 “The metals—especially the gold of thevulgar—are dead, but ours are living, full of spirit, and these wholly must betaken.” 54 “Or what more shall I say,” asks Morienus, discoursing with anArabian monarch about the Stone. “The thing, O King, is extracted from thee, inthe which mineral thou doest even exist; with thee it is found; by thee it isreceived; and when thou shalt have proved all by the love and delight in thee, it"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"will increase, and thou wilt know that I have spoken an enduring truth.” 55 “MySon,” counsels Synesius, “it is necessary that thou work with the Mercury ofthe Philosophers and the Wise, which is not the Vulgar.” 56Surely there can be no misunderstanding here? How could scholars haveimagined that hydrargyrum was meant? Yet for centuries chemists havemaintained obstinately; in the face of inviolable evidence and testimonyotherwise, that alchemy sought a metallic transmutation, and that thephilosophical Prima Materia was a metal.For the purpose of this thesis, I define Mercury, this living quicksilver, as aspecies or type of consciousness, of life, of spiritual vitality. This we mustdiscover in our own hearts, for until we do, so say the alchemists, we arehardly alive at all. “As soon as any discerns the intention of the Philosophers,from the seeming sense of the letter, the dark night of ignorance will fly away,and a glorious morning of light and knowledge will break forth.” 57 Until thisglorious morning of Light, a frequently encountered term for the mysticalexperience, does arise—until we have divined the presence of this interiorlight, we cannot proceed with the work. Once having become conscious of this“blessed nature” permeating us, and lying dormant within the inner heartwaiting to be called upon, then all things are possible. Life then becomestransformed and hallowed. All things are realized to glow with their owninward light, and gold is seen in them and about them."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"MercuryFirst of all, awareness of it must be widened, enhanced and heightened. Itmust be permitted freely to work its effect on us. We must become onlookers,objective spectators of and participants in the work of recreation, in the realsense of the word. For having divined the latent inner life, we can never turnback to forget it. At once, by that first second’s perception of oneself, it hasproduced an ineradicable effect on the personality. Instantaneously we becomeaware of a contrast. On the one hand we see the petty human consciousnessbound by apparently unbreakable bonds to a world of convention, insincerity,hypocrisy, and commercialism—a sham shadow of our own creation. On theother hand is the interior dawning of the Light itself, vision, life, and love.Forthwith conflicts begin to corrupt the ego. “As an acid eats into steel, as acancer that utterly corrupts the body; so am I unto the spirit of man. I shall notrest until I have dissolved it all.” 58 So has one poet expressed the effect of theLight upon the ego. The narrow restricted vision, hidebound and crystallized,"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"undergoes a transformation. Eventually, new values form. A new attitudeevolves to life. No hard and fast barrier is permitted to exist in consciousnessto prevent the easy upwelling of this inner life. No opaque ideas are allowed tobar the translucence and illumination of the Light. But that is an ultimate stage.Meanwhile, until that takes place, there is fear and pain and sorrow.All births, all great changes, are attended by pain. We are hurt at any vitalchange that occurs to us. Anxiety at once commences to corrode our spirit. Weseek to erect barriers to change, forgetting that life itself is constantly changing.The universe is in a state of flux—and we with it too. Walls are erected aroundus to maintain the status quo and to defend what we falsely imagine to be ourmenaced integrity. But whilst the defense mechanism keeps off all intruderswithout, and shuts us up within all safe and sound, it also becomes theunconscious means of cutting us off from the swift moving current of life. Lifemoves and, because of our defenses, we do not move—become static anddivorced from reality. The ego becomes swollen. The energy from theUnconscious levels becomes repressed, for the Unconscious is life andmovement. Conflict is developed as the order of the day, and conflict spellstension. Tension and conflict are but the outcome of fear and anxiety. Theseprevent one from realizing the true nature of reality, thrusting one into a deludedworld of one’s own creation. And then, as the Bhagavad Gita says “fromdelusion is produced loss of the memory, from the loss of memory, loss ofdiscrimination, and from loss of discrimination, loss of all!” 59 We have lost theknack of “sitting loose to life,” as one clever psychological expositor hastermed it,60 and letting life without hindrance work its changes and its effectsupon us.If we enjoy and ardently seek pleasure let us also realize that it is but a partof life. Pain and sorrow is the other half. Let us not be Hedonists, living ourlives solely devoted to pleasure. Nor let us be Buddhists who assert that all issorrow and productive of pain. If we would not lose the one, let us not try toexclude the other. Acceptance is the key towards the formulation of the onlysatisfactory world view for us. We have to accept the whole of life—life andthe universe and its effects in all its branches, not merely one alone which"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"appeals to us. It is presumption of the crudest kind to believe that we mayescape from pain. On the other hand, with acceptance of the whole of lifeunconditionally, life transforms itself so that one functions on altogether adifferent level than that of pain and pleasure. The new birth or the developmentof a higher psychological attitude induced by the discovery of the Light isequally feared. Particularly is it feared because the old viewpoint is perceivedfor what it is. It is valueless and degrading, preventing spontaneity andcreativeness in life. At the same time, moreover, no new or final vision hasformulated itself clearly within the mind. It is difficult and hurtful to let go ofthe old and be content to wait patiently and see what happens as the new lifecomes to birth within. The future seems dark and unknown.It is dark. But we must be patient and relax and wait. A child will becomeimpatient and fretful, demanding tearfully that it must have what it wants whenit wants it. The hysteric may do likewise, and develop all sorts of adversepsychic and physiological symptoms in consequence of what he deems to be hisfrustration. But the adult in the true sense of the word may not behave thus forhe realizes that he cannot coerce nature. Nature can only be conquered bysubmission and acceptance of her laws. He must leave to life whatever it maywish to bring forth—and be calm and philosophical in his waiting. No crutch isto be found anywhere to lean upon. What is unknown and unseen is alwaysfeared. The child’s psychology should have shown us that. Fear and anxietyinduce this blackness within the ego. Such a blackness arising within the psycheis a recognized phenomenon, and by the alchemical authorities do we find it sonamed and described. It is an admirable correspondence with what in religiousmystical literature is called the dark night of the soul.In all the alchemical works do we read that the blackness is a significantstage of the Great Work. It is a necessary stage because it represents thecorruption and putrefaction of the false inflexible ego sense itself preparatoryto the complete upwelling of the archetypes of the Unconscious. Synesiusaffirms that “the blackness which appears is a sign of putrefaction. And thebeginning of the dissolution is a sign of the conjunction of both natures.” 61 Notethe wording here—“the conjunction of both natures”—it is significant."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"What the alchemists aimed at, apparently, was a primary dissolution ofconsciousness into its own root, the Unconscious. Nor was this all. Followingthis psychic immersion, the elements of consciousness re-form themselves on anew pattern, in such a way as to exist not as an opponent of the Light, but as anintegral part of one single psychic entity, the vehicle and means of expression ofthe Light. This idea of the re-arrangement of the psychic pattern after thedissolution of its own constituents has been very concisely expressed byAleister Crowley in these words: “There is an obvious condition which limitsour proposed operations. This is that, as the formula of any work affects theextraction and visualization of the Truth from any ‘First Matter,’ the ‘Stone’ or‘Elixir’ which results from our labors will be the pure and perfect Individualoriginally inherent in the substance chosen, and nothing else. The most skilfulgardener cannot produce lilies from the wild rose; his roses will always beroses, however he have perfected the properties of his stock. There is here nocontradiction with our previous thesis of the ultimate unity of all substance. It istrue that Hobbs and Nobbs are both modifications of the Pleroma. Both vanishin the Pleroma when they attain Samadhi. But they are not interchangeable to theextent that they are individual modifications: the initiate Hobbs is not theinitiate Nobbs, any more than Hobbs the haberdasher is Nobbs of ‘the nail andsarspan business as he got his money by.’ Our skill in producing aniline dyesdoes not enable us to dispense with the original aniline, and use sugar instead.Thus the Alchemists said: ‘to make gold you must take’: their art was to bringeach substance to the perfection of its own proper nature.” 62After restoration to life following the immersion in the dynamic stream ofUniversal Life, consciousness becomes the Lumen Vestimenti, the golden robeof light and glory, the true Philosopher’s Stone. In the Tibetan Book of theDead, scholarly edited and introduced by Dr. Evans-Wentz, a similar view maybe found. The passage I quote below is supposed to be uttered by the officiatinglama who is conducting the deceased through different levels of consciousnessafter physical death. “Now thou art experiencing the Radiance of the ClearLight of Pure Reality. Recognize it ... Thy present intellect, in real nature void,not formed into anything as regards characteristics or color, naturally void, is"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"the very Reality, the All-Good ... Thine own consciousness, shining void andinseparable from the Great Body of Radiance, hath no birth nor death and is theImmutable Light.” 63But before the Stone can be concocted—that is before consciousness canachieve integration—the material of which it is constructed must be brokendown to its own homogeneous base and dissolved. “Include, therefore, andconserve in that sea, the fire, and the heavenly Flyer,” advises Hermes in theTractatus Aureus, “to the latest moment of his exit.” 64 The heavenly flyer is thevolatile fantasy-creating consciousness of the ego. It is to be conserved orimmersed in the Sea of the Wise, the Unconscious, and “drowned,” the baptismof the soul in God.Immediately the ego, which has very definite precise limits and powers,comes into contact with the Unconscious, which is a wide delimited oruniversal stream of life of extremely greater potency in that it has behind itaeons of evolutionary development, it tends to disintegrate.By the use of the words disintegration and corruption we can readilyunderstand their meaning. Corruption is a chemical change involving acomplete alteration of substance. And disintegration means a structuralbreaking down of a whole. If the ego by nature is definite, inflexible,crystallized and dogmatic in its expression as all of us are mostly agreed it isnowadays, then this process will bring about a diminution of that over-definiteness. Its absoluteness will be modified, its “cock-sureness” and over-certainty too. We could expect a relaxing of its inflexible and crystallizednature to a very marked degree. Actually if a very extensive and intensivedegree of relaxation could be induced to include every department of the mind-body system, we would be near to achieving that ultimate goal of thealchemical philosophy. Such a disintegration or corruption is that which thealchemists anticipate and demand as the first stage of the Great Work. The TrueBook speaks of this blackness of dissolution or the consciously producedschizophrenia as “the dark mantle of the Stone,” which is eloquent enough.Again, Synesius refers to it as “the sable robe, night, or the crow’s-head.” 65"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"This latter phrase is one commonly employed by the alchemists. In fact, TheGolden Treatise states that “what is born of the crow is the beginning of thisart.” 66 The crow or the raven—they are synonymously employed—is a blackbird and, in the sense in which it is symbolically used of the alchemists, is likethe vulture in that it is a bird of prey. It feeds upon the dead. Black is the colorwe associate with death, with fear, guilt and anxiety.After its immersion in the wide expanse of the Collective Unconscious, theego dies as it were, and becomes extinct. In psychology, the idea of the extent ofthe Unconscious has been variously portrayed. Commonest is the notion that if alarge iceberg represents the entire self, the one-tenth visible above the watersrefers to the surface rational consciousness, the ego: whilst the nine-tenthsbelow the waters comprise the activities of the Unconscious. Together theyconstitute one psyche, one unit, but for convenience’ sake we consider themseparately.Hence when the ego is made extinct through immersion in the deeper andmore vital levels of its own being, we may speak of it as being fed upon orswallowed by the Unconscious. Dark and black the Unconscious seems to be,because of its disintegrating or putrefying effect on the ego—a very tellingsymbol of death.Immediately the disintegrating process is begun, however, a secondary law inthe psyche comes into operation. Were this process once begun and were it tocontinue indefinitely without check—as it does in psychosis whereschizophrenia is purely a conscious resultant of internal conflict, and anunrestrained flight from reality into the world of phantasy—the end of theindividual would be in sight. But because consciousness co-operates with theUnconscious in this psychic baptism, a reversal of motion operatesautomatically once a certain degree of disintegration has been accomplished.After the psychic crisis subsides, the dualism inherent within the self tendingalways to schizophrenia is eliminated. The innate and hitherto concealed life orspirit builds up a new vehicle of consciousness through which it may functionmore adequately and satisfactorily than before. In Zen we have already seen aparallel of this. In the Chinese text of Wilhelm’s already referred to, this is"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"named the Golden Flower. The rationale is comparable to the course of certainsomatic pathologies. The disease grows more and more acute and virulent,gradually reaching a crisis. Spontaneously it subsides, slowly, and without theneed for further interference. So by the law of reversed effort, what Jung, afterHeracleitus, has termed enantiodromia, the life of the psyche instead ofbecoming extinguished, passes over into its opposite and is self-sustained,seeking life in an entirely new direction.The process involved, the use of the word enantiodromia sounds a littleterrifying, does it not? In reality however, this lengthy word only indicatessomething you long have been familiar with. In order to give a theoreticalinstance of its application in another sphere which may assist the understandingand also provide a definition, let me briefly delineate a simple observation inphysics.Heat we are told causes expansion. Expansion and the consequent diffusion ofheat leads to loss of heat. Cooling sets in, bringing about a state of contraction.Contraction generates heat, and heat gives rise to expansion—and so the samecycle begins again. In other words, one extreme in nature, by a slow andgradual process passes directly over into its antithesis.This is enantiodromia, the law of conversion into opposites. Possibly youare more familiar with it under its old guise of the pendulum and its swing fromone side to another.Abnormal psychology gives us a first rate example of it in manic depression.Here the patient sinks slowly into the most horrible depression, a melancholiain which he is utterly inert and miserable. This is succeeded by a bout ofelation and light-headedness which would make the pleasure and joy of anormal person appear like a three-year old weeping because his favorite toywas broken.Manic depression is almost a perfect parallel from a psychopathic viewpointto our present social and spiritual state. We rise and we fall in spite ofourselves—and a glance over history will show how one condition isinevitably succeeded by that which is its reverse. Only self-knowledge can end"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"this involuntary swing, an awareness of the motives and forces operating in thebackground of our lives.I may point out that St. Paul stands as an excellent example of theenantiodromiatic principle. As a Jew, Saul was decidedly antagonistic to thedevelopment of the new faith of Christianity. He was a confirmed opponent ofit, a fanatic. Because of his hatred he was determined to do all he could tostamp out the new faith. Fanaticism we well know is born of secret doubt. Ifthere are doubts hidden in your own soul, and in fear you will not permityourself to face them, they find a necessary outlet in the form of a fanatical andextreme attitude towards life. This is a well-observed psychologicalphenomenon. A sudden and unexpected conversion changed Saul from anunbeliever to a believer, Paul. From an opponent contorted with hate, hebecame the greatest proponent of Christianity.Although the actual incidence of a conversion—that is, a right about face, aswitch around of the outlook upon life—often seems sudden and totallyunexpected, yet we know that nothing in nature happens suddenly. There musthave been a long period of preparation beforehand. It is only when suchpreparation is completed that the new view manifests itself violently. Theconversion itself would coincide with the arrival of the pendulum at itsopposite point. Prior to reaching that point, it had slowly been swinging over—from hate, in the case of St. Paul, to love itself.Speaking of St. Paul’s conversion on the way to Damascus and the blindnessthat afflicted him, Dr. Jung remarks that psychogenetic blindness is readilyexplainable. He regards it as a symptom of a psychological unwillingness tosee and understand and realize something that has been made incompatible withthe conscious attitude. This was obviously the case with St. Paul. Hisunwillingness as a Jew to see what virtue might lie in Christianity correspondswith his fanatical resistance to it. This resistance was never whollyextinguished, as his epistles evince. But because of this irrational attitude, helaid himself open to enantiodromia—the conversion of his religious viewpointinto something diametrically opposed to it."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"To take another example. The so-called Middle Ages were a periodcharacterized by an extreme belief in things of mind and spirit, as opposed tothe materialistic feeling and belief that prevailed in the late Roman Empire.Nowadays we are not dogmatically to assume that such a belief wasunreasoning and blind. On the contrary, there were then many men whose mindsmay well have rivalled those of present day thinkers. They were well trained inthe processes of logic and philosophical speculation. The opinions of these fewbecame mirrored in the general credulity and ignorance of the masses, exactlyas nowadays is the case.When the historical peak of belief was reached, gradually the pendulumbegan its backward movement—enantiodromia had operated. Instead ofbelieving in spirit and spiritual things, today the masses profess a belief inmatter and economics. Their belief is just as irrational and extreme as it was informer times for they fail to realize the factor of mass psychology, which is thatfactor producing economic and social conditions.Matter and spirit and economics are psychological concepts designed tobetter our understanding of the inscrutable things of life and the universe.Mankind sees but the symbol without in the least divining what is concealedbehind. Excellent minds have led the masses into this cul-de-sac, men whosought a deeper knowledge of nature through empirical and scientific methods.Their investigations and the conclusions they reached have been irrationallyand conveniently accepted by men at large who thus have become irreligiousand materialistically inclined. But the pendulum will swing back.Enantiodromia will once again operate, and without a doubt mankind in thenear future will once again believe in spirit and mind and things of the higherlife.However, I am not really concerned just now with these matters of belief.These are matters for theologian and philosopher—not for the psychologist.What concerns me now is enantiodromia and its operation. It brings aboutradical changes in points of view covering long, long periods of time. Thisphenomenon can be observed in other than historical movement and individuallives. The substance of literature likewise offers eloquent testimony as to its"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"operation. At certain periods literature is specious. It exhibits artificiality andfalsity, and does not depict life save through the purblind eyes of prejudice andmisanthropy. Puritanism and moral brittleness pervade its every word. Livelyhealthy literatures follow, writing which does exhibit the pulsing, vibrant coreof human life. It deals with aspiration and nobility and purpose, caring naughtfor an artificial morality foisted unnaturally upon a passionate dynamic people.The tide turns. Again the pendulum swings back. A puritan spirit breathescoldly upon us as an automatic reaction against humanity and freedom. Oncemore mankind is swallowed up by the unconscious movement of forcesoperating unknown to itself within the depths of its own collective sphere.To analyze the idea a little more closely, it would seem that to swing from oneextreme to its opposite, the latter must be present within the heart at least asseed, as potentiality, as possibility. The mere fact of Saul’s great hatred of theearly Christians demonstrates at once the presence of his abiding love for thereligion of “Christ crucified and resurrected.”A Chinese aphorism has it that when Yang is at its height Yin is born. Yangand Yin are, as I have indicated on a former page, the two opposites enunciatedby Chinese Taoism. They are light and darkness, heat and cold, life and death—and all the other opposites that we daily experience. The aphorism would seemto indicate that light, upon reaching its maximum brilliance, slowly passes intoits decline. At the very attainment of its zenith, darkness is conceived as apossibility and as an eventual goal of the pendulum swing. When an empirereaches the height of its imperial achievement and conquest, enantiodromia hasalready commenced its operation. Decline, decay, and corruption have set in.The moral of the story as a mentor of mine would have said, is that if you arean extremist in anything you do, (...)67 beware! More likely than not as timegoes on you will become just that which you have abhorred and detested. Theyouthful communist becomes the aged conservative and reactionary. The boywho has hated his father for his domineering traits and unemotionalismbecomes, by process of unconscious identification, a man indistinguishable inthe eyes of the world from his father before him."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Beware of uncontrolled expression of any extreme emotion. The time maycome when the law of your own psyche may operate to your discomfiture toconvert your expression into its antithesis. It is, however, only unconsciousnessthat permits the unbridled operation of this law. If you were really aware ofyourself, your emotions and the motives that propelled you into activity, at onceyour behavior would be subject to some degree of correction, criticism andmodification. In this event, your own self-knowledge would have overcome theoperation of enantiodromia. What wonder the Greeks lauded the oracle “Manknow thyself!” 68A knowledge of this law should go far towards shaping a more satisfactoryattitude towards life. It is not what happens to us externally that is important ormost significant. How we react to stimuli and how we feel about them—theseare the important things. Your love eventually may turn to hate. Your elationmay die, giving place to melancholy and gloom. All the things you loathe anddespise may, in time, change and yield pleasure and happiness. These areinevitable. But to know yourself and to realize that this law of conversion intoopposites works unceasingly within your own psyche day in and day out,should help you considerably in adapting yourself more effectually to life itself.Presumably the materialism and license of our age—since these areexpressions of the Collective Unconscious—will convert itself hereafter intoan age of adherence to things of the spirit. Not only so, but reading the signs ofthe times and watching the backward swing of the pendulum, the near futurewill be characterized by an almost puritanical code of ethics.Capitalism may be replaced by socialism—or something which serves as apendulum opposite to its extreme. The present economic depression 69 will befollowed by a wave of prosperity. That prosperity will in turn be followed by adepression. But before enantiodromia can operate the very depths of thedepression have to be reached. We must taste of the very lowest dregs ofdespair and bitterness and horror before the pendulum can begin its slow swingover to the other side of economic security and stability.This can be asserted with a certain degree of emphasis. For economics arenot simply external events. They represent subjective psychological values."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Why do I say this? Does it seem strange to associate the economic fluctuationwith interior psychic events? It may seem incredible at first to one not familiarwith the significance of modern psychology, but this is a conclusion that daily isborne in upon the practitioner. A patient of mine—a Wall Street operator—indiscussing his occupation, remarked incidentally, almost with reflection, thatthe stock market was the life-blood of the nation. This being too good anopportunity to be missed, I asked him to consider the significance of this remarkin our usual manner. That is to transfer it from the purely objective level ontothe subjective plane. By this, I mean to imply that any objective fact has aninward significance to the patient. The mother, for example, in a dream, meansnot only the objective mother, but is a symbol of the emotional and spiritualside of the patient, his Unconscious. Sex, translated into libido, likewise is ageneral term and field of activity symbolizing the creative side of the psyche.Likewise the phrase “the life-blood of the nation” may be interpreted as anobjective symbol of an inward psychological principle or fact. So I asked mypatient what was the life-blood of the individual—the individual being theultimate root pattern of the nation. And after some few seconds of deliberation,he expressed the belief that the emotional life was the life-blood of theindividual.Without emotional expression, the individual was as good as dead.Repression was the killing process. And he came to associate his owncondition of penury and financial embarrassment and lack of commercialsuccess which he so ardently desired with just such a repression of hisemotional nature. Thus in his mind and power were direct symbols of emotionand libido.In so far as we are not fully conscious of ourselves, our potentialities, andwhat we really think and feel, there will be always aspects of ourselves ofwhich we will remain unconscious. Because of this unconsciousness, theycannot be recognized as facets of ourselves. And if not perceived as ourselves,these forces of our own being are solely as objective happenings, mysteriousand uncontrollable. Yet they are only the externalizations or the projectionsobjectively of what exists within our own minds. Thus the fluctuations and"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"unconscious pendulum swingings within the psychic deeps that occur unknownto ourselves are projected on to the external world as the working out ofeconomic and business laws and events.One day perhaps we may decide to awaken and attempt this achievement ofself-consciousness as an integrated nation in order to perfect out economic andspiritual lives. When a higher degree of racial awareness has been achieved,we shall become aware of the operation of enantiodromia within. We can thendecide to do something about polarizing ourselves between the opposites—regardless of their specific nature. With such an awareness, we will findourselves able to modify the pendulum swing and, because of ourunderstanding, overcome the operation of enantiodromia. Until we do thishowever, we shall forever be subject to the swing from one painful extreme tothe other—to our own eternal detriment.To return to our text, however, the conjunction of the two polarities of thepsyche through this reversal and change of attitude is a goal envisaged both bypsychological analysis and by the alchemical or spagyric art. What is born ofthis interior death is evidently the beginning of the Great Work, thereformulation of the Son, the king-born, which is a resurrected consciousness. Itis this which is also the aim of every religion and mystical system which hasarisen since the dawn of time. It is this ideal of inner integrity which isexpressed by Socrates in the passage at the conclusion of the Phaedrus:“Beloved Pan, and all ye gods who haunt this place, give me beauty in theinward soul, and may the outward and inward man be at one. May I reckon thewise to be the wealthy, and may I have such a quantity of gold as none but thetemperate can carry. Anything more? That prayer, I think, is enough for me.” 70[contents]46.

How may this change be inducedin consciousness? This is indeed a problem. It is by now evident that we mustlabor to produce some intensification or widening of the horizon of the mind.As to how this is to be accomplished, apart from our hazard that freeassociation may be useful, is not elucidated by the text with any degree ofclarity. In one place we are advised to decoct the water of the Wise “gently bylittle and little.” 71 It cautions us to “have great care at the beginning” not toburn “its Flowers and its vivacity, and make not too much haste to come to anend of thy work.” In that section entitled The First Operation, Sublimation, weread that the First Matter or the Hyle, must be “put into its vessel” and then wemust “make it hot in its place, well-prepared, with temperate heat.” 72Elsewhere, Synesius advises us that to “extract the soul, or the spirit, or thebody, is nothing else than the abovesaid calcinations, in regard they signify theoperation of Venus. It is therefore through the fire of the extraction of the soulthat the spirit comes forth gently, understand me.” 73 Possibly these crypticinstructions may convey but little. Analyzed however in terms of the materialculled from an examination of comparative religion and in the light of modernpsychotherapeutic processes, we can I feel certain arrive at some knowledge ofthe technique proposed.The first and momentous problem is the interpretation of the decocting orcooking process required. The expressions of fire and heat are consistentthroughout all hermetic writing. And always we find Sulphur mentioned inconnection with this Secret Fire. Like all the other alchemical terms, Sulphur isambiguously and allegorically defined. The Golden Tract in The HermeticMuseum defines it as “nothing but mature mercury.” 74 That is to say, by theabove mode of interpretation, a well-developed, mature, and concentrated"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"mind. Elsewhere we find such definitions of Sulphur as: “The fat of themercurial wind joined to the scum of the red sea.” 75 “Our fire is the truesulphur of Gold.” 76 Raymond Lully asserts: “When we say that the Stone isgenerated by fire, men neither see, neither do they believe there is any other firebut the common fire, nor any other Sulphur and Mercury but the commonSulphur and Mercury 77 ... If thou shalt work with too strong a fire, thepropriety of our spirit, which is indifferent as yet to life or death, will separateitself from the body, and the soul will depart to the region of her own sphere.”While Thomas Vaughan writes illuminatingly in Lumen de Lumine: “It is—asthey describe it—moist and invisible. Hence they have called it the horse’sbelly or horse dung—a moist heat but no fire that is visible.” 78 And in his AulaLucis he adds: “Our fire then is a natural fire; it is vaporous, subtle, andpiercing, it is that which works all in all, if we look on physical digestions; noris there anything in the world that answers to the stomach and performs theeffects thereof but this one thing. It is a substance of propriety solar andtherefore sulphureous. It is prepared, as the philosophers tell us, from the olddragon, and in plain terms, it is the fume of Mercury—not crude but cocted.” 79At least two possible renditions are here open to us. First of all, we oftenspeak of the fiery penetrative quality of the mind on any problem, we obtain oursolution. A burning up of that problem is a colloquial description of the result.Such colloquialisms are so true in fact that they have been universally adoptedby mankind and have passed into current speech. Possibly, the instrumentinvolved in producing the first effects of the work is a species of freeassociation or meditation. The mind must be turned in on to itself.Consciousness must be heightened and cocted or cooked.What do we mean by cooking? Let us imagine that we have a psychologicalpatient in the consulting room reclining on the divan, and we ask him toassociate on this term. Varied ideas are brought up. First of all there will arisea distinct sexual association. We have to face this—regardless of howunpleasant it may seem to some people. It has to be faced calmly and acceptedin all its implications."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Cooking is a term often used to indicate coitus, and the act of instigatingfertilization. The vernacular is full of vulgar expressions centering aboutcopulation and cooking. However vulgar and offensive they are, there isinformation of great value for us here. The vernacular is of the same type ofexpression as is dream language, and the language of mythology and alchemy.Hence colloquial expressions tell a very great deal to those who will look forthem. But to learn that cooking represents sexual intercourse does not help usvery much where alchemy is concerned. It may be an interesting fact, but afterall it is not particularly useful.Transferring the basic idea to the subjective level of interpretation, we see itmay pertain to an attempt to render the mind fertile and pregnant. Coitus is anaffair between male and female animals and humans. In terms of consciousnessthen, the mind becomes fertile or pregnant because of the dynamic action withinitself of its own positive and negative elements, the male and female latentwithin itself. It refers to the union of consciousness with its own anima orfeminine side.Not only so, but cooking as applied to food is an art having for its object thepreparation of that food for human consumption. The emphasis is onpreparation. It is a preparation by which apparently unpalatable or crude oruninteresting items of food are transformed by culinary skill into delicious anddelectable viands consumed for our pleasure and welfare.So also consciousness by skill and art is to be prepared—transformed fromits former crude entity into a divine center of light and power. It must beprepared so that the contents of the “essence of mind which is intrinsicallypure,” the underlying basis of consciousness normally latent, may arise to thesurface.Since writing the above passage, there recently came my way an interestingconfirmation of this piece of speculation. In one of the current popular monthlyjournals, I came across an article on popular psychology by Robert R.Updegraff, dealing with the conscious use of the so-called Subconscious mind.Updegraff expressed the idea that the process of thinking is strangely akin to theprocess of cooking. He goes on to say: “Although direct heat is ordinarily used,"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"many dishes are better after long, slow cooking. To permit this, some rangeshave fireless ovens in which the cooking is completed with retained heat.” 80“The subconscious mind is a fireless cooker into which we can put ourproblems to finish the cooking on what might be called ‘retained thought.’ To doall of our mental cooking with our conscious minds is to burn mental energywastefully, and at high cost to our nervous systems ... The cooking processmust first be started by focusing our minds on this material long and intentlyenough to get it thoroughly heated with our best conscious thinking.” 81Failing contact with this inner revitalizing source of life, consciousnessbecomes sterile due to the terrible and prodigal waste of mental energyneedlessly. Because of the death of vitality that it receives, and because ofrepressed psychic material harbored in the Unconscious where, owing to thedynamic quality of the latter, it develops explosive tendencies, the ego tendstowards disintegration. It does so because it is also separated from its ownstem and root.It is to be understood that this species of involuntary disintegration is entirelydifferent from that which the alchemists labor to produce. In the one case it isunconscious and automatic—a psychotic development. In the other it isdeliberately induced with conscious intent. And being consciously induced, itoccurs with a knowledge of the laws that govern the psyche, thus eliminatingundue danger and tension. To prevent tension and psychic explosion is theobvious reason why the mind’s root or essence must be found, laid bare,understood, and cultivated into open expression and manifestation.Sulphur is thus the dynamic vital side of the Self, its spirit considered not somuch in terms of any aspect of consciousness or mind as of energy and activity.It is the libido, the power and active side of the psyche, the energy which mustbe released from the primordial deeps. Without the activated cooperation ofthis libido, which is the secret alchemical fire, nothing can be done to reducethe Stone, the egoic consciousness, to its divine Water in order to produce thefirst solution. Nor, without this fire, can the ego be coagulated into the re-formed personality, the precious jewel of mythology, with its transformed senseof values."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"It is well known that, in the beginning, meditation exercises are fatiguing. Andat first also, before students become aware of their own limitations andcapabilities, they strain entirely too much. So great an effort to restrain the mindto a consideration of only one idea is wearying. The brain is unaccustomed,despite the advantages of a good education, to such acute strain and effort, andthere is a high mortality rate, so to say, amongst the brain cells. It is alwaysinsisted upon by all the authorities that meditation should commence easily andslowly, without too strenuous a forcing, otherwise severe damage is done toboth brain and mind. It is as though too keen a heat burned up the cells. Hencethe admonition of all the texts. Let the heat be gentle and temperate at first. If itis otherwise then the flower of consciousness, the intellect and the powers ofreason, developed by nature after long evolutionary effort, may becomedestroyed or, at any rate, impaired. These are precisely those faculties to beretained as being the very flower and summit, so far, of the evolutionaryprocess. As concentration is obtained and one-pointedness develops throughpersistent effort and training, the libido or vital stress normally resident in theUnconscious is activated, welling up to the surface to heat or stir up thecontents of the mind.This gave Geber reason to say, to quote our text, that all perfection issublimation. So far as psycho-therapy is concerned, Georg Groddeck the veryeminent German psychologist, has said, that in reality we are not ultimatelyconcerned in bringing up memories from the Unconscious. This is theimpression most people have of analysis, but this is false. What we areconcerned with primarily is the elimination of resistance. This is certainly true,and experience corroborates Groddeck’s impression. For what occurs whenresistances have been eliminated? Simply that libido rises from the depths ofthe Unconscious and floods or illuminates the higher aspects of the psyche.Thus, this would be tantamount to a real sublimation—a subliming of the libidofrom the lowest levels of being to those of a higher self-consciousness plane.An exaltation of every mental faculty then follows as the mental horizonbecomes exceedingly enlarged, if only because a large field of memory hithertocut off is made once more accessible to the ego. Conflicts latent in"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"consciousness become resolved because the libido flow is drained away fromthem into the open sphere of egoic control, and. mental tensions are eased andeliminated.The heating produces, as its first resultant, what the alchemists were prone toterm “putrefaction.” Putrefaction is simply chemical change. They imply by thisbut little more than a breaking down of sterile and inflexible mental habits, andthe onset of an intellectual change of viewpoint, a transformation of nature.Because of this psychic change, a breaking up of the stereotyped and habit-bound and crystallized ego-consciousness is induced by the activation of thedynamic content of the Unconscious. A new point of view, with all that such achange implies, comes to birth. It is an attempt towards a transvaluation of alllife’s values.Not only, however, is there demanded a heightening of the intellectualfaculties by means of meditative processes—a pronouncedly one-sided change,but the other parts of man’s nature are to be exercised. The emotional andfeeling constituents of the psyche must be stimulated considerably.Emphatically the text states that the various alchemical operations signify theoperation of Venus. We find frequent mention elsewhere of the doves of Venus.In another text we are counselled to bathe the Son in the bath of the innocentswith Venus, the bride.Venus is the goddess of Nature, at once the mind conjures up images of woodsand forests, of fields and meadows, of flowers and plants, and all green things.Green somehow for us indicates Nature in all her implications. In SplendorSolis, Salomon Trismosin, a 16th Century alchemist has said that thePhilosopher’s Stone is produced by “the Greening and Growing Nature.” 82Hali, another alchemist of a much earlier date, says that “This Stone rises ingrowing greening things.” 83 These expressions are very significant and worthpondering over. Growing and greening things can only imply Nature itself, wholike the wise and lovely artist that she is, bedecks herself in gowns andlacework of the loveliest greens. Due to long and pleasant associations, Naturefor us is Green, and both may be symbolized by Venus."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"From the study of mythology it is also admissible to apply a psychologicalinterpretation to its content. We may identify the various Gods and Goddessesof myth and legend with principles or primordial archetypes of instinct inheringwithin the human psyche. And we know from her behavior in such myths that tothe Greeks Venus represented the faculties of love and feeling and emotion. Sheis what Jung would call a typical anima figure. When such a figure occurs in aman’s dream or fantasy, or artistic creation, which one and all emerge from theUnconscious creative depths of the psyche, we would interpret it along generallines as being a dramatic projection of his emotional and feeling nature, hisfeminine self. Some psychologists identify it with the object of the primordialincest complex—the mother imago.Moreover, emotional faculties such as these often have a fiery significancecolloquially. How often do we not speak of the fire of love, for example? Poetshave always employed such eloquent expressions as “fiery ardor,”“unquenchable flames of desire,” “the white heat of passion” and many othersimilar phrases. Hence we may gather that the emotional fire, so far from beingneglected or suppressed, must be employed in conjunction with the intellectualfire. The latter would be sterile and meaningless were it not dynamized andsustained by the passion and force of the emotions. These two psychic functionsor aspects of the psyche considered together, obviously refer to the engine ormeans to be employed in the production of the changes already described."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"VenusFrom the psychological point of view, therapeutic analysis is an intellectualsurvey of the emotional life tending towards an ultimate acceptance of bothintellectuality and emotion. That is, both sides of human nature are to beconsidered as opposite but necessary constituents of the psyche, the play ofpolarities so imperative to the maintenance of life itself. When such anacceptance occurs, at once there is a vast increase in the individual’s powerand vitality—quite apart from the sense of freedom from inner problems whichresults and the renewed ability to handle life more decisively and efficiently. Itseems that a denial of any one phase of life or any rejection of a particularfunction of the psyche causes the vital flow, the libido, to return inward uponitself, to lie unused in the depths of the unconscious. It is unable to flowoutwards to objects and people of the external world, or to penetrate the normalactivities of the personality. As soon, however, as a philosophical corrective isemployed, and life is really accepted as actually it is—and not as the fantasythat we fondly would like it to be—then the flow of life and spirit is enhanced.The idea of acceptance is a fundamental psychological concept. Not onlypsychological, but I may add religious too. For at the bottom of religiousphilosophy it is assumed that the universe and man is the creation of a perfect"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"God. Consequently everything that exists must exist for a special purpose andhave its own proper place. The more unconditionally that mankind accepts thatscheme the more it will tend to accept the creation of God. Obviously thehappier it will be.Actually this is psychologically valid, however much one may be inclined tospurn the religious point of view. The neurotic is one who cannot accept eitherhis environment or himself. He is forced to repress one side of himself or toflee from a certain aspect of life. As a result he is in a state of severe conflict—which is to say in a state in which happiness is conspicuous by its absence. Toovercome this sad state of affairs, the individual must learn to see that beforeany changes can be engineered in the environment, he has to accept it asactually it is. The order of his life must be an unconditional acceptance ofreality in its widest sense. There must be no aspect or phase of life which heseeks to reject because of fear, a pseudo-idealism or a false spiritualphilosophy. Nothing in life is ugly. All fits into a scheme.This idea was excellently borne out by a dream of a patient of mine. I hadbeen endeavoring to make this individual realize that he would never be happyuntil he accepted himself and the environment in which he found himself. Forsome while it seemed that we were making little or no progress. He wasstubborn, displaying a high degree of resistance. Then one day he brought alongthis dream:“I am stopping in somewhere for breakfast. A woman is sitting at anothertable, ready to serve the food. I ask her what there is, and she shows me a dishof macaroni. I do not care much for the stuff—but tell her to give me some.When my plate is before me I see that it is filled with turkey—much more than Ican eat.”It requires no psychologist to divine the meaning of this dream. It is evenunnecessary to analyze each individual symbol, though to do so does yieldinteresting and significant material. But the most obvious meaning of the dreamwas so significant so far as the immediate analysis was concerned, thatspontaneously my patient saw the idea. The effect that it had upon him wastremendous. He accepted himself and his work instead of attempting to run"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"away from it as he had been conniving to do in all sorts of ways for the pastthirty years. Strange to say he found himself supremely happy in that task. It didnot seem duty or work to go to his professional office every day; it had beentransformed into sheer pleasure.The meaning is transparent. With acceptance there is a rare and beautifultransformation of life. It is an inner attitude towards life which is worthcultivating, for then one finds oneself working with and cooperating withNature instead of opposing her. To oppose her is a thankless task, one bound toeventuate in disaster. But to attempt to cooperate in every conceivable waywith her is to find that one lives life, that behind one there comes as a supportthe whole of the inertia of the universe. Where in such a case could there besadness, unhappiness or failure?The one major, though elementary, phenomenon of any meditative process isthe considerable increase of vitality that it appears to foster. As the art ismastered and as meditation deepens and becomes more profound, tremendousstreams of power and vitality are made conscious. So tremendous are thesestreams as almost to appear incredible. In the Hindu systems such a power istermed Kundalini-shakti. A fascinating and intricate technique for thestimulation and arousing of this power has been developed in the East. TheGnostic literature of the early Christian era terms it the Speirema, and inHebrew Qabalistic literature it appears under the guise of the Serpent. It istermed the Dragon in alchemical works, it being frequently portrayed withwings, or devouring its own tail. Symbolically, such a power is supposed toreside at the base of the spine—a surrogate symbol of the Unconscious depths,physiologically portrayed—whence as meditation proceeds it ascends to thebrain. On its passage upwards to the cerebral centers, it awakens dormantintellectual and spiritual faculties, whilst its arrival at the brain coincides withillumination and religious exaltation of a very high order. In Egyptian vignettes,and on some of the God-forms of the ancient Egyptians, we often find a littleserpent or Uraeus, perched as it were on the forehead between the eyes. Whilstabove the head on these forms is often shown the Solar disc, representing thatthey are Light and Light-bestowers."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"In a remarkably erudite piece of research, The Apocalypse Unsealed byJames M. Pryse, gives a definition of Kundalini which bears quoting in thisconnection: “Semi-latent within this pneumatic ovum is the paraclete, the lightof the Logos which in energizing becomes what may be described as living,conscious electricity, of incredible voltage and hardly comparable to the formof electricity known to the physicist. This is the ‘good serpent’ of ancientsymbology; and, taken with the pneumatic ovum, it was also represented in thefamiliar symbol of the egg and the serpent. It is called in the Sanskrit writingsKundalini, the annular or ringform force, and in the Greek speirema, theserpent coil. It is this force which, in the telestic work, or cycle of initiation,weaves from the primal substance of the auric ovum upon the ideal form orarchetype it contains, and conforming thereto, the immortal Augoeides, or solarbody (soma heliakon), so-called because in its visible appearance it is self-luminous like the sun, and has a golden radiance.” 84In Tibet, the Knowledge of this inner force and the means of its stimulation,has led in several curious directions. One of the most interesting and significantto our present enquiry is the so-called Psychic Heat. Consider the climate ofthis land. A plateau, it is considerably over 10,000 feet above sea level—insome places about 18,000 feet. The entire country is covered in winter with iceand snow. Climatic conditions must be very rigorous and severe. Yet, despitethis, we know that anchorites and monks live on these snow-capped heightsclad only in a single cotton gown. In some instances they have been seen naked.How are they able to survive these frigid conditions of such intense severity,especially when the meals partaken by them are so very meager and sparse?We know they follow a special system of mental and psychic trainingwhereby, through the powers of the inturned mind and the visualizing faculty,the latent serpent power is aroused into full and dynamic activity. Special formsof breathing likewise constitute an integral part of this training. It is commonexperience even in our climate that several minutes of deep and full breathingwill, because of the increased oxygenization of the blood, produce copiousperspiration and a marked sense of warmth. How much more marked wouldthis not become with a more perfectly developed technique? The Tibetan monks"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"and lamas have carried this idea a great deal further than ever we have deemedto be possible. The following is a quotation from Mme. Alexandra David-Neel’s work With Mystics and Magicians in Tibet, dealing with just such atechnique: “The novice must begin his training each day before dawn, andfinish the special exercises relating to tumo (the psychic heat) before sunrise ...Various breathing drills are first performed which aim at clearing the passageof the air in the nostrils. Then pride, anger, hatred, covetousness, sloth,stupidity, are mentally rejected with the rhythmic breathing out. All blessingsfrom saintly beings, the Buddha’s spirit, the five wisdoms, all that is good andlofty in the world are attracted and assimilated while drawing in the breath.Now, composing oneself for a while one dismisses all cares and cogitations.”85 Then several exercises are followed, in which letters and mystic forms areformulated in certain parts of the body. “The exercise goes on, through tenstages, but one must understand that there exist no pause between them. Thedifferent subjective visions, as well as the sensations which accompany them,succeed each other in a series of gradual modifications. Inhalations, retentionsof the breath and expirations continue rhythmically, and a mystic formula iscontinually repeated. The mind must remain perfectly concentrated and one-pointed on the vision of the fire and the sensation of warmth which ensues ...Sometimes a kind of examination concludes the training of the tumo students.Upon a frosty night, those who think themselves capable of victoriouslyenduring the test are led to the shore of a river or a lake. If all the streams arefrozen in the region, a hole is made in the ice. A moonlight night, with a hardwind blowing, is chosen. Such nights are not rare in Tibet during the wintermonths. The neophytes sit on the ground, cross-legged and naked. Sheets aredipped in the icy water, each man wraps himself in one of them and must dry iton his body. As soon as the sheet has become dry, it is again dipped in thewater and placed on the novice’s body to be dried as before. The operationgoes on in that way until daybreak. Then he who has dried the largest number ofsheets is acknowledged the winner of the competition. It is said that some dryas many as forty sheets in one night.” 86"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The above obtains corroboration from Dr. Evans-Wentz who has written withunderstanding and erudition on these matters in his scholarly work TibetanYoga and Secret Doctrines, published by the Oxford University Press.87All this material is not needlessly quoted. It casts a very valuable light on thenature of the alchemical secret fire. It gives us some notion of what it was thatthe alchemists sought to perform. That they had any intention of developing theso-called psychic heat, it hardly behooves me to deny. Such a feat was notnecessary here. Climatic conditions in Europe had not rendered this imperativeto their spiritual welfare. But that they were deeply interested in the kundalinior the libido or its equivalents, and the spiritual phenomena that followed uponits arousal, there can be no manner of doubt. The caution that they employed intheir writings and the enigmatical nature of the obscurities and cryptic passagesin which they delighted became transparent once given the necessary key. Eventhe fear of personal persecution assumes second place in the light of the above.Fear of abuse and the personal danger to an unwise practitioner are far moretelling and significant reasons. However, they have interspersed clues,innumerable clues of an eloquent nature, in their writings.

Apart from the foregoing interpretations along psychological and meditativelines, then, there is yet a third line of enquiry which may yield us significantmaterial in connection with this mystery. In a former work, The Philosopher’sStone, I devoted a great deal of space to a more or less lengthy consideration ofthe historical antecedents of hypnotism. For centuries prior to the discoveriesof physicians such as Braid and Bernheim, a form of therapy was practiced inEurope based upon the supposed transmission of a vital flaw from operator tosubject or patient. Mesmer, who was the 18th Century exponent of thistechnique with which his name has subsequently become associated, was butone of many who had employed it. He was very largely responsible forbringing its ideology once more before the attention of the scientific world.That the latter completely rejected his claims and theories is of very little creditto that world, or of very little concern to our present enquiry. Modern researchhas achieved much in demonstrating the validity of certain of his ideas.Principal amongst these is the fact that emanations of a subtle magnetic kind doissue forth from a human frame. I refer the interested reader to Dr. BernardHollander’s Hypnotism and Self Hypnotism,88 a very able work where thesedebatable doctrines are quite fully discussed.Now it is the hypothesis of a quite recent expositor of the alchemical mysterythat for an explanation of the Secret Fire of the Wise we must look to themesmeric art. It is claimed that the transmission of vital power is a valid andtangible activity—one that not only can be demonstrated but can be taught and"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"mastered by any individual of average intelligence and vitality. Personally I cansubstantiate this claim. Study and experience with this power over a number ofyears have enabled me to develop a technique, startling in its simplicity,precisely to this end. My little book The Art of True Healing 89 delineates atherapeutic method based upon just such an internal stimulation of vitalcurrents.The theory is based upon the empirical fact that any faculty grows by repeateduse. Not only so but that power increases its potency and efficiency throughutilization. Hence, argue the proponents of this hypothesis, repeated efforts totransmit this magnetic power by an effort of will, aided by manual passes, fromone person to another will eventually stimulate to an inconceivable extent thequantity of such a force. Nor is this all. For if the subject be stimulated toassume on occasion the active role of operator and project his own powerbackwards on the former operator, who for the time being acts as a passiverecipient, a vast increase in magnetism is affected. In a word, if power bethrown from A to B, and then back from B to A, the whole process beingrepeated frequently over a long period of time, the unconscious depths of bothexperimenters become considerably activated, freeing very considerably thelibido currents in both parties. This is a matter of common experimental work,and need not be taken as a dogmatic statement.What confronts us now is the possible psychological effect of such atransmission. We have several analogies available to assist us. The first I havealready discussed. That is to say that certain simple breathing exercisesproduce an astonishing degree of internal heat and vitality within the space of avery few minutes. This can be developed with time and practice, in thedirection of the Tibetan tumo, the production of the psychic heat to withstandthe force of the elements. It may also be developed into a psycho-spiritualtechnique for the arousing of what the Hindus call the kundalini, the serpentpower, the coiled up or latent libido, stored in the base of the spine. As thisserpent uncoils and rises, moving slowly towards the brain, various states ofheightened consciousness are revealed, culminating in a species of kineticillumination as the brain is enlivened."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"I have suggested elsewhere that there is indeed a similarity between theeffects of Pranayama, the breathing exercises developed by the Orientals witha view to awakening the serpent power, and the willed mesmeric transmissionof vital power. In the one case, the technique is adapted to the Easterner whohas time at his disposal and possesses patience as an integral part of hispsychological constitution. The second method is an intentional developmentfor the Westerner who is endowed with but little patience, and because of theeconomic conditions in which he has been placed, has but little more time.According to the oriental theory, vitality or prana or spirit exists all aroundus, we being bathed in it as a fish in the sea. Consequently the breathingexercises undertaken are so many efforts to open the personality to the ever-present surrounding ocean of power, so that the practitioner becomes a speciesof sponge absorbing the life about him. When saturation point is reached, thepower becomes kinetic and exerts an influence upon the human sponge whichhas absorbed it. To master this technique thoroughly, so that concentration of themind is induced and illumination floods the mind, requires months and perhapsyears of daily practice. This manifestly, for the average Occidental, required bycircumstance to attend to family and business matters, is quite impossible. Thetechnique as such cannot be transported here nor adopted by the European withimpunity.On the other hand, through the concerted use of imagination and will, withoutany special or complex breathing exercises, the individual may open himselfvery considerably to an astonishing influx of power from all about him,augmenting his own store of power. Then the prana latent in one individual maybe communicated, in some small measure at least, to a second. When sotransmitted, inasmuch as power awakens or tends to produce power, it awakensa response in the psyche of the subject. The response elicited is a very slightincrease of the subject’s own vitality, as though the power, penetrating thebody-mind system, awakened the libido dormant in the psychic deeps. Whenthis slight increase of libido or prana, as well we may define it, is returned on alater occasion to the former operator, a similar reaction is induced. Eventuallya very high potential or voltage is produced which must resemble the kinetic"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"quality of Kundalini awakened by pranayama and the psychic states that thelatter produces.The results achieved by psychotherapeutic or analytical methods in individualcases where a freed libido has resulted, present a useful analogy. In the firstplace a marked sense of freedom from endopsychic problems and perplexitiesis the immediate outcome. Furthermore the hard and fast barriers erectedbetween the different constituents of the psyche become broken down, and anintegrity of consciousness is achieved. In short, the usual psychological resultsare obtained.What concerns me in this enquiry is whether or not such a mesmeric orhypnotic freeing of libido would correspond in any way with the preliminarydissolution which the alchemists posit as the first stage of their work. We knowalready that one of the stages of freeing libido by the psychotherapeuticmethods is distinctly unsettling. The girders or hinges of the mind becomeloosened. The old complexes, broken up as the ego perceives their falsity aspractical solutions or adaptations to life and their inadequacy to every-dayproblems, dissipate themselves as autonomous constellations of idea andfeeling in the psyche. But prior to the full development of a mature adult pointof view there is no little suffering and emotional disturbance entailed. Thepsyche is obliged to adapt itself to a species of self-immersion. It gives up itsformerly accepted standards. It sacrifices itself. “Whoso loseth his life shallfind it.” The ego dies in a mystical death. In a sense this must correspond to thealchemical dissolution we are considering.As the libido tends towards an untrammeled freedom of expression by meansof the so-called “work of the hands” or the “manual work,” which crypticexpressions we may quite reasonably associate with the mesmeric transmissionof prana, consciousness undergoes the change we spoke of. When the saturationpoint, so to speak, is reached in the beginning, a trance state is produced. Thepatient is plunged into a condition in which the ordinary every-day faculties ofthe ego undergo an eclipse. The focus of attention seems now shifted altogetherto another level, with new memories and new points of view. The bodybecomes relaxed and released from muscular tensions. Slow and deep is the"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"breathing and the pulse drops several beats to an even measured pace. Thefacial expression alters, becoming immobile and peaceful, whilst quite often anappearance even of ecstasy makes itself apparent. It is as though consciousnesswere transported out of itself into a higher and nobler sphere, where no longerits equanimity is perturbed and unduly disturbed by the petty problems of theobjective world. In this highly concentrated state, suggestions may easily beimplanted into the fertile mind of the subject. Not only so, but various abnormalor unusual faculties make their appearance. Clairvoyance, telepathy andcommunity of sense and emotion are phenomena which have been observed tooccur by careful and trained scientific investigators.Possibly you may be one of those who mock at this sort of statement anddecry the fact that such statements can be made. All I ask here is an honestapproach and a willingness to recognize and accept such facts wherever theymay be found. However one may regard hypnotism, the fact remains thathypnotic therapy and psychical research is as valid and as verifiable a body ofknowledge as any other science. This statement I challenge any critic to refuteor deny—honestly, decently, and intelligently. A host of scientific men, ofextraordinary intellectual caliber and scientific patience and inventiveness,from Sir William Crookes to Dr. Hereward Carrington of the AmericanPsychical Institute of the present day, including Professor William James andSir Oliver Lodge, and a host of other celebrities, have contributed a mass ofverified evidence which serves as the basis for my statements and assumptions.When finally the subject is permitted to return to his normal self, he usuallyretains but little awareness of this deeper level of consciousness, nor of whathas transpired during the trance state. But with training and practice andrepeated suggestion this difficulty may readily be overcome. The result is thatthe two poles of consciousness may be united and integrated and the horizon ofthe ego considerably enlarged. By these means we achieve what is the goal ofall mystical and occult and even psychological systems—making conscious thatwhich formerly was unconscious. It is to widen the scope of consciousnesswhich is the end of these many systems."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"In alternating the roles of operator and subject, and the states of trance andwilled projection of magnetism, a rounded development of the psyche issecured. The dangers, though slight, and usually very much exaggerated in thelay mind, both of passivity and the aggressiveness of the power complex, arethus avoided. And the effect of the vast increase of power playing onconsciousness is incalculable. It is soon bound to dispel the neurotic cleavagewithin the personality, and to destroy the crystallization induced through theundue domination of habit, custom, and hypocritical convention. We have here,it is contended, a most suggestive interpretation to these alchemicalcryptograms, as we may term them, and an explanation of the many obscurereferences and technical terms.Closely allied to this hypothesis there is another scheme which, frompersonal experience, has been more than useful in assisting me to come to abetter understanding of alchemical processes.The cornerstone of my professional practice, so to say, rests upon the art ofrelaxation. I have always assumed it to be imperative to any patient that I mayhave that he learn how to relax every muscle and fiber at will. We are allfamiliar with mechanical and chemical methods of producing a state ofrelaxation. A warm bath, a hot drink, a nightcap, massage, a soft springy bed—all of these tend to induce a relaxing of the almost constant tension to whichmost of us are subject. The chiropractors, likewise, have devised an excellentmechanical method of relaxation by means of basic pressures upon sensitivepoints of the ilium and sacrum which are the points of origin and insertion ofthe powerful spinal muscles. As a result of these pressures, the musculatureabout the spine is automatically released from contraction. But none of theseare, finally, of much practical and lasting avail to the average individual. He isunable to induce relaxation at the very moment when he wants it withoutresorting to the aid of another person or thing.A relaxation that is true, in the deepest sense of the word, is one that must beself-induced. One must be able at any moment—whether riding in the car orsubway, sitting in the chair in one’s office, or enjoying a play in the theatre—"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"deliberately to let go of muscular and nervous tension, and let the body fadeinto oblivion.This, you may add, is certainly a desirable state—but is it one that is readilyattainable? It is, and very easily so. At first one may require the assistance of asecond person in order to have one’s own unconscious somatic tension calledto one’s attention. Afterwards, however, one realizes oneself to be more of amaster in one’s own household, and that therefore the body may be made torespond to one’s wish and will. The basic technique has been ably delineatedby Annie Payson Call in her excellent treatise Power Through Repose.90 In thatwork she has entered into the intricacies of relaxation development, andexplained for what reasons she considers it to be so necessary. In the main, I amin complete agreement with her.But I should like to see the system outlined by her developed still further,extended into another realm. What do I mean by this? First of all, we have torealize that the energy we use up in organic functioning is obtained, when all issaid and done, from the food that we consume. It may not be generally realizedthat the specific amount of energy required to run the different parts of the bodyhas already been experimentally verified and measured. For example, we findthat L. Jean Bogert, Instructor in Experimental Medicine at Yale University, hasasserted that “Metabolism is a term used to cover those chemical changes in thetissues by means of which the body gets energy out of food or tissue material.Only about one fourth of this energy needed for the internal work of the bodygoes for the activities of the various organs, while the greater part is usedfor life processes in the cells and for maintaining the tone of the muscleswhich, waking or sleeping, are never completely relaxed.” 91 (The italics aremine).A certain amount of this energy goes to maintain the various physiologicalfunctions of the body—dealing with excretion, secretion, reparation,reproduction, transmission of motor and sensory impulses, nutrition, growth andheat production in certain quite definite amounts. A larger amount goes intomaintaining muscular tension which, as Bogert observes, is never completelyrelaxed. The greater part of this energy is totally wasted in maintaining"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"muscular tensions which are completely unnecessary in every way. Theabdominal and cervical muscles of the average individual are not only in aconstant state of contraction, but he is actually unable to release that tensionwhen he wishes to do so. Thigh and leg muscles are similar cases in point.Tensions become habitual, and habits soon become unconscious.The object of the art of relaxation is so to train the individual that he maywithdraw the energy continually pouring along the nerve channels into thesemuscles and organs, thus achieving a state of rest. I may say that mostindividuals upon achieving this for the first time, sink swiftly into a state ofheavy sleep. Later, as they become more habituated to this new state of bodilyfreedom, they remain wide awake and alert even although their bodies arecompletely still and the normal channels of nervous expenditure in abeyance.Skill in the art is achieved principally through consciousness. The theory isthat by becoming aware of the tensions present in the body it is possible torelieve that tension. In order so to become aware, it is necessary to have asecond person present to raise and drop one’s arms and legs. The limbs aredeliberately and slowly raised in order to make one aware of the stiffness thatis normally afflicting them. Having become conscious of these stiff places—principally neck, abdomen, hips and thighs, one may alone use one’simagination as the principal means of achieving the desired condition of perfectrest.There are two principal techniques requiring the application of theimagination. One calls for the visualization of the musculature, the other of theblood-system. Both are very simple.While I do not wish to make this a handbook on the art of relaxation,nevertheless it is urgent to make a sufficiently full statement to render myconclusions clear and logical. Lying flat on his back, one attempts to visualizethe muscles in different parts of the body to look like the loose strands of askein of wool. Obtain a skein of ordinary darning wool, and dangle it in the air.This will give you the best impression of the result to be envisaged. Then,beginning with the feet, imagine the muscles of the tarsus and ankle beingcomposed solely of several skeins of wool, with each strand perfectly free and"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"loose, without tautness or stiffness of any kind. In a few seconds, possibly acouple of minutes, a distinct sensation may be experienced of warmth andtingling, accompanied by a perceptible relaxing of parts. Here is no suggestionor hallucination. It is an experience as real as that of reading this book. Extendthe same idea to the calf, thighs, different sections of the trunk, neck and head.Ease is obtained in a very short while, and a relaxation develops which isperfectly startling in the pleasure and feeling of newly won freedom thatunexpectedly it evokes.The second method likewise uses of the imagination, but demands thevisualizing of the various organs of the body being saturated by blood. Weknow from general pathology that where there is congestion of blood, there isheat; this heat causes relaxation of tissue. It is a well-authenticatedphysiological principle moreover, that to think of any part of the body is toproduce an increased flow of blood. We have only to think of food, and there isan increased flow of blood to the stomach with an accelerated secretion fromthe glands supplying the gastro-intestinal tract. Let a stray thought of sexualindulgence or eroticism cross the mind, and at once a marked vascularstimulation of the genitalia develops. If an individual not used to complimentsbe made aware of the beauty of her face and form, very soon the phenomenon ofblushing may be observed. These common facts being quite well known, wemay apply them practically by quiet reflection upon our viscera andmusculature to the end that there will be increased vascularization andenervation accompanied by relaxation. Hence we proceed by visualizing thebrain first of all. Soon there is sensation there. One becomes aware of the brainas a fact of personal experience. This realization is to be succeeded byimagining that blood flows downwards from that brain to eyes, nose, ears andmouth. Continue with the rest of the body in this way until the tips of the toeshave been concentrated upon and thus vascularized. The state of relaxation thatthen ensues is very marked, and can be tested instrumentally. Blood pressureshows a decided fall; pulse rate and temperature likewise have been noted torespond."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"The practical value of all this so far as our thesis here is concerned is verysimple. If a very tense person begins to apply such a relaxation technique towithdraw from the body this energy that otherwise would have been prodigallywasted, what happens to this energy? Prior to relaxation, this nervous energywas enervating nerves, muscles, arteries, veins and organs. But now a verylarge part—naturally not all, since the physiological functions still require to befulfilled—has been withdrawn, eliminating this constant tension. Where has itgone?Clearly there can be but one answer. It has sought another level of expression.Energy is energy, regardless of what plane it happens to manifest upon. Ifprevented or debarred from expression at one level of life, it will seekmanifestation on another. Moreover, let us remember that energy is life, and lifeis creative. “Life and more life” is the motto of living creatures. And anabundance of life and vitality is the typical characteristic of genius, no matterwhether he be religious, scientific, or artistic.Dammed up at one level, the physical level in this case, the energy regressesinwards to the psychological or spiritual level. Here it vitalizes the mind.Being creative as I have suggested, this pent-up energy instigates a process ofregeneration or re-creation of the entire personality. Slowly but surely itcommences to circulate in its own psychic sphere, awakening the dormantarchetypal images of the deepest strata of the Unconscious, eliminatingemotional and intellectual inflexibility, widening the sphere of consciousawareness, and stimulating the latent intuitive and creative powers that arewithin every individual.That such a process could occur at all, is a fact that is widely accepted.However, the rationale or the simplicity of it has, I believe, but rarely beenrealized. The alchemists did realize some such fact. Their entire speculations,for let us call them such for the time being, confirm the hypothesis that this vitalenergy in regressing to deeper psychological levels, transforms itself into acreative fire. The secret fire of the alchemists is none other than that prodigiousenergy which daily we handle, employ and, to our sorrow, waste. It is our ownlife. The cooking or decoction of which they so frequently and ambiguously"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"speak has various points of resemblance to what occurs in this relaxationtechnique. Energy, in being released from its habitual task of tensing musclesand viscera, turns inwards upon the mind and “cooks” it. A vitalization ofconsciousness then occurs. There is a conversion of the elements, to use thearchaic language. Moreover, because of this vitalization, the whole mentaloutlook upon life is changed, and there is a transformation of the mind.Let it also be noted that this transformation or conversion or “turning about”of the mind is the crucial experience of all religious systems—whether weconsider Christianity, Buddhism or Taoism, or any of the major religions of theworld. For example in one of the most interesting of the Mahayana Buddhisttexts, the Lankavatara Sutra, we read “the cessation of the discriminating mindcan not take place until there has been a ‘turning about’ in the deepest seat ofconsciousness. The mental habit of looking outward by the discriminating mindupon all external objective world must be given up, and a new habit ofrealizing Truth within the intuitive mind by becoming one with Truth itself mustbe established.” 92In his Commentary to The Secret of the Golden Flower, Jung also has a fewvery pertinent remarks to make in confirmation, I believe, of my hypothesis.Discussing the mystical experience always accompanied by the subjectivephenomenon of light, he remarks:“I know a few individuals who are familiar with this phenomenon frompersonal experience. As far as I have ever been able to understand it, thephenomenon seems to have to do with an acute condition of consciousness asintensive as it is abstract, a ‘detached’ consciousness which, as Hildegardepertinently remarks, brings up to consciousness regions of psychic eventsordinarily covered with darkness. The fact that in connection with this, thegeneral bodily sensations disappear, shows that their specific energy hasbeen withdrawn from them, and has apparently gone toward heightening theclearness of consciousness.” 93The mystical experience, whether we call it Samadhi with the Hindus, orSatori with the Zen Buddhists, or Union with God as supposed by the Christianmystics, is almost always accompanied by such a withdrawal of energy from"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"bodily function. I suggest that we can reverse the process. Withdraw energyfrom the body, and thus heighten consciousness. It is my contention that this, inone sense at any rate, is the alchemical supposition. It is at the root of the wholeof alchemical procedure. Sublimation is simply another word for it. Energy iswithdrawn from somatic processes and is sublimed to an inward spiritual state.Energy produces energy. And energy is life and creativity. The outcome canonly be transformation and transmutation.This, I again contend, is the archaic alchemical theory which is amplycorroborated by psychological practice in its widest and highest application.An examination of several alchemical treatises in the light of this particularhypothesis is bound to prove very illuminating.[contents]88.

Certain of the moredidactic treatises, in the course of their lengthy ramblings through open gatesand flower gardens and fairy palaces, refer to animals, birds, and other wildbeasts. The illustrations accompanying some of these texts depict lions, crows,eagles, pelicans, dragons and serpents. From the analytical experience that hasbeen garnered during the past thirty years, it has become possible to make anattempt in the direction of interpretation. We now know that these animals,whether they be painted by man or whether they appear spontaneously in dreamor fantastic creation, have reference to the libido, the vital spirit in man.Animals, to mankind, have always appeared to be creatures whose behavior isunmodified and unrestrained by considerations of duty, morality, or herd-consciousness. They represent moreover crude energy, power in anundifferentiated, undomesticated and uncontrolled state. What symbol then,could be mere eloquent for the unconscious in man, than that subtle dynamicenergy which motivates its life?Whilst the libido—the sulphur, or the secret fire, lies dormant in the deepest,most concealed levels of the Unconscious, the tendency of the psyche is toportray that condition as a dragon or serpent.There is a fundamental psychological law upon which we here have toreflect. If you are not altogether conscious of the dynamic interior principleswithin, their activity must appear to come from a source other than yourself. Ina word, from without, from your environment, and from the people in thatenvironment. Hence, if within your own being there is a vast store of energy ofenormous potential, what is happening to it? Unrecognizing it, you are unable to"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"use it. But it itself is active continually. The experiments in hypnotism andpsychical research will have indicated to the reader something of itstremendous power and capacity. Its effect upon us includes all those strange andmysterious events in our personal lives which we are not able to explain andwhich perturb us so deeply. Unused, it remains in a crude and undeveloped orundomesticated state. Its level is that of primitive men or beasts of a bygoneera. Thus it represents itself in our dreams as fantastic primitive beasts,horrible slimy creatures that awaken us out of the deepest slumber. Smallwonder the snake is little loved by man—quite apart from its poisonous andvenomous ways. We have unconsciously invested it with enormous affect. It hasbecome the symbol for us of our animal past and of its descendant—the animallying within. But we have to remember that the latter seems obviouslydangerous only when unrecognized and unused. In mythology this beast hasalways been susceptible of innumerable interpretations. “More subtle than anybeast of the field,” as Genesis puts it, the serpent was symbolical of divinewisdom. In fact, in the Grecian myths, the serpent was sacred to Athena, thegoddess of wisdom, more than a hint as to the true nature of the beast. The factalways that this animal was capable of shedding its skin, and still surviving,came to symbolize to the ancients that rebirth and resurrection were somehowassociated with it. Moreover it occurs quite frequently in dreams as a phallic orgenerative symbol—the spermatozoon being directly suggested, indicating itsrelationship with or expression through the sexual instinct. But the serpent iscapable of interpretation not only in sexual terms but also as representative ofpower and creative energy; of time and eternity when it is represented as acircular shape with its tail being swallowed by its mouth; of life, immortalityand regeneration. It is also of interest that in primitive religions, the Sun and theMoon gods were figured not only as a lion and lioness, bull and cow, etc., butalso as a male and female serpent. In alchemy it is more often used as agenerative symbol, as a symbol of the power that is capable of regenerating theindividual and manufacturing the philosopher’s stone.As the libido awakens, either through the psychotherapeutic methods, or bymeditation, or by the magnetic technique, it becomes volatile. That is to say, it"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"commences to penetrate the various levels of the psyche, infiltratingconsciousness as well as the bodily system. A new sense of power and vitalityis felt dynamizing the entire activity of man. Then the myth or dream-makingfaculty depicts this active state of the libido as an eagle or winged dragon or awinged lion. As with the progress of time, it becomes more volatile and moremanifest to consciousness, other symbols are used—such as a winged ruby-blood, or a phoenix feeding her young with her own life-blood, or a serpentbearing a crown, and many another.Winged Dragon Eating Its OwnTailEach of these symbols is more than expressive. Each one could be taken as atopic for meditation, or as the stimulus idea for free-association. By so doingthey would, by stimulating association tracks in the mind, awaken thosearchetypal co-relatives in consciousness corresponding to themselves. Justthink of the wealth of symbolism involved in the idea of a phoenix feeding heryoung. Each of us is that phoenix, and each is the litter of young ones. We eachhave to kill ourselves in order that the newly developing centers of life withinmay grow. The childhood state has to perish in order that the adult may growtherefrom. This is a new world—an exciting and thrilling world of vitalsymbolism—to enter.Colors likewise are variously employed to convey the extent of awakeningand the degree of vitality achieved. One of the most significant of thecombinations of color and animals in alchemical writing is the Green Lion. Itsometimes is asserted that the stage symbolized by such a figure is quite asimportant as the preliminary dissolution and the blackness of corruption. As thelibido or the vital spirit stirs in the psychic deeps, no matter through what"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"agency, it is often depicted in the authentic texts as such a Lion. The lion is anundomesticated animal, vigorous, large, swift and active, fierce and dangerous.Its color is given as green, because symbolically it is the color of unripeness, ofimmaturity, as well as of expectancy and hope of further growth. A greenhorn isone who is crude and naive, simple and unsophisticated. Green, as we havepreviously suggested, is the color of Nature. But it is the color of Nature only inthe dayspring of her youthful existence just after the Sun begins his journeynorthwards once more, and warmth and life returns to her loved ones. Actuallythe symbol depicts a half-way house, as it were, of the libido shortly afterawakening from its long drawn out sleep and prior to the achievement of itsfinal goal of maturity. One alchemist writer, the Vicar of Malden, quoted byElias Ashmole in the Theatrum Chemicum, says:It’s because of the transcendent forceIt hath; and for the rawness of its source,Of which the lyke is nowhere to be seene,That yt of us is named the Lyon Greene. 94The employment of colors proceeds much further than the example givenabove. The use is a curious one, permeating the whole of the literature. Our textemploys quite frequently a well-defined color scheme, and similar ones may befound elsewhere. In the Tractatus Aureus, Hermes gives instructions withregard to color, and in one place observes the following: “Extract from the rayits shadow and impurity, by which the clouds hang over it, defile and keepaway the light.” 95One of the early things the novice in meditation experiences when he closeshis eyes is the obscureness of inner vision. That is he perceives only anindeterminate mistiness within his head, the clouds and impurity of whichHermes speaks. As time goes on, the darkness seems to deepen and becomeblacker and more profound. Actually there is no such deepening of gloom at all.It is only his increase in self-awareness that makes the student conscious of thedarkness and heaviness that had hitherto clouded his mind, of the shadow andimpurity which conceal the ray from his sight. With continued effort the"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"darkness and the cloud lift. He becomes aware of an increasing airiness andluminosity in the brain, as though a light—the candle of vision—burned withinthe skull, permeating the whole sphere of sensation.So far as psychological analysis goes the effect upon the patient is equallydefinite. Whereas for most of us dreams are our experience in “another world,”a dream world which is vague and hazy, a marked clarity and definiteness beginto appear after some weeks or months of psychological work. No longer is thedream indistinct and grey in color. The whole experience becomes investedwith color and perspective and vivid reality with the firm realization that thenightly adventure in the empyrean is as “real” as any experience of normalwaking consciousness. And more so, for it becomes the dominant of thatconsciousness, producing effects in the outer objective world, and evolving aneffectual and satisfactory line of life. This too, is a result of the activation of thecontents of the mind by the libido. In mediaeval legends such an activation oflibido from fixation in outworn unconscious complexes, is depicted as the aura,or the halo that blazes up as a great flame from the roof of the hut in which asaint is lying in a state of ecstasy. In the faces of holy men, mankind has alwaysseen the sun of this power, the fullness of light. In the Old Testament, thismagical force shines in the burning bush. It appears in the Acts of the Apostles,in the pouring forth of the Holy Ghost from heaven in the form of tongues offlame.A warning is not out of place here. These mediaeval statements regarding theholy flame about the body are not to be construed only in a symbolical sense. Igrant the validity of symbolism. In fact I use it very largely and extensivelymyself. But I go further, expressing a fundamental belief in the actualexperience of such a flame. There are drawings in various of the alchemicalwritings which show flames and fire ascending the legs. How shall we construethis? Shall we say that this is symbolism only? Let us remember that the legsare symbols of the Unconscious itself, that on which we actually stand in apsychic sense. It supports us, and it stands under all our conscious intellectualand psychic activity. The fire is the libido ascending from the deeps into the"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"conscious levels of the psyche. Well, it is good symbolism. But we could bemore literal about it—even as the alchemists were.The libido is the fire; the prima materia, the first stuff of life, presenteverywhere in this world of ours. It has to be assimilated by being drawn intothe human body via the soles of the feet. In a large number of texts, whetherEuropean alchemical or Oriental texts, we find it said that one must learn tobreathe through the feet. In the feet, the libido, drawn up by means of the breathand by means of the disciplined mind, creates heat, the effect of which is socrucial in the spagyric art.But to find the libido manifesting within the brain as color and as lightrequires time and much effort. And the injunction of our text is particularlyappropriate in that it cautions the novice to “have great care at the beginningthat thou burn not its Flowers and its vivacity, and make not too much haste tocome to an end of thy work.” 96The result of eliminating the shadow and impurity from the ray, so that theLight may illuminate the mind, is that alterations occur in the colors of whatmust for convenience sake be termed the aura. This is not merely a legendaryappearance, but, briefly, is the magnetic or electrical field surrounding eachindividual. Its extent and texture depends entirely upon the state of mind of theperson, his moods, and his health. This idea is not altogether withoutconfirmation in recent years. Some years ago, Dr. Walter J. Kilner, lateelectrician to St. Thomas’s Hospital, London, published a book entitled TheHuman Atmosphere. In this book he claimed to have demonstrated the presenceof the aura by means of certain chemical slides or screens by means of whichanyone could see the aura surrounding the body, after a little experimentation.His theory was that, although the unaided human eye cannot see the aurabecause it lay just beyond the visible spectrum, it can nevertheless be broughtinto visibility by means of his dicyanin screens, which render the eyesusceptible to the wave-lengths composing the aura. Dr. Kilner himselfbelieved these to lie in the ultraviolet end of the spectrum.He came to believe that the aura, or the emanation from the body, has threedistinct portions. A dark line or band, about a quarter of an inch wide,"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"surrounded and was adjacent to the body. Around this was a misty,semiluminous strip, known as the inner aura, radiating outwards to a distance ofpossibly several inches from all parts of the body. The outer aura, commencingat the distal edge of the inner aura, extended outward into space for severalmore inches, and appeared to blend with the inner aura where the two mergedinto one another.The Human AuraKilner himself believed that “there cannot be the least doubt of the reality ofthe existence of an aura enveloping a human being, and this will in a short timebe universally accepted now that it can be made visible to nearly every personhaving normal eyesight ... Ninety five percent of people with normal eyesightcan see the aura ... At first sight the cloudlike appearance might suggest that theaura was some form of vapor. This is highly improbable ... the most probableinterpretation of the aura that at present can be given is that it is the outcome ofa force emanation from the body which (like all forces) is invisible, butbecomes perceptible through its action ... If the aura be the outcome of aphysical force proceeding from the body and acting on the surrounding medium,it would appear that external forces would influence it ... When the poles of a"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"horseshoe magnet, after the removal of the armature, are held from six to eightinches away from the body of a healthy person, the observer will almostimmediately be able to distinguish an increase of brilliancy of the aura at thepart of the body nearest the poles, and simultaneously the base projected fromthe poles of the magnet will become more conspicuous. This will in a fewseconds concentrate into a single streak or ray joining the body and the magnet,and will have the same width as the poles, including the space between them ...When, instead of a horseshoe, one pole of a bar-magnet is held a short distancefrom the body of a patient, a corresponding display will be produced, only lessobvious. As far as has yet been ascertained, neither pole of a magnet exerts agreater influence over the aura than the other. Consequently it is conjectured,that the aura is equally acted-upon by both poles of the magnet, and therefore,as far as magnetism is concerned, the aura does not possess any polarity. Themutual attraction of two auras belonging to different people is more intense thanthat between a magnet and the aura ... An electric brush held near the patientcauses the aura to increase in size ...” 97Colors, we know from practical experience, have different effects ondifferent people, as though in themselves they were tangible entities. Thealchemistic doctrine is that perfection in the art alters this personal sphere sothat it glows with, at first a golden color, changing finally to deep red or purple.It is this sphere of metallic hue which they called the Philosopher’s Stone, inthat it represented to their imagination as well as vision, some more thanprecious gem.According to the text, the rubification is the final stage of perfection, prior toprojecting the Stone upon other metals. It calls it the “true Hyle of thePhilosophers, the bloody stone, the purple-red Coral, the precious Ruby, redMercury, and the red Tincture.” Now Hopkins, whose chemical theory haspreviously been mentioned, propounds a question with regard to this change ofcolor. “Was this final stage,” he asks, “so honorable because metal coloring anddyeing began in the same shop, so that the royal purple and the ios 98 of goldmade possible the highest attainment of each in brilliancy of color?” 99Apparently the suggestion involved in the question does not wholly convince"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"him. For immediately he adds: “The analogy is attractive but does not seemsufficient.” 100 Far from sufficient, I should like to add; it does not even begin tocorrespond to the facts.Apart from the probability of observation and spiritual experience wherebythe alchemists had perceived and noted keenly the interior changes in thepsyche and its ethereal vesture, it is evident that throughout all nature red andpurple are the colors of ripeness. Shortly after spring when the Sun wends hisway northwards, bringing warmth and light to the wintery land, nature robesherself in a green colored mantle. It is her first manifestation of life. In it isimplied the promise of further growth; of expectancy, of hope that ripeness willfollow. This is succeeded, if we observe fruits and other vegetation, by ayellowy color, marking a definite stage of growth—of vegetable adolescence,as it were. Red follows as symptomatic of its growth to maturity and fullstature. And as it deepens to purple, rich and bright, so does its maturitybecome more and more evident and pronounced. Thus the colors referred to bythe alchemists have a reference and valid correspondence to a series of naturalprocesses. And just as they claimed that the laws of nature are reflected withinthe sphere of man, so the color processes are recapitulated in the magneticauric sphere as the Great Work of transformation and transmutation isundertaken.[contents]94.

Now I wish to summarize the analysis so farmade in ordinary and not alchemical language, in order to clarify and simplifythe issue. It is necessary to do this because the question may arise as to thevalue of such investigations. From the scientific point of view such a query isbaseless and needless. All forms of knowledge, no matter what they are, are fitsubjects for research and enquiry. It is a case of knowledge for knowledge’ssake.On the other hand there is personal value here. If integrity is achievable bysuch means, is it not a valuable technique? A unity of one’s own psychicstructure may be encompassed, and this is no light gain. Especially if youponder upon the fact that such spiritual unity of being is an age-old quest, andthat for countless centuries it has been sought by countless myriads of people.Psychology is an invaluable modern agent to this end, but I think the ancientsand especially the alchemical writers, can easily illuminate modern therapy. Itexpands our idea of the aim and purpose of our work.We find that, though highly obscure, the Art propounds the view that secretedwithin that most common and cheap of all materials, human nature, is a certainprecious substance. Invariably have the alchemists considered it as the root ofconsciousness as well as of objective things, that metalline mercurial radixwhich is the divine Light itself, the radiation of which are to be cocted into thePhilosopher’s Stone. This inner root, when permitted openly to operate, is theintuited criterion of all values. From within ourselves must we mine thisspiritual gold which eventually transmutes the dross of the external world.But to discover this Mercury of the Wise is no simple matter. Theassimilation of the Unconscious by consciousness is a process beset by all sortsof difficulties. For one thing completely false ideas of ourselves block our"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"perception of the existence of the Unconscious. For another, erroneous religiousand conventional education which has prevailed from our early infancy, hasgiven us an erroneous and untrue conception of life. This combination leads usto place an over-emphasis upon our conscious egos. An exaggerated evaluationof our intellectual thinking selves results, without so much as a vague trace ofrecognition of any deeper spiritual element. Failure of recognition naturallyimplies a failure of culture. If this deeper element of the psyche be not realizedas existent, then it is evident that no technical means can be devised wherebyeither it may be harnessed and its power utilized, or by which the vast extent ofits content of memory and inspiration may be allied to the normal self.Ignorance is thus the first curse and it is this that must be overcome. It is thesame old formulation. Within us is the light of life. We will not or cannot easilyrealize it. Therefore we project it outside and search fruitlessly for this light ofour barren lives. In all places and at all times men have sought a god, a savinggrace, somewhere in the universe—anywhere so long as we might not lookwithin. Outside preferably. We have to learn to realize the intrinsic and finalvalue of the Unconscious—as an inward potentiality that is capable ofconsiderable development and elucidation. Something like bringing Christ tobirth within our souls, or seeking Buddha within at the apex of the mind.Writes Jung in his commentary to Wilhelm’s The Secret of the GoldenFlower, “The more powerful and independent consciousness becomes, andwith it the conscious will, the more is the unconscious forced into thebackground. When this happens it becomes easily possible for the consciousstructures to be detached from the unconscious images. Gaining thus in freedom,they break the chains of mere instinctiveness, and finally arrive at a state that isdeprived of, or contrary to instinct. Consciousness thus torn from its roots andno longer able to appeal to the authority of the primordial images, possesses aPromethean freedom, it is true, but it also partakes of the nature of a godlesshybria.101 It soars above the earth, even above mankind, but the danger ofcapsizing is there, not for every individual, to be sure, but collectively for theweak members of such a society, who again Promethean-like, are bound by theunconscious to the Caucasus.” 102"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"How true becomes the Biblical verse “Where there is no vision, the peopleperish.” 103 That people whose life excludes the dynamic quality of theunconscious, and who are cut off from their own vital roots, obviously aredoomed to disaster. The outstanding feature of our own era is such a one-sidedevaluation of life, an over-emphasis of intellectual values at the expense of theUnconscious and all that it implies. The irrational is rigorously excluded fromconsideration until finally, in a mad explosive burst of national barbarism andindividual neurosis it forces itself upon our attention. As always is the case,when one psychic function is exaggerated to the detriment of the other, or isviolently repressed, such a repressed or exaggerated faculty gains in power andfury. Enantiodromia must then begin its operation—and we are utterlypowerless. Whilst air is left in a free and diffused state very little use may bemade of it because it has but little kinetic power. Immediately, however, whenit is gathered and limited and confined, its compression imparts great power toits content. Thus also, the mere fact that one phase of life is neglected, attentionbeing devoted to its polarity, invests it at once with terrific potency by the veryreason of its repression and damming up. Given no outlet in normal wholesomechannels the bottled-up content of the psyche seeks a forced outlet in illicit andunwelcome ways.It is so easy to realize this principle in the tenor of our present lives.Wherever we turn today, mankind seems gripped by some nameless andunknown terror, dominating all men’s minds unbeknown to themselves. Only itseffect is known and realized, terror and fear. It is activating anxiety and terrorof the unknown within them stirring the old undomesticated beast within intonew and furious life. Its only result can be the destruction of mankind—almostlike the end of a patient disintegrating with psychosis and dementia. Yet—inone sense it is all of our own making.We are, as Jung has so accurately observed, chained like Prometheus to theCaucasus. As men we wished anciently to evolve. To evolve, the animaldynamic side had to be suppressed, to be forgotten—or so it seemed to us. Wehave evolved—somewhat. And, it results that the animal after all controls us. Itwould have been easier to have taken the animal with us—to have trained it, to"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"have domesticated it by kindness and education so that it could be acclimatizedto modern social life. We ought to have realized it was our animal—part ofourselves, inseparable from us, and therefore must be cultivated and retainedwithin the psychic sphere of our awareness. There would have been nochaining to the Caucasus then. For the animal might have shown that it had atotally unsuspected side—a spiritual side. After all, religious experience,artistic and scientific inspiration, emanate from it.We must remember that in the psychic depths, in that primitive archaic aspectof the personality we term the Unconscious, is resident the entire psychic forceof the self, the libido. Since the Unconscious is that level of awareness whichfunctioned in the distant and now faded periods of archaic evolution, it isdirectly associated and connected with the dynamic springs of life, somatic,intellectual and spiritual also.Or, if we wish to take a philosophic religious view of the matter, in God orthe Absolute is all life and all power. Without his life, existence in thephenomenal sense cannot be. The phenomenal world, anyway, by the Neo-Platonic hypothesis, is a falling away from supreme reality into unreality andnegation. The intellectual denial of reality, therefore, would constitute an evenfurther descent into the unreality of negation, a decadence of the human spirit,an increase of positive evil. On the other hand, even the intellectual convictionthat human life is grounded implicitly in divinity and partakes of the divineLight is sufficient to create a compelling link between the human soul and God,and to flood that soul with the Light and abundant energy.The forces resident in the Unconscious charge and dynamize whatevermaterial is forcibly repressed out of consciousness into its dark forbidding areaand given no legitimate vent or outlet. Consequently such material gathersforce, eventually becoming highly explosive and dangerous. The effect of suchan explosive force seeking an outlet must be disastrous for the individual. Thisidea is paralleled by Jehovah in the Bible threatening his people with famine,disaster, and an appalling end if they forget him and no longer worship him. Inthis sense, Jehovah is the personified representation of paternal archetypalimages of the Unconscious. Here we have the rationale of compulsive behavior"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"and physical and mental disorders over which the individual has absolutely nocontrol. In this theory too, is implicit an explanation of irrational fears andimpulses which no amount of logical argument succeeds finally in dispelling oreliminating.The one-sided exaggeration of the conscious outlook forms no inconsiderablepart of the practice of nerve-specialists and psychiatrists and psychoanalysts oftoday, psychological practitioners who have arisen precisely because of suchan exaggeration. Our time is one which over-values the conscious will. Not thatone wishes to detract in the very least from the high moral value of consciousendeavor and ambition. On the contrary, in alchemical literature will andintellect are termed the Flower of Mind, as being the culmination of theevolutionary processes. Consciousness and will should not be depreciated butshould be considered as the greatest cultural and progressive achievement ofhumanity. But of what use is an outlook upon life which destroys humanity?What value has a morality which soars in the clouds but yet which hinders freegrowth and expression? Morality, never let it be forgotten, was designed orinvented to enable us to domesticate our instincts and thus enable us to liveamicably with our fellows. Unfortunately, from something invented for ourconvenience, it has become elevated into an absolute. It rules over our liveswith a rod of iron. We are slaves to its fantastically absurd domination. As Junghas so eloquently remarked, “The bringing of will and capacity into harmonyseems to me to be something more than normality. Morality a tout prix—a signof barbarism—oftentimes wisdom is better.” 104It was such a wisdom that the alchemists sought. In fact, one alchemicalexpositor has defined the Art as “The philosophy; the seeking out of the Sophiain the mind.” 105 The alchemists had recognized the fundamental polarity dualityof consciousness and the tendency induced by life itself towards over-exaggeration of polar functions. This exaggeration they sought to remedy.Integrity, the joining of the polarities within consciousness by the developmentof a new point of view, the saving jewel of myth and fairy tale, that stone whichwould transmute all that was base into the purest gleaming gold, was the prizeabove all to which they aspired. How else could they discover the goddess of"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"wisdom save through integrating themselves? How else could gold be madesave through the discovery of gold in themselves? In what other way could theapproach to the precincts of the Temple of Philosophy be found except insofaras the path made itself clear within their own minds?The consciousness of primitive man expressed the one pole—domination bythe Unconscious, signifying an unyielding and rigid rulership by the old sterngods, the primitive archetypes of the Unconscious. As evolution proceededwith consciousness becoming more developed and civilized, another factortended to operate. Life became increasingly more difficult and complex incultured communities as awareness arose of the conflict set up by the primitiveinstinctual side of man’s nature. Consequently, repression and conflict wereengendered in the psyche. In order to live communally without arousing the ireand disapproval as well as the ostracism of the herd, the primitive impulseshad violently to be restrained—and occasionally to accomplish this, thepersonality was outraged. In reality, such an attitude which refuses to recognizethe instincts is no solution to psychic problems at all. It is precisely thissuppression which, in the long run, results in frustration and sterility. It is justas much a one-sided partial expression of the psyche as is that of primitive manwho, theoretically speaking, indulged his impulses without restraint and therebyoutraged his moral sense.What is necessary, then, is a changed point of view. A new outlook upon lifemust be evolved which is all-inclusive of, and reconcile the legitimacy of boththese psychic tendencies. It must be willing to accept, take cognizance ofdualistic expressions. There must be no hegemony of power against power.Both consciousness and the instinctual side of the psyche are equal parts of andare comprised within the Self. Both demand a reasonable amount of fulfilment.Thus a higher, and an infinitely more civilized attitude towards life is requisite,approaching more nearly to wisdom than either of the others. Through thisviewpoint the libido finds a wholesome outlet. Life is to be seen as a whole.Seen thus, if must be accepted as actually it is. There is, as Synesius sayspractically at the opening of our text, the red tincture and there is the whitetincture, the male and the female, the positive and the negative, which were"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"created together with the universe itself. Both are integral parts of the worldsystem. Why therefore struggle against the scheme of things? Far wiser toaccept. Then the whole man is to be seen, not as an assemblage of separatewarring parts, but as a single homogeneous psychic system. Such a point ofview makes for progress and real evolution. The unconditional acceptance ofboth psychic functions ends the internecine warfare that had been raging. Atonce there is rendered possible a state of inner tranquility and security. In turn,this inner peace reveals a wide vista, showing the true nature of life. Nor is thisall, for the new viewpoint and the attained integrity permit the entry into themind of other levels of consciousness, the existence of which had never beendiscovered because of conflict and neurotic compulsion. In the Hindu Yogisystems, the view is held that until one has experienced Samadhi, the mysticalillumination of the mind, no true perception of the universe, no realunderstanding of life is possible.I am a psychologist with only a minimum of free time. Like most people Ihave neither the time nor the inclination to waste my energies on futileinquiries. We are obliged to be practical people working in a practical world.But because we are practical and sensible we are sometimes forced againstwhat appears to be better judgment into directions which, though seeminglybarren and fruitless of result at first, ultimately yield a most bountiful harvest.Alchemy has been such to me. I would never have imagined it to be possible.My patients pay my fees certainly not for me to talk in platitudes to them. Lotsof people will do that for nothing. But what these patients want and need issomeone to advise and assist them out of their present psychological difficultiesinto a fuller, richer and more satisfactory life. They require aid in understandingthemselves. In other words, to help transmute their valueless lead into thattreasure so desired and desirable—gold.Just stop for a moment to reflect upon what this means. And before coming tosome conclusion, first read the following dream narrated to me by a patient ofmine. I should add, by way of warning, that he has absolutely no knowledge ofalchemy in any way, shape or form. He has never heard of it other than"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"accidently in terms derived from his chemistry course in high school. And I hadnever mentioned it at all to him. Here is the dream:“There is some kind of delightful park, in which are all kinds of animals andbirds. They seem to be thoroughly domesticated. They are returning, afterhaving been afield all day. I notice one strange bird particularly. A few of usare up on a high place looking down on the ground. A bright colored snakeappears. It rears up, apparently ready to strike. We fear it will go for someone.A white vapor issues from its mouth. We suppose it is venom, but it reaches noone. There is a strong smell of ammonia, however.”No doubt this will at first give you the impression of being quite pointless—insignificant as most dreams are. You cannot be blamed for feeling as you do.However, many researchers have come to feel that dreams cannot possibly bemeaningless. Whatever issues from the human mind must possess significance.The significance in many cases may not be at all profound. It may be paltry,trite, pathetic, humorous, or elementary. But some measure of significance itmust have. And after a great deal of enquiry and investigation along certainquite distinct lines, it has been quite definitely proven that dreams havemeaning. In fact, they tell us a great deal about the dreamer and his life.It appears as though the dream is a dynamic effort on the part of some otherdeeper part of our make-up to give us some information about ourselves. Thedream is an attempt to “get wise” to ourselves, projected into normalconsciousness by the Unconscious. Its action seems compensatory to ourconscious upon life. You have all seen a man who has a short leg with a twistedpelvis and a rotated or curved spine. The twisted pelvis and the curvature arewhat are known as mechanical compensations developed to maintainequilibrium. He may not have been conscious of the healing or equilibratingprocess as it gradually occurred, but it took place none the less outside of hisconscious knowledge. If one of your kidneys is not functioning up to par, theother kidney will take over, slightly enlarging itself, perhaps, in order to do thework of both. This too is a compensation. Similarly the dream is acompensatory activity—I say compensating rather than contrasting, advisedly—set up to maintain psychic and mental equilibrium. It prevents intellectual one-"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"sidedness in the same way that the twisted pelvis and curved spine prevent anactual physical one-sidedness.In other words, the dream is to keep you straight. Whenever you are going offthe rails in any direction, you will find, should you observe yourself closelyenough, that somehow your dreams will move off in the other direction. It is anactivity so designed as to give us a superior understanding of ourselves.You feel inferior in the business and social world? Your dreams will begrand, eloquent, making you feel superior. Is life ugly and offensive, woundingyou to your very soul? The dream corrects the situation by placing you for thetime being in a world of gentle beauty, exquisite and lovely, even ecstatic andelevating. Love has disappointed you? During sleep, Don Juan will haveabsolutely nothing on you. There the ladies will fall right and left for yourirresistible charm.One simply cannot live with inferiority, nor with ugliness, if these qualitiesstrike too deeply into the soul—nor with failure of any kind anddisappointment. Life cannot sustain itself under these blows. They are terribledefeats before which you bow the head in shame. If these exist, you might justas well die. And you might die too, were it not for the compensating factorlatent within your own mind. It shows you by contrast the other side of thepicture, to teach you the relativity of the whole of life. If the one is true, theother may be also. Neither one is absolute or fixed for you. In this way, abalance is struck. Equilibrium is maintained, and you are prevented fromblowing your brains out, slowly pining away, or from going more than a littlebit crazy.Freud has called this adjusting process wish-fulfilment. It means briefly thatwhatever it is that lies concealed within you as a wish or as a desire, and lifethwarts you in its expression or gratification, finds its outlet in the act ofdreaming. If you feel inferior, your wish is to succeed and be superior. Love—we all desire success and efficiency here. And most of us wish for lovelysurroundings and a beautiful environment. Without a doubt this is true. Examineyour dreams in the light of your everyday life and you will see how perfectlycorrect it is."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"But this is only one half of the picture. Wish-fulfilment does not by a long shotbegin to answer things. I have come to think, because clinical experience hasled me to this conclusion, that the compensatory function in dreams actuallyrepresents something capable of being brought into manifestation in everydaylife. I am not to be construed as saying that the literal fantastic terms of thedream represent realities. Dreams are full of grotesqueries. But if you cansummarize the meaning implicit in these fantasies, and recognize them as theattempt on the part of a deeper wiser element in your own heart to yourenvironment, you will have embarked upon a road work out your problems in away satisfactory to you and of such high adventure as will make the old blood-and-thunders seem cheap and commonplace. The dream is always an attempt atrelease, at therapy, at self-revelation.You will then discover, as I have been impelled, something of the realmeaning of alchemy. And all the worthless dross of your existence—valuelessand insignificant, will slowly transmute itself into something that surpasses allvalue and worth.The dream of patient is something of the sort. It is an unconscious attempt toheal and equilibrate his own personality so that it could deal more adequatelyand satisfactorily with life. He is always afraid of events long before theymaterialize. Therefore life is always a continuous cycle of trouble anddifficulty of his own anticipation, and he is constantly nervous, tense and jittery.By the end of a day he is practically in a state of nervous exhaustion. So muchso that his professional life—he is a teacher of mathematics—is in jeopardy,and he is unhappy and unsuccessful. At least, this was true before he came fortreatment. This dream occurred about half way through his analysis. I haveselected this one because it presents a number of interesting and salutarysymbols.It may surprise you a little perhaps when I remark that beside me at thismoment is an old alchemical treatise in which there are colored pictures andsymbols which are almost exact replicas of those employed in the dream. Thisbook speaks of strange gardens and parks with all sorts of queer beasts andbirds. In these parks are hills and mountains where grow plants that never were"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"seen in any botanical garden. Snakes are shown in this book, snakes rearingtheir heads, devouring a fellow, and some bearing golden crowns. Strange tosay, the writer speaks of ammonia and magnesia; and all sorts of other metalsand chemicals are thrown together cheek by jowl in description.What is to be the due in our search for interpretation? How shall we analyzethis dream? Analyze it we must, for we have declared that the dream hassignificance. There are at least two possibilities. Both yield equally interestingand valuable material.One is Freud’s approach, the other is Jung’s. Both handle and interpretsimilar material. But how their final analyses differ! Freud interpretsmythological material, arguing that ancient myths and legends indicate thatmankind was heir to exactly the same inner sexual conflicts and endopsychicinadequacies that we experience today. Psychologically, mankind has changedbut little. The fundamental parental conflict and its effect upon the developingego attempting to come to terms with its sexuality—these are the themes ofmyth.Jung likewise admits, but he proceeds a little further. He believes that mythswere evolved as an expression of a purposive function of the mind. Not onlydid they express conflict and inward turmoil, but somehow for the maker of themyth they indicated a way out, a means of release. Not an escape, but asolution. This is not all; for he believes as I have already indicated at length,that latent within the cells of the brain is a stratum of consciousness in which liedormant just such symbols as occur in myth, legend, early religious experiencesand alchemical writing. We have in us at the base of our minds at this verymoment an entirely new world—the Prima Materia of the Alchemists. It onlyawaits investigation and further discovery. And it explains why mankind’ssolutions of its own problems have always been alike; they express themselvesin the basic pattern that we have carried over from the past.If we accept the idea that the myth represented some kind of unconsciouspsychological solution to mental problems, a solution that was presented as anautomatic compensatory activity of the psyche, we can at least divine somethingof what is implicit in the dream of my patient. Somehow his Unconscious—for"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"so we may term this phase of himself of which he was not even aware—wasattempting to solve the problems confronting him. Under the stimulus ofpsychological analysis, it was attempting to present a solution by way of thedream. Why it should present such a key under the guise of alchemicalsymbolism is hard to divine. All we can say is why not? Mankind’s attempts toachieve salvation or integrity, insofar as they belong to the past, have become apart of our inherited Unconscious make-up. As we ourselves seek to integrateor transmute ourselves, so unconsciously we draw upon—or express ourselvesin ways similar to those latent in—the deeper strata of our own souls.Alchemical symbolism, when understood, is just as eloquent as any othersymbolism—and very much more to the point.I do not wish to interpret this dream fully for that would take up too muchspace and time. All I wish to do is briefly to call attention to salient points andleave them to the reader to elaborate in his own way.Nicolas Flamel, an alchemist of the sixteenth century in France, wrote of whathe called the pratum or meadow, where there were hills, caverns, trees andplants and animals.106 Another alchemical writer, Thomas Vaughan, the brotherof Henry Vaughan the poet, has provided us with something of an interpretationof this pratum which he says is the garden of ideas, the rendezvous of allspirits.107 In a word, he is endeavoring to make use of a pictorial expression toconvey some idea of the Unconscious—a mystical place or psychical regionwhich is foreign to our normal rational concepts. It is an “other world”—theother concealed side of our own consciousness where there is life and activity,albeit of a different kind to that with which we are familiar.Animals, briefly, represent psychologically that part of us which is animaland brutal, the instincts. An animal is a perfectly good symbol of that which inus harks back thousands, even millions, of years to primitive evolutionary eras.It represents the instinctual energy striving for expression through us. It is thiswhich is named libido—desire, instinct, psychical energy. There are manyanimals in this garden—many streams or currents of vitality and life within.Note that my patient seems to feel that all his animals are domesticated. That is"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"to say that the instincts have made their adaption to the civilized social order,and are no longer at war with it.The high place is, most suggestively, an elevation from which you can see allaround you. Remember in what reverence the biblical scribes held hills andmountains. You may recall that Moses ascended Mount Horeb to obtain the law.The Psalmist declared that his eyes were lifted towards the hills whence heexpected the help of God. And Christ, to deliver his sermon, went up upon themount. If the meadow represents the unconscious level of our life, the hillockmust represent some divine height in that psychic stratum, some portion whichis struggling upwards towards the light of day, towards a summit by means ofwhich a clearer vista of life may be viewed. From this vantage point life couldbe dealt with more adequately. All of which indicates some inward peak ofsoul when, in drawn upon itself, the psyche gathers its forces to prepare forsome great achievement, for some great move to save itself.Below, in the dream, there appeared a snake. Again we are confronted with apeculiarly apt symbol, common both to alchemical and to psychoanalyticalwriting. In the Freudian system, the snake or serpent usually indicates libidointerpreted solely in a sexual way. It represents a repressed sexuality, sexualdesire and longing, even the genitals themselves. But we may extend thisconsiderably to give it an added and fuller meaning. In Genesis, the serpentwho tempted Eve somehow represents the forbidden knowledge of good andevil, in some way associated with sex for afterwards both she and Adambecame ashamed of their nakedness and covered themselves up. Alchemicallyit represents the possibility of transformation, sublimation, and regeneration. Itis wisdom and power exalted to the heights—power becomes immortality. Insome ancient religions, certain Gods were represented as serpents. The Gods,we know, are primitive power concepts, symbols of creative energy. Thus wehave amplified some little the significance of the snake in the patient’s dream.That the dreamer should fear the snake is indicative of the source of histrouble. He is afraid of himself and his own instincts, which fear he projectsoutside of himself, transforming it into a fear of his profession, of people, oflife. But the dream hints that he should not fear. He is perfectly safe. And so far"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"from the snake being dangerous, the psyche indicates otherwise. It draws uponthat collective mythological symbolism which anciently also the alchemistsused.What issues from the snake’s mouth? A white vapor smelling of ammonia.What strange metaphors this dreamer is using! Yet they tell him a great deal ifonly he would listen. His associations to ammonia were principally that it wasused for cleaning purposes, for cleaning bathroom installations and tubs. Andsince all the symbols in a dream refer to the dreamer himself, this ammonia andits pungent cleansing properties issue from that of which he is afraid, his ownbasic self. In a great many alchemical writings we find it said that the FirstMatter from which the invaluable Philosopher’s Stone is to be formed, is awhite vapor, a silvery humid cloud, the Sal Ammoniac of the Wise, magnesia,or some other poisonous venom.Strange, is it not? We might almost assume that the dreamer’s real self isstating that fear is superfluous. Not only so but that from that part of himselfwhich he fears something invaluable may be formed as a sublimate. If only thedreamer would recognize and accept himself entirely, casting out all fear andanxiety, a new process of regeneration and transformation might graduallydevelop within him. Almost, by inference, it says the Philosopher’s Stone mightbe formed—a stone that is of untold price, a perfect gem with power totransmute. And the personality which hitherto had been so valueless, soimpotent and sterile, just like cheap common lead, could undergo a transmutingprocess to become creative, valuable with an enormous potential forsubsequent achievement.Thus my psychological work has forced me to investigate a subject whichseemed at first to be forbidding and quite incapable of yielding anything ofvalue so far as my professional life was concerned. Certainly it would seemthat alchemy would be the last subject on earth to investigate. Yet my patient’sdream is full of naught but alchemical symbolism. By my study of it, apart frompurely personal benefit which has been considerable, I have been able to assisthim, if only a little, in his interior growth, enabling him to be bold and fearlessin his attempt to adapt himself successfully to the external world. Because of"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"alchemy, he thus may succeed and conquer. Had I not been obliged to turn tothis dark page in the obscure history of intellectual and spiritual development,my patient might have encountered another frustration in the long series whichlife has afforded him. Instead of being able to assist him, my ignorance wouldhave left him high and dry with his own inadequacies and neurotic problems.Now however, thanks to the suggestion which Alchemy made me, he has beenable to see himself in a new creative and spiritual light, to overcome his owninner conflicts, and to strive with all his might towards achievement.The elimination of the conflict, the clearing away of the animal dross andrefuse from the mind, transmuting the mind spontaneously, is the one goal thatthe alchemists aspired towards. For, if we translate, their terminology, until thepsyche is integrated by a conversion of the elements of its own being,producing a “conjunction of both natures,” 108 its house ceasing to be dividedagainst itself, the true nature and purpose of life cannot be divined. Nor can thenature of the spiritual forces playing upon both the universe and upon man berealized. The dead weight of outlived idea, unnecessary addiction to habit andconvention, these of necessity must be removed from the mind’s sphere, so thatwhen the individual acts it is with the whole individuality, with spontaneity,and with creative effort. The sphere of the mind’s perceptions must be extendedto an extensive knowledge of itself, so that true self-consciousness in the fullestand widest sense of the term is attained. Tranquilized and cleansed, then thehitherto dormant aspects of the psyche may awaken and grow. As the supremeand most important definition of Synesius asserts, in the discovery andmanufacture of the Stone, we add nothing but only remove the superfluities.As the superfluities are cleared away, and the nature of the alchemical goldwithin is revealed, that “essence of mind which is intrinsically pure,” so is thePhilosopher’s Stone concocted. Consciousness is realized to be comparable tosome more than valuable gem—a redeeming stone of untold price. It is a stonewhich imparts value to whatsoever is brought into contact with it, enlighteningit and transmuting it to its own divine nature and integrity."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"[contents]101.

Allforms of mental or spiritual healing, no matter under what name they travel,promise the same thing. Even psychoanalysis employs this power, thoughindirectly.

By turning the fiery penetrating power of the mind inwardsupon itself, and exalting the emotional system to a certain pitch, we maybecome aware of previously unsuspected currents of force. Currents, moreover,almost electric in their interior sensation, healing and integrating in their effect.It is the willed use of such a force that is capable of bringing health to bodyand mind. When directed it acts magnet-like. By this I mean that it attracts towhomsoever employs these methods just those necessities of life, material orspiritual, that he urgently requires or which are needed for his further evolution.Fundamentally, the underlying idea of the mental healing systems is this. In theambient atmosphere surrounding us and pervading the structure of each minutebody-cell is a spiritual force. This force is omnipresent and infinite. It ispresent in the most infinitesimal object as it is in the most proportion-staggeringnebula or island universe. It is this force which is life itself. Nothing in the vastexpanse of space is dead. Everything pulsates with vibrant life. Even the ultra-microscopic particles of the atom are alive; in fact the electron is acrystallization of its electric power.This life force being infinite it follows that man must be saturated—permeated through and through with spiritual force. It constitutes his higher self,it is his link with godhead, it is God in man. Every molecule in his physicalsystem must be soaked with its dynamic energy. Each cell in the body containsit in its plenitude. Thus we are brought face to face with the enormous problemunderlying all disease, the enigmatical problem of nervous depletion.What is fatigue? How can there be depletion if vitality and cosmic currents offorce daily pour through man, simply saturating his mind and body with itspower? Primarily, it is because he offers resistance to its flow through him thathe becomes tired and ill, the conflict finally culminating in death. How is punyman able to defy the universe? Nay more, offer resistance and opposition to thevery force which underlies, and continually evolves in, the universe? Thecomplacency and confusion of his mental outlook, the moral cowardice by"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"which he was reared, and his false perception of the nature of life—these arethe causes of resistance to the inward flow of the spirit. That this isunconscious is no logical obstacle to the force of this argument, as all the depthpsychologies have demonstrated. What man is really aware of all theinvoluntary processes going on within him? Who is conscious of the intricatemechanism of his mental processes, of that by which his food is assimilated anddigested, of the circulation of his blood, of the arterial distribution ofnourishment to every bodily organ? All these are purely involuntary processes.To a large degree also are his resistances to life. Man has surrounded himselfwith a crystallized shell of prejudices and ill-conceived fantasies, a shellwhich affords no entrance to light of life without.What wonder he ails? What wonder he is so ill and impotent, helpless andpoor? Why should there be surprise that the average individual is so unableadequately to deal with life?The first step towards freedom and health is a conscious realization of thevast spiritual reservoir in which we live and move and have our being.Repeated intellectual effort to make this part and parcel of one’s mental outlookupon life automatically breaks down or dissolves something of the hardinflexible shell of the mind. And then life and spirit pour abundantly. Healthspontaneously arises, and a new life begins as the point of view undergoes thisradical change. Moreover, it would appear that the environment attracts justthose people who can help in various ways, and precisely those amenities oflife that had been longed for.The second step lies in a slightly different direction. Regulated breathing—quite a simple process. Its necessity follows from the following postulate. Iflife is all about one, all-penetrant and all pervasive, what more reasonable thanthat the very air we breathe from one moment to another should be highlycharged with vitality? Our breathing processes we then regulate accordingly.We contemplate that life is the active principle in the atmosphere. During thepractice of this rhythmical breathing at fixed periods of the day, there should beno strenuous forcing of the mind, no overtaxing of the will. All effort must begentle and easy; then skill is obtained. We let the breath flow in while mentally"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"counting very slowly—one, two, three, four, five. Then we exhale counting thesame beat. It is fundamental and important that the initial rhythm begun, whetherit be a five or ten beats count or any other convenient one, should bemaintained. For it is the very rhythm itself which is responsible for the easyabsorption of vitality from without, and the acceleration of the divine powerwithin.Immutable rhythm is everywhere manifest in the universe. It is a machinewhose parts move and are governed in accordance with the cyclic laws. Lookat the sun, the stars, and the planets. All move with comparable grace, with arhythm in their inexorable times. It is mankind which has wandered, in itsignorance and self-complacency, far from the divine cycles of things. We haveinterfered with the rhythmic process inhering in nature. And how sadly have wenot paid for it!Therefore in attempting to attune ourselves once more to the intelligentspiritual power functioning through nature’s mechanism, we attempt, not blindlyto copy, but intelligently to adopt her methods. Make, therefore, the breathingrhythmical at certain fixed times of the day when there is little likelihood ofdisturbance. Cultivate above all the art of relaxation. Learn to address eachtensed muscle from toe to head as you lie flat on your back in bed. Tell itdeliberately to loosen its tension and cease from its unconscious contracture.Think of the blood in response to your command flowing copiously to eachorgan, carrying life and nourishment everywhere, producing a state of glowingradiant health. Only after these preliminary processes have been accomplishedshould you begin your rhythmic breathing, slowly and without haste. Graduallyas the mind accustoms itself to the idea, the lungs will take up the rhythm. In afew minutes it will have become automatic. The whole process becomesextremely simple and pleasurable.It would be impossible to overestimate its importance or efficacy. As thelungs take up the rhythm, automatically inhaling and exhaling to a measuredbeat, so do they communicate it and gradually extend it to all the surroundingcells and tissue. Just as a stone thrown into a pond sends out widely expandingripples and concentric circles of motion, so does the motion of the lungs. In a"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"few minutes, the whole body is vibrating in unison with their movement. Everycell seems to vibrate sympathetically. And very soon, the whole organismcomes to feel as if it were an inexhaustible storage battery of power.Simple as it is, the exercise is not to be despised. It is upon the mastery ofthis very easy technique that the rest of this system stands. Master it first. Makesure that you can completely relax and produce the rhythmic breath in a fewseconds.I now approach an idea fundamental and highly significant. It is the inability torealize or thoroughly to have grasped its importance which really underlies thefrequently observed failure of many mental culture and spiritual healingsystems. Just as in the physical body are specialized organs for the performanceof specialized functions, so in the mental and spiritual nature existcorresponding centers and organs. Exactly as the teeth, the stomach, liver andintestines are so many mechanisms evolved and devised by nature for thedigestion and assimilation of food, so are there similar centers in the otherconstituents of man’s nature. The mouth receives food. Likewise there is anapparatus for rejecting waste effete products. In the psychic nature also arefocal centers for the absorption of spiritual power from the universe without.Others render its distribution and circulation possible. The dynamic energy andpower entering man from without is not uniform or alike in vibratory rate. Itmay be of too high a voltage, so to say, readily to be endured by him. Within,therefore, is a certain psychic apparatus whereby indiscriminate cosmiccurrents of energy may be assimilated and digested, their voltage thus becomingadjusted to the human level. The process of becoming aware of this psychicapparatus, and using the energy it generates, is an integral part of this healingsystem. It is my contention that prayer and contemplative methodsunconsciously employ these inner centers. Hence we would be wiser and farmore efficient deliberately to employ for our own ends this spiritual power andthe centers it flows through. Let us call these latter, for the moment, psycho-spiritual organs, of which there are five major ones. Since name them we must,"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"inasmuch as the human mind loves to classify and tabulate things, let me givethem the most non-committal and non-compromising titles imaginable. Forconvenience’s sake, the first we may name Spirit, the second Air, thesucceeding ones being called Fire, Water and Earth.To illustrate the concept, I reproduce here a simple diagram. It shows theposition and location of the centers. Not for one moment do I wish to beunderstood as stating that these centers are physical in nature and position. Theyexist in a subtler spiritual or psychic part of man’s nature. We may evenconsider them, not as realities themselves, but as symbols of realities, great,redeeming and saving symbols. Under certain conditions we may becomeaware of them in very much the same way as we may become aware ofdifferent organs in our physical bodies. We often speak of reason as beingsituated in the head, referring emotion to the heart and instinct to the belly.Similarly, there exists a natural correspondence between these centers andvarious parts of the body."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"The Middle PillarIt is axiomatic to this system that there are three principal engines or meanswhereby we may become aware of the centers to awaken them from theirdormant state so that they may function properly within. Thought, color, andsound are the three means. The mind must concentrate itself on the assumedposition of these centers one by one. Then certain names which are to beconsidered as vibratory rates must be intoned and vibrated. Finally, each centeris to be visualized as having a particular color and shape. The combination ofthese three agencies gradually awakens the centers from their latency.109 Slowlythey become stimulated into functioning each according to its own nature,pouring forth a stream of highly spiritualized energy and power into the body"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"and mind. When ultimately their operation becomes habitual and stabilized, thespiritual power they generate may be directed by will to heal various ailmentsand diseases both of a psychological and physical nature. It can also becommunicated by mere laying of hands to another person. Simply by thinkingfixedly and with intent, the energy moreover can be communicated from mind tomind telepathically or transmitted through space to another person miles away—objects in space affording no interruption or obstacle to its passage.First of all the position of the centers as shown diagrammatically must bememorized. They are to be stimulated into activity either while sitting uprightor whilst lying down flat on the back in a perfectly relaxed state. The handsmay be folded in the lap, or else, with fingers interlocked, be permitted to restloosely below the solar plexus. Calmness should be induced, and severalminutes should be devoted to rhythmic breathing, until a gentle ripple is sensedplaying over the diaphragm.Then imagine above the coronal region of the head a ball or sphere ofbrilliant white light. Do not force the imagination to visualize the light sphere.To force would only result in the development of neuromuscular tension, andthis would defeat our end. Let it be done quietly and easily. If the mindwanders, wait a moment or two and gently lead it back. At the same timevibrate or intone the word Eheieh. This word should be pronounced eh-heh-yeh. After a few days of practice it will become quite easy to imagine the namevibrating above the head in the so-called Spirit center. This is the indwelling orovershadowing divinity in each of us, the basic spiritual self which we can alldraw upon. Eheieh means literally “I AM,” and this center represents the I AMconsciousness within. The effect of thus mentally directing the vibration is toawaken the center to dynamic activity. At once it begins to vibrate and rotate,and light and energy are felt to emanate downwards upon and into thepersonality. Enormous charges of spiritual power make their way into the brain,and the entire body feels suffused with vitality and life. Even the finger-tips andtoes react to the awakening of the coronal sphere by a faint pricking sensation atfirst being felt. The name should be intoned during the first few weeks ofpractice in a moderately audible and sonorous tone of voice. As skill is"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"acquired, then the vibration may be practiced in silence, the name beingimagined and mentally placed in the center. If the mind tends to wander, thefrequent repetition of the vibration will be found a great help to concentration.Having let the mind rest here for some five minutes, when it will be seen toglow and scintillate, imagine that it emits a white shaft downwards through theskull and brain, stopping at the throat. Here it expands to form a second ball oflight, which should include a large part of the face, up to and including theeyebrows. If the larynx is conceived to be the center of the sphere, then thedistance from it to the cervical vertebrae at the back of the neck will beapproximately the radius. Naturally this dimension will vary with differentpeople. A similar technique should be pursued with this sphere, which we namethe Air center, as obtained with the previous one. It should be strongly andvividly formulated as a scintillating sphere of brilliant white light, shining andglowing from within. The name to be vibrated is YHVH Elohim 110—pronounced as Yod Heh Vav Heh Eh-loh-heem.A word or two may not be amiss at this point with regard to the names. Inreality they are names ascribed in various parts of the Old Testament to God.The variety and variation of these names are attributed to different divinefunctions. When acting in a certain manner, He is described by the biblicalscribes by one name. When doing something else, another name moreappropriate to His action is used. The system I am describing now has its rootsin mystical tradition. Its ancient innovators were men of exalted religiousaspirations and genius. It is only to be expected that a religious bias wasprojected by them into this scientific psychological system. But it must beexplained that for our present-day purposes no religious connotation is impliedby my use of these biblical divine names. Anyone can use them withoutsubscribing in the least to my religious views—whether he be a Jew, Christian,Hindu, Buddhist or atheist. It is a purely empirical system which is successfuldespite the skepticism or faith of the operator. We today may consider thesesacred names in an entirely different and practical light. They are keynotes ofdifferent constituents of man’s nature, doorways to so many levels of that partof the psyche of which normally we are unconscious. They are vibratory rates"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"or symbolic signatures of the psychophysical centers we are describing. Theiruse as vibratory keynotes awakens into activity the centers with which their rateis in sympathy, conveying to our consciousness some recognition of the severallevels of the unconscious spiritual side of our personalities. Hence the actualreligious significance does not concern us. Nor their literal translation.To refer back to the Air center in the throat, let the vibratory sounds beintoned a number of times, until its existence is recognized and clearly definedas a sensory experience. There is no mistaking the sensation of its awakening.About the same length of time should be spent formulating it and the succeedingcenters as was devoted to the contemplation of the coronal sphere. This periodhaving elapsed, let it thrust downward from itself with the aid of imagination ashaft of light.Descending to the region of the solar plexus, just beneath the sternum orbreast-bone, the shaft expands once again to form a third sphere. This is theposition of the Fire center. The allocation of fire to this center is particularlyappropriate, for the heart is notoriously associated with the emotional nature,with love and the higher feelings. How often do we not speak of ardent passion,and the flame of love, and so forth? The diameter of this ambient cardiac sphereshould be such as to extend from the front of the body to the back. Here vibratethe name YHVH Eloah ve-Daath, as Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh Eh-loh-ah ve-Dah-ath.Take care that the intonation vibrates well within the formulated white sphere.If this is done, at once a radiation of warmth will be felt to emanate from thecenter, gently stimulating all the parts and organs about it.Since the mind functions in and through the body, being co-extensive with it,the mental and emotional faculties likewise become stimulated by the dynamicflow of energy from the centers. The hard and fast barrier erected betweenconsciousness and the Unconscious, a partition which impedes our freeexpression and hinders spiritual development, slowly becomes dissolved. Astime goes on, and the practice continues, it disappears completely and thepersonality gradually achieves integration and wholeness. Thus health spreadsto every function of mind and body and happiness ensues as a permanentblessing."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Continue the shaft downwards from the solar plexus to the pelvic region, theregion of the generative organs. Here, too, a radiant sphere is to be visualizedapproximately of the same dimensions as the higher one. Here also is a name tobe intoned so as to produce a rapid vibration in the cells and molecules of thetissue in that region. Shaddai El Chai is to be pronounced Shah-dye El Chi (thech is guttural as in “loch”). The mind must be permitted to dwell on theimaginative formulation for some minutes, visualizing the sphere as of a whitebrilliance. And each time the mind wanders from such a brilliance, as at thebeginning it is bound to do, let it gently be coaxed back by repeated andpowerful vibrations of the name.It may be feared that this practice could awaken or stimulate sexual feelingand emotion unnecessarily. In those in whom a sexual conflict is raging such anapprehension is just and legitimate. Actually, however, the fear is groundless.For the contemplation of the Water center as a sphere of white light connectedby a shaft to the higher and more spiritual centers acts rather in a more sedativeway. And in point of fact sexual stimulation can be removed, not by ignorantand short-sighted repression, but by the circulation of such energies through thesystem by means of this practice. A thoroughgoing and far-reaching process ofsublimation, alchemical almost in effect, may thus be instigated.The final step is once more to visualize the shaft descending from thereproductive sphere, moving downwards through the thighs and legs until itstrikes the feet. There it expands from a point approximately beneath the ankle,and forms a fifth sphere. We have named this one the Earth center. Let the mindformulate here exactly as before a brilliant dazzling sphere of the same size asthe others. Vibrate the name Adonai ha-Aretz as Ah-doh-nye hah-Ah-retz.Several minutes having been utilized in awakening this center by fixed andsteady thought and by repeated vibration of the name, pause for a short while.Then try to visualize clearly the entire shaft of silvery light, studded as itwere with five gorgeous diamonds of incomparable brilliance, stretching fromthe crown of the head to the soles of the feet. But a few minutes will suffice togive reality to this concept, bringing about a vivid realization of the powerfulforces which, playing upon the personality, are eventually assimilated into the"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"psycho-physical system after their transformation and passage through theimaginative centers. The combination of rhythmic breathing with the willedvisualization of the descent of power through the light shaft or Middle Pillar, asit is also called, produces by far the best results.As skill and familiarity are acquired in the formulation of the centers, anaddition to the technique may be made. Earlier I remarked that color was a veryimportant consideration where this technique was concerned. Each center has adifferent color attribution,111 though it is wisest for a long period of time torefrain from using any other color than white. To the Spirit or coronal center thecolor white is attributed. It is the color of purity, spirit, divinity, and so on. Itrepresents, not so much a human constituent, but a universal and cosmicprinciple overshadowing the whole of mankind. As we descend the shaft,however, the colors change. Lavender is attributed to the Air or throat center,112and it represents particularly the mental faculties, human consciousness as such.To the Fire center, red is an obvious association requiring no furthercomment. Blue is the color referred to the Water center; it is the color of peace,calmness and tranquility, concealing enormous strength and virility. In otherwords, its peace is the peace of strength and power rather than the inertia ofmere weakness. Finally, the color referred to the lowest center of Earth isrusset, the rich deep color of the earth itself, the foundation upon which we rest.From this very brief and concise summary it will be seen that each of thesecenters has a species of affinity or sympathy with a different spiritualconstituent. One center is peculiarly sympathetic to or is associated with theemotions and feelings, whilst another has definitely an intellectual bias. Henceit follows logically, and experience demonstrates this fact, that theirequilibrated activity and stimulation evokes a sympathetic reaction from everypart of man’s nature. And where disease manifesting in the body is directly dueto some psychic maladjustment or infirmity, then the activity of the appropriatecenter must be affected somehow in a deleterious way. Its stimulation by soundand color, tends to stimulate the corresponding psychic principle and thus todisperse the maladjustment. Sooner or later a reaction is induced physically in"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"the disappearance of the disease, and the consequent building up of new cellsand tissue—the appearance of health itself.We approach a further and important stage in the development of the MiddlePillar technique. Having brought power and spiritual energy into the system bymeans of the psycho-spiritual centers, how best are we to use it? That is to say,use it in such a way that every single cell, every atom, and every organbecomes stimulated and vitalized by that dynamic stream?To begin with, we throw the mind upwards to the coronal sphere again,imagining it to be in a state of extreme activity. That is, it revolves rapidly,absorbing spiritual energy from space about it, transforming it in such a waythat it becomes available for immediate use in any human activity. Imagine thenthat such transformed energy flows, stream-like, down the left side of the head,down the left side of the trunk and the left leg. While the current is descendingthe breath should slowly be exhaled to a convenient rhythm. With the slowinhalation of the breath, imagine that the vital current passes from the sole of theleft foot to the right foot, and gradually ascends the right side of the body. In thisway it returns to the source from which it issued, the coronal center, the humansource of all energy and vitality, a closed electrical circuit thus beingestablished. Naturally this circulation is visualized as persisting within thebody rather than as travelling around the periphery of the physical shape. It is,so to say, an interior psychic circulation rather than a purely physical one.Let this circulation, once firmly established by the mind, flow evenly to therhythm of the breath for some seconds so that the circuit has been traversedabout half a dozen times. Then repeat it in a slightly different direction.Visualize the vital flow as moving from the coronal center above the head downthe front of the face and body. After having turned backwards under the soles ofthe feet, it ascends at the back in a fairly wide belt of vibrating energy. This,likewise, should accompany the inhalation and exhalation of breath, and shouldalso be persisted in for about six complete circuits."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"The general effect of these two movements will be to establish in and aboutthe physical form an ovoid shape of swiftly circulating substance and power.Since the spiritual energy dealt with by this technique is extremely dynamic andkinetic, it radiates in every direction, spreading outwards to an appreciabledistance. It is this radiation which forms, colors and informs the ovoid sphereof sensation which is not conterminous with the shape or dimension of thephysical frame. General perception and experience has it that the sphere ofluminosity and magnetism extends outwards to a distance more or less identicalwith the length of the outstretched arm. And it is within this aura, as we maycall it, that the physical man exists rather like a kernel within a nut. Circulatingthe force admitted into the system by the former mental exercises is tantamountto charging it to a considerable degree in every department of its nature withlife and energy. Naturally this is bound to exert a considerable influence, so faras general health is concerned, upon the enclosed “kernel” within.The final method of circulation rather resembles the action of a fountain. Justas water is forced or drawn up through a pipe until it jets up above, falling in aspray on all sides, so does the power directed by this last circulation. Throwthe mind downwards to the Earth center, imagining it to be the culmination ofall the others, the receptacle of all power, the storehouse and terminal of theincoming vital force. Then imagine that this power ascends, or is drawnupwards by the magnetic attraction of the Spirit center above the crown of thehead. The power ascends the shaft until it violently surges overhead with amarvelous fountainous display and falls down within the confines of the ovoidaura. When it has descended it is again gathered together and concentrated inthe Earth center preparatory to being pushed up the shaft again. As before, thefountain circulation should accompany a definite rhythm of inhalation andexhalation. By these means, the healing force is distributed to every part of thebody. No single atom or cell in any organ or limb is omitted from the influenceof its healing regenerative power.The circulation completed, the mind may be permitted to dwell quietly on theidea of the sphere of light, spiritual and healing in quality, surrounding theentire body. The visualization should be made as vivid and as powerful as"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"possible. The sensation following the partial or complete formulation of theaura in the manner described is so marked and definite as to be quiteunmistakable. In the first place it is marked by an extreme sense of calmnessand vitality and poise, as though the mind was placid and still while the body,completely at rest in a state of relaxation, was in all its parts thoroughlycharged and permeated by the vibrant current of life. The skin over all the bodywill throw up symptoms, caused by the intensification of life within, of a gentlepricking and warmth. The eyes become clear and bright, the skin takes on afresh healthy glow, and every faculty, mental, emotional, and physical, becomesenhanced to a considerable degree.This is the moment when, should there be any functional disturbances in anyorgan or limb, the attention should be directed and focused on that part. Theresult of this focus of attention directs a flow of energy over and above thegeneral equilibrium just established. The diseased organ becomes bathed in asea of light and power. Diseased tissue and diseased cells, under the stimulusof such power, become broken down and ejected from the personal sphere. Therevitalized blood-stream is then able to send to that spot new nourishment andnew life so that new tissue, fiber, cells, etc., can easily be built up. In this way,health is restored by the persistent concentration there of the divine power.Carried on for a few days in the case of superficial ailments, and for weeks inthe event of chronic and severe troubles, all symptoms may successfully bebanished without others coming to take their place. There is no suppression ofsymptoms. Elimination is the result of these methods. Even psychogeniceruptions may thus be cured. For the currents of force arise from the deepeststrata of the Unconscious, where these neuroses have their origin and wherethey lock up nervous energy, preventing spontaneous and free expression of thepsyche. The upwelling of the libido, as the vital force is called inpsychological circles, dissolves the crystallizations and barriers which dividethe various strata of psychic function.Where organic disease is the problem to be attacked, the procedure to befollowed is slightly different.113 In this instance a considerably stronger currentof force is required such as will dissolve the lesion and be sufficient to set in"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"motion those arterial activities to construct new tissue and cellular structure. Tofulfil these conditions in an ideal sense a second person may be requisite sothat his vitality added to that of the sufferer may overcome the condition. Auseful technique which my experience has discovered supremely successful,and which any student can adopt, is first of all to relax completely every tissuethroughout the body before attempting the Middle Pillar technique. The patientis placed in a highly relaxed state, one in which every neuromuscular tensionhas been tested and called to the attention of the patient. Consciousness is thenable to eliminate tension and induce a relaxed state of that muscle or limb. Ihave found a useful preliminary in the practice of massage, with deep kneadingsand effleurage, for in this way an enhanced circulation of the blood and lymphis produced—which from the physiological point of view is half the battle won.A suitable degree of relaxation obtained, the patient’s feet are crossed over theankles and his fingers interlaced to rest lightly over the solar plexus. Theoperator or healer then seats himself on the right side of the person should thepatient be right-handed—vice versa for a left-handed patient. Placing his righthand gently on the solar plexus under the patient’s intertwined hands and his lefthand on the patient’s head, at once a form of rapport is established. Within afew minutes a free circulation of magnetism and vitality is set up, readilydiscernible both by patient and healer.The patient’s attitude should be one of absolute receptivity to the incomingforce—automatic, should he have unwavering confidence and faith in theoperator’s integrity and ability. Silence and quiet should be maintained for ashort while, following which the operator silently performs the practice of theMiddle Pillar, still maintaining his physical contact with the patient. Hisawakened spiritual centers act on the patient by sympathy. A similar awakeningis introduced within the patient’s sphere, and his centers eventually begin tooperate and throw an equilibrated stream of energy into his system. Even whenthe operator does not vibrate the divine name audibly, the power flowingthrough his fingers sets up an activity which will surely produce some degree ofhealing activity within the patient. His psycho-spiritual centers aresympathetically stirred into the active assimilation and projection of force so"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"that, without any conscious effort on his part, his sphere is invaded by thedivine power of healing and life. When the operator arrives at the circulationstage, he so employs his inner visualizing faculty, a veritable magical powerindeed, that the augmented currents of energy flow not only through his ownsphere but through that of his patient. The nature of this rapport now begins toundergo a subtle change. Whereas formerly there existed close sympathy and aharmonious frame of mind, mutually held, during and after the circulations thereis an actual union and interblending of the two energy fields. They unite to forma single continuous sphere as the interchange and transference of vital energyproceed. Thus the operator, or his unconscious psyche or spiritual self, is ableto divine exactly what potential his projected current should be, and preciselyto where it should be directed.A number of these treatments incorporating the cooperation and training of thepatient in the use of mental methods should suffice to produce a cure.114Occasionally, since fanaticism above all is to be eschewed, medical andmanipulative methods may usefully be combined with the mental methodsdescribed to facilitate and hasten the cure.Quite apart from therapy, there are other uses of the Middle Pillar technique.115In this place I shall not deal with that aspect of it which concerns spiritualdevelopment, though the method is supremely efficient here. I have dealt withthis subject elsewhere at some considerable length.It may be for various reasons that certain necessities of life, either physical orspiritual, have been denied one—with a consequent cramping effect oncharacter and the onset of a sense of frustration. The latter always has adepressing and inhibitory effect on the human mind, producing indecision,inefficiency and inferiority. There is no real necessity why there should be anyundue frustration and inhibition in our lives. A certain amount is no doubtinevitable. So long as we remain human it is quite certain that in some measurewe are likely to be thwarted in our efforts fully to express the inner self, thusexperiencing frustration. But any abnormal measure or persistent sense of"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"thwarting and frustration may be dealt with and, by these mental and spiritualmethods, eliminated.First of all an understanding of life is essential, and an unconditionalacceptance of everything in life and every experience that may come one’s way.With understanding will come a love of life and living, for love andunderstanding are one and the same; with it also arises the determination nolonger to frustrate natural processes but by acceptance to cooperate with nature.The methods of spiritual and mental culture have long held out hope that theseinhibitory conditions may be alleviated. Poverty of estate as well as of idea is alife-condition which these techniques have always acknowledged to beamenable to treatment. The usual method is one of such deep and prolongedreflection upon just that mental stimulus, moral quality or material thing whichis wanted, that the idea of the need sinks into the so-called subconscious mind.If the barriers leading to the subconscious are penetrated so that the latteraccepts the idea of the need, then, so it is said, sooner or later life willinevitably attract one of those things required. But, as with the therapeuticmethods, there were so many instances where, despite close adherence to theprescribed techniques, success was not forthcoming. It is my contention,therefore, that they fail for very much the same reasons that their healing effortsfail. In short, it was because there was no true understanding of the interiorpsycho-dynamic mechanism whereby such effects could be produced. Therewas no appreciation of the methods by which the dynamic nature of theUnconscious could be stimulated to the extent that the human personalitybecame transformed into a powerful magnet attracting to itself whatever it trulydesired or was necessary to welfare.Whether this procedure is morally defensible is a question I do not wish todiscuss at length, though I know it will be raised. But the answer is brief.Whatever faculties we have are meant to be used, and used both for our ownadvantage and that of others. If we are in a state of constant mental friction,emotional frustration, and excessive poverty, I fail to see in what way we canbe of service either to ourselves or our fellow men. Eliminate these restrictionsfirst, improve the mental and emotional faculties so that the spiritual nature is"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"able to penetrate through the personality and manifest itself in practical ways,then we are in a position to be of some service to those with whom we comeinto contact. The preliminary stimulation of the psycho-spiritual centers within,and then formulating clearly and vividly one’s demands upon the universe iscapable of attracting almost anything required, so long, naturally, as it existswithin the bounds of reason and possibility.First of all, let me preface my further remarks by stating that from thepractical point of view the rudiments of the astrological schema are of untoldvalue in that they offer a concise classification of the broad divisions of things.I am not concerned here with astrology as such, merely that it is convenient touse its schema. Its roots are in the seven principal ideas of planets to whichmost ideas and things may be referred. To each of these root ideas there isattributed a positive and negative color, and a divine name for the purpose ofvibration. I propose naming the planets with their principal attributions:Saturn. Older people and old plans. Debts and their repayment. Agriculture,real estate, death, wills, stability, inertia. Positive color indigo; negative black.YHVH Elohim, pronounced Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh Eh-loh-heem.Jupiter. Abundance, plenty, growth, expansion, generosity. Spirituality,visions, dreams, long journeys. Bankers, creditors, debtors, gambling. Positivecolor purple; negative blue. El, pronounced exactly as written.Mars. Energy, haste, anger, construction or destruction (according toapplication), danger, surgery. Vitality and magnetism. Will-power. Positive andnegative colors bright red. Elohim Gibor, pronounced Eh-loh-heem Gibor.Sun. Superiors, employers, executives, officials. Power and success. Life,money, growth of all kinds. Illumination, imagination, mental power. Health.Positive color orange; negative color yellow or gold. YHVH Eloah ve-Daath,pronounced Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh El-loh-ah ve-dah-ath.Venus. Social affairs, affections and emotions, women, younger people. Allpleasures and the arts, music, beauty, extravagance, luxury, self-indulgence.Both colors emerald green.116 YHVH Tzavaoth,117 pronounced Yeh-hoh-vohTzah-va-oth."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Mercury.

This classification isextremely useful because it simplifies enormously one’s task of physical andspiritual development. It may be best if before concluding I instance a fewsimple and elementary examples to illustrate the function and method ofemploying these correspondences.Suppose I am engaged in certain studies requiring books that are not easilyobtainable from booksellers. Despite my every demand for them, in spite ofwidespread advertising and willingness to pay a reasonable price for them, myefforts are unavailing. The result is that for the time my studies are held up.This delay reaches the point when it is excessive and irritating, and I decide touse my own technical methods for ending it. At certain prescribed intervals,preferably upon awakening in the morning and before retiring to sleep at night, Ipractice the rhythmic breath and the Middle Pillar. By these methods I havemade available enormous quantities of spiritual power, and transformed theUnconscious into a powerful storage battery, ready to project or attract powerto fulfil my need. This I circulate through the auric system.My next step consists of visualizing the negative or passive color ofMercury,120 orange, so that meditating upon it changes the surrounding auriccolor to that hue. Orange is used because books, which I need, are attributed toMercury; and I employ the negative color because it tends to make the sphere ofsensation open, passive and receptive.121 Then I proceed to charge and vitalizethe sphere by vibrating the divine name again and again, until it seems to myperceptions that all the mercurial forces of the universe react to the magneticattraction of that sphere. All the forces of the universe are imagined to converge"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"upon my sphere, attracting to me just those books, documents, critics, friendsand so on, needed to further my work. Inevitably, after persistent andconcentrated work I hear from friends or booksellers quite by chance, so itwould seem, that these books are available. Introductions are procured to theright people, and taken by and large my work is assisted. The results occur,however, in a perfectly natural way. One is not to imagine that the use of thesemethods contravenes the known laws of nature and that miraculous phenomenawill occur. Far from it. There is nothing in them that is supernatural. Thesemethods are based upon the use of psychic principles normally latent withinman, and which everyone possesses. No individual is unique in this respect.And the use of these psychic principles brings results through quite normal butunsuspected channels.On the other hand, should I desire to help a patient who has literaryaspirations but at a certain juncture finds his style cramped and the free flow ofideas inhibited, I should alter my method in one particular point only. Instead ofusing orange as before, I should visualize the aura as of a yellow or goldencolor, though the vibratory name would be the same. Again, instead ofimagining the universal forces to have a centripetal motion towards my sphere,I should attempt to realize that the mercurial forces awakened within me by thecolor visualization and vibration are being projected from me to my patient. Ifhe, too, becomes quiet and meditative at the same hour, my help becomes morepowerful since he consciously assists my efforts with a similar meditation. Butthis need not be insisted upon. For, as shown by telepathy experiments, thegreater part of the receiver’s impressions are unconsciously received.Therefore, in the case of the patient, his own unconscious psyche will pick upautomatically and of necessity the inspiration and power I have telepathicallyforwarded to him in absentia.This system combines telepathic suggestion with the willed communication ofvital power. I strenuously oppose those partitive apologists who uphold intheory the one faculty to the detriment of the other. Some deny suggestion ortelepathy, and argue overenthusiastically on behalf of vital magnetism. Othersrefuse categorically to admit the existence of magnetism, pressing their proofs"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"exclusively in favor of telepathy and suggestion. Both, to my mind, are incorrectand dogmatic when insisting upon their idea alone as having universal validityor as being the sole logical mode of explanation. Equally, each is right in somerespects and in a certain number of cases; there is a place for both in the naturaleconomy of things. The resources of nature are both great and extensive enoughto admit the mutual existence of both of them, and innumerable other powersalso.The technical procedure is, as I have shown, extremely simple—even whereemployed for subjective ends. Suppose the realization suddenly comes to methat instead of being the magnanimous person I had imagined myself to be I amreally mean and stingy. Of course I could go through a course of psychoanalysisto discover why my nature early in life had become warped so that a habit ofmeanness was engendered. But this is a lengthy and costly business—badarguments, possibly, against its necessity. And so much would depend upon theanalyst and his relations with myself. Instead, however, I might resort to thefollowing technique. My first steps consist of those described above—rhythmicbreathing, the light-shaft formulated from head to foot, and the circulation offorce through the aura. Then remembering that a generous outlook upon, and anattitude towards life is a Jupiterian quality, I would surround myself with anazure sphere whilst vibrating frequently and powerfully the divine name El. Itdepends entirely upon one’s skill and familiarity with the system whether thenames are vibrated silently or audibly, but by either way, powerful Jupiteriancurrents would permeate my being. I would even visualize every cell beingbathed in an ocean of blueness; and I would attempt to imagine currentsinvading my sphere from every direction, so that all my thinking and feeling isliterally in terms of blueness. Slowly a subtle transformation ensues. That is, itwould were I really sincere, desirous of correcting my faults, and if I didattempt to become generous enough as to perform the practice faithfully andoften.Likewise, if a friend or patient complained of a similar vice in him, appealingto me for help, in this instance I would use a positive color for projection. Iwould formulate my sphere as an active dynamic purple sphere, rich and royal"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"in color, and project its generous, healing, and fecund influence upon his mindand personality. With time the fault would be corrected to his satisfaction andthus enhance his spiritual nature.And so on, with everything else. The few examples will, I am sure, haveshown the application of the methods.It is not enough simply to wish for certain results and idly expect them tofollow. Failure only can come from such an idle course. Anything worthwhileand likely to succeed requires a great deal of work and perseverance. TheMiddle Pillar technique is certainly no exception. But devotion to it isextremely worthwhile because of the nature and quality of the results whichfollow. Once a day will demonstrate the efficacy of the method. Twice a daywould be much better—especially if there is some illness or psychic difficultyto overcome. After a while, the student who is sincere and in whom thespiritual nature is gradually unfolding, will apply himself to the methods quiteapart from the promise which I have here held out. Healing powers, freedomfrom poverty and worry, happiness—all these are eminently desirable. But overand above all of these is the desirability of knowing and expressing thespiritual Self within—though it may be in some cases that this ideal is hardlyattainable until some measure of fulfilment in other respects and on other levelshas been achieved. When, however, the ideal is realized as desirable, the valueof this method will also be realized as supremely effectual to that end.[contents]109. The method presented in the following pages is the “Exercise of the Middle Pillar,” a Golden Dawntechnique that Regardie effectively made his own. It was described at length in his book The MiddlePillar. (See The Middle Pillar: The Balance Between Mind and Magic.)110. In many of Regardie’s early texts, he used the name Jehovah rather than the more correct YHVH.Jehovah was a Latinized version of the Hebrew godname YHVH, the Tetragrammaton or “four-letteredname.” Most Golden Dawn magicians prefer to use YHVH (Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh) rather than Jehovah.For the purposes of this text, we have changed all instances of Jehovah to YHVH.111. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn developed a system of color correspondence known as theFour Color Scales, which were used to correlate the color attributions of various elemental, astrological,and sephirotic energies on the Qabalistic Tree of Life. Of these color scales, the most important are the"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"King Scale (the positive, masculine, outgoing force) and the Queen Scale (the negative, feminine, andreceptive force). King Scale or positive colors can be used for sending out energy; Queen Scale ornegative colors can be used for receiving energy.112. Yellow would normally be the positive color associated with the element of Air. Lavender is thepositive color associated with Daath, or the throat center. The remainder of the colors given in thefollowing paragraph are the positive colors of the elements.113. As Regardie stressed later, anyone suffering from disease should be under the care of a competentphysician.114. Or rather, as Regardie indicated later, these methods should certainly go far in alleviating the originalcondition.115. In addition to healing, Regardie stressed that the Exercise of the Middle Pillar was suitable forapplication to a host of other problems, whether it be a problem of poverty, character development, socialor marital difficulties, etc.116 . The positive or King Scale color of Venus is green, while the negative or Queen Scale color is actuallysky blue. Regardie may be conflating the Queen Scale color of Netzach (the seventh Sephirah on theTree of Life corresponding to Venus) with the King Scale color of the planet Venus.117 . We have changed the Ashkenazic “Tzavoos” to the Sephardic “Tzavaoth” and “Tzabaoth,” since theHebrew letter Beth is used for the sound of “v” as well as “b.”118. The passive color of Mercury is violet. The passive color of the eighth Sephirah of Hod, whichcorresponds to Mercury, is orange.119. The passive color of the Moon is silver. The passive color of the ninth Sephirah of Yesod, whichcorresponds to the Moon, is violet.120. See footnote 118.121. See APPENDIX II for more information on the use of positive and negative colors associated withthe Qabalistic energy centers."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"IAPPENDIX IICorrespondences for Healing Ritualsn The Art of True Healing, Regardie laid out the basics of the Middle Pillarexercise, in which he divided up the five Qabalistic energy centers locatedalong the center of the human body in accordance with their elementalcorrespondences. One section of that essay in particular described how thecolors of the various energy centers can be utilized for healing, physical andmental regeneration, and inner alchemy.Regardie suggested using the negative or Queen Scale colors in visualizationsthat involve the person who is actually performing the exercise. In Regardie’swords, “I employ the negative color because it tends to make the sphere ofsensation open, passive and receptive.” 122 Conversely, if the practitioner isperforming the exercise for someone else’s benefit, he or she would employ thepositive or King Scale color when visualizing the other person, because the actof projecting energy to another is a positive, stimulating act. The personreceiving the benefit of the exercise can aid the process by remaining receptiveand open.The following is a list of all the basic Qabalistic energies that can be used inthis regard, not just the five centers of the Middle Pillar.
