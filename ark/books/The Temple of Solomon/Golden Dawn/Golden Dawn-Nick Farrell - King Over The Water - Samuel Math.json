In the late 193os, Israel Re­gardie, a student of the Order, published the rituals and teachings of the Bristol Temple of the Stella Matutina, which was a direct descendant of the original Golden Dawn. Subsequent publications, many of excellent quality, have supplemented our knowledge ofboth the teaching and history of the original Order. With its teachings published and history evaluated, the Order's methodology has mostly been laid bare. By the tail end of the 2oth Century this availability ofinformation enabled various re-enactment groups to be established. Some of these groups are sound, with membership dedicated to performing the laudable goals of self-development and spiritual awakening. Unfortunately, other groups border on religious or political cults, typically centred upon a single leader. These latter groups often evoke the turbulent history of the original order to justify the structures and cult of personality they wish to build. These \"mythicians\" often claim that the original Golden Dawn floundered because the majority of its members discarded the rule of its fo under and chief Samuel \"MacGregor\" 1-.Iathers. Typically, such groups claim a link to that section of the Golden Dawn Order which continued to acknowledge Mathers as its Chief and was later known as: the Alpha et Omega , or AO. Occasionally, such leaders claim to be the living incarnation of MacGregor Mathers himself. Lately, there have even been those who claim to be in communication with the same Secret Chiefs that inspired Mathers. Mathers' ghost and his mythically perfect AO enable them to claim that somehow their product is superior.

These claims have generated a backlash amongst other Golden Dawners who state, with different evidence, that the real genius of the Golden Dawn was William Wynn Westcott and that Mathers was only obeying orders. Both sides suffer from the fact that much of the historical material has been interpreted by those who have never worked the Golden Dawn system of magic. Some have little interest in it beyond a literary curiosity, while others have an outright hatred fo r the system. To date, the key Golden Dawn historians have been R.A. Gilbert and Ellie Howe. While both have done sterling work, neither have held any fo ndness fo r their subject. Others, who have an interest in the poetry of Yeats, often miss some of the magical ideas which inspired him. Still others, such as Ithell Colquhoun, want to transform various individuals within the historical Golden Dawn into gods or goddesses. In so doing, they choose to fashion mortals into figures that can only be respected, but not understood. As a result we have various histories which reflect various lines of thought without trying to understand causes. Stripping an understanding of the magical systems of the time from a history of the Golden Dawn, as Howe did, is like a militant atheist trying to write a history of the Catholic Church without mentioning God. All that is seen are pointless rituals, political infighting, and people generally behaving badly. Those who want to make Mathers and Westcott into gods are like those who try to talk about the Catholic Church by assuming that it mirrored perfectly what Jesus really had in mind, with the Popes infallible. Those who write histories of the Golden Dawn fo cused on Yeats, without understanding the system of magic that dominated his life, are like those who think we can understand Neil Armstrong by looking at the Moon. Lately there has been another trend in which people who fo llow the Golden Dawn system try to bend historical facts to suit the tweaks which they have made to the system. It seems to be an American thing to sell Westcott's bogus history as a literal truth and then try to pull up supporting evidence on that premise. That is not to say that such historical articles are a waste of"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"NICI(F.Al(R§LL time. Those interested in the Golden Dawn need to read all of them and reach their own conclusions. This is more or less what I have done. But what I fo und, reviewing the same material that other historians have used, is that there is a different story to be fo und if you have been working the Golden Dawn system. Knowledge of what happens when you perform various types of magic, and more importantly, how you would explain these experiences to others, affects how you see some of the primary sources. Misunderstandings by some of the core historians are often repeated by others as facts and lead to many myths becoming set in stone. In 2on, one of my more popular blog articles was a list of myths that people thought were true about the Golden Dawn ... but weren't. The list included things like: the Golden Dawn was never called the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (HOGD). That name was invented by Regardie fo r his book. The First Order was called the Golden Dawn in the Outer (GDO), although on some letterheads it was called the Esoteric Order of the Golden Dawn. Hermetic Order does appear on some letter heads and course material but it was never the Order's name. There are a fe w myths connected to the famous Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram which neophytes were taught in the Order. First there was the idea that the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram was the primary magical tool. The original Golden Dawn taught the invoking pentagram with the banishing pentagram as just a footnote in the original knowledge paper, while later there was a move to make it part of a clearing of ritual space. There is also a belief that the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram is elemental, with Air being invoked in the East, Fire in the South, Water in the West and Earth in the North. This was never taught. This idea comes from Wicca, which confused the ritual with the much later Supreme Ritual of the Pentagram, which was elemental and connected to the Enochian Tablets. It is also a myth that Golden Dawn rituals are colourful when, other than a few diagrams, there was little colour in the GO. The Tablets were black and white, or white with red lettering. The Tarot was black and white, and most of the officers were dressed in black or white robes. All this had the effect of making the first appearance of the Vault even more memorable, as the Second Order is very colourful: * It is a moot point if this was ever intended. The fact that there were two coloured diagrams in the CD=[iQ] and the Hierophant's robes were red would"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"18 f\\!NG OVER.Jhe W.A TEI( Historically the myths continue with the classic story that Westcott had to quit the GD because Mathers hid some Second Order papers with his name and address on them in a taxi. As we will see later in this book, Westcott quit because of personal problems (something to do with not working with women fo r a while) and the fact that he fo und it impossible to work with an increasingly paranoid and unstable Mathers. It did have something to do with meeting his superiors on I) March I) 1897, and he resigned a couple of days later. Darcy Kiintz also does not believe that it was Mathers who framed him, but provides some good reasons why it was Berridge. Westcott confirmed that someone had been contacting his work place and was out to get him, but never said what the problem was. It was unlikely that this was the sole reason fo r him quitting. Just before he quit, Westcott was \"promoted\" with a key title by Mathers. This is strange and unnecessary if Mathers was going to frame him. The taxi cab story was coined by Crowley many years after the fact and was probably made up. The quote was that as a coroner he was \"paid to sit on stiffs not raise them,\" which is pure Crowley. Crowley might have received the false story from Mathers, but it is incredibly unlikely that Mathers would have profaned his own material by giving it to the great unwashed. As we will later see, when Westcott joined Mathers' .AO, he had his name and address put on the .AO labels so that if someone died the material would be returned to him. Hardly wise if his employers had made him choose between his job as a coroner and the Golden Dawn. In addition, at this time Westcott was the head of SocietaJ J?.Esicruciana in .A11glia (SRIA). Given that Masons populated all levels of the establishment it is unlikely that any of them would have objected to his GD membership. Some of the myths about the Golden Dawn rituals can be sourced to Israel Regardie. Many see him as an expert on the Golden Dawn rituals, but Regardie said that he only attended seven rituals within the Bristol Temple. At the time of Regardie's membership, Bristol was using abridged rituals and, according to Regardie, their ritual skills were lacking. He did not think much of the Golden Dawn rituals and fo r most of his life advocated doing the @=[Q] and then making indicate that the policy was more coincidence and it was simply easier to reproduce black and white diagrams."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"NJCI(F.Al(R.§LL 19 the student do \\Vatchtower rituals before the Portal and G)=lKl. Many have assumed that Regardie obtained most of his Golden Dawn expertise from Crowley. However, Regardie said that the Great Beast never taught him any magic. Most of the information Regardie learnt from Bristol was through letters, and while it was clear he worked very hard on the material he had minimal opportunity to obtain ritual experience and never filled an officer's role in Bristol. Anyone who has worked the system will inform you that it is lived in practice. Regardie's only real GD temple experience occurred when he acted as Hierophant during several @=[Q] initiations in the late 197os and two G)=[§] grades in 1982. Lately, as the Golden Dawn has become more public, questions naturally arise about rituals being performed above the G)=[§] grade. It is a myth that the early Golden Dawn or .AO carried out initiation rituals above G'>=C§J. In the original Golden Dawn there were no ®=[3] or G)=@] rituals. A fe w individuals held these titles, but they appeared to have been awarded by proclamation. The pre-1892 G)=[§] grade was also \"awarded\" by this method prior to the creation of a working Second Order. In J:Vhare Rg, there were rituals written fo r the ®=[3], G)=@] and ®=OJ. There were rumours of a ®=llJ rite as well, but I have never been able to find one. These higher grade rituals were rare, but at least they existed. Mathers wrote ®=[3] and G)=@] rituals fo r his.AO, but there is nothing to suggest that they were actually performed during his lifetime. Grades above the G>=ffiJ appear to have been honorary and amounted to writing a cheque to Mathers. He then handed over a new set of passwords, a grade adornment and a new sash, but the honorary grades did not include any significant new teachings. These grades appear to have been largely restricted to Temple Chiefs. Some later .AO members traveled to New Zealand to receive an initiation into the ®=[3] and G)=@J. I will be tackling some other legends, such as the old chestnut that Westcott fo rged the Cypher Manuscripts and the myth that Fraulein Sprengel's first name was Anna, later in this book. I have also brought in more information which was unavailable when all the great histories were written. For this I am grateful to two of the great preservers of Golden Dawn material, Darcy Kiintz and R.A. Gilbert."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"20 1\\!NG OYER.Jhe W.A TEI( No listing of the mythology surrounding the Golden Dawn would be complete without mentioning one of its most prolific sources, Aleister Crowley. His meddling is a recurring theme. As a self-publicist, Crowley invented many myths to talk up his own importance within the Order, and he had a considerable interest in making other members appear like idiots. Some ofhis \"stories\" about the Looking Glass trial, fo r example, fo und an unlikely believer in the fo rm of Arthur \\Vaite, who, as a journalist who would have covered court proceedings, should have known better.· For those who look, the histories merge to create a human picture of a group of magicians who were influential throughout the first half of the 2oth Century. By understanding where these people were coming fr om, we can start to understand how the modern Golden Dawn movement has developed and see some of the mistakes it is making. \\Ve can also uncover the rubbish which some of the modern Golden Dawn leaders are spouting to establish their own dubious positions. The key to all of the fact and fantasy is Samuel Mathers. His exit from the Golden Dawn is seen by many as the spiritual crown departing from the organisation. He was the genius of the Golden Dawn in the way that Steve Jobs was seen as the genius of Apple, with pundits claiming that neither organisations could properly fu nction without them. But the truth of the matter is that organisations can, and do, carry on without their fo unders, often producing new and better material. In the case of the Golden Dawn, the magical members joined the Stella Matutina, which only shuts its doors in the late 197os under the name T¥hare J?.e. Those who favoured a mystical approach fo llowed Waite and placed themselves under a more masonic influence. This group changed its rituals several times and still exists today. Mt er Mathers' death, his .AO order became more magical before finally spluttering out 30 years later. Clearly the Golden Dawn managed to survive the death of its genius. Indeed, the membership of the last Golden Dawn group with direct lineage to the Golden Dawn, T¥hare Rein New Zealand, had • Waite believed that Crowley's reporting of the Looking Glass trial was accurate and therefore protected by what is known as privilege. Privilege only applies if the reporting is accurate.

In the year when it closed its doors, \"by coincidence\" Chic Cicero opened his Golden Dawn temple in Georgia. His Hennetic Order of the Golden Dawn has more than 20 temples scattered throughout the world and managed to make a truly international Order. Rivals to Cicero have dusted off Mathers and his .AO as the perfect Golden Dawn order. They were assisted in this fantasy by the fa ct that the rituals of the .AO had not been published. Some of them went so far as to use Regardie's heavily-edited Bristol Temple rituals, with a couple of tweaks, and pretended that they were the true .AO versions. They were able to get away with this because there was a gap in the knowledge of many students of the Golden Dawn, which made the original rituals a mystery and the .AO rite virtually unknown. This enabled those who wanted to make a buck or two from the gullible to either print what they liked and claim that it was .AO, or use some of the real rites which were languishing in the more obscure libraries. The fa ct that they possessed this material was seen by their fo llowers as proof that they had some lineage to the .AO and, through that, to the original Golden Dawn. This particular scam was easy as most of the early .AO papers were lost or destroyed, limiting what is available to the more easily fo und papers of the Golden Dawn, Stella Matutina and later .AO. By chance, however, some early .AO papers were uncovered by Melissa Seims, mislabeled in the Witch Museum that belonged to the fo under of modern Witchcraft, Gerald Gardner; not the usual haunt fo r those searching fo r Golden Dawn material. It is interesting to note how much the Golden Dawn might have influenced Gardner and one of his important early initiates, Doreen Valiente, as they hatched out what was to become Wicca. What made these .A 0 papers important is that they show what was really going on in the .AO immediately after the end of the original Golden Dawn and fo r the first 18 years of the new .Alpha et Omega Order. What became clear during the writing of Mather/ La.rt Secret was that none of the genius that created the Golden Dawn was present in the new .AO. There were fe w new teachings and those which were available were not as well slotted into the Golden Dawn system.

Likewise, the G)===ffi] was the same. In addition to this, I fo und that Mathers had created a list of short cuts, which sped up the ritual and allowed fo r large scale initiations. It made a mockery of the magical structure of the early Order and was possibly designed to maximise the size of the Order. This indicated that he had moved to a more \"Masonic\" style of operation, where the working of the ritual and the understanding of its symbolism was more important than the magical effect. My comments about the Masonic style of working were seized upon as proof that \"Nick Farrell is anti-mason.\" This is not true, as I was a Mason fo r many years and resigned when I had lefi: the United Kingdom. But there are different mindsets involved in the two approaches to ritual and I have always preferred the magical methods. Once the Second Order, and the Z documents in particular, had been added to the Golden Dawn system, there was no way but fo r the Golden Dawn to be magical. To return to a Masonic approach was a step backwards fo r someone who was supposed to be a magical genius. In 2on, Mather/ La.rt Secret was released. In fact this book, King over the Water, was supposed to be released first. This book deals with more historical themes, and aims to work out who really was the genius of the Golden Dawn. Above all I wanted to look at the his­tory of the Golden Dawn within its context as a magical order. Mathers' La.rt Secret shows the unpublished rituals and teaching of the .AO. Its publication broke like a storm over the .AO sham. One group was fo rced to admit that it was just using copies ofRegardie's book, and at the insistence of its members used the real.AO rituals fo r the first time. One \"re-incarnation ofMathers\" was removed from his group. Another group claimed their Secret Chiefimmediately wrote new rituals fo r them because the old ones had been \"profaned.\" One group backtracked on its claims to Mathers' godhood and claimed that it had said all along that Mathers had lost his contact with the Secret Chiefs because he had been too public. Apparently, on the orders of these Secret ChiefS, I had been kicked out of the Second Order and could go no further in the Golden Dawn tradition. Such is the mentality of self-proclaimed and self-taught High Adepts of the Modern Golden Dawn!\" • It is truly Kafkaesque when someone believes that you can be kicked out of an"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"N!Cl(F.Al(R.§LL 2'\"' ) Others accused me ofbreaking my oath by publishing the book. I have made several oaths in my Golden Dawn life and at no point did they ever mention propping up the egos, fantasies, or outright lies, of others. It is impossible fo r someone to pretend that they have a direct lineage to the .AO, refuse to provide proof and then expect people to obey their will. The delusional and controlling mentality of these types can be seen in the 199os, when one group, which claimed to be the real.AO, wrote a letter to a library housing a large Golden Dawn collection demanding that i'tJ material be turned over to them. As you would expect, they were ignored. It is the ignorance of students which leads to such types ending up as Golden Dawn leaders. The internet has given them a rise to prominence that they would not have managed in any other period of history. What is unfortunate is that many of them are great gatherers of papers relating to the Golden Dawn, which they hand out sparingly to their students as proof of their status. The only way to break the cult-like power of such abusive types using unpublished Golden Dawn material is to take away their toys. Informed students, who have access to information, no longer have to believe tall tales and accept rubbish on faith. Contrary to what many of them will tell you, there is no damage in releasing this information because you can hide esoteric teaching in plain sight. The fact that they have had access to such documents fo r years and they are as undeveloped as they were decades ago is probably a sign that spiritual transformation does not come from documents, but from doing the work and understanding it. Finally, I want to point out that the aim of my books is not to carry out a hatchet job on Mathers. Nor am I using the material to attack any of the modern orders. My own spiritual history can be traced to Mathers through the .AO connected Builders of the .Adytum, Servants of the Light and Pharos. It is also linked to the Stella Matuti'na via Regardie and Chic Cicero's Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and finally through my Wh are Rg teachers and the Order of the Ta ble �und. My own Golden Dawn order, the Magical Order of the .Auroa .Aurea, is a traditional Golden Dawn order based on the teaching of the New Zealand Order Smaragdum Thalaues, which is more commonly known as Wh are J?,g • All these things were order, which you are not a member, fo r breaking an oath you never made, by a Secret Chief who does not exist."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"JqNG OVER.Jhe W.A TEI( dependant upon Mathers' life and involvement.

What is interesting is that those who made the claim that I was attacking the Community when I published Mather/ La.rt Secret were in \"communities\" of one and refused to talk to others working within the tradition. Instead, I think that the story of the JV.ng over the Water is a cau­tionary tale fo r any would-be magical leaders. Mathers had access to something magical, but thanks to a fatal flaw lost it because he could not separate fantasy from reality. It is a warning that a true magical order grows and develops and even the leaders can find themselves out of their depths.

Not even his co- chief and fo rmer friend Samuel Mathers could argue with that. Westcott was born at Leamington in \\Varwickshire on 17 December 1848. His father was Dr. Peter \\Vestcott. He was the youngest of six children and didn't get on particularly well with any of them.\" After the death ofhis parents he moved to Martock in Somerset to live with an uncle, and began his working life as a pharmacist before training as a medical practitioner. He was married to Elizabeth Burnett and in 188o he moved to London where he \"retired\" fo r two years to study occultism and raise a family of fo ur children. He became the deputy coroner fo r Central Middlesex and Central London, and in 1894 was appointed coroner fo r North East London. In his professional field Westcott was fa mous fo r his views on sui­cide, which was still a crime in the United Kingdom at the time. In his book Suicide: Its Hutory, Literature, Jumprude11ce, Ca watio11, a11d Preven­tio11 (1885'), Westcott described suicide as a \"social problem\" and not a crime.t He was one of the first to suggest a closer look at the mental states and emotions of victims. He recommended particular attention to melancholia, despair, and misery in an effort to cut the number of deaths by suicide. Ironically his second daughter was to kill herself, as did his son and almost certainly his wife. * See R.A.

London pointed out that the most startling thing about this incident of a wo man's death is the smug complacency with which the officials, i.e. Westcott, looked upon it and rendered judgement. That an old woman of seventy-seven years of age should die of self-neglect is the most optimistic way possible oflooking at it. It was the old woman's fault that she died, and having located the responsibility, society goes contentedly on about its own affairs, London wrote.

Again it was Irwin who brought him into this group after obtaining the Charter in 18;8 from an American sea captain. But more pivotal to this story is when Irwin brought Westcott into the Metropolitan College of the Societa.r R.p,sicruciana in .Ang!ia (SRJ.A) on I) April 188o, and in 1883 he was elected Secretary General of the Society. The SRJ.A was established in 1867 by Robert \\Ventworth Little, following his admission into an earlier Scottish masonic Rosi­crucian body. It was later claimed, fal sely, that the Society had been fo unded on the basis ofRosicrucian documents fo und in the archives of Grand Lodge. These \"documents\" were simply a manuscript trans­lation into English of the Secret Sy mbolr of the R.p,sicruciaru, a symbolic work produced between q8; and q88 with links to the German Order of the Go!de11 and R.p,sy Cross. Masonry and its various side orders, degrees and grades did not admit women. But during the latter part of the 19th Century there was also an interest in psychics, spiritualism, astrology and occultism. Both men and women became fascinated with the whole business. It fast became a fe ature in Victorian society in much the same way as the New Age movement became part of the late 2oth Century. The time was ripe fo r a school to teach men and women hermetic science and magic, and it was the Golden Dawn that would fill this gap. The beginnings of the Golden Dawn are shrouded by a fo ggy mixture of myth, fo rgery and truth. There are several fairly plausible stories, any of which could conceivably be true or partly true. The least likely is the official history, which was written by Westcott.

These were names which would be meaningless to most people other than the Freemasons and occultists he wanted to recruit to the Golden Dawn. For the others, he claimed that the fo unders of the Golden Dawn had links to Theosophical doctrines from an original source traced back to the original Rosicrucians of medieval Germany. Once he had traced the Golden Dawn's history as far back as the Rosicru­cians, it was possible to link its secret teaching to Moses and the An­cient Mysteries. The technique is similar to that peddled by the writers of\"esoteric history\" in which the Templars, the Holy Grail, and the Priory oj'Z:i.,on are all linked to important events by clever but somewhat dubious logic. The official history goes on to claim that Westcott received some papers written in cypher from a masonic friend, the Rev. Adolphus \\Voodford. Woodford had allegedly picked them up \"from a dealer in curios.\" \\Vhen Westcott decoded them using a code fo und in Trithe­mius's Polygraphiae (1)61), they turned out to be the skeleton of a ritual system fo r a Hermetic Order that admitted both men and women. \\Vestcott claimed he translated them and placed them in the hands of \"an eminent Kabbalist and Hermetic Student\", S.L. MacGregor Mathers, \"for revision, and to render them suitable for English stu­dents of the present day.\" Amongst the manuscripts was an address in code, with a short message, in a different hand and written from left to right, whereas the rest of the cypher was from right to left. This message, when translated, read: Sapie1u dom aJt is a chief among the me1nbers of the !fJldene dammenmg [.r:e., Golden Dawn J she is a Jam ow soror her name is Friiulein sprmgel letters reach her at herr f mger hotel mar'luardt stuttgart she is 7 = 4 [figures in Hebrew characters J or a chief adept.

Sprengel was so impressed that Westcott had decoded the manuscript that she gave him permission to set up a new branch of the Order as a successor to the Hermanubis Temple which had ceased to exist in the United Kingdom, owing to the decease of all of its Chiefs. Sprengel demanded that there should be three chiefs, so Westcott appointed Dr. William Woodman, who was Supreme Magus of the Sl?J.A, and Mathers to be his co­chiefs. According to Westcott, soon after the new Isis-Urania Temple of the Golden Dawn was established, Sprengel died and her fe llow Chiefs declared that they no longer wished to support the new Temple as it was too public fo r their liking. That was the official history which was presented to Golden Dawn students. In fact it was changed and adapted over the years as different things became important. But Westcott's story was fishy. \\Vhile a German lineage was attractive to the romantics, it was also very hard to check. A cynical Ellie Howe in his Magiciaru of the Goldm Dawn\" claimed to have fo und the smoking gun in the letters that Westcott claimed to have received from Sprengel. He turned them over to German language expert and Zurich graphologist Oskar Schlag, who managed to confirm that they had been written by an English person pretending to be German. Howe suggested that Westcott wrote letters to Sprengel and asked an employee, Albert Essinger, to translate them fo r him. West­cott never posted the translations. He then drafted fake replies from Sprengel in English and got another, unknown, German speaker to translate his reply into German. He would give that to Essinger to translate. This method had the advantage that Essinger was a witness to the transaction. Later, Essinger would provide a letter saying he helped translate the letters. The proof is in the fact that the Sprengel letters used words that were often a literal translation and spelling mis­takes which were common fo r English people speaking German, but never fo r a native speaker. More recent work on the letters suggests that while this might be true for modern German it might not have been the case with older versions of the language. It has always been assumed that Sprengel was German, rather than just living in Germany. There were a lot of people * Ellie Howe, The Magicianr ofthe Go!dm Dawn, p. 7·"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"1(]NG OVEJ(fhe W.A TEJ( living in the country to whom German was a second language. Also the letters appear to be written in a style ofhandwriting which was current about that time, which is difficult to read, let alone fo rge. Attempts to link the handwriting with a specific type have been unsuccessful, but some believe it is representative of the Siitterlinschrift script which was used in German schools and is considered the archetype of \"Old German\". Siitterlinschrift was not developed until 1911 and did not become common until the Nazi period. When looking at Siitterlinschrift and trying to compare it to the Sprengel letters it reminded me of looking at ink blots where people see what they want to see. I could not see it in Siitterlinschrift and would be inclined to have believed it was a mix of the early German Kurrentschrift script mixed with Latin. If it was Siitterlinschrift I would have been even more suspicious and seen it as proof that Westcott fo rged the letters, and much later than many have expected. The letters were not the smoking gun Howe thought they were. Westcott apologists could come up with some fairly good reasons why the Sprengel letters would appear as they did. Indeed, if they were a fo rgery, Westcott could have done a much better job of it. If it was as badly written as Howe claimed, then it would have been next to useless for Westcott's purposes. It would not fo ol any members of the Golden Dawn who could read German, nor would it have survived the test of time ifhis Order was going to last as long as SRJA. In 2011, Christopher Mcintosh of the University ofExeter man­aged to demolish much of Howes' argument. He points out that the English translation was so bad that if Westcott had made an earlier draft, or perhaps dictated the letter, he would have ended up with a translation which was too different from his draft to be useful. But he did find a smoking gun that Howe had missed. In German the sex of a person is apparent when the correspondent uses an adjective to refer to himself or herself. This is because the ending of an adjective has to agree with the gender of the noun it qualifies. No w when I came to the second letter from S.D..A., I was astonished to see that the writer sz\"gfted off as 'lhr gan'{_ ergebener' (your devoted), the point being that both the possessive pronoun 'lhr' and the adjective ergebener' were masculine . .At first I thought this might, by a long stretch of the imagir1ation, be a slip on the part of the amanuensis, but"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"NICI(F.Al(R.§LL when I read on through the letters I fo und that whenever an adJective or possessive pronoun was used to refer to the writer the ending was always masculine. Th en came the final letter, written in .Au gpt by a different correspondent with the motto 'Ex 'Vno Dirce Omne/ (From One Leam .All), in which the death of S. D . .A. was reported (again in incorrect Gennan) as follows: 'E.r irt mir sehr le id, dar ich Euch an{!igen mus den SterbifaJI unseres gelehrten Fre undes S. D..A.

So now there was no shadow ojdoubt: S. D . .A.­whether real or invented-was a man! Fr aulein Spr engel either never existed or was someone else entirely.· )I Mcintosh wonders how Westcott could have not realised that he was corresponding with a man and believes that there were two possibilities. The first assumes that it was all a fo rgery. Westcott uses two translators, Essinger and another, and writes a fake letter to S.D.A. and drafts a pretend reply, which he gives to someone he knows in England who has some (but imperfect) knowle dge of German and can write Gothic script. But Westcott fo rgets to tell the final translator that Sprengel was a woman. This translator assumes that S.D.A. is male and writes the letters accordingly. The German text of each letter is then given to Essinger, who simply translates them into English. He does not think about the gender because he does not know that Westcott's correspondent is supposed to be fe male either. As the English translation does not indicate the gender, Westcott never finds out about the discrepancy. And so the misunderstanding continues right through the final letter announcing S.D. A.'s death. Mcintosh proposes another scenario based on the assertion that the letters were real. The note could easily be read to confuse two people, S.D.A. and Fr aulein Sprengel. Westcott duly wrote to Sprengel, care of Herr Enger at the Hotel Marquardt in Stuttgart, enclosing a letter to S.D.A. and using the motto rather than the name Fr a'ulein Sprengel. He gets the first reply from S.D.A. and thinks he is talking to Sprengel. The correspondence continues and perhaps Westcott twigs that he is not talking to Sprengel but S.D.A. He cannot mention this because S.D.A. is now important to his plans.

It would also mean that he would have breathed a sigh of relief when S.D.A. decided to break contact. But the Sprengelletters are simply too convenient to be a viable story. Sprengel pops up out of nowhere, gives Westcott what he wants, and then conveniently dies so that he can run it by himself with no help or teaching. That is almost enough to prove that Westcott fo rged the Sprengel link. There is not a single autocratic head of any esoteric order who would have behaved like Sprengel. Heads of orders rarely tell complete strangers to set up an order with the minimum amount of teaching or control, simply on the basis of a correct translation of a document they are not supposed to have. Occult leaders, particularly of that period, were not democratic. If Sprengel was a Chief Adept then she would not have bowed to the will of her group, not unless the whole lot had risen up with pitchforks and torches, and even then she would have gone down fighting. Besides, why would Sprengel's group have gotten upset about a group in a far off country, which did not use its name, rituals or teachings, being a little more public than it liked? It is possible that \\Vestcott arranged fo r the Sprengel address translation to be fo rged too. Friiulein Sprengel happened to have the same motto, Sapiens Dominabitur Astris, as \\Vestcott's pin­up Anna Kingsford, who died in the year that the Golden Dawn was born •. Kingsford had fo rmed a Hermetic group within the Theosophical Society and Westcott was a member of it. He certainly admired her and it is possible that he took the inspiration of a mixed magical order from her. One of the later myths of the Golden Dawn was that it was \"Anna\" Sprengel who wrote the letters. In fact the name Anna was never used by Westcott and was the work of some of the later \"research\" ofDr. R.W. Felkin which has lead many people astray. \\Ve will see some more ofhis research later.

Howe was more certain that they had some degree of authenticit y, but they were not as old as Westcott claimed. More recently, work on the Cypher Manuscript has been carried out by Golden Dawn historians R.A. Gilbert and Darcy Kiinrz·. Gilbert advances the fo llowing plausible scenario which Kiintz fo llowed. It returns to the theme of the 186o and 189o burst of enthusiasm fo r Fringe Masonry. The leaders of this are names fa miliar in this story: Robert Little, Frederick Hockley, Kenneth Mackenzie, F.G. Irwin, John Yarker and Westcott. This band was assembling rites and orders. Some were from rituals that had been found in libraries in the United Kingdom or Europe, while others leapt fr om the minds of the people fo rming these orders. One of the most important was the Societas R.p,sicruciana in Anglia (SRIA), which was the brain child ofLittle and WJ. Hughan. The SR.JA owed its grade structure and inspiration to a German esoteric order called the Gold und R.p,senkreur: This grade structure, which was printed in Mackenzie's R.Eyal Masonic Cy clopaedia, is similar to that which was adopted by the Golden Dawn. However, the SRJA was, and still is, a study society concerned with hermetic subjects. Other than the grade rituals, the thought of performing magic was not considered by the Society. Mackenzie wanted to fo rm a group which worked practical magic. According to letters between Mathers and \\Vestcott, by 1883 Mackenzie had fo rmed a group called the Society ojEight. According to Gilbert, t the Society of Eight was founded by either Frederick Holland or Mackenzie. Its members at various times included F. G. Irwin, Benjamin Cox, Frederick Hockley, Mackenzie, John Yarker, \\Vestcott, and \\Villiam Alexander Ayton. Since Mackenzie was the best ritualist it was his job to write up the rituals. He had a deep understanding of many aspects of Hermetisicm, all of which fo und their way into the Cypher Manuscript. Indeed the only thing missing from Mackenzie's extensive knowledge base was that he never referred to Enochian material. ' Darcy Kiintz, Cypher ManuJcriptJ ofthe Goldm Dawn, Holmes Publishing.

But Mackenzie could not have written rituals with the Society of Eight in mind. Crucially the Society of Eight was a Masonic order fo r which you had to be male to join. But the first words of the Cypher Manuscript were \"Fratres and Sorores,\" which implied that the ritual was being designed fo r men and women. One group that did allow the membership of men and women, and with which Mackenzie had a crucial involvement, was the Order of Sat B 'hai. • This allowed women into the first five grades, and had a teaching programme that was similar to that of the Golden Dawn. One of the key members of the Sat B'hai was Benjamin Cox, who would later become the Chief of the Osiris Temple of the Golden Dawn. R.A. Gilbert suggests that Mackenzie wanted to fo rm another ordert that composed of men and women but used practical magic. These rites and teachings were probably put into cypher so that they could be sent to other people whom he wanted to be involved in the scheme. The project was never reali sed and the cyphers remained among his documents. When Mackenzie died, Westcott, who was at that time trying to revive the Swedenborgian Rite, contacted Ma ckenzie's widow Alexandra to recover the relevant papers. Mt er some negotiation, Mrs. Mackenzie sent him all the documents she had fo und. Most of them were Swedenborgian, but amonst the other material seems to have been the Cypher Manuscripts. For this to be true it means that Westcott was lying when he said that he obtained the cyphers from the Rev. A.F.A. Woodford. It also means that Westcott was being untruthful to himself when he put in his diary that Woodford had planned to show him the Cypher Manuscript. Westcott claimed Woodford had boasted about showing them to Mackenzie and he was awestruck by them. Lying in one's own diary is a good method of keeping your story straight over a long time.

Many a historian would look at a diary and wonder \"why would he put that in his diary ifhe didn't believe it was true,\" fo rgetting that is exactly what the writer of the diary wants you to think. By the time that Westcott started to tell his official history, Woodford was safely dead and a plausible candidate fo r receiving such a document. IfWestcott said he got the cypher from its true author, then many of his masonic friends would have been very surprised. Mackenzie did not like Westcott and it was literally over his dead body that Westcott would ever be admitted into the Society of Eight. It would be too much to suggest that Mackenzie would have ever given Westcott anything. Even after his death, Mackenzie's widow only handed over that mysterious collection of papers at the request of a mutual friend. But Gilbert points out that when Westcott translated the Cypher Manuscript, some of the pages he used were connected to the Swedenborgian rite, suggesting that these were at least to hand when he did it. Aft er translating them, Westcott sent the cyphers to Mathers fo r his opinion on th em. Westcott later said that Mathers was excited and begged to flesh out the rituals. Woodman was brought in as a Third Chief, but here we approach another flaw in Westcott's official version of the story. Howe claimed that the Cypher Manuscript does not mention a structure of three chiefs. He makes much hay out of Westcott claiming that the insistence came from Sprengel. But according to Westcott's own diary, he had not heard from Sprengel until November 1887. But Howe was wrong to say that the Cypher Manuscript says nothing about needing three chiefs. Under the section \"Temple Setup\" it says that \"THR.§E CHIEFS EACH (>) (Heh)= (6) (Vav) SHO'VLD HOLD .A TEMPLE and one of whom must be present at all Ceremonies.\" Whatever the extent, it is clear that the creation of the Golden Dawn involved some deception. Many have laid the blame for this at the fe et of Westcott, ignoring the fact that Mathers and \\Voodman might also have been involved. Westcott later said that Mathers was the only one who knew the real history ofhow he got the manuscripts, but maintained his story about getting them from \\Voodford until he died. Even if Mathers had been told, or had"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":".,6 ) KJNG 01/ER..fhe WA TER.._ worked out that the Sprengel letters had been fo rged, he never denied the authority of the Cypher Manuscript. When he fo rmed the .Alpha et Omega he constructed its rituals so that they remained, more or less, within the framework of the Cypher Manuscript. Enough is now known of the true origins of the Cypher Manuscript that the fe w remaining gaps in our knowledge do not matter. Every week it seems a new theory is placed on the Internet that favours either Westcott or Mathers. The latest is the unlikely idea that Mathers wrote the rituals and then the pair of them retro­engineered them into the Cypher documents: It is enough to say at this point that the story was accepted in the beginning and no one thought twice about it until more than a decade had passed. So fa r you will notice that the hero of the story has stood in the background as a bit player. Now it is time to introduce Samuel Mathers properly. Samuel Ltddell Mathers by Pa ola Fa rrell • This idea appears to have originated with Langford-Garstin, who allegedly quoted from surviving documents by Mathers and Brodie-Innes.

The family lived at n De Beauvoir Place in West Hackney. When the writer Ithell Colquhoun tracked down the address she fo und that it was now 108 De Beauvoir Road. The well-insured \\Villiam died a short time after Samuel was born, leaving Mary and Samuel with a pension and they moved to Bournemouth in 1866. It is not clear where he went to school, but it seems likely that Mina Mathers was right when she later claimed that he had attended the private Bedford Grammar School, though some doubt remains. Samuel at tempted to supplement his mother's pension as a private tutor of the classics and by writing. Mary died, aged 70, in 188). One does not need to be too much of a psychoanalyst to point out that living at home with a dependent mother until the age of 31 can't be particularly good fo r a growing man. Especially when it appears that Mathers had no interest in other women until his mother died. Modern psychological profiling would suggest that, without a coherent father figure, the young Samuel was at a loss. Mathers seems to have channelled any energy he had into physical pursuits including boxing and joining the Militia, which was the forerunner of the Territorial Army. He held the rank of Private in the First Hampshire Infantry Volunteers. His first book was a translation of a French Military manuaL Practical lrutruction fo r Infantry Ca mpaigning Exercise (1884). This 'fixation' or interest in the military is often a safety valve fo r those who want to express masculinity or need to learn about it. Mter living with his mother fo r a long time, Mathers must have been suppressing quite a lot of natural desires and male traits. As a young man trying to express his masculinity, he naturally fell ' In his biography of Mathers, Westcott refers to his mother by her maiden name of \"Miss Collins\" (complete with quotation marks), it is not clear what he was trying to imply here. Mary married William on n November 1848, at Old Church, Saint Pancras, in London, so Mathers was certainly born in wedlock. She kept her married name after William's death and that name is recorded on her death certificate. Westcott could have been implying that she was a Miss Havisham sort of character, but all we can be sure of is that a reference, or insult, that was obvious at the time, has long since been fo rgotten."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":",.,8 ) l(!NG Of/ER.Jhe W.A TEI( into an area that is testosterone-filled and full of stereotyped fantasy. \\Vithout a strong male role model around he was taking his information from military stereotypes. Through his reading he saw stereotypical male figures in the fo rms of military heroes and sought to emulate them. You would think this could be the basis ofMathers' legendary urge fo r control. Two dimensional fantasy figures always seem to have control of their environment and other people. Control was something that Mathers lacked, particularly while his mother was alive. But such a life does not create a control freak. Controlling types do not stay with their mothers that long and tend to have many failed relationships where everything is about power. What is more likely is that Mathers was a protective type and he saw his military heroes protecting the family unit, a role in which he stepped up to in the case ofhis mother. \\Vhen his 'confinement', in terms of masculine expression, was ended with his mother's death he should have been able to find better expression through having a girlfriend. With his mother safely buried it seems that he did start looking fo r a partner, with fairly dismal results. His next book was The Fa ll of Granada (188;), a collection of epic poems that he dedicated to Miss Alice Adye, who was some ten years older than him. It seems unlikely that his heroic poetry wooed her much, if that was what it was intended to do. At the time of the next census she remained unmarried, whereas Mathers was married to his first girlfriend Mina Bergson. His subsequent book, The l(gbbalah 'Unveiled (1887), gave him some standing in the intellectual world. It included three texts from the cabbalistic sacred book Th e z:thar, and was the first translation into English that could be used by would-be magicians. The young Samuel seems to have made a living by tutoring children in classics, according to the various censuses of the time. In other sources he describes himself as a clerk. In October 1877 Samuel became a Freemason in the local Lodge of Hengist and was sponsored by local estate agent E.W. Reb beck. \\Vhen he gained his certificate he signed his name as the Comte de Glenstrae, showing fo r the first time the development of his unlikely Jacobite fantasy. According to Mina, Mathers believed that his ancestor, Ian MacGregor of Glenstrae, a relative of Rob Roy, was a Jacobite"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"NJCJ(F.Al(R.§LL )9 who fo ught in the unsuccessful 1745' rebellion. He then went to France and later fo ught under another Jacobite, Thomas Arthur, Comte de Lally and Baron de Tollendal, against the British at the \"Battle\"\" ofPondicherry in India. Mathers' mostly loyal friend John Brodie-Innes wrote after Mathers' death that his real name was in doubt. In an article entitled \"Was he MacGregor - was he Mathers?\" Brodie-Innes said: \"Ye t even the slightut knowledge of Highland history would solve thi.J.

Th is name was anglici'{!d into Mathers, which was bome by his ancestors. But the true name was, of course, MacGregor. His grandfother had fought with great gallantry at the siege of Pondicherry, with Lally Tollendal, and received from Louis XI Y the title of Count MacGregor de Glenstrae, aft erwards confirmed by Jamu II, a French title which naturally was not used in England. \" Brodie-Innes was lying and he knew it. As Howe states, not even an extremely dedicated genealogist could prove Mathers' link to the claim of a MacGregor family name. But you would not have to, fo r Ian MacGregor did not exist. Having gone through the MacGregor family records there does not appear to have been an Ian or Iain MacGregor anywhere during that period. There were fo ur Clan Gregor fa milies in the 17th century, the fa milies of Glenstrae, Glencarnaig, Roro and Glengyle. But the Glenstrae line of the Clan Gregor chiefs ended with the death of Archibald of Kilman an in 1704. Ian MacGregor could not have been a Glenstrae. Brodie-Innes' comment about Alastair was way off the mark. The only issue of Alastair was \"ane only dochter,\" who married a certain John Stewartt and the next • Thomas Arthur fo ught fo r the French during the first Siege ofPondicherry.

There was a MacGregor who died at one of the Sieges of Pondicherry, but Donald MacGregor fo ught fo r the British and not against Thomas Arthur. If Ian MacGregor was Mather's grandfather and fo ught during the Forty-five rebellion he would have been at least 40 by the time of the Siege ofPondicherry. This would have made \\Villiam at least 90 years old when his son Samuel was born. Given that Mina implied that Ian MacGregor was such an important figure in history, it is odd that history has failed to mention him. One of the oddest things about this story is that if Mathers wanted to be a MacGregor he could have chosen many illustrious people to be his ancestor. Among the most famous was Rob Roy. Yet he was very specific. Mathers would have not been older than 22 when he invented Ian MacGregor and made Louis XV give his fictitious character the title ofComte of Glenstrae. The question is why would he do it and where did he get the name? There are two ideas we can think of to suggest this particular fantas y. The first one is that Samuel Mathers was desperate fo r a father figure and made one up based on his reading of Rob Roy and his family name. His fantasy developed into a reality over time and became so ingrained in his consciousness that he convinced everyone that it was true. While Brodie-Innes may have been humouring his teacher's fantasy, it is unlikely he believed it. Besides, who would ever know? Mina Mathers, on the other hand, would believe everything Samuel told her. There is another more palatable scenario. Late Victorian England was a hotbed fo r religious ideas which had come from India and China. One of these was the idea of re-incarnation. This flowered with the development of the Theosophical Society much later, but such ideas would have been common amongst the esoteric circles in which the young Mathers moved. It is possible that during a meditative state Mathers had what others would have called a \"past life memory\" of an ancestor which was vivid enough this is not the case, as her issue are all Stewarts of Fincastle."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"NICJ(F.Al(R.§LL fo r him to believe without question. The fact that it fitted his own romantic notions would have been enough fo r him to believe its truth without question. Besides, finding records of such a person would have been harder in the 1S7os than it is now. Either way it was this inability to tell fa ntasy from reality which was going to prove to be Mathers' undoing. \\Vhile the Masonic lodges were not really fo r him, member­ship did lead him to meet Fredrick Holland. Holland introduced Mathers to Kabbalah and to some of his associates, including Westcott and Mackenzie. Holland and Westcott were ofMathers' generation. Unlike Westcott, Mackenzie was particularly taken with Mathers. Mathers joined the SJ<l.A where he took fo r his motto that of the Clan McGregor: S'Rioghail Mo Dhream which means \"Royal is my race.\" Mathers' association with such promi­nent \"fringe Masons\" as Westcott, Woodman, Mackenzie and Holland led to his rapid advance in many of these obscure degrees. Mathers moved to London and lived in fa irly poor rooms in Great Percy Street in Kings Cross. Much of his time was taken up in the British Museum Library, where he intensively studied books on esoteric subjects . The mystic Arthur Edward Waite described his first meeting with Mathers in the British Museum Reading Room: I remember comparing him in my mind to a combination of Don �jxote and Hudibras, but with a vanity all his own.

Waite certainly confirms this eccentricity, but points out the romantic obsession with the military. We know he loved boxing and fe ncing, and playing with toy soldiers which today is called wargaming. He was photographed as an officer of an artillery regiment, when he only managed one of the lowest uncommissioned ranks in the Territorials. But this obsession seemed to get worse with time. Annie Horniman once told the tale of how Mathers did not like his astrological chart because it had him as a fairly dull Capricorn·. Wanting to be more martial he did a ritual to change it so that he was Aries, which was ruled by Mars. He also adjusted his wife's chart, presumably with a different ritual, so that she didn't conflict with the reformed chart ofher husband. Not that she would have. Crowley would later complain in his diary that Mathers' obsession with Mars caused his biggest trouble. Before moving on we should mention the oldest of the three chiefs. Dr. William Robert Woodman was born in 1828. Little is known of his precise role in the establishment of the Order, although as Supreme Magus of the SR.[.A his involvement was natural. Both Mathers and Westcott respected his kabbalistic knowledge. He was nominally Imperator of the Golden Dawn, which would have theoretically given him precedence in the running of the Order, ifhe were so minded. Woodman was an early member of the SR.[.A, and when R.W. Little died he became its second Supreme Magus. His position at the head of the SR.[.A would have assisted in the recruitment of members to the new order, but he died before the Golden Dawn's Second Order became active. Although he almost certainly influenced both Mathers and Westcott, it is difficult to assess how many of his ideas and practical suggestions were adopted by the Golden Dawn. His library passed to the SR.[.A, not to the G D. His impact on the general history of the Order was that by dying when he did, he enabled the Order to develop into a system, which in Kabbalah would be termed the \"two contending heads\". Kabbalists believe that all things are the One Thing, so therefore the highest evil must come about when two things take the place 'It is a pitJ he didn't like traditional astrology, which would have made Mars the exalte ruler of his Sun, his midheaven and his ascendant.

The \"two contending heads\" was a symbol of extreme potential evil. We are sure that Woodman did not fo resee this. \\Vhen it came to the creation of the Golden Dawn rituals it is fa irly clear that Westcott and Mathers were a double act act, with \\Vestcott seeing himself as the senior partner. Indeed, Mathers insisted that \\Vestcott pay him to flesh out the rituals fr om the Cypher Manuscript. \\Vestcott would later add that Mathers begged him fo r the chance to be involved in the project, although whether this was out of interest, or just touting fo r business, \\Vestcott did not say. Mathers was poor and always looking fo r work. Mathers managed to do a good job with the first five rituals and Westcott was impressed. However, as an employee, Mathers would not have as much say on the rituals as many would believe, and with the Cypher Manuscript as a guide it would not have been difficult. For the @=[Q] opening, fo r example, Mathers used the opening of the Lodge in Freemasonry to fill in some of the gaps. Perhaps the trickiest part was the actual layout of the temple, which needed careful visualisation to make sure that everyone was standing in the correct positions. At other points the speeches required a bit of fleshing out. An example is where the Cypher Manuscript says: HS: (a ddre.f.fes Neophtye and extort.r to memory to honour God a.r our Light), never condemn other/ religion. Be Secret. Study Equilibrium. Each unbalance is evil. Persevere. Mathers expanded this to: Hiereu.r: .As you have now passed through the ceremony of your admission, allow me to congratulate you on being admitted a member of this ancient and honourable Order, whose projemd object and end is the practical study oj'Occult Science. Let me therefore advise you to remember this day a.r a marked one in your existence and to adopt and cultivate a mental condition worthy of this Order.

Lastly, do not be daunted by the diffi culties of Occult Study and remember that every obstacle can at length be conquered by perseverance. It looks difficult, and perhaps to someone not used to writing rituals, it might be. However, someone wanting to construct the rituals using modern language from the Cypher Manuscript could easily come up with something. Waite had a crack at it and, as an exercise, I had a go at it too. Of course you will end in a slightly different place, but the purpose is to think what the Cypher Man­uscript might have intended. For example, here is my attempt: Hiereus: Welcome to thir .Ancimt Order and the beginning of your magical path. Ta u must forever seek that Light which ir at the heart of all religions.

Th is is a long and hard path to follow, but if you persevere you will find that Light which you are lookingfor. 4'5 What is perhaps more interesting is the structure of teaching that Mathers suggested and some of the information that leaked through. Firstly there was the interest in the Tarot. The attributions of the Tarot cards to the Hebrew letters and planets was in the Cypher Manuscript. Mathers made a claim that he introduced the use ofTarot into the Golden Dawn, which meant he had fo rgotten they were in Cypher Manuscript. He could be fo rgiven fo r this because his knowledge ofTarot and the Cypher Manuscript came fr om a common source, namely Kenneth Mackenzie. Mackenzie was one of the fe w people in England who saw an esoteric purpose fo r Tarot. He had written a book on the subject but it was never published and has since been lost. He did send his notes to Mathers and mentioned this in a letter to \\Vestcott. \\Vestcott was also interested in Tarot and had written a book called Th e Isiac Ta blet of Ca rdinal Bembo, which some have somewhat optimistically chosen to see as the basis fo r the Golden Dawn Tarot system. It is likely that the Golden Dawn approach to Tarot was a mixture of \\Vestcott, Mathers, Eliphas Levi, and Mackenzie. Mackenzie was not famous fo r an interest in Enochian, which is in the Cypher Manuscript. Enochian was a fo rm of angel magic which was received by Dr. John Dee in the ��h Century. Knowl­edge of it was made public in I6)9 when Meric Casubon published a large chunk of Dee's diaries under the title .A True and Fa ithful Rt,lation of what occurred between Dr John Dee and some Sp irits. The use of Enochian in the Cypher Manuscript follows a pattern which was developed by a manuscript in the British Library with the number Sloane 307. This manuscript was much later than Dee and appears to have come from someone who had cobbled .A Tr ue and Fa ithfu l Rt,lation into a magical system. Because .A True and faithfu l Rt,lation only had part of John Dee's magical system, the author of Sloane 307 had to fill in some gaps. The person used certain names of God which were taken from \"elemental tablets\" fo r magical effect. Dee did not use this elemental approach to the Tablets. Mathers copied this manuscript and later it was used in full"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"l(!NG Of/ER,Jhe WA TEI( within his Second Order. It is tempting to speculate given the late date of the Cypher Manuscript and the fact that Mackenzie appears to have come to Enochian late, that Mathers may have been responsible fo r introducing him to Sloane 307. Fascinated, Mackenzie worked them into the outline he was drawing up. Since Mathers did not know who the author of the Cypher Manuscript was, he just assumed that all the knowledge shown fitted the model he had picked up from Mackenzie. So far though we have not seen much in the way of genius from anyone. Westcott has shown himself to be little more than a brilliant organiser, and Mathers has yet to shine."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Tie liGHT SHINETH in DARl(!VESS CHAPTEI(TWO In March 1888 the Golden Dawn opened its doors. Westcott and Mathers marketed it to bolster membership. Westcott made a reference to it at an October meeting of the Metropolitan Col­lege of the SRJ.A, at which he claimed that before his death Rev. A.F.A. Woodford was a member of a society that now called itself the Golden Dawn. In a December 1888 edition of Notes and %eries he planted a question about a Kabbalistic Society fo rmed by a Dr. Jo­hann Falk, which apparently trained the French Magus Eliphas Levi. Westcott then replied to his own letter saying that group still existed under the name of the Golden Dawn.\" To make the path clearer fo r • This Kabbalistic School is loosely identified with the School established by Francis Barrett, author of Th e Magu.r, around x8oo. The identification of a London based Kabbalah expert with the name of Falk is problematic. Dr. Samuel Jacob Falk existed. He was known as the \"Baal Shem\" of London. If Falk's school was the Golden Dawn it must have changed considerably over the years. Falk, who influenced Blake and Swedenborg in the later x8'h Century, believed in the idea of \"Holy Sinning,\" which meant taking the Torah and seeing the prohibitions as commandments. Practically, this meant sexual acts and incest. The group may have existed and may have even had an input in Francis Barrett's esoteric education, but it certainly did not have anything to do with the Golden Dawn. Mackenzie's encyclopedia mentioned another candidate was Johann Falk, who was at one time the Lecturer on the Kabbalah in London. Neither could have had anything to do with Levi as both were dead.

But the spin did not end there. A letter appeared in the theo­sophical magazine Luciftr about a band ofblack magicians work­ing in the North of England who called themselves \"Ros Crux Fratres.\" Mathers wrote a letter saying that they had nothing to do with real Rosicrucians. There followed a letter which said: The Hennetic Student.r of the R.yicrucian G.

The R..8.r Crux Fratre.r did exist, but Mathers' letter is clearly what is today called \"guerilla marketing.\" It is not clear how successful the campaign was, but by the end of 1888, the Order had three Temples. The first (Isis-Urania) was in London and had thirty-two members including nine women, while Osiris, at Weston super Mare, had eight men, and Horus at Bradford had eleven men. Between 1888 and 1896 Isis Urania initiated 189 people. By 1893, twenty-three people had resigned, twenty-three had ceased to attend, and three had been thrown out. Seven people had died if Sprengel, who may not have existed, is included. The fifth person, and the first woman to join the Order, was Mina Bergson. Mina was born at 8:4) AM on 28 February I86f in Geneva and had been sent to study at the Slade School of Fine Art, where in 1882 she met Annie Horniman, who was to become a long-term friend and supporter. They were so close that some have suggested that there was a lesbian relationship between the pair, in particular noting how • Mystic Mountain of Albiegnus, which is the mountain of initiation."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"NJCJ(F.AI(R.§LL 49 badly Horniman responded to Samuel's arrival on the scene, which could suggest jealousy. It is true that Horniman did not have any relationships, nor did she marry, but it would take two people to tango and, as we will see later, Mina Bergson had a problem with sex in any fo rm. Mina met Mathers in 1887 at the British Museum. He had just met the occultist Anna Kingsford and admired her magical relationship with Edward Maitland. Samuel's idea was to find someone who could share his magical life in a similar way. His strategy appears to have been to lurk around the British Museum and chat up a girl looking at some Egyptian statues in the hope she might be interested in occultism. \\Ve have no idea how often he tried this, or what his opening line was, before he \"got lucky\" and met Mina. Min a was sketching an Egyptian statue at the time and did not call the police when he made his advances. She took him to meet her fr iend Annie, who was less than im­pressed. Annie, who had an interest in astrology, must have asked Mathers about his Sun sign. Mathers realised that his Capricorn Sun was the last thing an over-protective fr iend would want to hear and pretended to be an Aquarius. Annie believed him fo r a while because he \"looked like an Aquarius.\" Mina would later tell Annie that Mathers was an interesting man whom she did not want to marry. Horniman agreed. She did not like Mathers and it is not too difficult to see why. Throughout her life Horniman never suffered fo ols gladly, and Mathers with his red tie and Jacobite pretensions was just the sort of person who would annoy her. He also had no prospects whatsoever and ears like an Indian elephant. Yet he totally overwhelmed Mina. To understand why, you have to dig into Mina's background. Mina was the fo urth child in a fa mily of seven children. Her Jewish family was primarily fo cused on what they considered to be the musical genius of their father Michel. Michel Bergson, who was a student of Chopin, had some early success but fo und it difficult to support his growing family. He was appointed the director of piano at the Conservatoire de Musique, but was too temperamental to last long in an environment of anti-Semitism. The family moved to London in 1873 where Michel taught piano. Mina's oldest brother Henri became a fa mous philosopher and winner of the Nobel Prize. Her brother Joseph became a doctor and another brother Phillip became a writer.

Mina stayed at home until the age of 29, when she moved out into a small studio flat and was not \"free\" long before meeting Mathers. \\Ve have a description ofMichel from Henri, which goes a long way to describing why Mina fe ll fo r Mathers. According to Henri, his father was \"proud, extravagant, over emotional, with an enthusiastic imagination\" and \"fond of telling anecdotes.\" Michel was generally good natured, but could be malicious and spiteful. Mary Greer· believes that this, along with his patchy employment record, is an indication of manic-depression. Mina's mother, who would have acted as a role model fo r dealing with this type of man, was described by Henri as \"devoted, saintly and serene.\" It is clear that Mina grew up in a family where the father was likeable, but unstable, but to whom everything had to be sacrificed. Her mother's response ofbeing saintlike and refined in the wake of this was seen as her way through. Mathers' personality was similar enough fo r history to have a go at repeating itself. Mathers' instability attracted her and the role model ofher mother kept her there. Later historians attempt to portray Mina as a \"modern woman.\" These seem to be based on one of the few photographs we have of her taken in I89), with her hair loose and wearing chunky beads. Certainly some have chosen to see Mina as a modern assertive woman who was a huge influence on the development of the Golden Dawn. However, it is difficult to see how a \"modern woman\" could have put up with Mathers. It was confusing fo r people at the time too. Westcott believed that Mathers must be using some fo rm ofblack magic to control Mina as she appeared totally obsessed with Samuel in a way that he did not believe was naturalt. That total obsession could be explained by the psychological quirk ofher upbringing. • Mary Greer, 1Yomm of the Golden Dawn, p. 41. t Mary Greer, 1Vomm of the Go/dm Dawn, p. 75·"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"NICJ(F.AI(R.§LL )I Mina Mathers \\Vhat was a little more surprising was Mina's extremely repressed at­titude to sexuality, which she regarded as \"dirty\" and \"beastly.\" In one letter to Horniman she said that she had such a shock when she first discovered about sex and was \"deeply upset\" by the concept.

Mathers, she claimed, \"agreed with her entirely\" and they had both \"kept perfectly clean.,. It is hard to see how Mathers, with his love ofMars, was able to deal with this. Fortunately fo r Mina, Mathers had as much experience with women and sex as Mina did. His role models were non-existent. Even his reading would never have touched on what was supposed to happen.

She was the first member of the Order to take the @=[Q] ritual, which places her in a position of importance within the Order. It is also an indication of how sure Samuel was about the long term future of his relationship, which was still fa irly new. On 16 June 1890 they eloped to get married in a Christian church. Given the fact that Mina was from an orthodox Jewish family, this can only have driven a wedge between her and them. He then gave her a different name. In line with his Jacobite pretensions he called her \"Moina\" to give her name a more highland sound, and perhaps make her appear less Jewish. She adopted the name, like many ofthe things she accepted from him, without question and even put it on her marriage certificate. Horniman didn't approve, but to keep Mina happy and to make sure the couple did not starve she found Mathers a job as an assistant at her father's museum. Unfortunately, Mathers was only able to keep the post fo r a year. Samuel and Mina had an emotionally idealised relationship which was essentially infantile. This stunted emotional intelligence would explain their actions at a later date. Tie EA�TGOLDEN DAWN The early Golden Dawn involved the @=[Q] ritual and then four 'advancements' in which the candidate was magically opened to the fo ur elements: earth, air, water, and fire. Mter completion of the rite the candidate was given a list of things that had to be memorised before he or she could advance. In fact, this material given in fo ur Knowledge Papers did not change much throughout the Order's history, although the requirements for the testing of this knowledge slipped from time to time. The rituals were worked using Masonic technique. The Temple would go through a ritual opening and if there was a candidate fo r initiation that ceremony would take place. If there wasn't, general business would be di scussed, much as in a Masonic meeting. The Temple would then be closed. There was little technique that anyone would consider \"magical;\" the power of the ritual would appear to be in the doing rather than any astral or energy fireworks. Any spiritual"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"N!Cl(F.AR,l<§LL or other revelation would be the result of studying the rituals after the event. Most of the meetings were held in member's houses, with occasional rites, where there would be a larger number of members, held in the Mark Masons Hall in London. The place was home to a number of the Masonic \"Additional Degrees\" and people turning up with various fo rms of regalia would not have caused much of a stir. It should be noted that the members of the GD, who included decidedly non-Masonic women, entered by a side door. None of the regalia of any of the Orders working at Mark Masons Hall would have been openly shown outside the building, and the G D would almost certainly not have been permitted to use official lodge rooms given that they included women in their number. It is worthwhile pointing out that the only ritual that Golden Dawn students were given was the Lesser Ritual of the Penta/![am. The purpose of this ritual was to protect the candidate and balance their energies during the exposure to the elemental fo rces. In comparison to what was to come later, the Golden Dawn was magically fairly dull, but it had attracted some significant members, including a circle of fr iends involved with the poet William Butler Yeats, among them Florence Farr,John Todhunter and Maud Gonne. Annie Horniman, the Rev. William Alexander Ayton and Arthur Edward Waite all joined during this period.· Another of the more important members to join was Dr. Ed­ward W. Berridge. Berridge was born in Windsor, Berkshire, in 184>. He attended London University and studied Medicine at St. Bartho­lomew's hospital, qualifying as a doctor and surgeon in 1867. He was an expert in homeopathy and in 1869 published the tome Complete J?.rpertory to the Homoeopathic Materia Medica: Diseases of the Ey es, (2e 1873) which was considered a significant work on the subject. He was also a Doctor of Medicine of the Homeopathic College in Pennsylvania, and produced a large number ofhomoeopathic tracts. From 1882 until his death in 1920 he practised medicine in Baywater in London. His first practice was at 48 Sussex Gardens and he later moved to 193 Gloucester Terrace. • Gonne left because she \"discovered\" that the Order was full of Freemasons, something her Irish Republican sentiment couldn't condone. It took her three years to notice this, so she can't have been the most observant of people. Apparently she only twigged when one of the meetings was held at Mark Masons Hall and she saw how the GD used Masonic trappings. Waite left in r893 fo r reasons that he never made clear, but he returned in 1896."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"KJNG OVER.Jhe W.A TEI( He applied to join the Golden Dawn in April 1888, but, accord­ing to one story, was declined entry. Westcott was operating on the assumption that anyone who was too stupid not to apply again wasn't worth being a member of the Order. Berridge told Waite as much when his application fo r membership was rejected. Gilbert states that Berridge changed his mind about membership in 1888, but reapplied in 1889 and was accepted in May of that year. He took the magical motto JV..rurgam, which means, \"I shall rise again.\" In addition to his Golden Dawn pursuits, Berridge was a fo llower of the spiritualist Thomas Lake-Harris (1823-1906). This is important because these beliefs would later bring him into conflict with other Golden Dawn members. Harris was a mystic who claimed to receive divine inspirations, which he interpreted in the fo rm of poetry. He also espoused an almost Tantric philosophy which involved a monogamous marriage where the wife would have as many orgasms as she wished while the male must abstain. According to Aleister Crowley, Thomas Lake-Harris recommended his pupils to invoke elemental spirits or \"astral counterparts\" fo r the purpose of carnal copulation. However, reading through Lake-Harris' somewhat tortuous material it is hard to find anything that sensational. Another of Berridge's \"sins,\" which may have temporarily blocked him from entry into the Order, was his membership of the Henneti'c Brotherhood of Luxor (HBL). The HBL had enough in common with the Golden Dawn fo r some historical researchers to believe that they were linked. Both offered practical occultism, but the HBL did this through a correspondence course which included the teachings of the eccentric English Rosicrucian Hargrave-Jennings and Paschal Beverly Randolph. Randolph was a controversial character at the best of times, believing in the importance of sex magic and lecturing European audiences on Spiritualism and Abolition. Randolph met Jennings in the late 18fos, but there is no evidence that Jennings had any connection with any Rosicrucian Order in the real world. In the 187os Randolph was involved with Madame Blavatsky and her own alleged Brotherhood of Luxor owed much to Randolph's ideas and to the fantasies of Kenneth Mackenzie. Whether or not her concept of the \"Masters\" came from Randolph is unclear, but her Brotherhood was soon clearly set against the self-styled Henneti'c Brotherhood ojLuxorthat was fo isted on to the public arena in 1884 by its creator, Max Theon, and his associate, Peter Davidson."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"NICJ(F.AR..., R[,LL )) Theon's HBL had a direct influence on the Ordo Te mpli Orientir (OTO) and on the Indian mystic Sri Aurobindo and his partner the French Mirra Alfassa. It is unlikely that the HBL was a source of the idea of\"Masters\" or \"Secret Chiefs\" fo r either Blavatsky or \\Vestcott, but it is a concept that became crucial to the Western Magical Tradi­tion. Randolph made public his teachings in such books as Eulir! The Hirtory of Love: It.r WondroU.J Magic, Chemirtry Law1, MadeJ, and Rgtional,· Being the Th ird Rt,velation of Soul and Sex, al.ro Rtply to ccWhy ]J Man Immortalt\" the Solution to the Darwin Problem, an Entirely Ne w Th eory, which was published in 1874: One of the reasons that the HBL had such bad press was that Blavatsky denounced it, and another was its perceived association with sex magic. Westcott knew about the HBL through Robert Fryar, an occult publisher in Bath who promoted the group, and by 1889 he was happy to attack it. What changed his mind about Berridge is not clear. Berridge became an honorary G)=[§] (the seventeenth) in February of 1891. He does not appear to have actually experienced the Vault Ceremony as a candidate, but was likely Obligated in the presence ofMathers and Westcott within the Vault in early 1892. In his Golden Dawn Scrapbook R.A. Gilbert uses Berridge's appli­cation to give a pen portrait of a man who was not renowned fo r his humility. Dear Mathm.

Gilbert says that he is writing in the tone of an equa l rather than of a subordinate. Berridge was helping to run the Golden Dawn at \"' See Th e Influence of !:-!Jpt on the Modem �Vntem Mptery Tradition: Th e Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor by Samuel Scarborough: Joumal of the Wn tem My stery Tra dition No. I, .Autumnal Equinox 2001."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"I<JNG Of/El(fhe W.A TEI( that point and it is possible to imagine him asking Mathers \"well what should I write then?\" and Mathers telling him \"Oh just put this ... \" But given the personalities of the two, it is more likely that the letter reveals the \"Vault\"-ing ego of the man. Berridge was given a great deal ofleeway by Mathers in more than just matters of esoteric order etiquette. The Golden Dawn required that its teaching should be copied carefully and then submitted to a senior person (usually the sub-Praemonstrator) fo r checking. For most this meant a lot of effort tirelessly copying diagrams, but Berridge's work seems to have been done in a rush and is a bit of a mess. His work was never sent back to be corrected, and his first important role within the Golden Dawn was in 1892 as the sub-Praemonstrator - the very person who was supposed to make sure it was all done neatly! It was probably just as well that he was shifted to the role of sub-Imperator later that year, a job he held until March 1896. This was the first time that he was the representative fo r the lV,il%, over the fVater, and it would not be the last. Another player who enters the story at this time is John William Brodie-Innes (1848-1923), who joined the Order in August 1890. Brodie­Innes was born in England on 1o March 1848 at Downe in Kent, where his father was vicar. He obtained a BA degree in Mathematics from Cambridge in 1872, then studied law and was called to the English Bar in 1876. Moving to Edinburgh in 1887, he took up Scottish law, but con­tinued to run his English practice. This required him to travel between London and Edinburgh and meant that he was able to be involved with both the Scottish Lodge of the Theosophical Society and the Isis-Urania Temple of the Golden Dawn: Brodie-Innes was a writer, journalist and playwright. He would latr become more famous fo r his novels, which were based on witchcraft and Scottish folklore. These were: Morag the Seal (19o8), Old a.r the World: .A J?.Emance of the Wester11lslandi (1909), Fo r the Soul of a Witch (1910) and Th e Devils Mistress (1915').

Sadly it was not as good as the rituals based around the Cypher. Although it had several interesting ritual moments, it was not up to the standard of the other elemental rites: On 1o September 1889t Mina Mathers was the first to enter the Portal grade. She had already advanced through the grades of the Outer Order and undertaken the roles of the various officers. The Portal ritual, which was written by Mathers in 1889, was much simpler and shorter than the version that has been published in Regardie's Th e Golden Dawn, which dates from the Stella Matutina. The Mathers version was first published in Mather/ Last Secret in 2011. It was never popular amongst members of the Order. There were several attempts to re-write parts of it, but it was not until the Stella Matutina was created that the rite was properly constructed. Looking at the Mathers ritual it is fairly clear that without the outline of the Cypher Manuscript, Mathers was flagging. Although it attempts to use the same fo rmula as the Outer Order, it lacks the drama and the poetry. Ritually, nothing happens other than the pres­entation of diagrams and passwords. One of the fe w innovations is the presentation of the two versions of the Tarot card Temperance. What is strange about this ritual is that, as we will see later, by 1888 Mathers, in his mediumistic efforts, had already had made some astral contact with the Archangel Raphael who was later to provide him with the G)=lli] material. It would appear that either 'Raphael' did not have a hand in the Portal ritual or he was having an off-day. Mter the Portal ritual was concluded it was possible fo r an initiate to be declared a nominal G)=lliJ. This grade was required • The rite was reviled by members of the Golden Dawn and swiftly replaced after Mathers' exit. Mathers' version of the rite was fo rgotten until it was published in Mather.' Last Secret. Until then it had effectively been expunged from history and most people, including Howe, believed that the much later Stella Matutina version was written by Mathers. t The date of Westcott's Portal Ceremony is r889, but there is no indication that Mathers produced a Portal ritual in that year.

By the time Mathers' Second Order was established there were 20 nominal G)=ffiJs, including Berridge, Florence Farr, Mina Mathers and the Rev. Ayton and his wife. Tie BIG CHANGE In 1891, Annie Horniman became increasingly concerned that Mina Mathers' artistic talent was being wasted. \"MacGregor,\" as Samuel was now calling himself, had so completely eclipsed his wife's personality to the point she could not paint. The couple were broke after Samuel had lost his job in 1891 and were living in Percy Street. Mina asked Horniman fo r a loan and she gave it with the idea that Mina could set up an artist's studio in Paris. The plan was that Mina would develop her talent free from her husband and his occult concerns fo r a while. But Horniman's plan had not counted on the channelling or seances that Mathers and Min a were doing to try and contact the Rosicrucian Secret Chiefs. As we have seen, the Masonic tradition, from which the Golden Dawn sprang, is all about authority. It was not enough that your temple made all the secrets of the universe available to its members, it also had to have the authority to give them. The difficulty with this concept is that the authority required a degree of credulity on the side of the student and the ability to lie with a straight face on the part of the people who started the order. However, without authority from someone, an order was irregular and not really valid. Almost all magical orders from that time had a bogus lineage which could be traced back to either the first Temple in Jerusalem or the Garden of Eden. Almost every famous occultist who ever lived had to be a member of your order at some point in time. A great deal of brainpower and tortured reasoning occurred in an attempt to justifY this and much time was wasted trying to track down long-lost branches of the order. But the Rosicrucian Tradition had a get out clause. Its adepts were supposed to be invisible and the senior members were often unknown. This gave rise to the fantasy of magical supermen (there are never any fe male Secret Chiefs) who would appear, give teaching, and, above all, authority to those starting esoteric orders. The novel zenoni by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, which"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"NICI(F.AI(R.§LL )9 was one of the inspirations fo r Samuel Mathers' imagination, described a system where an ordinary person is taught secrets and is initiated by a mysterious Secret Chief That idea can be traced to Karl von Eckartshausen in the late Eighteenth Century. In his book Th e Cloud upon the Sanctuary he talked about an order of mystics, who remained active after their physical deaths on earth, called the Council of Light. Eckartshausen blended Christian ideas such as the Communion of the Saints with the fantasies of the Rosicrucians and the Illuminati. The difficulty fo r those starting esoteric orders, however qualified they might be, was that Secret Chiefs never showed up like that. There was never a knock on the door from a man with a mysterious Rosicrucian bumper sticker or an enlightening meet­ing in a park with one of the Just Men made Perfect. Or if they did, the story was tied to some other outrageous lie connected to the fo unding of the Order. It is somewhat surprising that the Secret Chiefs have not made an appearance in the story so far, particularly since they are always supposed to be instrumental in the fo unding of the Order. Howe has waded into Westcott fo r forging correspondence between the Secret Chief Sprengel and himself to gain authority fo r the Golden Dawn. There is nothing to suggest that Westcott considered Sprengel a Secret Chief, just a member of a temple which could give him lineage. In fact, her grade was (])=@], which meant that she was not a Secret Chief Secret Chiefs were supposed to be super-human, of a grade which was at least ®=IT!, and yet Sprengel wrote to him in German rather than showing up in London to speak to him in his own language. This is not to say that Westcott and Mathers did not believe in them. But they do not seem to have thought that they were someone you could invite around fo r tea and biscuits. By the time the Golden Dawn was fo rmed, the idea of Secret Chiefs was getting another airing, this time from the Theosophical Society and Helena Petrovna Blavatsky. Blavatsky was a psychic and said she was in communication with these mysterious adepts, whom she claimed were the Great \\Vhite Brotherhood, the Masters of the Hidden Brotherhood or Mahatmas.

These people were real and in an age before the Internet, used to send each other psychic emails. As Theosophy developed, the Great White Brotherhood's members started to become less earthy and more astral. Charles Leadbeater would include angels, gods and extraterrestrials amongst its members and students. The relationship was coloured more by the Eastern systems, which infused the minds of the The­osophists with the language and ideas of Gurus and students. The relationship was translated into one ofMaster and Chela, which is another name fo r Servant. Tellingly, it is derived from the Hindi cela, which is taken from the Sanskrit word meaning \"slave.\" The idea was that a student would make a contact with a Master who was on their wave length. They would train them in return fo r doing their work on earth. The Theosophical idea was that you would meet your Master while in meditation or in a similar disassociated state. Most com­monly, students would either go to an inner plane location, such as a temple or school and meet with their Master. At other times they might be meditating in a park or even have been instructed to go to a sacred site where they would meet their Master, who would be using the energy of that place so that the student might have a vision of them. The system certainly assisted some very go od ma­gicians develop new material in a spectacular fashion. However, the system had flaws. Even the Theosophists admitted that everything depended on the ability of the student not to stand in the way of the message. Since the Master was speaking through the unconscious mind of the student, the messages could be clouded by bad thinking or prejudice. There were cases where the ego of the student would become convinced \"by their contact\" that they were the Messiah and destined to bring about a new Aeon of peace with their \"new\" religion. There were also some darker aspects to the teaching which were never adequately worked out. Although these Masters were all in favour of the development of the soul, many seemed to want total obedience and dependence, acting like parental figures. Underestimating this \"inner approach\" to the Secret Chiefs and the influence of the Theosophical Society on the development of the Golden Dawn is one of the greatest mistakes of modern"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"NICJ(FAI(.R§LL researchers. Once I asked one of the experts on Dion Fortune, Alan Richardson, why Fortune never used Enochian. He replied that it was because her contacts had never suggested it. Most of the Golden Dawn membership was either part of the Theosophical movement or had been influenced by it. While the Golden Dawn was not Eastern in its approach, the Astral teachings ofTheosophy were a huge influence on the later work ofWestcott and Mathers. Without fa ctoring in the language and methods of that tradition it is nearly impossible to understand what Mathers was talking about when he meant \"Secret Chiefs,\" nor can we can see their influence on the Golden Dawn. Mathers and Mina had been using what could only be described as channelling sessions at that time. Mathers taught a technique called the Ring and Disk which is similar to using a pendulum technique over a letter board by which replies are spelt out. This method is very slow and is unlikely to have been the only method that Mathers used fo r his personal sessions, but it was used by temple chiefs to obtain their passwords every equinox. There were rumours that Mina Mathers also used a technique similar to channelling. She might have done, but she always credited her husband with that particular ability. The technique was based on the following idea. The discarnate being, contact, or Secret Chief sends out an energy or a ray, which plays through the channeller's unconscious mind. The energy communicates in the fo rm of symbols that the channeller uses. Obviously, the more intellectual information and symbology, the more accurate the message will be. In the case of the Mathers the amount of intellectual information would be high. However, messages can be blocked by the personality of the scryer. For example, Mina was not going to deliver a message that would offend her husband or suggest sexual license. It is more likely that she would see a symbol that could suggest these things and interpret them in a subtly different way. The message will always be delivered in the sort oflanguage that the channeller associates with high level beings. In the case of the Mathers, this meant lots of grandiose purple prose. But there is one advantage to this method of working. It brings together a lot of knowledge that otherwise sits in the person's unconscious and gets fo rgotten."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"KJNG Of/ER.Jhe W.A TEJ( Making some fo rm of contact with the Inner Plane would have been a priority to Mathers. The Golden Dawn had a theo­retical Second Order, but it only existed as a structure as the Cy­pher Manuscript stopped there. \\Vestcott and Mathers both had their copies of Mackenzie's Masonic Encyclo pedia and knew that the structure of their order should be based on the German Order of the Gold and R.p_sy Crou. This would mean three more grades. The G>=ffil, which was where the student would learn practical magic, was to be the starting point, but it was assumed that there would have to be at least a ®=[3] and(])=!]] grade as well. Mathers and Westcott held these grades, so there had to be a clear path to getting to them. The Golden Dawn had been given Masonic authority by \"Spren­gel\" to establish a Second Order, so that was not a problem. The only difficulty was that they had no rituals or teachings which could be used to make it happen. What they needed was to contact the Third Order of Secret Chiefs to provide them with authority and instruction. As early as 1888, Samuel managed to gain what he considered a sig­nificant contact with the Angel of the Sun, Raphael. In his com­munications with Mathers, Raphael used the name L.e.T: It seems significant that all the Golden Dawn occultists who used the The­osophical ideas regarding Inner Plane beings all contacted solar fo rces. Brodie-Inness and Felkin encountered a being who had the title Shemesh, which is the Hebrew name fo r the Sun. Mathers fo und it important that others in the Golden Dawn also made the same contact. One of his favourite members, T.H. Pattinson, who headed the Horus Temple in Bradford, also encountered a contact whom Mathers was certain was the same L.e.T. Mathers rewrote Pattinson's diary note, embellished it and circulated it to senior members. Shared contacts is a common thing in esoteric groups who use the system. The contact Anubis used to show up with regularity amongst the fo llowers of Dolores Ashcroft-Nowicki's Servants of the Light School. Whether or not this was an attempt to butter up the group leader, or whether Anubis had a role in teaching people of a similar mind, was still a question being asked • Gilbert and Howe think that L.e.T. stood fo r LuxE Te nebru, which means \"Light out of Darkness.\" It is the motto of the Scottish Rite ofMasonry."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"NICJ(F.Al(R.§LL in the 199os, as it was in the 189os. 6.., ) Raphael, or L.e.T., seemed to think it would be a good idea fo r Mathers to go to Paris with his wife.

On 30 July 1891 Mathers wrote to Westcott and told him that he had been in \"much communication\" with Frater L.e.T. and other chiefs since I have been over.\" Even using the language of the time there is only one way to read this statement. If Mathers was talking to a real human he would have said \"he talked with\" or \"had visited.\" You don't transfer teaching and a ritual with \"much communication.\" In other words Mathers was carrying out some fo rm of spiritual com­munication. \\Vestcott was also excited, particularly considering the material that Mathers was showing him was of a different order from what he had seen in England. \\Vestcott did not seem phased that Mathers was talking to Invisible Beings. Seeing the results, he replied to Mathers that it seemed that he had made contact with a higher adept. The language used here is pure Theosophical. There was a class system amongst Inner Plane adepts. At the bottom were those who had just died and were helping the riff­raff deal with their mundane lives before they themselves reincarnated, and then you had the high level super adepts who were concerned with the destiny ofhumanity. Westcott seemed to believe that Mathers had gotten one of the big ones and clearly wanted to see how it played out. Westcott never told the other members of the Golden Dawn that this was where their G)=ffil material had come from. In fact, he was prepared to lie to cover the source. He later told Dr. Felkin that Frater L.e.T. was a real Continental Ad ept who gave Mathers a Ro sicrucian manuscript which he then converted into the G)=ffil. Felkin claimed to have spent a lot of time and money in Paris trying to track down Frater L.e.T. He insisted that L.e.T. was a Dr. Thiessen, who was apparently dead by 1909 and well known in Martinism in Paris. Other researchers have established he was so well known that he has not left a trace in the historic records and is unlik ely to have existed. Felkin spun a story that Thiessen had been writing to Mathers, often through an intermediary. Felkin claimed that Thiessen acted in a similar manner to Sprengel in providing the teachings and rituals to Mathers."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"NICI(F.Al(}\\?LL Many have seen this as an attempt by Felkin to look fo r physical masters that were never there, and proof of how gullible he may have been. But one thing missed from the Thiessen story is that it was probably part of a power play after the rebellion. Felkin claimed to have a letter written around 19oo using the Golden Dawn Cypher, in which Thiessen said that he was withdrawing support from Mathers. This date coincided with Mathers' expulsion from the Golden Dawn and would mean that Samuel was no longer blessed by the Secret Chiefs. In other words, Felkin was being extremely clever and creating Secret Chiefs who were not there. He was following Westcott's technique and creating a lie. The only thing that went wrong with Felkin's lie, which revealed his power play, was that Westcott knew that Frater L.e.T. was an angel. Mathers' mediumship took in all the Outer Order material and rolled it together with other more advanced material to make a truly eclectic system where the sub-systems fitted snuggly into a bigger plan. Sometimes, as in the case of Enochian, one system had to be developed a little to allow it to slot together. This is where there was genius, which is still not understood by many modern Golden Dawn groups. The system was finely layered like a stack of cards, with each sub-system leaning on the next. It would be safe to develop each part of the system, but if you took something away or moved it about the whole lot would collapse. Thus Raphael had created a system that could develop over time if the structure was adhered to. Sadly there is no record of what Mathers received first, but the G:J=ffil ritual must have been early on in the process. The G:J=ffil ritual was praised by A.E. Waite fo r its synthesis of Rosicrucian thought, but it was also a summation of the Outer Order. In the ritual a candidate is brought into the grade armed with all his or her test papers and honours. They are rebuffed and told that to become a magician you have to be sacrificed to your Higher Sel£ This is done by strapping the candidate to a full sized crucifix while making him say an oath. Each part of the oath is connected to a station on the Tree of Life. The effect on the candidate is harrowing and some have been known to faint. But the most significant part of the G:J=ffil ritual is a depiction of the Vault ofChristian Rosencreutz. This was a small room made up of seven sides and using an elaborate colour scheme. According"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"66 l(!NG OVER,Jhe W.A TEI( to the Book of the Tomb, which was written by Mathers, each wall had an identical base colour with a symbol in a flashing (or complementary) colour, but was individually tinted with planetary colour so that each wall looked completely different. This sounds easy, but getting the exact ratios only became simple with the introduction of computers and Photoshop. The best method was to provide a 20 per cent colour tint over the base wall. This meant that only a couple of the squares on each wall would flash, thanks to them being complementary. The first Vault was temporary and made of canvas, and the colouring appeared to be a hit and miss affair. We have a copy of the moon wall of the Isis-Urania Vault and some of the tinting colours appear to have ranged in mix from 20 per cent to nearly ;o percent. When the Amon-Ra temple tried to make its Vault it got rid of the plan completely and tried to mix the colours so that each square flashed·. This was managed by using coloured paper. The creation of the Amon-Ra Vault is surprising in that it had the official blessing from Mathers and Westcott, but was completely opposed to the ideas written in the Book of the Tomb. Westcott later added a footnote to the Book of the Tomb that allowed people to make Vaults of flashing colours. Later Felkin would even tinker with the colouring ofhis own New Zealand Vault, which to many eyes is too dark. Inconsistency in practice aside, the Book of the Tomb, which is included in this book fo r the first time in print, is an incredible document, and the result can be a magical machine which can pro­vide a lifetime's worth of meditation. But it is important to realise that because \\Vestcott and Mathers' Amon-Ra shortcuts chal­lenged L.e.T.'s teaching on the Vault, there is little indication that they knew what they actually had. You cannot see the magic in the ratios and then allow a complete Vault of flashing colours. Mathers got the Z documents from Raphael, which crucially placed astral layers over an otherwise Masonic ritual.

However, the Golden Dawn's colour system is by far the most complete, comprising hundreds of colours all related to different states of consciousness. The planetary colours of Agrippa were adopted into one of the fo ur colour systems used. In addition, the idea of placing a complementary colour upon another to create a ' flashing' effect was developed by the Golden Dawn. Some believe that this idea was :Mina Mathers' contribution, because she was an artist, but it appears to have been Mathers who contributed this aspect of colour magic to the system. BRJNGING it all TOGETHER..., The pinnacle of the Golden Dawn system of magic was its abil­ity to synthesize a diverse variety of other magical systems into a workable whole. This synthesis began in earnest upon entry into the Inner Order, the �sae R.ybae et Aureae Crucis, and was an integral aspect of the G:>=ffil ceremony itself. It then continued through each and every paper written by Mathers or Westcott fo r the Second Order Adepti and was crafted so well that few could find the seams. The Second Order looks as if it was always attached to the Golden Dawn. Many disparate magical systems, including Kabbalah, ceremonial magic, tantra, etc are linked by common ideas or the ritual itself. Whatever process was involved in generating this material there was no doubt that the Golden Dawn benefited from its use. The Z documents in particular were nothing short of genius. The question has to be: how much of this thought is different from Mathers', and how much just came from his unconscious or was influenced by something much greater? It is quite possible that it was a mixture ofboth. You cannot help notice that instead of having three chiefs who were co-equal, the Second Order just had one. That was the person who channelled it. The creation of a Second Order made Westcott the Chief Adept fo r Anglia, a role he took extremely seriously and one in which he was quite happy to remain subordinate to Mathers. Not only did he quickly understand where Mathers was going with his Second Order, he also produced many of the key documents related to it. Other than"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"N!Cl(F.Al(R,§LL 71 Westcott, one of the first people to realise that a new order was being developed was Annie Horniman. In 1910 she told Waite that she has visited Westcott and was shown a Cypher written by Mathers. To make life difficult fo r Westcott, Mathers had used the same Cypher, but had written one line in Latin, one in English and the other in French.\" This meant that Westcott not only had to transliterate from code, he also had to translate from two fo reign languages. He showed her a single sheet with a diagram of Cruces Ansatae being held over altar for the gradet. When the R£.rae Rybae et .Aureae Cmci.r was created it must have dropped a magical bombshell on the Golden Dawn. Armed with the information in the Z documents the Outer Order became magical and ceased to be anything like the Masonic or Co-Masonic rites that were then available. At this point Mathers was asking his Masters all sorts of questions about the daily running of the Order. But Mathers seems to have been a text book case fo r the dangers of working with the Theosophical System of masters and contacts. Even before the days of the Golden Dawn he was a little strange, but the more he worked with his Inner Plane contacts, the more it unbalanced him. Some of his statements show that he was having problems telling what was real and what was not. The pivotal example, which was told to W.B. Yeats, might just have been a yarn to fo ol the incredulous, but when you look at some of the other claims that Mathers' made about the Secret Chiefs, it is possible that it was meant to be seen as true, but not taken quite as literally as many modern Golden Dawn types would like. Mathers told Yeats that he was at a \"great crowd\" when he saw 'Waite jokingly pointed out that if one of the lines was in English it would not have needed translating. Some historical commentators have misread that remark to imply that Waite thought that the whole document did not need translating and it was a silly attempt to encode something that somehow confounded itself. t Westcott did not tell her that it was written by Mathers, in fact he may have produced it himself. This diagram, which should have been included in the G>=ffiJ ritual, did not seem to find its way into any of the later Golden Dawn manuscripts and appears to have been dropped in favour of a description.

Yeats worked out that the story created more questions than it answered. Why would a Secret Chief go through all the effort to manifest in a crowd and then run off without saying anything? Given that he would have been at best semi-corporeal, why would he trip over anything at all? It was, in fa ct, a fairly pointless demonstration by a Secret Chief which led no-where. Yeats, somewhat charitably, concluded that Mathers was like many people who people \"who give themselves up to images and to the speech of images.\" Mathers had proved that an image had a life of its own and that was all. What he saw did not exist in the time and place he claimed, said Yeats. It is a condition I have noticed in people undergoing some intense magical work. Part of the brain which recognises things has become so infused with the symbols being used they start to see them all around. The brain sees a person who is similar to the Secret Chief, angel, or symbol and places it in situations, such as dark or crowded rooms, where it could not quite make out what it is really seeing. & Yeats pointed out, this often leads people to believe even more strongly in the concrete reality of what they saw. In the case ofMathers, he had little else in his life that was real and this made fo r a dangerous combination. The best people I have seen who channelled Secret Chiefs were earthy types who were capable of not allowing the message to go to their heads. They had jobs, fa milies, or other things that took them away from the occult. In the case of Mathers, all he had was a fantasy relationship with \"politics\" which offered a lot of talking, back slappin� and occult overtones. • Yeats .Autobiography P2f9"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"NJCl(F.AJ\\,J?.tLL -,.., I ) It should be noted that, unlike the Outer Order, which had three chiefs who were co-equal, the lVJsae R.ybeae et .Aureae Crucis had a single autocratic Chief Adept.· Theoretically he was a servant fo r the invisible chiefs, which should have been a humbling experi­ence. In practice, groups based around giving astral entities airs and graces need guidelines to prevent their channellers from project­ing their own unconscious views onto the Secret Chiefs. This would have been particularly important if one of the channellers was an egomaniac like Mathers and the other was his wife who believed everything he told her. Normally the creation of a Second Order on the structure of a Group Mind would be catastrophic - like putting new wine into old skins. Our experience with Group Minds, which in magic are called Egregores, suggests they are conservative and will try to expel the new current. If this is not possible, the group will fracture with some fo llowing the new methods, while others adopt the old ways. The Egregore will go with those who fo llow the old ways. In this case the Golden Dawn was lucky in that the change happened a few years into the Order's history. It would have been possible fo r many of the people in the Outer Order to think that the Second Order had always been there waiting fo r those who cross the Portal, which is what they were told, or would have been told if members of the Second Order broke their vows of silence. However, this did lead to some confusion. Who really was in charge of the Golden Dawn? Although on paper the two orders were clearly separate, with the Portal rite now becoming a bridging rite, many Golden Dawn people did, and still do not, see it in that way. Mathers and Westcott were in charge of the Golden Dawn, but only Mathers ruled the lVJsae R.ybae et Aureae Crocir. • In my book Gathering the Mat.,_ic: Creating 2r\" Century Group.J, I describe this method of administration as the Guru' system.

From 1891 onwards, until the closure of Whare R.g in the 197os, the Golden Dawn and most of its off-shoots would depend en­tirely on magic to bring about the effects they wanted. The Order might have been a Masonic infant, but it grew up very quickly into a magical child. There was an element of rush to establishing the Second Order. Samuel and Mina Mathers came back from Paris to paint the Vault and its equipment.

Thavies Inn proved to be too small and in August 1892 the Vault was shifted to what Brodie-Innes later called \"dirty, noisy, smelly and immoral\" rooms at 24-2) Clipstone Street. The :Mathers were over fr om Paris in September and it is possible that this was the first chance they had to play with a new Vault consecration ritual which was to be performed every Corpus Christi. The ritual fe atured the Chief Adept repeating the most harrowing moment fr om the G)==[ill initiation by strapping himself to a cross and reciting the Oath fo r the entire Second Order. Mathers didn't like doing this and later tried to palm that part of the ritual onto Westcott. Aft er a year \\Vestcott didn't want to do it either. It is interesting, because neither \\Vestcott, Samuel nor Mina Mathers had actually been through the G)==[ill ritual. They had just repeated the Oath to each other. One wonders if taking on the responsibility in the face of the Angel of the Order might have been too much. Performing this part of the ritual, which effectively involves the ceremonial death of the candidate, opened a door in their psyches and they didn't like the experience. Or, fo r the first time, it became obvious to them that they were not initiates of the Order they had created. An initiate is someone who has been initiated into a magical system. \\Vestcott and Mathers had never been initiated into the system they had created. They had been awarded the highest grade in the Order before it even started and never experienced any magical impact of the system themselves. Magical systems are not fo rgiving. \\Vhile it would have been possible fo r them to carry out the magical acts required to initiate someone into the Order, they would not have had the magical life of their students. They might have believed in what they were doing, but they had never had the deeper aspects of their order awoken within them. The crucifixion of the candidate is one of the more harrowing aspects of the G)=lli] rite, and its inclusion in the Corpus Christi rite was a crucial magical point where the personality was sacrificed fo r the good of the Order.

Early on, the G>==I§J grade was split into sub-grades. The first was the Zelator Adeptus Minor (ZAM), which required more than 20 months of work and eight exams in a variety of different subjects rang­ing from divination to skrying. The ZAM was also required to show some practical ability by making and consecrating their own magical implements and talismans. Once these examinations were completed the person was advanced without ritual to the sub-grade ofTheoricus Adeptus Minor (ThAM). However, in 1892 most of the Second Order teachings were not ready. It seems that the ThAM material was not ready until 1896, when the requirements fo r the grade were outlined to the rest of the members. It is apparent that the complete teachings fo r this sub-grade were never fo rmerly implemented within the original Golden Dawn. Upon reaching Th.AM the adept was expected to get on with using the material as magicians. The Vault and the Order moved to 62 Oakley Square in 1894. All seemed to be working well. Samuel and Mina were in Paris, Berridge served as sub-Imperator in his absence, and Westcott was overseeing a rigorous examination system. Membership was growing and in modern terms people were being trained in magic. One of the more fa mous members of the Golden Dawn's Second Order during this time was the Nobel Prize winner W.B. Yeats, who admits in letters to friends that he would not be a poet without the Golden Dawn. But this Golden Age was not to last. The thing about magical groups is that they empower the personality. While most consider this a good thing, they probably have not thought about what happens to those darker sides of their personalities which also start to glow. The unconscious mind is stirred up during magical processes and those unconscious weaknesses, which to a greater or lesser degree we ignore or repress, start to demand attention. If they are not dealt with then the magic will cause the personality to break down and collapse. To deal with this issue the magical student must take those parts of their personality that are the most fixed and make him more flexible, take those parts ofhimself which are lazy or dysfunctional and fo rce a bit of discipline. This is easier said than done, and it seems that the Golden Dawn was not really prepared fo r the fallout. The first person who seemed to experience some problems was Annie Horniman.

The leaflet appears to have had as its theme the possibility ofhaving sex with elementals. From other sources we learn that Berridge claims not only to have succeeded in this regard but also to have fo stered elemental children. This was first identified as a Roscicrucian practice in the romance of the Comte de Gabalis. According to a letter written by Mina, Mathers chose to view the attack on Berridge as a means to indirectly target his leadership, and he was not about to dismiss his friend. Unfortunately fo r Horniman the leaflet was printed under the name Respiro, which, although similar to Berridge's motto, was not the same. While it is certain that 'Respiro' and 'Resurgam' were one and the same, Berridge could, and did, say it had nothing to do with him. Nevertheless, Horniman gathered together a group of other adepts including Westcott to oppose Berridge and claimed that he was \"not fit to be an officer in the Order.\" The next letter that winged its way to Paris came from Mrs. Rand, although the draft seems to have been half written by Westcott: Our appeal wa.r made to you in view of strong representation.r which had reached us from all sides that a person ofR.t,surgam s temperament wa.r rzot fitted for a high office in the outer court of our temple [z:e. in the G.D. i1z the Outer].

In a letter to her he told her that she should not deal with matters of sex in the Order because she was unable to judge them \"apart from her personality.\" However, he did not want to anger the person who was effectively his meal ticket so he smoothed things over with her, but it is clear that his personality was also starting to break. Like many who try to make a living from magic, he had nothing that could provide him with any grounding into the real world. While people wanted his teaching and he had a well offbenefactor in the fo rm of Annie Horniman, he didn't have to tackle those parts ofhimself which he did not want to fa ce. To combat this lack of self-confidence he created a fa ntasy world where he was in total control, a military saviour of the world, a protector of all. In doing so he could show that he really was in control and that he really had power. Mathers boxed and was an accomplished fencer, but that was a mechanism to balance the fact that he was never really in control of his life. The quest fo r domination in an esoteric order is a similar tactic fo r one who can't succeed in real life. Esoteric orders are full of people eager to call themselves Supreme Magus or Master of the Temple without doing much in the way of personal work on themselves. At the top of the pecking order of the Golden Dawn, Mathers had no guidance, no-one to tell him to work, and no one to check his deep fall into fantasy. Deep down he knew what he was doing. Horniman and Yeats also commented that he was drinking too much. This is a sign of someone trying to chemically ensure that he can stay in a fantasy world and not face his real circumstances. But from the point of view of a professional occultist, Mathers was doing very well. He had a regular income from Horniman pro­vided he stayed married and continued to work fo r the Order. How­ever, this had become increasingly difficult. In 1898 it appears that a Far Right political group based around the Scottish Rite ofFreemasonry recruited him. Mathers believed that if the goals of this group were achieved the power of Ancient Egypt would be restored and he would get a nice Highland Principality. The delusion was so great that he had started parcelling out titles and subordinate posts to his fr iends. Ac­cording to Yeats, Mathers would wander around Paris in full Scottish regalia, despite never having seen the Highlands and not travelling to"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"NI CJ(F..Al(R§LL 79 Scotland until later in his life. But Horniman was getting angry that her money was being used to prop up Mathers' political fa ntasy. Flights of fantasy were acceptable if they took you into occult realms, but fantastic politics were another matter. Things came to a head in March 1896 when Mathers came to London, locked himself up in politics, did no Order work and even failed to attend the Corpus Christi rite because he was too busy with his scheming. She wrote to him and told him that she would not pay him any more money while he carried on this political nonsense andresigned from her sub-Praemonstrator post. Mathers accepted the resignation with bad grace, adding as an additional insult that he had not been satisfied with her work anyway. But despite this, Mathers seems to have been deeply injured by the incident. He had always been looked after by women, first his mother, then the long suffering Mina, and, in his mind, the payoff was that he always protected them. The loss of financial support must have shaken his security to its very core. He must have fe lt that he was starting to lose control and people were starting to question his authority. Suffering from a sudden lack of self-confidence, he wrote a manifesto. In this manifesto he told his adepts that he was in communication with the Secret Chiefs from whom he had received all the Second Order information. Despite Mathers' claims that he could say nothing about these Secret Chiefs, he did not hesitate to use them in an effort to bolster his own importance: I do not even know their earthly names. I know them only by certain secret mottos. I have rarely seen them in the physical body and on mch rare occasions the rende:rpow was made astrally by them at the time and place which I had been astrally appointed beforehand.

I have quoted the above at some length because the mani­fe sto is crucial fo r understanding Mathers' state of mind and his attitude to the Secret Chiefs. Mathers is trying to reveal that his contact with the Chiefs is magical and of a higher level than any of them could approach and understand. Mathers is telling the ThAMs that he is important because these beings communicate with him alone. Since the Chiefs don't speak to the ThAMs in this way then he is special and is also the only way they are going to get additional teaching. Mathers projects a vision of health and physical fitness onto his Secret Chiefs. It is the physical strength and temporal power that he has craved since a child childhood, but fe els he never achieves.· What he wants is fo r his seniors to \"submit to him\" (the use of the word is his ). In other words, he wants to gain power over them and give himself an ego boost. But it is more than that, he wants them to accept his fantasy world, complete with the politics, with himself as its supreme king. Mathers fe lt it important to warn dissenters that he was the only one who had the \"contacts.\" I have seen this happen with a couple of occult leaders who use a system similar to Mathers. When their personality comes into question, they tell people that they are the only ones who have the contacts with the Secret Chiefs and if they are \"' Mathers was physically fit, and if poverty had not meant that he had not eaten enough over the years he \"could have been a contender.\" The point was that he always thought he was not good enough and also could not cope with losing.

In the manifesto, Mathers is asking members of the Golden Dawn to believe that he, and only he, talks to the Secret Chiefs of the Third Order. To do so he reveals the nature ofhis contact with them. What he describes are textbook Theosophical ideas about Masters. This is why it is easy to misinterpret what is being said if you have never worked that system. Mathers says he did not know their \"earthly names.\" It does not mean that he thought they were alive at this present time. For example, Dion Fortune, who had a similar system of chiefs, spoke to a person who was a fo rmer long dead English Chancellor. Another one of my teachers claimed to have a contact who was St. John. These would be their \"earthly names.\" Mathers said that he only knew them by \"certain mottoes.\" We have seen how this turned the Archangel Raphael into Lux E Te nebris. Mathers went on to say he had \"rarely seen them in the physical body; and on such rare occasions the rendezvous was made astrally by them at the time and place which had been astrally appointed beforehand.\" Mathers is not saying, as some have claimed, that the chiefs were in a physical body. He is saying that he rarely saw them with his eyes open. He always ran into them at astral locations. \\Vhen he was supposed to meet them on Earth it was always at a time and place appointed beforehand during one ofhis astral meetings. As we saw above, this was the standard Theosophical method of meeting Inner Plane Contacts. \"When such rende'{J'OUJ ha.J been in a much frequented place, there ha.J been nothing in their personal appearance or dress to mark them out aJ dijfm'ng in any way from ordinary people except the appearance and seruation of transcendental health and physical vigour (whether they seemed pmons in youth or in age) which Wa.J their illvariable accompaniment.

The location is often a holy spot where the energies are supposed to help the message come through. Mathers then tells his students that in his experience he has seen that it is difficult fo r a mortal, even advanced in occultism, to support the actual presence of an Adept in the physical body. This is absolutely true. It is hard to do and takes a lot of practice. You are trying to see three Kabbalistic worlds at once. However, it is close to what Mathers was requiring his Heirophants to do in his Z documents. The techniques are very similar. Mathers said that the effect ofbeing in contact with so terrible a fo rce was similar to a flash oflightning. He said that here was difficulty in respiration similar to the half strangling effect produced by ether. In Theosophical circles what Mathers was explaining was the technique of channelling which would be perfected by Dion Fortune. Firstly the spirit takes over the throat centre to allow him to speak through the medium. This creates a clicking sound, which sounds like a soft clicking in the back of the throat. As the person comes out of a long session he sometimes feels the effect of taking over his own breathing. It is unpleasant. Some of the good mediums I have met have fo und it so unpleasant they practically had to be fo rced at gunpoint into a channelling session. The point that Mathers was trying to get across is that he could not conceive \"a much less advanced initiate supporting such a strain even fo r five minutes without death ensuing.\" Sadly fo r Mathers his words were not believed. Already there had been others in the Golden Dawn who had fo und similar contacts. He already had known that the fo rtunately loyal head of the Horus Temple had even spoken to Lux e Tenbrir, Annie Horniman had her Purple adept, and Brodie-Innes and Felkin were starting to get the first Shemesh communications. What is telling is that none of the Rebels, other than Felkin, went looking fo r physical chiefs. Felkin, whose grip on reality was as loose as Mathers', was certainly looking fo r the order behind the Golden Dawn. The idea of finding physical Secret Chiefs was only an issue to those who really did not understand what he was going on about.

Ironically, Annie Horniman was one of the first to bolster Mathers' ego, by accepting his authority. However, she refused to send any more cash. Mathers' reacted petulandy and expelled her from the Order in December 1896. The London adepts addressed a petition to Mathers which was couched in the most diplomatic of tones to re-instate Horniman. A5 Howe points out, Mathers was not asked to reverse his decision, but to ask the Secret Chiefs to change their mind about throwing Horniman out. It was a stroke of genius on behalf of the adepts. It would have shown that they acknowledged Mathers in his position of mediator between the Secret Chiefs and allowed him to back down without damaging his ego. The petition was ultimately not sent, but Mathers got wind of it and indicated he would not look at it. Horniman was busy telling everyone that Mathers had thrown her out because she refused to support him financially. No one had previously known how much cash she was giving Mathers or that she had been expelled after the money had stopped. It would not take much spin to make Mathers look really bad, and it seemed that she managed to do just that. Mina and Samuel Mathers appeared in London at the end of January and met with some of the adepts. They were saying that the order to kick out Horniman had come from the Secret Chiefs, not from Samuel and it would be too hard to change the minds of the Secret Chiefs. Samuel got a grilling from the Adepti who had seen what he had written and noted it failed to mention the involvement of the Secret Chiefs in the decision. Mathers replied with an excuse which Mina would later use against a person who rebelled against her authority - Dion Fortune. He claimed that every six months Mina Mathers looked at the symbols in the aura of the senior adepts and in Horniman's case something was wrong. At the time Mina was also saying that the auras of all of the Adepti were wrong in some way and they were conspiring against the Mathers. It seems that Mina had caught her husband's paranoia. In one of Mathers' letters to Horniman, he indicated that the new target fo r his paranoia was going to be Westcott. The relationship between Mathers and Westcott was complex in that each had dirt on the other, yet both admired what the other could do. Mathers was"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"NJ Cl(F.A l(R.§LL probably envious of Westcott's popularity. In the Order \\Vestcott was admired and treated with affection. Mathers was concerned that since Westcott understood his grand magic system, he could use his popularity within the London temple to usurp his position. If you believe Crowley, Mathers, in a fa irly Machiavellian man­ner, promoted him to his representative of the Outer Order and then left a magical document with \\Vestcott's name and address on it in a London taxi cab. The story has a measure of credibility attached to it. All Golden Dawn documents at that time had \\Vestcott's name and address on them so that they could be returned to the Order in the event of the owner's death or incapacity. In 1910 Crowley printed what he claimed was a transcript of the Looking Glass Court case where Mathers admits as much. However there are flaws in Crowley's story. According to him, the documents involved \"practical instructions fo r raising devils, making yourself invisible, transforming men into animals, making gold, making rain and all the other fabled arts of sorcerers.\" There was no such Golden Dawn document. If a package had turned up in a taxi cab, with an address, the procedure would have involved contacting the owner. The cab driver would not think of researching the person's place of work in order to send it to his employers. If the documents were Golden Dawn material, they would have looked like Masonic literature and, given that organisation's influence in the police fo rce at the time, no one would have batted an eyelid. The only issue would have been if the papers were Second Order material. It is unlikely that Mathers would have condoned handing such secret material over to the profane even to get rid of\\Vestcott. Recently Darcy Kiintz has suggested a much more plausible story which takes into account the personalties involved. There was one character within the Golden Dawn who had a habit of breaking his oath of secrecy when he wanted revenge on someone, namely Berridge. Berridge was incredibly angry at \\Vestcott's involvement in the flare up with Horniman. \\Vestcott had stepped in and joined those who wanted Berridge replaced as sub-Imperator. The sub-Imperator job was Mathers' representative and effectively put Berridge in charge of the London temple when Mathers was not there. Thanks to Westcott Berridge was now suspended and then demoted. Kiintz believes that that Berridge wrote to \\Vestcott's employer and said that Westcott was a prominent official posturing as \"one"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"86 J(!NG OYERJhe WA TEI( possessed of magical powers\" and it would \"not do\" fo r a Coroner of the Crown to be made shame ofin such a mad way. In the Crowley story the officials who allegedly confronted \\Vestcott had more information than would have been obtained from any Golden Dawn documents. They knew he was a promi­nent official in the Order, which the labels on the documents did not say. The officials revealed that he personally professed to per­fo rm magic; again there is nothing in any of the circulated G D documents that could give anyone that idea. Finally, Westcott didn't relate the tale of the taxi cab at any point in his life. Later when he joined Mathers' .AO he allowed his address to be used in the same manner as he had when he ran the Golden Dawn, which he would not have done if this story was true. He believed, quite rightly, that someone had written a letter to his superiors to complain. \"I cannot think who it is that persecutes me- someone must talk,\" \\Vestcott wrote to Frederick Leigh Gardner on 17 March. But \\Vestcott was more worried that Mathers was becoming unhinged and that there would be some fo rm of conflict with him. Having someone in the Order talk to his bosses was probably the last straw. \\Vestcott had a mild nervous breakdown. It is not clear if this was brought about by his resignation from the Golden Dawn, or fo r some other reason. Although he had the SIR.tf, the Golden Dawn was his personal spiritual path and he worked extremely hard fo r it. He must have suspected Mathers and probably fe ared that his fo rmer friend would cause him fu rther trouble. \\Vestcott stopped working magic until May 1897 when he started a small Golden Dawn group with fo ur fr iends, Mrs. Kennedy, Reena Fulham-Hughes, Francis Wright and Frederick Leigh Gardner. He remained a member of the Golden Dawn. Later he would adapt the membership ofhis private group at the instructions of the Secret Chiefs. It seems his own contacts told him not to work with any women. One can only wonder why they gave this advice. Mathers was not suspected of contacting Westcott's employers, although he was in London at the time. It is possible that Mathers had help framing Westcott.

Meanwhile, things were not going particularly well fo r Berridge. The '111M1s considered him responsible fo r another batch of Lake Harris leaflets that were being distributed under the name 'Respiro.' In one of them is a fo otnote which describes how the writer had successfully worked 'arch-natural' powers against an enemy. A copy of the leaflet was sent by Berridge to another member of the order, H.C. Morris. It had a poem written on the bottom, which said: Oh! F.E.� [Homiman J, you should not let Your aTlf!Y passions rise. Your filine cla ws were never meant To scratch a Frater's eyes. The allusion was to Horniman's nickname of Tabby, which was coined by Mina. Berridge had few friends within the ThAMs, and most of them believed that he wrote the pamphlet. To them this meant that they could throw him out of the Order fo r breaking his vow of not performing Black Magic. Gardner dashed off a letter to Berridge saying that he was telling Horniman and \"no doubt you will hear fr om her solicitors in due course.\" Berridge would have had little to worry about. It was unlikely that Horniman would have wanted to be dragged through court, but even if she had, a court could not have considered the poem defamatory. Nevertheless, he wrote to Gardner and denied writing the leaflet, and like many back-garden lawyers, incorrectly claimed that Horniman would have a job identifYing herselfby her Order initials ofF.E.R. and could not claim she had been defamed. In fact, under British law it was up to Morris or Gardner to realise that he was referring to Horniman fo r a court to accept that this was the case. The rest of the poem simply says that Horniman should not get angry and it was wrong fo r her to attack him, which is not defamatory. On 7 May Gardner wrote to Mathers, who owed him money fo r a book he commissioned but had not turned up yet. Gardner told him that he knew of his financial issues and offered him free housing at the home ofhis mother in Kensington and a salary of a pound a week. A condition was that Mathers would abstain from politics and work entirely fo r the good of the Order. Another condition was that he reinstate Annie Horniman, and expel Berridge. The deal would last"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"88 l(!NG Of/ER..Jhe WA TER.._ fo r six months and, if successful, it could be continued. Needless to say, Mathers was fu rious at the idea. Not only would that mean that he would have to give up his fantasy that he was impor­tant in his political games, it also meant that he would have to give up all his power in a magical order to someone who was his student. \"I am not to be coerced by threatening,\" he said. He claimed that he was offered a political military appointment 16 months earlier worth £x,ooo a year, but turned it down because it would have meant ending his Golden Dawn work. Mina and he were not prepared to sell their whole time fo r a pound a week. However, Mathers said that Gardner meant well even though the letter was awkwardly expressed. Reading between the lines, Mathers was not actually telling Gardner 'no.' It was just that the money that was being offered was too low. Nor was it likely that he could come back to London under those conditions. He was desperate fo r money and the adepts were rallying around to give him cash. In May the Scottish temple emptied its surplus fu nds of £6o-7o to help. It seems that Mathers was simply holding out fo r more cash, and without strings attached. No one wanted to provide this. Realising Berridge's unpopularity and the fact that he had writ­ten the poem, Mathers decided that he was going to make a gesture by disciplining him. He suspended him from both orders fo r three months. The letter said that while he did not have a problem with the pamphlet, the fact that he had written a jeering verse against Horni­man was against the spirit of the Order.

The letter was marked \"private and confidential,\" which Gardner thought would enable him to say what he liked without consequence. Berridge was angry; it was one thing to be suspended by Mathers fo r three months and he probably knew he deserved it, but it was quite another to get a telling off fr om this upstart. He reported him to Mathers who could be relied upon to feel that his authority had been challenged. He warned Gardner that he was in breach of his <3)=[§] oath. Gardner replied that there was no contract made in the <3)=[§] oath in respect to being friendly to a man who slanders a lady fr iend and then publishes a claim to have used black magic against her. Gardner claimed that the Berridge affair had been a scandal and a disgrace to the Order. Florence Farr told Gardner that he was an idiot fo r sending Mathers such a letter. She didn't like Berridge either, and would have been keen to be shot ofhim. However, she also had some experience with Mathers and knew that dealing with him this way was going to cement Berridge as a part of the Order. A few weeks later she decided to block Gardner from taking any officership role in the temple on the grounds that he was rude to fellow temple members. It is possible that this decision followed discussions with Mathers about what to do about Gardner. After all, Gardner had started to believe that he could order Mathers about. He had unilaterally tried"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"90 l(!NG OVERJhe W.A TEI( to discipline Berridge, questioned Mathers' handling of the Berridge incident, and now it appeared he had been rude to other members of the Order. It is clear that Farr took the action, but it seems unlikely she did so without Mathers' blessing. Gardner resisted, conspired with and circularised members, and he was eventually shuffied to the Horus Temple in Bradford where he would be away from all those he annoyed. Mathers was again was showing his autocratic side. \"You appear to look upon me, your Chief, in the light of a paid employee whom you can bully; and I will not have it from you,\" he wrote. Berridge had somehow escaped at the expense of another of his enemies. But Mathers was now having trouble with the Scottish temple Amen-Ra. It had split into two factions. The anti-Mathers faction was being led by Brodie-Innes. On the other side was William Peck, who was Edinburgh city astronomer. It seems that Brodie-Innes, after sharing in Mathers' political schemes, had changed his mind. Brodie­Innes held the view that people were only tolerating Mathers because he had further occult teachings to reveal. Then, just when life fo r the Golden Dawn could not get much worse, Aleister Crowley enter ed the scene. He joined the Golden Dawn in London in November 1898 and advanced rapidly, completing the Outer Order grade of Practicus in 1899. That year he met and became a close friend of Allan Bennett. Bennett was a much admired ritualist, who was a staunch supporter ofMathers and a strong believer in the Secret Chiefs. He handed over much Second Order information to Crowley before he should have. Crowley later claimed that this was because Mathers gave him permission to do so, which was quite possible. Crowley had much in common with Mathers. Both were fantasists and both had restrictive upbringings. Besides, the young man seemed to have money and Mathers wanted some of it badly. Mathers visited the Horus Temple in Bradford in June 1898. He unloaded so much anti-Westcott bile into the ears of one of the chiefs, Patterson, that the chief felt the need to complain about his unfair and unfraternal attacks. This was a change from ten years earlier when both seemed to be seeing the same contact behind the Golden Dawn. Patterson told his old friend Westcott, who immediately fe ared that Mathers was going to reveal to the world that he had fo rged the Sprengel letters and the authorisation of the Golden Dawn."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"NJCJ(F.Al(,R.f:LL 91 It is not clear why he thought this, as it doesn't really make sense fo r Mathers to do this. But Mathers really had lost control at this point and believed, totally incorrectly, that Westcott was presenting himself as a Chief to rival his authority. This was affirmed when Mathers tried to bury the hatchet with Annie Horniman and re-admit her into the Order. She had to sign a note acknowledging Mathers as the Supreme Chief of the Second Order in all matters concerning the First and the Second Order. Instead of doing so, and perhaps with a liberal dose of irony she replied that she was \"waiting on an honourable message from our Chiefs.\" Mathers totally fa iled to see the irony in the comment. He thought that she was in communication with the Secret Chiefs, pre­sumably through \\Vestcott. He telegrammed her back saying, \"You are cruelly deceived, you have never known, as Westcott, has never known any chiefhigher than myself I can prove this.\" When Horniman contacted \\Vestcott, he wrote back saying he had never claimed to be more learned or advanced than Mathers, nor had he ever claimed to know or act under Mathers' Higher Chiefs. It is clear that Westcott was hoping that his comments might get back to Mathers and sooth his paranoia. If they did, Mathers' paranoia was not soothed. However, he was a little distracted promoting an idea he had to re -establish the cult oflsis in Paris. Mathers had a long standing love affair with the Goddess Isis and may have had a shrine dedicated to her in his basement. At that time he was also emphasising what he called the Mysteries of Egypt and claiming that Rosicrucianism was just another aspect of these Egyptian mysteries. In March 1899 the Mathers and a number of their fr iends were persuaded by a journalist fr iend of theirs to perform one of their rites publically at the small Bodiniere theatre in the Rue Saine-Lazare. The journalist, Jules Bois, provided all the publicity to pack the house. Reports of the performance indicate that Mathers had written a role fo r himself as a military hero of the Egyptian New Kingdom, Ramses the Great. Mina played a Priestess of Isis and together they worshipped and invoked Isis in what many would consider art theatre rather than ritual. The performances were considered quite fashionable amongst the more mystically minded Parisian middle classes. Predating screenings of the R£cky Horror Picture Show, men threw grain at the stage while women placed flowers to dedicate to the Goddess."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"l(JNG Of/E]\\fhe WA TER..., One reviewer commented that Mathers was speaking in a terrible English accent, which the reviewer later discovered was because he was apparently a Highland Scot. This probably meant that Mathers was faking a Scottish accent to match the highland clothing he was wearing in Paris. It would have been interesting, in a masochistic way, to hear a man from Bournemouth pretending to be an Ancient Egyptian faking a Scot's accent in French. The performances ran fo r two years and may have been the reason that he did not request money from the Golden Dawn temples. The performances may have begun as a money spinner, but Mathers quickly took it seriously, working out ways it could be expanded. While he could not make much of a splash as the ruler of a secret organisation, he could become more important as the head of a public church. As he brooded over the idea, in January 1900 \"Sprengel\" showed up on his doorstep with her husband and convinced him that it would work. As we have pointed out earlier, Mathers almost certainly knew that the letters that Sprengel had written to \\Vestcott were fabricated. However, he believed that the Cypher Manuscript, whatever its origin, was real, and he believed that it had contained the name Sprengel. \\Vhile he had experienced the Secret Chiefs in his scrying sessions, direct contact with Sprengel would remove any claim that Westcott ever had to being the inventor of the Golden Dawn. He could denounce him as a fraud and get rid ofhis rival fo rever. The downside of this story was that he had not meet Sprengel, but an American con­artist called Mrs. Horos. On the face of it, Horos must have truly been one of the cleverest con-artists of her age. With the minimum amount of research, she managed to convince Mathers that she was neither German nor dead, and was a Secret Chief who was behind the Golden Dawn. She must have had some charisma, because she had little else going fo r her. She was hugely overweight, something she put down to the fact that she had absorbed the energy of Madam Blavatsky (who was not exactly sylph-like) upon her death. Reading Howe, you cannot help but wonder how Mathers fe ll fo r it and believed that she was Sprengel. But if you look at the various letters that Mathers wrote about her, it is clear that he did not think Horos war Sprengel, just someone who could channel her. He de-"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"N!Cl(FAR..., R.§LL 9) scribed her as one of the best mediums he had ever encountered and what appears to have happened was that Sprengel turned up during seance sessions. He wrote to W.B. Yeats afterwards saying that on more than one occasion he talked to the real Soror Sprengel in this woman. To Mathers an astral contact with Sprengel was the same thing as a connection to his Secret Chiefs. She also apparently recounted a conversation he had years before with Blavatsky and had never mentioned to anyone. As for the woman [Ho ros J, she is probably the most poweifU! medium living and her mediumship differs from the usual.

AB an Englishman, he never asked her why she had chosen that particular physical appearance, which actually prevented her from climbing stairs. Later Mathers would cast her as an evil magician who used her skills to break up the Order. But there is a question that no one seems to have thought about at the time. Mathers so wanted Horos to have contact with Sprengel that he was psychologically prepared to edit out anything that didn't quite fit. In the case of Horos, that would have taken a lot of editing. Mathers appears to have had some doubts, but still showed her the Outer Order rituals, which she stole and later used. But what is interesting is that Mathers' own contacts do not ap­pear to have warned him, nor provided him with any information about Horos. One would have thought that Mathers' own Secret Chiefs, or contacts, would have spotted such an evil agent and warned him. This can only lead observers to the conclusion that Mathers was not in touch with his Secret Chiefs at this crucial time. Being off one's contacts, in Theosophical terms, tended to happen if you had done something wrong. ABk someone who uses that system what they think might have happened and you would get the following answer. Mathers was given a cho ice. He had to choose between his fa ntasy politics, lose his income and split the Order, or uphold the contact he had already made and carry on. He was unable to surre nder his Scottish-Synarchic fantasy and so he was abandoned and soon everything came crashing down.

He introduced her as Soror Sprengel, who was not dead as Westcott had claimed. She left when she realised that there was probably not a lot of money to be had from the Mathers. It was around this time that Mathers performed an action which he would regret. He initiated Alistair Crowley into the G)=lliJ. After being refused entry into the Second Order by the London temple, Crowley had gone to Paris to see Mathers. Perhaps Mathers was fe eling bolder after his close contacts with Mrs. Horos, which meant he could stand up to those who opposed him in London. But Mathers decided to go against the will of his London temple and initiated Crowley in a private ceremony. The ritual was either not conducted by the Paris temple, or, if it was, it was not recorded in the Temple's minute book.t But then again, Crowley was not a member of that Temple and so it would have been an official meeting ofisis­U rania being conducted in Paris. Crowley went back to Scotland and started to perform the Abramelin operation. In February he wrote to the assistant secretary of the Second Order and asked her to send him the papers fo r his grade. The letter shows how closely Crowley had identified with Mathers - it was stamped with his motto and he had signed it Alistair MacGregor. In March he received word that the London Second Order had refused to acknowledge his entry into the Second Order. This was because they were now in open revolt against Mathers. The revolt had begun in February. Florence Farr fe lt that the bickering in the Second Order had got to the point where it really should be shut down and wrote to Mathers fo r advice. Believing that • According to Paul Case, Mathers had appointed George Wiggs Group Chief in Chicago. Wiggs would send out Knowledge Lectures to anyone who paid him $10 fo r a course. He was also apparendy charging fo r astral initiations and had never taken part in an initiation himself Case fo und out that the money had been sent to the Mathers who collected about $150 a month from the scam. It would seem that Horos' information about the Golden Dawn came from Wiggs. The Mathers can have had no interest in the spiritual wellbeing of the Americans they were initiating and just seen them as a source of income. t No Second Order workings are recorded in either Minute Book anyway so it is not surprising.

It seems that Horos had realised his issues with Westcott and was busy confirming Mathers' fantasy about his former Chief's involvement in the Golden Dawn uprising. It is quite possible that Horos was saying that Westcott was a bounder who had set up the Order without her permission. Mathers' exact accusation was that Westcott was \"never at any time in written or personal communication with the Secret Chiefs of the Order\" and that he \"either fo rged or procured to be fo rged the professed correspondence between him and them.\" Mathers' claimed that his tongue had been tied all these years by a previ­ous Oath of Secrecy, demanded by Westcott, before he was shown what he had done. It is not clear why that Oath of Secrecy was suddenly voided. He went on fu rther to say that every atom of knowledge of the Order had come into the Order through him alone and that it was he who had been the only communicator with the Secret Chiefs. This is an odd statement to make. Even in his deluded state, Mathers knew that \"every atom of the knowledge\" of the Outer Order had not come from him. Howe and Golden Dawn historians have assumed that Mathers was referring to the fo rged Sprengel letters. This later theory is particularly plausible as the letter talks about making an oath of secrecy all those years ago to keep the whole fraud quiet. But it seems unlikely Mathers knew the full extent ofWestcott's plan to create the Order and when asked to make his allegations more specific he refused to do so. A clue to what Mathers might mean could appear in Crowley's unreliable transcript of the later Looking Glass trial. Mathers is quoted as saying that the London temples revolted against his authority because they thought that by declaring the War­rant to be a fo rgery he had destroyed his own authority. If Mathers was referring to Westcott fo rging Sprengel's sig­nature on the Warrant of the Isis-Urania Temple, which he did know about, then his claims made sense.

One possible scenario was that Horos, ever the masterful ma­nipulator, could have easily worked a way around this.

Further, Mathers' letter was trying to correct the misconception that \\Vestcott had received a body of Second Order workings from Sprengel, when in fa ct that material had come fr om him as a result ofhis connection with LuxE Ten ebri.J. This information was not well known within the Second Order. In 1912, Westcott had to explain it to Golden Dawn Adept F.L. Gardner, which meant that the story of the Second Order's creation had never been clear. Farr fo rmed a Second Order committee to look at the issue. She thought that if Mathers was telling the truth then the entire Order was based on a sham and it would collapse when the information was leaked. This certainly had not been Mathers' plan. He believed that the Order would just get rid of the fraudulent Westcott. However, he fo rgot that he had admitted to being involved in the cover-up and the rebels did not want to get rid ofWestcott. They were fe d up with Mathers. The committee consisted primarily of anti-Mathers members. They contacted Westcott who was uncooperative as well. This is sur­prising, as he had enough documentary evidence to sway a committee which would have not had the ability to check the fo rgery. A good reason he would not have done this was he needed to find out who Mathers actually had with him in Paris. Howe has always assumed that Westcott entirely invented Sprengel, who had the motto Sapinu Dominabitur .A1tru. This was because the coded page with Sprengel's name and address on it that accompanied the Cypher Manuscript was written in a different hand and went from left to right, instead of the right to left of the main Cypher. But the handwriting was not \\Vestcott's either and his script is seen adding the phrase \"who lived here often\" next to the address. There is a possibility that \\Vestcott did not invent Sprengel, but had simply not written to her, or had been unable to find her and had fo rged her letters. This would not have caused any problem fo r Westcott unless the real Sprengel ever turned up, alive, which is exactly the scenario he found himself \\Vestcott knew that Mathers had met with high ranking contacts in Paris before, so it was possible that he had met the real Sprengel or had channelled enough information to know the truth.

By the middle of March it seems that Mathers had realised that all was not as it appeared with Mrs. Horos. But it was too late to backtrack. He refused to acknowledge the right of the commit­tee to investigate him to exist. He claimed that his letter to Farr was private and that she should not have discussed it with anyone. Meanwhile, Westcott, still uninformed about who Mathers' Sprengel was, wrote a letter to the committee in which he sug­gested they should fo rget all about the allegations. He pointed out to them that even if they did not buy his story, they were in \"possession of a mass of most valuable occult science\" which they had all learned from the GD. \"You cannot turn your back and say you did not approve of the teachings we provided.\" In regard to the allegations, Westcott fu dged his reply, saying that he couldn't legally prove the details of the origin of the knowledge and histo­ry of the GD. He claimed that Mathers could claim the authorship because he couldn't disprove him. Westcott also spun a line that he had no wish to engage Mathers because he would be attacked violently, something he knew would resonate with the investigat­ing committee. The committee decided to suspend all operations of the Order. Mathers was fu rious. Not only had Horos made a fo ol ofhim, his plan to remove Westcott had resulted in a committee starting to threaten his position. He tried to sa ck the committee, but it ignored and suspended him until it could work out what to do. One member of the committee had another conversation with Westcott. He still had not heard who Mather's Sprengel was, and would not be drawn. However, he had made another fu dge of the story. He said that he had written to the address and got a reply cla iming to be from Sprengel. Innocently, he believed the letter. This covered him as fa r as the Order was concerned. It meant that if the letters were not fr om Sprengel, then he had been duped along with the rest of the Order.

It is also a sign of Crowley's own lack ofhumility that he failed to recog­nise that he should have been refused entry to the Second Order on the basis of point II. According to Crowley, Mathers made him a Rose Cross talisman to call upon the power of the Chief in case he was needed. He met Simpson and Berridge. They survived his questioning. Simpson wondered why the adepts had refused him entry into the Second Order and Crowley told her that it was because they believed that he was using Thomas Lake Harris's sexual techniques to gain power. He fe lt that both Berridge and Simpson would support that particular lie. *The use of masks impressed Crowley, but it had been part of the Golden Dawn Z documents since the introduction of the Second Order. Clearly it had never been implemented, as Crowley and Mathers saw this as something which needed to be introduced. Crowley used the idea in his own Order.

Of course, we only have Crowley's word that all this happened, and Crowley is not the most reliable witness to these events.

On Thursday, Hunter returned, this time with Yeats, and they had words with the landlord Mr. \\Vilkinson. They had come armed with a letter from Florence Farr who ordered the locks at Blythe Road to be changed. Wilkinson agreed, especially after he fo und Crowley's name on a Trade's Protection Association credit black list. After arranging to meet a bouncer at nam, Crowley arrived. He was wearing a black mask, fu ll highland dress, MacGregor plaid thrown over his head and shoulders, and a golden cross on his chest. He also carried a ceremonial dagger, presumably tucked into his socks. Instead of magical guardians he encountered the landlord, who told him to leave. When Crowley refused, Wilkinson called the police. In the end it was not the magic of Yeats or Wilkinson that repelled the Great Beast, 666, from the Vault of the Adepti - it was a London copper. Telegrams from confused members of the Second Order started to arrive at the temple, along with a wig fo r Mrs. Simpson, who had arranged to have it delivered in the midst of the crisis. The Battle ofBlythe Road, as Crowley called it, convinced the revolting adepts that both he and Mathers were completely mad. They suspended Mathers, Crowley, Berridge, and the Simpsons fr om the Order and stated that no one was permitted entry to the London Vault unless they were London initiates. This would stop anyone else showing up from Mathers' Paris temple and claiming that they had been permitted entry. The Second Order changed its name to the Research and Ar­chaeological Association fo r the time being.

Westcott, who actually did the fo rgery, was not thrown out and neither was the Golden Dawn's history revised to exclude Sprengel. The rebels were pragmatic. Mathers and Westcott were correct when they said that the members of the Golden Dawn had learnt magic from them. The crime fo rging of the documents was small potatoes in comparison with that.

At best he could be described as a little eccentric. But something happened in Paris which made him much worse. For a long time much of the paperwork connected to the rebel­lion talked about Mathers' interest in \"politics.\" The way such com­ments are written implies that there was an active cell of people in Paris who were scheming to place a Stuart pretender onto the throne. If this were true, it is easy to imagine Mathers' involvement. But there was no such movement in Paris at the time. Any Jacobite cells had long since dispersed and the cause was considered just as important in France as it was in England. That is to say, not at all. There had been a rise in Romantic Neo-Jacobite ideas in Eng­land towards the end ofQ.g_een Victoria's reign, but it was never a seri­ous political movement. The closest it got to direct action was a poster campaign around the time of the King Edward's coronation calling fo r the restoration of the Stuart Dynasty. But at least in England a movement, of sorts, existed. About the only \"Scottish\" thing that was important in Paris at the time was the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite ofFreemasonry. This was an in­volved 33 degree system ofFreemasonry which was more esoterically motivated than the more fam iliar three degree system of the United Grand Lodge ofEngland. The \"Scottish\" influence of the Scottish Rite was based on a fantasy that the Jacobite movement had an influ­ence on the higher degrees. John Noorthouk, in the 1784 Book ofCon­stitutioru of the Premier Gra nd Lodge of Loruion, claimed that King Charles II was made a Freemason in the Netherlands during the years of his"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"NICJ(F.AI\\,R[:LL exile (1649-6o). The fantasy was treated as fact by several anti-Masonic writers, including John Robison (1739-18o;), a professor of Natural Philosophy at the University ofEdinburgh and C. Lenning in his En­cyclopedia of Freema.romy. By the mid 18th Century the legend had been \"established\" that KingJames II ofEngland, after his flight to France in 1688, lived at the Jesuit College of Clermont, where his fo llowers fabricated certain degrees fo r the purpose of carrying out their politi­cal ends. The story fooled even the English Masonic writer, Dr. George Oliver (q82-1867), who, in his Hiftori'cal Landmarh (1846), carried the story fo rward and even claimed that King Charles II often attended meetings. The J acobites depended on a line which started with James II, James Francis Edward Stuart (1699-q66), who was recognised as James III by the French King Louis XIV and finally ended with Charles Edward Stuart, \"Bonnie Prince Charles,\" who was defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. It is possible that Mathers thought that he could rekindle the flame ofJacobite nationalism in Paris. It was certainly in character fo r him to believe that, and it could explain how he got involved with the vari­ous groups and individuals. But by the time Mathers arrived in Paris, any Scottish Rite scheming over the throne of Scotland and England had been replaced by something a little darker. The Scottish Rite was now under the influence of right-wing, anti-Republicans, who had a strong anti -Semitic bias. They were not so much interested in Scottish politics, but more in the idea of controlling Europe through a proto­fascist style elite. France was under the influence of the anti-Jewish mentality of the Dreyfuss Affair, which had split France and fo rced the right-wing into ever more extreme positions, which were eventually to take control un­der the Vichy government in France. One such personality of the period, who we know had a connec­tion with Mathers, was Gerard (Papus) Encausse. Papus was a pro­Russian monarchist, who was only officially involved with Mather's Ahathoor Temple briefly. Encausse was influenced by the magician and healer Philippe Nizier and the Marquis Joseph Alexandre Saint­Yves d'Alveydre. Saint-Yves owned all the papers of the Alchemist Antoine Fabre d'Olivet and believed that Europe should be com­posed of a synarchy where there were three councils, representing economic power, judicial power, and scientific community, of which a"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"108 KJNG OVER..Jhe W.A TEJ( metaphysical chamber run by occultists would run the lot. It was based on Plato's R.tpubli'c and, put simply, it is a sys tem where you have an elite, hierarchical clique of rulers, who are wise and base their decisions on occult knowledge. While Saint-Yves was apparently ambivalent to the Jews, his works were used to provide intellectual weight to the arguments of anti-Semites. His students were much more reactionary. Papus established a number of societies based on synarchist ideas and wrote under the pseudonym Niet, claiming there was a Jewish fi­nancial syndicate trying to disrupt the Franco-Russian alliance. For a while it was suggested that it was Papus who forged the in­famous document claiming to describe a Jewish plan fo r global domination called The Protocou of the Elders ofz:i._on. While the Proto­coli, which provided Hitler with his justification fo r genocide, were written by Pyotr Ivanovich Rachkovsky, who was the head of the Russian secret police, the fact similar arguments were made by Pa­pus did make him a likely candidate.· Another of Papus' students was Rene A.

Papus was a director to the various synarchist esoteric groups op­erating in Paris at the time and it was clear that they were all influenc­ing each other. Papus's time within the Golden Dawn was short and might have been an attempt by Mathers to impress one ofhis \"political fr iends.\" In other words, it was just a token initiation which was given in recognition of association between the Golden Dawn and Papus' activities. Such a recognition needs to be seen in the light of the Dreyfus Affair which had created a new Far Right where ethnic nationalism was mixed with anti-Semitism, xenophoby, anti-Protestantism and anti-Masonry. Papus, however, managed to move Yves d'Alveydre's id eas into Masonic and soon the Right had such orders of its own. But Papus realised that esoteric orders were not going to rule the world if they were not united themselves. He attempted to link all the esoteric orders under one big synarchy. In 1908 he held a huge convention the temple of the \"Droit Humain\" lodge. The idea was to unifY of all occult orders so that they could be a powerful political tool. No less then 20 Orders and Societies attended his convention, which had Papus as the Secretary and both Victor Blanchard and Paul Veux as Assistant Secretaries. Mathers must have been there, and although he would have been a bit player, he would have still fitted into Papus' scheming. Also present was Theodore Reuss, who would become the head of the Ordo Te mpli Orienti.r ( OTO). Reuss is an example of the sort of political games that Papus was playing and who he was linking into his synarchic ideas. Until 188) Reuss had been a member of the Socialist League in the UK and pretended to be an anarchist. For a year he had been a librarian and labour secretary. On 7 May 1886 he was ex­pelled as a police spy in the pay of the Prussian Secret Police. But while he was in the UK, possibly as a result of Mathers, he met Westcott, who gave him a a charter dated 26 July 1901 fo r the Swedenborgian Rite of Masonry and a letter of authorisation dated 24 February 1902 to fo und an SRJ..A group in Germany. He also met Crowley at the same time, probably through Mathers."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"IIO I<JNG OVER,Jhe W.ATEI( Rueus fitted into many of Pap us' plans, particularly with his connections with German intelligence.

Papus' synarchy plans collapsed when he died in 1916. One wonders what Mathers, with his Jewish wife and inter­est in Hebrew and the Kabbalah, would have had in common with these people. \\Vhile he may have been a bit right-wing by modern standards, Mathers was religiously tolerant. In one Golden Dawn paper, On the General Guidance and Purification of the Soul, he wrote: In tmly comprehended R.t,ligion there i.J no mt. therefore, take heed that thou blaspheme not the Na me by which another knoweth God; fo r if thou dost thi.J thing in Jupiter thou wilt blaspheme YHVH; and in Osirir TEHESH'V.A. \".A sk of God and ye shall have.

He could not have sup­ported the anti-Jewish bile that was coming out ofPapus and his synarchist fr iends. But the short answer was that during that period of history, anti-Semitic views were considered a lot more normal. Mathers may not have agreed with them, but he probably would not have considered avoiding a person fo r holding them. Blavatsky herself was anti-Jewish, as were many of the leading esoteric lights of the age. Crowley believed that Jews conducted human sacrifices, Maude Gonne was virulently anti- Semitic, and Yeats at various times in his life either agreed with her or was trying to impress her: It then begs the question, how did such anti-Semitic people put up with Mathers, who had written about the Kabbalah and other Jew­ish subjects? Amongst the social circles of Paris' esoteric groups, the * Although not anti-Semitic either, Yeats had a fe w quirks. His Counteu Ca thleen (1899) has evil merchants who go about the countryside and offer to purchase souls with gold.

Papus himselfhad no problem with it and did not appear to have any problems working with Mina either. While the esoteric classes were anti-Semitic in a way that would make many modern occultists cringe, • this fails to fit with the concept that many of them were writing learned tomes on Hebrew Kabbalah. But as Sepher Ye tsira by Professor Bryan Griffith Dobbst points out, these works were based on Latin translations such as Knorr von Rosenroth's l(gbbala Denudata. It seems strange in that these esoteric types were doing everything other than ask what Jewish people thought about the Kabbalah. Some of their translations, including Mathers' work, involved a superficial understanding of Jewish thought. Neither Mathers him.relfnor We.r tcott nor Crowley, for that matter, had anything more than a smattering ojHebrew, at best the equivalent today ojfour undergraduate semesters of Begirming Biblical Hebrew: adequate for picking one� way through a text word for word but hardly sufficient for producing accurate translations. Once again, the general xenophobia oj'the time in England, coupled with both anti-Judairm and an tiremtti.rm, meant that the last people to be coruulted about what their tradttion actually meant were the Jews. Nevertheless, the reactionary views of the synarchists should have alarmed Mathers and he must have chosen to overlook some of their more unpleasant aspects. But there was something in this scene which hit a nerve with him. Perhaps it was the idea of the esoteric world fight­ing to take control of the real world which was an addictive concept. Mt er all, it did fit into his fa ntasy ofhim saving the world. It could have been that amongst these people he was actually \"someone\" and his fa ntasies were accepted. Either way, the fantasy seemed impossible fo r him to shake, even while it was threatening to destroy his Order. • Most modern esoteric groups rightly regard religious or racial prejudice as counter to universal brotherhood and those who hold such views as backward. One of the things that makes the Golden Dawn attractive to modern minds is that it tells its Neophytes to hold all religions in reverance. t While making some good points, Dobbs over eggs the pudding a bit by assuming that Mathers did better because he had Moira (sic) helping him with translations. Mathers had not met Mina when he translated I(gbba!a Dmudata. Besides, it was a Latin translation, so he did not need her."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"112 i<JNG OYERjhe W.A TEI( According to Horniman, the quirks in Mathers' character started to show in 1892 when he first became involved in his politi­cal groups and other \"Mars feelings.\" His attitude almost caused quarrels, but Mina always managed to calm them. Horniman said that was when Mathers' drinking began. He also started growing louder and more obnoxious. But this also coincides with the last piece of significant writing that Mathers ever did fo r the Golden Dawn, which is the Consecration of the Vault . In many ways Horniman can be held responsible for allowing Mathers to become what he was. It was her money which enabled him to follow his synarchist career while she actively disliked its political message. It is one of the ironies that while Horniman was doing her best to protect Mina, she ended up encouraging the very thing that caused her friend to stop painting and ultimately swap the Golden Dawn for pointless political scheming. While we know that Mathers and his wife were continuing their seances, there appears to have been very little useful material being picked up. It seemed that Mathers had been told all he was going to by his contacts and we never hear of Lux e Tenbri.J ever again. \\Vhat must have been worrying Mathers was that people were starting to reach a point where the ®=[3] grade ritual and material was needed and he could not provide it. Based on my experience with those who rely on contacts and mediumship, the system tends to take its toll on the personality. A person can become worn down by repeated trance work, but worse than that, their ego can also be inflated. It does not take much fo r a person to believe they are extremely important and that the high level contact talks to them because they are the only mortal capable of receiving the message. They will start to treat other people as beneath them. If they are weak people, or psychologi­cally unbalanced, they will turn to their contact to provide them with either companionship, love, or a de facto parent figure. Soon they will begin to fe ar that they will lose or offend their contacts. Dion Fortune's biographer, Alan Richardson pointed out that losing your contacts is the occult equivalent of castration. \\Vhen it happens, the magician is completely lost and disorien­tated. The psychological effect is similar to a divorce. While occult literature might suggest that a person might lose their contacts due to a moral failure, or through not doing what the contact says,"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"NICJ(F.AI(R§LL Ilj practically it happens when they change their direction or approach. In the case ofDion Fortune it was when she moved from a Christian to a pagan approach. She said that she lost her Golden Dawn contacts when she was thrown out ofthe.AO by Mina, only to gain them back when she met Hope Hughes in Bristol and joined the Stella Matutina . When Mathers arrived in Paris he was incredibly fo cused on the Golden Dawn and whatever Lux e Tenbris was giving him. But once the G)=={ill was completed, Mathers stopped working on the Golden Dawn and started looking at other shiny objects offered to him by his synarchist Scottish Rite friends. This is speculation and it will never be clear if politics distracted Mathers enough to finish his contact with Luxe Te nbri.J, or ifhe entered that arena to compensate fo r the fact he had lost the Golden Dawn contact. I would think it was the fo rmer, because as far as the Golden Dawn was concerned, it still saw him as its idiosyncratic leader until 1896. He was clearly in the grips ofhis political fantasy in 1896 when he showed up in London around Corpus Christi and did not attend the meeting because of\"politics.\" Annie Horniman was furious. Not only was he failing to tackle the backlog of Order work which was piling up, he could not find two or three hours to show up to the most im­portant meeting of the year. \"The feeling that my honour as an upright person was being in­jured by supporting a political movement of which I did not approve grew too strong to be borne,\" she wrote. She decided to withdraw the money which she used to prop up the Mathers in Paris. One of the things I have noted amongst those who follow a magical path is that they have a belief that while they are tuned to its goals and are working towards \"the Work,\" the Universe, God, or their contacts will make sure that they don't starve. Until that moment in 1896, Horniman had provided the Mathers with money and he was looked after. Any short­age of money was largely because Mathers had high costs in entertain­ing his political cronies, as they concocted their make-believe plans fo r world domination over Port and expensive cigars. The sudden lack of money should have been a sign to Mathers that his Golden Dawn contacts had left him and would have been giving their teaching and financial support to someone else. If Lux ETenbris had not been turning up in his skrying fo r a while, Mathers would have assumed he had lost his contact and thrown himself into his back-up fantasy world of\"politics\" to compensate. & Horniman"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"l\\fNG Of/ER.jhe W.A TEI( had noted, this fantasy required him to be a right-wing autocrat who had a role within the inner circle of an emerging synarch which would eventually rule the world and give him a small Kingdom in Scotland.

Mina wrote to her friends com­plaining about it and photographs ofMathers in 1910 show him to be looking very rough. If he was still talking to them, his contacts would have been insane to suggest he take on Crowley in court, certainly with no money.

The .AO was a shadow of what the Golden Dawn had been, or was going to become. All the best magicians had joined the rebels and he was left with Berridge and a half interested Crowley.

Crowley told the story to prove that Mathers had been ab andoned by his chiefs. Given what happened to the re­bels afterwards it seemed to have a better effect than anything the Great Beast had come up with. When the leader of a magical group is thrown out by his followers, or by rival leaders, there is normally a period when they withdraw and think about their next move. Mathers did not do this. He carried on as nonnal. The way he saw it, he still had his loyal temple in Paris and his con­tacts with the Secret Chiefs. He also had the Horus and the Amen-Ra temples, although these were soon to die completely. He also had al­lies in London in the fo rm ofMrs. Simpson, her daughter, G.C.Jones, Berridge, Crowley and a couple of others who had sided with Mathers.

Teaching material and the first rituals were direct copies from the original Golden Dawn. Berridge had a full set and it was his messy dia­grams that were circulated to members. During the first few months, there is no doubt that things were \"rough and ready.\" Mathers had a printing press which had been bought fo r him by \\Vestcott. He printed out the labels fo r the course material with the addresses on which they were supposed to be sent. He also printed a pledge fo rm on I) September 1900. If Crowley hoped that he was going to be in charge of the new group, he was gravely mistaken. Many have thought that Mathers was greatly impressed by Crowley. Unfortunately, this view is based on the writings of Crowley himself, who tends to play up his own role in the Golden Dawn. Crowley seemed to think his appointment as Mathers' representative in the Battle of Blythe Road was significant fo r his future in the Order. Mathers was to be a bit more pragmatic. Using Crowley in the Battle of Blythe Road made sense. Crowley had money, which Mathers was always short of, if there was any need of court action. Crowley was loyal and keen to fo llow Mathers' orders, even if they were bizarre. But while Berridge and others who remained loyal to Mathers were rewarded with titles in the new Order, Crowley was overlooked, obtaining officerships rather than a chief's role. \\Vith Mathers and Berridge in charge, there was only one po­sition left. Chiefs usually have the role fo r life and, once appoint­ed, Crowley would only have been gotten rid of with much fu ss. Crowley was also junior to the people who would have been in his charge, something that would not have worked either. Rumours of Crowley's homosexual pursuits would also have reached Mathers' ears. The last thing Mathers would have wanted was more scan­dal when he wanted to attract members. Besides Mathers was at that time hoping to attract \\Vestcott back into the fo ld as the third chief, which would have meant no place fo r Crowley."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"N!Cl(F.AI(R§LL II\"i' If Crowley was angered at the snub he didn't mention it. \\Vith the benefit ofhindsight some years later he wrote that he had be­come convinced that Mathers had lost the plot and was no longer in contact with the Secret Chiefs. He wrote in The Equinox: SRtJ D, though a scholar of some ability and a ma gician of remarkable powers, had never attained complete initiation: and forther had fal len from hi.J original place, he having imprudently attracted to himself fo rces ofevil too !feat and tem\"ble for him to withstand. Crowley claimed that through his subtle wisdom he destroyed both the Order and its Chief and then took a nice cruise to New Yo rk and removed himself from the Golden Dawn scene. It would be a while before he returned, and by then, although he temporarily still had Mathers' respect, he was largely out of the picture. \\Vestcott joined the Isis Temple a year later and became its new Praemonstrator. He had refused to become involved in the rebellion and had kept back from taking a role in the rebels' new order. The rebels probably did not even think of asking him to take a role in their Order, believing that his resignation a fe w years earlier was still stand ing. They were also badgering him fo r information on the Cypher Manuscript and the fo rged letters allegations. He had avoided handing over this information. This had puzzled some of them. \\Vhen Yeats met Westcott in a bookshop on 5 June 19oo, he not­ed that \\Vestcott was cautious and was surprisingly defensive when it came to talking about Mathers. He seemed very anxious not to appear to go against Mathers and wanted to point out that the King over the Water had done nothing wrong. • It is surprising that Yeats fo und anything odd about Westcott being defensive during the meeting. After all, if Mathers' claim was true, then he only hid the fo rgery and Westcott was the actual fo rger. Mathers had been roughly handled by the rebels fo r his actions and there was no reason to suggest that they would be all fr aternal in their dealings with \\Vestcott. The meeting, and the fact that Westcott had not tried to defend himself, does reveal he was up to something. He is portrayed by Gil­bert and Howe as somewhat duplicitous, at times anti-Mathers and yet fr antically trying to cover his rear fr om a fu ture attack. As Gilbert says: * See Howe."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"II8 l(!NG OVERJhe W.A TEJ( Only two annver.1 come to mind.

Gilbert, who has extensive knowledge of Westcott through his papers, rejects that Westcott really believed that Mathers was in contact with the Secret Chiefs, so we are left wondering what Westcott had to gain from joining the .AO under Mathers. He might have thought that Mathers, although erratic, had delivered the goods in terms of magical material. It is also possible that after the revolt he fe lt that he should keep an eye on Mathers. However, Westcott also told Cadbury Jones that the only reason that Mathers had made his claim about fo rging the letters were because Madam Horos had told him so. By then Westcott had confirmed from other sources that the Sprengel who had met Mathers was channelled by Madam Horos. It became clear to him what happened and he knew that his ver­sion of the story of the creation of the Order was safe. He was then free to approach Mathers, submit to his authority and continue. Darcy Kiintz discovered an important note written by West­cott between April and December 1900. In a black notebook, \\Vestott had written about a rapprochement process which was being carried out between him and Mathers. This goes a long way to explaining his behavior to the rebels at the time. In April, \\Vestcott met with Crowley and drew up a prelimi­nary contract of peace.

R,f:LL 119 When Mathers was expelled in May negotiations contin­ued and Mathers and Westcott signed a compact on 18 May. As we will see later, what Mathers thought Westcott had signed was completely different from what Westcott believed that he had. Mathers thought that Westcott would support him as he tried to get back his temple properities. There are signs that Westcott did this in his approaches to the committee, but the only tangible thing that Westcott agreed too was to give Mathers a complete set ofG D rituals and material. Even in this he was careful only to give what Mathers or Berridge asked fo r. For example, Berridge did not have a copy ofZ3, which Westcott gave him. The letters which must have gone between Mathers and West­cott no longer exist. A letter sent by Mina Mathers to Annie Horni­man in June that year hinted of some kind of positive dialogue flowing between Westcott in Mathers at that time. Instead of parroting her husband's previous claims to be the only source of the Golden Dawn, she crucially mentions that \"the whole property, knowledge and manuscripts of the Order\" since the death ofDr. W.R. Woodman was vested in Mathers and Westcott. According to Mathers, the pair signed and stamped a treaty short­ly after the rebellion. Although this treaty, if it ever existed, has disap­peared, it was referred to in a letter from Mathers to the rebels in July 1902. I fit existed then it is most likely to have been signed in June 1901. According to Mathers: .A stamped treaty duly sigped and witnessed existJ between Dr Wjmz Westcott and myse(£ by which he undertakes to support on Oath. my claim to the property [of the temple]. It must have been an awakening fo r Mathers to realise that Westcott was not the grand schemer trying to take over his order. As Gilbert points out, if the rebels had Westcott as their leader, then the Gold­en Dawn would never have ended. By siding with Mathers, Westcott made sure it lacked the leadership to carry on. For a short time it was Westcott and Berridge who ran the Lon­don temple. Westcott probably worked with the same dedication to that temple that he had applied to the original Isis-Urania. However, he did not appear to be keen to turn up to meetings, discretely missing some crucial gatherings. But he did prove valuable in giving Berridge rituals that he was missing and explaining some of the more esoteric"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"120 1\\!NG 0 VER..Jhe W.A TEJ( aspects of them. \\Vhat is interesting is Westcott's role in teaching Ber­rige the ritual and in particular the Z documents which Berridge did not have. Westcott mentions answering questions from Ber­ridge about the rituals. One wonders why Berridge was unable to talk to the King over the Water about them. Some researchers have been surprised to discover that West­cott had taken a senior and public position in Mathers' order after promising his employers that he would no longer be involved in magical groups. Something must have changed. Westcott allowed his motto and address to be spread all over .AO material in exactly the same manner has he had done in when he was in charge of the Golden Dawn. If he had ever made a pact with his employer to leave the Golden Dawn, the person he had made the pact with no longer had any authority over him. It is equally possible that the whole resignation story might have also been embellished by Westcott to cover some other problems he was having with the Golden Dawn. There had been a backlash among some of the male members against what was considered a petticoat administration by women. During his absence away from the Golden Dawn he had a small working group ofhis own, but he refused to have anything to do with fe male members. According to Mary Greer, Florence Farr was fo rced to ask Westcott any questions about Golden Dawn matters through a male. Westcott, who had been busy with the SR/,.A, and worried about the unstable Mathers, might have just decided to opt fo r the quiet life. The story that he had to choose between his job and running the Order was possibly just a dramatic invention which everyone believed. If this were the case then it would have been typical ofMathers to take the credit when discussing it with Crowley. Other people who defected from the rebels at this time, in­cluding a Mrs. Scott who had joined the Order in 1897. She seems to have fallen fo ul of Annie Horniman, who had fo und her way back into the rebels' Golden Dawn. On her departure, Scott had flung a Parthian Shot of vitriol in Horniman's direction. Then, safely within Berridge's temple, she sent a threatening letter which said:"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"NICJ(FAR.l?.§LL Dr Berridge said to me, that ifyou helped Florence Farrand oth­ers to fight Mathers he would tell your father you were dabbling in magic and he felt sure that your fa ther would have you shut up in an asylum. 121 To threaten that sort of thing is nasty, but Scott or Berridge ac­tually followed up this threat by writing a letter to Horniman's fa ther, who was a Liberal MP. The letter claimed that Annie was a member of a \"secret order which has fo r its object practising so called witchcraft of the Middle Ages.\" It was not clear what Mr. Horniman made of the letter, but he referred it to his daughter to deal with. The letter was signed \"a constituent,\" but Horniman saw the hand of Berridge and ordered her solicitor to write an an­gry letter to him. The letter said that Berridge should stop making \"libellous statements,\" as he would look very fo olish when asked publicly to explain what \"magic\" means. It certainly had the desired effect, as Berridge and the Lon­don .AO seem to have left the rebels to implode. But Berridge's tendency to shoot his mouth off in public, coupled with the bile he fe lt fo r the rebels, was always a threat. \\Vhen Florence Farr attempted to initiate Princess Aribert of Anhalt, one of Qg_e en Victoria's grand-daughters, the whole procedure had to be car­ried out with more secrecy than normal because it \"might reach Berridge's ears and then all the fat would be in the fire.\" Both Orders were fa cing a crisis soon that would be a little more important to their fu tures. Madam Horos and her husband arrived in London. After their brief association with Mathers, the pair had fled to South Africa, but had to leave in a hurry when they heard that police were looking to arrest them. Their first port of call was \\Vestcott, who had a visit from Mr. Horos in early December. It seems that Horos was trying to find out information about Mathers. \\Vestcott must have been curious to see the person who fo oled Mathers, but he obviously wanted to see if they actually had any real occult information too. \\Vest­con probably told Horos that he had resigned from the Golden Dawn and knew nothing about the latest news, referring the pair to Gardner fo r a proper grilling. Gardener managed to establish that they were just confidence tricksters who knew nothing about the Golden Dawn."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"122 I<JNG OVER..Jhe W.A TEI( It is worth noting that \\Vestcott didn't want Mathers to know that he had spoken to Horos. After managing to sooth the waters between himself in Mathers he did not want to stir things up by being seen to be talking to someone Mathers regarded as an en­emy. Gardner likewise had just made his peace with Mathers and also did not want the conflict. Both of them stayed quiet about their meeting, but refused to have anything more to do with the Horos couple. The Horos couple tried their luck with the rebels and fo und no joy there either. Yeats reported their presence to Mathers and was abused fo r his pains. Rebuffed, the Horos couple took over a religious cult called the Theocratic Unity in London and transformed its teaching. The cult's new and somewhat complicated beliefs we re centred on Theo Horos, who claimed that he was not only Christ, but also a Mother Goddess who was confined in a male body. It was suf­ficiently silly and confusing to seem plausible to the sorts of peo­ple they hoped to fleece. Since everyone loves a mysterious ritual, the pair used the Golden Dawn rites which they had stolen from Mathers. It is a scam which has proved very fruitful again in the mod­ern day, with bogus magical orders using rites photocopied from Israel Regardie's Golden Dawn to cover what is essentially a mon­ey-making scheme. Where the Horos couple went wrong was that they were not just interested in money. Like many shysters who find themselves in a position of power over the gullible, Theo managed to play out a few of his sexual fantasies. Madam Horos was happy to play along with this, particularly if money was to be obtained from it, so agreed to play the role ofTheo's mother. The scam worked like this: \\Vomen would respond to an ad­vertisement from Thea who pretended to be single and wealthy. They spend the weekend with him and his mother, the highly spiritual Swami Horos. Theo would propose and then would initi­ate the victim into the Theocratic Unity cult using the rituals of the Golden Dawn. Later he would marry the poor woman using a \"Golden Dawn ritual,\" fo llowed by sex which would be watched by Swami Horos. \\Vhile this strange relationship was going on, the Horos couple would be trying to separate the woman fr om as much cash and jewellery as possible."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"NJCJ(F.A]\\.R§LL 12j It is not clear how many people the Horos couple managed to con in this particular scam. One of them, Evaline Mary Maud Croysdale, testified in court that this was the couple's modus op­erandi. But it was the case of Daisy Pollex Adams which got the Horos couple into the most trouble. Adams was 16 and her mother met the Horos couple at the house of a religious loony called Mr. Wood. \\Vood ran a church called the Army of the Lord. He thought he was King Solomon and that Madam Horos was the Qg_e en of Sheba, but he also be­lieved in a diet of freshly cut grass and chalk washed down by water was all that a person needed to live. Wood admired the Theocratic Unity but changed his mind suddenly while reading the Book of Daniel and apparently decided the Order must be destroyed. The Horos couple managed to convince Daisy's mother to let her live with them while she completed her education in shorthand typing. Soon after Daisy and her brother moved into the Horos house, Theo told her that she had to spend the night in his bed while he explained some of the mysteries of the \"Golden Dawn\" to her. That night he said that she was going to be his \"little wife,\" because the spirit of Christ was in him. Later the pair began a sex­ual relationship with the fu ll consent of Daisy, who thought Thea was the Son of God. Then fo llowing the normal pattern of the scam, Daisy was in­itiated into the Theocratic Unity by the use of the Golden Dawn @=[QJ ritual. By September, Daisy was less sure about Thea's divinity and was not keen on having sex with him anymore. Thea's response was to rape her while his wife held her by the head. Daisy told Laura Faulkner, who had also replied to an advertisement in the paper and was staying with the couple. No-one was able to con­vince Daisy's mother of the allegation. Instead she believed a let­ter that her daughter was fo rced to write saying that she was sorry to have wronged Theo by making the allegation. The couple were arrested and there was a public trial that resulted in Theo being sentenced to I) years jail and his wife to seven years. The problem fo r both Mathers and the rebels was that the Golden Dawn rituals were read out in court. More than that, among the details of the rites were the Neophyte's oath. This in­cluded the phrase:"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":".KJNGOVER,jhe WA TEI( ... these points I generally and severally, up on this sacred and su b­lime symb ol, swear to observe without evasion, equivocation, or mental reservation of any kind whatsoever; under the no le.f.f pen ­alty on the violation of any or either of them of being expelled from this Order, as a wilfu lly perju red wretch, void of any moral worth, and unfit for the society of all right and true persons, and in addi­tion under the awful penalty of voluntarily submitting myself to a deadly and hostile current of will set in motion by the chiefi of the Order, by which I should fall slain and paraly'{!d without visible weapon as if slain by the li'g htningjlash. The Solicitor-General dubbed the entire rite as blasphemous and the tabloid press had a field day with it. It would be nearly im­possible to run a magical order with the name \"Golden Dawn\" in England, without the connection being made to the Horos trial. Mathers, with a total lack of public relations skills, attempted to \"set the record straight,\" while at the same time having a dig at the London rebels. He initially attempted to get a letter read out in court in which he claimed the Golden Dawn's name and rituals had been usurped because its documents had been stolen. When this fa iled to happen, he wrote to Light magazine asking that they publish it: The letter read: Th e teachings of this Order of the G. D., which has existed from ancient time, inculcate nothing but the highest social and religious virtues, moral purity, and fraternal charity; and those persons who cannot adhere to these principles are neither allowed to become nor to remain members.

Its real title has from ancient time bem kept secret, to prevent, as ja r as po.f.fible, imposters and advmturers from making use of its name to shield their malpractices. The letter told of Mathers' doings with the Horos couple and how they had fo oled him. He added that Madam Boros had been briefed by the London rebels so that she appeared to have more"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"NI Cl(F.Al(R.§LL 12) knowledge about the Golden Dawn than an outsider should have. Vnder these circumstances she managed to take from my house (besides other things) several manuscripts relating to the Order of the G.

From these she and her infamous accomplice would seem to have concocted some form of initiation under the name of my Order, to impose upon their unfortunate victims. It did not take me long to find out the kind of persoru the so-called Mr. and Mrs. Horos were, and I refused to receive them; but as Head of my Order I did not want to lose touch of them entirely till I could find out more about them, and especially whether they were emissaries of enemies within my Order, or of those without, or of both. Again, trying to link the rebels to the Horos couple, he pointed out that it was after they left Paris that the rebellion against his rule started. He did weaken his argument somewhat when he admitted that one of the rebels (Yeats) had written to him warning that the Horos couple were active in London. Given the circumstances, this sort ofletter was exactly what the Golden Dawn should not have been throwing into the public arena. But Mathers had nothing to lose. Membership ofhis temple was still small and any adverse publicity would fall on the rebels. Sure enough, its membership plummeted. To counter the bad publicity, the rebel order changed its name to Morgen R,p_the. It also performed some minor surgery to its rituals: * Many of these changes fo und their way into Felkin's Stella Matutina. If anything, the Oath was made more graphic than tamed. The Guardians of the Order were more specific in their threats fo r the \"breaker of oaths.\" Now the poor candidate was expected to suffe r death or palsy or to be overwhelmed with misfortune. However, much of the poetry of the ritual, which many associate with the Golden Dawn, was added by the Morgen R,p_the rebels at this point."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"The FA DING of the WILL CH.APTE�FIVE Mathers knew that he had to do something to counter any fallout from the Horos trial. The name Golden Dawn had been contaminated by being pushed into the group mind of the nation and mocked. Like the rebels, he decided to change the name ofhis order to that oftheAO and rewrite the rituals. Part of this related to astral security. Mathers saw himself as the fountain of inner knowledge and power that poured into the cups of the temples with which he had worked. If he wanted to cast the rebels into outer darkness, he needed a way to cut off the rebels' supply. The Golden Dawn ritual makes much of the idea of pass­words. These are seen as physical words that prevent people who have been thrown out of the Order getting back in or showing up at another temple and claiming that they are members in good standing. But a password was also seen as having the magical effect of allowing the person to participate in the astral workings of the temple and the group mind of the temple. In most cases this would be at a subconscious level, but it was still an important part of the magical effect of a temple. A password system assumes that a tern­ple will keep running and the person who does not know the pass­word will be chucked out.

By 1904 the new rituals were re ady and the Order had changed its name to the �sicrucian Order of .Alpha et Omega or .AO. But the rituals themselves remained close to those of the original Golden Dawn. In the @=[Q] the most significant change was the insertion of the fo llowing during the opening of the ritual and during the bringing of the candidate to the light sequence: Hierophant: Whence is the title .AO and its signification? Hiereus: Pronounced as a single word «.A.

Hierophant: Prometheus. Hiereus: Epimetheus. Forethought. Aft erthought. Hegemon: (1). And the path ofMan between. This last sequence came from the Equinox ritual of the Golden Dawn and seems to have been added by Mathers to change the flavour of the Opening. Certainly it makes it a little different, but it is not really going to change much, other than break the link between the Outer Order rituals and the Cypher Manuscript. A sequence like this should certainly have been mentioned in the Cypher or at least have been hinted at."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"l(!NG OVEJVhe W.A TEI( Mt er the Candidates have taken their oath, they are told that the .A 0 was known in English speaking countries as The Order of the Golden Dawn in the Outer.

The above quote is word-for-word the version that Mathers sent to the press to explain his Order's involvement with Horos. It seems that he wanted to keep using the phrases rather than come up with something new. It would seem from that comment that it was Mathers' intent to use the Golden Dawn name again once the dust had settled fr om the Horos scandal. He never did, and neither did his successors, although the name keeps appearing in the later rituals. But what is more surprising is that Mathers moved away fr om a magical approach to the @=[ill, wh ich was first suggested to him by Raphael, and into a more conventional Craft Masonic style of operation. Under instructions entitled ORJ)El(and PR.[JCEDVR§ in the TEMPLE, Mathers envisaged a ritual which was remarkably like Craft Masonry. The temple is opened. The work of the grade is gone through.

The explanation of the symbols of the grade. The address of the Hiereus. The subjects of study. The effects of the fluid at the end. • The candidate may be led around twice or once only, instead of thrice. • The temple may be declared open or closed by sceptre.

Even if you take the most basic instructions in the Z documents and do not embellish them with half the godforms, it takes an extremely competent magician to initiate more than one person at a time. I do not believe that there is a single person living who can concentrate that well, and besides, the Golden Dawn Z structure prevents it happening. At the point when Mathers suggested the idea he saw the Order as a money making source. As you will see later in the Z documents, he described things like the astral body of the candidate being split from the candidate and being placed between the pillars, which would be impossible with half a dozen people. Likewise, it would be difficult to see their sphere of sensation interact with various godforms at different times. Groups which are carrying out this practice need to get the maximum number ofbums on seats for their groups. They do not care about the quality of the magic -they want the quantity of people. This might be, if they collect dues, to make money fo r themselves, but it could also be for the ego value ofhaving a large temple. Either way, it is not a group that anyone serious about magic should be interested in joining. Bringing someone into the mysteries is a sacred task. It cannot be done as if operating a production line with everyone getting the same experience. As each candidate approaches a godform, it will react differently to them based on their experience. You can see this when the officer's voice changes in ritual as their godform energy changes. That is impossible iflarge numbers are involved.

The loss of the transformation of the fluid removes symbolic alchemy from @=[ill. It is a powerful part of the ritual which links transformation with the Oath. But the chemical change is also an important part of the alchemical aspects of the rite. Although it is buried amongst dire threats towards the candidate if he breaks his oath, it also has a direct effect on the candidate's Sphere ofSensation. The @=[ill takes the candidate through three alchemical stages, but the chemical change at the end is the final \"reddening\" before the final transformation. Without it the candidate would be stuck. The flippant disregard that Mathers takes in making these cuts would appear to suggest he had no idea what the Z documents were going on about. Either that or he wanted his new .AO to abandon magic. Mt er all, by giving the Golden Dawn students magical techniques, they had rebelled against him. The London temple seemed to run smoothly, although not without its moments. Crowley returned in 1903. He was treated respectfully by the members of the Isis Temple. According to his own notes, he was present at the Ceremony of the Vernal Equinox as Hierophant while Berridge was Cancellarius. The relationship was not to last. According to Francis King, Crowley had a row with Mathers. The violent quarrel was over Crowley's long stay in the Far East.

Like many esoteric students who cannot understand why they followed a particular teacher, Crowley decided that Mathers must have been good until he had been possessed by Mrs. Horos. In March 1904 one of the members, Mrs. Cunningham, sued Berridge fo r £1,ooo, which she claimed he owed her fo r a brooch. She told the court that Berridge had signed a £1,ooo promissory note fo r the brooch, which had certain occult symbols on it. How­ever, when she sent a friend around with the note to collect the cash, Berridge ripped his signature from the piece of paper and flung it into the fire. Like many Golden Dawn court cases, the affair was lovingly reported by the press. The Daily Telegraph reported Berridge's side of the story, which was that Cunningham had lied to him about the brooch's history. She told him it had been given to Maria Antoinette by the oc­cultist Cagliostro, but other than some astrological symbols there was no proo£ She told him to keep it anyway. He never signed a promissory note and the only reason he destroyed the one that Cunningham's friend had shown him was because it was a fo rgery. Probably in an attempt to show him as a less than credible wit­ness, Cunningham's lawyers dragged up his long membership with a \"Hermetic Society.\" They asked Berridge ifhe thought he had magi­cal powers. He denied this, but did believe it was possible to concen­trate his willpower. He also confessed to a belief in astrology, which was socially acceptable. Berridge brought in an expert witness who told the court that the brooch was probably worth half a crown and was probably only 2) years old. Mr. Justice Channell thought there was more to the case than met the eye. He had the impression that people were not telling the whole truth and as a result had to find a verdict in favour of Berridge. \"It might be the fact that these people were of an abnormal character with these beliefs in things that were not generally held accounted fo r the matters, which to his mind, were unintelligi­ble,\" the Telegraph reported."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"NICJ(F.Al(.R§LL In February 190), Mrs. Evelyn Sheffield brought a breach of promise action against the Marquis Townsend, only to drop the case the next day.

Weekly Dispatch reporters investigating why such a high profile ac­tion had been dropped fo und out about Sheffield's membership. According to R.A. Gilbert, by talking to a fo rmer member of the society, they managed to get their hands on a pledge fo rm, which had Mathers' and \\Vestcott's name and addresses. The story contained a short of a description ofthe.AO rituals. Not actually having a copy of the rituals, the Dispatch reporters interviewed their typewriters and came up a convincing one in­volving ten virgins and the blood of a wh ite dove. Mathers made the grave mistake of writing a letter to the edi­tor to complain. The newspaper, always searching fo r a follow-up where virgins and doves were concerned, sent around one of its journalists to interview him. Anyone sensible to the ways of the media, particularly if he had made an idiot of himself in front of Fleet Street's finest in the past, would tell you to never allow your­self to be interviewed by a tabloid reporter if there is the faint­est whiff of occultism involved. The reporter will, at best, make you look and idiot, or at worst a depraved black magician. Fortu­nately, Mathers was only made to look like a prized prig with the reporter noting his \"exaggerated dignity\" and ornamental jewel­lery. Mathers let slip Westcott's name in the interview and so the reporters visited him too. Unlike Mathers, Westcott had the good sense to deny every­thing. He said that he had severed his connection with the Golden Dawn ten years earlier and had not heard fr om Mathers since. Since the reporters clearly did not know how the AO worked, nor had seen any of the dated ritual papers with Westcott's address all over them, he was able to escape fu rther questions. Despite the legal woes, Berridge's temple was quietly getting on with things. By June 1908 it was working Portal rituals and had a Vault with which to initiate people into the G)=ffiJ.

John Brodie-Innes had been initiated into the Golden Dawn in August 1890 and had entered the Inner Order in April 1893. That year he moved to Edinburgh where he both established a law practice and petitioned his Chiefs to fo rm a new temple. On 8 June 1893 a char­ter was granted fo r Amen-Ra temple and Brodie-Innes became the primary fo rce behind a sudden burst of G D membership in Scotland. \\Vestcott was required to provide him with ten pledge fo rms fo r the remainder of that year alone. Brodie-Innes was appointed the tem­ple's first Imperator, Dr. George Dickson was made Praemonstrator, and Brodie-Innes' wife Frances became Cancellaria. In 1897 problems arose within the Amen-Ra temple to which Mathers responded by taking direct control of the Temple. He assumed the role of Imperator, removed both Brodie-Innes and his wife from office and transferred them as \"private members\" to the Isis-Urania Temple. Mathers was not physically present in Edinburgh, leaving \\Villiam Peck, who was sub-Imperator both before and after the \"coup,\" effectively in charge. Clearly the loss of the Imperatorship bothered Brodie-Innes, fo r as late as 1901 he signed himself as \"late\" Imperator of the Amen-Ra temple. R.A. Gilbert writes, \"The most probable cause of this upset was Brodie-Innes' creation of a 'Solar Order' with its own Cromlech Temple within the confines of Amen­Ra.\" The development of the Cromlech Temple was pursued with vigor throughout 1896. The result of these events within Amen-Ra was the fr acturing of membership loyalties between Brodie-Innes and Peck. Peck, who had been and remained a Mathers' loyalist, now contrasted sharply with Brodie-Innes, who became very anti- Mathers and complained about his chief's interest in politics. During the revolt the Amen-Ra temple remained loyal to Mathers, while Brodie-Innes and his fa ction sided with the rebels. After 1901 the Amen-Ra temple broke up as a direct result of the Horos scandal. Terrified he might be exposed as a member, Peck resigned fr om the Order and burnt everything he had in connection with it, including much of the temple properties. Being a senior member within the Second Order and having at­tained the prestigious ThAM degree, Brodie-Innes fo und himself in a strong position during and after the London revolt. Like some among"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"NICJ(F.Al(R.§LL the rebels, he believed that while Mathers had many fa ults, the Inner Chiefs had been connected to the Order through him. For the Order to survive he considered it important that the rebels make their own contacts with the Secret Chiefs. Prior to the revolt of 19oo, Dr. R W. Felkin apparently made con­tact with the Inner Masters ofBrodie-Innes' Solar Order. His mem­bership within Florence Parr's Sphere Group likely taught him the value of using mediums to obtain additional teachings. Consequently, employing his own medium Felkin contacted the Hidden Masters of the Sun. In addition to this fo rm of contact, Dr. Felkin believed that he occasionally received \"impressional\" and \"astral\" teaching from the Third Order. The results of these contacts sufficiently impressed Brodie-Innes that he became a strong Felkin supporter and advocat­ed his position as a Chief within the new ruling triad established by the rebels. That Dr. Felkin was junior to him and still only a ZAM does not appear to have deterred Brodie-Innes early on. The constitutional crisis in Morgen R.p,the was resolved and Felkin, Brodie-Innes and Percy Bullock became the new chiefs. But they were not the only people who considered themselves as having contacts with the Secret Chiefs. Annie Horniman had considered she had fo rged a link with a person called the \"Purple Adept.\" Felkin rightly believed that Horniman considered herself a real Chief of the Order and was seeking to overthrow the new triad. Fortunately, Horniman gave up and took her Purple Adept elsewhere. The constitution had allowed fo r the democratic election of the Chiefs, and by 1903 Bullock, Brodie-Innes and Felkin could not get enough votes. A.E. Waite took over the Order and reduced the magical element in the ceremonies. Felkin left the Morgen R.p,the to fo rm the Amoun Temple, renaming his Order the Stella Matutina. Brodie-Innes left with him. Felkin later engineered a concordat with Waite and his group, but Brodie-Innes could not really support anything done by Waite. Sometime before early 1906 Dr. Felkin lost his connection with the Sun Masters. Ironically, Brod ie-Innes fo und a replacement fo r this connection known by the name of Sheme.rh.* In April 1906 Brodie-Innes and Felkin reached an agreement with Felkin as Imperator and Brodie-Innes as Praemonstrator of Amoun Temple.

Although not connected with the Golden Dawn, Felkin and Brodie-Innes continued to develop the Solar Order and had tak­en on the task of developing the Inner Order work of the Stella Matutina. However, Felkin was now dependant upon Brodie­Innes fo r most ofhis contact with the Secret Chiefs or Masters. In an apparent response to Brodie-Innes and his Sun Masters Felkin fo und a continental contact in the flesh, and toward the end of 1908 formed an astral link with someone who identified himself as .Ara Ben Sheme.rh. (Ara the Son ofShemesh.) The timing of all this is curiously convenient. Much merriment has been made by Howe and Francis King about .Ara Ben Shemesh. Howe said that he was a discarnate Arab who claimed affiliation with the desert-temple visited by Christian Rosenkreutz on his Middle Eastern pilgrimage. Although Felkin had a nasty habit of taking legends as history, it is unlikely that he considered Ara Ben Shemesh a historical personality. \\Vhile A. B.S. claimed to be a personal teacher ofFelkin's, his subsequent influ­ence upon the Stella Matutina is evident. Concurrently, Brodie-Innes' new contact, Shemesh, began to provide new and varied occult information, some of rather high quality. These Cromlech papers often sign Sheme.rh's name, fre­quently writing it in Hebrew or with a transliterated script: Sh, M, Sh.\" Papers from Cromlech also refer to the Sun Masters in the plural. This means it is unlikely that Sheme.rh was ever considered to be one person but rather a committee of Chiefs or Masters who worked along similar lines. Brodie-Innes was no fo ol, and ifFelkin had been turning out the flowery nonsense seen by many New Age channellers he would not have supported Felkin to the extent he did. In fact, Brodie­Innes was busy churning out such material himself so he recog­nised its value. Some of the teaching was a development of what had already been seen in the Golden Dawn. In particular, papers connected to the Golden Dawn's explanation of the Aura, which was then called the Sphere of Sensation. According to Tony Fuller, Brodie-Innes's contacts were sug­gesting that Cromlech should become a \"Third Order\" system fo r the Golden Dawn, fo r those who had attained the <3)=ffi] grade. • The word is both Hebrew and Arabic."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"NICl(F.Al(RgLL Mt er the death of Mathers, when he managed to take control of the .AO, he was never able to accomplish this. His moves were blocked by Mina who had difficulty changing anything with which her husband had been involved. However, Cromlech did become important to the later .AO after Mina's death. The next major issue the Order faced was the publication of the Golden Dawn rites by Aleister Crowley in March 1909. Crowley wanted to publish the Second Order rituals of the Golden Dawn in issue three of his magazine Th e Equinox. Mathers was tipped off and slapped an injunction against Crowley to prevent publi­cation. However, lacking money to continue the court action, Mathers had to let the case lapse. The lack of support from the Stella Matutina and the remnants of the rebel Isis-Urania temple was interesting. Failing to back Mathers meant that its rituals were published. By not supporting Mathers financially, they effectively allowed Crowley to win and the case to be publicly discussed in the local paper. Even the Isis temple of Berridge failed to come up with anywhere near enough cash to prevent the case failing. Brodie-Innes seems to have been Mathers' main supporter in the case, but this did not stretch to providing enough cash to keep the case open. Sure enough, when the case fa iled, Crowley printed some of the rituals in The Equinox, but fe ll short of a full expose. For a start it published Golden Dawn rituals rather than those of the .AO. Both sides could claim that they no longer used these rites. Most of the material seemed designed to beat up on people he didn't like in the Golden Dawn rather than be a full expression of the magical system. By keeping a low profile, the Stella Matutina, Waite's group and Berridge's Order managed to avoid a repeat of the Horos trial, mostly at the expense ofMathers. In March 1910, Berridge was in trouble again for his involve­ment with the teachings ofT.L. Harris. It seems that someone was attempting to give material to people who might like to see Ber­ridge publicly smeared. High on the list was Aleister Crowley. According to Crowley he received an anonymous letter signed by a person calling himself\"White Magician.\" The letter enclosed a pamphlet by Harris and accused Berridge of the foulest vices.

This would have been a reasonable argument, of course, if Crowley had not decided to mention the incident in Th e Equi11ox and thus repeat the smear. Felkin was at that time becoming more obsessed with finding the Secret Chiefs, whom he was now convinced included real peo­ple. His aim was to gain the higher rituals and teachings of the Second Order. According to Howe, the Sun Masters had correctly tipped Felkin off that Mathers had not received the Ritual of the (])=[±] and therefore could not advance anyone beyond ®=lil. Determined that the Stella Matuti11a should be able to provide a full curriculum to <])=@], he toured Europe looking fo r the Masters to provide these grades. All he ended up with were a fe w meetings with the mystic Rudolf Steiner, who was going through a Rosicrucian phase.

This advanced teaching turned out to be 6o to 70 typed pages of mostly ThAM material, and, frankly, Brodie­Innes was disappointed. There were no rituals fo r the @=[3] and <])=@] grades; Mathers had written little new material in the Golden Dawn tradition. However, Brodie-Innes was impressed enough to remain a member of the .AO and was content enough for the time-being to wait for the promised manuscripts. It was reported that at his time Samuel and Mina joined the Cromlech temple. This could have been only in an honorary capacity as they continued to reside in Paris. • In Golden Dawn, Twilight of the Magician1, RA Gilbert believes it was at the time of the Equinox trial that Brodie-Innes met Mathers and started the dialogue which would result in him defecting from the Stella Matutina and joining the .AO."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"NJCJ(F.ARl<f:LL 1)9 During the course of these events, Brodie-Innes reactivated the Amen-Ra temple in Edinburgh in December 1910 under the ae­gis of the Stella Matutina. The temple was small, only 12 members, and included several of Felkin's fr iends, including Dr. Carnegie Dickson and his wife. Although he had been made a Chief of the Isis temple in 1910, Brodie-Innes did not fo rmally break with Felkin until 1912, inform­ing him in July of that year. This duplicity was brought to Felkin's attention by Waite, ever the stirrer, who informed Felkin that his other Chief was working with Mathers. A transcript of this conver­sation with Felkin indicates that Brodie-Innes was playing a larger political game. His idea was to merge all the existing Golden Dawn orders under one umbrella. He reasoned that with all the teachings of Cromlech, Mathers, Felkin, the Stella Matutina, and Waite's temple merged, it would be an irresistible esoteric fo rce. Brodie-Innes's Plan A was to have Felkin acknowledge Mathers as the Chief and in return he would receive the newly typed @=[3] and (])==@] rituals that Mathers had worked on. But Brodie-Innes hinted that he was under no pledge to Mathers and could overthrow him ifF elkin desired. Plan B was fo r Felkin to be the Supreme Chief, but that would only work ifhe had more mate­rial on offer than Mathers. Felkin said he had material, but it was not worked into the Golden Dawn system and most of it was in German. Felkin's Sun Masters had warned him years before against work­ing with Mathers, so he declined. Brodie-Innes decided to abandon Felkin completely and resigned from the SteUa Ma tutina. Crucially, Mathers had given him the title of Deputy .Archon Barilew in the United Kingdom. Not wishing to give up his plans of a united order, he of­fe red Felkin the advanced Theoricus Adeptus Minor papers, which the Stella Matutina did not have. All Felkin had to do was acknowledge Mathers as his Chief and Brodie-Innes as his Chief Adept. Needless to say, Felkin again declined. Instead, in 1914 Felkin completed his own @=(3] and(])==@] rituals based on a development of the @=ffi] Golden Dawn rite. W.B. Yeats went through the @=[3] rite in October 1914.

If Mathers fo und out that he had been helping Felkin and his rebels, he might have been in considerable trouble.

He probably obtained these additional qualifications via the Society of Apothecaries, which would then have enabled him to register with the General Medical Council and practice as a doctor without having done a fo rmal medical degree. His magical motto is the motto of the city ofEdinburgh and means \"Except the Lord in Vain.\" This is probably a heraldic contraction of a verse from the 127th Psalm: \"Except the Lord build the house, They labour in vain that build it. Except the Lord keep the city, The watchman waketh but in vain,\" which is also a key phrase from the Golden Dawn's Zelator ritual. He was not the only person to use this motto. R. A. Gilbert, in his book Th e Golden Dawn Companion, mentions that there was a Lucy Margaret Bruce with the magical motto Niri Dominu1 FrUJtra. However, she was initiated in 1907 into the Stella r Matutina. As the name on the front of the notebooks is H. D. Kelf, and as these notebooks go back to a time before Lucy's initiation in 1907, it would seem that these two individuals just happened to have the same magical motto. This is not as unlikely as it may seem, fo r in the early days of the Golden Dawn, magical mottos were often derived from heraldic mottoes, or those of a city with which they had strong ties. Death records reveal that Kelf died on the 2)th October 19)1 at the age of 76. At the time he was living on Sandbanks Road in Poole with his wife, Clara Louisa. This was just a short bus journey away from Doreen Valiente, who at that time, was living in Bournemouth. The documents fell into her hands and from there into Gerald Gardner's witch museum.

Mathers had written a new ritual fo r the consecration of the temple which had involved the bowing before a statue oflsis. This consecration ritual was fo r that of the Outer Order only and did not pertain to any Second Order workings, which in any event had not been done in Berridge's temple since 1910.

He claimed he used to visit her continually and they had astral sex resulting in the birth of three spirit children. It was this pair who also complained that the temple robes were in a bad state and \"the furnishings themselves verminous.\" If DeBathe and Brasche are to be believed this could show that the temple was run down and in a poor state of moral and physical hygiene. However, it seems more likely that they wanted to impress Waite following their exit from the temple. Waite was clearly amused, but seems to have heard no more from Berridge or his temple. He thought it had petered out before the War. Material once owned, and now lost, by the occult writer Francis King, shows that the temple was not even close to petering out.

They may have been tapping Brodie-Innes's .AO fo r cash, but it could not have been much. After the war, 22 million people died from what was then dubbed \"Spanish Flu.\" In fact, it was a strain ofbird flu which had mutated and jumped into humans to devastating effect. Soldiers returning from the various fr onts effectively spread the illness throughout the world. One of the people it seems to have killed was Mathers, who died at midnight in his apartment in the Rue Rivera on 20 November 20 1918. The well-known occult writer, Dion Fortune, was certain the death was caused by this disease. However, there is no cause of death on the death certificate. For many years it was assumed that Mathers did not even have a grave, leading one particularly daft Golden Dawn order to speculate that he had faked his death after obtaining immortality. His grave was eventually fo und, in Paris, where you would have expected to spot it. No-one has opened the coffin yet to find a dead Mathers, so the immortality theory apparently still holds. The one person who could have answered everyone's questions was developing a cult of personality around Mathers' death and was saying little. Mina Mathers not only kept Mathers' cause of death a secret from the rest of the Order, she claimed that it had nothing to do with flu. But, rather, had been caused by exhaustion from years of work with the Secret Chiefs of the Third Order. On 12 December 1918, Mina claimed that her husband remained conscious to the end and had bequeathed his order to Mina, Brodie­Innes and Berridge. They should, he requested, see that the tradition would always be observed.\" Mathers apparently decreed that Brodie­Innes would be his replacement as the Supreme Chief of the Order. In 1921 Mina would read a message which she claimed was from Mathers to his Order dictated by him on the night he died. In that Mathers wanted everyone to continue their work as if he was still there. She claimed that he believed he would guide and protect mem­hers from the Spiritual Plane. Considering that the letter was delivered three years late, one has to question it if was less Mathers and more his wife's statement ofintent. • The desire to see that \"the tradition is always observed\" is often the catchcry of a successor who is out of his depth and cannot find something new to do.

J. W. Brodie-lnneJ As R.A. Gilbert pointed out, the comments about Mathers being a \"hot headed highlander\" were \"utter mendacity,\" as Brodie­Innes knew that his friend had not a drop of Scottish blood in him. Although Mathers did leave Brodie-Innes in charge in his final address to the .AO, it did not play out that way. Moina was financially dependent on the limited revenue generated by the .AO. She took"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"1)0 K.fNG OVEJ{fhe W.A TEI( the title of External Head of the .AO, which was Mathers' old title. All sections of the .AO, including Brodie-Innes, acknowledged this, though Brodie-Innes was apparently regarded as External Head fo r Scotia. As part of a power sharing compromise Mina became Grand Imperatrix of the .AO, Brodie-Innes became Grand Praemonstrator and Berridge became Grand Cancellarius. Verification of this can be fo und in the letters exchanged by American .AO members with Mina and Brodie-Innes. It is not clear why Brodie-Innes acquiesced, though it is likely that he was too much of a gentleman to push his claim against Mina or he lacked over-all support from within the .AO. Perhaps his days of leading a schism against a Mathers were simply over. When Violet Firth, who took the pen name Dion Fortune, joined the.AO just after the War she was under the impression that she had joined a Scottish Branch of the Order in London which was run by Brodie-Innes and Tranchell-Hayes. This was the sub-branch of the Amen-Ra temple established by Brodie-Innes in London during the War. She does not mention Dr. Berridge and presumably did not meet him. Although Mina Mathers was alive when she joined, Firth was not aware of a connection to the King over the Water and saw her group as independent - and in a practical sense it was. While the young Violet was enthusiastic about the Order's teaching, she could not fail to note that her branch was manned primarily by women \"and grey bearded ancients.\" Within a relatively short time she transferred her membership to a temple run directly by Mina Mathers. In 1919 Mina had returned from Paris and revived the .AO Isis­Urania Temple #3 in London, in cooperation with Dr. Berridge and Isabel Morgan Boyd. Boyd was to assist Mina with her earthly needs fo r the remainder of her lif e. Despite his inclusion in Mathers' last will and testament Dr. Berridge's own health may have been failing. He died on 13 May 1920 at age 77· Following Berridge's death Mina remained Imperatrix, Isabel Boyd was Praemonstratrix and Edward John Langford Gars tin became Cancellarius. Meanwhile, Brodie-Innes continued his sub­temple of Amen-Ra in London. When looking back upon these times Dion Fortune notes in her article Ceremonial Magic Vnveiled Qanuary 1933) that Mrs. MacGregor Mathers' .AO temple \"claimed the only orthodoxy\" among the London temples. But Brodie-Innes never renounced his claim and entitlement (or Apostolic Succession,"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"NJCJ(F.Al(R§LL 1)1 as it were) as Mathers' successor in the AO and would later pass it on to Dr. Carnegie Dickson. Brodie-Innes died on 8 December 1923 at the age of 78. A5 it turned out, thanks to Brodie-Innes, after 1923 there were two.AOs that hardly spoke to one another. Under Carnegie-Dickson, who, during the 192os, was acknowledged as an over-all Chief by the surviving British temples of the Stella Matuti'na, the two orders became one again. Dr. Carnegie-Dickson continued to enjoy a cordial working relationship with both Doctor and later Mrs. Felkin throughout his long life. However, as the higher grade workings of the AO and the Whare Rg were quite different, and acknowledging political and geographic realities, Mrs. Felkin withdrew the \\Vhare Rg temple from the Stella Matutina a few years afi:er her husband's passing. Despite the political shuffling in Great Britain, Whare R.g continued to be looked upon as the \"Mother Temple\" till it closed in 1978. In 192o, Westcott immigrated to the Republic of South Mrica to live with his daughter and son-in-law in Durban. The last fo unding chief of the Order of the Golden Dawn died of Bright's Disease in 192;. Westcott/ Grave i?1 Durban Mina was alone and was not particularly confident in her role as the head of the Order. She did try to make some fo rm of contact with the Inner Planes, and probably her husband, using a medium. There are several additional AO papers based around the Golden Dawn tradition that were written by Mina, probably inspired by this connection. One involved re-arranging the godforms within the elemental grades. According to Pat Zalewski, Mina was teaching the"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"KJNG Of/EJ{fhe W.A TEJ( Indian idea of Chakras or energy centers in connection with ritual. Her student and fellow chief Langford Gars tin wrote his alchemical book Secret Fire based on this theory while Mina was alive, although it was not published until two years after her death. \\Vhile she was capable of providing the .AO with new material, Mina's insecurity was causing more problems fo r the Order. Thanks to her mediumistic gifts and her fo rmer association with Tranchell-Hayes, the young Deo No n Fo rtuna (Dion Fortune) soon began to make life difficult fo r Mina. While still a junior member of Mina's temple, Fortune continued her medium sessions, which had began earlier under Tranchell-Hayes' guidance. Now however, they were continued in association with non Order members and without Mina's knowledge. Much of this teaching was collected and published under the title of The Esotmc Philosophy of Love and Marriage (1924). Mina was fu rious. The book included teaching which, Mina believed, was only available to the Inner Order of the .AO. The book related to polarity and sex and there was none of this in the Golden Dawn corpus. As Fortune later narrated in her Ceremonial Magzc Vnveiled: She nearly tumed me out for writing the Esoteric Philosophy of Love and Ma rriage� 011 the ground.r that I wa.r betraying the in11er teaching of the Order, but it wa.r poi11ted out to her that I had 110t thm got the degree in wluch that teaching wa.r givm� and I wa.r pardoned. She m.rpended me for some months for writing Sane Occu!ti.rm and finally tumed me out becau.re certain.rymbol.r had not app eared in my aura - a pnfectly unanswera ble charge. Fortune thought this latter point was mad and took it personally. \\Vhat Fortune didn't know at the time was that, under the GD tradi­tion, when someone is initiated into an order, symbols are burnt into their aura and are visible clairvoyantly. Fortune hints that Tranchell­Hayes fo rmed a secret group of which she was part. Mina must have suspected that the group existed and disapproved. IfTranchell-Hayes was running a secret group and Fortune was a member, Mina might be saying she could see the evidence of this in her Sphere ofSensation. Throughout her suspension Fortune carried on working with T ranch ell-Hayes and decided to fo rm a group ofher own. During her time in the .AO Fortune had fo rmed a group to act as an outer court with the intent of attracting new members. Mina had approved of"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"NICJ(FAI(R,§LL l)j this idea initially. After her expulsion, Fortune carried on this group, which eventuated into the Fra temity of the Inner Light. Another person to suffer at the hands of Mina was the North American Paul Foster-Case. Case had joined the Thoth-Hermes temple oftheAO in 1918 and rapidly shot up the hierarchy. Paul Case's first occult fas cination was with the Tarot, which he had studied fo r a number of years prior to joining theAO. While still in the Outer Order Paul was in correspondence with Brodie-Innes, Grand Praemonstrator of the A 0, in matters pertaining to the Tarot. Brodie-Innes, a strict believer in the traditional Golden Dawn sequence of studies, declined to tell him much as he was not yet a member of the Second Order. However, he did encourage Paul to pursue his Outer Order studies and apply fo r membership in the Second Order as quickly as consistent with Order requirements. He was initiated into the Second Order on 16 May 1920 and almost immediately made sub-Praemonstrator under Michael Whitty. He was to succeed Whitty as Praemonstrator within a year. However, Case seemed to have a fe w ofhis own ideas in regards to esoteric information. The first was he started discussing the topic of sex magiC. In 1920 Mina wrote to him to warn him off the subject, telling him that it had done a lot of damage to several groups with which she had been involved. She also told Case to be careful about the personal rela­tionship he was developing with Lilli Geise, who was a Hierophantria of the temple. Mina seemed to think that Case was facing many of the issues that she had as a result of her involvement with the occult. She had sacrificed her art, and Case, a professional pianist who played the musical accompaniment fo r silent movies and stage shows, underwent a similar career curtailment as a result of his new duties at Thach­Hennes. On 18 July she told him that he had reached a crossroads in his life. The artirt in you, which I recogpi'{!, and with whom I deeply sym ­path ire, would probably choose to !ea m the Tru th through the joy and beauty ofphysica! lift.

It is likely that as these events unfolded Case recalled a chance meeting that occurred about 190) in Chicago. He was approached on the street by someone who knew his name and told him that he had to choose between a life of material comfort as a musician and a life of suffering and renunciation as a vitally needed teacher of the Mysteries. This man promised that if he stopped his musical career \"in the end, you will not starve to death.\" Given state ofMina Mathers at the time and her ultimate fate, Case might have thought twice about promises by strange blokes in parks. Instead he abandoned his musical career and established the BOT .A in 1922. Geise wrote to Mina saying that she might have killed one of the fe w draw cards that the.AO temple had by getting rid ofCase. Apparently, students from other US temples were flocking to hear Case speak. Geise, whom Case later married, may have been a bit biased, but Elma Dame, the Imperatrix of the Philadelphia tem­ple, agreed. She told Mina, \"When you got rid ofMr. Case, you killed the goose that laid the golden egg.\" Case's involvement with the .AO stayed with him fo r the rest of his life and clearly influenced his teaching. When under pressure to produce rituals fo r a practical side ofhis Builders of the .Adytum order, he rewrote the@=@, Equinox and CD=={!Q] ofthe.AO from memory using Crowley's The Equinox as a guide. He made some minor changes and presented it as his own.* He would later claim his order had replaced the Golden Dawn and the.AO. If you removed the Enochian from of the Golden Dawn rituals, specialised its training so that it emphasised Tarot, added a bit of .AO spiritual alchemy and energy work, you would have Builder� of the .Adytum. His version of the .AO managed to survive relatively unscathed until the turn of the 2oth Century, when it fragmented badly.

She was without an income and had unsuccessfully tried to salvage her art career by portrait painting. Her husband, who could not have been an easy man to live with, was gone and she lacked any real control in her life. Although the illness had not been identified at the time, it is possible she developed an eating disorder which is com­mon with people who are clinically depressed. It may be an attempt to maintain control over the physical body when all other controls prove impossible. Some of the symptoms of anorexia are mood swings and depression, which other reports ofMina's behaviour support. In 1928 she suffered a complete breakdown and stopped eating. She died in St. Mary Abbott's Hospital on 2) July 1928, leaving her entire worldly estate, worth a paltry 190 pounds qs 2d, to her brother Philipe.

The temple used to mostly meet in the upstairs of Boyd's Chelsea home, although at various points in the group's history it would meet in rented rooms. Boyd is the woman described by Ithell Colquhoun in her book Sword of Wisdom as Mrs. Weir. According to Colquhoun, Boyd was a woman who lacked irony and had a harsh voice, yet was extremely graceful. Colquhoun was the cousin of Edward John Langford-Garstin, who was chief of the A 0. She was introduced to the Boyds some time before the Second World War. While Colquhoun asked to join the AO, she was rejected by Isabel Boyd, who did not like her. Boyd apparently did not like women and prefered to surround herself with men, and it seems that she had total seniority on the group's membership. At the time Colquhoun had no idea why she had been rejected, and she created an elaborate story about her being tested by some Secret Chiefs before being shown the door. Later she admitted that she did not know that everyone was rejected the first time and they simply needed to apply again.

With the death of Mina there no longer existed a connection between the .AO and its GD past. Although the occasional contact between the .AO and the Stella Matuti'na continued, it was fairly ad hoc. Tranchell-Hayes made contact and continued to work with Dion Fortune until the Second World War, but otherwise the Golden Dawn off-shoots managed to keep a low profile. Low that is until the appearance in print of the early works oflsrael Regardie. Regardie was born Francis Israel Regudy in London on 17 No­vember 1907 at 6:10am. Raised in the United States, he studied Kab­balah with a Hebrew tutor and joined the Washington, DC College of the Soci'eta.r R.yi'cruci'ana i'n .Ammca, which was operating under a some­what dubious Golden Dawn warrant signed by Westcott. In a rebuttal to Waite, the Society's Supreme Magus, George Winslow Plummer, was later to state that the American SJ?lA did not descend, but had in fact ascended fr om, the English Society. At this time the Society used rituals composed of a curious mix of Masonic Rosicrucian and .AO material. Plummer, who produced the rituals, had obtained the fo r­mer from Sylverster C. Gould and the latter from Crowley. Regardie progressed through the @={Q] and CD=UQJ degrees in this organisa­tion, but in 1928 he travelled to Paris to become the unpaid secretary of Crowley. He stayed with him fo r three years, picking up scraps of occult information, usually by reading. Regardie would later say that the Beast taught him very little, although his influence is clear in his earlier writings. One of the bones of contention between them was that Regardie refused to adopt Crowley's Thelemite religion, which he regarded as a product of the Great Beast's unconscious. In 1932, Regardie wrote two books. The first was titled The Tree of Life and the second, which at the time he believed was a represen­tation of Crowley's Kabbalah without Thelema, was tiltled Garden of Pome!!anates. This he suspected was the teaching of the Golden Dawn. Since he thought that the Order had been defunct since Crowley left it, he mentioned the Order by name. It was the first time that the name Golden Dawn and its teachings had been mentioned and analysed in a book. Garstin was furious and immediately dashed off a letter to Regardie demanding that he no longer use the Golden Dawn name. Dion Fortune took the opposite view in an article fo r the Occult J?.tvi'ew"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"NICI(FAJ(.R.§LL 1)7 and praised the books. However, she said that Regardie was wrong when he considered the Golden Dawn defunct. It ha.r broken up in to scattered units of varying degrees of efficiency, but I know of four fu nctioning Lodges all of which have got the full set of rites and teaching; and there are quite likely to be others of which I do not know. She said that whoever could work the system of the Golden Dawn in such a manner as to pick up the Secret Chiefs need not worry about the \"trespassers will be prosecuted\" boards \"put up on the physical plane by persons not altogether disinterested.\" Garstin followed up with a defence of secrecy in esoteric orders. The heads of the Stella Matutina wrote a letter to Garstin, agreeing with him and another to Dion Fortune supporting her view. Unfor­tunately they put them in the wrong envelopes and Fortune ended up with Garstin's letter. Shortly thereafter Regardie, who was already in touch with For­tune, received a letter from her dated 13 December 1932. In this letter Fortune indicated her knowledge of an upcoming meeting between Regardie and a Miss Hughes of Bristol. Since it was fa irly obvious that the .A 0 would not be interested in Regardie, because ofhis publication of the two books, even if its Oath would guarantee that he shut up, she encouraged him to keep his appointment with Miss Hughes. It is of interest to note that she was not explicit as to its exact nature. As a result of this meeting, Regardie was invited to become a member of the Hermes Temple of the Stella Matutina. Bristol appears to have bent the rules fo r Regardie and al­lowed him to progress in the Order a lot faster than it normally would, and certainly much quicker than other initiates: Regardie said that the Bristol temple was terrible, with the \"inepti,\" as he called them, unable to do much with the system. \"' Many years ago I believed that to fit that number of grades into the time that Bristol insisted fr om others was impossible because the temple did not meet in Winter and never bent the rules on the periods that person had to wait before taking another grade. To remedy this problem, I assumed that they had ac­cepted his earlier grades on SocRos(Am). However, correspondence dated De­cember 1932 clearly invited him to receive his \"vaccination\" during the weekend of 6-10 January 1933 in the Bristol temple. \"Vaccination\" was the code word used by the Bristol temple members fo r the o=o Initiation. It is repeated as such by Regardie in My R.£sicrucian .Advmture."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"l(!NG Of/El\\Jhe WA TEI( During his G:l=[K] ritual one of the officers performed the deep­ly moving rite so badly that he might as well have been reciting his shopping list. He was also shocked that none of the members knew how to play Enochian chess and that they tended to with­hold papers that they fa iled to understand. Regardie once cl aimed that the chiefs of the Bristol temple wanted him to return to the United States to fo rm a daughter temple there. This did not tally with Gilbert's research. Apparendy, the chiefs wanted Regardie to leave and it is a moot point as to whether he simply resigned, left or was \"asked to leave.\" Coming to the conclusion that the Stella Matuti7la was fast becoming dormant, he felt that by publishing its rituals he might save the huge body of teaching fo r fu rther generations. His efforts in this regard were blocked in England by A.E. \\Vaite, who curiously was planning an identical venture himself Regarclie subsequendy moved back to America and published the majority of Rites and Rituals of the Hermetic Order of Golden Dawn. The first volume appeared in 1937. His antagonism towards \\Vaite remained with him fo r much ofhis life. Regardie was attacked by all his former friends, including Paul Foster Case and Dion Fortune, fo r publishing the Golden Dawn material. Then we come to another myth about the Golden Dawn. For years it was believed that the publication of Regardie's book killed off the Order by making its rituals public. But this was rubbish, as Regarclie's book was not a best seller. In fact, it languished on the book shelves fo r years and only became well known in the 196os when it was given a popular reprint by Llewellyn. In any case, the publication of the rituals would have made no difference to the AO as they had an escape clause that Regarclie had published the rituals of an order called the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Also what he had published were cut down versions of the Stella Matuti7la, fr om which theAO was several stages removed. TheAO Isis-Urania Chiefs closed down their temple when World \\Var Two broke out. During the War, and the Blitz in particular, it was not practical to carry on working in London. Garstin was recalled to military service so the Order would have been without its Cancellerious.

The three chiefs gathered together the .AO equipment and papers and made a bonfire of the lot at Boyd's daughter's Hertfordshire house.· This explains why after the War there did not appear to be any attempt to rekindle the .AO. Garston, whose second wife had run off with an American soldier, along with everything other than his library and magical equipment, was suffering extreme fincancial hardship. After a long history of poor business decisions, he had a final roll of the dice and set up the Anglo-Brazilian Trade Company, which also fa iled. He fast ran out of money and had to sell his occult book collection to \\Vatkins. Boyd helped him out financially once, but he either declined or was refused future help. According to Colquhoun, he stayed with an esoterically minded fr iend fo r a while before taking a drugs overdose. When Boyd heard about his suicide she asked the fr iend to destroy all of his magical equipment. The Bristol temple and the .AO Section headed by Carnegie Diskson, with which it was allied, started to splutter in the 19)0S and stopped initiating people in the 196os. Neither was never fo rmally closed and the last chief died in the 197os.

The amount of material and historical information that would have been destroyed in both bonfires is tragic to modern Golden Dawn researchers. It seems that whenever a branch of the Golden Dawn ends, it has to be burnt. In the case of both blazes it means that the Chiefs of those Orders did not intend their groups to continue. Thus there can be no legitimate orders which can claim they have a right to reform Wh are R.g or the Mathers' .AO, as the Secret and Temporal Chiefs demanded both groups be closed.

The carved ivory figure is of antique Florentine workmanship; and the carved Rose of 2) petals behind the head was made fo r this purpose in Venice. The colours represent the interchanging energies of the Spirit and the Elements. The figure of Christ surrounded by the fo ur elements symbolises the perfect Adept who has so balanced his elemental nature that the Divine Spirit can manifest in him. The cup, dagger, chain and the burning lap, each standing on its own element simply repeat the same symbolism. It should be observed that the fo ur elements are placed according to the Zodiac; that is to say the fire, Leo = Aries is to the East, Air, Aquarius = Libra to the West; Water, Scorpio = Cancer to the North; Earth, Taurus = Capricorn to the South. This is the direction of the Enochian Tablets to the Elements and points to that in which the Adept should look when he wishes to visit the elemental realms or Astral regions. For a planet it is better to find the actual position fr om an Ephemeris in actual work.

This information is given in the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram but in so confused fo rm that it is difficult to comprehend it clearly. The separate clairvoyant study of the four circles on the Tomb Altar is extremely interesting; by it the fo rces of the elements on the active side can be observed symbolically and contrasted with the same on the passive side, as seen in the simple Tatwas. Instead ofholding a paper symbol the Adept can sit in the Tomb and feel himself pass through the selected disc, having first invoked the Divine Names and used a suitable Pentagram. By simply using the pentagram and vibrating the Divine Name allotted to it, the blackness of the atmosphere of the Tomb can become so charged with the astral colour of the Element that it seems visible to the material eyesight. It is necessary to balance the people sitting in the Tomb. The most practised could take the place at the head of the Pastas with the beginners on either side; but when only two are working together they should sit opposite each other at the sides or at the head and fo ot of the Pastas.

The date of the Book of the Tomb, 1921, suggests the period when J.W. Brodie-Innes was in charge of the Order, along with Mina Mathers, after the latter had taken over Berridge's London temple. The original papers were written by Mathers, while the Flying Roll was written by Westcott. Other papers in this book are written by Brodie-Innes. The style is more modern and clearer, and it makes a reference to the Amon-Ra temple Vault, which was Brodie-Innes's own temple. It is unlikely that Brodie-Innes or Mina Mathers would have changed anything written by Mathers. It is clear here that although Mathers came up with the original idea, the intellectual explanation ofit was left to Westcott. Sadly, when writing this book, it is impossible to show how the colours of a Vault worked by providing some examples. There are very few Vaults which have been built and those that have appear to have ignored the Book of the Tomb. For example, the Vault of Wh are R.g appears to have used a slightly different colour system from the Book of the Tomb. The method used resulted in a Vault which was much darker than oth­ers I have seen. More than one of the Wh are R.g Adepts felt that it was too dark and seemed to have something nasty attached to it. \\Vhether or not this was to do with the colours or whether it was the fact that someone had tried to do negative magic in the Vault is unclear. One Adept, who was initiated in the 197os, told me that"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"KJNGOVER.Jhe W.A TEI( as she emerged from the Vault she had an incredible anger and wanted to destroy it. She said she never went back. Other Vaults, which are based on misreading Regardie, have been created using flashing colours, something which Westcott apparently approved ofin the fo otnotes of the Book ofthe Tomb. This was apparently used in the Amen-Ra temple in Edinburgh. This method involves creating the ground colour by mixing the base wall with the planetary colours and then painting the letter in the corresponding flashing colour. This would give you a wall where everything flashes. The logic is that the flashing colour will activate the colour on the panel and bring its energy into the temple. But there are some side effects to this. My first teacher was initiated into a Stella Matuti11a offshoot in London in the 197os and he moaned that the Vault made you feel sick after a fe w minutes and you could not look at the walls after a while. He would have had a point, because not only are all the sigils shouting at you they are also broadcasting all their energy at a higher pitch. They are also missing the subtlety of the method used by creating the walls using the Book ofthe Tomb. Ifbuilt the way that was originally suggested you would only see some parts of the wall flash. While the energies of the wall are still there, they will create a lower energy. The squares that do flash will be those which are meant to be active. It is surprising that Westcott did not spot this. It is possible that he felt that having made the effort ofbuilding the Vault, Amon-Ra should not have to rebuild it, and felt it was ok to keep. Again this is an example of political expediency over magical results. The mixing shows us how these energies work to affect the various parts of the Kabbalah, the other planets, etc. Say, fo r example, we were travelling in Yesod. The purples suddenly give way to a more yellow purple and we know that we are exploring the territory more intellectually. Likewise if we find something needs to be managed in a chosen sphere, we can transform the colours of that environment to tune them to what we want. The original Vault fo r the Isis-Urania temple was built out of canvas fr ames, much like a stage set. The door of the temple was either a separate curtain or another canvas frame which was on a hinge. Later, proper purpose built wooden Vaults were added, which were permanent with wooden walls. But it is not clear if these types ofVaults were used in Bristol or even Berridge's Isis temple. I have seen two"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"NICJ(F.Al(R.§LL permanent wooden Vaults which were made using the same fo rmula from the Book of the Tomb. The first was Chic Cicero's Vault, which can only be described as stunning. Chic has spent a long time getting his Vault correct, often repainting bits that he fe els were not quite right. It has been a lifetime labour of love. He considered the creation of the Vault as being part of the true understanding of the Path of the Carnelian or the magic of colour. The second temple was built by a student of Chic's. Builders of the .Adytum made their Vault walls from ping-pong tables which are exactly eight by five fe et. Paul Foster Case was apparently unhappy about starting a second order within BOTA which taught practical magic, but while he was away from his tem­ple, his students built a Vault fo r him. He then came around to the idea ofhaving a G)=lli] grade within his order. In the Magical Order of the .Aurora .Aurea, we agonised over what the best approach fo ra Vault would be. We hadnoroomfo rawooden Vault, which had to be set up full time, so it had to be portable. We turned to new technology to help us overcome the problem. We created the Vault on the computer using Photoshop and took these huge files to a printer who made tents fo r trade exhibitions. The floor was made of special vinyl which could take fo ot traffic and the roof used a type of semi-transparent plastic which took outside light and distributed throughout the space. The walls were stuck to an aluminium frame using velcro. It was then lit by a single spotlight above the Vault. It is fully portable and can break down to fit in the back of a small car. Crucial to this process was creating the files in the correct colour on the computer. This is trickier than it appears, as the computer builds files using light (RBG), while a printer uses ink (CYMK). Photoshop has fu nctions that convert one to the other, but this sometimes changes some of the tints. For our Vault I built a base colour wall, duplicated this seven times and then stuck a 20 per cent transparency fo r each of the seven planets over them. I then did each letter in the correct complementary and placed an identical 20 per cent transparency over that. Photoshop effectively mixed the colours with an accuracy which many artists would find difficult. I decided not to fu dge or increase the mix of the colours where I thought it would make it look nicer or help the colours stand out. The result was"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"186 I<JNG 0 f/ERJhe W.A TER..., a Vault which was as close to the ideas of the Book of the Tomb as possible. The right colours on the wall flash, but the walls do not dramatically change colour from the base wall. That is not the same as saying they do not change, but the result is not as extreme as the Whare R.g wall. The Magical Order of .Aurora .Aurea was not the first to attempt this method, as I swapped a few notes with a group in Canada which were trying a similar approach. The designer there felt it was important to get as many colours flashing as possible, sometimes changing the transparencies by as much as 40 percent. He said that he noticed that whoever had painted the Isis-Urania temple had done something similar. His Vault is beautiful and has more purple and pink than ours. Magical Order of the .Aurora .Aurea Vault wall dun'11g a.mmbly. What is interesting is that each Vault is unique to the order or the temple that built it because it is built on the understanding of the adept who created the group. This is im portant when you consider that each Golden Dawn group is a different lamp fo r the light, just as each person is a different expression. There are probably no right or wrong Vault s, unless the people really have departed completely from the Book of the Tomb. Subtle differences in tuning are no different from the subtle differences of personality. One of the more important questions about the Vault is: where did it come from? The obvious answer is that it came from the Rosicrucian manifestos. But that was not the case. In the Fa ma Fraternitatir, the"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"NICJ(F.Al(R.§LL Vault described is \"a Vault of seven sides and corners, every side five fo ot broad, and the height of eight fo ot,\" and there was a round altar with the same images on them, but there were some noticeable differences. In the Fama the walls \"have ten squares, every one with their several figures and sentences.\" Every square had a door fo r a chest, \"wherein there lay diverse things, especially all our books.\" So there are ten squares and not 40 and there is no mention of colour. The floor and ceiling are close to the idea of the Golden Dawn: Th e bottom aga in ii parted in the triangle, but becawe therein ii du ­cribed the power and role of the inferior Govemor1, we leave to mani­fest the same, for ftar of the abwe by the evil and ungodly world. But thOJe that are provided and stored with the heavenly .Antzdote, they do without fear or hurt, tread on, and broue the head of the old and evil 1erpent, which thu our age ii well fitted for. But the Vault of CRC was not meant to be built, nor was it meant to be used magically by the Golden Dawn. The period immediately before the writing of the Fa ma, the Renaissance, was a period were Greek and Roman ideas were being incorporated into the mindset of the European intelligentsia. Amongst these were the writings of Cicero and Pliny, who advocated the use of a symbolic method to enhance memory. The method was first codified by Simonides of Ceos (n6BC - 468BC) and was summed up in a 4th Century fragment known as Dialexei.J: If you pay attention you will be able to 1ee thingJ better. Rtpeat aga i1z what you hear, for by hearing and Jaying the Jame thz1z!!J what you have leamed ii easier to remember. 1¥hat you hear, place on what you know. In other words, if you want to remember that Aj ax was a sol­dier in the Trojan War, you would imagine him standing next to a statue of Mars in a room in your bathroom cleaning the bath with a big map of Greece in the background. You would remem­ber to put all Aj ax's soldiers in the bathroom. So if you were going through a speech you would mentally walk through yo ur house until you got to the bathroom. In your mind's eye you would see a soldier cleaning the bath, remember Aj ax, see the map of Greece"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"188 KJNG OYER.Jhe W.A TEJ( and remember he was on the Greek side of the Trojan War. The Greeks and Romans needed to codify things better and cover the long lists needed to remember their speeches. They already had a list of gods, who were attributed to the different planets. In memory terms, all they had to do was see a statue of the god and then they would immediately think of the planet. Cronos (Saturn) would be a link to words like death, time, inheritance and blackness, while Zeus (Jupiter) would connect to things like rulership, wealth and purple. The net widened to include the zodiacal attributions. This meant that if they were making a speech about war with the Persians, they would use a magical image of a statue of Mars with the various points of their speech being placed around it. One of the important aspects of this technique was the idea of having a place which would be visited in the imagination. These places, and the symbols contained in them, became a shorthand to different meanings. This was a side effect of using this type of system. People using it started to have new realisations about their subject. This side effect was noted and explained by the philosophers Plato and Aristotle. Both considered obtaining knowledge as simply recovering (or remembering) information that had been fo rgotten when we were born and fe ll from our perfected state in the higher realms of existence. So when people were using these memory systems it was no surprise that they \"remembered\" something else about the subject at the same time. \\Vhile this might be true, it is more likely that the meditation on symbols causes the mind to fo cus and invent new ideas. Either way, it was perfectly reasonable then that \"memory sys­tems\" could be used to teach by bringing new information to the con­scious mind of the practitioner. This is particularly important when you consider that contemplating some symbols led to information which many considered esoteric to be remembered by the person us­ing the system. The allegory of the discovery of the Vault is designed to reveal by meditation esoteric knowledge which was not only buried by the writers, but to help remember new information. The Vault itself was a memory place, which was supposed to contain all the wisdom that Christian Rosenkreuz could provide. What then becomes crucial to the story is how the would-be Rosicrucian finds that Vault and"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"NICJ(FAJ(R.f:LL connects to it. Mathers, or Raphael, was using the allegory, but had created something unique. The next question was whether or not Mathers or Westcott understood what they had, and it is fairly clear that they did not, judging by the way they treated the material. Westcott could not have approved of the Amon-Ra Vault ifhe understood the implications of a fully flashing Vault. · Mathers would not have needed Westcott to write most of the Vault material if he had understood it either. \\Vhat is seen in the Book of the Tomb is that Mathers had a vision of the entire Golden Dawn system encapsulated within the Vault of CRC, but \\Vestcott translated the vision into something meaningful. Westcott complained that fe w people understood why some squares were the same as others, but in all the papers he wrote about the Vault there are none which tell you about its fu nction. Any practical occultist reading about the Vault has to look at the Book of the Tomb and say, \"yes, this is all very interesting and pretty, but so what? How can I use this material?\" \\Vestcott suggests that you can pathwork into the various squares, which is certainly a start. But what he does not do is pick apart the symbolism to take you somewhere unique. Some of these places can be fo und by asking some questions like \"why are the Vault walls in the �e en Scale?\" By placing them in the �e en Scale it also suggest that you could build fo ur other Vaults which would take you different places using different colour scales. This would become important when you were looking at the higher grades, such as the Babe of the Abyss. T¥hare R.g realised that there was more to the Vault and came up with the idea of allowing the candidate to rise to the ®=[3] by entering the Mars wall. But equally the Walls could lead to other paths and spheres on the Tree of Life. \\Vhile working on the Magical Order of AuroraAurea Vault I twigged that the Vault contained a powerful fo rmula of creating coloured talis­mans which were tuned to more specific frequency. This could also be passed on to the manufacture of equipment and the creation of Tri­angles of the Art. It is also possible the Vault represents the creation of a different Body of Light fo r the Adept, which would allow them access to different and significant magical powers. While these are just * This is not a contradiction with what I have said before about each temple having a Vault of its own flavour.

Indeed, it is possible to argue a case that the unique magical system based around the Vault has never been fully explored. After working on the Vault, \\Vestcott dropped research on it completely and became more inter­ested in his system of placing the Elemental Watchtowers in a Cube. Mathers got on with his Isis rituals. \\Vhat I find interesting is that modern Golden Dawn groups either ignore the Vault completely, sometimes not even building one, or attempt to factor it out of their Second Order teachings.

Both gentlemen were familiar with Dee's and Kelly's occult pursuits and, in addition, Mathers' British Museum researches would have provided access to a number of Dee's manuscripts. Suitable Tablets were constructed fo r Temple use. As a final symbolic touch each Tablet was uniquely colored in accordance with its derived elemental attribution, a fe ature not present in the original Tablets. Therein, a black ground was used to represent the Element ofEarth, yellow fo r Air, blue fo r \\Vater and red fo r Fire. The colours selected fo r this purpose were not random. • Much as I would like to claim credit fo r this commentary, it was written by a member of another modern Golden Dawn based order who wishes to remain anonymous."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"200 1\\!NG OYERjhe WA TEJ( In a paper written fo r the SRIA, The Sy mbolism of the Fo ur Ancient.I, • Mathers had previously related the symbolism of these fo ur officers, the Ancients, by their fu nction and robe colors to the fo ur elements. Their robe colors and the elements they represent are identical to those selected fo r this purpose in the new Temple Tablets. It is evident that Mathers drew upon familiar tradition as an aid in the fo rmulation of his Tablets. However, it was soon apparent that the complex presentations of the new Order would require symbolic coloring beyond the domain of the elements. In the G.D. ceremonial ritual progression the initiate (sym­bolically) ascended the Q@alistic Tree of Life. Here other fo rces, Sephirotic and Planetary, were awakened in the sphere of the can­didate in addition to those of the elements. Again, the Cypher manuscript provided an outline fo r ritual procedure as well as sketches of appropriate Grade Sashes awarded to members upon successful entry into each Grade. A fu rther use of symbolic color was in the completion of the Sash designs. For this purpose Mathers fo cused on the Planetary attributions of the Sephiroth as the key to colouring the corresponding Sash Grade adornment. The results were as fo llows: CD=DQJ Red, (2)=[2] White, Q)=[B] Purple, Q)=[2] Green, G:l=ffil Yellow, ®=[3] Red, CD=[±] Blue. Again, his choice of color assignment was not capricious. Prior to his collaboration with Westcott and \\Voodman in the fo rmation of the G.D., Mathers pursued an active study of the magical Grimoire tradition. He published one text, The Greater JV.y of Solomon, in 1889 and proceeded to translate others into man­uscripts fo r private and Order use. Found within many of the texts of the Solomonic cycle of Grimoires are coloring schemes fo r use in Planetary workings, such as talismans and invocations. This assignment is remarkably consistent and can be summarized as fo llows: ?=Black, 4-=Blue, o\"=Red, O=Yellow, 9=Green, 9=multi­colored or Purple, '})=Silver or White.t In the Grimoires Earth was not assigned a color so Mathers selected Red, pr esumably be-111 Th e Sy mbolism of the 4 .Ancients, issued by the SRIA in 1888.

Toward the very end of 1891 Mathers completed a ceremony fo r the G>=ffil Grade of Adeptus Minor and the ritual accouterments fo r its execution. Anticipating fu ture needs fo r this new Grade and Order within the G.D. framework, (it had as its purpose the study and pursuit of practical magic) Mathers envisioned a Color Scale that encompassed the entire Tree ofLife in all Four Q@alistic \\Vorlds. The next practical step in the utilisation of color was the construction of a colored version of the Tree of Life diagram fo r use by the new G:l=ffil Adepti. The Minutum Mundum diagram, \"The Small Universe,\" was the end result. In the Minutum Mundum Mathers based his color associations on the \"Rainbow Scale of Colours,\" which is an observed effect of color when white light is passed through a prism. In Nature this occurs when sunlight is refracted through suspended water droplets resulting in a rainbow effect. In the same manner in which a rainbow is observed as being stretched above the Earth, Mathers envisioned the Paths leading fr om Malkuth to the Higher. An arrangement of the Hebrew letters assigned to these three Paths gives us n:Dp �heth. niDp is a Hebrew word fo r rainbow, a bow or bow shaped ob­ject, or an archer, and hence, by association, the name fo r the Sign of Sagittarius. In Genesis the Rainbow (ofPromise) was used as a sign to Noah that God would never again destroy the \\Vorld by water. For Mathers the presence ofniDp stretched above Malkuth was �alistic corroboration that his use of the symbolic Rainbow Scale of Colors (refracted light as through water) was correct. \"The characters ofNature with Thy Finger Thou hast traced; but none can read them unless he hath been taught in Thy school.\" Once again, Mathers' choice of color associations was far from random. • Genesis 1:25."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"202 KJNG Of/ERjhe W.A TEI( The basic explanation of the Mi1zutum Mundum diagram as given in the G)=ffi] Ritual was collected into an official document as part of the new G)=ffi] curriculum.

Its continued use can be seen in all the successor groups of the original Order, a trend that continues to the current day. This copy of the manuscript is important fo r its preservation of historic details relating to both the Order of the .A. O. and its teaching during an otherwise obscure decade of its existence. On the Title Page of the notebook containing R.£tual Wwe find that the date of the transcription was \"March 1908.\" It is also noted that the \"G.B. Frater Tenax\" owned the original from which this copy was made. Tenax, a rather unusual name for a motto, is Latin fo r \"grasping, stingy, clinging, frugal, and obstinate,\" from which we derive the English word \"tenacious.\" It was a Second Order motto ofDr. Edmund Berridge specifically designated fo r the CD=@] Grade of Adeptus Exemptus. The initials \"G[reatly] H[onoured]\" confirm the G)=@] designation. Dr. Berridge was Chief of the .A. O. Isis-Urania Temple #3 in London and presumably he selected \"Tenax\" personally. While there is little doubt that Berridge's choice of the motto was a token of his steadfast loyalty to Mathers it also brings to notice another side (stingy, frugal) ofDr. Berridge. More important is the preservation of this reference to an early claimant to the Grade of Adeptus Exemptus, which at this time could only have been bestowed in an honourary sense, supporting similar notices by Crowley in The Equinox and by others as well. There is no need to now expand on this review of the historical significance of the document, as it has been well covered elsewhere in this book.

Where in the 1Vfbba!ah 'Vnvei!ed Mathers was limited to the use of an English letter transliteration scheme fo r \"Hebrew script,\" JV..tua! W, which was a circulated manuscript loaned to the membership, allowed him to hand write the relevant Hebrew script. It is the implication that Mathers and Westcott expected their Adepti to be both familiar and comfortable with the Hebrew script, easily recognizing Divine and Angelic names as fo und throughout this document and capable of correctly transcribing the script. This is common sense, for a failure to correctly render Divine and Angelic names in more practical matters, such as talismans and Z2 practices, could lead to undesirable consequences. Although Ni.Ji provides a clue to Mathers' requirements of his Adepts, more importantly it provides insight into the future direction ofhis more advanced teachings. It is clear from this version of JV..tua! W that Mathers intended it as a first installment of instruction in the use of symbolic color. Such references as the \"First diagram of the Minutum Mundum,\" \"Section One,\" and \"The First Section of the Liber Hodos Chameleonis\" bears out this assumption. Clearly additional diagrams and teachings were to follow. Note that this portion of the Minutum Mundum was also designated \"The First Section of the Liber Hodos Chameleon is,\" undoubtedly because to Mathers this teaching was an integral part of what was represented by Frater Lux e Tm ebrir. A5 previously mentioned, the new diagram and its explanation were first presented to the Adept in the concluding portion of the G)===ffi] Ritual along with the customary explanation of the Temple and its ritualistic fu rnishings.

A final value of this document is that it provides us with another version of J?.t\"tuaa W fo r study. Reference was made in the foo tnotes of J?.t\"tuaa W to a confusion concerning the origin of the radices of blue, red and yellow. Frater Nisi originally wrote, \"i1Q�n (Chokmah) is the radix of Blue\", this in turn became: 10n Chmd i1C::m (Chokmah) i.r the radix of Blue ... It is likely that this alteration was made because the relation between Chokmah (which is assigned the color grey) and blue is obscure in this version of J?.t\"tuaa W. It is interesting that a Whare R.e version of the text, which is very similar in content to the Ni.ri version, has the same difficulty with regard to the three radices. The TVhare R.g version assigns the radices ofblue to Chesed, red to Geburah and yellow to Kether! It is evident that the word Kether was handwritten on a piece of paper and affixed over a word underneath, one longer than \"Kether.\" Beneath it was very likely typed the word \"TIPHAR.fiTH.\" A third version fo r comparison is that fo und in Regardie's The Golden Dawn. Curiously, this much later version correctly assigns the radix of blue to Chokmah, that of red to Binah and the radix of yellow to Kether. That this is the correct assignment is confirmed by the explanation of the Minutum Mundum in the text of the G>=ffil Ritual itself, as well as by alleviation of the awkwardness in wording present in the text when they are incorrectly assigned. The obvious question is: how did this confusion arise? A likely cause is the limited information concerning color fo und in the Minutum Mundum diagram and J?.t\"tual W, which is insufficient to demonstrate any clear interaction among the color scales. For example, it is now commonly understood that the Prince Color Scale is the blending of the King and Cl.!!_een Scales. Is this the only interaction? It is noted that Regardie includes a table of all fo ur Color Scales at the end ofhis version of J?.t\"tual W. Yet, apart from this table and a brief note on the Four Scales inserted on pages 192 and 193 ofhis text, his J?.t\"tual Wis nearly identical to the Ni.ri and Whare R.e versions - assignment of Radices aside.

Without the table included in the Regardie version, such meditational analysis would be extremely difficult. The final question becomes: from where did these tables of original information come? A manuscript in the possession ofFlorence Farr (Soror SSDD) and published by Darcy Kiintz in The Golden Dawn Court Ca rds • appears to provide an answer. In his introduction to this booklet, Anthony Fuller states that this previously unknown manuscript existed in three virtually identical versions, penned by Dr. Carnegie-Dickson, ].\\V.

It is apparent that this manuscript had very limited circulation and was ostensibly provided to those responsible fo r the Vault Pastos, which was colored using the additionalScales.t In addition, the organization of the information on color is not arranged by the 32 Paths, but rather divided into groupings by Sephiroth, Elements, etc. However it is clear that this information was subsequently arranged according to the 32 Paths by Crowley in his 777, and in Regardie's table!

I have compared it to the 192os .AO version and it is practically identical with some changes to the Order and the dia­grams. It is, however, very different from the published versions. Some of this might have been due to editing on the part of Israel Regardie. In some cases it clarified a few points, and in others it just made cuts. The most obvious differences are the diagrams and the inclusion of the Coptic. Z1, Z2 and Z3 are what made the Golden Dawn magical. Next to the Cypher Manuscript there is not a single bit of writing which is more crucial to an understanding of the Golden Dawn system of magic. Mathers appears to have obtained them from the Angel Raphael. If you believe that, or think he brought them from his unconscious, there is no doubt that he was not able to receive anything, or write that well, ever again.

The Banner of the East is thus explained in the Ceremony of the Portal of the Vault :-\"The field of the Banner of the East is White, the colour oflight and purity.

It is a symbol of tremendous Strength and Fortitude, and is a synthesis of the Office ofHIEREUS as regards the Temple, as op­posed to his Office as regards the Outer. For these reasons it should always be worn by Hiereus. The Banner of the \\Vest completes the symbols of HIEREUS. It is thus explained in the CD=(iill grade ofZELATOR: \"The White Triangle refers to the three Paths connecting Malkuth with the other Sephiroth; while the red cross is the Hidden Knowledge of the Divine Nature which is to be obtained through their aid. The Cross and Triangle together represent Life and Light.\" In addition to this explanation from the ZELATOR Grade, it represents eternally the possibility of Rescuing the Evil; but in it the TIPHARETH cross is placed within the White Triangle of the Supernals as thereby representing that Sacrifice is made only unto the Higher. The red Cross may be bordered with gold in this instance, to represent the Perfect Metal obtained in and through the Darkness of Putrefaction.

And therefore is the Banner of the West the symbol of Twilight as it were, the equation of Light and Darkness. The pole and the base are black, to represent that even in the Depths ofEvil can that symbol stand.

Let it not be moved or disturbed all those seven days; but not in the dark, save at night. Then let the operation as aforementioned be repeated over the curcurbite, and this process may be repeated altogether three times if the flashing light cometh not.

Thus standing, let him endeavour to hear the voice of the God or Goddess whom he or she representeth, (As in the case of the Imperator (or Imperatrix) ifhe or she speak.eth or acteth let it be in the likeness of the Great Goddess Nephthys.

As it is written, \"The Lightning lighteneth out of the East and shineth even unto the West, and so shall the coming of the Son ofMan be.\" The Candidate during the Ceremony is addressed as \"Child of Earth\" as representing the earthly or terrestrial nature of the Natural Man; he who cometh fo rward from the darkness of n!J?Q to endeavour to regain the Knowledge of the Light. And this is what is intimated by the speech of the Hegemon, because the Path of the Initiate is but as darkness and fo olishness to the Natural Man.

This being so done, the Kerux then, as the witness, demandeth authority from the Hierophant to admit the Candidate into the Hall ofTruth and Justice. The Hierophant, in granting the permission, sealeth the Candidate with a new name (his motto) which shall thus stand as his Title in the Hall ofTruth.

The Goddesses of the Scales immediately consecrate him as there fo r­mulating in the Candidate's Sphere ofSensation a vibration whose purpose is to bring into action the Operation of the Pillars in his Sphere of Sensation.

But even as there are 4 Pillars at the extremities of a Sphere when the 10 Sephiroth are projected therein in the fo rm of the Tree of Life (the Middle Pillar fo rming the axis of the said Sphere) so also are there fo ur separate consecrations of the Candidate, with Water and Fire, during the Ceremony of the Admission to the @=[Q] Grade ofNeophyte, and his Astral appearance at this juncture will be that of a fo rm wrapped in darkness as if extinguished thereby, and having unto his Right and unto his Left the faint semblance of the Two Great Pillars ofFire and of Cloud, whence issue faint rays into the Darkness which covereth him. But immediately above his Sphere of Sensation there will appear a ray of bright Light as if preparing to penetrate the Darkness and the result of this will be that the Candidate, during the whole of the ceremony of Admis­sion, will usually appear to be somewhat automatic and vague.

Now, the Hegemon throughout the Ceremony acteth as a Guide, Prompter and Answerer fo r the Candidate, that is to say that his office toward the Candidate is analogous unto that of the Higher Soul; wherefore also, the Hegemon holding the Mitre- headed Sceptre, doth thus attract by that Sceptre of Wisdom, the Simulacrum of the Higher Self of the Candidate.

At this point therefore in the Ceremony is the decision actually taken by the Human Will of the Candidate, and rarely in his lifetime hath he been nearer the condition of death than at the moment when he standeth before the Altar, just before taking the Obligation of aN eophyte; seeing that he as though, disintegrated into his component parts."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"KJNG OVEJ(fhe W.A TEI( Therefore this process ofSymbolicJudgment taketh place dur­ing the speeches of the Hierophant to the Candidate; his answer prompted or by means of the Hegemon, and his consent to take the Obligation of Secrecy, etc. Now the moment that the Candidate thus consenteth, the Hiero­phant advanceth between the Pill ars as if thus asserting that the J udg­ment is concluded, and he advanceth by the Invisible Station ofHar­pocrates unto that of the Evil Triad, which latter he treadeth down Symbolically in his passage, so that as Aroueris he standeth upon the Opposer.

At the same time the Hiereus advances on the Candidate's left, and the Hegemon standeth on his right-hand as fo rmulating about him the Symbol of the Triad before he be permitted to place his right hand in the centre of the White Triangle of the Three Supernals on the Altar. And he first kneeleth in Adoration of that Symbol, as if the Natural Man abnegated his Will before that of the Divine Consciousness.

The Candidate cannot as yet comprehend that before Mildness can be exercised rightly, the fo rces both of Severity and Mercy must be known and wielded. But to accomplish this, the greatest courage and energy is required, and not hysterical weakness and absence of resolution and action. Therefore is the address of the Hiereus an affirmation of the necessity of courage and of the danger of fe ar; and he giveth one Knock, as if sealing the vibration of that Force imaged in the Candidate's Sphere ofSensation.

Thus performed, this Sign is a Symbol of tremendous attacking fo rce, and of projection of the \\Vill Power, and it should be employed in all cases where Force of Attack is required, especially in charging of Talismans and the like. Generally, it is best to have the thumbs and all the fingers extended, but if thou wishest a particular effect, thou mayest extend only the fingers appropriate thereto, keeping the rest, as fa r as possible, fo lded back to the hand; but this is hardly as strong as with the whole hand. Also herewith, may be combined the attribution of the Planets to the head, as cS to the Right Nostril, 9 to the Mouth, etc., sending at the same time an imaginary ray of colour of the Planet desired from the part of the head attributed thereto. But when finished, be thou careful to withdraw the rays again or they will remain like so many outlets fo r thine Astral Force, thus exhausting thee. And the best way of doing this is by immediately giving the \"Sign of Silence.\" For the First Sign should always be answered by the Second. The Secret Names of the Saluting Sign are \"The Attacking Sign\" or \"The Sign of the Enterer of the Threshold.\" of the SIGN OF SILENCE a) Apparent Meaning Its Apparent Meaning is simply that of Silence and Secrecy regarding the Mysteries ofthe Order. b) Mystical or Spiritual Reference The affirmation of the Station of Harpocrates, wherein the Higher Soul of the Candidate is fo rmulated in part of the Ceremony of Admission.

For Force in Contemplation or Meditation: - as if seated upon a Lotus. For more Material Force: -as if standing upon a Dragon or a Serpent, or with each fo ot upon a Dragon or Serpent like certain of the Images ofHarpocrates. And as a Defence and Protection, the Sign is as strong as the Banishing Pentagram, though of a different nature.

Therefore it is important at this point that they should be in these particular places. The Candidate now therefore is standing between the Pill ars bound with the rope, like the mummied fo rm of Osiris between Isis and Nephthys. And in this position doth the Fourth and Final Consecration by the Goddesses of the Scales of Balance take place, he being fo r the first time during the Ceremony, standing at the point which representeth the Equilibrium of the Balance; and meanwhile, the Kerux goeth to the North in readiness fo r the Circumambulation so as to link that with the final Consecration of the Candidate. Now this final Consecration is also commanded by Horus, the powerful Avenger of Osiris, as still menacing the Evil Persona of the Candidate; and its effect is to seal finally, in balanced fo rmulation the Four Pill ars in the Sphere of Sensation of the Candidate. This doth not imply that they were not naturally there before; but in the Natural Man the Symbols are unbalanced in strength, some being weaker and some stronger, and the effect of the Ceremony is to strengthen the weak, to purifY the strong, thus gradually commencing to equilibrate them; at the same time making a link between them and the corresponding fo rces in the Macrocosm. This therefore being done it is then only that the Hierophant commandeth the removal of the rope, which hath hitherto been purposely retained to symbolically restrict the action of the Natural Man whose temptation is toward the Evil Persona. The Four Pillars being thus established, the Candidate now only is invested with the Badge of the White Triangle of the Three Supernals fo rmulating in Darkness, and now also the Higher Self is enabled to fo rmulate a link with him, if the Human Will of the Natural Man be in reality consenting thereto. For the Free Will of the Candidate as a Natural Man is never obsessed, either by the Higher Soul or by the Ceremony. But the Will consenting, the whole of the Ceremony is directed to st rengthening its action.

But the Higher Soul or Genius returneth unto the Invisible Sta­tion ofHarpocrates, unto the place of the Hidden Centre, yet retain­ing the link fo rmulated with the Candidate. The Address of the Hierophant is simply intended to effect the distinct fo rmulation of the Symbols of the @=[Q] ofNeophyte in the Candidate, and it is therefore only when this is finished that the Watcher Anubis, announceth that the Candidate hath been admitted as a duly initiated Neophyte. The Hiereus is charged with a warning address, as again confirm­ing the Will of the Candidate, and addressing a final menance unto the Evil Persona.

The final Speech of the Hierophant is further intended, besides its apparent meaning, to affirm that an only partially initiated person is neither fitted to teach nor to instruct even the Outer and more ignorant in Sublime Knowledge; as he is thus certain through misunderstanding of the Principia to fo rmulate Error instead ofTruth. Th e SYMBOLISM ofthe CL OSING CER.§MONY of the @=[Q] GJ?..#DE of NE OPHTTE The greater part of the Closing Ceremony is explained by the Sym­holism of the Opening. The Reverse Circumambulation, however, is intended to fo rmulate the Withdrawal of the Light of the Supernal Triad from the Altar, so that it may not be profaned by abiding there without due guard. Not that the Divine Light would suffer thereby, but because it might initiate an Avenging Current if profaned. This is what is implied by the Law ofMoses in the prohibition of off ering unconsecrated Fire either before or within the Veil of the Tabernacle. As a vibratory fo rmula, the Reverse Circumambulation repre­senteth the reversal of the Current, and the restoration of the Opera­tor to his ordinary condition fo r the same reason.

Its Mystic Name is \"The Formula of the Justified One,\" and it is sufficiently explained in the Section concerning the Altar in the earlier part of this Lecture.

Th e SYMBOLISM ojthe CER§MONYofthe E�INOX The whole Formulas of the Ceremony of the Equinox are intended to create a magical link between the Sun, as the Light ofNature, and the Order of the Golden Dawn in the Outer; and it should be celebrated within 48 hours (4 times the number 12 of the Zodiac) of the Actual Solar Entry, ifit by any means can be accomplished. As usual the single Knock given by the Hierophant heraldeth the initiation of a fresh vibration or current. The Password as before ex­plained, is the Symbol of the connecting link of the purpose of the Ceremony. Therefore before commencing the operation to attract a fr esh current, the Kerux proclaimeth that the fo rmer Password is ab­rogated.

The Officers then being careful to fo llow the course of the 0, deposit in turn, their Insignia on the Altar, taking therefrom instead the Mystical Symbols of the Body of Osiris corresponding to their Cardinal Points. But the Hegemon taketh the Red Lamp. The Kerux and the Members then circumambulate, halting at the Cardinal Points and fa cing them, representing the course of the 0 through the Zodiac in order to attract the Solar Ray, but under the control of its Superior, i.e. the Light of Osiris, and the Adorations are performed at the Stations of the Kerubim to mark the limits of the 0. But this time it is with the Lamp of the Watcher of the Gods and with the Sign of the Calvary Cross ofTiphareth that the Hegemon doth seal in the Centre the image of the Solar Light. Then only doth the Hierophant finally confirm it or seal it by conference of the Password. In this Password, as a link with the Solar Light doth each Officer claim his Insignia. And is customary that the Officers of the Temple should be appointed at each Equinox so that they may commence their Offices fo rtified by a special attraction of the Solar Light. The fo rmal assertion of the entry of the new current is then proclaimed and the Mystic \\Vords are recited to close the ceremony. And from this Ceremony also there be many Practical Formulas derivable which will be easily comprehended by the Zelator Adeptus Minor who hath mastered the whole of this Lecture. Only let him remember that this Ceremony of the Equinox representeth the sudden attraction and sealing of a Force in Nature then in Operation, rather than the performance of a continuous and graduated ceremony to build up the same. Consequently also, it is well to use the Password then in being as an adjunct to the other Names employed in Magical Ceremonies and Operations as bringing into operation the link with the Solar Light.

The first involves doing the ritual as it is written and relying on the psychological value of the symbols and the drama to have a direct impact on the candidate. This is what I would call the Masonic way. It is valid when a well trained team of people can give a convincing perfor­mance and can attract those spiritual fo rces to carry out the neces­sary transformation. Then there is the magical way, which involves the visualisation of symbols by some or all of the officers. Some of these symbols are the spiritual fo rces which are supposed to be attracted to the ritual, such as the various gods. This visualisation of fo rces can be very involved and can be seen psychically operating on different spiritual levels. The methods by which this is done is kept a closely guarded secret by any esoteric group. The theory is that anything which is built by thought can be destroyed by thought. Instruc­tions of what to visualise in a ritual a rare, and one of the unusual things about the Golden Dawn was that they were provided to study. Equally unusual about the Golden Dawn is that although these chapters were valuable fr om a magical perspective their use fell in and out of fashion within the Order's short life. Mter the rebellion they were dropped by the faction lead by A.E. Waite. They were not fo und in the Nui documents, and, as we will see, the .AO ritual of the Berridge temple included certain short cuts which implies that in London they had been abandoned. They were used in Mather's Paris temple and the later Stella Matutina and Wh are R,g. Z1 outlines how a ritual was to be worked, Z2 explains how the @=[QJ can be used to carry out any fo rm of magic and Z3 goes into the magical details of what is supposed to be visualised and seen. Mathers also wrote a similar Z document for the CD:OQ] ritual, but fo r some reason considered that this was too advanced to be hand­ed out to anyone but the highest Golden Dawn initiates, who were of the ThAM sub-grade. Felkin agreed and did not give them out until the ®=E3J. It was published by Pat Zalewski in his book In ­ner Order Te achings of the Golden Dawn.

This would suggest that it was written before Mathers lost his LeT contact. LeT was not around to provide information fo r any of the other Grades. This version ofZ1 is one the earliest of those available. It is prac­tically identical to the .AO version from the 192os. The Stella Ma­tutina made minor changes to it, which are considered \"standard\" by the modern Golden Dawn community. In this paper there is the idea that the temple has a physical structure and an inner structure. The physical structure involved having the temple laid out with a cubic altar more or less in the centre and two pillars in front of th em. There would be a dais in the East with a panel of the senior officers and chiefs. Amongst them is the Initiating Officer called the Heirophant; sitting between the Pillars is the Hegemon; in the West is the Heirus and in the South West is the Kerux. In the North is the Stolisties who carries water and in the South is the Dadouchos who has fire. These officers per­fo rm the actions according to the script. It is not clear if the script was memorised. Z1 presents a fo rmat fo r an Inner Temple with godforms which are supposed to be placed at important parts of the ritual. This has a two-fold purpose. This temple is said to represent the Judgement Hall ofMaat, who was the Egyptian goddess ofBalance and Order, but it is also supposed to represent the Tree of Life laid down flat with the lion's share of the temple representing Malkuth, or the material plane. Godforms of each of the Egypt gods over each of the Officers. These are called the Visible Stations and the placement of these godforms could be done without the officers' knowledge. This was done by the Heirophant before anyone entered the temple. The temple would be set up and the Hierophant would build a thought­fo rm and visualise it strongly in front of him. Perhaps he would think of the legend of each god or have a silent prayer fo r them. There would need to be some emotion to ensoul it. The truth is we do not know fo r certain how this was done. What I have suggested above is likely based on what was being written about at the time by the Theosophical Society. This saw the light of day in the Annie Besant and C.W. Leadbeater book"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":")00 KJNG OYERJhe WA TEI( Th ought-Fo rms. The technique taught in Wh are R.g was a little more involved. It required the thought-form to be built out of the es­sence of the Hierophant and each of them was connected to him and through him to the Divine Light in the East of the Temple. Each of these godforms would be seen to move as the officer did, effectively making the god do the magical work. The visualisation work was supposed to be carried out by the Hierophant, who was assisted by the panel of chiefs behind him. Their Gods did not move much so it was easier fo r them to carry out that fu nction. The names of the gods were written in Coptic to give them an authentic fe el, but in the @=[Q] they were a fairly bog standard range of Egyptian gods, Osiris (Heirophant), Isis (Praemonstra­tor), Thoth (Cancellerious), etc. The reason they were there was to cause a change in the candidate. To quote Besant and Leadbeater: lf the man's thought or feeling is directly connected with some­one else, the resultant thought-form moves toward! that person and discharges itself up on his astral and mental bodies .... If the thought-form be neither definitely persona/nor sp ecially aimed at someone else, it simply floats detached in the atmosphere, all the time radiating vibrations simila r to those originally smt fo rth by its creator .... if it succeed! in awakming sympathetic vibration in any mmtal body near at hand, an attraction is set up, and the thought-fo rm is usually absorbed by that mental body. In otherwords a thought fo rm when it strikes a candidate which is sympathetic to it starts the alchemical processes which it represents. The weakness of this method within the Golden Dawn was that too fe w people knew what was happening. Officers, in theory at least, could be lowly grades and have no idea of the thought-form which had been placed over them. This meant that if a high level Adept took the role they would be able to take part in visualising the god and intensifY the experience fo r the Candidate. In Wh are Rg the officers rarely changed, so it was common to have high level officers who knew what godform they were using. The next thing that the Z document suggests is that there were Godforms which were mostly static or not connected to the ritual. Their fu nction is to influence the candidate independently"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"NICJ(F.Al(J?,§LL )01 fr om the officers. Their work is described more in Z3. The use of godforms would be straight fo rward if there had not been the need to make three of them up. The Dadouchos had a godform which looked like Isis, but was actually an aspect ofMaat, Th-ma-ac-asch. Likewise the Stolistes was Th-ma-ac-ht, who was the image of N ephysis. Neither of these goddesses existed in Egypt and it appears that Mathers or LeT wanted to emphasise the connection between these two officers and the Hegemon. The equipment and robes of the officers is different from what many consider to be the Golden Dawn today. In a modern Golden Dawn order, and indeed the Bristol temple and Wh are R.g, the of­ficers wore robes and then cloaks over the top with their insignia on them. However, in the early Golden Dawn they would wear gowns, probably over their street clothes or a black tunic. These gowns were similar to those used fo r Universities and some Oxford Colleges still use them. These gowns were also used by the SocietaJ J?..Eiicruciana in .Ang!ia (SRIA) and Westcott was photographed in one. They had white cords and tassels to symbolise spiritual purity and the influence of the divine and shining light. SR,!.A still uses such gowns, but they appear to be less grand affairs than they were in Westcott's day and have less tassels. This version of the Z documents shows how different parts of the magical weapons are connected to different paths on the Tree ofLife. This is one of the lost pieces ofinformation fo r some Golden Dawn groups. When an officer held a wand, or a sword in a different place, they were expected to bring in the energies or qualities of that path. During some parts of the ritual officers were expected to change their grip on the wand to represent the flow of power that they were using at that moment. While many Golden Dawn groups insist on holding the wands in the middle, more of­ten they were held by the bottom section to represent the powers of the lower paths fo cusing on the Malkuth of the Candidate. If the idea of gowns is fo reign to modern Golden Dawn groups then the idea of robes fo r ordinary members will also seem strange. According to the Z1 a person was allowed to enter the temple wearing their sash over their ordinary clothes. Option­ally they could wear a plain black tunic with the sash of the grade across it."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":")02 I<JNG Of/ERJhe W.A TEI( So why was it difficult to wear a tunic or, as it has become known as, a Tau robe? The problem with modern perceptions of the G D is the belief that they operated much like we do. People wore robes and then a cloak over the top. However, it occurred to me that Victorian women would not be allowed to strip down to just a robe and wear it in fr ont of men, even with a cloak over the top. This would like wearing your underwear in a ritual. To the victorian middle classes a woman in her underwear was naked! It would have also been difficult to wear a robe over a Victorian dress. Egyptian headdresses were another \"optional thing\" and could only be worn if you were decking yourself out in the tunic. These were ofblack and white stripes and did not have a tail (stuffed or otherwise). They appear to have been made of a stiff linen. It was also optional to wear a mask to cover the face. It was black material attached to the front part of the headress so to cover the fa ce, and it had the face of Osiris on it. It is unlikely that these were popular, particularly in Britain. It is a moot point if they were ever used. During the revolt one of the things that Crowley and Mathers tried to get the various temples to adopt were masks. This means that they had been abandoned, if they were ever used in the first place. The likely reason that Mathers"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"NICJ(F.Al(R§LL )0) wanted the rebels to adopt masks was to reduce the impact of per­sonality on the rituals. If you want to see the effect on a ritual you should see the film Eye1 Wide Shut. If they are well made they can scare the pants off a candidate; if they are not they have a comedy value. One ritual I attended used homemade masks. The person who had the role of Horus could not find a hawk and so adapted a chicken mask with the eyes in the side. Unfortunately, he had to turn his head to see anything and rather than looking like the Son of Horus he looked like something which would have been better off served with stuffing and roast potatoes. It is not surprising that they were dropped fr om later Z1 copies used by the rebels. Masks were not used by the Stella Matuti11a or Whare % as common practice, but I was told they could be theoretically used fo r the officers in the elemental grades. It was just no one could remember them being used since the 196os or could tell me what they looked like. The next thing Z1 suggests which is different from modern Golden Dawn groups is the idea that pillars were not round. Z1 calls them pillars or Obelisks. The Isis-Urania pillars were more like Obelisks in that they were square. I have seen the Isis-Urania pillars and they are quite tall and square with pictures of the Ker­ubs on the upper parts. It is not clear how the images from the Book of the Dead were hung on them. Following this description it would be possible to create true Obelisks out ofblocks of wood. The confusion comes from many of the diagrams of the pillars which show them to be round. The Pi llars at Whare % were round and Paul Foster Case insisted that they be sloped. In Builden of the .Adytum in New Zealand they were slightly conical and made out of sheet metal. Z1 explains one of the greatest mysteries of the Golden Dawn: how did they ever light red three-sided pyramids on top of the columns? The answer was to make the three-sided pyramid solid and then place small candles on top. In the case of the Isis-Urania pillars these would appear to have been a wooden three-sided pyr­amid with a hole drilled through the centre through which a can­dle would have been placed. Others would have just had a wo oden pyramid with a flat top upon which would be placed a candle or"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"1\\lNG OVER.Jhe WA TER.._ tea-light. The Z documents also allow fo r the wearing ofbadges of\"af­filiated orders\" by \"special permission.\" This must mean allowing some of the Masonic orders or SRJ..A. It is not clear what special permission you would have to get and why anyone would insist that they be allowed to wear it. This fe els more like something that was added by Mathers or Westcott, as it is difficult to imagine it being channelled. The Archangel Raphael is not likely to come down the various levels to tell anyone that a Freemasonic provin­cial grandmaster is allowed to wear his special pin at Golden Dawn meetings. Z1 gives some different uses of the crosses. Within Wh are R.g the teaching was that a chief wore a Maltese Cross on their chest above a triangle, while the officers on the floor, including the Hei­rophanr, wore just Calvary Crosses. The idea was that the Maltese Cross was seen as more of a balanced element symbol. In some modern Golden Dawn orders the officers wear a Maltese Cross. Z1 says that the Chiefs should wear the symbol of the Calvary cross above the Triangle, while the officers on the floor can choose any cross they like. \"It is indifferent which of the Crosses be em­ployed, seeing that each represents the operation of the Light coming fo rth from behind the Veil.\" Z1 goes on to mention the other Invisible stations. Firstly, there are the obvious MAN, LION, EAGLE and BULL at the quarters. Mathers points out that they are placed in this position in all Golden Dawn temple warrants. A warrant is a Masonic tradi­tion and it is a piece of paper which gives the temple authority to exist. In Freemasonry it is proudly shown as part of the Lodge's opening ritual. Z1 says that the \"body of a Warrant, authoris­ing the fo rmation and establishment of a Temple, represents the Temple itself,\" which is why the Kerubs were drawn on it. This also shows how potent some of the pure Masonic traditions were within the Golden Dawn. But it is also telling. Even if Mathers did not know that the Sprengel letters were fo rged, he knew that the \\Varrant was not signed by the woman herself. By making the \\Varrant iconic, \"representing the Temple itself,\" he was saying the temple was a lie. Fortunately the ritual did not require the showing of the Warrant."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"NICJ(F.Al(,R.§LL jO) At the cross quarters were placed the Sons of Horus. Ameshet was placed in the North-East, Toumathph was in placed in the South East, Ahephi was placed in the South-West and Kabexnuv or Dabexnjemouv was in the North-West. This is based on their elemental attribution and aimed to help with the Egyptian flavour of the ritual but it became clear that it had little to do with Ancient Egypt. Firstly the names of the Four Sons were Imsety, Duamutef, Hapi and Qg>ehsenuef. At no point were they put in the cross quarters. Instead they were seen at the cardinal points; Hapi was the North, Imsety the South, Duamutef the East and Qg>eh­senuefthe West. Brodie-Innes had a go at trying to clarify it all in a good paper called The Sy mboliJm of the Fo ur Genii in the Hall of the Ne ophyte. \\Vhile it is clear he wanted to tell people what the Four Sons of Horus did in Ancient Egypt, it would appear he also did not want to upset anyone by saying Zx was wrong (although he does hint that the cross quarter idea was not quite right). Instead what he did was use the Egyptian names from the Z documents and then tries to attribute the traditional meanings of parts of the body to each son. As a result he makes a bigger mess of it. The traditional Egyptian attributions were: lmsety Liver Human South Hapy Lungs Baboon North Duamutef Stomach Jackal East Q9->ehsenuef Intestines Falcon West Brodie Innes' attributions were: Ameshet Stomach/ (lmsety) Upper Human East Intestines Ahephi Lower Baboon North (Hapy) Intestines Toumathph Heart and Jackal South (Duamutef) Lungs Kabexnuv Gall-bladder I Falcon West (�behsenuef) Liver"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"..,o6 ) l<JNG OYER,Jhe W.A TEJ( Most modern Golden Dawngroups follow the Broddie-Innes way to keep the elemental attributions. Before anyone thought about changing them, it would depend if these were more impor­tant than the association to Ancient Egypt and the parts of the body. I can see a case fo r either method. The Sons of Horus do have an important connection to the body of the candidate during the @=[ill ritual and it is easy to find reasons fo r the Jackal to be in the East, rather than the South, and the Human to be in the South rather than the East. Osiri.r and tht Fo ur Sons of Horus A noticeable difference between this earlier Z1 and later ver­sions used by the Stella Matutina, as published by Israel Regar­die, is the lack of descriptions fo r any of the Egyptian godforms. While it is possible that this was considered a \"higher grade\" than Z1 was originally released at, it is more likely that the use of visual images, as used by the Stella Matuti11a, were more important. Dion Fortune said that the visual images of the godforms were one of the closely guarded secrets of a magical order. She hinted that coloured diagrams of the godforms used were the keys to under­standing the ritual and were destroyed when an order closed. It is only possible to assume that she got that information from her Golden Dawn teacher, Maiya Tranchell-Hayes, which makes her horror at Regardie publishing the Stella Matutina godforms more logical. In this version of the Z documents it is nearly impossible to create the sorts ofbeings that are suggested by the Stella Matu­tina. Take, fo r example, the Kerub of the Fire, which is used by the Magical Order of the .Aurora .Aurea based on the Wh are R.g Z"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"NICJ(F.Al(R§LL jO/ documents. According to this version, the Kerub of Fire has the fa ce and fo rm of a lion with large and clashing wings. However, the Stella Matuti11a added that the colouring was \"very lively and flashing Leo green with ruby and flame-blue and emerald green.\" My point is that whatever Mathers had originally developed was being fleshed out by his successors. Oddly, much of this later work is considered traditional now even amongst those groups who had nothing to do with the Golden Dawn. The other invisible stations will become more important in The rest ofZ1 is a break down of the opening of the Neophyte grade and it gives a different complexion of what many would see as the Golden Dawn. On one hand, Mathers, or Raphael, is ex­plaining the meaning of the ritual and how it should be performed. The way it is written, it implies these things will happen when you do this rite. Any magician would assume that these things are not going to happen without a bit of prodding and therefore would be visualising to make them happen. The Opening Ceremony begins with the Cry of the \"\\Vatcher Within\" (ANUBIS), who should come to the right front of the Hi­erophant and raise his Wand. This symbol of the Ray of the Di­vine Light fr om the White Triangle of the Three Supernals thus descends into the Darkness and warns the Evil and uninitiated to retire, so that the \\Vhite Triangle may be fo rmulated upon the Al­tar through the combined effect of the fo rmulae of the Opening Ceremony. Having done this, he sees that the Entrance is properly guarded. So what we are seeing here is the godform of Anubus standing in the North-East. He raises his wand and draws down light into the temple. It can be assumed that the light is drawn into his lamp, as Z1 does not tell the reader wh ere it goes. In the Magical Order of .Au rora .Aurea the Kerux stands with his lamp arm extended so that he fo rms a letter L, signifying Lux, and shows the light as a fo rm of guidance. The next thing that happens is the request to show that \"though in the Land of Blindness and Ignorance, have yet seen that Triangle of Divine Light from the Three Supernals fo rmu­lated in Darkness.\" Practically, this is the grade signs. This Z1"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"\"08 ) IqNG 0!/ER..fhe W.A TEI( statement is not magical, but rather intellectual and it would be hard to find a magical fo rmula based on it. But then there is a description of the letter H, which suddenly gives the magician a powerful magical fo rmula based on it . ... the Adept, standing in his Sp here of Smsation [should] raise himself unto the contemplation of i11'n' TECHIDAH and from t!Jmce aspire downwards into himselfthe Lower Gmius as though temporarily to inhabit himselfas its Te mple .. This involves fo cusing your concentration on the highest fo rm of God you can imagine and when you have identified yourself with this, fo cus on your body and move your awareness down to it. The difference is that you see yourself as God inhabiting your personality as a temple. This is a good mindset from which to start any ritual. Mathers expands this by telling the candidate to stand in the fo rm of a cross, which is a symbol of sacrificing the lower self to the higher will. Visualise a divine name above you. Breathe in and draw it down to your heart centre and silently pronounce the name. You do not breathe out yet, but send the name to your groin centre and then down to your fe et. Then you breathe out while vibrating the name. What this does is draw down divine power into the material world and extends it by doing the Sign of the Enterer followed by the Sign of Silence. This was called by Mathers \"a great and secret development of the Vibratory Mode of Pronouncing the Divine Names.\" It should not be used with elemental or demonic names, because you are drawing the energy through your own body. Using a lower fo rce will unbalance you completely. This is also called \"The Vibratory Formula of the Middle Pil­lar,\" and notice it is nothing like the fo rmula suggested by Israel Regardie in his The Art of Tr ue Healing. The next part ofZ1 is disappointing when you know what the Stella Matutina and TFhare R.g did to expand its meaning. Mathers claims that it is just a recapitulation of the Stations and duties of the Officers, \"thus occultly affirming the establishment of the Temple so that the Divine Light may shine into the Darkness\". But what happened in later orders was that this was where the godforms were linked to the various officers, either consciously"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"NICl(FAI(RfiLL or unconsciously, and the rite came alive. The simple repeating of the duties of the officers is not enough to do this, particularly if the officers are unaware of the godforms being placed over them. It is at this point that the chiefs and the Hierophant are working flat out. Indeed, the Hierophant is required at this point to power the officers with the Sign of the Enterer and, when he is finished, the Sign of Si lence. This key sequence is missing from Z1, which means its importance was a later development. There then begins the purification and consecration of the Hall by \\Vater and by Fire. Mathers says that this is the limita­tion of the Four Cardinal Points at the Four Qg_arters, and the Equilibration of the Elements, the Baptism of the Place and the Preparation of a fitting Shrine fo r the Forces of the Divine Light. Crucially he does not fe el the need to tell us how this is done. The instructions of the officers at this point were simply to go around the temple one at a time with water and then fire. How this would balance anything is anyone's guess. The much later method of go­ing round with the Stolisties being mirrored by the Dadouchos and balanced by the Hegemon makes much more sense. It is al­most as if the Golden Dawn wanted that final result but at the time of writing this document had not worked out how to get it. There then becomes a long description of the meaning of the Mystic Circumambulation and why it is vital fo r the fo rmulation of the white triangle upon the altar. And fr om it is drawn another fo rmula fo r the circulation of the breath. The breath should be sent down the left and up the right sides of the body. This is done fo ur times. The goal of this breathing exercise is to attract and make the connection between the Divine Light and you. It does this by cre­ating a vortex of power in the Sphere of Sensation. \\Vhile it fits very nicely with the Adept being the temple, particula rly if the person is lying down, it is clear that Mathers saw the white trian­gle as being fo rmed on the altar which would place it around the navel. But this would mean that the circumamublation should be a flat spiral, much like the milky way galaxy with the white triangle fo rming in its core. While this is not a bad visualisation, in practise the circu mumbulation on the temple floor fo rms a cone with each circuit being another level up. This creates a pattern similar to the Mountain of Albergus, with the triangle fo rmed at the top of"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"jiO I<JNG Of/El(fhe W.A TEJ( the peak. If applied to Mathers' fo rmula the triangle would fo rm about a metre away from the navel which is not particularly useful, nor meaningful. The information given fo r the officers and their members is strange in comparison to modern practice. The modern way is fo r those circumambulating to receive the light of the Hierophant (or Banner of the East) as you pass and to use the Sign of the Enterer to push it into the vortex. If you did it the way described in Z1 you would pass the Ban­ner of the East and with your back to it do the sign of the Enterer in the South-East. Having tried it, I can say I don't like it, but it might just be because of years of doing it the other way. Likewise, there is not a lot of magic being done in the Adora­tion or the declaration. It seems that when getting to the end of Z1 Mathers, or Raphael, was losing interest in providing magical information. According to Z1 the three knocks given by the officer are the \"battery of the @=[Q] grade\" and affirms that the white triangle has been fo rmed. There is also a bit of a psycho-egyptian inter­pretation of the Khab-em-Pekht, and it is finished. As fa r as explanation to the Opening, it is a little basic and also does not go very fa r to explaining the complex magic that should be going on. But fo r its time, ZI was revolutionary. A fe w basic instructions showed that the ritual was not just meant to be per­fo rmed and that there was a system of visualisation behind it from which various fo rmulas could be derived. IfZI was supposed to be the starting point, it certainly was that. The hints in ZI were de­veloped by the later Golden Dawn and even in the modern Gold­en Dawn, where they have resulted in an intellectual complexity that would not have been dreamed ofby Mathers. But some care­fu l examination would reveal that Mathers has not really looked that hard at the Opening himself. Indeed, as we will see later, his own group was not that keen to develop the magical aspects of the ritual beyond what is seen here. As we saw earlier, it appears to have been optional, with Mathers suggesting cuts for the sake of time. After looking at the importance of the circumambulations to bring the triangle oflight into the temple to activate it, we can see that cutting it would kill off any magical possibilities from the"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"N!Cl(F.AI(R§LL jll entire ritual. The fact that Mathers even suggested this indicates that by then he was not fo cused on a magical approach in his ini­tiation rituals. Z2 is one of the more interesting magical documents that the Golden Dawn offered. This version again is from the .AO and, from what I have seen, is identical to the early Golden Dawn, but has some telling differences from the later Stella Matutina. What Z2 does is take the @=[ill ritual as a template fo r other different types of personal magic. It highlights some of the more obscure parts of the @=[ill ritual too, as it reveals the different fo rmulae which are being played out in that combination. It is not a \"cut and paste\" fo rmula. The Adept must use them to provide a guideline fo r their own rituals, but they are too wide to kill off creativity. Mathers, or LeT, could have just provided a dozen rites which could be used in every case. But instead they have an outline and told the student to get to it. Firstly, the way I have had to lay this out is different from the original manuscript. Originally it was laid out as a huge table of six columns. This allowed the Adept to see how their ritual compared with the correct section of the @=[ill. But this is impossible to du­plicate in a printed book (and believe me I tried. I had the same problems as Israel Regardie and Crowley, who also gave up and printed each column separately.) This approach has created a fe w problems fo r those who have attempted creating Z2 rituals. There is a tendency to rely on the columns without cross referencing back to the @=[ill and as a re­sult you end up a bit like Regardie going completely over the top with his rituals. The other thing which is different is that while this version of Z2 refers to the fact that the division is based on the Hebrew letters of the name JHSh Vh the different times of ritual are bro­ken down in terms of element. Emphasis on the break down by ele­ment gives a different set of meanings. Knowing that Alchemy is attributed to Earth and not Spirit, fo r example, gives an indication about how Mathers saw Alchemical teachings. Rather than con-"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":")12 IqNG OYEJ{fhe W.A TEI( sider them high level, he saw them as the lowest aspect of ritual magic akin to manipulating the Earth. If Alchemy was high up the pecking order of whatever LeT was teaching him, it would have been part of the Spirit section. This might explain the low inter­est in Alchemy within the Golden Dawn in comparison to other Rosicrucian groups. One thing that going through this list is clear is that it was never finished. It tends to slot in more traditional Agrippa magic very well, but there are some aspects of magic which are missing, such as healing, astral, channelling, colour, kundalini and godform work. These fit into the Z2 fo rmula and would have been easy to do so. Nature magic is limited to a rite to change the weather, which is a little twee and was dropped in later G D documents. What it does point out is that you can use the @=[Q] to create any ritual you like. Many people have been put off by Z2, claiming that it makes fo r rituals that are very involved and long winded. They base this on the rituals that Regardie created fo r the Bristol temple. But it is fairly clear that Regardie over egged the pudding when he wrote his rituals. Regardie was actually told by Bristol that the rituals were good, but were a bit too involved fo r their taste. Z2 rituals can be quite short and not at all wordy. What is important is that they are wired into the @=[Q]. One aspect of these rituals is to suggest to the Adept things that they might not have worked out about the @=[Q]. A Candi­date is a talisman and this is what happens to them, the Higher Self is being evoked and this is the fo rmula, something alchemical is happening at these different points and this is what you have to look fo r. If you were to overlay all ofZ2 over the @=[Q] you would start to see a grander scheme. While this seems obvious to those that fo llowed in the later Golden Dawn, it apparently never occurred to Mathers who was happy to keep this outline and never develop it."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"NJCJ(F.Al(.R./}LL Z3 appears largely unchanged throughout the history of the Golden Dawn and any differences were minor. This version is fr om the early Golden Dawn, but compared to the later .AO one it is more or less the same. From the perspective of a practical magi­cian it is of a different order of any of the previous Z documents. While Z1 set the scene fo r a magical initiation, and Z2 did suggest that the @=[Q] had other magical uses, in Z3 we finally see how it is supposed to look. In the Opening we see that the magic begins before the Can­didate even enters the temple. Normally they are placed outside and are given various symbols to mediate on which links them to the order. z3 tells us that they are being guarded at this point by the godform of Anubis, who protects them fr om the dog-faced demons. Then the Heirophant gives a single knock which is sup­posed to announce the vibration in the Sphere of Sensation of the Candidate. What this is describing is that the Heirophant from his position has fo rmed a link with the Candidate who is waiting outside. The effect of this link is strange fo r those who experi­ence it. When I experienced it, under Percy Wilkinson, I could hear the ritual taking part in the distance. Instead of a knock there was a gong. As the gong reverberated I fo und myself going into a trance and fe eling a tremendous pressure around me. There was a loss of personal control and I was unable to do much, other than allow myself to be lead to the temple where I was robed and blind­fo lded. The person who took the role of the Sentinel asked me, \"how are you feeling?\" I opened my mouth to speak and fo und I couldn't. When I looked confused at this, I was told, \"yeah, that is normal.\" The Hierophant announces that he has received a dispensa­tion from the Greatly Honoured Chiefs of the Second Order to admit the Candidate, but there is a much deeper meaning to this. It is saying that the initiation is only taking place with the bless­ing of the higher powers, and this is crucial. An order can initiate as many people as it likes, but without that blessing an initiation will not take place. Many people think that it is the Hierophant who is the initiator. In fa ct, it is those high er powers which are"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"KJNG Of/ER.Jhe W.A TEJ<.... behind the order which do the work. If anything, the Hierophant has to get out of the way at certain points; otherwise their own ego will block the initiation from happening. The Hierophant is a fo cus fo r those powers, nothing more. If they allow themselves to think fo r a moment that they are the most important person in the room, they lose that ability and absorb the energy fo r them­selves. Moreover, the work they have to make the links to get that blessing fo r an initiation to take place is huge. If a person is coming into a group to make up numbers, or to provide the chiefs with an empire of people on which to inflate their ego there is simply no initiation. This is one of the reasons why many Golden Dawn orders fa il. A group might get together and the first thing they do is bring in lots of pe ople who are not suited to it to make up the numbers. This means then that the Heirophant has not got the dispensation to initiate and they fill their temples up with non-initated people who never get to the Second Order. If more time was spent checking that people have the right connection to the Order in the first place, rather than playing fo r numbers, there would be less problems. Z3 explains what is going on during the binding of the candidate. It says that it is done by Anubis under the control ofMaat, who is the Goddess of Order and Balance. But what equally happens here is that the Lower Nature is bound and limited so that it can't stop the initia­tion. This is done by a polarity between Anubis and Maat. He is the fo rce that protects the Sphere of Sensation from rogue elements and she is the fo rce that removes those aspects which block progress. In a fu sion the Anubis fo rce becomes an internal guardian to the candidate and shuts out the personality. Maat does this on a macrocosmic level so that the lower self is completely suppressed by their personal and universal guardians. If done properly it has the effect I described ear­lier with the conscious mind allowed to operate without the chatter of the lower self Z3 then gives some performance tips which would apply to any ritual group, but then it sa ys that the officers should endeav­our to hear the voice of the god or goddess they represent. Given that this applies only to the Second Order members it is a surpris­ingly tame instruction. The effect should be more than just hearing the god speaking, it should be seeing the god acting. \\Vhen done properly the Officer loses themselves within the godform. If an"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"NJCJ(F.Al(R.§LL )I) officer has to take on se veral go dforms, people notice a change in their voice. Sometimes if you have to do more than one initiation, the voices of the officers change in accordance to the relationship that the Candidate has with each energy. I ha ve fo und a couple of times where Osiris has spoken kindly to one candidate and with a more aggressive energy to another. It seems that Mathers or LeT was concerned about officers becoming too identified with their godforms and preferred the more gentle approach rather than the fu ll on \"godform assumption\" which is used in many modern or­ders. The effect that Mathers wanted might be similar to what is experienced by the modern orders. This comment about letting the Candidate represent a world in which the officer is beginning to lead them unto the Knowledge of their Governing Angel is a very interesting angle to take on the@=[[]. Z3 then tells how the candidate enters the temple. The first knock is basically an acceptance of the energy they were blasted with while they were waiting outside the temple. It is echoed by the Kerux, which, according to Mathers, is a confirmation that the Sphere of Sensation has taken the first current. It is an interesting psychology with esoteric orders that the Kerux would never say, \"Actually, no. This person has not got the connection to the Or­der. Send this one back.\" The assumption is that the ritual shows the ideal situation and the Candidate conforms to it. The Hierophant then seals the \"Candidate with a new name (his motto),\" which shall then become his Title in the Hall ofT ruth. Mottoes are often something which are regarded as an amusing tradition within some Golden Dawn groups, but this shows how important they are. A motto is supposed to be what the candidate aspires to at that level. In the Golden Dawn you would have to choose three. The first is fo r the Outer Order, which is symboli­cally burnt in the Portal and replaced by another fo r the Second Order. You have another one at your G:l=[±] initiation. There are some Golden Dawn groups which give a person a motto, and while this might seem like a good idea it is missing the point. A motto is supposed to be what an individual aspires to.

This takes a lot of meditation and then we translate it into Latin or some other language. Some skim through the list of mottoes in Th e Golden Dawn Companion and find one they like. Either way, they have to be involved. As Mathers says, it represents who they are in the Hall ofTruth. Th e Godform of the J<!rux Now comes the first barring, which Mathers sees as the most basic symbol as possible. He points out that it means that no natu­ral man can enter the Halls of Truth. This is fairly obvious, but it misses some important points about this first barring - it is the first piece of psychic surgery that takes place on the candidate. During my own initia tion, this first barring resulted in my heart centre opening. Effectly this is a \"stop and go\" sort of symbol. The old self cannot continue unless it is illuminated by an impulse from the Higher Self. The later Golden Dawn would attach some significant symbols to this point connected to the transformation energy required, but that is outside the scope of this book."},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"N!Cl(F.Al(R§LL Mathers says then that the Goddesses of the Scales consecrates [and purifies J the candidate. Obviously she doesn't, as this is left to the Stolisties and Dadouchos, who are aspects of the Hegemon, but we are told that this first consecration brings into action the fo ur pillars in the candidate's Sphere of Sensation. This is an important piece of teaching which never received much attention from those who follow the Golden Dawn system. The concept of the Sphere of Sensation is mentioned in se veral documents, mostly related to scrying. There is much that is original in the concept, which is ex­plained in the paper Macrocosm and Man, yet the idea appears unde­veloped. The Sphere of Sensation works as a canvas on which an auric energy system can be painted. Brodie-Innes says in Flying Roll XXV that the Sphere of Sensation is an egg shaped aura around the body which is ma de out of Akasha. Akasha is an Eastern term meaning ether, and in context the statement means that it is made of lower fo rms of spirit. In the pre-Einstein physics ether was the unseen energy that held the universe together. Although you could not see it, it was still a semi-physical fo rce. In the Indian philosophy, which influenced the Golden Dawn, Ak asha was also the spirit that bound together the fo ur elements. Brodie-Innes was saying that the Sphere of Sensation is made of an unseen spir­itual energy. However, Akasha also has some other abilities, which Brodie-Innes was hinting at. It is the memory of the Mind of God and it contains everything in reflection. One drop of Akasha con­tains a reflection of everything seen, unseen, past and present. He added that the Sphere of Sensation is \"as the Microcosm and the Universe as the Macrocosm; regarding the fo rmer as a reflection in miniature of the latter, as in a grass field full of dewdrops each drop might present a perfect tiny image of trees and mountains, the sky, clouds, the sun and the stars.\" In other words, it is like a hologram of the universe that can be cut multiple times and still contain a complete likeness of the original. Then we need to look at the anonymous Flying Roll XX, The Elementary f/iew of Man, which brings up the Kabbalistic diagram of the parts of the soul which is taught in the Outer Order. The physical body is in Malkuth along with the N ephesh, the"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"IqNG OVER.Jhe W.A TEI\\. next body, the Ruach covers the next five spheres on the Tree of Life, and then there is the spiritual body the Neshamah, crowned by the Yechidah. We have some confusing attributions as to what part of the Soul the Sphere of Sensation is comprised. The Macrocosm Man paper implies that the whole of the spiritual body of man, from Neshamah to Nephesh is the sphere. Other papers claim that only the Nephesh is included. However, it is fa irly clear that if the Sphere ofSensation is an actual object it must be predominantly made up of an individual's Ruach. Its connection with the realm of higher divine spirit comes from Tiphareth. Flying Roll XX claims that these higher spiritual fo rces actually have a link to the physical body - the Neshamah to the head, Daath to the throat and Yechidah to the crown- and then seemingly contradicts itself by saying \"spiritual conscious­ness does not partake of the physical body but is the light which radiates. The way in which thought proceeds is by radiation, that is to say, its rays are thrown vibrating through this sphere of As­tral Light.\" This can only mean one thing. The Sphere of Sensa­tion does not include any direct spiritual content and only links to the higher parts of the body symbolically. It also does not include the physical body either, although later we will discover that it has links between them. There is another problem. The Macroco1m and Man paper implies that the Sphere of Sensation must be connected to the Nephesh. Certainly it has elements that are Nephesh-like. It behaves automatically and fairly passively. However, that could equally be said of the Gu'ph, and yet the Sphere of Sensation is supposed to be packed with the memories of everything, Akasha, and have links to every point in the universe, something that the Nephesch cannot do because of its limited fo cus on the individual animal vehicle. It is worthwhile remembering that like the Sphere of Sensation, the Ruach's activities are not seen by most people, who are only dimly aware of its potential. Linking the Sphere of Sensation with the Ruach creates in­teresting correspondences which I have been playing with fo r some years. The word Ruach has strong Kabbalistic links with the Hebrew word fo r \"stone,\" Eben, which ifbroken down means Fa-"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"NICI(F.Al(R.§LL )19 ther!Son. It also links the idea that humanity was meant to be an astral creature and that the Ruach was as cl ose to a psychical body as we were expected to have. The Ruach is then the stone that was cast down. If it is purified then it may be returned to Eden and Father and Son will become one. This is the goal of the Theurgist. If you redeem your Sphere of Sensation then you are helping to redeem all those parts of the universe in which it has a connection. The Ruach is controlled from Tiphareth, the place where CRC is in his tomb. This will become more important later. In the ideal person, the Sphere of Sensation would contain all the virtues of the middle five spheres of the Tree of Life. It would reflect the world of divine ideas and bring these into mani­fe station. Unfortunately, because of the Fall, humanity is blinded by the world ofMalkuth and the activities of the Nephesh. Most people's Spheres of Sensation are tuned to looking towards the physical world and reflect that accordingly. Some of this attune­ment is caused by the process ofbirth. \\Vhen a person is born the Sphere of Sensation is orientated by the planetary and zodiacal energies of their natal chart. When a baby is born, the first view of the universe is based on its astrological chart. The rising sign is in the East, the Mid-heaven above and the descendant behind. It is centred on the position of the pole star. However, there is some confusion here between the MicrocoJln and Man, the writings of Westcott and the Cromlech Aura papers. The later writings say that the Sphere of Sensation is orientated to Regulus rather than the Ascendant. The angels of the Shem ha-Mephoresh are likewise split into angels of the day and night and this state of affairs is represented in the tarot Key 21 which shows the influence of these angels and the planets in the Sphere of Sensation. In Key 21 of the Golden Dawn Te mple Deck the Shem ha-Me­phoresh in the Sphere of Sensation is shown as Celtic knotwork. Note the positioning of the pillars in Hathor's hands and the fact that the Shem ha-Mephoresh contact the outer shell of the Sphere of Sensation. This depicts much of what happens to the Candi­date's Sphere of Sensation during the @=[QJ ceremony. The po­sitioning of Hathor's fe et represents the circumambulations; the Hexagram over her womb represents the higher selfbetween the pillars.

Mathers, in Microcosm and Man, believes that the Sphere of Sensation does not turn. It is not clear why he was so emphatic about this. Indeed, if the Sphere of Sensation does not revolve it disobeys much about what we know about spiritual and physical objects. It is my belief that he might have gotten this wrong. It is possible that Mathers was trying to say that since the Microcosm mirrors the Macrocosm it must be still, but now we tend to see the universe as always in motion, so the Microcosm should be seen as moving too. If the Sphere of Sensation did not revolve then a per­son's view of the universe would be fr ozen. It seems more likely that the Sphere of Sensation revolves as a result of the magnetic pull ofits poles. This causes ideas to change and some symbols become more important during one phase of a person's life over another. The Sphere of Sensation is connected to the animal self or the Nephesh and fr om there it controls the physical body and the physical environment. The Sphere of Sensation, when viewed psychically, is col­oured because the seer looks at the outer shell of it first. As we have mentioned earlier, these are the colours of the Macrocos­mic constellations. A skilled seer would be able to pierce this and see into the microcosmic colour range too. Truly gifted psychics would be able to make out prominent symbols in a person's life; they might also be able to make out what Shemesh describes as veins of symbols that make highways through the sphere. These are collections of symbols that lead by association to craft a per­son's inner kingdom. Modern psychology calls these complexes. They may be good or bad, but build up a person's spiritual, mental and physical personality. \\Ve are born fa cing the wrong way. We start life facing na­nue and the animal self(Nephesh) in Malkuth. The pathology of our birth means we face our Ascendant rather than our Sun sign. This means our loyal servant, our Sphere of Sensation, shows us a distorted vision of the Universe. Our lives are based on incorrect perceptions based on clouded understandings of the symbols. We often see symbols, but can only see them in a glass darkly. Soon optimism gives way to depression, the small becomes large, and our view becomes narrow and clouded. In addition, people fo rm"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"NICJ(F.Al(RfiLL pi links with others through shared magnetism and corrupted sym­bols. Their Spheres of Sensation become linked and Akashic en­ergy becomes depleted. As people age they become more fixed and are unable to see the new universe which is being born around them. Instead they either keep symbols of their own universe, or just live their lives as they always have done. In such circumstances the higher aspects of the personality lose their ability to influence the Sphere of Sensation and the person finally dies. The @=[ill ritual cleans out the Sphere of Sensation and to place new symbols inside it so that they can bring about an Al­chemical transformation of the Candidate. So in Z3 the officers are instructed to see the Candidate's Sphere ofSensation as being dark, and gradually, as the consecrations and purifications take place, becoming clearer. They are also told to visualise a Tree of Life projected onto a sphere within the Candidate's Sphere. Again this is providing the Candidate with a symbol of a perfected im­age. This symbol will slowly work to bring balance to the Candi­date as their work in the Order progresses. With the Sphere of Sensation activated, the Candidate is bought to the fo ot of the altar, but something else happens first; the Hegemon, holding the Mitre-headed Sceptre, attracts a fo rm of the Higher Self of the Candidate. This implies that the Higher Self is something that is separate from the person, but operates on a higher plane - in a normal person their Higher Self effectively sits on a cloud and watches, only becoming interested when they do something important. This is not quite true, but fo r practical purposes it might as well be. The Higher Self dwells within the person, but the personality is a lot bigger than many give it credit, but most people do not extend their consciousness towards the heavenly realms and so never encounter their Higher conscious­ness. The @=[ill initiation is exactly the sort of event which will draw the attention of the Higher Self as, in the long term, to give it a more direct role in a person's life. But the action of the Higher Self creates a mirror effect from the lower aspect of the Candidate. When the Higher Self moves down the levels, the Lower Self, realising that it will lose control, rises up. This is not necessarily an evil fo rce, but certainly acts as one. It is the fo rce that tries to keep the Candidate the same.

The Lower Self uses all its powers to try and stop this happening. Firstly the student forgets, the next they find that they get sick, and finally friends come to visit, or children start to misbehave. This is one of the reasons correspondence courses are harder fo r students, because they have to overcome this Lower Self with self-discipline. Mathers says that there is a clear image of the Candidate's Higher Self on one side of the altar hovering above the Lower Self. The Candidate kneels before the altar. Effectively their per­sonality is now divided into three aspects by the ritual. But this causes a fo urth aspect to dislodge - the Neshamah or unconscious. This flows towards the Higher Self, but is then drawn between the pillars. Psychically it can be seen as a shadow of the person which is thrown fo rward and is at the doors of the Temple. The effect on the Candidate is one of total disorientation. In­deed, if the Candidate can confidently speak at this point, there is something wrong. Particularly as at this point the 42 godforms of the assessors ofMaat are activated. The 42 Assessors, who are mentioned in the Book of the Dead, were impartial judges and jury fo r Maat. Each of them had a ques­tion to ask the newly dead soul. These were called negative con­fe ssions because the soul had to answer by denying they had done them. These are fo rces of Cosmic Justice as opposed to human justice and are not lightly evoked. Over the years I have ex peri­mented with these particular fo rces and have come to the conclu­sion that they create results which are \"right\" rather than what you think might be correct. The act of calling them also causes the whole temple to be judged. In my view this is one of the reasons that many new Golden Dawn groups die quickly. If you start a group with the idea of making your ego powerful and then call up the 42 assessors as part of a @=[Q] then you will find their power is judging you also. Mathers does not say where the 42 assessors are, but in my experience they fo rm a circle around the boundaries of the temple. The 42 assessors are also the fo rces which enforce the Oath and project energy at the Candidate."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"N!Cl(F.Al(R.§LL If that were not complicated enough, the image ofThoth is also projecting his energy at the Candidate's Neshamah. The pil­lars and the scales ofMaat are weighing his soul to see ifhe or she will be an acceptable member of the Order. Mathers says that under this intense pressure, the Human Will of the Candidate makes a decision. \"Rarely in his lifetime hath he been nearer the condition of death than at the moment when he standeth before the Altar, just before taking the Obligation of a Neophyte; seeing that he as though disintegrated into his compo­nent parts,\" z3 says. This is the consent to take the Obligation of Secrecy and the rest of the Oath. The moment the Will has spoken the Hiero­phant, who is an aspect of Osiris moves between the pillars and thus brings his godform into contact with the candidate's Ne­shamah. He then moves fo rward to step on the Lower Self of the Candidate, fo rcing it into the inner reaches of the unconscious. He replaces the evil side of the personality with Aroueris, which holds it in check. This motif is repeated in the CD=[iQ]. The next thing that happens is another aspect of Golden Dawn magic. This is that the use of godforms create lines of fo rce which build symbols on the floor. In this case it is a white triangle created by the Hiereus, the Hegemon and the Hierophant. This creates a triangle of white light which is similar to a triangle of the art, which allows the white triangle of the Three Supernals on the Altar to be burnt into the Sphere ofSensation. The Candidate places his left hand in that ofhis Initiator, as affirming his passive reception of the ritual, and his right hand upon the white triangle as symbolising his active aspiration towards his \"Higher Self.\" Mathers does not say what the Heirophant is do­ing during the Oath, but he has his wand raised connecting it to the thought-form of the candidate's Higher Self. The Oath is one of the hardest things fo r the Candidate to do in the ritual. They are under intense ritual pressure and divided. If the Heirophant is any good they should also be making it dif­ficult fo r the Candidate to emphasise this disconnected state. The Candidate should be desperately looking fo r the words while at the same time being unable to remember any of them as their Ne­shamah, which looks after memory, is disconnected and between"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"l(!NG OVEJ(fhe W.A TEJ(, the pillars at the time. Once the Oath is said and Thoth, Metatron and the 42 acces­sors give the Sign of Silence, the Higher Self descends to the In­visible Station of Harpocrates where it receives energy fr om that godform. This is an interesting part of the ritual. While many see the Higher Self as something sacrosanct or even perfect, Z3 im­plies that it has something to learn from the ritual if it is going to be linked to the body of an occultist as opposed to that of a natu­ral human. The station of Harpokrates is where it is reminded of its mission on Earth to learn what it can. The Harpokrates fo rce is expressed in Key o, The Fool. The Lower Self's function is transmuted by all this. \\Vhile it is under the fe et of Aroueris it learns to be the avenger or enforc­er of the gods.

This link is sometimes missed during the initiation because it is not im­mediately obvious, but it is actually the point where the Higher Self and the incarnated personality agree to work together. 42 assessors in the Judgement Hall of Maat The Candidate is then placed in the North, the place of great­est symbolic darkness; but it is hear that Osiris speaks in the dark­ness to the candidate and begins their spiritual journey together."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"NICJ(F.Al(R.§LL j2) Osiris is taking the role of the Candidate's l-Iigher Self. This pro­vides teaching which I was told long before joining the Golden Dawn. It is a quirk of human nature to not be aware of their own divinity. They will fashion gods and worship them rather than ac­knowledge that they are part of the god which created heaven and earth. Rather than work against that difficulty, occultism uses it as a tool which can be jettisoned when the time is right. Thus the Candidate hears the voice of their Higher Selfin the fo rm ofOsi­ns. Then we have a Circumambulation in the Path of Darkness. From the perspective of the candidate this part of the ritual rep­resents their spiritual progress. Not only does it present to them the symbols which they will need to use as part of this quest, but also will show the Order how it will go fo r them. For example a candidate which does not trust their guide to lead them will find that this attitude manifests in their life. In one case on the second circuit a candidate fe ll and knocked over the white pillar and never made it into the Second Order. The circumambulation has the same effect on the Candidate's Sphere of Sensation that it had on temple during the Opening. It is supposed to bring down the white triangle of the Three Super­nals. As the party passes the Hierophant strikes s the floor to rep­resent the powers of Mercy while the Hie reus hits the floor once fo r Severity. This draws power fr om the floor and into the Sphere of the Candidate. The noise often causes them them to jump, but it is to programme them to fe el something is wrong if they go to extremes. As the party passes, the Invisible Assessors give each the \"Sign of the Enterer,\" which indicates that throughout their life they will be tested before they are able to carry on. The first circumambulation is to do with the material level. The second is the astral and the Kerux bars the Candidate's ap­proach to the West. Mather said this was because the Natural Man cannot obtain the understanding of even the Son of Osiris without more purification and equilibrium. Therefore again is the Candi­date consecrated with Water and Fire, and the Pillars about his Sphere ofSensation become clearer. After this second consecration the hoodwink is slipped up and"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"KJNG OVEI\\Jhe W.A TER..._ the candidate is given lessons. The first thing that a person needs to understand is what they must overcome fe ar. On the astral plane like attracts like. If you fe ar then the first thing you encounter will be what you fe ar. \\Ve have fo und is that under the assault of the Hiereus many candidates back off, a gain warning the Order of troubles to come as their fe ars start to manifest. On the third circuit the candidate is entering the spiritual realm and the region of the G)=ffil Again they are barred and need fu rther consecration and purification. The hoodwink is again slipped up as giving a still fu rther glimpse of the Nature of the Divine Light. Here the Candidate's Sphere ofSensation gets a di­rect blast of the Osiris energy, which provides them with the mo­mentum to get out of the path of darkness. The vision is imperfect because the Candidate only sees it as a Light dimly seen through the Darkness. Magically the Hierophant is doing something else. So far all the purifications and consecreations have been to build the fo ur pillars, but there is a fifth pillar which is the most important yet to be built. This fifth pillar is the middle pillar that unites all of them. Once this happens the Candidate can pass to the Altar of the Universe, which is the hidden third pillar between the black and white. This middle pillar will become the altar of incense in the next grade. The fo llowing point was very different from the later Golden Dawn. In the Stella Matutina, the Hieropant would come down between the pillars saying, \"I come in the power ofLight, I come in the Light of \\Visdom, I come in the Mercy of the Light, the Light hath healing in its \\Vings.\" He then would say the prayer fo r the Neophyte's fu ture. But in the early Golden Dawn and the .AO this iconic speech was lacking. Instead, the Hierophant leaves his throne and pass­es between the pillars. He either halts there during the prayer or halts at the place ofHarpocrates, the Evil Triad, or East of the Al­tar. Mathers felt that some Candidates would need more of their Lower Self suppressed, while others would need more of a divine awakening. The Kerux (Anubis) and the Stolistes and Dadouchos (aspects ofMaat) fo rm a triangle in the \\Vest, which indicates that the Can-"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"NJC I(F.AR.._ R.§LL )27 didate has passed the Judgement of the Balance. Horus, Maar and Aroueris fo rm a triangle completing the fo rmation of the Triad of the Supernals. And the Higher Self of the Candidate moves to behind the Hierophant. The Hierophant gives a single stroke to seal the matter. Interestingly Mathers had the hoodwink removed at this point, but the later Golden Dawn did not remove the blindfold until a little later. The Hierophant, Hiereus, and Hegemon join Sceptres and Sword above the Candidate's head, fo rmulating the Supernal Tri­ad, and asserting that they receive him into the Order and they re­cite the Mystic Words as sealing the current of the Flowing Light. The triangle of the Order is burnt into the Candidate's Sphere of Sensation at this point. Many believe that the work of the initiation is done at this point. Indeed the Candidate often relaxes. But as Mathers points out, the Higher Self remains in the Station of Harpocrates, and while there a gleaming white triangle is fo rmulated above and touching the fo rehead of the Candidate. The ritual is not finished. The Hierophant says that so fa r his journey has been made with the light of the Kerux going before him without his knowl­edge. It represents to him a vague fo rmulation of his ideal, but which he can neither grasp nor analyse. Now it is time to see the divine with the blindfold off. The candidate is placed on the evil triad to affirm that he will cast out and trample upon the evil persona, which then will become a support to him. This is why the Hiereus gives him the secret signs, etc., of the grade and places him fo r the first time between the pilla rs, where he receives the final consecration. The goal of the Outer Order is to overthrow the lower persona and his ally in this is the Hiereus, who is the embodiment of the Black Pil­lar.

This moment is when the initiation takes place by virtue of this Supernal Triad wh ich is formed. \"The Candidate now therefore is standing between the Pillars bound with the rope, like the mummied form of Osiris between Isis and Nephthys.\" This, in my view, is a crucial observation to understanding the @=[Q] initiation.

While this is happening the N ephesh and the Higher Self are rejoined to the Candidate. Mathers adds that this final consecration is also commanded by Horus, which still menaces the evil persona of the Candidate, so that it seals the Four Pillars in the Sphere of Sensation of the Candidate in a balanced way. Mt erwards the Hierophant commands the removal of the rope so that he is no longer restricted, and he is invested with the badge of the white triangle of the Three Supernals fo rmulating in darkness. Again Mathers emphasises the Ancient Egyptian fo rumla of the raising of Osiris. \"As this Badge is placed upon him, it is as though the two Great Goddesses, Isis and Nephthys, in the places of the Columns stretched fo rth their Wings over the fo rm ofOsi­ris to restore him again to life.\" There is another Mystic Circumambulation. This is to prepare the Candidate fo r fu ture initiations. As he passes the Hierophant's Throne, the Red Calvary Cross is astrally fo rmulated above the Astral White Triangle upon his fo rehead. This opens the way fo r the Candidate to start to understand the image of self-sacrifice, which will ultimately take him to the Calvary Cross before the Vault of the Adepts. The Higher Soul returns to the Invisible Station of Har­pocrates, but now it has a link to the Candidate and will have a direct influence on his life. But there is a little bit of the initiation still to be carried out. Anubis pours the fluids of Mars and Venus together to form the semblance ofBlood. This is intended to fix in the Candidate's at­mosphere the Symbols of the Forces ofTransmutation ofNature, and also to make an Astral Link between this and the Candidate's physical life, as a guard of the Secrecy of the Mysteries, and this particular fo rm of transmutation is used to show the effect of a mixture of fo rces as producing a third appearance totally different from them. \"And the Red colour is symbolic of the Blood of the Can­didate, and in the Ancient Mysteries the Candidate's Blood was actually drawn at this portion of the Ceremony, and preserved as"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"))0 f\\!NGOVER.Jhe W.A TEJ( an Avenging Link in case of his proving unworthy,\" Mathers says.

Commentary"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"NICJ(F.AR.l(§LL This particular document was written after Mathers' death and appears to be an attempt to return to the more magical approach of the Z documents. Magically, it is fa r behind the oral teaching which was being given out in Stella Matutina temples during the same period, or the Z documents which they were supposed to explain themselves. Generally, the notes are interesting and must have sparked ideas amongst those who received them, particularly if they had been released to those who could not really undestand what the Z documents were doing. The conclusion is that the @=[Q] ritual was magical and things had to be done fo r magical reasons. The writer appeared to believe that most of the work of the @=[Q] was do do with the fo rmulation of the Supernal Trian­gle within the Candidate. While this is true, it is only a fraction of the magic which takes place. Some of the document's conclusions don't actually work. For example, the \"Triple cord means the restriction of nature. Triple is in reference to the white triangle of the Supernals.\" The ritual talks about how the threefold cord binds the once happy soul to the material. If the cord had anything to do with the white triangle of the Supernals, it would be a good thing and never be taken off, which is what symbolically happens in the final phase of the @=[Q] ritual. The number three appears in more places in the @=[Q] than the triangle on the altar. In this case it is more likely to indicate the three circumambulations which must be walked before the Candi­date meets their Higher Self. Once these circumambulations are carried out then the three fold cord is loosened, the Candidate is redeemed, and the Higher Self is in permanent contact with the Sphere ofSensation of the Candidate. Another comment about the hoodwink \"shows that the light of the material world is but a darkness compared to the Divine Light. The preparation represents a certain temporary limita­tion and binding of the material body\" is only partly correct. The hoodwink shows that the candidate is blinded by ignorance and this results in them stumbling in darkness. This darkness is also shown in their Sphere of Sensation before they are purified and consecrated, something that was revealed in the first Z documents. It is not a \"temporary binding,\" but shows the natural state of any"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"l(fNG OVER.Jhe Tf/.ATEJ( human before the initiation process. It is also the first alchemi­cal stage of the blackening where the unconscious waters rise and purification begins. The description of the Oath lacks a mention of the 42 asses­sors and Maat godforms which are active during this time. If this document were fo llowed, the magical judgement is made by the will of the Candidate's own Higher Self before the Oath is taken, which is alien to the Z documents and confuses consent with ac­tual judgement. The Z documents are clear that judgement takes place during the Oath and the 42 assessors are blasting the Candi­date with their own energy at various times in the initiation. There is also the somewhat strange conclusion that the Mys­tic Circumambulation is led by the Kerux with symbolic light showing that the Higher Soul is not the only Division of Light but rather a spark fr om it. The Mystic Circumambulation does no such thing and it is hard to see how you could make this conclu­sion. The Kerux is the guide and the light is the secret wisdom which guides the Candidate. The Circumambulation is the eso­teric life of the Candidate. They are two symbols but they do not add up to the logical statement that the \"Higher Soul is not the only Division of Light but rather a spark fr om it.\" The comment that the Kerux bars the way in the West to show that Natural Law cannot sustain the understanding of the Son of Osiris unless by purification and consecration is an incred­ible weakening of what is going on at this point. The Candidate is barred because, like in the CD=Oill, they are headed towards the path of darkness and evil. Their Sphere of Sensation is about to encounter the Heireus and all they fe ar. This would overcome them if their Sphere of Sensation was not purified and consecrat­ed. This document says the stick is only removed fo r a moment to allow fo r purification and consecration. This is \"bad ritual\" be­cause it sends the unconscious message that it is possible to move before the purification and consecration. In Whare Rg the Candi­date was blocked and held until the purification and consecration was completed. This is because the Kerux was holding the wand by the red band and moving them fr om the waters of putrefaction, or salt stage, to the fires of calcification, or sulphur stage.

These create a microcosmic resonance to the macrocosmic Supernals, but the fo cus of the ritual, at this point, remains within the Can­didate's Sphere of Sensation, which is below the Supernal Triad. The rest of the notes follow the traditional pattern and are correct, but incomplete. It seems to take the mistaken view that the magic bit stops after the white triangle is placed in the Candi­date's Sphere of Sensation. This is a mistake which many modern Golden Dawn groups make, thinking that the the fo urth and final consecration and all the talking afte rwards happens as an after­thought. In fa ct, much of the significant fu sing of the Candidate to their Higher Self takes place when they are placed between the pillars, fa cing the Heirophant.

Firstly, the paper lacks the introduction, and secondly it does not provide any details about how the temple is to be set up.

The version of the ritual outlined in Regardie's The Golden Dawn is providing details that the Nisi version is lacking. Regardie reminds the magician that they should do the adoration. Mathers did not think it was necessary. Like Regardie, this ritual shows some interesting use of the Lotus Wand. It would appear that you only use the coloured parts of the Lotus Wand when you are drawing Supreme Hexagrams and not the Lesser Hexagrams. De­spite the fact that you are invoking Mars, you use the white band and not the Mars band. This is sometimes fo rgotten by modern Golden Dawn magicians, who tend to grab the Lotus \\Vand by the coloured bands at the smallest sniff of planetary power. When you have finished, you perform the L VX signs and not the Analysis of the Keyword. This means that Mathers had not made a link between powering the \"broken\" hexagram using the LVX fo rmula and Analysis of the Keyword. The GD was the first known group to draw such symbols in the air; its fo unders believed that the symbol itself was enough to do any work you wanted to do. Later the symbol was seen like an el ectric circuit which is pow­ered up by the calling down of the Light. In Whare lVJ doing one without the other was seen as meaningless. The CD=[iQ] sign is directed towards the place where the Mars hexagram will be placed. This is to attract the planetary fo rce to its most material level and is a nice use of the grade sign. The angels called during the invocation are more or less what would be included in the Stella Matutina version of the ritual. Sa­mael has become Zamael, which I suspect is a copyist error or an effort to dissociate from the Qlippothic Sammael. It seems that Nisi was reading the Hebrew given and transliterated it in an unu­sual manner. He does this throughout his work, giving Arathetha rather than the more normal ARARITA. This is because the name is a translation of a Hebrew phrase and Nisi just spelt it out as a name. Arathetha may also be the way they pronounced the word rather than Ar-ar-ee-ta. The early G D papers often have is spelt the same way. The invocation is different from the version given in Regardie and also the one identified as an early Golden Dawn version by Pat Zalewski in his Ta lismans and Evocations ofthe Golden Dawn. For"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"NI Cl(EAJ(RJ'-LL this reason it might be earlier than both and might be an .A 0 vari­ant. If it is an.AO version then it is incredibly disappointing, as the versions shown by Zalewski and Regardie are superior in terms of poetry and fo rce. The Zalewski version of the ritual gives a clue why so many variants would come about. His version suggests that the invo­cation to Mars should be written by the magician. So as a result we might be looking at Nisi's own frankly disappointing version, while the Zalewski text was written by someone with a little more imagination. The sigils are strangely laid out, but would appear to be the traditional ones using the Rose. Nisi appears to be allowed to styl­ise them a lot more than many Golden Dawn orders would allow. Despite some good things, the ritual of the Magical Sword is lacking. It seems to have sprung out of a corpus with no regard to the rest of the system. It is even worse than the ritual fo r the consecration ofElemental Weapons, which suffers from a similar problem. In some ways it is not really Mathers' fault. The con­secration of the magic sword would be one of the first \"serious\" pieces of magic a Golden Dawn student would have done other than the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram. Mathers seemed to think that the making and charging of magical equipment was a good starting point fo r the student. I would have thought that there were other, better places to start, as it takes more than the weap­on and a quick ritual to charge any implement successfully. But Mathers could have told the new G>=lliJ to make their tools and consecrate them once they had mastered the Z documents. This would have created a much better magical tool.

There are very fe w modern orders that do not lean on the Order in some way. One of the things that made the Golden Dawn unique was the eclectic way that it gathered a wide range of esoteric material and linked it together into a system. This symbolic system is so detailed that it is almost impossible to remove something fr om it without endangering the system somewhere else. Common sense dictates it would take a genius to come up with a system that deep. You need a visionary who can see where all the pieces fit and make sure that there are papers available to students that explain your vision. There are two obvious candidates fo r this genius - the fo unders \\Villiam \\Vestcott and Samuel Mathers. Mathers in particular gets the most backing.

As we have seen, there are holes in this argument. Firstly, people have assumed that the Golden Dawn in which Mathers was involved was the same one that we know today. Secondly, they be­lieve that he wrote most of the material, and lastly that he person­ally used his own system. Even Ellie Howe in his Magicians of the Golden Daw11 dismisses Westcott as a simple administrator, while Mathers was a \"magician personified.\" Yet history is stuck with the fact that Mathers is an unreliable genius who did not demonstrate his skill until later in the story. Writing the rituals from the Cypher Manuscript was not exactly rocket science and the early Golden Dawn was very much a quasi­Masonic order. Yet fo r a brief period of three years or so after Mathers went to Paris something unique was created. The Outer Order rituals were transformed into something deep, original and magical. The Second Order was fo rmed based around a unique piece of magical equipment- the Vault . But then it stopped. The man who it was said could knock out a set ofTarot cards in a fe w hours suddenly seemed unable to write anything useful. To make matters worse, his own order, the .AO,was not able to recreate that magical power again. In this book the history and some of the original documents of Mathers' .AO are revealed. \\Vhile there is some new material within them, Mathers also re­veals a shocking disregard fo r basic ritual practice and his own Z documents. \\Ve have seen how \"short cuts\" were allowed, which Mathers believes are safe to perform.

It is not clear what the fe e was fo r a G)=@l, but it is certain that there was no rite performed and it appeared that it was simply one of Mathers' methods of milking money from his temples. The temptation would be to say that, having created the G:l=lli] papers, the genius of the Golden Dawn did not need to do any more. But if you look at the Z documents, it is fa irly obvi­ous that they have never been finished. The opening of the @=[ill in Z1 needs expanding, Z2 is half finished and needs to cover all fo rms of magic. Z3 misses important magical techniques which were left fo r Mathers' successors to finish off. Then there was the matter of the higher grades. Felkin did better with two rather good rituals, but weak teaching. Paul Fos­ter Case, who was never that happy with the <3:l=ffil level of the Order, refused to provide material beyond that grade out of pol­icy, but Mathers had implied that it should be there. The question was: what should the @=[3] and G:l=[±J be doing? Many of the modern Golden Dawn orders have answ ered this question by providing more intellectual information. One has suggested that the answer is Alchemy, another optimistic person wanted to see more sex magic, another thinks that we should be looking fo r inner meanings to magic squares. Whare % taught that the ®=[3] was more of a mystical grade than the G:l=lliJ and the work of the grade was to use the lessons of the G:l=lliJ to find your own spiritual path. Certainly the approach to this grade was much more trans per­sonal than the <3:l=ffiJ. In addition to Goetic work and some other experimental systems, the fo cus of the grade appears to be using greater magic fo r the good ofhumanity.

Given this slips down to what your definition of magic is, it is probably best explained by using mine as an example. Magic is the art and science ofbecoming a co-creator with God. Instead of using that science, you are a living example of it in action. This can be said to be the goal of the grade as the jump between this state and the @=[3] is high.

The @=[3] is easier in that its goal is slightly more familiar -use magic at bigger targets. The training must be how you manage this.

The (])=[±] is the last stab that the Golden Dawn system has of training anyone anything and this is one region which requires serious research from the next genera­tion ofGolden Dawn orders. Mathers, Westcott, Felkin and Case fa iled to manage it. While we work to create more intellectual sys­tems to fill that gap, so will we. While we teach that all we need is a new system incorporating Alchemy, sex magic, or Macrame, we fall fu rther fr om what these higher grades mean.

When Mathers started the Golden Dawn project, it appears that the universe backed him. He fo und a magical partner, he was given an income to continue work and could have done so. He appears to have managed to get an extremely good channelling contact to bring through some ad­vanced material and bring it together in an eclectic manner. He had the right people around him to help. It did not even matter that he was based in Paris. But being a l(,lng over the Water is only a good idea if you are humble enough to see that you are helping the Universe's schemes and not your own. Mathers had a deep desire to be something im­portant and fantastic. When he was in Paris he fell in with a crowd who re-enforced that fantasy and told him that it would be pos­sible. Many esoteric people during that period were falling fo r Right Wing, synarchic thought. It basically said that the world would be put to right if you had a fe w more occultists in charge of things. Mathers was offered a little part of Scotland ifhe followed them. But the political views of the likes of Papus were deeply unpleasant and would ultimately lead to the creation of the Vichy government, before it was finally expelled from polite French so­ciety. The fact that Mathers gave himself to these various schemes inflated his ego to the point that he became unstable. It polluted his thought processes so much that he was not able to make the same magical contacts he had before. Not only did the money dry up suddenly, but he was expelled by other magicians who no long­er respected him. He was so locked up in his fantasy during the revolt that Aleister Crowley's universe seemed sane. Thus we see masked and kilted figur es gaining possession of the Vault while fe nding off magical attacks from an American conwoman in the Battle ofBlythe Road. Mter his expulsion from the Golden Dawn, his .AO was a shadow of what had been created in the older period. It seems that he saw it as a money making exercise, as did Mina when she took over the Order. There is something within the Golden Dawn which makes chiefs who attempt to use it to make money meet a sticky end. In the 199os there was one group which tried to set up the a modern cult using the Golden Dawn as a template. Need­less to say that while it managed to damage people, like any other"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"NJCJ(FAJ(R.f,LL mystical cult, it did not survive long as a money making exercise fo r its fo unders. So in running that Golden Dawn to prop up his lifestyle, both Samuel and Mina were setting themselves against the very spirit of the Order. Those who came after Mathers realised the inheritant weak­ness within the AO and tried to plug the gaps, particularly after Mina Mathers followed her husband to the Otherworld and re­moved the last conservative block in the Order. But by then it re­ally was too late, the world got in the way and the Second \\Vorld War put an end to his branch of the Golden Dawn tree. Seeing a dead end in the Mathers' lineage, other Golden Dawn groups have looked to Westcott to \"be the genius\" who fo unded their order. Certainly Westcott provided a lot of addi­tional intellectual information and interpretation of the Golden Dawn system. As we have seen, while it was Mathers who designed the Vault, it was Westcott who provided the intellectual frame­work of the Book of the Tomb. More of Westcott's writings have come to light, particularly his creation of a three dimensional Enochian system, which is examined by Sandra Tabatha Cicero in The Book of the Co11course of the Watchtowers. It was \\Vestcott's idea to bring Enochian Chess into the Second Order. While it is true that the Order would not have existed without Westcott and his knowledge, most of the magical developments were done without him. Neither can it be claimed that Mathers and \\Vestcott were a particularly good double act, spending a good part of their lives distrusting and hating each other. While the same thing could be said of John Lennon and Paul McCartney, those two were a lot closer fr iends fo r a lot longer than Mathers and \\Vestcott. Westcott was different from Mathers in many ways. He was running two orders, several side orders and held down a proper job. However, that is not saying that \\Vestcott was the genius of the Golden Dawn either. He did not write the Cypher Manuscript, nor did he write the rituals. He was the administrative expert who made it all happen, and when he wanted he could show how clever he was. But he didn't. He believed that Mathers was contacted by the right people, seen or unseen, and even joined Mathers' AO with the same powers that he had under the old Golden Dawn. It"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"))0 IqNG Of/El(Jhe W.A TEJ( is clear, however, that if the Golden Dawn had been left to these two, it would have remained a M asonic style order with a spice of magic. Somehow the Golden Dawn became much more than that. The rebels, under Felkin, and the .AO, under John Brodie­Innes, took it in another direction. Under both these people, each symbol was examined and re-examined. That which became a sim­ple gesture had many meanings, nothing in an initiation could be dropped (literally or figuratively). Inspired by the symbols that were first revealed by Westcott and Mathers, rebel Morgan Rothe adepts, who probably included Brodie-Innes and Felkin, rewrote the rituals to the state that we know them today. Brodie-Innes would later return to the Mathers ones when he took over his .AO, but would bring the same magical ideas into that order that impressed Dion Fortune and her teacher Maiya Tranchell-Hayes. Later, Fortune would complete her magi­cal training in Felkin's Stella Matutina and apply the lessons she learned in her system. This Inner Light tradition would have great impact on many modern magicians, creating something particu­larly magical and unique. \\Vhen this phase of the Golden Dawn died out in 1978 with the closure of Whare R.g in New Zealand, it opened again, this time in Georgia, to enable modern thought to be in corporated. So who then was the genius of the Golden Dawn ifit was not the King over the Water, or \\Vestcott, or any of their fo llowers? The answer to that question requires a magical definition of what a ge nius really is. In modern times the word has come to mean a clever person with exceptional intellectual ability or creativity. But an occultist uses the word to mean a person's guiding spir­it, often having a similar meaning to a Higher Self. For example many people assumed that the Ancient Romans worshipped their Emperors, when actually they offered sacrifices to their Genii. Mathers' CV=llil scrying revealed that the Golden Dawn had a triple aspect genius, or Angel, which oversaw its work. When this Angel was teaching it was called Heru. \\Vhen it was running the Order it was called Hua. It also had a secret name which reflected its connection to the Third Order. This was never revealed, but was probably Raphael."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"NICI(F.Al(R.§LL j)I It was this being that brought together the different aspects of the Golden Dawn, inspired Mckenzie to write the Cypher Manuscript, and inspired \\Vestcott to rescue them from his dust­bin and give them to Mathers to write up. It latter connected to Mathers who was inspired to build the Second Order and when the King over the Water became too unstable to work with, it moved on, passing its flame first to the rebels, later to Felkin and Brodie­Innes, then later to Case, Crowley and Dion Fortune. Finally it has been passed to the modern carriers of that torch: Pat and Chris Zalewski, Chic and Sandra Tabatha Cicero's Hermetic Order of the Goldm Dawn, Samuel Scarborough's Ordo Stella Matutina, and the Magical Order of the .Aurora .Aurea, and, I am sure, many more . The King of the \\Vater's mistake was always to fail to understand that he was just a spark in a flame which swept the occult scene and has never been extinguished and continues to inspire those who look fo r its type of magic. The genius of the Golden Dawn is there to motivate adepts and students to find links between a particular set of symbols and produce something so unique and magical that its fo unders would never have dreamed possible. Rather than looking to the past to find the genius of the Golden Dawn, we should be looking at the present. \\Vhat is with us now does not stop evolving and deepening.
