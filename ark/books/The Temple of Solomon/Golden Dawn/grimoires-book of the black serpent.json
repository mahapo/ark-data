The original essay, concerning the Qlippoth can be found in R.A.Gilbert's\"The Sorcerer and His Apprentice\" and Steve Savedow's \"Goetic Evocation - The Magician'sWorkbook Volume 2\". The following text was provided in Trident's edition of \"GrimoiriumVerum\", several additions have been made and some editing has taken place -- Phil] The Foundation of the Work.The operator of this, the Opus Majus, would do well to abstain from the companionship ofthe vulgar-minded during the time of the working and the three days preceding the actualexperiments. It is not needful to remain pure [or chaste] in this work, for it is the end of thiswork that all should be satisfied and without want. Let it suffice that one who conducts thiswork spend a goodly time in thought cogent to the work. It is important that whoever doesthis work takes the time to remove all obstacles which may interfere with the completion ofthe work; this is very important - for, if you cannot do the work in its entirety it is betternever to commence. The Instruments of the Art.The instruments of this Art are few, but must be acquired before you begin the convocationsof the spirits. These appurtenances may be constructed by the hands of the operator, orbought before the initiation of the experiments. In either case, the instruments should beconsecrated as to dedicate their use for the assistance in this operation. The instruments are asfollows. The configuration of the Temple.This temple is to measure fifteen feet square and may be constructed out of either stone orwood, as is preferred. There should be a window to allow light into the temple, as this is awork of the attainment of Light, and where there is no light there is only darkness, as we aretold. The ceiling of the temple should not be less than six feet high; both it and the ceilingshould be unadorned, unless there is a reason to do contrariwise. The magic Circle & Triangle of the Art."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The circle is to measure nine feet across. It may to be inscribed for either permanent or fortemporary use, and is to be adorned with these Names of God:EHIEH + JAH + vuvh ELOHIM + AL + ELOHIM GIBOR + vuvhELOAH VA-DAATH + vuvh TZABAOTH + ELOHIM TZABAOTH +SHADDAI EL-CHAI + ADONAI MELEKH +The triangle is to measure nine feet in equal measurement, thus nine feet in circumferance.Each of the three angles should be beset with these angelic names: ANAPHEXATON + PRIMEUMATON +TETRA- GRAMMATON. It is to be set down for either permanent or temporary use, as we have said before. The magical Weapons & Tools of the Art.The Book:It is agreeable to find a pen or quill which can be used for the time of working which youperform. The book is to be used to keep a record of the magick Actions and the prayers,invocations, rituals or sigils you will use in this operation. The book should be new,uninscribed by anyone else and should be consecrated for use as we have said. The Wand or Rod:This should be crafted from rosewood or cedar and should measure half the length of yourarm. It is to be used to trace the sigils of the Quarters which will be given in the second partof this monograph. It is to be marked with the Names of God which the angels will give youin the circle.The magical Knife:The knife must be new and sharp enough to cut easily, for this is to be its purpose. Its bladeshould be nomore than nine inches long and may be inscribed with these names: AGLA + vuvh + ON + ADONAI. The handle of the knife is to be fashioned using the same wood as was used for the rod of theArt. The ceremonial Robe:It must be constructed of Linen or some such material and is best when it is made by theoperator of this work. The robe may be fashioned with a hood and should be no longer thanyour ankles and the sleeves of which should be no longer than your wrists. An emblem maybe appropriate to some Actions and as with the holy names of the rod of the Art, these will begiven to you by God through his ministering angels."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" The Censur and Suffumigations:The types of perfumes and incenses and their qualities or purposes have been described inmany other books on the Royal Art of Magick, some falsely so and others truely.

It should never have been used for eating or any otherpurpose. As the operator of the aspersion exalts the water in prayers and blessings and thenbrings it low in aspersion, so does our Creator sanctify and bless the rain which begins by theSun's days over the seas.

The types of Spirits.The Qlipoth:"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The names of the servitors of the Qliphothic rulers are expressed as the Name of their rulergiven in extensio, each Name being the seed of a name of a subservient Order; thus Thamiel(ThAMAL) is served by Thadekiel, Abraxiel, Mahaziel, Azazael and Lufugiel and the rest ofthe crowns likewise in the same manner. The relationship between the Archdaemons and theQliphoth is that the Qliphoth rule on earth in temporal form and the Archdaemons rule theearth in a transcendent manner. One is visible and the other invisible. The invisible can becompelled to appear in divers shapes; as we will find out. Both the Archdaemons and theQliphoth are entirely evil and are only to be overcome by the aid of celestial powersand virtues, both visible and invisible, and so the pious man will have nothing to fear fromthese 'intelligences' but the unwise and impious man may already be the victim of theirassaults. The sustenance of these powers Infernal is fear and hence, if the magician is withoutfear these enemies of the Human race can have no power. The Archdaemons and Qliphothrely not on the existance of GOD to incarnate, but the denial of the existence of GOD - onlythrough willingly renouncing the Truth, the Living GOD or right action can these Spiritsbring a Human being to ruin.

They are to be called forth in the day and hour of their rule, or else theywill not do the magician service. Some of these Spirits demand a sacrifice of the magicianbefore they will honor the requests but it having been made they are amiable to the demandsmade. Each of these orders rule 490 leagues of Spirits except those ruled by Tagaririm,whose dominion is sevenfold that of the others. The QliphothThese be they who be unclean and evil, even the distortion and perversion of the Sephiroth:the fallen Restriction of the universe, the Rays of the coils of the stooping Dragon. Eleven aretheir classes, yet Ten are they called. Seven are the Heads, yet an Eighth ariseth. Seven arethe Infernal Palaces, yet do they include Ten. In the Tree of Life, by the Waters of the River, in the Garden of Wisdom, is the Serpent ofthe Paths; it is the Serpent in the Celestial Eden. But the Serpent of the Temptation is that ofthe Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, the antithesis and opposer of the other: the Redcoiled Stooping Dragon of the Apocalypse, the Serpent of the Terrestrial Eden. Regard thoutherefore the Celestial Serpent, as of Brass, glistening with Green and Gold, the Color ofVegetation and of growth: banish thou therefore the Evil and seek the Good. For as Moseslifted up the Serpent in the Wilderness, even so must the Son of Adam be lifted up,raised through the balance of strife and of trial, through the Pathway of Eternal Life. Andwhen, like our Master, thou art extended on that Tree, through suffering and through pain, letthy countenance be raised up towards the Light of the Holy One to invoke the DivineBrightness, not for thyself, but for those who have not yet attained to the Pathways, eventhough they be thy tormentors.Balanced between the Spiritual and the Material, the type of Reconciler, remember thesymbol of the Brazen Serpent. Mark thou well the difference between the two serpents, forbefore the Serpent of Brass of Numbers, the Serpent of Fire could not stand. But at the Fall,the Serpent of Evil arising in the Tree surrounded Malkuth, and linked her thus into the outerand the Qliphoth, for this is the Sin of the Fall, even the separation of the Material Plane fromthe Sephiroth through the interposition of the Coils of the Stooping Dragon. Thus, therefore,must Malkuth be cleansed, and this is the Redemption to come. Foralso Christ expiated not Sin till after he had overcome the Temptation. But surely all thingsin the Creation are necessary, seeing that one existeth not without the other, and the Evil alsohelpeth the Work, for thus the greater and more intense the Darkness, by so much more doththe Light become bright by Contrast and draweth, as it were, increased force from theBlackness.

In the midst of the circle are placed Samael and Asmodai. The symbolic form of the former issomewhat like that of the Devil of the Tarot, but colossal and attenuated; that of Asmodai isas a bloated, bestial man, but in a crouching position. At the South-East Angle are placed theEvil Adam, a goat-headed skeleton-like giant; and a thousand- headed Hydra Serpent; ever-changing and distorted countenance. At the North-East Angle is Aggerath, the daughter ofMachalath, a fiendish witch with serpent hair enthroned in a chariot drawn by an Ox and anAss. At the North-West Angle is a gigantic Scorpion with a fearfulcountenance, but standing upright as it were, and formed of putrefying water.

Of the Three Evil Forces behind SamaelThe first is Qematriel, whose form is that of a vast black, man-headed Dragon-serpent,and he united under him the force of Kether of the Infernal and averse Sephiroth. The second, a black, bloated Man-dragon, Belial, he denieth a God; and he uniteth theforces of the averse Chokmah. The third is Othiel or Gothiel, a black, bloated Man-insect, horrible of aspect, his brethgreater than his length: and he uniteth the force of the averse Binah. The fourth form is Samael the Black. All these are of gigantic nature and terribleaspect.

It is agreeable to first state that the Arch-daemons must be called in their time of dominion,or else they will not render themselves servicable to the magician. It is necessary that theoperator of these Actions prepare the place of working before attempting to call forth theArch-daemons, but this is not the case with the Qliphoth-they may be invoked or called forthwithout a place which has been arranged for them.The method of calling forth the Arch-daemons requires a fourfold operation, and that is, thefundamental prayer, the banishing of all malignant spirits, the invocation of the Arch-angels,and lastly, the evocation of the Arch-daemons. It is very important that no part of this be leftout, for that would surely lead you to ruin. The Arch-daemons may appear (at first) in aninvisible form. To make them become visible to the your eyes all that is necessary is to shedblood, either that of an animal, or that of a woman, or your own, and by and by, they willappear in their true form, as the blood gives them the power to take shapes, such as they are.Here follows the manner of invoking the Arch-angels, all the rest of this will be given untoyou by them: The Angelick Conjuration."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Begin this by reciting Ps LXII, CXLI, CIXX and LXXXVI.
