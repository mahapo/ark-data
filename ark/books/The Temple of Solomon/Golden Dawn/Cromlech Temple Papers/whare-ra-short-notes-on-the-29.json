Each Member had to attend all the Ceremonies, and correct his Ritual until it was perfect; he could not take another Grade until this was done. The words first spoken to the Candidate \"quit the material and seek the Spiritual\", give the key to the whole Ceremony. Learning no longer must be sought for material gain or advancement, no self‐seeking must Influence the Candidate in his search for the true wisdom. Anubis the Guardian leads the Aspirant from the material to the spiritual. The Sphinx of Egypt. There were other Sphinxes besides the Great Sphinx, one the syntheses of the Elements, Man Bull, Lion, Eagle, the goddess of Air, who drew back the veil which hid the rising Sun. The Soul asks for help, “Give me your hands, ye Lords of Truth, for I am made as ye.\" The soul claims kinship with the Spiritual helpers, as she came from the Spiritual Realm to incarnate in a material world, to transmute the material into the spiritual. The diagrams and speeches are full of names from many sources; it needs knowledge of ancient mythology and history to understand them. The Candidate should look them up, study and meditate upon them, to gain real knowledge of their meaning. The Jews had to go to Egypt to learn the ancient wisdom, and from the Hieroglyphics Moses was told to construct the Hebrew Alphabet. The higher mathematics in ancient times were part of the secret knowledge, they are being studied and applied by scientists at the present time. This has lead to the wonderful discoveries of late years. Reinforced concrete is an example, by the union of two opposites, with concrete and steel the concrete to is made strong enough to stand any strain without crumbling."}]
