[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Whare Ra – Short Notes on the 1=10 Ceremony. In the 1 ‐ 10 ceremony we enter the Tree, here the will has to decide by which path to travel, and finally enters the Path of Equilibrium, between Good and Evil. The Baptist Church is the only one which places this choice in a dramatic form. In the Mystery Plays of medieval times the people were taught Spiritual Truth in material forms. The Devil, the Angels, Archangels, the choice of good and evil, and the Elemental forces, were all represented. Wind and Fire were brought into manifestation by Magical Formulae, The Feasts of Asses and the Feasts of Fools were Bacchanalian, to show by contrast the difference between sacred and profane. Then the description of the Garden of Eden is read with the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, the account of man's fall; showing the same truth of choice as given in the Paths. The Garden of Eden was not on Earth but on the Astral Plane or in Heaven. The Fall of the Angels ante‐dated the Fall of man. The coats of skins were the material bodies prepared for them to incarnate in. Either the bodies by evolution were prepared and ready for them, or they had to wait until these bodies were evolved to incarnate upon the earth. The Ceremonies take place on the Astral Plane as well as on the material, the vibrations caused by the knocks, attract the Spiritual Forces into the material Temple. The diagram of the 7 Branched Candlestick, and the Shewbread are shown; symbols of the 7 Creative Spirits, the Planets, the Zodiac, the powers ruling man. Their powers were known to the Hebrews and all the ancient religions, they are mighty beings working on and in, man. Astrology was studied from the most ancient times, the experts could, after setting up the Horoscope, pass through it, see the truth without calculating the time) trine, square and sextile. All 5‐6 members should be able to do a divination in the Tarot, Astrology and Geomancy, and get the same answer in each. All these methods keep the mind occupied in order to leave the sub‐conscious mind free to find the answer. Mystic Titles of Malkuth are given ‐ taken from ancients religions and literature up to the Christian symbology. By meditation there meaning should be discovered. We learn that the Earth has a soul, and all the animal and vegetable world; and are introduced to Auriel the Angel of the Earth, the Elementals and the Gnomes. The Gnomes and the Elemental Spirits did not partake in the Fall, They know far more than we do about the Earth. They are intelligent beings and long for higher development, they rise by their blind obedience and labour. The Rituals are the condensed wisdom drawn from all the ancient religions, and need study and meditation to get at the truth therein. Most likely the round earth (out of which our earth arose) was the result of the Fall of the Angels. The race of Adam fell, the one man representative can ‐ Jesus Christ restored all by His Incarnation and redemption, before Christ, the two higher principles, the Spiritual Man and the Higher Genius could not be reached during earth life, except for one or two exceptions. (Enoch & Elijah) The Holy of Holies represented Divine Nature, the two Higher principles were shown by the two Cherubims, the Divine Spirit the Shekinah dwelt with them. The Holy Place may be said to represent the human, the powers that work on and in, man ‐ the Zodiac, the Planets, the Altar of Incense, worship, the highest exercise of the being of man."}]
