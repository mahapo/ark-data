[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Meditation Address by M.C. One hundred years ago was written an occult work by Fabre d'Olivet called Hermeneutic Interpretation of this origin of the social state of man and is an extraordinarily good definition of meditation. Twelve qualities are mentioned as being necessary: attention and perception, refection and repetition, compassion and judgement, retention and memory, discernment and comprehension, creation and imagination. The majority of people when first told to meditate imagine that it means sitting quiet and allowing ideas to drift in the mind. This of course is not meditation. Meditation is in fact one of the most difficult forms of occult study, as you have been told before deep and regular breathing will assist in inducing tranquillity and for meditation to be effective it is necessary to put aside the affairs of ordinary life to dismiss life worries. It is not the great worries which we all have now and then to face that really causes distraction, it is in the innumerable and perpetual small affairs and the more we desire to concentrate upon really vital things, upon the spiritual life, the more does Satan find occasion to hinder us. Those of you who have passed through several grades will remember that one of the special forms of evil and adverse Sephiroth is designated “the hinders” and they are continually trying to get the better of us “too busy” “no quiet” these are lots of excuses but if you make your mind and firmly once and for all that you are going to set apart a special time every day for meditation the hinders will take a back seat and the way will open. But so long as you are of two minds and by to serve two masters neither will get full service. The first qualification mentioned is attention, attention must be directed to do work it is intended to do. But there is more in that attention is coupled with perception. The mind be directed to outward things as affecting the inner, attention must be paid to ordinary duties but as we are set apart for spiritual work these centre thing must be drawn into the services of the interior life. Therefore cultivate perception which implies a certain abstract way of looking at things as opposed to concrete attention when doing them. Most of the ordinary work of daily life such as washing up etc. may brought into service of the spiritual life if we can find a point of contact. What may appeal to one in this respect may not appeal to another. But you will recollect that for thirty years our Lords Mother did all these things and was busy about the house and she is the type of spiritual Womanhood of humanity related to the divine. Then there is refection and repetition the considering of the matter turning over in the mind and as a cow chews the cud so must he? We? So we must get the full meaning. It is not enough to look; the different points of view must be reflected upon until the whole becomes a part of ourselves. What is reflected upon our auras or spheres of sensation remains as trace or symbol it is not merely a literal picture but contains also latent ideas of the practice because the aura reflects not only the physical but also the mental and the spiritual. The akashic records are the sphere of sensation of the world and whatever is done, said or thought is reflected and preserved therein"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"It is no empty phrase to that every idle word must be accounted for. Reflection therefore does not mean a mere pass picture as mirrored in still water it indicates something permanent. Compassion and judgement, it is not sufficient to accept an idea presented to you, it must be compassed with others ideas children are not sent to school with the idea so much of learning out of books, that could be done at home as of rubbing up against other children and herein lies the true value of reading because it is in a book does not mean that it is necessarily true. Diametrically opposite statements are found in books but each may contain may contain valuable lights on the truth. Statements need not be accepted at face value use judgement and discriminations and you will eventually find out what is true for you. We are limited in our capacities and can only assimilate a limited amount of truth, that is to say when working clairvoyantly we work in groups each sees from a differently angle and when all points and compassed something like the truth is arrived at. In clairvoyant work we are on a little known plane and therefore are more liable to illusion than on the material plane and it is necessary to learn to see before we can hope to see accurately. On the material plane an artist that is one who is trained to see sees much more in a landscape for instance that the ordinary observer. A baby is more is less blind when born, it can practically only distinguish light we are more of less babies on the stage of seeing light, something or some power that is beyond our reach. It is only when that light becomes clear and a guiding light that we are entitled to call ourselves initiate. It is not one who has absorbed a vast quantity or wisdom but one who had begun to see and follow the light. Therefore meditation is concentration upon the light if we should fine spiritual light within we must recognise the light without. All infants have two sensations when born, the need for air they must breathe therefore by, and the need for food. Both supplied to him from outside. So if we are to grow we must fill our spiritual lungs with air of divine flame and satisfy our spiritual desires with nourishment. When we have existence, air and nourishment we can proceed absorbing and digesting retention and memory we must consciously retain and remember. Most occultists hold that our actual thoughts and ideas and experiences are not of the brain but of the sphere of sensation, the brain is a telephone exchange, we ring up when we want to remember, when the exchange is working well we remember after getting trough, when it is not we forget. To train the brain to give instantaneous response is of course of great practical value. Discernment and comprehension are the two most difficult qualities to apply to our mental equipment to discern the spirits good & evil between the high and low, between the pure and evil all qualities gone before are needed especially comparison in order to discern readily. Too often does it happen that the mind drifts not discerning what is of real value. If we are to rise quickly between spiritual and physical aspects. Much psychic employment may be very exciting and interesting but is like toxicants exhilarating while it lasts but with exhaustion in its train psychic work as such is nearly always dangerous, for it deals with the astral plane. The dark path of TAV as we are told in one of the rituals--- illusions, shells of the dead, empty things. Spiritualists may be doing good work in its way by uncovering some of the continuity"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"of existence, but it deal only with its lowest planes on the other side of the veil and may hinder those who have passed on. But it is always possible to rise beyond the astral plane to great spiritual heights and then we pass behind meditation is what we call contemplation Ecstasy. Being like the greatest height of all St. Paul when speaking of rising to the seventh heaven says that he heard works not lawful to utter in other words things not comprehensible on the material plane. There is no language to correspond to what we see on the higher planes hence the use of symbols As long as your experiences are easy to describe you may take it that you are not very far advanced in your meditations. Now we come to imagination and creation too often imagination is spoken of as if valueless and reprehensible but actually in true exercise it is a god like faculty we may say that the creator imagined the world and it took form. Whatever you imagine is latent on some others plane you cannot imagine that which does not exist. If you imagine vividly enough you create a thought form which may be good or evil an actual entity may be formed but you mist be able to discern whether it be animated by good or evil before accepting its teaching. Evil spirits may desire to masquerade as spirits of light but hold them to the torch or truth the name Jesus Christ and they will reveal the true form. When practising meditation it is well to use a mantra creating as it were a wall that only the true and beautiful may pass beginners do not always see the evil and the pitfalls and not to notice the puddles the path may be difficult but it leads upwards on the plane you maybe safe but your horizon is limited it is from the mountain top you can see out and it is to the mountain that Moses and Elijah came, not to the plain as we go up we must be transfigured. Mediation is not an act f will and can never be to easy it is like to a donkey is always trying to get away even when tethered to a staff in a green plot but the tether pulls it back and it is like the mind which wanders off. When you have acquired the powers of meditation you have also acquired self control you have gained in concentration which can be use to advantage in other ways. It is those who know how to concentrate one what they are doing that find time to do things easily and quickly and with time to spare, one who is always too busy to do anything thoroughly is one who has not learned to concentrate."}]
