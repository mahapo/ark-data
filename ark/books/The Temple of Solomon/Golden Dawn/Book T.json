The Descriptions of the Seventy-eight Symbols of this Book {\"T\" in a circle, composed of two white bars}; together with their meanings. OF THE ACES FIRST in order and importance are the Four Aces, representing the Force of the Spirit, acting in, and binding together, the Four Scales of each Element: and answering to the Dominion of the Letters of the Name in the Kether of each. They represent the Radical Forces. The Four Aces are said to be placed on the North Pole of the Universe wherein they revolve, governing its revolution; and ruling as the connecting link between Yetzirah and the Material Plane or Universe. I. THE ROOT OF THE POWERS OF FIRE Ace of Wands A WHITE Radiating Angelic Hand, issuing from clouds, and grasping a heavy club, which has three branches in the colours, and with the sigils, of the scales. The Right-and Left-hand branches end respectively in three Flames, and the Centre one in four Flames: thus yielding Ten: the Number of the Sephiroth. Two-and-twenty leaping Flames, or Yodh, surround it, answering to the Paths; of these, three fall below the Right branch for Aleph, Men, and Shin, seven above the Central branch for the double 59The High PriestessThe Priestess of the Silver StarGimelMoon60The EmpressThe Daughter of the Mighty OnesDaletVenus61The EmperorSun of the Morning, chief among the MightyHehAries62The HierophantThe Magus of the EternalVauTaurus63The LoversThe Children of the Voice; the Oracles of the Mighty GodsZainGemini64The ChariotThe Child of the Powers of the Waters; the Lord of the Triumph of LightChetCancer65FortitudeThe Daughter of the Flaming SwordTetLeo66The HermitThe Magus of the Voice of Power, the Prophet of the EternalYodVirgo67The WheelThe Lord of the of Fate Forces of LifeKophJupiter68JusticeThe Daughter of the Lords of Truth: the Ruler of the BalanceLamedLibra69The Hanged ManThe Spirit of the Mighty WatersMemWater70DeathThe Child of the Great Transformers: the Lord of the Gates of DeathNunScorpio71TemperanceThe Daughter of the Reconcilers: the Bringer-Forth of lifeSamekhSagittarius72The DevilThe Lord of the Gates of Matter: the Child of the Forces of TimeAyinCapricorn73The Blasted TowerThe Lord of the Hosts of the MightyPehMars74The StarThe Daughter of the Firmament, the dweller between the WatersTzaddiAquarius75The MoonThe Ruler of Flux and Reflux: the Child of the Sons of the MightyQofPisces76The SunThe Lord of the Fire of the WorldReshSun77The JudgmentThe Spirit of the Primal FireShinSpirit and Fire78The UniverseThe Great One of the Night of TimeTawEarth and SaturnPage 3 of 26Book T13/10/2002http://www.private.org.il/GD/Book-T.html"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"letters; and between it and that of the Right twelve: six above and six below about the Left-hand branch. The whole is a great and flaming Torch. It symbolizes Force --- strength, rush, vigour, energy, and it governs, according to its nature, various works and questions. It implies Natural, as opposed to Invoked, Force. II. THE ROOT OF THE POWERS OF THE WATERS Ace of Cups or Chalices A WHITE Radiant Angelic Hand, issuing from clouds, and supporting on the palm thereof a cup, resembling that of the Stolistes. From it rises a fountain of clear and glistening water: and sprays falling on all sides into clear calm water below, in which grow Lotuses and Water-lilies. The great Letter of the Supernal Mother is traced in the spray of the Fountain. It symbolizes Fertility --- productiveness, beauty, pleasure, happiness, etc. III. THE ROOT OF THE POWERS OF THE AIR Ace of Swords A WHITE Radiating Angelic Hand, issuing from clouds, and grasping the hilt of a sword, which supports a White Radiant Celestial Crown; from which depend, on the right, the olive branch of Peace; and on the left, the palm branch of suffering. Six Vaus fall from its point. It symbolizes \"Invoked,\" as contrasted with Natural Force: for it is the Invocation of the Sword. Raised upward, it invokes the Divine crown of Spiritual Brightness, but reversed it is the Invocation of Demonic Force; and becomes a fearfully evil symbol. It represents, therefore, very great power for good or evil, but invoked; and it also represents whirling Force, and strength through trouble. It is the affirmation of Justice upholding Divine Authority; and it may become the Sword of Wrath, Punishment, and Affliction. IV. THE ROOT OF THE POWERS OF THE EARTH Ace of Pentacles A WHITE Radiant Angelic Hand, holding a branch of a Rose Tree, whereon is a large Pentacle, formed of Five concentric circles. The Innermost Circle is white, charged with a red Greek Cross. From this White Centre, Twelve Rays, also white, issue: these terminate at the circumference, making the whole something like an Astrological figure of the Heavens. It is surmounted by a small circle, above which is a large white Maltese Cross, and with two white wings. Four Crosses and two buds are shewn. The Hand issueth from the Clouds as in the other three cases. It represents materiality in all senses, good and evil: and is, therefore, in a sense, illusionary: it shows material gain, labour, power, wealth, etc. The Sixteen, or Royal, Cards The Four Kings THE Four Kings, or \"Figures mounted on steeds,\" represent the Yodh forces of the Name in each Suit: the Radix, Father and commencement of Material Forces, a force in which all the others are implied, and of which they form the development and completion. A force swift and violent in its action, but whose effect soon passes away, and therefore symbolized by a Figure on a Steed riding swiftly, and clothed in complete Armour. Therefore is the knowledge of the scale of the King so necessary for the commencement of all magical working. The Four Queens Page 4 of 26Book T13/10/2002http://www.private.org.il/GD/Book-T.html"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"are seated upon Thrones; representing the Forces of the He of the Name in each suit; the Mother and bringer-forth of Material Forces: a force which develops and realizes that of the King: a force steady and unshaken, but not rapid, though enduring. It is therefore symbolized by a Figure seated upon a Throne: but also clothed in Armour. The Four Princes These Princes are Figures seated in Chariots, and thus borne forward. They represent the Vau Forces of the Name in each suit: the Mighty Son of the King and Queen, who realizes the influence of both scales of Force. A Prince, the son of a King and Queen, yet a Prince of Princes, and a King of Kings: an Emperor whose effect is at once rapid (though not so swift as that of the Queen) and enduring. It is, therefore, symbolized by a Figure borne in a Chariot, and clothed in Armour. Yet is his power vain and illusionary, unless set in Motion by his Father and Mother. The Four Princesses are the Knaves of the Tarot Pack; The Four Princesses or figures of Amazons, standing firmly of themselves: neither riding upon Horses, nor seated upon Thrones, nor borne in Chariots. They represent the forces of the He final of the Name in each suit, completing the Influences of the other scales: The mighty and potent daughter of a King and Queen: a Princess powerful and terrible: a Queen of Queens --- an Empress --- whose effect combines those of the King, Queen, and Prince, at once violent and permanent; therefore symbolized by a Figure standing firmly by itself, only partially draped, and having but little Armour; yet her power existeth not, save by reason of the others: and then indeed it is mighty and terrible materially, and is the Throne of the Forces of the Spirit. Woe unto whomsoever shall make war upon her, when thus established! The Spheres of Influence of the Court Cards of the Tarot Pack THE Princesses rule the Four Parts of the Celestial Heavens which lie around the north Pole, and above the respective Cherubic Signs of the Zodiac, and they form the Thrones of the Powers of the Four Aces. The twelve cards, the Four Kings, Queens and Princes rule the dominion of the Celestial Heavens, between the realm of the Four Princesses and the Zodiac, as is hereafter shewn. And they, as it were, link together the signs. V. The Lord of the Flame and the Lightning; The King of the Spirits of Fire Knight of Wands A WINGED Warrior riding upon a black horse with flaming mane and tail: the horse itself is not winged. The rider wears a winged helmet (like the old Scandinavian and Gaulish helmet) with a Rayed Crown, a corslet of scale-mail and buskins of the same, and a flowing scarlet mantle. Above his helmet, upon his curass, and on the shoulder-pieces and buskins, he wears as a crest a winged black horse's head. He grasps a club with flaming ends, somewhat similar to that in the symbol of the Ace of Wands, but not so heavy, and also the sigil of his scale is shown; beneath the rushing feet of his steed are waving flames and fire. He is active --- generous --- fierce --- sudden --- impetuous. If ill dignified, he is evil-minded --- cruel --- bigoted --- brutal. He rules the celestial heavens from above the Twentieth Degree of Scorpio to the First Two Decans of Sagittarius: and this includes a part of the Constellation Hercules. (Hercules is always represented with a Club.) Fire of Fire King of the Salamanders. VI. The Queen of the Thrones of Flame Queen of Wands A CROWNED queen with long red-golden hair, seated upon a Throne, with steady flames beneath. She wears a corslet and buskins of scale-mail, which latter her robe discloses. Her arms are almost bare. On cuirass and buskins are leopard's heads winged, and the same symbol surmounteth her crown. At her side is a couchant leopard on which her hands rest. She bears a long wand with a very heavy conical head. The face is beautiful and resolute. Adaptability, steady force applied to an object, steady rule, great attractive power, power of command, Page 5 of 26Book T13/10/2002http://www.private.org.il/GD/Book-T.html"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"yet liked notwithstanding.

The Prince of the Chariot of Fire King of Wands A KINGLY Figure with a golden, winged crown, seated on a chariot. He has large white wings. One wheel of his chariot is shewn. He wears corslet and buskins of scale armour decorated with a winged lion's head, which symbol also surmounts his crown. His chariot is drawn by a lion. His arms are bare, save for the shoulder-pieces of the corslet, and he bears a torch or fire-wand, somewhat similar to that of the Zelator Adeptus Minor. Beneath the chariot are flames, some waved, some salient. Swift, strong, hasty; rather violent, yet just and generous; noble and scorning meanness. If ill dignified --- cruel, intolerant, prejudiced and ill natured. He rules the heavens from above the last Decan of Cancer to the second Decan of Leo; hence he includes most of Leo Minor.

A mantle lined with tiger's skin falls back from her shoulders. Her right hand rests on a small golden or brazen altar ornamented with ram's heads and with Flames of Fire leaping from it. Her left hand leans on a long and heavy club, swelling at the lower end, where the sigil is placed; and it has flames of fire leaping from it the whole way down; but the flames are ascending. This club or torch is much longer than that carried by the King or Queen. Beneath her firmly placed feet are leaping Flames of Fire.

Synthesis, world, kingdom. Usually denotes actual subject of question, and therefore depends entirely on accompanying cards. Princes and Queens shew almost always actual men and women connected with the matter. But the Kings (Knights) sometime represent coming or going of a matter, according as they face. The Princesses shew opinions, thoughts, ideas, either in harmony with or opposed to, the subject. Of The Dignities A CARD is strong or weak, well dignified or ill dignified, according to the cards next to it on either side. Cards of the same suit on either side strengthen it greatly, for good or evil according to their nature. Cards of opposite natures on either side weaken it greatly, for either good or evil. Swords are inimical to Pentacles. Wands are inimical to Cups. A Majority of WandsEnergy, opposition, quarrel.A Majority of CupsPleasure, merriment.A Majority of SwordsTrouble, sadness, sickness, death.A Majority of PentaclesBusiness, money, possessions.A Majority of KeysStrong forces beyond the Querent's control.A Majority of Court CardsSociety, meetings of many persons.A Majority of AcesStrength generally.

Wands are friendly with Swords and Pentacles. If a card fall between two other which are mutually contrary, it is not much affected by either. A Method of Divination by the Tarot 1.THE Significator. Choose a card to represent the Querent, using your knowledge or judgment of his character rather than dwelling on his physical characteristics. 2.Take the cards in your left hand. In the right hand hold the wand over them, and say: I invoke thee, I A O, that thou wilt send H R U, the great Angel that is set over the operations of this Secret Wisdom, to lay his hand invisibly upon these consecrated cards of art, that thereby we may obtain true knowledge of hidden things, to the glory of thine ineffable Name. Amen. 3.Hand the cards to Querent, and bid him think of the question attentively, and cut. 4.Take the cards as cut, and hold as for dealing. \"First Operation\" This shows the situation of the Querent at the time when he consults you. 1.The pack being in front of you, cut, and place the top half to the left. 2.Cut each pack again to the left. 3.These four stack represent I H V H, from right to left. 4.Find the Significator. It be in the HB:Y pack, the question refers to work, business, etc.; if in the HB:H pack, to love, marriage, or pleasure; if in the HB:H pack, to money, goods, and such purely material matters. 5.Tell the Querent what he has come for: if wrong, abandon the divination. 6.If right, spread out the pack containing the Significator, face upwards. Count the cards from him, in the direction in which he faces. The counting should include the card from which you count. For Knights, Queens and Princes, count 4. For Princesses, count 7. For Aces, count 11. For small cards, count according to the number. For trumps, count 3 for the elemental trumps; 9 for the planetary trumps; 12 for the Zodiacal trumps. Make a \"story\" of these cards. This story is that of the beginning of the affair. 7.Pair the cards on either side of the Significator, then those outside them, and so on. Make another \"story,\" which should fill in the details omitted in the first. 8.If this story is not quite accurate, do not be discouraged. Perhaps the Querent himself does not know everything. But the main lines ought to be laid down firmly, with correctness, or the divination should be abandoned. \"Second Operation\" Development of the Question 1.Shuffle, invoke suitably, and let Querent cut as before. 2.Deal cards into twelve stacks, for the twelve astrological houses of heaven. 3.Make up your mind in which stack you ought to find the Significator, \"e.g.\" in the seventh house if the question concerns marriage, and so on. 4.Examine this chosen stack. If the Significator is not there, try some cognate house. On a second failure, abandon the divination. 5.Read the stack counting and pairing as before. \"Third Operation\" Further Development of the Question 1.Shuffle, etc., as before. 2.Deal cards into twelve stacks for the twelve signs of the Zodiac. 3.Divine the proper stack and proceed as before.

Comments. 1.This is a figure in the shape of an Ankh, with symbols about and upon the form. The loop is a series of four concentric bands like the Rose cross, about a central circle. The central circle is quartered by a vertical Greek cross. This cross has a dot in the center and is marked \"Red on white.\" The ring just about this circle is divided by radial segments into three chambers, with one centered at top; clockwise from top, the chambers are marked: \"Bright pale yellow\", \"Glowing orange scarlet\", \"Deep blue\". The next ring outward is divided into seven chambers, one to bottom, and marked clockwise from 1 o'clock: \"Violet\", \"Indigo\", \"Blue\", \"Emerald Green\", \"Yellow\", \"Orange\", \"Red\". The next ring outward is divided into twelve chambers, division at top and bottom with six to either side; clockwise from 1 o'clock: \"Crimson\", \"Violet\", \"Indigo\", \"Blue\", \"Green blue\", \"Emerald Green\", \"Green Yellowish\", \"Yellow Greenish\", \"Amber\", \"Orange\", \"Red Orange\", \"Scarlet\". The outer ring is interrupted at the bottom by a segment to match the continuation of the sloping lower sides of the lower upright, the base of this segment is defined not by the ring but by the upper portion of two diagonals drawn from the inner angles of the cross. This five-sided semi-regular figure is further divided within by two crossed lines emanating from the upper corners and extending across the center to the midpoints of the lower sides. In the four chambers resulting are these color abbreviations, clockwise from top: \"Blk\" (for black), \"Russ\" (for russet), \"Cit'n\" (for citrine), \"Olive\". To either side of this section, on the band itself, is written \"white merging into grey\". In the top of this outermost ring are these letters in the \"Theban Alphabet\": u r h --- signifying the \"Angel\" or \"God of Tarot\", HRU. The left arm of the Ankh has from left to right: the symbol of Scorpio (the \"M\" style, not the Eagle as noted in text), a cup, the words \"Deep Blue; Symbols in yellow\". The right arm of the Ankh has from left to right: \"the words \"Red; symbols in Green\", a lotus wand, the symbol of Leo. The basal upright of the Ankh has these in the lower half only, from bottom upward: the symbol of Aquarius, an upright sword in style of the Solomonic Key, the words \"Yellow; symbols in Violet. There are markings and symbols outside the shape of the Ankh: Upper left corner: \"L-I-F-E-\" above a large \"T\". Upper right corner: \"V-I-T-A-\" above a large \"A\". To left of base: large \"O\". To right of base: large \"P\". Below base: \"B-I-O-S-\" just above the caption \"THE COMPLETE SYMBOL OF THE TAROT\". The large letters spell \"TARO\" in Greek capitals (GR:Tau-Alpha-Rho-Omicron). In the wedges defined by the lower sides of the cross-arms and the base upright sides: to left an upright pentagram with the dot-in-circle Sun symbol in its pentagonal center. To right the same, but with a crescent moon, horns to right. 2.A Handbook of Geomancy. Page 26 of 26Book T13/10/2002http://www.private.org.il/GD/Book-T.html"}]
