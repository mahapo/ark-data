Fra., having succumbed unhappily to the assaults of the FourGreat Princes (acting notably under Martial influences), it seemed expedient that thework should be brought to its conclusion by another hand. The investigation of acompetent Skryer into the house of our unhappy Fra., confirmed this divination;neither our Fra. nor his Hermetic Mul. were there seen; but only the terrible shapes ofthe evil Adepts S.V.A.2 and H., whose original bodies having been sequestered byJustice, were no longer of use to them. On this we stayed no longer Our Hand; butwithdrawing Ourselves, and consulting the Rota, and the Books M. and Q. diddecide to ask Mr. Aleister Crowley, a poet, and skilled student of Magical Lore, andan expert Kabbalist, to complete openly that which had been begun in secret.3 This isthat which is written: “His Bishoprick let another take.” And again: “OculiTetragammaton.” This is also that which is said: “Nomen Secundum refertur adGebhurah; qui est Rex Bittul atque Corruptio Achurajim Patris et Matris hocindigitatur. “And so saying we wish you well.Ex Deo Nascimur.In Jesu Morimur.Per S.S.

Truly, since our childhood has ingrained into us notonly literal belief in the Bible, but also substantial belief in Alf Laylah wa Laylah, andonly adolescence can cure us, we are only too liable, in the rush and energy ofdawning manhood, to overturn roughly and rashly both these classics, to regard themboth on the same level, as interesting documents from the standpoint of folk-lore andanthropology, and as nothing more.Even when we learn that the Bible, by a profound and minute study of the text,may be forced to yield up Qabalistic arcana of cosmic scope and importance, we aretoo often slow to apply a similar restorative to the companion volume, even if we arethe luck holders of Burton’s veritable edition.To me, then, it remains to raise the Alf Laylah wa Laylah into its proper placeonce more.I am not concerned to deny the objective reality of all “magical” phenomena; ifthey are illusions, they are at least as real as many unquestioned facts of daily life;and, if we follow Herbert Spencer, they are at least evidence of some cause.4Now, this fact is our base. What is the cause of my illusion of seeing a spirit in thetriangle of Art?Every smatterer, every expert in psychology, will answer: “That cause lies in yourbrain.”English children (pace the Education Act) are taught that the Universe lies ininfinite Space; Hindu children, in the Akasa, which is the same thing.Those Europeans who go a little deeper learn from Fichte, that the phenomenalUniverse is the creation of the Ego; Hindus, or Europeans studying under HinduGurus, are told, that by Akasa is meant the Chitakasa. The Chitakasa is situated inthe “Third Eye,” i.e., in the brain. By assuming higher dimensions of space, we canassimilate this fact to Realism; but we have no need to take so much trouble.This being true for the ordinary Universe, that all sense-impressions aredependent on changes in the brain5 we must include illusions, which are after allsense-impressions as much as “realities” are, in the class of “phenomena dependenton brain-changes.”Magical phenomena, however, come under a special sub-class, since they are   4 This, incidentally, is perhaps the greatest argument we possess, pushed to its extreme, against theAdvaitist theories.5 Thought is a secretion of the brain (Weissmann). Consciousness is a function of the brain (Huxley)."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"willed, and their cause is the series of “real” phenomena, called the operations ofceremonial Magic.These consist of(1) Sight.The circle, square, triangle, vessels, lamps, robes, implements, etc.(2) Sound.The invocations.(3) Smell.The perfumes.(4) Taste.The Sacraments.(5) Touch.As under (1).(6) Mind.The combination of all these and reflection on their significance.These unusual impressions (1-5) produce unusual brain-changes; hence theirsummary (6) is of unusual kind. Its projection back into the apparently phenomenalworld is therefore unusual.Herein then consists the reality of the operations and effects of ceremonial magic,6and I conceive that the apology is ample, as far as the “effects” refer only to thosephenomena which appear to the magician himself, the appearance of the spirit, hisconversation, possible shocks from imprudence, and so on, even to ecstasy on the onehand, and death or madness on the other.But can any of the effects described in this our book Goetia be obtained, and if so,can you give a rational explanation of the circumstances? Say you so?I can, and will.The spirits of the Goetia are portions of the human brain.Their seals therefore represent (Mr. Spencer’s projected cube) methods ofstimulating or regulating those particular spots (through the eye).The names of God are vibrations calculated to establish:(a) General control of the brain. (Establishment of functions relative to the subtleworld.)(b) Control over the brain in detail. (Rank or type of the Spirit.)(c) Control of one special portion. (Name of the Spirit.)The perfumes aid this through smell. Usually the perfume will only tend to   6 Apart from its value in obtaining one-pointedness."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"control a large area; but there is an attribution of perfumes to letters of the alphabetenabling one, by a Qabalistic formula, to spell out the Spirit’s name.I need not enter into more particular discussion of these points; the intelligentreader can easily fill in what is lacking.If, then, I say, with Solomon:“The Spirit Cimieries teaches logic,” what I mean is:“Those portions of my brain which subserve the logical faculty way be stimulatedand developed by following out the processes called ‘The Invocation of Cimieries.’ “And this is a purely materialistic rational statement; it is independent of anyobjective hierarchy at all. Philosophy has nothing to say; and Science can onlysuspend judgment, pending a proper and methodical investigation of the factsalleged.Unfortunately, we cannot stop there. Solomon promises us that we can (1) obtaininformation; (2) destroy our enemies; (3) understand the voices of nature; (4) obtaintreasure; (5) heal diseases, etc. I have taken these five powers at random;considerations of space forbid me to explain all.(1) Brings up facts from sub-consciousness.(2) Here we come to an interesting fact. It is curious to note the contrast betweenthe noble means and the apparently vile ends of magical rituals. The latter aredisguises for sublime truths. “To destroy our enemies” is to realize the illusion ofduality, to excite compassion.(Ah! Mr. Waite, the world of Magic is a mirror, wherein who sees muck is muck.)(3) A careful naturalist will understand much from the voices of the animals hehas studied long. Even a child knows the difference of a cat’s miauling and purring.The faculty may be greatly developed.(4) Business capacity may be stimulated.(5) Abnormal states of the body may be corrected, and the involved tissuesbrought back to tone, in obedience to currents started from the brain.So for all other phenomena. There is no effect which is truly and necessarilymiraculous.Our Ceremonial Magic fines down, then, to a series of minute, though of courseempirical, physiological experiments, and whoso will carry them through intelligentlyneed not fear the result.I have all the health, and treasure, and logic, I need; I have no time to waste.“There is a lion in the way.” For me these practices are useless; but for the benefit ofothers less fortunate I give them to the world, together with this explanation of, andapology for, them.I trust that the explanation will enable many students who have hitherto, by apuerile objectivity in their view of the question, obtained no results, to succeed; thatthe apology may impress upon our scornful men of science that the study of thebacillus should give place to that of the baculum, the little to the great—how great"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"one only realizes when one identifies the wand with the Mahalingam, up whichBrahma flew at the rate of 84,000 yojanas a second for 84,000 mahakalpas, downwhich Vishnu flew at the rate of 84,000 croces of yojanas a second for 84,000 croresof mahakalpas—yet neither reached an end.But I reach an end.Boleskine House,Foyers, N.B."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"PRELIMINARY DEFINITION OF MAGIC.LEMEGETON VEL CLAVICULA SALOMONIS REGIS.Magic is the Highest, most Absolute, and most Divine Knowledge of NaturalPhilosophy,7 advanced in its works and wonderful operations by a rightunderstanding of the inward and occult virtue of things; so that true Agents8 beingapplied to proper Patients,9 strange and admirable effects will thereby be produced.Whence magicians are profound and diligent searchers into Nature; they, because oftheir skill, know how to anticipate an effort,10 the which to the vulgar shall seem tobe a miracle.Origen saith that the Magical Art doth not contain anything subsisting, butalthough it should, yet that it must not be Evil, or subject to contempt or scorn; anddoth distinguish the Natural Magic from that which is Diabolical.Apollonius Tyannaeus only exercised the Natural Magic, by the which he didperform wonderful things.Philo Hebraeus saith that true Magic, by which we do arrive at the understandingof the Secret Works of Nature, is so far from being contemptible that the greatestMonarchs and Kings have studied it. Nay! among the Persians none might reignunless he was skilful in this GREAT ART.This Noble Science often degenerateth, from Natural becometh Diabolical, andfrom True Philosophy turneth unto Nigromancy.11 The which is wholly to be chargedupon its followers, who, abusing or not being capable of that High and MysticalKnowledge do immediately hearken unto the temptations of Sathan, and are misledby him into the Study of the Black Art. Hence it is that Magic lieth under disgrace,and they who seek after it are vulgarly esteemed Sorcerers.The Fraternity of the Rosie Crusians thought it not fit to style themselvesMagicians, but rather Philosophers.

Wherefore make rational answer unto mydemands, and prepare to be obedient unto thy master in the name of the Lord:   34 In some codices this is called \"the Curse\" only; but in one or two the “Spirits' Chain” is called “theLesser Curse,” and this the “Greater Curse.”"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"BATHAL OR VATHAT RUSHING UPON ABRAC!ABEOR COMING UPON ABERER!35THEN he or they will be obedient, and bid thee ask what thou wilt, for he or theybe subjected by God to fulfil our desires and commands.
