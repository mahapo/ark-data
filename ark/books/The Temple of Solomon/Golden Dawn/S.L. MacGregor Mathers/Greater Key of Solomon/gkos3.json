In the first thou mayest see andknow how to avoid errors in Experiments, Operations, and in the Spirits theirselves.In the second thou art taught in what manner Magical Arts may be reduced to theproposed object and end.It is for this reason that thou shouldst take great heed and care that this Key ofSecrets fall not into the hands of the foolish, the stupid, and the ignorant. For he whois the possessor hereof, and who availeth himself hereof according to the ordinancesherein contained, will not only be able to reduce the Magical Arts herein unto theirproposed end, but will, even if he findeth certain errors herein, be able to correctthem.Any Art or Operation of this kind will not be able to attain its end, unless theMaster of the Art, or Exorcist, shall have this work completely in his power, that is tosay, unless he thoroughly understand it, for without this he will never attain the effectof any operation.For this reason I earnestly pray and conjure the person into whose hands this Keyof Secrets may fall, neither to communicate it, nor to make any one a partaker in thisknowledge, if he be not faithful, nor capable of keeping a secret, nor expert in theArts. And I most humbly entreat the possessor of this, by the Ineffable Name of Godin Four Letters, YOD, HE, VAU, HE, and by the Name ADONAI, and by all the otherMost High and Holy Names of God, that he values this work as dearly as his own soul,and that he makes no foolish or ignorant man a partaker therein."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Book TwoPage 83Chapter IAT What Hour after the Preparation of All Things Necessary, We Should Bring the Exercise of the Art to PerfectionThe Days and Hours have already been treated of, in general, in the First Book. It isnow necessary to notice in particular at what hour accomplishment and perfectionshould be given to the Arts, all things necessary having been previously prepared.Should it then happen that thou hast undertaken any secret operation for con-versing with or conjuring Spirits, in which the day and the hour are not marked, thoushalt put it in execution on the days and hours of Mercury, at the sixteenth or twenty-third hour, but it will be still better at the eighth, which is the third of the same night,which is called and means before the morning, for then thou shalt be able to put inpractice all the Arts and Operations which should he performed, according as it shallplease thee by day or by night, provided that they have been prepared at the hourssuitable to them, as hath been already said. But when neither hour nor time of opera-tion or invocation is specified, it is then much better to perform these experiments atnight, seeing that it is more easy to the Spirits to appear in the peaceful silence ofnight than during the day. And thou shouldst inviolably observe, that wishing toinvoke the Spirits, either by day or by night, it is necessary that it should be done in aplace hidden, removed, secret, convenient, and proper for such Art, where no manfrequenteth or inhabiteth, as we shall relate more fully in its place.If then thou shouldst operate touching anything which hath been stolen, in what-ever way it be performed and whatever way it may have been prepared, it is necessaryto practice it on the days and hours of the Moon, being if possible in her increase, andfrom the first unto the eighth hour of the day.But if it be by night, then it should be at the fifth or at the third hour; but it is bet-ter by day than by the night, for the light justifieth them, and maketh them muchmore fit for publication. But if the Operations be regarding Invisibility, they shouldbe put in practice at the first, second, and third hours of Mars by day. But if by night,until the third hour. If they be Operations of seeking love, grace, or favor, they shouldbe performed until the eighth hour of the same day, commencing with the first hourof the Sun; and from the first hour of Venus unto the first hour of the same day ofVe n u s .As for Operations of destruction and desolation, we should practice and put theminto execution on the day of Saturn at the first hour, or rather at the eighth or fif-teenth of the day; and from the first until the eighth hour of the night.Experiments of games, raillery, deceit, illusion, and invisibility, ought to be doneat the first hour of Venus, and at the eighth hour of the day; but by night at the thirdand at the seventh.At all times of practicing and putting into execution Magical Arts, the Moonshould be increasing in light, and in an equal number of degrees with the Sun; and it"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The Key of SolomonPage 84is much better from the first quarter to the Opposition, and the Moon should be in afiery Sign, and notably in that of the Ram or of the Lion.Therefore, to execute these Experiments in any manner whatsoever, it should bedone when the Moon is clear, and when she is increasing in light.In order to put in execution those of Invisibility after everything is properly pre-pared, the Moon should be in the Sign of the Fishes, in the hours proper and fitting,and she should be increasing in light.For experiments of seeking love and favor, in whatever way it may be desired, theywill succeed, provided that they have been prepared at the proper hours, and that theMoon be increasing in light and in the Sign of the Twins.So exact a preparation of days and hours is not necessary for those who areAdepts in the Art, but it is extremely necessary for apprentices and beginners, seeingthat those who have been little or not at all instructed herein, and who only begin toapply themselves to this Art, do not have as much faith in the experiments as thosewho are adepts therein, and who have practiced them. But as regards beginners, theyshould always have the days and hours well disposed and appropriate unto the Art.And the wise should only observe the precepts of the Art which are necessary, and inobserving the other solemnities necessary they will operate with a perfect assurance.It is, nevertheless, necessary to take care that when thou shalt have prepared anyexperiment thyself for the days and hours ordained, that it should be performed inclear, serene, mild, and pleasant weather, without any great tempest or agitation of theair, which should not be troubled by winds. For when thou shalt have conjured anySpirits in any art or experiment, they will not come when the Air is troubled or agi-tated by winds, seeing that Spirits have neither flesh nor bones, and are created ofdifferent substances.Some are created from Water.Others from Wind, unto which they are like.Some from Earth.Some from Clouds.Others from Solar Vapors.Others from the keenness and strength of Fire; and when they are invoked orsummoned, they come always with great noise, and with the terrible nature of fire.When the Spirits which are created of water are invoked, they come with greatrains, thunder, hail, lightning, thunder-bolts, and the like.When the Spirits which are created of Clouds are invoked, they come with greatdeformity, in a horrible form, to strike fear into the invocator, and with an exceedinggreat noise.Others which are formed from wind appear like thereunto and with exceedingswift motion, and whensoever those which are created from Beauty appear, they willshow themselves in a fair and agreeable form; moreover, whensoever thou shalt callthe Spirits created from Air, they will come with a kind of gentle breeze.When the Spirits which are created from the Vapors of the Sun are invoked, theycome under a very beautiful and excellent form, but filled with pride, vanity, and con-"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Book TwoPage 85ceit. They are clever, whence it comes that these last are all specified by SOLOMON inhis book of ornament, or of beauty. They show great ostentation and vainglory intheir dress, and they rejoice in many ornaments; the boast of possessing mundanebeauty, and all sorts of ornaments and decorations. Thou shalt only invoke them inserene, mild, and pleasant weather.The Spirits which are created of Fire reside in the east, those created of Wind inthe south.Note then that it will be much better to perform the experiments or operations inthe direction of the East, putting everything necessary in practice towards that point.But for all other operations or extraordinary experiments, and for those of love,they will be much more efficacious directed towards the north.Take heed further, that every time that thou performest any experiment, to reduceit unto perfection with the requisite solemnities, thou shalt recommence the formerexperiment if interrupted therein, without the preparation of hours or othersolemnities.If by chance it should happen that having performed an experiment with dueobservance of days, hours, and requisite solemnities, thou shalt find it unsuccessful, itmust be in some manner false, ill-arranged and defective, and thou must assuredlyhave failed in some matter; for if thou doest ill in one single point, these experimentsor these Arts will not be verified.Thus upon this Chapter dependeth this whole Key of Arts, Experiments, andOperations, and although every solemnity be rightly observed, no experiment will beverified, unless thou canst penetrate the meaning of this Chapter."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Key of SolomonPage 86Chapter II.In What Manner the Master of the Art Should Keep, Rule, And Govern Him-self.He who wisheth to apply himself unto so great and so difficult a Science should havehis mind free from all business, and from all extraneous ideas of whatever nature theymay be.He should then thoroughly examine the Art or Operation which he shouldundertake, and write it regularly out on paper, particularly set aside for that purpose,with the appropriate conjurations and exorcisms. If there be anything to mark orwrite down, it should be performed in the manner specified regarding the paper, ink,and pen. He should also observe at what day and at what hour this Experimentshould be undertaken, and what things are necessary to prepare for it, what should beadded, and what can be dispensed with.The which matters being prepared, it is necessary for thee to search out andarrange some fitting place wherein the Magical Art and its Experiments can be put inpractice. All these things being thus arranged and disposed, let the Master of the Artgo into a proper and fitting place, or into his Cabinet or Secret Chamber if it be con-venient for the purpose, and he can there dispose and set in order the wholeoperation; or he can use any other convenient secret place for the purpose, providedthat no one knoweth where it is, and that no man can see him when there.After this he must strip himself entirely naked, and let him have a bath ready pre-pared, wherein is water exorcised, after the manner which we shall describe, so that hemay bathe and purify himself therein from the crown of his head unto the sole of hisfoot, saying:O Lord ADONAI, who hast formed me Thine unworthy servant in Thine Imageand resemblance of vile and of abject earth; deign to bless and to sanctify this Water,so that it may be for the health and purification of my soul, and of my body, so thatno foolishness or deceitfulness may therein in any way have place.O Most Powerful and Ineffable God, Who madest Thy people pass dryshodthrough the Red Sea when they came up out of the Land of Egypt, grant unto megrace that I may be purified and regenerated from all my past sins by this Water, thatso no uncleanness may appear upon me in Thy Presence.After this thou shalt entirely immerse thyself in the water, and thou shalt dry thy-self with a towel of clean white linen, and then thou shalt put upon thy flesh thegarments of pure white linen whereof we shall speak hereafter.Hereafter, for three days at least, thou shalt abstain from all idle, vain, and impurereasonings, and from every kind of impurity and sin, as will be shown in the Chapterof fast and of vigil. Each day shalt thou recite the following prayer, at least once in themorning, twice about noon, thrice in the afternoon, four times in the evening, andfive times before lying down to sleep; this shalt thou do on the three ensuing days:"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Book TwoPage 87The Prayer.HERACHIO, ASAC, ASACRO, BEDRIMULAEL, TILATH, ARABONAS, IER-AHLEM, IDEODOC, ARCHARZEL, ZOPHIEL, BLAUTEL, BARACATA, EDONIEL,ELOHIM, EMAGRO, ABRAGATEH, SAMOEL, GEBURAHEL, CADATO, ERA,ELOHI, ACHSAH, EBMISHA, IMACHEDEL, DANIEL, DAMA, ELAMOS, IZA-CHEL, BAEL, SEGON, GEMON, DEMAS.O Lord God, Who art seated upon the Heavens, and Who regardest the Abyssesbeneath, grant unto me Thy Grace I beseech Thee, so that what I conceive in my mindI may accomplish in my work, through Thee, O God, the Sovereign Ruler of all, Wholivest and reignest unto the Ages of the Ages.

It will be necessary for thee towait for the hour in which thou shouldst commence the Operation; but when once itshall be commenced at this hour, thou shalt be able to continue it unto the end, seeingthat it deriveth its force and virtue from its beginning, which extendeth to and spread-eth over the succeeding hours, so that the Master of the Art will be enabled tocomplete his work so as to arrive at the desired result."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Key of SolomonPage 88Chapter III.How the Companions or Disciples of the Master of the Art Ought to Regu-late and Govern Themselves.Wh en the Master of the Art wisheth to put in practice any Operation or Experiment,especially one of importance, he should first consider of what Companions he shouldavail himself. This is the reason why in every Operation whose Experience should becarried out in the Circle, it is well to have three Companions. And if he cannot haveCompanions, he should at least have with him a faithful and attached dog. But if it beabsolutely necessary for him to have Companions, these Companions should be obli-gated and bound by oath to do all that the Master shall order or prescribe them, andthey should study, observe, and carefully retain, and be attentive unto all which theyshall hear. For those who shall act otherwise shall suffer and endure many pains andlabors, and run into many dangers, which the Spirits will cause and procure for them,and for this cause sometimes they shall even die.The Disciples then, being well and thoroughly instructed, and fortified with awise and understanding heart, the Master shall take exorcised Water, and he shallenter with his Disciples into a secret place purified and clean, where he must stripthem entirely naked: after this, let him pour exorcised water upon their heads, whichhe should cause to flow from the crown of their head unto the sole of their foot, so asto bathe them entirely therewith; and while bathing them thus, he should say:–Be ye regenerate, cleansed, and purified, in the Name of the Ineffable, Great, andEternal God, from all your iniquities, and may the virtue of the Most High descendupon you and abide with you always, so that ye may have the power and strength toaccomplish the desires of your heart. Amen.After this let the Disciples robe themselves as the Master hath done, and fast likehim for three days, repeating the same prayer; let them act like him, and in the worklet them implicitly follow and obey him in all things.But if the Master of the Art wisheth to have a dog for his Companion, he mustbathe him thoroughly with the exorcised water in the same manner as the Disciples,and let him perfume him with the odors and incense of Art, and let him repeat thefollowing Conjuration over him:I conjure thee, O thou Creature, being a Dog, by Him Who hath created thee, Ibathe and I perfume thee in the Name of the Most High, Most Powerful, and EternalGod, so that thou mayest be my true Companion in this operation, and that thoumayest he also my faithful friend in whatsoever Operation I may hereafter perform.But if he wisheth to have for his companion a little boy or girl, which will be stillbetter, he must ordain them as he hath ordained the dog; and he must pare and cutthe nails of their hands and of their feet, saying:I conjure thee, O thou Creature, being a young girl (or boy), by the Most HighGod, the Father of all Creatures, by the Father ADONAI ELOHIM, and by the FatherElion, that thou shalt have neither will nor power to hide from me anything, nor yet"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Book TwoPage 89to keep back from me the truth in all which I shall demand of thee, and that thou beobedient and faithful unto me. Amen.Let him purify, cleanse, and wash this young child anew, with the Water of Art,saying:Be thou regenerate, cleansed, and purified, so that the Spirits may neither harmthee nor abide in thee. Amen.Then perfume the child with odours as above.When the companions shall be thus ordained and disposed, the Master shalt beable to operate in surety together with them, every time that it shall please him; andhe shall perform his operation happily, and shall attain his end.But for the safety both of soul and of body, the Master and the Companionsshould have the Pentacles before their breasts, consecrated, and covered with a silkenveil, and perfumed with the proper fumigations. By the which being assured andencouraged, they may enter into the matter without fear or terror, and they shall beexempt and free from all perils and dangers, provided that they obey the commandsof the Master and do all that he ordain them. If they shall act thus, all things shall goaccording unto their desires.All being thus arranged, the Master should take heed that His Disciples are per-fectly instructed in those things which they have to perform.These Companions or Disciples should be three in number, without including theMaster. They may also be of the number of five, of seven, or of nine; but so that theyever implicitly obey the orders of their Master; for thus only shall all things come to asuccessful issue."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Key of SolomonPage 90Chapter IV.Concerning the Fasting, Care, and Things to be Observed.Wh en the Master of the Art shall wish to perform his operations, having previouslyarranged all things which it is necessary to observe and practise; from the first day ofthe Experiment, it is absolutely necessary to ordain and to prescribe care and observa-tion, to abstain from all things unlawful, and from every kind of impiety, impurity,wickedness, or immodesty, as well of body as of soul; as, for example, eating anddrinking superabundantly, and all sorts of vain words, buffooneries, slanders, calum-nies, and other useless discourse; but instead to do good deeds, speak honestly, keep astrict decency in all things, never lose sight of modesty in walking, in conversation, ineating and drinking, and in all things; the which should he principally done andobserved for nine days, before the commencement of the Operation. The Disciplesshould do the same, and should equally put in practice all things necessary to beobserved, if they wish to make use of all these operations and experiments.But before the commencement of the work, it is absolutely necessary that theMaster with his Disciples repeat the following Conjuration once in the morning, andtwice in the evening:THE CONJURATION.O Lord God Almighty, be propitious unto me a miserable sinner, for I am notworthy to raise mine eyes unto heaven, because of the iniquity of my sins and themultitude of my faults. O pitying and merciful Father, who wouldest not the death ofa sinner but rather that he should turn from his wickedness and live, O God havemercy upon me and pardon all my sins; for I unworthy entreat Thee, O Father of allCreatures, Thou Who art full of mercy and of compassion, by Thy great goodness,that Thou deign to grant unto me power to see and know these Spirits which I desireto behold and to make to appear before me and to accomplish my will. Through TheeWho art Conqueror, and who art Blessed unto the Ages of the Ages. Amen.O Lord God the Father Eternal, Who art seated upon the Kerubim and the Sera-phim, Who lookest upon Earth and upon Sea; unto Thee do I raise my hands andimplore thine aid alone, Thou who alone art the accomplishment of good works,Thou Who givest rest unto those who labour, Who humblest the proud, who art theAuthor of Life and the Destroyer of Death; Thou art our rest, Thou art the Protectorof those who invoke Thee; protect, guard, and defend me in this matter, and in thisenterprise which I propose to carry out, O Thou who livest, reignest, and abidest untothe Eternal Ages. Amen.During the three last days before the commencement of this action, thou shaltcontent thyself with only eating fasting diet, and that only once in the day; and it willbe better still if thou only partakest of bread and water. Thou shalt also abstain fromevery impure thing; reciting the prayer above written. And on the last day, when thoushalt wish to commence the Operation, thou shalt remain all day without eating, and"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Book TwoPage 91later on thou shalt go into a secret place, where thou shalt confess all thy sins untoGod with a contrite heart. The Disciples also, together with the Master, shall recitethe same Confession with a low but distinct voice, as hath been already said in theFirst Book.This having been done thrice with a devout, pure, and contrite heart, in a placewithdrawn from men, cleansed, and pure, where thou canst not be seen, taking thewater and the hyssop, thou shalt say:Purify me, O Lord, with hyssop, and I shall be pure; wash me and I shall be whiterthan snow.After this, bathe thyself with the exorcised water, and clothe thyself again with theconsecrated garment which thou hast taken off; cense thyself, and surround thyselfwith odours, as will be told farther on, when we speak of perfumes andsuffumigations.The which being done, thou shalt go unto the ordained place with thy Compan-ions, and all things being prepared, thou shalt make the Circle, as hath been alreadysaid, with all other necessary ceremonies; then shalt thou commence to invoke theSpirits by the Exorcisms; thou shalt also repeat anew the foregoing Confession as hathbeen already said in the First Book. After which, in sign of amendment and of repen-tance, each shall mutually kiss the other.Mark well, that up to this point, the Disciples should do the same things as theMaster.Let the Master now give his commands unto his Disciples, and pursue the courseof the Experiment, and work with all diligence to bring it unto perfection."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Key of SolomonPage 92Chapter V.Concerning the Baths, and How They Are To Be Arranged.The Bath is necessary for all Magical and Necromantic Arts; wherefore, if thou wish-est to perform any experiment or operation, having arranged all things necessarythereunto according to the proper days and hours, thou shalt go unto a river or run-ning stream, or thou shalt have warm water ready in some large vessel or tub in thysecret cabinet, and while disrobing thyself of thy raiment thou shalt repeat the follow-ing Psalms: Psalms xiv. or liii; xxvii; liv.; lxxxi; cv.And when the Master shall be entirely disrobed let him enter into the water orinto the Bath, and let him say:THE EXORCISM OF THE WATER.I exorcise Thee, O Creature of water, by Him who hath created thee and gatheredthee together into one place so that the dry land appeared, that thou uncover all thedeceits of the Enemy, and that thou cast out from thee all the impurities and unclean-nesses of the Spirits of the World of Phantasm, so they may harm me not, through thevirtue of God almighty who liveth and reigneth unto the Ages of the Ages.

Such sacrifices consist of the blood and sometimes of the flesh.They who sacrifice animals, of whatsoever kind they be, should select those whichare virgin, as being more agreeable unto the Spirits, and rendering them moreobedient.When blood is to be sacrificed it should be drawn also from virgin quadrupeds orbirds, but before offering the oblation, say:May this Sacrifice which we find it proper to offer unto ye, noble and lofty Beings,be agreeable and pleasing unto your desires; be ye ready to obey us, and ye shallreceive greater ones.Then perfume and sprinkle it according to the rules of Art.When it is necessary, with all the proper Ceremonies, to make Sacrifices of fire,they should be made of wood which hath some quality referring especially unto theSpirits invoked; as juniper or pine unto the Spirits of Saturn; box, or oak, unto thoseof Jupiter; cornel, or cedar, unto those of Mars; laurel unto those of the Sun; myrtleunto those of Venus; hazel unto those of Mercury; and willow unto those of theMoon.But when we make sacrifices of food and drink, everything necessary should beprepared without the Circle, and the meats should be covered with some fine cleancloth, and have also a clean white cloth spread beneath them; with new bread andgood and sparkling wine, but in all things those which refer to the nature of thePlanet. Animals, such as fowls or pigeons, should be roasted. Especially shouldstthou have a vessel of clear and pure fountain water, and before thou enterest into theCircle, thou shalt summon the Spirits by their proper Names, or at least those chiefamong them, saying:In whatsoever place ye may be, ye Spirits, who are invited to this feast, come yeand be ready to receive our offerings, presents, and sacrifices, and ye shall have hereaf-ter yet more agreeable oblations.First perfume the room by burning Incense therein, and sprinkle the viands withexorcised Water; then commence to conjure the Spirits until they shall come.This is the manner of making sacrifices in all arts and operations wherein it isnecessary, and acting thus, the Spirits will be prompt to serve thee."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Key of SolomonPage 122ConclusionHere endeth our \"Key,\" the which if thou thoroughly instillest into thy memory, thoushalt be able, if it pleaseth thee, even to fly with the wings of the wind.

The Amalekites or Aggressors;2. The Geburim or Violent Ones;3. The Raphaim or Cowards;4. The Nephilim or Voluptuous Ones;5. The Anakim or Anarchists.The Anarchists are vanquished by the Yod, which is the Sceptre of the Father.The Violent are vanquished by the HE, which is the Gentleness of the Mother.The Cowards are vanquished by the Vau, which is the Sword of Michael, and Gen-eration by travail and pain.The Voluptuous are vanquished by the second HE, which is the painful bringingforth of the Mother.Lastly, the Aggressors are vanquished by the Schin, which is the Fire of the Lordand the equilibrating Law of Justice.The Princes of the Perverse Spirits are the False Gods whorm they adore.Hell has then no other government than that fatal law which punishes perversityand corrects error, for the false Gods only exist in the false opinion of their adorers.Baal, Belphegor, Moloch, Adramelech, have been the idols of the Syrians; idolswithout soul, idols now destroyed, and of whom the Name alone remaineth.The True God hath vanquished all the Demons as Truth triumphs over Error.That is past in the opinions of men, and the Wars of Michael against Satan are thesymbols of movement, and of the progress of Spirits.The Devil is ever a God of refusal.Accredited idolatries are religions in their time.Superannuated idolatries are Superstitions and Sacrileges.The Pantheon of Phantoms, which are then in vogue, is the Heaven of theIgnorant.The Receptacle of Phantoms, whom Folly even wisheth for no longer, is the Hell.But all this existeth only in the Imagination of the Vulgar.For the wise, Heaven is the Supreme Reason, and Hell is Folly.But it must be understood that we here employ the word Heaven in the Mysticalsense which we give it in opposing to it the word Hell.In order to evoke Phantoms it is sufficient to intoxicate oneself or to render one-self mad; for Phantoms are ever the companions of drunkenness and of vertigo.The Phosphorus of the imagination, abandoned to all the caprices of over-excitedand diseased nerves, fills itself with Monsters and absurd visions.We can also arrive at hallucination by mingling together wakefulness and sleep bythe graduated use of narcotics; but such actions are crimes against nature."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The Key of SolomonPage 126Wisdom chaseth away Phantoms, and enables us to communicate with the Supe-rior Spirits by the contemplation of the Laws of Nature and the study of the HolyNumbers.(Here King Solomon addresseth himself to his son, Roboam):Do thou, O my son Roboam, remember, that the fear of Adonai is only the begin-ning of Wisdom.Keep and preserve those who have not understanding in the Fear of Adonai,which will give and will preserve unto thee my crown.But learn to triumph thyself over Fear by Wisdom, and the Spirits will descendfrom Heaven to serve thee.I, Solomon, thy father, King of Israel and of Palmyra, I have sought out andobtained in my lot the Holy Chokmah, which is the wisdom of Adonai.And I have become King of the Spirits as well of Heaven as of Earth, Master of theDwellers of the Air, and of the Living Souls of the Sea, because I was in possession ofthe Key of the Hidden Gates of Light.I have done great things by the virtue of the Schema Hamphorasch, and by theThirty-two Paths of Yetzirah.Number, weight, and measure determine the form of things; the substance is one,and God createth it eternally.Happy is he who comprehendeth the Letters and the Numbers.The Letters are from the Numbers, and the Numbers from the Ideas, and theIdeas from the Forces, and the Forces from the Elohim.
