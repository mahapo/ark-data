MACGREGOR MATHERSAs a pupil of my late husband and in later years collaborator in his more esoteric studies, I take thisopportunity to say a few words in regard to himself and his work. Moreover, since his death at the end of1918, I have received innumerable visits, letters and enquiries from all parts of the world from students of hiswritings. As most of these questions would appear to bear on his more esoteric knowledge, I will quote hisown words (see page 13, paragraph 22, of the Introduction): \"The term 'Unwritten Qabalah' is applied tocertain knowledge which is never entrusted to writing, but communicated orally. I may say no more on thispoint, nor even whether I myself have or have not received it.\"Simultaneously with the publication of the Qabalah in 1887, he received instructions from his occult teachersto prepare what was eventually to become his esoteric school. In this connection were associated with him thelate Dr. Woodman and the late Dr. Wynn−Westcott, both eminent Masons and Qabalists. They, with myhusband, held high Office in the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, and other Masonic bodies.Since the year 1887, when the first edition of the Qabalah Unveiled appeared, the whole attitude of thethinking world has changed considerably towards occult philosophy and science. The gigantic strides made KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDDedication3"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"by science since the end of the last century, the staggering facts disclosed by its practical demonstrations,simultaneously with the development of the great occult movement, must strike all thoughtful people as theevidence of some imminent change in the evolution of this planet. Material science would appear to bespiritualizing itself and occult science to be materializing itself. If not clasping hands, they are certainlymaking tentative attempts in that direction. The Ancient Wisdom, the Sacred Books, taught. that we cannotunderstand Matter without understanding Spirit, that we cannot understand Spirit without understandingMatter. That Matter and Spirit are only opposite poles of the same universal substance. All through theQabalah runs this axiom: \"that Malkuth is in Kether, that Kether is in Malkuth.\" The same idea is repeatedthrough the Gnostic teaching: \"the earth that is in the heaven, the heaven that is in the earth.\"Religion has its word, science its promises and demonstrations, philosophy its systematized theories, art itscreations and ideals, and yet these in their fundamental separations fall short of that Synthetical ideal whichthe Spirit of Humanity unceasingly demands. There remains always the perpetual cry of humanity, that plaintof a world in pain demanding apparently in vain some solution to the problem of existence. The answer of theancient world to this cry of the Spirit of Humanity is to be found in the establishment of the Mysteries, ascontaining in their penetralia that which even the highest then known forms of religion had not, namely, aphilosophico−religious reply resumed in Formulas and Ceremonies, to the problems of Life and Death, ofNature, of the Gods, of Spiritual Beings, etc., and lastly of the linking of these as a whole back to the FirstCause of all things.In 1888, after the publication of the Qabalah Unveiled, my husband started the working of his esoteric school.To write the consecutive history of an occult Order is a difficult matter, as difficult as to write the life of anAdept, there being so much of an inner and secret nature necessarily involved in both; so much of thesymbolical in the historical, so much of the latter in the symbology.The general constitution of the teaching, the skeleton of the work, was handed to him by his occult teacherstogether with a vast amount of oral instruction. The object of the establishment of this school was similar tothat of the foundation in ancient times of centres for the Celebration of the Mysteries. The literature of thisschool, with a few exceptions, was written by my husband under the direction of these teachers, based uponthe ancient mysteries, chiefly those of Egypt, Chaldea and Greece, and brought up to date to suit the needs ofour modern mentalities. It is a system eminently suited to Western occultism, which a man can follow whileliving the ordinary life of the world, given that this is understood in its highest sense. Dr. Woodman and Dr.Wynn−Westcott aided in the administrative side of this school and its teaching to a certain extent.As a pioneer movement, for the first ten or twelve years it encountered many of the difficulties that besetwork that is given ahead of its time, but we had been told that the beginning would be in the nature of anexperiment and that the students would be sifted. Dr. Woodman had died in the year 1890, and in 1897 Dr.Wynn−Westcott resigned, after which my husband entirely reorganized the school under orders, and furtherteachings were given him. The teaching is principally by Ceremony, Ritual, and Lecture. Purity of aspirationand of life are the first and essential qualities demanded of the student. A simultaneous development of soul,mind and body is insisted upon. The curriculum comprises the study of the intelligent forces behind Nature,the Constitution of man and his relation to God. The whole aim and object of the teaching is to bring a man tothe knowledge of his higher self, to purify himself, to strengthen himself, to develop all qualities and powersof the being, that he may ultimately regain union with the Divine Man latent in himself, that Adam Qadmon,whom God hath made in His Own Image.Great stress is laid on the ideal of Fraternity. The potency of Fraternity has ever been an essential factor in anOccult order, apart from its altruistic aspect; there are. also the spiritual and psychic. Any breach in theharmony of a circle will permit the entry of an opposing force. A Spiritualist of experience will bear witnessto the truth of this statement. KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDDedication4"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Through all the Sacred Books, be they our Bible, the Qabalah, the Egyptian Books, the Vedantic Teachings,the Druidic traditions, etc., the Symbols of the Rose and of the Lily or Lotus and of the Cross, revealthemselves as veritable living images of some great fundamental truth. I am prepared to affirm that anyOrder, Society, group of students, etc., forming themselves with the aim of studying the composition andnature of the manifested Universe, must inevitably fall under the symbolism of the Rose, of the Lily or Lotus,and of the Cross. The Rose with its mysterious centre, its nucleus, the central Sun, is a symbol of the infiniteand harmonious separations of nature.The symbol of the Lily or Lotus is very similar to that of the Rose, with some slight differentiations.We know that the symbol of the Cross is practically the Key−note of the New Testament. It is the Quaternaryin Nature, the four letters of the Holy Name, I.H.V.H., the Tetragrammaton, Jehovah, which with the additionof the letter of the Holy Spirit, Shin, becomes Yeheshuah, the Name of the Messiah. In Alchemy, whetherSpiritual or physical, we are told that the ultimate secret is to find the centre of the Cross. A trueunderstanding of the four−lettered Name, containing as it does the powers of the four elements of nature, Air,Water, Fire, and Earth, from their lowest degree to their highest aspect, would imply a knowledge and powerof creation as well as that of death and destruction. Is it not for this reason that its pronunciation has beenforbidden by the Qabalist? The Ancient Wisdom implied that this Name might only be pronounced by theInitiate who has attained the Supreme Initiation, that is to say \"He who has learnt to be One with the FIRSTMOVER and be His Will.\"Regarding the distinction between monotheism, polytheism and pantheism, this distinction hardly exists forthe Initiate. Verily there is little difference between a single God and a harmony of Supreme Forces, soabsolutely linked that the effect would be that of an indivisible unit, a plurality whose action is unified, anunity whose action is pluralised.Concerning Science and its \"missing links,\" occult Science has asserted that there exists no void in theUniverse, and that the \"missing links\" are to be found in the invisible world. Modern Science and Philosophyare continually demonstrating that our physical senses are limited and cognize but little in proportion to thatperceived by the more subtle methods. Sir Oliver Lodge says: \"A physicist is never limited to direct sensoryimpressions. He has to deal with a multitude of conceptions and things for which he has no physical organ:the dynamical theory of heat, for instance, and of gases, the theory of electricity, of Magnetism, of chemicalaffinity, of cohesion, aye, and his apprehension of the ether itself, lead him into regions where sight andhearing and touch are impotent as direct witnesses . . . . . . . in such regions everything has to be interpreted interms of the insensible, the apparently unsubstantial, and in a definite sense, the imaginary.\" Again he says: \"Iam reasonably convinced of the existence of grades of beings not only lower in the scale than man, but higheralso, grades of every order of magnitude, from zero to infinity, and I know from experience that among theseBeings are some who care for and help and guide humanity . . . . . and further it is my faith\u0014however humblyit may be held\u0014that among these lofty beings, highest of those who concern themselves directly with thisearth, of all the myriads of worlds in infinite space, is ONE on Whom the right instinct of Christianity hasalways lavished heartfelt reverence and devotion.\" Here is an almost parallel idea taken from EgyptianSymbolism: \"Concerning the harmonious linking together of the divine and the natural; as in the vision ofthe ladder of Jacob whereon the Angels of God ascended and descended. As also in the very ancient ideals ofEgypt, Chaldea, China, India, etc., there was the conception of an unbroken chain proceeding from thehighest Godhead, through Gods; angels; spirits, genii; souls, whether in our life or another; spiritual beings;and ultimating through the sacred animals upon the very Ground of Earth Itself, and also even through thetrees, plants and minerals. What, then, can be such a chain that links all things unto their divine Origin?Surely it cannot be other than the Descending Divine Influence MEZLA; the Influence of the HOLY andDIVINE SPIRIT.\"Take this Divine Spirit in its Triune Manifestation, call it Light, Life, and Love, call it Father, Son, and Holy KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDDedication5"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Spirit, or Father, Mother, Son; take Radium as being so very close in nature to the one element of theAncients and note its triune manifestation, through the alpha, beta and gamma rays.Regarding seers and mediums, as before remarked, our school lays great stress on the simultaneousdevelopment of, crudely speaking, the three planes of being. which development must precede psychicexperiment. The methods employed to equilibrate the nature entail considerable study, time and patience.There is no royal road to any science, let alone the science of the occult. Before touching such experiments asobtain in spiritualism, the student would be supposed to be in a measure aware of the nature of the entities hewould be likely to encounter, and especially to have some idea of the constitution of Man. When this isachieved he will be equipped and enabled to face the many dangers and difficulties he will encounter in theinvisible world.Take the astral plane in its varied divisions, where some of the adventures described by the seer take place.This plane may be described as a hall panelled with mirrors, where one is confronted with bewilderingreflexes. Manifesting therein are numerous and varying entities.Spiritualism is distinctly a Western movement and has certainly been the means of bringing conviction of theafter life to many. The methods employed by spiritualists may be very dangerous, in that they frequently lackthe preliminary preparation and knowledge necessary before approaching psychic phenomena. Thespiritualist who lacks this specialized knowledge must be prepared to encounter all the dangers with whichexplorers in unknown lands are beset. He who enters into these regions has sometimes found it easier to openthe door than to close it.A few words which may be of interest on my husband's life. As a very young boy he was intensely interestedin mysticism and symbolism generally. He was educated at Bedford Grammar School, −specializing on theClassical side. During his spare moments he collected and made a special study of Celtic tradition andsymbolism. This love of Celtic Symbology was inherited from his Highland ancestry. His ancestor, IanMacGregor of Glenstrae, an ardent Jacobite, after the /45 Rebellion went over to France and under LallyTolendal fought at Pondicherry. This ancestor was created Comte de Glenstrae by Louis XV. This Frenchtitle was inherited by my husband and he always used it when living in France. As a young man he came intocontact with Kenneth Mackenzie, with whom he had a strong occult link. Kenneth Mackenzie, author of theEncyclopædia of Masonry, had been a great friend of Bulwer Lytton. After some years of seclusion in thecountry, where my husband led a student's life in preparation for his future work, he met Anna Kingsford,who introduced him to Madame Blavatsky. Madame Blavatsky invited him to collaborate with her in theformation of her Society. After deliberation, notwithstanding his profound admiration for that remarkablewoman, this invitation he was compelled to decline. Their ideals were not entirely the same. At that time hewas more in sympathy with Anna Kingsford's ideals of esoteric Christianity and of the advancement ofwoman. Moreover he was profoundly interested in her campaign against vivisection, in which he vigorouslyaided her. Three or four years later he was told by his Occult teachers to transfer his centre to Paris, where myhusband and I lived for the rest of his life. I wish here to record my thanks to my occult masters, and thedeepest gratitude to the memory of my husband, comrade and teacher, all of whom have shed such light uponmy path.M. MACGREGOR MATHERS.KABBALAH. KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDKABBALAH.6"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION.I. THE first questions which the non−qabalistical reader will probably ask are: What is the Qabalah? Whowas its author? What are its sub−divisions? What are its general teachings? And why is a translation of itrequired at the present time?2. I will answer the last question first. At the present time a powerful wave of occult thought is spreadingthrough society; thinking men are beginning to awake to the fact that \"there are more things in heaven andearth than are dreamed of in their philosophy;\" and, last but not least, it is now felt that the Bible, which hasbeen probably more misconstrued than any other book ever written, contains numberless obscure andmysterious passages which are utterly unintelligible without some key wherewith to unlock their meaning.THAT KEY IS GIVEN IN THE QABALAH. Therefore this work should be of interest to every biblical andtheological student. Let every Christian ask himself this question: \"How can I think to understand the OldTestament if I be ignorant of the construction put upon it by that nation whose sacred book it formed; and if Iknow not the meaning of the Old Testament, how can I expect to understand the New?\" Were the real andsublime philosophy of the Bible better known, there would be fewer fanatics and sectarians. And who cancalculate the vastness of the harm done to impressionable and excitable persons by the bigoted enthusiastswho ever and anon come forward as teachers of the people? How many suicides are the result of religiousmania and depression! What farragos of sacrilegious nonsense have not been promulgated as the truemeanings of the books of the Prophets and the Apocalypse! Given a translation of the sacred Hebrew Book,in many instances incorrect, as the foundation, an inflamed and an ill−balanced mind as the worker thereon,what sort of edifice can be expected as the result? I say fearlessly to the fanatics and bigots of the present day:You have cast down the Sublime and Infinite One from His throne, and in His stead have placed the demonof unbalanced force; you have substituted a deity of disorder and of jealousy for a God of order and of love;you have perverted the teachings of the crucified One. Therefore at this present time an English translation ofthe Qabalah is almost a necessity, for the Zohar has never before been translated into the language of thiscountry, nor, as far as I am aware, into any modern European vernacular.3. The Qabalah may be defined as being the esoteric Jewish doctrine. It is called in Hebrew QBLH, Qabalah,which is derived from the root QBL, Qibel, meaning \"to receive.\" This appellation refers to the custom ofhanding down the esoteric knowledge by oral transmission, and is nearly allied to \"tradition.\"4. As in the present work a great number of Hebrew or Chaldee words have to be used in the text, and thenumber of scholars in the Shemitic languages is limited, I have thought it more advisable to print such wordsin ordinary Roman characters, carefully retaining the exact orthography. I therefore append a table showing ata glance the ordinary Hebrew and Chaldee alphabet (which is common to both languages), the Romancharacters by which I have expressed its letters in this work; also their names, powers, and numerical values. There areno separate numeral characters in Hebrew and Chaldee; therefore, as is also the case in Greek, each letter hasits own peculiar numerical value, and from this circumstance results the important fact that every word is anumber, and every number is a word. This is alluded to in Revelations, where \"the number of the beast\" ismentioned, and on this correspondence between words and numbers the science of Gematria (the firstdivision of the so−called literal Qabalah) is based. I shall refer to this subject again. I have selected theRoman letter Q to represent the Hebrew Qoph or Koph, a precedent for the use of which without a followingm may be found in Max Müller's \"Sacred Books of the East.\" The reader must remember that the Hebrew isalmost entirely a consonantal alphabet, the vowels being for the most part supplied by small points and marksusually placed below the letters. Another difficulty of the Hebrew alphabet consists in the great similaritybetween the forms of certain letters\u0014e.g., V, Z, and final N.5. With regard to the author and origin of the Qabalah, I cannot do better than give the following extract from KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDINTRODUCTION.7"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Dr. Ginsburg's \"Essay on the Kabbalah,\" first premising that this word has been spelt in a great variety ofways\u0014Cabala, Kabalah, Kabbala, &c. I have adopted the form Qabalah, as being more consonant with theHebrew writing of the word.6. \"A system of religious philosophy, or, more properly, of theosophy, which has not only exercised forhundreds of years an extraordinary influence on the mental development of so shrewd a people as the Jews,but has captivated the minds of some of the greatest thinkers of Christendom in the sixteenth and seventeenthcenturies, claims the greatest attention of both the philosopher and the theologian. When it is added thatamong its captives were Raymond Lully, the celebrated scholastic metaphysician and chemist (died 1315);John Reuchlin, the renowned scholar. and reviver of Oriental literature in Europe (born 1455, died 1522);John Picus de Mirandola, the famous philosopher and classical scholar (1463−1494); Cornelius HenryAgrippa, the distinguished philosopher, divine, and physician (1486−1535); John Baptist Von Helmont, aremarkable chemist and physician (1577−1644); as well as our own countrymen, Robert Fludd, the famousphysician and philosopher (1574−1637); and Dr. Henry More (1614−1687); and that these men, afterrestlessly searching for a scientific system which should disclose to them 'the deepest depths' of the divinemature, and show them the real tie which binds all things together, found the cravings of their minds satisfiedby this theosophy, the claims of the Kabbalah on the attention of students in literature and philosophy willreadily be admitted. The claims of the Kabbalah, however, are not restricted to the literary man and thephilosopher; the poet too will find in it ample materials for the exercise of his lofty genius. How can it beotherwise with a theosophy which, we are assured, was born of God in Paradise, was nursed and reared bythe choicest of the angelic hosts in heaven, and only held converse with the holiest of man's children uponearth. Listen to the story of. its birth, growth, and maturity, as told by its followers.7. \"The Kabbalah was first taught by God himself to a select company of angels, who formed a theosophicschool in Paradise. After the Fall the angels most graciously communicated this heavenly doctrine to thedisobedient child of earth, to furnish the protoplasts with the means of returning to their pristine nobility andfelicity. From Adam it passed over to Noah, and then to Abraham, the friend of God, who emigrated with itto Egypt, where the patriarch allowed a portion of this mysterious doctrine to ooze out. It was in this way thatthe Egyptians obtained some knowledge of it, and the other Eastern nations could introduce it into theirphilosophical systems. Moses, who was learned in all the wisdom of Egypt, was first initiated into theQabalah in the land of his birth, but became most proficient in it during his wanderings in the wilderness,when he not only devoted to it the leisure hours of the whole forty years, but received lessons in it from oneof the angels. By the aid of this mysterious science the law−giver was enabled to solve the difficulties whicharose during his management of the Israelites, in spite of the pilgrimages, wars, and frequent miseries of thenation. He covertly laid down the principles of this secret doctrine in the first four books of the Pentateuch,but withheld them from Deuteronomy. Moses also initiated the seventy elders into the secrets of this doctrine,and they again transmitted them from hand to hand. Of all who formed the unbroken line of tradition, Davidand Solomon were the most deeply initiated into the Kabbalah. No one, however, dared to write it down, tillSchimeon Ben Jochai, who lived at the time of the destruction of the second temple . . . . . After his death, hisson, Rabbi Eleazar, and his secretary, Rabbi Abba, as well as his disciples, collated Rabbi Simon Ben Jochai'streatises, and out of these composed the celebrated work called ZHR, Zohar, splendour, which is the grandstorehouse of Kabbalism.\"8. The Qabalah is usually classed under four heads:(±The practical Qabalah.(²The literal Qabalah.(³The unwritten Qabalah. KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDINTRODUCTION.8"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"( ́The dogmatic Qabalah.9. The practical Qabalah deals with talismanic and ceremonial magic, and does not come within the scope ofthis work.10. The literal Qabalah is referred to in several places, and therefore a knowledge of its leading principles isnecessary. It is divided into three parts: GMTRIA, Gematria; NVTRIQVN, Notariqon; and ThMVRH,Temura.11. Gematria is a metathesis of the Greek word 553±It is based on the relative numerical values of words, as Ihave before remarked. Words of similar numerical values are considered to be explanatory of each other, andthis theory is also extended to phrases. Thus the letter Shin, Sh, is 300, and is equivalent to the numberobtained by adding up the numerical values of the letters of the words RVCh ALHIM, Ruach Elohim, thespirit of the Elohim; and it is therefore a symbol of the spirit of the Elohim. For R = 200, V = 6, Ch = 8, A =z, L = 30, H = 5, I = 10, M = 40; total = 300. Similarly, the words AChD, Achad, Unity, One, and AHBH,Ahebah, love, each = 13; for A = 1, Ch = 8, D = 4, total = 13; and A = 1, H = 5, B = 2, H = 5, total = 13.Again, the name of the angel MTTRVN, Metatron or Methraton , and the name of the Deity, ShDI, Shaddaï,each make 314; so the one is taken as symbolical of the other. The angel Metraton is said to have been theconductor of the children of Israel through the wilderness, of whom God says, \"My Name is in him.\" Withregard to Gematria of phrases (Gen. xlix. 10), IBA ShILH, Yeba Shiloa, \"Shiloh shall come\" = 358, which isthe numeration of the word MShICh, Messiah. Thus also the passage, Gen. xviii. 2 VHNH ShLShH, VehennaShalisha, \"And lo, three men,\" equals in numerical value ALV MIKAL GBRIAL VRPAL, Elo MihkaelGabriel Ve−Raphael, \"These are Mikhael, Gabriel and Raphael;\" for each phrase = 70l. I think theseinstances will suffice to make clear the nature of Gematria, especially as many others will be found in thecourse of the ensuing work.12. Notariqon is derived from the Latin word nothrius, a shorthand writer. Of Notariqon there are two forms.In the first every letter of a word is taken for the initial or abbreviation of another word, so that from theletters of a word a sentence may be formed. Thus every letter of the word BRAShITh, Berashith, the firstword in Genesis, is made the initial of a word, and we obtain BRAShITh RAH ALHIM ShIQBLV IShRALThVRH, Besrashith Rahi Eloim Sheyequebelo Israel Torah: \"In the beginning the Elohim saw that Israelwould accept the law.\" In this connection I may give six very interesting specimens of Notariqon formedfrom this same word BRAShITh by Solomon Meir Ben Moses, a Jewish Qabalist, who embraced theChristian faith in 1665, and took the name of Prosper Rugers. These have all a Christian tendency, and bytheir means Prosper converted another Jew, who had previously been bitterly opposed to Christianity. Thefirst is BN RVCh AB ShLVShThM IChD ThMIM, Ben, Ruach, Ab, Shaloshethem Yechad Themim : \"TheSon, the Spirit, the Father, Their Trinity, Perfect Unity.\" The second is, BN RVCh AB ShLVShThM IChDThOBVDV, Ben, Ruach, Ab, Shaloshethem Yechad Thaubodo: \"The Son, the Spirit, the Father, ye shallequally worship Their Trinity.\" The third is, BKVRI RAShVNI AShR ShMV IShVO ThOBVDV, BekoriRashuni Asher Shamo Yeshuah Thaubodo: \"Ye shall worship My first−born, My first, Whose Name is Jesus.\"The fourth is, BBVA RBN AShR ShMV IShVO ThOBVDV, Beboa Rabban Asher Shamo YesuahThaubado: \"When the Master shall come Whose Name is Jesus ye shall worship.\" The fifth is, BThVLHRAVIH ABChR ShThLD IShVO ThAShRVH, Bethulah Raviah Abachar Shethaled Yeshuah Thrashroah: \"Iwill choose a virgin worthy to bring forth Jesus, and ye shall call her blessed.\" The sixth is, BOVGThRTzPIM ASThThR ShGVPI IShVO ThAKLV, Beaugoth Ratzephim Assattar Shegopi Yeshuah Thakelo: \"Iwill hide myself in cake (baked with) coals, for ye shall eat Jesus, My Body.\" The Qabalistical importance ofthese sentences as bearing upon the doctrines of Christianity can hardly be overrated.13. The second form of Notariqon is the exact reverse of the first. By this the initials or finals, or both, or themedials, of a sentence, are taken to form a word or words. Thus the Qabalah is called ChKMh NSThRH,Chokhmah Nesethrah, \"the secret wisdom;\" and if we take the initials of these two words Ch and N, we form KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDINTRODUCTION.9"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"by the second kind of Notariqon the word ChN, Chen, \"grace.\" Similarly, from the initials and finals of thewords MI IOLH LNV HShMIMH, Mi Iaulah Leno Ha−Shamayima, \"Who shall go up for us to heaven?\"(Deut. xxx. 12), are formed MILH, Milah, \"circumcision,\" and IHVH, the Tetragrammaton, implying thatGod hath ordained circumcision as the way to heaven.14. Temura is permutation. According to certain rules, one letter is substituted for another letter preceding orfollowing it in the alphabet, and thus from one word another word of totally different orthography may beformed. Thus the alphabet is bent exactly in half, in the middle, and one half is put over the other; and then bychanging alternately the first letter or the first two letters at the beginning of the second line, twenty−twocommutations are produced. These are called the \"Table of the Combinations of TzIRVP,\" Tzirupa. Forexample's sake, I will give the method called ALBTh, Albath, thus:1110987654321KITChZVHDGBAMNSOPTzQRShThLEach method takes its name from the first two pairs composing it, the system of pairs of letters being thegroundwork of the whole, as either letter in a pair is substituted for the other letter. Thus, by Albath, fromRVCh, Ruach, is formed DTzO, Detzau. The names of the other twenty−one methods are: ABGTh, AGDThADBG, AHBD, AVBH, AZBV, AChBZ, ATBCh, AIBT, AKBI, ALBK, AMBL, ANBM, ASBN, AOBS,APBO, ATzBP, AQBTz, ARBQ, AShBR, and AThBSh. To these must be added the modes ABGD andALBM. Then comes the \"Rational Table of Tziruph,\" another set of twenty−two combinations. There are alsothree \"Tables of the Commutations,\" known respectively as the Right, the Averse, and the Irregular. To makeany of these, a square, containing 484 squares, should be made, and the letters written in. For the \"RightTable\" write the alphabet across from right to left; in the second row of squares do the same, but begin with Rand end with A; in the third begin with G and end with B; and so on. For the \"Averse Table\" write thealphabet from right to left backwards, beginning with Th and ending with A; in the second row begin with Shand end with Th, &c. The \"Irregular Table\" would take too long to describe. Besides all these, there is themethod called ThShRQ, Thashraq, which is simply writing a word backwards. There is one more veryimportant form, called the \"Qabalah of the Nine Chambers,\" or AIQ BKR, Aiq Bekar. It is thus formed:300303200202100101000000000000000000 KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDINTRODUCTION.10"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"ShLGRKBQIA600606500505400404000000000000000000M finalSVK finalNHThMD900909800808700707000000000000000000T finalTzTP finalPChN finalOZI have put the numeration of each letter above to, show the affinity between the letters in each chamber.Sometimes this is used as a cipher, by taking the portions of the figure to show the letters they contain,putting one point for the first letter, two for the second, &c. Thus the right angle, containing AIQ, will answerfor the letter Q if it have three dots or points within it. Again, a square will answer for H, N, or K final,according to whether it has one, two, or three points respectively placed within it. So also with regard to theother letters. But there are many other ways of employing the Qabalah of the Nine Chambers, which I havenot space to describe. I will merely mention, as an example, that by the mode of Temura called AThBSh,Athbash, it is found that in Jeremiah xxv. 26, the word ShShK, Sheshakh, symbolizes BBL, Babel.15. Besides all these rules, there are certain meanings hidden in the shape of the letters of the Hebrewalphabet; in the form of a particular letter at the end of a word being different from that which it generallybears when it is a final letter, or in a letter being written in the middle of a word in a character generally usedonly at the end; in any letter or letters being written in a size smaller or larger than the rest of the manuscript,or in a letter being written upside down; in the variations found in the spelling of certain words, which have aletter more in some places than they have in others; in peculiarities observed in the position of any of thepoints or accents, and in certain expressions supposed to be elliptic or redundant.16. For example the shape of the Hebrew letter Aleph, A (see Plate I.), is said to symbolize a Vau, V, betweena Yod, I, and a Daleth, D; and thus the letter itself represents the word IVD, Yod. Similarly the shape of theletter He, H, represents a Daleth, D, with a Yod, I, written at the lower left−hand corner, &c.

In Isaiah ix. 6, 7, the word LMRBH, Lemarbah, for multiplying, is written with the character for M finalin the middle of the word, instead of with the ordinary initial and Medial M. The consequence of this is thatthe total numerical value of the word, instead of being 30 +40+ 200+ 2+5 = 277, is 30 + 600 + 200 + 2 + 5 =837 = by Gematria ThTh ZL, Tat Zal, the profuse Giver. Thus, by writing the M final instead of the ordinarycharacter, the word is made to bear a different qabalistical meaning.18. In Deuteronomy vi. 4, &c., is the prayer known as the \"Shema Yisrael.\" It begins, \"ShMO IShRAL IHVHALHINV IHVH AChD, Shemaa Yisrael, Tetragrammaton Elohino Tetragrammaton Achad: \"Hear, O Israel,Tetragrammaton your God is Tetragrammaton Unity.\" In this verse the terminal letter O in ShMO, and the Din AChD are written much larger than the other letters of the text. The qabalistical symbology contained inthis circumstance is thus explained: The letter O, being of the value of 70, shows that the law may beexplained in seventy different ways, and the D = 4 = the four cardinal points and the letters of the HolyName. The first word, ShMO, has the numerical value of 410, the number of years of the duration of the firsttemple, &c. &c. There are many other points worthy of consideration in this prayer, but time will not permitme to dwell on them.19. Other examples of deficient and redundant spelling, peculiarities of accent and pointing, &c., will befound in various places in the ensuing work.20. It is to be further noted with regard to the first word in the Bible, BRAShITh, Berashith, that the firstthree letters, BRA, are the initial letters of the names of the three persons of the Trinity: BN, Ben, the Son;RVCh, Ruach, the Spirit; and AB, Ab, the Father. Furthermore, the first letter of the Bible is B, which is theinitial letter of BRKH, Berakhah, blessing; and not A, which is that of ARR, Arar, cursing. Again, the lettersof Berashith, taking their numerical powers, express the number of years between the Creation and the birthof Christ, thus: B = 2,000, R = 200, A = 1000, Sh = 300, I = 10, and Th = 400; total = 3910 years, beingthe time in round numbers. Picus de Mirandola gives the following working out of BRAShITh,Berashith:\u0014By joining the third letter, A, to the first, B, A B, Ab = Father, is obtained. If to the first letter B,doubled, the second letter, R, be added, it makes BBR, Bebar = in or through the Son. If all the letters be readexcept the first, it makes RAShITh, Rashith = the beginning. If with the fourth letter, Sh, the first B and thelast Th be connected, it makes ShBTh, Shebeth = the end or rest. If the first three letters be taken, they makeBRA, Bera = created. If, omitting the first, the three following be taken, they make RASh, Rash = head. If,omitting the two first, the next two be taken, they give ASh, Ash = fire. If the fourth and last be joined, theygive ShTh, Sheth = foundation. Again, if the second letter be put before the first, it makes RB, Rab = great. Ifafter the third be placed the fifth and fourth, it gives AISh, Aish = man. If to the two first be joined the twolast, they give BRITh, Berith = covenant. And if the first be added to the last, it gives ThB, Theb, which issometimes used for TVB, Thob = good.21. Taking the whole of these mystical anagrams in proper order, Picus makes the following sentence out ofthis one word BRAShITh:\u0014 Pater in filio (aut per filium), principium et finem (sive quietum) creavit caput,ignem, et fundamentum magni hominis fœdere bono: \"Through the Son hath the Father created that Headwhich is the beginning and the end, the fire−life and the foundation of the supernal man (the Adam Qadmon)by His righteous covenant.\" Which is a short epitome of the teachings of the \"Book of Concealed Mystery.\"This notice of the literal Qabalah has already extended beyond its proper limits. It was, however, necessary tobe thus explicit, as much of the metaphysical reasoning of the ensuing work turns on its application.22. The term \"Unwritten Qabalah\" is applied to certain knowledge which is never entrusted to writing, butcommunicated orally. I may say no more on this point, not even whether I myself have or have not receivedit. Of course, till the time of Rabbi Schimeon Ben Jochai none of the Qabalah was ever written.23. The Dogmatic Qabalah contains the doctrinal portion. There are a large number of treatises of variousdates and merits which go to make up the written Qabalah, but they may be reduced to four heads: KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDINTRODUCTION.12"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"(±The Sepher Yetzirah and its dependencies.(²The Zohar with its developments and commentaries.(³The Sepher Sephiroth and its expansions.( ́The Asch Metzareph and its symbolism.24. The SPR ITzIRH, Sepher Yetzirah, or \"Book of Formation,\" is ascribed to the patriarch Abraham. It treatsof the cosmogony as symbolized by the ten numbers and the twenty−two. letters of the alphabet, which itcalls the \"thirty−two paths.\" On these latter Rabbi Abraham Ben Dior has written a mystical commentary.The term \"path\" is used throughout the Qabalah to signify a hieroglyphical idea, or rather the sphere of ideas,which may be attached to any glyph or symbol.25. The ZHR, Zohar, or \"Splendour,\" besides many other treatises of less note, contains the following mostimportant books, of which the three first are translated in this volume:(±The SPRA DTzNIOVThA, Siphra Dtzenioutha, or \"Book of Concealed Mystery,\" which isthe root and foundation of the Zohar.(²The ADRA RBA QDIShA, Idra Rabba Qadisha or \"Greater Holy Assembly:\" this is adevelopment of the \"Book of Concealed Mystery.\"(³The ADRA ZVTA QDIShA, Idra Zuta Qadisha, or \"Lesser Holy Assembly;\" which is inthe nature of a supplement to the \"Idra Rabba.\" These three books treat of the gradualdevelopment of the creative Deity, and with Him theCreation. The text of these works has been annotated by Knorr von Rosenroth (the author ofthe \"Qabalah Denudata,\") from the Mantuan, Cremonensian, and Lublinensian Codices,which are corrected printed copies; of these the Mantuan and Cremonensian are the oldest. Aspecies of commentary is also given, which is distinguished from the actual text by beingwritten within parentheses.( ́The pneumatical treatise called BITh ALHIM, Beth Elohim, or the \"House of the Elohim,\"edited by Rabbi Abraham Cohen Irira, from the doctrines of Rabbi Yitzchaq Loria. It treatsof angels, demons, elemental spirits, and souls.(μThe \"Book of the Revolutions of Souls\" is a peculiar and discursive treatise, and is anexpansion of Rabbi Loria's ideas.26. The SPR SPIRVTh, Sepher Sephiroth, or \"Book of the Emanations,\" describes, so to speak, the gradualevolution of the Deity from negative into positive existence.27. The ASh MTzRP, Asch Metzareph, or \"Purifying Fire,\" is hermatic and alchemical, and is known to few,and when known is understood by still fewer.28. The principal doctrines of the Qabalah are designed to solve the following problems:\u0014(±The Supreme Being, His nature and attributes.(²The Cosmogony. KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDINTRODUCTION.13"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"(³The creation of angels and man.( ́The destiny of man and angels.(μThe nature of the soul.(¶The nature of angels, demons, and elementals.(·The import of the revealed law.( ̧The transcendental symbolism of numerals.(¹The peculiar mysteries contained in the Hebrew letters.(ºThe equilibrium of contraries.29. The \"Book of Concealed Mystery\" opens with these words: \"The Book of Concealed Mystery is the bookof the equilibrium of balance.\" What is here meant by the terms \"equilibrium of balance\"? Equilibrium is thatharmony which results from the analogy of contraries, it is the dead centre where, the opposition of opposingforces being equal in strength, rest succeeds motion. It is the central point. It is the \"point within the circle\" ofancient symbolism. It is the living synthesis of counterbalanced power. Thus form may be described as theequilibrium of light and shade; take away either factor, and form is viewless. The term balance is applied tothe two opposite natures in each triad of the Sephiroth, their equilibrium forming the third Sephira in eachternary. I shall recur again to this subject in explaining the Sephiroth. This doctrine of equilibrium andbalance is a fundamental qabalistical idea.30. The \"Book of Concealed Mystery\" goes on to, state that this \"Equilibrium hangeth in that region which isnegatively existent.\" What is negative existence? What is positive existence? The distinction between thesetwo is another fundamental idea. To define negative existence clearly is impossible, for when it is distinctlydefined it ceases to be negative existence; it is then negative existence passing into static condition. Thereforewisely have the Qabalists shut out from mortal comprehension the primal AIN, Ain, the negatively existentOne, and the AIN SVP, Ain Soph, the limitless Expansion; while of even the AIN SVP AVR, Ain Soph Aur ,the illimitable Light, only a dim conception can be formed. Yet, if we think deeply, we shall see that suchmust be the primal forms of the unknowable and nameless One, whom we, in the more manifest form speakof as GOD. He is the Absolute. But how define the Absolute? Even as we define it, it slips from our grasp,for it ceases when defined to be the Absolute. Shall we then say that the Negative, the limitless, the Absoluteare, logically speaking, absurd, since they are ideas which our reason cannot define? No; for could we definethem, we should make them, so to speak, contained by our reason, and therefore not superior to it; for asubject to be capable of definition it is requisite that certain limits should be assignable to it. How then canwe limit the Illimitable?31. The first principle and axiom of the Qabalah is the name of the Deity, translated in our version of theBible, \"I am that I am,\" AHIH AShR AHIH, Eheieh Asher Eheieh. A better translation is, \"Existence isexistence,\" or \"I am He who is.\"32. Eliphaz Levi Zahed, that great philosopher and Qabalist of the present century, says in his \"Histoire de laMagie\" (bk. i. ch. 7): \"The Qabalists have a horror of everything that resembles idolatry; they, however,ascribe the human form to God, but it is a purely hieroglyphical figure. They consider God as the intelligent,living, and loving Infinite One. He is for them neither the collection of other beings, nor the abstraction ofexistence, nor a philosophically definable being. He is in all, distinct from all, and greater than all. His veryname is ineffable; and yet this name only expresses the human ideal of His Divinity. What God is in Himself KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDINTRODUCTION.14"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"it is not given to man to know. God is the absolute of faith; existence is the absolute of reason, existenceexists by itself, and because it exists. The reason of the existence of existence is existence itself. We may ask,'Why does any particular thing exist?' that is, 'Why does such or such a thing exist?' But we cannot ask,without its being absurd to do so, Why does existence exist?' For this would be to suppose existence prior toexistence.\" Again, the same author says (ibid. bk. iii. ch. 2): \"To say, 'I will believe when the truth of thedogma shall be scientifically proved to me,' is the same as to say, 'I will believe when I have nothing more tobelieve, and when the dogma shall be destroyed as dogma by becoming a scientific theorem.' That is to say,in other words: 'I will only admit the Infinite when it shall have been explained, determined, circumscribed,and defined for my benefit; in one word, when it has become finite. I will then believe in the Infinite when Iam sure that the Infinite does not exist. I will believe in the vastness of the ocean when I shall have seen it putinto bottles.' But when a thing has been clearly proved and made comprehensible to you, you will no longerbelieve it\u0014you will know it.\"33. In the \"Bhagavadgîtâ,\" ch. ix., it is said: \"I am Immortality and also death; and I, O Arguna! am thatwhich is and that which is not.\" And again (ch. ix.): \"And, O descendant of Bharata! see wonders innumbers, unseen before. Within my body, O Gudâkesa! see to−day the whole universe, including everythingmovable and immovable, all in one.\" And again (ibid.) Arguna said: \"O Infinite Lord of the Gods! O Thouwho pervadest the universe! Thou art the Indestructible, that which is, that which is not, and what is beyondthem. Thou art the Primal God, the Ancient One; Thou are the highest support of this universe. By Thee isthis universe pervaded, O Thou of the infinite forms . . . . Thou art of infinite power, of unmeasured glory;Thou pervadest all, and therefore Thou art all!\"34. The idea of negative existence can then exist as an idea, but it will not bear definition, since the idea ofdefinition is utterly incompatible with its nature. \"But,\" some of my readers will perhaps say, \"your termnegative existence is surely a misnomer; the state you describe would be better expressed by the title ofnegative subsistence.\" Not so, I answer; for negative subsistence can never be anything but negativesubsistence; it cannot vary, it cannot develop; for negative subsistence is literally and truly no thing.Therefore, negative subsistence cannot be at all; it never has existed, it never does exist, it never will exist.But negative existence bears hidden in itself, positive life; for in the limitless depths of the abyss of itsnegativity lies hidden the power of standing forth from itself, the power of projecting the scintilla of thethought unto the utter, the power of re−involving the syntagma into the inner. Thus shrouded and veiled is theabsorbed intensity in the centreless whirl of the vastness of expansion. Therefore have I employed the term\"Ex−sto,\" rather than \"Sub−sto.\"35. But between two ideas so different as those of negative and positive existence a certain nexus, orconnecting−link, is required, and hence we arrive at the form which is called potential existence, which whilemore nearly approaching positive existence, will still scarcely admit of clear definition. It is existence in itspossible form. For example, in a seed, the tree which may spring from it is hidden; it is in a condition ofpotential existence; is there; but it will not admit of definition. How much less, then, will those seeds whichthat tree in its turn may yield. But these latter are in a condition which, while it is somewhat analogous topotential existence, is in hardly so advanced a stage; that is, they are negatively existent.36. But, on the other hand, positive existence is always capable of definition; it is dynamic; it has certainevident powers, and it is therefore the antithesis of negative existence, and still more so of negativesubsistence. It is the tree, no longer hidden in the seed, but developed into the outer. But positive existencehas a beginning and an end, and it therefore requires another form from which to depend, for without thisother concealed negative ideal behind it, it is unstable and unsatisfactory.37. Thus, then, have I faintly and with all reverence endeavoured to shadow forth to the minds of my readersthe idea of the Illimitable One. And before that idea, and of that idea, I can only say, in the words of anancient oracle: \"In Him is an illimitable abyss of glory, and from it there goeth forth one little spark which KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDINTRODUCTION.15"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"maketh all the glory of the sun, and of the moon, and of the stars. Mortal! behold how little I know of God;seek not to know more of Him, for this is far beyond thy comprehension, however wise thou art; as for us,who are His ministers, how small a part are we of Him! \"38. There are three qabalistical veils of the negative existence, and in themselves they formulate the hiddenideas of the Sephiroth not yet called into being, and they are concentrated in Kether, which in this sense is theMalkuth of the hidden ideas of the Sephiroth. I will explain this. The first veil of the negative existence is theAIN, Ain = Negativity. This word consists of three letters, which thus shadow forth the first three Sephirothor numbers. The second veil is the AIN SVP, Ain Soph = the Limitless, This title consists of six letters, andshadows forth the idea of the first six Sephiroth or numbers. The third veil is the AIN SVP AVR, Ain SophAur = the Limitless Light. This again consists of nine letters, and symbolizes the first nine Sephiroth, but ofcourse in their hidden idea only. But when we reach the number nine we cannot progress farther withoutreturning to the unity, or the Dumber one, fur the number ten is but a repetition of unity freshly derived fromthe negative, as is evident from a glance at its ordinary representation in Arabic numerals, where the circle 0represents the Negative, and the 1 the Unity. Thus, then, the limitless ocean of negative light does notproceed from a centre, for it is centreless, but it concentrates a centre, which is the number one of themanifested Sephiroth, Kether, the Crown, the First Sephira; which therefore may be said to be the Malkuth ornumber ten of the hidden Sephiroth. (See Plate II.). Thus, \"Kether is in Malkuth, and Malkuth is in Kether.\"Or, as an alchemical author of great repute (Thomas Vaughan, better known as Eugenius Philalethes) says, apparently quoting from Proclus: \"That the heaven is in the earth, but after an earthly manner; and that theearth is in the heaven, but after a heavenly manner.\" But inasmuch as negative existence is a subjectincapable of definition, as I have before shown, it is rather considered by the Qabalists as depending backfrom the number of unity than as a separate consideration therefrom; wherefore they frequently apply thesame terms and epithets indiscriminately to either. Such epithets are \"The Concealed of the Concealed,\" \"TheAncient of the Ancient Ones,\" the \"Most Holy Ancient One,\" &c.39, I must now explain the real meaning of the terms Sephira and Sephiroth. The first is singular, the secondis plural. The best rendering of the word is \"numerical emanation.\" There are ten Sephiroth, which are themost abstract forms of the ten numbers of the decimal scale\u0014i.e., the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.Therefore, as in the higher mathematics we reason of numbers in their abstract sense, so in the Qabalah wereason of the Deity by the abstract forms of the numbers; in other words, by the SPIRVTh, Sephiroth. It wasfrom this ancient Oriental theory that Pythagoras derived his numerical symbolic ideas.40. Among these Sephiroth, jointly and severally, we find the development of the persons and attributes ofGod. Of these some are male and some female. Now, for some reason or other best known to themselves, thetranslators of the Bible have carefully crowded out of existence and smothered up every reference to the factthat the Deity is both masculine and feminine. They have translated a feminine plural by a masculinesingular in the case of the word Elohim. They have, however, left an inadvertent admission of theirknowledge that it was plural in Gen. iv. 26; \"And Elohim said: Let Us make man.\" Again (V. 27), how couldAdam be made in the image of the Elohim, male and female, unless the Elohim were male and female also?The word Elohim is a plural formed from the feminine singular ALH, Eloh, by adding IM to the word. Butinasmuch as IM is usually the termination of the masculine plural, and is here added to a feminine noun, itgives to the word Elohim the sense of a female potency united to a masculine idea, and thereby capable ofproducing an offspring. Now, we hear much of the Father and the Son, but we hear nothing of the Mother inthe ordinary religions of the day. But in the Qabalah we find that the Ancient of Days conforms Himselfsimultaneously into the Father and the Mother, and thus begets the Son. Now, this Mother is Elohim. Again,we are usually told that the Holy Spirit is masculine. But the word RVCh, Ruach, Spirit, is feminine, asappears from the following passage of the Sepher Yetzirah: \"AChTh RVCh ALHIM ChIIM, KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDINTRODUCTION.16"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Achath (feminine, not Achad, masculine) Ruach Elohim Chiim : \"One is She the Spirit of the Elohim of Life.\"41. Now, we find that before the Deity conformed Himself thus\u0014 i.e., as male and female\u0014that the worlds ofthe universe could not subsist, or, in the words of Genesis, \"The earth was formless and void.\" These priorworlds are considered to be symbolized by the \"kings who reigned in Edom before there reigned a king inIsrael,\" and they are therefore spoken of in the Qabalah as the \"Edomite kings.\" This will be found fullyexplained in various parts of this work.42. We now come to the consideration of the first Sephira, or the Number One, the Monad of Pythagoras. Inthis number are the other nine hidden. It is indivisible, it is also incapable of multiplication; divide 1 by itselfand it still remains 1, multiply 1 by itself and it is still 1 and unchanged. Thus it is a fitting representative ofthe great unchangeable Father of all. Now this number of unity has a twofold nature, and thus forms, as itwere, the link between the negative and the positive. In its unchangeable one−ness it is scarcely a number;but in its property of capability of addition it may be called the first number of a numerical series. Now, thezero, 0, is incapable even of addition, just as also is negative existence. How, then, if 1 can neither bemultiplied nor divided, is another 1 to be obtained to add to it; in other words, how is the number 2 to befound? By reflection of itself. For though 0 be incapable of definition, 1 is definable. And the effect of adefinition is to form an Eidolon, duplicate, or image, of the thing defined. Thus, then, we obtain a duadcomposed of 1 and its reflection. Now also we have the commencement of a vibration established, for thenumber 1 vibrates alternately from changelessness to definition, and back to changelessness again. Thus,then, is it the father of all numbers, and a fitting type of the Father of all things.The name of the first Sephira is KThR, Kether, the Crown.The Divine Name attributed to it is the Name of the Father given in Exod. iii. 4: AHIH, Eheieh, I am. Itsignifies Existence.Among the Epithets applied to it, as containing in itself the idea of negative existence depending back from it,are:TMIRA DTMIRIN, Temira De−Temirin, the Concealed of the Concealed.OThIQA DOThIQIN, Authiqa De−Authiqin, the Ancient of the Ancient Ones.OThIQA QDIShA, Authiqa Qadisha, the Most Holy Ancient One.OThIQA, Authiqa, the Ancient One.OThIQ IVMIN, Authiq Iomin, the Ancient of Days.It is also called:NQDH RAShVNH, Nequdah Rashunah, the Primordial Point.NQDH PShVTh, Nequdah Peshutah, the Smooth Point.RIShA HVVRH, Risha Havurah, the White Head.RVM MOLH, Rom Meolah, the Inscrutable Height. Besides all these there is another very important nameapplied to this Sephira as representing the great Father of all things. It is ARIK ANPIN, Arikh Anpin, the VastCountenance, or Macroprosopus. Of Him it is said that He is partly concealed (in the sense of His connection KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDINTRODUCTION.17"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"with the negative existence) and partly manifest (as a positive Sephira). Hence the symbolism of the VastCountenance is that of a profile wherein one side only of the countenance is seen; or, as it is said in theQabalah, \"in Him all is right side.\" I shall refer to this title again.The whole ten Sephiroth represent the Heavenly Man, or Primordial Being, ADM OILAH, Adam Auilah.Under this Sephira are classed the angelic order of ChIVTh HQDSh, Chioth Ha−Qadesh, holyliving−creatures, the kerubim or sphinxes of Ezekiel's vision and of the Apocalypse of John. These arerepresented in the Zodiac by the four signs, Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius\u0014the Bull, Lion, Eagle, andMan: Scorpio, as a good emblem, being symbolized by the eagle, as an evil emblem by the scorpion, and asof a mixed nature by the snake.This first Sephira contained the other nine, and produced them in succession, thus:\u001443. The number 2, or the Duad. The name of the second Sephira is ChKMH, Chokmah, Wisdom, a masculineactive potency reflected from Kether, as I have before explained. This Sephira is the active and evidentFather, to whom the Mother is united, who is the number 3. This second Sephira is represented by the DivineNames, IH, Yah, and IHVH; and among the angelic hosts by AVPNIM, Auphanim, the Wheels (Ezek. i.). It isalso called AB, Ab, the Father.44. The third Sephira, or Triad, is a feminine passive potency, called BINH, Binah, the Understanding, who isco−equal with Chokmah. For Chokmah, the number 2, is like two straight lines which can never enclose aspace, and therefore it is powerless till the number 3 forms the triangle. Thus this Sephira completes andmakes evident the supernal Trinity. It is also called AMA, Ama, Mother, and AIMA, Aima, the greatproductive Mother, who is eternally conjoined with AB, the Father, for the maintenance of the universe inorder. Therefore is she the most evident form in whom we can know the Father, and therefore is she worthyof all honour. She is the supernal Mother, co−equal with Chokmah, and the great feminine form of God, theElohim, in whose image man and woman are created, according to the teaching of the Qabalah, equal beforeGod. Woman is equal with man, and certainly not inferior to him, as it has been the persistent endeavour ofso−called Christians to make her. Aima is the woman described in the Apocalypse (ch. xii.). This thirdSephira is also sometimes called the great sea. To her are attributed the Divine names, ALHIM, Elohim, andIHVH ALHIM; and the angelic order, ARALIM, Aralim, the Thrones. She is the supernal Mother, asdistinguished from Malkuth, the inferior Mother, Bride, and Queen.45. The number 4. This union of the second and third Sephiroth produced ChSD, Chesed, Mercy or Love alsocalled GDVLH, Gedulah, Greatness or Magnificence; a masculine potency represented by the Divine NameAL, El, the Mighty One, and the angelic name, ChShMLIM, Chashmalim, Scintillating Flames (Ezek. iv, 4).46. The number 5. From this emanated the feminine passive potency GBVRH, Geburah, strength orfortitude; or DIN, Deen, justice; represented by the Divine Names, ALHIM GBVR, and ALH, Eloh , and theangelic name ShRPIM, Seraphim (Isa. vi. 6). This Sephira is also called PChD, Pachad, Fear.47. The number 6. And from these two issued the uniting Sephira, ThPARTh, Tiphereth, Beauty or Mildness,represented by the Divine Name ALVH VDOTh, EloahVa−Daath, and the angelic names, Shinanim, ShNANIM (Ps. lxviii. 18), or MLKIM, Melakim, kings. Thus by the unionof justice and mercy we obtain beauty or clemency, and the second trinity of the Sephiroth is complete. ThisSephira, or \"Path,\" or \"Numeration\"\u0014for by these latter appellations the emanations are sometimescalled\u0014together with the fourth, fifth, seventh, eighth, and ninth Sephiroth, is spoken of as ZOIR ANPIN, KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDINTRODUCTION.18"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Zauir Anpin, the Lesser Countenance, or Microprosopus, by way of antithesis to Macroprosopus, or the VastCountenance, which is one of the names of Kether, the first Sephira. The sixth Sephiroth of which ZauirAnpin is composed, are then called His six members. He is also called MLK, Melekh, the King.48. The number 7. The seventh Sephira is NTzCh, Netzach, or Firmness and Victory, corresponding to theDivine Name Jehovah Tzabaoth, IHVH TzBAVTh, the Lord of Armies, and the angelic names ALHIM,Elohim, gods, and ThRShIShIM, Tharshisim, the brilliant ones (Dan. x. 6).49. The number 8. Thence proceeded the feminine passive potency HVD, Hod, Splendour, answering to theDivine Name ALHIM TzBAVTh, Elohim Tzabaoth, the Gods of Armies, and among the angels to BNIALHIM, Beni Elohim, the sons of the Gods (Gen. vi. 4).50. The number 9. These two produced ISVD, Yesod, the Foundation or Basis, represented by AL ChI, ElChai, the Mighty Living One, and ShDI, Shaddaï; and among the angels by AShIM, Aishim, the Flames (Ps.civ. 4), yielding the third Trinity of the Sephiroth.51. The number 10. From this ninth Sephira came the tenth and last, thus completing the decad of thenumbers. It is called MLKVTh, Malkuth, the Kingdom, and also the Queen, Matrona, the inferior Mother, theBride of Microprosopus; and ShKINH, Shekinah, represented by the Divine Name Adonai, ADNI, andamong the angelic hosts by the kerubim, KRVBIM. Now, each of these Sephiroth will be in a certain degreeandrogynous, for it will be feminine or receptive with regard to the Sephira which immediately precedes it inthe sephirotic scale, and masculine or transmissive with regard to the Sephira which immediately follows it.But there is no Sephira anterior to Kether, nor is there a Sephira which succeeds Malkuth. By these remarks itwill be understood how Chokmah is a feminine noun, though marking a masculine Sephira. Theconnecting−link of the Sephiroth is the Ruach, spirit, from Mezla, the hidden influence.52. I will now add a few more remarks on the qabalistical meaning of the term MThQLA, Metheqela,balance. In each of the three trinities or triads of the Sephiroth is a duad of opposite sexes, and a unitingintelligence which is the result. In this, the masculine and feminine potencies are regarded as the two scalesof the balance, and the uniting Sephira as the beam which joins them. Thus, then, the term balance may besaid to symbolize the Triune, Trinity in Unity, and the Unity represented by the central point of the beam.But, again, in the Sephiroth there is a triple Trinity, the upper, lower, and middle. Now, these three arerepresented thus: the supernal, or highest, by the Crown, Kether; the middle by the King, and the inferior bythe Queen; which will be the greatest trinity. And the earthly correlatives of these will be the primum mobile,the sun and the moon. Here we at once find alchemical symbolism.53. Now in the world the Sephiroth are represented by:(1) RAShITh HGLGLIM, Rashith Ha−Galgalim, the commencement of whirling motions, the primum mobile(2) MSLVTh, Masloth, the sphere of the Zodiac.(3) ShBThAI, Shabbathai, rest, Saturn.(4) TzDQ, Tzedeq, righteousness, Jupiter.(5) MADIM, Madim, vehement strength, Mars.(6) ShMSh, Shemesh, the solar light, the Sun.(7) NVGH, Nogah, glittering splendour, Venus. (8) KVKB, Kokab, the stellar light, Mercury.

The Sephiroth are further divided into three pillars\u0014the right−hand Pillar of Mercy, consisting of thesecond, fourth, and seventh emanations; the left−hand Pillar of judgment, consisting of the third, fifth, andeighth; and the middle Pillar of Mildness, consisting of the first, sixth, ninth, and tenth emanations.55. In their totality and unity the ten Sephiroth represent the archetypal man, ADM QDMVN, Adam Qadmon,the Protogonos. In looking at the Sephiroth constituting the first triad, it is evident that they represent theintellect; and hence this triad is called the intellectual world, OVLM MVShKL, Olahm Mevshekal. Thesecond triad corresponds to the moral world, OVLM MVRGSh, Olahm Morgash. The third represents powerand stability, and is therefore called the material world, OVLM HMVTBO, Olahm Ha−Mevetbau. Thesethree aspects are called the faces, ANPIN, Anpin. Thus is the tree of life, OTz ChIIM, Otz Chaiim, formed;the first triad being placed above, the second and third below, in such a manner that the three masculineSephiroth are on the right, three feminine on the left, whilst the four uniting Sephiroth occupy the centre. Thisis the qabalistical \"tree of life,\" on which all things depend. There is considerable analogy between this andthe tree Yggdrasil of the Scandinavians.56. I have already remarked that there is one trinity which comprises all the Sephiroth, and that it consists ofthe crown, the king, and the queen. (In some senses this is the Christian Trinity of Father, Son, and HolySpirit, which in their highest divine nature are symbolized by the first three Sephiroth, Kether, Chokmah, andBinah.) It is the Trinity which created the world, or, in qabalistic language, the universe was born from the union of the crowned king and queen. But according to the Qabalah, before the complete form of theheavenly man (the ten Sephiroth) was produced, there were certain primordial worlds created, but these couldnot subsist, as the equilibrium of balance was not yet perfect, and they were convulsed by the unbalancedforce and destroyed. These primordial worlds are called the \"kings of ancient time,\" and the \"kings of Edomwho reigned before the monarchs of Israel.\" In this sense, Edom is the world of unbalanced force, and Israelis the balanced Sephiroth (Gen. xxxvi. 31). This important fact, that worlds were created and destroyed priorto the present creation, is again and again reiterated in the Zohar.57. Now the Sephiroth are also called the World of Emanations, or the Atziluthic World, or archetypal world,OVLM ATzILVTh, Olahm Atziloth; and this world gave birth to three other worlds, each containing arepetition of the Sephiroth, but in a descending scale of brightness.58. The second world is the Briatic world, OVLM HBRIAH, Olahm Ha−Briah, the world of creation, alsocalled KVRSIA, Khorsia , the throne. It is an immediate emanation from the world of Atziloth, whose tenSephiroth are reflected herein, and are consequently more limited, though they are still of the purest nature,and without any admixture of matter.59. The third is the Jetziratic world, OVLM HITzIRH, Olahm Ha−Yetzirah, or world of formation and ofangels, which proceeds from Briah, and though less refined in substance, is still without matter. It is in thisangelic world where those intelligent and incorporeal beings reside who are wrapped in a luminous garment,and who assume a form when they appear unto man.60. The fourth is the Asiatic world, OVLM HOShIH, Olahm Ha−Asia , the world of action, called also theworld of shells, OVLM HQLIPVTh, Olahm Ha−Qliphoth, which is this world of matter, made up of thegrosser elements of the other three. In it is also the abode of the evil spirits which are called \"the shells\" by KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDINTRODUCTION.20"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"the Qabalah, QLIPVTh, Qliphoth, material shells. The devils are also divided into ten classes, and havesuitable habitations. (See Table.)61. The Demons are the grossest and most deficient of all forms. Their ten degrees answer to the decad of theSephiroth, but in inverse ratio, as darkness and impurity increase with the descent of each degree. The twofirst are nothing but absence of visible form and organization. The third is the abode of darkness. Next followseven Hells occupied by those demons which represent incarnate human vices, and torture those who havegiven themselves up to such vices in earth−life. Their prince is Samael, SMAL, the angel of poison and ofdeath. His wife is the harlot, or woman of whoredom, AShTh ZNVNIM, Isheth Zenunim; and united they arecalled the beast, CHIVA, Chioa. Thus the infernal trinity is completed, which is, so to speak, the averse andcaricature of the supernal Creative One. Samael is considered to be identical with Satan.62. The name of the Deity, which we call Jehovah, is in Hebrew a name of four letters, IHVH; and the truepronunciation of it is known to very few. I myself know some score of different mystical pronunciations of it.The true pronunciation is a most secret arcanum, and is a secret of secrets. \"He who can rightly pronounce it,causeth heaven and earth to tremble, for it is the name which rusheth through the universe.\" Therefore when adevout Jew comes upon it in reading the Scripture, he either does not attempt to pronounce it, but insteadmakes a short pause, or else he substitutes for it the name Adonai, ADNI, Lord. The radical meaning of theword is \"to be,\" and it is thus, like AHIH, Eheieh, a glyph of existence. It is capable of twelve transpositions, which all convey the meaning of \"to be\"; it is the only word that will bear so many transpositions withoutits meaning being altered. They are called the \"twelve banners of the mighty name,\" and are said by some torule the twelve signs of the Zodiac. These are the twelve banners:\u0014IHVH, IHHV, IVHH, HVHI, HVIH,HHIV, VHHI, VIHH, VHIH, HIHV, HIVH, HHVI. There are three other tetragrammatic names, which areAHIH, Eheieh, existence; ADNI, Adonai, Lord; and Agla , AGLA. This last is not, properly speaking, aword, but is a notariqon of the sentence, AThH GBVR LOVLM ADNI, Ateh Gebor Le−Olahm Adonai :\"Thou are mighty for ever, O Lord!\" A brief explanation of Agla is this: A, the one first; A, the one last; G,the Trinity in Unity; L, the completion of the great work.63. The first thing we notice is that both AHIH and IHVH convey the idea of existence; this is their firstanalogy. The second is, that in each the letter H comes second and fourth; and the third is that by GematriaAHIH equals IHV without the H (which, as we shall see presently, is the symbol of Malkuth, the tenthSephira). But now, if they be written one above the others, thus, within the arms of a cross,AHIHIHVHthey read downwards as well as across, AHIH, IHVH.64. Now, if we examine the matter qabalistically we shall find the reason of these analogies. For Eheieh, KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDINTRODUCTION.21"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"AHIH, is the Vast Countenance, the Ancient One, Macroprosopus, Kether, the first Sephira, the Crown of theQabalistical Sephirotic greatest Trinity (which consists of the Crown, King, and Queen; or Macroprosopus,Microprosopus and the Bride), and the Father in the Christian acceptation of the Trinity.65. But IHVH, the Tetragrammaton, as we shall presently see, contains all the Sephiroth with the exceptionof Kether, and specially signifies the Lesser Countenance, Microprosopus, the King of the qabalisticalSephirotic greatest Trinity, and the Son in His human incarnation, in the Christian acceptation of the Trinity.Therefore, as the Son reveals the Father, so does IHVH, Jehovah , reveal AHIH, Eheieh.66. And ADNI is the Queen \"by whom alone Tetragrammaton can be grasped,\" whose exaltation into Binahis found in the Christian assumption of the Virgin.67. The Tetragrammaton IHVH is referred to the Sephiroth, thus: the uppermost point of the letter Yod, I, issaid to refer to Kether , the letter I itself to Chokmah, the father of Microprosopus; the letter H, or \"thesupernal He,\" to Binah, the supernal Mother; the letter V to the next six Sephiroth, which are called the sixmembers of Microprosopus (and six is the numerical value of V, the Hebrew Vau); lastly, the letter H, the\"inferior He,\" to Malkuth, the tenth Sephira, the bride of Microprosopus.68. Now, there are four secret names referred to the four worlds of Atziloth, Briah, Yetzirah, and Asiah; andagain, the Tetragrammaton is said to go forth written in a certain manner in each of these four worlds. Thesecret name of Atziloth is Aub, OB; that of Briah is Seg, SG; that of Yetzirah is Mah, MH; and that of Asiahis Ben, BN. The subjoined Table will show the mode of writing the name in each of the four worlds.69. These names operate together with the Sephiroth through the \"231 gates,\" as the various combinations ofthe alphabet are called; but it would take too much space to go fully into the subject here.70. Closely associated with the subject of the letters of the Tetragrammaton is that of the four kerubim, towhich I have already referred in describing the first Sephira.Now it must not be forgotten that these forms in Ezekiel's vision support the throne of the Deity, whereon theHeavenly Man is seated\u0014the Adam Qadmon, the sephirotic image; and that between the throne and the livingcreatures is the firmament. Here then we have the four worlds\u0014Atziloth, the deific form; Briah, the throne;Yetzirah, the firmament; Asiah, the kerubim. Therefore the kerubim represent the powers of the letters of theTetragrammaton on the material plain; and the four represent the operation of the four letters in each of thefour worlds. Thus, then, the kerubim are the living forms of the letters, symbolized in the Zodiac by Taurus,Leo, Aquarius, and Scorpio, as I have before remarked.71. And \"the mystery of the earthly and mortal man is after the mystery of the supernal and immortal One;\"and thus was he created the image of God upon earth. In the form of the body is the Tetragrammaton found.The head is I, the arms and shoulders are like H, the body is V, and the legs are represented by the H final.Therefore, as the outward form of man corresponds to the Tetragrammaton, so does the animating soulcorrespond to the ten supernal Sephiroth; and as these find their ultimate expression in the trinity of thecrown, the king, and the queen, so is there a principal triple division of the soul. Thus, then, the first is theNeschamah, NShMH, which is the highest degree of being, corresponding to the crown (Kether), andrepresenting the highest triad of the Sephiroth, called the intellectual world. The second is Ruach, RVCH, theseat of good and evil, corresponding to Tiphereth, the moral world. And the third is Nephesch, NPSh, theanimal life and desires, corresponding to Yesod, and the material and sensuous world. All souls arepre−existent in the world of emanations, and are in their original state androgynous, but when they descend KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDINTRODUCTION.22"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"upon earth they become separated into male and female, and inhabit different bodies; if therefore in this mortal life the male half encounters the female half, a strong attachmentsprings up between them, and hence it is said that in marriage the separated halves are again conjoined; andthe hidden forms of the soul are akin to the kerubim.72. But this foregoing triple division of the soul is only applicable to the triple form of the intellectual, moral,and material. Let us not lose sight of the great qabalistical idea, that the trinity is always completed by andfinds its realization in the quaternary; that is IHV completed and realized in IHVH\u0014the trinity ofCrown;King;Queen;Father;Son;Spirit;Absolute;Formation;Realization;completed by the quaternary of\u0014Absolute OneFather and MotherSonBride.Macroprosopus, the VastCountenanceFather and MotherMicroprosopus, the LesserCountenanceMalkuth, the Queen andBride.AtzilothBriahYetzirahAsiah.ArchetypalCreativeFormativeMaterial.And to these four the soul answers in the following four forms:\u0014Chiah to Atziloth; Neschamah to Briah;Ruach to Yetzirah; and Nephesch to Asiah.

But Chiah is in the soul the archetypal form analogous to Macroprosopus.

For \"yod of the Ancient One is hidden and concealed.\"74. I select the following résumé of the qabalistical teachings regarding the nature of the soul from EliphazLevi's \"Clef des Mystères,\" as also the accompanying plate. This gives the chief heads of the ideas of RabbiMoses Korduero and of Rabbi Yitzchaq Loria.\"The soul is a veiled light. This light is triple:\"Neschamah = the pure spirit;\"Ruach = the soul or spirit;\"Nephesch = the plastic mediator.\"The veil of the soul is the shell of the image.\"The image is double because it reflects alike the good and the evil angel of the soul.\"Nephesch is immortal by renewal of itself through the destruction of forms;\"Ruach is progressive through the evolution of ideas;\"Neschamah is progressive without forgetfulness and without destruction.There are three habitations of souls:\u0014\"The Abyss of Life;\"The superior Eden;\"The inferior Eden.\"\"The image Tzelem is a sphinx which propounds the enigma of life.\"The fatal image (i.e., that which succumbs to the outer ) endows Nephesch with his attributes, but Ruach cansubstitute the image conquered by the inspirations of Neschamah.\"The body is the veil of Nephesch, Nephesch is the veil of Ruach, Ruach is the veil of the shroud ofNeschamah.\"Light personifies itself by veiling itself, and the personification is only stable when the veil is perfect.\"This perfection upon earth is relative to the universal soul of the earth (i.e., as the macrocosm or greaterworld, so the microcosm or lesser world, which is man).There are three atmospheres for the souls.

In the accompanying plate of the formation of the soul there will be seen in the upper part three circles,representing the three parts known as Neschamah, Ruach, and Nephesch. From Ruach and Nephesch,influenced by the good aspirations of Neschamah, proceeds Michael, the good angel of the soul; that is to say,the synthetical hieroglyph of the good ideas, or, in the esoteric Buddhist phraseology, the \"Good Karma\" of aman. From Nephesch dominating Ruach, and uninfluenced by the good aspirations of Neschamah, proceedsSamäel, the evil angel of the soul; that is to say, the synthetical hieroglyph of the evil ideas, the \"evil Karma\"of a man. And the Tzelem, or image, is double, for it reflects alike Michael and Samäel.76. The following is Dr. Jellinek's analysis of the sephirotic ideas, according to the ethics of Spinoza:\u00141. DEFINITION.\u0014By the Being who is the cause and governor of all things I understand theAin Soph\u0014i.e., a Being infinite, boundless, absolutely identical with itself, united in itself,without attributes, will, intention, desire, thought, word, or deed.2. DEFINITION.\u0014By Sephiroth I understand the potencies which emanated from theAbsolute, Ain Soph, all entities limited by quantity, which, like the will, without changing itsnature, wills diverse objects that are the possibilities of multifarious things.I.

I will now revert to the subject of Arikh Anpin and Zauir Anpin, the Macroprosopus and theMicroprosopus, or the Vast and the Lesser Countenances. Macroprosopus is, it will be remembered, the firstSephira, or Crown Kether; Microprosopus is composed of six of the Sephiroth. (See subjoined plate.) InMacroprosopus all is light and brilliancy; but Microprosopus only shineth by the reflected splendour ofMacroprosopus. The six days of creation correspond to the six forms of Microprosopus. Therefore the symbolof the interlaced triangles, forming the six−pointed star, is called the Sign of the Macrocosm, or of thecreation of the greater world, and is consequently analogous to. the two countenances of the Zohar. This,however, is not the only occult reason that I have placed this symbol in the plate, for it typifies other ideasupon which I shall not here enter. The \"Book of Concealed Mystery\" fully discusses the symbolism ofMacroprosopus and Microprosopus; therefore it is well, before reading it, to be cognizant of their similaritiesand differences. The one is AHIH, Eheieh; the other is the V, Vau, of the Tetragrammaton. The first twoletters, I and H, Yod and He, are the father and mother of Microprosopus, and the H final is his bride. But inthese forms is expressed the equilibrium of severity and mercy; severity being symbolized by the two Hs,Hes, the mother and the bride, but especially by the latter. But while the excess of Mercy is not an eviltendency, but rather conveys a certain idea of weakness and want of force, too great an excess of severitycalls forth the executioner of judgment, the evil and oppressive force, which is symbolized by Leviathan.Wherefore it is said, \"Behind the shoulders of the bride the serpent rears his head:\" of the bride, but not of the KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDINTRODUCTION.27"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"mother, for she is the supernal H, and bruises his head. \"But his head is broken by the waters of the greatsea.\" The sea is Binah, the supernal H, the mother. The serpent is the centripetal force, ever seeking topenetrate into Paradise (the Sephiroth), and to tempt the supernal Eve (the bride), so that in her turn she maytempt the supernal Adam (Microprosopus).It is utterly beyond the scope of this Introduction to examine this symbolism thoroughly, especially as itforms the subject of this work; so I will simply refer my reader to the actual text for further elucidation,hoping that by the perusal of this introductory notice he will be better fitted to understand and follow thecourse of qabalistic teaching there given.SPRA DTzNIOVThA (SIPHRA DTZENIOUTHA); OR, THEBOOK OF CONCEALED MYSTERY.CHAPTER I.1. Tradition.\u0014\"The Book of Concealed Mystery\" is the book of the equilibrium of balance.[The word \"Dtzenioutha\" is difficult to translate, but I think its meaning is best expressed by the words\"Concealed Mystery.\" I have explained in the Introduction the qabalistical meaning of the words\"equilibrium\" and \"balance,\" § 29.]2. Tradition.\u0014For before there was equilibrium, countenance beheld not countenance.[By the two countenances are mean, Macroprosopus and Microprosopus. See Introduction, §§ 42, 47, 64, 65,67. 73, and 77.]3. And the kings of ancient time were dead, and their crowns were found no more; and the earth was desolate.[The \"kings of ancient time\" mean the same thing as the \"Edomite Kings;\" that is, they symbolize worlds of\"unbalanced force,\" which, according to the Zohar. preceded the formation of this universe. I have explainedthis also in the Introduction, §§ 41 and 56. This and the immediately following sections are supposed to tracethe gradual development of the Deity from negative into positive existence; the text is here describing thetime when the Deity was just commencing His manifestation from His primal negative form. Therefore,according to the qabalistical ideas, the universe is the garment as it were of the Deity; He not only containsall, but is Himself all. and exists in all.]4. Until that head (which is incomprehensible) desired by all desires (proceeding from AIN SVP, Ain Soph,the infinite and limitless one), appeared and communicated the vestments of honour.[This Head, which is here described as proceeding from the infinite and limitless One, the Ain Soph, is thefirst Sephira, the Crown Kether, otherwise called Arikh Anpin, or Macroprosopus, the Vast Countenance.From this first Sephira the other nine emanations are produced. I have explained all this in the Introduction,§§ 38−57, in treating of the Sephiroth.]5. This equilibrium hangeth in that region which is negatively existent in the Ancient One.[By the expression \"This equilibrium hangeth in that region which is negatively existent in the Ancient One,\"is meant that the other nine Sephiroth (which are equilibrated by their formation in trinities) are as yet notdeveloped in the first Sephira. but exist within it as the tree exists in the seed from which it springs. By \"theAncient One\", is intended the first Sephira, the Crown Kether, one of whose appellations is Autheqa, the KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDSPRA DTzNIOVThA (SIPHRA DTZENIOUTHA); OR, THE BOOK OF CONCEALED MYSTERY.28"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Ancient One. From this Sephira, as I have before remarked. the idea of negative existence depends backtowards the AIN.]6. Thus were those powers equiponderated which were not yet in perceptible existence.[These powers are the other nine Sephiroth, which are, as it were powers of the first Sephira; as soon as theyare equated they become positively existent through correlation of force. The next two sections explain themanner of their equilibration while yet negative entities, or rather ideas ]7. In His form (in the form of the Ancient One) existeth the equilibrium: it is incomprehensible, it is unseen.[But the first idea of equilibrium is the Ancient One (the first Sephira, or Crown Kether), because it is thefirst potential limitation of the boundless light which proceeds from the Limitless One. That is, the centralpoint of Kether is the equilibrium, because the balance does not yet exist, the two opposite poles which formthe balance not being yet developed. We must not confuse these two terms, equilibrium and balance. Thebalance consists of two scales (opposing forces), the equilibrium is the central point of the beam.]8. Therein have they ascended, and therein do they ascend\u0014they who are not, who are, and who shall be.[Therein (in the equilibrium of Kether) have they ascended (developed when they became positivelyexistent), and therein (in the equilibrium) do they ascend (have their first existence), they (the Sephiroth) whoare not (exist negatively). who are (then become positive), and who shall. be (exist permanently. because theywe counterbalanced powers). This triple expression \"are not, are, and shall be.\" also refers to the triple trinityof the Sephiroth.] (See Introduction. §§ 52, 64, 65 And 66.)9. The head which is incomprehensible is secret in secret.[This head Is Macroprosopus, the Vast Countenance, and is the same as the Ancient One, or Crown Kether. Itis were, for therein axe hidden the other potentialities.]10. But it hath been formed and prepared in the likeness of a cranium, and is filled with the crystalline dew.[The crystalline dew is the creative lux or Aur, AVR, proceeding from the Limitless One. The MantuanCodex calls the skull or cranium the first, and the crystalline dew the second conformation ofMacroprosopus.]11. His skin is of other, clear and congealed.12. (His hair is as) most fine wool, floating through the balanced equilibrium.[The ether is the clear and insupportable brilliance of his glory. The hair is white\u0014i.e.; spotless as wool\u0014todenote the utter absence of matter and of shell. The Mantuan Codex calls the ether the third conformation,and the hair the fourth, which latter it refers to the Sephira Netzach, victory.]13. (His forehead is) the benevolence of those benevolences which are manifested through the prayers of theinferior powers. [The supernal benignity which transmits their qualities, powers and offices, to the lowerSephiroth (the inferior powers). It must be remembered that each Sephira receives from that whichimmediately precedes it, and transmits to that which next follows it. Thus, each Sephira is said to be feminineor passive as regards its predecessor, and masculine or active in respect to its successor. (See Introduction, §§43 and 51.) The Mantuan Codex calls this the fifth conformation, and refers it to the idea of the ninth Sephira,Yesod, foundation.] KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDSPRA DTzNIOVThA (SIPHRA DTZENIOUTHA); OR, THE BOOK OF CONCEALED MYSTERY.29"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"14.

Because the appearance (development) of the lower(nine Sephiroth) is according to (dependent on) the aspect (ruling thought) of the higher light (Kether, thefirst Sephira). The Mantuan Codex terms this the sixth conformation of Macroprosopus, and refers it, as inthe case of the fourth conformation, to the primal idea of the Sephira Netzach, victory.]15. Therein are His two nostrils like mighty galleries, whence His spirit rushes forth over all.

For instead of BRAShITh,Berashith, \"in the beginning,\" it may be read, BRAShITh, BeraShith, \"He created the six.\" Upon these depend all things which are below (principally the Queen, who is thelowest path, or the bride of Microprosopus, and all the three inferior worlds.)(The view which the Siphra Dtzenioutha here follows out is that the beginning of Genesis describes not onlythe creation of the world, but the development of God, for it considers the universe as the outward andmaterial expression of the power of the thought Divine. Microprosopus is as it were the reflection ofMacroprosopus, for as Macroprosopus has six principal titles. so is Microprosopus composed of six of theSephiroth. (See Introduction, §§ 42. 47 and 77.) ShITh, Shith, is the Chaldee form of the Hebrew ShSh,Shash, six. The queen is Malkuth, the tenth Sephira. The three inferior worlds are Briah, Yetzirah, and Asiah.See Introduction, §§ 57−60.]11. And the dignity of dignity hangeth from the seven conformations of the cranium. (This is the beard of thevenerable and Ancient One, which is divided into thirteen portions).(The Ancient One is the first Sephira, Macroprosopus. as I have before remarked. The beard, in continuationof the symbolic representation of the head. is divided Into thirteen portions, which answer by Gematria (seeIntroduction, § 11) to the idea of unity.

(That is, the kingdom of the restored world, whichelsewhere is called the Bride of Microprosopus, came not into the computation when the six members weresaid to be created.

And it hath proceeded out of that which hath undergone thecurse, as it is written in Genesis v., 29, \"From the earth which the Lord hath cursed.\" (The meaning is: Thatthe kingdom of the restored world was formed from the kingdom of the destroyed world, wherein seven kingshad died and their possessions had been broken up. Or, the explanation of the world, of which mention ismade elsewhere, proceedeth from the kingdom of the destroyed world.)[These seven kings are the Edomite kings before mentioned in Section 3.]20. It was formless and void, and darkness upon the face of the deep, and the Spirit of the Elohim vibratingupon the face of the waters. Thirteen (these words, from \"it was formless\" down to \"of the waters,\" arethirteen in the Hebrew text of Genesis) depend from the thirteen (forms) of the dignity of dignity (that is, thebeard of the Macroprosopus, or first formed head).[I have before remarked that the number thirteen expresses unity. The author of \"The Book of ConcealedMystery\" here argues that the very number and order of the words in the Hebrew text refer to certain forms ofthe Deity. The terms \"face of the deep\" and \"face of the waters\" bear a striking analogy to Macroprosopusand Microprosopus, the Vast and the Lesser Countenances. In this sense the \"face of (from) the deep (abyss)\"is the countenance formed from Ain Soph, the Limitless One; namely. the first Sephira the Crown Kether.]21. Six thousand years depend from the six first. This is what the wise have said, that the world shall last sixthousand years, and it is understood from the six numbers of Microprosopus. But also the six followingwords give occasion to this idea: VIAMR ALHIM IHI AVR VIHI AVR, Veyomar Elohim Yehi Aur VayehiAur: \"And the Elohim said, Let there be light, and there was light.\"[By an exegetical rule of numbers, not so often employed as the others. simple numbers or units signifydivine things; numbers of ten, celestial things; numbers of a hundred, terrestrial things; and thousands signifythe future, what shall be in an after−age. Hence are the \"six thousand years\" deduced from the six first words,which also are said to refer to the six Sephiroth of whom Microprosopus is formed; the idea of six beingextended into as many thousands, to symbolise that number on the plane of a future age.]2:. The seventh (the millennium, and the seventh space. namely, the Kingdom), above that One which aloneis powerful\u0014(i.e., when the six degrees of the members denote mercies and judgments, the seventh degreetendeth alone to judgment and rigour). And the whole is desolate (that is, the Kingdom, MLKVTh, Malkuth,in the higher powers, is the antitype of the sanctuary, and like as this is destroyed, so also the Schechinah, orKingdom, is itself exiled) for twelve hours (for the Hebrews include all this time of their exile in the space ofone day). Like as it is written: \"It was formless and void, &c.\" (for from the word \"it was formless,\" down to\"upon the faces of,\" are twelve words in the Hebrew text of Genesis.)[By the same rule, the millennium is deduced from the seventh word. The seventh space here means Malkuth,the kingdom, or the queen, which together with the six of Microprosopus, makes up the seven lowerSephiroth. (See Introduction, § 77, further, for the idea of the balance of mercy and judgment.)]23. The thirteenth (that is, \"of the waters,\" HMIM, Hamim, which is the thirteenth word) raiseth up these (thatis, as well the sanctuary which is above as that which is below) through mercy (since the water symbolizeththat measure of mercy through which judgment and punishments are mitigated), and they are renewed asbefore (for the six words follow afresh, as in the beginning the six members are enumerated). For all those sixcontinue and stand fast (they are the members of the Microprosopus, and are not as his bride, and from themis the restitution), since it is written BRA, Bera, \"created\" (which hath a sense of permanence), and then it iswritten HIThH, Hayitha, \"it was\" (which also is a phrase of permanence and not of interpolation), for it isvery truth (plainly, therefore, the kingdom perished not, although it might be formless and void, but itretaineth hitherto the essence).

And at the end of the Formless and the Void and the Darkness (that is, at the end of the exile this sayingshall have place: Isa. ii. 11). And the Tetragrammaton alone shall be exalted in that day (that is, in the time ofMessiah).[The Tetragrammaton (see Introduction, § 67) comprehends the whole ten Sephiroth, and consequentlyexpresses their three trinities of balanced force also; consequently, when the Tetragrammaton appears, theformless and the void and the darkness disappear, and form, fulness, and light replace them.]25. But there are excavations of excavations. (The excavation is the receptacle, like that which is hollowedout, or carved out, like a cave, or any other receptacle. Therefore all receptacles are inferior with respect tothe superiors, among which the \"shells\" hold the last place, which here are described, which are) under theform of a vast serpent extending this way and that. (Concerning this serpent the author of the \"Royal Valley\"speaks thus in his \"Treatise of the Shells.\" The fragments of the receptacles, which have fallen into the worldof Creation, of Formation, and of Action, therein exist from the Outer; and judgments are more consonant tothese, which are called profane, and have their habitation in the middle space between the Holy and theUnclean. And from the head is formed that great dragon which is in the sea, and is the sea−serpent, which is,however, not so harmful as the earthly one. And this dragon hath been castrated since his crest (or membrumgenitale), together with his mate, have been repressed, and thence have been formed four hundred desirableworlds. And this dragon hath in his head a nostril (after the manner of whales) in order that he may receive influence, and in himself he containeth allother dragons, concerning which it is said: \"Thou hast broken the heads of the dragons upon the waters\" (Ps.lxxiv. 13). And here the idea or universal form of all the shells is understood, which encompasseth the seveninferior emanations of the queen after the manner of a serpent, as well from the right as from the left andfrom every side.)[The excavation or receptacle of a Sephira is that quality whereby it receives the supernal influence from thatwhich immediately precedes it; hence each Sephira has a double quality of receiving and of transmitting,which passes through the four worlds in each which the Sephiroth exist, though in gradually decreasing light.(See Table subjoined.) The \"shells,\" Qlipoth, are the demons, in whom again is a form of the Sephiroth,distorted and averse. This great dragon which is here described is evidently identical with the leviathan ofJob. He is the executor of judgment, the centripetal force, the old serpent ever seeking to penetrate intoParadise; finally, in a more exoteric sense he is Satan and the devil, the accusing one. In the Sepher Yetzirah,a most important qabalistical book, he is called Theli, ThLI, the dragon. Now, by Gematria. ThLI = 400 + 30+ 10 = 440; and if we \"repress his crest\"\u0014i.e., take away the first letter, which is Th, Tau,¤00, there willremain LI = 40 = M, Mem, the water. The \"400 desirable worlds\" are the numerical value of Th, and signifythe power of the Tetragrammaton on the material plane (See note to section 21, foregoing). There is muchalchemical symbolism contained in the \"Siphra Dtzenioutha.\" The \"Seven Inferior Emanations\" of the queen,are the seven lower Sephiroth \u0014viz., Chesed, Geburah, Tiphereth, Netzach, Hod.

His tail is in his head (that is, he holdeth his tail in his mouth, in order that he may form a circle, since heis said to encompass holiness). He transferreth his head to behind the shoulders (that is, he raiseth his head atthe back of the bride of Microprosopus, where is the place of most severe judgments), and he is despised(since in him is the extremity of judgments and severities, whence wrath is the attribute of his forms). Hewatcheth (that is, he accurately searcheth out and seeketh in what place he may gain an entry into holiness.

But that dragon hath about this his. most powerful location, whence, if adefect occurreth only in one numeration of that system through the fault of the inferiors, he is immediatelymanifest, and thus commenceth his accusations before the throne of glory.)[Here is the origin of the well−known symbol of a serpent holding his tail in his mouth, like a circle\u0014theserpent of Saturn. The reason that he raiseth his head behind the shoulders of the bride (Malkuth) is becausehe is. so to speak, not only the executor of judgment, but also the destroyer; destruction as opposed tocreation, death as opposed to life.

He isconcealed, because he is not called into action till justice requires him. The term \"decimal numeration\" ofcourse refers to the ten Sephiroth. The presence of the serpent when revealed, is an accusation, because itshows that the balance is destroyed; just as in a watch, if one of the wheels be injured, irregularity is at oncemanifested. Now, life, when it consists of birth into another form, necessarily implies death in the previousform. The throne of glory is the Briatic world.]27. There are swellings in his scales (that is, like as in a crocodile; because great in him is the heapingtogether of judgments). His crest keepeth its own place (that is, there is in him no further power of hasteningto things beyond in the Outer).

(The great sea is wisdom, the fountain of mercy andloving−kindness; which, if it sendeth down its influence, judgments are pacified, and the hurtful power of theshells is restricted); like as it is written, Ps. lxxiv. 13: \"Thou hast broken the heads of the dragons by thewaters.\"[\"The waters of the great sea,\" are the influence of the supernal mother, Binah, of whom Malkuth is thereflection. But Binah receives the influence of Chokmah. See Introduction.]29. They were two (male and female, whence the text of the Psalm speaketh of the dragons in the pluralnumber; but when the plural number is given in its least form, two only are understood). They are reducedinto one (for the female leviathan hath been slain, lest they should seek to multiply judgments). Whence theword ThNINM, Thenanim (in the before−mentioned passage of the Psalm), is written in a defective form(purposely to denote that restriction).[I may refer the reader to the Talmud for further information regarding Jewish ideas of the Leviathan.Thenanim is written in a defective form, because the letter I of the plural is omitted.

But since in the path of understanding those judgments themselves do notexist, but only their roots, while in itself this path is only pure mercy; hence the retrograde order is inverted,in order that it may be posited entire in this manner as at first): I, Yod, IH, Yah , IHV, Yeho, IHVI, Yahevi.(But it is not written in the usual manner, IHVH, Yod, He, Vau, He; because the word is derived from VIHI,Vayehi, whose metathesis is here discussed.

It must be remembered that thenatural course of writing Hebrew and Chaldee is from right to left, and that when it is written from left toright, it is said to be written \"backwards,\" \"in retrograde order,\" or \"averse.\" By the \"path of understanding\"is meant Binah. the third Sephira. Schechinah is of course the Divine Presence manifested in the path ofMalkuth. I have explained in the Introduction the meaning of the term \"path\" as employed in the Zohar.]33. But in one balance are they equiponderated. (The balance denoteth the male and the female; and themeaning is, that the fetters I, Yod, and H, He\u0014of which the former is masculine and referreth to the path of thefoundation; and the latter is feminine, pertaining to the queen\u0014are interchangeable; since whilst theequilibrium existeth there is an intercommunication between them, and they are joined together as one. Addto this that the queen is also called ADNI, Adonaï, wherein the letter I, Yod, bringeth up the rearguard of thearmy, as it were; because also it is accustomed to be called the Lesser Wisdom.) And the living creatures rushforth and return. (This is what is said in Ezek. i. 14 concerning the living creatures, which it is accustomed tobe said concerning those letters of the Tetragrammaton, which sometimes hold the last place and sometimesthe first; as when I, Yod, rusheth forth unto the last place, and when it returneth unto the beginning again; andso also the letter H, He. Likewise, then, also the living creatures are said to rush forth, when the KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDSPRA DTzNIOVThA (SIPHRA DTZENIOUTHA); OR, THE BOOK OF CONCEALED MYSTERY.34"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Tetragrammaton is written with the final H, He, because then the whole system of emanatives is exhausted.But they are said to return when the Tetragrammaton is written with the final I, Yod, so that the sense may becollected in such a manner as to return from the last path of the queen into the penultimate of the foundation,which is designated by this letter I, Yod.[I have defined \"balance\" in the Introduction, § 29, which see. The \"path of the foundation\" is of courseYesod, the ninth Sephira, while the queen is Malkuth, the tenth. Yesod is therefore the connecting linkbetween the Microprosopus and the bride. The letter I \"bringeth up the rearguard as it were\" in the nameADNI, Adonai, because it is the last letter. Ezek, i. 14: the Qabalists by the term ChIVTh HQDSh, ChaiothHa−Qadesch, the Holy Living−Creatures, understand the letters of the Tetragrammaton. With regard to the\"letters of the Tetragrammaton, which sometimes hold the last place and sometimes the first,\" the followingare two examples−namely, as in the form IHVI, Yod, He, Van, Yod, the letter I, Yod, is both at the beginningand end of the word; and in the form which is more usual IHVH, Yod, He, Van, He, the letter H, He, is in thesecond and last place.]34. Like as it is written: \"And the Elohim saw the substance of the light, that it was good. (Here a reason isadduced from the proposed text itself, showing how the last letter of this form of the Tetragrammaton,namely, I, Yod, may be said to symbolize the bride, since God himself might behold in that light the path ofconjunctive foundation, which the word \"goodness\" pointeth out; but when the foundation is in the act ofconjunction\u0014that is, under the idea of communicating goodness\u0014there then is the bride. But also that theword \"goodness\" denoteth the foundation is proved from Isa. iii. 10, where it is said, \"Say ye unto therighteous man\" (that is, to the path of foundation, because the first man is said to be the foundation of theworld, Prov. x. 25),,that it shall be well with him.\" Therefore, then do they ascend within the equilibrium.(That is, these two letters, I, Yod, and H, He, mean one and the same thing. Or, again: But behold, how inbalanced power ascend the letters of Tetragrammaton. That is, how those letters agree when in conjunction,which before were standing separated in the word VIHI, Vayehi.)(The \"path of foundation\" is of course the ninth Sephira, Yesod, which is the sixth member of Microprosopus(see section 16, foregoing). and typifies reproductive power. Malkuth is the queen. We must remember that inthe Tetragrammaton, IHVH, I, Yod, is the father (who is not Macroprosopus, though he is implied therein. asthe top point of the Hebrew letter Yod is said to symbolize him); H, He, the supernal mother; V, Vau, the son(Microprosopus); and H, He, final, the bride (the queen). And this is their proper order. Other variations ofthe Tetragrammaton, therefore, alter the position of the letters with regard to each other their normal andcorrect position being IHVH.]35 (Whilst the spouse, Microprosopus) was at first alone (he was standing by, whilst the letter V, Vau,occupied the first place, then was he separated from his bride). But all things returned into the unity. (That is,not only were father and mother conjoined into one, because the two letters, I, Yod, and H, He, werecombined; but also the Microprosopus returned to his bride, whilst V, Vau, was placed next to I, Yod, in theTetragrammaton, IHVI, Yahevi. For) V, Vau, descendeth (when in the word VIHI, Vayehi, \"and it was done,\"it occupieth the first place; but in the proposed metathesis it descended into the third place, in order that itmight be IHVI, Yahevi). And they are bound together the one to the other (male and female, V, Vau, and I,Yod, the path of beauty and the queen), namely, I, Yod, and H, He (by which are shown wisdom andknowledge, father and mother), like unto two lovers who embrace each other. (By two lovers are understoodeither V, Vau, and I, Yod, only\u0014that is, at the end; or I, Yod , and H, He, together\u0014that is, at the beginning).[The \"path of beauty,\" or Tiphereth, the sixth Sephira, is sometimes represented by V, Vau, and thereforesometimes stands for Microprosopus by itself; it is really the central Sephira of the group of six Sephirothwhich compose him. The numerical value of Vau is 6.]36. (Now the author of the \"Siphra Dtzenioutha\" hasteneth to the latter explanation of these letters, I, Yod, KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDSPRA DTzNIOVThA (SIPHRA DTZENIOUTHA); OR, THE BOOK OF CONCEALED MYSTERY.35"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"and V, Vau; and concerning V, Vau, he saith): Six members are produced from the branch of the root of hisbody. (The body is Microprosopus; the root of the body is the mother, who is symbolized by the letter H, He ;the branch of the root is the letter V, Vau, enclosed and hidden within the letter H, He; and from that verybranch were produced the six members\u0014that is, the entire letter V, Vau, now having obtained the head.)[The mother here mentioned is of course the third Sephira, Binah. The six members of Microprosopusforming the entire letter Vau in an allusion to the numerical value of that letter being 6.]37. \"The tongue speaketh great things\" (see Dan, vi. 8. And by the tongue is understood thefoundation\u0014namely, the letter I, Yod, joined with his bride; the speech is the marital influx flowing forth fromthe bride; for the queen is called the word; but the great things are the inferiors of all grades produced.) [Theinferiors of all \"grades\" or \"paths\" are the Sephiroth in the inferior worlds.]38. This tongue is hidden between I, Yod, and H, He. (For father and mother are perpetually conjoined inISVD, Yesod, the foundation, but concealed under the mystery of Daath or of knowledge.)[The conjunction of the letters V and H at the end of the Tetragrammaton IHVH is similar to that of I and Hat the beginning.]39. Because it is written (Isa. xliv. 5): \"That man shall say, I am of the Tetragrammaton.\" (The word ANI,Ani, I, when the discourse is concerning judgments, pertaineth to the queen. But whensoever mercy isintroduced it referreth to the understanding, like as in this place. In order that the sense may be: The supernalpath, which is called I, or the understanding in act of conjunction with the father, is for the purpose of theformation of the Tetragrammaton, and this is one conjunction between the father and the mother for theconstitution of the six members.) And that shall be called by the name Jacob, IOQB, Yaqob. (To call by nameis to preserve; and another conjunction of father and mother is introduced for the purpose of preserving theMicroprosopus, which is called Jacob.) And that man shall write with his hand, \"I am the Lord's\" (To writebelongeth to the written law, or the beautiful path, and the same also signifieth to flow in. \"With his hand,\"BIDV, Byodo, is by metathesis BIVD, Byod, by I, Yod\u0014that is, through the foundation; in order that the sensemay be, it may be formed from his influx, so that the Tetragrammaton may be written with I, Yod, as we haveabove said.) And by the name of Israel shall he call himself. He shall call himself thus in truth. (For theconception of the Microprosopus is more properly under the name of Jacob, whose wife is Rachel; and hiscognomen, as it were, is Israel, whose wife is Leah.) [The understanding is Binan, the third Sephira, which isreferred to the supernal H, He, The \"beautiful path\" is Tiphereth, the sixth. The foundation is Yesod, theninth. It is the final Yod, I, of the form of the Tetragrammaton IHVI, which is referred to Yesod, and not theinitial, which belongs to Chokmah, the second Sephira, the Father.]40. That man shall say, I am the Lord's; he descendeth. (That is: that very conception of the word I, which iselsewhere attributed to the supernal mother, forasmuch as in her agree the three letters of the word ANI, Ani,I; namely A, Aleph, is the highest crown; N, Nun, is the understanding itself, in its fifty celebrated gates; I,Yod, is the foundation or knowledge of the Father; but in this instance it is attributed to the lowest grade ofthe lower mother, and now is ADNI, Adonaï, without the D, Daleth, D, or poverty, but filled with the influx,and is ANI, Ani.) And all things are called BIDV, Byodo (that is, all these things are applied to IVD, Yod,concerning which this discourse is.) All things cohere by the tongue, which is concealed in the mother. (Thatis, through Daath, or knowledge, whereby wisdom is combined with the understanding, and the beautiful pathwith his bride the queen; and this is the concealed idea, or soul, pervading the whole emanation.) Since this isopened for that which proceedeth from itself (that is, Daath is itself the beautiful path, but also the inner,whereto Moses referreth; and that path lieth hid within the mother, and is the medium of its conjunction. Butwhensoever it is considered in the outer, when it hath come forth from the mother, then is it called Jacob.)[The reader is referred to the Introduction for the names, &c., of the Sephiroth.

The \"lower mother\" is of course the final H of the wordIHVH, the \"bride.\" Daath generally symbolizes the conjunction of the second and third Sephiroth.]41. (And herein IHV Yod, He, Vau, differeth from the whole name and from all the four letters. Now, heturneth back to the other portion of the four\u0014namely, IHV, Yod, He, Vau\u0014and saith:) The Father resideth inthe beginning (that is, that the letter I, Yod, which is the symbol of the wisdom and of the father, in that partholdeth the first place, like as in the whole system; since the crown nevertheless is hidden, and is onlycompared to the highest apex of the letter I, Yod). The mother in the middle (for the letter H, He, which is thesymbol of the unformed understanding and the supernal mother, holdeth the middle place between I, Yod ,and V, Vau, even as in the supernals she is comprehended by the Father from above, and by theMicroprosopus, which is her son, she is covered from below, in whom she sendeth herself downward into thepath of Hod, or of glory.) And she is covered on this side and on that (by the two, father and son). Woe, woeunto him who revealeth their nakedness! (Since this can be done by the faults of the inferiors, so thatMicroprosopus loseth this influx, whereby he is of so great power that he can seek to enshroud his mother;for that covering is the reception of the supernal influx, and the capability of transmitting the same to theinferiors, which cannot be done if the mother be uncovered and taken away from the Microprosopus, as theIsraelites did when they committed the sin of the calf.[IHV is of course the Tetragrammaton without the final H. It is interesting to note that in the qabalisticalwork called the \"Sepher Yetzirah,\" this trigrammatic name is used instead of the Tetragrammaton. The crownwhich is hidden is Kether, the first Sephira, or Macroprosopus, who is AHIH, and is therefore not openlyshown in IHVH. The path of Hod is the eighth Sephira. The father and the son, by whom the mother isenclosed, are of course the letters I and V in the word IHV. With regard to what is said regarding theIsraelites when they committed the sin of the calf. I imagine that it is intended to intimate\u0014(a) That the calfwas a symbol of ALHIM, Elohim, not of IHVH; for the Israelites had said, \"Make us Elohim to go beforeus.\" (b) That this name, \"Elohim\" is applied to the feminine portion of the Tetragrammaton HH. (c) Thattherefore the force was unbalanced which they adored, and that it would have been just as wrong to adore IValone.)42. And God said, let there be MARTh, Maroth, lights in the firmament of the heaven. (Now he hasteneth tothe third part of that quadrilateral name, namely, to these two letters IH, Yod, He . But by lights areunderstood the sun and the moon, the beautiful path and the kingdom or bride. And herein the sense is this:although usually by these two letters are accustomed to be understood the Father and the Mother, or thewisdom and the understanding, yet in this place the supernal lights are wanting, like as the word MARTh,Maroth, is written in a defective form; and the meaning is proper to be applied unto the firmament of theheaven\u0014that is, to the foundation, extended and prepared for marital conjunction; for the spouse is called theheaven, and the member of the treaty is the firmament, like, as, therefore, the two last paths in the wholename IHVI, Yod, He, Vau, Yod are designated by the letters V, Vau, and I, Yod, so likewise these in thisportion of the square are designated by the letters, I, Yod, and H, He.) The husband hath dominion over thewife (since it is not written by V, Vau, but by I, Yod, which is the symbol of the member of the treaty, andherein denoteth the actual combination with the female): like as it is written (Prov. x. 25): \"And the just manis the foundation of the world.\" (By this saying he illustrateth his meaning; because by the letter I, Yod, isunderstood the fundamental member by which the world is preserved in existence.)(If the reader refers to the Introduction, he will there find in the Table showing the operation of the Sephirothin the four worlds. &c., that in the world of Asiah the sun is referred to Tiphereth and the moon to Yesod.Furthermore, the circumstance of certain words being written defectively or redundantly is commented on inthe Introduction, § 15. The term \"square,\" or \"square name.\" is sometimes applied to the Tetragrammaton.The phrase \"member of the treaty\" probably alludes to the symbolism of circumcision. In this sense, I, Yod, inthe path of Yesod, the ninth Sephira, has a symbolical phallic signification.)

(That is, the letter I, Yod, in this square of the Tetragrammaton hath adouble sense of influx, forasmuch as in the first instance it signifieth the father who illuminateth the mother;and forasmuch as in the second instance it signifieth the Microprosopus, or rather his treaty, whichilluminateth the kingdom.) And (again in another manner) it shineth (that is, and also hath a thirdsignification, whilst in the complete name it constituteth the last letter), and passeth on into the woman. Thatis, and denoteth the bride of Microprosopus, as is shown above, because it is put in the place of the last H,He, of the Tetragrammaton IHVH; like as also it hath the same power of signification in the connection of thenames of existence and domination in this manner, IAChD, VNHI.)44. (Now he turneth to the last part of this square, which is I, Yod, alone, and saith), I, Yod, remaineth one andalone (in order that it may show that all flow out from the one single letter I, Yod, which is in the form of apoint, yet partaking of three parts, concerning which see elsewhere; yet in this place denoting only thewoman, or the kingdom, wherein are contained all the supernals.).[Yod at the end of the Tetragrammaton denotes the synthesis, the circular movement by which the end returnsto the beginning. In the secret qabalistical alphabet known as the \"celestial alphabet,\" Yod is represented bythree circles at the angles of an equilateral triangle with the apex uppermost. Malkuth, the tenth Sephira, ofcourse receives the influx of all the other Sephiroth (see Table showing the reception and transmission of theSephiroth in the four worlds.]45. And then (if now the Tetragrammaton be not considered in the manner just described, but in this mannerof instituting the square, IHVI, IHV, IH, I, then Yod also is in a certain sense solitary, but in a plainly contrarysense. For it ascendeth in its path upwards and upwards. (That is, it doth not so much receive thehigher sense, in order that it may denote the beautiful path or the foundation; but the highest, that is, thefather or the wisdom.) The woman is again hidden. (That is, in this instance, the former meaning by which itdenoted the bride of Microprosopus, namely, the last letter of the above−written form of the Tetragrammaton,ceaseth in itself.)(This is in the converse manner. The letter I no longer signifies the bride when it ceases to be the final letterof a Tetragrammaton.]46. And the mother is illuminated (that is, in the second part of the ordinary averse Tetragrammaton, whichconsists of the letters IH, to the letter I, Yod, which hath the signification of the father, is added the letter H,He, which is the mother, and because these two are combined by themselves, hence that luminous influenceis denoted wherewith the understanding is imbued by the supernal wisdom); and is opened out into her gates(that is, if these two letters be bound closely together, then out of the dead the pentad originateth the number50, by which are denoted the fifty gates of the understanding; these are said to be opened because the letter H,He , is last and unprotected, not being shut in by any other succeeding letter.)[This is taking the letters Th separate from the rest of the Tetragrammaton, but themselves conjoined. And asI = 10 and H = 5, these two conjoined (multiplied together) give N = 50. And these are the fifty gates orproperties of the understanding. These are opened, because in the word IH, Yah, the letter H is last, not beingshut in, as by VH in the Tetragrammaton IHVH, or V in the trigram IHV.]47. The key is added which containeth six, and closeth its gate. (That is, in the third part of this averse form,which is IHV, the letter H is not altogether the last; but V, the third letter of the Tetragrammaton, closeth it inon the other side, whereby are denoted the six members of the Microprosopus, superinvesting the sixmembers of the mother in such a manner that her last gate, which is the path of glory, HVD, Hod, is closed,and combined with the remainder, which are\u0014Benignity, Severity, Beauty, Victory; drawing their existencesingly out of the decad.)

(Or, as others read, \"it applieth to this side and to that.\"Now, the discourse is concerning the fourth part of the square, where the name is complete, whether writtenas H or as I in the last path; so that, nevertheless, the bride of Microprosopus may be added. Therefore oneither side hath Microprosopus a connecting link, for he superinvesteth the mother from the supernal part, sothat he may receive her into himself as his soul; and he also again is covered by his bride from the inferiorpart, so that he in his turn may himself become her soul.)[The bride, the inferior H, He. is said to be a reflection of the mother, the supernal H, He, in theTetragrammaton: just as Microprosopus is said to be the reflection of Macroprosopus.]49. Woe unto him who shall open her gate! (The gates are said to be paths through which influence rushethforth; they are said to be closed, because, on the other hand, too much influence cannot be taken away fromthe inferiors; wherefore the members are said to be overshadowed by the members, so that the light maydiminish in its transit. But when those very concatenations and cohibitions of the lights are separated by thesins of the inferiors, no influx can come into the universe in a proper manner.)[Following out the symbol of the equilibrium in the Sephiroth, the sin of the inferior paths would be theintroduction of unbalanced force.

The beard of truth. (That is, now followeth a description of the beard of Macroprosopus, and its thirteenparts, which are more fully described in the \"Idra Rabba.\")[The beard is the influx which descends from the first Sephira through all the others. Macroprosopus is ofcourse, as I have fully explained in the Introduction. the first Sephira, Kether, or the crown; also called theAncient One.]2. Of the beard mention hath not been made. (The correct Mantuan Codex hath this correction, so that theword DQNA, Deqena, is here inserted in the original text. The meaning is, that Solomon in the \"Song ofSongs\" maketh mention of all the other members, but not of the beard.) Because this is the ornament of all. (Itis called an ornament because it covereth the rest, just as a garment which ornamenteth the body covereththat. But this beard covereth not only the Macroprosopus, but also the father and the mother, and descendetheven unto Microprosopus. Whence, on account of the communication of so copious a light, it hath also itselfbeen clothed as with a garment with the great reverence of silence.)(By this beard, covering \"not only Macroprosopus, but also the rather and the mother,\" is meant that, while itis an important attribute of Macroprosopus (who is, be it carefully remembered by the reader Eheieh, AHIH,and not IHVH, in which latter name he is only alluded to as \"the uppermost point of the letter I, Yod\"), it alsoextends through the Sephiroth, for it covers the father and the mother (i.e., the second Sephira, Chokmah,wisdom. and the third Sephira, Binah, understanding, the IH of IHVH). Thus, therefore, though properlyspeaking a part of AHIH, and not of IHVH, it extends through the Tetragrammaton IHVH, for it \"descendetheven unto Microprosopus,\" the next six Sephiroth, the V of IHVH.)3. From the ears it proceedeth about the circumference of the open space; the white locks ascend anddescend. Into thirteen portions it is distributed in adornment. (Of all these see the explanation in the \"Idra KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER II.39"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Rabba\" and \"Idra Zuta.\")[These thirteen divisions of the beard of Macroprosopus are all descanted upon at length in both the \"Greater\"and \"Lesser Holy Assembly,\" in the first mentioned of which a chapter is devoted to the consideration of eachdivision. I therefore shall not need to enter into the subject here. as the reader will find all the information herequires in the latter part of this volume. By Gematria (see Introduction). the word AChD, Achad, one, unity= 13. The beard therefore is a glyph of the unity.]4. Concerning that ornamentation it is written (Jer. ii. 6). \"No man passed through it; and where no mandwelt.\" Man is without, man is not included therein; much less the male.[The verse runs in the English version: \"Through a land that no man passed through, and where no mandwelt.\"]5. Through thirteen springs are the fountains distributed (by which there is an influx upon Microprosopus andthe inferiors). Four are separately joined together, but nine flow upon the body (or, as others read, by adviceof the correct Mantuan Codex), encircle the garden (that is, the Microprosopus).[The four, separately joined, probably refer to the four letters of the Tetragrammaton, and the nine to the lastnine Sephiroth\u0014i.e. , exclusive of Kether. The Garden, or Paradise, is another term expressive of the wholeSephirotic system in Atziloth the archetypal world.] 6. This ornamentation beginneth to be formed before thegate of the ears.7. It descendeth in beauty into the beginning of the lips; from this beginning into that beginning.8. There existeth a path which goeth out beneath the two galleries of the nostrils, in order that he may seek topass over transgression; like as it is written, Prov. xix. 11. \"And it is glory to pass over a transgression.\"[The parting of the moustache on the centre of the upper lip. \"It is his glory to pass over a transgression.\"]9. Beneath the lips the beard goeth about into another beginning.10. Beneath that another path goeth forth.11. It covereth the approaches to the aromatic beginning which is above.12. Two apples are beheld, to illuminate the lights.[The two \"apples,\" or \"apple−trees,\" are the cheeks. Compare with this the imagery of the Song of Solomon.]13. The influence of all floweth down as far as the heart (therein hang suspended the superiors and theinferiors).14. Among those locks which hang down, none shineth forth above another.15. The lesser cover the throat like an ornament; the greater are restored to perfect proportion.16. The lips are free on every side. Blessed is he who shall become the receiver of their kisses.17.

(But in) IHI (besides) the superior and inferior (also existeth) the H, He, between both (like as) aconnexion of perfection (whereby the influx is derived from the Macroprosopus and passed on to theMicroprosopus.)25. (Wherefore) it is perfect (since it is this name without separation), but it is not turned to every side(because therein is no symbol of the bride of Microprosopus). (Therefore) this name is taken out from thisplace and planted in another (that is, those letters also receive another signification from the inferior paths).

(For) it is written, Gen. ii. 8: \"And the Tetragrammaton Elohim planted.\" (Whereby is understood) that H,He, which is between the two II, Yods, of the word IHI, Yehi, which in the supernals is) the position of thenose of the more Ancient One over the Microprosopus (concerning which see further in the \"Idra Rabba,\" §175). (For this) existeth not without the spirit.[For this H, He, symbolised in Elohim, is rather the supernal Healone, than either the inferior He alone, or both conjoined. The nose of Macroprosopus is said in the \"IdraRabba\" to be life in every part\u0014i.e., it, the life, existeth not therefore without the influx of the spirit whichrusheth forth therefrom (See ante , Chapter I. § 15.)]27. Through H, He, therefore, it is perfected (rather by reason of the mother than by reason of the bride, ofwhom it is the soul). For the one H, He, is above (namely, designating the first understanding of theTetragrammaton; and the other is) the H, He, below (denoting the queen and the bride).29. Like as it is written, Jer. xxxii. 17: AHH ADNI IHVH, Ahah, Adonai, Yod He Vau He: \"Ah, LordJehovah,\" &c., where there is a cohesion of the connecting links (that is, in the word AHH, Ahah , those twoHH, He's, are combined which elsewhere are the media of the connecting path). For by the spirit is made theconnection of the balanced equilibria (that is, of the combinations as well of the father and mother as of theMicroprosopus and his bride).29. (Now the author of the \"Siphra Dtzenioutha\" descendeth to the inferior paths, leaving out Macroprosopus,and examineth the name IHV, Yod He Vau. In this are represented father and mother and Microprosopus.And first occurreth) the supernal I, Yod (the symbol of the father), which is crowned with the crown of themore Ancient One (that is, whose highest apex denoteth the highest crown, or Macroprosopus; or, accordingto another reading of the passage, \"which is surrounded by the secret things\"\u0014that is by the influence or beardof Macroprosopus, which covereth both the father and the mother). it is that membrane of the supernal brainwhich, on account of its excellency, both shineth and is concealed. (Concerning this matter further, see the\"Idra Rabba,\" § 58.)30. The supernal H, He (then presenteth itself), which is surrounded by the spirit which rusheth forth from theentrances of the galleries (or the nostrils of Macroprosopus), that it may give life to all things.P. The supernal V, Vau, is that tremendous flashing flame (which is the beginning of Judgment, seeing thatdoubtless hitherto the Microprosopus existeth in the mother) which is surrounded by its crown (namely, themother).32. And after are the letters taken in extended form (so that this name is written at length, in this manner: VV,Vau, HH, He , IVD, Yod, which form, when it is perfect, is usually called BN, Ben, because its numeration is52), and in Microprosopus are they comprehended (seeing that then he embraceth his bride).[See Introduction, page 33, Table showing the writing of the Tetragrammaton in the four worlds.]33. When (this form) beginneth, they are discovered in the cranium (namely, these letters, and therein arethey distributed in the most supernal part of Macroprosopus).[\"In the cranium\" (or skull), BGVLGLThA. Begolgoltha, or in Golgoltha. In the New Testament it is worthyof note that Jesus Christ (the Son) is said to be crucified at Golgotha (the skull): while here, in the Qabalah,Microprosopus (the Son), as the Tetragrammaton, is said to be extended in the form of a cross, thus\u0014 KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER II.42"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"\u0014in Golgotha (the skull). The text above says, at the end of section 33, \"of Macroprosopus\"; but I think this isa misprint for \"of Microprosopus.\"]34. Thence are they extended throughout his whole form (from the original benignity), even to the foundationof all things (namely, as the soul of the inferiors). 35. When it is balanced in the pure equilibrium (that is,when the white locks of the most holy Ancient One send down the lights or names) then are those lettersequilibrated. (That is, from their virtue cometh the light.)[The \"lights or names\" are the ten Sephiroth and the Divine names associated with them (see Introduction),which are (with the exception of the first Sephira) comprehended in the Tetragrammaton IHVH.]36. When he is manifested in Microprosopus (namely, Macroprosopus), in him are those letters, and by themis he named.37. IVD, Yod, of the Ancient One, is hidden in its origin (that is, the father, who is usually symbolized by I,Yod, and is himself also called the Ancient One, is shrouded by the beard of Macroprosopus; or otherwise.Instead of that manner in which the other two letters duplicate their literal parts\u0014e.g., HH and VV\u0014I, Yod, byreason of his very nature, cannot be expressed by this duplication, but remaineth one and alone), because thename is not found; that is, because if II be put, it can no longer be pronounced as I, Yod; therefore is it writtenIVD).[The \"Ancient One\" is one of the titles of Macroprosopus, the first Sephira. But the letter I, Yod. of theTetragrammaton is referred to the second Sephira, Chokmah, which is also called the Father. SeeIntroduction, § 67.]38. HA, He, is extended by another (He, as it is written HH in open and plain writing; but also it is sometimeswritten in another way, HI, also HA; the one in the name OB, Aub, the other in the name MH, Mah), and inthe feminine symbol it denoteth the two females (namely, the supernal mother and the inferior mother; theunderstanding and the kingdom). And it is discovered through the forms. (That is, when the beard ofMacroprosopus, and its forms or parts, send down his light into Microprosopus; then herein is his brideproduced in the light, and the supernal H, He, is reflected by another inferior H, He.)[See introduction, wherein a table is given showing the writing of the Tetragrammaton in the four worlds.]39. VV, Vau, is extended by another (Vau, as it is written VV, for likewise it is elsewhere written with I in thename OB, Aub, and by A in the names SG, Seg, and MH, Mah, in this manner VAV. So also in the name BN,Ben, it is thus written, VV. But to be disclosed it is fully written). Like as it is written, Cant. vii. 9, \"Goingdown sweetly to my delight\" (whereby \"sweetly\" are understood these two letters VV properly extended).[The Authorised Version renders it: \"And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goethdown sweetly. causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.\"]40. In that tremendous flashing flame (is he found\u0014i.e., in Microprosopus, seeing that in a lesser degree hehath in himself unmixed judgments), for the purpose of enshrouding that gate (that is, in order that he may beadvanced to the condition of maturity, and may then superumbrate his mother, who is symbolised by the fiftygates).[\"He,\" that is the letter V, Vau, of the Tetragrammaton. I have before noticed that the fifty gates of theunderstanding are equivalent to I and H, 10 and 5, multiplied together, which yield 50 = numerical value of KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER II.43"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"the letter N. Nun.]41. (He is therefore called) the supernal V, Vau (Daath or knowledge, and) the inferior V, Vau (that is, theexternal Microprosopus. And thus also) the supernal H, He (the mother), the inferior H, He (the bride). But I,Yod, is above all (symbolizing the father), and with him is none other associated; he is I, Yod, as at first;neither ascendeth he in himself (through the height of the numeration, like as with H, He, the pentad, withVau, the hexad, ascend to a similar height) except as a symbolic glyph. (That is, the decad, which isexpressed not in that same letter I, Yod, but by a hexad and a tetrad).[But Vau, V, is produced by adding the numerical values of I and H (the father and the mother of theTetragrammaton), and then taking the last number of the result, thus: I + H = 10 + 5 = 15, and by adding thedigits of 15 together, 1 + 5, we obtain 6 = V, Vau. By the phrase \"with H, He, the pentad (5), with V, Vau, thehexad (6), ascend,\" is implied the numerical value of those letters taken as symbolical sephirotic glyphs. Thedecad is repeated in the word IVD, Yod, by the addition of the last two letters, V and D, which = 6+4 = 10. I,Yod, again.]42. For when the double forms are manifested (namely, the letters of the name in the above proposed form, asHH and VV) and are united in one path, in one combination, in order that they may be explained (that is,when they are fully written out in the above manner), then VD, Vau, Daleth (and not another I, Yod), areadded unto I, Yod (so that also in it there may be a certain hidden analogy of the equilibrium).43. Woe! woe! when this is taken away, and when the other two alone are manifested (that is, when fromthose two letters VD, in the word IVD, the letter I is taken away; seeing it representeth the abstraction of thefather from the Microprosopus and his bride, who are as yet hidden in the mother, so that the disclosure ofthese two is vain and abortive, because the generative power of the father is absent * *) * * *. (Or, in anothersense, if the influx be hindered and the supernal paths suffer disruption). Far, far from us be that effect!44. (But that this may be done by the sins of the inferiors is clear from these words) Ezek. i. 14: \"And theliving creatures rush forth and return.\" Also Num. xxiv. iii: 'Flee unto thy place.\" Also Obad. i. 4: \"Thoughthou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I cast thee down.\"45. (Again it is said) Gen. i. 12: \"And the earth brought forth germination.\" When? When the name is plantedtherein (that is, when Microprosopus receiveth his proper conformation, according to the requisitenumbers¢48 of the members, and 365 of the veins.)[These numbers, 248 and 365, are formed by an elaborate combination of Gematria, too complicated to enterupon here.]46. And then the wind bloweth (that is, the vital influx rusheth forth from Macroprosopus) and the spark offlame is prepared (that is, Microprosopus, who, great as he is, yet is in respect of the superiors only as a sparkcompared with fire, as he is produced from that terrific light.)47. And amid the insupportable brilliance of that mighty light, as it were, the likeness of a head appeareth.(That is, the highest crown is found in Macroprosopus.)48. And above him is the plenteous dew, diverse with two−fold colour. (Like as in Macroprosopus it is whitealone, so here it is white and red, on account of the judgments. See \"Idra Rabba,\" § 44.)[Above Microprosopus, not Macroprosopus.]49. Three hollow places are manifested, wherein the letters are expressed. (These are to be understood as KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER II.44"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"symbolizing his three−fold brain, of wisdom, understanding, and knowledge, which here appear moreplainly; whereas in the supernals they are more concealed.)[\"The letters,\" that is, IHV, the first three letters of the Tetragrammaton.]50.

Right and left is here given (in all parts of the face and head).[\"Right and left:\" that is, Microprosopus is symbolized by a face in full; while in Macroprosopus \"all isright\"\u0014i.e., he is symbolized by a profile. This and the following sections are considered at length in the \"IdraRabba Qadisha\" (\"The Greater Holy Assembly\"), and the \"Idra Zuta Qadisha\" (\"The Lesser HolyAssembly\"), to which the reader is referred.]52. One slender higher path existeth. (The parting of the hair.)53. His forehead, which shineth not, regulating the far distant future when it is his will to behold the same.(All the qualities, with their antitheses, which are found in Macroprosopus, are more fully described in the\"Idra Rabba\" and \"Idra Zuta,\" which see).54. His eyes are of triple colour (that is, red, black and gold) so that terror may go before them; and withglittering glory are they glazed.55. It is written, Isa. xxxiii. 20: \"Thine eyes shall behold Jerusalem at peace, even thy habitation.\"56. Also it is written, Isa. i. 21: \"Righteousness dwelled in it.\"57. The \"peaceful habitation\" is the Ancient One, who is hidden and concealed. Wherefore \"thine eyes\" iswritten OINK, Auinak (without the letter Yod. All these things are explained in the \"Idra Rabba.\")58. There is also the nose, to dignify the face of Microprosopus.59. Through its nostrils three flames rush forth.60. The profound path existeth in his ears for hearing both the good and the evil.61. It is written, Isa. xiii. 8: \"I am the Tetragrammaton, that is my name, and my glory I give not to another.\"(Now the author of the \"Siphra Dtzenioutha\" beginneth to explain the ulterior difference betweenMicroprosopus and Macroprosopus, even as to their appellations; where the word ANI, Ani, \"I,\" in the abovepassage referreth to the Microprosopus, since it involveth the idea of the bride.) Also it is written, Deut. xxxii.39: \"I slay, and I make alive.\" Also it is written, Isa. xlvi. 4: \"I will bear, and I will deliver you.\"[In the word ANI, Ani, the idea of the bride (Malkuth, the H final of the Tetragrammaton) is implied by theletter I, Yod, being last, where it symbolizes the ninth Sephira, Yesod, which is the connecting link betweenMicroprosopus and the queen. Also N, the second letter, symbolizes the conjunction of the father and themother, I and H, as I have before observed.]62. (Now, indeed, Macroprosopus is not so closely known by us as to address us in the first person; but he iscalled in the third person, HVA, Hoa, he.) Like as it is said, Ps. c. 3: \"He hath made us, and not we KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER II.45"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"ourselves.\" And again in Job xxiii. 13: \"And He existeth in the unity, and who can turn Him aside?\"[For Macroprosopus is only the commencement of manifested Deity .]63. (Therefore in the third person, HVA, Hoa, is He called who is the Concealed One, and is not found ofany. He, who cometh not before the eyes, of man; He, who is not called by the Name.[\"He, who is not called by the Name;\" for, as I have frequently before noticed, the first Sephira is notcomprehended in the Tetragrammaton.]64. (Hitherto hath the disquisition been concerning Microprosopus, to whom also was referred that fulness ofform of the letter H, He , wherein it is written by the duplicated HH. But now another point is taken intoconsideration, namely, concerning the remaining two modes of writing that letter, when It is written with A,Aleph, and with I, Yod; of which the former is made in the name MH, Mah, and the latter in the names OB,Aub, and SG, Seg; which two forms are given conjoined in the name AHIH, Eheieh (translated \"I am\" inExodus). Therefore are to be considered) HA and HI. (Whilst, therefore, it is written HA, this form can beresolved into HVA, Hoa, he, that pronoun of the third person concerning which mention hath been madeabove: because A, Aleph, in itself containeth V, Vau; to which latter letter the middle line, in the form of thecharacter of the letter Aleph, can be assimilated. And thus, while it is written HA, the word HVA can besymbolized; but not vice versâ. For although) V in itself containeth A (because the figure of the letter A maybe said to be composed of VIV, if its middle line be divided; so, that also, without taking the whole characterA into consideration, it may be read HV: this HV) nevertheless doth not contain in itself any real form ofwriting H, so that it can be read HV or HI.[The reader must remember that the argument in this section is concerning the shape of the Hebrew lettersmentioned, alone, and that neither their numerical value nor articulate power is taken into consideration. Theshape of the Hebrew letters can be seen in the Table of the Alphabet.]65. (Moreover, in that same form of writing HA, like as A passeth into V, so that HVA, Hoa, may be read: soalso) A is pronounced Aleph (and this is the second way of pronouncing the writing HA, which simply isreferred unto MH, Mah. But, moreover, also) Aleph is pronounced as IVD, Yod (because the form of theletter A is usually resolved into these three letters, so that Yod may be above, Vau in the middle, andDaleth below. So that same written form HA in itself comprehendeth also that sublimer triune idea. But notvice versâ, from HI is HA to be understood, for I, Yod, is not pronounced Aleph; but IVD is pronounced as I,Yod , which is concealed with all concealments, and to which VD are not joined (like as that form is to befound in the shape of the letter Aleph.)[H, He, in Hebrew is the definite article; so that H−A may be read He−Aleph, the Aleph.]66. (But this form, which in itself includeth V, Vau, and D, Daleth, is usual in the inferior paths, and also inthe father. And) Woe! when I, Yod, irradiateth not the letters V, Vau , and D, Daleth; (and much more) whenI, Yod, is taken away from V, Vau, D, Daleth, through the sins of the world; (because then) the nakedness ofthem all is discovered.67. Therefore it is written, Lev. xviii. 7: \"The nakedness of thy father thou shalt not uncover.\" (For VD, VauDaleth are the same as H, He; and when it is written IVD, it is the same as if it were called IH (namely if V,Vau, be inserted in D, Daleth ). Woe! when Yod is taken away from He (that is, wisdom from understanding,which is the conceiving mother) because it is written, Lev. xviii. 7. \"And the nakedness of thy mother thoushalt not uncover; she is thy mother, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.\" Revere her; she is thy mother;because it is written, Prov. ii. 3: \"Because thou shalt call understanding thy mother.\" (This is arrived at byreading the word AM in this passage with the pointing Tsere, instead of with the usual Chireq pointing.)

Nine are said to be the conformations of the beard (of Microprosopus). For that which remaineth concealed(that is, the other four forms, which meanwhile are not found in Microprosopus), and which is notmanifested, is supernal and venerable (that is, properly and of itself doth not refer to Microprosopus, butnevertheless descendeth upon him in another manner).[It must be remembered that the beard of Macroprosopus had thirteen divisions, therefore the other fourforms are the difference between the nine of Microprosopus and the thirteen of Macroprosopus.]2. Thus, therefore, is this most excellent beard arranged. The hairs overhang the hairs from before theopening of the ears, even unto the beginning of the mouth. (This is the first conformation.)3. From the one beginning even unto the other beginning (of the mouth. This is the secondconformation\u0014namely, the beard on the upper lip).4. Beneath the two nostrils existeth a path filled with hairs, so that it appeareth not. (This is the thirdconformation.)5. The cheeks extend on one side and on the other. (This is the fourth conformation.)6. In them appear apples red as roses. (This is the fifth conformation.)7. In one tress hang down those hairs strong and black, even unto the breast. (This is the sixth conformation.)8. Red are the lips as roses, and bare. (This is the seventh conformation.)9. Short hairs descend through the place of the throat and cover the position of the neck. (This is the eighthconformation.) 10. Long and short descend alike. (This is the ninth conformation.)11. Whosoever is found among them, is found strong and robust. (That is, he who directeth his meditationsherein.)12. It is written, Ps. cxviii, 4: \"I called upon Yah, IH, in distress.\" (In this place) David commemorateth(these) nine (conformations) even unto (those words) \"all nations compassed me about,\" in order that they(the nine above mentioned) might surround and protect him.13. (It is written, Gen. i. 12) \"And the earth brought forth germination, the herb yielding seed after its kind;and the tree bearing fruit, whose seed is therein, according to its kind.\"14. Those nine (paths of Microprosopus) are evolved from the perfect name (that is, from the understandingor mother, in whom they were conceived; for unto her pertaineth the name IHVH, which is Tetragrammatonexpressed and Elohim hidden, which form the nine in power). And thence are they planted into the perfectname, like as it is written, Gen. ii. 8: \"And IHVH ALHIM planted\" (that is, these nine letters of the perfectmasculine and feminine name, so that they may be a garden\u0014that is, Microprosopus in action).

The conformations of the beard (of Microprosopus) are found to be thirteen when that which is superiorbecometh inferior. (That is, whensoever the beard of Macroprosopus sendeth down its light. But in theinferior (that is, Microprosopus taken by himself), they are beheld in nine (parts of that form).16. The twenty−two letters are figured forth in their colour; not only when the law is given forth in black fireupon white fire, but also in ordinary writings, because this beard is black.)[The number of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet is twenty−two. \"Black fire\" and \"white fire\" are thecolours of the beards of Microprosopus and of Macroprosopus respectively.]17. Concerning this (beard, that is understood which is said) concerning him who in his sleep beholdeth thebeard. \"When any one dreameth that he taketh the upper beard of a man in his hand, he hath peace with hisLord, and his enemies are subject unto him.\"[By the \"upper beard\" is meant the moustache.]18. Much more (if he seeketh to touch) the supernal beard. For the inferior light, taking its rise from thesupernal light which existeth within the benignity (thus the beard of Macroprosopus is entitled), is called inMicroprosopus the benignity in a more simple manner; but when it hath its action within the light, and itshineth; then is it called abounding in benignity. (Others read this passage thus:\u0014He who dreameth that hetoucheth the moustache of a man with his hand, he may be sure that be hath peace with his Lord, and that hisenemies are subject unto him. If that happeneth because he beholdeth in sleep such a thing as this only, muchmore shall it occur if he be found sufficiently worthy to behold what the supernal beard may be. For this,seeing that it is the superior, and is called the benignity, irradiateth the inferior. But in Microprosopus, &c.]19. It is written, Gen. 1. 20: \"Let the waters bring forth the reptile of a living Soul\" (Ch−IH, Chiah, livingcreature is to be here noted).(To this section belongs the annotation which is placed at the end of this chapter; which see.)20. Like as it is said IH, Yah (Ch−IH, Chiah, the corrected Mantuan Codex hath it, so that it may explain theword ChIH, Chiah, living creature, out of the eighth path of the understanding, which is that water of thename Yah, which denoteth father and mother. For when) the light of the former is extended unto the latter(which is the moving of the water) all things reproduce their kind at one and the same time\u0014the waters ofgood and the waters of evil. (That is, there is reproduction as well in divinity and sanctity as among terrestrialliving creatures and man; for by the reptile form souls are symbolized.)21. (For) while it saith: IShRTzV, Yeshratzu, \"Let them bring forth abundantly,\" they have vital motion; andthe one form is at once included in the other form; the living superior, the living inferior; the living good, theliving evil.22. (So also it is written, Gen. i. 26) \"And Elohim said, Let us make man.\" (Where) it is not written HADM,Ha−Adam, \"this man\"; but Adam, man, simply, in antithesis of the Higher One who hath been made in theperfect name.[Regarding the \"form of the heavenly man, see Introduction, § 55.] KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER III.48"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"23. When that one was perfected, this one also was perfected; but perfected as male and female, for theperfecting of all things.24.

(When)ALHIM, Elohim (is joined therewith, there is expressed), the nature of the female (who is called thekingdom).[\"The female who is called the kingdom,\" i.e., Malkuth, the tenth Sephira.]25. (Therefore) was the male extended, and formed with his members (in order that he might have), as itwere, regenerative power.[The \"members of the male\" are the six Sephiroth which together form Microprosopus.]26. By means of this regenerative power those kings, who had been destroyed, were herein restored, andobtained stability. (For when the lights were sent down through narrow channels in less abundance, theinferior intelligences could take possession of them.)[The \"kings who had been destroyed\" are the \"Edomite kings;\" the \"worlds of unbalanced force,\" \"who couldnot subsist because the form of the heavenly man\" was not as yet. See Introduction, § 41. 56.]27. The rigours (of judgments, which are symbolized by those kings), which are masculine, are vehement inthe beginning; but in the end they are slackened. In the female the contrary rule obtaineth.28. (We have an example of this in this form of the name) VIH (where the male hath two letters, and thefemale one only; and the masculine also the letter in the beginning long, and afterwards short. But also in thisform) the channels of connection are shrouded beneath His covering (that his, the supernal letters aredoubtless connected in marital conjunction, but they are enshrouded in the letter Vau. And) Yod (is in thisplace) small, (a symbol of the foundation; because) in the very form (of the female, that is, even as he ishidden within H, He, which also is not the supernal but the inferior H, He) he is found. (And all arejudgments, because the supernal influx is wanting.)29. But if (these) judgments are to be mitigated, necessarily the Ancient One is required (that is, the firstletters of the Tetragrammaton, denoting, IH, Yah, the father together with the crown, which is the apex of theprimal letter, and is called Macroprosopus.)30. The same species of rigours and judgments occurred in the inferiors. For like as to the He of the bride, areadded the two letters Yod and Vau, under the idea of the leviathan; (so) the serpent came upon the woman,and formed in her a nucleus of impurity, in order that he might make the habitation evil. 31.

(Thus also) the form and person of a man was seated upon the throne; and it is written, Ezek. i. 26: \"Andupon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above it.\" [This piece alludes tothe Tetragrammaton itself, showing the hieroglyphic form of a man: the I = head, H = arms, V = body, and H= legs. See Introduction and Table of Alphabet.]ANNOTATION.(Belonging to § 19, foregoing.)1. Another explanation. \"Let waters bring forth abundantly.\" In this place, in the Chaldee paraphrase, it issaid IRChShVN, which hath a general meaning of movement. As if it should be said: \"When his lips bymoving themselves and murmuring, produced the words, like a prayer from a righteous heart and pure mind,the water produced the living soul.\" (The meaning is concerning the act of generating life.)2. And when a man wishes to utter his prayers rightly before the Lord, and his lips move themselves in thismanner, (his invocations) rising upward from him, for the purpose of magnifying the majesty of his Lordunto the place of abundance of the water where the depth of that fountain riseth and floweth forth (that is,understanding emanating from wisdom); then (that fountain floweth forth plentifully, and) spreadeth abroadso as to send down the influx from the Highest, downwards from that place of abundance of water, into thepaths singly and conjointly, even unto the last path; in order that her bountiful grace may be derived into allfrom the highest downwards.[H, He, the supernal mother.]3. Then indeed is such a man held to intertwine the connecting links of (them) all, namely, those connectinglinks of true and righteous meditation; and all his petitions shall come to pass, whether his petition be made ina place of worship, whether in private prayer.[\"Such a man\"\u0014i.e., a righteous man, when praying sincerely. \"Links of them\"\u0014i.e., the paths.] 4. But thepetition, which a man wisheth to make unto his Lord can ordinarily be propounded in nine ways.5. Either (1) by the alphabet, or (2) by commemorating the attributes of the most holy and blessed God,merciful and gracious, &c. (according to the passage in Exodus xxxiv. 6, &c.); or (3) by the venerable namesof the most holy and blessed God; such are these: AHIH, Eheieh (in respect of the Crown), and IH, Yah (inrespect of the Wisdom); IHV, Yod He Vau (in respect of the Understanding); AL, El (in respect of theMajesty); ALHIM, Elohim (in respect of the Severity); IHVH, Yod He Vau He (in respect of the Beauty);TzBAVTh, Tzabaoth (in respect of the Victory and the Glory); ShDI, Shaddai (in respect of the Foundation);and ADNI, Adonai (in respect of the Kingdom). Or (4) by the ten Sephiroth or numerations, which are: KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER III.50"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"MLKVTh, Malkuth, the Kingdom; ISVD, Yesod, the Foundation; HVD, Hod, the Glory; NTzCh, Netzach ,the Victory; ThPARTh, Tiphereth, the Beauty; GBVRH, Geburah , the Severity; ChSD, Chesed, theBenignity; BINH, Binah, the Understanding; ChKMH, Chokhmah, the Wisdom; and KThR, Kether, theCrown. Or (5) by the commemoration of just men, such as are patriarchs, prophets, and kings. Or (6) by thosecanticles and psalms wherein is the true Qabalah. And (7), above all these, if any one should know how todeclare the conformations of his Lord, according as it is honourable to do. Or (8) if he may know how toascend from that which is below to that which is above. Or (9) those who know also how to derive the influxfrom the highest downward. And in all these nine ways there is need of very great concentration of attention;because if he doeth not that, it is written concerning him, 1 Sam. ii. 30: \"And they that despise Me shall belightly esteemed.\"[\"(1) by the alphabet\"\u0014i.e., according to the mystic qabalistico, theosophic values of the letters.

Hereto also pertaineth the meditation of the word Amen, AMN! which in itself containeth the two namesIHVH, ADNI, Yod He Vau He Adonaï (the numeration of the former alone, and of these two togetheryielding the same, 91); of which the one concealeth its goodness and benediction in that treasury which iscalled HIKL, He−yekal, the palace. (Which word by equality of numeration is the same as ADNI, Adonaï,but this name is said to be the palace of Tetragrammaton, because, in the first place it is pronounced by itsaid; also, in the second place, it is mingled with it alternately, letter by letter, in this way\u0014IAHDVNHI.[A + M + N = 1 + 40 + 50 = 91. I + H + V + H + A + D + N +I = 10 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 1 + 4 + 50 + 10 = 91.Again: H + I + K + L = 5 + 10 + 20 + 30 = 65. A + D + N + I = 1 + 4 + 50 + 10 = 65. The Jews, when theycome to the word IHVH in reading the Scriptures, either do not pronounce it at all and make a slight pause, orelse substitute for it the word Adonaï, ADNI.]7. And this is pointed out in that saying, Hab. ii. 20: \"But the Lord is in His holy temple; let all the earth keepsilence before Him.\" (HIKL, Ha−yekal, \"the temple, or palace;\" HS, Hes, \"keep silence;\" and ADNI, Adonaï,\"Lord;\" all have the same numeration\u0014namely, 65.)[H + S = 5 + 60 = 65.]8. For which reason our wise men of pious memory have said mystically, that every good thing of a man is inhis house; according to that which is written, Num. xi., 7: \"He is faithful in all Mine house.\" Which is thesame as if it were said \"in all which is with Me.\"9. But if any man attentively meditateth on the nine divisions of these forms (see § 5 ante), like as it is meetto do; that man is one who honoureth the Name of his Lord, even the Holy Name. And hereunto belongeththat which is written, 1 Sam. ii. 30: \"Since those who honour Me will I honour; and they that despise Me shallbe lightly esteemed.\" I will honour him in this world, that I may preserve him, and provide him with allthings of which he hath need, in order that all nations of the earth may see that the Name of the Lord is calledupon by him; and that they may fear him. And in the world to come he shall be found worthy to stand in thetabernacle of the righteous.10. Wherefore such an one seeketh nothing of which he hath need, because he is kept under the special KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER III.51"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"providence of his Lord, and can meditate concerning Him, as it is right to do.11. But what is to be understood by that passage\u0014\"And they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed?\" Suchan one is that man who can neither institute the union of the Holy Name, nor bind together the links of truth,nor derive the supernals into the position required, nor honour the Name of his Lord. Better were it for thatman had he never been created, and much more for that man who doth not attentively meditate when he saithAmen!12. For which reason, concerning that man especially who moveth his lips (in prayer), with a pure heart(meditating) on those purifying waters, in that passage expressly and clearly written, Gen. i. 26: \"And theElohim said, Let us make man.\" As if it were said concerning such a man who knew how to unite image andlikeness, as it is right: And they shall have dominion over the fish of the sea, &c.Hereunto is the annotation.CHAPTER IV.1. THE Ancient One is hidden and concealed; the Microprosopus is manifested, and is not manifested.[The \"Ancient One\" is Kether. Eheieh, Macroprosopus, the Vast Countenance. See introduction, §§, 42, 77.]2. When he is manifested, he is symbolized by the letters (in the ordinary form in which the Tetragrammatonis written).3. When he is concealed, he is hidden by the letters which are not disposed according (to the proper order) ofthe letters, or (according to another reading of this passage) in their proper place; because also in him theirsuperiors and inferiors are not rightly disposed (because of the disturbed transpositions).4. In Gen. i. 24 it is written: \"The earth brought forth the living creature after its kind, cattle and reptile,\" &c.Hereunto belongeth that which is written, Ps. xxxv. 7: \"O Lord, thou shalt preserve both man and beast.\"5. The one is contained under the general meaning of the other, and also the beast under the general idea ofthe man (on account of the mystery of the revolution of the soul).6. (And hereunto pertaineth that passage) Levit. i. 2: \"When a man shall bring from among you an offeringunto the Lord, &c. Ye shall offer, &c.\" Because animals are included under the generic term man.7. When the inferior man descendeth (into this world), like unto the supernal form (in himself), there arefound two spirits. (So that) man is formed from two sides\u0014from the right and from the left.8. With respect unto the right side he had NShMThA QDIShA, Neschamotha Qadisha, the holy intelligences;with respect unto the left side, NPSh ChIH, Nephesh Chiah, the animal soul.[These answer to the right and left pillars of the Sephiroth. See Introduction.]9. Man sinned and was expanded on the left side; and then they who are formless were expanded also. (Thatis those spirits of matter, who received dominion in the inferior paths of the soul of Adam, whence arose baseconcupiscence.) When (therefore) both were at once joined together (namely by base concupiscence, togetherwith connexion, and the animal soul) generations took place, like as from some animal which generatethmany lives in one connexion.

(There are given) twenty−two letters hidden and twenty−two letters manifested (which are the symbols ofthose sublime forms).11. (The one) Yod is concealed; the other is manifested. (The one is the understanding or mother, the other isthe kingdom or queen; so that at the same time it looketh back to the superior paths.) But that which is hiddenand that which is manifest are balanced in the equilibrium of forms. (That is, masculine and feminine; theone, the father and the mother; the other, the foundation and the queen; meaning principally the female idea,which includeth form and receptacle.)12. Out of Yod are produced male and female (if, namely, it be fully written as IVD, Yod, they are then itsaugment), Vau and Daleth. In this position Vau is male, and Daleth is female. And hence arise DV, the twoletters which are the duad male and female; and not only the duad, but also the co−equal duads (of thesuperior and inferior conjunctions).13. Yod by itself is male (the father); He, female (the mother).14. H, He, at first was D, Daleth; but after it was impregnated by I, Yod (so that thence it might produce theform H\u0014namely the I, Yod, placed at the left hand lower part of Daleth) it brought forth V, Vau. (That is, themother impregnated by the father produced Microprosopus. But in the shape of the letter out of that minute I,Yod, which is hidden within the H, He, V, Vau, is said to be formed. Or from the upper horizontal line of theletter H, which is one V, Vau, and from the right−hand vertical line, which is another V, Vau, and from theinserted I, Yod, is made VIV, the full form of letter Vau .)[This is again referring to the shape of the letter. See Table of the Alphabet for Hebrew form.]15. Whence it is plain that in the letter H, He, are hidden the letters D, Daleth, V, Vau; and in IVD, Yod, ishidden H: whence are formed IHV. Therefore it appeareth that IVD in its own form containeth IHV,whensoever it is fully written by IVD, which are male and female (namely I, Yod, male, and V, Vau, D,Daleth, in the form, H, He, female); hence is compounded (the son, who is) V, Vau, and who overshadowethhis mother. (That is V placed after H, so that IHV may form the father, the mother, and Microprosopus.)16. (Therefore in the letter IVD, Yod, and in the name IHI are hidden two males and two females, which issymbolized in that saying, Gen. vi. 2: \"And the sons of the Elohim beheld (the plural in its least formdenoteth two) the daughters of men\" (and this also). This explaineth on this account that which is written,Josh. ii. 1: \"Two men as Spies, saying\" (hence is revealed the mystery of the two men). But how (is it provedthat two females are understood) by the words, \"Daughters of men?\" Because it is written, 1 Kings iii. 16:\"Then came there two women unto the king.\"17. Of these it is written, ibid. 28: \"Because they saw that the wisdom of Elohim was in him.\" (Here areinvolved the two males, in the wisdom, the father; in Solomon, Microprosopus. Therefore) then came they(even the two women, the understanding and the queen) and not before.18. In the palace of the union of the fountains (that is, in the world of creation) there were two connexions byconjunctions among the supernals; these descended from above, and occupied the earth; but they rejected thegood part, which in them was the crown of mercy; and were crowned with the cluster of grapes. (That isinstead of benignity, they were surrounded with judgments and rigours. Which also can be explainedconcerning Microprosopus and his bride, first in the mother, and afterwards in the existences below, and inexile with surrounding rigours and severities.)[Referring to the previous symbolical explanation of Joshua ii, 1.] KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER IV.53"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"19.

Five kings (that is, the five letters MNTzPK, Me, Nun , Tzaddi, Pe, Kaph, which are the roots of thejudgments), betake themselves into swift flight before four (the four letters of the Tetragrammaton whichbear with them the influx of benignity.

They are also divided into the three categories of Chesed, Din, and Rachmim,or mercy, judgment, and mildness. Now these five letters MNTzPK denote the severest judgments, and theirnumber = 280 = PR = the name of the angel Sandalphon, SNDLPVN, the angel IOR, or of the wood of theworld of Asiah, since the greatest part of it are sterile trees.]29. Four kings slay four (that is, the four letters of the Tetragrammaton are bound together with the fourletters ADNI, Adonaï , which) depend from them like grapes in a cluster (in the concatenation of these twonames, thus, IAHDVNHI).30. Among them are set apart (that is, among these paths of the Divine names a selection of holiness is madefrom these broken vessels) seven channels (that is, seven broken vessels, which now are like the shells, andcontain in themselves a great part of the lights and souls); they testify testimony (that is, the souls thusselected, thence having been born into the universe, testify that they are freed from impurity) and they do notremain in their place (and are no longer detained under the shells).31. The tree which is mitigated (that is, the path of the kingdom or Schechinah, which is the tree of theknowledge of good and evil, which in itself existeth from the judgments, but is mitigated by the bridegroomthrough the influx of mercies) resideth within (within the shells; because the kingdom hath its dominion overall things, and its feet descend into death). In its branches (in the inferior worlds) the birds lodge and buildtheir nests (the souls and the angels have their place). Beneath it those animals which have power seek theshade (that is, the shells, \"for in it every beast of the forest doth walk forth,\" Ps. civ. 20).[See the Introduction for the Sephiroth arranged in the three pillars, or tree of life.]32. This is the tree which hath two paths (for thus is this passage restored in the corrected Codex) for thesame end (namely, good and evil, because it is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil). And it hatharound it seven columns (that is, the seven palaces), and the four splendours (that is, the four animals) whirlaround it (in four wheels) on their four sides (after the fourfold description of the chariot of Yechesqiel(Ezekiel).[The seven palaces answer to the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th Sephiroth, operating through therespective orders of the angels into the spheres of the seven planets, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus,Mercury, and Luna. The four animals, or Chaioth Ha−Qadesch , are the vivified powers of the four letters ofthe Tetragrammaton operating under the presidency of the first Sephira as the mainspring of primummobile of creation. The four wheels are their correlatives under the second Sephira, on their foursides\u0014namely, the four elements of the air, fire, water, and earth, which are the abodes of the spirits of theelements, the sylphs, salamanders, undines, and gnomes, under the presidency of the tenth Sephira.]33.

With the Elohim, and not with the Tetragrammaton (because he himself is referred unto the path of thequeen, to whom is attributed this name of Rigour). \"And he existed not\" (longer) under this name (Enoch),because the Elohim took him in order that he might be called by this name. (For this name is communicableunto the angels, and in the first instance unto this chief among them, namely, Metatron.)36. There are three houses of judgment given, which are four (that is, the three letters IHV, referred into theunderstanding, which yield the four letters of the Tetragrammaton, pointed with the vowel points of the nameElohim. For) there are four superior houses of judgment (the four said Tetragrammatic letters) and fourinferior (which are the four letters ADNI, Adonaï, belonging unto the kingdom). For it is written, Lev. xix.35: \"Ye shall not do iniquity in judgment, in dimension, in weight, and in measure.\" (Where these four aremystically intimated.)37. (There is one) rigorous judgment (of severity),another that is not rigorous (that is, of the kingdom). Thereis one judgment by balance (wherein are the two scales of merit and error), another judgment which is notmade by balance; (and this is) the gentle judgment (whereby the Israelites are judged. But also there is given)the judgment which is neither of the one nature nor of the other. (Namely, the beautiful path.)[Of course the \"beautiful path\" is Tiphereth, the sixth Sephira.]38. (Further on it is written), Gen. vi. 1. \"And it came to pass when man began to multiply upon the face ofthe earth.\" (Where by these words) ADM, Adam, began to multiply (there is understood Daath, or theknowledge, the soul of the beautiful path, to which Moses is referred; which sendeth down many lights intothe bride, the earth, when the spouse ascendeth thither). This is that which is written (ibid. 3): BShGM,Beshegam, \"in that also, he is flesh\" (which word Beshegam, \"in that also,\" by equality of numerationequalleth MShH, Moses) Adam (namely) the supernal (Daath, or knowledge). And it is written: \"Upon theface of the earth\" (which face of the earth is this, that the highest representation of the queen is theunderstanding, the mother, unto whose gates Moses ascended). 39. (Concerning this face, it is written) Exod.xxxiv. 29: \"And Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone\" (where by the face the mother is understood; KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER V.59"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"by the skin, the queen.) This is that which is said, Gen. iii. 21: \"Tunics of skin\" (because by itself thekingdom is wanting in light).40. To shine (but when it is said \"the face of Moses,\" the mother is understood, according to that passage, 1Sam. xvi. 13: \"And Samuel took the horn of oil\" (where by the oil, the wisdom, by the horn, or the splendourof the oil, the understanding is denoted). For there is no anointing except by the horn (that is, every descent ofunction is through the mother). Hence it is said, Ps. lxxxix. 18: \"And in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.\"(Also) Ps. cxxxii. 17: \"There shall the born of David flourish\" (that is, the queen shall receive the influx fromthe mother). This is the tenth of the kings (that is, the path of the kingdom), and originateth from jubilee, whois the mother.41. For it is written, Josh. vi. 5: \"And it shall be when the horn of jubilee is sounded.\" This is the splendour ofthe jubilee, and the tenth (path) is crowned by the mother.42. (This is) the horn which receiveth the horn and the spirit, that it may restore the spirit of Yod He unto YodHe. (That is, when the spirit is to be given unto Microprosopus, his mother contributed as much, which isQRN, Qaran, \"the horn,\" the brilliancy, as the increase which he receiveth from the father.) And this is thehorn of jubilee. And IVBL, Yobel, \"jubilee,\" is H, He (the first He of the Tetragrammaton); and He is thespirit rushing forth over all (because the mother is the world to come, when in the resurrection all things willreceive the spirit); and all things shall return unto their place (like as in the jubilee, so in the world to come).43. For it is written, AHH, IHVH, ALHIM, Ahah Tetragrammaton Eloim! \"Ah Tetragrammaton Elohim!\"When the H, He, appeareth (first), and H, He (in the second place); then is Tetragrammaton called Elohim(like as a judge; because in the world to come there will be work for much strength. This is) the full name.And it is written, Isa. ii. 11: \"And Tetragrammaton alone shall be exalted in that day.\" When the one He isturned towards the other He, and Yod is taken away, then cometh vengeance into the universe; and except forthat Adam who is called Tetragrammaton, the universe would not exist; but all things would be destroyed.Hence it is written: \"And the Tetragrammaton alone,\" &c.44.

Rabbi Schimeon sat down and wept; then he said: \"Woe! if I shall reveal it! Woe! if I shall not reveal it!\"5. His companions who were there were silent.6. Rabbi Abba arose and said unto him: \"With the favour of the Lord, also it is written, Psa. xxv. 14: 'TheArcanum of the Tetragrammaton is with them that fear Him.' And well do these companions fear that Holyand Blessed One; and now they have entered into the assembly of the tabernacle of his house, some of themhave only entered, and some of them have departed also.\"7. Moreover, it is said the companions who were with Rabbi Schimeon were numbered, and they were foundto consist of Rabbi Eleazer, his son; and Rabbi Abba, and Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Yosi the son of Jacob,and Rabbi Isaac, and Rabbi Chisqiah the son of Rav, and Rabbi Chiya, and Rabbi Yosi, and Rabbi Yisa.8. They gave their hands unto Rabbi Schimeon, and raised their fingers on high, and entered into a field underthe trees and sat down.9. Rabbi Schimeon arose and offered up a prayer. He sat in the midst of them, and said: \"Let whosoever willplace his hand in my bosom.\" They placed their hands there, and he took them.10. When he began, he said (from Deut. xxvii. 15): \"Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or moltenimage, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and putteth it in a secret place. And all the people shall answerand say Amen!\"11. Rabbi Schimeon began, and said: \"Time for Thee, O Tetragrammaton to lay to Thine hand.\" Why is ittime for the Tetragrammaton to lay to His hand? Because they have perverted Thy law. What is this, theyhath perverted Thy law?' The higher law, which is itself made void, if it be not carried out according to hiscommands. Wherefore is this? (Or, as others read: Wherefore is this name Tetragrammaton hereemployed? ) This hath been said concerning the Ancient of Days. 12. \"For it is written, Deut. xxxiii. 29: 'Blessed art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee?' Also it is written,Exod. xv. 11: 'Who is like unto thee among the gods, O Tetragrammaton?'\" 13. He called Rabbi Eleazer, his son, and commanded him to sit down before him, and Rabbi Abba on theother side, and said: \"We are the type of all things\" (that is, \"we represent the three columns of theSephiroth;\") \"thus far are the columns established.\"14. They kept silence, and they heard a voice; and their knees knocked one against the other with fear. Whatwas that voice? The voice of the Higher Assembly, which had assembled above. (For out of Paradise camethe souls of Me just thither, that they might hearken, together with the Schechinah of the Presence Divine.)15. Rabbi Schimeon rejoiced, and said. \"O Tetragrammaton! I have heard Thy speech, and was afraid! (Hab.iii. 1). He hath said: 'It is therefore rightly done, seeing that fear hath followed; but for us the matter ratherdependeth upon love.' Like as it is written, Deut. vi. 5: 'And thou shalt delight in Tetragrammaton thy God.'Also it is written, Mal. i. 2: \"I have loved you.'\"16. Rabbi Schimeon said further: \"'He who walketh, going up and down (from one house unto another)revealeth the secret; but the faithful in spirit concealeth the word' (Prov. xi. 13).17. \"'He who walketh going up and down.'

(Butthis phrase) 'faithful in spirit' denoteth firmness of spirit; like as it is said, Isa. xxii. 23: 'And I will fasten himas a nail in a sure place.' Matter dependeth upon Spirit.21. \"And it is written, Eccles. v. 6: 'Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin.'22. \"For neither doth the world remain firm, except through secresy. And if in worldly affairs there be sogreat need of secresy, how much more in the things of the most secret of secrets, and in the meditation of theAncient of Days, which matters are not even revealed unto the highest of the angels.\"23. Rabbi Schimeon said, moreover: \"I will not say it unto the heavens, that they may hear; I will not declareit unto the earth, that it may hear; for certainly we are (the symbols of) the pillars of the Universe.\" 24. It issaid in the Arcanum of Arcana, that when Rabbi Schimeon opened his mouth, the whole place was shaken,and his companions also were shaken.CHAPTER II. OF THE CONDITION OF THE WORLD OF VACANCY.25. HE manifested the Arcanum, and commencing, said, Gen. xxxvi. 29: \"And those are the kings whichreigned in the land of Edom before that a king could rule over the children of Israel.\"26. Blessed are ye, O just men! because unto you is manifested the Arcanum of the Arcana of the law, whichhath not been manifested unto the holy superior ones.27. Who can follow out this matter? and who is worthy to do so? For it is the testimony of the truth of truths.Therefore let all our prayers be undertaken with devotion, lest it be imputed (to me) as a sin, that I am makingthis matter manifest.28. And perchance my companions may speak unto me, because some objection may arise against thesewords. For truly this work is not such a one as may be easily written down, so that by it may appear howmany kings there were before the children of Israel came, and before there was a king over the children ofIsrael: how therefore doth this matter agree? And for this reason my companions have moved the question.29. Therefore the Arcanum of Arcana is what men can neither know nor comprehend, nor can they applytheir rules of science to it.30. It is said that before the Ancient of the Ancient Ones, the Concealed One of the Concealed Ones,instituted the formations of the King (under certain members and pathsof Microprosopus) and the diadems of the diadems (that is, the varied coverings whereby the superfluity of the Lights iscircumscribed); beginning and end existed not (that is, there was neither communication nor reception).3 1. Therefore He carved out (that is, hollowed out a space by which he might flow in) and institutedproportions in Himself ( in as many ways as the Lights of his Understanding could be received, whence arosethe paths of the worlds), and spread out before Him a certain veil (that is, produced a certain nature, by KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER II. OF THE CONDITION OF THE WORLD OF VACANCY.62"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"which His infinite light could be modified, which was the first Adam); and therein carved out and distributedthe kings and their forms by a certain proportion (that is, all creatures under a condition of proper activity;by which He Himself might be known and loved); but they did not subsist. (Here is intimated the fall of thecreatures, partly into a condition of quiet, such as matter; partly into a state of inordinate motion, such asthat of the evil spirits).32. That is the same thing which is said, Gen. xxxvi. 29: \"And these are the kings which reigned in the landof Edom, before that there reigned a king over the children of Israel.\" The first king in respect of the childrenof Israel (by the children of Israel are understood the paths of the restored world) is the first.33. And all those things which were carved out, but subsisted not, are called by their names (that is, weredivided into certain classes ), neither yet did they subsist, until He forsook them (so that they could receivethe lights from the receptacles above themselves), and hid Himself before them (in diminished light).CHAPTER III. CONCERNING THE ANCIENT ONE, ORMACROPROSOPUS, AND CONCERNING HIS PARTS, AND ESPECIALLYCONCERNING HIS SKULL.34. AND after a certain time was that veil entirely disunited in formless separation, and recomposedaccording to its conformation.35. And this is the tradition: The Absolute desired within Himself to create the essence of light (the law\u0014thatis, the letters of the alphabet, from whose transpositions the law was formed), hidden for two thousand years,and produced Her. And She answered thus unto Him: \"He who wisheth to dispose and to constitute otherthings, let Him first be disposed according unto a proper conformation.\"36. This is the tradition described in the \"Concealed Book of the King,\" that the Ancient of the AncientOnes, the Concealed of the Concealed Ones, hath been constituted and prepared as in various members (forfuture knowledge).37. Like as if it were said, \"He is found (that is, He may in some way to a certain extent be known), and He isnot found;\" for He cannot be clearly comprehended; but He hath as it were been formed; neither yet is He tobe known of any, since He is the Ancient of the Ancient Ones.38. But in his conformation is He known; as also He is the Eternal of the Eternal Ones, the Ancient of theAncient Ones, the Concealed of the Concealed Ones; and in His symbols is He knowable and unknowable.39. White are His garments, and His appearance is the likeness of a Face vast and terrible. 40. Upon thethrone of flaming, light is He seated, so that He may direct its (flashes).41. Into forty thousand superior worlds the brightness of the skull of His head is extended, and from the lightof this brightness the just shall receive four hundred worlds in the world to come.42. This is that which is written, Gen. xxiii. 16. \"Four hundred skekels of silver, current money with themerchant.\"43. Within His skull exist daily thirteen thousand myriads of worlds, which draw their existence from Him,and by Him are upheld. KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER III.

And from that dew which floweth down from His head, that ( namely) which is external, the dead areraised up in the world to come.46. Concerning which it is written, Cant. v. 2: \"My head is filled with dew.\" It is not written \"It is full withdew;\" but NMLA, Nimla , \"it is filled.\"47. And it is written, Isa. xxvi. 19: \"The dew of the lights is Thy dew.\" Of the lights\u0014that is, from thebrightness of the Ancient One.48. And by that dew are nourished the holy supernal ones.49. And this is that manna which is prepared for the just in the world to come.50. And that dew distilleth upon the ground of the holy apple trees. This is that which is written, Exod. xvi.14: \"And when the dew was gone up, behold upon the face of the desert a small round thing.\"51. And the appearance of this dew is white, like unto the colour of the crystal stone, whose appearance hathall colours in itself. This is that which is written, Num. xi. 7: \"And its varieties as the varieties of crystal.\"CHAPTER V. FURTHER CONCERNING THE SKULL OFMACROPROSOPUS.52. THE whiteness of this skull shineth in thirteen carved out sides: in four sides from one portion; in foursides from the part of His countenance; and in four sides from another part of the periphery; and in one abovethe skull, as if this last might be called the supernal side. 53. And thence is the Vastness of His Countenance extended into three hundred and seventy myriads ofworlds; and hence ARK APIM, Arikh Aphim, Vastness of Countenance is His name.54. And He Himself, the Most Ancient of the Most Ancient Ones, is called ARIK DANPIN, ArikhDa−Anpin, the Vast Countenance, or Macroprosopus; and He Who is more external is called ZOIR ANPIN,Zauir Anpin, or Him Who hath the Lesser Countenance ( Microprosopus) in opposition to the AncientEternal Holy One, the Holy of the Holy Ones.55. And when Microprosopus looketh back upon Him, all the inferiors are restored in order, and HisCountenance is extended, and is made more vast at that time, but not for all time (then only is it), vast likeunto the (countenance) of the More Ancient one.56. And from that skull issueth a certain white shining emanation, towards the skull of Microprosopus, for thepurpose of fashioning His head; and thence towards the other inferior skulls, which are innumerable.57. And all the skulls reflect this shining whiteness towards the Ancient of Days, when they are numberedout of their mingled confusion. And by reason of this there existeth herein an opening towards the skullbelow, when they proceed to numeration. KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER IV.

IN the hollow of the skull is the aërial membrane of the supreme hidden Wisdom, which is nowheredisclosed; and it is not found, and it is not opened.59. And that membrane enshroudeth the brain of the hidden Wisdom, and therefore is that Wisdom covered,because it is not opened through that membrane.60. And that brain, which is itself the hidden Wisdom, is silent and remaineth tranquil in its place, like goodwine upon its lees.61. And this is that which they say:\u0014Hidden is the science of the Ancient One, and His brain is calm andconcealed.62. And that membrane hath an outlet towards Microprosopus, and on that account is His brain extended, andgoeth forth by thirty and two paths. 63. This is that same thing which is written: \"And a river went forth out of Eden\" (Gen. ii. 7). But for whatreason? Because the membrane is (then) opened, neither doth it (completely) enshroud the brain.64. Nevertheless the membrane is opened from below. And this is that which we have said: Among thesignatures of the letters (is) ThV, Tau, Th; nevertheless He impresseth it as the sign of the Ancient of Days,from Whom dependeth the perfection of knowledge, because He is perfect on every side, and hidden, andtranquil, and silent, like as good wine upon its lees.CHAPTER VII. CONCERNING THE HAIR OF MACROPROSOPUS.65. This is the tradition. From the skull of His head hang down a thousand thousand myriads; seventhousand and five hundred curling hairs, white and pure, like as wool when it is pure; which have not beenmingled confusedly together less inordinate disorder should be shown in His conformation; but all are inorder, so that no one lock may go beyond another lock, nor one hair before another.66. And in single curls are four hundred and ten locks of hair, according unto the number of the word,QDVSh, Qadosch, Holy. 67. But these hairs, all and singular, radiate into four hundred and ten worlds.68. But these worlds alone are hidden and concealed, and no man knoweth them, save himself.69. And he radiateth in seven hundred and twenty directions ( others say four hundred and twenty).70. And in all the hairs is a fountain, which issueth from the hidden brain behind the wall of the skull.71. And it shineth and goeth forth through that hair unto the hair of Microprosopus, and from it is His brainformed; and thence that brain goeth forth into thirty and two paths.72. And each curl radiateth and hangeth down arranged in beautiful form, and adorned with ornament, andthey enshroud the skull. KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER VI.

Also we have said: Each hair is said to be the breaking of the hidden fountains, issuing from theconcealed brain.75. Also this is the tradition: From the hair of a man it is known what he is, whether rigorous or merciful,when he passeth over forty years; thus also when he is perfect in hair, in beard, and in the eyebrows of hiseyes.76. The curls of His hair hang down in order, and pure like unto (pure) wool, even unto his shoulders. Say weunto His shoulders? Nevertheless, even unto the rise of His shoulders, so that His neck may not be seen,because of that which is written, Jer. ii. 27: \"Because they have turned away from Me the neck and not theface.\"77. And the hair is less close to the ears, lest it should cover them; because it is written., Ps. cxxx. 2. \"AsThine am are open.\" 78. From hence His hair stretcheth out behind His ears. The whole is in equilibrium; onehair doth not go beyond another hair, (they are ) in perfect disposition, and beautiful arrangement, andorderly condition.79. It is the delight and joy of the just, who are in Microprosopus, to desire to behold and to conform untothat conformation which is in the Ancient One, the Most Concealed of all.80. Thirteen curls of hair exist on the one side and on the other of the skull; (they are) about His face, andthrough them commenceth the division of the hair.81. There is no left in that Ancient Concealed One, but all is right. 82. He appeareth, and He appeareth not; He is concealed, and He is not concealed; and that is in Hisconformation much more so than in Himself.83. And concerning this the children of Israel wished to inquire in their heart, like as it is written, Exod. xvii.7: \"Is the Tetragrammaton in the midst of us, or the Negatively Existent One?\" ( Where they distinguished)between Microprosopus, who is called Tetragrammaton, and between Macroprosopus, who is called AIN,Ain , the Negatively Existent?84. But why, then, were they punished? Because they did it not in love, but in temptation; like as it is written(ibid.). \"Because they tempted the Tetragrammaton, saying, Is it the Tetragrammaton in the midst of us, or isit the Negatively Existent One?\"85. In the parting of the hair proceedeth a certain path, which shineth into two hundred and seventy worlds,and from that (again ) shineth a path wherein the just of the world to come shall shine.86. That is what is written, Prov. iv. 18: \"And the path of the just shall shine as the light, going forth, andshining more and more unto the perfect day.87. And out of that is the path divided into six hundred and thirteen paths, which are distributed inMicroprosopus.88.

THE forehead of His skull is the acceptation of acceptations, whereunto is opposed the acceptation ofMicroprosopus, like as it is written, Exod. xxviii. 38: \"And it shall be upon His forehead always foracceptation,\" &c.90. And that forehead is called RTzVN, Ratzon, Will−power, because it is the ruler of the whole head and ofthe skull, which is covered by four hundred and twenty worlds.91. And when it is uncovered, the prayers of the Israelites ascend.92. \"When is it uncovered?\" Rabbi Schimeon was silent. He asked again a second time, \"When?\" RabbiSchimeon said unto Rabbi Eleazar, his son, \"When is it uncovered.\"93. He answered unto him: \"In the time of the offering of the evening prayer on the Sabbath.\"94. He said unto him: \"For what reason?\" He answered unto him: \"Because at that time the lower judgmentthreateneth through Microprosopus; but that forehead is uncovered which is called 'Acceptation,' and thenwrath is assuaged, and the prayer ascendeth. 95. \"This is that which is written, Ps. lxix. 14: 'And I haveprayed unto Thee, O Tetragrammaton! in an acceptable time.'96. \"And the time of acceptance by the Ancient of Days is here to be understood, and of the unveiling of theforehead; and because it is thus disposed at the offering of the evening prayer on the Sabbath.\"97. Rabbi Schimeon spake unto Rabbi Eleazar, his son, and said: Blessed be thou, O my son! by the Ancientof Days; for thou hast found in that time in which thou hast need\u0014the acceptation of His forehead.98. Come and behold! in these inferiors, when the forehead is uncovered, there is found fixed shamelessness.99. This is the same which is written, Jer. iii. 3: \"Yet thou hadst the forehead of a shameless woman, thourefusedst to be ashamed.\"100. But when this forehead is uncovered, inclination and acceptation are found in perfect form, and allwrath is quieted and subdued before Him.10I, From that forehead shine forth four hundred habitations of judgments, when it is uncovered during thatperiod of acceptation, anti all things are at peace before it.102. This is the same which is written, Dan. vii. 10: \"The judgment was set\"\u0014that is, subsideth in its place,and the judgment is not exercised.103. And this is the tradition: There is no hair found on that part, because it is opened and not covered.104. It is covered, I say, and the executors of judgment behold this, and are pacified, and (judgment) is notexercised.105. This is the tradition: This forehead hath been extended into two hundred and seventy thousand lights ofthe luminaries of the superior Eden. 106. This is the tradition: There existeth an Eden which shineth in Eden.The superior Eden, which is not uncovered, and is hidden in concealment, and is not distributed into thepaths, like as it hath been said.

The inferior Eden is distributed into its paths; (namely ) into thirty−two directions of its paths.108. And although this Eden is distributed into its path, yet is it not known unto any, save untoMicroprosopus,109. But no man hath known the superior Eden, nor its paths, except Macroprosopus Himself.110. Like as it is written, Job xxviii. 23: \"God understandeth the way thereof, and He knoweth the placethereof.\"111. \"The Elohim understand the way thereof: \"this is the inferior Eden, known unto Microprosopus. \"AndHe hath known the place thereof:\" this is the superior Eden, which the Ancient of Days hath known, the mostabstruse of all.CHAPTER IX. CONCERNING THE EYES OF MACROPROSOPUS.112. THE eyes of the White Head are diverse from all other eyes. Above the eye is no eyelid, neither isthere an eyebrow over it.113. Wherefore? Because it is written, Ps. cxxi. 4: \"Behold, He that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber norsleep;\" that is, the superior Israel.114. Also it is written, Jer. xxxii. v. 19: \"Whose eyes are open.\" 115. And this is the tradition. Seeing that allis operated through mercies, He hath not covering unto His eye, nor eyebrow above His eye; how little, then;doth the White Head require such.116. Rabbi Schimeon spake unto Rabbi Abba, and said: \"To what is this like?\" He answered unto him: \"Tothe whales and fishes of the sea, which have no coverings for their eyes, nor eyebrows above their eyes; whosleep not, and require not a protection for the eye.117. \"How much less doth the Ancient of the Ancient Ones require a protection, seeing that He far above Hiscreatures watcheth over all things, and all things are nourished by Him, and He Himself sleepeth not.118. \"This is that which is written, Ps. cxxi. 4: 'Behold! He that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber norsleep.' That is, the superior Israel.119. \"It is written, Ps. xxxiii. 18: 'Behold the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear Him;' and it is written,Zech. iv. 10: 'They are the eyes of the Lord, running to and fro throughout the whole earth.120. \"There is no contrariety (between these sayings); one is concerning Microprosopus, and the otherconcerning Macroprosopus.121. \"And further, although there be two eyes, yet they are converted into one eye.122. \"This is pure in its whiteness, and so white that it includeth all whiteness.123. \"The first whiteness shineth, and ascendeth and descendeth for the purpose of combining with thatwhich is connected (with it) in connection.124. \"This is the tradition: That whiteness darteth forth its rays, and igniteth three lights, which are calledHVD, Hod, Glory, VHDR, Vehedar, and Majesty, VChDVH.

Rabbi Schimeon said: Thou hast well spoken, and the Ancient of Days will open this eye upon thee inthe time of thy necessity.129. Another tradition runneth thus: Whiteness in whiteness, and whiteness which includeth all otherwhiteness.130. The first whiteness shineth and ascendeth and descendeth in three lights on the left−hand side, and theyradiate and are bathed in that whiteness, like as when a man batheth his body in good unguents and odours, inbetter than he at first possessed.131. The second whiteness descendeth and ascendeth and shineth in three lights on the right−hand side, andthey radiate and are bathed in that whiteness, like as when a man batheth in good and odours, in better than heat first possessed.132. The third whiteness shineth and ascendeth and descendeth, and goeth forth the light of the innerwhiteness of the brain, and darteth forth its rays when necessary unto the black hair, and unto the head, andunto the brain of the head.133. And it irradiateth the three crowns which remain, when it is needful, so that it may be uncovered, if thatbe pleasing unto the Most Ancient One hidden from all.134. And this is the tradition: This eye is never closed; and there are two, and they are converted into one.135. All is right; there is no left there. He sleepeth hot and slumbereth not, and He requireth not protection.He is not such an one as hath need to defend Himself, for He defendeth all things, and He Himself waitedupon all things, and in the sight of His eye are all things established.136. This is the tradition: Were that eye closed even for one moment, no thing could subsist.137. Therefore it is called the open eye, the holy eye, the excellent eye, the eye of Providence, the eye whichsleepeth not neither slumbereth, the eye which is the guardian of all things, the eye which is the subsistenceof all things.138. And concerning it is it written, Prov. xxii. 9, \"The bountiful eye;\" thou shalt not read \"the blessed eye,\"but \"it blesseth,\" for it is called \"the bountiful eye,\" and by it are all things blessed.139. And this is the tradition: There is no light in the inferior eye, so that it can be bathed in redness andblackness; except when it is beheld by that white brilliance of the superior eye which is called \"the bountifuleye.\" KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER IX.

And unless the bountiful superior eye were to look down upon and bathe the inferior eye, the universecould not exist even a single moment. 143. This is the tradition in the \"Book of Concealed Mystery;\"Providence ariseth from the inferior eye when the highest splendour shineth down upon it, and that highestsplendour goeth forth into the inferior; for from it are all things illuminated.144. This is that which is written, Num. xiv. 14. \"That Thou, O Tetragrammaton! art seen eye to eye.\" Also itis written, Ps. xxxiii. 18: \"Behold the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear Him.\" And it is written, Zech. iv.10: \"The eyes of the Lord running to and fro throughout the whole earth.\"145. \"The eye of the Lord is upon them that fear Him,\" if they be upright. This is the superior eye. On thecontrary, when it is said, \"The eyes of the Lord run to and fro,\" this is the eye which is below.146. This is the tradition: On what account was Joseph worthy, so that the evil eye had no dominion overhim? Because that he was worthy of being beheld by the superior benign eye.147. This is what is written, Gen. xlix. 23: \"Joseph is the son of a fruitful bough; the son of a fruitful boughabove Ayin.\" Why, \"the son of a fruitful bough above Ayin?\" As though to imply, \"because of that eyewhich beheld him.\"148. Also it is written, Prov. xxii. 9: \"The bountiful eye shall be blessed.\" Why? Because it giveth its breadunto the poor.149. Why is it said in the singular number? Come and see. In the eyes which are inferior are a right eye and aleft eye, and they are of two diverse colours.150. But in this instance there is no left eye, and they both ascend in one path, and all are right. And on thataccount is one eye mentioned, and not two.151. And this is the tradition: This eye, which is the eye of observation, is ever open, ever smiling, ever glad.152. Such are not the inferiors, who in themselves have redness, and blackness, and whiteness\u0014three colours;and are not always open, for there are eyelids as a protection over these eyes.153. And concerning this matter it is written, Ps. xliv. 23: \"Awake, O Lord: why sleepest Thou?\" And, 2Kings xii. 16: \"Open Thine eyes, O Lord.\"154. When they are opened, for some are they opened for good, and on some are they opened for evil.155. Woe unto him upon whom it is opened, so that the eye is mingled with redness, and unto whom theredness appeareth, spreading across that eye. Who can escape from it?156. But the Ancient of Days is blessed, presiding over that eye the white brilliance of whiteness, seeing thatalso it is of such whiteness that it endureth all whiteness.157.

This is the tradition: Save in all these instances, the name of the Ancient One is concealed from all, andis not mentioned in the law, save in one place, where Microprosopus sware unto Abraham.160. Like as it is written, Gen. xxii. 16: \"By Myself have I sworn, saith Tetragrammaton.\" (Understand) thatthis is said concerning Microprosopus.161. Also it is written, Gen. xlviii. 20: \"In thee shall Israel bless.\" That is, the superior Israel.16:. Also it is written, Isa. xlix. 3: \"Israel, in whom I will be glorified.\" In these passages the Ancient of Daysis called Israel.163. But we have also stated that the Ancient of Days is called by His name, yet both this (statement) and theother are correct. 164. This is the tradition: It is written, Dan. vii. 9: \"I beheld until the thrones were castdown, and the Ancient of Days did sit.\"165. \"The thrones were cast down.\" What is this? He spake unto Rabbi Yehuda, and said: \"Stand in thy placeand explain these thrones.\"166. Rabbi Yehuda answered: \"It is written (ibid): 'His throne is of fiery flame;' and upon that throne sat theAncient of Days.\"167. \"For what reason? Because thus is the tradition: If the Ancient of Days were not seated upon that throne,the universe could no longer exist before that throne.168. \"When the Ancient of Days sitteth upon that throne, it is subject unto Him. For He who sitteth upon itruleth over it.169. \"But at that time when He departeth from that throne, and sitteth upon another throne, the first throne isoverturned, lest any should rule over it save the Ancient One, who alone can sit upon it.\"170.

What is the (difference) between the Ancient Oneand Microprosopus? Over these nostrils He ruleth; one of which is life, and the other is the life of life.175. This nose is as a mighty gallery, whence His spirit rusheth forth upon Microprosopus, and they call it theGiver.176. And it is thus: The Spirit descendeth; and again the Spirit from hence proceedeth through those nostrils. KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER X.

And from that gallery ariseth the Spirit, and proceedeth from the concealed brain, and at length restethupon King Messiach.180.

Apparently four spirits (are described) here. But we have already said that the Spirit is one; why, then,are three ( others added unto it?). Arise, Rabbi Yosi, in thy place.182. Rabbi Yosi arose and said: \"in the days of King Messiach, one shall not say unto the other, 'Teach methis Wisdom.'183. \"Because it is thus written, Jer. xxxi. 34: 'A man shall no more teach his neighbour, &c., because allshall know Me, from the least of them even unto the greatest of them.'184. \"And in that time shall the Ancient of Days arouse His Spirit which proceedeth from His brain, the mostconcealed of all. 185. \"And when that cometh forth all the inferior spirits are aroused with Her.186. \"And who are they?

There goeth up a smoke through His nostrils, and out of that smoke is a fire kindled.203. When that smoke goeth up, what afterwards followeth? Coals are kindled by it. What is the meaning ofthis, \"by it?\" By that smoke, out of that nose, out of that fire.204. This is the tradition: When Rav Hammenuna the elder wished to offer up his prayer, he said, \"I prayunto the Lord of the nostrils, unto the Lord of the nostrils do I pray.\"205. And this is that which is written, Isa. xlviii. 9: \"In my praise (that is, My nose) will I refrain My nostrilsfor thee.\" In which place the sentence is concerning the Ancient of Days.206. This is the tradition. The size of this nose is so vast that three hundred and seventy−five worlds aresupported by it, which all adhere unto Microprosopus.207. This is the praise of the conformation of the nose.208.

The beard, whose hairs hang down even unto the breast, white as snow; the adornment of adornments,the concealment of concealments, the truth of all truths.

That is the beard of adornment, true and perfect, from the which flow down thirteen fountains, scatteringthe most precious balm of splendour.214. This is disposed in thirteen forms.215. In the first disposition are classed the hairs from above, and it commenceth from that portion of the hairof His head which is above His ears; and descendeth in one tress before the apertures of the ears in the mostperfect equilibrium, even unto the corner of the mouth.216. In the second disposition are classed the hairs from the comer of the mouth, and they ascend even untothe other corner of the mouth in perfectly equated order.217. The third disposition is from midway between the nostrils; beneath those two apertures there goeth fortha certain path, and the hair is wanting in that path; but on either side of and bordering that path it is fuller andin perfect order.218.

In the seventh disposition the hair terminateth, and there are seen two apples in the places of copiousfragrance, beautiful and joyful in aspect, because (in that aspect) is the universe maintained. And this is thatwhich is said, Prov. xvi. 16: \"In the light of the king's countenance is life.\"222. In the eighth disposition a certain tress of hair proceedeth round about the beard, and (the hairs) hangdown equilibrated even unto the chest.223.

The eleventh disposition is, that no hairs are preeminent over other hairs, and they are restored intoperfect proportion.226. The twelfth disposition is that the hairs do not hang over the mouth, and that the mouth is uncovered inevery part, and that the hair surrounding it is beautiful.227.

The beard of ornament of the Ancient of the Ancient Ones, the most concealed of all things, isconfigurated in thirteen dispositions.231. From the two beautiful apples of His countenance is the face of Macroprosopus illuminated; andwhatsoever is white and rosy is found below; it shineth and radiateth from that light.232.

Secret is it and hidden; hidden, yet nothidden; concealed, yet not concealed in its dispositions; known, yet unknown.239. \"The first disposition. We have learned that the single locks and the single hairs do not mutually adhereunto each other; and that the hairs of the beard take their rise from the disposition of the hair (of the head).240. \"This matter is worthy of examination.

Because that all the holinessesof the holinesses of all holinesses depend from that Influx.431. \"And in the Book of the Law, although it is holy, the ten holinesses do not descend, until it be broughtinto the Temple. But after that it is brought into the Temple it is called holy with the ten holinesses.432. \"As in the above instance mention is not made of the Temple save when the ten holinesses are associatedwith it.433. \"Also we have learned that all things depend from that Influx which is (symbolised by) that tress of (hairof the beard) from which all (the other) hairs depend.434. \"Why is this called the Influx (or influence)?

BEHOLD! this have we learned in the \"Book of Concealed Mystery\": that the Ancient of the AncientOnes before that He prepared His conformations (in the equilibrium of balance) formed certain kings,collected certain kings, and gave due proportion unto certain kings; but they only subsisted (for a time) untilHe could expel them; and in that time hath He concealed them.514. This is intimated in those words, Gen. xxxvi. 31: \"And these are the kings which have reigned inADVM, Edom.\" In the land of Edom; that is, in the place wherein all judgments exist.515. But all these subsisted not until the White Head of the Ancient of the Ancient Ones was disposed (in itsordination).516. When this was conformed, He disposed all the inferior conformations, and all the superior and inferiorforms were thus arranged.517. Thence we learn that unless the head (or ruling power, or government) of a nation, whatever form ofgovernment it may happen to be, be first properly constituted, that nation cannot be properly ruled. For if thehead be first disposed aright, then all things can be ordained, but if that be not first disposed aright, neithercan the nation be governed aright.518. The ordering of all things is from the Ancient of Days. For before that He was disposed in Hisconformation, nothing could be ordained, because as yet it was first necessary that Himself should beordained; and all the worlds were desolate.519. Which these words intimate, ibid. 32: \"And there reigned in Edom Bela, the son of Beor.\"520. \"And there reigned in Edom.\" Here is a certain venerable Arcanum hidden; for herein is that placeintimated wherein all the judgments are collected together, and whence they depend.521. \"Bela, the son of Beor.\" This is the tradition. This denoteth the most rigorous judicial decree, for whosecause there are collected together a thousand times a thousand authors of mourning and woe.522. \"And the name of his city is Dinhabah.\" What is DNHBH, Dinhabah?

But when he ascendeth, so that he may be conformed therein, he cannot subsist and he cannotconsist. Wherefore? Because the form of the man is not as yet constituted.524. What is the reason of this? Because the constitution of man containeth all things under this form, and inthat form are all things disposed.525. And because that constitution of Adam was not as yet found, they (the Edomite Kings) could not subsist,nor be conformed, and they were destroyed.526. Have they then been abolished, and are all these included in ( the supernal) man? For truly they wereabolished that they might be withdrawn from form, until there should come forth the representation of Adam.527. But when that form is configurated, they all exist, and have been restored in another condition.529.

Like as it is written, Exod. ii. 23: \"And the King of Egypt died.\" Because he descended from the formercondition wherein he was.531. But after that Adam was constituted they are called by other names, and are mitigated in a permanentcondition through him; and they exist in their place, and are all called by other names and not by their former(appellations).532. Excepting that one concerning whom it is written, Gen. xxxvi. 39: \"And the name of his wife wasMehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.533. For what reason? Because they were not abolished like the others. Wherefore? Because they were maleand female, like as the palm−tree, which groweth not unless there be both male and female.534. And because now they are found male and female, and it is not written concerning them that they diedlike as the others, but remained in a fixed condition.535.

CONCERNING THE SKULL OP MICROPROSOPUS ANDITS APPURTENANCES; NAMELY, CONCERNING THE SUBTLE AIR, ANDTHE FIRE, AND THE DEW.536. THIS is the tradition. When the White Head propounded unto Himself to superadd ornament unto Hisown adornment, He constituted, prepared, and produced one single spark from His intense splendour of light.He fanned it and condensed it (or conformed it).537. And He developed His thought, and extended it in three hundred and seventy directions.538. And the spark subsisted, and waited until the pure air went forth which involved it around; and anultimate extension having been made, He produced a certain hard skull (bounded) on four sides. 539. Andin that pure subtle air was the spark absorbed and comprehended and included therein.540. Dost thou not think therein? Truly it is hidden therein.541. And therefore is that skull expanded in its sides; and that air is the most concealed attribute of theAncient of Days.542. In the spirit which is hidden in that skull there are expanded fire on the one side and air on the other.And the subtle air is whirled about it from this side, and the subtle fire is whirled about it from that side.543. What is the fire in this place? But verily it is not fire, but that splendour which is included in the subtleair, and it shineth in two hundred and seventy worlds.544. And rigour or judgment is found therefrom; and therefore it is called the hard skull. KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XXVII.

Within that skull are nine thousand myriads of worlds, which receive the influx from it, and are at peaceabove it.546.

From the White Head there is a whiteness in it, which entirelycomprehendeth all whiteness.548. But whensoever it remaineth in that head of Microprosopus, there appeareth in it a redness, like as incrystal, which is white, and there appeareth a red colour in the white colour.549. And therefore is it written, Dan. xii. 2: \"And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shallawake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.\" 550. \"To everlasting life.\"Because they are worthy of that whiteness which cometh from Macroprosopus, even from the Ancient ofDays.551. \"To shame and everlasting contempt.\" Because they are worthy of that redness of Microprosopus.552. And all things are contained in that dew as is intimated in these words, Isa. xxvi. 19: \"Because the dewof lights is thy dew\"\u0014where there is a duality of expression.553. And that dew, which distilleth, distilleth daily upon the field of apples, in colour white and red.554. This skull shineth in two colours toward this side and toward that.555. And from that subtle air, from the skull, there are expanded in His countenance one hundred and fiftymyriads of worlds; and therefore is He called Zauir Aphin (or Anpin), Microprosopus, the LesserCountenance.556. But in that time, when there is need, is His countenance expanded and made vast, because He lookethback upon the countenance of the Ancient of the Ancient Ones, from whom is the life of the universe.557. And from that skull there is a place of exit in one place unto those which are below; and they reflect Hislight towards the Ancient of Days, when they ascend in numeration beneath the wand. 558. Therefore is His skull cleft beneath, when (the inferiors) ascend in numeration, and from this cleavage areflection of light ariseth toward the Ancient of Days.CHAPTER XXVIII.

And a thin membrane is placed therein, but not a thick membrane, hidden also as that of the Ancient ofDays.561.

In those fifty gates are contained the fifty days of the law; the fifty years of the jubilee; and the fiftythousand generations wherein the most holy God\u0014blessed be He!\u0014intendeth to restore and commemorate HisSpirit in them.566. From the third cavity there go forth a thousand times a thousand conclaves and assemblies, whereinDOTh, Daath, Knowledge, is contained and dwelleth. 567. And the hollow place of this cavity is placedbetween the other two cavities and all those conclaves are filled from either side.568. This is that which is written, Prov. ii. 4: \"And in knowledge shall the conclaves be filled.\"569. And those three are expanded over the whole body, on this side and on that, and with them doth thewhole body cohere, and the body is contained by them on every side, and through the whole body are theyexpanded and diffused.CHAPTER XXIX. CONCERNING THE HAIR OF MICROPROSOPUS.570. WE have learned that from the skull of His head (i.e., of Microprosopus) hang one thousand times athousand myriad myriads of locks of black hair, and they are intertwined together each to the other, and theyare mingled together.571. But there is no classification made of the locks of hair separately, because pure and impure alike adhereto each other therein, and here (the description above given) mentions both pure and impure together.572. In all those sides which are pure, and in all those which are impure, there are intricate and dense locks ofhair, some of which are soft, some hard.573. And in single locks doth the hair hang down, curls upon curls, which emit flames, and hang down inbeautiful and strong array, like those of a brave hero victorious in war.574. They are excellent as the great and foliated cedars. This is that which is written, Cant. v. 15: \"Excellentas the cedars.\" 575. The curling locks are parted on this side and on that above the head.576. Also we have learned that they remain in curls because they proceed from many fountains of the threecanals of the brain.577. For from the fountain of one cavity of the skull proceedeth the hair, and it becomes curls upon curls(formed), from the fountains proceeding from that cavity.578. From the second cavity there go forth fifty fountains, and from those fountains the hair issueth, and itbecometh curls upon curls, and they are mingled with the other locks.579. From the third cavity there go forth a thousand times a thousand conclaves and assemblies, and fromthem all the hair issueth; and it becometh curls upon curls, and they are mingled with the other locks. KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XXIX. CONCERNING THE HAIR OF MICROPROSOPUS.98"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"580. And therefore are those locks so curling, and all the progeny of them is produced from the three cavitiesof the brain of the skull.58t. And all those curls hang down and are spread over the sides of the ears.532. And therefore is it written, Dan. ix. 18: \"Incline thine ear, O my God, and hear.\"583. And in those curls there are found alike right and left, light and dark, mercy and judgment, andeverything (that hath in itself the qualities of) right and left dependeth thence (from Microprosopus), and notfrom the Ancient One. 584. In the parting of the hair appeareth a certain slender path, which hath a certain connection with that pathof the Ancient of Days, and from that path are divided six hundred and thirteen paths, which are distributedamong the paths of the precepts of the law.585. Like as it is written, Ps. xxv. 6: \"All the paths of Tetragrammaton are mercy and truth unto such as keepHis covenant and His testimony.\"586. We have learned that in the single locks a thousand times a thousand utterances of the speech ofTetragrammaton are found, which depend from the single locks.587. Among them some are hard (rigorous) and some soft ( merciful), as (belonging unto) the Lord of theequilibrium (or, the Lord of mercy, who is an equilibrium between these); and therefore is He(Microprosopus) said to include right and left.CHAPTER XXX. CONCERNING THE FOREHEAD OF MICROPROSOPUS.588. THE forehead of the skull is the inspection of inspection, and it is not uncovered, except in that timewhen it is necessary to visit sinners for the purpose of examining their deeds.589. Also we have learned that when that forehead is uncovered, all the lords of judgment are stirred up, andthe whole universe is brought under judgment.590. Save in that time when the prayers of the Israelites ascend before the Ancient of Days, and entreat mercyfor His children; then is uncovered the forehead of the benevolence of benevolences, and it shineth downupon this (forehead) of Microprosopus, and judgment is quieted.591. Over this forehead there goeth forth a certain portion of hair, which is extended over it from the brain,which produceth the fifty gates (of understanding).592. And when it is expanded, that brow glows with anger; it is the inspector of the sinners of theworld\u0014namely, of those who are shameless in their deeds.593. Like as it is written, Jer. iii. 3: \"And thou hadst the forehead of a woman who is a whore, thou refusedstto be ashamed.\"594. And we have learned that that hair subsisteth not in that part of the forehead; so that it may be uncoveredagainst those who remain steadfast in their iniquities.595. And when the Holy One\u0014blessed be He!\u0014is awakened, that He may be pleased with the just, theCountenance of the Ancient of Days shineth upon the Countenance of Microprosopus, and His forehead ( that KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XXX. CONCERNING THE FOREHEAD OF MICROPROSOPUS.99"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"of Macroprosopus) is uncovered, and illuminateth that forehead (that of Macroprosopus), and then is calledthe rime of benevolence.596. But as often as judgment threateneth, and that forehead of Microprosopus is uncovered, there isuncovered the forehead of the Ancient of the Ancient Ones, and judgment is mitigated and is not exercised.597. We have learned that that forehead is expanded into two hundred thousand rednesses of rednesses,which are contained therein, and are included therein.598. And when the forehead of Microprosopus is uncovered, licence is given unto all those to destroy. Butwhen the forehead of the benevolence of benevolences is uncovered, so that it may shine upon that forehead(of Microprosopus) and upon all those (rednesses ), then are they quieted.599. Also we have learned by tradition: Twenty−four superior judgments are found, and they are all calledNTzChIM, Netzachim, or Victories; howsoever, while (in the arrangement of letters, NTzChIM, the singular)NTZCh, Netzach, is called Victory ( i.e., means that), the neighbouring letters (M and N in NTzChIM ),being permuted, (we obtain NTzChIN singular), MTzCh, Metzach (meaning) forehead.600. Therefore (the same word signifieth) forehead and Victory, which is in the plural victories. And this isthat which is given by tradition: The Victory of victories. And they are in the forehead, but certain amongthem are extended in the body in (certain ) known parts.601. This is the exotic tradition: What is that which is written, 1 Sam. xv. 29: \"Also the Netzach of Israel dothnot lie nor repent, for He is not man that He should repent.\"602. Now have we declared that Arcanum according to its constitution. All that Victory which is expanded inthe body, at that time when the world is to be judged and converted, admitteth repentance, neither executethjudgment if they be converted.603. For what reason? Because the matter resteth in that place which is called Adam, and He may repent.604. But if that Victory be seen and uncovered in that part of the head just spoken of\u0014namely, theforehead\u0014there is neither time nor opportunity for repentance.605. Wherefore? Because it is not that place which is called Adam, for the countenance and the nose are notuncovered, but the forehead alone.606. And in that part\u0014(i.e., the forehead) the whole countenance is not found, for that (forehead) is not calledAdam, and therefore is it said: \"He is not a man that He may repent\" ( i.e., He, HOAVA, H, is not Adam),&c.). So also is it as regardeth the (proportion of) Victory in the other parts of the body ( of Macroprosopus).CHAPTER XXXI. CONCERNING THE EYES OF MICROPROSOPUS.607. The eyes of the head (of Microprosopus) are diverse from all other eyes. There is a shadowy darknesscast by the eyebrows which is (as if it were) painted above the eyes, whence all eyes are overshadowed with adark shade.608. Curling hairs hang down from the curls of the hair which is above them, and mark the form of theeyebrows above the eyes, at the commencement of the forehead.609. And in both (the eyebrows) are contained seven hundred times a thousand lords of inspection who reside KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XXXI. CONCERNING THE EYES OF MICROPROSOPUS.100"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"above the eyelids.610. In the eyelids radiate one thousand four hundred myriads (of hairs), which adhere to the edges and formthe eyelashes; and far above these is the inspection of the eye of the Ancient of Days. 611. And as often as those eyelids (of Microprosopus) are raised, the same eye (i.e., that of Microprosopus)appeareth, just as when the eyes of any man are opened when he awaketh from sleep.612. And (the eyes of Microprosopus) behold the open eye ( of Macroprosopus shining down upon them),and they are rendered brilliant with a certain brilliant whiteness of the good eye (i.e., that of Macroprosopus,because in Him \"all is right\"\u0014i.e., good\u0014and there is no left).613. Like as it is written, Cant. v. 12: \"Washed with milk.\" What is \"with milk?\" With this excellent primalwhiteness. 614. And in that time is there found with Him (i.e., Microprosopus) an intuition of mercy, andtherefore the prayer of the Israelites ascendeth, because His eyes are opened (i.e., those of Microprosopus),and are whitened with that whiteness (of the eye of Macroprosopus).615. Like as it is written, Ps. xliv. 23: \"Awake; why sleepest Thou, O Tetragrammaton? Arise.\"616. And truly as often as His eyes are not open, all the lords of judgment subdue the Israelites, and the othernations have dominion over them.617. But whensoever He openeth His eyes, these are illuminated from the good eye (of Macroprosopus), andmercy is over Israel; and His eye turneth around and executeth vengeance upon the other nations.618. This is that same which is written, Ps. xxxv. 23: \"Awake, and arise.\" \"Awake!\" and (Thine eye) shall beilluminated with that whiteness. \"Arise!\" so that it may exercise judgment upon those who have overcomethem.619. When his eyes are opened they appear beautiful as those of doves; in colour, white, red, and black, andgolden yellow.620. And this eye (otherwise, this whiteness) is not uncovered except when it is looked upon by the good eye,and then all those colours are covered (otherwise, bathed) with this whiteness of the rays.621. From those colours, when they are uncovered, go forth seven eyes of Providence, which issue from theblack of the eye.622. This is that which is said, Zac. iii. 9: \"Upon one stone seven eyes.\"623. What is the \"one stone?\" The black of the eye.624. From the red go forth seven emissaries, who deflect towards the left side, and they flame with fire,which is toward the north side, and they are combined, so that they may be expanded into the world for thepurpose of uncovering the ways of sinners. 625. This is that which is written, Zach. iv. 10: \"Those seven arethe eyes of Tetragrammaton going forth throughout the whole earth.\"626. From the yellow go forth seven pure splendours (otherwise lights), which are turned towards the southside, and they are combined so that they may be extended into the world, towards those ways which arenecessary to be uncovered (otherwise towards those deeds, &c.). KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XXXI. CONCERNING THE EYES OF MICROPROSOPUS.101"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"627. Like as it is written, Job xxxiv. 21: \"Because His eyes are upon the ways of man.\" And when they areilluminated with that whiteness, then they behold all the lords of truth, in order to do good unto the worldbecause of them; and every glance (of those eyes) is benevolent towards Israel.628. But with the red colour He beholded those who are bound; which is intimated in these words, Exod. iii.7: \"In seeing have I seen;\" \"In seeing,\" for the purpose of doing good unto them; \"I have seen,\" that byvindicating them I may deliver them from their afflictors.620. And therefore is it written, Ps. xliv. 24: \"Awake: wherefore sleepest Thou, O Tetragrammaton? Arise!forsake us not for ever.\" \"Awake and arise.\" There are two inspections, two openings, two good things; thereis mercy, there is also vengeance.630. The first colour is red, hidden and inclosed within red; in comparison with it, all other reds do not seemto be (red). 631. Around this red goeth a certain black thread (of colour ), and surroundeth it.632. This second colour is black, like that stone which goeth forth from the abyss once in a thousand yearsinto the great sea. 633. And when that stone goeth forth there cometh a tempest and a storm upon the greatsea and its waters are troubled, and (their motion soundeth as) a voice, and they are heard by the great fishwhich is called Leviathan.634. And this stone goeth forth, and is whirled onward in the current of the sea, and goeth forth thence; andthis, is so great a blackness that beside it all other blacknesses are as nought (otherwise, now it is withdrawnbecause all the other paths are hidden and enshrouded by it).635. And such is the blackness of the black (part of) the eye, which includeth and concealeth all theremaining blacknesses; and about that blackness there is found a certain red thread (of colour) whichsurroundeth that blackness.636. The third colour is the yellow of all yellows, which includeth and concealeth all other yellows, and inthe circumference of that yellow there whirl around two threads (of colour), a red thread on the one direction,and a black thread in another direction; and they surround that yellow colour.637. But when that white brilliance whirleth around it, and the eye flameth with that white brilliance, allthose other colours are not at rest, and are submerged in the lowest depths thereof; the red, the yellow, and theblack are not seen, only that white brilliance alone; which receiveth its light from Him, even from the Ancientof Days.638. And from that (white brilliance) all the inferiors shine, neither is any colour seen save that whitebrilliance alone. And therefore are all the lords of redness and blackness, which are as it were twin (colours),displaced.639. This is the same which is written, Cant. iv. 2: \"Which go up from the washing, which are all twins.\"640. What is this, \"From the washing?\" From that white brilliance of the excellent holy eye; for all are twins,the one (colour) is as the other. 641. But truly doth not he (the author of the Canticles) say that the teeth are each in turn like a shorn flock;and thou sayest that all these are twins? KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XXXI. CONCERNING THE EYES OF MICROPROSOPUS.102"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"642. Nevertheless, the sense is that this whiteness of them is as that whiteness of the eyes (of Microprosopus)when they are made brilliant by the white brilliance of the supernal eye (of Macroprosopus).643. And the just are about to understand and behold that thing in the Spirit of Wisdom.644. Like as it is written, Isa. lii. 3: \"Because they shall see eye to eye.\" When? \"When Tetragrammaton shallbring again Zion.\"645. Also it is written, Num. xiv. 14: \"By whom Thou, O Tetragrammaton! art seen eye to eye:\" and thenthe opening of the eyes is toward good.646. For there is so opening of the eyes toward good, and there is also another (opening of the eyes) towardevil.647. Toward good, like as it is written, Dan. ix. 18: \"Open Thine eyes and behold our desolations, and thecity over which Thy name hath been pronounced.\" Here it is toward good.648. But toward evil, like as it is written, Isa. xxxiii. 20: \"Thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, atabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed.\" Here truly it istoward good and toward evil, because the one existeth not without the other. 649. We have learned it in the\"Book of Concealed Mystery.\" What is this? \"Thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation.\" Is notJerusalem therefore a quiet habitation? Also it is written, Isa. i. 21: \"Justice dwelt therein.\" But in the placewherein justice is found there is not rest, neither is it at peace (otherwise: In the place wherein judgmentdwelleth and is found, this justice is not rest, &c.).650. For verily this is the true interpretation: \"Thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation\" (is thus to beexplained). The habitation is said to be quiet, in respect of the Ancient of Days, who looketh upon those eyes(of Microprosopus).651. For truly His eye is quiet and tranquil; the eye of mercy the eye which altereth not from this aspect untoany other aspect.652. And therefore is it written OINK, (instead of OINIK) \"They shall behold Thine eye:\" not Thine eyes,(seeing OINK is written) without the second I, Yod.653. But how cometh it that it is said Jerusalem, and not Zion? It is properly thus said for the purpose ofsubjugating judgment which was found therein, and for exciting mercy upon it.654. Also have we learned this. It is written, Dent. xi. 12: \"The eyes of Tetragrammaton thy God are upon it,from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.\" This is that which is written: \"Justice dwelttherein;\" because therein are found many most severe judgments, as in all other instances.655. But in the time to come there shall be found therein one eye of mercy (namely) the eye of the Ancient ofDays.656. This is that which is intimated, Isa. liv. 7: \"But with great mercies will I gather thee.\"657. Where, because it is said \"with mercies,\" what is (the meaning of the adjective) \"great\" (used herewith):Assuredly because mercy is duplicated, (namely) the mercy of the Ancient of Days (Macroprosopus), whichis called \"great mercies.\" KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XXXI. CONCERNING THE EYES OF MICROPROSOPUS.103"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"658. And the mercy of Microprosopus, which is called mercies plain and unqualified, seeing that in Himthere are right and left, ( symbolizing the balance of) justice and Mercy. And therefore is it said: \"And ingreat mercies will I gather thee;\" those, namely, of the Ancient of Days.659. This have we learned. In those eyes (of Microprosopus), and in the two colours of them\u0014namely, in thered and in the black\u0014there are said to abide two tears, and when He, even the Holy of the Holy Ones, desirethto have mercy upon the Israelites, then He sendeth down those two tears so that they may grow sweet in the( waters of the) great sea.660. The great sea, which is that of excellent wisdom, so that in that stream (otherwise, white brilliance) andin that fountain they may be cleansed; and they go forth from the great sea, and there is mercy upon theIsraelites.CHAPTER XXXII. CONCERNING THE NOSE OF MICROPROSOPUS.661. WE have learned it in the \"Book of Concealed Mystery.\" The nose of Microprosopus. From the nose isthe countenance known. In this nose is diverse symbolism.662. For it is written, Ps. xviii. 8: \"There went up a smoke out of His nose, and fire out of His mouthdevoured; coals were kindled by it.\"663. \"There went up a smoke out of His nose.\" In this smoke are included both the fire and the burning coals;for there is no smoke without fire, neither fire without smoke. Truly all things result ( herefrom: otherwise,are kindled herein) and go forth from His nose.664. Also we have learned that when these three things are associated together which are included in thatsmoke which issueth from the nose, the nose is lengthened.665. And therein are two colours, for the smoke bloweth and rusheth forth black and red; and they call itAP, Aph, wrath; and ChIMH, Chimah, fervour; and MShChITh, Meshachith, perdition.666. And if thou sayest wrath and fervour, it is well, since it is written, Deut. ix. 19: \"Since I have fearedbecause of wrath and fervour.\" For these are the black and red smoke. But whence is added MShChITh,Meshachith, perdition?667. Because it is written, Gen. xiii. 10: \"Before that Tetragrammaton destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.\" Butthe word ShChTh, Shachith, denoted perdition brought about by burning, kindled fire.668. Also we have learned that there are five GBVRAN, Geboran, severities in this conformation ofMicroprosopus, and they ascend in one thousand and four hundred severities, GBVRAN; and they areextended in His nose, and in His mouth, and in His arms, and in His hands, and in His fingers.669. And therefore is it written, Ps. cvi. 2: \"Who can declare the GBVRVTh, Geburoth, powers ofTetragrammaton?\"670. Hence it is written, \"powers\" Geburoth (in the plural number ); and it is written, 1 Chron. xxix. ii:\"Thine! O Tetragrammaton, are Gedulah and Geburah,\" in the singular (number).671. Assuredly thus have we learned. When all those severities are amalgamated into one, then are theycalled one Geburah, GBVRH. KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XXXII. CONCERNING THE NOSE OF MICROPROSOPUS.104"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"672. And all those powers, Geboran, commence to descend from the nose. And from it depend a thousandtimes a thousand and four hundred myriads in their single (form). 673. And from that smoke which issueth from his nose depend a thousand times a thousand myriads, and fourhundred and five which belong to this (idea of) Severity. For all the severities depend from this nose.674. For it is written, Ps. cxlv. 4: \"From generation unto generation shall they praise thy works, and announcethy GBVRVTh, Geburoth.\"675. And when that GBVRH, Geburah, Strength, commenceth ( to be manifested), all the severities radiatethence, and are sharpened, until they descend in the form of a swift, whirling fire−flaming sword (Gen. iii.24.) 676. It is written, Gen. xix. 13: \"For we will destroy this place.\" Also it is written, Gen. xiii. 10: \"Beforethat Tetragrammaton destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah?\" And again, Gen. xix. 24: \"Tetragrammaton rainedupon Sodom and .\"677. Assuredly thus have we learned: There is no judge over the wicked, but they themselves convert themeasure of Mercy into a measure of judgment.678. But how do they convert it thus? Also it is written, Mal. iii. 6: \"I, Tetragrammaton, change not.\"679. Assuredly as many times as the Ancient of the Ancient Ones and that White Head uncovereth thebenevolence of benevolences, great mercies are found everywhere.680. But when that is not uncovered, all the judgments of Microprosopus are prepared; and in this manner, ifit be permitted us to say so, Mercy becometh judgment; that is, the most Ancient One of all.681. We have learned in Barietha : \"When the Ancient of the Ancient Ones uncovereth the benevolence ofbenevolences, all those lights which are called by a similar name shine, and Mercy is found in all things.\"682. But when that Concealed One of the Concealed Ones is not uncovered, and those lights shine not,judgments are stirred up, and judgment is exercised.683. Who therefore is the cause of that judgment? The benevolence of the benevolences, because it is notuncovered, and therefore do sinners change Mercy into judgment (as regardeth themselves).684. But because this is said, Gen. xix. 24: \"From Tetragrammaton out of heaven,\" it is said concerning ZauirAnpin, Microprosopus.685. And whence is this obtained? Because it is written (in the preceding passage): MN HShMIM, MenHa−Shamayim, out of heaven. (But the word HShMIM Ha−Shamayim, is equivalent to) ASh VMIM, AshVe−Mim, fire and water, Mercy and judgment, in the antithesis of that (condition) wherein no Judgment isfound at all.686. We have learned that this nose (of Microprosopus) is short, and when the smoke commenceth to issuetherefrom, it departeth thence swiftly, and judgment is exercised.687. But what hindereth that nose that it may not produce smoke? The nose of the Ancient and Holy One; forHe is also called before all others ARK APIM, Arikh Aphim, Long of Nose.688. And this is the Arcanum which we have learned: Between the two words, IHVH, IHVH,Tetragrammaton, Tetragrammaton, an accent is interpolated (whensoever these two are found in KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XXXII. CONCERNING THE NOSE OF MICROPROSOPUS.105"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"juxtaposition in Scripture).689. For wheresoever an y name is repeated twice over, a distinction is made (between them), as when it issaid, Gen. xxii. 11, \"Abraham, Abraham;\" also, Gen. xlvi. 2, \"Jacob, Jacob;\" also, 1 Sam. iii. 10, \"Samuel,Samuel;\" where, by the Psiq accent, these pairs of names are distinguished; excepting that place, Exod. iii. 4,\"Moses, Moses,\" where no accent interveneth.690. For what reason? \"Abraham, Abraham,\" Gen. xxii. xx (herein therefore is an accent introduced becausethat) the latter ( of these two names) denoteth that which is perfect, but the former that which is not as yetperfect; for at this time he is perfected with ten temptations, and therefore is the (Psiq) accent interpolated,for. at this time he can hardly be said to be the same man as he was before.691. (When it is said), \"Jacob, Jacob\" (Gen. xlvi. 2), the latter denoteth that which is perfect, the former thatwhich is not as yet perfect; for now the messenger had come to him from his son Joseph, and over him wasthe Schechinah at rest.692. Also, now at this time was perfected in the earth the holy tree, similar unto the Supernal One, in havingtwelve limitations and seventy branches, which were not hitherto completed; and therefore the latterdenoteth that which is perfect, and the former that which is not as yet perfect; whence the accent fallethbetween them.693. In the passage, \"Samuel, Samuel\" (1 Sam. iii. 10), an accent is also interpolated: wherefore? The lattername denoteth that which is perfect; the former that which is not as yet perfect; for now he is a prophet,whereas before this he was not as yet a prophet.694. But when it is said, Exod. iii. 4: \"Moses, Moses,\" no accent is interpolated, because he was perfect fromthe very day of his birth, seeing it is written, Exod. ii. 2: \"And she saw him, that he was good.\"695. So also here between these two names of Tetragrammaton, Exod. xxxiv. 6, the Psiq accent isinterpolated; for the first is indeed a perfect name, but the latter is thoroughly and completely perfect.696. But Moses speaketh thus in the place of judgment, in order that for them he may cause Mercy to descendupon Microprosopus from the Most Holy Ancient One.697. For thus is the tradition. So great was the virtue of Moses that he could make the measures of Mercydescend.698. And when the Ancient One is uncovered toward Microprosopus all things are beheld in the light ofMercy, and the nose is appeased, and fire and smoke issue not therefrom.699. Like as it is written, Isa. xlviii. 9: \"And with my praise will I defer mine anger for thee.\"700. Also we have learned: The nose hath two nostrils. From the one issueth a flaming smoke, and it enterethinto the opening of the Great Abyss.701. And from the other nostril issueth afire which is kindled by its flame; and it floweth into four thousandworlds, which are upon His left side.702. Truly, he who is the cause of war is called the fire of Tetragrammaton, the consuming fire, the firewhich consumeth all other fires. KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XXXII. CONCERNING THE NOSE OF MICROPROSOPUS.106"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"703. And that fire is not mitigated save by the fire of the altar.704. And that smoke which issueth forth from the other nostril is not mitigated unless by the smoke of thesacrifice of the altar. But all things depend from the nose.705. Therefore is it written, Gen. viii. 12: \"And Tetragrammaton smelled a sweet savour.\" For all these areattributed unto the nose, to smell a savour, and to emit smoke and fire, and red colour, and therefore is itopposed unto the benevolence (namely, the forehead ).706. And for that cause is it written, Exod. iv. 14: \"And the anger of Tetragrammaton was kindled.\" Deut. vii.4: \"And the anger of Tetragrammaton will be kindled.\" Exod. xxii. 24: \"And My wrath is kindled.\" Deut. vi.15: \"Lest the wrath of Tetragrammaton be kindled.\" Which are all to be understood concerning Zauir Anpin,or Microprosopus.CHAPTER XXXIII. CONCERNING THE EARS OF MICROPROSOPUS.707. This have we learned. It is written, 2 Kings xix. 16: \"Incline, O God, Thine ear and hear;\" namely, thatear which is hidden beneath the hair, and the hair hangeth down over it, and yet the ear is there for thepurpose of hearing.708. And from the inner part of the ear, elaborated with strongly marked concave formations, like a windingspiral ladder, with incurvation on every side.709. But wherefore with curvings? So that He may hear both good and evil.710. Also we have learned: From that curving part within the ears depend all those Lords of Wingsconcerning whom it is written, Eccles. x. 20: \"For a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and the Lord of theWings shall tell the matter.\"711. Within that ear, (the Spirit) floweth from the three hollow places of the brain into this opening of theears. And from that afflux (the Spirit) the voice departeth into that profound depth (otherwise, incurvation)and is conjoined with (the Spirit) in that distillation, as well good as evil.712. In good: as it is written, Psa. lxix. 33: \"For Tetragrammaton heareth the poor.\" In evil; as it is written,Num. xi. i: \"And Tetragrammaton heard, and His wrath arose, and the fire of Tetragrammaton was kindledagainst them.\"713. And that ear is closed from without, and a depth otherwise an incurvation) proceedeth within that galleryof inspiration from the brain.714. So that the voice may be collected together within, neither issue forth thence, and that it may be guardedand shut in on every side; hence it is in the nature of an Arcanum. 715. Woe unto Him who discloseth secrets! For he who revealeth secrets doth the same thing as if he shoulddeny the superior formation, which is so arranged that the secrets may be collected together, and that theymay not issue forth without.716. Also we have learned in Barietha : At that time when they call aloud in their troubles, and the hairs aremoved from before the ears, the voice entereth into the ears through that channel, and the spirit of distillationfrom the brain (entereth into that that channel likewise).

And in the brain is it collected (otherwise, and it slideth on into the brain), and departeth through thenostrils of the nose, and is bound, and the nose becometh shorter (that of Microprosopus, namely ) andgloweth with fire, and fire and smoke issue forth; and from those nostrils are excited all the severities, andvengeance is exercised.718. Truly before that from those nostrils the fire and smoke issue forth, that voice ascendeth upwards, andslideth into the beginning of the brain; and the two tears flow down from the eyes.719. And by means of that voice the smoke goeth forth, and the fire from the brightness which openeth thosegates; for through that voice which entereth into the ears all these things are excited and urged forth(otherwise, are mingled together).720. And therefore is it written, Num. xi. 1: \"And Tetragrammaton heard, and His wrath was kindled, and thefire of Tetragrammaton was kindled against them.\" For through that hearing of that voice the whole brain isstirred up.721. We have learned. It is written, 2 Kings xix. 16: \"Incline, O my God, Thine ear;\" like as if it should besaid, \"Let six hundred thousand myriads of those wings which depend from those ears be elongated;\" andthey are all called the ears of Tetragrammaton.722. When therefore it is said, \"Incline, O Tetragrammaton, Thine ear,\" (this phrase) \"Thine ear,\" is that ofMicroprosopus.723. From one cavity of the brain do those ears depend; and from the fifty gates which proceed from thatcavity, this is one gate, which extendeth and goeth forth and openeth into that channel of the ear.724. Like as it is written, Job xxxiv. 3: \"Because the ear trieth words.\" Also it is written, Ps. vii. 10: \"And Hetrieth the heart and reins.\"725. And in proportion to the expansion of that cavity of fifty gates which proceedeth into the body, so is thelatter expanded even in that place wherein the heart resideth.726. Therefore concerning the ear it is said that in it is made probation; and also concerning the heart it is saidthat in it is made probation; because that they proceed (alike) from one place.727. We have learned in the \"Book of Concealed Mystery\" that, like as this ear proveth as well the good asthe evil, so all things which are in Microprosopus have part good and part evil, right and left, Mercy andJudgment.728. And this ear is contiguous unto the brain; and because it is contiguous unto the brain, hence that voice isdirected into a cavity which entereth into the ear.729. Therefore concerning the ear it is called hearing; but in this hearing, Binah, the Understanding (the thirdSephira) is comprehended; for, also, to hear, is the same as to understand, because that thereby allexaminations are examined together.730. And those words of the Lord of Lords are given forth so that they may be heard, so that they may bemeditated upon and be understood.731. Come, behold I it is written, Hab. iii. 1: \"Tetragrammaton!

This passage hath this meaning: When that holy prophet heard and understood and knew, and wasoccupied with those conformations, it is written: \"I was afraid.\" Rightly was it (so written) that he should beafraid and be broken before Him, for these words are said concerning Microprosopus.733. When further he understood and knew, what is then written? \"O Tetragrammaton! revive Thy work inthe midst of the years.\" But concerning the Ancient of Days is this said.734. And in every passage wherein is found Tetragrammaton, Tetragrammaton, with Yod He twice, or withAleph Daleth and Yod He, the one belongeth unto Microprosopus, and the other unto the Ancient of theAncient Ones. For because all these things are one certain thing, hence by one name are they called.735. Also we have learned. When is the full name expressed? When it is written, IHVH ALHIM,Tetragrammaton Elohim. For that is the full name of the Most Ancient of all, and of Microprosopus; andwhen joined together they are called the full name. But other forms are not called the full name, like as wehave established.736. When it is said, Gen. ii. 8: \"And Tetragrammaton Elohim planted,\" &c., the name is given in full, wherethe discourse is concerning the planting of the garden; and whensoever Tetragrammaton Elohim occurreth thefull name is expressed.737. In IHVH IHVH all things generally are comprehended, and then mercies are stirred up over all things.738. (When it is said) \"O Tetragrammaton! revive Thy work in the midst of the years,\" concerning theAncient of Days is it said. 739. What is \"Thy work\"? Zauir Anpin, Microprosopus.740. \"In the midst of years.\" These are the former years, which are called IMI QDM, Yemi Qedem, formerdays; and not years, OVLM, Olahm, or of the world.741. The former years are the former days; the years of the world are the days of the world. 742. And here (it is said): \"In the midst of the years.\" What years? The former years.743. \"Revive it.\" Concerning whom is it said, \"Revive it\"? Concerning Microprosopus. For all His splendouris preserved by those years, and therefore is it said, \"Revive it.\"744. \"In wrath remember mercy.\" He looketh to that supernal benignity wherein mercies are excited over all;(those mercies) who desire compassion, and to whom mercy is owing.745. We have learned, Rabbi Schimeon said: \"I call to witness the heavens which are above me, towards allthose who stand around, that great joy ariseth in all the worlds because of these words.746. \"Also these words excite joy in my heart; and in the veil of excellent expansion are they hidden and dothey ascend; and He, the Most Ancient One of all, preserveth them, He, the Concealed and Hidden of all.747. \"And when we began to speak my companions know not that all these words therein were worthy hereofin any degree.748. \"O how blessed is your portion, companions of this conclave! and blessed is my portion with you in thisworld, and in the world to come!\" KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XXXIII.

RABBI SCHIMEON commenced and said, Deut. iv 4: \"And ye shall cleave unto Tetragrammaton yourGod,\" &c.750. What nation is so holy as Israel? for it is written concerning them, Deut. xxxiii. 29: \"Blessed art thou, OIsrael! who is like unto thee?\" Because that they are applied unto God in this world through the holy name.751. And in the world to come more than here, for therein shall we never be separated from that conclavewherein the just are assembled.752. And this is that which is written: \"And ye shall cleave in Tetragrammaton;\" for it is not written\"ChDPQIM LIHVH, Chedebeqim Le Tetragrammaton, Ye shall cleave unto Tetragrammaton;\" but \"BIHVH,Be Tetragrammaton, in Tetragrammaton,\" properly.753. We have learned this. There is a descent from the beard which is venerable, holy, excellent, hidden andconcealed in all (the beard, namely, of Macroprosopus), through the holy magnificent oil, into the beard ofMicroprosopus.754. And if thou shalt say that this beard is not to be found, for that even Solomon only spake of the cheeks, but not at all of the beard.755. Truly thus have we learned (we make answer) in the \"Book of Concealed Mystery.\" It is that which ishidden and recondite, and of which mention is not made, neither is it uncovered; it is that which is venerableand excellent before all things, seeing that it is Concealed and hidden.756. And since the beard is the praise and perfection and dignity of the whole countenance, in these sacredthings it is found to be hidden, neither is it discerned.757. And that beard is the perfection and beauty of the countenance in Microprosopus. In nine conformationsis it disposed.758. But when the venerable beard of the Ancient of the Ancient Ones shineth upon this beard ofMicroprosopus, then the thirteen fountains of excellent oil flow down upon this beard.759. And therein are found twenty−two parts, and thence extend the twenty−two letters of the holy law.760. Also we have learned that this beard departeth from His ears, and descendeth and ascendeth, andtoucheth upon the places of fragrance.761. What are the places of fragrance? Like as it is said, Cant. v. 13: \"Like a bed (singular) of spices,\" andnot \"beds\" (plural ).762. But this beard of Microprosopus is disposed in nine conformations.763. And also the hairs being black, and in careful order, like a handsome man, as it is written, Cant. v. 15:\"Excellent as the cedars.\"764. The first conformation. The hair is conformed from the portion which is above, and there goeth forththerefrom a spark which is of most intense brilliance; and it goeth forth from the Absolute of the pure ether,and passeth beneath the hair of the head, even beneath those locks which are above the ears; and it KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XXXIV. CONCERNING THE BEARD OF MICROPROSOPUS.110"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"descendeth in front of the opening of the ears, hair above hair, even unto the beginning of the mouth.765. The second conformation. The hair goeth forth, and ascendeth from the one part of the mouth even untothe other part of the opening of the mouth; and it descendeth beneath the mouth unto the other side, hairabove hair, in beautiful arrangement.766. The third conformation. From the midst, beneath the nose, and beneath the two nostrils, there goeth fortha certain path, and short and coarse hairs fill up that path; and the remaining hairs fill up the place from thisside unto that, around this path.767. But this path is not clearly seen (to be continued) below (the mouth), but only the upper part of it whichdescendeth even unto the beginning of the lips, and there is this path applied.768. The fourth conformation. The hair goeth forth and is disposed in order, and ascendeth, and is spreadover His cheeks, which are the place of fragrance of the Ancient One.769. The fifth conformation. The hair is wanting, and there are seen two apples on this side and on that, red asa red rose, and they radiate into two hundred and seventy worlds, which are enkindled thereby.770. The sixth conformation. The hair goeth forth as in a tress about (the border of) the beard, and hangethdown even unto the commencement of the vital organs, but it descendeth not unto the parts about the heart.771. The seventh conformation. That the hairs do not hang over the mouth, but that the mouth is uncoveredon every side, and that the hairs are disposed in order about it.772. The eighth conformation. That the hairs descend beneath the beard, and cover the throat, so that itcannot be seen; all those hairs are slender, hairs above hairs, plentiful in every part.773. The ninth conformation. That the hairs are mingled together with those which are joined unto them; andthat they all are in equality from the cheeks even unto those hairs which hang down; all are in fair equality,like a brave man, and like a hero victorious in war.774. Through these nine conformations there proceed and flow down nine fountains of magnificent oil, andthese indeed flow down from that magnificent supernal oil (of the heard of Macroprosopus) into all thoseinferiors.775. Those nine conformations are found in form herein (otherwise, in this beard); and in the perfection ofthe conformation of this beard is the inferior son of man called the brave man. 776. For whosoever seeth (in sleep) that his beard existeth in proper form, in him is found courage andstrength.777. Rabbi Schimeon spake unto Rabbi Eleazar, his son, and said: \"Arise, O my Son, and expound the partsof the holy beard in its conformations.\"778. Rabbi Eleazar arose, and commenced and said, Ps. cxviii. 5: \"'I called upon IH, Yah, in my distress; Yahheard me at large. Tetragrammaton is on my side, I will not fear; what can man do unto me? Tetragrammatontaketh my part with them that help me, and I shall see my desire upon mine enemies.

But what was the necessity forso doing? Because that he said: 'All nations compassed me about.' For in this disposition of those nineconformations which are the name of IHVH, Tetragrammaton , are they cut off from the earth.782. \"This is that same which is written: 'In the name of IHVH will I destroy them.'783. \"Also this have we learned in the 'Book of Concealed Mystery.' David hath here enumerated the nineconformations; of which six consist in the holy name, for there are six names; and there are three in theword ADM, Adam, or man.784. \"And if thou shalt say that there are only two (in the word Adam), assuredly there are three, because alsothe princes pertain unto the idea of the word Adam. 785. \"This have we learned.

The Holy Name; because it is written, Gen. ii. 7: 'AndIHVH ALHIM, Tetragrammaton Elohim, created ADM, Adam, Man,' with the full Name, which is IHVHALHIM, analogous to him (Adam), seeing that IHVH, Tetragrammaton, denoteth the masculine, andALHIM, Elohim, the feminine. 796. \"And therefore in this passage there is no mention made of ADM, Adam, Man, without the Holy Name.797. \"Also we have learned this.

It is thus, as we havelearned by tradition: All those sacred diadems of the King, when He is conformed in his dispositions (thatis, when the letters of Tetragrammaton are all conjoined together), are called ADM, Adam, Man, which is theForm which comprehendeth all things.800. \"But when any portion is taken away therefrom (that is to say, when it is said IH, and not IHVH), then isunderstood ( Microprosopus) the Holy Name (by the letter I, Yod) and ThORA, Tauara, or the Gate (that is,the Bride, to whom is attributed the name ADNI, Adonai, whose number when written in its Plenitude is671, as the word ThORA or ThROA exhibiteth it, summed up in the letter H, He, of the name IH), and thatwhich is therein.801. \"When therefore it is called Tetragrammaton, man is mentioned, with the Gate Tauara included, andthose which are therein [otherwise, concerning the inferior worlds.

Rabbi Yehudah answered and said: \"'Icalled upon Yah in my distress.' From the part where the beard beginneth to extend, which is from the moreremote part (is one), before the ears, beneath the hair (is the second). And therefore is it twice said, IH, IH.816. \"But in that place wherein the beard is expanded, and descendeth before the ears, in wider extension, thename of ADM, Adam , Man, hath place (that is to say, the complete Tetragrammaton). Also this expansionwas necessary to David when he wished to subject to himself the Icings and nations through the dignity ofthis beard. (Otherwise, when therefore he saith, 'Tetragrammaton is on my side, I will not fear;' for this issuch a one who spareth not the wicked, and this was altogether necessary, &c.)817. \"Also we have learned this in the 'Book of Concealed Mystery' : Whosoever seeth in his sleep that hetoucheth the beard or moustache of the supernal man with his hand, or extendeth his hand unto it, let himknow that he is at peace with the supernals, and that those who afflict him are about to be subjected untohim.\" 818. \"We have learned that the supernal beard is disposed in nine conformations, and that it is the beard ofMicroprosopus..CHAPTER XXXV. CONCERNING THE FIRST PART OF THE BEARD OFMICROPROSOPUS.819. \"IN the first conformation the hair is disposed from above, and goeth forth before the opening of theears, beneath the locks which hang down over the ears; and the hairs descend, hairs above hairs, even untothe beginning of the mouth.820. \"This have we learned. All those hairs which are in the beard are harder than all the hairs of the locks ofthe hair of the head. But the hair of the head is longer and bendeth more easily, while these hairs (of thebeard) are not so long.821. Of the hairs of the head some are hard and some are soft.822. And whensoever the white locks of the Ancient of Days reach forward into Microprosopus, it is writtenthat, Prov. i. 20: 'Wisdom crieth without.'823. \"What is this (word) 'without'? In this (instance) in Microprosopus, wherein are conjoined the two(forms of the) brain. Two forms of the brain, sayest thou? But it should rather be said, four forms of the brain.824.

Also we have learned: From the Wisdom which is comprehended in the Quaternary the hairs flow down,which hang in curls upon curls, and all are strong and close, and they extend and flow down singly each in itsown direction.833. \"And so many thousand thousand myriads of myriads depend from them that they are innumerable.834. \"This is that same which is written, Cant. v. 11: 'His locks are bushy, ThLThLIM, Teltelim,' as if it wereThLI ThLIM, curls heaped upon curls.835. \"And all are strong and close (fit) for breaking ( whatsoever is opposed to them), hard as the rock, and ashardest stone.836. \"Until they can make openings in the skull, and the fountains can flow down beneath the locks, thosestrong fountains flow forth in separate directions, and in separate ways.837. \"And because those locks are black and obscure, it is written, Job xii. 22: 'He discovereth deep thingsout of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.'838. \"Also we have learned that those hairs of the beard are so much harder than those hairs of the head,because these alone make themselves so prominent, and are easily found, and are hard in their paths. 839. \"Wherefore sayest thou that they are hard?

Those which symbolizemercies necessarily must be hard in order to divert the course of Judgment.842. \"And all those which denote Judgment, are also firm; and therefore it is necessary in every instance thatthey should both be hard. 843. \"When the Universe hath need of Mercy, mercies are strong, and prevail overJudgment; but when it requireth Judgment, Judgment is strong, and prevaileth over Mercy; and therefore is itnecessary that in each instance they should be firm and strong.

Also we have learned that in those internal parts are comprehended six hundred thousand Lords ofMercies, and that they are called the Lords of the Internal Parts.959. Whence it is written, Jer. xxxi. 20: \"Therefore My bowels are troubled for him, I will surely have mercyupon him, saith Tetragrammaton.\"960. We have learned that this Tiphereth, Beauty, embraceth Mercies and Judgment, and that Mercy isextended in the Male.961. And it passeth over and goeth through unto (otherwise, shineth on) the other side, and formeth theinternal parts of a Woman on the side of Judgment; and thus also are Her internal parts disposed.962.

All which pertain unto Judgment, cohere in Judgment around the hinder part, where the Woman isextended; and they coalesce and are extended round about on that side.964. Also we have learned that five nakednesses can be revealed on that side, which are the five judgmentsand these five judgments are extended into 248 paths. 965. And thus have we learned: the voice in the Woman is uncovered; the hair in the Woman is uncovered;the leg in the Woman is uncovered; the hand in the Woman is uncovered; the foot in the Woman isuncovered.966. And also, furthermore, concerning these two our companions have not inquired, yet them two have morenakedness.967.

And therefore in all the crowns (the former state of things ) was not permanent, before that theconformations of the King were prepared by the Ancient of the Ancient Ones, so that He might constructthe worlds, and form (their) conformations, for the purpose of establishing that Woman, so that She mightbe mitigated.983. Until the supernal Benignity could descend, and then the conformations of the Woman becamepermanent, and were mitigated by this member (of Microprosopus), which is called the Benignity.984. This is that which is written, Gen. xxxvi.: \"And these are the kings which reigned in the land of Edom;\"which is the place where all the judgments are found, and they are the constitutions of the Woman.985. For it is not written, \"Who were,\" but \"Who reigned,\" because they were not mitigated until all wereformed, and that Benignity went forth.986.

And they are perfected in three members in the right arm, and in threemembers in the left arm.1001. The three members of the right arm correspond to the three members of the left arm.1002. And therefore is mention only made of the one arm. For of the arms there is only made mention of thaton the right side; but in Exod. xv. 6 it is called, \"Thy right hand, O Tetragrammaton!\"1003.

Also, we have learned that unto this right hand adhere three hundred and fifty thousand myriads(otherwise, which are called the right hand, and one hundred and eighty−five thousand myriads) from thearm, which is called the arm of Tetragrammaton.1016. Therefore, from either side is the arm (i.e., it is either the right arm or the left arm), because that it issaid (to be) on either side of Tiphereth. 1017. For it is written, Isa. lxiii. 12: \"That led Moses to his right hand, by the arm of his Tiphereth.\"1018. The first expression denoteth the right; but the \"arm\" denoteth the left; for it is written, \"by the arm ofhis Tiphereth,\" one (side) with the other (i.e., right and left).1019.

For if they be benevolent, it is called the right hand ofTetragrammaton, and the hand is included in the arm, and is for aid, and is called the hand; and if, on theother hand, it be not so, the inferior hand of Tetragrammaton is (to be understood).1025. We have learned that when the severe judgments are excited so that they may descend into the world,that then it is written, Ps. xxv. 14: \"The Arcanum of Tetragrammaton is over those who fear Him.\"CHAPTER XLII. CONCERNING THE SEPARATION OF THE MASCULINEAND THE FEMININE, AND CONCERNING THEIR CONJUNCTION.1026. ALSO we have learned in the \"Book of Concealed Mystery\" that all the judgments which arise fromthe Masculine are vehement in the commencement, and relax in the termination; but that those which arefound to arise from the Feminine are relax in commencement, and vehement in termination.1027. And were it not that they could be conjoined, the world could not suffer them; whence the Ancient ofthe Ancient Ones, the Concealed by all things, separateth the one from the other, and associateth themtogether so that at once they may be mitigated.1028. And when He wisheth to separate them He causeth an ecstasy ( or trance, cf. Gen. ii. 21) to fall uponMicroprosopus, and separateth the Woman from His back.1029. And He conformeth all Her conformations, and hideth Her even unto Her day, on which She is ready tobe brought before the Male.1030. This is that which is said, Gen. ii. 21: \"And Tetragrammaton Elohim caused a deep sleep to fall uponAdam, and he slept.\"1031. What is this, \"And he slept?\" This is that which is written, Ps. xliv. 24: \"Awake! wherefore sleepestthou, O Tetragrammaton?\"1032. And He taketh away one of his sides. What is this one? This is the Woman.1033. And She is taken away and conformed; and in Her place is inserted Mercy and Benignity. 1034. Likeas it is said: \"And he hath shut up flesh before her.\" Ezek. xxxvi. 26: \"And I will take away from you thestony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.\"1035. And when He wisheth to introduce the Sabbath, then did He create the spirits, and the malignantdemons, and the authors of disturbance; neither at first did He finish them, until the Mother could come intoHer formation, and could sit before Him.

When She could sit before Him, He ceased from those creatures, and they were not completed becausethe Mother sat before the King, and they were associated together face to face.1037. Who shall enter between Them? Who shall stir up war between Them mutually?1038. Because the Arcanum of the matter is hidden in the time of the disciples of wisdom, who know ourArcanum, from Sabbath unto Sabbath.1039. And when they are associated together, then are They mutually mitigated in that day on which allthings are mitigated. And therefore are the judgments mitigated mutually and restored into order, bothsuperiors and inferiors.CHAPTER XLIII. CONCERNING THE JUDGMENTS.1040. ALSO, we have learned in the \"Book of Concealed Mystery\" that when the Most Holy Ancient Onedesired to see whether the judgments could be mitigated, and whether these two could adhere together, thatthen from the side of the Woman there went forth a vehement judgment, which the world could not bear. 1041 Whence it is written: \"And Adam knew Eve his wife\" (Gen. iv. 1). And she conceived and brought forthQIN, Qain, and said: \"I have acquired a man with Tetragrammaton.\"1042. And She was not perfect, because She had not been mitigated, and the powerful serpent had transmittedunto Her the pollution of severe judgment; and therefore She could not be mitigated.1043. When therefore this man Qain proceeded from the side of the Woman, he went forth rigorous andsevere; severe in his judgment, rigorous in his judgment.1044. But when he had gone forth, She Herself became thereafter weaker and more gentle. And there wentforth another and gentler birth.1045. And the former one was removed, which was so vehement and rigorous that all the judgments couldnot be mingled together before Her.1046. Come and see. What is written? \"And it came to pass when they were both in the field.\" \"In the field,\"which is known to be the supernal (field); \"in the field,\" which is called the field of the apple−trees.1047. And this judgment hath conquered his brother because he is stronger than he, and hath subdued him,and hath concealed him in his own power.1048. Then therefore, that Holy God was stirred up regarding this\u0014may His Name be blessed!\u0014and took himaway from the midst before him, and placed him in the mouth of the Great Abyss.1049. And enclosed his brother by immersion in the Great Sea, so that he might temperate the supernal tears.1050. And from them men descend in the world according to their path.1051. And although they are concealed, yet are they extended mutually in themselves and from one body.1052. And from that body descend the souls, NShMThHVN, of the impious, of the sinners, and of thehardened in spirit. 1053. From them both at once, dost thou think? No but one floweth down from the oneside, and another from the other. KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XLIII. CONCERNING THE JUDGMENTS.128"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"1054. Blessed are the just, whose NShMThHVN, souls, are drawn from that Holy Body which is calledAdam, which includeth all things; the place, as it were, wherein all the Crowns and Holy Diadems areassociated together, arrayed in the equilibrium of balance.1055. Blessed are the just, because all these are holy words which are sent forth through the Supernal HolySpirit, the spirit wherein all the Holy Ones are comprehended; the spirit in whom the supernals and inferiorsare collected together (otherwise, whom the supernals and inferiors hear).1056. Blessed are ye, O Lords of Lords, Reapers of the Field, who know and contemplate those words, andknow well your Lord, face to face, and eye to eye; and through those words worthy in the world to come.1057. This is that very thing which is written, Deut. iv. 38: \"Know therefore this day, and consider it in thineheart, that Tetragrammaton, He is Elohim (HVA HALHIM), in the heavens above, and upon the earthbeneath: there is none other.\"1058. Where Tetragrammaton is the Ancient of Days. Hoa Ha−Elohim , that is the One, blessed be His Namefor ever, and unto the Ages of the Ages.CHAPTER XLIV. FURTHER REMARKS CONCERNING THE SUPERNALMAN.1059. RABBI SCHIMEON spake, and said: Let us behold. The superiors are below, and the inferiors areabove. 1060. The superiors are below. That is the form of the Man which is the Universal SuperiorConformation.1061. We have learned this which is written, \"And the just man is the foundation, ISVD, Yesod, of theworld,\" Prov. x. 25, because He comprehendeth the Hexad in one enumeration. 1062. And this is that which is written, Cant. v. 15: \"His legs are as columns, ShSh, Shesh, of the NumberSix.\" 1063. We have learned in the \"Book of Concealed Mystery\" that in man are comprehended the SuperiorCrowns in general and in special; and that in man are comprehended the Inferior Crowns in special and ingeneral.1064. The Superior Crowns in general (are comprehended in) the figure of all those conformations, as hathbeen already said.1065. (The Superior Crowns) in special (are comprehended ) in the fingers of the hands, which are ChMShKNGD ChMSh, Chamesh Ke−Neged Chamesh, Five over against (or opposed to, or chief above) Five. 1066. The Inferior Crowns (are comprehended in) the toes of the feet, which are special and general.1067. For the body is not seen with them, seeing they are extraneous to the body. And therefore they are notin the body, seeing the body hath receded from them.1068. For if so, what is this, Zach. xiv. 4: \"And His feet shall stand in that day?\" Truly the feet of the body,the Lords of Judgments to exercise vengeance.1069. And they are called the Lords of the Feet; and certain of them are powerful, and the Lords of the KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XLIV. FURTHER REMARKS CONCERNING THE SUPERNAL MAN.129"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Judgments, who are below, adhere unto the inferior crowns.1070. We have learned that all those superior conformations which are in the Holy Body, in the Male and inthe Female, which ( arrangement of Male and Female) is the proper ordering (of the Form) of the man, arededuced from themselves by turns, and that by turns they adhere each to its (order of deviation): and that byturns they flow down into themselves (i.e., the duplicate Male and Female join).1071. Like as the blood floweth through the passages of the veins\u0014now through one, now through another;now hither, now thither; from one place into another place.1072. And those interior portions of the Body bind themselves together by turns until all the worlds areilluminated, and receive benediction because of them.1073. We have learned that all those Crowns which are not comprehended in the Body are all far distant andimpure, and pollute whom they are permitted\u0014whosoever, namely, cometh near unto them so that he maylearn anything from them.1074. This have we learned. Wherefore, then, is there so great a desire for them among the Disciples ofWisdom? For no other reason than that they (the Crowns which are impure) should approach that Holy Body,and that thus perchance through them (the Disciples of Wisdom) they (the impure Crowns) may seek to becomprehended in that Body. 1075. But if thou sayest that if it be so, surely the Holy Angels also are notincluded in the comprehension of the Body.1076. Most assuredly it is not so in the least. For if, He being absent from them, there were Holy Oneswithout the conformative arrangement of the Body, surely (He being absent from them) they could neither(continue to) be holy, nor to subsist.1077. And nevertheless it is written, Dan. x. 6: \"And his body like as ThRShISh, Tarshish;\" also, Ezek. x. 12:\"And their backs full of eyes;\" also, Dan. ix. 21: \"The man Gabriel.\" All these passages refer to the analogyof the Man.1078. Those being accepted which exist not in the ordered arrangement of the Body; for those are impure,and pollute him\u0014namely, whosoever shall approach unto them.1079. Also, we have learned that these are found to proceed from the spirit of the left side, which is notmitigated in human form; and they have gone out from the ordered arrangement of the Holy Body, neither dothey adhere unto it.1080. And therefore are they all impure, and they wander to and fro, and fly through the world.1081. And they are entered into the mouth of the Great Abyss, so that they may adhere unto that formerjudgment which had gone forth from the ordered arrangement of the Body, and which is called the InferiorQain.1082. And they wander to and fro, and fly up and down, through the whole world, being carried abroad hitherand thither; and they adhere not in the Syntagma of the Body.1083. And therefore are they without, and impure, among all the hosts above and below; like as it is written,Lev. xiii. 46: \"And his habitation shall be without the camp.\" 1084. But from the Spirit which is called Abel,which hath been more mitigated in the Syntagma of the Holy Body, others go forth who have been moremitigated, and can adhere unto the body, but cannot completely be inherent within it.

They all hang in the air, and go forth from this genus of those Impure Ones, and bear whatsoever maybe said above and below; and concerning them they have knowledge who have spoken concerning them.1086. Also, this is the tradition in the \"Book of Concealed Mystery.\" When the Syntagma of the SupernalMan had been mitigated as to the Holy Body, in Male and Female form, these two were conjoined togetheragain for the third time. 1087. And the temperation of all things proceeded therefrom, and the superior and inferior worlds weremitigated.1088. And thenceforth the superior and inferior worlds are bound together under the form of the Holy Body,and the worlds are associated together, and cohere together, and have been made one Body. 1089. And since all things are one Body, the Schechinah Superior, the Schechinah Inferior\u0014that Holy One,may His be blessed above! that Holy One, may He be blessed below!\u0014hence is His Spirit drawn forth, andShe entereth into the One Body, and in all things there appeareth nothing but the Unity.1090. QDVSh, QDVSh, QDVSh, IHVH TzBAVTh; Qadosh, Qadosh, Qadosh, Yod He Vau He Tzabaoth;Holy, holy, holy, Tetragrammaton of the Hosts! the whole earth is full of Thy glory, for all things are ThyOne Body.1091. We have learned that because the one hath been tempered by the other, hence it is written, Cant. i. 11:\"We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.\" For judgment and mercy are connected together(otherwise, judgment is tempered through mercy), and She is mitigated by Him.1092. And therefore She ascendeth not without Him, like as with the palms; one sex ariseth not without theother.1093. And therefore have we learned by tradition that if any one in this world cutteth himself off from therace of mankind, he hereafter, when he quitteth this world, shall not enter into the Syntagma of mankind,which is called the Holy Body; but (shall enter) among those who are not called mankind, so that he shall goforth from the Syntagma of the Body.1094. We have learned in exotic tradition that this is the sense of \"We will make the borders of gold withstuds of silver\" (Cant. i. 11), that judgment is mitigated through mercy, so that there can be no judgment inwhich mercy is not found.1095. And therefore it is written, ibid. 10: \"Thy cheeks are beautiful in their outlines, and thy neck in pearls.\"1096. \"In outlines (or borders),\" as it is written: \"He will make thee borders of gold.\"1097. \"In pearls,\" answering to that which is written \"With studs of silver.\"1098. \"Thy neck\" involveth the perfection of the Woman. This is found to be the habitation of the Sanctuaryabove, but the Jerusalem below.1099. And all this is after that She is mitigated through the Male, and They twain are become one being, eventhe Syntagma of Truth.1100. What is this Truth? Wherein is found all Truth?

If any one be called Adam, and his soul ( Neschamah) goeth from him, and hedieth, it is forbidden to leave him in his abode so that he should abide upon the earth.1102. On account of the honour of that Body wherein no corruption can appear.1103. For it is written, Ps. xlix. 13: \"Man (Adam) shall not abide in honour;\" that is, Adam, who is moreworthy that all honour, shall not abide.1104. Wherefore? Because if it were thus, he would be like unto the beasts (BHMVTh, Behemoth) whichperish.1105. In what manner is it with the beast? He is not in the race of Adam, neither is he able to receive the HolySpirit (RVChA QDIShA), for thus also would he be like unto the beast were his body without the Spirit,when at the same time that body (of his), which is the most honourable of all (bodies, seeing it is the image ofthe Supernal), is not meet to be associated with those things which are ignominious.1106. Also we have learned in the \"Book of Concealed Mystery,\" that were any one permitted to remain insuch (image of the) Holy Body, and yet without the Spirit (Ruacha), there would be a void in the Body of theWorld.1107. For assuredly, therefore, it could not be permitted unto him that he should abide in the holy place, inthat earth wherein justice abideth. (Otherwise: Under the command of the Holy Crown, Kether , of the King,Microprosopus, in the earth, concerning which it is written, Isa. i. 21, \"Justice abideth in Her.\")1108. Since that venerable Body is the Form of the King; but if it were thus permitted to remain, then itwould be counted as one of the beasts. (Otherwise: Since this venerable Body is called the Form of the King,and if it were thus left abiding, it would be like as the beast.) Therefore is it said, \"Like unto the beasts whichperish.\"1109. We have learned this which is written, Gen. vi. 2: \"And the sons of the Elohim beheld the daughters ofAdam.\" These (sons of the Elohim) are they who were withdrawn, and who fell into the mouth of the GreatAbyss. 1110. \"The daughters of Adam.\" (Here it is to be. noted that it is written HADM, Ha−Adam, the initial beingdemonstrative and emphatic, signifying) of that especial Adam.1111. And it is written: \"And they came in unto them . . . the same were mighty men, who were from theEarth,\" &c. From that place, namely, which is called the earth, like as the tradition is concerning the phraseIMI OVLM, Yemi Olahm, the day of the world.1112. The impurities of the Name. From them have gone forth the Spirits, RVChIN, Ruachin, and theDemons, ShDIN, Shedin, into the world, so that they may adhere unto the wicked.1113. \"There were HNPILIM, Ha−Nephilim, Giants, BARTz, Be−Aretz, in the earth;\" for the restraining ofthose who were left, who existed not in the earth.1114. Those giants are OZA, Auza, and OZAL, Auzael, who were in the earth, the sons of the Elohim werenot in the earth. And this is an Arcanum, and all these things are said.1115. It is written, Gen. vi. 6: \"And it repented Tetragrammaton that He had formed Adam in the earth;\" i.e.,for the restriction of the Supernal Adam, who is not in the earth.

And Tetragrammaton said: \"I will destroy the Adam whom I have created, from off the face ofHADMH, Ha−Adamah, the Earth,\" &c., for the restriction of the Adam, who is supernal.1120. And if thou sayest that the Inferior Adam is alone to be understood, it is to be known that these cannotaltogether be opposed, seeing that the one existeth not without the other.1121. And unless Chokmah, Wisdom, could be hidden from all, all things could be conformed like as fromthe beginning.1122. Hence it is said, Prov. viii. 12: \"ANI ChKMH, Ani Chokmah , I, Wisdom, have dwelt with Prudence;\"read it not ShKNThI, Shekenethi, I have dwelt; but ShIKNTnI, Shikeneth−i, My Shechinah or my Presence.1123.

Also it is written, Gen. vi. 8: \"And Noah found grace in the eyes of Tetragrammaton.\"1125. Also we have learned that all brains depend from this brain ( supernal).1126. And Chokmah, Wisdom, also is a general name, but this concealed Wisdom corroborateth andconformeth the form of the Man, so that He may abide in his place.1127. Like as it is written, Eccl. vii. 19: \"Wisdom is a strength to a wise man more than ten rulers which arein a city;\" which (ten ) are the integral conformation of the man.1128. Adam, truly, is the interior conformation, wherein consisteth the RVCh, Ruach, Spirit; like as it is said,1 Sam. xvi. 6: \"Because Adam seeth according to the eyes, but Tetragrammaton seeth according to the heart,\"which is within the interior parts.1129. And in that formation appeareth the true perfection of all things, which existeth above the Throne. Likeas it is written: \"And the appearance as the likeness of Adam upon it from above\" (Ezek. 1. 26).1130.

HEREUNTO are the concealed words, and the more secret meaning (of then; hath been set forth inmany Places). Blessed is his portion who hath known and beheld them, and who erreth not therein.1132.

Rabbi Schimeon wept, and lifted up his voice and said: \"If on account of ourwords which be here revealed, the Companions are to be concealed in the Conclave of the world to come, andare to be taken away from this world, it is justly and rightly done, in order that they may not reveal (thesesecrets) unto one of the children of this world.\"1135. Again he said: \"I return unto myself. For truly I have revealed (these secrets) before the Ancient of theAncient Ones, the Concealed One with all Concealments; but not for mine own glory, not for the glory of thehouse of my father, not for the glory of these my Companions, have I done (this thing).1136. \"But in order that they might not err in His paths, nor that they might enter into the portals of HisPalace to be made ashamed, nor that they might be destroyed for their error. Blessed be my portion with themin the world to come.\"1137. We have learned that before the companions departed from this Assembly, Rabbi Yosi, RabbiChizqiah, and Rabbi Yisa died.1138. And the companions beheld that the holy angels carried them away into that veil expanded above. AndRabbi Schimeon spake a certain word, and fell upon his face.1139. Rabbi Schimeon cried aloud and said: \"Wherefore is this? Because a certain decree hath been decreedagainst us to punish us, seeing that through us that hath been revealed which had not been revealed hitherto,from that day wherein Moses stood upon the mountain of Sinai.1140. \"Like as it is written, Exod. xxxiv. 28: 'And he was there with Tetragrammaton forty days and fortynights.' Why then do I tarry here, if therefor I am to be punished?\"1141. And a Voice was heard which spake, and said: \"Blessed art thou, Rabbi Schimeon, and blessed is thyportion, and that of those companions who are with thee; for unto ye hath that been revealed which is notrevealed unto the whole supernal host.1142. \"But come, behold.

But wherefore those? Because they had entered in, and had not gone forth alternately, before this time.But all the others had entered in, and had gone forth.1147. Rabbi Schimeon spake and said: \"How blessed is the portion of those three, and therefore also blessedis our portion!\"1148. And a second time that Voice pealed forth and said, Deut. iv. 4: \"But ye that did cleave untoTetragrammaton, your God, are alive every one of you this day.\"1149. They arose, and behold there was no place whence a fragrance went not forth.1150. Rabbi Schimeon spake and said: \"From this I perceive that the world receiveth blessing on account ofus.\"1151. And the faces of them all shone, so that men could not look upon them.1152. We have learned that there were ten (Rabbis) entered into (the Assembly), and that seven came forth.1153. And Rabbi Schimeon rejoiced, and Rabbi Abba was sad.1154. On a certain day Rabbi Schimeon sat, and Rabbi Abba with him. Rabbi Schimeon spake a certain word.1153. And they saw those three (Rabbis) who had died, and with them were most beautiful angels, who wereshowing unto them the supernal treasures and conclaves, on account of their great dignity.1156. And they were entering into a mountain of pure balm; and the soul of Rabbi Abba was comforted.1157. We have learned that after that day the companions did not quit the house of Rabbi Schimeon.1158. And when Rabbi Schimeon revealed the Arcana, there were found none present there save those(companions).1159. And Rabbi Schimeon called them the seven eyes of Tetragrammaton, like as it is written, Zach. iii. 9:\"These are the seven eyes of Tetragrammaton.\" And this was said concerning us. 1160. Rabbi Abba spakeand said: \"We six are lights which shine forth from a seventh (light); thou art the seventh light (the origin of )us all.1161. \"For assuredly there is no stability in those six, save (what they derive) from the seventh. For all thingsdepend from the seventh.\"1162. Rabbi Yehudah called him the Sabbath of all the six (Rabbi).1163.

What is the Sabbath? Holy unto Tetragrammaton; so also Rabbi Schimeon is, like the Sabbath, holyunto Tetragrammaton.1165.

Meanwhile Elihu entered, and three beams of light shone in his countenance.1167.

Therefore lifting up his eyes, Rabbi Schimeon saw that the house was full. And Rabbi Schimeon wept,saying: \"The second time when I was sick, and Rabbi Benchas Ben Yair was in my presence, and until I hadchosen my place, life hath been prolonged unto me even until now.3. \"When I was restored, fire surrounded (my habitation) which hitherto hath never ceased, neither did anyman enter in unto me without permission.4. \"But now I see that it is taken away, and that the house is filled.\"5. Whilst they were sitting down, Rabbi Schimeon, opening his eyes, beheld a certain vision, and lo! firesurrounded the house!6. Therefore all (the others) went forth, and Rabbi Eleazar his son, and Rabbi Abba remained; but the otherCompanions sat without.

Rabbi Schimeon said unto Rabbi Eleazar his son: \"Go forth, and see whether Rabbi Yitzchaq be present,for whom I have made myself surety.8. \"And say thou unto him that he dispose his affairs, and that he may sit down with me.

Rabbi Eleazar arose and introduced them, and they sat down in his presence.11. Rabbi Schimeon lifted up his hands and prayed a prayer, and was joyful.12. And he said: \"Let those Companions who were in the former Conclave assemble here.\"13. Therefore, all the others having gone forth, there remained Rabbi Eleazar his son, and Rabbi Abba, andRabbi Yehudah, and Rabbi Yosi Bar Yoqeb, and Rabbi Chiya.14. In the meantime Rabbi Yitzchaq entered, to whom Rabbi Schimeon said: \"How excellent is thy lot! Howmuch joy is this day stored up for thee!\"15. Rabbi Abba sat down behind his (i.e., Rabbi Schimeon's) back, and Rabbi Eleazar before him (i.e., RabbiSchimeon).16. Rabbi Schimeon spake and said: \"Surely now is the time of benevolence, and I desire to enter withoutconfusion into the world to come.17. \"And verily these sacred things, which hereunto have never been revealed, I desire to reveal before theSchekhinah; 18. \"Lest they should say that I have kept back anything, and that I have been taken away fromthe world; for even until now these things have been concealed in my heart, so that having entered into thesevery matters I may be with them in the world to come.19. \"But this is my arrangement of you; let Rabbi Abba write, and let Rabbi Eleazar my son speak openly; butlet the rest of the Companions in silence meditate in their heart.\"20. Rabbi Abba arose from his seat behind him, and Rabbi Eleazar his son sat down.21. He said unto him, \"Arise, O my son, for another shall sit in that seat;\" and Rabbi Eleazar arose.22. Rabbi Schimeon covered himself and sat down; and he commenced, and said Ps. cxv. 17: \"'The dead shallnot praise IH, Yah, nor all they who go down into silence!23. \"'The dead shall not praise Yah; 'so it is certain that it is assuredly those who are called dead; for He, God,the most Holy One\u0014may He be blessed!\u0014is called the Living One, and is Himself commemorated amongthose who are called living, and not with those who are called dead.24. \"And the end of this text runneth thus: 'Nor all they who go down into silence;' for all they who go downinto silence remain in Gehenna.25. \"There is another reason appertaining to those who are called living, for God the must Holy One\u0014may Hebe blessed!\u0014desireth their glory.\" KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDHADRA ZVTA QDIShA (HA IDRA ZUTA QADISHA) OR THE LESSER HOLY ASSEMBLY.138"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"26.

And when he had sat down be said: \"Assuredly here a seat hath been set aside for Rabbi Benchas BenYair.\"35.

CONCERNING THE SKULL OF THE ANCIENT ONE, ANDCONCERNING HIS BRAIN; AND CONCERNING THE THREE HEADS,AND THE HAIR, AND THE DISCRIMINATORY PATHS.51. THE skull of the White Head hath not beginning, but its end is the convexity of its joining together,which is extended, and shineth.52. And from it the just shall inherit four hundred desirable worlds in the world to come.53. And from this convexity of the joining together of this White Skull daily distilleth a dew intoMicroprosopus, into that place which is called Heaven; and in that very place shall the dead be raised to lifein the time to come.54. Like as it is written, Gen. xxvii. 27: \"And Elohim shall give thee from the dew of heaven.\"55. And His head is filled with that dew, and all the place of the apple−trees distilleth therewith.56. He, the Most Holy Ancient One, is hidden and concealed, and in that Skull is the Supernal Wisdomconcealed, who is found and who is not found.57. For assuredly in Him, the Ancient One, nothing is revealed save the Head alone, seeing that that Head isitself the Head of all heads.58. The beginning of that Supernal Wisdom which also is itself the Head, is hidden therein, and is called theSupernal Brain, the Hidden Brain, the Tranquil and Calm Brain; neither doth any man know it save HeHimself.

Three Heads have been formed forth, one within the other, and the other above the other.60. One Head is the Concealed Wisdom, which is covered and is not disclosed.61. And this Hidden Wisdom is the Head of all things, and the Head of the remaining wisdoms.62. The Supernal Head is the Most Holy Ancient One, the Concealed with all Concealments.63. The Head of all Heads, the Head which is not a Head \u0014namely, that which is in that Head\u0014neitherknows nor is known, because it cannot be comprehended either by Wisdom or Understanding.64. And therefore is it read, Num. xxiv. 11: \"Fly thee in thy place;\" and Ezek. i. 14. The Chaioth, livingcreatures, are said to run forth and return. 65. And therefore is the Most Holy Ancient One called AIN, Ain,the Negatively Existent; seeing that back from Him dependeth the AIN, the Negative Existence. 66. But all these hairs and all those locks depend from the Hidden Brain.67. And all are calm (otherwise, are disposed) in the Equilibrium; neither in any manner is the neck seen (i.e.,because of the locks which overshadow it).68. Because He the Most Holy Ancient One is in an unvarying condition of joy, neither changeth He frommercy for ever.69. But in the thirteen measurements of mercies is He found, because that Wisdom hidden in Him is dividedinto three, paths in a quarternary, and He Himself the Ancient One comprehendeth them, and through themdoth He reign over all things.70. One (path) which shineth in the midst of the hairs going forth from the Skull, is that path by whose lightthe just are led into the world to come.71. Like as it is written, Prov. iv. 18: \"And the path of the just shineth as the light.\"72. And concerning this it is written, Isa. lviii. 14: \"Then shalt thou delight thyself in Tetragrammaton.\" 73.And from that path are all the other paths illuminated which depend from Microprosopus.74. He the Eternal Ancient of the Ancient Ones is the highest Crown among the Supernals, wherewith allDiadems and Crowns are crowned.75. And from Him are all the Lights illuminated, and they flash forth flames and shine.76. But He verily is the Supreme Light, which is hidden, which is not known.77. And all the other Lights are kindled by Him, and derive (their ) splendour (from him).78. He the Most Holy Ancient One is found to have three heads, which are contained in the one Head. 79. And He Himself is that only highest supreme Head.80. And since He the Most Holy Ancient One is thus symbolized in the Triad, hence all the other Lightswhich shine are included in Triads.

Moreover, the Most Holy Ancient One is also symbolized by the Duad.82. And the division of the Ancient One in the Duad is so that the ( one form is) the Highest Crown of all theSupernals, the Head of all Heads.83. And (the other is) that superior Head, and It is not known.84. So also all the remaining Lights are mystically divided into Duads.85. Furthermore, the Most Holy Ancient One is symbolized and concealed under the conception of the Unity,for He himself is One, and all things are One.86. And thus all the other Lights are sanctified, are restricted, and are bound tog−ether in the Unity or Monad,and are One; and all things are HVA, Hoa, Himself.CHAPTER III. CONCERNING THE FOREHEAD OF THE MOST HOLYANCIENT ONE.87. THE Forehead, which is uncovered in the Most Holy Ancient One, is called Grace.88. For that Supernal Head concealed in the Higher, which no man hath known, expandeth a certain externalmanifestation, beautiful and gracious, which is comprehended in the Forehead.89. And since He Himself is the grace of all graciousness; hence He assumeth the conformation of theForehead, which is disclosed in the most intense light (otherwise, hath a formation in the figure of a leaf).90. And when It is disclosed, the grace of all gracious. ness is found in all worlds.91. And all the prayers of the Inferiors are accepted; and the countenance of Microprosopus is illuminated,and all things are found to exist in mercy.92. And since (through this) all judgments are hiddenand subjected, hence in the Sabbath, in the time of the afternoon prayers, in which all judgments are excited,that Forehead is disclosed.93. And all the judgments are turned aside, and mercies are found.94. And therefore is the Sabbath found without judgment, as well that which is above as that which is below;also the fire of Gehenna is restrained in its place, and the transgressors are at rest.95. And therefore is the Spirit, NShMTh, of joy added on the Sabbath.96. And it behoveth man to rejoice with three feasts on the Sabbath; for all truth, and the whole system oftruer faith, is found therein ( i.e., in the Sabbath).97. And it behoveth man to prepare the table, that he may eat in the three feasts of true faith, and rejoice inthem. 98.

And it is formed forth and illuminated with many Lights.110. And it produceth and designeth (a certain effect) in this Light (otherwise, in this opening), in thisForehead, whereon is inscribed a certain Light, which is called RTzVN, Ratzon, Grace.111. \"And that Grace is extended backward into the beard, even unto that place where it can remain in thebeard, and it is called the Supernal, ChSD, Chesed, Mercy.112. \"And when this Grace is uncovered, all the Lords of Judgment behold It, and are turned aside.\"CHAPTER IV. CONCERNING THE EYES OF THE MOST HOLY ANCIENTONE.113. THE eyes of the Head of the Most Holy Ancient One are two in one, equal, which ever watch, andsleep not.114. Like as it is written, Ps. cxxi. 4: \"The Keeper of Israel neither slumbereth nor sleepeth,\" &c.\u0014namely, ofIsrael the holy.115. And therefore are there no eyebrows nor eyelashes unto His eyes.116. This Brain is conformed and illuminated with three supernal white brilliances. KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER IV. CONCERNING THE EYES OF THE MOST HOLY ANCIENT ONE.143"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"117. With this white brilliance are the eyes of Microprosopus bathed.118. As it is written, Cant. v. 12: \"Washed with milk,\" flowing down from the fulness of that primal whitebrilliance.119. And with the remaining white brilliances are the other lights cleansed and purified.120. The Brain is called the fountain of Benevolence, the fountain wherein all blessings are found.121. And since this Brain radiateth into the three white brilliances of the eye (of Microprosopus), hence isthat called the \"good eye,\" concerning which it is said, Prov. xxii. 9: \"It shall be blessed,\" or rather that fromit dependeth blessing.122. For through the Brain are manifested the white brilliances of the eye.123. And when this eye looketh upon Microprosopus, all the worlds are (in a state of) happiness. 124. This isthe right eye. The inferior eyes are right and left, two in duplicate colour.125. In the \"Book of Concealed Mystery\" have we taught that there is a Superior Yod, an Inferior Yod; a,Superior He, an Inferior He; a Superior Vau, an Inferior Vau.126. Unto the Ancient One pertain all the Superiors, and unto Microprosopus the Inferiors.127. They depend not in another manner, but only thus; for from the Most Holy Ancient One do they depend.128. For the Name of the Ancient One is concealed in all things, neither is it found.129. But those letters which depend from the Ancient One, so that they may be established, are all inferiors.For were it not so, they could not be established.130. And therefore is the Holy Name alike concealed and manifest.131. For that which is concealed pertaineth unto the Most Holy Ancient One, the Concealed in all things.132. But that, indeed, which is manifested, because it dependeth, belongeth unto Microprosopus. (Otherwise,that which is manifested, is so for this reason\u0014that it is manifested because it dependeth, &c.)133. And therefore do all the blessings require both concealment and manifestation.134. Those concealed letters which hang behind depend from the Most Holy Ancient One.135. Wherefore do they hang behind? For the purpose of establishing the Inferior Yod. (Otherwise, assuredlyfrom the Skull, from the Forehead, from the Eyes, do they depend. And the Yod Maternal dependethtowards the Inferior Yod.)CHAPTER V. CONCERNING THE NOSE OF THE MOST HOLY ANCIENTONE.136. THE NOSE. From this nose, from the openings of the nostrils, the Spirit of Life rusheth forth uponMicroprosopus.

And from that opening of the nose, from those openings of the nostrils, dependeth the letter He, in orderto establish the other and Inferior He.138. And that Spirit proceedeth from the hidden brain, and She is called the Spirit of Life, and through thatSpirit will all men understand ChKMThA, Chokmatha, Wisdom, in the time of King Messiah.139. As it is written, Isa. xi. 2: \"And the Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding, RYC ChKMH VBINH,Ruach Chokmah Va−Binah, shall rest upon Him,\" &c.140. This nose is life in every part; perfect joy, rest of spirit, and health.141. The nose of Microprosopus is as we have (before) conformed it.142. Since concerning Him it is said, Ps. xviii. 9: \"There ascendeth a smoke in His nose,\" &c.143. But concerning this it is written, Isa. xlviii. 9: \"And for my name's sake will I defer mine anger (literally,lengthen my nose) for thee.\"144. (But in the Book which is called \"The Treatise of the School of Rav Yeyeva the Elder,\" the letter He islocated in the mouth, and he doth not argue in the same manner as in the text, neither doth he bring about thesame combination, although the matter eventuateth in the same manner.)145. But yet from the letter the judgment dependeth, and judgment pertaineth unto the nose (ofMicroprosopus). Like as it is written, Ps. xviii. 9: \"Smoke ascendeth out of His nose.\"146. And if thou sayest that behold also it is written, \"And fire out of His mouth consumeth,\" surely thefoundation of wrath dependeth from His nose.147. All the conformations of the Most Holy Ancient One are formed forth from the calm and concealedbrain.148. And all the conformations of Microprosopus are formed through the Inferior Chokmah, Wisdom. Like asit is written, Ps. civ. 24: \"All these hast thou made in Chokmah.\" And certainly it (Wisdom ) is the epitome ofall things.149. Now what is the difference between H, He, and H, He ? By the Inferior He is judgment stirred up; but inthis instance, through the other lire, mercy unto mercy is denoted.CHAPTER VI. CONCERNING THE BEARD OF THE MOST HOLY ANCIENTONE.150. From the Beard of the Most Holy Ancient One hangeth the whole ornament of all, and the Influence; forall things are called from that beard, Influence.151. This is the Ornament of all Ornaments, and this influence do all the superiors and inferiors alike behold.152. From this Influence dependeth the life of all things.153, From this Influence heavens and earth depend, the rains of grace, and the nourishment of all things.154. From this Influence cometh the providence of all things. From this Influence depend all the superior and KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER VI.

Thirteen fountains of excellent and precious oil depend from this beard of most glorious Influence, andthey all flow down into Microprosopus.156. Say not thou, however, that all do so, but nine of them are found (in Microprosopus) for the purpose ofdiverting the judgments.157. And whensoever this Influence hangeth down in equilibrium even unto the heart, all the Holinesses ofthe Holinesses of Holiness depend from it.158. In that Influence is extended an expansion of the Supernal Emanation, which is the Head of all Heads,which is not known nor perfected, and which neither superiors nor inferiors have known, because from thatInfluence all things depend.159. In this beard the Three Heads concerning which we have spoken are expanded, and all things areassociated together in this Influence, and are found therein.160. And therefore every ornament of ornaments dependeth from that Influence.161. Those letters which depend from this Ancient One all hang in that beard, and are associated together inthat Influence.162. And they hang therein for the purpose of establishing the other letters.163. For unless those letters could ascend into the Ancient One, those other letters could not be established.164. And therefore Moses saith when necessary IHVH, IHVH, twice; and so that an accent distinguishes theone from the other.165. For assuredly from the Influence all things depend.166. By that Influence are both superiors and inferiors brought into reverence, and are prostrate before It.167. Blessed is he who attaineth hereunto.CHAPTER VII. CONCERNING THE BRAIN AND THE WISDOM INGENERAL.168. OF this Most Holy Ancient One, Concealed with all Concealments, there is no mention made, neither isHe found.169. For since this Head is the supreme of all the supernals, hence He is only symbolized as a head alonewithout body, for the purpose of establishing all things.170. And He Himself is concealed, and hidden, and kept recondite by all things.171. His conformation is that He is formed forth in that brain, the most hidden of all things, which isexpanded and formed forth, and hence proceedeth the superior and inferior ChSD, Chesed, Mercy.

And the superior Chesed is formed forth and expanded, and all things are comprehended in thisconcealed brain.173. For when that White Brilliance is formed forth in that Light, it acteth upon that which acteth upon thisbrain, and it is enlightened.174. And the second brain dependeth from that very glorious Influence, it is expanded into the thirty−two paths, when it is illuminated, then it shineth from that very glorious Influence. 175. Therefore are the Three Supernal Heads illuminated; Two Heads, and One which comprehendeth them;and they hang in that Influence, and by It are they comprehended.176. Hence becometh the ornament of the beard to be manifested, which is the occult Influence.177. And those inferiors are conformed, like as the Most Holy Ancient One.178. The Three Heads surround Him; thus all things can appear in the Three Heads; and when they areilluminated all things depend together from Him in the Three Heads, whereof two are on the two sides, andone which includeth them.179. And if thou sayest, \"Who is the Most Holy Ancient One?\" Come and see. The Supreme Head is thatwhich is not known, nor comprehended, nor designated, and that (Head) comprehendeth all things.180. And the Two Heads are contained in Itself. (Otherwise hang, &c.)181. And then are all these things thus ordained; truly Himself existeth not in numeration, nor in system, norin computation, but in the judgment of the heart.182. Concerning this it is written, Ps. xxxix. 2: \"I said I will take heed unto my ways, that I offend not withmy tongue.\"183. The place of commencement is found from the Most Holy Ancient One, and it is illuminated by theInfluence. That is the Light of Wisdom.184. And it is extended in thirty−two directions, and departeth from that hidden brain, from that Light whichexisteth in Itself.185. And because the Most Holy Ancient One shineth in the beginning (otherwise, in the wisdom), this itselfis this. And, the same is that beginning from which manifestation is made.186. And is conformed in the Three Heads, which One Head includeth.187. And those three are extended into Microprosopus, and from them all things shine forth.188. Thenceforth this Wisdom instituteth a formation, and produceth a certain river which floweth down andgoeth forth to water the garden.189. And it entereth into the head of Microprosopus, and formeth a certain other brain.190. And thence it is extended and floweth forth into the whole body, and watereth all those plants (of thegarden of Eden). KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER VII.

Concerning which it is written, Prov. iii. 20: \"In DOTh, Daath, Knowledge, the depths are broken up.\"195. And it entereth into the head of Microprosopus, and formeth another brain.196. And thenceforth is it extended and goeth into the interior parts of His body, and filleth all thoseconclaves and assemblies of His body. 197. This is that same which is written, Prov. xxiv. 4: \"In Daath shall the secret places be filled.\"198. And those shine from the Light of that supernal concealed brain which shineth in the Influence, MZL, ofthe Most Holy Ancient One.199. And all things depend mutually from Himself, and mutually are bound together unto Himself, until He isknown, because all things are one, and HVA, Hoa, He, the Ancient One, is all things, neither from Him cananything whatsoever be separated.200. Into three other Lights, which are called the Fathers, do these three Lights shine, and these fathers shineinto the children, and all things shine forth from the one place. 201. When He, that Ancient One, who is the Grace of all Grace, is manifested, all things are found in lightand in perfect happiness.202. This Eden is derived from the superior Eden, the Concealed with all Concealments.203. And therefore is that Eden called the beginning in the Ancient One; neither yet, however, is therebeginning or end. 204. And since in Him beginning and end exist not, hence He is not called AThH, Atah, Thou; seeing that Heis concealed and not revealed. But HVA, Hoa, He, is He called.205. But in that aspect wherein the beginning is found, the name AThH, Atah, Thou, hath place, and the nameAB, Ab, Father. For it is written, Isa, lxiii. 16: \"Since Atah, Thou, art Ab, our Father.\"206. In the teaching of the school of Rav Yeyeva the Elder, the universal rule is that Microprosopus be calledAThH, Atah, Thou; but that the most Holy Ancient One, who is concealed, be called HVA, Hoa, He; and alsowith reason. 207. Now truly in that place wherein beginning is found, is He thus called, although He isconcealed.208. And therefrom is the beginning, and it is called AThH, Atha , Thou; and He is the Father of the Fathers.20g. And that Father proceedeth from the Most Holy Ancient One, like as it is written, Job. xxviii. 12: \"AndChKMH, Chokmah, Wisdom, is found from AIN, Ain, the Negatively Existent One;\" and therefore is Henot known.

It is written, ibid. 22: \"The Elohim have known the path;\" His path, properly speaking.211. But again, further on: VHVA, Va−Hoa, and He Himself knoweth His place; \"His place properlyspeaking; much more His path; and much more this WISDOM which is concealed in the Most Holy AncientOne.212. This Wisdom is the beginning of all things. Thencefrom are expanded the thirty−two paths: ShBILIN,Shebilin, Paths, I say; and not ARChIN, Archin, Byways.213. And in them is the Law comprehended, in the twenty−two letters and in the ten utterances. 214. This Chokmah is the Father of Fathers, and in this Chokmah is beginning and end discovered; andtherefore is there one Chokmah supernal, and another Chokmah inferior.215. When Chokmah is extended, then is He called the Father of Fathers, for in none else are all thingscomprehended save in Him. (Otherwise, when they are expanded all things are called Chokmoth, and theFather of Fathers; all things are comprehended in no place, save herein.) 20. As it is written, Ps. civ. 25: \"Allthings in Chokmah hast Thou formed.\"217. Rabbi Schimeon lifted up his hands, and rejoiced, and said: Assuredly it is Eden or Paradise, and allthings have their operation in this hour.CHAPTER VIII. CONCERNING THE FATHER AND THE MOTHER INSPECIAL.218. COME and behold. When the Most Holy Ancient One, the Concealed with all Concealments, desired tobe formed forth, He conformed all things under the form of Male and Female; and in such place whereinMale and Female are comprehended.219. For they could not permanently exist save in another aspect of the Male and the Female (theircountenances being joined together).220. And this Wisdom embracing all things, when it goeth forth and shineth forth from the Most HolyAncient One, shineth not save under the form of Male and Female.221. Therefore is this Wisdom extended, and it is found that it equally becometh Male and Female.222. ChKMH AB BINH AM, Chokmah Ab Binah Am: Chokmah is the Father, and Binah is the Mother, andtherein are Chokmah, Wisdom, and Binah, Understanding, counterbalanced together in most perfect equalityof Male and Female.223. And therefore are all things established in the equality of Male and Female; for were it not so, how couldthey subsist!224. This beginning is the Father of all things; the Father of all Fathers; and both are mutually boundtogether, and the one path shineth into the other\u0014Chokmah, Wisdom, as the Father; Binah, Understanding, asthe Mother.225. It is written, Prov. ii. 3: \"If thou callest Binah the Mother.\" KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER VIII. CONCERNING THE FATHER AND THE MOTHER IN SPECIAL.149"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"226. When They are associated together They generate, and are expanded in truth.2227. In the teaching of the school of Rav Yeyeva the Elder it is thus taught: \"What is Binah the Mother ofUnderstanding?\" Truly when They are mutually associated together.228. Assuredly Yod, I, impregnateth the letter He, H, and produceth a Son, and She herself bringeth Himforth. 229. And therefore is it called BINH, as if (it were a transposition of) BINH, Ben Yah, Son of IH (or I, Yod,H, He, and BN, the Son).230. But They both are found to he the perfection of all things when They are associated together, and whenthe Son is in Them the Syntagma of all things findeth place.231. For in Their conformations are They found to be the perfection of all things\u0014Father and Mother, Son,and Daughter.232. These things have not been revealed save unto the Holy Superiors who have entered therein anddeparted therefrom, and have known the paths of the Most Holy. God (may He be blessed!), so that they havenot erred in them either on the right hand or on the left. 233. For thus it is written, Hos. xiv. 9: \"The paths ofTetragrammaton are true, and the just shall walk in them,\" &c.235. For these things are concealed, and the Holy Highest Ones shine in them, like as light proceedeth fromthe shining of a lantern.236. These things are not revealed save unto those who have entered therein and departed therefrom; for asfor him who hath not entered therein and departed therefrom, better were it for him that he had never beenborn.237. For it hath been manifested before the Most Holy Ancient One, the Concealed with all Concealments,because these things have shone into mine heart in the perfection of the love and fear of the Most Holy God,may He be blessed!238. And these, my sons, who are here present, know these things; for into these matters have they enteredand therefrom have they departed; but neither yet into all (the secrets of them). 239. But now are these things illustrated in (their) perfection, even as it was necessary. Blessed be my portionwith them in this world!240. Rabbi Schimeon said: All which I have said concerning the Most Holy Ancient One, and all which Ihave said concerning Microprosopus, all are one, all are HVA, Hoa, Himself, all are Unity, neither hereinhath separation place.241. Blessed be HVA, Hoa, He, and blessed be His Name unto the Ages of the Ages.242. Come, behold! This beginning which is called Father, is comprehended in I, Yod, , which dependethfrom the Holy Influence. 243. And therefore is I, Yod, the Most Concealed of all the other letters. 244. For I, Yod, is the beginning and the end of all things.245.

And this is the delight of the just, that they may be made worthy of that world which is to come, whichever watereth the garden of Eden, nor faileth.247. Concerning this it is written, Isa. lviii. 11: \"And like a fountain of water, whose waters fail not.\"248. And that world to come is created through I, Yod.249. As it is written, Gen. ii. 9: \"And a river went forth out of Eden to water the garden.\"250. For I, Yod, includeth two letters.251. In the teaching of the school of Rav Yeyeva the Elder thus is the tradition. Wherefore are VD, VauDaleth, comprehended in IVD, Yod? Assuredly the planting of the garden is properly called V, Vau; andthere is another garden which is D, Daleth , and by that Vau is Daleth watered, which is the symbol of thequaternary. 252. And an Arcanum is extended from this passage, where it is written: \"And a river went forth out of Eden.\"253. What is Eden? It is the supernal ChKMH, Chokmah, Wisdom, and that is I, Yod (in I, V, D). 254. \"Towater the garden.\" That is V, Vau.255. \"And thence it is divided and goeth forth into four heads.\" That is D, Daleth.256. And all things are included in IVD, Yod, and therefore is the Father called All, the Father of Fathers.257. The beginning of all is called the Home of All. Whence IVD, Yod, is the beginning and the end of all;like as it is written, Ps. civ. 24: \"All things in Chokmah hast Thou made.\"258. In His place He is not manifested, neither is He known; when He is associated with the Mother, BAMA,Be−Ama, then is He made known (otherwise, symbolized) in the Mother, BAIMA, Be−Aima. 259. And therefore is Aima known to be the consummation of all things, and She is signified to be thebeginning and the end.260. For all things are called Chokmah, and therein are all things concealed; and the Syntagma of all things isthe Holy Name.261. Thus far have we mystically described that which we have not said on all the other days. But now are theaspects shown forth.262. (As to the Sacred Name IHVH,) I, Yod, is included in this Chokmah, Wisdom; H, He, is Aima, and iscalled Binah, Understanding; VH, Vau He, are those two Children who are produced from Aima, the Mother.263. Also we have learned that the name BINH, Binah, comprehendeth all things. For in Her is I, Yod, whichis associated with Aima, or the letter H, He, and together they produce BN, Ben, the Son, and this is the wordBinah. Father and Mother, who are I, Yod, and H, He, with whom are interwoven the letters B, Beth, and N,Nun, which are BN, Ben; and thus far regarding Binah.264. Also is She called ThBVNH, Thebunah, the Special Intelligence. Wherefore is She sometimes called KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER VIII.

Assuredly Thebunah is She called at that time in which Her two Children appear, the Son and theDaughter, BN VBTh, Ben Va−Bath, who are VH, Vau He; and at that time is She called ThBVNH, Thebunah.266. For all things are comprehended in those letters, VH, Vau He , which are BN VBTh, Ben Va−Bath, Sonand Daughter; and all things are one system, and these are the letters ThBVNH.267. In the Book of Rav Hamenuna the Elder it is said that Solomon revealeth the primal conformation (thatis, the Mother) when he saith, Cant. i. 15: \"Behold, thou art fair, my love;\" wherefore he followeth it outhimself.268. And he calleth the second conformation the Bride, which is called the Inferior Woman.269. And there are some who apply both these names (those, namely, of Love and Bride) to this InferiorWoman, but these are not so.270. For the first H, He (of IHVH), is not called the Bride; but the last H, He, is called the Bride at certaintimes on account of many symbolic reasons.271. For many are the times when the Male is not associated with Her, but is separated from Her.272. Concerning this period it is said, Lev. xviii. 19: \"Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman in theseparation of her uncleanness.\"273. But when the Female hath been purified, and the Male desireth to be united unto Her, then is she calledthe Bride\u0014the Bride, properly so called. 274. But as to that which pertaineth unto the Mother, then thebenevolence of Them both is not taken away for all eternity.275. Together They (Chokmah and Binah, IH) go forth, together they are at rest; the one ceaseth not from theother, and the one is never taken away from the other.276. And therefore is it written, Gen. ii. 10: \"And a river went forth out of Eden\"\u0014i.e., properly speaking, itcontinually goeth forth and never faileth.277. As it is written, Isa. lviii. 11: \"And like a fountain of waters, whose waters fail not.\"278. And therefore is She called \"My love,\" since from the grace of kindred association They rest in perfectunity.279. But the other is called the Bride, for when the Male cometh that He may consort with Her, then is Shethe Bride, for She, properly speaking, cometh forth as the Bride.280. And therefore doth Solomon expound those two forms of the Woman; and concerning the first formindeed he worketh hiddenly, seeing it is hidden.281. But the second form is more fully explained, seeing that it is not so hidden as the other.282. But at the end all his praise pertaineth unto Her who is supernal, as it is written, Cant. vi. 9: \"She is theonly one of Her Mother, She is the choice one of Her that bare Her.\" KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER VIII.

And since this Mother, Aima, is crowned with the crown of the Bride, and the grace of the letter I, Yod,ceaseth not from Her for ever, hence unto Her arbitration is committed all the liberty of those inferior, and allthe liberty of all things, and all the liberty of sinners, so that all things may be purified.284. As it is written, Lev. xvi. 30: \"Since in that day he shall atone for you.\"285. Also it is written, Lev. xxv. 10: \"And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year.\" This year is IVBL, Yobel,jubilee.286. What is Yobel? As, it is written, Jer. xvii. 8: \"VOL IVBL, Va−El Yobel, And spreadeth out her roots bythe river;\" therefore that river which ever goeth forth and floweth, and goeth forth and faileth not.287. It is written, Prov. ii. 3: \"If thou wilt call Binah the Mother, and wilt give thy voice unto Thebunah.\"288. Seeing it is here said, \"If thou wilt call Binah the Mother,\" wherefore is Thebunah added?289. Assuredly, according as I have said, all things are supernal truth: Binah is higher than Thebunah. For inthe word BINH, Binah , are shown Father, Mother, and Son; since by the letters IH, Father and Mother aredenoted, and the letters BN, denoting the Son, are amalgamated with them.290. ThBVNH, Thebunah, is the whole completion of the children, since it containeth the letters BN, Ben,BTh, Bath , and VH, Vau He, by which are denoted the Son and Daughter.291. Yet AB VAM, Ab Ve−Am, the Father and the Mother, are not found, save BAIMA, Be−Aima, in theMother, for the venerable Aima broodeth over Them, neither is She uncovered.292. Whence it cometh that that which embraceth the two Children is called ThBVNH, Thebunah, and thatwhich embraceth the Father, the Mother, and the Son is called BINH, Binah.293. And when all things are comprehended, they are comprehended therein, and are called by that name ofFather, Mother, and Son.294. And these are ChKMH, Wisdom, Father; BINH, Understanding, Mother; and DOTh, Däath, Knowledge.295. Since that Son assumeth the symbols of His Father and of His Mother, and is called DOTh, Däath,Knowledge, since He is the testimony of Them both.296. And that Son is called the first−born, as it is written, Exod. iv. 22: \"Israel is my first−born son.\"297. And since He is called first−born, therefore it implieth dual offspring.298. And when He increaseth, in His Crown appear three divisions. 299. But whether it be taken in this way or in that, there are as well two as three divisions herein, for allthings are one; and so is it in this (light) or in that. 300. Nevertheless, He (the Son) receiveth the inheritance of His Father and of His Mother.301. What is that inheritance? These two crowns, which are hidden within Them, which They pass on insuccession to this Son. 302. From the side of the Father (Chokmah) there is one Crown concealed therein, which is called Chesed.

And from the side of the Mother (Binah) there is one Crown, which is called Geburah.304. And all those crown His head (i.e., the Head of Microprosopus), and He taketh them.305. And when that Father and Mother shine above Him, all (these crowns) are called the phylacteries of the.Head, and that Son taketh all things, and becometh the heir of all.306. And He passeth on His inheritance unto the Daughter, and the Daughter is nourished by Him. But,properly speaking, henceforth ( from the parents) doth the Son become the heir, and not the Daughter.307. The Son becometh the heir of His Father and of His Mother, and not the Daughter, but by Him is theDaughter cherished.308. As it is written, Dan. iv. 12: \"And in that tree food for all.\"309. And if thou sayest all, assuredly He as well as She are called TzDIQ, Tzediq, Just, and TzDQ, Tzedeq,Justice, which are in one and are one.310. All things are thus. Father and Mother are mutually contained in and associated with themselves.311. And the Father is the more concealed (of the two), and the whole adhereth unto the Most Holy AncientOne.312. And dependeth from the Holy Influence, which is the Ornament of all Ornaments.313. And they, the Father and the Mother, constitute the abode, as I have said.314. As it is written, Prov. xxiv. 3, 4: \"Through Chokmah is the abode constructed, and by Thebunah is itestablished, and in Däath shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.315. Also it is written, Prov. xxii. 18: \"For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep (Däath) within thee.\"316. This is the system of all things, even as I have said, and ( all things) depend from the Glorious HolyInfluence.317. Rabbi Schimeon said: In the (former) Assembly I revealed not all things, and all those things have beenconcealed even until now.318. And I have wished to conceal them, even unto the world to come, because there also a certain questionwill be propounded unto me. 319. As it is written, Isa. xxxiii. 6: \"And Chokmah and Däath shall be thestability of thy times, and strength of salvation; the fear of Tetragrammaton is His treasure,\" &c., and theyshall seek out Wisdom, Chokmah.320. Now truly thus is the will of the Most Holy and Blessed God, and without shame will I enter in beforeHis palace.321. It is written, 1 Sam. ii. 3: \"Since AL DOVTh, El Daoth, is Tetragrammaton.\" Daoth, or of Knowledges(plural), properly speaking, for He acquireth Daoth by Inheritance.322.

In the \"Book of the Treatise\" it is said concerning these words, \"Since El Daoth is Tetragrammaton,\"read not DOVTh, Daoth, of knowledges, but ODVTh, Edoth, of testimony.326. For HVA, Hoa, He Himself, is the testimony of all things, the testimony of the two portions.327. And it is said, Ps. lxxviii. 5: \"And He established a testimony, ODVTh, in Jacob.\"328. Moreover, also, although we have placed that matter in the \"Book of Concealed Mystery,\" still also therewhat is mentioned of it is correct, and so all things are beautiful and all things, are true.329. When the matter is hidden, that Father and Mother contain all things, and all things are concealed inthem.330. And they themselves are hidden beneath the Holy Influence of the Most Ancient of all Antiquity; in Himare they concealed, in Him are all things included.331. HVA, Hoa, He Himself, is all things; blessed be Hoa, and blessed be His Name in eternity, and unto theages of the ages.332. All the words of the conclave of the Assembly are beautiful, and all are holy words\u0014words whichdecline not either unto the right hand or unto the left.333. All are words of hidden meaning for those who have entered in and departed thence, and so are they all.334. And those words have hereunto been concealed; therefore have I feared to reveal the same, but now theyare revealed.335. And I reveal them in the presence of the Most Holy Ancient King, for not for mine own glory, nor forthe glory of my Father's house, do I this; but I do this that I may not enter in ashamed before His palaces.336. Henceforth I only see that He, God the Most Holy\u0014may He be blessed!\u0014and all these truly just men whoare here found, can all consent (hereunto) with me.337.

Rabbi Abba saith that when (Rabbi Schimeon) had finished this discourse, the Holy Light (i.e., RabbiSchimeon) lifted up his hands and wept, and shortly after smiled.339. For he wished to reveal another matter, and said: I have been anxious concerning this matter all mydays, and now they give me not leave,340. But having recovered himself he sat down, and murmured with his lips and bowed himself thrice;neither could any other man behold the place where he was, much less him.

And this day suffereth not increase, neither can it pass on into the place of another day, for this wholeday hath been yielded unto my power.346. And now I begin to reveal these things, that I may not enter ashamed into the world to come.

What wise man will examine this, so that he may behold His paths, (those, namely,) of the Most HolySupernal One, the judgments of truth, the judgments which are crowned with His Supernal crowns.349. For I say that all the lights which shine from the Supreme Light, the Most Concealed of All, are all paths(leading) towards that light.350. And in that Light which existeth in those single paths, whatsoever is revealed is revealed.351. And all those lights adhere mutually together, this light in that light, and that light in this light.352. And they shine mutually into each other, neither are they divided separately from each other.353. That Light, I say, of those lights, severally and conjointly, which are called the conformations of theKing, or of the Crown of the King, that which shineth and adhereth to that Light, which is the innermost of allthings, nor ever shineth without them.354. And therefore do all things ascend in one path, and all things are crowned by one and the same thing,and one thing is not separated from another, since HVA, Hoa, Himself, and His Name, are one.355. That Light which is manifested is called the Vestment; for He Himself, the King, is the Light of all theinnermost.356. In that Light is Hoa, Who is not separated nor manifested.357. And all those lights and all those luminaries shine forth from the Most Holy Ancient One, the Concealedwith all Concealments, who is the Highest Light.

Two light−bearers are found, which are the conformation of the throne of the King; and they are calledTzDQ, Tzedeq, Justice, and MShPT, Meshephat, Judgment.361. And they are the beginning and the consummation. And through them are all the judgments crowned, aswell superior as inferior.362. And they all are concealed in Meshephat. And from that Meshephat is Tzedeq nourished.363. And sometimes they call the same, MLKI TzDQ MLK ShLM, Meleki Tzedeq Melek Shalem,Melchizedek, King of Salem.364. When the judgments are crowned by Meshephat, all things are mercy; and all things are in perfect peace,because the one temperateth the other.365. Tzedeq and the Rigours are reduced into order, and all these descend into the world in peace and inmercy.366. And then is the hour sanctified, so that the Male and the Female are united, and the worlds all andseveral exist in love and in joy.367. But whensoever sins are multiplied in the world, and the sanctuary is polluted, and the Male and Femaleare separated. 368. And when that strong Serpent beginneth to arise, Woe, then, unto thee, O World! who in that time artnourished by this Tzedeq. For then arise many slayers of men and executioners (of judgment) in thee, OWorld. Many just men are withdrawn from thee.369. But wherefore is it thus? Because the Male is separated from the Female, and judgment, Meshephat, isnot united unto justice, Tzedeq.370. And concerning this time it is written, Prov. xiii. 23: \"There is that is destroyed, because therein is notMeshephat.\" Since Meshephat is departed from this Tzedeq which is not therefore restrained; and Tzedeqhath operation after another manner.371. And concerning this (matter) thus speaketh Solomon the king, Eccles. vii. 16: \"All these things have Iseen in the days of my HBL, Hebel; there is a just man who perisheth in his Tzedeq,\" &c.372. Where by the word HBL, Hebel (which is usually translated \"vanity\"), is understood the breath fromthose supernal breathers forth which are called the nostrils of the King.373. But when he saith HBLI, Hebeli, of my breath, Tzedeq, Justice, is to be understood, which isMLKVThA QDIShA, Malkutha Qadisha, the holy Malkuth (Sanctum Regnum, the Holy Kingdom).374.

When some sublimely just man is found in the world, who is dear unto God the MostHoly One\u0014may He be blessed!\u0014then even if Tzedeq, Justice, alone be stirred up, still on account of him theworld can bear it.377.

David the king said at first, Ps. xxvi. 2: \"Try me, O Tetragrammaton, and prove me!\" For I shall not bedestroyed by all the severities, not even by Tzedeq, Justice Herself, seeing that I am joined thereunto.380. For what is written, Ps. xvii. 15: \"In Tzedeq, Justice, I will behold Thy countenance.\" Therefore,properly speaking, I cannot be destroyed through Tzedeq, seeing that I can maintain myself in its severities. 381. But after that he had sinned, he was even ready to be consumed by that Meshephat, Judgment. Whence itis written, Ps. cxliii. 2: \"And enter not into Meshephat, Judgment, with Thy servant!\"382. Come and see! When that Tzedeq, Justice, is mitigated by that Meshephat, Judgment, then is it calledTzDQH, Tzedeqah, Liberality.383. And the world is tempered by Chesed, Mercy, and is filled therewith.384. As it is written, Ps. xxxiii. 5: \"Delighting in TzDQH, Liberality, and MShPT, Judgment; the earth is fullof the ChSD, Mercy, of Tetragrammaton.\"385. I testify concerning myself, that during my whole life I have been solicitous in the world, that I shouldnot fall under the severities of justice, nor that the world should be burned up with the flames thereof.386. As it is written, Prov. xxx. 20: \"She eateth and wipeth her mouth.\"387. Thenceforward and afterwards all and singular are near unto the Abyss.388. And verily in this generation certain just men are given ( upon earth); but they are few who arise thatthey may defend the flock from the four angles (otherwise, but judgments arise against the world, and desireto rush upon us).CHAPTER X. CONCERNING MICROPROSOPUS IN ESPECIAL, WITHCERTAIN DIGRESSIONS; AND CONCERNING THE EDOMITE KINGS.389. HEREUNTO have I propounded how one thing agreeth with another; and I have expounded those thingswhich have been concealed in the most Holy Ancient One, the Concealed with all Concealments; and howthese are connected with those.390. But now for a time I will discourse concerning the requisite parts of Microprosopus; especiallyconcerning those which were not manifested in the Conclave of the Assembly, and which have been KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER X.

Hereunto have I mystically and in a subtle manner propounded all those matters. Blessed is his portionwho entereth therein and departeth therefrom, and (blessed the portion) of those who shall be the heirs of thatinheritance.392. As it is written, Ps. cxliv. 15: \"Blessed are the people with whom it is so,\" &c.393. Now these be the matters which we have propounded. The Father and the Mother adhere unto theAncient One, and also unto His conformation; since they depend from the Hidden Brain, Concealed with allConcealments, and are connected therewith.394. And although the Most Holy Ancient One hath been conformed ( as it were) alone (i.e., apparentlyapart from all things at first sight); yet when all things are accurately inspected, all things are HVA, Hoa,Himself, the Ancient One, alone.395. Hoa is and Hoa shall be; and all those forms cohere with Himself, are concealed in Himself, and are notseparated from Himself.396. The Hidden Brain is not manifested, and (Microprosopus) doth not depend immediately from it.397. The Father and the Mother proceed from this Brain, and depend from It, and are connected with It,393. (Through Them) Microprosopus dependeth from the Most Holy Ancient One, and is connected (withHim). And these things have we already revealed in the Conclave of the Assembly.399. Blessed is his portion who entereth therein and departeth therefrom, and hath known the paths; so that hedeclineth not unto the right hand, or unto the left.400. But if any man entereth not therein and departeth therefrom, better were it for that (man) that he hadnever been born. For thus it is written, Hos. xiv., 10: \"True are Thy ways, O Tetragrammaton!\"401. Rabbi Schimeon spake and said: Through the whole day have I meditated on that saying where it is said,Ps. xxxiv. 2: \"My Nephesch shall rejoice in Tetragrammaton, the humble shall hear thereof and rejoice;\"and now that whole text is confirmed (in my mind).402. \"My Nephesch shall rejoice in Tetragrammaton.\" This is true, for my Neschamah is connectedtherewith, radiateth therein, adhereth thereto, and is occupied thereabout, and in this same occupation isexalted in its place.403. \"The humble shall hear thereof and rejoice.\" All those just and blessed man who have come intocommunion with God, the most Holy\u0014blessed be He!\u0014all hear and rejoice.404. Ah I now is the Holy One confessed; and therefore magnify Tetragrammaton with me, and let us exaltHis Name together!\" 405. Thus is it written, Gen. xxxvi. 31: \"And those are the kings who reigned in the landof Edom.\" And also it is written thus, Ps. xlviii. 4: \"Since, lo! the kings assembled, they passed awaytogether.\"406. \"In the land of Edom.\" That is, \"in the place wherewith the judgments are connected.\"407. \"They passed away together.\" As it is written, \"And he died, and there reigned in his stead.\" KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER X.

This is that which followeth in the text: \"As we have heard, so have we seen, in the city,\" &c. For all didnot endure.410. But She (the Bride) now subsisteth beside the Male, with Whom She abideth.411. This is that which is written, Gen. xxxvi. 39: \"And Hadar reigned in his stead, and the name of his citywas Pau, and the name of his wife was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mizaheb.\"412. Assuredly this have we before explained in the Assembly. 413. Now, also, in the book of the teaching of Rav Hamenuna the Elder it is said: \"And Hadar reigned in hisstead.\" The word HDR, Hadar, is properly to be expounded according unto that which is said, Lev. xxiii. 40:\"The fruit of trees which are HDR, Hadar, goodly.\"414. \"And the name of his wife Mehetabel,\" as it is written (in the text just cited), \"branches of palm trees.\"415. Also it is written, Ps. xcii. 3: \"The just man shall flourish as the palm tree.\" For this is of the male andfemale sex.416. She is called \"the daughter of Matred;\" that is, the Daughter from that place wherein all things are boundtogether, which is called AB, Father.417. Also it is written, Job. xxviii. 13: \"Man knoweth not the price thereof, neither is it found in the land ofthe living.\"418. She is the Daughter of Aima, the Mother; from Whose side the judgments are applied which striveagainst all things.419. The Daughter of Mizaheb because She hath nourishment from the two Countenances (Chokmah andBinah, which are within Kether); and shineth with two colours\u0014namely from ChSD, Chesed, Mercy; andfrom DIN, Din, Judgment.420. For before the world was established Countenance beheld not Countenance. 421. And therefore were the Prior Worlds destroyed, for the Prior Worlds were formed without (equilibrated)conformation.422. But these which existed not in conformation are called vibrating flames and sparks, like as when theworker in stone striketh sparks from the flint with his hammer, or as when the smith smiteth the iron anddasheth forth sparks on every side.423. And these sparks which fly forth flame and scintillate, but shortly they are extinguished. And these arecalled the Prior Worlds.424. And therefore have they been destroyed, and persist not, until the Most Holy Ancient One can beconformed, and the workman can proceed unto His work. KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER X.

And therefore have we related in our discourse that that ray sendeth forth sparks upon sparks in threehundred and twenty directions.426. And those sparks are called the Prior Worlds, and suddenly they perished.427. Then proceeded the workman unto His work, and was conformed, namely as Male and Female. 428.And those sparks became extinct and died, but now all things subsist.429. From a Light−Bearer of insupportable brightness proceeded a Radiating Flame, dashing off like a vastand mighty hammer those sparks which were the Prior Worlds.430. And with most subtle ether were these intermingled and bound mutually together, but only when theywere conjoined together, even the Great Father and Great Mother.431. From Hoa, Himself, is AB, the Father; and from Hoa , Himself, is Ruach, the Spirit; Who are hidden inthe Ancient of Days, and therein is that ether concealed.432. And It was connected with a light−bearer, which went forth from that Light−Bearer of insupportablebrightness, which is hidden in the Bosom of Aima, the Great Mother.CHAPTER XI. CONCERNING THE BRAIN OF MICROPROSOPUS AND ITSCONNECTIONS.433. AND when both can be conjoined and bound together mutually ( i.e., the Father and the Mother), thereproceedeth thenceforth a certain hard Skull.434. And it is extended on its sides, so that there may be one part on one side, and another one on anotherside.435. For as the Most Holy Ancient One is found to include equally in Himself the Three Heads, so all thingsare symbolized under the form of the Three Heads, as we have stated.436. Into this skull (of Microprosopus) distilleth the dew from the White Head (of Macroprosopus), andcovereth it.437. And that dew appeareth to be of two colours, and by it is nourished the field of the holy apple trees.438. And from this dew of this Skull is the manna prepared for the just in the world to come. 439. And by it shall the dead be raised to life.440. But that manna hath not at any other time been prepared so that it might descend from this dew, save atthat time when the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness, and the Ancient One supplied them with foodfrom this place; because that afterwards it did not fall out so more fully.44n This is the same which is said, Exod. xvi. 4: \"Behold I rain upon you bread from heaven.\" And also thatpassage where it is thus written, Gen. xxvii. 28: \"And the Elohim shall give unto thee of the dew of heaven.\"442. These things occur in that time. Concerning another time it is written: \"The food of man is from God theMost Holy One\u0014blessed be He!\"\u0014and that dependeth from MZLA, Mezla, the Influence; assuredly, from the KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XI. CONCERNING THE BRAIN OF MICROPROSOPUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS.161"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Influence rightly so called.443. And therefore is it customary to say: \"Concerning children, life, and nourishment, the matter dependethnot from merit, but from the Influence.\" For all these things depend from this Influence, as we have alreadyshown.444. Nine thousand myriads of worlds receive influence from and are uphold by that GVLGLThA,Golgeltha, Skull. 445. And in all things is that subtle AVIRA, Auira, Ether, contained, as It Itself containethall things, and as. in It all things are comprehended.446. His countenance is extended in two sides, in two lights, which in themselves contain all things.447. And when His countenance (i.e., that of Microprosopus) looketh back upon the countenance of the MostHoly Ancient One, all things are called ARK APIM, Arikh Aphim, Vastness of Countenance.,448. What is ARK APIM, or Vastness of Countenance? Also it should rather be called ARVK APIM, ArokhAphim, Vast in Countenance.449. Assuredly thus is the tradition, since also He prolongeth His wrath against the wicked. But the phraseARK APIM, Arikh Aphim, also implies the same as \"healing power of countenance.\"450. Seeing that health is never found in the world save when the countenances (of Macroprosopus andMicroprosopus) mutually behold each other.451. In the hollow of the Skull (of Microprosopus) shine three lights. And although thou canst call themthree, yet notwithstanding are there four, as we have before said.452. He (Microprosopus) is the heir of His Father and of his Mother, and there are two inheritances fromThem; all which things are bound together under the symbol of the Crown of His Head. And they are thephylacteries of His Head.453. After that these are united together after a certain manner they shine, and go forth into the Three Cavitiesof the Skull.454. (And then) singly they are developed each after its own manner, and they are extended through thewhole body.455. But they are associated together in two Brains, and the third Brain containeth the others in itself. 456. And it adhereth as well to the one side as to the other, and is expanded throughout the whole body.457. And therefrom are formed two colours mixed together in one, and His countenance shineth.458. And the colours of His countenance are symbols of Ab (the Father) and Aima (the Mother), and arecalled Däath ( Knowledge) in Däath.459. As it is written, 1 Sam. ii. 3: \"Since El Daoth (plural) is Tetragrammaton,\" because in him there are twocolours.460. Unto Him (Microprosopus) are works ascribed diversely; but to the Most Holy Ancient One(operations) are not ascribed diversely. KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XI. CONCERNING THE BRAIN OF MICROPROSOPUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS.162"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"461. For what reason doth He (Microprosopus) admit of variable disposition? Because He is the heir of twoinheritances ( i.e., from Chokmah and Binah).462. Also it is written, Ps. xviii. 26: \"With the merciful man thou shalt show thyself merciful.\"463. But also truly and rightly have the Companions decided concerning that saying where it is written, Gen.xxix. 12: \"And Jacob declared unto Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son.464. It is written, \"Rebekah's son,\" and not \"the son of Isaac.\" And all the mysteries are in Chokmah. 465.And therefore is (Chokmah ) called the Perfection of all: and to it is ascribed the name of Truth.466. And therefore is it written, \"And Jacob declared:\" and not written, \"and Jacob said.\"467. Those (two) colours are extended throughout the whole Body (Microprosopus) and His Body coherethwith them.468. In the Most Holy Ancient One, the Concealed with all Concealments, (things) are not ascribed diversely,and unto Him do they not tend (diversely), since the whole is the same ( with itself) and (thus is) life unto all(things); and from Him judgment dependeth not (directly).469. But concerning Him (Microprosopus) it is written, that unto Him are ascribed (diverse) works, properlyspeaking.CHAPTER XII. CONCERNING THE HAIR OF MICROPROSOPUS.470. FROM the skull of the Head (of Microprosopus) depend all those chiefs and leaders (otherwise, all thosethousands and tens of thousands), and also from the locks of the hair.471. Which are black, and mutually bound together, and which mutually cohere.472. But they adhere unto the Supernal Light from the Father, AB, Ab, which surroundeth His Head (i.e., thatof Microprosopus ); and unto the Brain, which is illuminated from the Father.473. Thencefrom, even from the light which surroundeth His Head ( i.e., that of Microprosopus) from theMother, Aima, and from the second Brain, proceed long locks upon locks (of hair). 474. And all adhere untoand are bound together with those locks which have their connection with the Father.475. And because (these locks are) mutually intermingled with each other, and mutually intertwined witheach other, hence all the Brains are connected with the Supernal Brain (of Macroprosopus).476. And hence all the regions which proceed from the Three Cavities of the Skull are mingled mutuallytogether, as well pure as impure, and all those accents and mysteries are as well hidden as manifest.477. And since all the Brains have a secret connection with the ears of Tetragrammaton, in the same way asthey shine in the crown of the Head, and enter into the hollow places of the Skull.478. Hence all these locks hang over and cover the sides of the ears, as we have elsewhere said.479. And therefore is it written, 2 Kings xix. 16: \"Incline, O Tetragrammaton, Thine ear, and hear!\"480. Hence is the meaning of this passage, which is elsewhere given: \"If any man wisheth the King to incline KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XII. CONCERNING THE HAIR OF MICROPROSOPUS.163"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"His ear unto him, let him raise the head of the King and remove the hair from above the ears; then shall theKing hear him in all things whatsoever he desireth.\"481. In the parting of the hair a certain path is connected with the (same) path of the Ancient of Days, andtherefrom are distributed all the paths of the precepts of the law.482. And over these (locks of hair) are set all the Lords of Lamentation and Wailing; and they depend fromthe single locks.483. And these spread a net for sinners, so that they may not comprehend those paths.484. This is that which is said, Prov. iv. 18: \"The path of the wicked is as darkness.\"485. And these all depend from the rigid locks hence also these are entirely rigid, as we have before said.486. In the softer (locks) adhere the Lords of Equilibrium, as it is written, Ps. xxv. 10: \"All the paths ofTetragrammaton are ChSD, Chesed, and AMTh, Emeth, Mercy and Truth.\"487. And thus when these developments of the Brain emanate from the Concealed Brain, hencefrom eachsingly deriveth its own nature.488. From the one Brain the Lords of Equilibrium proceed through those softer locks, as it is written: Ps. xxv.10: \"All the paths of Tetragrammaton are Chesed and Emeth.\"489. From the second Brain the Lords of Lamentation and Wailing proceed through those rigid locks anddepend (from them). Concerning whom it is written: Prov. iv. 19: \"The path of the wicked is as darkness;they know not wherein they stumble.\"490. What is this passage intended to imply? Assuredly the sense of these words, \"they know not,\" is this,\"They do not know, and they do not wish to know.\"491. \"Wherein they stumble.\" Do not read \"BMH, Bameh, wherein,\" but \"BAIMA, Be−Aima, in Aima, theMother,\" they stumble. That is, through those who are attributed unto the side of the Mother.492. What is the side of the Mother? Severe Rigour, whereunto are attributed the Lords of Lamentation andWailing.493. From the third Brain the Lords of Lords proceed through those locks arranged in the middle condition(i.e. partly hard and partly soft), and depend (therefrom); and they are called the Luminous and theNon−Luminous Countenances.494. And concerning these it is written, Prov. iv. 26: \"Ponder the path of thy feet.\"495. And all these are found in those locks of the hair of the Head.CHAPTER XIII. CONCERNING THE FOREHEAD OF MICROPROSOPUS.496. THE forehead of the Skull (of Microprosopus) is the forehead for visiting sinners (otherwise, for rootingout sinners).497. And when that forehead is uncovered there are excited the Lords of judgments against those who are KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XIII. CONCERNING THE FOREHEAD OF MICROPROSOPUS.164"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"shameless in their deeds.498. This forehead hath a rosy redness. But at that time when the forehead of the Ancient one is uncoveredover against this forehead, the latter appeareth white as snow.499. And that time is called the Time of Grace for all.500. In the \"Book of the Teaching of the School of Rav Yeyeva the Elder\" it is said: The forehead isaccording as the forehead of the Ancient One. Otherwise, the letter Cheth, Ch, is placed between the othertwo letters, according to this passage, Num. xxiv. 17: \"VMChTz, VeMachetz, and shall smite the corners ofMoab?\"501. And we have elsewhere said that it is also called NTzCh, Netzach, the neighbouring letters (M and N;neighbouring letters in the alphabet that is, and allied in sense, for Mem = Water, and Nun = Fish, thatwhich lives in the water) being counterchanged. ( Netzach = Victory, and is the seventh Sephira).502. But many are the NTzChIM, Netzachim, Victories; so that another (development of) Netzach may beelevated into another path, and other Netzachim may be given which are extended throughout the whole body(of Microprosopus).503. But on the day of the Sabbath, at the time of the afternoon prayers, the forehead of the Most HolyAncient One is uncovered, so that the judgments may not be aroused.504. And all the judgments are subjected; and although they be there, yet are they not called forth.(Otherwise, and they are appeased.)505. From this forehead depend twenty−four tribunals, for all those who are shameless in their deeds.506. And it is written, Ps. lxxiii. 11: \"And they have said, 'How can El know? and is there knowledge in theMost High?'\"507. But truly (the tribunals) are only twenty; wherefore are four added? Assuredly, in respect of thepunishments of the inferior tribunals which depend from the Supernals.508. Therefore there remain twenty. And therefore unto none do they adjudge capital punishment until heshall have fulfilled and reached the age of twenty years in respect of these twenty tribunals.509. But in our doctrine regarding our Arcana have we taught that the books which are contained in the Lawrefer back unto these twenty−four.CHAPTER XIV. CONCERNING THE EYES OF MICROPROSOPUS.510. THE Eyes of the Head (of Microprosopus) are those eyes from which sinners cannot guard themselves;the eyes which sleep, and yet which sleep not.511. And therefore are they called \"Eyes like unto doves, KIVNIM, Ke−Ionim.\" What is IVNIM, Ionim?Surely it is said, Lev. xxv. 17 \"Ye shall not deceive any man his neighbour.\"512. And therefore is it written, Psalm xciv. 7: \"IH, Yah, shall not behold.\" And shortly after verse 9: \"He thatplanteth the ear, shall He not hear? He that formeth the eye, shall He not see?\" KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XIV. CONCERNING THE EYES OF MICROPROSOPUS.165"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"513. The part which is above the eyes (the eyebrows) consisteth of the hairs, which are distributed in certainproportions.514. From those hairs depend one thousand seven hundred Lords of Inspection for striving in battles. Andthen all their emissaries arise and unclose the eyes.515. In the skin which is above the eyes (the eyelids) are the eyelashes, and there unto adhere thousandthousands Lords of Shields.516. And these be called the covering of the eyes. And all those which are called (under the classification of)the eyes of IHVH, Tetragrammaton, are not unclosed, nor awake, save in that time when these coverings ofthe eyelashes be separated from each other\u0014namely, the lower from the upper (eyelashes).517. And when the lower eyelashes are separated from the upper, and disclose the abode of vision, then arethe eyes opened in the same manner as when one awaketh from his sleep.518. Then are the eyes rolled around, and (Microprosopus) looketh back upon the open eye (ofMacroprosopus), and they are bathed in its white brilliance.519. And when they are thus whitened, the Lords of the judgments are turned aside from the Israelites. Andtherefore it is written, Ps. xliv. 24: \"Awake: wherefore sleepest thou, O Tetragrammaton? Make haste,\" &c.520. Four colours appear in those eyes; from which shine the four coverings of the phylacteries, which shinethrough the emanations of the Brain.521. Seven, which are called the eyes of Tetragrammaton, and the inspection, proceed from the black colourof the eye; as we have said.522. As it is written, Zach. iii. 9: \"Upon one stone seven eyes.\" And these colours flame forth on this side.523. From the, red go forth others, the Lords of Examination for Judgment.524. And these are called: \"The eyes of Tetragrammaton going forth throughout the whole earth.\"525. Where it is said (in the feminine gender) \"MShVTTVTh, Meshoteloth, going forth,\" and not\"MShVTTIM, Meshotetim,\" in the masculine, because all are judgment.526. From the yellow proceed others who are destined to make manifest deeds as well good as evil.527. As it is written, Job xxxiv. 21: \"Since His eyes are upon the ways of man.\" And these Zach. iv. 10, arecalled \"The eyes of Tetragrammaton, MShVTTIM, Meshotetim, going forth around, but in the masculinegender, because these extend in two directions\u0014towards the good and towards the evil. 528. From the whitebrilliance proceed all those mercies and all those benefits which are found in the world, so that through themit may be well for the Israelites.529. And then all those three colours are made white, so that He may have pity upon them.530. And those colours are mingled together mutually, and mutually do they adhere unto each other. Eachone affecteth with its colour that which is next unto it.531.

So therefore no man can convert all the inferior colours\u0014the black, red, and yellow\u0014into the whitebrilliance.533. For only with this glance (of Macroprosopus) are they all united and transformed into the whitebrilliance.534. His eyelashes (i.e., those of Microprosopus, for to the eye of Macroprosopus neither eyebrows noreyelashes are attributed) are not found, when (his eyes) desire to behold the colours; seeing that his eyelashesdisclose the place (of sight) for beholding all the colours.535. And if they disclose not the place (of vision) the ( eyes) cannot see nor consider. 536. But the eyelashes do not remain nor sleep, save in that only perfect hour, but they are opened and closed,and again closed and opened, according to that Open Eye (of Macroprosopus) which is above them.537. And therefore is it written, Ezek. i. 14: \"And the living creatures rush forth and return.\"538. Now we have already spoken of the passage, Isa. xxxiii. 20: \"Thine eye shall see Jerusalem quiet, evenThy habitation.\"539. Also it is written, Deut. ii. 12: \"The eyes of Tetragrammaton thy God are ever thereon in the beginningof the year,\" &c.540. For so Jerusalem requireth it, since it is written, Isa. i. 21: \"TzDQ, Tzedeq, justice abideth in Her.\"541. And therefore (is it called) Jerusalem, and not Zion. For it is written, Isa. i. 26: \"Zion is redeemed inMShPT, Meshephat , Judgment, &c.,\" which are unmixed mercies.542. Thine eye: (therefore) is it written \"OINK, Ayinakh (in the singular number). Assuredly it is the eye ofthe Most Holy Ancient One, the Most Concealed of All (which is here referred to).S43. Now it is said: \"The eyes of Tetragrammaton thy God are thereon;\" in good, that is to say, and in evil;according as either the red colour or the yellow is required.544. But only with the glance (of Macroprosopus) are all things converted and cleansed into the whitebrilliance.545. The eyelids (of Microprosopus) are not found when ( His eyes) desire to behold the colours. But here (itis said ), \"Thine eyes shall behold Jerusalem.\" Entirely for good, entirely in mercy.546. As it is written, Isa. liv. 7: \"And with great mercies will I gather thee.\"547. The eyes of Tetragrammaton thy God are ever thereon from the beginning of the year.\" Here the word\"MRShITh, Marashith, from the beginning,\" is written defectively without A, for it is not written RAShIThwith the A.548. Hence it remaineth not always in the same condition. What doth not? The inferior H, He, (of IHVH).549. And concerning that which is supernal it is written, Lam. ii. 1: \"He hath cast down MShMIM, KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XIV.

Wherefore hath he cast down Aretz from Shamaim? Because it is written, Isa. l. 3: \"I will cover theheavens, Shamaim, with darkness,\" and with the blackness of the eye (of Microprosopus), namely, with theblack colour, are they covered.551. \"From the beginning of the year.\" What, then, is that place whence those eyes of Tetragrammatonbehold Jerusalem?552. Therefore he hasteneth to expound this (saying immediately ): \"From the beginning, MRShITh, of theyear,\" which (word MRShITh = being written thus), without the Aleph, A, symbolizeth judgment; forjudgment is referred unto that side, although virtually (the word Merashith) is not judgment.553. \"Even unto the end of the year.\" Herein, properly speaking, is judgment found. For it is written, Isa. i.21: \"Justice dwelt in her.\" For this is \"the end of the year.\"554. Come and see! A, Aleph, only is called the first ( letter). In A, Aleph, is the masculine power hidden andconcealed; that namely, which is not known.555. When this Aleph is conjoined in another place then is it called RAShITh, Rashith, beginning.556. But if thou sayest that (A) is conjoined herewith, truly it is not so, but (A) is only manifested thereinand illuminateth it; and in that case only is it called RAShITh, Rashith , beginning.557. Now therefore in this (passage) RAShITh (spelt with the A) is not found as regards Jerusalem; for were(the letter A ) herein, it would (denote that it would) remain for ever. 558. Hence it is written defectivelyMRShITh, Me−Rashith. Also concerning the world to come it is written, Isa. xli. 27: \"The first shall say toZion, Behold, behold them,\" &c.CHAPTER XV. CONCERNING THE NOSE OF MICROPROSOPUS.559. THE nose of Microprosopus is the form of His countenance, for therethrough is His whole countenanceknown.560. This nose is not as the nose of the most Holy Ancient One, the Concealed with all Concealments.561. For the nose of Him, the Ancient One, is the life of lives for all things, and from His two nostrils rushforth the Ruachin De−Chiin , RVChIN DChIIN, spirits of lives for all.562. But concerning this (nose of) Microprosopus it is written, Ps. xviii. 9: \"A smoke ascendeth in His nose.\"563. In this smoke all the colours are contained. In each colour are contained multitudes of lords of mostrigorous judgment, who are all comprehended in that smoke.564. Whence all those are not mitigated save by the smoke of the inferior altar.565. Hence it is written, Gen. Viii. 21: \"And IHVH smelled a sweet savour.\" It is not written (He smelled) theodour of the sacrifice. What is \"sweet\" save \"rest?\" Assuredly the spirit at rest is the mitigation of the Lordsof judgment.566. (When therefore it is said) \"And IHVH smelled the odour of rest,\" most certainly the odour of the KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XV. CONCERNING THE NOSE OF MICROPROSOPUS.168"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"sacrificed victim is not meant, but the odour of the mitigation of all those severities which are referred untothe nose.567. And all things which adhere unto them, all things, I say, are mitigated. But most of these severitiesmutually cohere.568. As it is written, Ps. cvi. 2: \"Who shall recount GBVRVTh IHVH, the Geburoth of Tetragrammaton?\"569. And this nose (of Microprosopus) emitteth fire from the two nostrils, which swalloweth up all other fires.570. From the one nostril (goeth forth) the smoke, and from the other nostril the fire, and they both are foundon the altar, as well the fire as the smoke.571. But when He the most Holy Ancient One is unveiled, all things are at peace. This is that which is said,Isa. xlviii. 9: \"And for My praise will I refrain from thee\" (literally, \"block up thy nostrils\" ).572. The nose of the Most Holy Ancient One is long and extended, and He is called Arikh Aphim, Long ofNose.573. But this nose (of Microprosopus) is short, and when the smoke commenceth, it issueth rapidly forth, andjudgment is consummated.574. But who can oppose the nose of Him the Ancient One? Concerning this, all things are as we have said inthe Greater Assembly, where concerning this matter the Companions were exercised.575. In the book of the treatise of Rav Hamenuna the Elder he thus describeth these two nostrils (ofMicroprosopus), saying that from the one proceed the smoke and the fire, and from the other, peace and thebeneficent spirits.576. That is, when (Microprosopus) is considered as having ( in Himself the symbolism of) right side and leftside. As it is written, Hosea xiv. 7: \"And his smell like Lebanon.\"577. And concerning His Bride it is written, Cant. vii. 9: \"And the smell of thy nostril like apples.\" Which ifit be true concerning the Bride, how much more concerning Himself? And this is a notable saying.578. When therefore it is said, \"And Tetragrammaton smelled the odour of peace,\" the word HNIChCh,Ha−Nichach, of peace,\" can be understood in a double sense.579. One sense is primary, when the Most Holy Ancient One, the Concealed with all Concealments, ismanifested; for HVA, Hoa, He, is the peace and mitigation of all things.580. And the other respecteth the inferior mitigation, which is done through the smoke and fire of the altar.581. And because of this duplicate meaning is the word NIChCh, Nichach, written with a double Ch. And allthese things are said concerning Microprosopus.CHAPTER XVI. CONCERNING THE EARS OF MICROPROSOPUS.582. THERE are two ears for hearing the good and the evil, and these two can be reduced into one.583. As it is written, 2 Kings xix. 18: \"Incline, O Tetragrammaton, Thine ear, and hear.\" KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XVI. CONCERNING THE EARS OF MICROPROSOPUS.169"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"584. The ear from within dependeth upon certain curves which are therein formed, so that the speech may bemade clearer before its entrance into the brain.595. And the brain examineth it, but not with haste. For every matter which is accomplished in baste comethnot from perfect wisdom. 586. From those ears depend all the Lords of Wings who receive the Voice of theUniverse; and all those are called thus, the Ears of Tetragrammaton.587. Concerning whom it is written, Eccles. x. 20: \"For a bird of the air shall carry the voice,\" &c.588. \"For a bird of the air shall carry the voice.\" This text hath a difficult (meaning). And now (for so much isexpressed) whence is the voice?589. For in the beginning of the verse it is written: \"Curse not the King even in thy thought.\" Where it iswritten concerning even the ( unexpressed) thought, and concerning the secret thoughts of thy couch.590. Wherefore? Because \"a bird of the air shall carry the voice.\" Which (voice) as yet is unexpressed.591. Assuredly this is the true meaning. Whatsoever a man thinketh and meditateth in his heart, he makethnot a word until he bringeth it forth with his lips. (What the text intendeth is) if any man attendeth nothereunto.592. For that voice sent forward (from inconsiderate thought) cleaveth the air, and it goeth forth andascendeth, and is carried around through the universe; and therefore is the voice.593. And the Lords of Wings receive the voice and bear it on unto the King (Microprosopus), so that it mayenter into His ears.594. This is that which standeth written, Deut. v. 28: \"And Tetragrammaton hath heard the voice of yourwords.\" Again, Num. xi. 1: \"And Tetragrammaton heard, and His wrath was kindled.\"595. Hence every prayer and petition which a man poureth forth before God the Most Holy One−blessed beHe!\u0014requireth this, that he pronounce the words with his lips.596. For if he pronounce them not, his prayer is no prayer, and his petition is no petition.597. But as far as the words go forth, they cleave the air asunder, and ascend, and fly on, and from them is thevoice made; and that which receiveth the one receiveth also the other, and beareth it into the Holy Place in thehead of the King (otherwise, beneath Kether, the Crown).598. From the three cavities (of the brain of Microprosopus) distilleth a certain distillation, and it is called theBrook. As it is said in 1 Kings xvii. 3: \"The brook Kherith,\" as it were an excavation or channel of the ears.599. And the voice entereth into that curved passage, and remaineth in that brook of that distillation.600. And then is it therein detained, and examined, whether it be good or whether it be evil. This is the samewhich is said, Job. xxxiv. 3: \"Because the ear examineth the words.\"601. For what cause doth the ear examine the words? Because the voice is detained in that brook distillinginto the curved passage of the ears, and doth not swiftly enter into the body, and thereunto is an examinationinstituted between the good and the evil.

Because in the same manner itcauseth it to delay, and (the meat) doth not enter so rapidly into the body. And hence (the palate) proveth andtasteth it (to discern) whether it he sweet and pleasant.603. From this opening of the ears depend other openings (namely ) the opening of the eye, the opening of themouth, the opening of the nose.604. From that voice which entereth into the opening of the ears, if it be necessary (a certain part) enterethinto the openings of the eyes, and these pour forth tears.605. From that voice, if it be necessary (a certain part) entereth into the opening of the nose, and from thatvoice it produceth smoke and fire. 606. This is that which is written, Num. xi. i.: \"And Tetragrammatonheard, and His wrath was kindled, and the fire of Tetragrammaton turned against them.\"607. And if it be necessary that voice goeth forth into the opening of the mouth, and it speaketh, anddetermineth certain things.608. From that voice are all things: from that voice (a certain part) entereth into the whole body, and by it areall things affected. Whence doth this matter depend? From that ear.60g. Blessed is he who observeth his words. Therefore is it written, Ps. xxxiv. 13: \"Keep thy tongue fromevil, and thy lips from speaking guile.\"610. Unto this ear is attributed hearing, and under (the idea of ) hearing are those brains comprehended. 611. Chokmah is contained therein, as it is written, 1 Kings iii. 9: \"And wilt Thou give unto Thy servant ahearing heart.\"612. Binah also, as it is written, 1 Sam. iii. 9: \"Speak, for Thy servant heareth.\" Also 2 Kings xviii. 26:\"Because we have heard.\" And hencefrom all things depend.613. Däath also, as it is said, Prov. iv. 10, \"Hear, O my son, and receive My sayings.\" And again, ibid. ii. 1,\"Thou shalt hide My sayings with thee.\" And thereunto all things depend from the ears.614. From these ears depend prayers and petitions, and the opening of the eyes.615. This is the same which standeth written, 2 Kings xix. 16: \"Incline, O Tetragrammaton, Thine ear, andhear; open Thine eyes, and see. Thus all things depend hencefrom.616. From this ear depend the highest Arcana, which go not forth without, and therefore is (this ear) curvedin the interior parts, and the Arcana of Arcana are concealed therein. Woe unto him who revealeth the Arcana!617. And because the Arcana come into contact with this ear, and follow the curvings of that region, hencethe Arcana are not revealed unto those who walk in crooked paths, but unto those (who walk in ) those whichare not crooked.618. Hence is it written, Ps. xxv. 14: \"The SVD IHVH, Sod Tetragrammaton, Secret of Tetragrammaton, iswith them that fear Him, and He will show them His; covenant;\" namely, unto such as keep their path andthus receive His words.619.

And such men are called the shiners of their generation, hating God the Most Holy One−blessed be He.622. In Mischna, or our tradition, we have taught that such men are like unto murderers and idolaters.623. And all these things are contained in one saying, where it is written, Lev. xix. 26: \"Thou shalt not go upand down as a tale−bearer among thy people, neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: ANIIHVH, I am Tetragrammaton.\"624. Therefore he who transgresseth the first part of that verse doth the same as if he were to transgress thewhole.625. Blessed is the portion of the just, concerning whom it is said, Prov. xi. 13: \"A tale−bearer revealethsecrets, but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.\"626. \"Spirit, RVCh, Ruach,\" properly (is used here) for the Ruach of such is extracted from the SupernalHoly Place.627. Now we have said that this is a symbol. Whosoever revealeth Arcana with fixed purpose of mind, he isnot of the body of the Most Holy King.628. And therefore to such a man nothing is an Arcanum, neither is from the place of the Arcanum.629. And whensoever his soul departeth, the same adhereth not unto the body of the King, for it is not hisplace. \"Woe unto that man! woe unto himself! woe unto his Neschamah!\" 630. But blessed is the portion of the just who conceal secrets, and much more the Supernal Arcana of Godthe Most Holy One\u0014blessed be He!\u0014the highest Arcana of the Most Holy King.631. Concerning them it is written, Isa. lx. 21: \"Thy people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit theland for ever.\"CHAPTER XVII. CONCERNING THE COUNTENANCE OFMICROPROSOPUS.632. His countenance is as two abodes of fragrance, and all that I have said before is His testimony.633. For the testimony, ShDVThA, Sahedutha, dependeth from Him, and in all his testimony dependeth.634. But these places of fragrance are white and red; the testimony of Ab the Rather, and Aima the Mother;the testimony of the inheritance which He hath taken by right and obtained.635. And in our tradition we have also established by how many thousand degrees the whiteness differethfrom the redness.636. But yet at once they agree together in Him in one, under the general form of the whiteness; for KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XVII.

And then all things are found in judgment, and then (He putteth on) the vestments of zeal, which arecalled \"the garments of vengeance\" (Isa. lix. 17), and all things depend herefrom.639. And because the testimony existeth in all things, hence so many Lords of Shields are enshrouded bythose colours, and attend upon those colours.640. When those colours are resplendent, the worlds all and singular exist in joy.641. In that time when the white brilliance shineth all things appear in this colour; and when He appeareth inredness, similarly all things appear in that colour.CHAPTER XVIII. CONCERNING THE BEARD OF MICROPROSOPUS.642. IN those abodes (otherwise forms) of fragrance the beard beginneth to appear from the top of the ears,and it descendeth and ascendeth in the place of fragrance. 643. The hairs of the beard are black, and beautifulin form as in (that of) a robust youth.644. The oil of dignity of the supernal beard of the Ancient One ( floweth down) in this beard ofMicroprosopus.645. The beautiful arrangement of this beard is divided into nine parts. But when the most holy oil of dignityof the Most Holy Ancient One sendeth down rays into this beard, its parts are found to be twenty−two. 646. And then all things exist in benediction, and thence Israel the patriarch (i.e., Jacob) took his blessing.And the symbol of this is to be found in these words, Gen. xlviii. 20: \"BK, with the twenty−two, shall Israelbless.\" (The real translation of BK is \"in thee,\" but the numerical value of BK is twenty−two; hence thesymbolism here rendered.)647. We have described the conformations of the beard already, in the Conclave of the Assembly. Here also Idesire to enter upon this matter in all humility.648. Now we thus examined all the parts of the beard, that in the Conclave of the Assembly (we found) thatthey were all disposed from the parts of the beard of the Most Holy Ancient One.649. Six there are; nine they are called. For the first conformation goeth forth through that Spark of the mostrefulgent light−bearer, and goeth down beneath the hair of the head, assuredly beneath those locks whichoverhang the ears.650. And it descendeth before the opening of the ears unto the beginning of the mouth.651. But this arrangement is not found in the Most Holy Ancient One. But when that fountain of Wisdom,ChKMThA, Chokmatha, floweth down from MZLA, Mezla, the Influence of the Most Holy Ancient One,and dependeth from Him, and when Aima, the Mother, ariseth, and is included in that subtle ether, then She,Aima, assumeth that white brilliance.

And the Scintilla entereth and departeth, and together mutually are They bound, and thence cometh theOne Form.653. And when there is need, One ariseth above the Other, and the Other again. is concealed in the presenceof Its Companion.654. And therefore there is need of all things; of one thing for performing vengeance, of another for showingforth mercy.655. And therefore David the king hath sought out this beard, as we have shown already.656. In this beard nine conformations are found, (among which are ) six myriads which depend among them,and are extended throughout the whole body.657. And those six which depend hang in the locks which are beneath the abodes of fragrance, three on thisside and three on that.658. And in the ornamentation of the beard hang the three remaining ( conformations); one above the lips,and two in those locks which hang down upon the chest.659. And all those six (other conformations), three on this side and three on that side, go forth, and all dependfrom those locks which hang down, and they are extended throughout the whole body.660. But on account of those three (conformations), which are more connected with the ornament of the beardthan all the others, the Holy Name is written in its purity.661. When it is written thus. Ps. cxviii. 5: \"I invoked IH, Yah , in my trouble: IH, Yah, heard me at large:Tetragrammaton is with me, therefore I will not fear.\" 662. But that which we have already laid down in theConclave of the concerning these words, \"In my trouble I invoked IH, Yah,\" that this is to be referred to thatplace where the beard beginneth to be extended, which place is more remote, and before the ears, is alsocorrect.663. And in the book of the dissertation of the school of Rav Yeyeva the Elder it is thus said and established,that the beginning of the beard cometh from the supernal ChSD, Chesed, Mercy.664. Concerning which it is written, \"LK IHVH HGDVLH VHGBVRH VHThPARTh, Leka,Tetragrammaton, Ha−Gedulah, Ve−Ha−Geburah, Ve−Ha−Tiphereth, Thine, O Tetragrammaton, Gedulah(another name for Chesed), Geburah, and Tiphereth (the names of the fourth, fifth, and sixth Sephiroth, whichProtestants usually add to the end of the Lords Prayer, substituting, however, Malkuth for Gedulah), Thine,O Tetragrammaton, are the Mercy, the Power, and the Glory (or Beauty).\" And all these are so, and thus it(the beard) commenceth.665. Therefore the nine (conformations) arise from and depend from the beard; and thus it commenceth frombefore the ears. But ( the conformations) remain not in permanence save through another cause, as we havebefore laid down.666. For whensoever the universe hath need of mercy, the Influence, Mezla, of the Ancient one is uncovered;and all those conformations which exist in the most adorned beard of Microprosopus are found to be entirelymercies, yet so that they can exercise vengeance against the haters of the Israelites, and against those whoafflict them.

But the whole ornament of the beard consisteth in those locks which hang down, because all thingsdepend thencefrom.668. All those hairs which are in the beard of Microprosopus are hard and rigid, because they all subject thejudgments when the Most Holy Influence is manifested.669. And when there is to be contention, then He appeareth like unto a brave hero, victorious in war. Andthen that becometh bare of hair which is bare of hair, and that becometh bald which is bald.670. Moses commemorated these nine conformations a second time, Num. xiv. 17, when there was need toconvert them all into mercy.671. For although he recite not now the thirteen conformations ( of the beard of Macroprosopus), yet fromthis idea the thing depended; for he did not allow himself to enter into those conformations simply that hemight enumerate them.672. But unto the Influence directed he his meditation, and made mention thereof. As it is written, Num. xiv.117: \"And now, I beseech thee, let KCh, Kach, the Power of Tetragrammaton, be great! \"673. What is to be understood by KCh IHVH, Kach Tetragrammaton , the Power of Tetragrammaton? Thusis MZLA QDIShA, Mezla Qadisha , the Holy Influence, called, even the Concealed with all Concealments.And from the Influence that Strength and that Light depend.674. And since of this (Influence) Moses was speaking, and this (Influence) he was commemorating, andconcerning this ( Influence) he was meditating, he then immediately recited those nine conformations whichbelong unto Microprosopus.675. So that they all might exist in light, and that judgment might not be found therein. And therefore thiswhole judgment (otherwise, this whole beard) dependeth from the Influence.676. When the hairs begin to be restrained He Himself is as the hero of an army victorious in war.677. In this beard (of Microprosopus) floweth down the oil of dignity from the Concealed Ancient One, as itis said, Ps. cxxxiii, 2: \"Like excellent oil upon the head, descending upon the beard, the beard of Aaron.\"CHAPTER XIX. CONCERNING THE LIPS AND MOUTH OFMICROPROSOPUS.678. THOSE hairs cover not the lips, and the entire lips are red and rosy. As it is written, Cant. v. 13: \"Hislips as roses.\" (In the ordinary version ShVShNIM, Shushanim, is translated \"lilies,\" not \"roses.\")679. His lips murmur Geburah, Severity, but they also murmur Chokmah, Wisdom.680. From those lips alike depend good and evil, life and death.681. From these lips depend the Lords of Vigilance. For when those lips murmur, they all are excited to bringforth secret things, as well as the Lords of judgment in all the tribunals wherein they have their abiding−place.682. And therefore are these called the Watchers; as it is written, Dan. iv, 17: \"This matter is by the decree ofthe Watchers, and the demand by the word of the Holy Ones.\" KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XIX.

And, nevertheless, in each case is there mercy and judgment. And therefore is it said, Dan. iv. 13: \"Awatcher and a holy one;\" judgment and mercy.687. And between those lips when they are opened is the mouth disclosed.688. By that RVCh, Ruach, breath, which goeth forth from His mouth, many thousands and myriads areenshrouded; and when it is extended by the same are the true prophets enfolded, and all are called the mouthof Tetragrammaton.689. When forth from His mouth the words proceed through His lips, the same are muttered through thewhole circuit of eighteen thousand worlds, until they are all bound together at once in the twelve paths andthe known ways. And one thing ever expecteth another.690. By the tongue is the vocal expression of the sublime spoken, in the middle nexus of the utterance.691.

Hence we learn that the Masculine, taken alone, appeareth to be only half the body, so that all themercies are half; and thus also is it with the Feminine.719. But when They are joined together, the (two together) appear to form only one whole body,. And it is so.720. So also here. When the Male is joined with the Female, They both constitute one complete body, and allthe Universe is in a state of happiness, because all things receive blessing from Their perfect body. And thisis an Arcanum.721. And therefore it is said, Gen. ii. 3: \"Tetragrammaton blessed the seventh day and hallowed it.\" For thenall things are found (to exist) in the one perfect Body, for MTRVNIThA, Matronitha, the Mother (i.e., theInferior Mother) is joined unto the King, and is found to form the one Body with Him.722. And therefore are there found to be blessings upon this day. 723. And hence that which is not both Maleand Female together is called half a body. Now, no blessing can rest upon a mutilated and defective being,but only upon a perfect place and upon a perfect being, and not at all in an incomplete being. 724. And a semi−complete being cannot live for ever, neither can it receive blessing for ever.725. The Beauty of the Female is completed by the Beauty of the Male. And now have we established thesefacts (concerning the perfect equality of Male and Female), and they are made known unto the Companions.726. With this Woman (the inferior H) are connected all those things which are below; from Her do theyreceive their nourishment, and from Her do they receive blessing; and She is called the Mother of them all.727. Like as a mother containeth the body (of her child before birth), and that whole body deriveth itsnourishment from her. (Otherwise, containeth a garden, and the whole garden is from her.) Thus is She untoall the other inferiors.728. It is written, Prov. vii. 4: \"Say unto Chokmah, Thou art my sister.\" For there is given one Chokmah(Male), and there is also given another Chokmah (Female).729. And this Woman is called the Lesser Chokmah in respect of the other.730. And therefore is it written, Cant. viii. 8: \"We have a little sister and she hath no breasts.\"731. For in this exile (i.e., separated from the King) She appeareth unto us to be \"our little sister.\" At first,indeed, she is small, but she becometh great and greater, until she becometh the Spouse whom the Kingtaketh unto Himself.732. As it is written, Cant. viii. 10: \"I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers.\" KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XX.

CONCERNING THE REMAINING MEMBERS OFMICROPROSOPUS.734. THE Male is extended in right and left, through the inheritance which He receiveth (i.e., from Chokmahand Binah).735. But whensoever the colours are mingled together then is He called Tiphereth, and the whole body isformed into a tree (the Autz Ha−Chaiim, or Tree of Life), great and strong, and fair and beautiful, Dan. iv.11.736. \"The beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof,and all flesh was fed of it.\"737. His arms are right and left. In the right arm is Chesed and Life; in the left is Geburah and Death.738. Through Däath are His inner parts formed, and they fill the Assemblies and Conclaves, as we have said.739. For thus is it written: \"And through Däath shall the Conclaves be filled.\" 740. Afterwards is His bodyextended into two thighs, et intra hæc continentur duo renes, duo testiculi masculini.741. Omne enim oleum, et dignitas, et vis masculi e toto corpore in istis congregatur; nam omnes exercitus,qui prodeunt ab iis, omnes prodeunt et morantur in orificio membri genitalus.742. And therefore are they called Tzabaoth, the Armies; and they are Netzach (Victory, the seventh Sephira)and Hod (Glory, the eighth). For Tiphereth is Tetragrammaton, but Netzach and Hod are the armies; hencecometh that name, Tetragrammaton Tzabaoth.743. Membrum masculi est extremitas totius corporis, et vocatur Yesod, fundamentum, et hic est gradus illequi mitigat fœminam. For every desire of the Male is toward the female.744. Per hoc fundamentum ille ingreditur in fœminam in locum qui vocatur Tzion et Jerusalem. Nam hic estlocus tegendus fœminæ, et in uxore vocatur uterus.745. And hence is Tetragrammaton Tzabaoth called Yesod, the Foundation (the ninth Sephira). Also it iswritten, Ps. cxxxii. 13: \"Since Tetragrammaton hath chosen Tzion to be a habitation fur Himself, He hathdesired Her.\"746. When Matronitha, the mother, is separated, and conjoined with the King face to face in the excellence ofthe Sabbath, all things become one body.747. And then the Holy One\u0014blessed be He!\u0014sitteth on His throne, and all things are called the CompleteName, the Holy Name. Blessed be His Name for ever, and unto the ages of the ages.748. All these words have I kept back unto this day, which is crowned by them for the world to come. Andnow herein are they manifested, O blessed be my portion!749. When this Mother is conjoined with the King, all the worlds receive blessing, and the universe is found KABBALA DENUDATA: THE KABBALAH UNVEILEDCHAPTER XXII. CONCERNING THE REMAINING MEMBERS OF MICROPROSOPUS.179"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"to be in joy. 750. Like as the male (Microprosopus) existeth from the Triad (Kether, Chokmah, and Binah),and His beginning is with the Triad, in this same manner are all things disposed, and the end of the wholebody is thus; also the Mother (Inferior) receiveth not the blessing except in the Syntagma of the Triad, andthese paths are Netzach, Hod, and Yesod.751. And she is mitigated, and receiveth blessing in that place which is called the Holy of Holies below.752. As it is written, Ps. cxxxii. 3: \"Since there Tetragrammaton giveth His blessing.\" For there are two paths;that which is above, and that which is below.753. Hence there is permission granted unto none to enter therein, save unto the High Priest, who enterethfrom the side of Chesed, in order that none other might enter into that supernal place save that which is calledChesed.754. And He entereth into the Holy of Holies, and the Bride is mitigated, and that Holy of Holies receivethblessing, in the place which is called Tzion.755. But Tzion and Jerusalem are two paths, one denoting Mercy, and the other justice.756. For concerning Tzion it is written, Isa. i. 27: \"Through Meshephat, judgment, it is redeemed.\" Andconcerning Jerusalem it is written, ibid. 21: \"Justice, Tzedeq, abideth in Her,\" as we have before explained.757. And every desire of the Male is toward the Female. But thus are these called, because hence proceedblessings for all the worlds, and all things receive blessing.758. This place is called Holy, and all the holinesses; of the Male enter therein, through that path of which wehave spoken.759. But they all come from the supernal head of the Male skull, from that portion of the supernal brainwherein they reside.760. And this blessing floweth down through all the members of the body even unto those which are calledTzabaoth, the Armies. 761. And all that which floweth down throughout the whole body is congregatedtherein, and therefore are they called Tzabaoth, the Armies; because all the armies of the superiors andinferiors go forth therefrom.762. And that which floweth down into that place where it is congregated, and which is emitted through thatmost holy Yesod, Foundation, is entirely white, and therefore is it called Chesed.753. Thence Chesed entereth into the Holy of Holies as it is written, Ps. cxxxiii. 3: \"For thereTetragrammaton commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.\"764. Rabbi Abba said: \"Scarcely could the Holy Light−bearer ( i.e., Rabbi Schimeon) finish the word, 'life'before his words ceased altogether. But I was still writing them down, and thought that there would still bemore for me to write, but I heard nothing.765. \"But I raised not mine head, since the light around him was so great that hereunto I could not look thatway.766. \"Therefore I trembled, and I heard a Voice, which cried aloud and said, Prov. iii. 2: 'Length of days andyears of life,' &c.

But I tell upon my face on the ground, and cried aloud.770. When therefore the lire was withdrawn, I saw that that Holy Light−bearer, the Holy of the Holy Ones(i.e., Rabbi Schimeon) had been taken away from this world.771. \"But having been turned round, his body had fallen on his right side, and his face still bore a smile.772. \"And Rabbi Eleazar, his son, arose, and having taken his hands in his, kissed him; but I kissed the dustwhich was beneath his feet.773. The Companions wished to mourn for him, but they could not speak. Yet the Companions began toweep, and Rabbi Eleazar prostrated himself thrice, and could not open his mouth.774. At last he began, and said O my father! O my father! there were Three, and into One have theyreturned.775. \"Now shall the living creatures (the Cherubim) rush forth (from the Name); the birds shall fly upwardand hide themselves in the opening of the Great Sea, and all the Companions shall drink their blood.\"776. But Rabbi Chiya arose upon his feet and said: Hitherto hath the Holy Light−bearer (Rabbi Schimeon)taken care of us (otherwise, hath occupied himself with us). Now is the time not fitting for any other thingsave to pay him due honours.\"777. Therefore Rabbi Eleazar and Rabbi Abba arose, and put upon him the sepulchral garment; and who eversaw such a disturbance and mingled crowd of learned men? Through the whole house ascended fragrantodours ( of spices brought for the dead).778. Then they placed him in the coffin; and no man except Rabbi Eleazar and Rabbi Abba did these servicesfor him.779. But the lictors and soldiers came from Kaphar (otherwise, from Tzipori and Tardaia, or doctors andlearned men from the country). and drove them away. 780. But the inhabitants of Maronæa rescued them with great tumult, because they thought that he was not tobe buried there.781. When therefore the sepulchral bier was borne forth, he ( i.e., the body of Rabbi Schimeon) was raisedabove it in the air, and a fire flamed around him.782. And a Voice was heard (saying): \"Come ye and assemble together, and enter in unto the nuptials ofRabbi Schimeon. Isa. lvii.: 'Let him enter in with peace, and let them rest in their chambers.'\"783. When he was carried into the sepulchral cave, a Voice was heard in the cave saying: \"This is He whodisturbed the earth, and made the kingdoms tremble.\"784.
