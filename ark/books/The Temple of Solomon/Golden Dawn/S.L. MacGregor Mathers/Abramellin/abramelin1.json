MAC GREGOR MATHERS.WING perhaps to the circumstance that the indispensable “Baedecker”accords only a three or four line notice to the “Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal” –but few English or American visitors to Paris are acquainted with its name,situation, or contents, though nearly all know at least by sight the “BibliothèqueNationale” and the “Bibliothèque Mazarin”.This “Library of the Arsenal,” as it is now called, was founded as a privatecollection by Antoine René Voyer D'Argenson, Marquis de Paulny; and was firstopened to the public on the th Floréal, in the fifth year of the French Republic(that is to say, on th April, ), or just a century ago. This Marquis de Paulnywas born in the year , died in , and was successively Minister of War, andAmbassador to Switzerland, to Poland, and to the Venetian Republic. His lateryears were devoted to the formation of this Library, said to be one of the richestprivate collections known. It was acquired in  by the Comte D'Artois, andtoday belongs to the State. It is situated on the right bank of the Seine, in the Ruede Sully, near the river, and not far from the Place de la Bastille, and is known asthe “Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal”. In round numbers it now possesses , printedbooks, and about  manuscripts, many of them being of considerable value.Among the latter is this Book of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin, as deliveredby Abraham the Jew unto his son Lamech; which I now give to the public inprinted form for the first time.Many years ago I heard of the existence of this manuscript from a celebratedoccultist, since dead; and more recently my attention was again called to it by mypersonal friend, the well-known French author, lecturer and poet, Jules Bois, whoseattention has been for some time turned to occult subjects. My first-mentionedinformant told me that it was known both to Bulwer Lytton and Eliphas Levi, thatthe former had based part of his description of the Sage Rosicrucian Mejnour onthat of Abra-Melin, while the account of the so-called Observatory of Sir PhilipDerval in the “Strange Story” was to an extent copied from and suggested by that ofthe Magical Oratory and Terrace, given in the Eleventh Chapter of the SecondBook of this present work. Certainly also the manner of instruction applied byMejnour in “Zanoni” to the Neophyte Glyndon, together with the test of leavinghim alone in his abode to go on a short journey and then returning unexpectedly, isclosely similar to that employed by Abra-Melin to Abraham, with this difference,2"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Introductioniithat the latter successfully passed through that test, while Glyndon failed. It wouldalso be especially such experiments as those described at length in the Third Book,which the author of the “Strange Story” had in view when he makes Sir PhilipDerval in the MS. history of his life speak of certain books describing occultexperiments, some of which he had tried and to his surprise found succeed.This rare and unique manuscript of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin, fromwhich the present work is translated, is a French translation from the originalHebrew of Abraham the Jew. It is in the style of script usual at about the end of theseventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth centuries, and is apparently by thesame hand as another MS. of the Magic Of Picatrix 1 also in the “Bibliothèque deL'Arsenal”. I know of no other existing copy or replica of this Sacred Magic ofAbra-Melin, not even in the British Museum, whose enormous collection of OccultManuscripts I have very thoroughly studied. Neither have I ever heard bytraditional report of the existence of any other copy.2 In giving it now to the Public,I feel, therefore, that I am conferring a real benefit upon English and especiallyAmerican students of Occultism, by placing within their reach for the first time aMagical work of such importance from the Occult standpoint.The Manuscript is divided into three Books, each with its separate Title Page,surrounded by an ornamental border of simple design, in red and black ink, andwhich is evidently not intended to be symbolical in the slightest degree, but issimply the work of a conscientious caligraphist wishing to give an appearance ofcleanness and completeness to the Title Page.The wording of each is the same: “Livre Premier (Second or Troisième, asthe case may be) de la Sacrée Magie que Dieu donna à Moyse, Aaron, David,Salomon et à d’autres Saints Patriarches et Prophetes qui enseigne la vrayesapience Divine laissée par Abraham à Lamech son Fils traduite de l’hebreu”. I give the translated title at the commencement of each of the Three Books.On the fly-leaf of the original MS. is the following note in the handwriting ofthe end of the eighteenth century: —“This Volume contains  Books, of which here is the first. – The Abraham andthe Lamech, of whom there is here made question, were Jews of the fifteenthcentury, and it is well known that the Jews of that period possessing the Cabala ofSolomon passed for being the best Sorcerers and Astrologers.” Then follows inanother and recent hand:–  1 Probably the same as Gio Peccatrix the Magician, the author of many Manuscripts on Magic.2 Since writing the above, I have heard casually that a copy of at least part, or perhaps of the whole, issaid to exist in Holland."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Introductioniii“Volume composed of three parts–st part pages.ndrd ——June, .”The style of the French employed in the text of the MS. is somewhat vague andobscure, two qualities unhappily heightened by the almost entire absence of anyattempt at punctuation, and the comparative rarity of paragraphic arrangement.Even the full stop at the close of a sentence is usually omitted, neither is thecommencement of a fresh one marked by a capital letter. The following example istaken from near the end of the Third Book; “Cest pourquoy la premiere choseque tu dois faire principalement ates esprits familiers sera de leur commanderde ne tedire jamais aucune chose deuxmemes que lorsque tu les interrogerasamoins queles fut pour tavertir des choses qui concerne ton utilite outonprejudice parceque situ ne leur limite pas leparler ils tediront tant etdesigrandes choses quils tofusquiront lentendement et tu ne scaurois aquoytentenir desorte que dans la confusion des choses ils pourroient te faireprevariquer ettefaire tomber dans des erreurs irreparables ne te fais jamais prieren aucune chose ou tu pourras aider et seccourir tonprochain et nattends pasquil tele demande mais tache descavoir afond,” etc. This extract may be said togive a fair idea of the average quality of the French. The style, however, of the FirstBook is much more colloquial than that of the Second and Third, it beingespecially addressed by Abraham to Lamech, his son, and the second person singularbeing employed throughout it. As some English readers may be ignorant of the fact,it is perhaps as well here to remark that in French “tu,” thou, is only used betweenvery intimate friends and relations, between husband and wife lovers, etc.; while“vous,” you, is the more usual mode of address to the world in general. Again, insacred books, in prayers, etc., “vous” is used, where we employ \"thou\" as having amore solemn sound than “tu”. Hence the French verb “tutoyer,” = “to be veryfamiliar with, to be on extremely friendly terms with any one, and even to beinsolently familiar”. This First Book contains advice concerning Magic, and adescription of Abraham’s Travels and experiences, as well as a mention of the manymarvellous works he had been able to accomplish by means of this system of SacredMagic. The Second and Third Books (which really contain the Magic ofAbra-Melin, and are practically based on the two MSS. entrusted by him toAbraham, the Jew, but with additional comments by the latter) differ in style from"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Introductionivthe former, the phraseology is quaint and at times vague, and the second personplural, “vous,” is employed for the most part instead of “tu”.The work may then be thus roughly classified:First Book: = Advice and Autobiography; both addressed by the Authorto his son Lamech.Second Book: = General and complete description of the means ofobtaining the Magical Powers desired.Third Book: = The application of these Powers to produce an immensenumber of Magical results.Though the chapters of the Second and Third Books have special headings inthe actual text, those of the First Book have none; wherefore in the “Table ofContents” I have supplemented this defect by a careful analysis of their subjectmatter.This system of Sacred Magic Abraham acknowledges to have received from theMage Abra-Melin; and claims to have himself personally and actually wroughtmost of the wonderful effects described in the Third Book, and many others besides.Who then was this Abraham the Jew? It is possible, though there is no mentionof this in the MS., that he was a descendant of that Abraham the Jew who wrotethe celebrated Alchemical work on twenty-one pages of bark or papyrus, whichcame into the hands of Nicholas Flamel, and by whose study the latter is saideventually to have attained the possession of the “Stone of the Wise”. The onlyremains of the Church of Saint Jacques de la Boucherie which exists at the presentday, is the tower, which stands near the Place du Châtelet, about ten minutes’ walkfrom the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal; and there is yet a street near this tower whichbears the title of “Rue Nicolas Flamel,” so that his memory still survives in Paris,together with that of the Church close to which he lived, and to which, after theattainment of the Philosopher’s Stone, he and his wife Pernelle caused a handsomeperistyle to be erected.From his own account, the author of the present work appears to have beenborn in A.D. , and to have written this manuscript for his son, Lamech, in, being then in his ninety-sixth year. That is to say, that he was thecontemporary both of Nicholas Flamel and Pernelle, and also of the mysticalChristian Rosenkreutz, the founder of the celebrated Rosicrucian Order orFraternity in Europe. Like the latter, he appears to have been very early seized withthe desire of obtaining Magical Knowledge; like him and Flamel, he left his homeand travelled in search of the Initiated Wisdom; like them both, he returned tobecome a worker of wonders. At this period, it was almost universally believed that"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Introductionvthe Secret Knowledge was only really obtainable by those who were willing to quittheir home and their country to undergo dangers and hardships in its quest; andthis idea even obtains to an extent in the present day. The life of the late MadameBlavatsky is an example in point.This period in which Abraham the Jew lived was one in which Magic wasalmost universally believed in, and in which its Professors were held in honour;Faust (who was probably also a contemporary of our author), Cornelius Agrippa,Sir Michael Scott, and many others I could name, are examples of this, not tomention the celebrated Dr. Dee in a later age. The history of this latter Sage, hisassociation with Sir Edward Kelly, and the part he took in the European politics ofhis time are too well known to need description here.That Abraham the Jew was not one whit behind any of these Magicians inpolitical influence, is evident to any one who peruses this work. He stands a dimand shadowy figure behind the tremendous complication of central Europeanupheaval at that terrible and instructive epoch; as Adepts of his type always appearand always have appeared upon the theatre of history in great crises of nations. Theage which could boast simultaneously three rival claimants to the direction of twoof the greatest levers of the society of that era – the Papacy and the GermanicEmpire – when the jealousies of rival Bishoprics, the overthrow of Dynasties, theRoman Church shaken to her foundations, sounded in Europe the tocsin of thatfearful struggle which invariably precedes social reorganisation, that wildwhirlwind of national convulsion which engulfs in its vortex the civilisation of ayesterday, but to prepare the reconstitution of a morrow. The enormous historicalimportance of such men as our Author is always underrated, generally doubted;notwithstanding that like the writing on the wall at Belshazzar’s feast, theirmanifestation in the political and historical arena is like the warning of a Mene,Mene Tekel, Upharsin, to a foolish and undiscerning world.The full and true history of any Adept could only be written by himself, andeven then, if brought before the eyes of the world at large, how many persons wouldlend credence to it? and even the short and incomplete statement of the notableevents of our Author’s life contained in the First Book, will be to most readersutterly incredible of belief. But what must strike all alike is the tremendous faith ofthe man himself, as witnessed by his many and dangerous journeyings for so manyyears through wild and savage regions and places difficult of access even in our ownday with all the increased facilities of transit which we enjoy. This faith at lengthbrought him its reward; though only at the moment when even he was becomingdiscouraged and sick at heart with disappointed hope. Like his great namesake, theforefather of the Hebrew race, he had not in vain left his home, his “Ur of theChaldees,” that he might at length discover that Light of Initiated Wisdom, forwhich his soul had cried aloud within him for so many years. This culmination of"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Introductionvihis wanderings was his meeting with Abra-Melin, the Egyptian Mage. From himhe received that system of Magical instruction and practice which forms the body ofthe Second and Third Books of this work.In the Manuscript original this name is spelt in several different ways, I havenoted this in the text wherever it occurs. The variations are: Abra-Melin,Abramelin, Abramelim, and Abraha-Melin. From these I have selected theorthography Abra-Melin to place on the title page, and I have adhered to the samein this Introduction.As far as can be gathered from the text, the chief place of residence of Abrahamthe Jew after his travels was Würzburg, or, as it was called in the Middle Ages,“Herbipolis”. He appears to have married his cousin, and by her to have had twosons, the elder, named Joseph, whom he instructed in the Mysteries of the HolyQabalah, and Lamech, the younger, to whom he bequeaths this system of SacredMagic as a legacy, and to whom the whole of the First Book is addressed. He speaksfurther of three daughters, to each of whom he gave , golden florins as adowry. He expressly states that he obtained both his wife, and a treasure of,, golden florins, by means of some of the Magical Operations described inthe Third Book. He further admits that his first inclination to Qabalistical andMagical studies was owing to certain instructions in the Secrets of the Qabalah,which he received when young from his father, Simon; so that after the death of thelatter his most earnest desire was to travel in search of an Initiated Master.To the sincere and earnest student of Occultism this work cannot fail to be ofvalue, whether as an encouragement to that most rare and necessary quality,unshaken faith; as an aid to his discrimination between true and false systems ofMagic; or as presenting an assemblage of directions for the Production of Magicaleffects, which the Author of the book affirms to have tried with success.Especially valuable are the remarks of Abraham the Jew on the variousProfessors of the “Art which none may name” in the course of his wanderings andtravels; the account of the many wonders he worked; and, above all, the carefulclassification of the Magical Experiments in the Third Book, together with hisobservations and advice thereon.Not least in interest are the many notable Persons of that age for or againstwhom he performed marvels: The Emperor Sigismund of Germany: Count Fredericthe Quarreller: the Bishop of his city (probably either John I., who began thefoundation of the Würzburg University in  with the authorisation of PopeBoniface IX., or else Echter von Mespelbrunn, who completed the same noblework): the Count of Warwick: Henry VI. of England: the rival Popes – JohnXXIII., Martin V., Gregory XII., and Benedict XIII.: the Council of Constance: theDuke of Bavaria: Duke Leopold of Saxony: the Greek Emperor, Constantine"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"IntroductionviiPalaeologos: and probably the Archbishop Albert of Magdeburg: and also some ofthe Hussite Leaders – a roll of names celebrated in the history of that stirring time.Considering the era in which our Author lived, and the nation to which hebelonged, he appears to have been somewhat broad in his religious views; for notonly does he insist that this Sacred system of Magic may be attained by any one,whether Jew, Christian, Mahometan, or Pagan, but he also continually warnsLamech against the error of changing the religion in which one has been broughtup; and he alleges this circumstance as the reason of the occasional failures of theMagician Joseph of Paris (the only other person he mentions besides himself andAbra-Melin who was acquainted with this particular system of Magic), namelythat having been brought up a Christian, he had renounced that faith and becomea Jew. At first sight it does not seem clear from the Occult point of view whatparticular Occult disadvantage should be attached to such a line of action. But wemust remember, that in his age, the conversion to another religion invariablymeant an absolute, solemn and thorough renunciation and denial of any truth inthe religion previously professed by the convert. Herein would be the danger,because whatever the errors, corruption, or mistakes in any particular form ofreligion, all are based on and descended from the acknowledgment of SupremeDivine Powers. Therefore to deny any religion (instead of only abjuring themistaken or erroneous parts thereof ) would be equivalent to denying formally andceremonially the truths on which it was originally founded; so that whenever aperson having once done this should begin to practise the Operations of the SacredMagic, he would find himself compelled to affirm with his whole will-force thosevery formulas which he had at one time magically and ceremonially (thoughignorantly) denied; and whenever he attempted to do this, the occult Law ofReaction would raise as a Ceremonial Obstacle against the effect which he shouldwish to produce, the memory of that Ceremonial Denial which his previousrenunciation had firmly sealed in his atmosphere. And the force of this would be inexact proportion to the manner and degree in which he had renounced his formercreed. For of all hindrances to Magical action, the very greatest and most fatal isunbelief, for it checks and stops the action of the Will. Even in the commonestnatural operations we see this. No child could learn to walk, no student couldassimilate the formulas of any science, were the impracticability and impossibilityof so doing the first thing in his mind. Wherefore it is that all Adepts and GreatTeachers of Religion and of Magic have invariably insisted on the necessity of faith.But though apparently more broad in view in admitting the excellence ofevery religion, unfortunately he shows the usual injustice to and jealousy of womenwhich has distinguished men for so many ages, and which as far as I can see arisespurely and simply from an innate consciousness that were women once admitted tocompete with them on any plane without being handicapped as they have been for"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Introductionviiiso many centuries, the former would speedily prove their superiority, as theAmazons of old did; which latter (as the writings even of their especial enemies, theGreeks, unwillingly admit) when overcome, were conquered by superior numbers,not by superior valour. However, Abraham the Jew grudgingly admits that theSacred Magic may be attained by a virgin, while at the same time dissuading anyone from teaching it to her! The numerous advanced female occult students of thepresent day are the best answer to this.But notwithstanding the forementioned shortcomings, his advice on themanner of using Magical Power, when acquired, to the honour of God, the welfareand relief of our neighbour, and for the benefit of the whole Animate Creation, isworthy of the highest respect; and no one can peruse it without feeling that hishighest wish was to act up to his belief.His counsel, however, of a retired life after attaining Magical Power by hissystem (I do not speak of the retirement during the six months’ preparation for thesame) is not borne out by his own account of his life, wherein we find him soconstantly involved in the contests and convulsions of the time. Also, however muchthe life of a hermit or anchorite may appear to be advocated, we rarely, if ever, findit followed by those Adepts whom I may perhaps call the initiated andwonderworking medium between the Great Concealed Adepts and the OuterWorld. An example of the former class we may flnd in our Author, an example ofthe latter in Abra-Melin.The particular scheme or system of Magic advocated in the present work is toan extent “sui generis,” but to an extent only. It is rather the manner of itsapplication which makes it unique. In Magic, that is to say, the Science of theControl of the Secret Forces of Nature, there have always been two great schools, theone great in Good, the other in Evil; the former the Magic of Light, the latter thatof Darkness; the former usually depending on the knowledge and invocation of theAngelic natures, the latter on the method of evocation of the Demonic races.Usually the former is termed White Magic, as opposed to the latter, or BlackMagic.The invocation of Angelic Forces, then, is an idea common in works of Magic,as also are the Ceremonies of Pact with and submission to the Evil Spirits. Thesystem, however, taught in the present work is based on the following conception:(α) That the Good Spirits and Angelic Powers of Light are superior in power to theFallen Spirits of Darkness. (β) That these latter as a punishment have beencondemned to the service of the Initiates of the Magic of Light. (This Idea is to befound also in the Koran or, as it is frequently and perhaps more correctly written,“Qur-an”.) (γ) As a consequence of this doctrine, all ordinary material effects andphenomena are produced by the labour of the Evil Spirits under the command"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Introductionixusually of the Good. (δ) That consequently whenever the Evil Demons can escapefrom the control of the Good, there is no evil that they will not work by way ofvengeance. (ε) That therefore sooner than obey man, they will try to make himtheir servant, by inducing him to conclude Pacts and Agreements with them. (ζ)That to further this project, they will use every means that offers to obsess him. (η)That in order to become an Adept, therefore, and dominate them; the greatestpossible firmness of will, parity of soul and intent, and power of self-control isnecessary. (θ) That this is only to be attained by self-abnegation on every plane. (ι)That man, therefore, is the middle nature, and natural controller of the middlenature between the Angels and the Demons, and that therefore to each man isattached naturally both a Guardian Angel and a Malevolent Demon, and alsocertain Spirits that may become Familiars, so that with him it rests to give thevictory unto the which he will. (κ) That, therefore, in order to control and makeservice of the Lower and Evil, the knowledge of the Higher and Good is requisite(ie., in the language of the Theosophy of the present day, the knowledge of theHigher Self ).From this it results that the magnum opus propounded in this work is: bypurity and self-denial to obtain the knowledge Of and conversation with one’sGuardian Angel, so that thereby and thereafter we may obtain the right of usingthe Evil Spirits for our servants in all material matters.This, then, is the system of the Secret Magic of Abra-Melin, the Mage, astaught by his disciple Abraham the Jew; and elaborated down to the smallestpoints.Except in the professed Black Magic Grimoires, the necessity of the invocationof the Divine and Angelic Forces to control the Demons is invariably insisted uponin the operations of evocation described and taught in mediaeval MagicalManuscripts and published works. So that it is not so much, as I have before said,this circumstance, as the mode of its development by the Six Moons’ preparation,which is unusual; while again, the thorough and complete classification of theDemons with their offices, and of the effects to be produced by their services, is notto be found elsewhere.Apart from the interest attaching to the description of his travels, the carefulmanner in which Abraham has made note of the various persons he had metprofessing to be in the possession of Magical powers, what they really could do andcould not do, and the reasons of the success or failure of their experiments, has aparticular value of its own.The idea of the employment of a Child as Clairvoyant in the invocation of theGuardian Angel is not unusual; for example, in the “Mendal,” a style of OrientalDivination familiar to all readers of Wilkie Collins’ novel, “The Moonstone,” ink"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Introductionxis poured into the palm of a Childs hand, who, after certain mystical words beingrecited by the Operator, beholds visions clairvoyantly therein. The celebratedevocation at which the great Mediaeval Sculptor, Benvenuto Cellini, is said to haveassisted, also was in part worked by the aid of a Child as Seer. Cagliostro3 also issaid to have availed himself of the services of Children in this particular. But formy part I cannot understand the imperative necessity of the employment of a Childin the Angelic evocation, if the Operator be pure in mind, and has developed theclairvoyant faculty which is latent in every human being, and which is based onthe utilisation of the thoughtvision. This thought-vision is exercised almostunconsciously by everyone in thinking of either a place, person, or thing, which theyknow well; immediately, coincident with the thought, the image springs before themental sight; and it is hut the conscious and voluntary development of this which isthe basis of what is commonly called clairvoyance. Among the Highlanders ofScotland, the faculty, as is well known, is of common manifestation; and theEnglish it is usually spoken of as “by Second-Sight”.Unfortunately, like far too many modern Occultists, Abraham the Jew shows amarked intolerance of Magical systems differing from his own; even the renownedname of Petrus di Abano4 is not sufficient to save the “Heptameron or MagicalElements” from condemnation in the concluding part of the Third Book. Works onMagic, Written Conjurations, Pentacles, Seals, and Symbols, the employment ofMagical Circles, the use of any language but one's mother tongue, appear at firstsight to be damned wholesale, though on a more careful examination of the text Ithink we shall find that it is rather their abuse through ignorance of their meaningwhich he intends to decry, than their intelligent and properly regulated use.It will be well here to carefully examine these points from the occult standpointof an Initiate, and for the benefit of real students.Abraham in several places insists that the basis of this system of Sacred Magicis to be found in the Qabalah. Now, he expressly states that he has instructed hiseldest son, Joseph, herein as being his right by primogeniture, even as he himself hadreceived somewhat of Qabalistic instruction from his father, Simon. But this systemof Magic he bequeaths to his younger son, Lamech, expressly as a species ofrecompense to him for not being taught the Qabalah, his status as a younger sonbeing apparently a serious traditional disqualification. This being so, the reason isevident why he warns Lamech against the use of certain Seals, Pentacles,incomprehensible words, etc.; because most of these being based on the secrets of theQabalah, their use by a person ignorant hereof might be excessively dangerousthrough the not only possible but Probable Perversion of the Secret Formulas  3 See Appendix B.4 Born about 1250."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Introductionxitherein contained. Any advanced student of Occultism who is conversant withMediaeval works on Magic, whether MS. or printed, knows the enormous andincredible number of errors in the Sigils, Pentacles, and Hebrew or ChaldeeNames, which have arisen from ignorant transcription and reproduction; this beingcarried to such an extent that in some cases the use of the distorted formulas givenwould actually have the effect of producing the very opposite result to that expectedfrom them. (I have commented at length on this subject in my notes to the “Key ofSolomon,” published by me a few years ago.) Wherefore Abraham the Jew itappears to me, in his anxiety to save his son from dangerous errors in Magicalworking, has preferred to endeavour to fill him with contempt for any other systemsand methods of operation than the one here laid down. For also besides theunintentional perversions of Magical Symbols I have above mentioned, there wasfurther the circumstance not only possible but probable of the many Black MagicGrimoires falling into his hands, as they evidently had into Abraham's, the Symbolsin which are in many cases intentional perversions of Divine Names and Seals, soas to attract the Evil Spirits and repel the Good.For the Third Book of this work is crowded with Qabalistic Squares of Letters,which are simply so many Pentacles, and in which the Names employed are thevery factors which make them of value. Among them we find a form of thecelebrated Sator, Arepo, Tenet, Opera, Rotas, which is one of the Pentacles in the“Key of Solomon”. Abraham's formula is slightly different: —and is to be used for obtaining the love of a maiden.The Pentacle in my “Key of Solomon the King” is classed under Saturn, whilethe above is applied to the nature of Venus. I give the Hebrew form (see AppendixA, Table of Hebrew and Chaldee Letters) of Equivalents:"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"IntroductionxiiOr in Latin Letters:In the “Key of Solomon” it is (as being a Pentacle) inscribed within a doublecircle, wherein is written the following versicle from Psalm lxxii., v. 8 “Hisdominion shall be also from the one sea unto the other, and from the flood unto theworld’s end\". In the Hebrew, this versicle consists of exactly twenty five letters, thenumber of the letters of the square. It will be at once noticed that both this formand that given by Abraham the Jew are perfect examples of double Acrostics,that is, that they read in every direction, whether horizontal or perpendicular,whether backwards or forwards. But the form given as a Pentacle in the “Key ofSolomon the King” is there said to be of value in adversity, and for repressing thePride of the Spirits.This example therefore shows clearly that it is not so much the use of SymbolicPentacles that Abraham is opposed to, as their ignorant perversions andinappropriate use.It is also to be observed, that while many of the Symbolic Squares of Letters ofthe Third Book present the nature of the double Acrostic, there are also many whichdo not, and in the case of a great number the letters do not fill up the square"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Introductionxiiientirely, but are arranged somewhat in the form of a gnomon, etc. Others againleave the centre part of the square blank.In Appendix C 5 to the Introduction I will, for the sake of comparison, givesome examples of Angelic invocation taken from other sources.Abraham the Jew repeatedly admits, as I have before urged, that thisparticular System of the Sacred Magic of Abra-Melin has its Basis in the Qabalah.It is well to examine what is here meant. The Qabalah itself is divided into manyparts; the great bulk of it is of a mystic doctrinal nature, giving the inner Occultmeaning of the Jewish Sacred Writings. Also it employs the numerical values of theHebrew Letters, to draw analogies between words, the total numerical value ofwhose letters is the same; this branch alone is a most complicated study, and it willbe foreign to our purpose to go into it here; the more so as my work, the “KabbalahUnveiled,” treats at length of all these points. The so-called Practical Qabalah isthe application of the mystic teachings to the production of Magical effects. For theclassification of Divine and Angelic Names; of Hosts and Orders of Angels, Spiritsand Demons; of Particular Names of Archangels, Angels, Intelligences, andDemons, is to be found carried out even to minute detail in the Qabalah, so thatthe knowledge hereof can give a critical appreciation of the correspondences,sympathies, and antipathies obtaining in the Invisible World. Therefore whatAbraham means is, that this system of Sacred Magic is thoroughly reliable, becausecorrect in all its attributions, and that this being so, there is no chance of theOperator using Names and Formulas on wrong occasions and in error.But also it is notable that Abraham the Jew (probably again with the intent ofconfusing Lamech as little as possible) speaks only of two great classes of Spirits: theAngels and the Devils; the former to control, the latter to be controlled; and leavesentirely out of consideration, or rather does not describe that vast race of beings, theElemental Spirits, who in themselves comprise an infinitude of various divisions ofclassification, some of these being good, some evil, and a great proportion neitherthe one nor the other. Evidently, also, many of the results proposed to be attained inthe Third Book, would imply the use of the Elemental Spirits rather than that ofthe Demons. No advanced Adept, such as Abraham evidently was, could possibly beignorant of their existence, power, and value; and we are therefore forced toconclude either that he was unwilling to reveal this knowledge to Lamech; or,which is infinitely more probable, that he feared to confuse him by the largeamount of additional instruction which would be necessary to make himthoroughly understand their classification, nature, and offices. This latter line ofaction would be the less imperative, as the correctness of the symbols of the ThirdBook would minimise chances of error; and what Abraham is undertaking to teach  5 See Appendix C, “Examples of Angelic Invocation”"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"IntroductionxivLamech, is how to arrive at practical Magical results; rather than the SecretWisdom of the Qabalah.It is entirely beyond the scope of this Introduction for me to give here anylengthy dissertation on the natures, good or evil, of Spiritual beings. I will,therefore, only state briefly and concisely the principal differences between Angels,Elementals, and Devils.We may then conclude that Angels, though themselves divided into numerousorders and classes, possess generally the following characteristics: That they areentirely good in nature and operation, the conscient administrators of the DivineWill upon the plane of the material universe; that they are responsible, notirresponsible agents, and therefore capable of fall; and that they are independent ofthe currents of the infinite Secret Forces of Nature, and can therefore act beyondthem, though their classification and qualities will cause them to be moresympathetic with certain among these forces than with the rest, and this in varyingdegree. Also that they are superior in power to Men, Spirits, Elementals, andDevils.The Elementals on the other hand, though consisting of an infinitude ofclasses, are the Forces of the Elements of Nature, the administrators of the currentsthereof; and can therefore never act beyond and independently of their ownparticular currents. In a sense, therefore, they are irresponsible for the action of acurrent as a whole, though responsible for the part thereof in which theyimmediately act. Therefore also they are at the same time subject to the generalcurrent of the Force, wherein they live, move, and have their being; though superiorto the immediate and particular part of it which they direct. Such races, superior toman in intuition, and magical powers; inferior to him in other ways; superior tohim in their power in a particular current of an Element; inferior to him in onlypartaking of the nature of that one Element; are of necessity to be found constantlyrecurring in all the Mythologies of Antiquity. The Dwarfs and Elves of theScandinavians; the Nymphs, Hamadryads, and Nature Spirits of the Greeks; theFairies good and bad of the legends dear to our childish days the host of Mermaids,Satyrs, Fauns, Sylphs, and Fays; the Forces intended to be attracted and propitiatedby the Fetishes of the Negro-Race; are for the most part no other thing than theill-understood manifestations of this great class, the Elementals. Among these, some,as I have before observed, are good; such are the Salamanders, Undines, Sylphs, andGnomes, of the Rosicrucian Philosophy; many are frightfully malignant, delightingin every kind of evil, and might easily be mistaken for Devils by the uninitiated,save that their power is less; a great proportion are neither good nor evil,irrationally working either; just as a monkey or a parrot might act; in fact suchclosely resemble animals in their nature, and especially combinations of animals, inwhich forms distorted and mingled, would lie their symbolic manifestation."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"IntroductionxvAnother very large class, would not act irrationally in this manner; but withintent, only always following the predominant force either good or evil in theirthen entourage; a spirit of this kind, for example, attracted into an assembly ofgood persons would endeavour to excite their ideas towards good; attracted amongevil-minded persons would incite them mentally to crime. Among how manycriminals is not their only excuse that they “thought they kept hearingsomething telling them to commit the crime”! Yet these suggestions would notalways arise from Elementals alone, but frequently from the depraved astralremnants of deceased evil persons.Devils, on the other hand, are far more powerful than Elementals, but theiraction for Evil is parallel to that of the Good Angels for Good; and theirmalignancy is far more terrible than that of the Evil Elementals, for not being, likethem, subjected to the limits of a certain current, their sphere of operation extendsover a far greater area; while the Evil they commit is never irrational ormechanical, but worked with full consciousness and intent.I do not agree entirely with the manner of behaviour, advised by Abrahamtowards the Spirits; on the contrary, the true Initiates have always maintained thatthe very greatest courtesy should be manifested by the Exorciser, and that it is onlywhen they are obstinate and recalcitrant that severer measures should be resorted to;and that even with the Devils we should not reproach them for their condition;seeing that a contrary line of action is certain to lead the Magician into error. But,perhaps, Abraham has rather intended to warn Lamech against the danger ofyielding to them in an Exorcism even in the slightest degree.The word “Demon” is evidently employed in this work almost as a synonym ofDevil; but, as most educated people are aware, it is derived from the Greek“Daimon,” which anciently simply meant any Spirit, good or bad.A work filled with suggestive Magical references is the well-known “ArabianNights,” and it is interesting to notice the number of directions in the Third Bookof this work for producing similar effects to those there celebrated.For example, the ninth chapter of the Third Book gives the symbols to beemployed for changing human beings into animals, one of the commonest incidentsin the “Arabian Nights,” as in the story of the “first old man and the hind,” that ofthe “three Calendars and the five ladies of Bagdad,” that of “Beder and Giauhare,”etc., etc.; as distinct from the voluntary transformation of the Magician intoanother form, as exemplified in the “story of the Second Calendar,” the symbols forwhich are given in the twenty-first chapter of our Third Book.Again these chapters will recall to many of my readers the extraordinarymagical effects which Faust is said to have produced; who, by the way, as I havebefore remarked, was in all probability contemporary with Abraham the Jew."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"IntroductionxviBut the mode of their production as given in this work is not the Black Magicof Pact and Devil-worship, against which our Author so constantly inveighs, butinstead a system of Qabalistic Magic, similar to that of the “Key of Solomon theKing” and the “Clavicles of Rabbi Solomon,” though differing in the circumstanceof the prior invocation of the Guardian Angel once for all, while in the works Ihave just mentioned the Angels are invoked in each Evocation by means of theMagical Circle. Such works as these, then, and their like, it could not be theintention of Abraham to decry, seeing that like his system they are founded on theSecret Knowledge of the Qabalah; as this in its turn was derived from that mightyscheme of Ancient Wisdom, the Initiated Magic of Egypt. For to any deep studentat the same time of the Qabalah and of modern Egyptology, the root and origin ofthe former is evidently to be sought in that country of Mysteries, the home of theGods whose symbols and classification formed so conspicuous a part of the SacredRites; and from which even to the present day, so many recipes of Magic havedescended. For we must make a very careful distinction between the really AncientEgyptian Magic, and the Arabian ideas and traditions prevailing in Egypt inrecent times. I think it is the learned Lenormant who points out in his work onChaldean Magic, that the great difference between this and the Egyptian was thatthe Magician of the former School indeed invoked the Spirits, but that the latterallied himself with and took upon himself the characters and names of the Gods tocommand the Spirits by, in his Exorcism; which latter mode of working would notonly imply on his part a critical knowledge of the nature and power of the Gods;but also the affirmation of his reliance upon them, and his appeal to them for aidto control the forces evoked; in other words, the most profound system of WhiteMagic which it is possible to conceive.The next point worthy of notice is what Abraham urges regarding thepreferability of employing one's mother tongue both in prayer and evocation; hischief reason being the absolute necessity of comprehending utterly and thoroughlywith the whole soul and heart, that which the lips are formulating. While fullyadmitting the necessity of this, I yet wish to state some reasons in favour of theemployment of a language other than one's own. Chief, and first, that it aids themind to conceive the higher aspect of the Operation; when a different language andone looked upon as sacred is employed, and the phrases in which do not thereforesuggest matters of ordinary life. Next, that Hebrew, Chaldee, Egyptian, Greek,Latin, etc., if properly pronounced are more sonorous in vibration than mostmodern languages, and from that circumstance can suggest greater solemnity. Alsothat the farther a Magical Operation is removed from the commonplace, the better.But I perfectly agree with Abraham, that it is before all things imperative that theOperator should thoroughly comprehend the import of his Prayer or Conjuration."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"IntroductionxviiFurthermore the words in these ancient languages imply “formulas ofcorrespondences” with more ease than those of the modern ones.Pentacles and Symbols are valuable as an equilibrated and fitting basis for thereception of Magical force; but unless the Operator can really attract that force tothem, they are nothing but so many dead, and to him worthless, diagrams. Butused by the Initiate who fully comprehends their meaning, they become to him apowerful protection and aid, seconding and focussing the workings of his Will.At the risk of repeating what I have elsewhere said, I must caution the Occultstudent against forming a mistaken judgment from what Abraham the Jew saysregarding the use of Magic Circles and of Licensing the Spirits to Depart. It is truethat in the Convocation of the Spirits as laid down by him, it is not necessary toform a Magic Circle for defence and protection; but why? — Because the wholegroup of the Bedchamber, Oratory, and Terrace, are consecrated by thepreparatory Ceremonies of the previous Six Moons; so that the whole place isprotected, and the Magician is, as it were, residing constantly within a MagicCircle. Therefore also the Licensing to Depart may be to a great extent dispensedwith because the Spirits cannot break into the consecrated limit of the periphery ofthe walls of the house. But let the worker of ordinary Evocations be assured thatwere this not so, and the Convocation was performed in an unconsecrated place,without any Magical Circle having been traced for defence, the invocation tovisible appearance of such fearful Potencies as Amaymon, Egyn, and Beelzebub,would probably result in the death of the Exorcist on the spot; such death presentingthe symptoms of one arising from Epilepsy, Apoplexy, or Strangulation, varyingwith the conditions obtaining at the time. Also the Circle having been once formed,let the Evocator guard carefully against either passing, or stooping, or leaningbeyond, its limits during the progress of the Exorcism, before the license to departhas been given. Because that, even apart from other causes, the whole object andeffect of the Circle working, is to create abnormal atmospheric conditions, byexciting a different status of force within the Circle to that which exists without it;so that even without any malignant occult action of the Spirits, the sudden andunprepared change of atmosphere will seriously affect the Exorciser in the intenselystrained state of nervous tension he will then be in. Also the License to Departshould not be omitted, because the Evil Forces will be only too glad to revengethemselves on the Operator for having disturbed them, should he incautiously quitthe Circle without having previously sent them away, and if necessary even forcedthem to go by contrary conjurations.I do not share Abraham’s opinion as to the necessity of withholding theOperation of this Sacred Magic from a Prince or Potentate. Every great system ofOccultism has its own Occult Guards, who will know how to avenge mistakentampering therewith."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"IntroductionxviiiAt the risk of repeating myself I will once more earnestly caution the Studentagainst the dangerous automatic nature of certain of the Magical Squares of theThird Book; for, if left carelessly about, they are very liable to obsess sensitivepersons, children, or even animals.Abraham’s remarks concerning the errors of Astrology in the common sense,and of the attribution of the Planetary Hours are worthy of careful note.

On his trial at Rome in , and at Zurich in ,he was accused of “having practised all kinds of impositions; of gold making,and of possessing the secret of prolonging life; of teaching Cabalistic Arts; ofsummoning and exorcising Spirits; of having actually foretold future thingsespecially in small and secret assemblies, and chiefly by means of a little boywhom he took aside with him into a separate room, in order to fit him fordivining”.With regard to the manner in which he employed this Child-Clairvoyant,the documents of the trial give the following information:– “This Child had tokneel before a small table, on which a vessel of water and some lighted candleswere placed. He then instructed the boy to look into the vessel of water, and socommenced his conjurations; he next laid his hand on the head of the Child,and in this position addressed a prayer to God for a successful issue of theexperiment. The Child now became clairvoyant, and said at first that he sawsomething white; then that he saw visions, an Angel, etc.”Again the documents say, “That he worked through the usual ceremonies,and that all was wonderfully corroborated through the appearance of theAngel”.Cagliostro is also said at Milan to have availed himself of the services ofan orphan maiden of marriageable age as clairvoyant.It will be remarked that this modus operandi differs strongly from thatemployed by the mesmerists and hypnotists of to-day with their clairvoyants. Forhere the whole force of the Operator was concentrated on a magical ritual ofevocation, the hand being merely laid on the child’s head to form a link; and itin no way appears that the child was reduced to the miserable condition ofautomatic trance now practised, and which a really advanced Occultist wouldbe the first to condemn, as knowing its dangers.On the other hand, there seems to be a distinct similarity betweenCagliostro's method, and the system of Oriental Divination called the Mendal,to which I have previously referred."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Introductionxxi(APPENDIX C.)examples of other methods of angelic evocation.For the benefit of the Occult Student I here give two other systems ofAngelic Evocation.

For there is nothing more deplorable andmore unworthy in a man than to find himself ignorant in all circumstances.He who worketh and travelleth learneth much and he who knoweth not howto conduct and govern himself when far from his native land, will know stillless in his own house how to do so. I dwelt then, after the death of my father,for four years with my brothers and sisters, andIstudied with care how to putto a profitable use what my father had left me after his death; and seeing thatmy means were insufficient to counterbalance the expenses which I wascompelled to be at, after having set in order all my affairs and business as wellas my strength permitted; I set out, and I went into Vormatia9 to Mayence, inorder to find there a very aged Rabbi named Moses, in the hope that I hadfound in him that which I sought. As I have said in the preceding chapter, hisScience had no foundation such as that of the True Divine Wisdom. Iremained with him for four years,10 miserably wasting all that time there, andpersuading myself that I had learned all that I wished to know, and I was onlythinking of returning to my paternal home, when I casually met a young manof our sect, named Samuel, a native of Bohemia, whose manners and mode oflife showed me that he wished to live, walk, and die in the Way of the Lordand in His Holy Law; and I contracted so strong a bond of friendship withhim that I showed him all my feelings and intentions. As he had resolved tomake a journey to Constantinople, in order to there join a brother of hisfather, and thence to pass into the Holy Land wherein our forefathers haddwelt, and from the which for our very great errors and misdeeds we had beenchased and cast forth by God. He11 having so willed it, the moment that he12had made me acquainted with his design, I felt an extraordinary desire toaccompany him in his journey, and I believe that Almighty God wished by thismeans to awaken me, for I could take no rest until the moment that wemutually and reciprocally passed our word to each other and swore to makethe voyage together.On the th day of February, in the year , we commenced ourjourney, passing through Germany, Bohemia, Austria, and thence by Hungary,"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Sacred Magic6and Greece unto Constantinople, where we remained two years, and I shouldnever have quitted it, had not death taken Samuel from me at length through asudden illness. Finding myself alone, a fresh desire for travel seized me, and somuch was my heart given thereto, that I kept wandering from one place toanother, until at length I arrived in Egypt, where constantly travelling for thespace of four years in one direction and another, the more I practised theexperiments of the magic of Rabbin Moses, the less did it please me. I pursuedmy voyage towards our ancient country, where I fixed my residence for a year,and neither saw nor heard of any other thing but misery, calamity, andunhappiness. After this period of time, I there found a Christian who also wastravelling in order to find that which I was seeking also myself. Having madean agreement together, we resolved to go into the desert parts of Arabia for thesearch for that which we ardently desired; feeling sure that, as we had beentold, there were in those places many just and very learned men, who dweltthere in order to be able to study without any hindrance, and to devotethemselves unto that Art for which we ourselves were seeking; but as we therefound nothing equivalent to the trouble we had taken, or which was worthy ofour attention, there came into my head the extravagant idea to advance nofarther, but to return to my own home. I communicated my intention to mycompanion, but he for his part wished to follow out his enterprise and seek hisgood fortune; so I prepared to return."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Of Abramelin the Mage7THE FOURTH CHAPTERN my return journey I began to reflect on the time which I had lost intravelling, and on the great expense which I had been at without anyreturn, and without having made any acquisition of that which Iwished for and which had caused me to undertake the voyage. I had, however,taken the resolution of returning to my home on quitting Arabia Deserta byway of Palestine, and so into Egypt; and I was six months on the way. I atlength arrived at a little town called Arachi, situated on the bank of the Nile,where I lodged with an old Jew named Aaron, where indeed I had alreadylodged before in my journey; and I communicated unto him my sentiments.He asked me how I had succeeded, and whether I had found that which Iwished. I answered mournfully that I had done absolutely nothing, and I madehim an exact recital of the labours and troubles which I had undergone, andmy recital was accompanied by my tears which I could not help shedding inabundance, so that I attracted the compassion of the old man, and he began totry to comfort me by telling me that during my journey he had heard say thatin a desert place not far from the aforesaid town of Arachi dwelt a verylearned and pious man whose name was Abramelino,13 and he14 exhorted methat as I had already done so much, not to fail to visit him, that perhaps theMost Merciful God might regard me with pity, and grant me that which Irighteously wished for, It seemed to me as though I was listening to a Voice,not human but celestial, and I felt a joy in mine heart such as I could notexpress; and I had neither rest nor intermission until Aaron found me a manwho conducted me to the nearest route, by which walking upon fine sandduring the space of three days and a half without seeing any human habitationI at length arrived at the foot of a hill of no great height, and which wasentirely surrounded by trees. My Guide then said: – “In this small wooddwelleth the man whom you seek;” and having showed me the direction totake he wished to accompany me no further, and having taken his leave of mehe returned home by the same route by which we had come, together with hismule which had served to carry our food. Finding myself in this situation Icould think of no other thing to do than to submit myself to the help of theDivine Providence by invoking His very holy Name, Who then granted untome His most holy Grace, for in turning my eyes in the aforementioneddirection, I beheld coming towards me a venerable aged Man, who saluted mein the Chaldean language in a loving manner, inviting me to go with him intohis habitation; the which courtesy I accepted with an extreme pleasure,realising in that moment how great is the Providence of the Lord. The good2"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Sacred Magic8old Man was very courteous to me and treated me very kindly, and during aninfinitude of days he never spake unto me of any other matter than of the Fearof God, exhorting me to lead ever a well-regulated life, and from time to timewarned me of certain errors which man commits through human frailty, and,further, he made me understand that he detested the acquisition of riches andgoods which we were constantly employed in gaining in our towns through sosevere usury exacted from, and harm wrought to, our neighbour. He requiredfrom me a very solemn and precise promise to change my manner of life, andto live not according to our false dogmas, but in the Way and Law of the Lord.The which promise I having ever after inviolably observed, and being later onagain among my relatives and other Jews, I passed among them for a wickedand foolish man; but I said in myself: “Let the Will of God be done, and letnot respect of persons turn us aside from the right path, seeing that man is adeceiver”.The aforesaid Abramelin, knowing the ardent desire which I had tolearn, he gave me two manuscript books, very similar in form unto thesewhich I now bequeath unto thee, O Lamech, my son; but very obscure: and hetold me to copy them for myself with care, which I did, and carefullyexamined both the one and the other. And he asked me if I had any money, Ianswered unto him “Yes”. He said unto me that he required ten golden florins,which he must himself, according to the order which the Lord had given untohim, distribute by way of alms among seventy-two poor persons, who wereobliged to repeat certain Psalms;15 and having kept the feast of Saturday, whichis the day of the Sabbath, he set out to go to Arachi, because it was requisitethat he should himself distribute the money. And he ordered me to fast forthree days, that is to say, the Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday following;contenting myself with only a single repast in the day, wherein was to beneither blood nor dead things;16 also he commanded me to make thiscommencement with exactness, and not to fail in the least thing, for in orderto operate well it is very necessary to begin well, and he instructed me torepeat all the seven17 psalms of David one single time in these three days; andnot to do or practise any servile operation. The day being come he set out, andtook with him the money which I had given him. I faithfully obeyed him,executing from point to point that which he had ordered me to do. His returnwas fifteen days later, and being at last arrived he ordered me the day following(which was a Tuesday), before the rising of the Sun, to make with greathumility and devotion a general confession of all my life unto the Lord, with atrue and firm proposal and resolution to serve and fear Him otherwise than Ihad done in the past, and to wish to live and die in His most Holy Law, and inobedience unto Him. I performed my confession with all the attention and"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Of Abramelin the Mage9exactitude necessary. It lasted until the going down of the Sun; and the dayfollowing I presented myself unto Abramelin, who with a smilingcountenance said unto me: “It is thus I would ever have you”. He thenconducted me into his own apartment where I took the two little manuscriptswhich I had copied; and he asked of me whether truly, and without fear, Iwished for the Divine Science and for the True Magic. I answered unto himthat it was the only end and unique motive which had induced me toundertake a so long and troublesome voyage, with the view of receiving thisspecial grace from the Lord. “And I,” said Abramelin, “trusting in the mercyof the Lord, I grant and accord unto thee this Holy Science, which thou mustacquire in the manner which is prescribed unto thee in the two littlemanuscript books, without omitting the least imaginable thing of theircontents; and not in any way to gloss or comment upon that which may be ormay not be, seeing that the Artist who hath made that work is the same GodWho from Nothingness hath created all things. Thou shalt in no way use thisSacred Science to offend the Great God, and to work ill unto thy neighbour;thou shalt communicate it unto no living person whom thou dost notthoroughly know by long practice and conversation, examining well whethersuch a person really intendeth to work for the Good or for the Evil. And ifthou shalt wish to grant it unto him, thou shalt well observe and punctually,the same fashion and manner, which I have made use of with thee. And if thoudoest otherwise, he who shall receive it shall draw no fruit therefrom. Keepthyself as thou wouldst from a Serpent from selling this Science, and frommaking merchandise of it; because the Grace of the Lord is given unto us freeand gratis, and we ought in no wise to sell the same. This Veritable Scienceshall remain in thee and thy generation for the space of seventy-two18 years,and will not remain longer in our Sect. Let not thy curiosity push thee on tounderstand the cause of this, but figure to thyself that we are so good19 – thatour Sect hath become insupportable not only to the whole human race, buteven to God Himself !” I wished in receiving these two small manuscriptbooks to throw myself on my knees before him, but he rebuked me, sayingthat we ought only to bend the knee before God.I avow that these two books20 were so exactly written, that thou, OLamech my son, mayest see them after my death, and thou shalt thusrecognise how much respect I have for thee.21 It is true that before mydeparture I well read and studied them, and when I found anything difficult orobscure I had recourse unto Abramelin, who with charity and patienceexplained it unto me. Being thoroughly instructed, I took leave of him, andhaving received his paternal blessing; a symbol which is not only in use amongthe Christians, but which was also the custom with our forefathers; I also"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Sacred Magic10departed, and I took the route to Constantinople, whither having arrived I fellsick, and my malady lasted for the space of two months; but the Lord in HisMercy delivered me therefrom, so that I soon regained my strength, andfinding a vessel ready to depart for Venice I embarked thereon, and I arrivedthere, and having rested some days I set out to go unto Trieste, where havinglanded, I took the road through the country of Dalmatia, and arrived at lengthat my paternal home, where I lived among my relatives and my brothers."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Of Abramelin the Mage11THE FIFTH CHAPTER.T is not sufficient to travel and journey abroad and see many lands, if onedoes not draw some useful experience therefrom. Wherefore, in order toshow unto thee a good example, I will in this chapter speak of theMysteries22 of this Art which I discovered in one way and another whiletravelling in the world, and also of the measure and understanding of theirvarious sciences; while, in the Sixth Chapter following, I will recount thethings which I have learned and seen with some among them, and whether inactual practice I found them true or false. I have already before told you thatmy first Master had been the Rabbin Moses at Mayence, who was indeed agood man, but entirely ignorant of the True Mystery and of the VeritableMagic. He only devoted himself to certain superstitious secrets which he hadcollected from various infidels, and which were full of the nonsense andfoolishness of Pagans and Idolaters; to such an extent that the Good Angelsand Holy Spirits judged him unworthy of their visits and conversation; andthe Evil Spirits mocked him to a ridiculous extent. At times, indeed, theyspake to him voluntarily and by caprice, and obeyed him in matters vile,profane, and of no account, in order the better to entrap, deceive and hinderhim from searching further for the true and certain Foundation of this GreatScience.At Argentine I found a Christian called James, who was reputed as alearned and very skilful man; but his Art was the Art of the juggler, or Cupand Balls Player; and not that of the Magician.In the town of Prague I found a wicked man named Antony, agedtwenty-five years, who in truth showed me wonderful and supernatural things,but may God preserve us from falling into so great an error, for the infamouswretch avowed to me that he had made a Pact with the Demon, and had givenhimself over to him in body and in soul, and that he had renounced God andall the Saints; while, on the other hand, the deceitful Leviathan had promisedhim forty years of life to do his pleasure. He made every effort, as he wasobliged to by the Pact, to persuade me and drag me to the precipice of thesame error and misery; but at first I kept myself apart from him, and at last Itook flight. Unto this day do they sing in the streets of the terrible end whichbefel him, may the Lord God of His Mercy preserve us from such amisfortune. This should serve us as a mirror of warning to keep far from us allevil undertakings and pernicious curiosity.In Austria I found an infinitude, but all were either ignorant, or likeunto the Bohemians.,"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Sacred Magic12In the Kingdom of Hungary I found but persons knowing neither Godnor Devil, and who were worse than the beasts.In Greece I found many wise and prudent men, but, however, all ofthem were infidels, among whom there were three who principally dwelt indesert places, who showed unto me great things, such as how to raise tempestsin a moment, how to make the Sun appear in the night, how to stop thecourse of rivers, and how to make night appear at mid-day, the whole by thepower of their enchantments, and by applying superstitious ceremonies.Near Constantinople, in a place called Ephiha, there was a certainman, who, instead of Enchantments, made use of certain numbers which hewrote upon the earth; and by means of these he caused certain extravagant andterrifying visions to appear; but in all these Arts there was no practical use, butonly the loss of soul and of body, because all these only worked by particularPacts, which had no true foundation; also all these Arts demanded a very longspace of time, and they were very false, and when these men were unsuccessfulthey had always ready a thousand lies and excuses.In the same City Of Constantinople I found two men of our Law,namely, Simon and the Rabbin Abrahame, whom we may class with RabbinMoses Of Mayence.In Egypt the first time I found five persons who were esteemed andreputed as wise men, among whom were four, namely, Horay, Abimech,Alcaon, and Orilach, who performed their operations by the means of thecourse of the Stars and of the Constellations, adding many DiabolicalConjurations and impious and profane prayers, and performing the wholewith great difficulty. The fifth, named Abimelu, operated by the means andaid of Demons, to whom he prepared statues, and sacrificed, and thus theyserved him with their abominable arts.In Arabia they made use of plants, of herbs, and of stones as well preciousas common. The Divine Mercy inspired me to return thence, and led me toAbramelin, who was he who declared unto me the Secret, and opened untome the fountain and true source of the Sacred Mystery, and of the Veritableand Ancient Magic which God had given unto our forefathers.Also at Paris I found a wise man called Joseph, who, having denied theChristian faith, had made himself a Jew. This man truly practised Magic in thesame manner as Abramelin, but he was very far from arriving at perfectiontherein; because God, Who is just, never granteth the perfect, veritable andfundamental treasure unto those who deny Him; notwithstanding that in therest of their life they might be the most holy and perfect men in the world.

But the Truth is so great, the Devil is so deceitful andmalicious, and the World so frail and so infamous that I must admit thatthings cannot be otherwise. Let us then open our eyes, and follow that which Ishall lay down in the following chapters; and let us not walk in another Path,whether of the Devil, or of men, or of Books which boast of their Magic; forin truth I declare unto thee that I had so great a quantity of such matterswritten out with so much Art, that had I not had these of Abramelin, I couldherein have given thee those. However, it is true that just as there is only oneGod, that not one of these Books is worth an obolus.23 Yet with all this thereare men so blind that they buy them at exorbitant prices, and they lose theirmoney, their time, and their pains, and which is worse, very often their soulsas well."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The Sacred Magic14THE SIXTH CHAPTER.HE Fear of the Lord is the True Wisdom, and he who hath it not can inno way penetrate the True Secrets of Magic, and he but buildeth upon afoundation of sand, and his building can in no way last. The RabbinMoses persuaded me to be wise, while he himself, with words which neitherhe himself nor any other person understood, and with extravagant symbolsmade bells to sound, and while with execrable conjurations he made appear inglasses him who had committed a theft, and while he made a water causing anold man to appear young (and that only for the space of two hours and nolonger). All the which things he indeed taught me, but the whole was butvanity, low curiosity, and a pure deception of the Demon, leading to no usefulend imaginable, and tending to the loss of the Soul. And when I had theVeritable Knowledge of the Sacred Magic, I both forgot them, and banishedthem from mine heart.That impious Bohemian,24 with the aid and assistance of his Associate,performed astounding feats. He rendered himself invisible, he used to fly inthe air, he used to enter through the keyholes into locked-up rooms, he knewour greatest secrets, and once he told me things which God alone could know.But his Art cost him too dear, for the Devil had made him swear in the Pactthat he would use all his secrets to the dishonour of God, and to the prejudiceof his neighbour. Ultimately his body was found dragged through the streets,and his head without any tongue therein, lying in a drain. And this was all theprofit he drew from his Diabolical Science and Magic.In Austria I found an infinitude of Magicians who only occupiedthemselves in killing and maiming men, in putting discord among marriedpeople, in causing divorces, in tying witch-knots in osier or willow branches tostop the flow of milk in the breasts of nursing women, and similar infamies.But these miserable wretches had made a Pact with the Devil, and had becomehis slaves, having sworn unto him that they would work without cessation todestroy all living creatures. Some of these had two years (for their Pact) to run,some three, and after that time they underwent the same fate as the Bohemian.At Lintz I worked with a young woman, who one evening invited me togo with her, assuring me that without any risk she would conduct me to aplace where I greatly desired to find myself. I allowed myself to be persuadedby her promises. She then gave unto me an unguent, with which I rubbed theprincipal pulses of my feet and hands; the which she did also; and at first itappeared to me that I was flying in the air in the place which I wished, andwhich I had in no way mentioned to her.7"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Of Abramelin the Mage15I pass over in silence and out of respect, that which I saw, which wasadmirable, and appearing to myself to have remained there a long while, I feltas if I were just awakening from a profound sleep, and I had great pain in myhead and deep melancholy. I turned round and saw that she was seated at myside. She began to recount to me what she had seen, but that which I had seenwas entirely different. I was, however, much astonished, because it appeared tome as if I had been really and corporeally in the place, and there in reality tohave seen that which had happened. However, I asked her one day to go aloneto that same place, and to bring me back news of a friend whom I knew forcertain was distant  leagues. She promised to do so in the space of an hour.She rubbed herself with the same unguent, and I was very expectant to see herfly away; but she fell to the ground and remained there about three hours as ifshe were dead, so that I began to think that she really was dead. At last shebegan to stir like a person who is waking, then she rose to an upr , ightposition, and with much pleasure began to give me the account of herexpedition, saying that she had been in the place where my friend was, and allthat he was doing; the which was entirely contrary to his profession. Whence Iconcluded that what she had just told me was a simple dream, and that thisunguent was a causer of a phantastic sleep; whereon she confessed to me thatthis unguent had been given to her by the Devil.All the Arts of the Greeks are Enchantments and Fascinations, and theDemons hold them enchained in these accursed arts so that the Foundation ofthe True Magic may be unknown to them which would render them morepowerful than they; and I was the more confirmed in this opinion becausetheir operations were of no practical use whatever, and caused injury unto himwho put them into practice, as in fact many of them avowed plainly to me,when I had the True and Sacred Magic. There are also many operations whichthey say are handed down from the Ancient Sibyls. There is an Art calledWhite and Black;25 another Angelical, Te at i m; in which I avow that I haveseen orations so learned and beautiful, that had I not known the venomtherein hidden, I would have given them herein. I say all this because it is veryeasy to him who is not constantly upon his guard to err.One old scribbler of symbols26 gave me many enchantments which onlytended to work evil. He performed other operations by means of numbers,which were all odd, and of a triple proportion, in no way similar to the other,and for proof of this, he caused by such means in my presence a very fine treewhich was near my house to fall to the ground, and all the leaves and fruitswere consumed in a very short time. And he told me that in Numbers therewas hidden a very Great Mystery, because that by the means of numbers onecan perform all the operations for friendships, riches, honours, and all sorts of"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The Sacred Magic16things, good and evil; and he assured me that he had tried them, but that yetsome that he knew to be very true had not yet succeeded with him. Withregard to this particular, I found out the reason through the Wise Abramelin,who told me that this came and depended from a Divine Ministry, that is tosay, from the Qabalah, and that without that, one could not succeed. All thesethings have I beheld, and many others, and those who possessed these secretsgave them to me out of friendship. I burned these recipes afterwards in thehouse of Abramelin, they being absolutely things very far removed from theWill of God, and contrary to the charity which we owe unto our neighbour.Every learned and prudent man may fall if he be not defended and guided bythe Angel of the Lord, who aided me, and prevented me from falling into sucha state of wretchedness, and who led me undeserving from the mire ofdarkness unto the Light of the Truth. I have known and felt the effects of thegoodness of the Wise Abraha Melin,27 who of his own free will, and before Ihad asked him so to do, accepted me for his disciple. And before that I haddeclared my wish unto him he would accomplish and fulfil my desire; and allthat I wished to obtain from him he knew before I could open my mouth.Also he recounted to me all that I had seen, done, and suffered from the timeof my father’s death down to this moment; and this in words obscure and as itwere prophetic, which I did not then comprehend, but which I understoodlater. He told me many things touching my good fortune, but, which was theprincipal thing, he discovered to me the Source of the Veritable Qabalah, thewhich according to our custom, I have in turn communicated unto thine elderbrother Joseph, after that he had fulfilled the requisite conditions without theaccomplishment of which the Qabalah and this Sacred Magic cannot beexercised, and which I will recount in the two following books. Afterwards hedid manifest unto me the Regimen of the Mystery of that Sacred Magic whichwas exercised and put into practice by our forefathers and progenitors, Noah,Abraham, Jacob, Moses, David, and Solomon, among whom the lastmisused it, and he received the punishment thereof during his life.In the Second Book I will describe the whole faithfully and clearly, inorder that if the Lord God should wish to dispose of me before that thou shalthave attained a competent age, thou shalt find these three small manuscriptbooks as forming at the same time both an inestimable treasure and a faithfulmaster and teacher; because there are very many secrets in the Symbols of theThird Book which I have seen made experiment of with mine own eyes byAbramelim,28 and to be perfectly true, and which afterwards I myself haveperformed.

I therefore judged itfitting to defer putting it in practice, and a principal obstacle was theinconvenience of the place in which I dwelt. I resolved to absent myselfsuddenly, and go away into the Hercynian Forests, and there remain duringthe time necessary for this operation, and lead a solitary life. It was notpossible for me to do it sooner for many reasons and dangers of which latter Iran a risk in that place, besides which it would be necessary to leave my wife,who was young and now enceinte. Finally, I resolved to follow the example ofAbramelin, and I divided my house31 into two parts; I took another house atrent, which I in part furnished, and I gave over to one of my uncles the care ofproviding the necessaries of life and the needs thereof. Meanwhile I with mywife and a servant remained in my own house, and I began to accustom myselfto the solitary life, which it was to me extremely difficult to support, becauseof the melancholic humour which dominated me, and I lived thus till theseason of Easter which I celebrated with all the family according to custom.Then first, on the following day, in the Name and to the honour of GodAlmighty the Creator of Heaven and of Earth, I commenced this holyoperation, and I continued it for Six Moons without omitting the slightestdetail, as thou wilt understand later.

He wished also to possess the secret ofthe whole operation, but as I was warned by the Lord that it was not His Will,he contented himself with what was permitted, not as Emperor, but as aprivate person; and I even by means of mine Art facilitated his marriage withhis wife; and I caused him to overcome the great difficulties which opposed hismarriage.I delivered also the Count Frederick34 by the means of  artificialcavalry (the which I by mine Art caused to appear according unto the tenor ofthe Twenty-ninth Chapter of the Third Book here following), free out of the,"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Of Abramelin the Mage21hands of the Duke Leopold of Saxonia; the which Count Frederick withoutme would have lost both his own life, and his estate as well (which latterwould not have descended) unto his heirs.Unto the Bishop Of Our City also, I showed the betrayal of hisgovernment at Orembergh, one year before the same occurred; and I say nomore concerning this because he is an Ecclesiastic35 passing over in silence allthat I have further done to render unto him service.The Count Of Varvich36 was delivered by me from prison in Englandthe night before he was to have been beheaded.I aided the flight of the Duke,37 and of his Pope John,38 from the Councilof Constance, who would otherwise have fallen into the hands of the enragedEmperor; and the latter having asked me to predict unto him which one of thetwo Popes, John XXIII. and Martin V., should gain in the end, my prophecywas verified; that fortune befalling which I had predicted unto him atRatisbon.At the time when I was lodged at the house of the Duke Of Bavaria,39my Lord, for matters of the greatest importance; the door of my room wasforced, and I had the value of , Hungarian pieces stolen from me injewels and money. As soon as I returned, the thief (although he was a Bishop !)was forced to himself bring it back to me in person and to return with his ownhands to me the money, jewels, and account books, and to give me theprincipal reasons which had forced him to commit the theft, rather than anyother person.Six months ago I did write unto the Grecian Emperor,40 and I warnedhim that the affairs of his Empire were in a very bad condition, and that hisEmpire itself was on the brink of ruin,41 unless he could appease the Anger ofGod. As there only remaineth unto me but a little while to live, those whoremain after me will receive the news , of the result of this prophecy.The Operation of the thirteenth chapter42 of the Second Book, I havetwice performed; once in the house of Savonia;43 and another time in theMarquisate Of Magdeburgh, and I was the cause that their estates werehanded down unto their children.Now when once the faculty of being able to avail oneself of the SacredMagic hath been obtained, it is permissible to demand from the Angel a sumof coined money proportionate unto thy birth, quality and capacity, the whichwithout difficulty will be granted unto thee. Such money is taken from theHidden Treasures. It is, however, necessary to note that in all Treasures one isallowed to take the fifth part, God permitting the same, although somebraggart chatterers44 do say that there be an infinitude hereof which bedestined and reserved unto Anti-Christ, I do not for a moment say that this"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The Sacred Magic22may not be true; but undoubtedly from the same Treasures one may also takethe fifth part. There are yet more which be destined unto others. Mine ownparticular treasure was assigned unto me at Herbipolis;45 and I performed theOperation of the eighth chapter46 of the Third Book; it was not in any wayguarded, and was very ancient. It was of gold, which had never been struckinto ingots; and which I afterwards caused to be beaten out and converted intoits equivalent weight of golden florins, by the Spirits; the which was done in afew hours; (and I did this operation seeing that) mine own possessions werefew and of little worth; and so poor was I that in order to marry a person whohad a considerable dowry, I was forced to make use of mine Art, and Iemployed the Fourth Sign of the Third Book and the Third Sign47 of thenineteenth chapter; and I married my cousin with , golden florins as adowry, the which sum served as a cover to my fortune.All the Signs which are in the Eighteenth Chapter48 have been made useof by me so many times that I could not count them. However, they are allgiven in the Book49 already mentioned.I made great and wonderful experiments with the Signs of the second50and eighth51 chapters of the Third Book. The First Sign52 of the first chapter ofthe Third Book is the most perfect.It is necessary to be prompt and adroit in all these operations, seeing thatin the things which belong unto God we can easily commit still greater errorsthan those into which Solomon fell.All these Signs have I worked with great case and pleasure, and with verygreat utility (unto myself and others). All these operations and others ininfinite number have I performed by the Signs which be in the Third Book,and never have I failed in attaining mine end, I have always been obeyed (bythe Spirits), and everything hath succeeded with me because I have myselfobeyed the Commandments of God. Also I have from point to point followedout that which mine Angel hath counselled and prescribed unto me; followingout also exactly that which Abra-Melin53 had taught me, the which is thesame that I shall write in the Two following Books, and which I shallexemplify and explain more clearly; because the instructions which I received,although in very obscure words and Hieroglyphics, have caused me to attainmine object, and have never permitted me to err and fall into pagan, strange,and superstitious idolatries; I being always kept in the Way of the Lord, Whois the True, the Only, the Infallible End, for arriving at the possession of thisSacred Magic."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Of Abramelin the Mage23THE NINTH CHAPTER.HE infamous Belial hath no other desire than that of obtaining thepower of hiding and obscuring the True Divine Wisdom, so that hemay have more means of blinding simple men and of leading them bythe nose; so that they may always remain in their simplicity, and in their error,and that they may not discover the Way which leadeth unto the True Wisdom;seeing that otherwise it is certain that both he and his Kingdom would remainbound and that he would lose the title which he giveth himself of “Prince ofthis World,” having become the slave of man. This is wherefore he seeketh toannul and destroy utterly this Sacred Wisdom. I, however, do pray all andsingular to be upon their guard, and in no way to despise the Way andWisdom of the Lord, nor to allow themselves to be seduced by the Demonand his adherents; for he is a liar and will be so eternally; and may the Truthfor ever flourish; for in following out and obeying with fidelity that which Ihave written in these Three Books, not only shall we arrive at the desired end,but we shall sensibly know and feel the Grace of the Lord, and the actualassistance of His Holy Angels, who take an incredible pleasure in seeing thatthey are obeyed and that you intend to follow out the Commandments ofGod, and that their instructions are observed. Such then are the particularpoints upon which I insist.This Wisdom hath its foundation in the High and Holy Qabalah54 whichis not granted unto any other than unto the First-Born, even as God hathordained, and as it was observed by our predecessors. Thence arose thedifference, and the truck or exchange55 between Jacob and Esau; theprimogeniture being the Qabalah, which is much nobler and greater than theSacred Magic.56 And by the Qabalah we can arrive at the Sacred Magic, but bythe latter we cannot have the Qabalah. Unto the Child of a Servant, or of anAdulterer, the Qabalah is not granted, but only unto a Legitimate Child; asoccurred in the case of Isaac and Ishmael; but the Sacred Wisdom throughthe Mercy of God all can acquire, provided that they walk in the right Path;and each one should content himself with the Gift and Grace of the Lord. Andthis must not be done out of curiosity, and with extravagant and ridiculousscruples, wishing to know and understand more than is right; seeing thattemerity is certainly punished by God, Who then permitteth him who ispresumptuous not only to be turned aside out of the True Way by the SecondCauses,57 but also the Demon hath power over him, and he ruineth andexterminateth him in such a manner, that we can only say that he himself isthe sole cause of his own ruin and misery.

On theother hand, he must always be upon his guard, and abstain as from a mortalsin from flattering, obeying, regarding, or having respect to the Demon, andto his Viperine Race; neither must he submit himself unto him in the slightestthing, for that would be his ruin and the fatal loss of his soul. As it happenedunto all the seed descended from Noah, Lot, Ishmael, and others who didpossess the blessed land (before our forefathers) who inherited this Wisdomfrom father to son, from family to family; but in the course of time having lentan ear unto the Treacherous Enemy, they let themselves be turned away fromthe Veritable Path, and did lose the True Science which they had received fromGod by the means of their fathers, and gave themselves over unto SuperstitiousSciences, and unto Diabolical Enchantments, and unto Abominable Idolatries,the which was the cause that thereafter God did chastise them, defy61 them,and chase them from their country; and did introduce in their stead ourpredecessors; from which same errors again later came the cause of our presentmisery and servitude, the which will last even unto the end of the world; sincethey in no way wished to know the Gift which God had given unto them, butinstead abandoned it to embrace and follow the deceits of the Demon.This is wherefore each one should take care to submit himself unto him62neither by acts, nor by words, nor by thoughts, because he is so adroit andprompt that he can seize one unexpectedly; just as a Spider may take a Bird.63Let that miserable Bohemian and the others whom I have before mentioned,serve thee for an example to avoid (even as they did unto me).In the commencement of the Operation there appeareth a Man ofMajestic Appearance, who with great affability doth promise unto theemarvellous things.

Thisis why I pray every one to follow mine example, and if he doeth otherwise theMalediction of the Lord will fall upon him, and as for myself I shall beexcusable and innocent before God, and before all men.In the Third Book there will be found a very beautiful garden,65 the like ofwhich assuredly no one hath ever made, and which no King nor Emperor hathever possessed. He who shall wish to be as an industrious Bee therein, canthere suck the honey which it containeth in abundance; but if he shallmaliciously wish to transform himself into a Spider, he can also draw poisonfrom thence.

I have alsoin such case myself, however, seen and felt that God, Who penetrateth thesecret of our hearts, hath put by indirect means obstacles in the way of such anone’s success, causing difficulties to arise of one kind and another. So that hewho at the first wisheth to possess this Science in order to use it against hisneighbour, and to commit all sorts of abominations, manifesteth himself as anunworthy person unto him who had resolved to give it unto him.Shun Commerce, and the converse of those who actually in the search forthis Science shall do and say all things which tend to Evil; seeing that suchmen can become the Enchanters of the Devil.

He who operateth shall do thesame thing, but upon a veil of black silk, and shall put it on in the samemanner as the Child. After this thou shalt make the Child enter into theOratory and thou shalt cause him to place the fire and the perfume in thecenser, then he shall kneel before the Altar; and he who performeth theoperation shall be at the door and prostrate upon the ground, making hisOration, and supplicating his Holy Angel that he will deign to appear andshow himself unto this innocent being,70 giving unto him another Sign if it benecessary in order to see him himself71 on the two following days.It is requisite that he who shall operate shall take heed to in no wiseregard the Altar, but having his face towards the ground let him continue hisOrations, and as soon as the child shall have seen the Angel thou shaltcommand him to tell thee, and to look upon the Altar and take the lamen orplate of silver which thou shalt have placed there for this purpose, in order tobring it unto thee if it be necessary, and whatever other thing the Holy Angelshall have written thereon, wherewith thou oughtest to work on the twofollowing days.

I have consequentlycarefully in all cases put the orthography as it there occurs in the MS.9 “Vormatie”; that is to say, the district under the government of the town of Worms called in Latin“Vormatia” anciently.10 In the previous chapter he says that he remained in this path of study for ten years.11 Ie., God.12 Samuel.13 Thus spelt here.14 Aaron the Jew.15 The Qabalistical reader will at once remark the symbolism of the numbers “ten” and “seventy-two”the first being the Number of the Sephiroth, and the second that of the Schemahamphorasch. But asmany readers may be ignorant of the meaning and reference of these terms' I will briefly explain them.The Ten Sephiroth are the most abstract ideas and conceptions of the ten numbers of the ordinaryDecimal Scale, and are employed in the Qabalah as an ideal means of explaining the differentEmanations or Attributes of the Deity. It was thus that Pythagoras employed the abstract ideas ofNumbers as a means of metaphysical instruction. The Schemahamphorasch or “Divided Name” is aQabalistical method of investigating the natures of the Name of four letters I H V H (Jehovah), whichis considered to contain all the Forces of Nature. There are in the Book of Exodus three verses in thefourteenth chapter, describing the pillars of fire and of cloud forming a defence unto the children ofIsrael against the Egyptians. Each of these three verses consists in the Hebrew of seventy-two letters,and by writing them in a certain manner one above another, seventy-two columns of three letters eachare obtained; each column is then treated as a Name of Three Letters, and the explanation of these issought for in certain verses of the Psalms which contain these Names; and these latter would be theverses of the Psalms alluded to in the text, which the seventy-two poor persons were told to recite.16 This would not necessarily exclude eggs or milk.17 So in the MS.18 Note again the number of seventy-two.19 This is evidently said ironically.20 He probably means the copies he himself had been ordered by Abramelin to make, and not theoriginals.21 “Et tu connoiteras la deference dont je me sers avec toy.”"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The Sacred Magic34      22 Mistères, evidently a slip for Maistres, Masters.23 A coin of base money formerly in use, its value being about a halfpenny.24 I.e.

Son of the Emperor Charles IV. and of Anne of Silesia, he received an excellenteducation. At ten years of age his father gave him the Margravate of Brandenburg, and two years laterhe was betrothed to Mary, the daughter of Louis the Great of Hungary, whom he afterwards married.He was nominated by his father-in-law his successor on the throne of Poland. But the nobles preferredLadislaus, the nephew of Casimir the Great. However, in 1386, he took possession of Hungary,repulsed the Poles, overcame the rebellious nobles; and then marched against the Wallachians andTurks, but he was beaten, and later, notwithstanding the help of France and England, he lost theBattle of Nicopolis in 1396, He escaped on board a vessel in the Black Sea, and for eighteen monthswas a fugitive from his Kingdom; and at the moment of his re-entering Hungary he was madeprisoner by the discontented nobles, and shut up in the citadel of Ziklos. Escaping thence intoBohemia, he, however, reconquered his throne, and in 1410 was raised to the Empire by one partyamong the Electors, while Josse, Marquis of Moravia, and Wenceslaus were elected by other factions.A remarkable coincidence, seeing that at this moment when three Emperors possessed the Empire, thePapacy had also three Popes, viz.: John XXIII. (Balthazar Cossa), a Neapolitan; Gregory XII. (AngeConrario), a Venetian; and Benedict XIII. (Pierre de Lune), a Spaniard. The death of Josse, and theresignation of Wenceslaus, left Sigismond sole master of the Empire. After having received the SilverCrown at Aix-la-Chapelle in 1414, he went to preside at the Council of Constance, where John Husswas condemned, notwithstanding the safe conduct which he had obtained from the Emperor. Heendeavoured to end the differences between the Roman and Greek Churches, visited France andEngland under pretext of reconciling Charles VI. and Henry V., but, as some say, in order to form aleague with the latter against France, so as to recover the ancient Kingdom of Arles. The death of hisbrother, Wenceslaus, in 1409, rendered him Master of Boheinia, at the moment when the revolt of theHussites was at its height. He commenced a war of extermination against them, but was defeated byZiska in 1420, and a war of fifteen years' duration ensued.

But dissensions arose among them, and Sigismond profited by thisto completely crush them at length and make Bohemia submit. He reigned twenty-seven years asEmperor of Germany, eighteen years as King of Bohemia, and fifty-one years as King of Hungary. Hissecond wife, Barbe, has been called by some, the Messalina of Germany.34 Frederick I., surnamed the Quarreller, Duke and Elector of Saxony, was born at Altenburg in 1369,and died in 1428. He was son of the Landgrave and Margrave Frederick the Severe, and of Catherine,Countess of Hermeberg. At only four years of age, Frederick had been betrothed to Anne, daughter ofthe Emperor Charles IV., later on he had serious disputes concerning this matter with the EmperorWenceslaus (the brother of Anne), who had disposed of her hand to another, but who ultimatelyconsented, in 1397, to pay Frederick a considerable sum by way of damages. In 1388 he fought as allyof the Burgrave of Nuremberg in the war of the German towns; and gained his knightly spurs in 1391,in the war which he, in concert with the Teutonic Knights, waged against the Lithuanians. Next, hefought against Wenceslaus. He married Catherine of Brunswick in 1402, and after various wars andquarrels, the University of Leipzig was founded in 1409. The indefatigable activity which this Princedisplayed from 1420 against the movements of the Hussites, who were directly menacing hispossessions, pointed him out as a valuable auxiliary to the Emperor Sigismond, who was then in a verycritical position. In order to assure himself definitely of the alliance of Frederick the Quarreller, theEmperor conferred upon him the Electorate and Duchy of Saxony; but the former could not longenjoy his new found dignities in peace, for the Emperor shifted the whole weight of the war with theHussites on to his shoulders. As the other German Princes did not respond readily to the Elector’sappeal, the latter had the misfortune to lose the greater part of his Army near Brux in 1425. But hiswife, Catherine, summoned the whole of Catholic Germany to unite in a Crusade against theinnovating Hussites; while 20,000 strange and foreign Warriors came unexpectedly to rangethemselves under the Standard of Frederick. It is to be noted that Abraham the Jew puts the ArtificialCavalry he supplied at 2000 (though this may easily be a slip for 20,000) and rumour would of coursesoon magnify the number. But the Elector was at length defeated at the disastrous battle of Aussig in1426, where the élite of the German Warriors fell. The following year again witnessed a fresh defeat ofthe Elector, and the chagrin which this excited, ultimately led to his death. He was succeeded by hisson, Frederick II., called “the Good” born in 1411, who began to reign in 1428, and died in 1464 (seeDict. Larousse).35 The same ambiguity exists in the French as in the translation, as to whether it is Abraham or theBishop who passes over the matter in silence. Et je n’en dis pas davantage acause quil est un eclesiastiquepassant sous silence ceque joy fait deplus pour luy rendre service. (I preserve the orthography of the Frenchoriginal.)36 By “Count of Varvich” Abraham evidently means “Count of Warwick” as throughout the MS. a “w”is never used, but always a “v”, wherever the former occurs in a proper name. This Count of Warwickis probably Henri de Beauchamp, the brother-in-law of Warwick the “King-Maker” and son of thatRichard de Beauchamp, so infamous for his instrumentality in bringing about the torture and burningof the heroic Joan of Arc.

He had been acorsair in his youth, and at first, after his entry into holy orders, was only notable for his debauches,his exactions, and his violence. Pope Boniface IX. nevertheless appointed him Cardinal in 1402, andafterwards Legate of Bologna, where he is said to have given himself up to such excesses that GregoryXII. thought it necessary to excommunicate him. Notwithstanding this Cossa was elected to thePapacy at the time when the Church was shaken by internal dissension. He promised at first torenounce the Pontificate, if on their side Gregory XII. and Benedict XIII. would abandon their claims.However, he mounted the Papal Throne, and declared for the side of Louis d’Anjou in the warbetween the latter and Ladislaus regarding the Throne of Naples. At length, after the taking of Romeby Ladislaus, he was forced to implore the support of the Emperor Sigismond. The latter consented togrant him his protection, but on the sole condition of the convocation of the Council of Constance.After much hesitation, and after having taken every possible precaution to ensure his personal safety,John XXIII. consented to the assembling of the Council, which he opened 7th November, 1414.Being then summoned to lay aside the Papal Mitre, he judged it prudent to consent; but a few dayslater, he succeeded in escaping in disguise, during a tournament given by the Duke of Austria. Heretired to Lauffembourg, and protested against the abdication, which he declared to have beenobtained from him by force. The Council was for a moment struck with fear and consternation, butthe firmness of the Emperor Sigismond, coupled with the effect of the declaration of J. Gerson thatthe General Councils had higher authority than the Papacy, prevailed. John XXIII. was summoned toappear before the Council, but refused; and soon after, being abandoned by the Duke of Austria, whowas too weak to resist the power of the Emperor, he was arrested at Fribourg, and conducted toRudolfcell. On the 29th May, 1415, this Pontiff was solemnly deposed by the Council of Constance asbeing given to simony, impudent, a secret poisoner, and a spendthrift of the wealth of the Church; andwas imprisoned in the Castle of Heidelberg. At the end of four years he recovered his liberty, onpayment of 30,000 golden crowns, and went to Rome, where he made his submission to Martin V.,and was by him appointed Cardinal-Bishop of Frascati, and Senior of the Sacred College. He died afew months later at Florence, either of anxiety or by poison.39 Either Ernest or William I. of Bavaria. They were brothers, and reigned conjointly. From his callingthe Duke of Bavaria, his Lord, it would appear that he was living under his dominion, but it is curiousthat up to this point Abraham has never mentioned the name of his own town.40 Constantine Palaeologos, who was the thirteenth and last Greek Emperor. He was killed, andConstantinople taken by the Turks under Mahomet II. The direct descendant of ConstantinePalaeologos today, is the Princess Eugénie di Cristoforo-Palxologae-Nicephorae-Comnenae.41 A deux doigts de sa perte.42 This chapter is entitled “Concerning the Convocation of the Good Spirits”.43 Thus in MS.-?

It seems from thispassage that it was probably the city of Abraham the Jew, and therefore the one intended a fewparagraphs before where he speaks of the “Bishop of our town”. Wurzbourg and the surroundingdistrict formed a Bishopric, and in the time of Abraham it was the scene of constant struggles betweenthe Bishop and his party, and the burghers. Later, formidable persecutions against the Jews took placethere, and many edicts were promulgated against witchcraft.46 This is evidently an error for either the sixth, the sixteenth, or the twenty-eighth chapter; probablythe latter.47 To make oneself loved by a relation.48 The Eighteenth Chapter is entitled: “How to heal divers maladies”.49 I.e. the Third Book.50 The Second Chapter is entitled: “How to obtain information and be enlightened concerning everykind of proposition and all doubtful sciences”.51 The Eighth Chapter is entitled: “How to excite Tempests”.52 “To know all sorts of matters past and to come, which are, however, not opposed to God and to HisHoly Will!”53 Thus spelt here.54 As I have pointed out in my “Kabbalah Unveiled,” I consider this a truer orthography than“Cabala,” or “Kabbalah”.55 Troque ou change.56 That is to say the True and Unwritten Qabalah, which is the Ancient Egyptian Magical Wisdom;and not later Hebrew perversions thereof.57 That is to say the Administrators of the First Cause, ie. the various Divine Powers, or Gods andGoddesses, who act more directly on matter.58 Abraham here alludes to the period of preparation required from the Neophyte, as described later.59 Regarding the Hierarchies, see end of Third Book.60 Thus in the Indian “Mantras” the force and mystery of the Words themselves is especially insistedon.61 Les deffits62 I.e., the Demon.63 There is a very large species of Spider, which can even capture and kill small birds, but it is only metwith in tropical regions, especially in Central America and Martinique; the zoological name of thisspecies is Hygak.64 Here a word is evidently omitted in the MS. by a slip. It should probably read “of my God”.65 This is a very usual expression in Qabalistic Books to denote a valuable collection of Occult orMagical information.66 It is noticeable how constantly Abraham the Jew insists upon this point.67 This word in Greek would mean “exhausted in every way” or “hemmed in and hindered on everyside”.68 I.e., the Angels.69 The following instructions recall some of Cagliostro's methods of magical working."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"The Sacred Magic38      70 Ie., the Child.71 Ie., the Operator.72 Ie., the lamen of silver, previously alluded to."}]
