L. Macgregor-mathers.The following Notes to these Chapters I have classed under various heads forgreater convenience of reference, thinking that besides the explanations of mostof the Magical Names employed in the Symbols, it would also be of assistanceto the Occult student to be able to see at a glance briefly stated at the end ofeach Chapter, the substance of the information especially referring thereto,given by Abraham the Jew in other parts of the work, notably towards the endof the Second Book:Under (a) therefore I have stated by what Powers the Symbols of each par-ticular Chapter are manifested.Under (b) the Names of the Sub-Princes of the Evil Spirits who are theespecial overseers of the execution of the effect desired.Under (c) whether the Operations of the Chapter in question can be to anextent performed by the “Familiar Spirits,” or not.Under (d) an abridgment of any especial instructions given by Abraham inother parts of the work.Under (e) I have given the meanings of most of the Names employed inthe Squares, as far as possible, and also any additional remarks which seemednecessary.These Magical Symbols of this Third Book consist solely of Squares of Let-ters, which may be roughly divided into four distinct classes.() Those in which the whole of the Square is occupied by Letters. In thisform the double Acrostic arrangement is especially marked; though in some fewcases it is slightly varied by the introduction of a different name.() Those in which part of the Square is left vacant, the Letters beingarranged in the form of what is called in Geometry, a Gnomon.() Those in which the central part of the Square is left vacant, the Lettersforming a border round the void part.() Those of more irregular disposition, and in which in some instancessingle Letters are placed separately in the vacant part of the Square.It will be remarked that in nearly all cases these Names arranged in theSquares represent generally the effect to be produced, or in other words are sim-ply the Hebrew or other appellations of the result to which the Square is to beapplied. At the beginning of each Chapter is placed a numbered list of theeffects to be obtained by the use of each Symbol there given. Then follow theSquares themselves."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Sacred Magick125In the Original MS. these Squares have been also numbered to correspondwith the list at the beginning of each Chapter, but from the evident differencein the ink this has been done later, though the handwriting is the same. I thinkalso that in several cases the numbers to the Squares have been misplaced; andthough usually the natural Sequence of , , , , ,  is adhered to, yet occa-sionally they are in a more irregular order, as in the th Chapter, for example,where they run thus: , , , , , , , , , , , .The Squares in the Original MS. are all of the same size, subdividedaccording to the exigences of the case, though convenience of printing has pre-vented this equality of size being adhered to in the present work. In mostinstances the Gnomons and Borders are ruled off from the vacant part, but thisrule is not adhered to in all cases in the Original MS. The Letters in the Squaresare Roman Capitals. In some few instances two letters are placed in the samesmall Square, or subdivision, of the larger Square.Notes To Chapter I.(a) The Symbols of this Chapter are manifested only by the Angels or bythe Guardian Angel.(b) ORIENS, PAYMON, ARITON, and AMAYMON execute the Opera-tions hereof by means of their Common Ministers.(c) The Familiar Spirits cannot well execute the Operations of this Chap-ter.(d) Take the Symbol in your hand, place it under your hat or cap, upon thetop of your head, and you will be secretly answered by the Spirit who will exe-cute that which you wish. (This mode of operation will evidently be applicableto many of the Chapters.)(e) No.  is a Square of  Squares, and is a complete specimen of doubleAcrostic arrangement. MILON, though Greek-sounding, has here hardly ameaning if derived from either MILOS, a fruit or other tree; or fromMEILON, a precious thing, or article of value. It seems rather derived from theHebrew MLVN = a diversity of things, or matters. IRAGO is perhaps fromGreek EIRA a question, or inquiry, and AGO to conduct or decide. HebrewRGO = to disrupt or analyse. LAMAL, probably from Chaldaic MLA = full-ness, entirety. OGARI from Hebrew OGR = a swallow or swiftly-flying thing.NOLIM from Hebrew, NOLIM = hidden or covered things. Whence we mayextract the following as the formula of this Square: “Va r i o u s q u e s t io n s f ul l yexamined and analysed, and that quickly, and even things carefully hidden andconcealed”. This rule we can apply to discover the formulas of other Squares."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Of Abramelin The Mage126No.  is a Square of  Squares, and is also a complete Specimen of doubleAcrostic. THIRAMA from Chaldee TIRM = strongly defended places, or Cita-dels. HIGANAM from Hebrew or Chaldee GNN or GNM = to defend.IGOGANA, perhaps from Hebrew GG = a roof or covering or protection fromabove. RAGIGAR, perhaps from Chaldaic ROO (it must be remembered that,though I here transliterate the letter Ayin by O, it has really the power of a GHas well; it is a sound difficult of comprehension by a non-Orientalist) = to breakup, or breach. ANAGOGI probably from Greek ANAGOGE the act of raisingor elevating. MANAGIH from Hebrew MNO to restrain; stop, put a barrierto, or contain by a barrier. AMARIHT from Hebrew AMRTH = Word orSpeech. The whole idea of this Formula seems to be the making forcible wayinto a defended place or matter.No.  is a Square of  Squares, and again a perfect form of double Acros-tic. DOREH, from DVR Hebrew = a habitation. ORIRE perhaps from LatinORIOR = to riser or be born. RINIR perhaps from Hebrew NIR = to renew.ERIRO perhaps from ARR to curse. HEROD from Hebrew ChRD = shaking,trembling.No.  is a Square of  Squares, and again a perfect double Acrostic.NABHI from Hebrew NBA = to prophesy. ADAIH perhaps from Heb. DIH =a bird of omen. BAKAB from Heb. KAB = in trouble. HIADA from HebrewIDH = sent forward, or thrown. IHBAN from IHB Hebrew = to give or bring.Hence the formula would be somewhat “To prophesy by omens the troubles tocome”; the which is much more applicable to No. , “The Tribulations tocome”; than to No. , which is for “The Things to happen in War”.No.  is a double Acrostic of  Squares. NVDETON from Hebrew ND =to remove, and ATHN = strongly. VSILARO from Hebrew BSHL = to ripen,and Chaldaic ARO = the Earth. DIREMAT from Hebrew DR = to encompassor include, and MT = things forgotten or slipped aside. ELEMELE fromHebrew ALIM and ALH = God of the Mighty Ones. TAMERID from HebrewTHMR = straight like a palm-tree, and ID = put forward. ORALISV = fromHebrew = ORL = superfluous, and ISh = the substance. NOTEDVN, fromNTH = to stretch out and DN = to contend or rule.No.  is a double Acrostic of  Squares. SARAPI from Hebrew ShRP = toburn. ARAIRP from Hebrew AR = a river, and RPH = to abate or slacken.RAKKIA from Hebrew RKK = to become faint, to become softened. AIKKARfrom Hebrew OKR = to trouble or disturb. PRIARA from PRR = to shatter orbreak up. IPARAS from Hebrew PRS = to break in pieces, to divide, or part insunder. This will give a formula of trouble."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Sacred Magick127No.  is a double Acrostic of  Squares. MALACH from Hebrew MLCh= Salt; also that which is easily dissolved; to dissolve. AMANEC from MNK = achain, or from AMN - stability. LANANA from LNN = to lodge, or take upone’s abode. ANANAL from AN = labour, and NLH, to complete or finish.CENAMA perhaps from QNM = odoriferous. HCALAM perhaps from HCL =spacious (as a palace).No.  is a double Acrostic of  Squares. KOSEM, from Hebrew QSM =to divine or prognosticate. OBODE, from Hebrew OBD = a servant. SOFOSfrom Greek SOPHOS = wise, learned, skilful. EDOBO, perhaps from DB = tomurmur. MESOK from Hebrew MSK = to mingle or intermix.No.  is a double Acrostic of  Squares. ROTHER is perhaps from RTT,Trembling, Dread; and HRR to conceive or bring forth. ORORIE fromHebrew OROR = laying bare, disclosing. TOARAH from Hebrew THVRH =Law, Reason, or Order. HARAOTfrom Hebrew HRH to bring forth, or fromCHRTH = To inscribe or mark down. REHTOR from RTT and ThVR = rea-son for dread.The whole formula will represent the disclosing of the reasons fordreading any terrible effect.No.  is another double Acrostic of  Squares, and No.  one of Squares. I have here given a sufficiently careful analysis of the meanings of thecombinations formed by the letters in the preceding Squares to give the Readera general idea of the formulas involved. To avoid an undue extension of thesenotes, I shall not usually analyse every name contained in each Square, but shallconfine myself in most cases to giving sufficient indications of the meanings ofthe principal words or words only, which are therein employed. The Readermust remember also that in such an Acrostic arrangement of the letters ofwords, half of those therein contained will simply be inversions of the principalword or words therein contained. For example, in No. , REAHBEM is ofcourse MEBHAER written backwards. ELIAILE reads the same way backwardsor forwards, and so does HAOROAH; and BIKOSIA written backwards givesAISOKIB. Yet undoubtedly some of these words are to an extent translatablealso, and in this case will be found to have a bearing on the subject-matter ofthe Square. Hebrew especially is a language in which this method will be foundto work with a readiness unattainable in ordinary European languages, from thefact that its Alphabet may be said to be entirely Consonantal in character, evensuch letters as Aleph, Vau, and Yod, being rather respectively, a drawing in ofthe breath than the letter A; V rather than U. and Y rather than I. Also in com-mon with all really ancient languages the system of Verbal Roots from which allthe words of the language are derived, has this effect, viz., that the majority ofcombinations of two or three letters will be found to be a Verbal Root, bearing"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Of Abramelin The Mage128a definite meaning. Besides all this, in the Qabalah each letter of the HebrewAlphabet is treated as having a complete sphere of hieroglyphic meanings of itsown; whence the most important ancient Hebrew Names and Words can betreated by the Qabalistic Initiate as in fact so many formulas of Spiritual force. have been thus lengthy in explanation in order that the Reader may have someidea of the reason of the construction and use of these Magic Squares."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Sacred Magick129THE SECOND CHAPTER.O obtain information concerning, and to be enlightened upon all sortsof propositions and all doubtful Sciences.()() All three generally for the above effect.() U(1)ALLUPLEIRULIGILURIELPULLA(2)MELAMMEDERIFOISELISILLIMAF I RELOMMOLERIFAMILLISILESIOFIREDEMMALEM(3)EKDILUNKLISATUDINANALISAGASILANANIDUTASILKNULIDKE"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Of Abramelin The Mage130Notes To Chapter II.(a) The Symbols of this Chapter are manifested partly by the Angels, andpartly by the Evil Spirits.(b) ORIENS, PAYMON, ARITON, and AMAYMON execute the Opera-tions hereof by the means of their common Ministers.(c) The Familiar Spirits can to an extent execute the Operations of thisChapter.(d) Take the Symbol in your hand, and name what information yourequire.

And although God can in no way doevil, but always good, nevertheless we cannot deny that occasionally He permit-teth the Secondary Causes to act. Now the Executioners and Executors of theDivine justice be the Evil Spirits. Whence I conclude that although it may be inno sense advisable to work Operations for Evil, yet that there may arise, how-ever, certain cases which do admit of and permit the same; as (for example)when it is necessary to save and defend one’s own life, or to avert some greatscandal or evil, or to prevent offensive acts which might be done against one-self, or to displease God and hurt one’s neighbour, as well as in just Wars, andother like cases. Yet it is always best in such instances to govern yourself accord-ing to the counsel of your Holy Guardian Angel. I have also written these forthe reason that God hath given unto Man free Will both in merit and demerit;for, further, having finished the Operation, if thou shouldest wish (which I prayGod not to permit)1 to operate for Evil and to abuse the Grace which God hathgranted thee, the Spirits would be only too ready to give and manifest unto theethe Symbols, and will grant willingly unto thee all that thou shalt demand ofthem. Concerning this matter I repeat unto thee, Fear the Lord, love Him, andrespect His Commandments with a good heart, and thou shalt live happy andcontented upon Earth.If thou considerest maturely what be the essential points of this Operation,thou shalt find that the first point is to make a firm, veritable, and real resolu-tion to live in a truly edifying condition of modesty, and in retirement, as far asit shall be possible for thee so to do. For Solitude is the source of many bless-ings, such as, to give oneself up to prayer, and unto the contemplation of thingsDivine; to flee evil conversations and occasions of sin; to live in oneself; and toaccustom oneself to continuing a life of such regularity. For if one were to go topresent oneself before a King, what would one not do to appear before himwith splendour and magnificence; and what diligence and care would not one1.

Now we must understand that theenjoyment and vision of the Angels of the Lord be infinitely above the Princesof Earth, who in fact are but a vanity, a shadow, and vile dust of Earth. Now ifto please these Mortal Princes one would almost commit idolatries; what oughtone not to do to appear before the Holy Angels of God who represent theGrandeur of the Majesty of God. Let each one hold for a thing, sure and certainthat theGrace which the Lord granteth unto us in giving us this Sacred Science bythe means and intermediation of His Holy Angels is so great that none can fitlyexpress it.It is certain that having obtained this Sacred Wisdom thou mayest disposeof it and communicate it unto three friends; but thou must not exceed thisSacred Number of the Ternary, for in such case thou wouldest be altogetherdeprived of it. One of the most meritorious deeds in the sight of the Lord, is toshare with one’s neighbour the goods which God hath given unto us; yet mustwe take note of that which God commanded unto Moses, when He orderedhim to give the Operation unto Aaron his brother, namely that he shouldreceive as the Symbol of an Offering Ten Golden Florins, the which he shoulddistribute unto Seventy-Two poor persons with his own hands, obliging themto repeat the Psalms which I have already mentioned in the Second Book, andwhich should be of the number of SeventyTwo. For if he who receiveth thisOperation should not perform this Alms, the Operation would be void of valuefor him. Thou, not yet having the Authority to give it, without having receivedthe Ten Golden Florins, thou must act like Moses, unto whom the Lordgranted it on this condition, for him to give it unto his brother Aaron.I have also described the precautions which we must take before grantingthis Sacred Science unto any; and I repeat here that at least Six Months shouldtranspire during which we should frequently test, and seek by conversations tosound, the inclinations of him unto whom we may be willing to give it; so as toknow whether he be a reliable person, and also the object for which he deman-deth and is anxious to obtain this Science. Now shouldest thou perceive thatsuch an one is light and inconstant, and that he hath only vague ideas, and hab-its and manners which be not good, then shalt thou temporise with him for atime, so as to bring up causes, occasions, or pretexts, so as not to give it untohim, even shouldest thou already have promised it to him. For it is better toundergo the displeasure of a Mortal Man than that of an Eternal God, fromWhom thou hast received so great a Grace. I have, however, myself made trialhereof, for to my great wonderment (once upon a time) when I was thinkingthat I was putting it to good use in giving it unto a certain person for whom I"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Of Abramelin The Mage210had great respect; God Himself intervened and did not permit my intention tobe carried out, for that person began of his own accord to wonder whether thematter were true or no, and he doubted it much, believing that it was a fable,and did not have an entire faith therein; and he made me comprehend by hisdiscourse that he was not such an one as I had thought. Furthermore it hap-pened that he fell dangerously ill, and I in my turn was reprimanded by myAngel who blamed me for the choice I had made. The whole machinery of theUniverse is maintained by Faith; and he who believeth not, suffereth the chas-tisement of his perfidy both in this World and in the next. I could here saymuch more relating to our own selves, but as thou wilt have to pass under theinfluence2 of thy Holy Guardian Angel, thou wilt be sufficiently instructed inhis own good time, and by himself, concerning these matters which be bothdelicate and to be jealously guarded.3The Evil Spirit is so subtle, so keen, and so cunning, that that which hecannot obtain at the time of the Conjuration, he will seek to have on otheroccasions in offering thee his services. This is why the very first action to takeespecially with thy Familiar Spirits, should be to command them, never to sayanything unto thee of themselves, but only to speak when thou shalt interro-gate them, unless it were to warn thee of matters which concern either thineadvantage or thine hurt. For if thou dost not limit their liberty of speech theywill tell thee so many and so important things, that they will completely over-cloud4 thine understanding, and thou wilt not know what to believe, so that inthe confusion of ideas they could make thee prevaricate, and perhaps fall intoirretrievable error. Never make thyself to be greatly entreated in any matterwherein thou canst aid and succour thy neighbour, and do not wait until hedemandeth assistance from thee, but seek to know to the full his need eventhough it be concealed, and give him prompt aid. Also trouble not thyself as towhether he be Turk, Pagan, or Idolater, but do good unto all those who believein a God. Be especially charitable towards those who are in extreme want, pris-oners, or sick, and let thine heart be touched, and succour them generously; forGod taketh pleasure in beholding the poor succoured.In the Twenty-Eighth Chapter where it is treated of the way to have Silverand Gold sufficient to supply one’s needs on occasion; thou must know that2.

And ifthou usest it not within the twenty-four hours, this sum will disappear andthou wilt no longer be able to avail thyself of it, Think not, however, that thisGold is but a phantasy, for if thou effectually expendest it, and dost not endeav-our to hoard the same, he who shall receive it from thine hands can enjoy thesame and expend it according unto his desire, and the money will be real bothfor him and for others.For once only mayest thou demand of thine Holy Angel the amount ofGold and of Silver which thou shalt judge suitable unto thine estate and condi-tions. My possessions were few, and I demanded of mine Angel Three Thou-sand Thousand Golden Florins,5 and they were granted unto me. Later I madesuch good use of the Sacred Science, and I understood so well how to augmentmy goods, that at the present time, after having married three Daughters untoeach of whom I gave a hundred thousand (golden florins), as thou wilt see bythe testament which I have made, I am leaving in current money more than aMillion Golden Florins, besides a large quantity of very valuable furniture. HadI been of noble birth I might have demanded much more and have profitedless. When any one demanded of me : “Eh ! How have you managed to gain somuch?” I would reply thereto that it is a fine thing to know by certain Knowl-edge how much such or such a thing is worth here, and how much it is worthelsewhere, that this year, wheat, barley, and other crops, will be cheap in Italy,and dear in France, etc., etc.; and that commerce well managed, enricheth anyone.As for what concerneth the manner of treating and commanding the Spir-its, it is an easy thing unto whomsoever walketh by the proper paths; and it is avery difficult thing for whomsoever through ignorance submitteth himself untothem. I have heard say that there be some men who pass for being famousherein, such as a certain blind man D’acali, a certain Bearli, a PeterD’Abano,6 and many others. Ah! how many of them do but deceive them-selves! I do not say that these men did not perform extraordinary things; but itis necessary to note their manner of working, for their Science is imperfect, andtheir Authority proceedeth not from God by the intermediation of His HolyAngels, but proceedeth directly from express Pacts made with the Devil,7 and(acteth) by means of Consecrated Books full of thousands of Diabolical Conju-5.

Andyet it is the Science of these persons which causeth them to pass for famousWise Men.In the First Book I have made mention of those whom I had encounteredin my journeyings in Europe. The true Commandment is that which depen-deth from God, and in which there is no dependence placed on any Spiritimaginable, for in employing them, if you make unto them the least submis-sion, the slightest prayer, or honour, you are rendering yourselves their slaves,and they are in no way submitted unto you. The Spirits have so great knowl-edge that they comprehend very well by our actions what dispositions we have,and understand our inclinations, so that from the very beginning they preparethe way to make us to fail. If they know that a man is inclined unto Vanity andPride, they will humiliate themselves before him, and push that humility untoexcess, and even unto idolatry, and this man will glory herein and becomeintoxicated with conceit, and the matter will not end without his commandingthem some pernicious thing of such a nature that ultimately thence from willbe derived that sin which will make the Man the Slave of the Demon. Anotherman will be easily accessible to Avarice, and then if he take not heed the Malig-nant Spirits will propose unto him thousands of ways of accumulating wealth,and of rendering himself rich by indirect and unjust ways and means, whencetotal restitution is afterwards difficult and even impossible, so that he who is insuch case findeth himself ever the Slave of the Spirits. Another will be a man ofLetters; the Spirits will inspire him with presumption, and he will then believehimself to be wiser even than the Prophets, furthermore they will endeavour tolead him astray in subtle points in matters appertaining unto God, and willmake (that man) fall into a thousand errors, the which afterwards when hewisheth to support he will very frequently deny God, and His high Mysteries.The causes and matters whereof (the Spirits) will make use to cause a man towaver are infinite, especially when the man attempteth to make them submit tohis commands, and this is why it is most necessary to be upon one’s guard andto distrust oneself, The true Commandment will be that which will be givenwhen he who commandeth shall have maturely reflected and considered whohe is in himself, and who he is who should serve and obey him.

If then all things depend from theLord, upon whom wilt thou,  Man, base thyself so as to be capable of thyself(alone) to dominate the Spirits ? It is certain that such an enterprise cannot suc-ceed without the loss of thine own soul. Then it is by the virtue of that GodWho hath submitted them under thy feet, that thou shalt command them, aswill be precisely ordained unto thee by thy Holy Angel. “Donec ponam inimi-cos tuos scabellum Pedum tuorum.” “Until I shall make thy foes thy footstool.”Also do not familiarise thyself with them; for they be not little pet dogs.

And in all cases thou shalt avail thy-self of the power and command of thy Holy Angel.

Also it is a certain fact that hewho possesseth this Sacred Magic, hath no need whatever of them. Further theyare naturally inclined to ask of thee always things prejudicial, the which ifgranted by thee would offend the Lord, and if not they become your declaredenemies. Now my opinion (is that it) would be always (preferable) to renderthem what services you can from a distance.There is nothing which is so pleasing unto the Angels as to demand knowl-edge from them, and for my part I think there is no greater pleasure than thatof becoming wise when one learneth from such masters."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The Sacred Magick215I both have exhorted, and do exhort unto a solitary life,9 which is thesource of all good; it is true that it is difficult to accustom oneself thereunto;but once thou shalt have obtained the Sacred Science and Magic the love forretirement will come unto thee of thine own accord, and thou wilt voluntarilyshun the commerce with and conversation of men; for the pleasure and con-tentment thou wilt enjoy when thou shalt be the possessor of this Science willbe so great that thou wilt despise all amusements, excursions, riches, and everyother thing however attractive such may be.For once only will it be permissible to obtain property and goods propor-tionate unto thy degree and estate; the which afterwards are to be used byspending them liberally for thine own needs and those of thy neighbour, shar-ing with him in his necessity the good things which God shall have given (untothee); for he who should employ these for evil ends shall render himself incapa-ble of obtaining from God any other grace and benefit.The Child which one should choose for greater surety and success in (theacquisition of) this Sacred Science should be born of a legitimate marriage, andits father and mother should be also legitimate.

Also beforehandthou shouldest arrange thine affairs in such wise that they can in no way hinderthee, nor bring thee any disquietude in the period of the Six Moons, duringwhich time there will occur the greatest possible attempts at assault and damageunto thee which the keen and subtle Enemy will bring to bear upon thee.

And such a case ought in no way to afflictthee, for the Secrets of God are impenetrable, and He performeth, permitteth,and operateth all things for the best and for our good, although it may be notunderstanded of us.Hereinafter Will I set down the Key of this Operation, which is the onlything which facilitateth this Operation to enjoy the Vision of the Holy Angels,by placing the Symbols15 given hereafter upon the brow of the Child and ofhim who performeth the Operation, as I have said in the First Book, to whichone can easily refer.I will say even as much as this, that out of an hundred scarcely five or sixpersons can attain unto the possession of this Sacred Magic without this Key;for reasons which one can in no way disclose.Also we should repeat the Psalm VI. “Domine, ne in furore tuo arguas me,”etc. (“O Lord, afflict me not in Thine Anger”).There is nothing in the World which we should so much desire as a true Sci-ence, neither is there any more difficult to obtain than this one, because oftenone dieth before attaining unto it in its entirety. This is the true and only Way of this Sacred Science and Magic which theLord hath granted unto us by His pure mercy; and is that which in Six Monthsmaketh us attain unto the most high and Occult gifts of the Lord which we canthink of.This is the True Science which comprehendeth all other Sciences once oneis in possession thereofOh! how many books be read among us which seem wonderful!It is not fitting for me even to reveal a part of this Science and its proper-ties; and to appropriate unto myself that which appertaineth unto a person of agreat mind and so far above me.16 In teaching it even, I have far exceeded thatwhich I should have done, in having given unto thee the two last Symbols, butwhat will not paternal love and affection do? Endeavour only to obey me and tofollow out my precepts from point to point, according to the manner in whichI have given them unto thee in writing; keeping alway the Fear of God before15.

Also forget not the slightest thing which I have said unto thee inthese Three Books, for with the help of God Who ruleth and governeth allthings, and reigneth gloriously in Heaven and upon Earth, and Whose Divinejustice shineth in Hell; if thou hast recourse unto Him and puttest all thy con-fidence in His Divine Mercy, thou shalt obtain this Holy Science and Magicwhose power is inexpressible. Then,  my Son! and Whosoever may attainthereunto; remember to praise and glorify the Lord, and to pray unto Him thatHe may be willing to deign and accord unto me His Holy Glory, the place ofveritable rest, whereof to me while yet in this Valley of Misery He hath granteda large share through His Goodness and Mercy; and I pray the Lord also thatHe may be willing to grant it unto thee also with His Holy Benediction, andunto all those who by thy means will arrive at the possession of this SacredMagic, and who will use it according unto His Holy Will.May God deign, say I, to grant unto such all temporal goods, and a goodDeath in His Holy Kingdom!SO MAY IT BE!EndNote. The above set of four Squares evidently represent the Symbols already referredto in the Second Book (Chap. xx.), and in the concluding pages of this Third Book; asbeing those to be placed on the head of the Operator and of the Child during theAngelic Invocation. The Name URIEL for the former, the Name ADAM for the lat-ter. But evidently, also, the Squares of numbers above are intended as the reverse sidesof the two lower ones. The Latin word HOMO is the translation of ADAM in thesense of Man. The Squares of numbers are not of the ordinary magical class.12 1346 148139 148 1264 148 8 148 3316 23 148 915148 27421 31201243120132437 15 20126 40 63 48UR I E LRILUEILILIEUL I RLE I RUADAMDARAARADMAD AHOMO"}]
