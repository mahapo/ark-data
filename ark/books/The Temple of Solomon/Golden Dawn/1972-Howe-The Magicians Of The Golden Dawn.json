In ihePreface I explained that 'my aim has been to investigate the origins,organisation and, above all, the internal history of a representativeMagical sodality. Here were people engaged in extraordinary activitiei.I wanted to know who they were, what they did and how they reactedto situations which were unusual, at least by normal standards., Byand large I answered my own questions and hoped that this book,spublication would help to answer those asked by others who, likemyself, had been puzzled by the hitherro vague or incomplete accountsof the Golden Dav/n's origins and later history. I was .\"r\"f,rl, however,to emphasise that I had not atrempted to describe or explain theOrder's rituals or magical teachings at any great length beiause thematerial was available to the exrent of more than a thousand pages inDr Israel Regardie's The Golden Dawn, and because I lacked thenecessary technical qualifications.I had, then, been concerned with what I supposed to be a purelyhistorical phenomenon. It is true that Mr Francis King had told me of,or rather hinted at, the existence of a post-r94t Golden Dawn Templein London, but I inferred that its existence had been brief. In anyevent it never occurred to me that the Hermetic Order of the GoldenDawn would be revived, and upon an apparently ambitious scale,under Dr Regardie's auspices in the USA about a decade later.However, I surmised that the Golden Dawn might perhaps not be asdead as a dodo when I received a mildly hysterical letter from MrGerald Suster, a young man widr whom I had a slight acquaintance,in December r983.In this communication he announced the recent publication of DrRegardie's What You Should Know About The Golden Dawn (FalconPress, Phoenix, Arizona, USA; distributed in the United Kingdomby Thorsons Publishers Ltd), to which he had contributed a chapter.'Should you choose to read itr' he wrote, 'you will discover an attack"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Introductionupon your work and your approach to the subject. This attack was asscathing as I could make it. 'We are engaged in an ideological controv-ersy; you have slighted the Golden Dawn and I have slighted you andno apology for this is required.'Enlightenment was available when I read Dr Regardie's bogk,which is a facsimile reprint of the second edition of his My RosicrucianAdventure (tgz)rwith the addition of a Foreword by Mr ChristopherS. Hyatt, a new Introduction by Dr Regardie and Mr Suster's chapter.From Mr Hyatt I learned of the formation of the Israel RegardieFoundation,'a national headquarters for research and preservation ofthe Golden Dawn'; furtltermore that 'All those who make donationsof $roo.oo or more will receive a free collector's edition of What YouShould Know About The Golden Dawn, and be invited to attend theopening of this significant event' at an undisclosed location in theUSA in mid-r984. Furthermore, according to Mr Hyatt, 'we see theseeds of a loving and growth orientated system dedicated to the highgoal of Becoming More Than Human'. Thus close on a century afterits creation the Golden Dawn is about to be institutionalized, and this,I predict, will be its final death sentence.Dr Regardie's Introduction was largely devoted to an attack uPonmyself. 'I reviewed . . . The Magicians of the Golden Dawnfin GrcsticaNews, zr January ry74f in as derogatory a way as I possibly could,since I smelled prejudice and ridicule on every page [my italicsJ.' Oneverypage'l Dr Regardie exaggerated because to the best of my knowledgemy book only contained six lines which could be construed as beingcritical of the Golden Dawn. In the Preface I wrote: 'In many respectsthis is a \"mad chronicle\", at least if judged by conventional normslbut then we are dealing with unconventional people. It will serve nouseful purpose if I constantly draw attention to the story's intermittentpsychopathic gualities. My task is not to sit in judgment uPon myMagicians but, rather, to provide the materi'al for an unusual casehistory.' In fact I offered no more and no less than a straightforwarddocumentary history ef an interesting psychological and sociologicalphenomenon and without the expression of any particular personalopinion.Mr Suster's contribution was not as 'scathing' as I anticipated itmight be. A few of his remarks about myself were intended to beoffensive, but no matter. His attempts at textual criticism were labor-ious and inconclusive, probably because he had no new material uPonwhich to base them. Finally he advised me to Perform the LesserBanishing Ritual of the Pentagram daily for six months and to recordIntroducdonthe results. 'I have done this myself and experienced improvement onevery level of my lifer'he wrote.What both Dr Regardie and Mr Suster dislike, I believe, is that Ido not affrm that the Golden Dawn's teachings have any spiritualcontent. As far as my examination of the original Golden Dawn andits early successor Orders is concerned, perhaps both Dr Regardie andMr Suster should have ignored it. After all, why publicise a bookwhich, almost entirely on the basis of documentary evidence, demon-strates that the old Golden Dawn can hardly be described as a 'lovingand growth orientated system'lEllic Howefanuary zg84XI"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Foreword***,byGerald YorkeThe Magicians of the Golden Dawn is a fascinating cautionary talefor all who uy to develop their latent magical powers without usingthe protective techniques still taught in all the major religions. Fromit we see how the majoriry of those who attempt to tread the occultpath of power become the victims of their creative imagination,inflate their egos and fall. It took only fifteen years for the GoldenDawn to splinter into fragments. Now that its rituals, Flying Rollsand secretbooks ofinstruction have been published, it is becoming oncemore the inspiration of a mushroom growth of aspiring Magicians,most of whom in their turn are riding for a fall.The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (G.D.) with its InnerOrder of the Rose of nuby and the Cross of Gold (R.R. et A.C.)was the crowning glory of the occult revival in the nineteenth century.It synthesised into a coherent whole a vast body of disconnected andwidely scattered material and welded it into a practical and effectivesystem, which cannot be said of any other occult Order of which weknow at that time or since.The three vital rizuals which one of its founders, MacGregorMathers, wrote, were those for initiation into the Outer and InnerOrders and the Corpus Christi ceremony. In the first the candidatewas led from darkness into light and undertook 'to prosecute withzeal the study of the occult sciences, seeing that this Order is notestablished for the benefit of those who desire only superficial know-ledge thereof'.The ceremony of admission to the Inner Order of the Rose ofRuby and the Cross of Gold was based on the myth of ChristianRosenkreuz. In it the candidate swore 'that with the Divine permis-sion I will from this day forward apply myself to the Great Work,which is to purify and exalt my Spiritual naturre, that with the Divineaid, I 4ay at length attain to be more than human, and thus graduallyraise and unite myself to my Higher and Divine Genius and that inthis event I will not abuse the Great Power entrusted to me'.x111"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"ForevordIn the Neophyte ritual (oo: oo) the danger lies in omitting fromthe oath any reference to the purposes to which the powers resultingfrom the successful practice of these occult sciences should be put.The Second or Inner Order (yo- 6\") Obligation is far more dan-gerous, because unless specific precautions are taken, which they werenot, the magician soon begins to imagine that, being more thanhuman, he is God, instead of remaining a seryant of God.The third vital ritual, which took place annually on the day ofCorpus Christi, is admirable throughout. The Chief Adept in eachTemple, clad in the black robe of mourning and with the chain ofhumility round his neck, was bound to the black Cross of Sufferingin the Vault of the Adepts. There he invoked the Great AvengingAngel Hua 'to confirm and strengthen all the members of this Orderduring the ensuing revolution of the Sun; to keep them steadfaston the path of Solitude and Self-sacrifice; and to confer upon themthe power of discernment that they may choose between the evil andthe Good, and try all things of doubtful or fictitious meaning withknowledge and sound judgment'.After being released from the Cross and re-robing he again invokedHua, this time 'to strengthen and establish the Members of this Orderin their search for the Mysteries of Divine Light, to increase theirspiritual perception and enable them to rise from their selfhood, whichis nothing, unto that highest Selfhood which is God, the Vast One'.Unforrunately humility was not in Mathers's nature as is shownby the mottoes that he took: 'S Rioghail Mo Dhream (Gaelic for'Royal is my tribe') and Deo Duce Comite Ferro. Moreover thehistory of the order shows that too many members failed conspicuously'to try all things of a doubtful and fictitious nature', while Mathershimself fell for the wiles of the adventuress Swami Vive Ananda, whoalso called herself Madame Horos, and persuaded him that she was intouch with the Secret Chiefs.As can be seen froril the curriculum for the projected grade of Practi-cus Adeptus Minor, lo: 6o (see Appendix II, p. 288), the systemcreated by Mathers that had to be mastered by members of the InnerOrder was formidable. Some idea of what it was all about can be gotfrom a brief synopsis of his interpretation of the qabalistic diagramof the Tree of Life and a description of the furniture of the privateTemple in which a Magician of the R.R. et A.C. worked.The diagram of the Tree of I,ife represents the Universe as under-stood by the Jews before science altered their mode of thought.ForewordBoth its date and its origin are unknown since it formed part of theiresoteric uadition. It consiss of ten spheres or circles joined by twenfy-two Paths. God is not shown, for He is incomprehensible. By mathe-matical analogy, however, God is zero, which the Qabalists symbolisedby a trinity of Nothing (Ain) or the infinitely small, Without Limitrhyilf;ll,Figure r Cabbalistic Tree of Life diagram(Ain Soph), or space bereft of qualities and Limitless Light (AinSoph Aour). These are the first steps by which the Unknowableapproaches the known.This Limitless Light concenrrates into a centre or point of focuscalled the Crown (Kether), which is the top sphere in the diagram.KelherThe Crownx1v"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"ForevordMathematically it corresponds to the number r, in geometry to thepoint.

Of the further ascent intoLimitless Light and beyond nothing can be said.So much for the basic theory; now for the magical practice. Bychoosing a circle within which to work the A{dptus Minor in theInner Order of the R.R. et A.C. affirms both his identity with theInfinite and the limitation implied by his oath to perform the 'GreatWork'. The symbolism with which he decorates the circle announcesthe nature and object of the ritual in question and so varies with theoccasion. The proportions, however, remain fixed, since they arepersonal to him-it is his circle-and they are based upon the sizeof the akar, a double cube the top of which is level with hisnavel.Round the circle in Hebrew characters are the four great namesof cod used in the banishing ritual of the pentagram: rHvH, ADNr,.lnIn and ecr.e. Traditionally they protect the Magus within hiscircle, although in fact they need consecrating before they can do so.This is done in the banishing. ritual, part of which is designed toactivate the forces represented by these names.Within the circle is a Tau cross of ten squares, for 'ten are theEmanations of Uniry'. Each square represents one of the Sephirothand is painted in the correcr .colour of the eueen scale. For someceremonies other crosses would be more appropriate. The threediamond-shaped lozenges coloured from the King scale represent the'Triangle of the Universe' which escribes the cross. By their shapethey suggest theyoni thus balancingthe lingam of the cross.On the top of the altar is a design known as the Macrocosm ofVitruvius. The human figure in it is Adam Kadmon, the secondperson in the qabalistic triad whose body is the Universe. His limbsare arranged to form a pentagram instead of the more usual saltirecross. The zodiac, planets and four primary elements formed fromand part ofhis body are specifically indicated by the varied colouringof the concentric circles which form part of the design.On the sides of the altar are painted the four Tablets of the WatchTowers of the Universe in the Enochian system of Dr John Dee.That of air faces east, water west, earth north and fire south. Theyare coloured respectively in the King, Queen, Emperor and Empressscales. The lettering is in Enochian script. Above each tablet is thesigil of the elemental King concerned. These four kings are called inEnochian: Tahaoeloi, Thahebyobeetan, Thahaotahe and Ohooo-haatan. The Tablets of the Watch Towers with the srnall Tablet ofUnion, which is not needed here, are a mnemonic key to the Enochianxvlxv11"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Forewordsystem. The large ones are not easy to memorise, so that it is con-venient to have them permanently on the side of the altar.Within the altarare keptall the accessories used in the ritualsexceptthelamp. The holy consecrated oil of Abramelin is a symbol of the Magus'aspiration. Itisacompound of the oils of myrrh, cinnamon and galangaldissolved in that of olive. Its subtle perfume soon fills the room.The smoke of the incense is the gross vehicle of that aspiration,for it is in the smoke that the Magus sees-or imagines-the figureof the spiritual being that he has invoked. The incense itself is theprayer without which no invocation can succeed. The ingredientsvary with the type of being sought.The incense is burned in a brazier on charcoal kindled into a glowby the breath of the Magus. The brazier should stand in the east ofthe circle on an altar of open brass-work in which the metals ofVenus and Jupiter have been fused into an homogeneous alloy. Itsymbolises divine love.The scourge, dagger and chain suggest the sacrifice of penance.The first is to keep the aspiration of the Magus keenl the second toremind him that he will have to sacrifice all that he has and is beforehe can accomplish the Great \\fork and the third, the chain, is tokeep his thoughts from wandering.The wand is his will. There are four of them, each decorated withsymbols suitable for different types of ceremony. The lotus wandshould be of almond wood. The t'welve bands of colour on the stemare those of the signs of the zodiac, while on the top is a lotus bloom,symbol of the unfolding of naflrre and of spiritual growth. It shouldbe held by the band ofthe colour appropriate to the occasion.The sword is his reason, his power of critical analysis, to be usedagainst the demons of doubt. He wields it in the preliminary banishingritual, replacing it within the altar before commencing his invocation.The cup is his understanding, his link with the spiritual on thepassive side, so he offers up his blood in it. It is also a vehicle ofgraceand when he drinks from it he partakes of a sacrament.The bell represents thar.geculiar state of awareness without whichone is not conscious of the presence of a spiritual being. The Maglrstherefore strikes it at the climax of the ceremony.The lamen or talisman, if one is to be consecrated or charged, isretained in the circle or placed in the triangle outside according tothe nature of the force with which it is to be charged.The pantacle is the body of the Magus, the.temple of the spiritof God. It is the material basis of the sacrament of regeneration byForevordmeans of which he is rebom as a spiritual being. The design on itvaries with the nature of the being sought.The robe is the silence and secrecy in whic\\ the Magus works.It varies in accordance with his grade in the Orderland with the natureof the operation. The crown that he wears represents the attainmentof that work. It consists of a gold band with three pentagrams infront and a hexagram at the back. The band is the circle ofperfection;the three penhgrams are the celestial triad in whatever system he isusing, while the hexagram is the Magus himself. Round the band istwined the uraeus serpent with erect head and expanded hood. It idthc symbol ofroyaltyand initiation, for the Magus is both king and priest.Such was the official R.R. et A.C. teaching, which was usuallymodified in practice. Mathers, however, did not countenance thernaking of pacts with qliphotic or demonic forces, nor did he permitthe use of sex in any form. Owing to the nature of his temperamenthc gave a pagan, Egyptian twist to the whole system. Instead ofvorking through and in the name of the deiry of the force invoked,hc preferred to inflame himself with prayer and become whatever itmight be. Thus when his pupil Allan Bennett ('Iehi Aour') consecratedr talisman to protect Dr Felkin ('Finem Respice') from obsession,hc invoked in turn the 'spirit of Osiris Triumphant'-'the Divine$clf' of Frater Finem Respice-and the archangel 'l,tikhael who artlitc unto God'. But he then went on to address 'this creature ofttlismans' thus: 'I travel upon High, I tread upon the Firmament.I raise a Flame with the Flashing Lightning of Mine Eye. I fly forwardln the splendour of the Daily Glorified Ra. Thou art Myselt MineImage, My Shadow. I have fashioned Thy Form. I have fashioned ThySoul. I have made Thee a Creature of My Thought. Powerful artThou for ever against the Larvae that possess.'It was the same with the ritual that Mathers wrote for membersto attain the knowledge and conversation of their 'Higher Genius'ot augoeidEs, which equates with the daimdn of Socrates and thePhilemon of C. G. Jung. Mathers based it on Papyrus XLVI (Greek)ln the British Museum. Full of 'barbarous words of evocation', alumber of which are corrupt transliterations from spoken Egyptianto written Greek, it begins: 'Thee I invoke, the Headless One. Theethat didst create the Earth and the Heavens.' Then later: 'I am He, theBornless Spirit . . . I am the Grace of the World. The Heart girt withthe Serpent is my name.' Finally he declaimed: 'All Spirits of heaven,crrth, air and water and every spell and scourge of God are obedientunto me.' This normally results in an inflated ego.;l'1, I#trlffi;€,ii*r,.!rl,.i:l':t,llit ri.lx. 'xv111xlx"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"ForewordMathers showed his near genius in other ways. He reduced theincoherent mass of Dr John Dee's papers and diaries in the BritishMuseum and the Ashmolean at Oxford into a coherent and validsystem of Enochian magic. This was worked by members of theInner Order and survives today in the Order of the Cubic Stone.Unfortunately Dee, like so many members of the G.D., showed littlediscrimination over the often childish manifestations in the 'show-stone' or crystal produced by the creative imagination of his scryer ormedium, Edward Kelley. The system has a hierarchy, language andalphabet of its own and is far too complicated for summary herb.Mathers, whose talents were varied, then went a stage further byinventing Enochian chess, a four-handed game played on a three-dimensional board. The book of rules in my possession is one of theOrder's still unpublished manuscripts. It is said that once whenMathers, his wife and V. B. Yeats wanted a game, Mathers chose aspirit for his partner. Shading his eyes and gazing at the empty chairopposite he made the opening move with his partner's piece. Likehis pupil Aleister Crowley he sometimes indulged in the glamour ofbeing a Magus.Mathers resurrected from a corrupt manuscript in the Bibliothdquede Arsdnal at Paris another magical system with a hierarchy of itsown which he called The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage. Itinvolved some six months of solitary ritual and meditational workto attain the 'Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy GuardianAngel'. After that the adept could safely consecrate some forty-ninetalismans which gave him 316 'servitors'. Since it was probablyHebrew in origin the Magician did not himself become a guardianangel as in the more dangerous Egyptian ritual mentioned earlier, soMathers published it. The only member of the order known to havetried it out was Aleister Crowley, but he consecrated the talismansbefore he had experienced the 'knowledge and conversation'. Thereis some evidence that a few of them worked, although not always.They have all survived, a missing one being found in his pocketbook after he died.Some of the other subjects in the curriculum were astrology, theTarot, numerology, geomancy, the adoption of god forms, scryingin the 'spirit vision' and travelling on the 'astral plane'. A certainamount of glamour was included, especially in the practice for becom-ing invisible. This did not mean that you vanished, but that peopledid not notice that you were there. Needless to say Crowley claimedto have played the trick successfully.ForeyordWhether the members of the Order meddled with the Shells(Qliphoth); followed their aspirations by learning from the relevantspiritlal beings the secrets of the drirry 'aethytrl fro* Tex to Lil,or whatever it might be; practised the assumpdon of god forms ortravelled on the 'astral plane' to the planets or to each oiher, they en-Iarged theirknowledge ofthe universe and themselves. Bur to whaiendlWhy did it take only fifteen years for the Order of the Golden Dawnto splinter into quarrelling fragmentsi The simple answer is that itwas founded on a fraud. The founder of the Outer Order was DrWilliam Wynn W'estcott, a London coroner who was a Theosophist,a Freemason, and a member of the High Council of the SocietasR-osicruciana in Anglia. He was no Magician but a kindly scholarof all things occulr. His character is revealed by the *otto., that hechose: 'sapere Aude' (Dare to be wise) and .Non Omnis Moriar, (Iwill not altogether die). Now he had already fallen for the glamour ofHelena Petrovna Blavatsky's 'Mahatmas' and for the myth of theSecret Chiefs which haunts most modern Rosicrucians. Needing aSecret chief for his own order he invented one: Sapiens DominabiturAstris or Friiulein sprengel, and gave her an accommodation addressin Germany. He then caused five short letters from her to be forged.one of them authorised him to sign her momo on the charter for hisIsis-Urania Temple.That the Order got off the ground at all was due to the near-genius of anorher member of the High Council of the Soc. Ros.,namely S. L. MacGregor Mathers, \"ni th\" .*\".tt.n\". of *\" ,i*\"fJthat he wrote up from the cypher notes in the possession of westcott.Then, since he was a born Magician, he created and Westcott agreedto work the Inner Order of the Rose of Ruby and the Cross ofbold(R.R. et A.C.). Its rituals and secret books of instruction flowedred-hot from his creative imagination.Too canny ro commit himself to Westcott,s mythical FriiuleinSprengel in Germany, he claimed to have forged his own link withthe 'secret Chiefs' of whom, he wrote, ,I cin tell you nothing. Iknow not even their earthly names. I know them by certain seiretmottoes.' These may have been Lux Saeculorum, Lux Benigna andLux in Coelis, who head the list of members on the originai parch-ment roll of the R.R. et A.C. (see Appendix IV). fhe first numberedentry is for. Sapiens Dominabitur Astris, the mythical FreuleinSprengel, with an imaginary date of entry.

MissAnnie Horniman (iFortiter Et Recte') staked her claim to what shecalled the 'Purple Adept' and said that she was the real head of theOrder. Florencl Farr (Sapientia Sapienti Dona Date') and her'sphereGroup' were controlled by 'a certain Egyptian astral form' firstcontacted through a piece of his mummy case-or so F. L. Gardner('De Profundis Ad Lucem'), who was a member of her group for atime, once told me. Then when J. V. Brodie-Innes ('Sub Spe') wastrying to form a splinter group of his own he promoted himself to be\" b.p\"ty Archon Basileus, 'as commissioned by the Third Order, ornot to tn\"k\" any ambiguity in words, from those Higher Adepts whomI so term'.Dr R. .W.. Felkin ('Finem Respice'), who founded the StellaMatutina after the break with Mathers in rgoo, fell in turn for the 'SunMasters' and then for Ara Ben Shemesh, whom he described as 'adiscarnate Arab [with a] Temple in the Desert where the sons ofFire live . . . fth\"y are] in personal communication with the Divineand are no longer bound in the flesh so that their material life is amatter of will.'When in r9t8 the Arab moved on out of touch to a'Higher Plane', Felkin forged a link with'our Father in God C'R'C'[Chiistian Rosenkreuz] himself, who gives instructions from time toiime through Memberi who are clairvoyant and clairaudient to suchan extent ttat they are able to receive-them.' C.R.C., now the 'Lordof Light', was expected to manifest on the material plane before- ve-rylong,lhe date being given first as between ry26 and 1935 and finallyu\" t937. Felkin seems to have been protected from direct obsession bythe'talisman consecrated for him by Allan Bennett in 1898, but itcould not prevent him from believing in the fantasies of his femaleadepts.e. n. Wuit\" ('sacramentum Regis') was one of the members of theInner order who kept his head. When he somewhat unexpectedlytook charge of the Iiis-Urania Temple in ryo3 he refused to haveany truck with 'secret Chiefs' whether in or out of the body' Hereorganised the G.D. by rewriting the rituals in a more christian form\"nd iir.orruged the practice of Magic. As a result his Order lost muchof its appeal and he closed it down in r9r4.ForeutordThe most powerful Magician to be trained in the original Orderwas probably Aleister Crowley ('Perdurabo'). He broke with Mathersin r9o4 as a resuh of getting in touch with*lris own Secret Chiefs.We only know the name of one of them, Aivhz.

Apart from that objection, the literature is so vast, not tomention indigestible, the ramifications so bewildering, that the wholearea resembles an almost impenetrable jungle.rIn this book t offer a study, mainly based upon unpublisheddocuments, of a now famous Magical Order, the Hermetic Order ofthe Golden Dawn, whose heyday was during the r89os, althoughvarious successor Orders survived until much later.2 My aim hasbeen to investigate the origins, organisation and, above all, theinternal history of a representative modern Magical sodality. Herewere people engaged in extraordinary activities. I wanted to knowwho they were, what they did and achieved, and how they reactedto situations which were unusual, at least by normal standards. Ihave not attempted to describe or explain the Order's rituals ormagical teachings at any great length because this material is availableto the extent of more than a thousand pages in Dr Regardie's TheGolden Dawn.s In any case I lack the necessary technical qualifications.r For an excellent preliminary map of the terrain see James Webb, The Flight fronReaton (vol. r, The t4ge of the frrational, ry7t1' vol, z, The Battle for Realhy, in press).Mr Webb throws new light upon the historical continuity of occult beliefs and theenduring presence of an occultist 'underground' which rejects the prevailing Establish-ment Welmnschauung,z Today there are at least two British Temples which perpetuate the G.D. tradition andclaim an apostolic succession from the original Ordlr.

Students of English literature righdy infer that w. B. Yeats'smembership of the Order-he joined it in r89o when he was twenty-five years of age-had a notable influence upon his imaginative andpoetical development. Students of occultism, on the other hand,itrppos. that the G.D. represents a particularly authoritative sourceofmagical knowledge and instmction. I am not concemed with theguestion of 'authority', but believe that the Order's synthesis ofHermetic knowledge and practical magical techniques was a uniquephenomenon. Nothing like it had ever existed in the past.No previous magical or occult fraterniry had offered (a) a compar-able instruction in magical theory and practice, allied with (b) acomplicated and therefore intriguing hierarchical system and (c)a series of nine rituals which effectively incorporated the Order'selaborate symbolism.In the G.D., then, we encounter an important reservoir of 'hiddenknowledge'based upon an ingenious construction of arbitrary relation-ships between different symbolical systems' e.g. the Cabbalistic Treeof Life, astrology, alchemy, the Tarot trumPS and so on. Duringthe r89os the Order represented the eguivalent of a Hermetic Univer-siry, with an exacting series of examinations leading to the eguivalentof a post-graduate degree in the Theoricus Adeptus Minor grade. Thissynthesis was mainly the creation of Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers(r8y4-r9I8), an extraordinary man by any standard ofassessment.It is unimportant that Mathers's ingeniously devised synthesis of'correspondences' between a variety of symbolical systems, e.g. theCabbala, astrology, alchemy and the Tarot, was empirical and theproduct of his own incredible imagination. What is significant isthat he, and to a lesser extent'W'estcottr introduced people to a worldof symbolism, of 'archetypes' if one has a preference for Jungianterminology, which must have been completely unfamiliar to mostwhen they encountered it for the first time. Yeats recalled that it wasmainly through Mathers that he began certain studies and experiencesthat were to convince him that images well up before the mind's eyefrom a deeper source than conscious or subconscious memory.rThose who joined the G.D. during the r89os had access to a store ofr W. B. Yeats, lumbiographics, t926, p. zt7.Preface'hidden' or 'rejected' knowledge-some of its departments belongto what some people claim to be'the perennial V,isdom'-that had nocontemporary counterpart in the .west. It wad certainly far moreelaborately codified than anything the Theosophical Soiiety couldoffer. To that extent the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, asdevised by Mathers and Westcott, was impressive.In many respects this is a 'mad' chronicle, at least if iudged byconventional norrns; but then we are dealing with unconventionilpeople. It will serye no useful purpose if I constantly draw attentionto the story's intermittent psychopathic qualities. My task is not tosit in judgment upon my Magicians but, rather, to provide the materialfor an unusual case history.Itis significant that the G.D. emerged during the late rggoswhen therewas a noticeable expansion ofinterestin occultism. There was somethinglike an underground explosion. Its waves can be charted in GreaiBritain and Francel they did nor reach Germany until rather later. Theexplosion itself was hardly noticed by the Establishment, but it wasfel_t by many who were no longer satisfied with conventional religiousbeliefs. The influence of Helena petrovna Blavatsky,s TheosoplicalSociety was notable in this context It is true that a candidaie foradmission to the G.D. had to acknowledge his or her belief in theexistence of a 'supreme Being' but the old pagan gods, in the shape ofPlanetary Spirits, were welcome providing thit th-y could be correctlyinvoked; however, the G.D.'s magic was white, not black.The G.D. first aroused my curiosity in 196r when I read A. E. Waite'sautobiography Shadows of Ltf, and Thought, ry39. It contains twolong references to the Order, which he joined in-ia9r.

In rggT DrWilliam Wynn 'W'estcott, a London coroner whose private interestswere occultism and Freemasonry, acquired an apparently ancientmanuscript written in a cypher. He found the key and made a tran-scription. This revealed the fragmentary outlines, written in English,of five mystical or pseudo-Masonic rituals. He invited his friend SamuelLiddell MacGregor Mathers, also an occultist and a Freemason, toexpand the material found in the Cypher MS. so that the rituals couldbe performed.Among the leaves of the Cypher MS. Westcott came across asheet of paper on which were written the name and address of a certainFriiulein Sprengel, an eminent Rosicrucian Adept who lived inGermany. Now aware of a connection between this lady and therituals he wrote to her and received a reply. She authorised him tofound an English branch of a German occult Order called ,DieGoldene Diimmerung', i.e. The Golden Dawn. This led to the estab-lishment of the Isis-Urania Temple of the Hermetic Order of theGolden Dawn in London in 1888. Westcott invited Mathers andD_t W. R.'Woodman, yet another occultist Freemason, to join him asChiefs of the new Temple.Hence the salient features of the G.D. saga are the Cypher MS.,Friulein Sprengel and the Isis-Urania Temple's link with I G\".manoccult Order.Until recently, when I found about sixry sheets of the Cypher MS. inthe Private Collection, the only known copy of the cypher textbelonged to A. E. Waite, who died in ry42. After his death thismanuscript was acquired by a friend of mine, who told few peoplethat he owned it because he did not want to be pestered by occulUsts.He kindly allowed me to make a Xerox copy and I was familiar vrithits contents before I discovered the private Collection.xxxii"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Suspect Documentswaite's speculations about the date and provenance of the originalCypher MS. in Shadavs of Ltft and Thought, 1938, were based uponthe toxtual analysis of his own copy. He had joined the Golden Dawnin r89l and had known Westcott, Mathers and woodman. He hadobviously seen the manuscript, which was no doubt temporarily inhis possession when his own copy was made for him by a professionalscribe, perhaps during the early r9oos.He mistrusted the alleged antiquity of the Cypher MS. ttre wasalso unsure of its source. However, he was convinced that it mucthave been a very recent production. There was material drawn fromancient Egyptian texts, but scholan had been unable to read thehieroglyphs until J. F. Champollion deciphered them in c. r8zz.Then there were the allusions to the supposed correspondencesberween the tnrenty-two Paths of the Cabbalistic Tree of Life andthe rwenty-t'wo Major Trumps of the Tarot pack. For this hypothesisthe earliest known source was Eliphas Lfvi's Dogme et rituel de khaute magiz, which was published irs recently as 1856. Waite's con-clusion was that the ritual notes must have been written after r87o.A minor discovery of my own apPears to confirm this suggestion.Facing p. 616 in K. R. H. Mackenzie's The Royal Masonic Cyclopedia,1877, there is an extraordinary table of so-called Rosicrucian grades.In this there is a column of 'Brotherhood Names', e.g. Pereclinus deFaustis, Porajus de Reiectus, Monaceros de Astris, etc. In the cyphernotes for the Zelator grade there is a short sefltence which reads:'I name you Pereclinus Faustis.' It appears tolerably certain that theauthor of the Cypher MS. found'Pereclinus de Faustis'in Mackenzie'sbook, decided that it sounded impressive and used it in the Zelatorgrade. I have notbeenable to find thename inanyearlier Englishwork.tln Shadows of Lrf, and Thought (p. zr8), Waite mentioned thepaper used for the Cypher MS.Now the G.'. D.'. depended for its warrants [i.e. authority]on certain notes of Rituals in English, iotted down in anoccult alphabet, the source of which is to be found no furtheroff than the British Museum. Its concealed authors possessed alsoor contrived to secure a small sheaf of rag paper in larger Mackenzic wrote that his table of grades had 'never before been published . . ' and thestatements therein are derived from many sources of an authentic character, but havenever been collected before.' Howevet, he translated the complete table direcdy fromMagister Pianco [i.e. Hans Heinrich von Ecker und Eckhoffen], Dcr Roten*rcuqcrin seincr Bl6sse, t78r. Hence this earlier bookcould have been the source although itsecms unlikely.Suspect Docutnentsquarto, bearing the watermark of 1789; and so long as this lasteddrey made their notes thereon, almost obviously with intent todeceive. When the leaves failed they used other paper, as nearlylike as may be.He was wrong about the watermark date. Most of the paper usedfor the Cypher MS. is from the same making and about hilfa dozenleaves have an r8o9 watermark. The sheets are small rather than largeqrrarto. A muddy shade of brown ink was used to make it appear asif the manuscript was old. Waite continued (p. zr9):There are three explanatory hypotheses which can be advancedconcerning the Ritual Notes: (l) that the concealed authorsmay have been Westcott and Woodman, with whom Matherscollaborated after they were fabricated; but I knew all the peopleconcerned and I am utterly assured that the invention wasbeyond their scope; (z) that they came into the hands of thesepersons by purchase from an unknown source; or were receivedeither from the Rev. A. F. A. Woodford, who compiled aconsiderable part of Kenning's Cyclopeedia of Freemasonry,or from Kenneth Mackenzie, who wrote up a similar productiona little later on; (3) that ifso received or alternarively-picked upat a bookstall*as one of the stories goes-they may have been(a) the inventor's first draft of a projected Rite or (b) thejottings of a Member made for his private use, being summarynotes of Ceremonies witnessed by himself. They are in anycase vestiges of an unfinished scheme, brefing off at theGrade of Philosophus, which ends the First Order, as thenformulated.It is impossible to deduce from the manuscript who made the'summary notes of Ceremonies'and this mystery may never be solved.A detailed analysis of the contents of the Cypher MS. would notinterest the general reader. However, judging by the scanry nature ofthe available material Mathers used both his imagination and hisingenuity when he composed rituals that could actually be performed.A single instance will suffice to show Mathers's inventiveness. In theTheoricus ritual one brief sentence in the Cypher MS. reads: 'H[iero-phant] recites prayer of gnomes.' Mathers recalled the 'Oraison desSylphes'in L6vi's Dogme et ritucl (vol. z, chap. 4) and translated it.rr For Mathers's rendering see Israel Regardie, The Gold* Dewn, 1969, vol. z, p. g9.It can also be found as 'The Prayer of the Sylphes or Air Spirits, in A.

It will be noted, however, that he was inclined toaccept the G.D.'s'remote German connections'.on the balance of probability, I conclude-with almost utterdetachment over the whole subiect (r) that the G.D. RitualNotes were produced well after r87o-perhaps even ten yearslater; (z) that they were not the work of Westcottr Woodmanand Mathers; (3) that it is unsafe to challenge their remoteGerman connections . . . ; (+) that the original Isis-UraniaTemple may have started work in London with the tacitrecognition of the fact on the part of some not dissimilarInstitution existing previously in Germany; (5) that it was neverauthorised officially; (6) that it was not under any German orContinental Obedience; (7) that it was not responsible toanything but its own official Headship; (8) that a Pretendedwarrant which was exhibited to Neophytes was no better than asolemn mockery; (9) that the Rite laid claim, by implicationor otherwise, on remote antiquity; (ro) that it was to this extenta mountebank concernl (l r) that it was described invariably asgoverned by a Triadic Headship; (rz) that when Dr Woodmanpassed away the vacancy caused by his death was never filled,io the expressed and unexpressed dissatisfaction ofseveral oldermembers (p. ,\"1).Hence there was something fishy about the whole thing, butwhatever it was could not be easily pin-pointed. During the Order'sheyday in the r89os nobody can have asked searching guestions aboutthe Cypher MS., Friiulein Sprqqgel or the 'Warrant. Again, sinceoccultists are not the most scePtical of mortals, it may not haveoccurred to most members of the Order that some bits and piecesof the traditional G.D. 'story' did not fit together.Mathers's accusation, which arrived out of the blue in Februaryr9oo, that Westcott had 'forged or caused to be forged' the lettershe claimed to have received from Friiulein Sprengel, came like athunderclap. Mathers said, too, that Westcott had pledged him yearsago to s\"\"ti\"y before showing him 'what he had either done or causedto be done'. Hence if Mathers's reproaches were true he, too, hadbeen party to a conspiracy.Suspect Docutnentswaite recalled that 'the ansriler of westcott to this charge did notadmit of its accuracy but pointed out-in almost tremulou-=sthat his witnesses were dead and that he wourd therefore remainneutral'. And Mathers, Waite added, ,being brought to book on thesubject, refused absolutely and unconditionally io justify his state-ments'. In r9oo, therefore, the credibility of many cherished beliefs,not to mention that of the order itself, was strained to the utmost.A committee of enquiry was set up to investigate all the circum-stances that led to the foundation of the c.D. iniasT-s. It achievedlittle because neither rrestcott nor Mathers could be summoned forcross-examination. westcott did not offer to produce the letters.He was asked to make the cypher MS. availabL and gave a ratherhalf-hearted consent, but whether the committee ever lad it is un-certain. Not that its members would have learned much from it.I found the original 'Friiulein Sprengel' letters in the privatecollection, some of them briefly anttoiut Jin'westcott's handwriting.It is impossible to say when they reached this archive, but westcJttmay_ have given them and some other documents, including theCypher MS. and the Isis-Urania Temple's 'Warrant, to a iniormember of the stella Matutina, one of the G.D.'s successor orders,before he migrated to South Africa in October r9r9.The unexpected discovery of the letters led to a detective operation.Ia view of the allegations of forgery it was necessary to sub;ect sixdocuments, written in German and purporting to be of German'origin,to a searching examination. Four more, all in English, *\"r\" ulro -p.riaside for careful inspection. These papers are described below in theiralleged chronological order. I have used the word 'alleged' withintention. It is most unlikely that the German letters either lriginatedin Germany or were written by a German. Everything points t-o theirbeing fabrications. Hence two dated and two undate-cr-documents inEnglish also had to be regarded as suspect. As for the two withdates, it must be remembered that letters,ltc. can be falsely dated forpurposes of deception.t. Dr lvestcott's memorandun of a conversation in February zgg6t'ith the Rev. A. F.

His reporg dated r4 March r97r,contains fifty-three numbered paragraphs and a summary of hisconclusions.Suspect DocutnentsIn Herr Schlag's opinion all the German documents are textuallysuspect because no one born and educated in Germany would havewritten such jargon. orthographical and grammatical errors abound,not to mention freguent anglicisms which no German would haveused. Herr Schlag ironically remarked that it was srrange that Friuleinsprengel's close associates in Germany both appearedio be of sririshnationaliry. The gentleman who wrote to say that she had died wasuncertain of her sex. He referred to 'our liarned friend, and used'urrneres' (our: masculine) instead of 'unsere' (our: feminine).The textual evidence suggests that 'Westcott organised a seriesof faked documents in order to give the impression that the HermeticOrder of the Golden Dawn derived its authority and starus from anenigmatic German source. My assumption is that Friiulein Sprengel/Soror S.D.A. was a mythical person and that he invented her. Theredoes not seem to be any reasonable alternative.Thele were historical precedents for legendary characters suchas Soror S.D.A. In the annals of Freemasonry there are the SecretChiefs (Superiores Incogniti) introduced by Baron von Hund (t7zz-76) to add lustre to his 'strikte Observanz' German high-gradeMasonic system. However, I do not believe that W'estcott had themin mind when he concocted Friulein Sprengel. It is far more likelythat the source of his inspiration was Madame Blavatsky's mysteriousand invisible Mahatmas, the Masters Morya and Koot Ho-omi, themessengers of a hidden Occult Brotherhood, whose letters to herliterally appeared out of thin air, or so many believed.The impact made by Helena petrovna Blavatsky's TheosophicalSociety and teachings during the late r88os is now hardly rememiered,but Westcott would have been very conscious of it. A. p. Sinnett,sO9c-uh World, published in r88r, not only gave a fascinating accountof her occult activities in India but created a widespread iiterest incircles ready for an altemative to spiritualism, which was beginningto lose its novelty. Thus when Madame Blavatsky settled perminentlyin London in May 1887 she was already well known, even notorious.Her presence brought many new recruirs to the Theosophical Society:W. B. Yeats was one of them. Thus if Westcott did, in fact, obtainpossession of the Cypher MS. in August 1887, very soon after herarrival in London, it was at a time when tftere was more public interestin occultism than there had ever been in the past. Thii combinationof circumstances may have put a number of iieas into his head.Madame Blavatsky's brand of occulrism, with its millange ofBuddhist and Hindu elements, as well as much aken from old Euro-i.,,',tl,,]rj,i'1i'i t."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Suspect Documentspean sources or simply 'thought uP'by H,.P.B' herself, would haveinterested Westcott but it did not persuade him to apply for member-ship of the Theosophical Society.

In this context it shouldnot be forgotten that Westcott had for many years been a Freemason'In somJrespects V'estcott's Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawnwas a by-product of his connection with a Masonic 'Rosict'ncian'fraterniry called the Rosicrucian Sociery of England, also known asthe societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, or more familiarly as the Soc. Ros.Membership was confined to Master Masons. It was not a MasonicLodge but an esoteric society of Freemasons who were interested inoccultism, the Cabbala in particular, and Masonic symbolism' Theearly history of the Soc. Ros. is discussed in the next chapter. Some ofthe original male members of the G.D. were recruited from it.In r886 W'estcott was the secretary of its Metropolitan (i.e. London)College and both he and Mathers were members of its High Council'theiifriend Dr 'W'oodman, who was also to become a Chief of theG.D., was the Society's Supreme Magus or Head. K. R. H. Mackenzie,whose name is mentioned in the document printed below, hadpreviously been a member but had resigned. He claimed to be aRosicrucian initiate and to have a profound knowledge of occultism.The Rev. Adolphus F. A. Woodford, who may have possessed theCypher MS. and then given it to W'estcott' was not a member of theSociety, although the latter hoped to persuade him to join it.fhe first of the documents that has a bearing uPon 'Westcott'sGolden Dawn scheme is a memorandum in'W'estcott's handwritingheaded: ,Note of a conversadon with A.F.A.\\X/. Feb. 1886'. Theexistence of the Cypher MS. is now revealed.I having pressed him to join the Soc. Ros. in Ang. he saidhe wouldsome day, but he did not care much for it, he knewthat they could not add to his Rosicfrucian] knowledge, becausehe had in his possession some real Rosic. MSS. in cypher, awhole series of degrees, but not yet the whole of the Rosic'system and that he had once shown K. R. H. Mac[kenzie] asheet of them, and also some translation and K. R. H.

Nor were these 'Rosicrucian' .*-.\"pt that theirnum€ration may have reminded woodford of something rathersimilar in Mackenzie's Royal Masonic Cyclopedia, rg77r\"i.e. thecurious table of grades facing p. 616 in the articlJ on'Rosicrucianism'.The suggestion that Eliplias L6vi (i.e. the Abb6 Alphonse-Louisconstant, r8re-7;) once had the cypher MS. at least gave it a notableprovenance. Ldvi was the most renowned latter-day expositor ofmagical lore and had achieved an almost legendary starus. H; had beenin London in r8y4 and again in rg6r utrd h\"d \"ont\".t, with Britishoccultists; but Ldvi knew very little English and if he ever had theCypher MS. it would not have meant much to him. I was unable tofind the page with the initials A.L.C.The question remains whether this is a true record of a conversationor a later fabrication. I cannot decide.Voodford is supposed to have senr the Cypher MS. to .W.estcot,together with a letier, in August rgg7. I have already mentioned thatthe original letter has not survived and there is only the copy in'westcotcs handwriting on which he wrote: 'Mathers has originalin the Box at the of[ce'.

Again, why did V'oodford so vaguely referWestcott to the elderly Soror S.D.A. who once lived at Ulmt Theimplication is that he had never seen the sheet of paper with thecypher text which identified her as Friulein Sprengel with an accom-modation address at Stuttgart.If Kenneth Mackenzie had still been alive-he died on 3 Julyr886-he would have been better able to help than Frederick Hockley,who died on ro November 1885, because he knew German extremelywell and even claimed to have received a German 'Rosicrucian'initiation. Finally Woodford died on z3 December 1887 and withhis death no further enguiries, convenient or otherwise, were possible.There are two possible hypotheses: (a) The copy of Woodford'sletter was genuine and not faked by Westcott. Next, W'oodford knewor had heard about someone who used the motto 'sapiens DominabiturAstris' but was unable to give 'Westcott any precise information.Finally, if westcott tried to fface Soror S.D.A., he failed to do soand then invented an 'identity' for her as 'Freulein Sprengel'. Alterna-tively (b) Westcott fabricated what was supposed to be a copy of aletter from Woodford soon after the latter's death. Here the implicationis that the original said to be in Mathers's possession never existed.My own attempts in Germany to discover even a trace of the'Goldene Diimmerung' during the period r86e-9o were unsuccessful.I was not the first to search for Friiulein Sprengel and her Order inGermany. Gustav Meyrink (1868-1932), the author of the famousoccult novel Der Golem, r9r1, had tried during the rgzos and haddrawn a blank.tThe Cypher MS., no matter who wrote it or whence it came, hadan independent existence in itq own right, unconnected with suspectdocuments and an elusive lady who once lived at Ulm, although it isdoubtful whether she was ever alive and well there or anywhere else.Thus once Mathers had supplied the rituals the G.D. could have beenstarted without further ado. Hence there was no real need for such anelaborate documentation, except thit for westcott's Masonic friendsfrom the Rosicrucian Society, who were likely to be his first recruits,evidence of an 'authority' deriving from a hierarchical 'system' wouldbe useful, perhaps even essential.r There is a brief allusion to this in a lettet from Dr H. Birven, of Berlin-Wittenau, toMr Gerald Yorke (ru March r95o). Dr Birven had collaborated with Meyrink. Birven'sview was that if Soror S.D.A. ever o<isted, the name Sprengel must be a pseudonym.Meyrink knew that the G.D.'s title in Hebrew (paca Westcott) was 'Chabrat ZerehAur Bocher' and mentioned it, although not in a G.D. context, in Der Golcm. SeeThe Golan, English translation 1928, p' r5r.Suspcct DocwuntsNeither'Westcott nor Mathers, who appears to have known, moreor less, what was afoot, were swindlers in the accepted sense of theword; but they were occultists and therefore liable to confuse illusionand reality. In the case of Mathers this human frailty will be veryapparent when we come to the story of the Second Order after rggzand, in particular, his Manifesto of z9 October 1896.It will be recalled that A. E. Waite had suggested that the key tothe Cypher MS. could be 'found no further off than the nritishMuseum'. 'Westcot, who knew the old literature of magic and oc-cultism, would have soon consulted any one of half a dozen editionstt1x\\t2&z Key to the Golden Dawn cypher alphabetof the Polygraphiae of the Abbot Johann Trithemius e46z-r5ft).There is an excellent illustration-it is reproduced here-of thecypler alphabet and its key in the paris edition of r;6r. According toTrithemius, the cypher, which is in fact an artificial alphabet, was usedby alchemists to conceal their secrets. Hence it had i suitably occultflavour. The task of making a transcription would not have givenWestcott much trouble.Something at the beginning of the first ritual would have arousedhis curiosity. The Hierophant, whom he would have identified as theprincipal officer in the Temple, calls upon the 'Fratres and Sorores[of this Temple of the] Golden Dawn' to assist him to open [theproceedings] in the 'grade of Neophyte'. This would have beenWestcott's first encounter with the name 'Golden Dawn'. The refer-ence to 'Fratres and Sorores' would have told him that the G.D., ifit existed at all, had no connection with regular Freemasonry, to whichwomen are not admitted.xl>altthWxqorEerpqgoll'9rlok6Igme,n€)o .(D.PC)IOII"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Suspect Documents'W'estcott wrote to Mathers from his home at 396 Camden Road on4 October 1887.

Perhaps he had not yet thoughtof inventing Soror S.D.A. The 'complete scheme of initiation' refersto his wish to work all the five grades for which there was materialin the Cypher MS.Mathers, who was always penurious, was remunerated for hiswork. According to 'Westcott: 'I paid Mathers to translate and workout the rituals from my original cypher drafts.' (Letter to F. L.Gardner, 5 April r9rz.)It was perhaps a little later that Westcott added an additional leafto the Cypher MS. In order to transcribe the material the text mustbe read from right to left, as in Hebrew and Arabic. This leaf, whichhad clearly not been written by whoever was responsible for the mainmanuscript, puzzled me when I uied to decipher it because the resultwas gibberish. However, when I read the cypher [See Plate II] fromleft to right a'message' vras revealed:Sapiens dom ast is a chief among the members of die goldenedammerung [i.e. Golden Dawn] she is a famous soror her nameis fraulein sprengel letters reach her at herr j enger hotelmarquardt stuttgart she is 7 : 4 [figures in Hebrew characters]or a chief adept.After the word 'Marquardt' 'W'estcott wrote 'who lived here often',meaning Friulein Sprengel. Soror S.D.A. provided an ideal solutionto Westcott's problem. By locating her in Germany he made herinaccessible, and by investing her with an exalted rank in a suitablymysterious German occult Order he made her a credible source ofauthority.The Hotel Marquardt existed and was a very respectable establish-ment. It will be noticed that Westcott was careful to provide anaccommodation address for Soror S.D.A. Aware from previousexperience that German police registers, when they happen to survive,Suspect Documantsoften provide evidence of residence, I wrote to the wiirttembergstate Archive at Stuttgart and asked for a search to be made. Theriwas no trace of either Friiulein Sprengel or Herr Enger, which washardly surprising.'Westcott never said that he met Friiulein Sprengel face to face.Later he only claimed that he had corresponded with her. However,in the Private collection there is a Hotel Marquardt billhead datejr December 1887. W'hoever was rhere had a meal, a glass of pilsenerbeer and tq/o cognacs but did not stay overnight. on this documentWestcott wrote in pencil: 'SD Ast was here', but omitted to say when.I assume that a friend who was travelling in Germany ,uppii\"d thebillhead, which at least provided a useful piece of circumstantiarevidence. Indeed, it might have been in his possession before heor someone else manufactured the cypher document that statedthat letters for Soror S.D.A. could be-sent to Herr Enger at thehotel.I shall now try to reconstruct how the Soror S.D.A. correspondencemight have been produced. wesrcott had a financial interest in abusiness called the Sanitary W'ood Wool Company (Hartmann,sPatents), suppliers of surgical dressings, which had an ofHce at rrHatton Garden, London, E.C. A certain Mr Albert Essinger, whosename suggests a German origin, was employed in this firm. On rzSeptember 1898 Essinger gave 'Westcott a signed and witnesseddeclaration to the effect that he had'assisted Dr. w. wynn'w'estcottwith a German correspondence, translated German letters and wroteletters for him in German' in 1887-8.^ In order to play the Soror S.D.A. 'game' properly it was necessaryfor. westcott to appear to write to her uni for a potential witnessto know about the correspondence. Howeverr'westcttt,s letters, dulytranslated by MI Fl,ssinger, would not have been posted. The Engfisltext of one such letrer, in'Westcott's handwriting, is in the pri-vateCollection. On it Westcott wrote: 'Translated by fr4r E[ssinger] asbefore'.'Westcott next drafted Soror S.D.A.,s ,replies, in English. Anunidentified person-graphological evidence indicates that ii was notMr Essinger-then made painfully literal translations into what hesupposed was German. As and vrhen Soror S.D.A.,s letters .arrived,,westcott gave them to Mr Essinger for translation back intoEnglish.- At one stage I compared the unwatermarked papers on whichthe 'Friulein Sprengel' lerters were written wlth tirirty or more of|ili'.i:1'{t2t3"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Suspect DocumentsDr Westcott's letters to F. L. Gardner. My immediate conclusion wasthat Westcott had at least taken the trouble to provide himself with asmall supply of stationery paper of continental origin. In this contextperhaps I may be permitted to mention that I have a printing industrybackground and during the war specialised in'document manufactu{e'and am therefore not without experience in assessing papers. However,the letters were in due course sent to Holland, where they werecarefully examined by a group of experts headed by Mr C. Pels.Mr Pels's report stated that the 'wire marks' and type of surface-glazesuggested that the papers were manufactured abroad, possibly inGermany, rather than in Great Britain. In any case during the r88osthere was a two-way trade in stationery paPers berween Great Britainand Germany and it would not have been very difficult for Westcottto obtain paper made in Germany. I suspect that we exported goodquality cream-woves and -laids and imported cheaper papers.None of the letters alleged to have been from Soror S.D.A. wasin the lady's own handwriting. They were supposed to have beenwritten for her by her secretary, a certain Frater 'In Utroque Fidelis'.The first letter is undated but Westcott wrote 'Recd. z6 Nov. r887' onthe German version. The following English text is either'Westcott'sdraft or Essinger's translation, probably the former.Dear Brother,I have long left the address to which you sent a letter butit has safely reached me at last. I am very glad to hear thatthe private papers which you describe have been found oncemore, they were lost by poor Abb6 Constant [i.e. Eliphas L6vi]years ago and then came into the hands of two Englishmen whoapplied for leave to use them. The Temple of Hermanubis wasgranted to them, but I never heard that anything useful hadhappened.As you have succeeded in undrirsranding them I do by mypov/er raise you to the 7 - 4 [grade] of the Second Order inEngland, the I'aube dor6e of France and Die goldene Diimmerungof the German nation.Begin a new Temple No. 3 and choose two learned persons toform the first three chiefs; when you have raised three moreadepts to ; : 6 you may be independent.Hermetic science languishes in our time, we are but veryfew even here, but are very eamest and possess much power,but we mistrust posts and letters, so cannot help or tell youSuspect Docutnentsvery much.

Finally we have'Secretary' for Sekretcir and 'Lodge' for Loge. These solecisms are sotypical that it is unnecessary to mention the many similar errors thatoccur in the other German letters.This letter was not written by Dr Westcott the coroner but,rather, by his alter ego the Greatly Honoured Frater Non OmnisMoriar, a Secret Chief. Soror S.D.A. was his Doppelgdnger, a wraithwho recorded his reveries and plans.The story that Eliphas L6vi once had the Cypher MS. is repeated.Perhaps in Westcott's imagination L€vi had once been Chief of the'L'aube dor6e' in France. The manuscript then returns to Englandand with German permission two Englishmen start the HermanubisTemple but without achieving very much. If Westcott's new Templewas to be No. 3, then 'Hermanubis'was No. z and Soror S.D.A.'s'Licht, Liebe, Leben' was No. r. An 'apostolic succession' was thusdevised. The Golden Dawn had irs roots in the past when it was stillmerely one of 'Westcott's fantasies.In the letter Soror S.D.A. told him to choose two more Chiefs,but this 'instruction' merely confirmed a decision that Westcotthad already made. Furthermore, it was a logical one. Any statementthat he alone had been authorised by a mysterious German sourceto found the Golden Dawn in England might not have been believed,hence the necessity for enlisting Mathers and Woodman. There isnothing in the Cypher MS. to suggest that three Chiefs would be needed.By now Westcott must already have designed the G.D.'s apparentlycomplicated grade structure. When he studied the Cypher MS. hemay have been surprised to find that the names of four of the fivegrades mentioned in it corresponded to the four lowest grades of theSocietas Rosicruciana in Anglia.

These, according to the legend, could only be achievedby even more mysterious Secret Chiefs, namely those behind theSecret Chiefs of the Second Order.

The holder of this highest ofall grades must surely be an lpsissimus. The grade was added and thescheme was complete. Since 'Westcott was a Cabbalist its inclusionwas only logical. In the Cypher MS. there were references to the tenSephiroth (Emanations of the Deity) of the Cabbalistic Tree of Life.Hence the second series of numerals from ro to r in descending ordercould only refer to the ten Sephiroth, with a preliminary oo : oograde outside the series.Westcott had the good sense not to promote himself and hiscolleagues, or for that matter Soror S.D.A., to the supreme rank ofIpsissimus. Instead he devised a more subtle arrangement. They wouldall have the 7o : 4\" grade, the highest in the Second Order, and inthat capacity function as Secret Chiefs, i.e. remain completely anony-mous and be known only by Latin mottoes.There was a precedent for the mottoes in the Soc.

Itis not improbable that the four symbolical line drawings were executedby Mina Bergson, Mathers's future wife, who had recently been astudent at the Slade School.

It will be noticed that it was addressed to Westcott in hislo : 6o capaciry and that it was signed not by a 7o :4o but simplyby a Chief Adept. Hence this document, which involved no 'breachof security', could have been shown at the Equinox meeting.

Since the Soc. Ros. adopted the gradenames of the late eighteenth-century German Masonic Order of theGold and Rosy Cross (Gold- und Rosenkreuzer Orden) it is possiblethat whatever Little unearthed originated from that source.Little was acguainted with Kenneth Mackenzie (b. fiy), who hada good knowledge of the German language, hence if Little's paperswere in German Mackenzie could translate them.l Egually importantfor Little, Mackenzie claimed to be a Rosicrucian initiate. Accordingto Westcott in rgoo: 'Little availed himself of certain knowledge andauthority which belonged to Brother Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie whohad, during a stay in earlier life, been in communication with GermanAdepts who claimed a descent from previous generations of Rosicru-cians. German Adepts had admitted him to some grades of theirsystem, and had permitted him to attempt the foundation of a group ofRosicrucian students in England, who under the Rosicrucian namemight form a partly esoteric sociery.''W'estcott's evident acceptance of Mackenzie's 'authoriry' shouldbe noted. Little had found certain 'Rosicrucian' papers and theimplication is that he asked Mackenzie to give him a 'Warrant orCharter. It does not appear necessary to take Mackenzie's allegedRosicrucian affiliations very seriously. In any event no contemporaryGerman Rosicrucian group can be identified.Mackenzie was ineligible to join Little's new Rosicrucian Socierybecause he did not belong to any Lodge recognised by the EnglishMasonic authorities. And yet his uncle, with whom he was on friendlyterms, was none other than John Hervey, Grand Secretary of theUnited Grand Lodge of England. Mackenzie did not join an EnglishLodge until March r87o and even then did not apply for membershipof the Rosicrucian Society, presumably because he had little use for it.He became an honorary member in April fi72 and was the Society'sAssistant Secretary in fi74*1 but resigned in the latter year.r In r8;u, when Mac-kenzie was only nineteen, his name appeared on the title-page asthe editor of an English tanslation of C.

In the April 1874issue of The Rosicrucian he wrote: 'The Hermetic Order of Egyptis one of a very exclusive character. I have only met with six individualswho possessed it, and of these two were Germans, two Frenchmenand two of other nations.' F. G. Irwin was in Paris in 1874 and whenhe returned asked Mackenzie about the Order. In his letter to Irwinof z3 October r 874 Mackenzie said: 'I can give you very little informa-tion about the Hermetic Order of Egypt. Constant [i.e. Ldvi] couldhave given you far more than I could-he was one of my preceptors.'Mackenzie was one of the first in Great Britain to concern himselfwith the alleged occult significance of the Tarot cards. Tarot sym-bolism was later to play an important role in the Golden Dawn. Hereit is only necessary to mention that the 'occult Tarot' legend wasfirst developed by Eliphas Ldvi and is therefore of very recent date.There is an allusion to the cards in Mackenzie's letter to Irwin of6 November 1877. It was written more than a decade before the publi-cation of the first Tarot manuals, which were all by French authors.lYou saw. . . Efliphas] L[6vi] much more recently than I didand perhaps you may be able to answer his question [i.e. theRev. 'W'. A. Ayton's question], viz. whether E.L. left any exactinstructions behind him for the working of the Tarot.I have a fashion of working it myself but I work it with theaid of astrology which is a different process from that pursuedby E.L. My general instructions are those of Aliettez [sr'c] whichare tinged with cartomancy-but for the latter I much preferan Italian process by which I have had marvellous results.He wrote to Dr'Westcott about the Tarot on 7 August 1879:With reference to the Real Tarot the gent\" at Bath has alreadybeen worrying me about it, and so have Brother Yarker andBrother the Revd.

The subject is terribly intiicate andI have not the same means of literary command r formeily possessed.'Like so many occultisrs, then and now, Mackenzie jabbled in'fringe' medicine. He wrote to Irwin on 4 February fi76:I wish I could learn that Mrs. Irwin's health was reestablishedon a firm basis. If I knew the particulars of the complaint perhapsI could suggest something as I cure everyone who .hoores toconsultme.

Even Lytton who knew so muchwas only a Neophyte and could not reply when I tested himyears ago. How then could Little maintain that he had them,)I knovr how many real Rosicrucians there are in these islands.Mackenzie was referring to Hargrave Jennings's eccentric bookThe Rosicrucians; Their Rites and Mysteries, r87o, which is nonsensefrom start to finish. Indeed, if Mackenzie supposed that Jennings knewanything about the 'Rosicrucians'he was capable of believing anything.In 1883 he was busy with the foundation of a new occult Ordercalled the Society of night. It was probably still-born. His letter toIrwin of z8 August suggests that its aims were vaguely alchemical.I am glad to welcome you as a Brother of the Society of Eight-this Society t\\eats work and not play. It is by no means poorLittle's foolish Rosic. Society. We arc practical and not visionaryand we are not degree-mongers. That nonsense is playedout. . . Stainton Moses and W'estcott are not to be admitted.Ayton is a widely different man-he is a profound occultist.Mackenzie also indicated that Frederick Holland had agreed tobecome a member. Holland gave Mathers his first instruction in theCabbala and had recently joined the Soc. Ros. The Rev. 'W. A. Aytonwas an elderly parson who dabbled with alchemy. He was one of theearliest members of the Golden Dawn, also one of the first to beadvanc€d to the Second Order.Lord Lytton (r8oz-71), who as Edward Bulwer-Lytton was theauthor of the famous 'Rosicrucian' novel Zanoni (1842), became theRosicrucian Society's Grand Patron in r87r. 'Westcott was quitewilling to accept that Lytton had an authentic Rosicrucian connection.In 1916 he wrote: 'In r85o the very old Rosicrucian Lodge at Frankfurt"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Rosicrucian Society of Englandam Main fell into abeyance; in this Lodge the first Lord Lytton wasreceived into the Adeptship and became imbued with the [Rosicrucian]ideas he displayed in his novel Zanoni,'This book was highly esteemedby nineteenth-century occultists who took it very seriously. Noinformation about an alleged Rosicrucian Lodge at Frankfurt am Mainis available.While Mackenzie greatly admired Frederick Hockley (r8o9*85),one of the best-known occultists of the Victorian era, their relationsbecame clouded. It is perhaps significant that Mackenzie's resignationfrom the Rosicrucian Society was announced at the same meeting(3o April 1871) atwhich Hockley.!vas elected a joining member of theMetropolitan College. He was already a member of p. C. Irwin'sBristol College. The two men later became reconciled and Mackenziewrote to Irwin on 16 April 1883: 'Yesterday came a letter from Bro.Hockley . . . I only wish I had a tithe of his occult knowledge.' Inanother letter written soon after Hockley's death on ro Novemberr88y, Mackenzie referred to him as: 'my dear old friend Bro. Hockley-the great spiritualist and astrologer'.William Carpenter $7g7-t874) was yet another member of dreRosicrucian Society who was closely identified with spiritualism.An article by him on'Occult Science'in the Rosr'crucian (lanuaryr87o) indicates a familiarity with the works of Eliphas L6vi, whosebooks, he wrote, 'were very little known even among the membersof our mystic and Secret Orders'.The Rev. Stainton Moses, one of the most famous British spiritualistmediums of that period, joined the Society on 17 December fi77.Robert Palmer Thomas, who was later to be a prominent member ofthe G.D., joined the same day.Two of the three noblemen who belonged to the Society duringits early days were deeply interested in spiritualism and its phenomena.The first was Lord Lytton, and the other was the Master of Lindsay,later the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres, who became a member inr87r. He rvas present at a number of spectacular seances with thefamous physical medium D. D. Home.Once again there is a rumour of a continental Rosicrucian initiation.There is an allusion to this in a letter written to F. L. Gardner by theRev. W. A. Ayton on zz January tgoz.My impression is . . . that he [i.e. Lord Lindsay] had beeninitiated on the Continent, as so many of our Nobility were atthe beginning of the last century, especially Scots noblemen.3233t;The Rosicrucian Society of EnglandI do not think that there was any opportunity for him to workpractically at any Occult Lodge in England. The late FrederickHockley was the only man doing anything in that line and hiswas only with a Magic Mirror and a Clairvoyante . . . If therehad been anything more than that going, Hockley would havebeen in it, and in the conversations I have had with him, hewould have told me what was going on in that way. He knewthe original of 'Glyndon' in Zatnni, who was living at Highgate,I think.The presence of these avowed spiritualists, i.e. Mackenzie, Irwin,Carpenter, Hockley and Stainton Moses in the Rosicrucian Society-and there were probably many more-does not mean that the Societywas a Masonic spiritualist association that called itself 'Rosicrucian'.It merely reflected the widespread interest in spiritualism that prevailedat that time. During R. W. Little's lifetime the Society did littlemore than achieve its founder's very modest aims. It was merely avery small Masonic fraternity that met quarterly, worked some briefrituals, listened to a lecture on this or that arcane topic and enjoyedan annual dinner.The Metropolitan College's annual Transactions indicate anexpansion of interests from r88; onwards. Regular lectures on theCabbala and highly-speculative papers on Masonic symbolism hadbecome a feature of its activities. The spiritualist element was nowprobably in a minoriry. Dr'W. R. Woodman, who had succeededR. W. Little as Supreme Magus when the latter died in 1878, was astudent of the Cabbala, and Vestcott and Mathers were both enthu-siastic Cabbalists.The Soc. Ros. was not and could not be organised as a schoolfor Cabbalistic and occult instruction. Westcott had something ofthis kind in mind when he founded the Hermetic Order of the GoldenDawn. Furthermore, he could expect to find a nucleus of prospectivemale members in the Rosicrucian Society. It was never his intentionto teach practical Magic. His knowledge of the subject can only havebeen theoretical and in any case he was a scholar rather than a Magician.Mathers, on the other hand, was capable of transforming the G.D. intoa Magical Order. He eventually did this, and with surprising success."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"3***The Three ChiefsA physician who had _become a Coroner (Westcott), a penuriouseccentric (Mathers) and a retired physician who could ,.\"d H.br.*and studied the literature of the cabbala (woodman) were the GoldenDawn's first three Chiefs.Although Westcot intended that they should be .co-equal', as heexpressed it, it was he who ran the G.D. during its early years. Itwas his hobby, his child and largely his creation. .I claim right andprecedence in the origin of the G.D.', he wrote to F. L. GarJner ony April r9rz, fifteen years after it had slipped from his grasp and aquarter of a century after he discovered the words .Golden Dawn, inthe Cypher Manuscript. Westcott was the Order's organising genius,its thaumaturgic Pooh-Bah, its 'Recorder of Minutes, superintindentof ;o: 6o Admissions, Corresponding Secretary ani Treasurer,,not to mention its chief Adept in Anglia in rg96. This multiplicityof ofrces and functions, which must have filled every leisure'houi,clearly gave him enoffnous pleasure.Mathers, whom Yeats described in Autobiographies as a man of'much learning but little scholarship', was too absorbed in his obscurestudies at the British Museum, where he read every available book onmagic, alchemy, symbolism, the religious mores of Ancient Egypt andheaven knows what else, to interfere overmuch when the C-5. wasbeing organised as a school for the study of what vestcott cailed'classical medieval occult science'. Later he was to seize hold of theOrder, offer it 'a scheme of Magic and practice'-the description was\\ffss1se11'5-4nd use it to express his own imperious temperament.By comparison with Mathers, who was the Magician personified,poor Dr 'Westcott was merely the Sorcerer's apprentice, eventuallyincapable of controlling the magical torrenr hi haa unwittinglyunleashed.-Dr Woodman played no part in all this. In Shadows of Life andThought A. E. Waite described him, briefly and somewhai \"or,-temptuously, as 'an obscure occultist', which may be a sufficient34The Three Chiefsassessment. Vestcott's senior by twenfy years and old enough to beMathers's father, the Supreme Magus of the Rosicrucian Sociery re-mained in the background and died shortly before Mathers transformd'Westcott's innocent little occult society into a real magical sodality.W'estcott's personality presents many contradictions. As a Coronerhe was accustomed to sifting evidence with the greatest possible ctue-he is said to have conducted more than ten thousand inquests duringa period of about thirty years up to rgro-and yet, as the V.H. FraterSapere Aude in the G.D. in the Outer, and as the G.H. Frater NonOmnis Moriar in the Second Order, he inhabited a world of fantasy.It is possible that he had unconscious longings to be either an actoror a priest, for nothing else will satisfactorily explain his love of'dressing up', e.E. in the robes of the Supreme Magus of the SocietasRosicruciana in Anglia or in the even more elaborate costume devisedfor a Chief Adept in the Second Order of the G.D. Again, there wasthe delight he obviously derived from active participation in ritualceremonies.It was the devious streak in W'estcott's character that perplexed me,particularly his role in the Soror S.D.A. business. It could have begunas an occultist's practical ioke, but perhaps there were moments whenhe believed in her.One day I happened to show the Warrant which Westcott wroteon 3 January r$g4 for Mathers's new Ahathoor Temple at Paris toMr Francis Hilliger, a British graphologist of great experience. MrHilliger inspected the document and, now intrigued, remarked that itwas strange that it had apparently been written by two differentpersons; furthermore that one ofthem took over from the other evenin the middle of a line. By now very familiar with Westcott's hand-writing after spending countless hours reading letters and otherdocuments written by him, I argued that Westcott had been responsiblefor every word in the Warrant. Mr Hilliger accepted this, although hewas still puzzled.I produced another document which, as far as I was concerned,could only have been written by Vestcott. This was a statement thathe had prepared in 1898 for his friend T. H. Pattinson to sign in thepresence of a witness. It concerned his past relationship with Mathers,which was then giving him some anxiery. I suspect that by now he wasafraid that Mathers would soon be talking about the fraudulentnature of the Soror S.D.A. letters, although this bomb was notexploded until early in r9oo.Mr Hilliger found it difficulg if not impossible, to accept that9t"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Three Chiefswhoever wrote the Ahathoor 'Warrant had also written the rgggstatement.

In any casg the two documentsseemed to exhibit completely different handwritings, and in hisopinion could not have been written by the same person.Rashly, perhaps, in view of the fact that tvtr Hilliger has been aprofessional graphologist for many years, and is also a specialist onsuspect documents, I was still inclined to suppose that W'estcott hadwritten the Statement. In fairness to Mr Hilliger I must mention thathis were 'first sight' impressions. As far as the Statement was concernedmy hypothesis was confirmed some weeks later when I spent a week-end at Mr Gerald Yorke's house and discovered a long Second Ordermanuscript ('The True System of Astrological Divination,) which waswritten in the same formal handwriting as the Statement. There wassufficient internal evidence to show that Westcott, and no one else,had written this piece. A few days later I sent Xerox prints of certainpages in the manuscript and further specimens of w'estcott's informalhandwriting to Mr Hilliger.

The lists of his publications, e.g. on suchsubjects as alcoholism and suicide, in successive editions of the MedicalDirectory do not hint at his private interests. Conversely, few of hismedical colleagues would have known about his contributions to theliterature of occultism. He was not without erudition in his particularfield.tJudging by his letters, W'estcott v/as a gentle, friendly man. Theladies in the G.D. v/ere rather fond of their 'sapere Aude', while themale members, some of whom knew him as Supreme Magus of theSoc. Ros. after Dr 'W'oodman's death in r89r, respected him.

As Aleister Crowley scribbledin his magical diary at the time: 'If S.R. [Mathers] is not 7o : 4o[because Soror S.D.A.'s 'authority' was a fiction] there is no SecondOrder and no Golden Dawn and no nuffin.'2Mathers would be a heaven-sent subject for a full-scale biographyif there were sufficient material.

At that time he was more in sympathy with AnnaKingsford's ideals of esoteric Christianity and of the advancementof woman.

Thus Frederick Rolfe, who called himselfBaron Corvo, and Samuel Liddell Mathers, who became Comte deGlenstrae and sometimes Comte MacGregor, were birds of a pseudo-aristocratic feather. Aleister Crowley was another of the magicalfraternity who used bogus titles.

The G.D. was not a 'veryancient universal Rosicrucian society' but had been founded only afew months before. Nor could Westcott have learned anything aboutthe G.D. from W'oodford because he himself was its founder. Wood-ford had not refused to join the Soc. Ros. because it was esotericallyinferior to the G.D. He had been a candidate for admission to theSoc. Ros. in April 1885, long before the G.D. was projected, butdid not go any further in the matter. Finally, he was never a memberof the G.D. and died on z3 December 1887, three months before thefirst initiates were recruited.The following communication, which was published in Notes andQueries on 8 December 1888 above the name of Gustav Mommsen,might have been 'planted' there by Westcott.A Socmry or KessArrsrs.-Johann F.

The greatest privacy ismaintained, and some knowledge of Hebrew is essential, but the46The Golden Dawn in the Outer t888-5tiwhole course of study and experiment is so abstruse and complexthat membership is very limited as to number, and theproceedings have no public interest. Its true name is only toldto initiates, and the few outsiders who have heard of its existenceonly know of the society as 'The Hermetic Students of the G.D.'.once again a spurious antiquity was attributed to the order.Next, since Westcott clearly knew all about the 'Hermetic Students'and provided his own address, any reader of Notes and Queries whowas sufficiently curious had only to write to him. Drafts of two lettersthat could then be sent to prospective members are in the PrivateCollection.Westcott identified himself a 'Praemonstrator of the Kabbalah tothe Isis-Urania Temple of the G.D.' in the r889-9o issue of theSoc; Ros. Transactions (p. tl). This publication, which had a smallcirculation and was published privately, would not have been seen bymembers of the general public.An intriguing announcement of the existence of an Order callingitself 'The Hermetic Students of the G.D. in the Outer' appeared inthe June 1889 issue of Madame Blavatsky's Theosophical periodicalLucifer. It was carefully stage-managed and was printed in connectionwith the denunciation of an obscure group of 'occultists' at Keighley,Yorkshire. A correspondent who signed him- or herself as 'One whohas been duped' had sent a long letter of complaint about the activitiesof the Keighley 'Ros Crux Fratres'. The communication was shownto Mathers, who was temporarily the Secretary of the MetropolitanCollege of the Soc. Ros., perhaps in order to learn what he had to sayabout the activities of a rival 'Rosicrucian' group. His 'official state-ment'was published in the same number. The person who had beenduped alleged that the Keighley Fratres practised Black Magic andsacrificed kids.They are also untiring in telling how they can raise Elementals,and they are on the point of forming a circle for obtaininginformation of a forbidden kind.

My assumption isthat Mathers, with W'estcott's approval, was merely contriving a littlesuitably mysterious publicity for the G.D.The last minute availability (see Preface) of the parchment rollcontaining details of the London Isis-Urania Temple's membershipbetween March 1888 and January r9ro, also the more detailed list ofall the G.D. members between March 1888 and September 1897has provided much information that was hitherto missing.

Therehad also been seven deaths, including that of 'No. 4 Sprengel'. Since'Westcott must have announced her decease it was necessary toinclude her name in the list.

By the end of"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Tlu Golden Dayn in the Outer t898-g6the year at least a dozen Soc. Ros. members had joined. Mrs Alex-andrina Mackenzie ('Cryptonyma'), K. R. H. Mackenzie's widow,was one of the earliest initiates and was probably invited to join as acompliment to her husband's memory. She never progressed beyondthe Neophyte grade and resigned in 1896. Three of the first recruitswere a Dane (J. Hermann Simonsen), an Englishman resident inSwiuerland and yet another with an address at Jerusalem. None ofthem was in the Order for very long.Apart from the Rev. W. A. Ayton, who joined rogether with hiswife Anne in July 1888, during the Order's early days there wasanother clergyman in the person of the Rev. Dr T. W. Lemon, ofPlymouth, who was also in the Soc. Ros.Perhaps the most surprising discovery of all was the name ofMrs Constance Mary W'ilde, the wife of Oscar Wilde, who joined in1888 and had reached the senior Philosophus grade by Novemberr889. Her entry includes the statement'In abeyance with the sympathyof the Chiefs'. It is possible that her worldly husband had learnedabout her occult interests and had raised objections.Most of the members had convenrional middle-class backgroundsbut there were a few with high social pretensions. However, theclaim to a title did not guarantee the Chiefs' approval. The Countessde Br6mont, who joined in November 1888, was soon told to resign.The Baroness de Pallandt left in April fi93 after rwo years' member-ship and Westcott wrote 'no good' against her name in the register.The Hon. Mrs Ivor Herbert was in the G.D. for a year (r889-9o)and might have remained longer had she not gone to Canada withher husband. The Hon. Miss Gabrielle Borthwick ('Sine Metu')joined the Isis-Urania Temple in July r89r and eventually reachedthe Second Order in r897.There were fwo foreign noblemen in the persons of Count FranzOtto Bubna (initiated December 1889) and Baron Alphonse Walleen,a Dane who joined Isis-Urania in June r89o and soon resigned. InAugust 1893 he was 'excluded from re-admission by ballot'. Duringthe early rgoos he had a finger in Rudolph Steiner's obscure pseudo-Masonic activities.l Possibly the most exotic initiate was the NawabMahomet Eusouf, who joined Isis-Urania in March r89o and resignedsix months later.Mr William Crookes, a Fellow of the Royal Society-he wasknighted in r897-abeady a famous scientist and prominent memberof the Society for Psychical Research, took the Neophyte grade inr See Francis King, Ritual Magic in England: z 887 to the Present Day, r97o, pp, ror4.toThe Goldcn Dawn in the Outer t888-stCIsis-Urania in June r89o and had allowed his connection with theG.D. to lapse by September.The year r89o was particularly memorable in the G.D.'s annalssince it witnessed the admission of three people who were later tobe particularly prominent members of Isis-Urania. They were MissAnnie Horniman ('Fortiter et Recte', January), William Butler Yeats('Demon Est Deus Inversus', March) and Mrs Florence Farr Emery('sapientia Sapienti Dono Data', July), known to a wider public asthe actress Florence Farr. All of them introduced friends to the G.D.Indeed, it is tolerably sure that Yeats was Florence Farr's sponsor.Others he brought to the Order included the beautiful Maud Gonne('Per Ignem Ad Lucem' November r89r), whom for years on end hevainly hoped to marry. She, howeverr'was too dedicated to tte causeof lreland's freedom to contemplate marriage to him or anyone else atthat time. George Pollexfen ('Festina Lente'), his uncle, joined inDecember 1893. There was, too, his father's and his own close friendDr John Todhunter ('Aktis Heliou', February r89z). Formerly aphysician but now a minor poet he had emigrated from Dublin toLondon in 1888 and helped Yeats senior to find a house close to hisown at Bedford Park in the quiet West London suburb of Chiswick.The first of the fourteen medical men, apart from Westcott and'Woodman, who were in the G.D. before rgoo were Dr T. W. Coffin,a London physician who was also in the Soc. Ros., Dr George Dicksonwho practised at Edinburgh, and Dr Bogdan Jastrzebski Edwards ofBradford.Dr Robert Masters Theobald ('Ecce In Penetralibus') was initiatedin r893. He originally intended to become a Nonconformist ministerbut was expelled from a theological college because he refused tobelieve in the verbal inspiration of the Bible. Later he was in badodour with the medical Establishment because of his advocacy of the'Electro-homoeopathic' theories of an Italian quack called CountCaesar Mattei. He also believed that Bacon wrote the works ofShakespeare. His consulting rooms were at 5 Grosvenor Street,Mayfair. His fellow homoeopath Dr Berridge rnay have introducedhim to the Order.

By r89y he was oneof the Order's most active members. The extraordinary magicalcareer of Dr Robert William Felkin, who joined the Amen-Ra Templeat Edinburgh on ro March 1894, is described at some length later inthis book.Apart from W. B. Yeats the Order harboured few writers of anydistinction during its early period. Mrs Violet Tweedale joined theIsis-Urania Temple in September r889, before she began to publisha long series of second-rate novels. J. H. Fitzgerald Molloy, the authorof Court Life Aelow Stairs, in four volumes, r88z-3, and many otherbooks of a popular nature including A Modern Magician: A Romance,r 887, became a member of Isis-Urania in r 893 and resigned two yearslater. Neither Arthur Machen ('Avallaunius', I.-U. zr November1899) nor Algernon Blackwood ('Umbram Fugat Veritas', I.-lJ.,3o October rgoo) was ever very prominent in the G.D. and bothjoined when the Order's most interesting period belonged to the past.'Weston-super-Mare, a quiet seaside resort in Somerset, might appearto be an unexpected place for a G.D. Temple in 1888, but it was thehome of Benjamin Cox, the Town Accountant or Borough Treasurer,who was an enthusiastic occultist and member of the Bristol Collegeof the Rosicrucian Society. On z1 N{arch 1888 he wrote to his friendF. G. Irwin, yet another local 'Rosicrucian' occultist, and announced.W'estcott's impending visit on G.D. business:I hope Br. Westcott may have something interesting to impartother than what you already know, yet I am doubtful of hisability to teach me much occult knowledge, for up to the presenttime I have not found any one who has taught real practicalknowledge of the sublime mystery of the Great AIO . . .

'Westcott I will join the G.D. circle as heparticularly wishes me to do so, and he has written to say that hewill see me at W'.S.Mare on Tuesday evg. next.Cox's next letter to Irwin, dated zo April r888, showed rather moreinterest in W'estcott's plans.I told'Westcott that I could get five or six [Masonic] brethrento become members of the G.D.

I can tell you more about the Order, should youcare to know.Hence Westcott's 'Historic Lecture for Neophytes', with all itsfanciful information, was already being circulated by March 1888.As for the local G.D recruits: Dr Edward Smith Nunn was theheadmaster of a local school called 'The College'; he died beforeSeptember r893. James Partridge Capell was probably a solicitor andWilliam Millard was the landlord of the Three Queens Hotel.Cox's next letter to Irwin (r3 September 1888) reveals the writer'sgreat enthusiasm for the G.D. and the fact that he had attained the3o : 8o grade. He was waiting to learn that his examination papersfor the 4o : 7o grade were satisfactory. He passed the test because theprinted summons for the G.D.'s Equinox Ceremony, which was tobe held at the Three Queens Hotel on z7 September, was issued by'Crux Dat Salutem, 4o : 7o, Hierophant for Somerset'.A name for the Temple at W'eston-super-Mare had still not beenchosen by the end of November 1888. Cox wrote to Westcott aboutthis on 3o November. He was hoping to be promoted to the io : 6ograde and may have learned that T. H. Pattinson at Bradford wasalready an Adeptus Minor.You suggest in your letter of z6th inst. that the name of No. 4Temple should be either Osiris, Hermes, Minerva, Phoenix,Serapis or Thoth.

Whichever you think best.It was decided to call the Weston-super-Mare Temple'Osiris No. 4'.The last surviving letter from Cox to Westcott is dated 17 June 1889.He was still full of fervour for the G.D. and was busy composing aritual for the 7\" :4o grade. He wrote: 'I think I have found suficientmatter for the 7o : 4o grade, viz. the situation of the Temple and itsprinciple [src] use. Yet it has been a very tough subject.' Since neitherW'estcott nor Mathers aspired to write ? 7o :4o ritual it is apparentthat Cox, who was already identified with other pseudo-Masonicrites, such as the Sat B'hai and the Rite of Swedenborg had been usinghis imagination.With only a handful of original members and a couple of laterinitiations Osiris No. 4 cannot have been a very active Temple.Benjamin Cox died in December r89; and my assumption is that theG.D. soon came to an end at'Weston-super-Mare.Bradford was a more rewarding recruiting cenffe than Weston-super-Mare because the Rosicrucian Society's York College included afair number of local Freemasons who were prepared to interestthemselves in Westcott's G.D. project. Thomas Henry Pattinson,who was 8\" honoris causa in the Soc. Ros. and soon to be Frater VotaVita Mea in the G.D., was on friendly terms urith both Westcott andMathers. He was one of the first half dozen to be initiated in March1888. By the end of the year the Horus Temple No. ; at Bradford hadabout a dozen members. The Temple was formally consecrated byMathers at a ceremony held at the Alexandra Hotel on 9 October.Carlo Faro, its landlord, ioined the Order but resigned when he wasdeclared a bankrupt in July 1893.By the summer of r 89r the Horus Temple had about thirry membersand was G.D.'s most important provincial outpost until the Amen-RaTemple at Edinburgh rapidly increased its membership in r89y-6.Apart from the Rosicrucian Society the Theosophical Society wasan important reservoir from which many of the eady G.D. members,its women supporters in particular, were drawn. Since the G.D. wasalways very small by comparison with the T.S. the number of defec-tions would have been so insignificant as to be hardly noticeable.However, it is evident that Madame Blavatsky soon had misgivingst4The Golden Dayn in the Outer t888-96about Westcott's little secret society, which was outside her sphere ofinfluence and likely to remain so. Hence it may not have been al-together coincidental that she founded the so-called Esoteric Sectionof the Theosophical Society, perhaps as a counter atraction, on 9October 1888. Membership of the E.S. was restricted to a few favouredindividuals who were in her Blavatsky Lodge or otherwise close to her.It happened that the Rev. W. A. Ayton was nor only a member ofthe G.D. but also of the Esoteric Section. Furrhermore, he wasacquainted with l. H. Pattinson and the latter's friends in the Bradforddistrict. Some years previously he had been the victim of certainswindlers who had been running a bogus Hermetic Brotherhood ofLuxor, which seems to have been indigenous to the Bradford andLeeds area. Pattinson made him a joining (honorary) member of theHorus Temple and this explains why Ayton referred to his 'Yorkshirechelas'in the letter printed below.It was Ayton, then, who put the cat among the occult pigeons bytelling Madame Blavatsky about his membership of the G.D. Hementioned the repercussions in a letter to F. L. Gardner (April rS89).Gardnerwas a keen Theosophist and still not heeding Ayton'ssuggestion that he should join the G.D. Ayton had a budget of newsfor his friend.A short time ago an ukase was issued from the headquarters ofthe T.S., that members of the Esoreric Section should not belongto any other Occult Order. I at once wrote to say that Ibelonged to the Rosicrucian Society [i.e. the G.DJ, but I wasordered to give it up, and I felt bound to do so at once withouthesitation, and wrote to some of my Yorkshke clzelas, whobelonged to it and the T.S., to do the same. They were dismayed,and two of them went, as a deputation, to H.P.B. to remonstrateagainst this decision. H.P.B. then began to see that she had madea mistake and she wrote to me for advice, which I gave, and theconsequence was, she withdrew this ukase as regards thisRosicrucian Society. The result was that Dr'Wynn 'Westcott,the head of this Rosicrucian Society, joined the Esoteric Sectionof the T.S. and with him some 20 others, and about 14 fromYorkshire. All is well that ends well.rr Annie Besant and G. R. S. Mead, as ioint secretaries of the Esoteric Section, wrote toWestcott on 19 August r89o to inform him that Madame Blavatsky was willing toadmit him to the E.S.'s'Inner Group'as a probationer.

They were not 'MagicalRituals' in the vulgar sense of the word, meaning that there was noelement of 'coniuration', no tampering with 'dangerous forces', no'sex magic'-in fact there was nothing that could not be safely experi-enced by any respectable middle-class lady who happened to join theG.D. during the non-permissive r89os.Dr Regardie describes their cenral theme as follows:If one idea more than any other is persistently stressed from thebeginning that idea is the word Light. From the candidate'sThe Golden Dayn in the Outer 888-gGfirst reception in the Hall of the Neophytes when the Hierophantadjures him with these words: 'Child of Eardr, long hast thoudwelt in darkness. Quit the night and seek the day', to thetransfiguration in the [Second Order] Vault ceremony, thewhole system has as its objective the bringing down of the Light.For it is by that Light that the golden banner of the inner lifemay be exalted; it is in Light where lies healing and the power ofgrowth.As far as the Outer Order rituals are concemed there is only onepassage which might give cause for surprise; it might be described asat least blood-curdling. It will be found in the Neophyte's oath orundertaking.All these points I generally and severally upon this sacredand sublime symbol swear to observe without evasion . . .under the awful penalty of voluntarily submitting myself to adeadly and hostile Current of \\trill set in motion by the Chiefsof the Order by which I should fall slain or paralysed withoutvisible weapon, as if blasted by the Lightning Flash.Of the five Outer Order rituals the one for the Neophyte gradeseems to be the most effective. I have the impression that a candidatewho experienced it might actually have a sensation of iniriation',meaning into a world of hidden mysteries. It could be argued that asprose compositions these texts are often flatulent. However, at anygiven time there is never more than a handful of men capable ofwriting rituals of this kind and in his day and age Mathers was one ofthem. It is obvious that he drew heavily upon his Masonic experiencesand memories, but this was perhaps inevitable, for where else wouldhe have found ideas relating to non-liturgical 'ritual structure'.Possibly the only people who have ever taken the trouble to readthese rituals are occultists and those who have a special interest in'W. B. Yeats. However, in their strange way these texts belong to theminor literature of the r89os, in the same way that the G.D. has itsown modest place in the social history of the period.Members of the G.D. in the Outer were required to study thefollowing subiects and to pass examinations in order to advancethrough the successive grades from Neophyte to Philosophus:elemental occult symbolism (i.e. alchemical and astrological), theHebrew alphabet, the Cabbalistic Tree of tife with its ten Sephirothand twenty-two Paths, the Divine Names attributed to the Sephiroth,t8t9"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The Golden Dayn in the Outer d8g_gt6the attributions of the twenty-tq/o Tarot Trumps (i.e. their supposedcorrespondences with the twenty-two paths), G.o*\"n\"y and^so orr.The material is outlined in detail in the first volume of Dr Regardie'sThe Golden Dawn.The only instruction that could conceivably be called 'magical'was the practice of a simple 'pentagram Rituai with the cabbiisticcross'.

This is not a matter for surprise. They had pledgedthemselves to secrecy and in later years when the Golden Dawn ofthe r89os was merely a memory, perhaps there did not seem verymuch to say.r Again, most of these people were very obscure persons,whose names are only known because of the chance survival of theirletters and references to them in G.D. documents. There were excep-tions such as W. B. Yeats and Annie Horniman, but their subsequentfame lay ahead of them.A few of the more important members of the cast who appearedon the stage of the 'magical theatre' devised for them by the GreatlyHonoured Fratres Non Omnis Moriar and Deo Duce Comite Ferroare now introduced.The Rev. W. A. Ayton, whom Kenneth Mackenzie admired as a'profound occultist', has already been mentioned. V'. B. Yeats de-scribed him as 'an old white-haired clergyman, the most panic-strickenperson I have ever known'. Mathers had presented him to Yeats withthe words: 'He unites us to the great adepts of the past'.2 Adept ornot, he was both gentle and gullible, to which his involvement withthe Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor and other eccentric 'Masonic'promotions bear witness.'William Alexander Ayton was born in London on z8 April 1816and was educated at Charterhouse School and Trinity Hall, Cambridge.After holding a number of rural ecclesiastical appointments he'becameVicar of Chacombe, a small village near Banbury, in fi73.He and his wife joined the G.D. in July r888.

No. ; in the membership roll, Soror VestigiaNulla Retrorsum was the senior initiate after the three Chiefs and'Friiulein Sprengel'. At the beginning of a memorandum written on r4July 1898, which described her earlier relationship with Mathers andVestigia, Annie Horniman recalled:Early in October r88z at the Slade School, University College,Gower Street, I made the acquaintance of Mina Bergson. In thebeginning of 1888 she introduced Mr. Mathers to me as aninteresting man whom she did not want to marry . . . Theybecame engaged . . . In about June r89o they were married andlived at Stent Lodge, Forest Hill.Ayton mentioned the marriage in a letter to F. L. Gardner (zrJune r89o): '\\il'e have been busy having Miss Bergson here for thetime required by Law for the Publication of Banns of Marriage, whichended in Mr. MacGregor Mathers coming down last Monday andcarrying her off.'There can be no doubt of Vestigia's devotion to her eccentrichusband. Years later Westcott remarked in a letter to F. L. Gardner(25 October r9z4): 'Mrs. Mathers was obsessed by Samuel Liddell14-.' Jhsls may be some truth in this statement.By t892, apart from the Chiefs, two men and two women hadbecome particularly prominent and active in the Order. In order ofseniority they were Dr Edward Berridge, Miss Annie Horniman,Mrs Florence Emery, who was known to the general public as theactress Florence Farrrr 3t6 Percy Bullock. In June 1894 they wereholding important positions in the Isis-Urania Temple. Since Matherswas perrnanently absent in Paris and Westcott was busy running theSecond Order, the Temple was now being governed by membersother than its founders.Dr Berridge was described by Aleister Crowley, who was seldoman unprejudiced witness, as 'an ill-reputed doctor on the borders ofr Since she is best known by her maiden name, in this book she is almost invariablyreferred to as Florence Farr.Sotne fnitiatesquackery'.r He studied medicine at St Bartholomew,s Hospital andqualified in fi67.

The status of this degree is uncertain.It is possible, however, that Berridge was in the U.S.A. during theearly r87os and may well have encountered Thomas Lake Harriq theprotagonist of a sexual-pneumatic philosophy apparently so obscurethat the authors of the standard biography n.,n.r -\"nug\"d to explainits exact naflre.2 Berridge's evident sympathy for Harris und hi,teachings was mistrusted by Annie Horniman.

Her relationship with her father was unsatisfactory andI have the impression, but no more, that she had been involved inan unhappy love affair. In any event she never married.Annie Elizabeth Frederika Horniman was born on 3 october 186o.She became a pupil at the Slade School and remained there until1886. She was the daughter of Frederick Horniman (r83;-19o6), thehead of a famous tea importing and packing firm. She persuaded herfather to employ the indigent Mathers in his private museum and thusmade it possible for him to marry Mina Bergson.St John Ervine, the theatrical critic who knew Annie Hornimanwell in later years, described her character in his Introduction toRex Pogson's Miss Horniman and tln Gaietjr Theatre, Manchester,r9yz. Neither he, nor Mr Pogson, nor the author of her article in theDictionary of National Biographyrwerc aware of her former connectionwith the G.D., although the last two knew of her continuing pre-occupation with astrology. St John Irvine wrote:She was essentially a rebellious woman . . . She always rebelledagainst unreasonable authority, but never, be it particularlynoted, against authority that had reason. She rebelled againstthe restrictions that her parents sought to impose upon her, andshe rebelled even more heartily against those imposed upon hersex by society.Apart from her emotional troubles it was consistent with herrebellious temperament that this member of a rich Quaker (butlatterly Church of England) family should have joined a societylike the G.D.

The Bayreuth producrions of parsifal and the'Ring' cycle were almost 'ritual' events, and there must have beenechoes of these experiences in one part of her G.D. work.Florence Farr (b. I luly 186o), who was to be associated withAnnie Horniman's first professional theatrical venfilre in 1894, ioinedthe Order in July r89o. It is probable that she was introduced to theG.D. by W. B. Yeats, who was himself a very recent member. AtBedford Park, in the quiet west London suburb of Chiswick, there wasa red-brick clubhouse with a small theatre and yeats persuaded hisfriend Dr John Todhunter, who was ro join the Order in 1892, towrite a pastoral play for presentation there. His A Sicilian ldylt wasstaged at this theatre with Florence Farr in the leading female role on; May r89o, almost exactly two months after Yeats became a memberof the G.D.According to Joseph Hone, Yeats's biographer:Yeats knew her already, and, until he met Maud Gonne, hadbeen accounted in love with her by his sisters. After theperformance in A Sicilian ldyllhe thought of her as acollaborator in the theatre, by reason ofher unfashionable art,to the plays he would one day write. They formed an enduringfriendship in which were at times tender passages, and alwayson his side some exasperation because she seemed to set a highervalue on her wit and intellectualiry dran on her incomparablesense of rhythm and her musical voice.lG.

She hadthree great gifts, a tranquil beauty like that of Demeter's imagenear the British Museum Reading-Room door, and anincomparable sense of rhythm and a beautiful voice . . . Shewould dress without care or calculation as if to hide her beautyand seemed contemptuous of its power.

'Wit andparadox alike sought to pull down whatever had tradition orpassion and she was soon to spend her days in the BritishMuseum Reading-Room and become erudite in manyheterogeneous studies, moved by an insatiable, destroying'curiosity . . . Her sitting-room at the Brook Green lodging-house [rz3 Dalling Road] was soon a reflection of her mind, thewalls covered with musical instruments, pieces of Orientaldrapery, and Egyptian gods and goddesses painted by herself atthe British Museum (p. t+p).If Annie Horniman had a rebellious temperament so, too, didFlorence Farr. Shaw recalled that 'she was in violent reaction againstVictorian morals, especially sexual and domestic morals'.3r Florence Farr left her letters from Shaw and Yeats to Clifford Bax.

Shaw's letters are more easily accessible in Bernard Shaw, Collected Lettersed. Dan Laurence, 1965.z Florence Farr had been married to the actor Edward Emery but they had parted. Herliaison with Shaw lasted for several years (r89r-y or perhaps later).

Yeats's preoccupation withoccultism that I need not cover any of the ground already discussed byothers, or again describe the path that led him to the G.D. via MadameBlavatsky and the Esoteric Section of the Theosophical Society.tIn Autobiographies Yeats stated that his G.D. initiation took placein May or June 1887 'in a Charlotte Street studio'. According to MissVirginia Moore, who had access to Yeats's papers for her bookThe Unicorn, she found a note in his handwriting to the effect that itwas on Friday 7 March r89o at 64o p.m. at Fitzroy Street.2 AnnieHorniman has identified Fiuroy Street as the location of MinaMathers's studio.Yeats's connection with the G.D. and the Stella Matutina, oneof its successor Orders, continued until the early r9zos. He was neververy prominent in the Golden Dawn during the first decade of hismembership, although he briefly took command in rgoo-r when therev/as a maior crisis of confidence in Mathers and the Order was indanger of foundering.Those who have concerned themselves with every aspect of Yeats'slife and work are unanimous in their opinion that his G.D. 'experience'was of fundamental importance for his creative development. Heexpressed the essence of his debt to Mathers when he wrote in Auto-biographies:'. . . it was through him mainly that I began studies andexperiences, that were to convince me that images well up before themind's eye from a deeper source than conscious or subconsciousmemory'.Again, there is an illuminating allusion to his attitude to Magic in aletter written to John O'Leary, the veteran Irish nationalist, in Julyr892. Furthermore, he wrote this about six months before his SecondOrder initiation in January r8g1' and it was in the Second Order thathe and others learned more about'Magic' than they would have everthought possible.Now as to Magic.

This would have been Mathers's home. Hementioned that he easily arranged the introduction of his wife 'withinthe secret circle, but she attended one Meeting only, and at that vrastempted to hold up the whole galanty-show, in order to win herretreat'. She was initiated on z December l89t but resigned in March1892. Waite, however, remained in the G.D. for a while.rIt is difficult to recall clearly at this distance of time; but mybelief is that I stood on the threshold of the Second order,being that of an inner group, when I began to hear things which,in my several positions at the moment, told me that I should bewell out of the whole concern. It was not on the score ofmorality, seeing that there were Fratres et Sororesl for on thisground it is just to say that no breath or scandal ever arose inthe G .'. D .'. during all that period.

Iretired or rather demitted without explanation . . .I assume that the 'things which had an equivocal legal aspect'referred to the practice of Ritual Magrc, which began in the SecondOrder in 1892. It is possible, however, that Waite did not merely'demit' but applied for membership of the Second Order and was notaccepted. The list of those who had left the G.D. before z September1893 includes the names of six persons who were 'in abeyance'.Mrs Oscar Wilde was one of them. Among the others there was Waite,who was then 'pending astral judgment re admission to t : 6',meaning the Second Order. Miss Emily Bates ('Pro Veritate') wasalso'pending astral examination for 5 : 6'. Count Franz Otto Bubnawas in a less complicated position since his state of abeyance wasmerely 'pending wife's decision'. He had reached the 4o : 7\" gradein November r89o and had been inactive since March 1892. TheCountess presumably disliked his esoteric activities and he did notreturn to the Order.'Waite's account of his reappearance in the G.D. milieu in Shadowsof Ltf, and Thought is unreliable, probably because of a faulty memoryin his old age. He wrote that he was persuaded to re-join by RobertPalmer Thomas.He was a Railway official of one kind or another and lived ina moderate to small house at Horbury Crescent, Notting HillGate. It was essential, in his opinion, to escape from 'utterBohemianism', and this was ensured by dressing for dinner on allor most occasions. He aimed at Culture, and we drank whiteCapri at his table. His main interest was in tJrings occult, and hetold me at an early stage that he was looking for the RosyCross. So far, however, his knowledge of Secret Societies, realor alleged, outside Masonry, seemed confined to the hand thathe had had some years previously over the establishment ofPortman's Order of Light . . .tIt was at one of these dinner parties, his tongue no doubt loosenedby white Capri, that W-aite told Palmer Thomas a little about theG.D., from which he had already resigned. Then, according to'Waite's memoirs, sometime later Palmer Thomas sent him an urgentmessage asking him to call.

Frater Sacramentum Regis atlast reached the Second Order on 3 March 1899.It would never have occurred to anyone in the G.D. milieu atthat time that he, of all people, would a little later achieve a positionof prominence in what he liked to call 'secret circles'.r lbid., p, rz6.74716x**Tlze Second OrderOrdo Rosae Rutreae et Aureae CrucisFrom r89z the 'history' of the G.D. is almost exclusively that of theSecond Order, or R.R. et. A.C. The G.D. in the Outer continued asin the past, but now also prepared selected candidates for advancementto the Second Order 'by invitation'. The latter was not only an evenmore secret affair than the G.D. in the Outer, but had a separateexistence and its own premises. Hence its ceremonies .were not con-ducted at Mark Masons' Hall.The Second Order, in the form that it assumed in 1892, wasMathers's creation. He was its sole Chief. W'estcott was simply ChiefAdept in Anglia. He never claimed any responsibility for the organisa-tion of the R.R. et A.C. In a letter to F. L. Gardner (y April rgrz)he wrote:. . .

Theearliest known date for a Flying Roll is ro November 1892. Thirty-four such docu-ments were in circulation by the end of 1894. lvlr Francis King published all or most ofthemin r97z as Astral Projecthn, Ritual Magic and Ahhemy S, L.

He found it necessary to have a bridgebetween the G.D. in the Outer and the R.R. et A.C. and for this hecreated an unnumbered Portal grade, for which he wrote a specialritual. The next stage was initiation in the R.R. et A.C. and for thisthere was another new ritual. Mathers's composition for the 5o : 6ois by far the most interesting of all the G.D. ceremonies. It will befound in the second volume of Dr Regardie's The Golden Dawn.By c. 1894 the 5o : 6'Adeptus Minor grade in the Second Orderwas divided into two sub-grades. Upon admission the new memberbecame a Zelator Adeptus minor, abbreviated Z.A.M. Subject topassing eight examinations-F. L. Gardner needed about rwentymonths to complete the course during r895-7-he or she could bepromoted to the senior grade of Theoricus Adeptus Minor (Th.a.U.;.tThe syllabus was formidable and no similar corpus of Magical instruc-tion had ever been available in the past. An even more advancedcurriculum for a projected 5o:6o Practicus Adeptus Minor gradewas devised in c. fig6-7-its details will be found in Appendix II-but the Second Order's examination system was beginning to founderby fi97 and it is unlikely that anyone ever rook this veritable'DiplomaCourse'.The five officers of the Temple who worked the Portal ceremonywere impressively attired. The Chief Adept, for example, wore awhite cassock, the red cloak of a Hierophant, a yellow and whiteNemyss (Egyptian head-dress) and yellow shoes. A Rose Crosslamen or symbol was attached to a yellow collar. He bore a sceptredecorated with the five elemental colours (black, blue, red, yellow andr 'With the exception of Mrs Mathers, to whom her husband awarded the 6' : t\"Adeptus Major grade, no one was advanced beyond to : 6o Theoricus Adeptus Minor."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"The Second Orderwhite) surmounted by a pentagram. He was also furnished with a whitelamp, a brazier and a candle.one of the chief features of this ritual was 'Paroketh', the Veil ofthe Temple, a curtain behind which the Chief Adept remained con-cealed for most of the time. At intervals, however, his hand could beseen when, parting the curtain slightly, he showed the white lampor the candle or 'made Pentagram sign with torch'.The following extract from the preliminary proceedings, describedas 'The Ritual of the Cross and the Four Elements', shows Mathers'sability to devise complicated 'stage directions'.Hegemon returns to place. znd and 3rd Adepts bar the way insouth-west.

The candidate now learned that he or she was a'Lord (or Lady) of the Paths of the Portal of the Vault of the Adepts',but was told nothing about the Vault. He was also shown a symbol ofthe Red Rose and Cross of Gold but its significance was not explained.He was informed, too, that he might in due course be'admitted to thefellowship of that other order to which the Golden Dawn is one ofthe Veils', but 'of this matter you have no right to speak to any belowyour degree'.78The Second OrderThe Christian Rosenkreuz legend, as adapted by Mathers, providedthe climax or denouement for the new !o:6o initiation ritual.The following summary of the legend is based upon a modern Germantext of the Fama Fraternitatis, first published at Cassel in fir4.tTHE CHRISTIAN ROSENKREUZ LEGENDChristian Rosenkreuz, the son of noble but poor parents, wasplaced in a monastery at the age of five and there learned someGreek and Latin. When he was still a youth a certain BrotherP.A.L. took him on a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre. BrotherP.A.L. died in Cyprus. The lad continued the journey alone andarrived at Damascus, where his medical skill was highly esteemed.There he learned of the Wise Men at Damcar in Arabia and madehis way there. By this time he was sixteen years old. He wasgiven a warm welcome, not as a stranger, but as if he had beenlong expected. They already knew his name and much to hissurprise told him of secret things relating to his old monastery.He learned Arabic and was able to translate the Liber M intoLatin. He also greatly increased his knowledge of the naturalsciences and mathematics.After three years at Damcar he left and went to Egypt, but didnot remain there for long. His friends at Damcar had told himabout Fez, whither he now iourneyed. At Fez, once again, helearned much secret knowledge. Two years later he left for Spainwhere he discoursed with scholars and learned men but did notarouse their interest. I(At this point in the narrative the author of the Famamentioned that while Paracelsus was not a member of 'ourfraterniry' he had nevertheless assiduously read the Liber M.)Brother C.R. then returned to Germany where he built himselfa light and airy home and wrote an account of his travels andphilosophy. He studied mathematics and constructed 'manybeautiful instruments.'Three Brothers from his old monastery joined him as disciplesand helpers: Brothers G.V., I.A. and I.O.

They wrote on Magic, also the first part of the Liber M.The work, however, was onerous and its progress wasinterrupted by the many sick people who came for medicaltreatment. Now, since their new building, called the 'sanctusSpiritus', was ready, they decided to accept a few others into theirFraterniry. The new members were Brother R.C., a nephew ofthe Order's founder, Brother B., an accomplished painter,Brothers G.G. and P.D., who worked as secretarial assistants,and finally Brother I.A. So there were eight in all; unmarriedand pledged to chastiry. Together they wrote a library of bookson every conceivable subject. One particular work, known asthe Axiomata, was considered to be of the greatest imPortance.Their tasks completed the Brethren went their various ways,leaving Brothers B. and P.D. with Father Rosenkreuz. Beforethey departed a number of rules were formulated: r. None ofthe Brethren was to exercise any profession but that of medicineand they were forbidden to accept payment for their skill;z. no distinctive dress was to be worn, instead they were tofollow the custom of the country in which they were residing;3. there was to be an annual gathering of the Fraternity at the'sanctus Spiritus' on the Day of C.; 4' each Brother was to beon the look-out for a person worthy to succeed him when hedied; 5. the initials R.C. were to be their seal, their passwordand their deepest concern; 6. the Fraternity was to remainsecret for a hundred years.In due course Brothers B. and P.D. also departed, but thenephew and Brother I.O. remained with Father R.C. and whilehe was alive two Brothers were always with him.I.O. was the first of the Brethren to die and, as Father C.R.had predicted, in England. He was very learned in the Cabbalaashis Liber,FL shows. There were many stories about him inEngland, e.g. that he cured the young Count of Norfolk ofleprosy.The date of Father R.C.'s death was unknown. All that a latergeneration of Brothers knew about him was from what wasavailable in the library, and of the books there the Axiomata,ilte Rotae Mundi and the Proteus were regarded as the mostuseful.The Second OrderThere came the day when Brother N., who was a skilledarchitect, was about to go on a journey. Before he left hedecided to make some alterations to the building.While the work was in progress he found a bronze tablet onwhich was inscribed the names of all who had belonged to theBrotherhood. A large nail protruded from the tablet. Whenit was pulled out and the tablet lifted away, and with it a largepiece of plaster, a door was discovered. On the door they beheldan inscription: 'Post Centum Viginti Annos Patebo' [Afterr2o years I will manifest], and beneath those words a date.lThe next morning they opened the door and discovered aseven-sided Vault, each side being S ft. high by I fr across.And although the Sun had never shone in this Vault, it wasilluminated as if by sunlight from the middle of the ceiling.In the centre of the Vault there was a circular altar.Each of the seven walls was divided into ten rectangles andon each of the latter were symbols and inscriptions.2 Again, ineach of the seven walls was a door concealing a chest containingvarious objects, e.g. all their books, a copy of the Vocabulariurnof Paracelsus, the MS. journal with the record of Father R.C.'slife and journeys, mirrors with strange fmagicali] qualities,small bells, burning lamps etc. Everything had been left so thatin the event of the Order disappearing it could be reconstructedeven centuries later.They moved the circular altar, lifted a heavy bronze plateand beheld the body of Father R.C., which was in a perfectstate of preservation. In his hand he held the Liber 2., writtenwith letters of gold on parchment. They replaced the bronzeplate on the coffln, moved the altar back into position, shut thedoor of the Vault and sealed it.So much for the legend of Christian Rosenkreuz. As we shalldiscover, the Vault, or at least Mathers's conception of it, was thecentral feature of the 5o : 6o ceremony. Furthermore, some twentyyears later a member of the R.R. et A.C. attempted a symbolicalrepetition of Father R.C.'s mythical journey to the Middle East andyet another, who was convinced that he knew the location of ther The date does not appear in the Fama.z In The Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross, 1924, pp, r32-3r A.

Both these episodes are described laterin this book.The dramatic moment in Mathers's R.R. et A.C. rirual came whenthe candidate was confronted vrith the body of Father ChristianRosenkreuz, in the person of westcott or Mathers, lying motionlessin a coffin-always known as the Pastos-in the Vault of the Adepts,which was Mathers's fantastic 'reconstruction' of Father R.C.'s tomb.The Vault, as conceived by Mathers, who was probably helpedby his artistic wife, was nothing less than extraordinary. My descrip-tion, which is largely based upon rough colour sketches of its variouscomponents in members' notebooks of the l89os, omits an analysisof its incredibly involved symbolism. For the latter the reader isreferred to Dr Regardie's The Golden Dawn, while Aleister Crowley'sThe Equinox (III, i, lgro) is also useful. What we are now concernedwith was, in effect, a seven-sided 'chamber' that was eight feet high andlarge enough to afford space for a coffin, above it a circular altar, andat least four persons.According to the Fama Fraternitatis Mathers had to contrive withinan area of eight by five ft. ten rectangles, containing symbols andinscriptions, on each inside wall of the vault. Since this was mathe-matically impossible he provided forty square areas arranged in eightrows of five. A glance at Fig. 3 shows that the symbolism, which iscommon to each wall, is cabbalistic (cf. the'Tree of Life' pattern ofthe ten Hebrew letters representing the Sephiroth), alchemical andastrological.The most interesting feature of all was the occult colour schemeused for each wall. Mathers had a formidable knowledge of everythingrelating to the lore of occult colour correspondences and made hisown synthesis from many different sources.l A specific colour wasallotted to each symbol with a complementary colour for its rectangularbackground; both being taken from so-called occult colour scales.Thus every rectangle was given a two-colour treatment except onewhich required four colours. Next, a different third colour was appliedto each of the seven walls, and this was based upon planetary colourcorrespondences, e.g. Saturn/indigo, Jupiter/violet, Mars/scarlet, etc.The hand-coloured illustrations of the Vault walls in old G.D.manuscripts show a sort of harlequin effect.r In a letter to F. L. Gardner (r8 November 1896) he mentioned eighteen old worksthat gave the'Scales of Colour attributed to Planets and Zodiac', adding that'TheRosicrucians have the rrzc knowledge of this.'

In the centre was atransparent Rose with twenty-two petals (cf' the twenty-two Pathsin the Tree of Life and the twenty-two Tarot Trumps). In effect thiswas a lamp. The Rose was enclosed in a triangle painted black and thewhole was surrounded by a heptagram, also painted in black.There was a black floor decorated with a symbolical design paintedin white, yellow and red: 'The Great Red Dragon with seven heads'in red, a 'Golden Cross united to the Red Rose of forty-nine petals',all enclosed in a heptagram.This 'Rose and Cross' theme was constantly repeated in the decora-tion of the Vault.Above the Pastos (coffin), which stood on the floor of the Vault,there was a circular altar fitted with castors so that it could be easilymoved. Four large coloured discs, each surrounded with a goldoutline, were painted on its surface. On the red disc there was a greenlion's head, on the yellow disc a male head in purple, while the blueand black ones incorporated the heads ofan eagle and a bull in orangeand white respectively. (Cf. the symbolism on the Warrant, Plate IV.)Certain objects were placed upon the altar, e.g. a black Calvarycross to which was fixed a rose of twenty-five petals, each petal beingin a different colour according to an occult colour scale, a Crook andScourge, also painted with a multi-colour effect, a cup, a dagger, etc.The exterior head end of the Pastos was painted white and decoratedwith a golden Greek cross which incorporated a red rose with forty-nine petals. At the opposite end on a black background there wasa white Calvary cross upon a pedestal of three steps.The right-hand side of the Pastos, both inside and outside, wasdivided into rectangles of different sizes and painted in t'wenty-twodifferent hues representing the so-called Positive Scale of Colours,while the outer and inner left side were painted in as many colourswhich reflected the Negative Scale.The lid of the Pastos was adorned with a complicated symbolicaldiagram.Any candidate who beheld the Vault's amazing interior for thefirst time must have been filled with wonder. In any case it representeda unique repository of occult symbolism.A. E. Waite, who was disposed to criticise rather than admire mostthings connected with the G.D., and who became a fervent Freemasonafter r9oz, v/as not without respect for what Mathers had created.In his autobiography he wrote: '. . . it could not be denied that the84The Second Orderculminating grade [i.e. !o:6o], as the system was then developed,had the root-matter of a greater scheme than had ever dawned in theconsciousness of any maker of Masonic Degrees under any GrandLodge or Chapter, Conclave or Preceptory, in the whole wide world.'rHere the important vrords are 'greater scheme'. As a symbolicalsynthesis of Hermetic lore Mathers's new ritual, with its 'theatrical'apparatus, i.e. the Vault, was quite unlike anything that any 'manu-factory, mint or studio of Degrees'-this phrase is Waite's-hadever contrived before.The ritual took the form of an Opening and three Points or sections.In the Opening, at which the candidate was not present, while theChief Adept remained concealed, the Second and Third Adepts madea number of statements about the Tomb of the Adepti:The Tomb of the Adepti is the symbolic Burying Place ofChristian Rosenkreutz, which he made to represent the Universe.He is buried in the Centre of the Heptagonal Sides and beneaththe Altar, his head being toward the East. He is buried in theCentre because that is the point of balanced forces. The MysticName of Christian Rosenkreutz signifies the Rose and Cross ofChrisq the Fadeless Rose of Creation, the Immortal Cross ofLight. This place was entitled by our still more ancient Fratresand Sorores, the Tomb of Osiris Onnophris, the Justified One.The shape of the Tomb is that of an equilateral Heptagon, afigure ofSeven sides. The Seven Sides allude to the SevenLower Sephiroth, the seven Palaces, and the Seven Days ofCreation. Seven is the height above. Seven is the depth beneath.The Tomb is symbolically situated in the Centre of the Earth,in the Mountain of the Caverns, the Mystic Mountain ofAbiegnus.The candidate was admitted to the Temple at the beginning ofthe First Point. 'The Tomb is prepared as before, but [the door]closed, and the curtains drawn.' At this stage it could not be seen bythe candidate.

He is clothed in full Regalia; on his breast is the completesymbol of the Rosy Cross suspended from the double Phoenix Collar.His arms are crossed on breast, and he holds Crook and Scourgelbetnreen them lies the book'T'. Lid of Pastos is closed and the CircularAltar stands over it. Other Adepti outside Tomb as before. On theAltar are replaced Rose Cross, Cup of Wine, Chain and Dagger.'The candidate enters the Temple again and is placed before theclosed door of the Vault. He is shown the door and the inscriptionPOST CXX ANNOS PATEBOIXHowever, there is no allusion to the roman numerals 'IX' in theFama. The inscription was explained as being equivalent to PostAnnos Lux Crucis Patebo-(At the end of rzo years, I, the Lightof the Cross, will disclose myself. For the letters forming LUX aremade from the dismembered and conjoined angles of the Cross; andrzo is the product of the numbers from r to t, multiplied in regularprogression, which number five is symbolised in the Cross with fourextremities and one centre point.' Needless to say, none of this arcaneinformation will be found in the Fama Fraternitatis.87"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The Second OrderNow the door of the Vault was opened and the Second and ThirdAdepts took the candidate inside. The Chief Adept was not visiblesince the lid of the Pastos was still closed and in any case the coffinitselfwas underneath the circular altar. In due course the Second andThird Adepts move the altar aside, reveal the upper part of the Pastosand open the lid. The candidate, no doubt to his great surprise, beholdsthe head of the Chief Adept, who is lying with his eyes closed.Next, without moving or opening his eyes, the Chief Adept uttersa brief discourse. The Third Adept follows with some informationabout three of the earliest 'Highest Chiefs' of the Rosicrucian Order,namely'Frater Hugo Alverda, the Phrisian [who died] in the y6thyear of his agel Frater Franciscus de Bry, the Gaul, in the 495th yearof his age; [and] Frater Elman Zata, the Arab, in the 463rd year of hisage'. (None of them is mentioned in the Fama.) The candidate isagain led out of the room and 'the Tomb is then re-opened and theChief Adept released'.In the course of the Third Point the candidate is once more admittedto the Tomb and this time discovers the Chief and Second and ThirdAdepts inside; the Chief Adept standing and the two others seated.The inticate painted symbolism is explained in great detail and theceremony then comes to an end.Only a small part of the Second Order curriculum was ready in I892.Judging by one or two brief entries in the Diaries, I have the impressionthat people were not beginning to take various parts of the series ofeight examinations for the senior j \" : 6o grade of Theoricus AdeptusMinor until the aurumn of 1893. For instance, on rt October 1893Dr Berridge scribbled in the Diary: 'Resurgam copied rules forTh.A.M. Exam. He is ready for exam in D[i.e. Divination]-nornext Thursday.' If Berridge, of all people, only had the rules to copyat that date it means that they had only recently been formulated.Again, since he was an enthusiastic astrologer, he may well have taken'D' first, but would at the same time have been examined for hisknowledge of Geomancy and the Tarot.When F. L. Gardner became a member of the R.R. et A.C. in 1895he was given a lengthy document called Ritual 'A' to copy. Thiscontained details of the 'General orders, Mode of Progress, Seriesof Examinations, List of Rituals, List of Flying Rolls'. Most of thematerial will be found in Dr Regardie's The Golden Dawn.The General Orders contained purely administrative details, e.g.'Whenever one Adept writes to another i\" : 6o on Second OrderThe Second Ordermatters he must stamp the envelope in a peculiar manner; viz. in theusual corner, but with the stamp turned round so that the face looksupwards like C.R. in the Pastos.' Thus the recipient would im-mediately know that the envelope contained a communication onSecond Order matters.There are many allusions in the fi92-3 Diaries to newly-initiatedmembers consecrating their Rose Cross Lamens, Lotus 'W'ands,Magical Swords and four Elemental 'Weapons, i.e. 'the Wand forFire, the Cup for'Water, the Dagger for Air, and the Pentacle forEarth'. The procedure for making and consecrating the Lotus'Wand, asdescribed below, is not only typical of what was required for the otherobjects, but throws light on what Mathers taught his apprenticemagicians.The following is based upon RegardierThe Golden Dawnrii, 37-4j.The Lotus'Wand was intended 'for general use in magicalworking' and was carried by Z.A.M.'s at all Second Ordermeetings at which they were entitled to be present. EveryZelator Adeprus Minor was expected to make his own LotusWand without assistance and to 'consecrate it by himself alone'.It was not to be touched or handled by any other person 'andkept wrapped in white silk or linen, free from external influencesother than his [i.e. the owner's] own on the human plane'.The upper end of the Wand, which was to be between z4 in.and 4o in. long, was painted white, the lower end black, andbetween them successively'the twelve colours referring to thezodiacal signs in the positive or masculine scale of colour'.The twelve colours plus black and white could be achieved bypainting them or the use of coloured papers.The Adept was also expected to make the Lotus Floweremblem which was fixed to the white end of the Wand by ascrew or bolt. The flower, which could be made of sheet metal orstiff cardboard, consisted of three whorls totalling z6 petalsand was painted according to a prescribed multi-colour scheme.Instructions were given describing how the Wand was to beheld, e.g. 'use the white end in invocation and the black endto banish'. Again, 'the Wand is never to be inverted, so thatwhen very material forces are concerned, the black end maybe the most suitable for invocation, but with the greatest caution'.The Lotus Flower was not to be touched while working, 'butin Sephirotic and Spiritual Things the Flower is to be inclined8889"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The Second Ordertowards the forehead; and to rise in the planes [i.e. for astralvision], the orange-coloured centre is to be fully directed to theforehead'.The Adept consecrated his Wand according to a prescribedceremony in a private room in his own home.l 'Provide . . .a white triangle, red cross of six squares. Incense, a rose,water in a vase, Lamp or vessel of Fire, Salt on a platter, andan astrological figure of the heavens for the true time ofconsecration. Have ready also the Ritual of the Pentagram, thenew W'and, white silk or linen wrapper, table with black coverfor altar.'The room was first to be purified with fire and water. 'Takethe Wand again, by the white portion. Circumambulate the roomthree times and, at the end, repeat the adoration of the Lordof the Universe, as in the oo : oo Ritual, saluting at eachadoration with the Neophyte Sign, and at 'Darkness' giving the'Sign of Silence'.This was followed by the 'performance of the SupremeInvoking Ritual of the Pentagram at the four Quarters of theRoom, racing the proper Pentagram at each quarter andpronouncing the appropriate Angelic and Divine Names, takingcare to give the Grade Sign appropriate to the Elementr' i.e.Fire, Earth, Air and Water.Needless to say, the Adept never learned all this by heart butcarefully and no doubt slowly followed instructions which he hadpreviously copied from the appropriate manuscript. Again, once anAdeptus Minor had consecrated the seven objects in question, he orshe might not necessarily perform any other magical ceremonies.Indeed, my own view is that for most of them 'practical Magic' cameto an end at this stage.Today Magicians can spare themselves the trouble of having tomake their Swords, Wands and other implements since Mr GeorgeAlexander, of 16 Messina Avenue, London, N.W.6, manufactureseverything that a thaumaturgist could possibly require.r The r89z-3 diaries include about a dozen instances of the consecration ceremonybeing performed at the Second Order's premises.7***F.'g.,1ri.$a{1t,ttt'lliiIil'.11tlt{,1{'flt'/tl1,1,The Second Order Diariesz 89 z-3Two diaries contain much scattered material that throws light upon avariety of matters connected with the Second Order during the yearst89z-3 All members who visited the Second Order's rooms, first atThavies Inn and then at Clipstone Street, wrote their names in thediary and briefly stated their business there, although the latterinformation was often omitted.

However, a close scrutiny of thediaries reveals much that would otherwise not be known.*Mathers's departure for ParisAccording to Mrs Mathers's Preface to the fourth (1926) edition ofThe Kabbalah (Jnveiled, he was 'told by his occult teachers to transferhis centre to Paris', but the reason for his move was more common-place.It can be inferred from Annie Horniman's memorandum of 14 July1898 that Mathers lost his job at the Horniman Museum in r89r.FIe and his wife had to move from Stent Lodge, Forest Hill.They were living at Percy Street and Mrs. Mathers asked me fora 'loan' immediately.

She also invitedMina to join her at Venice for a holiday. On z8 January r89z she gaveher twenty-five pounds for her expenses in Paris, and on 6 March afurther twenty pounds for clothes and the fare to Venice.Mina did not leave London until Sunday 3 April, went ro Veniceand was back in London by ro May. It must have been at this timethat Mathers decided that he, too, would go to paris. They bothleft London on 20 May. The next four remittances amounted to atotal of fifty-nine pounds and were made between r8 May and z3 Juner892. The summary of payments includes the following remark: 'Thiswas for herr but he came and joined her in paris.'Furthermore, Mathers's action was contrary to what Annie Horni-man intended. The relevant passage from her memorandum follows:She went to Paris and studied there; he joined her there . . .and she honestly told me, prevented [her] from giving the bestof herself to her q'ork . . . I remember that she came fromLondon and returned there from Venice direct. They did notremain long in London but in about June [actually May] went tolive in Paris.

A joiner was no doubtemployed to make the seven walls, floor and ceiling, also the circularaltar and the coffin. The carpentry would have been simple enoughbut the elaborate painting and decorative work must have occupiedMathers and his wife for weeks on end.Annie Horniman contributed to the expenses and early in rgoostated thatWhile Mr and Mrs Mathers were painting certain diagrams whichform part of the property [i.e. the Vault] now in dispute, I gaveMrs Mathers the sum of dz to purchase the actual oil paintrequired. Further I gave them a sum d7 or d8 in gold, duringthe progress of the work, for their personal expenses . . . to myknowledge other sums were paid for like purposes by two otherpersons who are no longer members of the Society.Among the documents that I received from my anonymous bene-factor in December r97r there was a notebook in which A. E. Waiterecorded some notes of a conversation vrith Annie Horniman on rzMarch r9ro. He wrote: 'Fortiter [Annie Horniman] took the ; : (Ceremony at Thavies Inn.' The parchment ro11 of Second Ordermembers from the same source-it is described in Appendix IV-indicates that this was on 7 December r89r. Waite continued: 'Theroof was not on the Vault and the painting on the Crook and Scourgewas wet. Fortiter was the first candidate to take it, preceding Sapientia[Florence Farr], because she was going abroad.' Hence Mathers's newio : 6o ritual was ready by the end of r89r.The Second Order's vellum roll indicates that there were alreadytwenty honorary 5o : 6o's who were seniof to Annie Horniman.These included Mrs Mathers, the Rev. and Mrs Ayton, T. H. Pattinson(Horus Temple), Dr Berridge, Miss Theresa O'Connell and FlorenceFarr. In some cases, which will be mentioned later, the individualsnamed above experienced the jo: 6o ceremony after y March 1892.There is no record of any Second Order initiations between AnnieHorniman's on 7 December r89r and the latter date.

Hence more accommodation .wasneeded. Either the room was not available or the premises were in anycase too small because in August the Second order moved to clipstoneStreet.*The Vault at Clipstone StreetClipstone Street was a dingy little thoroughfare running east from themiddle of Great Pordand Street. In a letter to Dr R. W. Felkin(4 May ryoz) l. \\X/.

The inference is that he lay inChristian Rosenkreuz's symbolical coffin and meditated there beforemaking a decision.The landlord of the premises at z4-2t Clipstone Street was a MrGeorge Atkinson, who had a sign-writing business. He agreed tolease the accommodation on Friday rz August and the tenancy,which was probably in Westcott's name, began on the followingMonday. The rent may have been ros. weekly for two rooms.

On Friday z6 August Westcottwas at Clipstone Street between 4 and t p.m. and 'put up lamp',probably in the Vault.Mathers and his wife-henceforth I shall call her Vestigia-wereback in London on 6 September and remained in England untilzo October. Annie Horniman had given them a hundred pounds onr September and parted with a furdrer rwenry on 3 October, so theywere not without money although there were no doubt debts in paris.They both visited the Clipstone Street rooms on 6 September andMathers wrote in the diary: 'S.R.M.D. and V.N.R. called at y.ry andexamined new quarters, which are most admirably fitted for theirpurpose and beautifully arranged.'This must have been an 'official visit', e.g. to attend the traditionalEquinox ceremony; for the Chief to preside at the ceremonial conse-cration of the Vault, for which he had written a special ritual; and to bePresent at four further i\" : 6o Admissions. The Consecrationceremony on zo September was followed by the Admission of theRev. Ayton, the Order's most venerable member. It is significant thathis initiation, in particular, should have taken place on this auspiciousoccasion.

Those already initiated wrote tohim at his home at 396 Camden Road.In January r89z he called at Thavies Inn at about weekly intervals.In February he was there on only three occasions, or perhaps he didnot bother to record his visits in the diary. There is no evidence thatanyone else was there during those two monrhs, although it is probablethat Mathers and Vestigia were busy working on the Vault. However,between March and the middle of August r89z the 'traffic' increased.There were six 'Vault Admissions' to the Second Order and everyadmission meant an additional person who was entitled to know theaddress and enter the rooms for one purpose or another, e.g. tofetch or return Second Order MSS.'Westcott may have transferred all his G.D. papers to ThaviesInn because between r March and r; August he was there forty timesto deal'nrith correspondence and other maiters. During the same periodAnnie Horniman was there fourteen and Florence Farr nine times.Mathers paid eleven visits between r March and zr May 1892, whenhe finally left for Paris.A rough check of all the diary entries for fi92-3 indicates a totalof 439 visits from Second Order members, including r44 for'Westcott,in r892, and rather more tJran a thousandrincluding zyTfor'Westcott, in1893.

This would have been in c. r899-r9oo.Extraordinary were its results. For having carefully celebratedthe ritual he instructed Soror Q.F.D.R. to feed the talismanwith incense, and water it with dew.

It is evident, however, that apart fromher annoyance ar his politicking, his financial extravagance--whichwas wholly at her expense-wzrs a source of worry.In, 1894 she had given him dz8o, but in 1895 her philanthropycost her f,44. Benreen rz January and z1 May she provided dzooin four equal amounts of dyo. Then early in July there was a suddendemand for droo. 'The droo on 6th July 1895 was asked for as theyexpected important visitorsr' she wrote in 1898. 'I thought old Adeptsand I found later they were a duke and his suite. When I arrived inAugust the money was nearly all gone.'tr6tt7Uneasy Relationships t 8gj-GAt this point Soror Fortiter et Recte began to draw in her horns.The remaining payments during r89y were as follows: d1 on 4August, {;o in September and again in October, and another paymentof d7o on 4 November.The letters that follow undoubtedly refer to Annie Horniman'scurrent psychological problems, which clearly had a sexual context,also to Dr Berridge's advocacy of Thomas Lake Harris's teachingsand, by inference, his sexual-pneumatic philosophy (see p. 65 above).I am unable to make much sense of the latter or, indeed, of a greatdeal that was written in these letters. However, they indicate thatAnnie Horniman was in a highly unsettled state, also that trouble wasbrewing in the Second Order.Vestigia's letter of 3r December l89y is a strange document. TheElementals to which she referred were, according to Madame Blavatsky,'the principal agents of disembodied but never visible spirits'.t Vestigiaconnected them with sexuality. She also emphasised t}re nature of herown completely asexual relationship with Mathers and denied AnnieHorniman's apparent imputation that the Chief's teachings were'impure'. Unfortunately there are no documents which explain thenecessity for this reproach. Whatever he wrote or said about sexualmatters was done privately because nothing on this subject will befound in any of the Second Order manuscripts. The text of Vestigia'sletter follows:Klx#,T::lff'My dear Fortiter,Your letter has made me most unhappy. I promised once totell you if I thought you were getting exaggerated or in anyway tending to what you call a tendency to rnania. Probably myadvice and opinions are now worthless to you, as I thoroughlyreverence all the teaching of the R.C. [Rosicrucian] Order.But I will anyhow write to you what I think of your conductin this matter and also about the Elemental Theory which hasbeen the principal subject of the letters.You say, or something to that effect, that you are asked togive up your self-respect. You know that you are not asked tochange your mode of life in any way, or to teach another todo so. Knowing as yet only something of the composition of thehuman being (as a Theor[icus] Adept), you are really not in aposition to give an opinion on these subjects; so that if one ofr H. P.

To return to theElementals, the story of Melusina, Undine, and others you willknow of all refer to ma*iages between human and elemental andyou think them probably very charming stories, because theyhave a halo ofpoetry round them. As to exaggeration in you,you distinctly have a fad as regards sexual sutjects, and ylu 'know it is a dangerous one to have.I doubt if you have thought over all these things vdth anunbiased mind.If you do divination, when nervous or excitable you are apt(but that you know) to obtain false results.

You will cerainly be furious with mebut this must be said.Your last letter to 'SRMD' distinctly implies insult to him,for it attacks his teaching as impure-considering the greatknowledge you have received through him, you might have atleast waited until you had received more knowledge on thesubject before you became so violent.Personally, there is no one in or out of the GD in whosepresence I would less allow myself an impure thought or action-next to the [invisible] Higher Chiefs I respect him more than anyother being in the world-and it has hurt me so much that youshould write as you have done.Before I finish this I must tell you that while we thank youintensely for your great generosiry and kind thoughtfulness inthe past, v/e cannot ofcourse accept anything more from youconsidering that you have charged us with immoral teachings.I think you know we only accepted your generous help becauseby so doing we could have the leisure to obtain for the Ordersome of the knowledge, which most admit is great knowledge-and both 'SRMD', myself and you, have respected this morethan money. ,Of course,we are saddled with this house until April-wehave just given notice this moment when we received your letterand can leave soon. I might have to ask you for just enoughto get clear of the house, as we must set to at once to work for aliving.This correspondence continued throughout January 1895. In theabsence of Annie Horniman's letters to Mathers and Vestigia muchremains obscure. Dr Edward Berridge ('Resurgam') was involved.He had 'issued a pamphlet' and 'urged doctrines which we [i.e. certainSecond Order members] all thought impure and mischievous for theyounger students to whom he offered them'. Unfortunately thepublication in question cannot be traced. However, it probably hadsome connection with the teachings of Thomas Lake Harris (seep. 6; above).tr Tle standard biographical study of T. L. Harris is H. w' Schneider and G, Lawton,A Prcphet and a Pilgrim, 1942. Our Dr Berridge is not mentioned in this book buithere are a dozen references to Dr C. M.

And now I willshow you how this is an error in occult working, and why.'When you entered the Order, you took the motto of 'Fortiteret Recte', that is, you left the 'Miss Horniman' personality outsidethe Order. Do not forget that the uords'person', 'personality'are derived from the Latin word 'Persona'which means 'a mask'.Now if, in the Orderryou will dwell on the outer personalitiesof the others with whom you are associatedl to such :rn extentthat you are actually hindered k working spirirually by theirneighbourhood, as you insinuate you would be, it is a sureproof that you have brought far too much of your own personalitXrinto the working of 'Fortiter et Recte'. Why, even if you weresurrounded by the Qlipoth you ought by this time to be able toprotect yourself and continue your operation.Assuredly, if in an operation of rtte Light you allow yourpersonality as 'Miss Horniman' to act as a factor, you will awakeimmediately the Forces of your Evil Persona. Thus, were it theinvocation of Adonai, or Spiritual Development, you would havea horrible influx ofthe exact opposite ofthe pure, into your sphere;disgusting and obscene thoughts etc., in other words, you wouldawake the Development of the Evil Persona, through the Hunzan.t22qUneasy Relationships t 893;-6If, on the contrary, you are not 'Miss Horniman' but an initiatestriving after Light, the Evil Persona cannot arise.If when you are doing a Magical Working, you trace a symboltoo much in Assiah [the world in which we live and as we' know it], and lay too much value on the mere mechanicalcorrectness of the same, without considering its spiritual effect,you will at once awake the Forces of Doubt, etc, in the EvilPersona, i.e. the Tagaririm [possibly the demonic hierarchy].And it in teaching, you instruct your pupils too much to learnlike school-children instead of student initiates, you will bepaving the way for them to commit the same error.A [magical] Formula properly applied, will awaken a Forcelbut it depends upon the Operator's understanding thereof onwhat plane it is aroused; and thus it is possible to awake an EvilForce through a Divine Formula.And now I must ask you, whenever matters of se.r arise in theOrder, and you are asked for instruction thereon; to refer themto G.H. Frater N.O.M. [Vestcott]; and not judge them yourself,until you can do so apart from your outer personality.I do not want to rake up the matter of your previous letters,but I may say: re Amore-she was recommended Elementalmarriage, because of in her case the ezcffetne danger of invokingan incubus instead of a Fay, through want of self control.rRe 3 : 8 Soul Lecture.

It was requisite thatsuch Member should be me, who, while having the necessaryand peculiar educational basis of critical and profound OccultArchaeological Knowledge should ar the same time not only beready and willing to devote himself in every sense to a blind andunreasoning obedience to those Secret Chiefs:-to pledge himselffor the fidelity of those to whom this Visdom was to becommunicated:-to be one who would shrink neither fromdanger physical, astral, or spiritual, from privation or hardship,i"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Uneasy Relationships z 893_6nor.from terrible personal and psychic responsibility; one who,while receiving for transmission the Hiddin Wisdom of theRosy Cross, should be willing to pledge himself under theseverest penalties possible, that the Order should be worked inconformity with the principles laid down by those Secret chiefsnot only for the present time but in the future also:_and whoshould further possess an Iron Will unable to be broken by anyunlooked for opposition that might arise in the carrying orr, ofthese duties:-he must further pledge himself to obey i\"neverything the commands of the aforesaid secret chiefs 'perindeac.cadayer' body and soul without question and without \"igr.r*\"rr,whether their commands related to:-tvtagical Action in tf,eExternal World; or to psychic Action in other'Worlds orPlanes, whether Angelic, Spiritual, or Demonic; or to the InnerAdministration of the Order to which so tremendous aKnowledge was to be communicated; and that he must furtherbe prepared to abide in any counrry; to undertake any iourneyat a.moment's notice, or to confront the chances of death,pestilencq or elemental upheaval, if called upon in the course offulfilling their demands to do so; that he would furtherundertake, whatever mip;ht occur, never to lose faith in theC-hi9fs of the Order, and to keep his body in such a conditionofphysical health and especially ofvital in.rgy, that the ordinarychances ofcorporal illness and exhaustion rttouia not be perrnittedto become any bar to his constant efforts and exertions:_allthis and yet further conditions were insisted upon as the onlyPledges under which this Divine 'Wisdom *., to be permittedto be given eu1;-3nd these had to be confirmed by the mostterrible Obligations.I, MacGregor Mathers,'S Rioghail Mo Dhream !o : 6o,Deo Duce Comite Ferro 7o : 40, was the Frater selected forthis-W-ork wlom you know as the Chief Adept of the SecondOrder under the title of Deo Duce Comite Ferro which I hadtaken upon me.. .

The conditions in question, being onlythose on which t was to be allowed so great an honour as to bethe Recipient of the Knowledge for transmission to the Order;and also that in all this my obedience v/as not to be the passiveone of an unreasoning Machine, but the active one of theintelligent and voluntary Ministrant of the Magic of the Eternal Gods.These preliminary conditions having been solemnly undertakenby us; then, and only then was I able to proceed to theattainment of the Knowledge of the full l\" : 6o Ritual and of theObligation thereof; and the establishment of the Vault of theAdepts; my guitting England being a necessary preliminarythereto.The working of the Second Order having been thus initiatedI was enabled to proceed to the acquirement of the W'isdomof the Zelator Adeptus Minor Grade for transmission to you:-a work, the enormous strain and labour of which it is impossiblefor me to exaggerate. For, you musr not think that the obtainingof this Knowledge of the Second Order for you has been merelyand simply the somewhat commonplace labour of translating aheap of unclassified MSS ready placed in my hands for thatpurpose.

Westcott wrote to F. L. Gardner on ro Decemberand mentioned that he had heard the news from Percy Bullock and hiswife and learned from them that Mathers had also written to MrsRand ('Vigilate'), who had succeeded Fortiter as Sub-Praemonstratrixof Isis-Urania Temple.

Gardner received some information aboutFortiter's banishment direct from Mathers on about zo December.Not yet a Theoricus Adeptus Minor and a senior member of theSecond Order, although he soon would be, he was now regularlycorresponding with the Chief because he had offered financial backingfor the publication of Mathers's projected edition of The Book of theSacred Magic of Abra-Melin the Mage. Perhaps Mathers felt that heowed his new benefactor an explanation as far as Fortiter was con-cerned, the more so because he must have known that they were closefriends. Accordingly Mathers wrote on 19 December 1896:Re F.E.R. I have most unwillingly been compelled to take theI"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Uneasy Relations hips z g93_6step of removing her from the roll of the Order; for I will notpermit longer her continued insubordination to me. She waswilling 9n-ough, as most of them are, to take all the knowledge Ican teach her; at the same time she does everything in her pJ*.,to counteract my authority in the order.At this point in time Gardner decided to organise a petition forFortiter's reinstarement in the order. The outcomi of this undertakingis described in the next chapter.IO*xxThe PetitionIt is probable that Gardner had already begun to organise the petitionbefore he received Mathers's letter of 19 December, because a numberof people who lived outside London signed the document on zr andzz December. He drafted the text himself, perhaps with Westcott'shelp and approval, and mailed ryped copies to members of the SecondOrder. He may not have had access to a complete list of names andaddresses but achieved a fairly extensive coverage. The recipients wereasked to write the petition in duplicate and send both copies to him.The text he supplied follows:I, the undersigned, having heard with the profoundest regretand sorrow, that you as representative of the Chiefs of theSecond Order have found it necessary to remove our V.H. SororF. et R. from the Roll of the Order: do hereby most respectfullypetition for the reconsideration of the decision on the groundsthat she has for so long been so earnest a Student and so energeticand self-sacrificing a Teacher to those junior to her.For a member who has proved herself so devoted to theOrder, I ask you for a merciful judgment of her failings, whateverthey may have been, and hope you may be able to obtain areversal ofthe Judgment pronounced against her.Your earnest and devoted pupil,ISignature]It will be noticed that Mathers was not being asked to annul hisown decision, but to 'obtain a reversal of the Judgment' pronouncedby the unknown Chiefs of the Second Order.Gardner received thirty-nine replies, of which rwenry-nine wereafFrmative, nine were negative, while one member remained on thefence. Since the signed petitions remained in Gardner's possessionhe cannot have sent them to Mathers, probably because he hld learnedthat the Chief would not accept them.In the meantime Annie Horniman was busy waging her own cam-)r39"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"The Pethionpaign against Mathers from Florence.

E*tr\".t from Mrs Rand's long andrather breathless letter follow:I went and saw Vestigia at Recta pete,s [Miss Ada Waters]yesterday and had a long talk mostly about you. SRMD[tvtathers] is so angry with me he reiuses to ,ee me! V. is exactlythe same as ever and is honestly most distressed about theexpulsion. She said that the order came from the Higher Chiefsand not from SRMD and when he received it he excfaimed:'Not that, it is too hard!' and asked if it could be mitigated.. I asked why he wrore to you as if it were a personaT order ofhis own and he said that he had been ordered to give instructionsin his own name lately, as if everything were givJn out ,fromthe secrer chiefs'people would b\" *\"nting to\"have these chiefsproduced etc. She said that for the last year there has been atremendous test of faith in the Chiefs going on, and over andover again she has wanted to write and telfme to be on our guardbut was not allowed to do so.Every six months the symbols of the I : 6 are looked throughr40The Petitionby those aboye SRMD, and it was last Corpus Christi yourswas wrong and SRMD expected you would be stopped in someway-all the Theorici symbols were more or less wrong. I amjust telling you as V. told me. She distinctly said that no onehad repeatei things about us all to them. SLe and SRMD hadgot astrally all this last year the feelings we had against them andthe things that were said about SRMD's drink, lunacy etc., butthey had no material proof of it till they came over the other day.V. insisted . . . that the chief and important reason of yourexpulsion was that you had grown to put so much personaliryinto all your magical working that it perverted all you did . . .so that the [Secret] Chiefs would not let you have the veryserious Theoricus work that is coming while your magic wastainted as it were.V. told me that when you suggested the money business [i.e.financial support for Mathers] SRMD told you what he wasdoing and should do political work under the Chiefs and shouldalso be mixed up with war and military matters-all the thingsyou hated, and that you had said need make no difference tomoney matters.Of those who refused to sign the Petition only one, Allan Bennett,was openly critical of Annie Horniman in the role of V.H. SororFortiter et Recte.I cannot agree with the remarks in the Petition as to the energy,the self-sacrifice, or the devotion to the Order of our late Soror.On the one occasion when I attended her classes I was beyondall measure shocked at the casual and flippant treatment of theSpirit Vision there set forth. Either this is true and sacred, or itis untrue and profane. And if the former, it should be treated ina very different way to what F. and her class did.

Gardner ('De Profundis Ad Lucem') was a relatively unimpor-tant member of the Second Order when, at the age of thirty-nine, heinvolved himself in Mathers's affairs at the end of 1896. WhereasAnnie Horniman quietly wrote cheques for year after year with noecpectation of any particular personal advantage, Gardner's motivesfor helping the Chief were not wholly altruistic. For his own goodreasons he had decided to'finance the publication of Mathers's projected'Abra-Melin' book. Thus he not only wanted his money back as soonas possible, but also hoped for a substantial profit. Hence when neitherwas forthcoming he soon became impatient. Indeed, only a few monthspassed before he and Mathers were at loggerheads. By comparisonwith Mathers he was a dull dog. Aggressive and tactless, he wasas touchy and quick to take offence as the Chief himself. Nevertheless,Annie Horniman liked him and he had an enduring friendship with'W'estcott, but then Frater Sapere Aude was a tolerant and fraternalman.In the Private Collection there are few documents for the periodfollowing Annie Horniman's expulsion in December 1896 up to theend of 1899. It is fortunate, therefore, that Gardner's G.D. corres-pondence has survived in Mr Gerald Yorke's collection, becausethese letters continue the 'story'. Gardner's G.D. experiences andrelationships are of particular interest because here we have a well-documented case-history of membership of a Magical Order.Frederick Leigh Gardner was born on 3r March 1857 and became amember of the Stock Exchange in 1886 at the age of twenty-nine.During the years r894-r9oo, when he was an active member of theG.D., he ran a small stockbroking firm at 4 Copthall Chambers, closeto the Stock Exchange.Gardner was one of many who joined the Theosophical Societywhen Madame Blavatsky was first in London in 1884.

' ^ rr Mathers presumably intended to investigate Mrs Gardner,s horoscope.l2***Complications GaloreIt is likely that Mathers decided to make an English translation of amanuscript that he had found at the Arsenal Library during the sum-mer of 1896, probably soon after the receipt of Annie Horniman'sfinal remittance in the middle of July. His financial prospects wereuncertain and he hoped that the Abra-Melin book would bring in atleast a little money.lIn the Introduction to his translation Mathers mentioned that adeceased occultist, who may have been Kenneth Mackenzie, had toldhim about the manuscript many years earlier, also that his friend JulesBois had recently drawn his attention to it.2Furthermore, Mathers stated that both rliphas L6vi and Bulwer-Lytton had been familiar with the manuscript and that the latter hadbased parts of his novels Zanoni, 1842, and A Strange Story, on it:'It would also be especially such experiments as those described atlength in the Third Book, which the author of the \"strange Story\"had in view when he makes Sir Philip Derval in the MS. history of hislife speak of certain books describing occult experiments, some ofwhich he had tried and to his surprise found succeedr' Mathers ex-plained.Apart from any financial considerations, Mathers supposed thatthe Abra-Melin book represented a magical treatise of maior import-ance. He was in touch with George Redway, who had publishedhis previous books during the late I88os, in September 1896. He hadasked for fifty pounds for the outright sale ofthe copyright and nowindignantly refused Redway's counter-offer.r The French title of the manuscript (Biblioth0que de I'Arsenal MS. z3yr) is'La sacrdemagie que Dieu donna i Moyse Aaron David Salomon, et A d'autres saints patriarcheset prophdtes, qui enseigne la vraye sapience divine, laiss6e par Abraham I Lamech sonfils, raduite de I'hebreu. r4y8.'

He had already received two cheques for five pounds,but had sent one of them to Gardner. A further fifteen was due ondelivery of the manuscript and a final ten when Redway had recoveredhis costs.Next, on 9 December, he wrote to Gardner and said that he wouldbe 'only too glad of the other d;o', but nothing is known about anyprevious request for this additional loan.

If Redway still wanted to publishthe book he must pay '{,to dovn on delivery of the whole MS.' (lessthe ten pounds already advanced), plus a further ten after Redway hadrecouped his production costs, and given Mathers six bound copiesof the work-in the past he had only received one. Furthermore,Redway was to agree not to make any alterations 'in any part of theMS. of the work'. Finally, if Redway was not prepared to acceptthese conditions Mathers would 'at once return the dro you havealready paid me; and consider all negotiations broken offbetween us'.Redway rejected these proposals and asked for his advance often pounds to be refunded. All he received was a letter referring him toGardner, to whom he wrote on r January 1897:Mr Mathers of Rue Mozart, Paris, writes on z6 ult. to saythat he has 'authorised' you to repay me ten pounds which hehad obtained from me under circumstances which I need not gointo.

I think your proposalre its publication a very just onel only perhaps it is a little toofavourable to me, as you have had so much bother in the matter.As you will see by the final part of this letter I expect torealise a considerable fortune, but that could not be for somemonths.Gardner did not respond to this alluring proposition and Matherswrote again on r January 1897.

Chief refused to interfere.'It is not a personal matter between you and Sapientia, but a questionof technique of [ritual] working, and of whether you possess sufficienttact', he wrote on 9 September. Another letter from Paris followed acouple of days later:I notice that like most people who do not mind hurting otherpeople's feelings; that you are extremely sensitive where yourown are concerned.As you wish to resign from Isis-Urania Temple I accept yourresignation; but I prefer your belonging to some Temple insteadof remaining merely an unattached Member. If you like to joinAhathoor [in Paris], you can, in which case there will be nojoining fee to pay; and you will of course be able to attendother Temples as a Visiting Member.Gardner now considered the possibility of circularising all theSecond Order members about his grievances but Westcott counselledsilence. 'Keep this letter, whatever happensr' he wrote, 'as some dayI may like to psychometrise it, as it seems written by some order.'The Gardner contretemps coincided with the opening of the SecondOrder's new premises at 36 Blythe Road, a turning immediately to thewest of the present Olympia building in Hammersmith Road. Theywere above the offices of Mr C. E. wilkinson, a builder. Gardnerhad presented a book-case and Mrs Rand wrote to him on 16 Septemberto say that she and Reena Fulham-Hughes had iust shelved all theG.D.'s books and catalogued the library and wondered if he wouldbe willing to sell the book-case to the Order.

His letter ended: .If youcan no longer go on with us, for God's sake go away, and leave us inpeace to go our way.'Mathers also wrote to Gardner on z9 September, and for its recipientthis letter must have been the last straw. The communication ls ofparticular interest since it indicates the kind of information that wasrecorded about candidates for admission to the G.D., not to mentionMathers's belief that the mere possession of the Abra-Melin manuscriptthreatened magical dangers for Gardner.Were it not that I perfectly see and recognise the force whichis possessing you, I would either suspend you, req,r.si you tor84r8tComplications Galoreresign, or remove your name from the roll of the Order withoutmore ado.

Do you not think this numberis much too smalllAccording to the prospectus, which was already in proof, theedition was to be 'strictly limited to joo copies' at the pre-publicationprice of a guinea. Gardner carefully omitted to disclose what the bookwould cost after publication. Furthermore, he never meant to limitthe edition to 3oo copies.Mathers signed the agreement on 29 July. The document waswitnessed by Allan Bennett, who was staying with Vestigia andhimself. The copyright was to be owned jointly and the net profitsshared equally, subject to Gardner's right to appropriate the firstsevenry-five pounds of Mathers's portion. At the same time Gardnermade an agreement with John M. Watkins, boo}seller and publisherat z6 Charing Cross, who was to distribute the edition on a ten per centcommission basis. Gardner, on his side, undertook to pay Watkinsthe same commission for any copies he himself sold.Mathers wrote twice to Gardner on 2g September 1897. Both lettersbetrayed his irritation with Frater De Profundis Ad Lucem. Thetext of the first letter is printed on pp. t844, and part of the secondfollows. The manuscript of the Abra-Melin translation had beenreturned to the Chief with the final page proofs. Mathers had agreedthat it should become Gardner's property, and the latter had nowasked for it to be sent to him.

The book was almost ready lor publication by themiddle of January 1898 but there were unexpected delays, to whichMathers attributed occult opposition. He wrote to Gaidner on rjJanuary: 'Many thanks for Prospectus and specimen binding . . . I amnot surprised to hear of the Printer's trouble with strikes etc., consider-ing it was the Abra-Melin book that was being printed.,A thousand copies were at last ready for sale-at the end of February1898.

He wrote rwice to Mathers during October but didnot receive a reply.

Shouldthis prove insufficient, I shall then consider the desirability ofprinting and publishing certain other MSS. that I have, as if Icannot raise the balance one way I shall be compelled to do so inanother.It seems that Gardner did not reduce the price from a guinea tohalf a guinea until the autumn of r9oo. Poor John Watkins foundGardner a tiresome man to deal with, and on r9 April rgoz suggested:'Do you not think it would be best for you to fetch the stock of thisbook awayl . . . Then there would be an end as far as I am concernedto this perpetual friction.'Gardner learned from J. L. Atherton ('semper Fidelis'), Cancellariusof the Horus Temple at Bradford, that he had been unanimouslyelected to membership on z6 September fi97.In his letter of that dateAtherton explained that Horus meetings were rlot as frequent as thoseof Isis-Urania in London because the members lived at different placesin the northern counties and travelling was difficult for many of them.He mentioned, too, that their last rwo meetings had been to celebratethe Equinox, hence in March and September 1897. Thus Gardnercould hardly have expected a succession ofvisits to Bradford. Indeed,there is no evidence that he ever attended a Horus meeting.He soon wrote to T. H. Pattinson, Imperator of Horus, about hisquarrel with Florence Farr. Pattinson replied on 16 February 1898:. . . all the Horus fellows agree that they could not conformin any way to such treatment or pander to dogmatic control,so we have asked Mathers to take over all the Second Orderwork in the Horus so that in future it will not be necessary foranyone to interfere with him. He seems to consider it a compli-ment. Henceforth we shall be detached from London altogether.Our head will be Mathers.Does this please youi No petticoat government for us in anyway.The news that Mathers was to be more closely connected with theHorus Temple than in the past seems to have worried Gardner and hemust have written to Pattinson about it.

I can say fairly all the Horus men that haveseen your letters can and do sincerely thank you for sending thecorrespondence on.

'W'estcott wrote to Gardner on r May fi97 and mentionedthat 'Mathers has now made himself Imperator also of Amen-Ra,displacing [Brodie-] Innes to Praemonstrator and Peck becomesSub-Imperator'.

Towards theend of her long life she became an enthusiastic admirer of Rudolph Steiner. Reproduc-tions of her unattractive 'occult' paintings will be found in A. E.

It takes so much time but the leading part inthe arrangements is taken by our Imperator and Praemonstratrixand Sub-Cancellaria.

The first was datedzr July:I also saw Sub Spe [Brodie-Innes], who is anti-Mathers now asbefore, and also anti-Peck; he has about ry Adept followers andPeck no more.

The implication is that some still hoped that Mathershad further important occult teachings to reveal.Again, there were members who were still intensely curious aboutthe secret and invisible chiefs of the Third order, to whom Mathersowed allegiance.

He played a con_spicuous role in the crisis of confidence in Mathers thit came to theboil early in rgoo-this is discussed in the next chapter-but anupheaval was probably inevitable and would have happened withoutCrowley's eccentric although already typical interveniion.At this point it is only necessary to deal with Crowley's mem_bership of the Order berween November rggg and the end of1899, also to mendon his friendship with Allan Bennett and anti_pathy towards w'.

He then discovered Mathers's The Kabbalah Unveiled, butfound it heavy going. When climbing in the Swiss Alps from Zermat.tduring the summer of 1898 he happened to meet Julian L. Baker('Causa Scientiae'), like Allan Bennett an analytical chemist. Crowleylater described Baker as 'an alchemist of note'.2 They discussedalchemy and Baker hinted that he knew of a Magical Society of thekind that Crowley was seeking. Furthermore, he promised to introducehim to London to 'a man who is much more of a Magician than I am'.3The Magician turned out to be his fellow analytical chemist GeorgeCecil Jones ('Volo Noscere'). Crowley recalled that 'he possesseda fiery but unstable temper, was the son of a suicide and bore astriking resemblance to many conventional representations of JesusChrist'.+G. C. Jones not only proposed Crowley for membership of theG.D. but lent him a copy of Mathers's Abra-Melin book and gave himsome preliminary instruction in Abra-Melin magic. It was this bookthat revealed to him the possibilities of practical magical work andhe now determined to perform what he called 'the Abra-Melin Opera-tion', no matter what effort or cost were involved.Crowley was initiated as Frater Perdurabo in the oo : oo Neophytegrade on r8 November 1898. He recalled inhis Confessions:I took the Order with absolute seriousness. I was not evenput off by the fact of its ceremonies taking place at MarkMasons' Hall. t remember asking Baker whether people oftendied during the ceremony. I had no idea that it was a flatformality, and that the members were for the most part muddledmiddle-class mediocrities. sHis subsequent progress in the Outer Order was rapid.

What hurt him was the knowledge of his ownincomparable inferiority.'rElsewhere in the Confessions he described Yeats as 'a lank dishev-elled demonologist who might have taken more pains with hispersonal appearance without incurring the reproach of dandyism'.2He even imagined that Yeats used black magical practices in order to'destroy'him. This hallucination refers to the period during 1899 whenAllan Bennett was staying with him at Chancery Lane.Whilst deep in these magical practices his [i.e. Crowley's] housein London became charged with such an aura of evil that itwas scarcely safe to visit it. This was not due to P[erdurabo]'sown experiments, we have to consider the evil work of othersin the Order, such as E.F.E.J., who, envious of his progress andfavour with the Chiefs, were attempting to destroy him.rrVhile Crowley disliked Yeats he admired Florence Farr. Therewas 'one charming and intelligent womanr' he wrote, 'Mrs. Emery,for whom I always felt an affectionate respect tempered by the feelingthat her abilities were so inferior to her aspirations'.+After a long search for a suitably secluded house for the preparationsfor the 'Abra-Melin Operation' Crowley found one at Boleskine, onLoch Ness, in August 1899. He moved there from Chancery Lane inOctober or November 1899.It was at about this time that he arranged for Allan Bennett toemigrate to Ceylon where, it was hoped, the warm climate wouldcure his asthma.

It was recorded,too, that Mathers had been Pattinson's guest for a week or two inr898 and that the Chief had attacked'W'estcott. pattinson recalled, orrather Westcott did so on his behalf, that Pattinson had told Mathersthat he 'would not permit such unfair, unjust and unfraternal attackson his old friend'.This reference to Mathers's unfriendly attitude probably explainswhy W-estcott found it advisable on rz September 1898 to procure asigned and witnessed declaration from Albert Essinger, who describedhimself as a director of the Sanitary Wood 'Wool Company Ltd, tothe effect thatduring the years 1887 and 1888 I assisted Dr. William WynnW'estcott with a German correspondence, translated Germanletters and wrote letters in German for him to correspondents inGermany regarding the possession by Dr. William WynnW'estcott of Rosicrucian papers and the granting of grades andtitles in the Rosicrucian Order to him and his nominees. All theseletters were signed by mottoes in Latin on both sides and neverby names, and there was never any mention of money norreward to or for either party. I was not admitted to this Orderor Society of students.On the same day Mark Cubbon Rimmer, who was also employedby the Sanitary Wood'W'ool Company, signed a statemenr in whichhe said that he was aware that Essinger had helped 'W'estcott with thecorrespondence in r888.. .. and I did at Dr. W'estcott's request make a photographiccopy ofone page ofcurious manuscript in cypher or hiero-r96r97Before the Crisis t8g7-gglyphics, furthermore Dr. William W'ynn Westcott wasaccustomed to receiving letters at the Sanitary'W'ood WoolCompany addressed to him by mottoes as well as by name.Westcott, as if apprehensive, was obviously consumed withcuriosity about Mathers's doings, hence his reguest to Gardner on18 September 1898: 'You might pump Kirby and p.n.n. [AnnieHorniman] as to what they know about M. and his visit over here.'W. F. Kirby ('Genetho Phos') lived close to Gardner in Chiswick.Since his involuntary retirement as Chief Adept in Anglia in1897, W'estcott had continued to run his own small private G.D.group. Initially its members were Gardner, Francis Wright, MrsKennedy and Reena Fulham-Hughes. By March 1898 the ladies haddropped out and 'w'estcott formed another group which met at theSanitary Wood Wool Company's o{frces at z6 Thavies Inn. Its othermembers were Gardner, Francis Wright and Colonel Webber Smith.'W'estcott still thought it inadvisable to work with women (see p. r8zabove) and wrote to Gardner about this on r5 March 1898:I have written to FeR [Annie Horniman] thanking for lastreport, and asking her to send written reports as before-butto you first. And for you to hand them to me, and so I shallhave your notes on any different ideas, concerning little details.I feel a curious occult necessity not to act directly, with anySoror occultist, at present time.This may refer to a similar private group, of which Annie Hornimanand Gardner were both members, which had been meeting at a housein Talgarth Road, 'W'est Kensington, since at least September t897.In spite of her expulsion from the Order, Annie Horniman was stillquietly active in G.D. circles.Mathers wrote to Annie Horniman on r8 October 1899 and offered aconditional reconciliation.It is now about three years since I had to remove your namefrom the Roll of the G.D., for serious insubordination aggravatedstill further by slander against myself. In that period of time(even with every conceivable odds against me) I have completelyoverthrown the opposition in the Order which you left no stoneunturned to stimulate and you can now do me no further harm. . .You have had abundant time for reflection in the past threeyearsl and considering your punishment to have been severe,"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Before the Crisis z8g7-9though necessary. . .

But I should adviseyou not to enter upon a guarrel with him in any case.Annie- Horniman preferred to remain ,in abeyance'.A few weeks later Mathers peremptorily suspended Gardner fromthe order. on r3 November ls99 he-wrote to Mathers and threatenedto publish certain unspecified manuscripts written by Mathers inorder to liquidate the chief's financial indibtedness to him (see p. rggabove). S.ince this plan would have meant a further outlay foi printirrg,etc. Gardner was probably bluffing.

W. Felkin, in an article on ,Early psychicExperiences'which was published in pearson's MagaTinerMarch 1924.'There was a small doctor dwelling near me, small in stature, andalso I fear, in practice. Pullen Bury [src] was the name. He wasa student of the occult, and my curiosity was aroused by learningthat he had one room in his house which no one entered buthimself, as it was reserved for mystic and philosophic purposes.,zr The letter vras written on notepaper adorned with a coronet above the initial M andsigned'MacGregor, Comte de Glenstrae'.

Conan Doyle described an unusual dreamv'hich he appeared to equate with an 'astral visit' made by somemember of the Order to discover whether or not he was a suitablecandidate. He decided not to ask for admission. A month or two laterPullen Burry brought Felkin to see him. The article records his twovisitors' extraordinary conversation about an 'astral journey, theyhad made together to Central Africa. Conan Doyle recalled:'To return to the little doctor, he went out to the Klondyke andI lost sight of him for a long time. From what I learnt I shouldjudge that the powers of this society included that of looseningtheir own etheric bodies, in summoning the etheric bodies ofothers (mine for example) and in making thought images . . . inthe way that we are assured is possible by will power. But theirline of deveiopment or philosophy is beyond me. I was destinedto meet Pullen Burry again, for when I was in America last yearI found him full of iosicrucian lore and occult knowledge.W'estcott referred to the article in a letter to F. L. Gardner (r7April ry24):'It was all about the G.D. but both [i.e. pullen Burry andFelkin] appear to have spoken in a wild manner.' He also mentionedthe reason for Pullen Burry's deparrure to the U.S.A. He had desertedhis wife and children and Annie Horniman came to their rescueWhat Mathers called his 'Isis Movement' had no connection withthe G.D. It reflected his long-standing interest in the mystery religionof Ancient Egypr The Rite of Isis, which was a kind of theatricalperformance, incorporated material that he had discovered in theavailable literature. According to a report in the Sunday Chronicleof 19 March t899,'fot some time past they [i.e. Mathers and Vestigia]have- been carrying on their devotions in an underground chapeiwhich they have established at their residence'.The Rite and its authors were in due course 'discovered, by JulesBois, Mathers's journalist friend who had a detailed knowledge ofParis's occult 'underground', and it was he who persuaded them togive a public performance of the Rite at the Bodinidre Theatre in theRue Saint-Lazare in March r 899.1 According to the paris correspondentr The Bodiniare Theatre was a small house which could be hired for single performancesand lectures. For instance Madame A. de Thdbes, the well-know]r ftrtune-teller,discoursed there on palmistry on 4 April r9oo.Be.fore the Crisis t8g7-gof the Sunday Chronicle, they had 'a crovrded audience, composedchiefly of lovers of mysticism'. Monsieur Bois was there and ,made avery laudable effort to explain this ancient and somewhat complicatedreligion to us, and then endeavoured to justify this transfer of theceremony of worshipping and invoking Isis to the theatrical surround-ings of the Bodinidre'.The following brief account of the performance by Frederic Leesis taken from the New York periodical the Humanisr, February rgoo:In the centre of the stage was the figure of Isis, on each sideof her were other figures of gods and goddesses, and in front wasthe little altar, upon which was the ever-burning green stonelamp. The Hierophant Ramses [Mathers], holding in one handthe sistrum, which every now and then he shook, and in theother a spray oflotus, said the prayers before this altar, afterwhich the High Priestess Anari [Vestigia] invoked the goddessin penetrating and passionate tones. Then followed the .dance ofthe four elements' by a young parisian lady, who, dressed in longwhite robes, had previously recited some verses in French inhonour of Isis. A short time before this lady had become aconvert. . . . Most of the ladies present in the fashionableParisian audience brought offerings of flowers, whilst the gentle-men threw wheat on the altar. The ceremony was artistic in theextreme.The Sunday Chronicle's correspondent was amused rather thanimpressed by Mathers's performance.. . . when he opened his mouth ro make his prayer to Isis wewere astonished to note that he had a terrible English accent . . .He looked for all the world like a North yorkshireman or aScotchman. And, sure enough, when I made enquiries after theperformance a braw Highlander he proved to be. M,Gregor is hisname, but whence he comes I know not. They call him .CountM'Gregor' in one of the French newspapers, but this, M. JulesBois says, is a mistake. 'Monsieur M'Gregor is only the chief ofan old Scottish clan!' Reallyl How delightfully they mix things' up on this side of the channel . . . His wife, on the other hand,completely won their sympathy by her graceful attitude anddignified manner.

He appears to have hoped that the 'Isis movement'would be capable of expansion. Hence his pleasure when a Mr andMrs Horos, who were accompanied by a Dr Rose Adams, called athis house in the Rue Mozart and offered their assistance. His acquaint-ance with them was brief and disastrous.I4S4 g S4,,a\\ /a\\ /a\\Rebellion in LondonEarly in r9oo, possibly in January but certainly before 16 February,Mathers received three visitors at 87 Rue Mozart.

So far fromgiving me 'hundreds of pounds' (for the Isis movement), it wasI who helped them with what little I had, for I offered all threeas much hospitality as I could when I saw that getting mealswas an object to them. They had to leave Rue Lauriston as theirtrunks were seized for rentl but a few weeks later they came tor Charles Rosher ('Aequo Animo') told Aleister Crowley that Mrs Horos had probablylearned everything she knew about the G.D. from American members of the Orderwhom she had previously met in New York, See The Equinox, I, iii, r9ro, p. 265n.The Americans would have been initiated by Mathers in Paris,r The implication is that there was already a G.D.

They also called onme several times but I would not receive them.For the woman; she is probably the most powerful mediumliving and her mediumship differs from the usual. At times shehas been controlled by very great and high forces, but much morefrequently by evil spirits. For she is frequently a shell withouthonour, truth, or morality . . . I believe her and her accomplicesto be emissaries of a very powerful secret Occult Order whohave been trying for years to break up other Orders andespecially my work, and the G.D. as connected therewith.I may tell you that on more lhan one occasion I conversedface to face with the real'sapiens dominabitur astris [i.e.Friulein Sprengel] in this v/oman; but on another occasion Idetected a demoniac simulacrum of that transformation, as sinceI have detected also on one or two occasions, for the entity ofMrs. Horos has been like a battle between two Orders.Initially then, Mathers was convinced that Mrs Horos was noneother than the German Adept Friiulein Sprengel, who was not dead,as he had supposed, but apparently very much alive. He told AleisterCrowley that the bogus S.D.A. had 'related to him details of a veryprivate conversation he had had with Madame Blavatsky at DenmarkHill', that he believed that she 'possessed the power of changing herappearance from age to youth andyice tersd', and that he thought ,thatthe real H. P. Blavatsky and the real S.D.A. can reincarnate in her'.r Inshort, while Mathers soon realised that Mrs Horos and her companionswere swindlers, he never doubted her mediumistic gifts.R. B. Nisbet ('Ex Animo'), a British member of Mathers,s AhathoorTemple, called upon Westcott on c. rt June rgoo and told him aboutthe Horos couple. Westcott made some notes which need not bequoted at length here.They seemed Americans, she was a very stout fair lady of 6o,resembling Mrs. Tingley [the American Theosophical leader], shealso called herself Swami Vivekananda [sr'c], but g\"n. tto r.uiname. She was introduced to Mathers who took her up andintroduced her to an Ahathoor Temple meeting ar \" g.e\"tforeign G.D. member who belonged to lhm6 Temple No. g inAmerica. He said she was known as Sap. Dom. Ast. and was notdead as S.A. [W'estcott] made out. Nisbet saw her several timesand she told Nisbet that she was an 8o : 3o and he had askedr See ZAe Equinox, I, iii, r9ro, pp. 2i9 et seq.20420,Rebellion in LondonMathers if that was true, and he answered that he would tellNisbet in a few days. He did not do so. Mathers lent her all theFirst Order Rituals.Finally there is some additional information in a letter written byHelen Rand ('Vigilate') to Annie Horniman on ro October r9oo.. . . this, as far as my memory seryes, is briefly an accountof the undoing of a 7 : 4fMathers] by a bogus g : 3 [MrsHoros] . . . The lady herself was about sixty years of age andof extremely stout figure but withal of gracious and attractivemanner. Her husband was about thirty years her junior and mademuch less pretensions to occult knowledge. Madame Horosexplained her great stoutness by saying she had absorbed MadameBlavatsky's spirit on the physical death of that lady and that hadoccasioned her swelling to such dimensions. ApparentlyD.D.C.F. [Mathers] accepted her description of herself as an3 : 3 and on the strength of her being in Paris he wrote [a]letter to London in which he described Sap. dom. ast. as thenworking with him in Paris. . . . During the early part of theHoros episode D.D.C.F. and Vestigia were radiant over whatthey thought was the probability in the near future of theconsummation of their schemes for the introduction of Isis-Vorship in Paris.In December rgoo 'Westcott, Gardner and Percy Bullock all hadbrief personal encounters with the Horos couple, who appear to havebeen attempting to penetrate the Order in London. The ultimateHoros scandal, in which the G.D. was unpleasantly involved, came ayear later.In February tgoor at the time when Mr and Mrs Horos were makinga fool of Mathers, at Boleskine in the Highlands of Scotland FraterPerdurabo, otherwise Aleister Crowley, aged twenty-four, wasbeginning to write a day-to-day account of the progress of the Abra-Melin operation.l From this chaotic document I have extracted onlymaterial relating to Crowley's movements during the first fourmonths of r9oo.

The implications were serious. If, indeed, Westcotthad faked the Anna Sprengel letters, then the supposed German'authority'for starting the G.D. in England was an invention and theOrder had been built upon a foundation of sand. Again, if Mathershad always known of the alleged deception, who could be trustedlShe did not reveal the letter's contents to anyone until Saturday,3 March. In the meantime Westcott was unaware of the storm ahead.He wrote to Gardner on zo February:I had a note from Robert Scott [unidentified] last week speakingof an important Hermetic meeting to decide whether to keepthe Lodge [i.e. the Isis-Urania Temple] open or nor and askingme to become Chief, but I am not in the humour to get mixedup again, as Mathers is so erratic, so I wrote and said I could notattend nor take up office in the Society again . . . Please let meknow, if you can find out, what decision the Herm[etic] peoplecome to.In a later letter to Gardner, dated 16 March, in vrhich he mainlydiscussed astrological techniques, Westcott indicated that he was still' ignorant of what was afoot. 'I have had no letter nor news of any one ofa Theosophical [i.e. G.D.] character,'he wrote.i Florence Farr eventually arranged a strictly private meeting withMr and Mrs E. A. Hunter, W'. B. Yeats, Marcus W'orsley Blackden', and Percy Bullock. In the meantime the latter had moved to 69Thornton Avenue, Bedford Park. George Cecil Jones had been askedto attend but could not be present. Three of them formed a provisionalSecret committee to consider the situation, but soon co-opted fourmore members. Bullock wrote briefly about this to Mathers on 4March and asked him to prove his allegations.2tt)"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Rebellion in LondonMathers did not reply to Bullock's leter.

'Westcott already knew about Mathers'saccusation because in a private memorandum containing a briefrecord of Yeats's visit he mentioned that his lawyer had advised himzt2213Rebellion in Londonto 'abstain from any statement until compelled to enter into con-troversy'. He wrote to Yeats, again probably on zo March:Prirrate, to the Committee on which Frater W'. B. yeats isacting.Dear Sir, and Frater YeatslYou and your fellows are in possession of a mass of mostvaluable occult science which you learned in the lodges of theG.D.

He wrote to Florence Farr on z3 March:My letter was a personal one to you, I did not empower you toform any Committee for its consideration, and I refuse torecognise such Committee. I forbid the meeting of the SecondOrder called for tomorrow; and I charge you on your pledge ofobedience to me as a Theoricus Adept to abstain from furtheraction in the matter.I, furthermore, remove you from your position as myRepresentative in the Second Order in London, for I can nolonger feel confidence in you as such.The Second Order's meeting was held on the Saturday afternoonand the membership of the committee was confirmed. It now officiallyconsisted of Florence Farr, W'. B. Yeats, Mr and Mrs E. A. Hunter,Marcus W'orsley Blackden, Percy Bullock and G. C. Jones. It was alsoresolved 'that all official work or actions of the Order, apart from thespecial work of the Committee and such part of the routine work ofthe Order as they may think desirable, be suspended until the Com-mittee report'. Percy Bullock appears to have been appointed as thecommittee's secretary. He wrote to Mathers that same evening:It is unfortunate that you did not mark your letter to S.S.D.D.'private' in the first instancel now however, that it has beenfreely disclosed within the Second Order, members feel-andI am bound to say that I concur in the view-that theconstitutive warrant upon which the Order was originallyfounded is impugned, because the correspondence q'hich nowturns out to be forged (and which I and others remember quiteclearly) led up to the warrant, granting it in fact to the originalthree chiefs.Abstention on our part to follow the matter up, would clearlybe the equivalent to compounding a felony, and the universalfeeling is-and here again I cannot refuse my concurrence-that no obligation subversive of morality can be binding whetherby natural law or the law of the Land. . . .One more thing I wish to point out as regards myself, andthat is that the correspondence in question, shown to me as itwas, years ago, was not without its influence upon my mind,2142t,Rebellion in Londonassuring me (as I considered) in some positive measure of the€xistence of the secret Chiefs of the Order; indeed, as I analysethese impressions, I find they were almost exclusively derivedfrom that source. Certainly this was so in the earlier stages . . .As a piece of historical evidence, I know I have often mentionedthe matter of these letters and their contents to others in theSecond order both before and since their withdrawal, and tothat extent at least, have unwittingly assisted in the perperuationof the deception. To such, in justice to myself, I owe the dutyof a correction.At this stage, in default of any proof to the contrary by Westcott,accepted the proposition that the Anna Sprengel letters hadforged. It is interesting to note that whereas they had once beenible in the Second Order archives, they had clearly been removedWestcott.The Committee met again on z9 March. In the meantime Percyhad visited'W'estcott but did not learn anything very useful.Fra. L.O. reports having seen V.H. Fra.

A man arrived at about r o,clock, whoshowed a letter from Mr. CrowleS asking him to attend at 36Blythe Road, at r r o'clock, but he had been all over Londonsearching for Blythe Road. He did not guite know what he hadcome for, he thought drere was some sort of entertainment on.Yf:_C. had engaged him, he said, outside the Alhambra [musichall], evidently in the official capacity of chucker-out. I took theman's name and address. Mr. Wilkinson was interested in thematter of Mr, Crowley's intrusion from the fact that his namewas on the black list of the iournal of the Trades' protectionAssociation, to which Mr. Wilkinson belonged. Mr. Crowleygave as his authority for entering the rooms, the Earl ofGlenstrae, otherwise Count MacGregor. There were numeroustelegrams that day for MacGregor, 36 Blythe Road, and late inthe evening a foreign telegram. These were all refused, namebeing unknown. A parcel early in the morning arrived fromClarkson, wigmaker, for Miss Simpson, whicli was handed toher on her departure.The Second Order Committee met later the same day and formallysuspended Mathers, Dr Berridge and Mrs and Miss 3impson frommembership of the R.R. et A.C. pending the decision of tle Collegeof Adepti. It resolved, too, that 'no person shall be deemed to belon'gto the London branch who has not been initiated by that body iiLondon'. The Crowley precedent had been suficient io show that itwould be unwise to accept anyone initiated by Mathers in paris.The Committee had already.decided to ,ri\" a camouflage name,The Research and Archaeologicil Association, for the secoi'd ordeiby zo April, when Dr Beridge acknowledged a letter from E. A.H-u1ter informing him that he had been suspended from membershipof the R.R. et A.c. Frater Resurgam made it clear that he intended tLremain loyal to Mathers. He wrote:I am in-receipt of your note of yesterday in which you conveyto me the decision of the self-appointed and unauthorisedcommittee of your new Archaeological Association.The Battle of Alythe noadI have read it carefully but am at present unable to decidewhether impudence or imbeciliry is its predominantcharacteristic.As I have never been a member of your new Society I cannotbe suspended from such non-existent membership.Nevertheless, I am a gentleman, and desire to associatesolely with men and vromen of honour. your letter shows methat the Committee fully recognises the distinction.Percy Bullock sent him a brief reply which ended: 'MeanwhileI observe that you have felt it necessary to explain that you are agentleman.'It was considered advisable to protect other G.D. property frompossible attack by Crowley. Julian Baker wrote to E. A. Hunter on19 April:I would suggest that you obtain possession of all our [OuterOrder] properry properly belonging at Mark Masons' Hall andkeep them at your house for the present. We must be preparedfor anything, for in Crowley we are dealing with a man withoutprinciples . . . You and I are responsible for rituals, robes etc.now, as I have just heard from S.S.D.D. [Florence Farr] thatBlackden has thrown in his lot with Crowley & Co.Blackden's attitude seems to have been ambivalent throughoutthe crisis. On zr April he wrote to an unidenti6ed correspondentto say that he had placed all the G.D. property in his charge 'in aplace of securiry, with strict instrucrions that it is not to be givenup to any one, not even on the authority of my signature, but onlyto me personally when I shall go to fetch it myself'.A General Meeting of the Second Order was held at 116 Nether-wood Road on Saturday zr April and was attended by twenty-twomembers. The minutes were drafted by Annie Horniman, who hadnow returned to the fold although she did not formally apply inwriting for reinstatement in her old position as Sub-praemonstratorof Isis-Urania Temple until z6 April.There is no need to deal at length with the business transactedon zr April. W. B. Yeats, now one of the oldest members, 'gave anaddress on the history of the Order and explained the illegalities whichhad crept in, in recent years'. Colonel W'ebber Smith 'referred to theThird Order and asked how it was that they [i.e. the Secret Chiefs])"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"The Battle of nlythe noaddid not manifest themselves'. The record of the Colonel's interventionwas omitted from the official minutes.The outcome of the meeting is more clearly stated in the printed'Statement of Recent Events' (which was circulated to Second Ordermembers in May rgoo) than in the minutes.. . . it will be seen that D.D.C.F. [Mathers], as Chief of theOrder, has placed himself in an untenable position. If hisaccusation of forgery be true, he has knowingly, and on hisown showing for many years made use of that forgery forhis authority as Chief; if his statement be false, he has beenguilty of a slander on one to whom he was bound by the mostsolemn pledges of fraternity and fidelity, both as a member ofthis Order and as a Freemason.In either case, the conduct has been such as absolutely todestroy the confidence ofthe Second Order in London.Therefore the Second Order in London (berween yo and 6omembers) is, with the exception of five members, unanimouslyresolved that it will no longer recognise D.D.C.F. as Chiefof the Order, and that its connection with him is absolutelysevered.A New Constitution was framed for the conduct of theSecond Order on April zrst.The Executive now consists of a Moderator, a Scribe, and a'W'arden, seven Adepti Litterati and the three Chiefs and thethree principal officers of the Isis-Urania Temple, whotogether form a Council which governs the Order.The Moderator, Scribe and the seven Adepti Litterati areannually nominated by the rwelve most advanced adepts andelected by the members of the R.R. et A.C. in London.The Executive elected on zl April consisted of Florence Farr(Moderator), Annie Horniman (Scribe), E. A. Hunter (Warden).The function of the Adepti Litterati, whose names follow, was toprovide instruction in their respective specialities: Mrs Rand (Divina-tion), Mrs Hunter (Clairvoyance), Reena Fulham-Hughes (Tarot andEnochian Chess), M. W. Blackden (Ceremonial), Charles Rosher(Symbolism), W. B.Yeats (Mystical Philosophy) and Henrietta paget(General Instruction).Crowley was probably unaware of the resolutions passed onzr April when he mailed the following document, probably to FlorenceFarr, on Monday z3 April.zz8229The Battle of Alythe Aoadry Randolph Road, Maida Vale, W.The Envoy of G.g.

Florence Farr was described as President and E. A. Hunteras Treasurer, while 'Mr Mathers (known as Comte MacGregor deGlenstrae) who resides in Paris is an Honorary Head, but without anycontrol over the Society's financial affairs'. Furthermore, 'Mr MathersI"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The Battle of Blythe Roadhas never been upon the premises at Blythe Road, nor has he con-tributed to the funds'.lThis preamble was followed by an account of Crowley's intrusionsat Blythe Road on ry and r9 April. On r9 April ,certain things ofpecuniary value to the Society were found to be missing'.The case did not come before the magistrate because Crowley,no doubt on his solicitor's advice, withdrew the charge before theparties entered tle court room, possibly because the defendants couldestablish that their property was worrh much more than fifteen poundsand the case was therefore outside the court's jurisdiction. Crowley'slawyer signed an undertaking to the effect that the summons waswithdrawn and five pounds costs would be paid within seven days.Thus S. L. MacGregor Mathers, alias the Earl of Glenstrae, CounrMacGregor, and his Temporary Envoy plenipotentiary AleisterCrowley, alias Count Vladimir Svareff, Aleister MacGregor, EdwardAleister, etc. etc. had lost the Battle of Blythe Road.Mathers was convinced that he was the victim of a conspiracy ledby Florence Farr and fV..B. yeats who, he suggested in a ietterto M. W. Blackden (26 April rgoo), had asked Westcott to becomeChief of the Order 'should they succeed in shaking off my authority,.Extracts from this communication follow:But I admit that l have committed one great though avoidablefault, which is this: in giving these persons so great a knowledgeI have not also been able to give them brains and intelligenceto comprehend it, for this miracle the Gods have not granted methe power to perform.

Could they have onlyunderstood this, the present difficult position in which theyhave voluntarily placed themselves would not have arisen.Crowley rerurned to Boleskine at the end of April rgoo butremained there for only a few days. He closed the house and went tor Mathers was in England in 1898 when he visited r. H. pattinson and the HorusTemple at Bradford. His failure ro go to Blythe Road indicates that there was alreadytension between Florence Farr and himself.23023rThe Battle of Blythe RoadParis to see Mathers who, he still believed, might really be in touchwith the Secret Chiefs of the Third Order and hence lzs only linkwith them. The following extract from 'The Temple of Solomon theKing' in The Eguinox is of interest because it throws light on Crowley,ssubsequent attitude to Mathers.Towards the end of April, r9oo, p[erdurabo] returned to hislonely house in the north, but only remaining there for afew days, he travelled back to paris. For it was now pastEaster, and so too late in the year to begin the operation ofAbramelin.He had, as we have seen, induced D.D.C.F. [Mathers] to putin force the Deadly and Hostile Current of Will, but, as inthe case of the Jackdaw of Rheims, nobody seemed a penny theworse. One might have expected that D.D.C.F. having failed,P. would have abandoned him. No, for it seemed still possiblethat D.D.C.F., really in touch with the supreme Chiefs, hadyet finally decided to sray with Christ upon the Cross: ,Father,forgive them, for they know not what they dor, even though thistheory was somewhat rudely shaken by D.D.C.F. spending thewhole of one Sunday afternoon in rattling a lot of dried peisin a sieve under the impression that they were the revoltedmembers: as subsequent events proved, they were only the ideasin his head.So we find P. still loyal, if a little sceptical, and searchingwithin himself to discover a touchstone by which he mighrprove beyond doubt the authenticity of D.D.C.F.'s claim torepresent the Masters.l_ However, according to another passage in 'The Temple of Solomonthe King', scepticism ultimately prevailed:. . . in rgoo one Pferdurabo], a brother, instituted a rigoroustest of S.R.M.D. [Mathers] on the one side, and the Order onthe other . . . He discovered that S.R.M.D., though a scholar ofsome ability and a magician of remarkable powers, had neverattained complete initiation: and further had fallen from hisoriginal place, he having imprudently attracted to himselfforces of evil too great and terrible for him to withstand.*The claim of the Order that the true adepts were in chargeof it was definitely disproved.t The Equinox,I, iii, r9ro, pp,2.66-7.I"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"The Battle of Slythe AoadIn the Order, with two certain exceptions and two doubtfulonesrl [g found no persons with any capacity for initiation ofany sort.He thereupon, by his subtle wisdom, destroyed both the Orderand its chief.*Presumably Abramelin Demons (A.C.)Before Crowley sailed for New York late in June rgoo he may haveattended a Neophyte initiation ceremony in br Beiridge,s new andrival Isis-Urania Temple No. 3, which was under the Mithers obedi-ence.2 The Horus Temple at Bradford and the Amen-Ra Temple atEdinburgh also remained loyal to the deposed Chief, ar least for thetime being. The Horus Temple may have ceased to function soonafter r9oo. The later history of Amen-Ra is obscure. It was more orless dormant for a period during the early rgoos and then revived byJ. W'.

It q/as undoubtedly printed by Mathers on his own handpress. The tyie_setting and presswork both betray his lack of expertise. on rz November rs97'heasked F. L. Gardner for a loan often pounds to buy a press and type so that he couldprint limited editions ofmanuscripts that he had found it the Arsenal Library.

They hadlatterly been in South Africa but had hurriedly left Cape Townupon learning that a warrant for their arrest was about to be issued.In London they immediately tried to penetrate the G.D.

The latter wroteto Mathers and mentioned that 'in accordance with our ancienttraditions I cross-examined him and found him to be a fraudulentpretender or an accomplished liar, his answers as to the grades of hislady were hopelessly wrong so that she is probably also an impostor'.Percy Bullock appears to have been the last to have encounteredMr Horos at that time. He wrote to Annie Horniman on ro December:I had the pleasure of seeing Mr Horos the other day; the ladywaited outside in a carriage. To cut a long story short, heretired discomforted. He did not give the name of Horos but anIndian name, stating that, as occultists, they had no fixed abodebut were then stopping at Bedford Street, Charing Cross.They hailed, he wrote, from the Temis Temple in India and hadpassed a pleasant two months in Paris.

My view of the matter is that shehas drawn upon herself the force which the Masters say hasbeen trying to disintegrate rhe Order and that this force haswarped her mind and made her take up her extraordinaryattitude of suspicion towards everyone in the Order, being aidedtherein by one or two who have egged her on by pervertedrepresentations of what has been said or done by members of theOrder.He returned to the problem of Annie Homiman a week later (r4 May):You will probably have heard from Fortiter. I think it willbe necessary for her to be very kindly but firmly told that sheis very largely to blame for the difficulties in the Order duringthe past two years and that this ever-lasting fault-finding isagainst the Hod clause [in the yo : 6.

Since two of the three signatoriei were iawyers thedocument reads like a judicial summing-up before instructing a juryto declare a prisoner not guilty. But the Chiefs were mistaken if theysupposed that Annie Horniman would now leave them in peace. Shewas determined to have her 'Banishing Ceremony' and her pro-nunciamento on the 'sphere' group was read at a Second Ordermeeting held at Mark Masons' Hall on zz November r9oz.Soror Fortitef et Recte, Th.A.M., cfaves to represent to theChiefs as follows:r.

The symbol used by the group was a faulry one, moreopen to the Klippoth than to Kether so liable to draw intoitself astral forces.V.H. Fortiter et Rece affirms and believes that such evilforces were drawn into it. She denies positively ever havingsaid or thought that the members of the said group *.r. .i.h.,evil-either in themselves or in the organisati6n, but ,hebelieves them to have been misled or deluded in the symbol underwhich they were associated.II. She believes and affirms that the Egyptian astral occupyingthe centre-of the sphere symbol was notln harmony with tireOrder and that any influence exercised by that urtrul *\", hurtful248z49The Interregnurnto the Order. Moreover that no member has any right to addto an Order symbol or ceremony a new and possibly alieninfluence or to alter or mutilate for any purpose whatever symbolshanded down to us in the Order.III. She believes and affirms that this faulry and prejudicialsymbol connected with the alien and hostile Egyptian astralbecame occultly inserted into the Order-producing definiteprejudicial affects upon it.IV. She believes and affirms that though the group no longermeets or works, many of its members having left the Order, theastral symbol created by it and its astral shell still remainsand is still capable of iniuring and perhaps destroying the Order,especially by crippling its development in spirituality as wellas in material growth, through preventing want of perfectconfidence amongst its members.V. Holding these opinions, the V.H. Soror submits to theChiefs that it is eminently desirable that this astral symbol orshell should be banished and disintegrated for ever byappropriate (magical) ceremonial.VI. To this it is absolutely essential that all members ofthe group or sympathisers now remaining in the Order shouldformally consent, indicating thereby their willingness that thesaid group, its teachings and formulae and ceremonies shouldcease absolutely and for ever be dissolved.- It being clearly understood that such consent does not implythat in joining such a group or in taking part in its ceremoniesthey did willingly or consciously anything evil or anythingprejudicial to the Order or ro any of its members.VII.

Thus inorder to dispose of the matter once and for all the chiefs decidedthat no action could be taken against Florence Farr or anyone else.At about this time Dr Felkin wrote a paper on ,The Group as Iknew it, and Fortiter'. It is too long to reprint here, but the followingextracts throw light upon the Sphere Group's arcane operafions:'When the first Group was formed by Mrs. Emery [Florence Farr],she told us that D.D.C.F. [Mathers] approved of ,uch groups, asalso did S.A. [W'estcott] and that indeed S.A. had once?ormedsuch a group himself.The objects of the Group were: to concenrrate forces ofgrowth, progress and purification, every Sunday at noon, andthe progress was rst, the formulation of the t*.Iu. workers nearbut not in 36 [Blythe Road]; znd Formulation round London;3rd, Formulation round the Earth;4th, Formulation among theConstellations. Then gradually reverse the process, bringing thequintessence of the greater forces to the lesser. The process wasto take about an hour.A somewhat similar but far simpler exercise would be an experimentThe Interregnunin group telepathy. These people, however, were engaged in ,astraljourneys', or so they imagined.The members of the first group were Miss Waters, Mrs. Macrae,Mr. Blackden, Mrs. Rand, Mr. Hunter, Mrs. Kennedy, Mrs. paget,Mr. Palmer Thomas, Mrs. Hunter, Mrs. Emery, Miss Butler [laierMrs. E. A. Hunter] and myself. Our Order names were never usedand an Egyptian figure occupied the centre ofthe Sphere.With regard to the Order rooms [at 36 Blythe Road] beingused for the Group, I do not think that the Group met theremore than four or five times at the utmost and there were twomeetings at Mrs. Emery's private rooms, but meetings .were notnecessary for the work of the Group.Now the original Egyptian Group only lasted from thesummer of 1898 to rgor, when we had a meeting and we weretold that the Egyptian had retired from the Group and theGroup as it was then constituted was brought to an end, thereason being that he was changing his place on the higher planesand could no longer work with us . . . so the second Group wasformed having the Holy Grail on the central pillar.Annie Horniman's original opposition to the Groups, which wasshared by Yeats, was because she supposed they represented alien andmagically suspect activities. By the end of r9o2 th; Groups had longsince ceased to function and yet she was still obsessed by the memoryof this awful heresy. A passage in Dr Felkin's memorand,r* ,.,gg\"ri,the reason for her persistent nagging: 'She takes up the positionlhatshe is the Senior Adept; she believes that she is in touch with the rhirdOrder, i.e. the Purple Adept, and that she, although not recognised,is really the Chief of the Order.'I do not know if the Banishing Ceremony was actually performed.However, Annie Horniman resigned from the Order at the end ofFebruary r9o3, possibly because she realised that she would notsucceed in overthrowing Felkin, Brodie-Innes and percy Bullock.Her magical career came to an end and henceforth she devoted hergifts and energies, which were considerable, to the theare: first atDublin where she built the Abbey Theatre for her dear friend W'. B.Yeats and the Irish National Theatre Society, and next at Manchesterwhere, as proprietor of the Gaiety Theatre, she pioneered the modernBritish repertory movement.However, even without Annie Horniman and many others, theOrder, endowed with its own peculiar vitality, continued to function.2tr"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"r7***A.

As far as he was concerned thetime had come to bid farewell to the past and continue the G.D. on adifferent basis.The unilateral secession engineered by Waite was based upona rigid interpretation of the rules. In rgoz the Order had reverted tothe 'Three Chiefs' system because it was supposed, however illogically,that this would enable the hypothetical link with the Third Order tobe re-established. But Percy Bullock had suddenly resigned, possiblyvery soon after the general meeting held in June r9o3 and nobody wasappointed in his place. Waite wrote to Brodie-Innes on r August r9o3:. . . it was decided by our section prior to the issue of thestatement which I sent you that we were unable to recognisethe authority of two [Chiefs] only and by the fact of the minutesthe whole Order had entered into abeyance as far as governmentwas concerned.

With regard to the properties [i.e. theVault etc.], they belong to us as much as they belong to theothers and we believe we can make use of them so thar we shallcertainly maintain our rights as regards them.He wrote to Brodie-Innes again on r8 November and this time wasmore explicit.The Independent Branch of the Order [i.e. \\Uaite's] will beprepared to enter into a concordar as originally proposed andagreed to by Frater F[inem] R[espice-Dr Felkin] prior to 4th2t42rtThe Stella MatutinaJuly, with the remaining members should these desire toreincorporate and thus pass out of their present position ofabeyance as far as government is concerned. Or alternativelywe shall be glad to receive and welcome any part of them whomay choose to join forces with us.In the three next paragraphs he rejected everything that was dearto Brodie Innes.The Third Order-the question of the original connectionwith the Third Order is a marter of opinion and exceptionis taken to any attempt to commit the Order bodily to anyparticular view.Revision of the Riruab-if there is a party within the Orderwhich has a preference for spurious archaisms with the worststyle of journalistic English there can be no doubt that such aparty has a right to follow its inclinations, though it is not aparty which enlists any educated sympathy, but we on our partdeshe the Riruals to be revised in accordance with good Englishand brought back as closely as possible to the original cyphermanuscript in order to shorten and improve the working.rProgress by examination-we affirm that there are no examinersand we object to the assumption of examining power by anotherparty.

In a letter to Brodie-Innes (r3 August l9o3) Waite stated his hope that Brodie-Inneswould 'feel personally in agreement with the course that has beentaken by those of us who view the order to some extent as an institu-tion which has arisen out of Freemczsonry and who desire to restore ilteconnections which once subsisted vrith it'. The connections, however,had been with the Soc. Ros. rather than conventional Craft Free-masonry and the significance of Waite's policy is obscure.lNo information is available for the years r9o4-t because there are nodocuments. In January r9o4, however, Dr Felkin received a letterfrom a Dr Studtmann, a physician at Hanover, that had a strangeaftermath. His German colleague, whose name was previouslyunknown to him, wrote about a female patient who had recentlybeen operated on for cancer of the breast. She had heard about DrFelkin's clover-tea tablets, which were not available in Germany,and supposed that they might help her. Dr Studtmann asked relkinto send a supply.In due course a letter arrived in London from Dr Studtmann,spatient who was none other than a Friiulein Anna Sprengel, who livedat Kokenstrasse 14 at Hanover. She mentioned (3 Februaty ryo4)that a Miss Mander and Friiulein Steinhoff, her cousin, had suggestedshe should write to Felkin about her illness and the clover-te. tubl.tr,which she was now taking. When Dr Felkin sac/ the signarure .AnnaSprengel' he supposed that he might miraculously be in touch with arelative of the original Fraulein Sprengel, Soror Sapiens DominabiturAstris.He v/rote to her in German by return of post on 6 February: ,Iwould be grateful if you could tell me something about your familyr vaite and Blackden both ioined thesoc.

Is it possible that thislady was a relative of yoursl'Friiulein Sprengel did not reply to his letter until 4 April r9o4.She informed him that the clover-tea tablets appeared to affect herdigestion adversely and then, in answer to his questions wrote:'The lady whom you knew was not a member of my family.'For some reason it has been traditionally supposed that the originalFriiulein Sprengel's first name was Anna, but no Christian name wasever mentioned in G.D. circles until c. rgr2. The confusion was dueto the fact that Felkin told a number of people that he had met SororS.D.A.'s niece, Friiulein Anna Sprengel. At that point Soror S.D.A.also became 'Anna Sprengel'.Dr Felkin wrote to the 'niece' and suggested that he should visither. She replied briefly on 3 June rgo4 to say that she would be awayfrom Hanover for a lengthy period and there the matter rested forthe time being.After lengthy negotiations which began during the spring of19o6, in April r9o7 Felkin signed a concordat which was intended togovern the relationship bet'ween his own and Waite's Temple. Thiswas at Brodie-Innes's instigation rather than his own desire. I do notknow when Felkin first called his branch of the Order the 'stellaMatutina' or when its Outer Order Templewas namedAmoun. Brodie-Innes was involved on Felkin's side and so, too, was Hugh Elliott('Nobis Est Victoria', N.E.V.). The latter was a partner in Rebman& Co., an obscure publishing firm whose offices were at rz9 Shaftes-bury Avenue. They published Brodie-Innes's novels Morag, the Sealand For the Soul of a Witch in r9o8-ro. Next to nothing is knownabout the membership of either Temple, but Marcus Worsley Blackden,Robert Palmer Thomas, Colonel Webber and Mrs Rand seem tohave been \\X/'aite's leading colleagues.While Brodie-Innes, who was a Theoricus Adeptus Minor, wasnotionally senior to Felkin, who had never taken the examinationsfor the Th.A.M. grade, he was prepared to acknowledge rhat Felkinwas Chief of Amoun Temple because he was in touch with the SecretChiefs. He wrote to Felkin on z4 April 19o6:'Of course I know you"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"The Stella Matutinaare and must be head of the Temple and the channel of communication[i.e. with the Third order] . . . my only wish is ro work under youand help the order in any way in my power.' Elliott was cancellaiusof Amoun. Brodie-Innes argued thaf he himself ought to be p\"a.-monstrator and Felkin Imperator. That was probably how it waseventually setded but one cannot be sure.Elliott was in favour of the concordat providing that no concessionswere made. He wrore to Felkin on z6 Apil ryo6:ve don't want their members working with us, and we certainlycan't confer on them any of our special knowledge . . . Thereare many points we must keep to ourselves, both,as to doctrine,instruction and working. Generally there is a sort of suggestion-that they would like to get the extra knowledge they tnTit *.may possess on their own terms and not ours.Felkin consulted the Secret chiefs by writing a reporr and thenreceiving their comments via his wifets or his own mediumshio.Automatic writing was probably the merhod used for getting *.rrug\"r.For instance on r7 November 19o6 Felkin asked a .,rugr-. gu\"rfonabout the original Isis-urania 'w'arrant, which was -now' in hispossession..Fekin: I have the old Warrant of Isis-Urania-but the G.H.Chiefs wrote to me that the Warrant was in what they termedautomatic script. I know of none such.The Seret Chtefs: Some parts of the Warrant and somesignatures were written by the G.H. Frater N.O.M. [Westcott]but were not as some have ignorantly stated forgeries. His handwas used according to a formula well known in ihe higherGrades and perfectly satisfactory to them. The Outer brder andthe Zelatores Adepti Minores have no concern with this varrant-nor should it have been shown to them. Trouble arose fromthis which was a mistake of p.p.C.r,.,s [Mathers].- Fellcin: They [i.e. 'Waite and Blackden] still hold the ideathat the 'G.D. Order' is the spiritual pari of Freemasonry andthat the 3 Chiefs mustbe Masons.The Seuet Chie{s: This is incorrect, but if they form aseparate l9*pt: the-re js nothing to prevenr their making a rulefor themse/ve.r that all three Chiefs mlst be Masons. It wouldonly apply to their Temple.\\\"rt)The Stella MatutinaThe Sun Masters, who were not the same as the Secret Chiefs,also imparted interesting information. Felkin was asking for highgrade rituals that did not exist for the very good reason that Mathershad not written them. Felkin was in touch with them on ChristmasDay ryo7.The Sun Masters say to F[inem] R[espice] in answer to hisrequest for the 6 : I and 7 : 4 Rituals:To G.H. Frater D.D.C.F. [Mathers], the former Chief ofthe Order, the general Ritual of 6 - y was given, but even henever had the Ritual of 7 :4. Though he was nominally ofthat Grade he had no power to advance beyond 6 : j, He wouldhave attained to the full grade of 7 - 4 and possessed theRitual and all its privileges had he continued the diligent andobedient student that he was at first . . . When thou hast reachedby labour and study the grade of 6 : y, the Ritual will beimparted to thee at once even as was that of 1 : 6.Felkin still felt that something was missing, namely a direct contactwith the successors of Soror S.D.A.'s German group which hadtraditionally been in touch with Westcott twenty years earlier. Hetherefore resolved to find them. He mentioned this decision in aStatement issued to his senior Adepts on r7 March r9r4.As is well known to one of you, for some years I was muchtroubled about the origins and genuineness of the Order StellaMatutina and R.R. et A.C. Circumstances arose in 19o6 whichled me to the conclusion that either I must find out the wholetruth of the matter or drop the whole of my connection with theOrders. From that time to the present I have used every effortand have spent a good deal of money, if so be, I could comeinto real contact with what we have been led to suppose was theThird Order. I have been able to do this to my own satisfacrion.The fact that members of the Third Order were assumed to existonly on the astral plane need not worry the reader. Felkin obviouslysupposed that he might find them in the flesh, and in Germany. So toGermany he went in 19o6 andfinally met a professor, his adopted daughter, and anothergentleman near Hanover, who he believed were undoubtedlyRosicrucians. They were, however, very secretive, and averse togiving much information, because they said that although they2tg"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"The Stella Matutinaknew him as a scientific man, he was not a Mason, nor did hebelong to any occult sociery that they had knowledge of.

At this point I must interrupt my account of DrFelkin's search for the Chiefs of the Third Order to deal with DrSteiner's pseudo-Masonic activities, because they have a connectionwith Felkin's subsequent adventures in Germany.The rite in question was that of Memphis and Misraim, of whichone Theodor Reuss was the Grand Master for Germany and Austria.lSteiner acquired his M. & M. warrant in the spring of ryo6 Accordingto Reuss's periodical Die Oriflamme (19o6, V, i, pp. 4-y):Brother Dr. Rudolf Steiner, 33\" , 9jo , of Berlin, and the Brothersand Sisters associated with him have been granted permissionto form a Chapter and Grand Council under the title .MysticaAeterna' in Berlin. Dr. Steiner has been appointed Deputy GrandMaster with jurisdiction over members already received or tobe received by him. Sister Marie von Sivers [later Steiner,s wife]has been appointed General Grand Secretary for the Lodges ofAdoption.The latter were Lodges in which both men and women were initiated.As far as I know the 'Mystica Aeterna' was the only Co-Masonic,i.e. 'mixed'Lodge, in Reuss's M. &. M. business.In his posthumous autobiography The Story of My Life, London,1928, Steiner went to great lengths to minimise his previous con-nection with Reuss & Co. 'I never thought in the remotest degree ofworking in the spirit of such a societyr' he wrote. And then: ;It hudthe form of Free Masonry of the so-called high degrees; but I tooknothing else-absolutely nothing-from this society **..pt the merelyformal authorisation, in historic succession, to direct -a symbolic-cultural activity.' The 'historic succession,, it should be noted, wasworthless. These protestations continue throughout three pages.Finally he claimed that 'this symbolic-cultural section of the anthro-posophical movement came to an end in the middle of r9r4.' It isr Pseudo-Masonic aberrations such as the Rite of Memphis and Misraim appear to befar less common today than before r9r4. For the most part they were the inventions ofcrackpots or adventurers. Reuss obtained his MemphiJ and Misraim charter in c. rgozfrom John Yarker, of Manchester, who was a harmless eccentric. yarker also sold orgave him a charter for the so-called swedenborg Rite, which was also unorthodox.At the time of his death in 1886 Kenneth Mackeniie was its Supreme Grand secretary.'Westcott, too, was one of Reuss's benefactors because he gave him permission ioestablish a Societas Rosicruciana in Germania in r9o:,."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"The Stella Matutinaclear, however, that Steiner's Memphis and Misraim connection, orwhatever deviation he had seen 6t to organise, was in full swing whenFelkin arrived on the scene in rgro.1It is evident that Felkin visited Steiner in Berlin or elsewhere inGermany in rgro and was greatly impressed by him. It is apparent,too, that he was convinced that Steiner represented something farmore important than the Theosophical Society, meaning that hesupposed that Steiner's Theosophical activities merely provided acamouflage for a far more esoteric group. In short, Steiner couldprovide the hitherto missing link with the historical German Rosi-crucian fraternity and therefore with the Secret Chiefs of the ThirdOrder. I do not suggest that Steiner tried to persuade Felkin that thiswas the case. By now the reader will have gathered that Felkin wascapable of believing almost anything.Since Felkin could not remain in Germany to receive whateverteachings that Steiner might have to offer, he decided to send a cerrainNeville Meakin as his representarive. Meakin, who lived at Ringwoodin Hampshire, was in his forties and must have had sufficient privatemeans for a lengthy absence from England. Before he departed theArab Teacher was consulted. On 7 November rgro Felkin asked:'Shall Shemseddin [i.e. Meakin] go to Berlin and is it advantageousto see Steinerl' The answer was \"'Yes\" (decidedly).''Waite was informed and offered his moral support. In Shadows ofLife and Thought he wrote: 'On the even of his departure I ionferredupon him the Grade of Adeptus Minor, acting as Adeptus Exemptusin Felkin's Stella Matutina Temple in Bassett Road. In this mannerhe carried with him the fullest Ritual advantage that was possible in hiscase at the time.'So Meakin went to Berlin. The length of his stay there is unknown.In rgrr he began a longer journey which was intended to repeatFather Christian Rosenkreuz's legendary travels in the Middle East.The purpose of this symbolical pilgrimage is obscure. Once again theArab Ara Ben Shemesh was consulted (5 July rgrr):'What aboutE[x] O[riente] L[ux-Meakin] going to Constantinoplel' The rnswerwas negative: 'A.B.S. does not want him to go. He says he is followingafter his own desires instead of the quest which was set before him.He ought to have gone to Damascus, but he cannot be driven . . .,A.B.S. referred to Meakin again on z6 November r9r r: 'shemseddinis misdirecting his forces by misdirected energies; his time has notr For a description of a ritual conducted by Steiner, see 'Ordensmeister RudolphSteiner'by Heinrich Goesch.iri the Berlin Yossische Zeitung, ry Septembeqrgzr.26426tThe Stella Matutinay€t come but he is attracting destructive forces insread of repellingthem and unless he ceases to do this he will die before his time, therebymissing the fulfilment of his destiny and vocation.' The Arab Teacher'sprophecy came true because Meakin died suddenly and unexpectedlyin c. rgrz.tDr Felkin and his wife proposed to visit Germany again in r9rz.The Arab Teacher expressed his approval on rz May: ,Have nothingto do with Mathers. Go on with Steiner which is the ultimate end olsearch. We will come into contact with many serious students whowill lead us to the real Masters of our Order who will be so over-poweringly impressive as to leave no room for doubt.'Brodie-Innes was becoming increasingly sceptical about Felkin'sGerman connections and told him so on rr June r9rz, probably justbefore the Felkins left for Germany. Felkin wrote to him the same day.I have come ro the conclusion that we had better drop alldiscussion of German matters until such time as I can reply to themany points you raise.

The rituals not being in MS. form, they arememorised.lAccording to Miss Stoddart's 'Investigations' typescript, whenDr and Mrs Felkin returned from Germany he said that he and hiswife had been given grades equivalent to 8o - 3o and 7o - 40. H@was soaring to the heights of adeptship because even Mathers hadnever aspired to be more than To = 4o. 'F.R. also claims to havereceived from this German body authority to act as Head of the R.R.et A.C. in Great Britain . . . and was specially asked that he shouldgive English Soc. Ros. Masons every opportunity of linking withthem.' If this was true, then Steiner was hoping to infiltrate EnglishMasonry.zAccording to A. E. Waite, who had a long talk with Steiner yhenhe was in London in r9tz, Steiner confirmed that while in Germanythe Felkins had 'witnessed certain things-no matter what they were-of a ceremonial kind'. Waite inferred that Steiner was unwilling tocommit himself as far as Felkin was concerned.3 In any case I have theimpression that almost everything that Frater Finem Respice, wholived in a world of dreams, said about his German connecrions,represented fantasy rather than the trudr.It was at about this time that Brodie-Innes broke with Felkin andr See 'Inquire Within', Ligltt-bearers of Darkness, r9lo, p. 9 r.

Indeed, it is possible thai hehad had a foot in both camps for some time but without telling Felkin.The reason for the rift was his growing lack of enthusiasm for Felkin'snew German connections. When Felkin returned to London they hada long talk on z7 luly r9rz. He dictated a record of their discussionand sent a copy to Brodie-Innes.On 8 July rgrz S.S. [Brodie-Innes] wrote: 'f want to have atalk with you about MSS. and the two Orders. I feel sure thatyou and I working together can do big things, but it needsabsolute mutual understanding.'Having read that sentence to S.S., F.R. [Felkin] asked whathe meant, whereon S.S. replied that he considered that if theteaching of the [Sunl] Order, the R.R. et A.C. and the GoldenDawn, and any teaching which p.R. could get hold of, werepooled, it would be possible for him and F.R. to obtain solecontrol of the Scottish Temple, W'aite's Temple, the BerridgeTemple, and one or two others, and so form an exceedinglystrong occult group which would exercise great power in theworld.In order to do this it would be necessary for F.R. torecognise D.D.C.F. [Mathers] as head of the Rosicrucian Society,but he need not fear either any demand for money or anyinterference whatever in the working of the Temple.He went on to say that D.D.C.F. was the sole survivingfounder of the G.D. and R.R. et A.C. and that he was gettingnew and exceedingly powerful formulae from him and that hegot new typed ceremonies for the 6 : 5 and 7 : 4 grades.He expressed his full faith in D.D.C.F., althought he said hewas under no pledge to him and would throw him over tomorrowif he were sure he would gain more by doing so. S.S. said thathe did not want more power but to be in a position to do moregood to others.He then asked what F.R. could give him if he threw overD.D.C.F., to which F.R. replied that in the meantime he couldgive him nothing whatever, for although he confessed that hehad some new knowledge yet it was still unsystematised and agood deal of it in German.Substitute a public company for a magical society and Brodie-)"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"The Stella MarutinaInnes could have been discussing plans for throwing the chairmanoverboard.W'estcott was still afraid that Mathers would again publicly accusehim of forging the Frdulein Sprengel letters and q/rote to Felkin toask him to confirm that 'Anna Sprengel did write letters to Englandand give permission such as I said I had received'. It will be recalledthat Felkin had wanted to introduce him to Frdulein Anna Sprengel,his patient at Hanover, in r9lo. Felkin was willing to oblige and on 6September rgr2 swore an affidavit to the effect that he had been incommunication 'with a member of the said Anna Sprengel's familywho was a patient of mine from March to June r9o4 and again fromJune to July rgro'. He continued:I met this lady at the railway station at Hanover on 8 Julyrglo and together with my wife accompanied her to Kasten'sHotel. There I intended to introduce her to Dr. W'illiam W-ynn'W'estcott but was unable to do so because he could not come.Also on the same day I would have taken Dr. William Wynn-Westcott to call on two gentlemen who were living at Ddhrenwho were fully conversant with the correspondence and with allthe circumstances concerned therewith.Personal interviews with members of the Rosicrucian Orderon the Continent in rgro and rgrz had proved that Dr. William'W'ynn'Westcott was in correspondence with Anna Sprengeland had permission from her to form a Sociery of the said G.D.in England.None of my own German friends who are interested in thesematters has been able to identify a contemporary Rosicrucian Societyin Germany. And once again I believe that Felkin simply let hisimagination run away with him. Years later, on z6 January rgzr, theRev. F. N. Heazell ('Evocatus Paratus'), a member of the StellaMatutina, wrote to Miss Stoddart to tell her that Felkin's daughterhad told him that there were 'two people named Anna Sprengel andthat F.R. [Dr Felkin] made a serious mistake in this matter'. MissEthel Felkin might have been thinking of Friiulein Alice Sprengel,who had been close to Rudolf Steiner, but it is not yet time to introduceher into this thicket of Sprengels.On r; September rgrz Felkin wrote to W. B. Yeats and brieflymentioned the affidavit that he had sworn for Dr Westcott. yeatswas still a member of the Stella Matutina and sufficiently active to bepromoted to the senior Theoricus Adeptus Minor grade. His certificate,268269The Stella Matutinawhich appears to be dated ro January r9r2, was signed both byvestcott and Felkin. westcort declared that he had passed certainexaminations, but the dates were not included, which was unusual.A certificate of this kind would never have passed muster in, say,t89y. It had taken Yeats a long time to reach the Theoricu, gr\"d\"because, after all, he had been a member of the R.R. et A.C. forlloseon twenty years.Dr Felkin, his wife and daughter went to New Zealand in theautumn of rgrz and were away for about six months.

The latter, in her'Investigations' typescript, mentioned that she was 'quite ignorantThe Stella Matutinaas to their reason for being there'. However, she knew later and inLight-bearers of Darkness was able to publish an extract from amemorandum written by Dr Felkin on 9 June r9r8:From what I was told abroad I was under the impression . . .that a few, I was told rwELvE, were to be picked out of all theTemples to help C.R.C.

The ideathat they were actually going to be conducted to the 'Old Vault',i.e. Christian Rosenkreuz's tomb, was pure fantasy.Dr Felkin must have been so wrapped up in his Rosicruciandream-world that he ignored the writing on the wall: the Germanultimarum to Russia and France on 3 r July, the French generalmobilisation on r August and the German declaration of war onRussia that same day.

E.O.L. [i.e. Neville Meakin] met some of t]em whenhe went abroad on pilgrimage before passing beyond. Q.L.[Mrs Felkin] and myself have also met them at various times andreceived instructions and help (in r9o4, r9o9 and rgrz).These members form what has been known to us as the'Third'Order and it is their business to look after the various Templesand to give advice when required. Most of them live abroadin various countries but one lives in England and I have calledhim 'The Unknown' or 'Epopt', because for most of you hemust remain behind the veil.'We have been told by some of these that C.R.C. [ChristianRosenkreuz] himself expects to manifest again on the materialplane before very long. I do not know whether he will returnas an infant, or whether as sometimes happens he may assumea suitable body which has already reached maturity.Hitherto we have spoken loosely of Three Orders. Now it willbe possible to define a little more clearly the different Grades,since during the last three years we have received several of theHigher Grades, which we hope to pass on to those who areready for them before we leave you [i.e. for New Zealand].Dr Felkin related all the 'Orders', from the sixth to the secondinclusive, to the higher Sephiroth of the Tree of tife.Kether !o : r.

Even when he takes office it will be with theproviso that only a few of you shall be in personal communicationwith him and the general Members will not be told who he is.A contemporary document (rr November rgry) indicates the sizeof the Stella Matutina at this dme.

The first wasHermes No. z8 at Bristol. Its three Chiefs were all women: Mrs M.Mackenzie ('Magna Est Veritas'), Miss C. E. Hughes ('Lux Orta Est')276277All Ends in Confusionand Miss Ada Severs ('Benedicamus Deo').t The second new founda-tion was in London. Felkin wrote: 'There are some fifry or sixtymembers of the Temple which used to be ruled by W'aite, also anumber of members of the Anthroposophical Society who are seekingadmission. They are to form a Temple on their own, because theyhave been working on different lines to the Stella Matutina and wouldundoubtedly cause confusion in the Stella Matutina Temple.' TheChiefs were Peter Birchall ('Cephas'), Colonel Webber Smith ('NonSine Numine'), a veteran member of the old G.D., and 'Benedic AnimoMea Domino', whom I have not been able to identify. The thirdTemple was to be restricted to members of the Societas Rosicrucianain Anglia and to be known as The Secret College in London. ItsChiefs were Dr W. Hammond ('pro Rege et patria'), Dr CarnegieDickson ((Fortes Fortuna Juvat') and A. Cadbury Jones ('Faire SansDire'), who were to officiate respectively as Imperator, praemonstratorand Cancellarius.At this point the Felkin family left for New Zealand, the Doctorhappily in the possession of a paper signed by 'Westcott confirminghis appointment as Inspector of the Australasian Colleges of the Soc.Ros. The Arab Teacher continued to communicate with him, butearly in September r9r8, accoriling to Felkin: ''When A.B.S. came onSunday he told us that after six weeks we were to call him no more ashis work for us was done then, and he asked us to tell all who had beento his meetings in London not to callhim again.' However, there wereother and less welcome visitors.

Collison,who had joined the Order with a watching brief from Steiner but hadnow resigned, explained Steiner's attitude in a letter written to anunidentified Frater on 8 May r9zr. This document suggests that hehad never taken either Felkin or the Stella Matutina very seriously.The following is what I gathered from an interview with Dr.Steiner in Holland last March.r. Dr. Felkin was a spectator at one of Dr. Steiner's ceremoniesin Munich several years ago. No grades have been given to himby Dr. Steiner. No grades were given to him in Munich. But Dr.Steiner gave Dr. Felkin a great deal of instmction, such as hegives to other people who desire it.z. Several visits have been paid by various enquirers tocastles and other places in Austro-Hungary, but there has neverbeen any true or practical result from these researches.3. Dr. Felkin was anxious to get a charter from Dr. Steinerand made many attempts to gain this and be appointed his solerepresentative in England . . . Dr. Steiner said that he was unableto grant this request.4. Dr. Steiner cannot say that the forces in the Order are goodor bad, but in all spiritualistic practices under the old formof clairvoyance which is resorted to in the Felkin Order,self-deception is very possible and forces may enter which arebeyond the power or understanding of those physically present.5. The Order is decorative and useful to those who nied itand are able to distinguish berween mere ornament and reality.Miss Stoddart was still trying to get to the bottom of the .AnnaSprengel' mystery. If this could only be solved, then a lot else mightbecome clear. There must have been some corresponden.. withW. B. Yeats, because it was he who suggested that she should writeto Edouard Schur6, the author of the well-known book Les grandsinitids, r889.t 11uo'ing received fwo letters from her and one fromr Edouard Schurd (r84r-r9r9) had known Steiner well but broke with him in 1916.See C. Schneide4 Edouard Schurds Begegnung mit SteinerrBasle, 1913.z8oz8rAII Ends in ConfusionH. Collison, he eventually replied to Mr Landrieux on 8 August rgzrand now they learned of the existence of yet another Friiulein Sprengel.Schurd wrote:I have never heard of Miss Anna Sprengel, supposed to havedied in 1893. I have known a certain Mlle Sprengel, who wasa member of the Anthroposophical Society of Dr. Steiner andwho performed as Persephone in my drama Eleusis berweenr9o8 and tgr2ra drama which was performed by this societyunder the direction of Dr. Steiner, and later as Theodora (aclairvoyante) in a mystic drama by the same Doctor. I heardlater that this person (who had a theatrical talent of no meanorder) had left the Society at the time Dr. Steiner married Mllede Sivers [24 December ryt4] because they said Mlle Sprengelwas hoping, so it was said, to marry the Doctor. Those are taleswithout interest and it seems to me doubtful that this MlleSprengel had any connection with the one you mention whowould be the moving spirit of a new occult order. Neither doI know Dr. Felkin.There is no evidence that Dr Felkin ever met this particularFriiulein Sprengel, whose first name was Alice. I shall deal brieflywith her in order to elucidate the last of the Sprengels who flit in andout of the Golden Dawn saga.Steiner wrote four mystical dramas between rgrc-tt. The firstwas Die Pforte der Einweikng, which was described as a 'RosicrucianMystery', in which Alice Sprengel played the role of Theodora.It was performed at Munich at the Theater am Girtnerplau on r yAugust rgro between ro a.m. and y p.m. with one interval that lastedscarcely an hour.rPastor M. Kully, of Basle-Arlesheim, who published two booksattacking Steiner and his teachings during the early r9zos, identifiedher as being a member of the Doctor's 'Inner Group' and, furthermore,of German-British parentage.2 Gregor Schwarz-Bostunitsch alsomentioned her, although not by name, in his anti-Steiner polemic.rIn ry17 Mr Gerald Yorke asked Dr Heinrich Wendt, a criminalr See Max Gtimbel-Seiling, Mit Rudolf Stciner in Miinchen, The Hague, t946, pp.6z-3.z See M.

As might be expected, br wendt could irovicreno information about the original Anna Sprengel. However, he wroteto Mr Yorke about Alice Sprengel:Alice Sprengel (b. z8 September rg7r, d. Bern, Swirzerland,1949) was the illegitimate child of a nobleman and the daughterof a Lutheran pastor from pomerania. To avoid a scandal ilemother went to Scotland and the child was born there. In heryouth she lived at South Shields in yorkshire. She thenreturned to Berlin. There she was acrive in Theosophical circlesand became acquainted with nudolph Steiner.She had probably been a member of Steiner's Mystica AeternaLodge (see p. t6l). In anyTheodor Reuss's secretary andIn the meantime Miss Stoddart industriously continued herresearches. on I April rgzz she wrote to Dr Hammond and told himthat she had come to the conclusion that 'the history of the orderconsists of a-long series,of mystifications, the one following andoverlapping the other'. These ,mystifications,, she proposed, i.g\"r,wi-th the Cypher MS. and the Anna Sprengei letters. Then, in Ihefollowing order, she referred to .the -Hidlen and Secrer 'Chi.fr,,'C.R.C. in the Vault', the alleged contact with the Third Ordeithrough the Sun Masters, the Aiab reactrer Ara Ben Shemesh, theLord of Light and the Tbelve Brethren and finally Dr Feli<in'ssupposed Continental authority.- 'A curious fact isr' she wrote, .that from the day I first examinedthe order papers at the end of ryr9 and all this timewhile I have beentrying to get evidence, the opposition of these evil forces has at timesbeen ffemendous, and it is always greatest when dearing with the SunMasters'papers and Ara Ben Shemesh,s . . .'The first version of her .Investigations' typescript was ready byr According to Dr Wendt she was at Ascona with Reuss in r9r7.

On thesame day she compiled a list of rhe names and addresses of the forty-five people who were members of the Stella Matutina's Second Order.W'ith the exception of W'. B. Yeats, who was described as ,Imperator,,presumably of the Amoun Temple, and Miss Kate Moffatt (,ServioLiberaliter'), of ndinburgh, there were no other survivors of theOrder's great days during the r89os.Latterly the Stella Matutina's Amoun Temple had been at MissStoddart's home at 56 Redcliffe Gardens in the Earls Court district.On z5 March r9z3 she wrote ro an unidentified Frater from herbrother's home in Essex: 'At last I am free from No. 56! Never againfo1 me! It is very nice out here and it is a great relief to have goiridof that awful incubus-house and Order.' In the meantime the papersnow in the 'Privare Collection' had been handed to a colleaguJ forsafe-keeping.W. B. Yeats probably left the Stella Matutina at this time. In theNotes at the end of Autobiograpl*er he mentioned that his connectionwith the Order'ended amid quarrels caused by men, otherwise worthy,who claimed a Rosicrucian sanction for their fantasies'. He was carefulto add that to prevent needless correspondence he was no longer amember of any 'Cabbalistic Society'.At this point this chronicle can be brought to a close. An accountof the post-r923 Temples which continued to keep the Golden Dawntradition more or less alive will be found in Mr Francis King's RitualMagic in England, and I have nothing to add to his story.Mathers died in France on zo November r9r8. It is extraordinaryhow little is known of his life after r9oo. According to yeats duringthe First World War he turned his house into a recruiting office andraised six hundred volunteers for the Foreign Legion.Westcott spent his last years at Durban where he was Vice-presidentof two Theosophical Society Lodges. He continued to correspond withGardner, who was busy examining his horoscope for portents of hisown imminent death. Westcott had to reassure him twice during thesummer of rgzz:'I do not feel in the Astral Light that you are likelyto end for some years yet', and 'I do nor see any fatal issue for a longwhile, but likely an illness . . . I see you alive this time r.*r y\"ur,lhe wrote.A year before W'estcott died on 3o June l9z5 he informed Gardnerthat no further contact with the Secret Chiefs of the Third or anyother Order could be expected for the time being: 'I see no reason tothink that any supra-normal beings or Masters have divulged any"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"All Ends in Confusionsecret knowledge for the last ten years at least . . .

Aleister crowley recalled tihis meetingin a letter written to Gerald yorke on y December rg4r.In June'zy [I was] invited to the H.e. of one of the SecretBrotherhoods in Germany . . . the secret heads of otherbodies joined us.

Asmight be expected they had no dificulty in adding to the G.D.mythology, e.g. by stating that Bram Stoker, the author of Dracula,and Sax Rohmer, the creator of the 'Dr Fu Manchu' mystery storieswhich were popular during the r9zos, were both in the Order. Theywere on safir ground when discussing the writer Arthur Machenismembership,l but blundered badly when they recorded that W.
