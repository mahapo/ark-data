From the moment I picked up those volumes I felt as if I hadcome home to an old friend.For many years my wife Chris and I struggled with the Golden Dawn system to a level wheresome of it actually started to make sense. Eventually a group of us started to practice the Ritualsand study the associated Knowledge Lectures. It was at this point that we realised the publishedvolumes left out a great deal of information; not only on physical ritual turns and pivots, but alsowhat was happening during the rituals themselves, the internal changes on the subtle anatomy. Asfar as the Knowledge Lectures were concerned, we found them barely more than adequate.Having worked the Rituals up to the Grade of 5 = 6, by luck or coincidence, we found outthere had been a Golden Dawn Order in New Zealand since 1912. The Order was not called theGolden Dawn but the Smaragdum Thalasses (Emerald of the Seas), and the Temple was the WhareRa. It was located in Havelock North, Hawkes' Bay, New Zealand.Through contacts of Chris, who came from that general area, a few names and addressessuddenly became available to us. I had sent three letters to former members (including an ex-Chief)and two of the replies told me that the Order had just closed its doors. But then, I received a veryextraordinary letter from a very extraordinary person whom I had never heard of. Apparently oneof the individuals I had written, passed my letter on to Jack Taylor who responded very quickly. AsI had later found out, Taylor was a person of remarkable clairvoyant gifts and a powerfulpersonality in his own right. He told us that he was told by 'them' that we were expected, andwould see him in the next few days. The letter really surprised us for we had just booked a flight tothe Havelock North area, and were to arrive the next day, something Taylor could not have knownabout by any normal means.The afternoon of the following day we were introduced to Taylor and a roomful of people.They all were ex-members of the Whare Ra, and if I remember correctly, all were Inner Ordermembers. To the surprise of all, Taylor waved away the oath of secrecy, and said he was toldclairvoyantly that we had been sent to do a job and were to be given as much support as possible.Taylor, as we found out, was an ex-Ifierophant of the Whare Ra and had reached the rank ofAdeptus Exemptus, 7 = 4. He was also head of an Arthurian side order called the Order of theTable Round, which still had the bulk of the ex-Whare Ra members practicing ritual magic together.After that initial meeting, Taylor decided we had to be trained in the ritual and esotericteachings of the Golden Dawn. He and others began to teach us the rituals at levels that at firstwere quite beyond us. Chris and I had to forget everything we had learned beforehand and startedfrom scratch2. Taylor took us through the Grades and when he felt that we were at a point wherewe could teach properly he chartered our (existing) Temple. In fact, he became one of its Chiefs.Taylor decided that the Chiefs ceased to be Chiefs when they closed down the Whare Ra. Havingbeen in the Order since 1930, a Hierophant and had of the rank of Adeptus Exemptus, he had asmuch right as anyone to charter a Temple. From him and others, such as Percy Wilkinson (whoreached the 6 = 5 rank3), we also received the additional documentation of the Whare Ra and foundthe rituals were far more complete than those published by Regardie. While some of thedocumentation was adequate, the major part of our teaching was concerning ritual. We both feltvery fortunate to train under Taylor, and by analogy I felt like Carlos Castaneda before me, and hadfound my Don Juan.I have read the works of both Francis King and Regardie with references of the StellaMatutina being not up to the standard of the Golden Dawn, and found just the opposite from theex-Whare Ra members. To be fair to King and Regardie, neither had any real contact with the2"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"members of the New Zealand Order, and they possibly based their assumptions on those membersthey had met from the Bristol Temple. What we found was, that the Rituals used in the NewZealand Order, were the same ones used in the Golden Dawn, and not the watered down versionsthat Regardie first published through Aries Press. Any changes that were done to the Rituals in theBristol Temple did not happen out here in New Zealand.A number of historians have labelled the Whare Ra Temple as a temple of the Stella Matutina.This is unfortunate and inaccurate to a certain extent, for the Whare Ra withdrew from the StellaMatutina in 1933 and for the greater part of its life, until 1978, was not connected with the StellaMatutina. I have also heard mentioned from some historians that the Whare Ra threw out itsGolden Dawn direction for some fringe form of Christianity. If this was the case, then no one Iknow from the Whare Ra remembers it. What did happen was that the area surrounding the WhareRa was so huge, it had to be split up into various sections with Daemonstrators or teachers for eachsection. There was one instance where a Daemonstrator tried to shove on to new corners hisparticular brand of Christianity, and bring it into the Grade teachings. In this particular instance,Taylor heard about it and had this particular gentleman (an ex-Hierophant of the rank of 7 = 4)sacked from his teaching post. This was only one isolate instance, and did not reflect the teachingsof the other Daemonstrators.Unfortunately mud sticks, and the comments made about the Stella Matutina by some authorsas being something lesser than the Golden Dawn may apply to some temples in England, but Iwould be confident in saying not in New Zealand. The only difference between the Golden Dawn,Stella Matutina and Alpha et Omega temples would be that in the latter cake, more documentationfor the higher Grades was available, though this did not make any of them better at ritual magicthan their counterparts. To quote the late Bruce Lee: \"It is not the knowing but the doing\" and atthe Whare Ra that was very much the case; for ritual magic is 'the doing'. The New Zealandersexcelled at ritual work. There were those at the Whare Ra who rigidly adhered to the practicalritual only and others, like Taylor, who with his unusual clairvoyant capabilities worked both thepractical and the spiritual together4.Like many others before us, we had been through the experience of trying to run a temple anddo the rituals from Regardie's books alone. We also had the good fortune to be trained in them byTaylor and others with additional information given to us 'by word of mouth' which far outstrippedthe published documents. Taylor was forever amused at our incessant note taking, but we knew wehad a once in a life time chance to learn Ritual under people, some of whom like Taylor had beendoing the Golden Dawn rituals long before Regardie had joined the Bristol Temple in England. Therituals done with correct instruction could not even be compared with the amateur attempts we firstmade all those years ago.In 1981 I received a set of documents called 'The Processes'5 from Wilkinson who made thecomment he really knew nothing about them. Taylor also had little to do with them. I then wroteto Regardie to ask him if he had ever heard of these papers in connection with the Bristol Temple(which he did not). That initial letter opened the door to many letters between Regardie andmyself; and a firm friendship was built up over the next year and half. In August of 1983, Regardiecame to meet with us in New Zealand. I was quite surprised to find out that Regardie knew veryfew people, if any from his Bristol days. He mentioned that he was taken rapidly through theRituals, and his communications were with the then Chiefs. He had no social contact with othermembers of the Temple, except when he consecrated his elemental weapons. He admitted he hadnever taken part in ritual instruction, and the only rituals he attended were his own GradeInitiations. I mention all this not out of disrespect for Regardie, a person whom I greatly admire,but to try and place the comments he made about the Stella Matutina in some sort of perspective.He told us during that visit, that he was bringing out a new book6 on the Rituals, which werebased on the Golden Dawn papers of F.L. Gardner. It turned out that the full Rituals of the GoldenDawn (which were identical to our Whare Ra ones) did plug up a few holes that were left in his firstpublication, but it still did not go far enough. I mentioned some of the short comings to Regardie3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"when the book came out. He knew all this and was not happy with his new edition. Also during hisNew Zealand visit, Regardie was given a honorary 6 = 5 grade' in our Temple in appreciation forhis many years of devoted service to the Golden Dawn.For those of you who are wondering why I have written this book when the Regardie booksappear to cover the same ground, the following list of documentation that appears in this volumedoes not appear in either edition of the Regarthe Ritual books:(1)This book gives a commentary on each ritual up to the 5 = 6 level.(2)All ritual diagrams are included along with their positions in the Hall.(3)Explanations are given separately for each diagram so that its inner meanings canbe easily understood.(4)Included are the Godform drawings and colouring instructions, as well as theirplacements.(5) The energy patterns formed on the Temple floor by the magical currents of theAdmission Badges of each Grade.(4) The magical meanings of the Officers Wands used in the Outer Order, Portal andAdeptus Minor Grades, as well as the symbology of their Lamens.(7)The additional colouring of the Pastos using the four colour scales.(8)The first hand experiences of temple officers from the Whare Ra Temple who hadproblems in the ritual's and how they overcame them.(9)The introduction of the student to each Grade and the meaning behind them.(10)Additic;nal study papers for each Grade from both the early Golden Dawn andWhare Temples, including Waite's Golden Dawn rituals.(11) A History of the Golden Dawn from its inception until today8.The backbone of this current book are the ritual commentaries which were written and-collected over a number of years for the Thoth Hermes Temple members. We originally started toput most of this 'word of mouth' teaching in a form of commentary on the rituals and gave them toour Temple members so they could understand what was happening on the different levels whenthey went through a Golden Dawn ritual. The commentaries started to build on the skeleton formatI had originally draughted up. It appeared that every time Chris or I question a point on ritual,more information and stories started being relayed to us by ex-Whare Ra members, which amplifiedcertain pertinent points raised by us.After the Regardie's Falcon Press edition of the Rituals was published, I decided to publishwhat we had here in New Zealand, and over the next few years I started to bring these ritualcommentaries9 into book form. I wanted to give as much information on the actions of the ritualsthat we had learned, the results being the book you now hold in you hand. Due to the expansivenature of our Golden Dawn work, Chris and I found the material too massive to put it entirely inone book, so we settled in this instance for the rituals, commentaries and associated documentation.Separate books on subjects such as Enochian Chess, The Equinox and Solstice Rituals°, The-Golden Dawn Tarot, General Enochiana, the Z2 rituals, and Meditative techniques for theElemental Grades have either already been published, or will be available in the future. I have onlyincluded the rituals up to the 5 = 61k. A future volume will be made available for the rituals and-teachings of the higher Grades in due course.The publication of this expanded ritual material in this book now prevents many of those whohave this knowledge, from sitting on it, when they should be doing more to help those who need it.-Merely being the possessor of such knowledge does not give one the right to pontificate to others.I had seen the result of this type of temple managing from some ex-Whare Ra members, and I feel itis to be avoided at all cost. If any of you who wish to start their own temples, I hope the full ritualsand commentaries will be a guide for you where practical instruction from a senior is impossible.The information contained here on ritual was the result of many collective efforts by people with a4"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"great deal of Golden Dawn ritual training from the old Whare Ra Temple, plus our own meagerefforts in Thoth Hermes. There are also hints and directions in this book for those of a morestudious nature to advance even further as it is far from being complete by any stretch of theimagination, but it is a solid foundation from which others in the future can work from.Finally I would like to thank a number of people to whom I owe a great debt, for withoutthem this book would never have been published. To Laura Jennings-Yorke, and her husbandPeter, who kept pushing me to get this book completed; David Stoelk for editing the first draft ofthe manuscript; and to Richard Dudschus, Jonathan Pierce and David Stoelk who did the art workand had to redraw many of the terribly sketched ritual diagrams from the Whare Ra Temple. ToTony F. for his advice and help over the years and who put me straight on a number of issues whenI was in the dark. To Connel T. and Tony H. for their unwavering support and advice since dayone. To my late Friends of Whare Ra - my teacher Jack Taylor, Percy Wilkinson, Babs and IanNairn, Alison and others whose names would not wished to be mentioned. Also a great debt toFrancis IsraelRegardie who actively pushed me to publish. Most important of all, my beautiful wifeChris who put up with me when I was going through the maelstrom of writing this book over thelast few years (when many of those around me thought I was possessed , and who understands melike no other). •Pat ZalewskiWellington, New Zealan' d1994"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Introduction to the Z5The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn is the foundation stone underlying virtually everyOccult organisation of the Twentieth century. Its achievement was the combination of HebrewMysticism with the works of some of the world's greatest Philosophers and Occultists, into aworkable format that could be used by an aspiring magician. This format was then overlaid withRosicrucian theology to direct its aims.When writing about'the history of the Order of the Golden Dawn, the most difficult task thatan author faces is to present it simply, while explaining the complexities of its philosophy to thepublic. In the late 1930's, Regardie, tried to do this when he published his book My Rosicrucian-Adventure, which was intended as an introduction to his major work on the rituals and teachings,The Golden Dawn, that he published some years later.With Regardie's latter publication, the vast system of philosophy and magic was madeavailable to those who wanted to study esoteric subjects. From that time, when the teachings of theGolden Dawn were revealed for all to see, the start of a magical revival began. There are very fewOrders today that do not owe some form of their teachings to the Golden Dawn, and much of thatobligation comes from Regardie's published compilation of Golden Dawn material.Volume One of this book is an introduction or overview of the history of the Golden Dawnand its teachings. Volumes Three and Four examine the meanings of the rituals and teachings at a-deeper level. Included in these volumes will be a great deal of unpublished teaching which welearned from the members of the Whare Ra Temple, the last of the main Temples to survive. Todate, several other books12 have been written, covering such subjects as the Golden Dawn Tarot,the Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn, Advanced Enochian Magic, Enochian Chess, Equinox andSolstice Ritual Commentaries. They contain teachings up to the highest level of the Order and will• introduce to the reader, ritual magic, and its allied philosophies and thought. Apart from the bookswritten by Chris and I on the Golden Dawn, there are books being written here in New Zealand byother authors which also cover the teachings of the Order and its personalities, which fit in with ourown series.Within the Golden Dawn were all manner of people from the devout Christian, to Ministers ofReligion and even the occasional atheist. Everyone worked together in the form of an Order, of thelike the world has never seen since ancient times. The Golden Dawn teachings have been copied bymany and transformed by some, but none have ever quite managed to duplicate the major effect theOrder has had on today's modern thought on esoteric subjects, whether it be Astrology, Divinationor Astral Projection.When Regardie published the rituals and papers of the Golden Dawn, which he obtained fromthe Hermes Temple in Bristol, there were a number of large sections missing in the rituals whichthat Temple decided to prune from the originals. The rituals and diagrams presented in thesevolumes will be from .the Whare Ra Temple in New Zealand (which closed in 1978 after beingfounded in 1912) and are more detailed. Full explanatory information on the rituals and related-subjects is given and will be combined with diagrams, a number of which have not been publishedbefore. One of the most interesting books to come out by us will be The Golden Dawn Tarotwhich gives full explanations for each card plus some rewritten material on the Star Maps. Another-book which will be of interest, is the biography of a former head of the Order, Dr. Robert W.Felkin, meticulously researched for over ten years by Connel Townsend and which sheds new lighthistory of the Order, through Felkin's diary notes. An entertaining publication is Enochian Chessof the Golden Dawn, written by Chris, who has done the first definitive work on the subject. What Ihave just mentioned along with this book and it's volumes together with books to come are a seriesof works which should prove exciting, both for Golden Dawn historians and for those who wonderexactly what it is. We are bringing more and hitherto unpublished information that this secret"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Hermetic Order utilised from the time of its inception to the present day.The first volume of this book is quite different from Regardie's My Rosicrucian Adventure(subsequently retitled What you should know about the Golden Dawn) which was written more forthe experienced occultist than for the general public. This volume also differs from Ellie Howe'sexcellent book, Magicians of the Golden Dawn and also the works of Bob Gilbert and IthellColquhoun who have written on Golden Dawn history. Our own contribution, we feel, containsmore information on the Order and caters more for the general public than does Regardie's originalbook. Regardie's book is valuable nevertheless and compliments the material covered in mine.The Golden Dawn was the outer shell for an inner Rosicrucian Order, and to explain whatthat means we have included the two original early 17th century Rosicrucian publications (whichare today quite hard to obtain). From the Rosicrucian philosophy, sprung a magical and mysticaltradition that is almost 400 years old and is still being practiced today.In the past most Occult historians have concentrated on the Golden Dawn in England andhave totally ignored the history of the Golden Dawn in America, which was every bit as prolific asits English cousin. In my first book, The Secret Inner Order Rituals of the Golden Dawn, I openlyasked someone who had access to this material to publish it. Little did I know that I would be thefirst to do so' and the reason for this rests solely on Paul Clark who has generously given us accessto his material which is included in Appendix One.7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Roots of the Golden DawnTo fully understand the formation and structure of the Golden Dawn it is necessary to goback to its embryo state and to do that we must look at the S.R.I.A\" (Societas Rosicrucians inAnglia). This society was formed in England in 1867 by a small group of Masons\" who decidedthey wanted to continue their study in the Rosicrucian philosophy. Ritual was very important to allof them and the esoteric science of Masonry though cryptic and steeped in mystical tradition,apparently did not go far enough for them. By the mid 1800's in England many of the Kabbalisticassociations in Masonry had been discontinued and thus much of this side of Masonry had ceased toexist. No doubt those serious Masonic students of the Kabbalah, such as Robert Little and hisfriends, decided they wanted to return to that particular flavour of ritual but with someconcentration on the Rosicrucian legends. In order to preserve the secrecy and tradition of thelegendary Rosicrucian Order, only master masons of the third degree or higher could be admitted tothis fledgling society.While the concept of mystical societies was not new to England at that time (or any other)this little society began its first connection with the Golden Dawn in the form of the rituals itoperated. The rituals which the SRIA worked became the backbone from which the Golden Dawnrituals were founded. The grade structure ,of the SRIA was in fact 9 Degrees:(1)Zelator(2)Theoricus(3)Practicus(4)Philosphus(5)Adeptus Minor(6)Adeptus major(7)Adeptus Exemptus(8)Magister Templi(9) MagusThe rituals in this society are extremely simple and consist of a circumambulation around theroom where the candidate is stopped by members who are called the Four Ancients\". Each of theserepresents the four fixed signs of the Zodiac16. The candidate would carry in an Admission Badgesuch as a. cross or similar object. What has never been discussed in print before is the connection ofthese S.R.I.A. admission badges with those found in the Golden Dawn rituals, for they are identical.The main form of study in the SRIA apart from the occasional spoken lectures, consisted of aseries of papers written by various members on all manner of subjects. Though the contents couldhardly be called occult in origin they still, for the most part, went a lot further than the masonicteachings and built yet another further span in the bridge between masonry and occultism.Although a number of papers were printed for the SRIA, their basic documents, as in all otherRosicrucian Societies, are the 'Fama'\" and the 'Confessio'\" for these are the cornerstones onwhich all later Rosicrucian Societies were formed;'.The Rosicrucian Philosophy is an allegory on the mythical life of Christian Rosenkreutz andnotes how one should behave by modelling his or her life on the simple rules Rosenkreutz laid downfor his Fraternity. Many have also thought that the publication of the Rosicrucian Manifestos thatsparked off Masonry, some years later and which in its early days did appear to follow theRosicrucian ideals to a great extent.Within this nucleus of the SRIA there are three personalities which merit our attention,William Robert Woodman, William Wyn Westcott and S. L. Mathers, for these were to be the firstThree Chiefs of the Golden Dawn. Both Woodman and Westcott had reached the level of Supreme8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Magus in the SRIA by the later 1870's which made them the two most highest ranked members ofthat Order. Oral tradition tells us that Westcott then approached a hard working younger memberof the SRIA, one S.L.Mathers20, to assist him to put some meat on the bare bones of some cypherrituals\" he had discovered and his brief was also to add the Knowledge Lectures that went withthem.These cyphers have been a bone of contention since Effic Howe claimed that they wereforgec122. Howe goes to great pains to attempt to show that origins of the cyphers were concoctedby Westcott to validate his claim to inherit the Chieftainship of the Golden Dawn. The drawings inthe cyphers, however, show a number of the SRIA Admission Badges. After studying the SRIArituals, I do not suggest that the cyphers were the basis for their rituals so I must come to theconclusion that the cyphers were created by someone in the SRIA, though not necessarily Westcott.The main points of consideration regarding these cypher manuscripts that Westcott gaveMathers to decipher and expand to something workable are :(1)The cyphers were written in an alphabet utilised by the Monk, Trithemius, aspublished in his book the Polygraphia of Trithemius'.(2)Along with each section of the ritual there were certain tabulations which Mathersreworked into the Golden Dawn Knowledge Lectures covering the Kabbalah andAlchemy as well as drawings from Rosenroth's `Kabbalah Denudata'23.(3)An address was received with the cyphers asking anyone able to translate them toget in touch with a certain S.D.A24. This turned out to an elderly German Adept whoallegedly corresponded with Westcott and gave him, as well as any other two peoplehe cared to nominate, a very high grade which would qualify them to be Chiefs of anOrder called the 'Golden Dawn'.(4)Ellic Howe, in his 'Magicians of the Golden Dawn' proved conclusively that theletters from S.D.A in Germany were in fact forgeries\", possibly done by Westcottto give some validation to his claims of having a very high rank in the fledglingorganisation.(5)A number of years ago I was acquainted by a spiritualist who knew nothing of myGolden Dawn interest. I put it to her to ask her esoteric contacts a question as to theorigination of the Golden. Dawn cypher manuscripts. She knew nothing of theGolden Dawn or its history and approached me a week later with one word that wasconstantly repeated to her while in the circle and that was llockley'. FrederickHockley26 was an SRIA member who died in 1885, and had a good knowledge ofGerman and had received, according to Ellie Howe, a German Initiation of sorts.(6)The use of a number of S.RI.A symbols shows that the person who draughted thecyphers would have done so after 1867, unless these symbols were taken frompapers of a yet more previous Rosicrucian Order, and thatmembersinherited. If this was the case the name of a certain Dr. Falk may have beenconnected with them.(7) The insertion of the Enochian Tablets into the cyphers was very crudely andhaphazardly done by Westcott (in his handwriting) which is not like any other of theoriginal sheets so for this reason I do not believe that Westcott concocted them.Though the Enochian names are imbedded in the cyphers proper.At this point I can only concur with Ellie Howe that Westcott forged a number of letters butdo not think he forged the cyphers. My good friend and colleague, Israel Regardie\", gave ascathing attack on Howe for his findings. Regardie observed that to say that the Golden Dawn wasbased on a confidence trick would be like the Christian Churches finding that Jesus Christ wasnever Crucified. Most researchers would also come to hold the same opinion as Howe if they hadaccess to the papers he did. To throw up ones hands and say the Golden Dawn is nothing but a9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"fraud is mistaken in the occult context for this forgery is really unimportant - for it is the effect andnot the cause that concerns us in this instance.We must now examine the work of Mathers on the cyphers, for by accident or divine plan, hewas able to impart a structurally well balanced system, which is possibly the best all round occultsystem yet devised that went further than either the originator of the cyphers or Westcott had everconsidered.The full effect of what Mathers actually created is just starting to come to the occult fraternitytoday which can only marvel at its genius. From this very shaky start the Order of the Golden Dawnwas born. The Golden Dawn was however, only the name for the First Order on which the cyphermanuscripts were based. The real participation with ritual magic on an individual basis came with aSecond Order which is barely mentioned in the Outer Order rituals. Apart from the five cypherrituals Mathers also introduced another in the form of the Equinox ceremony.Far too often I have felt that when people study the Golden Dawn's study curriculum theyapproach it from merely a scholastic viewpoint, equating knowledge with occult attainment. As anoccultist who has worked with the Golden Dawn system for many years I feel far too little has beensaid of the immense psychological value gained from participating in and experiencing the rituals,which in the writers opinion, are every bit as necessary to the study program.The Kabbalah and RitualRitual magic, as Mathers envisioned It is far more than going through dramatic gestures.Magic brings down and utilises a certain magnetic quality that the ritual is designed for. The effecton the psyche, if this is correctly done, is enormous. To encompass these rituals he developed,Mathers utilised the structure and methodology of the Hebrew Kabbalah, a secret Doctrine ofcertain sects of the Jews. Mathers had just completed a translation of excerpts of the Kabbalah fromthe Zohar and this impressive piece of work showed that by the time he embellished the cypher• manuscripts he was extremely knowledgeable about even some of the more obscure knowledge ofthe Kabbalah. Such knowledge was acquired by spending just about every day, all day, at theBritish Museum doing research. Apart from this he also published a book called Key of Solomonthe King, an ancient Grimoire that was said to have been written by Solomon himself. This textfirmly placed Mathers as a practising magician using methods of Evocation. Oral tradition had itthat he taught himself, Latin, French, German and was reasonably familiar with the meanings ofEgyptian Hieroglyphics and some Greek. He had also published a small book on the tarot, someyears earlier.To understand the framework of the Golden Dawn some discussion of the Kabbalah29 isneeded.The teachings of the Kabbalah are based on additional Jewish sectarian commentaries of theBible. Some of the important Kabbalistic Books of the first 6 centuries A.D. are the Bahir39, theSepher Yetzirah31, and Schemphamphoresch which enunciates on the 72 angelic names. Around the13th century, a great body of Kabbalistic literature called the Zohar was published, though traditiontells us that this work, in part, was many hundreds of years old32.The first point of consideration of Kabbalistic doctrine is the Hebrew Alphabet and itsnumerical and astrological considerations. All those joining the Golden Dawn had to commit this tomemory. Along these lines and by way of analogy, Mathers constructed a series of tables whichformed the major part of a book called General Correspondences'''. The Hebrew Alphabet was alsoused as a form of meditation as well and M.athers took it to a level that even outstripped themetaphysical concepts of the Zohar.The numerological side of the letters of the Hebrew Alphabet was considered to be part of theLiteral ICabbalah and is studied in three major divisions34:(1) Gematria35 was a mode of interpretation by which a name or word having a certainnumerical value was deemed to have a relation with some other words having the same number;10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"thus certain numbers became representative of several ideas, and were considered to beinterpretative one of the other. For example, Messiah spelled MShICh, numbered 358 and so doesthe phrase IBA ShILH, Shiloh shall come; and so this passage in Genesis 49 v.10, was consideredbe a prophecy of the Messiah: note that Nachash NChSh, the Serpent of Moses, is also 358. Theletter Shin, Sh, 300, became an emblem of divinity by corresponding with Ruach Elohim. RUChALHIN'l, the Spirit of the Living God.(2)Notaricon, or abbreviation, is of two forms, one word is formed from the initial andfinal letters of one or more words, or the letters of one name are taken as the initials or finals of thewords of a sentence. For example, in Deut. 30 v. 12, Moses asks 'Who shall go up for us toHeaven?' The initial letters of the original words MI IOLH LNV HShMILH, form the word MILH,mylah, which means circumcision, and the final letters are IHVH, the name Jehovah: hence it wassuggested that circumcision was a feature of the way to God in heaven.Amen, AMN, is from the initials of Adonai melekh namen. 'The Lord and the faithfulking.'; and the famous Rabbinic word of power used for talismans AGLA is formed of the initials ofthe words `Ateh gibur leolam Adonai.' `The Lord ever powerful,' or `Tu patens in soeculumDomine.'(3)Temura is a more complex prodedure, and has led to an immense variety of curiousmodes of divination: the letters of a word are transposed according to certain rules with manylimitations: or again, the letters as arranged by a definite scheme, are often shown in a diagram. Forexample, a common form was to write one half of the alphabet over the other in reverse order, andso that the first letter A was placed by the last T, and B by Shin, and so on. On this plan the wordShesnak of Jeremiah 12v. 26, is said to mean babel: this permutation was known as ATBSh. On thisprinciple we find twenty-one other possible forms named in order ALbat, Abgat: the complete setwas called 'The combination of Tziruph.' other forms were rational, right, averse and irregular,obtained from a square of 22 spaces in each direction, that is of 484 secondary squares, and thenputting a letter in each square in order up and down, and then reading across or diagonally, etc.Kabbalistic literature can be divided in to three major camps. The first is the directrelationship to biblical passages. The second relates to certain phases of literature allied to a tenstage system of development. The third is what is called the Partsifum36 theory where the Kabbalahis expressed through a five stage system.The ten stage system of Kabbalistic development is placed in the form of a Tree (which iscalled the Tree of Life) and has ten Sephirotic stages of evolvement or emanation. These ten stagesare said to relate to the Four Worlds of the Kabbalists37:(1)Atziluth, the World of the Archetype.(2)Briah, the Creative World.(3)Yetzirah, the Formative or Mental World.(4)Assiah, the material or Physical World.These worlds can be considered as a composite of one complete Tree of life or, by yetanother method, as a single Tree divided into four divisions.The first point of consideration is the bridge from one world to the next and this is called theAin Soph Aur or the Limitless Light. This is also called the Three Veils of Negative Existence. Thenumber of letters in this title are said to represent the hidden nine Sephiroth within it for the firstSephiroth (Kether) is also said to represent the last Sephiroth (Malkuth) of the preceeding world.3811"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"(1)Kether (KThR) is the Crown.(2)Chokmah (ChKMH) is Wisdom.(3)Binah (BINH) is Understanding.(4)Chesed (ChSD) is Mercy.(5)Geburah (GB'URH) is Severity.(6)Tiphareth (ThPhARTh) is Beauty.(7)Netzach (NTsCh) is Victory.(8)Hod (HOD) is Glory.(9)Yesod (YSOD) is Foundation.(10)Malkuth (MLKUTh) Kingdom.Between the Sephiroth are Twenty Two Paths. Each path relates to a letter of the HebrewAlphabet. The methodology used when climbing or meditating on a Tree is to start at Malkuth, atthe bottom, and work ones way through the Paths to each Sephiroth. This was the structure thatMathers used for the Golden Dawn ritual. While the Cypher manuscripts dictated this already it wasMathers who transformed it into something a lot more detailed. Each Sephiroth was allocated aGrade and each set of Paths that one travels to reach the Sephiroth is also included in the ritual.F011owing the lead of the cyphers, Mathers then allocated a grade structure almost identical tothe SRIA in name but with the addition of an extra ceremony for Malkuth. Each grade wasallocated a number. For example the First \"level of Neophyte was The second was Zelator at1=10 where the \"One\" derived from Kether showed where the emanation came from and the \"ten\"showed where a person was at the moment. The next grade is Theoricus (Yesod) and is 2=9. Thetwo is for Chokmah and the nine is for Yesod and so on. At the point of Tiphareth or 5=6 the upperand lower emanations would meet and grant the entrance to the Inner Order.While the Paths of the Tree of Life relate to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet there is verylittle documentation concerning them but through the process of analogy and 'GeneralCorrespondences Tables' a rather more complete picture can be formed. The effect of all this wasexpressed by those in the Order through the Kabbalistic concept of the Soul.To each Sephirah and Path of the Kabbalah is allotted certain angelic names, correspondingalso to of the Four Worlds. Along with the angelic entities there is also classification of theDemonic forms associated to the Sephiroth and Paths which Mathers also gave during the GoldenDawn rituals. Similarly for each Sephirah and Path, in each of the Four Worlds, is allotted a specificcolour scheme, where no two colours are identical.Mathers derived his research on colour theory from 22 different authorities on colour andcombined all their knowledge in a unified scheme. He then took things a step further and appliedmeditational aspects to this colour scheme when applied to the body of man.\"From the Zohar the Golden Dawn adapted the concept of the Kabbalistic Soul but alsomarried it with the rudimentary psychology of that period. The highest or innermost kernel of theSoul is called the Yehidah or Divine Consciousness which is related to Kether and is commonlycalled the Higher Self. The next lower level is called the Chiah and is related to the real self of man,far removed from the divine emanations of Kether. Regardie considered that the Chiah and the nextlevel of the soul in Binah related to the Animus and Anima of Jungian psychology. The Ruach ofcourse encompasses all the Sephiroth from Daate to part of Yesod. This includes the componentparts of the personality such as Memory, Reason, Love, Hate etc. Yesod is allied to the next levelof the soul and is called the Nephesch or the state of Automatic Consciousness which resides inpartly in our subconscious and part in our DNA cells. It is constantly changing and often called \"thedream state\".Other GodsYet another layer of meaning in the Golden Dawn rituals is that of various EgyptianGodforms which correspond to each of the Grade ceremonies. The symbolism of the Temple floor12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"plan used in the Grade ceremonies comes from the Egyptian Book of the Dead and is for all intentsand purposes, the Hall of Maat. Each Officers taking part in the rituals represents an EgyptianGodform who corresponds with some aspect of Kabbalistic symbology as well. Even the costumesof the Officers are of Egyptian design. Around the Hall are Invisible Stations where the energies ofother Godforms are manifested as well to help create a power vacuum during the ritual. The Pillars,being one of the main focal points in the ritual, are also linked to the Egyptian Book of the Dead,due to the inscriptions on them derived from that Book.The heavy Egyptian influence is said to draw the energy from the Hall of Maat and project itinto the ritual. In the Neophyte Grade this gives the candidate a type of purification which isessential before he or she can advance through the next four rituals. The second level of Godformrepresentation in the rituals is that taken from the Chaldean Oracles as translated by WynWestcott41. There is yet another layer of symbolic meaning and that is the use of certain Biblicalpassages chapters and the magical uses of Psalms which both gave additional power to the rituals.The prayers to the elementals (from the works of Levi) were also used in some of the rituals andthese yet brought another link to the framework of operation.Geomancy42The principles of Geomancy as used within the Golden Dawn are mentioned a number oftimes during the Elemental Grade rituals, although mainly in the form of diagrams presented to thecandidate during the rituals. At the 3=8 lever of the Practicus Grade a full geomantic set of paperswas given out. Geomancy as described by Agrippa, in his Fourth Book on Occult Philosophy, saysof the Science of Geomancy:Geomancy is the Art of Divination, whereby the judgement may be rendered bylot or destiny, to every question of everything whatsoever but the Art hereofconsisteth especially in certain points whereof certain figures are deducted accordingto the reason or rule of equality or inequality, likeness or unlikeness; which figuresare also reduced to the Celestial Figures, assuming their natures and properties,according to the course and forms of the signs and planets; not withstanding this inthe first place we are to consider, that whereas this kind of Art can declare orshowforth nothing of verity, unless it shall be radical in some sublime venue, andthis the Authors of this Science have demonstrated to be two-fold: and one whereofconsists in Religion and Ceremonies; and therefore they will have the projectings ofthe points of this Art to be made with Signs in the Earth, wherefore this Art isappropriated to this Element of Earth, even as Pyromancy to the fire, andHydromancy to the Element of Water: Then whereas they judged the hand of theProjector or Worker to be most powerfully moved, and directed to the terrestrialSpirits.The TattvasOne of the few areas where Mathers utilised Eastern teaching was in the form of the Tattvaswhich were used as a type of hourly clock of energy. Each energy form was categorised as ageometric shape, such as a half Moon, a triangle, square, circle etc. The original concept of theseGolden Dawn lectures are to be found in Rama Prasad's book, 'Nature Finer Forces'. At the timeMathers draughted up the side lectures for the rituals, these teachings formed a series of lecturesgiven by Prasad to the Theosophical Society.The Magic SquaresOne of the fundamental considerations of power during the Elemental Rituals was the use ofthe Magic Squares of Agrippa. Each square, is divided into a number of lesser squares with thesquare root of each square (formed from the equal numbers of lesser squares both across or down)13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"equal to the number of the Kabbalistic Sephirah it represented. For example, the squarerepresenting the Moon and Yesod has a square root of nine squares. The square representingMercury has a square root of eight squares and relates to both Mercury and Hod etc. Over thesesquares, the names of certain sigils can be traced which represent the glyph or signature of anangelic force which is called forth in the ritual.AlchemyWithin the Outer or First Order, very little alchemical information is given save for keyalchemical phrases which are taken from the Zohar placed by Wyn Westcott and placed in a booktitled 'Purifying Fire'. Since the alchemical knowledge was only briefly discussed in the OuterOrder, this book was often referred to as well as another book that Westcott wrote, called 'TheScience of Alchemy'. Like 'Purifying Fire' this was also well read by aspiring members.Enochian TabletsThe Four Enochian tablets were a series of tablets that Mathers took from the work of Dr.John Dee. Using his own concept of associations he borrowed this system from Dee, and made itthe pinnacle or power base of the Order. Each Tablet was allied with an Element and at the start ofeach ritual, certain names were evoked from the tablet to come forth and assist in the ritual (theNeophyte ritual being the exception.).14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"FoundationOver the years the study structure of each of the Outer Order Grades varied from temple totemple but the following is an outline utilised by the last of the original Golden Dawn Temples,Whare Ra, in New Zealand.

Any ritualwork at that time was in group format with each person counterbalancing the other. This gave theindividuals a feel for the magical work through both initiation and the use of their positions astemple officers. Mathers at this time had been elected Third Chief of the Order along with Westcottand Woodman. The three chiefs were initially given the rank of 5 = 6 which placed them in aSecond Order. Mathers held the Office of Praemonstrator, Westcott the Office of Cancellarius andWoodman the Office of Imperator.By the time a full syllabus for the Outer Order was drawn up, Mathers firmly believed thatsome sort of spiritual power began to pass messages through him. This power he later claimed tocome froth the Third Order and he claimed it guided him in his studies. While one can neitherprove nor disprove this fact the amount of material that he wove into the tapestry of the GoldenDawn was considerable. The rituals for some started to produce clairvoyant capability whileenhanced it in others who were natural clairvoyants. While a great deal of the study material wasnot new, the way it was woven into the rituals produced a new dimension in study concepts.The rituals taught the candidate and the Officers present, to feel with their senses and this iswhat they did, taking this concept to a remarkable degree. In rituals the fusion or currents ofenergy from many different civilisations that the rituals drew their energy from° were experiencedby members one layer at a time. The more experience one had with the rituals than the more adeptthe individual would become in distinguishing various energy forms.Ceremony of the Neophyte RitualThe ceremony has the presence of the Three Chiefs on the Dais as well as the Hierophant andPast Hierophant and a full compliment of Officers on the Temple floor- The Hiereus, Hegemon,Kerux, Stolistes, Dadouchos and Sentinel. The candidate is placed in an ante chamber and iswearing a black robe and bound with a cord. The temple floor plan is arranged in the form of theLower part of the Tree of life with a heavy Egyptian overlay of the Hall of Maat (from the EgyptianBook of the Dead). This is to show that the Candidate has to purify himself before being acceptedby Osiris, as the Hierophant, as shown in the Papyri of Ani. Scattered through the Hall are thestations of the Egyptian Godforms that are supposed to protect and frighten the candidate on hisjourney.The first knock, given by the Hierophant, starts the ceremony off by initiating a fresh currentof energy that floods into the hall. The Kerux then, with his wand, utters a challenge that anyonewho should not be present should get out. This then stops any negative form of energy from beingpresent. The energy from the initiating current is caught and harnessed through performing the 0 =0 Signs. To the uninitiated the Signs of the 0 = 0 are merely signs of recognition but in actualitythey have a deeper meaning for it is these signs that one must use to tap into the magnetic currentsof energy and give it some direction. Gradually, each one of the Officers on the Floor recites his orher position and function for in the 0 = 0 they are told:Let the number of Officers in this degree and the nature of their Offices beproclaimed once again, that the powers whose images they are may be reawakened17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"in the spheres of those present and in the sphere of this Order - for by names andImages are all Powers awakened and reawakened.The current of energy that is initiated by the Hierophant brings with it the energy of otherforms that the Officers draw from through their will. Once the energy has been correctly activatedthen the Hall is purified and consecrated by Water and Fire by the Stolistes and the Dadouchoswhich further refines the magnetic quality of the ritual. The Floor Officers then do a MysticCircumambulation to try and connect their spheres of operation or aspects of their Higher Selves towhat is being introduced in the ritual. After this the Adoration is then done by all in the Temple tothe Lord of the Universe which is an act of affirmation by those present. Then, with a series ofknocks, the Light or deeper aspect of energy is drawn into the ritual and completes the final part ofthe opening.The Admission of the Candidate then begins. A knock is then given by the Hierophant whonow acts as the controlling Higher Self of the candidate. This links the aura of the Candidate to thesymbology of the rose, cup, lamp and bread as used in the rituals. On entering the Hall thecandidate is,then purified and lead to the altar, on which is the symbol of the red cross above thewhite triangle. It is here when the candidate kneels before the altar and places his or her hand in thecentre of the triangle to affirm the oath of secrecy which binds the candidate to the Order and theHigher aspirants of soul. During the oath a sword is placed at the neck of the Candidate andthis is where the transmitted energy enters the Candidate's aura and helps fortify and clear away thenegative influences that tend to pull the soul of the aspirant away from the true light of the soul.The Candidate iS then taken around the altar and stopped at certain cardinal positions andgiven information on what he or she must expect at certain directions. It is very much the conceptof a journey through the. zodiac. The various steps, signs and password is then given to theCandidate followed by further consecrations. A speech is then given to the Candidate in the formof a lecture of the ancient mysteries and some symbology of the temple.The closing of the ceremony of the Neophyte involves the closing of the light in which areverse circumambulation of the Hall is done followed my another Adoration. At this point theceremony of the Eucharist is then undertaken where the Officers of the temples now partake in thesymbology of nourishment in the form of integrating with the rose, cup, bread and salt, and winewith the four elements. Four these have been energized by the ceremony and help sustain themagnetic energy of the aura and said to be healing in their characteristics. When all have partakenin them the ceremony then is completed.Ceremony of the Zelator GradeThis ceremony relates specifically to the Sephirah of Malkuth, which is allied to the Kingdomof Earth. This is the first of the Elemental Grades and is a drastic change of pace from the previousceremony but of no lesser importance. On the altar the cross is now placed within the Triangleshowing the descent of spirit into matter. Descending from, or placed by the altar is the diagram ofthe Flaming Sword on the Tree of Life, which is also the Lightning Flash showing the descent of thelight down the Paths to Malkuth and the Altar below it. On the walls to the east are the Hebrewletters of Shin, Tau and Qoph, the three paths that lead from Malkuth to the higher aspects of theTree of Life. The pillars are now placed below the altar, representing the same pillars which thecandidate has come through in the previous ceremony.A major difference between this ceremony and the previous one is the fact that the EnochianTablet of Earth is present in the North of the hall. This is the power base of the Golden Dawn andis fused with the Egyptian, Chaldean and Kabbalistic influence of this ceremony.The ceremony is started by a specific number of knocks, made by the Officers with theirmagical implements, to initiate the fresh currents that form the vortex where the hall is. The Spirits18"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"of Earth, the particular Archangel and names from the Enochian tablets are then invoked and withthe name `Adonai Ha-Aretz' the temple is then opened.The Neophyte is then ushered in with an admission badge, being the Hermetic Cross, in theshape of a Swastika. The Neophyte is then placed between the Pillars and the Oath or Obligationfor this grade is then given. The Hierophant then tells the Neophyte:The 1 = 10 Grade of Neophyte is a preparation for other Grades, a thresholdbefore our discipline, and shown by its imagery, the Light of the Hidden Knowledgedawning in the Darkness of Creation; and you are now to begin to analyze andcomprehend the nature of that Light. To this end you stand between the Pillars, inthe gateway where the secrets of the 0-0 were communicated to you.After a series of prompts, the Neophyte is then lead around the temple. As the Neophytereaches the Altar the most significant part of the ceremony is undertaken. During the speech of theHierophant, the Neophyte is told of the Flaming Sword at the Gates of Eden for this is the first ofthe major symbols of self sacrifice that the Neophyte must be acquainted with before anyadvancement can be made in the Order.In the Second Part of the ceremony the Temple setting is now changed. This part of theceremony is different from the first, in so much it is based on parts of the biblical book, fromExodus, particularly that concerning the entry to the Inner Sanctum of the Holy Temple. There aretwo additional diagrams presented here, the Table of Shewbread and the Seven Branched CandleStick. These reinforce both the main aspects of the Sepher Yetzirah, as explained in the 0 = 0, and aconcept of learning involving a seven and twelve stage systems which are constantly repeatedthroughout the occultists advancement through the grades of the Order. At this point, a mystic titleis bestowed on the Neophyte, who now becomes, in fact, a Zelator.The closing part of the ceremony is also very important for it includes the Prayer to theGnomes, the Elemental inhabitants of Earth, and links the aura of the Zelator directly to the energyof Earth.Ceremony of the Theoricus GradeThis ceremony differs yet even further from the previous one because now the Zelator has totraverse a Path of the Tree of Life before the Sephirah of Yesod, which represents the Air Element,can be reached. The Pillars are placed back in the position of the 0 = 0 Grade. There is yet anotherEnochian Tablet present in the East, the Tablet of Air, plus the previous Tablet of Earth in theNorth. On the Altar is a fan, lamp, salt and cup placed around the four edges, with a large Tarotdrawing of the 21st Key or Trump at the centre of the altar. Of the Officers on the floor, only theKerux, Hiereus and Hegemon are present.The starting or opening of this ceremony and the invocation of the names in front of the AirTablet, are done in much the same manner of those of the previous grade. The Spirits of Air andthe Archangel Raphael along with the Enochian names of Power are called forth by the Ilierophant.With the Name Shaddai El-Chai' the ceremony is then opened.The Zelator is brought in with a new admission badge, the Greek Cubical Cross, and is thengives the grips, signs and password of the previous grade to show his right of admission. TheHierophant then informs the Zelator that only the 32nd Path is opened to him. The Kerux thenleads the Zelator around the hall where various stops are made and challenges are given, andfollowed by signs and mysteries which are then revealed to him. Following his journey the Zelatoris then introduced to the esoteric explanation of the 21st Tarot Key, the Universe which is the mainfocal point of journey, for all the ideas incorporated in the explanation of the 32nd path are shownin the 21st Tarot Key.19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The second part of this ritual has a different temple arrangement with the prominent diagramon the altar being the Serpent on the Tree of Life. This diagram is then explained to the Zelator ingreat detail for it is the first major symbol of Self Sacrifice, representing the Serpent of Brass whichMoses made in the Wilderness, and which was wrapped around the Middle Pillar of the Tree ofLife. The Signs, grips, names and other symbols of the 2 = 9 grade are then given to the newTheoricus. Also at this point the Theoricus is informed about the Magic squares and sigils that arepresent in this part of the ceremony.The closing part of this ceremony is the same as the previous one except that the prayer is tothe Air Elementals, the Sylphs.Ceremony of the Practicus GradeIn the first part, the temple is arranged for the 31st Path with the Letter Shin being on the far-left above the dais. The Enochian Tablet of Water is hanging in the West and the 20th Tarot Key isplaced on the Altar. The ceremony is opened as before, calling down the names of the Spirits ofWater and the Arch Angel Gabriel along with the names from the Enochian Water Tablet.After the various knocks are given the Theoricus is admitted with the admission badge andthen tested with the signs etc., of the Theoricus Grade. The Theoricus is then led around to certainpoints of the hall and shown various diagram's and challenges. The entire theme of the 31st Path is-closely allied with that of the Kabiri of Samothracian time. After listening to the various lecturesthe Theoricus is then invested with the title, Lord of the 31st path:The temple in the second part is arranged in the 30th Path with the 19th Tarot Key placed on-the Altar. The Theoricus is then admitted with an Admission Badge where the Kabiri theme iscontinued. Again more challenges are given and symbols are shown including the esoteric. explanation of the 19th Tarot Key. The Theoricus is then given the title Lord of the 30th Path.HodThe Temple is arranged according to the Sephirah of Hod which is allied to the symbol waterand the planet Mercury. As usual, the Theoricus enters with an Admission Badge and is thenshown the significance (in the form of a lecture) of the diagram of Garden of Eden. The grip, signsand tokens of the 3 = 8 grade are then imparted to the new Practicus, including the grand name`Elohim Tzaboath'.The altar diagram bearing the cross above the inverted triangle is explained as the Power ofSpirit rising above the Triumph of Waters. The new Practicus is then \"given\" the letter Mem as asymbol and the magic square and sigils of the planet Mercury are shown to him. The closing is thesame as the previous ritual with the invocation of the Elementals of Water or Undines.Ceremony of the Philosophus GradeThe Temple is set for the 29th Path of Qoph, with only the Hiereus and Hegemon of the floorOfficers being present. On the Altar is the 18th Tarot Key of the Moon. The Enochian FireTablet is on the wall in the South. The 4 = 7 Grade is associated with the Sephirah of Netzach and.the planet Venus.The Opening is done in the usual way in front of the Fire Tablet in the South. The Spirits ofWater and the Enochian Tablet, the Arch Angel Michael are invoked through the power of YodHeh Vau Heh Tzaboath. The Practicus is then admitted, with the admission badge and, after givingthe Signs and recognition signals of the 3 = 8 Grade, he then takes the Oath. The challenges andprompts are given along with an esoteric explanation of some of the temple symbolism, includingthe 18th Key of the Tarot.When this is accomplished the Title of Lord of the 29th Path is given to the Practicus.20"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"A similar procedure is then gone through for the 28th and 29th Paths, with the 17th and 16thKey of the tarot being on the central altar.NetzachAlong the top of the Dais lies the Hebrew letter Kaph, signifying that Path. On the Northernside of the Hall lies the Hebrew letters of Nun, Peh and Tzaddai while on the Western side of theHall is the letter Qoph, all signifying Kabbalistic Paths of the Tree of Life in relation to the Sephirahof Netzach. The Altar diagram shows the upright triangle above the cross and relates to theTriangle of Fire above the cross of life.The most important diagram in this last part of the ritual is that of the Diagram of the Fall.This differs from the diagram shown in the 3 = 8 in which the Dragon is coiled beneath Malkuth inthe region of the Qlippoth but raises its head to show the manifestation and rise of the unbalancedforces of Edom. The head of the Qlippoth in this aspect now reaches but is halted at Daath andcannot enter the Kabbalistic world of Briah. The symbology shows the Ruach overpowering theNeschamah for if the Neschamah seeks the world of gratification then both will be ruined. It issimply a matter of choice.The Practicus is then admitted to the Grade of Philosophus, and given the usual recognitionsigns. The Officers close the ritual by uttering the prayer to the Fire Elementals or Salamanders.Equinox Ritual4The whole formula of the ceremony of the Equinox is to establish a Magical Link from theesoteric energy of the Sun to that of the Order, and for that reason the ritual is performed within 24hours of the Suns entry ityLibra or Aries. All Officers are present during this ceremony, as in the 0= 0, yet the Kerux is the only one who moves. Each knock and exchange brings in fresh currents ofenergy that are trapped by the Officers and a vortex of these pulsating energies is formed. After thecirctunambulation of the Kerux the Officers then lay down their insignia and the incoming Officersthen pick them up. The whole concept is one of sealing of the forces of nature and utilizing itsinfluences for the benefit of the Order. All those present will gain from the energy trapped by thisimportant ceremony.These six rituals, and the associated Knowledge Lectures formed the basis of the GoldenDawn in the Outer and are the bulk of what Mothers presented to both Westcott and Woodman forapproval, which they both gladly gave.21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"GrowthIn March of 1888, the Golden Dawn Temple of Isis-Urania was officially founded. Amajority of the original members came from the S.RI.A. For many others the Order was at first-looked upon as an evolution of Masonry. In fact, the Isis-Urania is still classed as a quasi-MasonicTemple in the Masonic Encyclopedia, and attracted a number of Masons for that reason. One thingthe Golden Dawn did was to open the Order up to both sexes, that no doubt a number of its-Masonic members did not approve. Westcott saw the value of this from the Theosophical Societyand knew the effectiveness and growth of the Order would depend on having it open to both sexes.A number of the early initiates in the first few years of the Golden Dawn's history became very-prominent people in society, such as W.B. Yeats\", Florence Farr', Annie Horniman (the teaheiress) and others of equal note, including Mathers' future wife, Moina Bergson, sister of theFrench Philosopher. In many respects, the anonymity of each individual was protected by the-taking of a motto, usually in Latin.1888 was a boom year for the fledgling Golden Dawn. The Isis-Urania Temple hadapproximately thirty-two Outer Order members and at least eight were admitted to the Inner Order.-Due to the large number of initiations, the Chiefs of Isis-Urania wanted to slow down the initiationrate by making a mandatory three month break between the 3 = 8 and 4 = 7 rituals. Some of the_Inner Order members then were pressured to form temples of their own, .resulting of the Osiris-Weston-Super Mare which had eight members of the Outer Order. The three Chiefs for thisTemple were Benjamin Cox, Frank Coleman and Dr. Edward Nunn. The next Temple that wasfounded was Horus, at Bradford. The three Chiefs were T.H. Pattinson, F.D. Harrison and J.L.Atherton. In the first year they had eleven members in the Outer Order. Both Cox and Pattinsonwere noted members of the S.R.I.A. and no doubt quite adept at ritual.In 1889, the Isis-Urania had slowed down and initiated only fourteen new members. OsirisTemple had only two initiations in the Outer and one in the Inner Order. Although Osiris was an upand running Temple it was not until 1889 that it was consecrated. Mathers finished drafting up themajor documents for the Outer Order in 1889, but he also was creating documents for the. Secondor Inner Order. There were at least thirteen members by now in the Inner Order and the pressurewas starting to mount on both Mathers and Westcott for an Inner Order study. Members who were`admitted' to the 5 = 6 Grade at this time still had not undertaken any Ceremony for that Grade. In1889 there was also something of an upheaval in both the Theosophical Society and the GoldenDawn. One of the Inner Order initiates, Rev. Aytonmwas very indiscreet in telling members of the-Theosophical Society about the Golden Dawn, and that some of its members were also in theTheosophical Society. Complaints came from members of the Society about a Golden Dawninfiltration. After a secret meeting between Mathers and Madam Blavatsky51, the problem resolveditself. Those in the Golden Dawn were now permitted into the Inner Circle of the TheosophicalSociety, provided they adhered to certain conditions.Also during 1889, Westcott claimed the rank of 7 = 4, for all three Chiefs of Isis-Urania,based on correspondence from the mysterious S.D.A. who resided in Germany. To my way ofthinking, it also gave the three Chiefs breathing space and put them, in terms of rank, light years-ahead of the competition in the Inner Order.In 1890, a number of significant things happened in the Golden Dawn. The first was thatMathers married Moina Bergson, and there is no doubt that this partnership helped shape the-structure of the Inner Order. During this time they experimented greatly with various methods ofclairvoyance. Moina had strong mediumistic tendencies and by today's standards was a natural`channeler'. In this state, both she and Mathers received messages from those they would later-designate as the Secret Chiefs, and started to receive what was considered Inner Order materialfrom them. Mathers later claimed in a letter to fellow members, that the work required to receive22"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"such Second Order documents as the Z2 nearly killed both of them. Perhaps an overdramaticstatement, yet the difficulty they had in receiving the material is all too apparent.The membership numbers for the Isis-Urania improved dramatically in the Inner Order whilethe Outer Order initiates remained static from the previous year. The other Temples, Osiris andHorus showed increased membership as well. In 1890, Mathers worked on several other projects,one with Yeats in working on a manuscript which applied Celtic Godforms Kabbalisticly. Theother was to transform the Enochian material of Dr. John Dee into some sort of workable systemfrom the papers given to him by Westcott from F.G. Irwin (1823-98)52.In 1891, the Isis-Urania Temple initiated eighteen members in the Inner Order and at leasttwenty-three in the Outer. The Horns Temple initiated twelve in the Outer Order and five in theInner Order. Not including demissions, the Inner Order by then had approximately fourty-twomembers and the pressure for Inner Order material from the three Chiefs was urgent. Mathers hadbeen working furiously on constructing the Inner Order rituals, and along with Westcott, beganwriting lectures for them. That year Woodman died and Mathers took over his position in theChieftainship.The summer of 1891, Mathers and Moina left for Paris, where tradition tells us, he underwentprofound changes in his magical direction. During the months he spent there, a full 5 = 6 ritual wasdrafted u15 and he had nearly completed the Inner Order study course. During this time he laterclaimed to have met the Secret Chiefs of the Order who had guided and instructed both him andMoina with the new additional material.On returning to England, the first 5 = 6 initiate to go through the new ritual was AnnieHorniman. I believe she was generous in supplying funds to Mathers so he could go to Paris in thefirst place. For a few months in 1891, Mathers -was the curator of the Horniman Museum, andfinancially owed Homixnan a great deal. But her real friendship was with Moina, whom she hadknown for some years earlier.It was in 1892 that a large number of members, many who had previously obtained thenominal 5 = 6 Grade, were now put through the 5 = 6 ritual. Late in 1892, the Portal ritual wasintroduced for all those who had obtained the Grade of 4 = 7 and were waiting to pass into theInner Order. The 5 = 6 ritual returned to the Rosicrucian philosophy of the Fama and Confessiodocuments. Included among the Temple furniture for this ritual was an elaborately constructedVault.Due to the large number of initiations and increasing demands on their time, the Chiefs of theIsis-Urania then appointed sub-Chiefs. For a while during 1892, the various Chiefs and sub-Chiefsplayed a game of musical chairs. The positions changed in the first six months, possibly due to thedeath of Woodman and the absence of Mathers, who spent a large amount of this year in France.Berridge, then Percy Bullock, shared the sub-Praemonstrator position. Horniman was sub-Praemonstrator, Bullock took the position of Praemonstrator for the first part of the year and thenthe position was given to Alex Carden with Bullock becoming sub-Praemonstrator.During the same year Moina Mathers decided to return to her home in France to study art,again generously helped by Homiman, while Mathers remained in England working as curator forthe Museum. After some problems at the Museum, Mathers was let go, and immediately went toFrance to join his wife; though their study was more on magical pursuits than art.To return to the Inner Order rituals, that of the Portal, was in fact the first part of the 5 = 6,for it dealt with the climbing of the Paths while the 5 = 6 ritual proper was the admittance to theSephirah of Tiphareth. It followed basically the same pattern as the Outer Order rituals in goingthrough the Paths before they got to the Sephirah. It was, no doubt, due to the length of this ritualthat it was cut in two parts, Portal and 5 = 6. After studying this ritual for a number of years, I amof the opinion that Mathers did not create the Portal ritual after the 5 = 6 ritual, but before it. Itwas not used on those members who had obtained the nominal 5 = 6 because they had alreadyobtained that rank anyway. It was those who came through at a later date into the Inner Order whohad to undergo the two rituals.23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"-Portal RitualThis ritual of the Paths leading to Tiphareth, actually came in four parts:(1)The Opening.(2)The second is the Ritual of the Cross and Four elements.(3)The third is the Rite of the Pentagram and the Five Paths.(4)The Closing.In the Opening, all four Elemental Tablets are present plus the Hebrew letters representingthe five Paths of Mem, Ayin, Samekh, Nun and Kaph. A Veil is placed over the Dais so that itcannot be seen. The Tarot trumps of Death and the Devil are present but this time they are placedon the walls of the South and North. The symbolism on the Altar is the Pentagram above theCross. Also on the Altar are rose leaves, incense, water and salt. The Officers present are the-Chief Adept, Second Adept, Third Adept, Hiereus and Hegemon. The Sign of the Neophyte isgiven to the ;East and to the Chief Adept. The Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram is then done andthe various Officers then make the Signs of the 1 = 10 to 4 = 7 in their respective Elemental-quarters.The title of Phrath', the fourth River of Eden, is then given as the title of the Portal.Through a series of knocks the Hebrew letters of Kaph, Tau, Resh and Peh are given whichrepresents the word Paroketh, the Veil of the Tabernacle. The Signs of Rëndering of the Veil aregiven, the curtains are drawn back, and the Vault of the Second Order is then opened slightly. Onthe outside walls of the Vault are the four Elemental Tablets, joined by the Tablet of Union. TheInvoking Pentagrams of the four Elements are done consecutively by the Chief Adept in eachrespective quarter. Part of the first Enochian Call is then given and an Adoration is performed.The Ritual of the Cross and the Four Elements has the Chief Adept concealed behind a Veiland the candidate is brought in with an Admission Badge. The oath is taken. The 1 = 10 Sign isgiven and the Earth Tablet is opened by the names of this Element. An explanation follows of thesymbolism of the Maltese Cross. The 2 = 9 Sign is given and the names of the Air tablet areinvoked. The alchemical symbolism of the Great Arcanum is then explained along with the drawingof Nebuchadnezzar. The diagrams of the Kerubim are then also explained.Next is the Rite of the Pentagram and the Five Paths. The usual explanations of the Hebrewletters, representing the Paths are given along with a symbolic barring of several Paths the candidateis not permitted to enter. The diagram of Typhon the Destroyer and the 13th Tarot Key of Death is-explained. An explanation of the 15th Tarot Key of the Devil and the diagram of Pan is thenexplained. Further prompts are given and the old and new versions of the Tarot Key ofTemperance are also revealed.The Closing of the Ceremony is done through the power of the name of `Yeheshuah' and theL.V.X. Signs.The study undertaken between the Portal and the 5 = 6 ritual in the early days of the Order-considered mainly of the study of the previous rituals, well as meditational practice. The Order'sAstrology lectures were then studied along with a lecture on Tarot divination (the Celtic Crossmethod).Adeptus Minor RitualThis ritual was introduced to the fledgling magician as part of the Rosicrucian philosophy.Mathers went back to the S.R.I.A. roots, using the Fama and Confessio manifestoes as part of the5 = 6 ritual. This ritual which is in three points. The first is the Opening in which the symbology ofthe finding of the burying place of Christian Rosenkretuz is explained. The formula of bringing24"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"down the Light (Divine White Brilliance or D.W.B.) is then given through the Signs of the. 5 = 6Grade. The Candidate enters at this point and is given the usual challenges of the Grade and is thenled to the Cross of Suffering to which he is bound and the oath is then taken. This is a major pointin the Ceremony, which is the transfer of the consciousness from the Candidate's Ruach to hisNeshamah. The assuming of the position of Self Sacrifice and the invocation to the Higher self inthe form of the angel HUA, is a triggering factor in this union. The obligation is then given alongwith a speech on what the Rosicrucian manifestoes represented.The second point of the ceremony has the Chief Adept lying in the Pastos, in the Vault. TheCandidate is admitted to the Vault by the other Officers and more symbolism is explained. TheCandidate then accepts a symbol of suffering in the form of a chain which he then places around hisneck. The top part of the Pastos is removed and the Chief Adept is revealed. The candidate thentouches the Rose on the Chief Adept which then further links his Ruach to his Neshamah. TheCrook and Scourge are then given to the Candidate who stands in the form of Osiris. Moresymbology is explained and the Officers and Candidate quit the Vault.The third point of the ritual has the Pastos and lid outside the Vault. More symbolism is thenexplained and the candidate is then led back into the Vault where all kneel and this is the third placewhere the. Ruach and Neshamah battle for control. The new Adeptus Minor is then accepted andthe Divine White Brilliance formula is invoked. More symbolism of the Vault is then explainedfollowed by the Closing Ceremony.Any individual who went through this Ceremony would have been enormously impressedwith the emphasis on the subliminal messages given through the Ceremony.In 1893, those who went through this Ceremony found that many of their old views of ritualhad been shattered, for this Ceremony was unlike anything that they had seen before, Masonic orotherwise. At this point Mathers also began handing out new study documents. These were adramatic leap from the rather mundane Knowledge Lectures of the Outer Order.5 = 6 CurriculumThe first thing the Adept was requested to do was to make and consecrate his elementalweapons, sword, lotus wand, rose cross and crux ansata (which was always carried when in theVault). Specific methods of making and consecrating these which adhered to the Ordersphilosophy, were provided to every Adeptus lvfmor. The Invoking and Banishing rituals of thePentagram and Hexagram were also studied to help aid the adept, and help him identify with certainastrological influences.Z DocumentsThere were also three important documents known as the Z series. The Z1 gave abreakdown of the esoteric symbolism of the 0 = 0 ritual and the opening of that Ceremony. The Z3was a further study of the symbolism of the 0 = 0. The Z2 broke down the 0 = 0 ceremony intotwenty four parts and adapted five basic aspects of Occult ritual to it; each part linking to the fivelettered Hebrew name YHSVH (hw'hy) or Yeheshuah. Tuition and study of this document wasgiven to those who asked for it.For the letter Yod, belong to the works of ceremonial magic, as the evocation ofthe Spirits of the Elements, etc.Unto the first letter Heh, the consecration and charging of telesmata, and theproduction of natural Phenomena, as storms, earthquakes, etc.Unto the Great letter Shin are allotted Three classes of works. Spiritualdevelopment, transformation and invisibility.Unto the letter Vau, Divination in all its branches and the art of making the linkbetween the subject of the work and the process of divination.25"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"And to the Final Heh, the works and operation of the Art of Alchemy, the orderof its processes and transmutation.The TarotMathers constructed a study system of the Tarot. This gave the Inner Order members studymethods of the Court Cards and the Minor Arcana. The full explanations of the Trumps were notyet given however as these were to be revealed only to those as they went through the Order'shigher rituals. With this a complete formula and example of full ceremonial divination was given aswell, which went far beyond the simple Celtic Cross divination given out previously. This adheredto the Z2 formula. Westcott added to the Tarot by applying the it globally to the world and to, thegreater universe beyond.Enochian System. In the Outer Order, the Enochian Tablets only referred to briefly, but in the 5 = 6 they were-discussed deeply in a series of documents.(1)Document 'S', the attributions of the Enochian Tablets.(2)Document 'T', Angelic Keys or Calls.(3)Document 'X', the Egyptian Godforms as applied to the Enochian Squares.(4)Document 'H', Name extraction 'method of the Tablets.(5)Notanda, an explanation of the how the Elemental, Tarot, and Astrologicalsymbolism is applied to the squares of the Tablets.(6) Document 1(1' and `Y2'. This was on Enochian Chess.AlchemyThe Order document on Alchemy called 'M', was not very informative. Through the help ofsome of his S.R.I.A. colleagues, Mathers passed around a number of Alchemical manuscripts suchas the Homer's Golden Chain, Splendor Solis, as well as the works of Thomas Vaughan and Ripley.Mathers did not teach practical Alchemy, but insisted that those who did it adhered to the Z2formula of ritual.-TalismanicThe document 'F' showed the adept how to make seals and sigils from the Rose fortalismanic and Elemental weapon consecration. Also, a number of documents on the construction-of the seals and sigils from the Magic Squares were given as well.ClairvoyanceAstral projection and healing through clairvoyance, at a distance, were taught. Explorationsof what Occultists call Inner Planes, which in reality these planes are different dimensional states.These of course vary with the structure and system one uses.In 1892, Mathers started to place officially in the Order some additional lectures known asFlying Rolls which he, as well as other members had compiled and had started to gain a strongfollowing in the Order. These eventually totaled thirty-six in number from the inception of theInner Order until 1900.\"Further to this, Mathers had drafted up a ceremony for the Consecration of the Vault whichwas to be held at Summer Solstice.The Isis-Urania Temple subsequently gained another eight Inner Order members and fourteen-in the Outer while the Horus Temple initiated three in the Outer and one in the Inner Order. A newTemple was also formed in Edinburgh. A number of members had wanted a Temple there since1888 but it was not until 1893 that the Chiefs of Isis-Urania granted it. Seven members were26"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"admitted to the Outer and three to the Inner Order. The Chiefs were J.W. Brodie- hums and hiswife, and George Camegi Dickson. It should be mentioned here that Mathers was greatly aided byWilliam Peck, Astronomer of Edinburgh (1862-1925), for a lecture he was writing on the StarMaps for the Tarot. Mathers used Peck's maps for a subdivision of the heavens.54In or around 1893, Mathers had decided to create a sub Grade of Theoricus Adeptus Major.Though some in the Order were told of it, no one was admitted until the following year and lectureswere handed around telling those senior Adeptus Minors what was required for this Grade in formof an examination.Mathers at this point was seldom in England and now started to consider Paris as his home.The first of the foreign students were initiated in Paris in 1893 and this was the foundation for theTemple Ahathoor. Westcott went to Paris at this time for a meeting with Mathers and the firstmember of the yet unconsecrated Temple was initiated.In January 1894 Mathers had his benefactor, Annie Horniman, officially consecrate the ParisTemple Ahathoor. The Isis-Urania Temple was now booming with 29 members in the Outer andeight in the Inner Order and Dr. Henry Pullen-Burry replaced Carden as Sub Chief. Horns Templehad admitted another six in the Outer while Amen Ra had seven. It is thought that around 1894Mathers wife Moina, was given the Grade of 6 = 5. Apart from Westcott and Mathers, who were 7= 4, she was the next highest Grade in the Order. Also during this time the Chiefs and sub Chiefs ofIsis-Urania passed the examination to the Grade of Theoricus Adeptus Minor. No additional paperswere handed out for this Grade nor rituals giVen for it for it consisted merely of more in depth studyof existing material. Throughout this period, Mathers continued his study and research at theFrench Library and unearthed a number of interesting magical texts that he would later translateinto book form. Oswald resigned as co-Chief of the Paris Temple and was replaced by R. Nisbet.1895 was a year in which Isis-Urania Temple had twenty members in the Outer and nine inthe Inner Order. Horns Temple had admitted three for each Order while Amen Ra Temple had• fourteen members in the Outer and eight in the Inner Order. In appreciation for his efforts at AmenRa Temple, Brodie limes was deservedly promoted to the rank of Theoricus Adeptus Minor. InParis, Mathers initiated another five members in the Outer and two in the Inner Order. A strainedrelationship developed between Mathers and Annie Horniman started up because Mathers refusedto reprimand those Order members whose teachings and sexual leanings did not coincide withAnnie Homiman's. In standing his ground, Mathers risked forfeiting her generosity which had keptboth he and Moina for a number of years, allowing Mathers the time to pursue his esoteric learningwithout the necessity of earning a day to day living. During this period Mathers received a numberof visits from the English Adepti, such as Yeats, Mrs. H. Rand and Allan Bennett.In 1896 the Isis-Urania Temple had an additional nineteen members in the Outer and ten inthe Inner Order. Horns Temple had three Outer Order initiations while Amen Ra had twenty in theOuter and nine in the Inner. Ahathoor Temple in Paris admitted four to the Outer and one to theInner Order. Bullock replaced Florence Farr as one of the Chiefs of Isis-Urania. Pullen-Burry alsoreplaced him that same year with Pamela Bullock becoming Sub Chief that year. In many respectsit was musical chairs for the Chiefs and Sub-Chiefs of Isis-Urania. The situation between Mathersand Annie Horniman resulted in her expulsion from the Order with Mrs. Rand taking up herposition as Sub-Chief. Mathers had by this stage had to resort to making a living in Paris. Heoffered his publisher, George Redway, a translation of his manuscript Book of the Sacred Magic ofAbramelin the Mage. Once published, this work gave the general public access to one of the mostadvanced systems of magic yet devised.Little is known about the specific history of the Golden Dawn Temples for the next threeyears until 1900. The exception being the major development of Westcott being forced to resign asa member of the Golden Dawn once rumors of his occult activities was learned by those in highpublic places and put pressure on him professionally to do so. Also in 1897 a new Grade ofPracticus Adeptus Minor was instigated and the examination papers for this Grade were sent to theTheoricus Adeptus Minors. This differed from the previous Grade as Mathers had now draughted27"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"-new lectures, such as The Ring and Disk Formula, The True System of Astrological Divination, andfurther studies into Enochian work. It is not known if anyone passed this examination though itseems likely, though no such record exists. Occult historians generally agree that the two subGrades of Theoricus Adeptus Minor and Practicus Adeptus Minor became the practical work forthe 6 = 5 and 7 = 4 Grades proper. In Paris, in or around the late 1890's, Mathers gave out the 7 =4 Grade to an American couple by the name of Lockwood. It is assumed that they passed the twosub Grades and were given these as documentation for the 6 = 5 and 7 = 4 Grades. If this was thecase then Moina Mathers would have then been promoted to 7 = 4 as well.The relationship between Mathers and Westcott deteriorated and Mathers autocratic behaviorwas only tolerated due to his distance from the Temples. Though Westcott had formally resignedfrom the Order he was still communicating with fellow members of the Order. In 1899, in aremarkable about face, Mathers contacted Annie Horniman and offered to reinstate her as a type ofroving trouble shooter attached to the Paris Temple. At this time Annie Horniman was conferringwith Secret Chiefs of her own and told Mathers she did not acknowledge his overall authority. She-preferred to keep out of the trouble that was brewing between Mathers and some of the otherAdepti and turned down his offer. Mathers felt, rightly or wrongly, that Westcott was trying totake over the Order and started rallying for support.In 1900 a number of instances occurred (not in chronological order) that eventually lead tothe breakup of the Order. The first was the rejection of the Chiefs of the Isis-Urania Temple toadmit one Aleister Crowley to the Second Order after he had passed the examinations. Crowley-then went to Paris to study directly under Mathers and the two, along with Moina, became quitefriendly and Mathers initiated him into the 5 = 6 through the Paris Temple. This caused an uproarin English Order due to their being overruled.The second major instance occurred when a certain Madame Horns and her husband visitedMathers. She claimed 8 = 3 from an American Temple\"and related to Mathers parts of a private. conversation he had with Madame Blavatsky along with knowledge about the Grades of the Orderand their contents. Apparently at this time the American Golden Dawn Temples were autonomousof Mathers in the sense they had the power to administer the advanced Grades or so Mathersbelieved. Madame Horns and her husband were then involved in a rape trial in which the GoldenDawn's name was mentioned which drew a number of resignations from the Order.The third issue was when Mathers, fed up with Westcott's interfering, claimed that Westcotthad forged the correspondence between the German Adept SDA and himself. Mathers claimed thatthe authority of the Inner Order came from him and him alone and that Westcott claims (whateverthey were) were spurious.The fourth issue, leading out of the above, was when the Chiefs of the Order in Englandexpelled Mathers, as a result of the apparent duplicity of both Mathers and Westcott. Mathers sentAleister Crowley to London to take back the possession of the Isis-Urania Temple, when the Chiefs-refused to return papers to Mathers. The whole debacle in London subsequently involved themembers of the Order winning out against Mathers in the retention of their property. Crowley hadenough problems of his own by then and for reasons unknown, went north to his retreat for his own-personal magical workings. Some years later Crowley wrote in his Equinox journal that Mathersritually cursed the heads of the Order who gave him trouble by splitting up the Order even further.Whether or not this was in Crowley's imagination or not remains to be seen but something wasclearly afoot which broke up the Order even further.Due to the deep division within the Order new Temples under the name of the Alpha etOmega (under the leadership of Mathers) were formed. The first Temple was called Isis, under theleadership of Berridge with Mathers and Moina as Chiefs in absentee. Brodie Inns in Amen Rahovered and for a number of years could not make his mind up on what side of the fence he was.The bulk of those in Isis-Urania Temple that had rejected Mathers now tried to work on acommittee basis and this catapulted Adepti's A.E. Waite and Dr. Robert Felldn into prominentpositions. Waite, of course, was well known in the Golden Dawn for his books and was quite sort28"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"after for his knowledge, according to later statements by Felkin. Felkin however was a bornorganizer who could work well with people as a team effort. After a number of meetings theAdepti decided to change the name of the Order to the M.R or Morgan Rothe (Red Dawn). Duringthe years from 1900 to 1903 the Order seemed to work quite well although Waite was stirring thepot somewhat, in trying to change the direction of the Order from magic to a mystical one. At thistime all the documents of the Order were kept jointly by Waite and Felkin. A number of thesepapers were from the Practicus Adeptus Minor Grade and I am sure that these must have beengiven out to some for I personally believe that Mathers would not send these valuable papers toIsis-Urania to someone who was not high enough in rank to see them. Possibly one or two of theAdepti took them in Paris, but this is pure speculation on my part.Annie Horniman was later reinstated to the Order and started on a campaign against FlorenceFarr and especially against her Sphere Group. In its magical workings, the Sphere Group placedAdepti on the position of the Tree of Life on a Solid Sphere and used a central Adept as channel.All methods of investigation were done including Enochian work. In her role as 'troubleshooter'Annie Horniman used tactics like a Managing Director during a takeover. Eventually she wassuccessful in getting, such the secret groups as the Sphere Group banned from the Order. When itcame to Temple politics Florence Farr was no match for Annie Horniman. Having got her ownway, however, and with no more mountains to conquer, she resigned in 1903.From the latter part of 1900 to 1903, Felkin was living in Belgium and went to England onlywhen necessary. Waite, spent the time shOring up his own interests but finally decided he hadenough of the two groups and opted for separatism. Felkin then hastily returned to England to tryand stop the remaining Order disintegrating. Waite had previously named his Order the 'HolyOrder of the Golden Dawn' and Felkin called the remaining section the 'Stella Matutina' (MorningStar). Felkin, a remarkable man in many ways, had traveled the world as a missionary and was nostranger to danger. He claimed contact with his version of the Secret Chiefs whom he called the\"Sun Masters'. Some of the information given by these masters was quite interesting, and becausehe had this contact a number of Adepti who were of the Theoricus Adeptus Minor Grade decidedto elect him Chief, due to this astral contact which they felt crucial to a Chief.The particular Stella Matutina Temple Felkin controlled was called Amoun. Apart fromFelkin, its first Chiefs were J.H. Elliot and Dr. Carnegei Dickson. Felkin and Waite were still incontact though Waite at this stage started rewriting the manuscripts from the original ciphers. Ihave had a chance to examine these and there is no doubt the ciphers were largely ignored, withWaite simply modified the Mathers rituals so that the speeches were a little more pompous. Thesame magical skeleton framework existed in these rituals as it did in the first Golden Dawn ones.Felkin at this time was very interested into Freemasonry and was initiated into the Masons and theS.R.I.A. and eventually moved rapidly through the Grades. Felkin's diary notes shows that he wasinitiated into the 6 = 5 Grade of the R.R. et A.C. on June 28th, 1907 unfortunately who made thisinitiation is not recorded. Waite continued teaching with the modified rituals up to around 1914when he rewrote the rituals again, leaving the Golden Dawn behind him. From this point on, Waitewent very much his own esoteric direction.Though it is not generally known, behind Felkin, Westcott was ever present helping him atevery turn. In spite of this Westcott started to play a double game by working with Berridge'sTemple Isis. This whole relationship between Mathers and Westcott was a very strange one.Perhaps Mathers had something on Westcott? Again this is nothing but speculation. Westcott wasthe one who altered the tarot cards from the Mathers arrangement to one more acceptable to hie.Felkin's contact with the Sun Masters rapidly improved when he remarried a truly remarkablewoman of immense mediumistic gifts. It was she who acted as the channel for these masters andbrought through instructions for the Order.In the next few years Brodie Innes had a change of heart again and was promoted to 7 = 4 byMathers and his Amen Ra Temple which then came under the banner of Mathers Alpha et Omegaorganization. At this point, in the Stella Matutina, a number of the Adepti were pressing Felkin for29"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"the higher rituals and teachings of the second Order. Without Mathers, being the guiding geniusbehind the Stella Matutina meant that there were no new rituals or teachings. Brodie Lutes tried toconvert Felkin back to the fold by telling him of his newly promoted Grade and of the additional-teachings for these Grades\". Felldn at that stage was a nominal 7 = 4 but could not bring himselfto go back to Mathers.Numerous trips were made to the continent by Felkin to try and contact the Third Order thatMathers spoke of but all were in vain. Just after 1911 Felkin met with R. Steiner, the Theosophist,and was admitted to a meeting of what he considered the Third Order in the flesh. Since heconsidered Steiner as his superior in every way he reported to England that he now had the Gradesand support of the Third Order. Some of his colleagues were still skeptical. What had happened infact was that Steiner was a member of an umbrella occult organization which many societies in it.Steiner was the chairman at the time Felkin approached him, through Masonic contacts and Felkinwas given a probationary seat on the council which gave certain privileges. Since the StellaMatutina was now a probationary member of this council Felkin claimed the title of 8 = 3 in rank.From Steiner he brought back the Process teachings of the aura and certain breathingexercises, as well as the Ritual of the Transmission of the Etheric Link\". Also he had brought backthe 7 = 4 and the 6 = 5 rituals. When he returned to England he put some of the Adepti through the-6 = 5 rituals (such as Yeats) and used the old Theoricus Adeptus study course for the 6 = 5 andpart of the Practicus Adeptus Minor study course for the 7 = 4. Unfortunately Waite held thesepapers and would not give them to Felkin sd the good doctor had to make do with what he had.In 1912 he went to New Zealand and established Whare Ra Temple there under the Order ofthe Smaragdum Thalasses (Emerald of the Seas) which was part of the Stella Matutina. Heremained there for three months and left his daughter behind for another three months to give-further instruction. She was 6 = 5 by now and his wife was 7 = 4. During his first visit he initiatedtwelve members into the 5 = 6 Grade after an intensive training period and the new Temple was.formed. The first three Chiefs were Reginald Gardiner and Mason and John Chambers\".Returning to England, then Germany for more meetings with Steiner Felkin found himselfcaught up in Germany in the in the First World War and escaped only through his Masoniccontacts.In 1916 Felkin founded the Hermes Temple in Bristol with the Chiefs being Mrs.M.Mackenzie, Miss C.Hughes (both New Zealanders) and Miss Stevens. Mrs. Mackenzie and MissStevens were subsequently promoted to 8 = 3 and Miss Hughes 9 = 260 in rank. The MerlinTemple was also founded with Webber-Smith, Peter Birchall and Carnegie Dicicson61 as Chiefs. Athird Temple was then formed which was exclusive to S.R.I.A. members only with Hammond,Dickson and Cadbury Jones. Miss C.M.Stoddard was Chief of Amoun along with Hammond (whowas also Chief of the SRIA Temple) and the Rev. Heazell. I am unaware of what time this Templeclosed.In approximately 1930 a Temple or Order was formed which in its later days was called`Order of Light and Darkness' it was founded by Countess Tamara Rakoczy Bourken (Grandmaster of Co-Masonry in England), and a Dr. Roger Hunt also had a prominent part in its makeup.-My sources inform me that the Temple was founded with the help of members of the secondAmoun Temple62, and whose Chiefs were the Rev. Hugh Evelyn Lee63 and Dr. Carnegie Dicksonwho must hold some sort of record for being the Chief in a number of Golden Dawn or StellaMatutina Temples. I am unaware if this Temple still survives at present.To return to Felkin's departure from England and immigration to New Zealand in 191664, he,his wife and daughter subsequently took the place of the previous Chiefs in Whare Ra Temple.Although Felkin was S.R.I.A. connected he never put his authority into practice though did initiatetwo Fraters of that organization straight into the 5 = 6 Grade in the City of Christchurch and yetanother S.R.I.A. Temple was established but this became infertile. Felkin's diary shows that on 6thof May 1922 he and his wife and daughter all 'accepted the Grade' at Whare Ra. This was probablythe 9 = 2 Grade of Magus.30"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"In Paris, Mathers died in 1918 (as a result of the world wide influenza epidemic) and Moinareturned to England where she lived until 1929. From the time of the split in the Golden Dawn in1900, the main area that Mathers and his wife concentrated on was America where they had amembership well in excess of the Golden Dawn in England. The American branch of the Order,like their British counterparts reverted to the name Alpha et Omega. In or around 1913 Mathersand his wife visited the American Temples\". The first three Chiefs of the Thoth Hermes Templewere the Lockwoods and Michael Whitty . In 1912 Paul Foster Case, Michael Whitty and CharlesAtkins\"' published the book Kybalion under the authorship of the Three Initiates'''. On Whitty'sdeath, Paul Foster Case succeeded him as Praemonstrator and Gertrude Wise as Imperator withAitken as Cancellarius. These three eventually were the last Chiefs of the Thoth-Hennes Templeunder the Alpha et Omega until about 1921 when Moina Mathers expelled them from the Orderafter a bitter disagreement about magical teachings. Case then took over most of the running of theother Temples and formed the Builders of the Adytum (BOTA)68 and had as a type of Outer Orderthe School of Ageless Wisdom. This Outer Order name was abandoned when Case went toCalifornia in favor of BOTA.The big objection Case had against the Order teachings was the use of the Enochian tabletswhich he felt helped towards the demise of his friend Whitty. He still used the Enochian system inhis new Order but altered the structure of the tablets with something he felt was safes. He alsoretained the seven sided vault but to his own design. The Tarot of the Golden Dawn wassubstituted for one very much like Rider-Waite Pack published some years earlier'', though thebasic meanings as utilized in the Golden Dawn were retained. The rituals of this organization werestill very much those of the Golden Dawn in symbology but these were gradually changed. Casestill used the Golden Dawn framework and at that time claimed guidance from his own SecretChiefs and like Mathers before him took his teaching direction from that source.Whether or not one can include BOTA as part of the Golden Dawn is a moot point today• with many arguments both for and against, but in essence the teachings are the same, though moreprolific in BOTA' s case. Once in the Inner Order of BOTA and the Golden Dawn no distinction isgenerally made and many consider them as part of the same Rosicrucian Order.In 1982, Paul Clark (a one time stewareor assistant of Anne Davies who took over therunning of BOTA after the death of Case) broke away from BOTA and formed the 'Fraternity ofthe Hidden Light,' which is a Golden Dawn Order, in Los Angeles. This organization now has fiveTemples in the U.S.A. and Canada. In many respects Paul Clark has reversed the position of theGolden Dawn in America in the first quarter of this century and where Case changed them to the`School of Wisdom', Clark is returning the favor by bringing them back to their Golden Dawnroots.The AO. Order continued in England, in one way or another, until the early 1950's. Therewas one Temple in Scotland (A0.2) and two in London, Englane. Historical notes simply referto these English Temples as A.0.173 and A.0.374. Some of the last Chiefs of A.0.3 Temple, wereMrs. Simpson (who took over from Moina Mathers when she died in 1929), Mrs Boyd, along withLangford Garstin. Though this Temple officially finished at the outbreak of the Second World War,in 1939 it was revived in a loose form by its former members initiating others until the early 1950'swhen it simply disintegrated. According to my sources, Maiya Tranchell- Hayes (Mrs. Curtis-Webb) and her husband were the Chiefs of A.0.1 but closed this Temple in 1939 also.There have been some rumors that a friend of Moina Mathers, one Gerald Heym75, wasgiven a charter to establish a Temple in France but investigations into this by French occultists haveneither proved nor disproved it though I have been assured that it is highly unlikely.76. Back inNew Zealand, Felkin died in 1926 and Reginald Gardiner was offered Chieftainship once again.Whare Ra Temple withdrew from the Stella Matutina Order in 1933. In 1959 Reginald Gardinerdied and his son in law, John von Dadelszen was made Chief in his place. Mrs. Felkin died thesame year and her place was taken by Archie Shaw. In 1962 Miss Felkin died and her place wastaken by Nancy Hobson. Anne Davies came to New Zealand to form a BOTA organization in that31"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"country and this was greatly helped by a number of members of Whare Ranwho decided to leaveWhare Ra and elected to follow the Case come Anne Davies style of teachings which were and arestill closely allied to that of the Golden Dawn. In 1964 Archie Shaw walked out of Whare Ra dueto quarrels with von Dadelszen and his place was taken by Bettany Jones. These were the last ofthe Chiefs for they closed down the Temple in 1978 after they found or rather felt a lack of spiritualguidance. All former Chiefs have since died.78In the Hermes Temple in Bristol in the 1934, a young man by the name of Francis Regardiejoined the Stella Matutina. He was a former secretary and student of Aleister Crowley, but finallybroke from the latter to experience the Golden Dawn teachings first hand. After a two year staywith this Temple he eventually left for America where he had planned to start a Golden DawnTemple. On arriving back in the United States Regardie found that the temperament of theAmericans would not suit that of the Golden Dawn and abandoned his plans to form any Templethere.8°Regardie was worried that the Hermes Temple would close and the system of the GoldenDawn would cease to exist. He therefore began to publish his papers up to the 5 = 6 level. Theimpact from this act of his is almost so vast that it cannot be judged adequately for it opened thedoor for a revival of the magical tradition. Thousands have studied the Golden Dawn from thesevolumes both privately and in Temples. Since the end of the war until the 1970's Regardie did notplay much of an active part in occultism apart from his study of alchemy in the mid 1960's. Thisfurther inspired him to initiate a small number into the Inner Order in the 1970's.81The Hermes Temple in Bristol closed down in 1960, according to JOhn von Dadelszen whovisited England at that time. The only Chief's name that I am aware of at the closure was Mrs.Carnegie Dickson. Those younger members of that Temple protested vigorously but to no availthough, according to Bettany Jones, in a conversation with her in the early 1980's, she informed methat its members still met on a regular basis and still kept in touch with ex-members of Whare Ra•Temple.Also, in or around 1960 a Golden Dawn Temple of sorts was established with MadelineMontabiban as its Chief in London. I am led to believe that the Temple is now defunct.The introduction of my wife Chris and I to the Golden Dawn came initially from readingRegardie's work and then being eventually linked up to a former ffierophant of Whare Ra Temple,Jack Taylor who tutored, bullied and instructed us in the Golden Dawn teachings until his death in1985. To my mind, Taylor was a ritualistic genius and could do things to you during ritual that Ihave never perceived before in any human being. At Whare Ra the Adepti were taught that therituals were really the only thing that mattered and the study procedure along the way was-additional dogma and not essential to develop. My own viewpoint is that one necessitates the otheras ability must have a framework to work through and this is where the additional study of thelectures provided channels that opened new energies in the Adept.Taylor chartered us a Temple in 1982 which we called Thoth-Hermes and he became a Chief(in absentee) along with my wife and I. After his death another Frater took over as Chief.However, we were not the only ones taught the Golden Dawn teachings by ex-Whare Ra members.-Another former member, Frank Salt, also has initiated at least one into the 5 = 6 level in 1989 andanother Frater, Percy Wilkinson82 in early 1990, helped a small group by issuing a charter toestablishing a Golden Dawn Temple in Havelock North. In many ways the Whare Ra tradition hasrefused to die. Though many of its members would have preferred it so while others have tried topass on their knowledge to others. A 7 = 4 was also issued by Archie Shaw.In 1983 Regardie and the hierophant of the then Los Angeles Temple, Patricia Behman,visited us in New Zealand and it was here that he rejoined the Golden Dawn and was given thehigher Grades for his life time devotion to the work. On Regardie's encouragement the Chiefs ofThoth-Hermes promoted Patricia Behman to the level of 6 = 5 during that visit. At Thoth-Hermeswe appreciated Regardie's view of publication of Order material and his short stay in Wellingtonwas very fruitful to all of us. It was Regardie who encouraged us to publish the material we had32"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"received from Whare Ra along with our own researches.In 1988, two former students of Regardie, Laura Jennings and Peter Yorke, who were onetime co-chiefs of the Los Angeles Temple with Patricia Behman, invited me to travel to LosAngeles where I undertook a series of lectures and instructions in the Golden Dawn tradition wherethey had formed a new Golden Dawn Temple\". During that time I was pleasantly surprised to findthat the Temple was well run and the rituals were well practiced. The Golden Dawn rituals astaught under both these Adepti are as good if not better than those undertaken in any of the oldGolden Dawn or Stella Matutina Temples. A charter84was issued to them and where they carriedon the tradition of teaching in America in a direct line from the New Zealand Order, but are nowretired.At this point the concept of the higher Grades should be discussed. Before their deaths, I hadthe chance to talk to two former Chiefs of Whare Ra on the subject of the higher Grades and whatwas expected of them. In recent years these Grades have been critised by some writers, who havenot themselves experienced them. These criticisms are based on pure speculation. In the StellaMatutina and even in the Golden Dawn proper it was not generally thought by all that anyone whoreached the rank of 8 = 3 and above had reached the Third Order. Admittedly some of the Chiefsthought so, mainly this was done to enhance their own position, but not the rank and file of theOrder. The Third Order was considered an. Order in the physical realm, based in some unknownplace and that continued to guide the training and teachings of various Adepts. In contrast to theThird Order, the 'Secret Chiefs' or 'Astral Masters' as they have been called, relates to contactsfrom the Higher Planes coming through which is generally more personal than anything else. In theGolden Dawn a numb& of its members confused the two.\"Within this century the higher Grades of the Order86were given out in appreciation of bothservice to the Temple and to the ability of the Adepti. Membership of the Third Order has nothingto do with it. The Higher Grades take on the same value as those given out in the Masons and the. S.R.I.A. Mathers claimed the 8 = 3 before his deatealong with Moina. Although I am unaware ofthe exact time he took that Grade he too, in his later days, looked upon the Grades in that samemanner88. When asked today if modern Golden Dawn Temples believe in the Third Order themajority of them will say no. They do believe in guidance from Higher Planes though and as statedabove this is a distinctly different concept. In the old Golden Dawn a number of Adepts claimedthis but none (to my knowledge) claimed contact with the Third Order save Mathers and Fellcin andthe latter changed his mind on that subject as I am sure Mathers did also before his death. In the`Rebirth of Magic', Francis King gives an example of Paul Foster Case who made contact with aMaster in the flesh or with an emissary of one.In 1983 my first book Secret Inner Order Rituals of the Golden Dawn, was published. In it Igave out the 6 = 5 and 7 = 4 rituals created by Felkin plus some previously unpublished GoldenDawn teachings. I did this in order to open up the teaching of the Order at the higher levels and forthose Temples who worked the Golden Dawn system and wanted the rituals for these Grades.When this book was published in New Zealand it created quite an uproar. I had sent the manuscriptaround to at least half a dozen members of the old Temple to check on its historical accuracy andgot from them a clean bill of health, so to speak. I later found out from other ex-members of theold Temple that they were dissatisfied with the slant of the historical section of the book. I soonlearnt that you cannot please all the people all of the time. Some considered it outrageous that thesacred rituals should be published. The local bookseller in Havelock North (where Whare Ra stoodfor over 60 years) had found that the publication of this book was untimely in the fact that itcoincided with the death of the last chief, John von Dadelszen, and she did not put the book on theshelf until after his death for fear of upsetting ex-members.Since the publication of Regardie's Golden Dawn, Temples have sprung up almost on aglobal basis and the Order today, though fragmented, has far more followers than it ever had at thetime of its peak, and from all accounts this list seems to have been growing. I hope it will continueto grow for many years to come.33"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"My own personal dream is for the Golden Dawn to flourish and to develop, not stagnate at1900 or even at 1978 when Whare Ra, the last of the original Temples closed down. In many waysI feel we are rather fortunate to live in New Zealand and practice the Golden Dawn in teachings inisolation for we are out of the influence of the mainstream of Occultism in Europe and America, yetthere are more high ranking members of the Golden Dawn in New Zealand than anywhere else.Many of them have devoted a lifetime's study to the Order and its work. Many of them have givenus their support over the years and some still continue to do so. It is because of them that thisGolden Dawn series is now possible.34"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"35"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"0 = 0The Neophyte CeremonyofThe 'VVhare Ra TempleOfficersOn the DaisImperator(red robe, lamen, Sword)Praemon.strator (blue robe, lamen, Scepter)Cancellarius(yellow robe, lamen, Scepter)Past Hierophant (red robe, lamen, Scepter)Hierophant(red robe, lamen, crown-headed Scepter)In the HallHiereus(black robe, lamer, Sword)Hegemon(white robe, lamen, Mitre-headed Scepter)Kerux(lamen, lamp, wand)Stolistes(lamen, cup of lustral water)Dadouchos(lamen, thurible)Sentinel(lamen, Sword)RequirementsRed Rose, Lamp, Chalice, Paten with Salt and BreadCross and Triangle, roll of MembershipHoodwink, Sample Sash, Chemical change(Note:- In all following ceremonies where 'Prater' is stated, this can be replaced by `Soror' wherethe candidate or officer is female.)Opening(When Members are assembled and clothed Hierophant gives one knock)(Kerux goes to right of Hierophant, faces.

The Four Triangles, whose 12 angles each touch one of the 12circles, are those of Fire, Earth, Air, and Water, and allude to the four Triplicities of theZodiac Signs. The Triangle inscribed within each of the 12 circles, alludes to the 3Decanates, or phases of 10 degrees of each sign.

He hath assignedunto them the Twelve Constellations of the Universe.(Puts Cross aside.)The 32nd Path of the Sepher Yetzirah, which answer unto Mallcuth and the Letter Tau, iscalled 'The Administrative Intelligence,' and it is so-called because it directeth and alsoassociateth in all their operations, the Seven Planets, even all of them in their own duecourses. To it, therefore, is attributed the due knowledge of the Seven Abodes in the Houseof Assiah, the Material World, which are symbolized in the Apocalypse by the SevenChurches. It refers to the Universe as composed of the Four Elements, to the Kerubim, tothe Qlippoth, and to the Astral Plane. It is the Reflection of the Sphere of Saturn. Itrepresents the connecting and binding link between the Material and Formative Worlds,Assiah and Yetzirah, and necessarily passes through the Astral Plane, the Abode of theElementals and the Shells of the Dead. It is the Rendering of the Veil of the Tabernacle,whereon the Kerubim and the Palm Trees are depicted. It is the Passing of the Gate ofEden.(Leads Zelator to West of Altar.)These ideas are symbolically resumed in the representation of the 21st Key of the Tarot, infront of you. Within the Oval formed of 72 circles, is a female form. Nude, save for a scarfthat floats around her. She is crowned with the Lunar Crescent of Isis and holds in herhands, two wands. Her legs form a Cross. She is the Bride of the Apocalypse, theKabbalistic Queen of the Canticles, the Egyptian Isis of Nature, now shown partly unveiled,the Great Feminine Kerubic Angel Sandalphon on the left hand of the Mercy Seat of theArk. The two Wands are the directing forces of the positive and negative currents. TheSeven Pointed Heptagram or Star alludes to the Seven Palaces of Assiah; the crossed legs tothe symbol of the Four Letters of the Name. The surmounting crescent receives theinfluences of Geburah and Gedulah. She is the synthesis of the 32 Path, uniting Malkuth toYesod. The oval of 72 smaller circles refers to the Schemhamphoresch or Seventy-twoFold Name of the Deity. The twelve larger circle form the Zodiac. At the angles are theFour Kerubim which are the vivified powers of the Name of Yod Heh Vau Heh operatingthe Elements, through which you have just symbolically passed in the preceding Ceremony.The Fan, Lamp, Cup and Salt represent the Four Elements themselves whose inhabitants arethe Sylphs, Salamanders, Undines and Gnomes.

For thou mustnot behold it ere thy body is purged by the Sacred Rites. Since ever dragging down theSoul and leading it from sacred things, from the confines of Matter, arise the terrible Dog-- faced Demons, never showing a true image unto mortal gaze. So therefore first the Priest,who governeth the works of Fire, must sprinkle with the lustral Water of the loudresounding sea. Labor thou around the Strophalos of Hecate.

But its meaning is far moreOccult and recondite than this, for it is a glyph of the Powers of Fire. The Angel encircledby a rainbow whence leap coruscations of Fire, and crowned with the Sun, representsMichael, the Great Archangel- the Ruler of Solar Fire. The Serpents which leap in therainbow are symbols of the Fiery Seraphim. The Trumpet represents the influence of theSpirit descending from Binah, while the Banner with the Cross refers to the Four Rivers ofParadise, and the Letters of the Holy Name. He also is Axieros the first of theSamodn-acian Kabiri, as well as Zeus and Osiris. The left hand figure below rising from theEarth, is Samael, the ruler of Volcanic Fire. He is also Axiokersos the Second Kabir, andTyphon or Pluto. The right hand figure below is Anael, the Ruler of the Astral Light; she isalso Axiokersa, the Third Kabir, Ceres and Persephone, Isis and Nephthys; she is thereforerepresented in a duplicated form, and rising from the Water.

He is also Kasmillos the Candidate in the Samothracian Mysteries, and theHorus of Egypt. He rises from the rock-hewn cubical tomb, and he also alludes to theCandidate who traverses the Path of Fire.

The Circle denotes theSun and Gold; the Crescent, the Moon and Silver; respectively analogous to the Red andWhite Natures. The Cross is the symbol of corrosion, and the corrosion of metals is usuallyof the complementary color to that which they naturally approximate. Thus Copper whichis reddish becomes green in verdigris, etc. Mercury is the only one which unites,these 3primary forms in one symbol. Saturn is composed of the Cross and the Crescent, showingthat lead is corrosive externally and Lunar internally. Jupiter is the reverse. Mars is Solarinternally but corrosive externally, while Venus is the opposite, for Copper is externally ofthe nature of Sol, but internally corrosive. Wherefore the name of the Sphere of Venus,Nogah, denotes 'External Splendor.'(Hegemon leads Theoricus to diagram of Tarot Trumps with Hebrew Alphabet.)Hiereus:This shows the true and genuine attribution of the Tarot Trumps to the Hebrew Alphabet,which has long been a secret among the 'Initiates', and which should be carefully concealedfrom the outer world.

Italso alludes to the Eternal River of Eden divided into Four Heads which find their correlation's inthe Four Triplicities of the Zodiac.(Places Cross aside.)The 29th Path of the Sepher Yetzirah which answereth to the letter Qoph, is called `TheCorporeal Intelligence,' and it is so called because it formeth every body which is formed beneaththe whole Order of Worlds, and the Increment of them.

Andthrough it do the Waters of Chesed flow down.(Hierophant, Hegemon and Fractious come to West of Altar.)Before you upon the Altar is the 18th Key of the Tarot, which symbolically resumes these ideas.It represents the Moon with four Hebrew Yods, like drops of dew falling, two dogs, two towers,a winding pathway leading to the horizon, and in the foreground, Water, with a crayfish crawlingthrough it towards the land. The Moon is in the increase on the side of Gedulah, and from itproceed sixteen principal and sixteen secondary rays, which together make 32, the number of thePaths of the Yetzirah. She is the Moon at the feet of the Woman of the Revelation, rulingequally over Cold and Moist Natures, and the Passive Elements of Earth and Water. The fourHebrew Yods refer to the Four Letters of the Holy Name reconstituting the destroyed Worldfrom the Waters. It is to be noted that the symbol of the Sign Pisces is formed of the two lunarcrescents of Gedulah and Geburah bound together, and thus shows the lunar nature of the Sign.The Dogs are the Jackals of the Egyptian Anubis, guarding the Gates of the East and of theWest, shown by the two Towers, between which lies the Path of all the Heavenly Bodies everrising in the East and setting in the West. The Crayfish is the sign Cancer, and was anciently theScarabeus or Kephra, the Emblem of the Sun below the horizon as he ever is when the Moon isincreasing above. Also when the Sun is in the Sign Pisces, the Moon will be well in her increasein Cancer as shown by the Crayfish emblem.119"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"(Hierophant leads Practicus to Tablet of the Serpent of Brass in East)This is the Serpent Nehushtan which Moses made when the Children of Israel were bitten by theSerpents of Fire in the Wilderness.

And the word used in thepassage in Numbers 21 for Fiery Serpents, is the same as the name of the Angels of Geburah, thesame spelling, the same pointing, Seraphim, around the middle Pillar of the Sephiroth, becausethat is the Reconciler between the Fires of Geburah and Severity, and the Waters of Chesed orMercy and hence it is said in the New Testament, that it is a type of Christ, the Reconciler. Andthe Serpent is of Brass, the Metal of Venus, whose Sphere is called Nogah or External Splendor,as shown thither in the Alchemical symbol of the Planet Venus, wherein the circle of the Sun isexalted above the Cross of Corrosion. And therefore it is said in the Zohar, that alone of theShells is the Serpent Nogah found in Holiness, and he is called the Balance of Justice. Why thenis he called, the External or false Splendor? Because he indeed uniteth the Paths butcomprehendeth not the Sephiroth. Nevertheless he is also the Celestial Serpent of Wisdom. Butthe Serpent of Temptation is the Serpent of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil and notthat of the Tree of Life.(Hierophant resumes his seat.

In the lower the chambers are arranged according to the Sephiroth.This Tablet ('indicating it) represents the method of forming the Tree of Life in the Tarot. Thefour Aces are placed on the Throne of Kether. The remaining small cards of each suit desiredare then placed on the respective Sephiroth, 2 on Chokmah, 3 on Binah and so on. The 22Trumps are then arranged on the letters of the Paths between them. The King and Queen of theSuit are placed beside Chokmah and Binah respectively, the Knight beside Tiphareth and theKnave beside Malkuth, thus representing the attribution of the Sephiroth to the four letters of theHoly Name in the World wherein they operate.(Hegemon lends Practicus to Tablet of the Three Pillars in South.)Hegemon:This Tablet represents the formation of the Hexagram of Tiphareth from the Pillars on each side.In Chesed is the Water and in Geburah is the Fire, and in Tiphareth is the uniting andreconciliation of both Triangles in the Hexagram, as Aleph forms the reconciliation betweenMem and Shin so thus stands the reconciling Pillar between the Pillars of Fire and of Cloud; theJachin and Boaz of the Porch of Solomon's Temple.(Hegemon leads Practicus to Tablet in North)The mode of using the Talismanic Forms drawn from the Geomantic figures, is to take thoseformed by the figures under the Planet required and place them at the opposite ends of a wheel of8 radii as shown.

In the Egyptian sense it is Sirius, theDog Star of Isis Sothis; around it are the Stars of the 7 Planets, each with its sevenfoldcounterchanged operation. The nude female figure with the Star of the Heptagram on her Browis the synthesis of Isis, of Nephthys and of Athor. She also represents the Planet Venus, throughwhose Sphere the influences of Chesed descend. She is Aima,-Binh and Tebunah, the GreatSupernal Mother, Aima Elohim pouring upon the Earth the Waters of Creation, which unite andform a river at her feet; the river going forth from the Supernal Eden, which overfloweth andfaileth not. Note well that in this Key she is completely unveiled, while in the 21st Key, she isonly partly so. The two Urns contain the Influences from Chokmah and Binah. On the rightsprings the Tree of Life and on the left the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, whereon thebird of Hennes alights.

You will note that the spelling of the letter Yod alone altersnot. It is a symbol of the unchangeableness of the First Cause. The total of the spelling in eachWorld, is then expressed in Hebrew Letters and makes the secret name of that World. Thu's, inAtziluth the total is 72, and the secret name Aub, in Binah 63 Seg, in Yetzirah 45 Mah and inAssiah 52 Ben.(Indicating the second Tablet.)In the Tablet is shown the method of writing the Hebrew words by the Yetziratic attribution ofthe Alphabet, whence results some curious hieroglyphic symbolism. Thus, Tetragrammaton willbe written by Vugo, Aries, Taurus, Aries. Eheieh by Air, Aries, Virgo, Aries; from Yeheshuah,the Qabalistic mode of spelling Jesus, which is simply the Tetragrammaton, with the letter Shinplaced therein, we obtain a very peculiar combination; Virgo, Aries, Fire, Taurus, Aries; Virgoborn of a Virgin, Aries the Sacrificial Lamb; Fire the Fire of the Holy Spirit; Taurus the Ox ofEarth, in whose manger he was laid; and lastly Aries, the flocks of sheep whose herdsmen cameto worship him. Elohim yields Air, Libra, Aries; Virgo, Water; the Firmament, the BalancedForce, the Fire of the Spirit (for Aries is a fiery sign operating in the Zodiac) the Virgin Goddessand the Waters of Creation. Returning to the spelling of Yeheshuah, it is easy to see that theLamb is an appropriate symbol of Jesus, from the prevalence of the Aries symbol, whose Fire issubdued and modified by its other associations.(Hierophant returns to his seat.

MacGregor MathersThe above saying was a favorite of Mathers, showing his aspirations in attaining Adeptship.In the Golden Dawn, Godforms from various cultures were considered as currents or potencies ofenergies that could be tapped and directed to perform a desired task.In the original Golden Dawn, these energies had not been adequately explained on anyreasonable basis. In the New Zealand Order though, these energies were dissected and categorizedin much the same way as one peels of the layers of an onion. This approach is needed to revealtheir hidden meanings, as many of the rituals and practices of the Golden Dawn are extremelycomplex.The rituals, the props and the energies of the various Godforms, amount to what could bedescribed as a mass attack on the psyche of the individual. Those who go through the Ceremonieswith full props, or as in an astral Temple when the Ceremony is done without props, will experiencechanges in their lives. Some experience a dramatic shock then and there during the Ceremonyitself, while others noticed changes in themselves months after.It will become obvious as one studies both the Outer Order and Inner Order rituals that thereare six major currents applied during ritual. They are the currents of Thoth, Isis, Horus, Nephthys,Osiris and Christ. These can be fused together when needed to produce a very potent force, withthe currents of the minor Godforms working under these main ones. All other energies take a backseat to these energies, because it is they who give the other powers a chance to operate duringritual. How this comes about can be best explained in a speech from the Neophyte Ritual:Let the number of the Officers in this degree and the nature of their Offices beproclaimed once again, that the powers whose images they are may be re-awakenedin the Spheres of those present, and in the sphere of this Order, for by the names andimages are all powers awakened and re-awakened.This speech by the Hierophant gives the whole concept of Golden Dawn ritual work. Themain effort for the Adept is to discern and record what energies govern what areas of whatceremonies.The published rituals of the Golden Dawn give only the barest hint as to what exactly happensin ceremonies like the Neophyte. Taylor revealed to us that before each Grade Ceremony, theHierophant would go to the Temple, and with his Sphere of Sensation (aura), link directly into theastral shells of each of the Godforms in the rituals. Taking the Neophyte Ceremony as an example,the Hierophant would have to `bring through' the astral shells of (1) the Osiris Godform on thedais, (2) the Officers of the Temple and (3) the Invisible Stations. This is an example of the verbalinformation that the former Hierophant would divulge and show to the present Hierophant after theEquinox Ceremony (providing the present never held the Hierophant position before). Thispractice was not restricted to a particular Grade, but to the `Office'. Some of those Hierophantswho were 6 = 5 or 7 = 4, and who never held the position before, might be shown this by aHierophant of the 5 = 6 Grade.It must be also considered that while the Stella Matutina had quite a few short comings,practical ritual (within the New Zealand Order at least) was not one of them. The original GoldenDawn only had a functioning Outer Order for no more than 12 years (from 1888 to 1900), while theInner Order lasted eight years (1892-1900). -It is also quite obvious that the. Z-1 and Z-3141"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"-clairvoyant descriptions of the Neophyte Ceremony were done very early, possibly within aboutthree years or so of the first. Neophyte Ceremony, and left much to be analyzed.Within the Stella Matutina for example, they had another 70 years of life, and a number ofthose who were clairvoyant had the opportunity to test their theories and pass this information ontothose they trained. What a lot of writers seem to forget is that the Stella Matutina was, in itsbeginning, made up of Golden Dawn Adepti trained by Mathers, Florence Farr, and others of equalnotoriety. It did not, at 1900, suddenly cease to exist and redirect its magical power. It had awealth of unpublished information to offer, and what is not told is that much of this information wasverbal and pertained to ritual.Though the Whare Ra Temple withdrew from the Stella Matutina in 1931, no changes weremade to its rituals (which were not the watered down versions the English Temples used, but were-the original Golden Dawn rituals). This was driven home to us when, through Taylor's efforts, wewere fortunate enough to meet a number of ex-Whare Ra members whose skill at ritual couldsimply be described as astounding, even though they had little scholarship. This of course did notapply to all Temple members, but to a select few who held the main Officer positions for up totwenty years with barely any interruption. By this, I mean Officers who for the main part werecontinually re-elected, during the latter part of Whare Ra's history.We became the recipients of their expertise, and from this teaching gradually became aware ofthe existence of the six main Golden Dawn currents. One of the strange things we found out is thatwhile each Temple Officer knew of each others respective positions, few if any, had any idea of-what their counterparts were doing. With Taylor's influence however, we managed to gather thisinformation collectively for operation in the Thoth Hermes Temple. Apparently, the snobbishstructure of Whare Ra prevented this type of communication between Temple members, and few-had any real idea of their fellow members real potential, other than of their direct seniors in chargeof ritual.Take the Neophyte Ceremony again as an example. After the Hierophant activates the astralshells, they stay activated until the Hierophant breaks the etheric link, for it is he that activates thecurrent of Osiris. When the Officers take their places on the floor of the Temple at the beginning ofthe ceremony, the activated shells of the Godforms then link with their physical auras. Because ofthe delicate nature of this linking (these auric shells are sometimes seen clairvoyantly as light greenin color), it must be done correctly on two levels: the first by the Hierophant, and the second by theTemple Officer. In the old Order, the Temple Officers were from lower Outer Order. Grades, butwith the discoveries of those Adepti of Whare Ra (whose Temple Officers were almost alwaysInner Order), it's quite clear that all the Officers on the Temple floor should be Inner Order tocorrectly control the power and direct it.. For they have to manipulate their own Sphere ofSensation and vibrate it to the rhythm of the ritual they are doing.While the Hierophant of the Temple creates the astral shells before the ritual starts, this doesnot extend to the astral shells of the Godforms on the dais, (apart from his own Osiris shell). Theseare, in fact, activated by the Officers on the dais, with the Imperator linking with the Nephthyscurrent, the Praemonstrator the Isis current, the Cancellarius the Thoth current. Instead of sittingand observing the rituals, they in fact have a great deal of work to do which gives the Hierophantthe much needed boost to the Ceremony. They also control flow rates of power as well. Out of allthese currents, the most important of all is the Thoth current, for without it the rituals become meredramatic gestures. The Z-1 Document, prefaced by the General Exordium, is a fair indication of thepowers and duties of Thoth.Once all the physical Temple props are in place, the Officers vacate the Temple, about onehour before the start of the Ceremony, so that the Hierophant can enter. It is he who must createthe astral shells of the various Godforms and energize them according to the Temple floor plan.This is done with each Godform on an individual basis. It is extremely important that each astralshell be in its correct size, shape, and color. These are brought as close to the stage ofmanifestation as possible by the Hierophant. He will, through his own aura, know exactly how far142"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"to activate them. This would still be considered on a low vibrational scale. It is accomplishedthrough the use of the `DWB' (Divine White Brilliance or as it is sometimes called, the LVXformula) which links together the Nephesch and the Ruach of the Hierophant. The shells of theseGodforms are, at this point, linked to the Ruach of the Hierophant. They can be considered as atype of blind force at a low vibrational pitch. They are not fully activated and could be described asthe Nephesch of themselves.Within the Golden Dawn, the creation and utilisation of these Godforms was done at anumber of different levels, and for many different reasons. Their use in rituals like the 0 = 0 ismainly two-fold. The first is the building up of the Godform so that you can link your energy to it,so that you can draw from its power by complete identification, and absorption of its qualities. Anexample of this is given by Regardie in his Golden Dawn, the Ritual for Transformation.Within the Neophyte Ceremony, another aspect is then approached with the formation ofmore than one Godform in the astral, so that each force will counterbalance the other. The formulaby which this is done is:(1)The banishing Ritual of the Pentagram.(2)By AHIH (bring down the power) to the Tiphareth centre where the names of theGodforms are formulated in white.(3)Vibratory formula of the name of each Godfonn - as many times as there are letters intheir names .(4)Project the rose ray into the astral and then create them.The colors of these Temple Godforms are extremely important. While the power of theRuach initially forms their astral shell, their flashing colors are needed to attract the power that theGodform represents. The Mathers papers on `Telesmatic Images' explains how this is done:Now there is also a mode whereby, combining the letters, the colors, theattributions of their Synthesis, thou mayest build up a Telesmatic Image of a Force.The Sigil shall serve Thee for tracing of a Current which shall call into action acertain Elemental Force. And know thou that this is not to be done lightly for thineamusement or experimentation, seeing that the Forces of Nature were not created tobe thy plaything or toy. Unless you do practical magical works with solemnity,ceremony and reverence, thou shalt be like an infant playing with fire ...Though this paper is related to telesmatic figures, the same fundamental principles offormulation in the astral still apply. The sigils referred to here are the ones traced from the rosecross (see Golden Dawn Flying Rolls 2 and 6 for correct use of this method).In general, the ray with the name projected from the Tiphareth center, will perform much thesame function. This whole procedure can be quite exhausting and is generally done from a paper,with names, colors, and sigils of the Invisible Stations used as a prompt. In his book, Energy,Prayer and Relocation, Regardie says,The ancient custom was to image the form of the God, a fairly commonpictograph, and whilst uttering the prayer to feel that this Godform enveloped thebody of the invoker.This is, of course, another method of creating the astral shell of the Godform by the use ofprayer. The first method, quoted above, was the one taught to Taylor, who was a stickler that onemust always have the form on paper, in front of one, before the invocations are begun. ThoughHierophants are expected to know every shape and position of a Godform by heart, the Godformformulation is generally done from a Temple diagram so that no mistakes can be made.143"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The robes of the Officers also play an important part. When the astral shells of the Godformare created, they are linked to the robes and badges of the Officers who are placed in the positionsthey occupy around the Hall.At this point we should mention that, in the Golden Dawn and the early stages of the StellaMatutina, the Temple Officers on the floor could be Outer Order Grades. However, the 78additional years of ritual of the Stella Matutina, have shown that the energy fields, that these juniorOfficers have to work with, are extremely more complex than was first thought. In the later yearsof the Stella Matutina and the Smaragdum Thalasses, here in New Zealand, it was thought thatthese floor Officers should all be Inner Group members, where possible.Prior to his or her entrance to the Temple, all Officers would sit quietly in order to link theirRuachs and Neshamahs (which under nonnal circumstances cannot be done by Outer Ordermembers). Hence, their activated Spheres of Sensations (auras) then link into, and feed, the astralshells of the Invisible Stations created by the Ifierophant. This also, to a certain extent, gives theHierophant an element of control over the stations linked to each Officer. He can, in fact, controlthe link by increasing, or decreasing, the vibrational pitch of the Godfonn, where there is an excess,or decrease, of energy. This can be brought about by the mood of the Temple Officer, in order tobalance things together in the overall floor plan.When each of these Officers takes their positions, and links their Ruachs with the Nephesch,of the form created by the Hierophant, it is important that they have a correct mental image of theGodform they are assuming. This is, in fact, Godform assumption in a group format. The Officerson the dais also have a part to play in this preparation. They usually enter, with the rest of theOfficers. Once seated on their respective thrones, they also link their Ruachs with the Nepheschshells created by the Hierophant.The stations of the Godforms used in our symbolism come under two heads:(1)Visible Stations.(A) Dais Officers(3) Floor Officers(2)Invisible Stations.The Visible Stations are the places of the Officers, each of whom has a special astral shapesuitable to the forces he represents.On the dais, are places for the Three Chiefs, the past Hierophant, and the present Hierophant.The order in which they sit (as you face East, from left to right) is:(1)Irnperator(2)Cancellarius(3)Hierophant(4)Past Hierophant(5) PraemonstratorThe god forms of this chapter come from a Mss.

There are two Godforms who also appear in two places in the same ritual, a point which puzzledus for many years, since no one had really given us a satisfactory answer as to why. Taylor just keptrefening me back to the admission badge of this grade.In the Original Golden Dawn version of this badge the North is related to Fire, not Earth, as is thePath of Samekh, for here the Aspirant gets the opportunity to experience two separate pantheons, theGolden Dawn's and the energy of the Godform itself; controlled by the Tablet of North. The Fireexperienced here is solar orientated, which, Mau as Guardian of the Fiery Shin, must also relate to aswell, being another dual form. A full explanation of this will be discussed hi a later chapter.Floor Officers:Hierophant:OsirisHiereus:SamaelHegemon:MetatronKerux:AnubisInvisible StationsStations in the Three Paths:Shin:MauTau:MutQoph:OpautStations of the Pillars:White:NekebitBlack:Uatchet151"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"East of the Altar:HarparkraatWestern entrance of the Immeasurable Region: Het-HertFour KerubimFour Children of HorusThe Forty-Two Assessors152"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"THE GODFORMS OF THE 7F.T .ATOR GRADEVisible StationsOfficers on the dais:Imperator:NephthysCancellarius:ThothSophHierophant:OsiriserPast Ilierophant:ArouerisPraemonstrator:IsisFloor Officers:Hierophant:SancialphonHiereus:SamaelHegemon:MetatronKenix:Anubis of the EastStolistes:TefnutDadouthos:ShuSentinel:Anubis of the WestInvisible StationsStations in the Three Paths:Shin:MauTau:MutiQoph:OpautStations of the Pillars:White:NekebitBlack:UatchetEast of the Altar:HarparkraatWestern entrance of the Immeasurable Region:Het-HertFour KerubimFour Children of HorusThe Forty-Two Assessors153"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The following outlines the colouring and positioning of each of the astral shells that theHierophant has to create around the Temple before the start of the ceremony.

They are Witnesses in the Judgment Hall ofOsiris.Clairvoyant members of the Order have shown that the 42 Assessors in the NeophyteCeremony are placed along the Path of Samekh and above the station of the Evil Persona. They areback to back, and form a length of 21 members. Their descriptions vary but are often seen with avariety of animal heads, holding upraised swords. Though placed along this Path, they are far fromstationary and rotate slowly, but there are always two lines of 21. Their actual function in the ritualis to create a vortex in various parts of the ceremony that enables them to directly judge theCandidate and his Higher Self (They are placed not at floor level but at a point just above the heightof the Pillars). This vortex helps keep the Higher Self safe once it has left the body of theCandidate. They also ensure that he is judged correctly and they bring to the ceremony a powerwhich is very much like that of the Canopic Gods (the Four Children of Horus) only far moredetailed. It is their function to examine the Candidate further and test him deeper and longer thanthe length of the ceremony. The 42 Assessors are said to follow and watch the Candidate as he orshe goes through each Grade and if found wanting they will immediately sever his link with theOrder with the swords they hold. In theory they remain with the Candidate until admittance to theInner Order and it is they who are sometimes responsible for people who leave the Outer Order andbar their admittance to the Inner Order.Each Assessor is related to each letter of the 42 lettered name of God (which according to anunpublished Golden Dawn manuscript by Westcott, relates to the Notariqon of the 42 virtues fromthe 3 consonants of YHVH spelled out) which governs a certain portion of man.
