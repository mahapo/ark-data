We started writing this document in1982, the year our Thoth-Hermes Temple was chartered by W. H. (Jack) Taylor. Taylor was aformer lEerophant (of 7 = 4 grade) of the New Zealand Temple, Whare Ra. The Temple wasfounded in 1912 by Dr. R. W. Felldn.The Z.5 document was originally intended to be restricted to members of the Inner Order ofThoth-Hermes. It included many of the 'word of mouth' teachings passed on by Taylor, and otherInner Order Adepti from Whare Ra, under whom we trained. The Z.5 was written to fill ininformation left out of two other Order papers, the Z.1 and Z.3. It also was designed to bridge thegap between the two papers.The Z.1 paper is a technical explanation of the meanings and descriptions of the TempleOfficers. The Z.3 is a clairvoyant description of the admission of the candidate. [The Z.1, Z.2, andZ.3 documents can be found in Book 5 of THE GOLDEN DAWN, edited by Israel Regardie,Llewellyn. The Z.1 document is titled \"Enterer of the Threshold.\" The Z.2 document is titled\"Magical Formulae,\" and the Z.3 is titled \"Symbolism of the Admission. Eds.]This book has been designed for the experienced Golden Dawn practitioner. It contains: 5 =6 explanations of the 0 = 0 Ceremony, previously unpublished teachings from the 6 = 5 and 7 = 4grades of the Stella Matutina, and later teachings from the Smaragdum Thalasses. SmaragdumThalasses is the New Zealand name given to the order after Whare Ra withdrew from the StellaMatutina in 1933.We have brought all of this information together, in a unified format, rather than stretch it outover the three Inner Order grades. Examples of this are given in \"The Control and Functions of theOfficers on the Dais,\" Chapter 2.For some readers of this book, there may be areas that are initially incomprehensible.Dedicated reading and study will eventually bring an understanding of the material presented. Forothers, who have studied on their own or through various Temples, we hope that the additionalmaterial will give more insight into the 0 = 0 grade.When we first decided to do this book, we were faced with the problem of what to do withthe existing Z.1 and Z.3 documents and their colourful, but somewhat archaic, language. We werenot sure whether to rewrite them, omit them, use only our additional material, or leave them in andblend them in, with the newer material, so that the whole package could be presented, in full.Ultimately, we chose the latter which saved the reader from going book to book trying to fit thepuzzle into place. In doing this, we have re-formatted the Z.1 and Z.3 documents, eliminatingduplicate material.The importance of understanding the technical aspects of the Neophyte Ceremony cannot beover-emphasized. It is the backbone of the Z.2 paper. This paper outlines ritual ceremony forEvocation, Consecration of Talismans, Invisibility, Transformations, Spiritual Development,Divination, and Alchemy. In the Neophyte Ritual of the Z.2, the Adept assumes the role of theHierophant. The Hierophant must understand every aspect of what is happening in the ritual so thathe can control the ceremony and give the forces life. He must also be able to dissect each layer ofthe ritual. If one area is lacking, he must be able to counter-balance the energies so that harmonyprevails throughout the ceremony.Both the Z.1 and the Z.3 documents were written very early in Golden Dawn history, around1892 or earlier - barely four years after the first Neophyte Ceremony was conducted. After this,there was little input of this depth on the subject of the Neophyte ceremony by later Temples.178"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"In 1903, the Golden Dawn split into two factions. The splinter group, led by A. E. Waite,formed the Stella Matutina, which retained the bulk of the Golden Dawn's Inner Order. Mostmembers remained in the Order until World War I. Even in the 1920s, there were still someoriginal Golden Dawn Adepti in the Stella Matutina. The 30 or so years of ritual experience gainedin both Orders were shared with other Order members. A good example of this was the HermesTemple, in Bristol, England. During the 1930s, the Hermes Temple had a number of members whohad been trained by Golden Dawn Adepti.Israel Regardie, the editor of THE GOLDEN DAWN and several books on the GoldenDawn, was a member of the Hermes Temple, in Bristol, England, during the 1930s. According tohim, when questioned on this point in 1983, his only Temple contacts during that time, were theChiefs. He never met other members, though one person came to witness the consecration of hisElemental Weapons, which some suprisingly enough considered a major event in a Temple.Because of this, Regardie was not aware that there were other members of the order with ritualexperience.Actually, the Temple had a number of members with extensive ritual experience, but they hadchosen to isolate themselves from other Temple members during this time. Some of these membershad been taught by Golden Dawn Adepti. Though well in their 70s, they were still actively engagedin Golden Dawn ritual.The New Zealand Temple, Whare Ra, was also a good example of this cumulative type ofteaching. Dr. Felkin, was in charge of ritual training at Whare Ra. Under.his guidance, Whare Ramembers were the best trained, in ritual magic, of all the Golden Dawn Temples, including theHermes, Amoun, and Isis Urania Temples. This assertion is based on the opinions of visitingmembers of those Temples, who came to New Zealand.Dr. Felkin ran ritual training in the New Zealand Order like a military operation. He wentinto extraordinary detail on how and what was happening. Around 1920, a former Golden DawnAdept (from the old Isis Urania Temple) and his wife visited Felkin in New Zealand. Theyexpressed surprise at the ritual ability of some of the early Whare Ra Adepti. The trainingprocedures advocated by Felkin, in their opinion, far outstripped those they had seen in the oldGolden Dawn, as well as those of the American Temples that they had previously visited.In the late 1920s, a Whare Ra Adepti by the name of Hugh (Euan) Campbell, went toEngland to study the Dee manuscripts at the British Library for two years. While there, he becamefriendly with Langford Garstin, Chief of the Alpha et Omega (A.O.) Temple. Campbell's diarynotes make the comment that the rituals in this Temple were 'slip shod' (he attended someNeophyte rituals and a 5 = 6 ritual) and lacked any real determined effort. Though Campbell wasfriendly with Garstin, he found that his Alpha et Omega Temple cousins treated rituals as a 'chorethat was simply tolerated.' Garstin, in fact, tried to persuade the young New Zealander to stay inEngland and join his Temple. Campbell had a high respect for Garstin, and found his ability andknowledge to be the exception rather than the rule in the A.O.Whare Ra' s isolation, in the small country village of Havelock North, had its advantages. Alarge number of this Temple's founding group were extremely clairvoyant. When the Temple wasfounded in 1912, Felkin found himself with a tight-knit group of religious devotees that had muchto offer but no direction to go toward. When they applied themselves to the Golden Dawn rituals,it was done in the manner of religious fervor and fanaticism rarely seen outside the Middle Ages,and I make this comment with the greatest respect.From 1912 until the 1940s, when Whare Ra was at its peak, much of this devotion to ritualproduced some surprising results. For example, some Adepti would clairvoyantly check each other,during the performance of rituals, by viewing the state and color of the participants' auras.My own experience, of this type of checking procedure, came from Jack Taylor. He used tomake me create the Temple Godforms of the 0 = 0 grade in the astral - with all the correct coloring.He would then proceed to check each Â°wand give a comment on whether it was correct or not. Ifnot, I would then have to start again. One day, I decided to test him on this, by creating the form179"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"of a lion in the Invisible Station of Hollis. When he got to this form, he told me, rather dryly, that Ishould try a little further north - like Egypt and leave the rest of the pride behind. I never againtested his abilities. Admittedly abilities like Taylor demonstrated were rare, but the number whopossessed this, in the early days of Whare Ra, was quite abnormally high when compared to otherTemples.I do not wish to give the impression that the greater number of Whare Ra Adepts knew moreabout ritual than their old Golden Dawn counterparts, because they did not. However, a hard coredid exist who excelled in ritual work.Whare Ra members were taught courses in Tarot, Astrology, and Enochian Work, along withthe Z.2 documents, which were optional studies. The first things taught new members, however,were the mechanics of ritual. Some older members considered these to be of singular importance,and taught them to the detriment of the other studies. Students were required to keep their eyes onthe cracks of the concrete to locate exact places to stand and walk during the rituals. This caused agreat deal of pressure on Adepti and a number left the Order because of it. Those who survived,under this type of training, were mostly strict disciplinarians.Before World War II, training by the word of mouth was quite detailed, and it produced anumber of Adepts of high caliber. In the final stage of Whare Ra's existence, however, from 1959,to the Temple's end in the late 1970s, this method of training deteriorated, and the Temple failed toproduce the skilled leadership needed to sustain it. Ritual training was inadequate and lacked thenecessary supplemental support of the Z papers. Adepti had to write their own papers andformulate their own opinions as to what went on. As a result, the last three Chiefs of the Orderwere unable to reach the skill level of previous Chiefs, and the Temple disbanded.It is unfortunate, that in the final days of the Temple, members, with the most ritualunderstanding, failed to rise to any real position of power. Those who were in charge, had littleknowledge to pass on to others - with the possible exceptions being Taylor, Campbell, and one ortwo others. This was aptly illustrated by a humorous anecdote related to us by a couple thatbelonged to the Temple during its final stages.The couple reported that they had been instructed, by a former late Chief, to 'walk like anEgyptian' during rituals. The couple, puzzled by what this meant, asked for further illumination.The Chief, obviously unsure of what it meant herself, ignored their request. When we heard this,were reminded of the pop tune and video, of the same name, by the Bangles. To this day, we cannot hear the tune, nor watch the video, without bursting into laughter.When we first got interested in magic, we studied the Golden Dawn rituals from Regardie'spublished works. When put to the practical test, this information, on rituals, left quite a number ofquestions unanswered. It was not until our period with Taylor, and also other Adepti who helped,that we began to truly understand ritual work, and record this understanding on paper. We began tofeel like Carlos Castaneda felt in the presence of Don Juan (see THE TEACHINGS OF DONJUAN: A YAQUI WAY OF KNOWLEDGE). We knew that the opportunity we had was aonce-in-a- lifetime experience and should not be lost. We found that we virtually had to start againfrom scratch.As we conducted the physical actions of each ceremony, we had to learn the functions on themany different levels of the astral, about which virtually nothing had been written, in the publishedpapers of the Order. This type of teaching was the 'word of mouth' type that had been handeddown, from Hierophant to Hierophant, since the formation of the Order in England.Over the years of our association with Taylor, one thing became obvious - we had much tolearn about ritual work. We were extremely fortunate to come under Taylor's wing. We also wereenriched by our acquaintance with the elite circle of ex-Inner Order, Whare Ra members, whocontinually helped us, and gave us advice over the years.It is unfortunate that some of the published comments about the Stella Matutina are blatantlycontemptuous. Reading these accounts, one would consider that most of the members were abunch of incompetents who were mixing in things they knew little about. Most of this stemmed180"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"from Regardie's comments of his experiences in the Hermes Temple, and the tampering of the ritualdocuments. This however, was not always the case in the New Zealand Temple. While it is truethat their scholarship left a lot to be desired, in some areas of the Order's teaching, they were quiteexceptional at ritual magic.The best I have ever seen was Taylor, and the members of the Order of the Table Round.This was a small Arthurian Order that Felkin brought to New Zealand along with the Golden Dawn.It had a large number of Whare Ra, Inner Order members within it.When we were initiated into this side Order (before we were initiated into the Golden Dawnor the Smaragdum Thalasses as it is called in New Zealand), all those on the dais, and most of thefloor Officers, were Inner Order, Golden Dawn members as well. This was a totally differentexperience from any dry Masonic type Order that we had experienced before. Here, it seemed tous, was ritual magic in its essence. The experiences at the hands of this well-drilled collection ofOfficers, left their mark on us. While we had practiced Golden Dawn rituals before, they werenothing compared to this level. The problem of course, was our own lack of experience and ourinability to recognize the ritualistic signposts.Over the next few years, we found we were swamped with the amount of unpublishedmaterial on these rituals. Taylor, to my mind, was something of a ritualistic genius who coulddissect and instantly point to the problem. One of his favorite anecdotes was a conversation he hadwith Mrs. Felkin back in the 1930s. Jack commented, after a Neophyte practice, that everyone hadmanaged their parts without making a mistake. Mrs. Felkin countered that there might have beenperfection in the rendition, but there had been no power to the ritual. Jack had to agree. It was thistype of mechanical approach to ritual on the mundane level that Taylor abhorred. He tried to makeall those he taught look deeper into themselves.Although learning about ritual magic, from books such as this, leaves a lot to be desired, it isoften the only way to learn the subject, especially when a teacher is not available. This book is atool, and a helpful guide based on the observations of a number of Adepts from the Golden Dawn,the Stella Matutina, and the Smaragdum Thalasses. It has been designed to make you aware ofcertain areas of importance in ritual. But only your own training and practice will make some of thethings described here happen.We have chosen the Neophyte Ceremony, as the first of our books on ritual, because it is theessence of the Z.2 rituals from which all of the Second Order Rituals are based. To understand andperform the Z.2 correctly, one must know the higher functions of the Neophyte Ceremony.Within the Golden Dawn teachings, within the 'word of mouth' category, is the continualreference to magnetic manipulation of the aura. This starts at the Neophyte grade, and continuesthrough the 7 = 4 grade. Some of the 'word of mouth' techniques, taught to us, by Taylor, go backto the old Golden Dawn. However, we have taken the liberty of expanding them somewhat in thisbook. Eliphas Levi says in his TRANSCENDENTAL MAGIC,\"When the magus has attained lucidity, whether through the mediation of apythoness or by its own development, he communicates and directs at will themagnetic vibrations in the whole mass of the Astral Light, the currents of which hedivines by means of the Magic Wand, which is the perfected divining rod. By the aidof these vibrations he influences the nervous system of the persons made subject tohis action, accelerates or suspends the currents of life, soothes or tortures, heals orhurts - in fine, slays or brings to life ...\"This is possibly an over simplification. However, it is a highly accurate statement of theactions of ritual magic and the actions of the Hierophant and his Scepter during a ceremony such asthe Neophyte. Just by studying the magnetic actions alone, one enters a labyrinth world ofmagnetism that has many layers. Some of these, we hope. to discuss in this book.Over twenty years ago, I studied Tantra under the\"late Vivandatta. He made me aware of the181"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"use of the auric energies of the body. He used his own aura to magnetically increase his body'svibrational pitch and thus sensitize it to certain etheric fields. This is where teachers like Taylor,who have the same ability as Vivandatta to control their aura, could teach at their best. They wouldnot only tell you, but would show you. Taylor had the ability to take you out of your own physicalbody and introduce you to the magnetic currents in the ritual, one level at a time. The experiencehas to be undergone to be believed. But in doing this, he demonstrated a power that I have neverperceived in any other magician before. He was truly awesome in this field, something which wentagainst his frail body which was confined to a wheel chair in his twilight years.When doing ritual, there is no substitute for practice. At Whare Ra, whenever possible, ritualpractice was done once a week. Some Temples train just once a month with only the Officersconducting the ceremony attending. We would suggest that once a week be the average, with asmany people as will fit into the Hall. Have those present take notes on their impressions of themovements, errors, and so on. This keeps everyone alert during the proceedings. The mechanicscan be quickly learned this way. Furthermore, it leaves the way free for everyone to concentrate onthe inner mechanisms. It is no good saying, after the ritual, that 'it was really powerful this time.'Rather, everyone must be able to dissect it and say why it was powerful or why was the powerlacking? Ritual training is very hard work, make no mistake about it. People get quickly bored ifthey are half-hearted about it.In this book, there are a number of old concepts, that have never been publicly revealedbefore, and many new ones that we have developed. We hope, that over the years, others willbenefit from our experiences and eventually improve on our meager notes. We are fast approachingan age where instruments, whether electronic, radionic, or a combination of both, will be able tocategorize precisely the various energy levels during different parts of the ritual. The future adeptmay be able to use these, like biofeedback principles, to improve his or her performance. Untilthen, there is still a lot of hard work ahead of us. For those of you, who may wish to study themagnetic theory from the scientific viewpoint of radionics, we would suggest reading Tansley'sbook, RADIONICS INTERFACE WITH THE ETHER FIELDS, especially the chapter on the\"Geometric Etheric Link.\"This book has been divided into two parts. Part one gives the 0 = 0 ritual, which is takenfrom one of Whare Ra's earliest documents. It was written around 1912. When Whare Rawithdrew from the Stella Matutina in 1933, the rituals then simply crossed out the words 'StellaMatutina' and inserted `Smaragdum Thalasses.' This copy belonged to a former Chief of thatTemple, Mason Chambers. He was one of the three Chiefs that Felkin left in charge, when hereturned to England after his initial visit to New Zealand. When compared to previously publishedversions of the ritual, by Regardie, Torrens, and Gilbert, one will find, in some instances, additionalmaterial on the pivots, turns, etc., but also there are some areas lacking. There is an AlternateAdoration, given here, which was left up to the discretion of the Hierophant to use. In addition,more information is provided on the ceremony of the Eucharist, at the end of the ceremony, whichhas not been published before.Overall, it would be a fair comment to say that the Stella Matutina versions, of the NeophyteRituals, are far more descriptive than the early Golden Dawn ones that have been examined. Acomparison with the published versions of both Torrens and Regardie will bear this out. Thereason for this is unclear. It is possible they were re-edited by a group of Adepti, under the MorganRothe (M.R.), the name for the Order between 1900 and 1903. Morgan Rothe is a Germanic namewhich loosely translates, Red Dawn.There are a number of other possibilities for the discrepancies in the versions. Perhaps thepapers were re-edited later by the Stella Matutina, or the Temple copies, from the original mastercopies of Mathers, were condensed to save additional writing.Another version, of the Neophyte Ceremony, written three years after the original breakup ofthe Order in 1900, is published by R.A. Gilbert in his GOLDEN DAWN, TWILIGHT OF THEMAGICIANS. This is, in some respects, closer to, though not identical with, the New Zealand182"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"version published here.Part two gives the explanation, in a step-by-step easy-to- follow format. The whole book isdesigned to show the type of procedure a person encounters when joining a Golden Dawn Temple.On a final note, there are a number of purists who go against any tampering of the GoldenDawn rituals. In the past, some of this tampering has been inferior and deserved criticism. In otherareas, such as the Consecration Rituals of the Elemental Weapons, the changes made by the StellaMatutina, in the Hermes Temple at Bristol, were superior to the original Golden Dawn documents.This is a point that most Golden Dawn aspirants will agree on, though, each case must be presentedon its own merits.Some years ago, I had a discussion with a high-ranking member of the Order who took greatpains to point out the 'absolute correctness .of the Consecration of the Vault Ceremony' after Isuggested a change to it without telling this person what the change was. After some deliberation,this person was rather red-faced when informed that the consecration of Fire and Water was donein the reverse manner to what it should be, a basic error of some importance in a very importantceremony.Perfection in ritual is a goal to strive for, and to do this one must be constantly trying toimprove on the old to make it better, where possible. But change in this area must be made for allthe right reasons, and not for change's sake alone. The Golden Dawn is no exception. Some mayconsider that we have complicated an already complex system. For example, in our own case,when we were first introduced to many of the 'word of mouth' teachings, we had our fair share ofheadaches trying to fathom out the intricacy of Golden Dawn ritual work. On more than oneoccasion, we wondered whether this was all necessary. Taylor put this to us very simply:\"If you do not understand the deeper meaning of ritual, whether it be GoldenDawn or otherwise, then all you are doing is marking time and not growing in thisarea. The human soul and its connection to ritual is more complex that we haveeven dreamed about and if you want to get to the kernel of this then you will have towork long and hard. Even though I am now 87, and have been doing Golden Dawnritual work for nearly 60 years, I still learn more every time I read or study therituals. My own teacher told me years ago to make the complex second nature andthen will you start to understand the deeper meaning of ritual.\"We, in New Zealand, have not tried to set ourselves up as the last word on Golden Dawnritual teachings. But we have tried, in our own way, to present to those Golden Dawn enthusiastsout there, some of the information we have learned. This needed to be done, for Whare Ra lastedthe longest of the Golden Dawn Temples. If we had waited for some elderly members of theHermes-Bristol Temple to break their quarter of a century of silence, and publish a volume such asthis, I feel we should have a long wait.If there are Golden Dawn Temples, like our Thoth-Hermes, that are there by ApostolicSuccession, and have the training and knowledge to pass on information, and are reticent throughtheir Obligation, then I make no apology for this work because they have preferred to keep theinformation for themselves at the expense of others who wish to learn. Personally, I find this typeof attitude intolerable, especially in this day and age. To my mind, this is taking a step back to thedark ages of occultism. This information, which is slowly but surely making its way to the generalpublic, is becoming an almost unstoppable tide. It is quite obvious to many, that this is the way inwhich the Golden Dawn can be brought into the 21st century.183"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"APPLICATION TO JOIN A TEMPLEThe following (taken from an early Golden Dawn document) is an example of a request tojoin a Golden Dawn Temple. All applicants are expected to sign and return the form forconsideration of their eligibility to join the Temple:`Some years since, permission was granted by the Secret Chiefs of the Order to certainFraters learned in the Occult Sciences to direct the Working of the Esoteric Order of the G.D. inthe Outer, with the view of aiding the study of Occultism and the mysteries of Life and Death;further also authorizing them to hold meetings both for the purposes of Study and also for theInitiation and Advancement of any person of either Sex, who should be accepted as a candidate bythe Chiefs and who should be prepared and willing to take an Obligation of the most solemncharacter to maintain Absolute Secrecy regarding all things to the Order; (such Obligation being noworse contrary to either their Civil, Moral, or Religious duties).Belief in Supreme Being, or Beings, is indispensable. In addition, the candidate, if not aChristian, should be at least prepared to take on an interest in Christian Symbolism.The Chiefs of the Order do not care to accept as Candidates any persons accustomed tosubmit[ting] themselves as Mediums to the Experiments of Hypnotism, Mesmerism, or Spiritualism;or who habitually allow themselves to fall into a completely passive condition of will; also theydisapprove of the methods made use of as a rule in such Experiments.This Order is not established for the benefit of those who desire merely a superficialknowledge of Occult Science:Preliminary Pledge to be signed by Intending CandidateI the undersigned do hereby solemnly pledge myself(1)That I am over the age of 21 years.(2)That I join this Order of my own free Will and accord.(3)To keep secret this Order, its Name, its members, and its Proceedings, fromevery person outside its pale; and even from Initiates unless in actual possession ofthe Pass-Word for the time being. I further promise to keep secret any informationrelative to this Order which may become known to me before my admission; and Ialso pledge myself 'to divulge nothing whatsoever to the outside World concerningthis Order in case [of] either my Resignation, Demission or Expulsion therefrom.(4) Undertake to prosecute with zeal the study of Occult Sciences.(5)If accepted as a candidate, I undertake to persevere through the Ceremonyof Admission.(Signature in Full)Dated this day of19I select the following for my Motto:(Latin is preferable)I desire that communications may be addressed to me as under:(Address in Full): 184"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"ACCEPTANCE OF A CANDIDATEThe acceptance of a Candidate for a Golden Dawn, A.O., or Stella Matutina varied to acertain degree. Where ever possible, the candidate was first interviewed by a panel of members.This was followed by an 'Astral Investigation,' which was performed by a clairvoyant member ofthe Temple. Usually, this person was one of the Chiefs, or a person sufficiently high enough in theOrder, and nominated by the Chiefs, to astrally investigate the candidate.During the later years of the Stella Matutina, this practice fell into abeyance. A gooddocumented example of this is shown in 'Sword of Wisdom' where Ithell Colquhoun tried tobecome a member of an A.O. Temple (which I assume was in the early 1930s) under theChieftainship of Mrs. Weir. A few nights after applying to join the Temple, Ms Colquhoununderwent an experience that she termed an 'invasion' where she experienced an impersonal forcecoming into contact with her and which she termed the 'Power of the Y.' After this experience, shewas refused membership to the A.O. Temple.To most people, who understand any type of psychic activity, this is relatively straightforwardenough. Consider the psychic experiments allegedly undertaken by the CIA, where those that werepsychic enough drew maps of secret missile installations in Russia. It would be fair comment to saythat if one has the psychic ability, they can drop in and investigate anybody. The exception to this isa trained Adept who has the ability to recognize and neutralize this force (though we doubt the CIAhas studied this type of research). Ithell Colquhoun also mentioned that this force may have beenthe 'Secret Chiefs' (as opposed to the elderly matrons who took the Office of Chiefs at the time).It has been our experience that not one, but two, types of psychic investigations can takeplace. The first, an investigation by an Order clairvoyant, cannot always be deemed accurate unlessit is done by someone who has a proven ability in that field. The second, is when people, who haveapplied to join the Order, experience the same symptoms quoted by Ms Colquhoun. This must bedone on an entirely involuntary basis. It has been described as a cloud or energy field descendingon one. By involuntary, we mean that it was not done on any conscious level by any TempleOfficer. The latter form of investigation has been noted more than once at Whare Ra, and also by anumber of initiates of our Thoth-Hermes Temple. Whether it is an effect of the 'Secret Chiefs' ornot, we cannot say, but according to what we have seen, this type of investigation generally occursto people who are deemed unqualified to advance far into the Order, and in the view of hindsight,would generally be considered unsuitable as Second Order material.Most people may wonder why, if this type of examination of candidates was available, did theGolden Dawn undergo so much turmoil? The answer is simple enough. This type of investigationcan only be applied to the Outer Order (for reasons mentioned above) where people are not in aposition to dictate terms to the Inner Order. Jack Taylor pointed out to us a number of cases atWhere Ra where some members were perfect Outer Order members and put all their efforts behindthe Order. But once admitted to the Inner Order, things changed to the opposite. We know of oneAmerican Temple Chief, a trained psychologist, who uses her training and her ability to be able toread the horoscopes of prospective members to see if they are suitable before they are admitted.However, going on the track record of this Temple and the turmoil within it, from those who haveleft it, this method is not any more successfully than the astral examinations of the earlier Temples.PREPARATION OF THE CANDIDATEThe preparation of the Candidate differed to a certain extent from Temple to Temple, withinthe Golden Dawn, and later in the Stella Matutina. The following description is an example of whatis undergone in the New Zealand Order.Once it is decided that a Candidate is suitable for initiation by the Chiefs, the Hierophant thenobtains a natal birth chart from the aspirant. From this, an electional chart is made up. The two are185"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"joined together so that a suitable time for the ritual can be worked out.Once this is done, a Temple member, or one of the Temple Officers of the oncomingceremony, instructs the Candidate to:(1)Fast at least four hours before the ritual. This is done to ensure an emptystomach which makes the psychic channels more open and receptive to stimulation.(2)Bathe in herbs of the lilacae family, which relate to Malkuth. These herbspenetrate the aura and leave a residue in it that makes it receptive to the auricmanipulation which is conducted during the ceremony.(3) Meditate on a suitable name for at least twenty minutes before theceremony. Generally this form of meditation uses the Hebrew name of the Order(ChBRH ZRCh BQR AWR - Society of the Shining Light of Dawn), which theCandidate is told to repeat continuously until he is blindfolded by the Sentinel. Thetheory behind this meditation is that constant repetition of the name, by the aspirant,helps break down the astral sheaths between himself and the Order.PREPARATION OF THE HALLThe Temple layout is shown in Figure 1. The first Officer to enter the Hall, before theceremony is the Kerux, whose duties are to set up the Temple furniture. This Officer is followed bythe Stolistes who attends to the placing of the Holy Water, and oversees that all robes and insigniasare ready. (Temples, like Whare Ra, usually supplied the robes, but in smaller Temples, theindividual Officers generally had their own. Regardless, it is still the duty of the Stolistes to checkwith each member to be sure that everything is in order). The Dadouchos is the last of the juniorOfficers to enter the Temple. It is his or her duty to attend to the lamps, censers and candles.With the Temple props in place, the Officers leave and the Hierophant then creates the astralshells of the Godforms. Once he has completed this task (which can take from 30 to 40 minutes toperform correctly) the Dadouchos is then brought back into the Temple, and performs the candlelighting ceremony, watched by the (throned) Hierophant. It is important to remember that a candleis placed in each of the four quarters it represents. The Yellow candle for the East, however, isplaced between the pillars and slightly behind the chair of the Hegeinon.The ceremony of candle lighting is always started at the East, going in a clockwise spiral,until the final candle on the altar is lit. Two main things occur during this exercise. The first is thatthe Hierophant extends his Ruach to the fire of the Dadouchos. The second is that the aura of theDadouchos gives the flame its link which, controlled by the Hierophant, brings the first activeelement into the floor plan, for Fire is the first manifested element.During this ceremony, the Hierophant must have the ability to 'cradle the aura of theDadouchos.' By this I mean he must reach out and control the actions of the Dadouchos on theAstral through a process of auric manipulation. (This is later manipulated by the Hegemon)After this, the rest of the Temple Officers are then admitted. They go to their respectivestations and await the Kerux, the final Officer to enter the Hall, after he has attended to theCandidate.Each Officers now takes their positions, and links their Ruachs with the Nephesch of theGodform created by the 1-llerophant. Again, this is, Godform assumption in a group format. TheDais Officers usually enter with the rest of the Officers, after the candles are lit by the Dadouchos.Once seated on their Thrones, they also link their Ruachs with the Nephesch shells created by theHierophant.186"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"SYMBOLISM OF THE TEMPLEThe Hall of the Neophytes is called \"The Hall of the Dual Manifestation of Truth,\" that is,\"The Hall of the Goddess Thmaah (Maat). Her name has three forms, according to the nature ofher operation. This is based on Chapters from the Egyptian Book of the Dead, modified for GoldenDawn usage.The second set of major symbolism, in the 0 = 0 blueprint, is Kabbalistic and considers anarrangement in the manner of the Sephiroth. The Temple is placed looking towards the YH ofYHVH,in Malkuth of Assiah. That is, as Y and H answer to the Sephiroth of Chokmah and Binahin the Tree of Life (and also to Abba and Aima, through whose knowledge Kether may beobtained). The Sacred Rites of the Temple should gradually lead the Neophyte into the knowledgeof his or her Higher Self. Like the other Sephiroth, Malkuth has also its subsidiary Sephiroth andPaths. Of these Ten Sephiroth, the Temple, as arranged in the Neophyte Grade, includes only thelower Sephiroth in the Tree of Life, viz.: Malkuth, Yesod, Hod, and Netzach, and the Outer side ofParoketh, the Veil. Paroketh forms the East of the Temple. The symbolism of the East is ofprimary importance here.The bases of the two Pillars are respectively placed in Netzach and Hod; the White Pillar is inNetzach; the Black Pillar is in Hod. They represent the Two Pillars of Mercy and Severity. Thebases are cubical, and black, to represent the Earth element in Malkuth. The columns arerespectively black and white to represent the manifestation of the eternal balance of the Scales ofJustice. Upon them should be represented, in counter-changed color, any appropriate Egyptiandesigns, emblematic of the soul.The scarlet tetrahedron capitals represent the Fire of Test and Trial. Between the Pillars isthe porch way of the Region Immeasurable. The twin lights, which burn on their summits, are \"TheDeclarers of the Eternal Truth.\" The bases of the tetrahedral are triangular. The base of the WhitePillar points East, while that of the Black Pillar points West. They thus complete the hexagram ofTiphareth - though separate, as is fitting, in \"The Hall of the Dual Manifestation of Truth.\"The Altar, whose form is that of a double cube, is placed in the eastern part of Malkuth - asfar as the Neophyte is concerned. But to the Adeptus Minor, its blackness will veil on the East,citron, on the South, olive, and on the North, russet, while on the West side, and the base, will beblack, while the summit is a Brilliant Whiteness.The symbols on the Altar represent the Forces and the manifestation of the Divine Light.These are concentrated in the White Triangle of the Three Supernals as the synthesis. Upon thissacred and sublime Symbol, the Obligation of the Neophyte is taken. It calls to witness the Forcesof the Divine Light.The Red Cross of Tiphareth (to which the Grade of 5 = 6 is referred) is placed above theWhite Triangle, not as dominating it, but as bringing it down and manifesting it unto the OuterOrder. It is as though the Crucified One, having raised the symbol of self-sacrifice, had thustouched and brought into action in matter, the Divine Triad of Light.Around the Cross are the symbols of the Four Letters of the Name Jehovah - the Shin ofYeheshuah being only implied and not expressed in the Outer Order. At the East is the MysticalRose, allied by its scent to the element Air. At the South is the Red Lamp, allied by its Flame withthe Element of Fire. At the West is the Cup of Wine, allied by its fluid form to the Element ofWater. At the North are Bread and Salt, allied by their substance to the Element of Earth.The Elements are placed on the Altar according to the Four Winds.\"For Osiris on-Nophiris who is found perfect before the Gods, hath said:`These are Elements of my Body, Perfected through Suffering, Glorified through Trial.For the scent of the Dying Rose is as the repressed sigh of my suffering:"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"And the flame-red Fire as the Energy of Undaunted Will.And the Cup of Wine is pouring out the Blood of my Heart:Sacrificed unto Regeneration, unto the Newer Life:Which I destroy in order that they may be renewed.For I am Osiris Triumphant, even Osiris on-Nophris, the Justified:I am He who is clothed with the Body of Flesh,Yet in whom is the Spirit of the Great Gods:I am the Lord of Life, triumphant over Death.He who partaketh with me shall rise with me:I am manifestor in Matter of Those whose Abode is in the Invisible:I am purified, I stand upon the Universe:I am its reconciler with the Eternal Gods:I am the Perfector of Matter:And without me, the Universe is not.'\"Technically, the Door of the Hall is supposed to be situated behind the seat of the Hiereus inthe West. However, it may be in any part of the Hall, seeing that the walls represent the barrier tothe exterior. But this is not always the case, for the barrier is also called the Portal, and can besituated within the Hall, usually shaped in an oval fashion.The corners of the Hall, which are deemed as exterior to the Portal, and still within theconfines of the Four Children of Horus, is the place where all members of the Temple, who wish toview the ceremony, are located. They may partake in the circumambulation, and partaking of theEucharist, they may sit (the seats are in the northwest and southwest only, no seating is behind theDais). When the Hall is small, then the Portal may exceed to the physical barriers of the walls.\"The Gate of the Declarers of Judgment\" is the name of the Door - its symbolic form is that of astraight and narrow doorway, between the two Mighty Pylons. \"The Watcher against the EvilOnes\" is the name of the Sentinel who guards and his form is the symbolic one of Anubis.The following paper on the Two Pillars is by Wynn Westcott:The PillarsBy Wynn WestcottIn the explanation of the symbols of the Grade ofNeophyte, your attention has been directed to the generalmystical meaning of the Two Pillars that are called in theritual, the \"Pillars of Hermes\" of \"Seth\" and of\"Solomon.\" In the 9th Chapter of the Ritual of the Deadthey are referred to as the Pillars of Shu, the \"Pillars ofthe Gods of the Dawning Light,\" and also as \"the Northand Southern Columns of the Gate of the Hall of Truth.\"In the 125th Chapter, they are represented by the sacredgateway, the door to which the aspirant is brought whenhe has completed the negative confession. The archaicpictures on one Pillar are painted in black upon a whitebackground, and those on the other are white upon ablack background, in order to express the interchangeand reconciliation of opposing forces and the eternal188"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"balance of light and darkness which gave force to visiblenature.The black cubical bases represent darkness and matterwherein the Spirit, the Ruach Elohim, began to formulate theIneffable NAME, that Name before which the ancient Rabbishave said, \"rushes through the universe,\" that Name which theDarkness rolls back at the birth of time. The flaming redtriangular capitals which crown the summit of the Pillarsrepresent the triune manifestation of the Spirit of Life, theThree Mothers of the Sepher Yetzirah, the Three AlchemicalPrinciples of Nature, the Sulfur, the Mercury, and the Salt.Each Pillar is surmounted by its own light-bearer veiledfrom the material world.At the base of both Pillars rise the lotus flowers, symbolsof regeneration and metempsychosis. The archaic illustrationsare taken from the vignettes of the 17th and 125th Chapters ofthe Ritual of the Dead, the Egyptian Book of the \"Per-em-Hru\"or the \"Book of Coming Forth into the Day,\" the oldest book inthe world as yet discovered. The Recession of the Priests ofON is to be found in the walls of the pyramids of the kings ofthe 5th and 6th Dynasties at Sakarah, the recession of the I lthand 12th Dynasties on the sarcophagi of that period, and theThebian recession of the 18th Dynasty and onward is found onthe papyri, both plain and illuminated. No satisfactorytranslation of these books is available, none having been yetattempted by a scholar having the qualifications of a mystic aswell as Egyptologist.The Ritual of the Dead, generally speaking, is a collectionof hymns and prayers in the form of a series of ceremonialrituals to enable a person to unite himself with Osiris theRedeemer. After this union he is no longer called the man, butOsiris, with whom he is now symbolically identified. \"That theyalso may be One of us,\" said the Christ of the New Testament.\"I am Osiris\" said the purified and justified person, his soulluminous and washed from sin in the immortal and untreatedlight, united to Osiris, and thereby justified, and the son of God;purified by suffering, strengthened by opposition, regeneratethrough self-sacrifice. Such is the subject of the great EgyptianRitual.The 17th Chapter of the Thebian recession consists of avery ancient text with several commentaries, also extremely old,and some prayers, none of which come into the scheme of theoriginal text. It has, together with the 12th Chapter, been verycarefully translated for the purpose of this lecture by the V.H.Prater M.W.T., and V.H. Soror S.S.D.D. has made manyvaluable suggestions with regard to the interpretation. The titleand preface of the 17th Chapter reads:189"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Concerning the exaltation of the Glorified Ones, of Coming and Going Forth inthe Divine Domain, of Genies of the Beautiful land of Amentet.

They are destroyed who barred Thy way.The 125th Chapter is concerned with the entry of the Initiate into the Hall of the TwoColumns of Justice, and commences with a most beautiful and symbolic description of Death, as ajourney from the barren wilderness of Earth, to the Glorious land which lies beyond. The literaltranslation of the opening lines is as follows:I have come from afar to look upon thy beauties. My hands salute Thy Name ofJustice. I have come from afar, where the Acacia tree grew not. Where the treethick with leaves is not born. Where there come not beams from herb or grass. Ihave entered the Place of Mystery. I have communed with Set. Sleep came uponme, I was wrapped therein, bowing down before the hidden things. I was usheredinto the House of Osiris. I saw the marvels that were there. The Princes of theGates in their Glory.The illustrations in this section represent the Hall of Truth as seen through the open leaves ofits door. The Hall is presided over by a God who holds his right hand over the cage of a hawk, andhis left hand over the food of eternity. On each side of the God is a cornice crowned by a row ofalternate feathers and Uraei symbolizing justice and fiery power. The door leaf at the end of a stallis called \"Possessor of strength, binding the male and female animals.\"The 42 Judges of the Dead are represented as seated in along row, and each of them has to benamed, and the sin over which he presides has been denied. This chapter describes the introductionof the initiate into the Hall of Truth by ANUBIS, who, having questioned the aspirant receives fromhim an account of his initiation, and is satisfied by his right to enter. He states that he had beentaken into the ante-chamber of the Temple and there stripped and blindfolded, he has to grope forthe entrance of the Hall, and having found it, he was reclothed and anointed in the presence of theinitiated. He is asked for the passwords and demands that his soul (ba) should be weighed in theGreat Balance of the Hall of Truth, whereupon ANUBIS again interrogates him concerning thesymbolism of the door of the Hall, and his answers being found correct, ANUBIS says \"Pass on,thou knowst it.\" Among other things, the initiate states that he has been purified four times, thesame number of times the Neophyte is purified and consecrated in the ceremony of the Neophyte.He then makes the long Negative Confession, stating to each Judge in turn that he is innocent ofthat form of sin over which he judges. Then he invokes the Judges to do him justice, andafterwards describes how he washed in the washing place of the South, and rested in the North, inthe place called \"Son of the Deliverers\" and he becomes the dweller under the Olive Tree of Peace,and how he was given a tail flame of fire and a scepter of cloud which he preserved in the saltingtank in which mummies were swathed. And he found there another Scepter called \"Giver of191"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Breath\" and with that he extinguished the flame and shattered the Scepter of Cloud, and made alake of it. The initiate is then brought under the symbol of the Scales of Balance. He also has toname the Guardian of the Gateway, who prevents his passage, and when all these are propitiated,the plea of the Hall itself cries out against his steps, saying \"Because I am silent, because I ampure,\" and it must know that his aspirations are pure enough and high enough for him to be allowedto tread upon it. he is then allowed to announce to Thoth that he is clean from all evil, and hasovercome the influence of the planets, and THOTH says to him: \"Who is He whose Pylons are ofFlame, whose walls of Living Uraei, and the flames of whose House are streams of Water?\" Andthe initiate replies \"Osiris\" And it is immediately proclaimed: \"Thy meat shall be from the Infinite,and thy drink from the Infinite. Thou art able to go forth to the sepulchral feasts on Earth, for thouhast overcome.\" Thus these two chapters which are represented by their illustrations upon thePillars represent the advance and purification of the soul and its union with Osiris, the Redeemer, inthe Golden Dawn of the Infinite Light, in which the soul is transfigured, knows all, and can do all,for it is made One with the Eternal God.KHABS AM PEKHTKNOX OM PAXLIGHT IN EXTENSION[End of Westcott's lecture. Eds.]The Z.1 document states, \"... upon them (the Pillars) should be represented incounter-changing color ANY appropriate Egyptian designs, emblematic of the Soul.\" The bottomline was that most Temples had their own Egyptian designs on the Pillars. In many ways these weresimilar to the Vaults of various Temples who chose their own version of the color schemes yet stillretained the basic design.There has been a misconception that the Pillar drawings published by Wang in THE SECRETTEMPLE and also in the COMPLETE GOLDEN DAWN SYSTEM OF MAGIC were the ONLYones utilized by the Golden Dawn. The object of the Pillar drawings was to show theprocession of the soul in the afterlife, and yet try and relate them to the journey of the Candidate inthe 0 = 0 ritual. What had never been discussed in print is that only the White Pillar relates to the 0= 0 ritual. The Black Pillar relates to the Inner Order and, as such, only the White Pillar will bediscussed here and the Black Pillar will be elaborated on in a separate volume.The designs shown in Figures 50 through 53 are taken from the two Pillars of the NewZealand Thoth-Hermes Temple which are a little more fuller than other previous designs (includingWhare Ra's which is slightly more expansive than those designs previously published). Figures 50and 51 show 12 panels of the White Pillar, while Figures 52 and 53 show 7 panels of the Black^ Pillar. A number of Golden Dawn students have asked why the original plates of the Papyrus ofAni were not left intact on those designs of the English Temple's Pillars. Both Jack Taylor andIsrael Regardie were of the opinion that when the plates of the designs, from the Egyptian BOOKOF THE DEAD, were matched with the 0 = 0, parts were left out because, in the opinion of thechiefs, they did not fully match the 0 = 0 in pertinent points. Figure 50, for example, is taken froma Thoth-Hermes lecture.Panel 1. This plate shows both men and women as candidates (which are analogous to Ani and hiswife) waiting in the ante-chamber of the Temple, before entering. They are shown playing chess,for this meaning is a subtle hidden one. Chess is a game of strategy and thinking, hence the couplehave carefully thought out the moves of deciding to enter the Order. The hawk and feather seatedoutside the ante-room represents Ament (Amentet) a Goddess of the West, the place of the settingsun and entrance way to the Hall of the Neophytes which is synonymous with the Dwelling Place ofthe Dead. Ament was considered the welcomer of the dead. This whole concept, related back to192"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"the Order, shows the candidate leaving behind the old values. The bread and beer also shows thatnourishment will be provided on the journey of the candidate.Panel 2. The human-headed hawks seated on the roof of the tomb relates to the two Higher Selvesof the Candidates, who take their appropriate place in the Hall of the Neophytes. The figurepraying beside them represents Ani (from this point on we now follow a single individual on thejourney) and shows that the correct rites of initiation are being applied. The two lions, back toback, are Set and Tau who support the horizon and these relate back to the two Pillars of theTemple, the entrance way to the Abode of the Blessed which relates to the Order concept of theUnification of Osiris - our Higher Self.Panel 3. Here we have the body of Ani with Nephthys at the left and Isis at the right hand side ofthe funeral bier, guarded by Anubis. This was called the Abode of the West. It is the point in thecircumambulation where the Hiereus bars the way of the Candidate and informs him of the thin linehe walks between Light and Darkness. On the far right of this plate, Ani (as the Candidate) isbefore Osiris (as the Hierophant) and it is his reception in the East, the first major part of thetransformation, his revelation.Panel 4. In this plate the body of Osiris has been transformed into the Bennu Bird through thepurification process and shows the Candidate's acceptance into the Order through \"Khabs AmPekht, Knox Om Pax - Light in Extension.\" The lotus, libation vase, and offerings on the altar,represent further symbols of the transformation process, as represented in Order symbology, by thecross above the triangle which the Candidate must swear by to fully transform himself. The nextaspect of this plate shows Ani lying on the bier, with the forms of Nephthys and Isis (in hawk form),at each end of him while his Soul hovers above him with two ankhs of power. The two UraeiGoddesses are also present (representing North and South). Thi& refers to the Speech of theHierophant and the placement of the Neophyte between the Pillars, where he is instructed in thesecret signs, etc., and is readied for his final consecration. The soul above him is the Higher Selfadvancing upwards.Panel 5. In this place we have Ani approaching the Water God or the final consecration of theNeophyte. The staff held by the Water God is the symbol of the year which is the Pass-Word of theEquinox. The whole process is a continuation of the soul or Higher Self of the Neophyte which hassoared upwards, passed the watchful Eye of Horus, to its reception in Pools of the Two Truthswhich are held together by Uatch-ura. The right-hand lake is the 'Pool of Natron' while theleft-hand lake is the 'Pool of Salt' (another concept of the two Pillars). This shows the actions ofthe Higher Self in the'ritual, though the Neophyte has not moved from the previous diagram, in thephysical and the actions are all on a Higher Plane. The final drawing on this plate is the Rasta, theSouth Gate of Anrutef, part of Herakleopolis, and Northern Entrance to the Land of the Deadwhich the Neophyte passes through in the circumambulation.Panel 6. The Eye of Ra, as Osiris, over the funerary building shows the effect sunrise broughtabout in the 0 = 0 ritual by the Mystical Circumambulation in the Pathway of Light. Here the sunhas appeared (which is also the soul of the Neophyte) who petitions the Guardian to give it accessand strength because it is of the same substance of the Gods themselves - immortal. The next figureis Thoth, raising the Eye of Osiris, showing that the soul, or Higher Self of the Neophyte, is withoutblemish (this is omitted in the Brodie Innes description of the White Pillars). The inference is thatthe Higher Self of the Neophyte has returned to its proper place, like the story of Thoth whoovertook Set, and restored the Eye to its correct place in the sky - shown as the Sky Goddess,Mehurt, Daughter of Ra and symbolic of ..the Heaven.193"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Panel 7. This shows a funeral chest with the Head of Ra, and holding twin ankhs emerging fromthe pastos. It relates to Osiris, as Ra partaking of himself - death and resurrection, with the fourchildren of Horns standing by. This is the proclamation of the Motto, by which the Neophyte willnot be known among the Order members, which relates to a rebirth.Panel 8. The Four Canopic Gods relate to the four Officers on the Dais (excluding the Hierophant),the Chiefs behind Osiris, who control the 0 = 0 from their thrones. Their actions have beenexplained previously which was never before given to the grades of the 5 = 6 or below,Panel 9. The seven Gods (which are formed from the ones above) relate to the Officers of theTemple floor (excluding the Sentinel).Panel 10. This plate has Two Pillars with two hawk forms between them. The hawk with the SolarDisk is Ra, while the other is Osiris, while the Pillars themselves represent Tet or human sacrifice(from the cult of Tetu). Within the 0 = 0, this is shown when the blood is shown to the Neophyteto remind him of his oath. The next symbol, of a cat severing a snake near an Acacia tree, relates tothe victory of the forces of Osiris over Typhon-Set (the snake) as the last vestiges of impurity havebeen removed. This relates to the reverse circumambulation in the 0 = 0 ritual.Panel 11. This plate shows Orisis-Ani, in adoration before the God Kephera, going by in his SolarBoat. This relates to the Final Adoration, in the Ritual. Kephera is a symbol of the Creator - towhom the Adoration was made.Panel 12. This shows Tem in his boat and the God Rehu in lion form. Though this plate is hard toexplain, at the best of times, the Order considers it the reunification with Osiris and the following ofhis doctrine shown by the Partaking of the Eucharist Ceremony, at the end of the 0 = 0 ritual, wherehis essence is received and united with.The Enochian system, and its association to the 0 = 0 ritual, has been, for many years,something of an enigma since in the drawing of the Temple diagram no such tablets are shown ormentioned. However, within the Inner Order, a number of papers have survived that tie theElemental associations which compose the Enochian pyramid squares to the Godforms that rulethem, and their associations to the Temple Officers with the Cancellarius, Hegemon, Stolistes, andDadouchos being the exceptions. What a number of students do not realize is that while there areno Enochian Tablets indicated in the 0 = 0 ritual, in the permanent Temples, such as Isis-Urania,Bristol-Hermes, Whare-Ra, etc., the four Tablets were left on the Temple walls, covered by acurtain the color of the element that they represented. When the Elemental grade ceremonies were^ done, the curtain of the particular tablet required was drawn back for the duration of the ceremony.The curtains stifled the corporeal energies of the tablets. Their incorporeal form positivelyeffected the ceremony, and it is this etheric energy that the Temple Officers drew upon. WhetherMathers originally intended this to happen is anyone's guess. Most of the early rituals were done indrawing rooms, etc., and more than likely, if he had so intended, the tablets would have beenindicated. However, in the permanent Temples, people like Jack Taylor, who held the Office ofHierophant on and off for over 35 years at Whare Ra, noticed that the curtains barely stopped theetheric energies of the tablets from emanating during the 0 = 0 ceremony. They emanated evenmore so, during the elemental ceremonies, when the incorporeal and corporeal energies had to becorrectly balanced for the ritual to be a success.It is not our intention to involve ourselves deeply with Enochian semantics in the 0 = 0.However, since this book is for both Adept and Neophyte alike, it is impossible to separate onefrom the other. We would ask our readers, who are not familiar with the Golden Dawn's version ofthe Enochian system, to refer to the works of Crowley and Regardie who have covered this subject194"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"more than adequately.

He isplaced in the East because that is where the Sun, ruler of Life, rises. From this position, he governsthe Hall. In the ancient Mysteries, he was the Officer who taught the Rites of Sacrifice andWorship, and he was the Chief Initiating Priest at Eleusis, and the equivalent to the Roman, PontiffsMaximum, or High Priest. The word, Hierophantos, is derived from Hieros, and Phaino whichmeans 'to show forth,' `expound,' or 'teach.' He was the head of the ancient Eleusian cult andchosen for life from the hieratic family of the Eumolpidae. Since he was the Expounder of theMysteries, it was necessary that a man of impressionable voice should be chosen. This was anOffice of great responsibility. It is on record that any ancient Hierophant, who had shown himselfin his ceremonial robes, suffered death as a penalty for his indiscretion.The Hierophant fills the place of a Lord of the Paths of the Portal of the Vault of the Adepts,acting as inductor to the Sacred Mysteries. The Insignia and symbols of the Hierophant are:195"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"(1) The Throne of the East in the Path of Samekh, outside the Veil.(2)The mantle of bright flame scarlet, bearing a white cross on the left breastand the Robe of Scarlet.(3)The lamen suspended from a white Collar.(4)The Scepter of Power.(5)The Banner of the East.(6)The scarlet and white striped nemyss.(1)The position of the Throne on the Path of Samekh is fitting for the Inductor to the Mysteries.It is placed in that balanced and central position of that Path by which alone is safe entrance to themystical knowledge of the Light in Tiphareth. It is placed before Paroketh at the point of itsrending. There it marks the shining forth of the Light through the Veil. The translation of theThree Supernals to the Outer Order is represented by the Red Calvary Cross and the White Triangleupon the Altar. Thus the station of the flierophant's Throne, fittingly represents the rising of theSun of Life and Light upon our Order.(2)The Mantle or cloak, plus the robe of scarlet,represents the flaming energy of the Divine Light,shining forth through infinite worlds. Upon the leftbreast of the cloak, there is a white cross to representthe purification unto the Light. The white cross onthe Mantle is a Calvary Cross which alluded to theFour Rivers as well as suffering to bring aboutÂ redemption. In the Z.1 document, there is someconfusion as to the terms, 'robe' and 'mantle' and tothe color of them. The statement that all members ofthe Dais wore white robes, contradicts earlierstatements that robe colors were varied to the colorof the Office. In the New Zealand Order, the robesare the same color as the mantle for the Officers ofthe Dais. One version of the Z.1, at Whare Ra, thatwas reputedly copied from Wynn Westcott's copy,had the reference to the Officers of the Dais wearingwhite robes crossed out with the note `refer to theabove. S.A.\" 'S.A.' was Westcott's Order motto.Taylor was of the opinion that those on the Daisfunctioned a lot better through total colors ratherthan partial ones.(3) The lamen of the Hierophant, is partially explained inthe Portal Ceremony thus:The Hierophant's Lamen is a synthesis ofTiphareth, to which the Calvary Cross of the sixsquares, forming the cube opened out, is fittinglyreferred. The two colors, red and green, the mostactive and the most passive, whose conjunctionpoints put the most practical application of theknowledge of equilibrium, are symbolic of thereconciliation of the celestial essences of Fire andWater. For the reconciling yellow unites with blue196"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"in green, which is the complementary colour to blue. The small inner circle placedupon the Cross alludes to the Rose that is conjoined therewith in the symbolism ofthe Rose and Cross of our Order.But in addition to this, it represents the blazing light of the Fire of the Sun, bringing into beingthe green vegetation of the otherwise barren Earth. And also, the power of self-sacrifice, requisitein one who would essay to initiate into the sacred Mysteries. The Lunen affirms the qualificationnecessary to him who uses it. Therefore it is suspended from a white collar, to represent the purityof the White Brilliance from Kether. Hence it should always be worn by the Hierophant.(4) The Scepter, represents the Authority and Power ofthe Light. It is the smallest of the Scepters held by thoseOfficers on the Dais, being no more than 20 inches inlength. It represents the forces of the Middle Pillar. It isscarlet, in color, with three gold bands on the shaft. Theserepresent the Sephiroth of Daath, Tiphareth, and Yesod.The gold pommel at the base represents Malkuth. The shaftitself represents the Paths of Gimel, Samekh, and Tau. TheGrip, by which it is wielded, is the Path of Tau (the lowestportion of the shaft), representing the Universe governedby, and attracting the forces, of the Light.The Names of the Sephiroth and Paths are not markedthereon, but the Hierophant Initiate of the Second Ordershould remember the sublimity of the symbolism while hewields it. It'represents touching the Divine Light of Ketherand attracting it through the Middle Path to Malkuth. It iscalled the \"Scepter of Power\" and invests him with thepower of declaring the Temple Open or Closed in anyGrade of the Outer Order. If time is short, then this is doneby saying\" \"By the Power in me vested by this Scepter, Ideclare this Temple duly Opened (or Closed).\" This method of Opening and Closing, by Scepter,should be only used in great emergencies - when time is pressed. It should not be used in aCeremony where Elemental Spirits have been invoked.The use of the Scepter during ritual is not merely a vacant gesture of pointing it at the desiredobject for an effect. The Scepter becomes an extension of the link between the Hierophant and theSecond Order. It represents the power of Osiris, even when he takes the form of Aroueris. Oncehe has assumed the Astral Shell of Osiris, he then invokes this power to act through the Scepter. Itbecomes a living extension and fusion of Osiris. When the Scepter is pointed or directed duringthe 0 = 0, the power is directed through the Sephirah of Malkuth (at the base of the shaft), this thenrises through the shaft, emitting the 12 rays through the Mitre-headed top of 12 points. These are inthe color of the Queen Scale of Briah, which when united, form a White Brilliant Light.In some Temples, this Scepter had a crown of ten points, each representing a Sephirah.However, the rays they emitted were not considered balanced enough, and though powerful, it wasfound by clairvoyant members that they were somewhat erratic. It sometimes took a great deal ofeffort for the Hierophant to control them. By using a 12-pointed Mitre, a definite change was feltand the power of the Scepter was definitely increased to a higher and more directionable level.Brodie limes wrote a letter to Felkin, about the imbalance of the ten-pointed Scepter, in 1990,though no solution was offered. Taylor, and others at Whare Ra, made similar comments. After agreat deal of experimentation, by Thoth-Hermes members, a 12-pointed mitre head was found to beideal.197"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The method, by which the Ilierophant utilizes this force, is through his Tiphareth center. Tobe able to do this correctly, his sphere of sensation (aura) must be united (the joining of the Ruachand Neshamah) before the start of the ritual, through the Scepter (this is used to call the powerdown) from the Second Order. As stated above, it must not be wielded for the invocation ofElemental Spirits. Its main function is to prepare a way through for the Light. Its action is literallybased on a magnetic charge (hence the magnetized rod up through its shaft - like the ElementalWand of the Adepti) to blast a path. Using this, for Elemental invocations, would be disastrous asthe ceremonies form an entirely different function to an Invocation through the Pentagram Ritual.To give an example, the misuse of a Scepter was witnessed during the visit of a Chief fromanother country, in 1983, who performed Regardie's brilliant 'Opening of the Watch TowerCeremony' (which was based on the Consecration of the Vault of the Adepti Ceremony). In thisinstance, we had a First Order Weapon being used through a Second Order Framework ofElemental Invocations, through the Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram - the very thing the originalZ.1 warns against (the correct weapons to use during the Watch Tower Ceremony are theElemental Weapons or the Second Order Wand of the Chief Adepti).The result of this ceremony was that the power of the Scepter did little but inflate or falsifythe Ego, having little or no effect on the actual result. A clairvoyant description of this was to havered rays of energy emitting from the Scepter - directly from the Chiefs own auric charge - and notfrom the Divine Light. This Scepter, through repeated use, would be as disastrous (for the wielder)as playing with an atomic pile without protection - with a direct effect to the health of the wielder.When viewing the correct use of the Scepter, by clairvoyancy, one can see the colored raysform into a white light. Order clairvoyants, such as Jack Taylor, often informed us that the powerof the ceremony can be judged on the effect generated through the use of the Scepter. Whencolors, such as red, occur, it is because the wielders magnetic emanations are not coming throughthe Second Order. (This is not to be confused with the red ray of Tiphareth which is sometimesemitted from this center, but this ray also undergoes a change in color when worked through theScepter.)(5) The Banner of the East, is partly explained in theportal:The field of the Banner of the East isWhite, the color of light and purity. As in theprevious case, the Calvary Cross of six squaresis the number of six of Tiphareth, the yellowCross of Solar Gold, and the cubical stone,bearing in its center the sacred Tau of Life, andhaving bound together upon it the form of theMacrocosmic Hexagram, the red triangle ofFire and the blue triangle of Water - the RuachElohim and the Waters of Creation.In addition to this explanation, it affirms the Mode of Action employed by the Divine Light, inits operation by the Forces of Nature. Upon it is the symbol of the Macrocosm. This is colored toaffirm the action of the Fire of the Spirit, through the Waters of Creation, under the harmony of theGold Cross of the reconciler. Within the center, of the Hexagram, is a Cross in White to representits action as a Tria . The whole is placed on a white field representing the ocean of the Ain SophAur.The Bann is suspended from a gold-colored bar by red cords. The pole and base should bewhite. The base represents the purity of the foundation - the shaft, the Purified Will directed to theHigher. The golden cross-bar is that whereon the manifested Law of Perfection rests; the banner198"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"itself, the perfect Law of the Universe, the red cords and tassels of the Divine self-renunciation,whose trials and sufferings form, as it were, the Ornament of the Completed Work. The wholerepresents the ascent of the initiate, into Perfect Knowledge of the Light. Therefore, in theaddress of the Hiereus, the Neophyte hears, \"Even the Banner of the East sinks in Adoration beforeHim.\" As though that symbol, great and potent though it be, were yet but an inferior presentmentof the Higher, fitted to our comprehension.In simple terms, the Banner of the East helps fuse the link of the Hierophant to the Candidate.It also helps prevent obstruction to this link, by its use as a shield, that is desired to cast out thenegative aspects before it, by absorbing them into it. Since only the perfected work can beabsorbed, the negative influences are left aside. Again, this is not done through the mere action ofholding the Banner in front of one, but is done through the use of the Ruach of the Hierophant whoactivates it (by AHIH) to bring the light through and blind the negative forces. It helps theCandidate go deeper into his or her self and get more benefit out of the ceremony. As a meresymbol, though, it still has quite an effect and helps counterbalance the Banner of the West. (below)(6) The red and white striped nemyss, worn by theHierophant, is colored in a mixture of the DivineFlame through the Divine White Brilliance, both anequal mixture (see below). This covers the head ofthe Hierophant and the Kabbalistic Supernal (thethree Sephiroth of Kether, Chokmah, and Binah) inman the Microcosm. The nemyss becomes theHierophant's link with his Ruach to the Astral Shellof Horus and Aroueris that he had created. Thecovering of the Three Higher Sephiroth of Kether,Chokmah, and Binah, prevents this activated shellfrom taking over totally the personality of theHierophant, during Godform linkage, yet it does sowithout repelling it. Normally, this influx of energywould boost up the etheric centers to the point thatthe Hierophant's own chakras, on his back, would belinked directly to that of the Godform, but the nemyss prevents this. The long tail of the nemyss,which goes to just below the base of the spine, and wide enough to cover the chakra vortex, alsoacts as a type of protection against possession, during the ceremony, and prevents the Kundalinifrom rising up this path.199"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Some Adepti, of both the Golden Dawn and the Stella Matutina, had a fear of possession sostrong that they had talismans sown into the lining of the nemyss, at the base of the tail, to preventthis. Though the Golden Dawn recognized the Western Tradition, its members were still very muchaware of the effect of the chakras. Felkin notes show that this type of teaching was taught as earlyas 1897 to Golden Dawn Adepti.When the Godforms link to the Ifierophant, it is done so at the front of the body, and not theback, through the lamen, which also acts against possession, through the Rose Cross symbols, hascontrol over the Hierophant faculties. At Whare Ra, the Eerophant's lamen was sometimescolored white, instead of green, which, according to Taylor, helped keep the link to the astralGodform pure, and prevented obsession better than green, though still retaining its function, whilemaking the link and the Godform more powerful. The use of white or green, on the lamen,depended entirely on the Hierophant and both were used for many years.The Hierophant and the Current of Osiris The Osirian Current, with the Neophyte Ritual, is represented in the Outer Order by theHierophant. It is essentially a current of death and rebirth. The Osirian influence was one of thefirst major cultures to elevate man to God status. He was the ruler of all eternity. In ancient Egypt,Osiris's main center of worship was in Abydos (Upper Egypt).Osiris was 'Lord of Ahydos' and 'Lord of Tuat.' The latter title referring to that place oflimbo which the dead go before they are judged. The description of this is shown in the BOOK OFTHE DEAD in the 'Coming Forth by Day' chapters. From this, it can be seen that the Current ofOsiris is Initiatory. The various stops and lessons, given by the Hierophant, are the Golden Dawnversion of the 'Coming Forth by Day' chapters.Within the ancient Heliopolitan system, Osiris was placed in a subordinate position to Ra, theSun God. However, in the 0 = 0 ceremony, he is analogous to Ra, in much the same way as Christwas subordinate to his Father in Heaven. The Osirian influence, in the 0 = 0 ceremony, is like the`Book of Pylons' which was considered by Budge as a companion to the 'Coming Forth by Day'chapters of THE BOOK OF THE DEAD.The Osirian Current is used to establish a Portal or mini-universe within the 0 = 0 ceremony.It is used to show the Higher Self, through a virtual mass attack on the psyche, during this ritual.Furthermore, it shows the 'Way' or correct Path which should be taken. The Osirian Current alsoshows the reverence of magical secrets. (See Papyrus of Chester Beatty No. S - British Library.)The Solar influence of Osiris is one which is imitated in the circumambulation of theCandidate around the Altar. Here, it acts out the passage of the sun as seen from the Earth. TheHigher Self of the Candidate unconsciously identifies with this and it solidifies the Kavanah(intention) of the Candidate. The Divine Light, of this circumambulation, focus's the Candidate'senergy of the Higher Self, in the macrocosmic sense, of the Solar System, The Higher Self thenactivates a similar current within the body of the Candidate. This phase of the Osirian Current is aform of realization of this current's existence within the Self which then tries to imitate it. Also, theOsirian influence allows the Candidate to 'wash himself clean' which, in Golden Dawn terms,relates to the consecration of the Candidate.According to tradition, the body of Osiris was cut into 16 pieces. Each of his 16 parts relatesto the Golden Dawn system of the 16 elemental sub-divisions. These become parts of the body ofthe Candidate which are later purified in the four elemental rituals (after the 0 = 0).Within the Neophyte Ceremony, we are given a glimpse of what will happen in the `Partakingof the Eucharist' when the four implements on the altar (rose, light, wine, bread, and salt) are feltthrough the physical senses, of the Candidate, to give him or her a sense of unity.The Osirian Current effects the Ruach of the Candidate during the 0 = 0. Though it does not,at this point, precipitate the linking with the Nephesch, it does bring about an awakening throughone's individual unconscious desire - the impetus for linking with the Ruach that is brought about in200"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"the 5 = 6 ritual. The stimulation of the Osirian Current effects the Candidate through the facultiesof the Ruach: memory, will, imagination, desire, and reason. All of these parts of the self arestimulated equally. This is the 'balancing process of the 0 = 0,' so often described by Golden DawnAdepti.Praemonstrator:The Praemonstrator is the most senior Officer on the Dais and represents Chesed and theGrade of 7 = 4. The actual word Praemonstrator is from the Latin, Praemonstratrare, 'to showforth.' This Chief teaches the members of the Outer Order, either personally or through appointedSenior members. The Office of the Praemonstrator may be identified by the following:(1)Throne(2)Mantle(3)Lamen(4)Scepter(5) Nemyss(1)The Blue throne of the Praemonstrator is situated on the Path of Kaph. This Path passesthrough the Veil on the side of the Pillar of Mercy, and as such, relates to the title of 'Intelligence ofConciliation.' It is here that the passive energies must be balanced by the Praemonstrator,otherwise the receptivity would absorb too much of this type of energy. The Power of Chesedmust be formulated and directed by the Praemonstrator, who represents its influence below theVeil. The exaltation of consciousness, that this energy represents, is here given form. The Throneis said to both absorb and conciliate into a governable mass orform.(2)The proper mantle of Office of the Praemonstrator is theBright Blue Robe of Water, representing the reflection ofWisdom and Knowledge of Chesed. The White Cross andtriangle represent the purification of the Outer Order by Water.The Cross, on the Mantle of the Praemonstrator, is actually aPyramidal Cross which is the cross of the elements representingthe descent of the Divine and Angelic Forces into the Pyramidsymbol (this sits above the Triangle - representing the symbol ofthe Golden Dawn). This action relates to the Higher Forcesworking through an Elemental Symbolism. Beneath this cloth,the Praemonstrator wears a bluerobe. The robe is shown at right(3)The Praemonstrator may weara Lamen like that of the Hierophant,but it is blue upon an orange field and it hangs from a blue collar. Thelink the Praemonstrator forms to the Godform, Isis, is done through hisTiphareth center. The Rose Cross symbol tapers the power so that thelink is formed through certain conditions. Its color attracts Isis, and thecomplimentary orange creates the flashing effect that will make the linkon two distinct levels.(4)The Scepter of the Praemonstrator has a blue shaft, with a singlegold band one quarter of the way up the shaft, and one at its base (seeleft). Upon this is mounted a Maltese Cross, in the colors of the201"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"-Elemental Tablets, from North going clockwise: Yellow, Blue, Black, and Red. The first yellowband, on the base of the Scepter, represents Malkuth. The next, Netzach, and the shaft aboveNetzach, is Kaph. The rest of the shaft represents Qoph. The grip is on the Path of Kaph whichshows the influence above the Veil, and represents the power of the 'Wheel' and the cyclic natureof its existence. Since the power of this Office is above Malkuth, the lower grip is never used lest itinterfere with the actions of the Hierophant. The Pyramidal Cross, mounted on top of the Scepter,shows the elements consolidating the Water influence (with Earth, the densest element touching theshaft) so that it can be controlled and directed.Since the Hierophant's Scepter works through Malkuth, the Praemonstrator's works throughNetzach (from Kaph). The Scepter's use is mainly for receiving power from the Veil, and toactivate the Praemonstrator's Sphere of Chesed on the Dais. It also activates that of Netzach,-which is the Pillar of Mercy on the Temple Floor, and keep the power flowing through so that theTemple is properly balanced.-(5) The Nemyss of the Praemonstrator is Blue with complementary orange stripes. The functionof this is the same as the Hierophant's nemyss, save that the colors represent the blue of waterbalanced with its flashing color from the astral plane.The Praemonstrator and the Current of IsisThe Current of Isis is, activated by the Praemonstrator. On the floor of the Temple, herinfluence is in the shape of the Pillar of Mercy, in the station of Netzach. Isis was the epitome ofmotherhood to the ancient Egyptians. She was the sister/wife of Osiris. She used her magicalformula to give life to her dead husband. Her function was to prepare the way for her deceasedhusband through prayer. Apart from her general functions, Isis's specialty was vibration. It wasshe who said the words to rescue Osiris, and bring him back to life. Isis represents Wisdom andKnowledge which are given out in the speeches of the Temple Officers during the 0 = 0 ceremony.Within the Neophyte ceremony, the energies of Isis are Jupitarian by nature. She instills inthe Candidate the cause of his own ignorance of the Sacred Mysteries. In this, she gives himdirection and motivation. This relates directly to Soul growth, and provides the attunement to theCandidate's Ruach to blend in with the other energies directed down during the ceremony. Herfunction is to bind together, with the Candidate, the energy of the group Soul of the Order. Shedoes this, by linking the Ruach of the Candidate within the Ruach of the ritual, so that themacrocosmic plan gradually starts to be revealed to him.The particular faculty she works through, in the Candidate, is memory - the most bindingfactor associated to the Ruach. She imprints on the unconscious mind of the Candidate the keypoints of the ceremony that will prepare him for the next level. The Isis Current allows theCandidate's Ruach to have access to the occult symbology of the Universal Unconscious, for Isismakes the Candidate 'feel' part of the Order. It is her duty to link together all of the basic 0 = 0ceremonies into a cohesive labyrinth that adds to the foundation of the basic Order itself.The Isis Current acts to make the individual lose the quality of the 'I' for the 'we' toparticipate in the overall plan. She is also the instigator to unleash the Candidate's 'creativeabilities' within the Order framework.The Egyptian BOOK OF THE DEAD says of Isis: \"0 Isis, Thou Goddess, Thou gloriousone, who hast knowledge how to use Thy mouth.\" This specifically relates to the intent andaspirations of the invocation. She must supply each of the Officers on the Temple floor withenough of this type of energy so that they reach deep within themselves so that they can give truestatements, i.e., statements which are both meant and felt, and not merely read as empty words. Inother terms, she helps the Officers achieve the correct vibrational pitch so that all mayact in unison, and with fervor when spealdng during the ceremony. When word fumbles occur,during speeches in this ritual, then the Isis Current is not manifesting correctly.202"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The Isis energy also assists with the consecration of both the Temple and the Candidate. Shere-enforces the Current of Osiris in that function. Also, it is she who instills the solemnity of theoccasion when the Candidate is stopped and questioned during the ritual. It is also through herefforts that the Candidate is allowed to pass on to the next point.Within the Golden Dawn, Stella Matutina, and Smaragdum Thalasses, the words 'dead air'are used to refer to a ritual when nothing seemed to happen. This relates directly back to the dutiesof the Praemonstrator whose function is to activate and outwardly direct the Current of Isis duringritual. When this Officer is not performing his function correctly, 'dead air' creeps into the ritual.To direct and use the Isis Current requires a great deal of work from the Praemonstrator, for he orshe must reinforce the Hierophant at all times (through the Ruach).Imperator:The Imperator is the Chief who holds the IMPERIUM, the rule, command, or charge over theOuter Order. It is he who is in charge of the Temple. He conducts the ceremonies and isresponsible for the general discipline of the Order.The Imperator relates to the Sephirah of Geburah, the Godform of Horus, and the rank of 6 =5 within the Order. This Officer may be identified by the following:(1)Throne(2)Mantle, robe(3)Lamen(4)Sword(5) Nemyss(1)The red Throne of the Imperator sits on the Path of Mem, has the title of 'StableIntelligence,' and relates to growth through a given framework. His or her position is at the far leftof the Temple. As such, it represents the Pillar of Severity which directly relates to the martialqualities of masculine force. It is here that one comes through the suffering of SpiritualInitiation - the first step on the path to illumination. This path is the opposite of Kaph, as here oneis virtually on trial - while in Kaph one transcended this state. The Imperator's Throne is the placewhere one's competence is tested.(2)The mantle of the Imperator is a flame scarletrobe - the cloak of Fire and Severity. The energy andstability of the Temple depend on the Imperator .The cloak and robe are the symbols of unflinchingAuthority, compelling the obedience of the Temple toall commands issued by the Second Order. Upon theleft breast, of the robe, is the Maltese Cross above atriangle. The Maltese Cross, of four arrowheads,represents the keen and swift impact of the Light,coming from behind the Veil.(3) The Lamen of the Imperator is similar to that ofthe Hierophant (and performs the same functions)save it is hung from a green collar. This shows thathe takes a commanding, but passive, role comparedto that of the Hierophant.203"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"(4)The Sword of the Imperator has a red grip with a goldguard. The grip represents the Path of Shin, while the Gold isTiphareth, and the blade is Mem with Geburah as the tip.Wielding from the power of Shin shows the power of 'PerpetualIntelligence' for this is a weapon used blade-on, only. TheImperator sits with the Sword partly turned so the edge of theblade faces towards the Temple. It acts as a warning to anyelemental, or higher force, that this is the Sword of Judgment thatwill inflict retribution on anything that interferes with theceremony.(5)The nemyss is red, with green stripes, and has the similarfunction to that of the Hierophant.The Imperator and the Current of NephthysOn the Dais, the Goddess Nephthys is represented by theImperator, and on the Temple floor, by the Black Pillar in the Station of Hod. In Egyptianmythology, Nephthys was the sister to both Isis and Osiris, and was considered by many as theshadow of Isis, always in the background - ready to be counted on if needed. It was Nephthys whohelped Isis reconstruct the body of Osiris. It was she who was instrumental in helping Horns, afterhe was stung by the scorpion. Her main centers of worship were at Senu, Hebet, Per-mert, andRe-nefert. Her functions are described in the BOOK OF THE DEAD where she says, \"I go roundbehind Osiris. I have come that I may protect Thee, and my strength which protecteth shall bebehind Thee forever.\" Nephthys was considered the extremity of things - which referred namely toboundaries. She was also associated with death and rebirth.The function of Nephthys, in the 0 = 0 ceremony, is to stabilize the currents from North toSouth, and East to West. As such, it has an influence on the Altar, the point where all these meet.She also has control of the Canopic Gods (or Four Children of Horns as they are sometimes called)situated at each corner of the Temple. With the Imperator as the tool, Nephthys' s current is one ofpower, in working at the Altar, in which she assists the Osirian Current. While initiating a currentin the Temple is one thing, maintaining it is yet another, To balance these currents, in an even flow,is the responsibility of the Imperator and the Current of Nephthys.During the 0 = 0 ceremony, when the Higher Self of the Neophyte is placed between thePillars, it is the function of the Nephthys Current to hold it, or bind it to this position, so that it doesnot wander off during the ritual. If Nephthys were to relax her vigilance, Typhon would then try toseize the Ruach of the Neophyte. Every position, of every Godform, owes its stability to theCurrent of Nephthys. If she were not present, the Portal, or boundary of the ritual, would beopened. One of the major functions of Nephthys is to contain the limits of the Portal during theceremony. She accomplishes this through the Imperator. She binds the Godfonns so they remainin their correct stations, through the power emanating from the Altar and the Osirian Current.When the Godforms move around the Temple floor, Nephthys has to maintain the correctbalance of energy which she works through the Pillars. It is Nephthys who holds and conceals theRuach of the Neophyte from Typhon in the place of Harpocrates. When Typhon tries to move out,Nephthys assists Horus/Aroueris to keep him at bay. When the Neophyte enters the Temple, it isNephthys who keeps him from straying from the allotted path during the ritual. In the final part ofthe ceremony, when members partake in the Eucharist, to help ground the varying energies intotheir auras, the Nephthys Current is responsible for seeing that no negative energies are taken inwith the good.It is the duty of the Nephthys Current to prevent any negative influence on the ability of theIrnperator to create and assume a Godform. If this is not done properly, the Portal remains weak204"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"and can be penetrated. At the conclusion of the ceremony it is she who must dissolve the Portaland any forms in it and ensure that no trace of residue remains.Cancellarius:The Cancellarius is the Officer who represents the Sphere of Tiphareth. The actualetymology of the word, Cancellarius, is derived from the (late) Latin word meaning, 'porter,'`doorkeeper,' or 'secretary.' It is the origin of the English word, Chancellor, originally an usher ina law court, then a keeper of the records, a secretary (in which sense it is used in Shakespeare). Inlater years, this word referred specifically to the King's secretary, the Officer to whom petitions forthe mitigation of the rigor of the Common Law were referred. He became the 'Keeper of theKing's Conscience,' and acquired judicial functions which developed into the Court of Chancery.Until about the end of the 16th century, he was ecclesiastic, afterwards a lawyer.The generally accepted derivation of his name is from the position of his seat near the Cancellior lattice-work partition surrounding the Judgment Seat. Others have suggested that it is derived(like the word, cancel) from crossing our words with a lattice-like line. The Roman numeral, X, for`ten', originated in the practice of crossing every tenth stroke, the upper half of the X being takento represent half of this, the Roman, V, which stands for 'five.'In the Order, the Cancellarius is the Secretary of the Temple, who keeps the Roll ofMembership, who is in charge of, and issues, the manuscripts, and keeps a record of the progress ofevery member. In the event of resignation or expulsion of a member, cancels his name in theofficial records of the Temple. He is more immediately, than either of the proceeding Chiefs, theRepresentative of the executive authority of the Second Order over the Outer. The Cancellarius isidentified by the following:(1)Throne(2)Mantle and Robe(3)Lauren(4)Scepter(5) Nemyss(1) The Yellow-Gold Throne of the Cancellarius represents the Sephirah of Tiphareth, and sits onthe Path of Samekh, through Hod, and the Path of Resh, which leads to Yesod, the Sephiroth ofAir.(2)The mantle and robe of the Cancellarius are colored inthe yellow gold of Air and the Sephirah of Tiphareth. TheWhite Cross (situated above the triangle) on the mantle isan Equilateral - one which represents the Cross of theElements, symbolizing their purification through the Lightof the four-lettered name, YHVH, in Tiphareth. The Cross,above the Triangle, relates to the purification of the OuterOrder by Air.(3)The Cancellarius wears a lamen like that of theHierophant, but of yellow on a purple field, and hangingfrom a purple collar. The function of this is exactly thesame a$ the lamen of the other Officers on the Dais.205"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"(4)The Scepter of the Cancellarius is surmounted by ahexagram of amber and gold. The hexagram relates toTiphareth, the main shaft of the Scepter to Samekh, whilethe white ring, above the grip, relates to Yesod, and thegrip to Resh, with the pommel as Malkuth. By workingthrough the path of Resh, through Yesod, the Cancellariusis able to use the Solar energy, by bringing through theDivine Light of Thoth, the Enterer, without whom, noconnection to the Second Order can be made.(5)The nemyss is gold, with mauve or purple stripes,-and has the same function as that of other nemysses.The Cancellarius and the Current of ThothThe Godform of Thoth is represented by theCancellarius on the Dais. Thoth was always considered-the Scribe of the Gods. It was on his records that the fateof the deceased depended. Thoth was self-created. Hetaught the sciences and gave the world divine speech. It issaid that his name was derived from the word 'weight.' In ancient Egypt, the main form of worshipwas in Khemennu.Within the 0 = 0 ritual, Thoth holds a very unique position for he is the personalrepresentative of the Second Order. It is he that makes sure that the Current of Thoth (from theSecond Order) is given to the right person. Also, it is he who makes judgment if this current is tobe instilled in the Candidate. All the invocations in the world will not work unless the Godform ofThoth is formulated correctly by the Cancellarius so that the powers may find the correct restingplace. It is he who must judge the past performance of the Candidate before admittance to theOrder.If the Candidate is considered unsuitable, by this Godform, then the energy impregnated intohis aura is merely nothing but residue of the ritual's other currents. If the individual, going through-the 0 = 0, is found unsuitable, by Thoth, then any future gestures, will only produce somepsychological effect (this includes Inner Order positions as well). Thoth is representative of theInner Order while the Hierophant merely acts on their behalf. Thoth must be correctly formulated,-and his energies directed at the Candidate, by the actions of the Ruach of the Cancellarius, forwithout this the ritual cannot function.Past Hierophant:The duties of the Past Hierophant, or Previous Hierophant, in the 0 = 0 ceremony, is mainlyone of a support role. He wears the same costume as the Hierophant (in some Temples the PastHierophant wears a pure scarlet nemyss - to distinguish his Office from that of the Hierophant). Heusually carries the Hierophant's Scepter while the new Hierophant is 'learning the ropes.' He isthere to support and train the new Hierophant and, if the former makes an error in judgment, the-Past Hierophant is ready to step in and help. He may, from time to time, give some advice to theHierophant during the ritual as well. When the Hierophant leaves the Dais, to work on the Templefloor, the Past Hierophant then assumes the vacant slot and takes over during the Hierophant'sabsence.206"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The Past Hierophant and the Current of ArouerisThe Godform of Aroueris, in its Golden Dawn context, represents Horus the Elder. He wasanalogous to the 'Light of the Day,' the one who fought Set (as Night). His seat of power, inancient Egypt, was at Makenut and Sakhemat. In the 0 = 0 ritual, he is represented by the stationof the Past Hierophant, whose function is to activate this Godform on the Dais when theHierophant is on the Temple floor.His or her actual duty, on the Temple floor, is to protect the Higher Self of the Candidatefrom being taken over at critical points of the ceremony. He faces his old adversary Typhon, whenhe tries to leave his station of the Evil One to do damage and cause havoc in the ritual. This type ofprotective duty, that Aroueris performs, is also shared slightly with the Godform of Harpocrateswhose Invisible Station prevents the Evil One from taking the power of the Circumambulation.Aroueris is very much the guardian on the floor, and protects not only the Candidate but theOfficers as well.While he functions on the Temple floor, Aroueris has the duty to control the power or currentwhich the Hierophant has initiated in the East as well. He does not actually create this current, butguards it to make sure that it functions correctly. In modern terms, his duty, on the Dais, is likethat of a maintenance man; while on the floor, he is a type of shock trooper. While the Current ofAroueris comes from the Illerophant's Throne, Aroueris' astral form gives it an additional boostboth in strength and direction. The Past Hierophant must control the power from his own station(beside the Hierophant) through his Rtrach which is linked to the Ruach of the ceremony itselfWhen the Hierophant uses the power, on the Temple floor, it is through the form of Aroueris on theDais, and the astral form of Aroueris then envelopes him.Because of Aroueris' martial like position, on the Temple floor, his position of power in the 0= 0 is one of extremes. From one viewpoint, he upholds the power of the Hierophant, and in otherareas, he treads on Typhon, thus containing him. He is vary much the warring priest combination.The Current of Aroueris is one of sudden transformations and changes. It is one that takes thesubtle centers of the Candidate to the limit of his or her abilities (within the 0 = 0 terms ofreference) and it also speeds up the vibration of the Candidate so that he can assimilate the data,that is received more rapidly, in a complete upheaval by a revolutionary attitude. The Candidatethen becomes the focal point for Universal Consciousness of the Order to flow into. If this touch,by Aroueris, is not reciprocated by the Candidate he will simply withdraw it. It is then that heimplants a radical sense of change in the Candidate, through the Ruach.Hiereus:The Station of the Hiereus is at the extreme West of the Temple, and the lowest point ofMalkuth, where he is enthroned in its darkest part, in the quarter represented black in the figure ofthe Minutum Mundum. Representing a terrible and avenging God at the confines of matter, at theborders of the Qlippoth, he is enthroned upon matter and robed in Darkness, and about his feet arethunder and lightning - the impact of the Paths of Shin and Qoph - Fire and Water, terminatingrespectively in the russet and olive quarters of Malkuth. There, therefore, is he placed as a mightyand avenging guardian to the Sacred Mysteries. The symbols and insignia of Hiereus are:(1)The Throne of the. West in the Black of Malkuth, where it borders on the Kingdom ofShells.(2)The Black Robe of Darkness, bearing a White Cross on the left breast.(3)The Sword of Strength and Severity.(4)The Lamen suspended from a scarlet collar.(5) The Banner of the West.Note: The nemysses, of the Officers on the floor, are black with white stripes, the exception207"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"being the Hegemon whose nemyss is pure white. These perform the same functions as thenemysses of the Officers on the Dais.(1) The position of the Throne of the West, at the Limits of Mallcuth, is fitting for the Avenger ofthe Gods, for he is placed there in eternal affirmation against the Evil One - \"Hitherto shall yeacome and no further.\" The Throne is also placed there as a seat of witness and of punishmentdecreed against Evil. Basically, the Throne has two functions: to prevent the Qlippoth from-entering, and to prevent anyone lingering outside this area from entering through curiosity.The position of the Throne is the easiest access for any negative traits - for this is the areawhere the Sun, or Light of Day, sinks into oblivion. The Throne of the Hiereus contains this by-keeping the forces of Light (directly from the Hierophant) focused on the locked gateway of theWest.-(2) The robe and mantle of the Hiereus symbolizesDarkness, threatening and terrible to the Outer, as concealingan avenging force ever ready to break forth against the Evil-Ones. On the left breast is a White Cross to represent thePurification of Matter unto the Light: Taylor always taughtthat though the robe and mantle were the same color theyworked on different principles. The mantle or cloak was theactive part of the Hiereus while the robe, like all thoseOfficers on the Temple floor, (save Hegemon) was blackbecause of its absorption principle. The black restricts thegrowth of negativity which bogs it down by condensing it.Before any negativity can work on the Temple Officers, itmust try to take over the Godform the Officer represents,and the black robe prevents this by absorbing all its energyand restricting it - which is usually held in check by theGodform above it. Though not an Earth Grade, the robes ofthe Temple Officers draw from the densest part of Malkuth-for their strength. Taylor likened the principle to beingcaught in a bog with no escape to any negative force thatdid not manage to penetrate the Portal of the Temple.-There are of course checks and counter checks with theinfluence of other energies, so that there are overlap safetyfactors should one or more forces fail to uphold theirfunction of protection during the ritual.(3) The Sword represents the forces of the Pillar ofSeverity as a whole. The Guard represents Hod and isusually made of Brass; the grip is the Path of Shin whichrepresents the Universe governed by the flaming forces ofSeverity, and represents Hiereus as wielding the forces ofDivine Severity. 'The Sword of Vengeance is its Name.'The blade shows this concept from Hod to Binah,encompassing Geburah through the paths of Mem andCheth.208"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"(4)The Lamen is particularly explained in thePortal Ceremony:The Outer Circle includes the fourSephiroth, Tiphareth, Netzach, Hod, andYesod, of which the first three marks theangles of the triangle inscribed within, whilethe connecting Paths Nun, Ayin, and Pehform its sides. In the extreme center is thePath of Samekh through which is thepassage for the Rendering of the Veil. It istherefore a fitting Lamen for the Hiereus asrepresenting the connecting link betweenthe First and Second Orders, while theWhite Triangle established in thesurrounding Darkness is circumscribed in itsturn by the circle of Light.In addition to this explanation, the Lamen represents \"The Light that shineth in Darknessthough the darkness comprehendeth it not.\" It affirms the possible Redemption from Evil and eventhat of Evil itself, through self sacrifices. It is suspended from a scarlet collar, as representing itsdependence on the Forces of Divine Severity, over-awing the evil. It is a symbolof tremendous Strength and Fortitude, and it is a synthesis of the Office of the Hiereus, as regardsthe Temple, as opposed to his Office as regards the Outer World. For these reasons it shouldalways be :worn by the Hiereus.(5)The Banner of the West completes the symbols of Hiereus. It is thus explained in the ZelatorGrade:The White Triangle refers to the three Paths connecting Malkuth with the otherSephiroth; while the red cross is the Hidden Knowledge of the Divine Name which isto be obtained through their aid. The Cross and Triangle together represent life andLight.In addition to this explanation, from the Zelator Grade, it represents eternally the possibilityof Rescuing the Evil; but in it, the Tiphareth cross is placed within the White Triangle of theSupernals, as thereby representing the Sacrifice as made only unto the Higher. The red Cross maybe boarded with gold, in this instance, to represent the Perfect metal obtained in and through theDarkness of Putrefaction. Black is its field which thus represents the Darkness and Ignorance ofthe Outer, while the White Triangle is again the Light which shineth in the Darkness but which isnot understood. Therefore is the Banner of the West the symbol of Twilight - as it were theequation of Light and Darkness. The pole and base are black, to represent that even in the depthsof Evil can that symbol stand. The cord is- black, but the transverse bar and lance-point may begolden or brass, and the tassels scarlet as in the case of the Banner of the East and for the samereasons.The Banner of the West, when it changes its position in the Temple, represents that whichbars and threatens and demands (a symbolic) fresh sacrifice so that the path leading to the Highercan be attained. \"Avenger of the Gods\" is the name of Hiereus, and he is \"Horns in the Abode ofBlindness unto, and ignorance of, the Higher.\" Hoor is his name."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Hegemon:The Hegemon is one of the three Chief Officers of the Temple. He comes without the Portaland instructs the Candidate to hold himself in readiness for the Ceremony of Admission - and alsosuperintends his preparation for this by the Sentinel. The name of this Officer is simply a translationfrom the Greek which means `a leader' or `guide' - 'one who has authority over others,' and `onewho shows the way', `a person who does something first' - 'a Commander.' It is also found withfeminine adjectives from very early times. If we take the verb Ago from the root AG it means, `tocarry,' `to convey' and `to bring' (mostly with living creatures and objects), `to take with one,' `tolead.' Also this word relates to `train' or `educate' and to `weigh in a balance.' In its adjectivalform, Ho Hegemononios has a meaning of guiding and was an epithet of Hermes as the Guide ofthe Departed Souls (in which capacity this God was known as Pompaios or Pychopompos). As one-can see, its etymological base is highly complex - the guiding of living creatures towards a desiredobject, at the same time training and weighing it in the balance.The Station of the Hegemon is between the two Pillars whose bases are in Netzach and Hod,at the intersection of the Paths of Peh, and Samekh, in the symbolic gateway of Occult Sciences - asit were, at the Base of Balance, at the Equilibrium of the Scales of Justice; at the point ofintersection of the lowest reciprocal Path with that of Samekh, which forms part of the Middle-Pillar.This is one position that the feminine passive energies usually were handled better by awoman than a man. At Whare Ra, this position was usually taken by a woman and I believe it was-the same in the Golden Dawn. He is placed there as the Guardian of the Threshold of Entrance andthe Preparer of the Way of the Enterer - therefore the reconciler between the Light and Darkness,and the mediator between the Stations of the Hierophant and the Hiereus.The Hegemon has in fact three Coptic forms: 1. Thma-As-St (This as regards the Middle Pillarand the influence from Kether) 2. Thma-aesh (This is her more Fiery influence and relates to thePillar of Severity) 3. Thmaa-ett (This isâ¢more Fluidic with regard to her influence with respect tothe Pillar of Mercy).The symbols and insignia of the Hegemon are:(1)The Robe, Nemyss and Mantle of Pure Whiteness, bearing on the left breast a RedCross.(2)The Miter-Headed Scepter.(3) The Lamen suspended from a black collar.(1) The robe, nemyss, and mantle represent thecolour of spiritual purity which is required in theaspirant to the Mysteries and without whichqualification none can pass between the Eternal Pillars.It represents the Divine Light, which is attractedthereby, and brought to the aid of the Candidate. Itsymbolizes the self-sacrifice that is offered foranother - to aid him in the attainment of the Light. Italso signifies the atonement of error, the Preparer ofthe Pathway unto the Divine. Upon the left breast is aCross, usually the Calvary Cross, of red to represent-the energy of the lower Will, purified and subjected tothat which is Higher - and thus is the Office ofHegemon especially that of the Reconciler.(2) The Miter-Headed Scepter is the distinctiveensign of the Office of Hegemon. On the Tree of Life210"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"it represents the forces of the Pillar of Mercy. It should be of scarlet with gold bands and apommel. The two bands represent Chesed and Netzach - the shaft being formed by the Paths ofVau, Kaph, and Qoph, as the grip with the pommel in Malkuth. The Miter is gold with redmountings and each point terminates in a ball. The Miter is charged with a red Calvary Cross of sixsquares. This Miter represents the wisdom of Chokmah as a duplicated aspect of Kether, attractedby the symbol of self-sacrifice. The Scepter is wielded by the forces of Flux and Reflux, shown bythe grip being referred to the Path of Qoph, and it represents the attraction into the Universe of theForces of Divine Mercy. The Sephiroth and Paths are marked only as bands, and owing to itsmeaning, should be carried by Hegemon in all conducting of the Candidate, as representing to thelatter the attraction of the forces of his Higher Self. It is called the \"Scepter of Wisdom.\" Since theHegemon is the wielder of the Scepter of Dual Wisdom, from Chokmah, and therefore theMiter-head is split in two, and not closed, to indicate the Dual Manifestation of Wisdom and Truth;even as the Hall of the Neophyte is called \"The Hall of the Dual Manifestation of the Goddess ofTruth.\"(3) The Lamen of the Hegemon is explained in part in the Gradeof Philosophus:The peculiar emblem of the Hegemon is the CalvaryCross of Six Squares,within a Circle. This Cross embracesTiphareth, Netzach, Hod, and Yesod, and rests uponMalkuth. Also the Calvary Cross of Six Squares forms thecube and is thus referred to the Six Sephiroth ofMicroprosopus which are Chesed, Geburah, Tiphareth,Hod, and Yesod.In addition to this explanation, it represents the black Calvary Cross of Suffering, as theInitiator, by Trial and Self-Abnegation, and the Opener of the Way into Comprehension of theForces of the Divine Light. It is, therefore, suspended from a black Collar to show that suffering isin the Purgation of Evil.The next three inferior Officers do not wear cloaks or mantles, but only Lamens suspendedfrom black collars. The designs are in white on a black field to show that they are Administratorsof the Forces of Light acting through the darkness, under the Presidency of the Superior Officers.Kerux:The Kerux is stationed within the Portal of the Hall, and his duties are to see that the furnitureof the Hall is properly arranged before the opening, and guards the Inner Side of the Portal. Thesymbolism of this Officer will, as in the case of the others, gradually unfold itself to the Neophyte,as he passes from grade to grade. Also he admits the Fraters and Sorores and assists in thereception of the Candidate, at the command of the Hierophant whose Herald or Messenger he is.The Greek word, Kerux, means 'a Herald,\"Pursuivant' or 'Public messenger,' and wasequivalent to the Latin word, Caduceator (bearer of the Caduceus) for Hermes was a Herald of theGods. Their function in ancient Greece was to summon the Assembly (Ecclesia-Gr. which wasoriginally political and only later became a religious assembly, or church) and keep order therein.They had charge of the arrangements at sacrifices and carried wands of Office (skeptron fromwhich came scepter or Kerukeion, the latter being usually like the Caduceus). Their persons weresacred and under the protection of Zeus and also were messengers between enemies in war.The verb, Kerusso, meant 'to officiate as a Herald,' hence, 'to proclaim' (in varioussenses - e.g., of news of a person's name as a criminal, as winner of a contest, etc.) to summon aperson and then, to invoke the Gods or spiritual powers. The Kerux of the Order wears on hisbreast a lamen (from the Latin Lamina, 'a plate' or 'thin piece of metal') on which is depicted the2.11"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Caduceus of Hermes, which relates back to its original Greek meaning. The Kerux is the Herald,the Guardian and Watcher within the Temple, as Sentinel is Watcher without - and therefore in hischarge is the proper disposition of the furniture and stations of the Temple. he is also theproclaimer. The peculiar ensigns of Office are:(1)Red Lamp(2)Staff(3) Lamen(1) The Red Lamp signifies the Hidden Fire over which he watches. The lamp also represents thecenter of the Ruach, Tiphareth, which the Neophyte aspires to unite with so that the HiddenKnowledge beyond the veil can be revealed.(2) The Magic Staff of Power represents a ray of theDivine Light which kindles the Hidden Fire. In its OuterOrder form, this small (unwinged) staff resembles ateacher's pointer and is colored in the three colors (fromthe top to the point) red, yellow, and blue whichrepresent the three Mother Letters. In its Inner Orderform, this is the Wand of the Chief Adept and is thenshown as a Winged Caduceus, for placed on the Tree ofLife the upper wings touch Chokmah and Binah - thethree Supernals. The Seven lower Sephiroth areembraced by the twin serpents whose heads rest uponChesed and Geburah. When wielded by the Kerux, thestaff is gripped in the yellow color of Aleph and itsassociation to Air which is analogous to the Kerux'snature.(3) The lamen of the Kerux has on it the symbol of theWinged Caduceus (whose historical significance has beenalready explained) whose wings symbolize the transcendenceor rising of the spirit while the double serpent shows thedualism of opposites which the Neophyte has to overcome,for the serpent is the obstacle of man. For it is here in the 0= 0 that the Kerux must guide the Neophyte through theMystical Circumambulation past the various guards, checks,and balances contained therein.Stolistes:The Stolistes is the one who equips or clothes, and is a late Greek word equivalent toHierostolos - an Egyptian Priest who had charge of the sacred vestments. Neither form of thisword is found in the Classical Greek period or in connection with Greek Mysteries. Both belong tothe first century AD The verb, Styello, and its derivative Stolizo, means 'to put in train,' `to equip'or 'dress.' Stolis signifies `a garment' or 'robe,' while Stole (from the same root) means 'to equip'212"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"or 'fit out with clothes,' (originally 'an army') hence, 'agarment,' or 'robe.' This is the origin of the English word,stole, in the sense of an ecclesiastical vestment (compare withthe German word, Bestellen) though the word Stolisterionwas the vestry of a Temple.The Stolistes is stationed in the northern part of theHall, to the northwest of the Black Pillar, whose base is inHod. It is there as an Affirmer of the Powers of Moisture orWater reflected through the Tree into Hod. This Office isidentified by the following insignia:(1)Cup(2)Lamen(1)The Cup is the Receptacle filled with the Water fromHod so as to transmit its forces into Malkuth, restoring andpurifying the vital forces therein by cold and moisture (seeFigure 46). \"Goddess of the Scale of the Balance at theBlack Pillar\" is the name and she is \"The Light Shiningthrough the Waters of the Earth.\" In the 3=8 grade it says:The Cup of Stolistes partakes in part of thesymbolism of the Laver of Moses and the Sea ofSolomon. On the Tree of Life, it embraces nine ofthe Sephiroth, exclusive of Kether. Yesod andMalkuth form the triangle below, the former apex, thelatter the base. Like the Caduceus, it furtherrepresents the Three Elements of Water, Air, andFire. The Crescent is the Water which is above theFirmament, and the Triangle the consuming Firebelow, which is opposed to the celestial Firesymbolized by the upper part of the Caduceus.(2)On the Lamen is the symbol of the Cup.Dadouchos:The Dadouchos, meaning, a 'torch bearer,' was a hereditary Officer at the Mysteries of theEleusinian Demeter, whose torch symbolized her search for her daughter Persephone, the Spirit ofYouth and Spring. The verb, Daio, means, 'to kindle,' and the word, Dadouchos, is compoundedof Dais (or in Attic Greek, Das, accusative Dada) 'a torch,' especially a pine torch; and Echo - 'tohold' or 'to carry.' The Dadouchos, therefore, is posted in the South and symbolizes heat anddryness. He attends to the censer and the incense, and consecrates and Hall, the members and theCandidate with Fire. It is an important part of his duties to get ready and attend to all lights, fire,and incense used in the ceremonies.The Dadouchos is stationed towards the midst of the southern part of the Hall, to thesouthwest of the White Pillar, whose base is in Netzach, and is there as an Affirmer of the Powersof Fire, reflected down the Tree to Netzach. This Officer is identified by the following:213"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"./.11. %....110.11.1â¢Jâ â¢â¢61.(2) Lamen(1)The Censer of the Dadouchos is, \"the Receptacle of the Powers ofFire,\" and \"the transmitter of the Fire of Netzach to Malkuth,\" restoringand purifying the vital force therein by heat and dryness. \"Goddess ofthe Scale of the Balance of the White Pillar\" is the name of Dadouchos.(2)The Lamen of the Dadouchos is explained in the Zelator grade:The Hermetic Cross, which is also known as the Fyflot,Hammer of Thor, and Swastika, is formed of 17 squares taken from a square of 25lesser squares. These 17 fittingly squares represent the Sun, the four elements andthe Twelve Signs of the Zodiac.Sentinel:The last, and final Officer, is the Sentinel, or Phulax as he is sometimes called. His name isthought to have been derived from the French, Scentinelle, or the Italian, Sentinella. Some haveeven thought that it came from the French, Sentier, 'a footpath,' which in turn is derived from theLatin, Semita, 'a narrow way.' This Officer stands in charge of the Candidate atthe Portal, or outer opening of the straight and narrow way he is about to enter. The Greek word,Phulax, signifies, 'a Watcher,' `guard' or 'sentinel' - 'guardian' or 'keeper.' A fuller form of theword is Naophulax, meaning 'keeper of the Temple.' The verb, Phulasso, means, `to keep watchand ward,' especially by night - and we may think of the Phulax as, 'the watchman,' armed with alethal weapon to keep out intruders, and to prepare the Candidate as he stands in the outerdarkness.The Greek word, Phulacterion, means, 'a guarded place,' `a fort' or, in its secondarymeaning, 'a safeguard' or `preservative,' `an amulet,' for protection, and is familiar to us from thePhylacteries of the Jews which were strips of parchment, inscribed with texts from the Law, andworn as amulets on the forehead while praying. The Latin word corresponding to the Greek,Phulax, in a general sense, is Custos. The Officer is distinguished by the following:(1)Sword(2)Lamen(1)The Sword of the Sentinel had a black grip and goldguard. The black represents the darkest part of matter whilethe gold guard was a reflection of the Hidden Mysteries of theOrder. At all times, the Sword is drawn and held upright in theleft hand (for the duration of the ceremony) as a reminder ofthe seriousness of the occasion. Even when the Sentinelremains seated beside the door, (and outside the Portal, butstill inside the Hall) the Sword is still drawn.(2)The symbol of the Eye on the Lamen is that of theWatcher and is quite simplistic compared to some of theGolden Dawn Symbolism.All lamens of Outer Order Officers are in black and white.,Mâ 1274"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"215"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"SYMBOLISM OF THE OPENING - GENERALWithin the Z.1 document, the General Exordium says:1.The Speech in the Silence:2.The Words against the Son of Night:I The Voice of Thoth before the Universe in the presence of the Eternal Gods:4.The Formulas of Knowledge:5.The Wisdom of Breath:6.The Radix of Vibration:7.The Shaking of the Invisible:8.The Rolling Asunder of the Darkness:9.The Becoming Visible of Matter:10.The Piercing of the Coils of the Stooping Dragon:11.The Breaking forth of the Light:All these are in the Knowledge of Thoth.For some, the above verse may appear incomprehensible, but it is a codex for the breakingdown of the Opening Part of the 0 = 0 Ceremony. The general meaning, of the above verse, relatesto the Great Thoth, the highest aspect of the Hermes of the most ancient Egyptian Mysteries, andcorresponds almost to the Great Angel Metatron. It is the Archangel of Kether in the BriaticWorld. The Mercury of the Romans must not be confused with this Great Hermes. The doctrine ofGnosticism and of Valentinus approached those of the pure Kabbalah. In them we find Speech andSilence. Across the Abyss of Silence comes the Primal Speech. The Divine Ones here referred toare the Aeons of the Atziluthic World. These formulae of knowledge are designed in termscognizable to us in the lower world. Taking as an example, we have Eheieh, an implicit and explicitsound. \"Every being pronounces its existence, the Name of the Lord of Life, by inspiration andexpiration.\"The Macroprosopus is Aima and Abba, Mother-Father. The two nostrils pass up and downthe two breaths, as though two Great Pillars. These throw all things into vibration; compare theRashith ha-Gilgalim. Piercing of the Dragon's Coils suggests the freeing of Malkuth, which is alsoreferred to as the Washing of the Garments of the Queen, the inferior Mother. Then comes theBreaking Forth of the Light. Over Malkuth, as Guardians, are Metatron and Sandalphon, as theTwo Pillars, and Nephesch ha-Messiah, the animal soul of Messiah, the Shekinah or Presencebetween the Kerubim.1.The Speech in the SilenceThis relates to the knock that the Hierophant gives to start the ceremony and to announce thecommencement of a vibration in the Sphere of Sensation (aura) of the Candidate. This knock canbe done with a stamp of the foot. Some Hierophants use the base of the Scepter against theThrone.2.The Words Against the Son of NightHere we have the Cry of the Kerux - the Watcher Within, with the words \"HEKAS, HEKAS,ESTE BEBELOI\" (which roughly means that anyone who should not be present should get out!).The Kerux utters these words when he goes to the right of the Hierophant and raises higher Wand.This is a symbol of the Ray of the Divine Light from the White Triangle of the Three Supernals,216"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"which then descends into the Darkness, and warns the Evil and uninitiated to retire, so that theWhite Triangle may be formulated upon the Altar, through the combined effect of the formula ofthe Opening Ceremony.3.The Voice of Thoth before the Universe in the presence of the Eternal GodsThis is analogous to the opening speech of the Hierophant, where he asks the Kerux to checkthat the Hall is properly guarded, for this assures that the Portal is secure, and that the energy fromthe current of Thoth had now manifested into the ceremony.4.The Formulas of KnowledgeIn this instance, the Hierophant calls to the Hiereus to test the members present by the\"SIGNS OF KNOWLEDGE\" which shows that they, though in the Land of Blindness andIgnorance, have yet seen that the Triangle of Divine Light from the Three Supemals is formulatedin Darkness. You will note that the Hierophant gives the Sign of Silence towards the West, and itis not immediately followed by the Sign of Silence. For here the Hierophant has sent the current ofLight through to the Hiereus, but he cannot release it (through the Sign of Silence) until it linksdirectly into the Hiereus's Throne - for then the central axis is established through Samekh and Tau.Once he gives the words to reawaken the images or shells of the Godfonns, he then releases hiscurrent with the Sign of Silence, otherwise he would expend it and exhaust himself5. The Wisdom of BreathIt is noted that the names of the three chief Officers begin with the letter 'H' the letter ofbreath. This letter relates to its Coptic meaning, which to a certain extent is the letter H in English,and can only convey its meaning in part. Taking two examples we have the 'Ae concealed in thename Osiris by the H, the Greek capital letter, Eta. In the name Horns, it is manifest and violentlyaspirated, while in the name Thmaest, it is partly one and partly the other for it is compounded withthe letter 'T' in the Greek letter theta, 6 (H 'Ae' is attributed to Chesed - and 8 to Earth andSaturn. This is intended to affirm the Unknown Life, which is inspired from the Beyond, send outto Aries, the commencement of the spring of the year, the life which after being inspired, is breathedforth again. It is also the possible use of that breath, between the inspiration and the expiration, incombination between it and the forces of the microcosm.)6.The Radix of VibrationThe whole is rehearsal of the properties of the reflection of the element Air down through theMiddle Pillar of the Sephiroth. It represents the reflection of Air, from Kether, through Tiphareth,to Yesod, and even to the citron part of Malkuth. For the subtle Aethyr is, in Kether, inspired fromthe Divine Light beyond; thence reflected into Tiphareth, wherein it is combined with the reflexesfrom the alchemical principles in that great receptacle of the forces of the Tree. In Yesod, it affirmsthe foundation of a formula, and from Malkuth it is breathed forth or reflected back. This formulaecan be used by the Adept. Standing in his Sphere of Sensation he can, by his knowledge of thesacred rites, raise himself unto the contemplation of his Yechidah and from thence aspire (in thesense of the Adspire, i.e., to attract towards you in breathing) downwards to himself the LowerGenius as though temporarily to inhabit himself as its Temple (Note: see Regardie's THE MIDDLEPILLAR for a fuller explanation of this).Another formula of vibration is hidden here. Let the Adept, standing upright, his armsstretched out in the form of a Calvary Cross, Nibrate a Divine Name, bringing with the formulathere of a deep inspiration into his lungs. Let him retain the breath, mentally, pronouncing the217"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Name in his heart, so as to combine it with the forces he desired to awake thereby; thence sending itdownwards through his body past Yesod, but not resting there, but taking his physical life for amaterial basis, send it on into his feet. There he shall momentarily formulate the Name - then,bringing it rushing upward into the lungs, thence shall he breathe it forth strongly while vibratingthat Divine Name. He will send his breath steadily forward into the Universe so as to awake the-corresponding forces of the Name in the Outer World. Standing with arms out in the form of across, when the breath had been imaginatively sent to the feet and back, bring the arms forward in\"the Sign of the Enterer\" while vibrating the Name out into the Universe. On completing this,-make the \"Sign of Silence\" and remain still, contemplating the force you have invoked.This is the secret tradition mode of pronouncing the Divine Names by vibration, but let theAdept beware that he applies it only to the Divine Names of the Gods. If he does this thing-ignorantly, in working with the Elemental or Demonic Names, he may bring into himself terribleforces of Evil and Obsession. The method described is called \"The Vibratory Formula of theMiddle Pillar.\"7.The Shaking of the InvisibleThis refers to the \"Awakening of the Images - the Invisible Stations.\" Here the TempleOfficers must link their Sphere of Sensations with the Invisible Images of the Godforms through theVibratory formula.8.The Rolling Asunder of the DarknessThis particular phrase, of the General Exordium, relates to the symbolism of the MysticalCircumambulation in the Outer Temple - the Macrocosm. Here we have the Procession of Officersforming in the North in readiness for the \"Mystic Circumambulation in the Path of Light.\" This isformed in the North, beginning from the Station of Stolistes, the symbol of the Waters of Creationattracting the Divine Spirit, and therefore alluding to the Creation of the World by the Spirit and theWaters. The Order of the Mystic Circumambulation is as follows: First comes Anubis, the Watcherwithin. Next comes Thmaest, the Goddess of the Hall of Truth. Then comes Horns. Then comesthe Goddess of the Scales of Balance. Then come the members, if the Hall be large enough, and atthe end, the Watcher Without, the Sentinel. It is as though a gigantic Wheel were revolving, andexpanding as it is said: \"One Wheel upon Earth beside the Kerub.\" The name.bf the Sphere of thePrimum Mobile, Rashith ha-Gilgalim, signifies the heads or beginnings of whirling motions orrevolutions. Of this wheel in the Mystic Circumambulation, the ascending side begins from belowthe Pillar of Nephthys, and the descending side from the Pillar of Isis.9.The Becoming Visible of MatterThe above phrase still refers to the Mystic Circumambulation, but especially to the effect ofthe Rise of Light in the individual. These, of course, occur simultaneously with 8, but is placedhere to affirm that the subtle body centers [the Chakras of Kundalini Yoga - Eds.] awaken withinthe Officers and the Candidate. Here, the auras of the Officers flood with the light and power ofthe ceremony which to many are quite visible. The axis of this wheel is about the Invisible Stationof Harpocrates - as though that God, in the Sign of Silence, were there placed affirming theConcealment of the central Atom of the Wheel, which alone revolves not.10.The Piercing of the Coils of the Stooping DragonThis is best explained by referring to the Golden Dawn Lecture \"The Law of the ConvolutedRevolution of the Forces Symbolized by the Four Aces Round the Northern Pole\" which in turn can218"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"be related to the 'Stooping Dragon Formula.' This is extremely complex, and was originallyreserved for the Theoricus Adeptus Minor Grade, but the formula referred to above applies to theMicrocosm. The Mystic Circumambulation is symbolic of the Rise of Light, and from it is drawnanother formula for the circulation of the breath. It is the Formula of the Four Revolutions of theBreath (this of course does not mean the actual air inspired can be thus circulated, but only thesubtle Aether which may be drawn thence, and of which it is the vehicle) [i.e., the prana of theHindu yogis, and the Chi of the Chinese yogis - Eds.]. This formula should be proceeded by that ofthe Middle Pillar. By this method, having invoked the Power you wish to awaken in yourself, andcontemplated it, begin its circumambulation thus: Fill the lungs and imagine the Name vibrating inthe contained air. Imagine this vibration going down the left leg to the sole of the left foot - thencepassing over to the soul of the right foot - up the right leg to the lungs again where it is breathedout. Do this four times to the rhythm of the Fourfold Breath.11. The Breaking forth of the LightThe object of the Mystic Circumambulation is to attract and make the connection between theDivine Light above and the Temple. Therefore, the Hierophant does not quit his post to take parttherein, but remains there to attract by his Scepter, the Light from beyond the Veil. Each member,in passing, gives the Sign of the Enterer, thus projecting the Light forward on his Path from East toWest, as he is the Son of Osiris and inherits the Light by birthright from him. Therefore, he goes atonce to his station to fix the Light there. Thmaest, the Goddess of Truth, passes twice because herrule is of the Balance of the Two Scales, and she retires to her station between the Pillars there tocomplete the reflex of the Middle Column. The Watcher Within, and the rest, circumambulatethrice, as affirming the completion of the reflection of perfecting of the White Triangle of the ThreeSupernals upon the Altar.Then follows the Adoration of the God, the Vast One, the Lord of the Universe - at whichagain all give the Sign of the Enterer, the Sign of the Projection of the Force of Light. Only thendoes the Watcher declare that the sun has arisen and that the Light shineth in darkness. Now comesthe battery of the 0 = 0 Grade - the single knock by the Hierophant which is repeated by theHiereus and Hegemon. This affirms the establishment of the White Triangle and therefore theCompletion of the Opening Ceremony. The mystic words \"Khabs Am Pekht\" which accompany theknocks seal the image of the Light. Their significance implies, by various Kabbalistic methods ofanalysis, as well as by certain reading of the Coptic and Egyptian hieroglyphics, \"Light inExtension\" or \"May Light be extended in Abundance upon you.\" Knox Om Pax is the Greekcorrupted pronunciation of this, put here to link the right origin.SYMBOLISM OF THE OPENING - PARTICULARFrom the first knock a current is activated in the Flierophant. This is drawn to the Hiereus,through Hegemon, then from the Dadouchos, to the Stolistes in the form of a cross with the altar asthe center. This is a combination of the energy of all four crosses worn by those Officers on theDais. The Kerux, you will note, is not the recipient of any of the arms of the cross, due to the factthat his position is not a fixed but a fluid one.THE CONSECRATIONThe consecration is an extremely precise movement pattern where, once the Officers havelinked the Light between them, they move in unison, like the minute hand of a clock. Each stopsand starts together. You will also note that, at each poahiop in which they consecrate it it is done219"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"in a triad which represents the Kabbalistic Supernals of the un-manifested. The use of the first twofingers by the Stolistes, when consecrating, was something passed on to us from Whare Ra. It wasconsidered quite important. The two fingers were said (by one Whare Ra Adept of 8=3 rank) torepresent the Horns of the Evil One which present a mirror image to any negativity lurking about.It is thought to nullify and confound anything of evil intent. The Dadouchos also uses these same-two fingers to work the chain on the censer. Much of this, though, was a variation of the oldchurch theme of banishment or excommunication. However, if one projects with the fingers,through the Ruach, it had a more effective outcome while silently vibrating the appropriate Name in-each quarter, and can clear the air very quickly. This effectiveness is based on the power of theGodform one has assumed for the duration of the ceremony.One of the things, we were taught was that, whenever possible, try to get two people, whoare harmonious, to play the part of Stolistes and Dadouchos. When antagonism exists, it willultimately come out, and usually it will play havoc with the ceremony. These two Officers arecontrolled by the Hegemon as the tip of the triad. It is his duty (generally speaking the part ofHegemon was played by a woman to help identify more quickly with the Maat principle) to link hisaura with that of the Pillars, then from them to the Stolistes and Dadouchos while they linkthemselves. He must draw from one and give to the other (in terms of empathic energy) throughthe power of the Pillars. Some years ago, a friend of ours, who held the Office of Hegemon, gaveus an example of a married couple, who held the Offices of Stolistes and Dadouchos, and whoattended a ceremony just after a bitter argument. She, as Hegemon, had to try and balance theirenergies, which proved to be quite a formidable task for the duration of the ceremony. It has alsobeen our experience that checking the elemental positions from a person's natal chart to see if theyare suited for positions such as Stolistes and Dadouchos, is very important. The pivot of Stolistesand Dadouchos is like the half-hour position of a clock - the two Officers must be directly oppositeeach other during the movement. The one who finishes the consecration first waits for the other tofinish before moving. The published papers of Regardie show a quarter-hour position. This waschanged by those at Bristol Temple.flit CIRCUMAMBULATIONWhen the Golden Dawn rituals were first penned by Mathers, the circumambulation of theRise of Light was always circular and around the outside of the Pillars. However, as the ritualexpertise developed within the Stella Matutina, a number of Adepti became aware of rings or spiralsof energy emanating from the Altar. While it is true that the initiating power comes from theHierophant's Throne in the East, the Altar also generates power as well. This is one of the reasonswhy it is situated where it is, and not in the East. By analogy, the Ilerophant's Throne is linked toa light to turn the current on while the Altar is analogous to the light bulb situated in the center ofthe room to spread light to all areas equally.Though Adepti in the Stella Matutina (among whom were Dion Fortune - according toRegardie), were aware of these energy rings during ritual, very little was explained in the Zdocuments as to why they existed when the Portal was opened in the 0 = 0. In New Zealand, westarted experiments by tracing these patterns of energy. We found that they were not 'rings' asoriginally thought, but spirals of exactly three and a half turns, the same number of turns as in thecircumambulation. The outward reach of the spirals went as far as the Pillars, then ceased. Itoccurred to us to do the circumambulation within the Pillars, instead of without, and this brought animmediate change in tempo for the whole ceremony.The members would start off very close to the Altar, then gradually work their way outwardwith each turn. Some members became very adept at detecting the spiral, by tracing the energypatterns with their knee, which felt like a warm current of air or heat sensation. This was thelargest modern change in the rituals by Thoth-Hermes members, though we do suggest to thosereaders, who are active in Golden Dawn ritual, to try this method for themselves and see what the220"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"results bring. The spiral, of course, in no way interferes with the basic essence of its origins butrather compliments and even transcends it.One of the main ritual problems that Adepti of the Stella Matutina, and later in theSmaragdum Thalasses, complained about was the 'dead air' during the old circumambulation, assometimes they would connect and sometimes they would not. It was found that in the originalcircumambulation, the Officers picked up and tried to use the last circle of the spiral. The Pillarpositions became of prime importance because, at Temples like Whare Ra, a little closer to theAltar than normal allowed for the final spiral from the Altar to encompass them. In cases when thePillars were placed in the outer ring, this distorted the spirals from the Altar. Two things nowbecame apparent. The first was that the altar size generated different size spirals. The second wasthat the Pillars stopped or interfered with the spirals which were completely spent after three and ahalf circumambulations. If the Pillars were placed too close to the Altar, then the spirals or eventhe old form of the circumambulation became lop-sided, and emanated very erratic forms of energy.Another point of note is that the spirals took one directly over the station of the Evil One whichgave the circumambulation more control and power (which will be discussed later).East221"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"THE PARTICULAR EXORDIUMIn the Z.1 Document the Particular Exordium states:1.At the Ending of the Night: At the Limits of the Light: Tho-oth stood before theUnborn Ones of Time:2.Then was formulated the Universe:3.Then came forth the Gods thereof:4.The Aeons of the Bomless beyond:5.Then was the Voice vibrated:6.Then was the Name declared.7.At the Threshold of the Entrance,8.Between the Universe and the Infinite,9.In the Sign of the Enterer, stood Tho-oth,10.As before him were the Aeons proclaimed.11.In Breath did he vibrate them:12.In symbols did he record them:13. For betwixt the Light and the Darkness did he stand.The Bomless Ones of Time referred to are those coruscations of the Divine Light which areabove Kether of Atziluth. In such Supernal realms, the Ain Soph, though negative to us, is thereintensely positive. Thence came forth the Gods, the Voice, the Aeons, and the Name. TheEgyptian Gods were generally differentiated by their Crown: Amen-Ra by the feathers, Mo-oth(Mast) has the same headdress as Hons. She corresponds to the Aima Elohim. The highHermes-Tho-oth has the same headdress as Amoun Kneph, the Sacred Spirit. Tho-oth, Truth, hastwo aspects - the higher and the lower. The higher is absolute, the lower is suitable to humancomprehension. To tell the higher form of truth, to one who cannot understand it is to lie to himbecause, though correctly formulated, it will not be correctly received.Applied directly to the 0 = 0, the Particular Exordium is the form of the ADORATION.Holy art Thou, Lord of the Universe! (lines 1-2)Holy are Thou, Whom Nature hast not Formed! (lines 3-6)Holy art Thou, the Vast and the Mighty One! (lines 7-12)Lord of the Light and of the Darkness. (line 13)The Adoration is done immediately after the circumambulation. There are three Signs of theEnterer and a Sign of Silence and these are directed towards the throne of the Hierophant. Theobject of this was for the Hierophant to push the Veil of Paroketh asunder with the self-containedenergy in the Temple, now firmly linking itself to the energy of the Second Order through theHierophant. The Temple actually takes three phases to open correctly. The first is the knock andexchanges by the Officers. The second is the circumanibulation and the third is the Adoration. Atthis point the Altar is the focal point of energy, but the Adoration links the portal firmly with thepowers beyond the Veil. In this instance there are three Signs of the Enterer before the final Sign ofSilence. With the Sign of the Enterer the energy is directed at the Throne of the Hierophant, who,as Osiris, absorbs this energy which comes to him from a balance of all Officers. In this instance heis just like an electrical conductor. The energy links to the Officers on the floor, through theHierophant to the points beyond the Veil. The reason for the three Signs of the Enterer is that theyemulate the power of the Supernals [i.e., Kether, Chokmah, and Binah - Eds.] shown by the triangleon the Altar. The final Sign of Silence acts as a form of protection against any backlash of thecurrent, pushed by the Hierophant. This prevents a residue from coming back which could destroy222"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"the created portal.With the words, \"Khabs Am Pekht, Knox Om Pax - Light in Extension\" the Hierophant thenseals the link to the portal which the Adoration broke through to receive. As each Officer knocks,the energy comes back through the Hierophant and links to them. The Kerux, Dadouchos, andStolistes, as lesser Officers, are not included. The Hegemon, for example, handles the energy ofStolistes, Dadouchos, and Kerux, as the Hegemon must regulate the energy to the other three.To finalize this part of the ceremony, the Kerux removes the Lamp, Rose, Cup, and Paten ofbread and salt from the Altar. Starting at the East, and moving in a clockwise direction, togetherthese items work on many different levels. hi their more basic form, they represent the organs of thebody of the deceased, and are placed in the four directions with the organs of the Alimentary system(the most material and earthy) in the North, those of the circulatory system in the South, thereceptive system in the East (the Source of Life and Light), and the organs that cast out in the West(which borders on the Qlippoth). The relationship to these bodily organs may appear at first glanceto be symbolic, but they are actually worked on through the magnetized process of ritual. DionFortune, in her book PSYCHIC SELF DEFENCE, claimed that the 0 = 0 ritual she experiencedactually repaired her vitality. Many others have made similar claims here in New Zealand and inEngland. When the implements are taken from the Altar, the corresponding process taking part inthe Candidate is fundamentally one of removal - of the etheric blockages in the aura, so that itbecomes attuned to that of the ceremony: for the Candidate is controlled by the Temple Officerslong before he or she enters the Hall. The current that they work under is the Osirian one, throughthe imagery of the Hall of the Two Truths, for this allows the Order access to the Higher Self, whomust stand apart from the Candidate, during part of the ceremony. Taylor often stated that theplacement of the implements is vital to the success or failure of the ceremony. Not only must theybe placed in their respective directions, but they must link correctly to the Godforms that theyrepresent as well. Though the Canopic Gods are in the corners of the Hall, it must be rememberedthat they cover an entire area, between each Cardinal Point, and thus, are placed centrally betweenthp twn223"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"WestThe spirals, initiated by the Kerux, areextremely important, for when done correctly,they draw the power from the central Altar, andlink it to the Cardinal Points. This is not to beconfused with the actions of thecircumambulation which gives the Rise of Light.This is distinctly different, as thecircumambulation allows the Light, or thecurrent vibrational pitch, to enter the body of theOfficers, stimulate the etheric body of theCandidate, and help open the Temple. Thespirals expand the consciousness of theCandidate, through the Osirian current orinfluence, so that the symbolic parts of theCandidate can be removed correctly and withoutdamage. Taylor quoted a case where the Kerux,during one 0 = 0 ceremony, accidentallydropped the Paten in the South.After the ceremony, the Neophyte had aninflamed intestinal disorder that was a mysteryto the doctors. When Felkin heard of this, hedid a small ceremony involving the replacementof the Paten, and within an hour after the ceremony, the intestinal pain and disorder ceased.Apart from the etheric influences directly on the body of the Candidate, the implements on theAltar represent the component parts of the Ruach, analogous to the Will (Rose), Memory (Cup),Reason (Paten & Salt), Desire (Lamp), and Imagination as the component part (the Altar) whichholds all together. This is the start of the dismantling of the bondage that the Ruach has over theCandidate, and allows the Light of the Neshamah to illuminate the mind.224"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"SYMBOLISM OF THE ADMISSION OF THE CANDIDATEPreparation of the Candidate.The Candidate is waiting without the Portal under the care of the Sentinel - \"The WatcherWithout\" - that is, under the care of the form of Anubis of the West, symbolically called that, hemay keep off the \"Dog-Faced Demons,\" the opposer's of Anubis, who rise from the confines wherematter ends, to deceive and drag down the soul. The Ritual of the 31 Paths says:Since ever dragging down the soul and leading it from sacred things, from theconfines of matter arise the terrible Dog-Faced Demons never showing a true imageunto mortal gaze.The real link of the Candidate, with the Order, comes through his or her application to jointhe Order. This fine etheric thread becomes the link, with the Candidate, that enables the subtlecenters to be manipulated by the ceremony going on within the main Hall.The Hegemon, the representative of the Goddess of Truth and Justice, superintends thepreparation and symbolism. He is the Presider of the Equilibrium, and administrates the process ofequilibrium, in the Candidate himself through the symbols of rectitude and self-control.The actual preparation of the Candidate should be performed by the Sentinel - the \"WatcherWithout\" - to insure that this preparation is accomplished, so that the establishment of equilibriumcan occur. Therefore, the Hegemon superintends the preparation, rather than actually perform it.A triple cord is bound around the body of the Neophyte, symbolizing the binding andrestriction of the lower nature. It is triple in reference to the White Triangle of the Three Supernals.The eyes are bandaged to symbolize that the light of the material world is but darkness andillusion compared with the radiance of the Divine Light. The preparation also represents a certaintemporary binding and restriction of the natural body.The Candidate's Entrance Into the HallThe single knock, given by the Hegemon, outside the door, represents the consenting will ofthe natural human to receive the force formulated by the Hierophant. It is answered by the Kerux,inside, as if a witness were confirming the same. This being done, the Kerux, as a witness, demandsauthority from the Hierophant to admit the Candidate into the Hall of Truth and Justice. TheHierophant, granting permission, seals the Candidate's aura, with a new name given to the physicalbody of the outward man, butsignifying the aspirations of itssoul.When the Candidateenters the Hall (normally fromthe West) he becomes acornerstone of a triangle. TheHegemon is opposite and levelwith him. The Sentinel is behindthem, making up the tip of thetriangle. At this juncture, it isimportant to remember that thePortal of the ceremony does notstretch to the four walls of the225"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Hall, but rather, resembles a spherical shape. The exact size of it depends on the Hall, but there isnormally quite a few feet around the edge, where other members, not those taking part, sit and viewthe ceremony. In front of the triangle, without the Portal, an identical triangle just inside the Portalis formed by the Kerux, Stolistes, and Dadouchos.The Portal becomes the separating point between the two triangles. Particular attention mustbe made to the rim of the Portal, for no Officer is to go outside it. To breach the Portal, during theceremony, opens it to negative influences. Crossing over, from one side to the other, must be donecorrectly. The Hegemon is the only one who can do this during the ceremony because he is anotherone of the forms of Maat, part of the basic essence of the formulation of the Hall itself One canonly ascertain exactly where the Portal is through experience, though in practice it is easily foundand detected by a heat sensation that usually is about 12 inches in diameter.To bring the Candidate over the Portal, the Hegemon must first have him consecrated whilehe stands on the band of the Portal itself. This alters his already attuned aura so that it will balancewith the energy within the Portal.The Kerux instantly bars the Candidate's passage to mark that, though he had been admitted,the natural human of unpurified desires cannot be a dweller in the Hall of Truth. The consecrationimmediately calls into action the Pillars of the Candidate's own sphere of sensation. This is the firstof four consecutive consecrations because, when the Pillars of the Tree are projected onto theSphere of Sensation, there are four Pillars, of which the Middle Pillar is the axis. The externalPillars represent the boundaries of the aura. The central Pillar represents the subtle body centers, orthe minor chakras, situated on the front of the body (these are grouped Kabbalistically) but the mainseven chakras are not directly stimulated.The. Hegemon uses his Ruach to stimulate that of the Candidate's. At this point in theceremony, the astral appearance of the Candidate is that of a form wrapped in darkness, as ifextinguished thereby, and having unto his right, and unto his left, the faint semblance of the twoGreat Pillars of Fire and of Cloud, from which issues faint rays into the Darkness which cover him.Immediately above his sphere of sensation, there will appear a ray of bright light, as ifpreparing to penetrate the darkness covering him. The result of this will be that the Candidate,during the whole Ceremony of Admission, will usually appear to be somewhat automatic andvague. This is not unlike the Indian Guru helping a student by giving him some energy so thatcertain blockages can be removed, but on a much lower scale.The break in the Portal, caused as both the Candidate and the Hegemon cross over, is held incheck by the Kerux, with the help of the Stolistes and Dadouchos who use their energy to focus onclosing the opening after the crossing.Another point of significance is also made apparent by the Candidate, dressed in black,representing the dark untrodden Path, and the Hegemon, in white, representing the illuminated way.The Candidate and the Hegemon enter the darkest part of Malkuth and they walk to the lightestpart, citron. This doctrine is that in Malkuth, there are four Kabbalistic Tree's of Life, each relatedto a letter of YHVH or simply the Four Worlds applied to Malkuth. The Candidate must go fromthe Malkuth of Assiah (Heh) to Malkuth of Atzlluth (Yod).Now, the Hegemon, throughout the ceremony, acts as a guide, prompter, and answerer forthe Candidate. His Office, toward the Candidate, is analogous to that of higher HigherSoul - wherefore also the Hegemon holds in his hand the mitre-headed Scepter, to attract, since it isthe Scepter of Wisdom, the Higher Self of the Candidate.At this moment, as the Candidate stands before the Altar, as the simulacrum of the HigherSelf is attracted, so also arises the form of the Evil Persona of the Candidate - and were it not forthe power of the 42 lettered name, in the Palaces of Yetzirah, (the Gods of which name are usuallycalled the \"Great Assessors of Judgment\") the actual Evil Persona would at once formulate and beable to obsess the Ruach of the Candidate. For seeing that at this time the simulacrum, of theHigher Soul, is attracting the Neschamah of the Candidate. The human will is not as powerful inthe Ruach, for the moment, because the Aspirant of the Mysteries is now divided. That is, his226"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Neschamah is directed to the contemplation of his Higher Self attracted by the Hegemon. Hisnatural body is bound and blinded, higher Ruach threatened by the simulacrum of the Evil Persona,attracted by Omo-Szathan, and a species of shadow of himself, thrown onward to the place of thePillars where the Scales of Judgment are set. At the same time, the first consecration establishes asemblance to the Pillars, on his right and left, it also has drawn forth from him a semblance of himself to the place vacated by the Hegemon between the Pillars.Here, then, stands the shadow of the Candidate while the Scales of Balance oscillates unseen.Unseen and colossal, there is, imaged before him, Tho-oth, as Metatron, in the Sign of the Entererof the Threshold. He is ready, according to the decision of the human will, to permit or withholdthe descent of the Lower Genius of the Candidate.Ink OBLIGATION OF 11-11, CANDIDATEThe Obligation of the Candidate has three major functions. The most obvious one is towardsthe preservation of the Order's magnanimity through secrecy. The next level is the binding processthat submits the Candidate as part of the new-found Order, which in many ways is a form ofesoteric discipline. The final, and deepest phase, is the action or effect the Obligation has on theCandidate through the actions of the Ruach.When the right hand is placed within the triangle on the Altar, the Ruach is then controlled bythe Will - through the operation of Geburah (through Elohim Gibor and the Arch-angel Kamael),and the vibration of this Sephirah within the Candidate. The Will, under this Arch-angel's direction,then helps with the force the Candidate had bound him or herself to. In simple terms, the Will actsas a type of subconscious police force.Now a great deal has been said of the Golden Dawn Neophyte Obligation. Taylor taught usthat an Oath, such as this, was in reality up to the dictates of one's own conscience. Some haveconsidered the obligation as a symbol of the Lightning Flash coming down the Tree of Life, whichdescends into the aura, but in effect, no such thing happens. The obligation binds the Candidate tohis Higher Self As Crowley put it, the Obligation affirms the very existence of the devotee, andthat is inherent in our survival instincts, i.e., is not to put ourselves at anyone's mercy whether theperson be in the Order or not. The Obligation activates man's affirmation of his existence, as linkedwith a form that is beyond the sense of the self to fully comprehend, thus pushing it deep into thelayers of the self.Clairvoyant observation of the Candidate, during the Oath, shows a red ray of Geburah isproduced in the Sphere of Sensation of the Candidate. This is a combination of fear and martialdiscipline. The Obligation of the Neophyte uses the will, through the faculty of the imagination, tolink other parts of the Ruach together. Also, when the Obligation is taken, the Higher Self stands inthe Station of Harpocrates - the God of Silence, whose form is to protect the Candidate from theEvil One in front of him. Once this silence is broken, the Evil One can then take over as theprotection of Harpocrates is withdrawn.Meanwhile, the Great Assessors of Judgment examine the truth of the accusations formulatedby the evil and averse antithesis. The Assessors of Judgment come not under the head of theInvisible Stations, but during the Obligation and Circumambulation of the Candidate. Until he isbrought to the light, they hover immediately about the limits of the Portal, with their evil antithesisimmediately below. Therefore, when the Candidate stands before the Altar, prior to the Obligation,the decision is actually taken by the human will of the Candidate. He sees a disintegration of hiscomponent parts. The process of symbolic judgment takes place during the speech of theHierophant to the Candidate, the answer of the Hegemon, and his consent to take the Obligation.The moment the Candidate consents, the Hierophant advances between the Pillars, as if toassert that the judgment is concluded. He advances, by the Invisible Station of Harpocrates, to thatof the Evil Triad. He symbolically stomps down, so that, as Aroueris, he stands upon the opposer.He then comes to the East of the Altar, interposing between the place of the Evil Triad and the227"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Candidate. At the same time, the Hierophant advances on the Candidate's left. The Hegemon, onhis right, formulates about him the symbol of the Higher Triad, before he places his hand upon the-symbol of the Three Supernals lying upon the Altar. Again, before doing so, he has been bidden tokneel in adoration of that symbol, as if the natural man abrogated his will before the DivineConsciousness.As he kneels, in the presence of the Triad of Aroueris, Thmaa-est and Horus, he places hisleft hand in that of his initiator to affirm his passive reception of the ritual. His right hand is on thewhite triangle as a symbol of higher passive aspiration towards his Higher Self. His head is bowedto represent the voluntary submission of the human will to the divine - and for this latter reason herepeats in the Obligation higher name in the Outer World.A very important part of the Obligation is the use of the Sword by the Hiereus. In the hands-of an untrained Officer more harm than good can be caused. This is yet another reason for theTemple Officers on the floor to be all Inner Order members.There were at least three people at Whare Ra Temple that had their clairvoyant abilityremoved after the Sword touched the nape of the neck. One person, who could see auras to a highdegree, lost this ability immediately and was told by his Seniors that it would come back better thanbefore - something which did not happen. Twenty years later, another identical case occurred.Taylor recalled it happening a number of times. Since the discipline at Whare Ra, regardingexcellence, was quite strict, one can only come to the conclusion that the Officer of Hiereus had notperformed his function correctly, in the field of magnetic manipulation, at this vital moment in theceremony. While a few lost clairvoyant abilities, quite a number gained it, and, as the Sword of theHiereus was placed at the nape of the neck, a distinct click could be heard by those around theCandidate. This was usually considered a sign that this part of the ceremony was done well.Taylor maintained that a good Hierophant should always meet the Candidate informally, andstudy his aura, to see if there are any abnormalities in it so that incidents of lost clairvoyance couldbe avoided. In one incident, recalled by Taylor, he actually refused to do a 0 = 0 ceremony becausehe read, in the Candidate's aura indicators, of mental unbalance (which caused quite a stir at thetime). The individual was put through some time later by another Hierophant, and Taylor'spredictions proved correct, some months later, when the individual was placed in psychiatric care.When individuals showed natural clairvoyant abilities, during the Obligation, Taylor would alwaysreinforce the Candidate's aura with his own magnetism to prevent the incorrect use of the Sword inthe hands of an inexperienced Hiereus.The Hierophant gives one knock, affirming that the submission unto the Higher Self isperfect. Only at this moment, does the invisible and colossal figure of Tho-oth cease to be in theSign of the Enterer, and give the Sign of Silence, permitting the first real descent of the Genius ofthe Candidate, who descends to the Invisible Station of Harpocrates as a witness of the Obligation.The Hiereus and the Hierophant return to their thrones, and therefore it is not Aroueis, butOsiris himself, that addresses the speech to the Candidate - \"The Voice of My Higher Self,\" etc.,which confirms the link established between the Neschamah and the Genius, by formulating theconception thereof into the Ruach. For this, Osiris speaks in the character of the Higher Soul, thesymbolic form of which is standing between the columns before him. The affirmation of the HigherSoul, as the God of the human, does not mean that this is the only God. Rather, it indicates that itis the only presentment of him which the natural human can grasp at all. Neither is it just to say thatthe Higher Soul is one with God, seeing that the part is by no means the whole; nor can the wholebe accurately and sufficiently described as an assemblage of parts. Let not the reverence for theGod of thy self cause thee by a misconception to loose thy reverence for the Gods who liveforever - the Aeons of Infinite Years. Herein is a great error, and one which may, in its ultimate,bring about the fall of the genius. This is a sin which entails none the less terrible consequences,because it is a sign of the Higher Plane, where the choice is not between good and evil, but betweenthe lower and higher forms of good.228"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"THE ORCUNIBULATION OF THE CANDIDATE.In the first spiral of the circumambulation, knocks are given in the East and West only. Theconcept here is to instill in the Candidate a sense of equilibrium, for those knocks which signify theMiddle Pillar of balance, represent the central axis of the Tree of Life in the ceremony. Moreimportantly though, it activates the realization of the Middle Pillar within the body of the Candidatehimself. This subtlety teaches the Candidate focalization (this form of awareness was neverintended to be instantaneous but should develop over the ensuing months between the Neophyteand the Zelator grade). Therefore, the Mystic Circumambulation, in the Path of Darkness led bythe Kerux with symbolic light, formulates the Higher Soul, which is not only Divine Light, butrather a spark from the Ineffable Flame. The Kerux, in his turn, is but the Watcher of the Gods.After the Kerux comes the Hegemon, the translator of the Higher Self, leading the Candidate.Then come the Goddesses of the Scales of the Balance, the Stolistes and the Dadouchos. Theymove once round; the formation, in the darkness of Binah angles of the White Triangle of the ThreeSupernals. The Hierophant knocks once, as they pass him, in affirmation of Mercy - the Hiereus inaffirmation of severity; and the invisible Assessors each give the Sign of the Enterer as theCandidate passes on his way. At the second passing of the Hierophant the knock affirms thecommencement of the angle of Chokmah.The first barring of the Candidate, on the second spiral, by the Kerux, is extremely important,for while he bars the gateway to the West, he actually does so in the South. This represents afurther division of the spiral. The red (shin) part of the Kerux' s Wand is placed firmly in theCandidate's Tiphareth center, working directly through his Ruach to stimulate and attract thecurrent of the Chiah into direct operation. To perform this function correctly, it can not be done bysomeone in the Outer Order (yet another argument for Inner Order members for Temple floorOfficers). The Kerux, according to the Z.3, uses his Magic Staff of Power to represent a ray ofDivine Light which kindles the Hidden Fire. The Red Ray of the Kerux, through his Ruach, goesthrough directly to the Ruach of the Candidate, by the power of the fiery part of the Wand. TheKerux grips the Wand in the yellow (airy) band. This shows he is in control of his own Ruach, thendirect it to the Chiah by the power of the Secret Fire.The Caduceus Lauren that he wears also has a part to play which goes beyond meresymbolism. Its function is to balance the energy directed by the Kerux, and is placed directly overthe Kerux's Tiphareth center, analogous to his Ruach. Any emotive force of a disruptive nature isheld in check by this. Also it controls the amount of energy which the Candidate is stimulated with.The consecration by Fire and Water is more than a simple consecration. The positioning ofthese Officers, in relationship to the Candidate, is always in the form of a triangle.229"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The Kerux retains his position while the Stolistes and Dadouchos move up together so theyare both alongside the Candidate. Then they turn 180 degrees, to face him, while still maintainingthe triangular position around him. During the consecration by Fire the Dadouchos slightly turnsthe Candidate towards him, but not enough to disrupt the pressure of the Kerux's Wand. TheStolistes then repeats a similar action when purifying by Water. Apart from the practicalconsiderations, this slight turning is also to instill the concept that, no matter which way theCandidate is turned, the pressure of resistance is still applied to him. Realizing that he has no way togo but ahead, the Candidate must surrender himself to his guides who represent, by reflection, the-White Triangle of the Supernals on the Altar. They represent the three phases of his Soul to guidehim on the Pathway of Light.When the Candidate reaches the Throne of the Hiereus, he is then barred a second time. The-regular challenge is part of the Current of Horus (note that the central lines from the Templefloor is mainly under the influence of Horns, East to West). Here, the Hiereus confronts the soul ofthe Candidate with the negative forces present within the self. These are Qlippothic in origin, and-must be faced by recognizing their existence, for not to do so allows them to take over aspects ofour own natures. What has happened here is that the Hiereus, in this instance, represents thearchetype of these forces. His Sword is placed about 6 inches in front of the Candidate's Tiphareth-center and as such threatens higher Ruach. The Hiereus projects at the Candidate an image offoreboding. The flat of the Sword being held in this barring position, the Hiereus vibrates theenergy of the Qlippothic force (which he guards) and which the Candidate is able to recognize sowhen he encounters this force again he can withdraw from it.The second consecration is designed to rid the Candidate of the Qlippothic forces he wasexposed to. The Hiereus must try and project fear of these elements to the Candidate which franklytakes a good deal of effort. This is done through the Will of the Ruach, directed through the red(Geburah) part of the Sword, centralized with the Tiphareth center of the Hiereus.There are a number of ways to do this, but the simplest way is for the Hiereus to encase hisaura with the red ray of Geburah, by vibrating `Elohim Gibor.' This is generally done when theCandidate is barred at the South. As the Candidate is ushered towards the West, he then directs theenergy through the Sword, and the vibrates 'YHVH ALOAH VE-DAAS,' so that a red (Geburah)and gold (Tiphareth) magnetic influence are present. It is this combination that emanates to theRuach of the Candidate so that the Qlippothic forces can be sensed by the Candidate in the future.The next barring of the Candidate is at the North - the gateway to the East. At this point, theKerux does not initially touch the Candidate, but is halted by the Hegemon, using arm pressure.The Kerux merely waves his Wand in front of the Candidate, by the center band. This also lightly-touches the Ruach of the Candidate, before the final post in the East is reached. Here, theCandidate has reached the point analogous to Binah, which in itself relates to the Nesharnah, whichis then stimulated through the Mem part of the Wand of the Kerux.The next barring and consecration of the Candidate is an extension of the previous one, andthe commencement of the formulation of the angle of Kether. The hood-wink is again slipped up,giving a still further glimpse of the nature of the Divine Light, though to the mind of the Candidate,an imperfect one. Therefore it is to him, as expressed in the answer of the Hegemon, a light dimlyseen through the darkness, yet heralding a glory beyond the speech of the Hierophant, thatformulates the forces of the hidden central pillar.1HE SEALING OF THE CANDIDATE'S AURA.After the circumambulation, the Candidate passes to the Altar of the Universe, which receivesthe influences of the three Pillars. It should be as though the ray from the Divine would descend--into the darkness of the mind, for then, but not till then, is he fitted to realize what are the firstthings necessary to the \"Search for the Shining Light.\"As the Hierophant advances, along the Path of Samekh, he represents the Divine Light230"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"coming through the Ruach of the Candidate. He pauses briefly, between the Pillars, and his form isstabilized by the Goddess of Scales, as he also represents the Holy Guardian Angel (a titlesometimes analogous to the Tarot Trump 'Temperance' in its archetypal representation), theperfected man. When the Hierophant reaches Yesod, he again pauses. Here the Hierophant, as thedescending Light of the Order, enters the Candidate's Nephesch, through a direct magnetic link.As he stands on the station of the Evil One, he then.takes control of the Nephesch, and pushes asideany negativity, so that the light draws in the light from above to the Candidate, while the Banner ofthe East reflects it in the Temple.The form of Harpocrates now formulates a protective envelope around the Candidate, whichdraws forth the Higher Self of the Candidate, for the negative influences (now under the control ofthe Hierophant) cannot harm it. The Hierophant gives a single knock to seal the matter and theninvokes the Lord of the Universe. Then only is the hood-wink removed. The Flierophant, Hiereus,and Hegemon join Scepters and Sword above the Candidate's head, thus formulating the SupernalTriad, and assert his reception into the Order. They then recite the mystic words to seal the currentof the Flowing Light. This is the point where the magnetic influence of the three Officers worktogether, and they direct their influence to the aura of the Candidate. The energy of eachimplement vibrates so that, at this point, a triangle of light can be seen (clairvoyantly) above theCandidate's head. This is brought to a fine point with the words `KHABS AM PEKHT - KNOXOM PAX - LIGHT IN EXTENSION.'The Hierophant now calls forwardthe Kerux, cautioning the Candidate thatthe light has preceded him without hisknowledge. It represents to him here, avague formulation of ideas which as yet hecan neither grasp nor analyze. This light isnot a symbol of the Higher Self, but a rayfrom the Guardians of the Orderthemselves.Only after having thus been broughtto the light, is the Candidate led to the Eastof the Altar - the place of the Station of theEvil Triad - to affirm that with this light, hewill be able to cast out, and trample on hisEvil Persona, which, when it has been putin its place, will then become a support tohim. It is to the Hiereus, \"Avenger of theGods\" therefore, that the duty, ofentrusting the Candidate with the SecretSigns, etc., is delegated. It is he whoplaces him for the first time between thePillars, and superintends his finalconsecration - thus bringing the peculiarforce, handled by the Hiereus, to the aid ofthe Candidate, so that he may more safelyand resolutely combat the temptations of the Evil Persona.The Hierophant has returned to his Throne, while the Hegemon holds the insignia of theHiereus, while he confers the Signs, etc. He thus affirms the necessity of the force represented bythe Hiereus of the Black Pillar, and the Hegemon East of the White Pillar again form a Triad, whichhere represents the reflection of the Three Supemals. The Higher Soul is formulated between thePillars in the Place of Equilibrium. The Candidate is in the place of the Evil Triad, and the Hiereusnow advances to the place of Harpocrates between the Pillars to give the words.231"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The Sign of the Enterer-THE INSTRUCTION OF THE CANDIDATEThe symbolism and meaning of the Step, Signs, Grip, or Token, and the Words have athree-fold interpretation:1.Apparent meaning.2.Spiritual or mystical reference.3.Practical application.Each is therefore considered under three headings.First, the foot is advanced about 6 inches. This represents the foot, on the side of Chesed,-being put forward and taking a hesitating step in darkness. The left foot is used to represent thepower of Isis, or the beginning of action, rather than Nephthys as the end thereof. The distance of\"6 inches\" is employed here only to render it more intelligible to English initiates. It means a-convenient measure of 6, and preferably 6 times the measure of the Phalanx of the thumb - the spiritand will.Second, it symbolizes the beginning of the stamping down of the Evil Persona. The foot isadvanced 6 metrical distances, answering to the number 6 of Tiphareth - Osiris, alluding thereforeto the self-sacrificing necessary to accomplish this.Third, it represents the practical application of the beginning of a magical force. Let theAdept, in using the Sign of the Enterer, give the step, as he commences the Sign, and let him takethat step as if he stamped upon the Earth, and the Earth quaked and rocked beneath him. As it issaid, \"Clouds of Darkness are round about Him - lightnings and thunders the Habitation of Hisfeet.\" Its secret name is \"The Step of the Avenger.\"SALUTING SIGN1.That of groping forward in search of truth.2.It represents the involution, and bringing forward of the light, into the material, to aidthe will of the Candidate in his search for and aspiration towards the Higher.3.Standing as before described, in the form of the God, and elevating the mind to thecontemplation of Kether, take the step like a stroke with the foot, bring the arms up above232"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"the head as if touching the Kether, and as the step is completed bring the hands over thehead forward. Thrust them out directly and horizontally from the level of the eyes - armsextended, fingers straight, palms downwards, the hands directed towards the object it iswished to charge or to effect. At the same time, sink the head, till the eyes look exactlybetween the thumbs. In this way, the rays from the eyes, from each finger, and from thethumb and eyes, must all converge upon the object attacked. If any of them disperse, it is aweakness.Thus performed, this Sign is a symbol of tremendous attacking force and of projectionof will power, and it should be employed in all cases where force of attack isrequired - especially of charging talismans and the like. Generally, it is best to have thethumbs and all the fingers extended - but if a particular effect is desired, you may extendonly the fingers appropriate thereto, keeping the rest folded back in the hand. Herewith alsomay be combined the attribution of the planets to head; (Mars to the right nostril, Mercuryto the mouth, etc. As explained in the Microcosm lecture), sending at the same time animaginary ray of color of the planet desired from the part of the head attributed to it. But,when finished, be careful to withdraw the rays again or they will remain like so many outletsof astral force and thus exhaust you. The best way to protect yourself against this is to givethe Sign of Silence immediately. For the first Sign should always be answered by thesecond. The secret names of the Saluting Sign are \"the Attacking Sign\" or \"the Sign of theEnterer of the Threshold.\"THE SIGN OF SILENCE1.This is simply that of secrecy regarding the Mysteries.2.It is the affirmation of the station of Harpocrates, wherein the Higher Soul of theCandidate is formulated in part of the admission ceremony. It is the symbol of the centerand of the \"Voice of the Silence,\" which answers in secret the thought of the heart3.The Sign of Silence withdraws the force put out by the Sign of the Enterer. \"Take uponthyself as before\" taught the colossal figure of the God, Harpocartes. Bring the left footsharply back, both heels together. Beat the ground once with the left foot as it is placedbeside the right. Bring the left hand to the mouth, and touch the center of the lower lip withthe left forefinger. Close the other fingers and thumb, drop the right hand to the side.Imagine a watery vapor encircles you. This is the reflux of the current.This Sign is also used as protection against attack. The Sign represents a concentrationof astral light about the person. Having given the Sign as above, it is a protection a ainst allattack and danger of obsession. To make it stronger, the form of the God should be taken.If spiritual force is required, formulate as if standing on a lotus or rising from it. For forcein contemplation and mediation, formulate as if seated upon a lotus. But for more materialforce, imagine standing upon a dragon or a serpent like some statues of Harpocrates. As adefense and protection, the Sign is as strong as the Banishing Pentagram, though different innature. And as the Sign of the Enterer represents attack, so does this Sign representdefense thereto, as a Shield is a defense against the Sword. From this Sign is a formula ofinvisibility derived.There is a story told by Dr. Berridge, who was a prominent member of the Golden Dawn:A few years ago I noticed that invariably after a prolonged interviewwith a certain person I felt exhausted. At first I thought it only the naturalresult of a long conversation with a prosy, fidgety old gentleman, but later itdawned upon me that being a man of exhausted nervous vitality, he was233"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"really preying upon me. I don't suppose that he was at all externallyconscious that he possessed a vampire organism, for he was a benevolent,kind-hearted old man who would have shrunk in horror from such asuggestion. Nevertheless, he was, in his inner personality, an intentionalvampire, for he acknowledged that he was to marry a young wife in order, ifpossible, to recuperate his exhausted system. The next time, therefore, thathe was announced, I closed myself to him before he was admitted. Iimagined that I had formed round myself a complete investure of odic fluid,surrounding me on all sides but not touching me, and impenetrable to anyhostile currents. This magical process was immediately and permanentlysuccessful - I never had to repeat it.The 'odic fluid,' which Dr. Berridge mentions, is the same as \"an encircling andenclosing watery vapor.\" This may be done effectively in the astral as well as physically.The Secret Names of this Sign are: \"The Sign of the God of Silence\" or the \"Sign ofDefense or Protection.\" It may be performed with any finger of either hand, but it is mostprotective when the left forefinger is used, the Water of Chesed, for the fingers of the righthand represent more violent action, and those of the left more watery action. With regard totaking on mentally the forms of the Gods, it may be here noted that the process is of greatassistance, and use in all magical workings, whether of invocation or evocation,contemplation, meditation, slaying in the spirit vision, alchemy, and so on. For the forms ofthe Gods do here represent a certain symbolic material action of the divine forces.The Sign of the Silence is done after the Sign of the Enterer, because it stops the forceone had activated with the initial Sign. The reason that three Signs are done is to build upmore power, but they are always stopped when the Sign of Silence is given.During the circumambulation, when the Sign of the Enterer is given, it is to a certainextent a blind force, for here the energy is expended out only to fortify the outward spiral,(under the old regime it was the circle, going outside the Pillars the same principle wasapplied) and the energy expended here it is emanating through the aura, as the individualgoes around the Altar, but is not given a boost or directed until one arrives at the Throne ofthe Hierophant. The Sign of Harpocrates, given straight after it, seals this force back intoyour aura so no leakages can occur. This is done a number of different ways, though theInvisible Station of Harpocrates is its power source. For this is where the firstcircumambulation is done, nearest the Altar, and expands out with every turn.In our own training, in the Sign of Silence and its uses, Taylor gave us an example of anindividual who did the Sign of the Enterer, and during the circumambulation, had energyleaking out of him like a sieve (which Taylor observed through his remarkable clairvoyantability). This was only rectified when the Sign of Silence was done. Taylor later found thatthe individual had suffered a personal loss that same day, but had decided to do theceremony to gain strength from it.It should be pointed out here that the Temple members observing the ceremony, but nottaking part in it, could join in the circumambulation of the Temple Officers. The Sign ofSilence is done in the Astral Form of Harpocrates from its original position. The power ofthis Godform draws out towards the East, pulled there by the kavanah, or 'intent,' of thefirst circumambulation. The other times it is done, this Godform expands and pushes alongthe spiral of the circumambulation. The energy from this is from the Altar, for this is wherethe power comes from (within the circumambulation that is). The Throne and Dais of theHierophant and other seated Officers is limited here. Their power has already charged theTemple and activated the Altar. The whole concept is an example of the current of Hornsworking with that of Osiris.234"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"THE GRIP1.The steps are taken and the Grip exchanged simultaneously. Together, this meansseeking guidance in the darkness and silence of the Mysteries.2.It shows that a steady and resolute will, acting in union with good, will accomplish whatit desires, no matter how often it fails at first. It indicates the necessity for harmony andbrotherly love - of doing away with pettiness and too much self concentration - forallowances for the weaknesses of others within limits - of shunning resolutely anything inthe nature of slander. So that in the grip of the Neophyte, the Initiates meet hand to handand foot to foot, in the true greeting of brother and sister, and not in the veiled hostility ofan enemy. For, in the working of the Inner, where all invoke the same forces, in the samemanner, if he becomes unsympathetic with the rest, and so separates himself/herself fromthem, though he weakens the combination of working, he still more certainly attracts uponhimself/herself a reflex current from the Avengers of Evil.The name of Silence, which is the Grand Word of this Grade, also represents theSilence of the Sacred Mysteries to be observed towards the Outer Order. It shows also thenecessity for respect towards the secrets of any Frater or Soror committed to your care, notendeavoring to search them out for the purpose of curiosity, not repeating them whendiscovered, nor in any way referring to them as a means of causing humiliation, but to keepthem as sacred trust and not to deflect them from acting justly and harmoniously together.3.In any magical ceremony, or other working, if more than one member be taking part, allpresent putting themselves into the form of the God as taught, should exchange Sign, Grip,and Words to establish a current of harmony and the affirmation of a mutual direction ofwill towards.the same objectTHE PASSWORD1.The password merely guards the Secrets of the Order against any member's resigned ornot working; hence it is changed each Equinox.2.It is an affirmation of the different spiritual, as well as the different physical,constitutions of the Candidates - that all nature cannot be the same without evil and injuryresulting thereby - but all natures should be brought to its own Kether - the best of its kind.This too, may be done in all things. It is the basis of Alchemy.3.It should be pronounced as if attracting the solar force, the Light of Nature, during the6 months following the Equinox, at which it is issued, as a link with the solar force, betweenthat and the Order. This password, therefore, may also be used in a magical ceremony asattracting the support of the Light of Nature acting upon natural forces.After giving the words and signs, the Hiereus draws the Candidate forward, betweenthe Pillars, and for the second time in the Ceremony, the Higher Soul stands near and readyto touch him. The Hiereus returns to his place East of the Black Pillar so that the threechief Officers may formulate and draw down to the Candidate, by their insignia, and otherinfluence of their symbols, the forces of the Supernal Triad. It is important, therefore, thatat this point, they should be in these places.The Candidate now stands between the Pillars, bound with a rope like the mummifiedform of Osiris, between Isis and Nephthys. The final consecration now takes place by theGoddess of the Scales of Balance The Candidatemow stands, for the first time during theceremony, at the point representing 'the equilibrium of balance. Meanwhile, the Kerux goes235"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"to the North, ready for the circumambulation, so as to link that with the final consecrationof the Candidate.The final consecration is also demanded by the Hiereus - Horns the powerful Avengerof Osiris, as still menacing the Evil Persona of the Candidate. Its effect is to seal finally, inbalanced formation, the four Pillars in the Sphere of Sensation of the Candidate. This doesnot imply that they were not naturally there before. But in the natural human, the symbolsare unbalanced in strength - some being weaker and some stronger. The effect of theceremony is to strengthen the weak, purify the strong, and so begin to equilibrate them, andat the same time make a link between them, and the corresponding forces of theMacrocosm.THE EFFECT OF THE CEREMONY ON TILE SPHERE OF SENSATIONPreviously we have briefly touched upon the subject, when dealing with the removal ofthe implements from the Altar, and the Admission of the Candidate. The four Pillars, thusreferred to, must at this point be distinguished from the Middle Pillar of theCandidate - which relates to the subtle body centers in the front of the body (which for thepurposes of a simple explanation could be described as groups of minor chakras which havebeen grouped Kaballistically) not to be confused with the major chakras which are along thespine. The four Pillars represent the Aura of the Candidate. Taylor always taught us thatthis is what is most effected (the exception being the throat chakra which is touched directlyby the Sword of the Fliereus, at the back of the neck, during the Obligation).The Golden Dawn, according to Taylor, in its 'word of mouth' teachings; consideredthat the body had 7 basic auras and each grade stimulated each aura. The Neophyte effectsmainly the physical aura which is also called the etheric double. It also must be'rememberedthough, that various parts of the soul are also effected as well, which are considered distinctfrom the auras.The Hierophant then commands the removal of the rope which hitherto has beenpurposely retained. Symbolically, the rope restrains the actions of the natural human, whosetemptations are toward the Evil Persona.The four Pillars, being thus firmly established, the Candidate is invested with the badgeof the White Triangle of the Three Supemals formulating in Darkness. The Higher Self isenabled, in reality to also consent. The free will of the natural human is never obsessed,either by the Higher Soul or by the ceremony, but, the will consenting, the whole of theceremony is directed toward strengthening its actions. As the badge is placed upon him, itis as if the two Great Goddesses, Isis and Nephthys, stretch forth their wings over Osiris torestore him to life again.The badge referred to is not a physical badge but a symbolically places symbol in theaura of the Candidate, on his forehead.THE FINAL CIRCUMAMBULATION IN THE PATH OF LIGHTThe Mystic Circumambulation follows in the Path of Light to represent the rising light in theCandidate, through the operation of self-sacrifice. As he passes the Hierophant's throne, the redCalvary Cross is astrally formed above the astral white triangle on his forehead, so that so long ashe belongs to the Order, he may bear the potent and sublime symbol as a link with his Higher Self,and as an aid in searching out the forces of the Divine Light - if he will.THE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLEMENTS TO IHE ALTARThe manner of replacing these is the opposite to the figures above showing how they were236"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"taken off the Altar. This represents the component parts of the Candidate which have now beenpurified, and his Sphere of Sensation which has now been equilibrated.111.H., ADDRESS TO 1.11.N., CANDIDATEThe Higher Soul or Genius now returns to the invisible station of Harpocrates, the place ofthe Hidden Center, while continuing to retain the link formed with the Candidate. The Address ofthe Hierophant is intended simply to effect the distinct formulation of the symbols of the 0 = 0Grade of Neophyte in the Candidate, and it is therefore only when this is finished that the WatcherAnubis announces that the Candidate has been duly admitted as the initiated Neophyte.The Hiereus is charged with a warning address, as again confirming the will of the Candidate,and addressing the final menace to the Evil Persona. The Hierophant states clearly that the symbolsmust be equilibrated in the Sphere of Sensation before a link can be formulated between them andthe forces of the macrocosm. The necessity of examination is insisted upon so that this may becompletely done.MIXING OF THE FLUIDSThe Kerux pours out the two fluids to make the semblance of blood. This is to fix, in theCandidate's sphere, the symbols of the forces of transmutation in nature, and also to make an astrallink between these, and the Candidate's physical life, as a guard of secrecy of the Mysteries. Thisparticular form of transmutation is used, as showing the effect of a mixture of forcing, as producinga third appearance totally different from them. The red color is symbolic of the blood of theCandidate.In the ancient Mysteries, the Candidate's blood was actually drawn, at this time, andpreserved as an avenging link in case of his proving unworthy (consider the modern theory ofRadionics and its effect on a blood sample). Transmutation effects matter quite well, seeing thatthe astral link is formally established.The final speech of the Hierophant is further intended, beside its apparent meaning, to affirmthat a person only partially initiated is neither fitted to teach nor to instruct even the outer and moreignorant Sublime Knowledge. He is certain, through misunderstanding the principles, to formulateerror instead of truth.SYMBOLISM OF THE CLOSINGWith the knock of the Hierophant, the generating current he created, to keep the Lightthrough the Portal, starts to close. The Cry of, \"Hekas, Hekas, Este Bebeloi\" announces to allforces present, in the Portal, to leave. The four knocks of the Officers then withdraw the Light,which then withdraws through the Hierophant - the second stage of the withdraw.At this point, the Kerux must be ever watchful for any elemental force, created during theceremony, which might linger. There have been a number of instances in the past where there hasbeen this type of residue left, which if noticed should be immediately banished by the Hiereus withthe Sword. The purification ceremony makes doubly sure that no negative side effects remainwithin the Hall.REVERSE CIRCUMAMBULATIONThe reverse circumambulation is intended to formulate the withdraw of the Light of theSupernal Triad from the Altar, so that it may not be profaned by abiding without due guard. Notthat the Divine Light would suffer thereby, but because it might initiate an Avenging Current of237"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"profaned. This is what is implied by the Law of Moses, in the prohibition about offeringunconsecrated Fire, either before or within the Veil of the Tabernacle. As a Vibratory formula, thereverse circumambulation represents the reversal of the current, and the restoration of the operatorto the ordinary condition. The Mystic reverse circumambulation forms its procession in the South,beginning from the Station of Dadouchos, as symbolic of the Ending Judgment of the World byFire.PARTAKING OF THE EUCHARISTThe Mystic repast is communion in the body of Osiris. Its Mystic Name is, \"The Formula ofthe Justified One.\" The important point to remember is, that through the process of the ceremony,both the Paten and the Wine and Salt, were magically transmuted, through the magnetic influenceof the ritual itself. This is done through the Osirian concept which is directed by the Hierophant.The Kerux, in finishing, inverts the Cup, as the Watcher of the God, to show that the symbols ofself-sacrifice and of regeneration are accomplished. The proclamation is confirmed by theHierophant, and the chief Officers giving three strokes, emblematic of the Mystic Triad, repeat theMystic Words. The Ilierophant, in his final speech, seals the link, first formulated between themembers of the Supernal Triad, for each one present, that it may prove to him or her, a guide forthe ultimate attainment of the supreme initiation - if he will.238"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Zelator RitualINTRODUCTIONVery little, if anything, has been done on the Elemental Ceremonies, hi the past, because their functionhas been, for the most part, an obscure one. Most Golden Dawn students seem to consider that exposure toElemental Tablets is the main pinnacle of these ceremonies, and some have even substituted the 'Opening ofthe Watch Tower Ritual' as a substitute for these grades.The operative word, throughout both the Outer and Inner Order of the Golden Dawn, was 'fusion,'where all main systems were brought together for a combined usage. While it is true that the ElementalTablets or Watchtowers, as they are sometimes called, are the pinnacle, that hangs various subsystemstogether, it is also equally true that these tablets are an impetus, or force, behind the system, and were neverenvisaged for direct usage within the Outer Order. To truly understand the function of the Elemental Grades,you must go through them.This chapter is an analysis of the 1 = 10 ritual, from the New Zealand Whare Ra Temple, which hasincluded many of the 'word of mouth' teachings of both the Golden Dawn and, later, the Stella Matutina.One thing comes through, with this ritual. Although the changes are made for changes sake, the entirestructure is still based on the Mathers cipher arrangement. A careful study of this ceremony shows clearly thatit generates just as much power as the original Golden Dawn 1 = 10 ritual did. Waite was highly respected, bymembers of the Golden Dawn, and his knowledge was second only to Westcott and Mathers (according toFelkin who was by his own admission jealous of him). His books, on Paracelsus and the Kabbalah, (Qabalah)show an understanding of both Alchemy, and the Kabbalah, that very few in the Golden Dawn possessed.We cannot over emphasize the importance of participating in, or going through, the Elemental Gradeceremonies. The 1 = 10 Ceremony is something of an enigma, for it differs a great deal from the other threeElemental rituals, in the sense of magical direction. Its main concern is strengthening both the physical andastral body of the Zelator. It is not associated to any planet except the one we live on. It fuses together anumber of very important magical techniques, such as auric alchemy, the magical use of the Biblical Psalms,plus the magical use of the Sepher Yetzirah (through the diagrams on the Altar and the walls, it draws from theenergy of the ancient Temple of Solomon). This creates an empathy with the Earth Tablets.The Candidate is introduced to various Godforms, on the Tree of Life, and these he will later utilize andcommand in the Higher levels. These include slaying the Enochian Pyramids, Enochian Chess, Talismanicwork, and other aspects of the Z.2 formula, that the Adept must utilize in the Inner Order. All of this isabsorbed at a base level by the Zelator, either directly or indirectly, but absorbed nevertheless, and resurrectedat a later level of the Order's work. It formulates a base, on which to work, when one begins to work, directly,with the planetary energies.In a recent publication of the Golden Dawn rituals, The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic, anumber of diagrams missing from the rituals, along with associated commentaries, for each of the Grades, eventhough these rituals were Golden Dawn originals. To remedy this, we have written this book, on both theritual and commentaries of the Golden Dawn, from the Neophyte to the Adeptus Exemptus papers.It has long been the assumption that the rituals of the Stella Matutina were watered down versions ofthose of the Golden Dawn. This was mainly due to the papers of the English Temples being altered, thoughthose in the New Zealand Order were, for the most part, identical to the Golden Dawn Temples, and, hi someinstances, have additional information on them. The various diagrams, presented to the Candidate as he or shegoes through the Elemental Rituals, have a very specific purpose.When Whare Ra Temple was first established, a number of classes were held by Felldn. These went intospecific detail, on the related histories, based on what the diagrams show on each grade represented We weretold that this was the way ofteaching in the Isis-Urania Temple, during the heyday of the Order, prior to 1900.So, instead of just seeing a diagram on the wall during the ritual, the student was taken through an entiresequence of related history, at a later stage, by their respective teachers.239"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"This practice, however, fell in abeyance in most temples, after 1900, and the diagrams represented asmall piece of information that was once an elaborate method of study. Going by the later unpublished lecturesof Mather% it appears that he intended to include some of the diagrams in the 1 = 10 grade, of his Enochianlectures, for the Practicus Adeptus Minor Grade.Both Crowley (in his Equinox), and Regardie The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic), didnot think much of the Elemental rituals, and in this we have different opinions on the subject mainly due to thefact that the person who put us through the grades, Jack Taylor, was an esoteric genius, who had a magicalpower and perception I have not perceived hi any other person, and knew what he was doing. Crowley told-Regardie how unimpressed he was with the Elemental Grades, while Regardie came to the same conclusion,though both had little regard for their respective Herophants during these rituals.Taylor, on the other hand, could cradle your aura and introduce you to energies on one level at a time.-When he showed a diagram, during ritual, he would open up even more currents of energy, so that one couldexperience a small manifestation of what it represented. Very few people could do this - virtually none in theGolden Dawn or the Stella Matutina, or if there were any who had this ability, you could probably count their-numbers on the fingers of one hand.Regardie, at dinner one night with an American Temple Chief visiting in New Zealand, argued that onone hand the Elemental Grades were unnecessary, yet on another hand, they were effective in opening up the-aura, and inflating the ego, though to understand his viewpoint, one would have had to know FrancisRegardie. Taylor, on the other hand, had such abilities that many held him in awe and others feared him. Hehad reached the point where, when talking about the effectiveness of the Earth Grade, would pull theseenergies out of his own aura, and show what he was talking about by the 'show me, don't tell me' principle.One of the let-downs, within the Order, was the fact that those who acted as Herophant did not havethe same ability at ritual as those hie Taylor, Matters, Felkin, and Waite. Although by following the teachings,many unfortunately could not muster the important internal combination, that every Hierophant shouldpossess, and as a result their ritual initiations were far short of what they should have been. Mathers realizedthis, and while he knew he could show them the way, he could not give them the internal impetus to go with it.It's a pity that Crowley and Regardie did not have adequate Ifierophants, for if they had, I am sure they wouldhave felt the nue power of the Elemental Ceremonies.Taylor felt that a 5 = 6 grade was not sufficient enough to be a Herophant, even though the Adept mustundergo training under the Past Heropliant. This was originally done, in some temples, but this practice fellinto abeyance. The only remaining training was a mechanical approach to ritual which was nothing more thanan empty shelL Training a Herophant takes many years.We have often thought that temples, who are large enough, should have classes to train prospectiveHerophants. The students should be graded on knowledge and ability. Anyone who failed to pass should notbe allowed to hold the Herophant's position.When people, both within and without of the Order, start talking about the short cuts, like skipping theElemental Grades, we are reminded of the story on the formation of the Golem of Prague. Rabbi Yehuda benBezalel (Maharal) could have saved himself a lot of trouble, without using the elements, to bring life to theGolem - or could he?One of the recent buzzwords, used by. Golden Dawn aspirants, and unfortunately some Chiefs, is`Conceptionalize' which should read, `cop-out.' This form of talk is generally undertaken by those armchairmagicians who talk instead of doing. Some of them would have us change the Golden Dawn system intositting back and visualizing the whole procedure of ritual. These people are either too lazy, or do not have theability, to perform Golden Dawn ritual. They think that Will alone will suffice, which it will not. The primeingredient of ritual is to get out there and do it, not just sit back and theorize about it.240"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Zelator 1=10Sign of Earth Grade"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"1 = 10The Zelator Grade of the Golden Dawn relates to the element of Earth and the Kabbalistic Sephirah ofMalkuth. It is the second of the Golden Dawn initiations. The state produced by the 0=0 Ritual has beendescribed by some occult authors as being similar to an alchemical dissolution state. The effect of this firstCeremony is vital to the state of the ensuing Elemental Grades; this includes the 1-10 Grade, as it lays theground for further atnic manipulations the candidate must go through.The Zelator Grade is more than just an introduction to the ray or power of the Element of Earth It is a-means by which many things, analogous to Earth in nature, are introduced to the advancing Neophyte. This isdone on a level that the candidate would not have previously recognized, before the initiation, due to thesubjective influence of the Order itself The candidate undergoes changes, or transmutations, within his-psychological makeup, after exposure to the auric manipulations of the ritual. This can manifest during, orafter, the initiatory process.In layman's terms, the Earth Grade of Zelator is said to 'ground' the student's aura by giving him a-sense of proportion. This will manifest itself on both the etheric levels of the body, and on a day to day basis.The Zelator Grade is the first of the four main filtration processes of the Outer Order of the GoldenDawn. This ceremony is supposed to try and make the student, who seeks to join the Order, as a means ofescape from reality, face up to his or her obligations in the Outer World rather than retreat from them. Beforeany firm development can be undertaken, this must be faced head on, or otherwise, it will manifest repeatedlywhile the student goes onto the next levels. If the Zelator Ritual has been performed correctly, then many ofthose who attain this level as a form of escapism, drop out due to the influence of this ceremony. Also,sometimes the influence of it will over-spill into the other grade levels - if the student has had insufficient timefor this process to manifest itself.For those people who are earthly by nature, this ceremony will reinforce their strengths withouthindering their progress into the next level. There are some who have an earthly nature and a narrow outlookThis grade is designed to widen their field of vision and to show them the practical aspects of their natures. Itis done without undue constriction of their intellectual pursuits, by emulating themselves to the ideals set bythe Order's framework.The Zelator Grade is also directly related to the Guph or physical body of the aspirant For when thecandidate goes through the ritual, the etheric energies impregnate the aura. This is done to prepare the body(by strengthening it) for the trials and tabulations it will undergo as the pressure of the Order's teachings and-magnetic manipulations start to bear their toll. By this, we do not mean that the ritual will cause ill healthRather, like homeopathy and natural health systems of healing, it may cause dormant illnesses to come to thesurface. One of the bodily systems, that this level seems to work best on, is the alimentary system whosefunction is to expel waste products and poisons from the body. Any dormant illness, revealed by the ritual,should be confronted, and hopefully healed, before further advancement through the Grades.In the Golden Dawn paper, Mcrocosm-Man, a -very technical description of the actions of theKabbalistic Soul, as applied to the lowest Sephiroth, Malkuth, is given. This is worth repeating because itshows in detail some ofthe candidate will experience:\"From Malkuth is formed the whole of the physical body under the command andpresidency of the Nephesch. The Nephesch is the subtle body of refined astral Tight uponwhich, as on an invisible pattern, the physical body is extended. The physical body ispermeated throughout by the rays of the Ruach, of which it is the material completion., TheNephesch shineth through the Material body and formeth the Magical Mirror or Sphere ofSensation is an imitation or copy of the Sphere of the Universe. The space between thephysical body and the boundary of the sphere of sensation is occupied by the ether of theastral world; that is to say, the container or recipient of the Astral rays ofthe Microcosm\"The Nephesch is divided into its seven Palaces, combining the Sephirotic influences in their most241"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"material forms. That is, the world of passions dominated by the Ruach, or by the world which is beyond. Thatis, its Sephiroth are passionate, expressing a passionate dominion. Thus, its three Supernal Sephiroth, Kether,Chockmah, and Binah, are united in a sense of feeling and comprehending impressions. Its Chesed isexpressed by laxity of action. Its Geburah by violence of action.Its Tiphareth is expressed by more or less sensual contemplation of beauty, and love of vital sensation.Its Hod and Netzach, by physical well being and health. Its Yesod by physical desires and gratifications. ItsMalkuth, by absolute increase and domination of matter in the material body.The Nephesch is real, the actual body, ofwhich the material body is only the result through the action ofthe Ruach, which by the aid of the Nephesch, formeth the material body by the rays of Ruach, which do notordinarily proceed beyond the limits of the physical body. That is to say, in the ordinary man the rays of Ruachrarely penetrate into the Sphere of Sensation.\"Shining through infinite worlds, and darting its rays through the confines of space, in this Sphere ofSensation is a faculty placed as a light is placed within a lantern. This is a certain sense placed in an aperture ofthe upper part of the Ruach wherein act the rays from Chokmah and Binah which govern the reason - Daath.This faculty can be thrown downwards into the Ruach, thence can radiate into the Nephesch. It consists ofseven manifestations answering to the Hexagram, and is like the Soul of the Nficroprosopus or the Elohim ofthe human Tetragrammaton. Therefore in the head, which is its natural and chief seat, are formed the sevenapertures of the head. This is the Spiritual Consciousness as distinct from the human consciousness. It ismanifested in 7 as just said or in 8 if Daath be included. The father is the Sun (Chokmah). The Mother is theMoon (Binah). The Wind beareth it in its bosom, (Ruach). Its Nurse is the Earth, (Nephesch). The power ismanifested when it can be vibrated through the Earth.\"PREPARATION OF THE CANDIDATE1.Obtain an astrological, natal chart of the birth time, or approximate birth time of the candidate.2.Prepare an electional chart and many with the natal chart to decide an appropriate date and time forthe ritual.3.Once the time has been established, (which is never on the dark side of the Moon's influence) thecandidate is to fast 12 hours, taking nothing except water.4.Before the ceremony, the candidate should bathe in herbs of the Composite family (which are toonumerous to list).5.For meditation purposes, the candidate is given a small handful of rock salt crystals, some 30 minutesbefore the ceremony. The candidate is to extend his aura to link with the nature of the salt. Thecandidate is then given a yellow square, on a card. He should meditate on the card for about 15minutes before the start of the ceremony.PREPARATION OF THE HALL1.The temple props are put into place, by the Dadouchos, about two hours before the ceremony.2.The Ilerophant enters the Hall, once the Dadouchos has left, and performs the Banishing Ritual of thePentagram with the Sword of the lEereus (which should be in its comet station).3.The Hierophant creates the Godfornts of the Visible Stations and, the Invisible Stations. He also242"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"invokes the power of Earth through the Egyptian invocation.4.Once the above is complete, the Chiefs on the Dias should enter the temple and create their respectivegodforms. Ifthey cannot be present, then it is the Ffierophant's duty to create these godforms.5.The remaining officers should enter the hall (on a cue from the Hierophant).6.The Candle Lighting Ceremony begins when all officers are present7.When the candles and lamps are lit in the temple, the officers should assume their respective godfomis,previously created by the Hierophant.SYMBOLISM OF THE TEMPLEThe Temple, as arranged in the first part of the 1 = 10 Grade of Zelator, shows the Tree of Lift, inMalkuth, a complete Tree of Assiah. The Three paths of Shin, Tau, and Qoph, as illustrated by Hebrew lettersabove the Dias, show the connection to Malkuth from the Greater Tree. Kether is shown, for the first time inthe Outer Order rituals, and relates to Kether of Assiah, the Higher Self This is seen by the candidate, in hislimited comprehension. Kether must be attained and linked to the physical body at the eastern part of theAltar, and under the guardianship of Sandalphon. The Stations relating to the Tree are as follows:Officers on the DiasStation of the TreeGodformCancellariusAin Soph AurThothPraemonstratorAin SophIsisImperatorAinNepthysHierophantKetherOsiris(Note 1: It has been the assumption that these officers do not appear in the Elemental rituals while infact they can. In the old Golden Dawn, the placing of these officers was optional. In the Stella Matutina, theseofficers, on the Dais, were generally included or their placed taken by the Wardens of the Temple. If they arenot present, the Hierophant has to take the responsibility of performing all their functions. This is almostimpossible, as the Stella Matutina found out in later years. Though their positions were generally not marked,on the 1 = 10 Diagram for the rituals, it was always accepted that they would be present. It is in areas like thisthat the experience of members of the Stella Matutina, in working the rituals, discovered the weak areas ofearly Golden Dawn ritual, and compensated for them. You will note that on the floor is a complete Tree ofLife while on the Dias we have a duplication of the Supemals. The Chiefs or Wardens on the Dias reflect thepower of the Tree on the floor. If one uses just the ifierophant, then he will do a similar work, but it will bedirectly through Kether.The Elemental King is also the main coordinator for the tablet. He directs what forces go where.During the ceremony, through the temple officers, the Elemental King enters the etheric aura of the candidate,through the chakra centers. His energies are linked to the diversification factor. He raises the vibrational pitchof the candidate's aura so that it corresponds to that Elemental Plane related to the Earth Element.The three sets of knocks relate to the number of the Sephirah of Malkuth, for here the Sephirah is theninvoked where previously the Earth Element was invoked. This is a good example of the multifacetedprinciple of Golden Dawn ritual.The Three Hebrew letters that hang above the Dias represent the untrodden paths to the candidate.They make up the word, Quesheth, a Bow. This is said to reflect the rainbow symbol over the dias. The243"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"rainbow symbolism of these letters is, by analogy, a bridge between man's higher and lower natures. Theseletters, being placed above the Chiefs, signify the power of the Second Order, manifesting in the First, or OuterOrder, as it is sometimes called. This represents Higher Knowledge given to those who seek it.The Altar symbolism shows a cross within a triangle, which shows spirit in matter (a reflection of thetopic, as discussed in the previous paragraph) - a symbol also for mankind. This is also a symbol of bothrejection and knowledge attained. The inference of this symbol is that knowledge can be attained - if the causeof a person's ignorance can be discovered through the teachings of the Order. The symbolism on the Altar isthe same as that on the Banner of the West which is explained in the Zelator Grade:\"The White triangle refers to the three Paths connecting Malkuth with the otherSephiroth; while the red cross is the Hidden Knowledge of the Divine name which is to beobtained through their aid. The Cross and Triangle together represent Life and Light\"Within the Golden Dawn Cipher Manuscript, the red cross is also referred to as the Cross of theKerubim. This is because of their placings in the Cardinal Points which resemble a cross. The red crossbecomes a cross in the Microcosm, because of this fact. The red lamp, situated on the Altar, shows the hiddenknowledge. Its position, at the apex of the white triangle, shows that this must be attained before the red crosscan enter the Triangle of Spirit, and becomes the symbolic goal ofthe candidate.The symbolism of the Flaming Sword, placed on the western side of the Altar, relates to the paths ofboth ascent and descent. Descent of the divine knowledge into mankind, as the candidate, and mankind'saspirations to climb the 'Path of Higher Learning' through Kavanah - devotion. The Black and White Pillarsrepresent the Stations of Chased and Geburah. Placed in the position, below the Altar, they create the voidbetween light and darkness called, 'the Immeasurable Region,' which the Higher Self of the candidate mustadvance through The Unveiled Enochian Tablet, in the North, represents the forces of the Earth Element andthe hierarchies that the candidate must be exposed to during the ritual These forces are the ones that controlthe Earth Element. The salt, on the side of the Altar, directly in front of the Tablet, shows the tangilile formthat the Tablet represents. The Earth Tablet is the only one of the four present that is unveiled. These arecovered with a cloth that has the color of their respective elements. The lamp, in front of the Earth Tablet,relates to the 'Ever Burning Lamps' of the Rosicrucian Mysteries, which suggests that once alight, the lampswere never extinguished until an intruder entered the tomb where they were usually still burning. In thisceremony, it relates to the ever present offering to the Earth Element. The following Egyptian invocation wasgiven to me by Taylor to say before the Earth Tablet before the start of the ritual:\"Souls of Tuat, that he that knoweth their name shall be with them. This Great God willgive him fields, the situation of which shall be in the country of Ur-Ness. He shall stand upwith the Gods who stand up, and he shall follow after this Great God. He shall trample theeater of the Ass, and after the division of the Unoccupied Land has been made, he shall eatbread in the Boat of the Earth_\"The Banners of the East and West are both placed on the Dias. This time, instead of guarding againstthe Qlippoth, the Banner of the West prevents the energies of the Paths from entering into the ceremony.294"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"SYMBOLISM OF THE OPENINGThe Hiereus knocks to ask permission of the Herophant to advance the candidate to the Elemental Grades.This knock is done with the base ofthe Sword, on the edge of the chair, and becomes a bridge for the first linkwith the Altar. (Note: The Iliereus, and not the Herophant, knocks here as a form of petition for theHerophant to open up the portal to the elemental grades. This is allied to the Nereus, acting on behalf of thecandidate, to ask permission for the elemental grades to be opened up to the seeker of the light. It is veryimportant that the Hiereus does this. Taylor put it to us this way: \"You do not open the door unless someoneseeks admission.\" The Office of Sentinal is not dropped after the Neophyte ceremony. The original GoldenDawn copies, and those from Whare Ra Temple, clearly state this officer is present. The Hiereus holds hisSword upright for the entire ceremony. It is only transfen-ed to his right hand vvhen standing in front of the-Tablet of Earth, with the edge of the Sword turned slightly outward. The cutting edge faces outward, so thatno negative influence can penetrate the area the Hiereus guards. The Signs of the Officers are given towardsthe East, not the Altar. The Hereus does not put down the Sword, but gives the Grade Sign with his free,-right hand. In paragraph four, the comment that the signs are given, without rising, is inconea. No sign isever done from a seated position.)With the Opening Speech of the Herophant, he sends forth the Ray of Light, through his Rauch, to theAltar, then to the station of Kerux, thus activating directly the Kerux's station and Sphere of Sensation. Afterthis, the Kerux sees that the entrance of the Temple is properly guarded. The Hereus, commanded by theHerophant, tests those present to insure that they are of 1-10 grade, or higher. This testing procedure is notreally for those officers working in the ceremony, but for those present in the hall, outside the portal watchingthe ceremony. All those within the hall have to replay to the signs at the order of the Nereus. When all thesesigns are done in unison, towards East, it activates the Spheres of Sensation/auras of the temple, officers withthe godfonns on the temple floor. (Note: When the officers link or submerge themselves in the godform ofthe station that they represent, during the Candle Lighting Ceremony, they only link to the lower levels of that-godform. The Herophant, during this first show of signs, completes this by linking the Supernal of the Sphereof Sensation, through the nemyss of the temple officers. After this, the only other link with the gocIforms is tothe element of Earth)The next phase of operation is the Consecration of the Temple with Water and Fre. Now at this point, thecommand of the Herophant specifically states that the Temple be consecrated with water first, and fire second,yet the reverse is then done. The Water and Fire Purification, used both in the Timer and Outer Order of theGolden Dawn, relate directly back to nature. Both the Christian and Hermetic viewpoint apply here equally:the dissolution of the body, after death, through water, with the rising of the Spirit, as fire. Now, in only tworituals of the Golden Dawn are the Water and Fire Consecrations reversed: the 1 = 10 Ceremony and the-Consecration of the Vault. We believe both are in error, a point Regardie agreed withThe firm rule of thumb, given to all those in the Inner Order, was that when consecrating an inanimateobject, use Water - then Fre. When consecrating a person, with Earth, the reverse occurs and this should bethe only exception. In the Golden Dawn Ciphers (see the SECRET INNER ORDER RITUALS OF THEGOLDEN DAWN) Fire and Water are given in consecrating the candidate. Mathers suggested that theConsecration of the Temple follow the same pattern_There is a good reason in the 1 = 10 for the candidate to be purified with Fire first. He has just completedthe 0=0 Grade. He is at a level where Fire and Salt (representing the Earth Element) are analogous to eachother, and that the next alchemical step is a dissolution to water again. Overall, the author(s) of the GoldenDawn Ciphers had a marvelous understanding of nature by injecting the reversal principle (Note 4: See Jung's,Mysterium Coniunctionis for a full explanation of the water/fire combination and discussion of associatedalchemical texts. The section on 'Personification of Opposites' and the subsections `Regeneration of SeaWater' and \"The Interpretation and Meaning of Salt' are of particular interest, as they present the Christian,Pagan, and Hermetic viewpoints). However, no matter which way it is viewed, the initial Consecration of the-Temple should be by Water then Fire, with the reverse occurring later in the ceremony for the candidate. Inthe New Zealand Order, we have amended our ritual papers so that the Stolistes purifies first. Also note, the245"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Purification by Water is done from the Pillars, in the order of the ascent of the Lightning Flash, which fits inwith the overall picture. This aspect is destroyed when fire is utilized as the first consecration.The actual consecration is done slightly above the Stations of the Pillars, ia, order to help clear a path to theRuach of the Ceremony. This helps clear the way for the Breath ofLi.fe to be'received, not only from the East,but from the North ofthe Temple as wellWith the speech of the Herophant, \"Let the Element of this grade be named that it may be awakened in theSpheres of those present and in the Sphere of the Order,\" all of the officerspresent activate the earthly part of their auras, charged in previous rituals by the Enochian Tablets. This isdone is through the visualization process of the yellow square that the candidate was asked to meditate onbefore the ceremony.Before this is done, the officers do the Adoration to Earth, which gives than their initial connecting linkThe Kabbalistic Cross unites both the Macrocosm and the Microcosm, of the Earth Element, which isnecessary before one links to the Tablets as they also have a dual link to EarthThe movement, by the Hierophant, when doing the cross with the Scepter, is directed slightly upward to theSign of Tau, hanging above the Dias. All those present have previously travelled this path during their owninitiations into the Earth Element. The following is from an unpublished Golden Dawn document by Mathersdated 1897:\"Let the Officers formulate the Yellow Cube of Earth around them and let their Sphere of Sensationfilleth with every expression of Earth so that their very being is enflamed with Salt of the Earth when theHerophant linketh with Tau through Cross and Circle...\"The Herophant then goes clockwise to the North and places himself in a position approximately 6 feet infront of the Earth Tablet with the following officers forming in behind him.What occurs here is almost acomplete pivot of the temple, with theKerux remaining at his original station tomaintain the Stream of light, directed bythe Hierophant earlier . This helps stabilizethe Altar for its fusion with the direct energyfrom the Earth Tablet. (Note: In the`Introduction to the Elemental Grades,' inthe Llewellyn paperback, GOLDENDAWN, it states that the officers form ahexagram in front of the Tablets. Since theKerux remains in his station, this is not quitethe case. The Altar retains the lowestportion of the Hexagram figure, and fromthis configuration, becomes the recipient ofthe energy about to be drawn from thetablets.) The speech by the Hierophant infront of the Tablet is a method where thepower ofthe Earth is made to be formulated like humans (even in the Macrocosm) so that it is subjected to thesame rules as all living creatures, whether spiritual or otherwise, and can be controlled by the Temple officers.(Note: GENESIS 1, VS. 26-27.) In other words, the Hierophant formulates an archetypal figure, of theArch-angel, Auriel, when invoking with Spirit. When one directly invokes, with the Earth Pentagram, this canbe reduced in size.(Note: Within the old Golden Dawn, and later the Stella Matutina, both Active and Passive Pentagrams weredrawn before the actual Invoking Elemental Pentagram. It is now considered common practice to do eitherthe Active or Passive Pentagram, relating tt the element conCerned, than the actual Elemental Invoking246"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Pentagram.)The Herophant takes the Sword of the Hiereus. He formulates the Sign of the Ox , which represents theKerub of Earth, who is also invoked, in turn. At this juncture, the outermost reaches of the element have nowbeen brought under control. An unpublished Golden Dawn paper by Mathers on the subject says:\"...Create the Blue Circle in the astral then project it through the Tablet to the very quarter where the GreatArch-angel Amid standeth The Pentagrams of Spirit and Earth shall blindeth him with their Brilliance whilethe force of the Sword will commanded' the Ox, the Great Kerub of Earth who standeth before Auriel though-he be somewhat smaller in stature...\"This is part of the technique taught in the training of the Herophant. The Hierophant's Scepter acts as a-type of long range blasting rod, used to open, close, and connect to the Sword. It is used for invocation andevocation. (Note: At this point, we would refer the reader to Part I of the 0=0 Ritual which described themisuse of the Herophants scepter as an invoking instrument during the Watch Tower Ceremony, and yet, itappears to be doing the same thing in the Elemental Ceremonies, although the 'Z. 1' warns against such action.This has caused a great deal of confusion.In this Elemental Ceremony, the Invoking Pentagram reacts through the tablets, and not at them, as this isits direction. The use of the Ox is one example where the Kerub, and not the Tablet, is invoked. In the WatchTower Ceremony; one only invokes the Tablet when the 3-Holy Names, applicable to the Tablet, are called aspart of the Invoking Pentagram. The Invoking Wand, during the Watchtower Ceremony, is not theHierophant's Scepter, but the Cross, Chain, Cup, and Dagger, which are analogous to the ElementalWeapons, and are Second Order Instruments. Part I of the Z5 explains further use of the Hierophant'sScepter. All fluffier actions in front of the Tablet are passive gestures, such as the cross, to establish anempathy with the ceremony only - not to take the full brunt of its power and inject them into the candidate.)Once the Hegemon's Wand is used to do the cross in front of the Tablet, it brings the energy of the Tablet-into life through the Earth Element. This is done through the Kerub of Earth, by the power of Adonai. Withthe Cup of Stolistes, a cross is drawn in the air in front of the Tablet. With the most passive weapon available,an empathy is created with the 3 Holy Names of EMOR -DIAL - HCTGA. The 3 Holy Names are the keys-to tapping the power of the Earth Tablet. (Note: The word of mouth teachings, from Whare Ra Temple,state that each of the 3 Holy Names represent an astrological house. During the ceremony, these Names affectthe second to fourth houses and directly effect the life of the candidate in the 3 areas, which are as follows:EMOR 2nd House. It affects the possessions of the candidate and is meant to guide and arm him with thenecessary values of this life. Taylor called this the 'grounding' or 'earthing' of the candidate which instills a-balance, helping him cope with day-to-day activities.DIAL: 3rd House. This affects the communicative ability of the candidate and helps him strengthen thebond between friends and family as well as helping him to far problems on this level of existence.HCTGA: 4th House. Here, the inherited tendencies of the candidate are being helped and directedtowards a common good.The fundamental philosophy behind this is, that as the candidate goes through the 4 Elemental Grades, he orshe goes through the 12 Astrological Houses. Each one of these is strengthened, in turn, thus helping thecandidate function on the level of mind, body, and spirit.)The Herophant performs a cross, with the Censer, and calls forth the name of the Elemental King, IC ZODHE CHAL. Under normal circumstances, these names would automatically be awakened by the calling of the3 Holy Names, but when called on directly, by the Herophant, they are done so for a specific purpose - todirect the power of the Tablet. In actions of consecrations and grading ceremonies, the Elemental King is thefirst ray that impregnates the aura of the respective object. The Herophant creates a vital Etheric Link, bymerging his aura with that of the Tablet, and then to the object in question, during pertinent parts of the247"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"merging his aura with that of the Tablet, and then to the object in question, during pertinent parts of theceremony. When this force is withdrawn, at the close of the ceremony, the vibration, in empathy, continuesapart from the Etheric Link. The Elemental King is also the main coordinator for the Tablet, anddirects which forces go where.During the ceremony, through the temple officers, the Elemental King enters the Etheric aura of thecandidate, through the Chakra centers. His energies are linked to the diversification factor. He raises thevibrational pitch of the candidate's aura so that it corresponds to the Elemental Plane related to the EarthElement.The 3 sets of knocks relate to the number of the Sephirah of Malkuth, for here the Sephirah is invoked,where previously the Earth Element was invoked. This is very much the multifaceted principle of GoldenDawn ritual.ADVANCEMENT - FIRST PARTThe Hierophant announces that a dispensation has been given to admit the candidate and orders theHegemon to give the customary alann. (Note 10: This is taken from PSALM 127, and shows yet anotherlayer of Golden Dawn ritual training - the magical use of the biblical PSALMS. Although scholars, such asGaster, have written extensively on this subject, we would refer the reader to a work that Mathers was familiarwith, and often used. This is THE MAGICAL USE OF THE PSALMS which was published originally in1788. There were a number of notations, that referred to the magical uses of the PSALMS, on a GoldenDawn master copy of the 1 = 10 Ritual, which had Mathers's initials by them. This particular Psalm was saidto protect a newborn child immediately after birth. The Golden Dawn modified this, to protect the candidateafter entrance to the hall.)The Hegemon goes clockwise to the ante-chamber where the candidate is blind-folded and given theCubical Cross. The Hegemon instructs the candidate in the conta,t knocks to gain entrance to the hall. TheKenix holds the door ajar, and by doing so, creates a gap in the portal of the ceremony, which in the 1= 10,should extend to the door of the ante-chamber. With the door open, the portal is kept slightly open. TheHegemon and Sentinal form a trianglewith the Kerux.This figure shows the temporary break,or gap in the portal, and is balanced onthe outside by the Hegemon andSentinal. If a Seminal is not present,then the Hegemon controls the openingand closing of the portal. Thesymbology of the Kerux dimming thelights is two-fold. The first is, thecandidate enters a new area to biro, theblackness of the Void. The second is,with the symbolic lowering of thelights, the Hierophant lowers thevibrational Pitch of the portal andallows the candidate to breech it, whilethe Kerux and Hegemon hold theVortex together.The candidate gives the Signs,Word, Grip, etc., of the NeophyteGrade, to show he has passed theprevious initiation He carries theFylfot Cross, in his right hand, which is248"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"taken from him by the Kerux, who holds it right up to the tune the Cross is explained to the Candidate. He isthen placed between the Pillars. His Higher Self is held in check, not only by the current of the Neophyte, butby the Goddess, Het-Hert, Guardian of the Immeasurable region. As the candidate kneels, with his right handon the earth, and with his left hand throws salt to the North, he utilizes the, 'As is above and so is below'principle. For the element he touches with his left hand, the Microcosm and the Macrocosm of the EarthElement in Nature, which extends not only in the soil, but to the stars as well.The next phase of the operation is the purification of the candidate by Fire and then Water. (Note: Here,the candidate has achieved the status of Salt of Fire. To go on to the next phase, which is a reduction to thewatery principle, he is purified with Fire then Water. The biblical quotations of MATTHEW, 5:13, \"Ye aresalt of the earth\" and MARK, 9:50, \"have salt in yourselves and peace with one another...,\" all relates to peaceand wisdom being analogous to salt, marking a higher level of understanding.)In the next phase of the operation, the Herophant describes the fundamental floor of the Temple, (one levelof it that is) which is the Tree of Life of Malkuth of Assiah In doing so, the Immeasurable Region becomesmeasurable, for the candidate has been provided with a blueprint of the Tree of Life (which he learned in the-previous grade). The controlling power on the floor, at this time, is the godform of Het-Hert. She has formeda cocoon, or Astral Station, around the candidate as a form of protection, and also as a guide. The Kern; asAnubis, leads the candidate towards the Station of Samael, where he is challenged by the Hiereus, telling him-of the area he cannot enter. Here, the godfonn of Het-Hert has saved the candidate from certain oblivion, andnow draws him back along the way he came, guided by Anubis.At the command of the Herophant, the candidate goes towards the Pathway of Good. The godform of-Metatron, in the form of the Hegemon, dazzles the candidate with his brilliance. Once again, he is protected byHet-Hert, who softens the glaze, and protects him from the glory of the reflected god-head. Upon returning tothe station, from which he started, the candidate has learned that there are no short cuts to the HiddenKnowledge lest he be blinded by the brightness of what he will find, or corrupted by the darkness that couldengulf him. This is also the first lesson in patience. So now, he enters, at the command of the Herophant, the1Vfiddle Path. At this point, the candidate is conducted to the foot of the Altar, guided by Anubis, in the formof the Kerux.When the candidate is at a point, a foot in front of the Altar, he is barred by the Hiereus and Hegemon, who-cross their elemental weapons before the Altar. (Note: Both officers turn clockwise to face West, as theygenerally face East and only turn for specific reasons.) This barring is done by the Lower Sephiroth of theSupernal of the Tree of Assiah. When the Herophant comesforward, he uses the Light from his Scepter to-unblock the energies of the higher Supernal.At this juncture, the energies start to change the aura of the candidate, concentrating indirectly on the lowerChakra center on the back, through the Kabbalistic Sephiroth of Malkuth, around the feet of the candidate.-The Herophant opens up the energies of the Tree. As he comes forward, he assumes the form of Sandalphon,desiring to link with Metatron in Kether. Guided by Sandalphon, the candidate is then shown the drawing atthe base of the Altar.(Note: GENESIS, 2:24, for the speech of the Herophant. Although Metatron is associated to Chokmah,this is very much the level of reflected glory, toned down, so that the candidate is able to grasp his energies.Metatron inhabits Kether, but works through Chokmah, though at this point, the energies are now directedfrom Kether, due to the efforts of the Herophant, as Sandalphon.)The diagram of the Gleaming Sword, (overpage) shows the descent of the energy through the Tree, fromKether to Malkuth. An unpublished Golden Dawn document states: \"...the Hierophant, as the GreatSandalphon, sheweth his power through the grasp which giveth the power of Metatron to the Neophyte...\"-What Mailers was trying to show here was that the Hierophant should draw the power of Metatron throughhis scepter, from the Altar, and then directly inject this into the aura of the candidate, through the grip withwhich he hold the candidate. The Herophant actually points in the general direction of the Altar, or to be-more precise, the top of it, where the inter-connecting currents of energy cross. He draws directly from thisjuncture. (Note: This method of energy transference, by touch, is a very old one. Taylor demonstrated thistransference to us. He could project energy into an aura 8 feet away, without touching, and achieve the same249"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"energy is transferred to the candidate, by way.of Sandalphon. As the energy goes into thecandidate, it manifests itself from top of thehead down, much in the same manner as in thediagram.)The candidate is invested with the Step, theSign, the Word, the Number, and thePassword. Of this, the most important is theSign, which is given by raising the right handto a 45 degree angle. The higher teachings ofthis sign relate it to the power of the Earth, forduring any astral contact, with any entity, thissign may be given as a sign of its Earth nature.(Note: When contacting plant life, one willoften find, when requesting that the spirit ofthe plant reveal its nature, that it will give aseries of elemental signs, which generally is amixture of more than one element. Byperforming this sign, when one invokes theElement of Earth during the InvokingPentagram Ritual, additional force is broughtto bear which results in more control for theuser. It is also used extensively in alchemicaloperations. The actual lifting of the handsignifies the raising of the veil to allow theforces of Metatron to mingle with that ofSandalphon in the Tree of Assiah).The Hegemon draws the candidate's attention to the Flaming Sword, and explains its symbolism which thecandidate experienced directly at the hands of the Ilerophant. The symbolism of the Cross hi the Triangle is hiessence much the same as the Flaming Sword principle - Spirit descending into matter.The general meaning of the Enochian Tablet of Earth is given and related back to the Angel, Ave, and the .'biblical BOOK OF ENOCH. (Note: The Inner Order 'H' Document of 'Clavicula TabuLsrum Enochi,' as it issometimes called, states:\"Now as to the general significance of the tables, and of the Officers of the Angels, and other remarkableobservations, these tables contain all human knowledge; they stretch to the knowledge of Solomon: for out ofit springeth Physic; the knowledge, finding, and use of all metals, the virtues of them, the congelations andvirtues of stones (they are all of one matter)- the knowledge of all Elemental Creatures amongst us, how manykinds there are, or what they are created. Those that live in the Air, Water, or Earth, by themselves. Theproperty of Fire, which is the secret life of all things:- but more particularly, the knowledge of all mechanicalcraft whatsoever, the secrets of man, the moving from place to place, as in the country etc. The knittingtogether ofNature, and ofthings that may perish; as well as the enjoying and knitting them together, etc.The Fylfot Cross is handed to the Candidate, by the Kenix, and is explained as pertaining to the solar .system in general, with the Sun, 4 Elements, and 12 signs of the Zodiac given. The &lux then takes thecandidate out(Note: The Fylfot Cross, (overpage) is a universal symbol, appearing in early American, European, andOriental cultures. Its two shapes relate to the passive and active principle. The counter-clockwise shape of theGolden Dawn version relates to the inward spiral and Goddesses, such as Artemis and Astarte, who areattributed to the Earth and the feminine attributes. The word of mouth teachings, of the Golden Dawn, relate250"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Nwattributed to the Earth and the feminine attributes. The word of mouth teachings, of the Golden Dawn, relatethe Fylfot to the swirling power of the Sephirah of Malkuth, that revolves inward so that the energy then goesback up through the Middle Pillar of the Tree ofKether.The next gesture, by the Hierophant, is somethingthat was dropped in many Golden Dawn temples,including Whare Ra, except when Jack Taylor wasHierophant. He continued to teach the way of histeacher, who was a protege of Felkin. In order toclose the Hall, of the First Part of the ceremony,without due disruption to the next part of the ritual, theHierophant grasps the uppermost grip of the scepter,the Path of Gimel, and with a movement of the cross,temporarily doses the ceremony. The wording on thiswas left up the individual Hierophant, but the gestureand purpose had to be dear. The use of the Gimel partof the scepter effectively cuts off the power from theSupernal of the Tree as the grip is above Daath. Thegodforms and stations will only exist for a short periodof time. The initial current of power will still comethrough, but be held in abeyance.ADVANCEMENT - FIRST PART(Note: The Temple ground plan, shown below, relates to the Astral foam of the Temple of NewJerusalem. Dr. Fellcin's copy of the book, CANNON, contains a number of sections which ascribe certainparts of the Outer and Inner Order Rituals of theGolden Dawn. The particular passage, ascribed tothe 'Ground Plan of the 1 = 10, Second Part, states:\"The name of the Tabernacle in the Hebrew (Ex.XXV. 9) is MShKN, and yields 1060, one less thanone length of a vesica 612 broad, two numbers arefound in the names of Apollo and Zeus...

These generally pertaining to his role in the ceremony. The officers all movesilently and efficiently and in a clockwise manner, or although the Supernals are sealed by the Hierophant, theTemple is not dosed, for it sits in a state of suspended animation, and no loud, or sudden movement, orunnecessary talk must take place to disrupt the energies. The Hierophant supervises the Templetransformation, noting that all is in place. A diagram kept hidden, in his clothing, is advisable, as the 'high'from the ceremony tends to make people light headed and things can easily be forgotten. It is advisable tokeep replacement diagrams and ornamentations, etc., inside the side altars.)Note: No one must cross the portal throughout the duration of the ceremony except where explicitlystated in the rituaLWhen all officers are seated, the Hierophant will, by the Gimel grip of the Scepter, open the ceremony inexactly the same way as he dosed it, at the end of the previous session, with only the wording being alteredslightly. He then instructs the Kerux to admit the candidate once the alarm has been given. The position of theentry into the hall is exactly the same as in the First Part, though once the door is open, the Kerux steps backand the candidate steps forward, with the Seminal directly behind him.They form another triangle, with the, apex being the candidate. The Hierophant tells him where theSymbolic Altar of Sacrifices stood in the Court of the Tabernacle, which relates to the Qippotbic, or negativeinfluences, which were left behind during the previous purification. Dadouchos purifies the candidate with across, and three swings of the Censer. This forms the Cross in the Triangle symbol (each swing being a pointof the triangle) which in itself is the symbol on the Altar. Here, the link is picked up from the First Part. TheStolistes also purifies in a similar manner, giving equal balance to the purification rite.The Hierophant tell the candidate of the symbolism of the Laver of Brass, and its relationship to purificationin the OLD TESTAMENT. The term, 'Waters of Creation,' had its roots in both Egyptian and Hebrewsymbolism, for water is the symbol of birth, which in this instance, is analogous to the new beginning of thecandidate, and is to a certain extent, a replica of the magical meaning of PSALIV1, 127. The candidate is takento the North, where he is barred by the I-fiereus. On giving the grip and Signs of the Neophyte, he advances toa position between the Pillars,while Hegemon comes forwardto face him where he is againchallenged. This time, he isasked to give the Grip and Signsof the Zelator. Kerux returns tohis seat, while Hegemon escortsthe candidate to the diagram ofthe Table of Shew-bread, whichrepresents the 12 Zodiac signs,the 12 Tribes, the 12 Loaves,and the 12 Foundations of theHoly City.Note: Al this point weare shown the figure at left, anOuter Order version of thediagram. Mathers expandedmore fiilly on this diagram, inthe Practicus Adeptus MinorGrade, under the heading of\"The Knowledge of the Ritualof the 12 Gates in Skrying andTravelling hi the Spirit Vision;answering to the Diagram of thetable of the Shewbread.\" As252"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"one advanced through the 4 Levels of the 5 = 6 Grades, the Inner Order explanation of this diagram was thenmade dear. (See SECRET WINER. ORDER RITUALS OF THE GOLDEN DAWN, page 174, Part of thispreviously unpublished lecture is included in GOLDEN DAWN ENOCHIAN MAGIC.)The pressure of the grip of the Hegemon is increased dramatically while he explains the symbolism of theTable ofthe Shewbread. This diagram is more than a mere diagram of 12 colored triangles, for it has a stationof its own, in this part of the ritual. (Very few of the Golden Dawn diagrams were colored. At Whare Ra, theAdept would often go back and color the diagrams in the colors of his or her choosing. I am unaware of whatthe temples in England did on thismatter.) It is the function of theHegemon to link the Ruach of thecandidate to the flashing tablet of theShewbread, for this is exactly what ithas become. Its energy is directed bythe Hegemon, into the aura of thecandidate, to make him more aware ofthe effects of nature on himself.The Hegemon and Hiereusconduct the candidate to the diagramof the 7-Branched Candle Stick asshown on the left, where itsrelationship to the number 7 is given.This shows similar influences, to thatof the preceding diagram, but on amore direct mode. Through theRuach of the Hiereus, the candidate isshown another flashing set of colors.On the Outer Order level it relatesheavily to the planets.

Refer to GOLDEN DAWN ENOCHIAN MAGIC for full Inner Order explanation ofDiagramFrom this point, the candidate has been taken the route of the Lightning Flask from the base of theTree. It is designed to instill in him a concept of learning. The candidate is led to the West of the Altar wherethe Hierophant comes forward swinging the censer (m the shape of the cross in the triangle) and gives thespeech concerning the Altar of Incense.The Altar of Malkuth is a physical representation of the spiritual Altar of Incense.The title of Zelator, or Pereclinus de Faustis, is bestowed on the candidate. It is to remind him of the earlyalchemical theme of the Rosicrucian grades. The Zelator was the stoker for the Anthor of the Alchemist, themenial of all tasks of which to begin his apprenticeship in Magic. Its vibratory pitch opens up the mysteries ofthe Earth Element for the student. The Zelator is lead to a seat in the Northwest by the Ken; who uses hiswand to indicate where he/she must go. The. Kean( institutes the proclamation that the Zelator is nowadmitted to the mysteries of Artez, the Hebrew name for Earth. The Sepher, Yetzirah, calls this the 'Path ofResplendent Intelligence.' On this path, one realizes that one is in Malkuth. By that virtue, one attains theunification with the laminations from Kether, because of the Central Pillar of the Tree. The old saying, \"Ketheris Malkuth and Malkuth is Kether,\" very much applies here. The reference to the 'Throne of Binah,' by theHierophant, in quoting from the Sepher, Yetzirah, is very complex. It must be remembered that Binah is the253"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The meaning of some of the Tides of Malkuth, as given in the speech of the Hierophant, are as follows:1.'Gates of the Shadow of Death' - this shows the karmic pattern of lives one lives through in which onenever really dies.2.'Gate of Justice' - this shows that everything must be balanced before ascension to the next level ofexistence.3.'Gate ofPrayer' - this shows the devotional aspect oflife.4.'Gate of the Daughter of the Mighty Ones' - this relates to the birth of Earth itself; in terms of planetaryrelationships.5. \"Gate of the Garden of Eden' - the entrance way to the state of the Divine is through Earth and humanincarnations.)SYMBOLISM OF THE CLOSINGAfter the proclamation that the Temple is about to be dosed, all officers face the East and adore the Lordand King of Earth. They forma hexagram in front of the Tablet and say the prayer of the Earth Spirits in frontof the Tablet. This prayer is taken from Levi's TRANSCENDENTAL MAGIC, and though there are somedifferences, they appear to be in that of translation from the French, as this book was not translated intoEnglish until 1896 - some years after the Elemental Rituals had been written. The Gnomes are the ElementalSpirits of Earth. Their King, Gob, was said to live in the subterranean areas of the Earth, and have control ofall metals. The Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram is done, with the Flierophants scepter, after the command todepart in peace. Again, this is done through the Earth Tablet rather than directly from it. The Grade is dosedwith the 10 Knocks of Malkuth, by the Hierophant and Hegemon. Once the prayer to the Elements is read outin front of the Tablet, and the Elementals are told to depart, the Earth aspect of the ceremony winds down.The Elemental King of the Tablet of Earth starts to withdraw his energy from the tablet. The use of thescepter here cuts the power from the ceremony and also defuses the godforms. The godforms on the Diasdematerialize followed by those of the Temple officers. By the time those in the Temple leave the hall, theirauras will be magnetically charged from the ceremony, but the godforms around them will have ceased tomist.Note: The allocution is sometimes read out after the ceremony is finished If so, all members remain seateduntil it is finished. This aspect of the ceremony depended on how vocal the Hierophant was feeling and it wasincluded in the candidate's copy of the ritual to study at his or her leisure.254"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Theoricus RitualINTRODUCTIONFor many years the only reference point on the Elemental Grade rituals were in Crowley's 'Equinox'and Regardie's first publication of the Golden Dawn. Though Regardie was more complete in his publicationof Golden Dawn documention than what Crowley published, a comparision of the rituals between these twopublications, showed that there were a number of diagrams and explanations missing from Regardie's editions.Originally, Regardie made the statement that those rituals of the Stella Matutina were in fact watereddown versions of the Golden Dawn. This came from his experiences in the Bristol-Hennes Temple in Englandin the mid 1930's. In 1983, when Regardie came to visit our Thoth-Hermes temple in Wellington, he foundthat the rituals of that temple (which were inherited documents from Where Ra Temple) were identical tothose of the Golden Dawn, and to the ones he was working on in his book \"Complete Golden Dawn system ofMagic\". There were some minor variations, but in fact these were minimal and nothing like the mass omissionof diagrams as given in the Bristol-Hennes Temple.Before I wrote the commentary on the 2=9 grade ritual, I had the opportunity to study a number ofvariations of the 2=9 grade from two Golden Dawn temples, and from the published work of Mr. Torrens onthe subject, with some of the drawings in the latter being a real pi 1771e that did not resemble any previousworks I had seen before and some text alterations as well. I mention this after Laura Jennings, co-chief of theRa Horakhty Temple in Washington State drew my attention to a number of differences in the diagrams tothose that appear in this text, such as the cubical cross and the letter variations in the Enochian tablets.As stated in our previous work on the 1=10 grade, it is rather surprising to find out how many peopleignore the Elemental Grades. On a personal note I am finding that I am always coming back to them, evenwhen I think I know the ceremony backwards something always turns up that adds a new dimension to the-rituals. Not only do the Elemental rituals expose one to different levels of energy, but they also teach groupritual and how to handle the power emitted. Apart from being an excellent training ground, they also give onea certain degree of confidence that can be built on as one advances through these Outer Order levels to the-Inner Order.In this chapter I have omitted a single explanation of the 21st Key of the Tarot. I have done this for tworeasons. The first is that all the diagrams shown on the Thirty Second Path relate to the Key in some way, andwhere this has happened, I pointed out what to look for and given and explanation as to the correspondences.But it must also be for the reader to do their own work in this area and not blindly accept our work, or anyothers as gospel. Any omission allows the reader to do their own research into this area. The second is that afull description of the Golden Dawn tarot cards will be given in our book 'Magical Tarot of the Golden Dawn'which will be a companion guide to all the ritual books. This will be an additional help, but the 01111S is still onthe individual making his or her own connections to the Tarot, as it is part of the fun and the necessity oflearning. While I feel I have revealed a great deal I have still left a little something for others to work out forthem selves.Also given in this book is how to make the Magic Squares, Sigils and Seal of the Moon. While this wasnever part of any official method of teaching at Whare Ra, many members of that temple worked very hard onthese squares, so I am told, though it appears that they kept it to themselves. Since the Luna Seals and Sigils-are the hardest to draw, I have included very detailed descriptions of how to obtain them, and this is, to thebest of my knowledge, the first time all of this has been published before. A number of distinguished occultauthors have written books that have included the sigils and seals of the planets and we are told it is a simplematter of just tracing lines along certain numbers which is a vast understatement if ever there was one. I havefelt it is about time that this should come out into the open and am extremely surprised that this has not beendone before. The reason for this is that few I feel have worked them out, going by some of the spellings of theHebrew names published in this area with sighs not matching the names given and letters conveniently left outand added so that a sigh might fit into place.255"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"One of the main reasons that I have written detailed in formation on the Golden Dawn rituals was sothat this information would be freely available for all those who wish to use it, especially for those who havestarted up Golden Dawn temples of their own without any prior training which I hope will open new doors tothem. I personally hope that these ritual books will encourage those who wish to start their own temple andwas the main reason for this publication. Frankly too much has been put on lineage these days and not enoughon plain hard workQuite recently, I received a letter from a person in Australia who wanted to start up a Golden DawnTemple, and did not how to go about it. I repeat my answer to her here for all of those who think along thesame lines. My advice to her was get a group together and start doing the rituals, with various associates, sothat all parts will be familiar to them. The secret of all ritual work is to do it and sit back and contemplate it.Not everyone will be able to be initiated by established Temples nor get the training that goes along with it butwith these Golden Dawn ritual books coming out I hope there will be more than enough informarion to getthose temples started or open up newer levels to established ones.256"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Theoricus 2=9Sign of Air Grade"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"2 = 9The Theoricus Grade of the Golden Dawn relates to the Element of Air and the Kabbalistic Sephirah ofYesod. Since Yesod is related to the Moon, most would assume that the element related here would be Water.There are a number of reasons for this apparent reversal, the first being the fact that when dimbing up the Tree ofLifeone goes from densist element to the lightest. For what we are climbing is the YOD HEH VAU HEH principle inreverse, by working our way back through to YOD, the initiating impetus. Another very important reason for this isthat in the Golden Dawn Cipher manuscripts (see Secret Inner Order Rituals of the Golden Dawn by Pat Zalewsla)to which Mathes based the Outer Order Golden Dawn rituals on, dearly stated that Yesod is ascribed to Air (for thepurpose ofritual initiation).Fundamentally we are dealing with overlaps, not only of both an Elemental and Planetary Nawre, but alsoheavy Kabbalistic symbolism, which in some cases seems to ascribe to neither faculty though is nevertheless asequally important.Before the Candidate can enter the Sephirah, he or she must go through the Portal ofthat Grade, which is the32 Path, which still retains the trappings ofthe former Earth Grade ofZelator, and as such, is the reason why many ofthe symbols that appearing on the first part of the Ceremony are Earthy by nature. The Candidate mist push forwardup the Earthy 32 Path because it is the only Element opened up to so far, and this will not change until he or sheenters the Sephirah ofYesod.The Air Grade is very important for it is the first of the Elemental Grades that the Candidate undergoes wherea visible change occurs. Some years ago Taylor, told us that the 2 = 9 Grade is the one where the Ego fast starts toexpand, and the aspiring Adept begins to tier the psyclic musdes that he or she has been made aware ot through thefaculty of finial When our own Thoth-Hermes Temple was formed, we noticed varying changes at this level, whichseemed to support Taylor's observations as for many the Theoricus Grade became a stumbling block for those whojoined the Temple with the greatest intention, seemed to opt out. To understand from a Kabbalistic viewpoint as towhat exactly happens to the individual when he goes through the Ceremony ofthe Theoricus Grade, Mailers says inhis rather colourful language:\"From Yesod are formed the generative and excretory organs, and therein is the seat of theLower desires, as bearing more on the double nature of on one hand, the rejection of the Qlippoth,and on the other hand the Simulacrum of the vital forces in Tiphareth. It is the special seat of theautomatic consciousness. That is not the Will, but the Simulacrum ofthe Will in Tiphareth. Yesodis the lowest of the Sephiroth of the Ruach, and representeth \"Fundamental Action\" It thereforegovemeth generation. In Yesod is therefore the Automatic Consciousness or Simulaaum of theWill. This Automatic Consciousness is to the Nephesch what the Daath action is to the RuachThus, there being, a simulacram or reflection ofthe heart and vital organs in the parts governed byYesod, if the consciousness of Tiphareth be given unto this wholly it shall pave the way for disenxeand death. For this will be a withdrawing of the vital forces of the Name, which are the citadel ofTiphareth, to locate them in Yesod, which is a more easily attacked position. For the AutomaticConsciousnss is the translater of the Ruach into the Nephesch.\" (For a frill explanation of thetechnical terminology of the Kabalis-tic Soul and its component parts then see \"IVIiddle Pillar\" byIsrael Regardie, Llewellyn Publicarkms)Now to some of you who are reading this it may appear profound, while to others it may appear like doubleDutch. The problem here is that when dealing with the Kabbalistic Soul in explaining what is happening to the bodyand spirit, during ritual, the limitation placed on it is too narrow a framework for full egression. At Where Ra, whenanything hire this was explained, it was done through using both Chakras and Subtle Body anatomy. I personnaly feelthat this adds, rathe- than subtracts from ritual, and opens up deeper explanations of ritual and its effect. Tayloralways used this formulea and it is the one I appreciate the most. Now as to try and give a similar explanation of theabove Mathes quotation, through a different framework we have the following explanation:The four Lower Chakras on the body represent the Lower Nature of the body - the desires. The four LoweChakras show their seats of power in the Physical, Etheric, AstrallEmotional and Lower Mental Bodies- which arecollectively called the Ego. These are the bodies that die with the physical and leave the three higher bodies - Higher257"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Mental, Causal and Spirit to be the guiding force or Higher Selfthat instructs us through successive incarnations. Ineach ofthese three upper bodies there is a blueprint for the Ego, connected by the seven Qialaas in each subtle body.Ifthe man or woman continues to seek gratication of the desires for the Ego the higher self with not send down theDivine that we seek and man or woman will develop. They are doomed to repeat their mistakes, often incurringkarmic debts (usually given through disease) until the individual gets back on the correct Path. When the LowerCharkras are in harmony with the Higher three and all the subtle bodies are comedy aligned, then the whole spitivaland physical being become illumned.SYMBOLISM OF THE TEMPLEThe three Hebrew letters of Shin, Samelch and Qoph hanging above the Dais are the energies the Candidatehas yet to travel on and experience though they nevertheless still effect the ceremony to a certain degree indirectly andofthis Mathes says:\"The shape of the Paths of Shin, Samekh, and Qoph representeh a Fan- a symbol of Air towhich this Grade is related. Asa fan gives life to the stillness of Air so does it also chew forth theapproac,hment ofthe Ruach through the power of ritual.\"The placement ofthe Banner oftheEast and West is the same as the previous Grade, for this is still the Path ofEarth. This is also shown by the Pentagram of Earth (this was included as part of the Cipher manuscripts and wascontinued by Mathes in the Second part which I feel is not warranted in the latter) which hangs above the Dais.The Altar has the same meaning as in the previous grade in so much that it represents the Material Universewith the elements placed upon it representing the forces of the Elements. The entire concept is that the forces of theElements can be activated by the implements of the Altar to serve those officers in the temple. In many respects theAltar here among with the implements on it are a blank force ofpower that can be manipulated either for good or evilas it is the welder and not the force that causes the problems. This is further stated by showing the Garden ofEden tothe right of it (an aspect of the White Pillar ofMerey and its many concepts) and the Gehenna, the Hell of old on theleft side ofthe Altar.On top of the Altar is the Trump of the Universe which shows stability and Order. The lamp on the Daisrepresents the force coming through the Enochian Tablet while the Lamp in the North represents the Earth Elementwhich is still present through the Path The incense in the South West Area which is goverened by the Kerub ofFire.The Stolisties and the Dadouchos are two Temple Officers of the previous Grades that are omitted here withtheir places being taken by the Hegemon and the Kew( Possibly the main reason for this is simply that the CipherManuscripts ofthe Golden Dawn chose to do it this way and Mathes simply followed suit. Within the Golden Dawnpapers we are told that the minimum Grade for the rank of Stolisties and Dadouchos is 1= 10 and we have oftenheard the argument that these officers were dropped because the rank of 2 = 9 is above their station of 1 = 10.However the 1 = 10 is a minimum requirement only and many of the Temple Officers on the floor held Inner Orderrank and also the Hegemon, who has to hold the minimum rank of 3 = 8 is present in 4 = 7 grade which shoots thisargument down in flames.My own interpretation ofthis, is that Stolisties and Dadouchos are omitted simply because that part the Gradeof the Earth Element, the purification, is done not with Water and Fire but through all Four Elements, portrayed bythe symbolism on the altar. These are its stabilising influences in much the same way as the Four Kerubs balance theForces ofthe Universe as shown in the tamp ofthe same title. This theory was the basic one accepted at Whare Ra.Before going into detailed explanations ofthe Diagrams in ritual, I would like to cover the point ofwhat effecta diagram has when being presented in the Golden Dawn ritual as I feel that this has never been fully understood. Thefirst aspect to consider is purely pychological in nature, and the theory behind it, is that, when a diagram is present itacts on the psyche in a subliminal way that sometimes may take weeks or months before the significance of thediagram can be appreciated. The way in which this is accomplished is that in the ritual the magnetic cementsand energy patterns of the body and subtle bodies are manipulated directly. Symbols have power, that is a fact, andwhen a symbol is presented to an individual they tend to absorb this symbol into their system. By absorption, I mean258"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"that the higher subtle bodies, whether they be Etheric, Astral, or Mental, attune themselves to the symbol, with themagnetic manipulation by the Temple Officers as the catalyst.Over the years I have been often told by teachers in various religions, that the Inner Self knows all, and whencertain symbols strike and attunement to some hidden recess then that in fact helps other aspects of this knowledge tofilter down through the subtle bodies to us where we can perceive the symbol in its actuality.Quite often, one will hear of a scientist who sees a symbol hi nature, identifies with it, then after someexperimentation finds that the symbol is an important part part of our makeup, like the symbol that sparked off thediscovery ofthe Double Helix, as but one example.This does not mean that every symbol we see or read in out day to day activities will eventually bring aboutsome form of Maned thought. However, when a person in ritual or whose subtle bodies are pliable, then this effectwill occur, though it is not always spontaneous and usually depends on the development of the individual. This-applies not only to form but to colour and sound as wet Author Francis King, once described the Gokien Dawnrituals as 'a mass attack on the psyche and I tend to agree with him.A helpful hint to some temple officers and lierophants, I have found it useful when presenting a diagram to a-candidate during ritual, ifyou open up the energies of the heart c,halna and guide these into the diagram, they will bepicked up and absorbed by the candidate through his or her same chalaa. It took me quite a few years to understandthis principle, and longer to able to use it effectively. It is also an extremely difficult thing to do when reading out aspeech during ritual, but it will help the candidate greatly in this area ifthe officers are able to accomplish this.Kabbalistic* speaking this type oftransference is from the Ruach of one person to the Ruach of another. Itis when a speech or diagram is not understood consciously but accepted at an inner level.Diagrams of the 32nd Path.Cubical Cross: fieThe firstAdiagram shows the application of the letters and the second the translation of the_letters to their-astrological counterparts. You will note that we have the Zodiac circle with the planets ofMerany, Mars, Jupiter andSaturn beside the Fixed Signs with the dual association of the Sun itifiout of Mercury. This however has the planetsnot matching the Elemental positions. The planets of Venus and the Moon beside the Elements show a direct-correspondence to the Trump \"Universe\", with the Moon above her and the seven pointed Star below her and thefigure being represented by the Elements.

We also must add that while it is easy for us to sit back and makecorrections on things past it must have taken an enormous amount of work to create the rituals and tie then hr withthe diagrams and Tarot that Mathes did and if he did not get it right all the time, considering what he did wt rightthen am sure no one will hold it against him.Diagram ofthe Garden ofEdenIn Genesis 2:8-14 the Biblical description ofEden is as follows:\"And the Lord Godplanted in Garden Eastward ... anda river goeth forth from Eden towater the garden ; and from thenceit is divided and becomes fourheads. The name of the fast isPhison: that which compasseth thewhole land of Havilah, where is thegold And the gold of that land isgood: there is Bdelium and theonyx stone. And the name of thesecond river is Gilion: that is itwhich encompasseth the whole ofthe land of Cush. And the name ofthe third river is lidekel; that iswhich floweth before Asyria. Andthe fourth river, that is Euphrates.'When studying this diagramwe see the four rivers which meet ata central point, attributed toTiphareth on the Tree of Life, at the centre of the Garden. For this was the Tree that gave theForbidden Fruit, that both Adam and Eve sinned. The took from the Tree ofKnowledge, from thehigher level. There are six concentric squares surrounding a seventh, which contains the Tree ofLife. This relates to the Seven Heavenly Mansions.Taylor was convinced that this refered to the Seven Rays and the Seven Subtle Bodies in each which has theseven chains. We must remember that within the Golden Dawn the seven Chakras were discussed openly(according to Felkin's notes, by Westoott) and as such were not to be ignored If you check both Kether andMallarth on this diagram, you will see that they are joined and as such shows the perfection of the the beings withinthe Garden. All chakras functioning in harmony with each other. From another Kabbalistic viewpoint, the Qlippothhad not as yet reached Mallath, and were held in check by the Wall surrounding the Garden, and hence nocontamination from the outside.The wall around Eden shows twelve gates. Each gate represents an astrological house. In the Garden thetwelve houses were incorporated in one, but outside the Garden, Man must come to terms with the 12 houses oflife. Now in the preceeding diagram ofthe cubical across, I drew your attention to the fact that it resembles the 21stKey of the `Universe'. The diagram of Garden of Eden follows in its footsteps and shows that same message. TheTree ofLife is now analogous to the figure in the Trump, surrounded by the seven squares (the star) and the TwelveGates (the Zodiac), which are anchored by the four rivers (the four Kerubics). The same pattern repeated in threedifferent forms.Seven Infernal Mansions and the Four Seas:The Zohar tells us that while God took six days to create the world, the infernal regions of man were createdat night in the minor image of the world above them. At the point where both day and night merge, the elementswere mixed and unsettled, forming a division ofthe waters (of the First day). Due to this imbalance between the Firstand Second Day, the Third day was created to finish the work ofthe Second day.260"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"In the above diagram above, the firstcircle shows thew waters of tears are separatedfrom the night after the fall. It is the ay ofAdam, separated from the first Adam and theloss of the Shekinah. The second circle showsthe Waters of Citation. This represents thecreation away from tlx Light. It is the creationofthe shells of the Qlippoth and the creation ofman from Adam. The third circle shows theWaters of the Ocean, which team with livingcreatures, both Good and Evil, and it is fromthis that the Serpent issues forth. The FourthCircle is the False Sea and is the Astral Worldwhere deception and reflection are confused.The Four Seas am also reflections of the FourRivets that issued from the Garden of Eden(and the Four Worlds of the Kabbalists), for itis they who must nourish the Seven InfernalHabitations.On the right side of the diagram, the lesser circles represent the Seven Earths. Though these circles are alsoreferred to as Earths, they should be referred to as States of Awareness or Consciousness that envelope man atdifferent times. They are also a reflections of the Sephiroth, and are part of the Garden that man inherited that hecould aspire to, for these were left with man when he was banished from the Garden of Eden. In many respects thesewere the shells ofthe Kingdoms ofEdom which had been destroyed by their imperfect ability to accept God's Lightand are but shadows oftheir former glory.The entire concept here is to show the frisky of Matter over the Spirit For the Earths represent the materialside of man, his passions and desires which eventually will crumble with time, as shown by Aretz, the earth fiaherestaway from the present Some consider the 7 earths' periods of time or evolution, which starts with the present,Mabel, the most perfect ofthem all, and leads to the less perfect worlds, to the final crumble and decay of Aretz.SEVEN EARTHSAretzDry Earth, land.AdamahRed EarthGiaUndulating ground such as a plain or valley.NeschiahForgetfulnessTorahDry sandy earthAreqaEarthThebel/C'heledWorld/TimeOn the left hand side ofthe diagram, there are Seven Infernal Habitations.

There are two constant factors here.The first is that symbol denotes some type of leaning The second is that itshows speed, possibly a message symbol, shown by the wings. Jung's ideas toa certain extent amalgamates these symbols and considers the symbolism ofthe snakes in balanced disposition a settled in situation so that transformationor integration can occur. Furthermore he stated that the caduceus as thesymbol of Meralius stands for the Alpha et Omega of the workAlchemic* you have the unification of opposites, the conjunction, themasculine Sulphur and feminine Quicksilver, held in equilibrium, at the mostcrucial and final part ofthe experiment.The symbol itself however has been around since antiquity and there isno doubt that it copies part ofhuman name, and is a blueprint for the rising ofthe Kundaline energy up through the Spinal column. Since we have talkedabout subtle bodies and chakras it is proper that we discuss this other aspect ofetheric anatomy whose symbol ofthe crossed serpents, the ancients knew through meditation.Indian Vedic literature (originally obtained through clairvoyant perception) states that in the spine there arethree nadis (channels). The left hand channel is called the 'Ida-nadi' and is the negative side. This corresponds directlyto the Left hand snake of the Cachro is The Right hand channel is called the Pingala-nadi' and is the negative andcorresponds to the right hand snake. Both of these aim cross along a central channel called the `Suslunna-nadr.Now it is the central channel that the Kundaline energy rises up from the base of the spine. As it does so it integratesthe chakras and stops when the it reaches the main clialaa at the top ofthe head. Both the 'Ida' and the Pingala' helpbalance and stabilise this energy.If we study the entire effect of the three channels of Indian literature then we are coming close to the realmeaning of the symbol of the caduceus. I would stress though that the Eastern aspect of this symbolism not beignored, but accepted as part of a gutter truth. We should also note that the rArli - is associated to Mercury, andAir planet, there is a certain amount of empathy with this grade.The tips ofthe wings of the diagram rest in three Sephiroth of both Chokmah and Binah, Understanding andWisdom. (Which in physical terms show both lobes of the Medulla) These are separated from the Lower Sephirothby the Sephirah of Death, the shadowy Sephirah that is a gateway or passageway through a type of no mans land.This huge Gulf is something that must be crossed and a passage found before the Wisdom and Understandingbecome available to the candidate. The heads of the serpents rest in Chesed and Geburah, Severity and Mercy, Theequal balance that is needed before one transcends into the darkness ofDaatli, the point of balance and equilibrium.When applying the Kabbalistic Soul we have the Ruach and Nephesch in the domain of the serpent (thewaning aspect ofman, his nature, in trying to over come and understand his true vocation), this represents the part ofthe Soul that is man, it will cease to exist on his death when the upper part ofthe Soul withdraws until another periodofincamation262"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Serpent of Wisdom: In a Whare Ra copy of this diagram thefollowing quote from the Sepher Yetsirahwas given with the initials of &RIAD.1893:The celestial Dragon, T L I, isplaced over the Universe like a King uponthe Throne; the revolution ofthe year is asa King over his dominion; the heart ofman is the King of warfare. Moreover, hemade all things one from other; and theBolin set good over against evil, andmade good things from good, and evilthings from evil, and with the evil He didtry good. Happiness is reserved for thegood and misery is kept for the wicked.From this it shows the Celestial Dragon(which is analogous to the Serpent)placed over the Universe. If we reduceeach path back to its elemental, planetaryand zodiac association, then the Serpenton the Tree covers all of these. As in thediscussion of the Kundaline energy inEastern philosophy then we have yetanother concept. Knowledge gainedthrough the rising of the Kundaline as itbreaks through the seven chinas on thespine and helps us to trancend the mice ofour ignorance.When I first studied this diagram,I noted how it differed from the publishedversions of Regardie, which had the neckand head of the serpent coming aroundKether. The Whare Ra version and thoseof Mathers, Yeats and Hyde-Lees (asgiven in \"Yeats, the Tarot and the GoldenDawn\" reproduces the original drawingsso no doubt is given to the correct way ofdrawing the Serpent on the Tree.) showthe serpent does not reach Kether but itshead rests on the first Path, attrbuted to Aleph.The Flaming Sword in the same diagram, shows the descending power of Kether descending down toMalkuth. This is also the Flaming Sword ofthe Kerubim who guarded the Gates ofEden, descend down to Malkuthto open the way for those who follow the correct path. When combined with the Serpent it is the first real symbol ofSelf Sacrifice in the Outer Order for it shows the loss of innocence of Man and his expulsion from the Garden ofEden because of it. Man, as Adam, sought the Higher Learning, as shown by the climbing serpent, the Kundaline, yethis spiritual subtle bodies were not yet ready to receive this divine state without the process of experience. It was thisone act that the seeds ofKanna were shown sown for all ofmankind.When this diagram is shown to the Candidate, it instils in him or her the need to reach back and let the Serpentrise through a solid framework, the Tree. It shows us that the rising of the serpent energy will not happen unless onesacrifices the whims ofthe flesh for the need of the spirit.263"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Diagram oflightning Flash: (at base of Altar)This diagram is a small one, when compared to theothers, and focuses directly on the lower reflecting triangle ofNetzach, Hod and Yesod, which it represents. Hod is called`Splendour' and shows the Beauty and gives us our sense ofaesthetics. This gives us our appreciation ofthings and placesa strong emphases on faun or structure being in unifomfitywith that around us. Victory' shows us the triumph overadversity. The unification at Yesod, 'Foundation' shows thatthe 'Victory' must be shaped and funned into somethingthat can built on. As one walks into Yesod he or she mustaccept these responsibilities of new growth as the Spirit, asthe Lightning Flash descends from this triad into theCandidate.

These of course correspond with thePinazs ofMercy and Severity on the Tree ofLife.In Isaiah 30:26 we are told 'The Light ofthe Moon shall be as THE light'. The operativeword here is LIGHT, and it is precisely this thatthis diagram refers to. The Light of the Sun inTipherath is reflected by the Luna influence inYesod through the Middle Pillar. This Light is theAstral light, which the candidate will firstencounter hi Yesod It will appear to come insmall glimpses, and for long periods there will benothing at all The twin crescents show thewaxing and waning of this Light while the largercircle shows that with TIME, the entire astral will264"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"be revealed.Eliphas Levi in his book 'Transcendental Magic' gives the following explanation of the effects of the AstralLight which is very appropriate for this diagram:`The Astral light warns us of coming influences by its action on the more or less sensible. Instantaneoussympathies, electric loves, are explosions of the Astral Light, which are exactly and mathematicallydemonstrable as the discharge of the strong magnetic batteries. Thereby we may see what orpected dangersthreaten the uninitiated person who is perpetually fooling with fire in the neighbourhood of unseen powder-magazines. We are saturated with the Astral Light, and we project it unceasingly to make room and toattract fresh supplies.:The above quote stands as strong today as it ever did, and to a certain extent 'hits the nail net on the head' whenconcerning the actions ofthis diagram in particular.In Flying Ro1123, Per Bullock says ofthe Astral Light:`Yettirah is the Astral Light, which is especially the medium wherein operates the Ethers of the Elementsunder the presidency of the planets. I use the expression 'Ether of the Elements' in order to covey thesignificance of the hermetic conception of the 'elements'. The Elements of the ancients (Earth, Air, Fire andWater) are not at all the physical elements but the subtle Ethers underlying these- the presence of which isnecessary before the gross elements can be manifested.'What Percy Bullock was trying show, was the effect of the Light coning down through the planes is a gradualprocess of development, not unlike the subtle bodies of man himself The Light when viewed will be lighter in theHigher planes than the lower.One Title of Yesod is 'Pure Intelligence' , and it must be considered here, for it directly relates to this diagram,for it shows the Light ofKether flowing down the Middle Pillar to Tiphareth, where it refined and then on to Yesod.However the duplicate energy ofboth Hod and Netzach also hold it in a type oflimbo state, as shown in the diagram,as it is the only Sephiroth on the Central Pillar, apart from Kether, that is receptive to and balances the Lunar arcs.In many respects it is the Eastern Toni' or feminine principle that is receptive to and able to absorb bothpassive and active influence, and hold them in abeyance in a field ofperfect equilibrium.Magic Square or Kamea ofthe Moon:Now in the past very little comment has been given to the fomiation of the Kameas or Magic Squares and the sillstraced thereon and because of this fact we will now do an indepth look at both. They were first drawn to publicattention in the works of Agrippa and even in the many reproductions of his work there were what can be construedas deliberate mistakes in the formations of the Kameas or Squares and also in the Sighs. The Golden Dawn had in itsrituals these squares and Seals and if viewed closely one will find some errata continued. Jack Taylor had this to say.\"I was never very comfortable with some of the mistakes I found in the rituals and especially some of theSeals and Sigils of the Magic Squares. I approached Mrs.Felkin a number of times about them but she simplyfogged me off and told me that a good student wouldfind them and to let it be. This sort of dalliance is not theway I operate and told her so. I was quite surprised tofind though the number- of high ranking members whohad not bothered to check these things out and ifthey didsaid little or nothing.

While the Kamea itself is the Power Gridthe Seal itself is the power transformed into a workable geometric force.

The Golden Dawn uses the Traditional Seals and Res and therein lies a fewproblems. Since the Works of Agrippa published these Seals and Sigils and Francis Barrett published than with aslight variation many have accepted these as correct where in fact they are not. It should also pointed out that some ofthe Sighs as published hi both Regardie publications on the Golden Dawn differ from those given out in our 2=9grade papers ofWhare Ra Temple inNew Zealand and are more compressed while the other are more elongated.â¢\t\tThe simplest way to check out the Sigh into draw them over the Kamea of the Moon and then compare it tothe Sigh in the published versions based ofthe Golden Dawn on the works of Agrippa.

The poetic license undertaken here byAgrippa and those after him is that the Sigil that was bentis straightened out. As we progress through the Sigils wewill find out that some sighs are in fact tacked on to othersso that a complete sigh is formed. A comparison to theversion of this Sigil as given in Barrett's \"Magus\" showsthat there are some changes made by the Golden Dawnfrom that though obviously not enough!SPIRIT OF THE SPIRITS OF THE MOONThis Sigil is called SHAD BARSCHEMOTH HA-SCHARTATHAN which numerically is300,4,2,200,300,40,70,400-5,300,200,400,400,700 and reduces to 30,4,2,20,30,40,70,40-530,20,40,40,70. Thereare number ofversions here, depending on whose spelling one accepts. To obtain the traditional sigh ofBand and ofthat used within the Golden Dawn one would have to accept a spelling of the word with a 11' inserted in an peculiarposition. Oddly enough within the Golden Dawn they spelt the name of the Spirit correctly but opted not to changethe sigh which is strange in itself The spelling of this Spirit's name in the Crowley/Bennet \"Sepher Sephiroth\" is notcorrect in the strictest tradition.

There are quite afew variations ofthis which again relate to different spelling but this version is the traditional one.SEAL OF THE MOONThis is one Sigil or Seal that is a very tricky one to work out. The lines from 5 to 77 and 37 to 45 are drawn whichcompartmentises the Kamea into four equal parts, much the same as the construction of the numbers of the Seal arebegun. Npw start with the number 78 in the upper part of the Seal. We use this number because it is the neat numberfrom 77, where the cross line or diagonal line ends. From this we then select the second number of each square, sothe line would be 78,29 then 70 which reduced to its lastdigit would be 8,9 and 10. The 0 being the optimumpoint and the numbers simply start again 21,62,13 and 54would then be reduced to 1,2,3 and 4. Then go to the linebelow,staring from 54 and go 63,22,61,30 which reducedis 3,2,1,0. Then 78 and 79 are 8 and 9 as the reverseformat ends and one then counts in ascending orderagain. From 78 we then go 79,80,31,72,63,54 whichreduced is 9,0,1,2,3,4. The following quadrant belowuses the same principle. Starting with 4 because it is thenumber before the diagonal line begins. The right and lefthand quadrants of the square use a system of the last digitin each square but this time alternating numbers are used.For example take the number 46, which is the numberafter the diagonal Trace through the numbers46,15;56,25,66,35,and 76. Now reduced to their last digitone has then 6,5,6,5,6,5. Going from 76 into the nextvertical column one finds an additional digit added to thepattern. 76,75,34,65,24,55 and 46 which reduces to 6,5,4,5,4,5,6. The next vertical column,using the same principleadds yet another digit and produces 76,75,74,33,64,55 and 46 which reduces to 6,5,4,3,4,5,6. The opposite quadranton the left follows the same pattern. The reason they did not continue with a fourth bend is because it would onlyapply to two quadrants and the sigils were supposed to be mirror images of each other. I found the Whare Ra copiesof the sigils and seal of the Moon so badly copied that tackle them in ritual would have caused a great deal ofproblems.268"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"LINEAL FIGURES ATTRIBUTED TO THE PLANETSThis diagram (sometimes given hi two tablets) came under the care of the Hegemon and it was one of themost changeable diagrams hi Golden Dawn Ritual. I have seen at least five different versions of these before 1900.This was mainly because there could be a number of variations or applications to each planet and what the candidatewas supposed to see was simply the way these diagrams could be applied. As a result a number oftemples decided touse their own individual preference as to whether it was either a \"God or a \"Chaui\". There was also a different ideaas to what level this was supposed to be taught at. Originally it was supposed to have been taught at level eventhough the diagrams had been shown to the Candidate at the 231 level Eventually, according to Taylor, those incharge of teachings (called Daemonstrators or Wardens appointed by the Chiefs to teach in certain areas.) taught orgave out the following papers on the subject at 2-3. level To give but one example of its application is in Evocationrituals such as the one Allan Bement did in Crowley's Equinox, but this is just one example of many applications wehave seen over the years. As Taylor put it to us:\"If the mathematics of Magic Squares can produce power so cangeometric forms which also has a maths basA. These forms placed oftalismans can quicken up or work in a slow manner to achieve ones aimThey cannot be studied enough for they have a variety of applications.\"The following lecture on the subject, written by both Westcott andMathers and issued out at Wham Ra Temple gives a very importantexplanation of what these figures representThe Point within the Circle represents the operation of Kether ifgeneral, and the Cross within the Circle that of Cholanah, for therein arethe mots of Wisdom In using these Lineal Figures in the formation ofTalismans under the Sephiroth, remember that:The Point with the Circle corresponds to Kether. The Crosswithin the Circle corresponds to Cholcmalt The Triangle within theCircle corresponds to Binah. The Square within the Circle correspondsto Chesed. The remaining Sephiroth should have the double, treble orquadruple foams of their lineal figures bound together in their Talismans.For example, in the Heptangle for Netzach, the Heptagon and the twoforms of the Heptagram should be united in the same Talisman, theextremities of the angles coinciding. The Endelcangle is attributed to theQlippoth, the Dodekangle to Zodiacal Forces in Malta& Kether has thePrimum Moble, Chokmah the Sphere of the Zodiac in command, andMallaith, that of the Elements. And many other meanings are boundtogether in the Lineal figures besides those which are given in this book. Two or more lineal figures may be boundtogether in the same Talisman.The Triangle is the only lineal figure into which all surfaces can be reduced, for every Polygon can be dividedinto triangles by drawing lines from its angles to its centre; and the triangle is the first and simplest of all lineal figures,It refers to the Triad operating in all things, to the Three Supernal Sephiroth and to Binah, the Third Sephirah, inparticular. Among the Planets it is especially referied to Saturn and among the Elements to Fire, and, as the colour ofSaturn is black, and that of Fire Red, the black Triangle will represent Saturn, and the red, Fire. The Three Anglesalso symbolise the Three Alchemical principles ofnatuie: Salt, Sylph ir and Mercury.The Square is the most important lineal figure, which naturally represents stability and equafion It includes theidea of surface and superficial measurement. It represents to the Quaternary in all things, and to the Tetrad the Holyname of YHVH operating through the Four Elements of Fire, Water, Air and Earth It is allotted to Chased, the_ Fourth Sephirah, and among the Planets to Jupiter. And as representing the Four Elements, it represents theirultimation in Material Form.The Pentangle can be traced in two ways: reflected from every second point, when it is called the Pentagon,and reflected mm every third point when it is called the Pentagram. The Pentangle as a whole is referred to the FniliSephirah, Geburah. The Pentagon naturally represents the power of the Pentad, operating in Nature by the dispersalofthe Spirit and the four Elements through it. The Pentagram with a single point upwards is called the \"Sign of the269"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Microcosm\" and is a good symbol, representing a man with his anus and legs extended adoring his Creator, andespecially the dominion of the Spirit over the four Elements, and consequently of reason over matter.

The Head of the Goat, or Demon's Head, representing the abasement of reasonbeneath the blind forces of matter, the elevation of anarchy above order, and of conflicting forces driven by chanceabove God. It represents the concentrated force ofthe Spirit and the Four Elements governed by the five letters oftheName of the Restorer of all things YHSHVH, and it is especially attributed to the Planet Mars. It also shows theICerubirn and the Wheel ofthe Spirit. It is a symbol oftâºemendous force, and ofHEH the letter ofthe Great SupernalMother AIMAThe Hexangle can be traced in two ways as a complete symbol:viz, reflected from every second point, when itis called a Hexagon, and reflected from every 3rd point when it is called a Hexagram. The Hexangle as a whole isreferred to the 6th Sephirah Tiphareth The Hexangle naturally represents the powers of the Hexed operating inNature, by the dispersal ofthe rays ofthePlanets, and ofthe Zodiac emanating from the Sun. The number of degrees ofa great circle cut off between its anglesis sixty, forming the astrological senile, powerful for good. It is not so consonant to the Sun nature as the Hexagram,and remember Thou, that the 'Con signifieth dispersion, distribution, and radiation of a force; but the 'Gramconcentration Hence Thou use the 'Gan for spreading, and the 'Gram for concentration and sealing, and when thereis need, Thou canst compare, interpose and combine them; but the `Gon initiateth the whirlThe Hexagram with a single point uppermost is called the Sign of the Macrocosm or greater world, becauseits six angles fitly represents the six days or periods of Creation evolved from the manifestation of the Triune, whileits synthesis forms the Seventh Day, a period of rest, summed up in the Hexagonal centre. It represents especially theconcentrated force ofthe Planets, acting through the Signs ofthe Zodiac, and thus sealing the Astral image of natureunder the presidency of the Sephiroth, and also the Seven palaces ofthe same. It is especially attributed to the Sun. Itis a symbol of great strength and power, forming with the Cross and the Pentagram, a triad of potent and goodsymbols, which are in harmony with each other.The Heptangle as a whole is referred to the 7th Sephirah, Netzach. The Heptagon naturally represents thedispersal of the powers of the Seven Planets through the week, and through the year. It alludes to the power of theSeptenary acting through all things, as exemplified by the seven colours of the tainbow. The Heptagram reflectedfrom every 3rd point yieldeth 7 triangles at the apexes thereof fitly representing the Triad operating in each planet,and the planets themselves in the week and the year. The Heptagram is the Star of Venus and it is especiallyapplicable to her nature. And as the Heptagram is the lineal figure of the Seven Planets, so is Venus as it were theirGate or Entrance, the fitting symbol ofthe Isis ofNature and the Seven Lower Sephiroth ofthe Bride.The Octangle as a whole is Peened to the Eight Sephirah, Hod. The Octangle naturally represents the powerofthe Ogdoad, and the Octagon showeth the Ogdoad operating in Nature by thedispersal of the rays of the Elements in their (Insl aspect under the presidency of the 8 letters of the Name. TheOctagram reflected from every 3rd point yielded 8 triangles at the apices thereof fitly representing the Triad operatingin each element in its dual form, ie., ofPositive and Negative, under the powers ofthe name YHVH ADONAI or asit is written bound together IAHDONHL This Octagram reflected from every fourth point is the Star of Memury,and is especially applicable to his nature. It is further a potent symbol, representing the binding together of theconcentrated Positive and Negative Forces of the Elements under the name of IAHDONHI And forget not thatADONAI is the key ofHYVH.The Enneangle as a whole is referred to the 9th Sephirah of Yesod. It naturally representeth the power of theEnnead, and the Enneagon showeth the Ennead operating in Name by the dispersalof the rays of the seven planets and the Head and Tail, of the Dragon of the Moon. The Enneagram reflected fromevery 3rd point represearteth Triple Ternary ofthe operating both in the 7 Planets with the Caput and Canada Draconisof the Moon, with the Alchemical principles counterchanged and interwoven. It is not so consonant with the natureof Luna as the Enneagram reflected from every 5th point. The Enneagram is the Star of Luna and is especiallyapplicable to her nature. It represents her as the Administratrix to the Earth of the virtues of the Solar system underthe Sephiroth The Enneagram reflected from every 4th point is composed of three triangles united within a circle,and alludes to the Triple Teneray of the Three Alchemical Principles themselves. It is not so consonant with thenature ofLuna as the next form.270"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The DeIcangle as a whole is referred to the Tenth Sephirah-Mallcuth. The Delcangle naturally represents thepower ofthe Dekad, and the Dekangle showeth the Dekad operating in nature by the dispersal ofthe rays ofthe 10thSephiroth therein. The number of degrees of a Great Circle cut off between its angles is 36, the half of the Quintileastrological aspect. The Dekagram reflected from every third point is especially consonant with Mallard], and showsthe Triad operating through the angle ofthe two Pentagrams within a circle, ofwhich is it composed. It alludes to thecombination of the three Alchemical Principles with the Spirit and the Four Elements in their positive and negativeform, under the Presidency ofthe ten Sephiroth themselves.The Dekagram reflected from every 5th point is composed of two Pentagrams within a circle. It shows theoperation ofthe duplicated HEH ofthe TETRAGRAMMATON, and the concentation ofthe positive and negativeforces of the Spirit and of the Four Elements under the Presidency of the potencies of the Five in Binah; therevolutions ofthe Forces under Aimah the Great Mother.The Endelcagram as a general rule is referred to the Qlippoth: of its forms however, the one reflected fromevery fourth point represents their restriction, and therefore it is not altogether to be classed with those that representtheir operations in Nature. The Endekangle naturally represents the evil and imperfect nature ofthe Endekad, and theEndelcagon represents the dispersal ofthe Eleven Curses ofMount Ebal through the Universe (Dart 'mit) using theHebrew system of numberingThe Dodekangle as a general Jule is referred to the Zodiac, and naturally represents the power of theDodekad. The Dodekagon shows the dispersal of the influences of the Zodiac through nature, the Dodelcagram itsconcentration.

It was this book plus Westcott'sbook on Alchemy that the Theoricus was advised to read and study and this was once again taken from the work ofItoserroth's \"Kabbala.h Denudata\". Eventually there was so much confusion about this Table of AlchemicalCorrespondences that a number of Golden Dawn Temples (including Waite's) wrote their own private papers on it.271"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The two diagrams show two stages ofthe work hence the conflicting associations to it When we questioned Tayloron this he said:\"There is no doubt that Mathers or Westcott were trying to show the alchemical dexterity asapplied to the Tree is not that of a rigid system to adhere to.

These associations are worth persevering with for they show forththe Geomantic figures arranged according to the Signs of the Zodiac and the Elements with Cauda and Caput272"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Draconis being associated to Fire and Earth respectively.Students are often inclined to set aside Geomancy as a thing of little use and small account, a fantastic andempiric mode ofdivination, merely a species ofultra elaborate tossing up, pure chance in fact, laboriously interpretedThe reasons seems to be that in all books and manuscripts dealing with Geomancy no elementary explanation of it isever vouchsafed. This the student is assumed to know, and is given straight away a rule for the erection of figures andelaborate lists ofnames and sigls and Genii until he naturally finds himself bored or wearied.It is to supply this lack Mat this paper is written in the hope that some students may find therein what they havebeen ladcing. First then as to the word itself All words ending in the termination of \"mancy\" refer to some form ofprophesying from Mantis, a prophet. By this I mean not necessarily in fortune telling, though this too may beincluded, but rather the setting forth ofthe tings that are behind the Val of Matter. All inspired utterances, in a senseof great poems, are prophesying. The priest is the commissioned executant, and as such is subordinate to theprophet. Now the prophet takes some material manifestation, and at this point lifts a corner of the Veil, disclosing,under the appearance of some material token, the essential Divine truth laying behind Thus Cheiromancy isprophesying from the hand. Necromancy (which is Black Magic) is prophesying from the corpse (a method favourwith Roman Augurs who used the bodies of sacrificial victims).Geomancy fiom \"Gaia\" the earth, is prophesying from the earth itself We have than to consider how the veilthat hides while manifests the mysteries of creation is lifted to the gaze of the inspired Seer. For this is the Veil of Isis,-the penetration ofwhich was the goal and object ofthe Egyptian Seers.As above, so below, was the arcanum of the Emerald Tablet ofHennes. We are taught that the eternal ideas of Godare revealed as in a picture book by the starry sphere to the eyes of those who can see, and the starry sphere isreflected in the Earth, so that every spot is the reflection of some constellation or Star Group, and over these wanderthe planets hi their order. Pour great Archangels keep watch and ward over the four quarters. From this knowledgewe may see the reason for the characteristics of countries, towns, places persisting quite independently ofthe race thatinhabits them.We can see why that it ever M. Rome is the imperial Spirit of domination and material power, whether it wasinhabited at first by the outcasts and broken men from every race, the great \"Asyltun\" as it was called, or afterwards ahomogeneous Republic, then an Empire with world dominion, then a heirachy with a well nigh universal spiritualdomination, but always the same spirit Or why again, the various races that have come to China have one and allbecome ultra Chinese. In every case the spirit ofthe place is strong enough to dominate all who come in. Or in othercases to produce its own effect. Thus we may perhaps say that all the forces behind the Veil shine through and can beperceived. If the prophet can catch and translate these he can give information of high value to his bretiren.-Obviously to do this he must entirely sink and obliterate his own personality, for his intellect can only perceive andreason about this side ofthe Val While his attention is fixed on this he is necessarily blind to the indications of whatlies beyond.Letus look for a moment at some other terminations. \"Nomy\" signifies laws-as Astronomy is the law of thisstarry universe. That is to say (for we can really know nothing of the laws governing this great universe) themethodical synthesis of observation.\"Ology\" is the \"word\"- the divine messenger drawn from the manifestation - thus Astrology is the messagedrawn from the stars, the discourse concerning them, as shown by the science of Astronomy. But to the Earth, wehave geology, which signifies the discourse concerning the Earth though as yet this discourse concerns merely theÂage of the Earth, and the kind of creatures that inhabited it thousand of centuries ago, and the changes that havepassed over its surface. There is also Geometry or the measurement ofthe Earth which is a more subtle science, for itconcerns itselfwith abstract numbers and figures.Now at the outset of Geomancy, as set forth it books and manuscripts we are confronted with the lists andnames of the Rulers, Genii, Angels and Intelligences, which have no apparent reason, and with seemingly arbitraryfigures called Sighs. The learning of these to some is a weariness and seems profitless. But let the student then lookon than as the names of personalities with whom he will become acquainted. You lmow, for example that yourfrield's name is John or David; your enemy's name may be Hans or Kari The mention of these names at once bringsto your mind the idea of that personality. We could not discuss these friendly or hostile ideas without using thesenames. We do not know why our fiend was christened John, but we accept the fact, and just so we regard the Sig%as we do letters of the Alphabet. We do not know why the letter T has the particular power that it has, but if we273"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"wish to communicate to another in writing the idea denoted by `John' we employ it, and the children must begin tolearn the alphabet before they can begin to read.Now as to he mechanical method employed by the geomantic diviner. As we have seen he must entirelysubordinate his own personality, his reason, his intellect, his human will. he must become completely passive. Wehave all heard of the process of Automatic Writing where the Seer, as medium, allows his hand to be used by somesuper:Furman or subhuman intelligence, that messages may be written through him without his will, often without hisconsciousness. But herein it is odremely dial* to eniirely withdraw the will so that the message is not coloured, oreven transmuted, or at least modified by his own brain. The Geomantic method of making a series of dots or strokeson paper without counting ensures as Er as it is possible that the intellect has no part therein. What it is thatdetermines whether the number be odd or even? The answer is dear, it is ihythm. Consider then any four lined verse,with alternate feminine and masculine endings. The rhythm of this will give the Geomantic figure of two dots, onedot, two dots, one dot.When the brain is entire quiescent, the message from behind the veil ofphysical matter may be perceived in theform of rhythm, not consciously indeed, but affecting the nerves and pulses, affecting the hand. A tune we may say,dances through the body, the rhythm of it manifests in the strokes unconsciously made. Whence then comes thistune? The stany sky is the reflex of God's thought of Himself the Earth is the reflex of the firmament, the aura ofman is a reflex ofthe Earth. The rhythm ofthe tune then manifests the idea behind the val. The geomantic figures setsdown in geometric form the rhythm ofthe tune and consequently the idea.Let us now consider what we mean by an idea Old John Heydon, the most profound writer in geomancy,defines the idea as an invisible created spirit. This may be more comprehensible if we imagine any manifest object, aman, flower, tree or what you will.. Take a sum of all the attributes you know of that object, and then make up theideal presentment in the ideal thereof It is invisible, but it is them. So we may say a sculptor has an idea of his statuebefore he has made the roughest sketch. And a genius he defines as a certain divine spirit that worloth secret things hinature miraculously. So that, he says, there is no great difference between a Genius and a Divine idea.Now as you stand on a definite spot on the Earth's surface and ask a question, the answer is there, involved inyour question, ifyou can but get at it. The question and answer are both the divine idea, and the idea is manifested bythe rhythmic movement, the tune, that your spirit catches from behind the val.Take then for example a stanza with alternate feminine and masculine endings. Broadly speaking the effect isedslarating. It goes into a dance rhythm, it is Ell of hope and joy, it tells of the gaining of something desired, and thegeomantic figure we have fanned is thus:and we learn to call it \"Aquisivo\". We are further taught to make a talismatic figure by joining the dots we have thusset down thus:274"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"This seems at first sight a purely empiric and practically useless thing. But let us look at it in another way. Wewish to receive the information we desire, and a natural method is to hold out some receptacle. Our appropriate-symbol is a cup to receive the wine of divine grace, and a cup is the natural, symbol of\"Aquisito\". The spiritual gift isbehind the veil The material reflex of it is the gift of what we desire on earth. Two cups therefore appropriatelysymbolise the answer to our question. Now as in Egypt, the picture writing gradually gradually conventualised into-hieroglyphics, so the representation of the two cups may become the hieroglyphic symbol, the dots and angles of`Acquisitio'. These indicate a rhythm that has come from behind the veil, bearing to answer to our query.We now have to consider that every point on the surface ofthe Earth has its own ocailt forces, which are heremanifested. To a certain extent this will be generally admitted. We know there are sacred places, often in the old daysmarked with stone circles, and that the influence &than is so strong that in spite &themselves, succeeding races anddifferent peoples will involuntarily build their sacred shrines in the same spots. Many believe that ill-luck invariably-follows the profaning of such sites. It is commonly said that about certain places there is a special influence for goodor evil, which any sensitive person who comes can feel. If this is true of certain places it would seen to follow thatevery place has its special influence and occult forces, which can be there manifested. But the forces that manifest inany place are not fixed an invariable.Imagine then that you stand on a point of the earth's surface and your mind is troubled with some questionand intuition comes to you to seek the solution behind the veil. You are feeling in your mind the Divine influenceruling that particular spot, and unconsciously it maybe. so. You know that it holds within it the answer could you butget at it. Perhaps consider no ordinary method of divination, but there comes to you a feeling of hope and joy, of-exhilaration, a certain sense that all will be well Your inner being has caught the rhythm that promises success. Herethen Geomancy enables you to set down the rhythm in black and white, and to interpret in detail. But it does morethan this. To the vague sense that has permeated your inner being there is much risk of delusion. It is impossible to-exclude the material personality, the outer side of the veil. Modes of ediaration or depression may come fromphysical en Keg. Geomancy, as we have seen, excludes, so flr as possible, the personality, the working ofthe material brain and-enables you to catch the rhythm, wherein is the answer to your question. So you ask whether you shall obtainsomething eagerly desired, and the rhythm sings to the idea ofAcquisitio and you set down the geomantic figure, andthere appears to you the hieroglyph of the Cups and you know that you hold forth the material cup, and behind theveil the spiritual cup is held forth to receive the wine of blessing And now there must be some name by which youshall call that divine spirit which you have perceived, you are taught to give it the name offismael.Take this as you wish to be a purely fancy name. While it is the name you are to know, think ofthat spirit andyou know so far that it is a genial generous spirit that gives you what you desire and as such you recognise this spiritas the ruler of the idea of \"Aqisitio\". You learn also the sigil of HasmaeL You do not know the meaning of this, orwhy it is employed Perhaps you never will. It is not very important. You will never probably know the origin of theletter \"J\", but this does not prevent you knowing that 'I\" is the initial of John, the name of you friend. To help in theknowledge and recognition of the geomantic figures, the old books give various characteristics enscnbing HasmaeLFor instance, as noble and generous and affable; a genial and handsome man, laughter loving, a great lover andforgiver. Descriptions are also given ofthe places he most frequents.Fruits, plants, and trees are so especially favoured by him, precious stones, animals, birds and fishes consonantto his nature, etc., but the student need not be concerned with those at present. They belong to more advanced partsof the subject. the Chief points to note are that we have seen the lines or strokes he makes are not haphazard and .meaningless but reveal to him a certain rhythm and that rhythm is an expression of an idea. The idea is to answer to275"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"the question shown him by the ruler whose name and sigil also he knows somewhat of his character.Having grasped this much there will be less difficulty in comprehending the meaning of the Genii, Angels,Archangels, etc. We see then how we get a certain result with one figure resulting firm four lines of strokes. Butthere are four quarters of the World and Four Elements. We must inquire four times if we would have a reliableanswer. So it is necessary to make 16 lines of strokes resulting in four figures. But the principle of all is the same. Wehave discovered here only `Acquisitio'. Further comments must be reserved for a later lecture.SYMBOLISM OF THE OPENINGThe actual ground plan of the Temple floor is the one dimensional diagram ofthe Admission Badge which iscarried in by the Candidate just after the Opening part ofthe ceremony is completed. In our Whare Ra copy, and alsoone GoldenDawn original that we have seen, the Cubical Cross is done the following way.The Candidate waits in the ante chamber under the guidance of the Seminal, as Anubis. The symbolical lightwhich he will show the candidate through to is placed just beyond the Door and is a symbol ofthe eternal flame ofthetrue Soul that the candidate is trying to aspire to.The first knock activates the second phase of the opening. The first phase is in the meditation and Godformcreation eremites initiated by the Hierophant actually starts the ceremony. The first knock in fitct is the first part ofthejoining of the Ruach and the Neshamah of the Hierophant, who \"connects\" with the Ruach of the Order. ThisElemental grade differs from the other Grades in the sense that the 1-lierophant is already seated in from of the AirTablet. During temple meditation before the opening, the Hierophant always links with the Tablet before theceremony starts. By 'linking', I mean that the Area ofthe Ifierophant unites with that ofthe tablet, through the effortof Will by the Hierophant.The Hterophant will do this a number of ways. Taylor worked with me on two of these. The first is to thesimple use of an invocation which the Elemental Kings ofthe Tablets were petitioned directly0 Thou great, mighty, and powerful angel of the immortal God BATIVAH, who all by theprime decree of the Highest, ordained and constituted and appointed, and see over the terrestrialangle ofthe North, as the only King, governor and overseerer, Principal Watchman Protector, andKeeper thereof fi-om malice, misuse or i b minn, temptation...This is a basic start of an invocation that can be applied to all the tablets by just changing the names to suitSome may prefer to use their own I used this method fora while, but gradually opted for the second method. Oncethe temple was set up, the Hierophant would then enter the Hall and meditate in front of the Air tablet. Using theEtheric Body, the Hierophant will then link directly into the energy of the tablet itself and can draw on it even beforethe ceremony starts. This is the more difficult method and it requires an ability to know how to use your lower subtlebodies at will I would point out that when I did this as 1-fterophant, I always used the Godfonn of Osiris to bring thisthrough before I would attempt it with the tablets, this creates a buffer between you and the tablet itself if anythinggoes wrong. No invocations are used here, just a dear direct application or 0,11 in the right direction.The first knock in fort re-enforces this link and brings forth onto the temple floor, to the Altar a fresh current oflight through the power of the Godibmi Socharis, who hi turn activates all the &dorms on a vertical line beneaththe 1-lierophant, most particularly the Godfoim of Osiris, who now is the Godform that the Hierophant assumes onthe floor when he is not on the Dais.The first action of the Kenix is to see to the door, the entrance-way to the Portal of the Hai Taking theGodform ofKephera (through the energy of Sliu), he crosses the vertical current established by the Hierophant as hegoes with Sol (docicwise) to the door, which has a letter Tau inscribed upon it, on which he knocks. This establishesa full cycle ofthe previous grade has now gone through, shown by his movement away from his station in the Northtowards the path of Tau which he now draws attention to and prepares an entranceway for. With the instigation ofthe Hierophant, the Hiereus as Toum, calls for the Grade Signs to be given. Once this is done, it now seals the rmk ofall the stations and more importantly re-enforces the Portal through the strength ofthe Sign of the Great God Atlas,and also the Sign cfNu who is stationed at the East.Now in the next round of questions and answer a great deal occurs on the Astral level When the Hierophantasks the Hegemon what Grade does this represent he or she then replies \"To the Element of Air\". A ray is then sent276"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"forth to this Officers Godfomi who handles the Elemental aspect ofthe ceremony. The same proceedure then occursto the Iliereus for they both now work on two distinct levels. When The Hegemon mentions the Path of Tau, a thirdlevel is then produced, and by analogy is much the same way as peeling layers off an onion. On the explanation ofwhat the Path of Tau alludes to, the Hlerophant sends a stream of light to the 21st Tarot Key of the Universe on theAltar. The knock then given by the Hierophant concentrates his and the other energies of the Godfomis directly onthe Current of Air which is thither enhanced by the use of the Ifterophants sceptre who traces a circle in front of thethe Air Tablet.With the name SHADDAI EL CHAI, the passive aspect of AIR is then brought into the ceremony, so thatboth the Path of Tau and its point of origin in Yesod, is then invoked but through the influence of YOD HEH VAUHEH which centralises its force and focuses it to the ritual. The formation of the Triad in font of the Air Tablet ismainly two fold. The invoking ofthe both the Active and Passive Pentagrams both links the Element to the ceremony-and controls through the passive nature ofthe Godfomis the Officers represent.On a purely practical level this is also a safeguard to spread the load if the Ilierophant cannot handle theenergies he or she is invoking.With utterance ofthe \"Let us make ADAM in our own image, after our Maness, and let them have dominionover the Fowl of the Air.\" seems to us very much like the God making man in his image and man returning thecomplement. However it represents both the Macrocosm and Microcosm relating to Elemental aspects ofAir. It is at-this point that the Astral fonns ofthe Officers then expand and link to that same vibration the ritual is in in the Astral.The contact is made through the station of the Archangel Raphael, who stands behind the Tablet of Air andwho is commanded by the Pentagrams, who in Mathers own words \"blindeth him with their Brilliance\" at this pointin the rituaL The Sign of Aquarius made before the Air Tablet then brings and empathy with the Kerub of Air, whostands behind the Tablet of Air but in front ofthe Archangel Raphael. The cross then establishes an empathy with thehierachy ofthe Tablet ofAir through the anent of the Great Angel AVE. It is only at this time that the Air Tablet isaddressed and not the forces behind it. This is done through merely holding up the Pentacle in front of the Tablet ofAir. The use of the Pentacle shows that while this is the Element of Air we are on the Path of Tau which representsboth the Earth and Saturn and therefore the Air Element has to be contacted through the reflection of the EarthElement, the Pentacle.With the words ORO IBAH AZOPHI and BATAVIAH two currents from the tablet are initiated. The Firstis to connect or link the Hierophant directly with the Tablet (on the Astral level) and formulate a bridge to bring theother forces of the Tablet thorugh. The second is for BATAVIAH to re-enforce the Elemental aspect, through aplanetary .power which helps speed up the process of linking with the Hierophant and the ritual itself The ThreeSecret Names of the Tablet also effect the Aura of the Candidate through the following Zodiac aspect of HouseDivisionORO:11th House.This effects the attitude of the candidate towards others and is very prominent in helping the candidate adjustto fleeting perceptions or different levels ofawareness that he or she will start to perceive after this ceremony.1BAH: 12th House.Here we have a certain amount of secretiveness effecting the candidate as he or she is made aware of hisresponsibilities within the Order. Also at this point some people become aware of their karmic ties and try eitherconsciously to work in straightening them out.AZOPLlst House.Two Emdamental things are accomplished here and that is that a possible life direction is changed due toexposure to this Godfonn, one that will try and melee the candidate walk the path he has chosen The next is thephysical well being ofthe candidate which should also take a tum for the better.The candidate has already been exposed to the 2nd, 3rd and 4th houses in the previous grade and with the thethree from this grade gradually, with the help ofthe power ofthe tablets tries to improve over these areas of his or herlife as he progresses through the Grades.The Three sets oflmocks in fact are the number ofthe Sepherah of Yesod and its influences.277"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"ADVANCEMENT ON THE 32ND PATH OF TAUThe knock given by the Hierophart sends a ray of light to the Tablet of the North for the Path of Tau, as aPath of Earth still is strengthened by the Earth Tablet which in effect opens up the Energy of the Path. Thedispensation he =ounces is from those Officers that am present on the Dais. Their function during the ceremony isthe same as the Neophyte Grade and need not be repeated here with different Godfonns performing the tasks (seeZ5, The Neophyte Ceremony of the Golden Dawn). Basically though The Praemonstrator governs the power ofthespeeches during the ritual and helps direct and motivate the candidate. The Imperator, if present, helps the lierophantand helps stabilise the power coming through the Altar and the very outer reaches ofthe temple itselfthnough helpingall the Godforms bring their energy through at the correct time, and also to protect the Rauch of the Candidate fromany negative influence. The Cancellarius must be the one to judge the Candidate and make sure that he is worthy toreceive the power ofthe Grade.The taking of of the Fan, Lamp, Cup and Salt from the Altar is analogous to placing the various componentsof the Ruach of the Candidate under the influence of the Four Children of Horns who guard it during the ritual It isthese parts that the Candidate will stop in from of as more is revealed to him at each level when he or she goesthrough the circumambulation It is my opinion that in fact we not only look at the spiritual side of this movement butthe auric side as well.M this juncture, the Hegemon then is commanded by the ffierophant to admit the Candidate. This can be avery tricky part of the ceremony for the Hegemon has to broach the Portal of the Hall and bring the Candidatethrough without any energy disruption. It is here that the shell of Imperator is called upon for this officer controls thelimits ofthe Portal The Sentinal outside has now readied the Candidate and given him or for the Hegemon (though itis not always written in the ceremonies, every grade ritual had a Sentinal). On entrance to the Hall the Hegemonutters: \"QUIT THE MATERIAL AND SEEK THE SPIRITUAL\". This is a very important part of the ceremonyand quoting from Taylor's discussion with us on this point\"On entering the Hall the Hegemon the Hegemon gives her speech and at that point theRuach of the Candidate, placed hi the cardinal points in the Hall, then begins to pulsate. Fe kintaught that a Simulacnan of the the Candidate or Higher Self is then placed in the Northern part ofthe Hall in front ofthe Earth Tablet and guarded by Nephthys, who fonns a protective shell aroundit It was only after the 6 = 5 when I started to learn about the new dimensions ofthe teachings ofthe auric bodies that I understood what he meant by this. What happens is that the Astral orEmotional body ofthe Postulant separates from the physical at the command ofthe Hegemon. Thisis distinct from the Soul of the Kabbbalists and it is then drawn and held also by the Earth Tabletwhich feeds the station ofNeplithys as he passes over it when going towards the Pillars in the East,because it is linked to the former Grade ofZelator he has gone though. The Astral/Emotional bodyofthe Postulant is now anchored to that spot and he must eventualy reach it again through trial andtabulations of the circumambulations of the Hall, to be unified with it. Both he and the Astral/Emotional body have been bombarded with energy so each is in effect stronger than before underthe guidance of the Fierophant Nancy (Nancy Hobson fanner Late Chief of Whare Ra) used tointellectualise this point too much and usually had the Hegemon a mass of nerves. When I waslierophant I used to drill them in feeling what went on which is the way I taught you and Chris, butstill do not neglect the theory ofwhat goes on for you have to feel it first\"(Note: With that statement Taylor would then spin around abruptly in his wheel chair leaving his words achance to sink in. He had a habit of when discussing any part of the Golden Dawn ritual of transporting you to theplace so that you could visualise what was happening to such an extent it seemed very real. His ability to do this wassimply amazing and we have not met any other individual who could do this to Taylor's level). On being led to theIlerophants Throne the Hfferophant, as Osiris, takes the Cross from the Candidate and has the significance ofsurtendering himselfto Osiris who then checks him or her out on knowing the correct step, Sign and Word etc. Withthe swearing of the Oath through the framework of the Cubical Cross, the ground plan of the Temple for the 32Path, The Ifierophant injects the link to the Path through the Power of Osiris. The Zelator, in his form of Salem, thentakes charge ofthe Candidate for his Station is also in from ofthe Earth Tablet278"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"At this point the Kenn( now assumes the function ofAnubis the Guardian though still in the form of Satem forthis form is the end of the Journey of the Candidate and must be evetpresent with him as a gi Ming light. While it isnow evident that one is going on a Solar journey by the Banner of the East and the Cubical Cross, both Solarsymbols. After one circumambultion of the Hall the Candiate is stopped by the Hierophant (at this juncture theCandidate is not turned in towards the Throne but is stopped in mid stride by the Banner of the West, and the Fan,subliminal symbols of life and death which are held by the Herophant. The use of the symbology of the Sphinx alsoshould be considered, for the Sphinx representing the Four Elements synthesized shows the various Elementaldivisions of the Zodiac.279"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Now are told that the Priest with the mask of Osiris Spake. Most have assumed that the Temple Officersdonned special Masks but this referred to Godfam each ofthe Temple Officers had assumed. I have been assured byone informant that at least one Golden Dawn Temple did actually use a mask (done at this temples discretion) but forpractical reasons it was not used in others. This was mainly due to the fact of the switching back and forth ofGodforms done by the Hierophant who is Socharis on the Dais and Osiris on the floor and the Kerux being bothSateen and Nephthys. Taking of a mask while wearing an Egyptian Headress does have its problems though tohonest for dramatic effect it is very effective. On discussing the problems ofthe masks with Taylor he said:\"You are not there to scare the living daylights out of a person who would probably either runout of the Hall or burst out laughing at someone wearing the mask of Osiris. Your function is tomanipulate the auric body with magnetic charges. We are magicians and not on stage, and wearenough eloborate regalia as it is. Ifyou cannot faun the Godfomi around you and project its energyat the Candidate without wearing a mask then you have no job being a ilierophant or a TempleThe reasons for the inclusions of the masks though were mainly be/muse they were inhaled in the GoldenDawn Cipher manuscripts.While the Hierophant reveals himself as Osiris he questions the Candidate, answered by the Kenn( as to whatforces he represents which are the Godfonns of Nu and Hormaku who stand behind him and are not immediatelyvisible. The Kelm then replies, still on behalf of the lierophant, that he comes in the name of the Letter Aleph. Thisin fact relates to the Sepher Yeizirah or Book of Formation where we are told the Universe was created through theThee Mother letters with Aleph, reigning over Air, being the first. The Sign ofAquarius is then given with the Fan bythe Hierophant which is to represent the Holy Spirit, as the face of the Sun, instilling the breath of life in the Aura ofthe Candidate, his fast major awakening in this ritual.The liereus, as Isis once again, reads for the Candidate but takes the part of Osiris. This appears complex atfirst glance with what appears to be an apparent switching of parts mainly due to the Ciphers. Mailers however,when he constructed the rituals considered that the gateway and brining at the East was too limited to understandwhat this was about and utilised an entire circumambulation of the Temple or one full cycle to experience theconcept of Osiris and what had just transpired. This was done by the Hier us assuming the part and fimction of theKA or the Ego ofthe Godfonn and reading out and hi fact guiding the Soul to be reunified as was done to Osiris.The Thenricus ritual is hi fact the first that really deals with the Egyptian Soul and the Kabbalistic Soultogether. Taylor informed us that lectures on the Egyptian part of the Soul and its function in ritual were held atWham Ra and also in the Golden Dawn (according to his teacher) though there were some notes taken no paperswere ever handed out on the subject.For the next lot of cir umambulations the Helms takes the part of the KA ofHorus as Ra when they stop onthe South. Isis, through aka, when they are stopped in the West, and Nephthys, through Sateen, as they are stoppedin the North. Here the Higher Forms of the Gods which persided over the Candidate in the two previous Rituals stillnow protect him while he walks the Path of Earth and introduce him to other energies. Now at each of these fourstations that the candidate stops at he is then given back part ofthe Ruach that was separated from him at the start ofthe ceremony. By the time the last dramiambulation is completed, after the purification in the North, so that part ofhim is now much more reachable and stronger than before. This is also acknowledged by the fact of the Kew(replacing the Fan, Lamp, Cup and Salt to the central Altar.Ifthe actions ofthe candidate and the speeches are closely studied at this point, you will find that the candidateactually is being introduced to the energies hi the 21st Tarot Key ofthe Universe. To understand this properly we goback to the energy of the Admission badge ofthis path on the temple floor, the Cubical Cross. Unfolded there is yetanother energy pattern and that is same as the 21st Key. Now as the Candidate is walked through this pattern theaura on the floor connects with that of the Candidate on the Etheric level. The invisible Anubis takes the Candidatefast to the Sphinx, which relates to the figure of the 21st Key being in a central position to the Elements, or placed ina balanced manner to them. After this the Candidate is then taken around to each of the &rubs, as shown on thecorners of the 21st Key then brought back to the three elements at the centre of the folded out Admission Badge,which relates to the figures in yet another manner.The Astral body is held in check between the Pillarslylsle this is going on, the Etheric Body is the one which isbeing directly manipulated on. In his `Inner T ifp, Voll' Leadbeater makes the following comment about the Etheric280"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Body\"As the consciousness of the ordinary man cannot normally use atomic matter, either physicalor astral, there is normally of no possibility of conscious communication between the two planes.As, however, he purifies his velficles(subtle bodies P.Z.), he becomes able to function hi the atomicmatter and then is able to fimction hi the atomic matter and is then able to carry his consciousnessalong the direct mad from one atomic level to another. hi this case the atomic web fially retains itsposition and activity, permitting the consciousness to pass from one plane to another , while at thesame time Miffing its purpose ofpreventing close contact with those lower sub-planes (Qlippoth P.Z) firm which many kinds ofundesirable influences is liable to come.\"The scenario is that the energy of the candidate has to be balanced, for that is the Key word in this ritual. Iwould stress here the multi-layered fonns of meanings attached to what is happening to the Candidate and to Illyappreciate this one must be aware of subtle anatomy. I suggest that the readers study the works of AE.Powell andDavid Tansley so that an appreciation ofthese energies and their effect in ritual can be considered.The Candidate is then read out the explanation ofthe Cubical Cross, which is the Zodiac wheel, with the fourcardinal points having planets beside them, as discussed hi an earlier chapter. The candidate then goes to the West ofthe Altar where the speech concerning the symbolism ofthe 21st Tarot Trump Universe is then read out. This card isnot the size of the standard one and is quite large, measuring at least Two feet in width and over thirty inches inHeight so that it is very prominent. A very close inspection of the symbolism of both Cubical Cross and the Trump`Universe' will show that as far as symbolism goes they are identical The Universe simply takes he formula to anarchetype concept. The Symbol of the Moon and Venus in the central portion of the Cubical Cross also appear inTrump above and below here with the figure representing the Elemental forces, and the planets representing theKerubic Forces, placed in each corner ofthe Trump.The version ofthe Trump 'Universe' given in the ritual itself differs from the Wang version mainly because thisis the original Golden Dawn version where the Wangversion was altered by members of the Bristol-HermesTemple. We could not help but notice in the CompleteGolden System of Magic that Regardie's copy of the tarottrumps had the new version of the Universe where ourWham Ra pack had the original. The important differencebetween this trump and the Wang version is that the 7rayed Star is drawn over the figure, not under it Ourassumption is that the Seven Rayed Star was placed underthe feet of the dancing figure because someone in theBristol-Hennes Temple considered that the 7 palaces ofAssiah related to the Qlippoth and as such should be 7underfoot or underconirol working on a similar principle tothe drawing ofthe Vault floor(m the 5 = 6 ritual) floor.The original drawing however shows somethingmore for it not only goes Assiah have 7 Palaces it has 7Hells as well. There have been numerous debateableassumptions of either the Heavens or the Hells both beingclassed as a Palace within the Golden Dawn with the 7planets have also been classed as Assiah as well asYetzitah.One thing though that does stand out here with thisdrawing and that is the planetary/chakra fink and it is a verysubtle one. Along with the Tattwas this was the onlyEastern concept linked to the Kabbalah but this may havebeen done inadvertantly as some early Rosictuciartdocuments have shown the planetary link to the subtlebody centres and we believe were done independent of281"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Eastern Philosophy. There are a number ofworks ofLulley, Fludd and Boheme that certainly have some similarity tothe original version ofthe Universe.We now come to a part ofthe ceremony that as left out ofthe rituals originally published by Regardie throughAires Press because of the tampering by the Chiefs at his former temple Bristol-Hermes. Since this was a StellaMatutina temple it was the erroneous assumption that all temples did likewise however this did not occur at WhereRa temple in New Zealand as the ritual shown in the first portion of the book will confirm hi Regardies latestpublication of the Golden Dawn Rituals (The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic) the positioning of thesediagrams are omitted for some reason though the text is identical with the Wham Reversion.The diagram placing of the Flaming Sword which appears at the base of the Altar in the first ReganiiePublication ofthe first part ofthe 2 = 9 ceremony and in a identical setting in the Complete Golden Dawn System ofMagic does not appear on our copy nor on another Golden Dawn original copy that I have seen. Since this is notexplained until the second part ofthe ceremony we can see no reason for it being there and it looks like the editors ofthe Complete Golden Dawn System of magic copied it from the Aires Pressliewerlyns Publications edition withoutchecking their original copy, though this is pure speculation on my part.The Candidate is then lead to the Southern part of the Hall where the Hegemon shows him or her the Occultsymbolism ofthe Diagarm ofthe Garden Eden. The Tree ofLife in the centre is analogous to the figure in the TarotTrump Universe and the elements in the Cubical Cross with the twelve major divisions plus a more detailed set ofrings that relate to the complete hierachy of.the Schemphamphoresh angels. However closer inspection show thatthis diagram is far more detailed than the other two while sell retaining the simplicity of a geometric base.The final diagram shown to the Candidate, the Seven Hells and Seven Mansions, is when he is taken to thetablet ofthe Kenn and shown it. In many respects the last tablet is the most negative and is shown here as a type ofwarning. Like Adam and Eve, the Candidate must go from the Garden in the real world, and naist be prepared for it,and has now been warned ofthe negative existence ofEvil which he did not know before. The tide ofLord or Ladyofthis Path is bestowed and the Kerux leads the Candidate out.ADVANCEMENT TO THE SEPHIRAH OF YESODThe first thing of importance to note is that the Paths, placed above the dais, are now changed since theCandidate has passed into the Sephirah The Paths ofResh, Samekh and Tzaddi. At this point one will notice that theBanner ofthe West has been removed from the dais and placed beside the Fliereus and in fl-ont ofthe entranceway ofthe Portal. This of course is the Path of Tau, that the Candidate has just trodden, and is placed there because itprotects the Portal from the negative energies ofthis path from coming higher than they should have.Once the Kam has presented the Candidate with his Admission Badge, his blueprint of the ceremony inYesod, he is instructed in the 9 knocks which relate to the number of the Sephirah he is about to enter. At this stagethe Astral Body is again separated from the candidate and placed between the Pillars. The Candidate is than placeddirectly on the Portal within the Hall, the Hegemon giving him support and guidance and places him facing theIrterophant At this point we would mention that the entranceway to the Hall was always shown at the symbolicalWest or South West, and it was concluded that the candidate was then taken to the station of the Ifiereus where thePortal of Tau was place above him The reason the Tau was placed here was purely symmetrical and relates to theoverview of the hall placed in the position of the Kabbalah. At Wham Ra and other temples, the Tau was usuallyplaced on the entrance door, in the West though not necessarily above the position of I-fiereus. The placing of Tauanywhere in the West will suffice for it still then comes under the domain ofthe Helms.If the door is in the North-West then the candidate is not conducted around the Hall to anive at theappropriate point but taken straight to the Tau position and generally means he has to be taken to the point and moveanticlockwise, for a few Feet at least This is one of those times that one cannot move with Sol and commonsenseaPPlies.An exchange then takes place between the Hiereus and the Hegemon, on behalf of the candidate who thengives the Admission Badge to the Ifiereus and goes on to briefly explain its symbolism. Of this part of the ceremonyJack Taylor recalled an incident that happened in Where Ra in the 1930's.\"We were putting a woman through this grade who was considered highly clairvoyant by282"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"those who knew her. I was acting as Ilereus at the time to fill in for the Officer who was very illand could not attend the ritual. When we were waiting for the Flierophant to come around to usshe whispered to me that she could see and feel the Caduceus emblem on the floor of the hat Althat time I had not been introduced to higher teachings of the Order where the ground plan of thispart of the ceremony was revealed to us by Mrs. Felkin, and I thought she was referring to thebadge itself Since I had trusted this woman's judgement before, I decided to open up my ownfaculties and sure enough on the floor in front of us4 were the twin serpents. After the ritual, I thenapproached the then Ifierophant and told him what we had both seen and was told I was seeingthings and not to let my imagination run away with things. Mrs.Felkin who heard this called me toone side and asked me what I had seen and then called the other person to confirm this. Shecongratulated me and the other woman on attaining this type of awareness so early, and informedus that \"higher teachings were being revealed\" then proceeded to take the then Hierophant asideand inform him of something he should have known.\"283"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Eastn on the doorWagThe candidate is then taken to the station of the Nekhebt and the Bierophant then comes to join him on thisstation, the point of energy where the intersecting serpents join and which also represents the Sephirah ofYesod.By being placed on this position the energies of the serpents then flow through the Etheric Body of the candidate andis a good example of the effect ofthe Astral Light that Levi mentioned earlier. When the Sign ofthe Theoricus gradeis given by the Bierophant part ofthis magnetic energy is sealed in aura.The theory behind this is that once this accomplished polarity in the aura has been regulated which creates abalancing effect and helps strengthen it In short, a magnetic field is taken or absorbed by the Candidate. It is at thispoint also that Nekhebit helps balance these energies in the candidate through the power of her Uraeus wand for shebrings forth the power of Torun and Ra and units them. Some years ago, a friend of nine who is a lot moreclairvoyant then myself and well versed in Eastern philosophy pointed out that in this part of the ceremony theSushumna, Ida and Pingala go through a type of cleansing process. They are not activated but this cleansing processalso helps balance them more. Some years later when speaking to an Inner Order member ofWhare Ra I brought upthe subject of my Eastern friends perceptions thr this part of the 2=9. She was silent for a moment then went in toanother room and got her old 2=9 diary and pointed to some notes taken the night of the ritual that she wrote down.She had felt the tingling in the spine and a refreshing sensation wash over here at that point in the ceremony. It is also284"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"at this point, and not later, that the Physical and Astral body ofthe Candidate is reunited.The previously published rituals of Regardie from the Bristol-Hermes Temple actually differ quite a lot as faras positioning goes. When and how these changes were made is anyone's guess but the Whare Ra ritual and Golden-Dawn ones are identical on this point. The right or wrong ofthe Bristol-Hermes changes are difficult to judge thoughgoing by the floor plan of the Caduceus we assume that the onus of power is placed on the different Godforms anddiffittera sources ofenergy are drawn firm it. Frankly, I feel that when the changes were made, whoever made them,-was unaware of the energy pattern of the Caduceus floor plan or ignorant of the vety intricate energies of theGodfomis.(-40-141-RThe candidate is then taken to the station ofHormaku what further symbolism is explained. The Hegensen is )c-then taken to the station ofKephra, by the Hegemon, where the Ifiereus explains the symbolism of the AlchemicalSephiroth. He is then conducted to the tablet of linear Figures by the candidate in the station of Helm. Kenn( thanguides the candidate to the North-West and the station ofNephthys where the Tablet of geornantic figures is placed.The Ka= then conducts the candidate to the Station ofNu, at the base ofthe ilierophants throne where he or she isgiven the Magical Title or Name, shown theSigns and declared Theoricus in the power and name of Yesod andShaddai El ChaiAt this point in the explanation of the ceremony a mor9ofiller description of what exactly this Magical Titleentails is required. When a Magical Title is either given, or tal&n, by an individual, it becomes, to a certain extent, apersona of the Aspirant's personality. The whole concept ofthis additional personality and its magical use was rarelydiscussed within the Golden Dawn save at the Higher Grades.The Name or Mystic Title should be the one meditated on when one is about to perform ritual or meditation.-The persona of the name is a Higher Form of magnetic energy that an individual can draw upon when necessitydictates. These titles ofthe Outer Order can also have a distinct purpose in locking one into a specific energy patternthat can reveal a great deal, if called upon. Their etymological meanings are numerous but it is the Will of the-individ tql that is the catalyst for their useThe Title ofPORAIOS DE RFJECTIS - Brought from among the rejected.', initially alludes to Exodus andthe escape ofthe Jews from Egypt when the Jews were slaves (for all intents and purposes) to the Egyptians. Whenthe new Theoricus accepts this Mystical Title it shows that he or she is fleeing from the oppression of the materialworld (analogous to ancient Egypt) by following the High teachings &YHVH The name also relates to the materialpossessions the Jews left behind so that they could enter the 'Promised Land'. They produced an act of faith theTheoricus has done when the Material World of Mallash was left behind, and the Light of the Hidden Knowledgewas soughtAnother important Biblical Analogy is Matthew 21:42`Jesus saith to them, Did ye never read in the Scriptures that the stone that the builders rejected, the same isbecome the head ofthe comer this is the Lord doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?'This shows to us, that Yesod, as the 'Foundation' is ready to be built on with the Order.Alchemic*, the Mystical Title means that something that was once rejected is now recognised. This rdirectly to the Primea materia ofthe alchemist, the First Matter which the new Theoricus is likened to. To the Outsideworld there appears nothing outstanding to set it appart from other stone or pieces of earth about to be used in theexperiment. Yet in both the Primea Materia and the Thectiicus, the spiritual aspiration is strong, and within theframework ofthe Tree ofLife, which can be developed. Like the alchemist who is guided to the Primea Materia, soto is the Astral influence ofthe Order brought to bear on the Theoricus.SYMBOLISM OF THE CLOSINGThe main point of consideration here is the exposure to and invocation of the Elemental prayers. In GoldenDawn ritual we are given sets of hierarchies but many of us fail to use then and the Elementals are just one area AtWhale Ra, Taylor encouraged the new Theoiicus to meditate morning and night, preferably at Dawn and. Duskwhale saying the prayers of the Elements. PArh Element would be put aside for prayers to the respective Elementals.From this one attains a sympathy that is evoked through exposure from the Tablets and most important of all thesethrees are there to be drawn on and used, the most essential part of all magic.285"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Practicus 3=8Sign of Water Grade"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"A Commentary on the Practicus RitualINTRODUCTIONWithin the 3 = 8 ritual as given in this book, there will be a number of Golden Dawn rituals diagramsthat have never been in print before. This ritual, like the others before it came from the New Zealand TempleWhare Ra which dosed its doors in 1978. Though this ritual was originally the same as the Golden Dawn one-it was later utilised by the Stella Matutina. It is more complete than those previous published by IsraelRegardie, which had whole sections and a number of diagrams omitted from it. This of course was not thepublishers fault nor that of Regardie, but what was pruned from the original rituals by the Chiefs ofRegardies' former Temple, Bristol. I must confess the reason they did this is beyond me, when so muchvaluable information is left out. I am also convinced they either ignored the inner teachings given in this bookor they did not have access to it which in many respects does not surprise me.As in the other Grade Ritual books, I have given the Godfonns on the Dais, which are analogous withthe Enochian Chess pieces. At Whare Ra, the places of these Godfonns could be done by the Herophantactivating the lot, the Wardens taking their place or taken by the Chiefi. The latter only happened on a fewoccasions, no more than about 5 times in Whare Ra's 60 year history, according to Taylor, and this was whenthey considered that someone was important enough for them to attend. I have been informed that in the early-American Temples, the smaller ones, that the Chiefs attended most of the ceremonies when possible.People often contact me and ask me what must they do to set up a Golden Dawn Temple. My reply isbasically the same in all cases. Get a small group together, regularly practise and study the rituals, and the-teachings and then start doing the practical; For this is the main reason that these Golden Dawn books werewritten. Not for those in existing Temples but for those who wish to get started on their own.3 = 8The Golden Dawn ritual of Practicus, for the 3 = 8 Grade, is related to the KabbalisticSephirah of Hod, the Paths 30th and 31st Paths leading to Hod, and to the Element of Water. It isthe fourth of the Grade ceremonies of the Golden Dawn. The Ritual is divided up into two sections.The first is a subsequent exploration and meaning of the 30th Path and 31st Path of the Kabbalah,while the second section details the various meanings of the Sephirah of Hod. The 3 = 8 Grade wasthe one in the Golden Dawn that the various tutors in the Temples paid particular attention. Once-one went through it, a type of emotional catharsis was experienced shortly after the ceremony, inwhich the student would invariably 'get things off their chest', so to speak. Usually this related tostudy but it also could backfire a little in the home, and was one of the reasons that Templespreferred to have husbands and wives go through the grade ceremonies together as they would thenunderstand some of the emotional outbursts that could occur during this time.Taylor, often related the experiences that one felt when going through the 3 = 8 grade inconnection with the Aura, and was convinced that the Water Elementals, present in ones birthchart, would be stimulated to the point that the emotional aspects of ones nature would be morepredominant during the period between the 3 = 8 and the 4 = 7 rituals. Taylor considered that, thatpart of the Kabbalistic Soul, called the Ruach, would be pressured through the forces releasedduring the ritual, to stimulate certain emotional faculties of man and if there is an imbalance, it cancause emotional blockages on one hand and on the other over stimulate parts of the aura so thatboth delusion and illusion can occur, the question merely being one of degree.This does not mean to say that everyone who is unbalanced will find him or herselfhallucinating, for they will not, but they will find their emotional state very pliable at this time. Onthe positive side of things and what the ritual is designed, those who go through it will find manybenefits. I must first stress that before these occur some blocked-up tensions have to be released286"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"and for them to come out is quite normal as long as the person undergoing this realises what theyare experiencing. Usually this is minor and not noticable unless the individual and their tutor isexpressly looking for the signs. In our own New Zealand Temple, Thoth-Hermes, we usually findthat those with a predominance of the Water Element in their natal chart also get more emotionalthan those with other elements predominating during this Grade. They are usually warned by theirinstructors what may happen and take steps to understand this internal change for it is generallyvery brief but intense.The Water grade of the Golden Dawn is important in the sense it is the one where thestructure or framework is realised and helps shape the individuals attunement to his or her ownpsyche. Unfortunately not all those who go through this grade stay with the Order, and the 3. = 8grade is the one where the greatest percentage of dropouts occur, according to Taylor. To use hisown words:People who came to Whare Ra, for what ever reasons, tended to flunk out at 3= 8 more than any other grade because they felt too deeply or too strongly and didnot want to get that involved and as a result simply closed down. Many got scaredand did not want to make the type of committment that they saw further study andgraduation would bring. This was in reality not a wrong move on their part for theyusually found that they were in fact not ready to give that commitmment at thatpoint in time. Some would come back years after, but they were rare. The Psychewould find that they were emotionally not suited for this type of work. I couldnormally judge' this by the time the ritual had finished for if something in the ritualwent wrong that related directly to Water then they would progress, but if they hada great deal of Water in their chart and nothing happened then I knew it would comeout a month or so later and do so negatively. Using this rule of thumb approach overthe years I had a very high rate of accuracy on their progress.In the old Golden Dawn a number of Order members were put through this grade and thenext barely a month apart. This practice whowever was later stopped by those in the StellaMatutina (which inherited the bulk of the Golden Dawn's membership in 1903) because they feltthere was not enough time spent on this grade so that the emotional situation could rebalance itselfout before going onto the next element. Timing here is of prime importance and should be tailoredto suit the individual. Some members, who went through the same grade ceremony at the same timeand who had about the same the same degree of intellectual capacity, emotional balance andcommittment to the Order, could never understand why another went ahead of them when they haddone better at the grade exams. This is where the skill of a good tutor, if used correctly, judges theperson to be ready.SYMBOLISM OF THE TEMPLEThe ground plan of the Sephiroth on the Temple floor remains the same for both the 31st and30th Path31st PathThe three Hebrew letters of Shin, Tau and Qoph are placed above the dais, as seen from theSephiroth of Malkuth. This is done because to traverse the Path of Shin one must start in Malkuth.Beneath the letter Tau, hangs the pentacle because Tau alludes to the Element of Earth which alsohas four elements within it. The Banner of the East is placed under the letter of Qoph which showsthe reflected light from this Path the candidate has yet to travel. The Letter Shin, is placed so that itcan only be attained by entrance through the Black and White Pillars. This is further symbolised by287"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"the red lamp placed directly behind the opening created by the pillars to show the way one has toenter. Behind the red lamp is yet another lamp showing the spiritual link of the Path to the ritualitself for when the lamp is lit then the link to the 31st path is then opened.There are three Enochian Tablets unveiled on the walls during the ritual. Earth in the North,Air in the East and Water in the West. Since the candidate has been exposed to these Tablets, theyare then left so that they can balance and reinforce his or her aura with the energy received fromthem in previous rituals. There is no visible Tablet of Fire, this is usually covered with the red clothand its energies are represented by the Incense. The main Tablet here is the Water one in the West-and this is the one that is opened during this ceremony and its various Godforms come forward andmerge with the candidates aura during the ritual. In general the Enochian Tablets are thepowerhouse of the Elemental Rituals. Although other Godforms are called they all must come-through the framework of the Enochian Tablets and this is where they are very powerful, and setthe tone for future magical work within the Order. It would I feel, be fair comment to say that manyof those within the Golden Dawn and later Temples, regardless of rank, had no idea of the powerand magnitude of the Enochian Tablets. In this day and age Enochian magic is very popular, andmost understand, due to the fact that it was seen from the Order's viewpoint, which has beenechoed through the writing's of Regardie and Crowley.However, to Order members of the Golden Dawn and Stella Matutina, many of these types ofbooks were not available or known of even as late as thirty years ago which was very true withinthe New Zealand Order at any rate. So in fact many of those with very high ranks within the Order-did not understand the real importance of the Tablets in ritual. This is not a vast sweeping statementbut based on the comments made to me by the former head Chief of Whare Ra, the Late John VonDadelszen, who reached the rank of 9 = 2 and died in the late 1980's. Von Dadelszen actually madethe point to me that he didn't know anything about the Enochian Tablets, during a pleasantevening's discussion, which really floored me. Other Temple members who reached the rank of 7 =4 and above have also made similiar statements to me over the years. Though they were not all likethis, the vast majority were within the New Zealand Order at least. Regardie once entertained aNew Zealand couple from Whare Ra, in California, in the early 1960's and was of the same opinionthat their knowledge of Enochiana was very limited on the totality of the Orders teachings. Whenhe mentioned their names to me in 1983 I informed him that both were the rank of 7 = 4 at the timeof their visit. This really astounded him.The symbol on the Altar, which is normally obscured by the large Tarot Trump (the size ofthe cards in the rituals are quite large compared to the standard deck of playing cards given out bythe Order) is the Cross above the downward pointing triangle. At this point it is hidden and notexplained but its symbolism generally means rising above the problems that tend to drown us. Nowbeside the Altar are two large candle stands or small altar's with lamps on them. Their placing isjust at the base of the Altar or slightly below it and must be very precise. Their meaning is multi-_faceted representing the stations of the Godforms and also the the two bases for the hidden triangle.Some Temples choose to omit these lights, thinking the lights at the West would perform the samefunction. The Stella Matutina in general preferred to leave them there which was a sign someonewas thinking clearly as they give .a balance to the Temple that it does not have without them.Diagrams of the 31st PathThe diagram of The Seven Heavens of Assiah as given in the rituals are taken almost wordfor word from the work of Knorr Von Rosenroth's 'Kabbala Denudata'. The Golden Dawnsubstituted the title for the First Heaven as Ghereboth where most consider as Araboth. Below is apaper, given to me by Taylor, relating to this diagram. Though its translator is unnamed and thepaper is undated, it is taken from the Zohar. Taylor mentioned to me that he was given this paperby Mrs. FeLldn though very few in Whare Ra during his early years apparently knew of its existance.Though given in the flowery language of the Zohar, it is still never the less an interesting piece ofwork.

At first the Light was at the right and thedarkness was at the left. What then did the Holy One do? He merged the one into theother and from them formed the heavens. The heavens are composed of Fire andWater. He brought them together and harmonised them, and when they were unitedas one he stretched them out like a curtain and formed them into the letter Vau. Fromthis letter the Light spread, so that the curtain became curtains, as it is written:\"Thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains.\"`Seven firmaments are stretched out and stored in the Supernal treasure house,as it has been explained, and over them is one firmament which has no colour and noplace in the world of cognition, and is outside the range of contemplation; but,though hidden, it diffuses light to all and speeds them on its fitting orbit. Beyond thatfirmament knowledge can penetrate, and man must close his mouth and not seek toreflect upon it.

For if there are ten apart from the Shekinah, then she would be theeleventh, addition to the ten, thus really there are nine, and nine days which comesbetween New Years day and the day of Atonement and are a symbol then. Ninedays, which are completed by the tenth. The same is true of the ten curtains in thetabernacle, corresponding to the ten firmaments. Here is a mystery of mysteries,which none but the adepts in esoteric wisdom can fathom, on of those mysteries ofthe Holy Lamp (known as Rabbai Simeon) who could expound the mystery of everyfirmament and of every being who officiates in each of them.

You will note here how Mathers disassociates the Court Cardsfrom the main Tree of Life but places them on the Diefic form of the Kabbalah. When I first readthese tarot notes I was not very impressed with them until I discussed them with Taylor whopointed out that this was the only lecture that gave the full actions of both the Paths and Sephirothtogether. He further informed me that the tarot associations in this paper were at best an analogyand I should look further afield using this paper as a base. Normally Taylor would come out and saywhat he thought but on this paper he was unusually cryptic to say the least and as such I studied itvery carefully, looking for hidden meanings in it.I felt, and still do that this little paper is the only one that combines the influences ofAstrology and the Kabbalah to produce the meaning of the 21 Tarot Keys. While the theme to thisbook is a 'reveal all' I will follow the instructions Taylor gave me on this paper and throw it back atthe reader to do more research on it and state that they will be most surprised at the results as whatMathers has given you here is sufficient to get anyone started.Notes on the Tarotby FRATER S.R.M.D.In the Tree of Life in the Tarot, each path forms the connecting link betweentwo of the Sephiroth.

The diagram represents notonly Man but Israel as well. The twofigures in the central column implies thatWoman developed from man, shown byher lower status on the Tree. Both at thisstage appear to be hermaphrodital. Oneform of teachings shows us that the vesselsof man and Woman were deemedimperfect as they could not reproducecorrectly. This was the pre-separationstate. It appears that while the State Adamand Eve were in, the Garden of Eden, theythemselves, were not equipped to handleit. When the sexes completely separated,or the vessels shattered, they could notknow the previous state they had beforebecause in the separation of the sexes, manand Woman lost part of themselves thatthey could only try to find together.SYMBOLISM OF THE ALTARThe Cross above the inverted triangle is very important to the Water Grade of Hod.

An easy method to remember whichcell is which is to use a pencil and draw a linethrough the diagonals in each of the four squares.The same proceedure is now repeated in theremaining three minor squares. The remainingnumbers are now interchanged with each other. For example, 2 interchanges with 63, 3interchanges with 62. 6 interchanges with 59 and 7 interchanges with 58. The whole proceedure isquite simple with the highest remaining numbers interchanging with the lowest. The diagonals ofeach of the four minor squares remain the same.The Seal of Mercury stems from the formation of the number of cells. The diagonals thatwere kept in place when the numbers in the cells were rearranged now have a line drawn throughtthem.

Forget each number or cell with a linethrough it and we have the numbers (from theright) 62 and 63. These are reduced as byTheosophic reduction, or reducing doublenumbers to a single digit and are as follows:62=6+2=8 while 63=6+3=9.

TheBulls horns show the Third Order and the Path to it throughDaath, the Abyss. Kether stands yet above all things as theinfinite source that the Adept must aspire to return to.'TIREL is the name of the Intelligence ofMercury. When utilised as numbers the namegives 9,10,200,10,1,30. When reduced by AiqBeker the numbers for this name are9,10,20,11,30. The reduction was only with the200 by reducing a single zero off it while 1 wasused as a double digit figure of 11. When tracingthis though a small M shape is given on the cellnumbered 11. In my original Golden Dawn papersfrom Whare Ra Temple, the version of Tiriel isgiven on its side. I might add here that what hasbeen published by Regardie in his two GoldenDawn volumes and in his 'How to MakeTalismans' books, show this figure either given asa mirror image or given on its side. The onlybooks I have seen that does this figure correctlyis 'High Magic' by King and Skinner and TheRudd manuscripts which were published by AdamMcLean as 'Angelic Magic'.In the rituals, the figures and names of 8(Asboga), 64(Din) and 2080(Taphthartharath -which has already been explained), are givensomewhat cryptically. The 8 and the 64 are easilyexplained for the eight is the Eighth Sephirah ofHod and the square root of 64, the number ofcells in the kamea. The number of 2080 is formedfrom the addition of all numbers in the cells of thekamea.303"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Seven Planes on theTree of Life is one diagramthat bears a great deal ofstudy on. The associations atfirst seem cryptic but inreality they are very wellthought out. The entireconcept is to show the sevenmain rates of vibration fromthe lowest to the highest. Byplacing the planetary symbolson each plane one shows thatthis vibrational concept isgradual, the order of theplanets shows their rate ofmotion. In other words thedivision of the materialconcept of the universethrough seven stages ofgrowth. I did not appreciatethis diagram until, again,through Taylors urging, Iread the works of AliceBailey. For Taylor equatedthe Seven Rays with theSeven Planes. In 'EsotericAstrology' Alice Baileywrites:The sevenrays are thereforeembodiments of seventypes of force whichdemonstrate to us theseven qualities of theDiety. These sevenqualities have consequently a sevenfold effect upon matter and forms to be found inall parts of the universe, and also have a sevenfold interrelations betweenthemselves...Life-quality-appearance are brought together into synthesis in themanifested universe and in man incarnate, and the results of this synthesis issevenfold, producing seven types of qualified forms which emerge on all plans whichwe, from out little point of view, regard as formless are not really so. Our sevenplanes are but the seven sub-planes of the cosmic physical plane.The Mathers diagram here shows how this can be applied to the Kabbalistic concept. I wouldalso urge others to study the works of Alice Bailey, especially her 'Treatise on Seven Rays series'and her seven stage system, for in a great many areas it fits in with the Golden Dawn application.When I first studied this diagram I thought it was placing emphasis on Seven Astral Planes butthrough the works of Bailey and others, this is merely the tip of the iceberg and it gives an almostunlimited approach to esoteric thinking and it can become as deep as you want to make it.304"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Four Planes Corresponding to the Four Elements isvery straightforward in the sense it gives a four fold divisionof the Kabbalah.

I feel that this is an error, whether deliberate orotherwise and I have corrected it to fall in line with the alchemicalassociations as given in the 2 = 9 ritual by placing the symbol of Saturn inChokmah. I am unaware of what was given in the English Temples buthave mentioned my correction in case it was given in the old GoldenDawn as well. If the original diagram had the Jupiter symbol for bothChokmah and Binah then it was placed as a deliberate blind in the ritualfor the aspiring Adept to work out. This was something that Taylorcontinuously warned me to look out for.The Planets in the Mercurical Figure:As near as I can tell, the Golden Dawn diagram of thisfigure comes from the works of Johannes Banfi Hunyades(1576-1650), and is another version of Dee's HieroglyphicMonad. This takes the single figures of the planets, as givenin the 30th Path and places them in a single unit. I wouldpoint out that as mentioned earlier, The Hieroglyphic Monadof Dee should be studied to get full value out this diagramwhich would take a full book in itself to explain.305"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"SYMBOLISM OF THE OPENINGThe first knock, by the Hierophant, brings in the current that activates the ceremony. In thepreliminary work on setting up the Temple props and the creation of Godforms was all donethrough the power of the Office of the Hierophant which he assumes during the Equinox ceremony.This differs from the power of individual Grade rituals and is the power which brings through theenergy for these rituals through the personal power of the Hierophant. Ritual energy or power as itis sometimes called, must have some type of receptacle for it otherwise it will scatter and wastewithout any definite form of cohesion. The receptacle for this is of course the Temple props in thephysical and the Godforms in the Astral. If the Hierophant has not done the correct pre ritualvisualisation procedures then the energy that comes in is unbalanced. The first level of this checkingdevice is the Godforms who control and disperse this energy and the second level is the TempleOfficers themselves if the first level has not been created correctly. The ceremony can continue ofcourse but it places a great deal of strain on the Temple Officers.When studying any form of group Golden Dawn ritual you will note there are numerouschecks and balances throughout so that if someone is half asleep during the ritual someone elsetakes over and handles the energies correctly. As I have mentioned in other ritual books, the astraleffect on the candidate actually begins long before he or she enters the Hall.From the moment that the Sentinal, sword in hand, attends to the candidate then thecandidate is in fact under his protection, through his form of Anubis the Guardian and who holdsthe Nephesch of the candidate in ready for the entrance to the Hall.When the Hierophant asks the Hegemon to see that the Hall is properly guarded he sendsforth a stream of light to that Officer. The affirmation of the Hegemon shows that the light has beenreceived and sent back to the Hierophant. The second command of the Hierophant then sends forthanother stream of light to the Hiereus whose affirmation returns it back to the Hierophant. At thispoint there are a number of questions and answers given but a triangle of light forms from theHierophant to the two Officers. The next move by the Hierophant is a very unusual one in fact hedraws forth yet another triangle from the Water Tablet by pulling it along to the two sides of thetriangle.When I first started to see the twin red beams during the opening of a 3 = 8 grade I was quitesurprised and almost stopped the ritual. Then when I saw the green reverse triangle coming fromthe Water Tablet, in opposite direction, I was even more intrigued. A week or so after thishappened I contacted Taylor and asked him about the significance of the colors or was I just seeingthings. He then smiled at me in that enigmatic way of his and started to explain the the full effect ofthe Admission badge on the currents of energy on the floor during the 3 = 8 ritual. I would pointout at this time I had no idea of the Admission badges and their effect on the Temple floor. Taylorkept this information back from me until I started to perceive these energies, and it was only afterthat, that he started to tutor me in the full effect of them.When I then mentioned these energies to others who had reached the 7 = 4 rank in Whare Ra,I got a blank look in return. The only people that I know of who referred to them were Taylor,Hugh Campbell (in a conversation with Percy Wilkinson) and former Chief Bettany Jones (during aphone conversation with her in the early 1980's when I asked her point blank were papers given outon the subject). For some reason or another very few would be given the papers of the AdmissionBadges on the Temple floor plans. According to Taylor, at Whare Ra you had to see the effect thenapproach Mrs. Felkin who only then instruct you. The diagrams Taylor copied to his note book hadMathers initials on them.The Adoration is done through Elohim Tzaboath, the Holy name of the Sephirah of Hod. TheAdoration is of course done in front of the Elemental Tablet of Water. At this point the Officers areconcentrating on the Elemental Quarter and not the Tablet. This is done when the knock of theHierophant is given which sends forth a fresh current to the Water quarter. The invoking306"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Pentagrams are then done in the West, infront of the Water Tablet, to invoke the ArchangelGabriel. It's done in front of the Tablet because the Tablet happens to be in that quarter, no otherreason. Regardie believed that one activated the Tablets this way and while he is correct, this typeof activation was very special and only used for special occasions, such as the Consecration of theVault Ceremony, and not for Outer Order Elemental ceremonies. You'll note that the followinggesture to the names on the Tablets are all passive gestures and so they should be. Mathers did aminor paper on this which I have reproduced in part, in the previous books on the Elementalgrades. The Pentagrams effectively work directly on Gabriel and `Blindeth him their Brilliance', toquote Mathers.With the use of the Sign of the Eagle and the Cross the Three Secret Names of the Tablet arethen called on and at this point the Tablet of Water is being petitioned directly. The Names of MphArsl Gaiol and Ra-agiosel are called for the two highest names in the Tablets. The first name fuses alink to the Hierophant with the Tablet and the second reinforces the Tablet to the Planet ofMercury. Though this in astrological terms is an Air Planet, in Kabbalistic associations it worksthrough HOD and the Water Element. Also the Three Secret Holy Names of God relate to theAstrological Houses and they are said to effect the candidate in the following manner:Mph: 8th HouseThis works on areas of partnerships and occult study and tries to harmonise them intogether. It also helps one come to terms with physical loss.Arsl: 9th HouseThe influence of this house shows the mental reaction to ones study. It helps work on longrange plans and opens up avenues of additional teaching.Gaiol: 10th HouseThis house helps one find ones depth in occult and spiritual activity and gain some sort ofperspective on things in general.The Officers are standing in front of the Enochian Tablet, in positions forming a triangle fromthe Hierophant. This is so that as the Hierophant links his Ruach with it, they can spread the load ofpower if there are any problems. Taylor told me of an incident some years ago at Whare Ra wherethe Hierophant was standing in front of the Tablets and was virtually doing nothing but saying theinvocation with little enthusiasm. Both Officers standing behind him (of whom Taylor was one) letout a small gasp simultaneously as the energy went through the Hierophant and decided to settle inthe two Officers. Taylor described this function as like working in an invisible cloud where everymovement was heavier than normal. When the ceremony had finished both Officers werethoroughly exhausted. This is but one example of what can go wrong and the Enochian energy overcompensates in the Officers. Taylor made the point that both Officers behind the Hierophant were 5= 6 and that if Outer Order members would have been the Officers then there would have beenmany difficulties in the ritual.The three Officers then do a battery of 8 knocks each, which relates to tapping into theenergy emanating from the Sephirah of Hod.The number of knocks then given relate to the 8th Sephirah of Hod showing the current theyare tapping into.307"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"ADVANCEMENT ON THE 31ST PATH OF SHINWhen I was first shown a copy of this floor plan by Taylor, heinformed me that he thought it was one of the most significant inthe Outer Order rituals. Not so much for hidden currents of energyon the floor but for the deep symbology, which Taylor told me wasalmost purely alchemical by nature. For this part of the ritual leadsto the water grade of Hod, Splendour, though it is supported by theTriangle of Fire, the base of the cup. The base of the triangle coversMalkuth with the apex entering into Yesod. This shows Malkuth, asthe first matter or earth of the alchemists, being heated by firethrough the timing of the planets and transmuting up through theframework of the four planes on the Tree of Life.When the first matter reaches Yesod, it has transmuted intosteam as the Airy nature of Yesod exerts its influence.308"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"The Black Pillar shows the transmutation of the dry way, while the White Pillar shows the wetway. At the Tiphareth point, the Airy nature is transmuted into the watery solvent which producesthe Garden of Eden or the ultimate utophia, the Holy elixer which transmutes man into his originalstate, shown by Kether. Above this is the symbol of Mercury, with the symbol of Mem above it.Taylor also made the comment to me on other aspects of this diagram:The left tip of the crescent touches Binah and the extreme natue of the solidwhile the right tip touches Chokmah, near the altar of incense, shows the vitrol oracid nature. Both are extremes yet the Garden of Eden is the Middle way. TheMercury sign above it is a symbol of the Universal Essence.The speech of the Hierophant gives the dispensation for the Candidate to enter the Hall. Thisspeech is always generally confused as a petition to ask the Temple Chiefs to be admitted to thisdegree. However, what in effect happens is that the Hierophant actually petitions the Chiefs orunseen Guardians who control the Inner and Outer Orders to let the candidate enter and partake inthe mysteries, not those said Chiefs of the Temple.The Hegemon, in the Godform of Axiokersa, is the Kabir, the Guide. Wynn Westcott tells uswho these mysterious Kabir were:Kabeiria: A very ancient system of the Mysteries existed among the Islands ofthe Aegean Sea, and chiefly at Samothrace. This district was inhabited by thePelasgians, a race of Indio-Germanic type which preceeded the Greeks. TheSamothracians performed the Mysteries called the Kabeiria, in honour of a group ofDieties, the Kabeiri, consisting of Axieros, Axiokersos, Axiokersa, and the novicewas called Kasmillos. The ceremony took place yearly, and lasted nine days.Personal virtuous conduct was demanded, and a form of absolution of sins wasgranted. The Initiated wore a purple ribbon around their bodies as a talisman. It wasbelieved to render them specially exempt from dangers of the sea.Eusebius, quoting Sanchoniathon, gives an account of these mysteries. Somemythologists find a relation between the kabeiri, the Great Ones, and the GreekChronos(Satuni) with his sons. Others relate them to the Hebrew Noah, or to thePhoenician Sydyk, and again to the Patriach Shem.The secret rites commemorated a narrative that Axieros, Axiokersos andAxiokersa, had murdered Kasmillos. The novice, after due ceremonial, was crownedand invested with an olive branch, and then sacred dances were performed. Thespecial Priests were called Korybantes. Macrobius tells us that these festivals wereperformed at the vernal Equinox, and that the symbolism referred to the Sun inAutumn and Spring-time.The learned Faber has a large volume of the Kabeiri. Hereodotus tells us thatCambyses, King of Persia, unlawfully entered the Temple of the Kabeiri when in a fitof madness, defiled it, and burned all their images.'When studying the above paper one cannot help but see the strong links to the Golden DawnTarot Key, Judgement, where the Kabir are raised from the dead to face judgement for murderingKasmillos, whom no doubt was sacrificed for the coming spring.In the antechamber, the Hegemon then hands the Admission badge to the candidate and takesover from the Sentinal for it is only the Hegemon that can open the door to the Hall and does sowith a battery of 8 knocks. This is done while holding the left hand of the candidate. I have heard anumber of reasons for this but the simple explanation is that the right arm of the Hegemon is thestrongest side relating to the Pillar of Severity and it reinforces the left side of the candidate, thePillar of Mercy. The Hegemon reinforces the weak areas ,,of the candidate allowing him or herprotection From a psychic viewpoint the Etheric body of the candidate is charged to a high rate of309"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"vibration by this act and readies the subtle anatomy of the candidate to receive the higher forms ofenergies given in the ritual. I was very familar with this concept when studying Tantra Yoga withVivandatta in India over two decades ago, who worked on a similiar principle.The speech given by the Hegemon, before the door is opened relates to the Solar power thattravels across the heavens as is the candidate about to do once he enters the Hall.I have mentioned before in previous Golden Dawn ritual commentaries about the next step,that is the candidate crossing over the Portal, has be done with extreme care. The small pyramidheld by the candidate actually helps here for it is a model of the energies in the hall. The Hegemonalso helps with this through aura energising process I have described above. The path of thecandidate usually is done from a door near the right basel angle of the triangle or if the door is inanother part of the room it is usually worked so that the entranceway is either the left of right basel-angle of the triangle. The Hegemon leads the candidate along the angle towards the West, and pasthis or her own station (depending on entranceway) to the station of the Hiereus. At this point theenergies of the godforms of the Three Kabir are the controlling aspects of the ceremony though-there is some assistance from Shoee Tha Ist, who is both on the Dais and controls the Pillars, thebalancing force of the Hall. The Ilerophant in fact, in the form of Axierus on the floor, sends forthhis stream of light to guide the candidate along the correct path for without the guiding force of theHierophant the three Kabir cannot act.The FEereus's function is to further test the candidate and when the correct symbolism isexchanged the Hiereus then opens up his station so that the candidate can pass through it. TheObligation taken at this point then sends forth a further stream of light into the aura of thecandidate's mach that makes it receptive to what it is about to receive. Once the candidate holdsthe Cup of Water in front of the Water Tablet, the energies of that Tablet then impregnate the auricbodies of the candidate. This is further ratified with the sprinkling process. The Godform ofNephthys who is at this station also further helps by sending forth her energies to help stabilise thetransition phases of the energies of the Tablet and the candidate linking together. To, further helpthis stabilisation process she sends forth the candidate to the Pillars in the East where he is placedunder the protection of the Godform of Shooeu Tha Ist. This is usually done through the station ofthe Imperator on the Dais and if he or no other Warden is present then the Hierophant must activatethis part of the process himself.By taking the candidate through the Pillars the candidate meets up with his Higher Self who isplaced between the Pillars when he enters the Hall. The lamp placed in front of this position is asymbol of its blinding light. Once a complete circumambulation of the Hall is done the entiretriangle of Fire has been traversed and the Candidate stands in front of the Hierophant as Axieros,-who is about to initiate him in the solar mysteries as the First Kabir. Two more circumambulationsare done, stopping first at the seat of the Hiereus as Axiokersos the second Kabir followed byanother circumambulation stopping at the seat of the Hegemon as the third Kabir.The Candidate is then placed in the West and roughly on the point of the internal triangle.Quoting Taylor again on this point:`The Theoricus must be. so placed so that the internal or reverse triangle (asshown in the diagram) holds him in check. Some have put the seat of the Theoricusin the North West but to my mind they do not understand the reason of the seatingarrangement in the first place. This inner triangle is Kasmillos and the Path that hehas trodden on is drawn from a power of the early Greek Mysteries that the Orderhas tapped into. What we have here is a ritual from within a ritual. The Forms ofboth Isis and Homs who send forth this light and cradle the Theoricus in their graspdo so through the balance of Nephthys yet again. Remember that the Inner trianglestarts at the stations of Tharpeshet and Knousou Pekht, at the very base of the Altar.The whole concept is one of self sacrifice of the Candidate for the greater good ofall.'310"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"As discussed earlier I made mention of the diagrams shown by the Officers and the Tarot Keyof the Path they represent.

By this I mean the Higher self of the candidate isinstructed at a level not consciously known to the candidate at present and which in future monthsor even years opens up the deeper layers of meaning within the psyche.ADVANCEMENT ON THE 3011I PATH OF RESHThe diagram (at left) shows the Temple arranged in the floor plan of the Admission Badge ofthe 30th path, the Solar Greek Cross. You will note the changes of the Hebrew letters around theedge of the Hall, signifiying the Godforms that have been discussed earlier.The Hegemon, as Axiokersa the guide, and under the influence of Shooeu-Tha-Ist, throughthe control of the Imperator or Warden in this position, brings the candidate up to the gates of thepath - The Pillars. The Officer on the dias then releases control to the Godform of Shooeu-Tha-Iston the floor at the station at the pillars. The Ruach of the candidate is here held in check and alsoprotected by this Godform and also Nephthys, who controls the actions of the Water Tablet. At thePillars, Axiokersa then petitions the Godform of the path of Resh, Aten, to let the candidate enter.3,11,"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Admission Badge of the Greek Crossallows the Higher Self of the candidate to passsafely through the Pillars and past the Godformof Shooe-Tha-Ist.The candidate is halted at the foot of thethrone of the Hierophant by the Godform ofSocharis. This place is the domain of not onlySocharis but also of Axieros. While Socharisholds the form of the candidate in place it is thefunction of Axieros to instruct him. TheHegemon then circles the Temple to the seat ofthe Hiereus and there is given charge to theGodform of Axiokersos and is furtherinstructed. The concept here is to implant uponthe nature of the candidate his likeness to theSolar path of the Sun as it effects the seasons. Inthe previous position we had the sun in greatestelevation and now we have the Sun in greatest depression. Both these concepts relate of course tothe Summer and winter Solstice. The candidate is then lead around the Temple to the station of theHegemon where the Godfonn of Axiokersa now stands and informs the candidate he is at the placewhere the sun is in Equilibrium, the Sun in the heart of the Equinox. IsAt this point it should noted that what the Golden Dawn are-trying to do is not merely take)i'some Godforms from an old current of power but actually tap into that ancient current conceivedby the Kabiri and draw from its energies yet within the framework of the Order. It is also rathersurpising that those who went through this ceremony were very unsure of what was happening.Taylor gave us yet another example:`After going through the 3 = 8 ritual, it was not unusual for me to beapproached to help explain some of its symbolism a little more deeply whichconstantly irked the Daemonstrator who was supposed to be doing this sort of thing.All they would get from them would be to re-read and study the rituals until youunderstood them. The 30th path was a real puzzle to those who went through it andeventually I had a small group who would come to me for instruction on this issuewhich in reality was simply to explain the festivals of the Equinox and the Solsticeand how the Kabir fitted into the scheme of things. I gave a small lecture one nightto a group of half a dozen or so who had just gone through the 3 = 8 and explainedthe festivals as best I could. The next night the Daemonstrator in charge of our areaarrived on my door step and accused me of undermining his authority. I promptlytold him that they approached me because he was not doing his job right. He waseventually replaced by someone who turned out to be an even bigger ass and madematters even worse. I still continued to give the small lectures regardless.'This situation at Whare Ra actually shows the two modes of teaching. The first is to wait untilsome mystical experience opens up doorways within the self and the second is to show a widerframework and help the mystical experience grow.The candidate is then taken to his seat, which is in the place of the Godform of Aroueris andreceives the speech of the Hierophant. It is the function of Aroueris to make this informationunderstandable to the candidate where the final mysteries of the Kabir are implanted. This is shownby the Admission Badge is of Greek origin and can only be invoked through that medium. A currentfrom the Hierophant then travels towards the Ruach of the candidate which is received anddispersed into the candiate's aura by Aroueris. When the Greek Cross is given to the Hierophant,by the Hegemon it is a symbol that these mysteries have been understood.312"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"The Hierophant and Hegemon come to the West of the Altarand stand in the positions of the Godforms of Tharpeshest andKnousou Pekht, thus activating these two Godforms to implant theinformation of this Key through the form of Osiris (where thecandidate stands). The 19th Key of the Tarot is then explained.The candidate is then taken to the West, by way ofcircumambulation, to the Tablet of the Hiereus where thecompounded Planetary Figure is then shown to the candidate.This figure, as mentioned earlier, is a slight variation of theHieroglyphic Monad. The symbol of the compounded planets andalchemy. The Hieroglyphic Monad is a very powerful meditativefigure, especially in alchemy. It is a figures that emits powerwithout any need for an invocation. Its effect on the psyche isimmediate. Recent investigations of this figure show that it canalign the Astral-emotional body with the mental Body and preparesthe way for change within the psyche of the individual. The Ethericbody is also infused with energy throughout all the meridians andharmony occurs. In many respects the alignment of the lower subtlebodies parallels the message the figure gives aichemicly, that of transmutation. Waite shows us thisin his 'Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross', though he goes further than what Mathers had intended.The external change and transmutation of metals must be allied within the subtle bodies of man toproduce an etheric balance between the two dimensions. Waite says of the breakdown of thisfigure:Mercury: The crescent denotes its lunar part, which is feminine and volatile innature. This is the Spiritus Mercurii...The cross at the base represents the volatile body of this metallic substance. It is thewater of quicksilver, otherwise Aqua Permanens. It is also the Sal Centrale andMenstrum Naturale. Quicksilver is an immature metal, an extremely volatile ens,separated from a fixed state as pole from pole.Mars: Mars is the correspondence with iron and the sign showing an arrow emergingsidewards from a circle, signifies that the Sal Martis is Celestial rather thenTerrestial, while its cross or sign of corrosion has broken up into an open anglesignifying fire. Thus the inward nature of iron is fiery, active and magneticallyattractive which indicates its place in hermetic operations. In the Work, the taskbefore the Adept is to purify the externally adherent Celestial Salt from the TerrestialSulphur and locate it within the circle.Venus: The sign that indicates copper is an imperfect metal, for the point ofperfection within the circle from which the gold cannot err has been removed fromthe circle of Venus and has changed into the cross. This cross signifies the corrosivesalts which render copper a perishable nature. Whosoever can purfiy these salts willreduce the cross to a point and he can place that point again in the circle, he will seethe sun at its meridian instead of the morning star, and possess gold instead ofvenusian copper.Jupiter: The sign bears witness to the great immaturity of tin. The crescent indicatesthat it is of essentially of lunar nature, while the cross which is the sign of the SalCentrale et fimdamentum subjecti, points out that the earth of this metal is mercurialand lunar, the salt arsenical and sulphur volatile. It follows that the corpus totum canbe brought with considerable faculty to a state of liquifaction.Saturn: The salt of lead is mercurial and lunar as also pure and celestial, while thesulphur is terrestial and solar.

The Characters ofthe Moon. The circle is broken and the missing half is put inward but the point is stillin the vicinity. Silver is like unto Gold, as woman is like unto man; but gold as themale part is hot and dry, while silver, the female part, is moist and cold. Theimperfection of silver is indicated by the ease with which it blackens, Silver is thedaughter of the Moon, or in other words turn the light inwards and draw out theinward half of the circle. The Artist who does so kindles an independent fire andtransmutes silver to gold.Sun: Gold is Principium Solis and the end of all metals, the great intent of nature inthe work of mines.

The Son of the Sun is theproduct of profoundly concentrated fire.After another circumambulation the candidate is taken to the Tarot Tablet. The associationsgiven here of the Hebrew letters to the tarot Trumps with the zodiac symbols and the paths of theTree of life was important in its day for this had never been revealed in print before. Mathers alsochanged some of the previous esoteric French associations.It was instiled in me, by Taylor, that anything one was shown on the tarot was under theinfluence of the Godform Thoth, or one of his variations. In this grade it is done from the Daisthrough the energy of Hapimon. At this point it is Hapimon, through the lesser influence ofAxiokersos, who guides the candidate to the station of Axiokersa, a diety who also adds his powerto the instruction. However this is under the influence of Nephthys who holds the Astral form of thecandidate and reuinites it with his body as he stops in front of the tarot attributions.Yet another circumambulation takes place and the candidate is then lead to the Tablet ofOlympic planetary spirits. Now in the stops in front of the two previous Tablets the godforms ofAxiokersos and Axiokersa took over the instruction of the candidate but at this point the Godformof Horns then holds the station of guarding the Olympic Planetary Spirits and this is the form thecandidate must go through to receive instruction.The candidate is taken yet to another Tablet, the Geomantic figures which are allied to theElement of Earth. Axiokersa is yet again the guiding form that helps the candidate but this is donethrough the energy of Nephthys, who in conjunction with her sister Godform Isis who holds theastral form of the candidate while Nephthys guides the candidate through his or her Ruach. For it ishere that the title of Lord of the 30th path is given, when the Ruach and Nesharnah are united.314"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"ADVANCEMENT TO THE SEPHIRAH OF HODThe Hegemon, under the influence of Chesed and the Isis current, brings the candidate to theLetter Resh.

It is held and protected, like Eden in a well balanced dispositionbut this is a temporary measure as more knowledge is gained. This is done through the power of the315"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Godform Osiris whose place governs Tiphareth on the centralfloor.

In somuch as this does not make one an instant genius but it doesopen up new levels of awareness within the self which theRuach will instinctively grasp and send down impulses to theNephesch. The entire concept here is extremely subliminal. InFlying Roll 10 Mathers says of this diagram:`Dealing with the Altar Diagram of the 3 = 8Grade, it will be seen that Adam is in. the Tipharethpart: wherein he is extended. That is to say the formof man is projected from there. The figure of Evestands in Malkuth in the form of the Supporter. Thefirst ideal form of the Man is in Adam Kadmon,behind the Kether form and, and as it were, the prototype of the Tiphareth form.This Tiphareth answers to the letter VAU of the Holy name, as representing thePrince. The letter VAU also represents the number six, and Adam was created onthe Sixth Day, for Tiphareth is a symbol of the Creation. Furthermore, theHexagram consists of the two symbols of Fire and water:- that is the ideal Fire andthe ideal Water; the Spirit of the water of Creation; the Spiritual Ether and theEtheral Fire (the Fire of the Holy. Spirit). Thus the Creation of the Man is extendedfrom Tiphareth, i.e. the moment Adam is created, the beginning of the reflection ofthe lower Triad, and finally, of Malkuth.Eve is the sythesis of creation and represents the Mother of Life, as the nameChaVaH is. The 3 = 8 diagram thus represents the establishment of life , i.e., createdlife, and the Good and Evil is represented in malkuth, and it is the Tree ofKnowledge of Good and Evil because it is the balanced point between Good andEvil: for in the material body we are placed to give the victory to which we will.hence the significance of the word of the Serpent, 'Ye shall be as Gods, knowingGood and Evil'. But the knowledge of Evil brought with it the descent into theQlippoth, and although Malkuth is directly involved in the Fall, the Sephirothimmediately above cannot be actually said to have entered into the Knowledge ofEvil. Therefore in the allegorical account of the Creation of Genesis, it is said thatMan is checked from putting forth his hand to take the Tree of Life, so as not toinvolve the higher Sephiroth in the Fall, which, (he being unbalanced in himself)would only have precipitated disaster'.The grip and grand word of this grade are to make the candidate more aware of what has justhappened on the subtle levels and tries to impart, to him or her, the secret or hidden aspect of thispart of the ceremony.The candidate is then taken to the Water Tablet and he stands in the Sephirah of Malkuth andis protected by the Godform of Nepthys. This is the first direct introduction of the candidate to theWater Tablet. The King of the Tablet links directly into the Ruach of the Candidate and reinforces itwith the Enochian current of Ave.The showing of the next two diagrams to the candidate still comes under the influence ofNephthys.

Those of you have read my books in the GoldenDawn series, will find that is simply not the case. Mainly due to the efforts ofMrs. Felkin, many lectures were writtenthat were tailor trade for a particular grade level and were combined with Golden Dawn originals and then made intoa compothensive structure. This, in my opinion, was for more adequate than what was given out in some of theearlier Golden Dawn temples, though I would also stress that this applies to the Outer Order of the Stella Matutinaonly.It is also interesting to compare the Z-5 series with the rituals as published by Israel Regardie, in both hisoriginal publications on the subject. I have tried to include all the diagrams given in the rituals and one will find bycomparison that there were a great deal missing in Regardie's publications. I had hoped that when Regardiepublished the 'Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic' that all of the diagrams for the grades would be includedbut unfortunately that was not done for various reasons, and the student still did not have the full rituals, a position Ihave tried to rectify with the Z-5 series.In the Bristol Temple, hi England, much information on the ritual diagrams was pruned out and submittedlater to some students as additional knowledge lectures. This was, I feel, a vital error by Bristol (which did not happenat Whare Ra temple in New Zealand) for diagrams, lilce tilR, have power, and when charged with the added benefitof ritual do give an added boost to the ceremonies. When studying these diagrams at a later stage, and without thebenefit of ritual their effect is somewhat blunted and ineffectual. Quite often, when acting in the position ofHerophant, I have seen diagrams affect the magnetic charge of the subtle bodies. Some years ago, when practisingone of the Outer Order rituals, the person taking part as the candidate was presented in front of a diagram and herentire area glowed a light green colour that was visible to everyone in the room This, of course, shows the moreblatant effect ofgeometric patterns but there is also a more subtle one as well that is not so dramatic but is just as longlasting. I have not gone into the Ball effects each diagram has when presented to the candidate in ritual, as this in itselfwould take many more years of study by many different Golden Dawn groups to put a correct perspective on them,and I have presented mainly my own viewpoint. It would be fair to say that the total effect of the diagrams has notbeen filly evaluated and will take many more years to do so. When working with Golden Dawn ritual one iscontinually finding out more information as to what exactly makes it tick The Z-5 series is merely but one step in thatdirection and no doubt more information will be discovered by those who continually practice the rituals over theyears. Many years ago when I was first initiated into the Golden Dawn (under its New Zealand name 'Emerald oftheSeas') I was told that if I persevered with ritual it would be film peering the layers of a onion, with more informationresulting from more awareness, ofwhat happened around one during ritual hi many ways the New Zealand templeWhere Ra was a proving ground for this type of research as this temple stood longest, from 1912 until 1978. Assome of the early adepts progressed through ritual they started taking notes which would be closely allied to the Zdocuments. It was rather surprising to us when we found so much information on ritual experiences which went forbeyond the original Mailers concepts. If I have learnt anything in the Golden Dawn system it is to keep an openmind.When Mathers created the rituals, and some ofthe explanations that went with the them, the Z 1-3, he did nothave time to study the rituals for any lengthy period or The did then we have not seen all his work. When he placed aGodform in a certain position in ritual, to produce a desired effect, it is only now becoming apparent how big a stepthat was. I have come to the conclusion that certain Godforms have a fife oftheir own and while they are directed toperform a task, which they will do in ritual, they also bring along ALL the power associated with them, both positiveand negative. It is rather surprising to see the effect of one Godform on another, during ritual, when they areactivated This is an area that is crying out for more work to be done on though it would take a number of years ofobservations by a number of members ofGolden Dawn temples to study this aspect in any depth.Due to the complexity of Golden Dawn ritual, the commentaries on the openings of each of the four318"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Elemental grades have been approached from four different types of viewpoints, and I would suggest that thetheories behind the opening ceremonies of the other three elemental grades be studied with this in mind. Byapproaching each grade level from a different perspective, it is hoped that new ideas will emerge to those Chiefs inexisting temples and those that one day will be chiefs of temples in the fixture, all of whom can build on the meagreeffort created in the Z 5 series. In some ofthe Grade books I have gone into one area in great detail while in others ithas been glossed over. This is mainly due to the fact that certain aspects of some rituals are more important thansimilar aspects of another. To filly understand this concept all five of the Z5 books must be studied alongside eachother. This final book in the Z 5 series has concentrated more on clairvoyant analysis than have previous books.I have always Worked to a simple format in ritual analysis. The first is to study the general background theritual relates to - the energy of the Sephiroth and Planet (including astrological eacts). The second is to study theenergy patterns on the temple floor. The third step is to consider the Godforms in the ritual, their function andrelationships with each other (this includes Qlippothic elements as wet) The fourth step is to study the effect ofdiagrams, sighsand props used in the ritual. The fifth step is to study, through clairvoyant analysis, what exactly ishappening to the subtle bodies at certain important points in the ritual and amalgamate all the previous steps together.Many of you will note that in the previous books Chris and I have written, we have opted for explanations ofperfonnarre in ritual and its effect in terms of the Subtle Body anatomy, rather than ofthe Kabbalistic Soul (althoughwe have not totally clone away with this framework). The reason for this is, I think, twofold. The first is that bothChris and I are Radionics practitioners, and deal with the subtle body and chalcra energies on a daily basis and aremore at ease in this area. The second is that the early descriptions of the 'Cabbalistic Soul are extremely limited whenhying to explain the complexity of finial have no doubt that the Soul of the Kabbalists and the Subtle bodies are, ineffect, one and the same, but when explaining this from a scientific viewpoint, the Kabalistic Soul explanations canindeed be lost in a type of vagueness that is confusing. At Whare Ra temple in New Zealand, Mrs. Felkin started toexplain things in tents of the subtle bodies, as did our mentor Jack Taylor, and we have picked up the ball, so tosPeak-Much ofthe information given in this book, and the previous books on the Z5 series, contains explanations ofthe rituals fiom the to the 7=4 grade teachings of the New Zealand Order. The reader will find all of thispresented in one fill package. I was recently asked how much of what is in these books should be studied in theOuter Order of existing temples. This is of course up to the discretion of the individual temple Chiefs and their owngrade structuresi feel there are two ways to approach this. The first is that the student in the Outer Order is taught afull knowledge of Subtle Anatomy possibly at the very beginning of their training, then given a very thoroughexaminatiOn on each grade level.In this instance a large portions ofthe previous Inner Order material now becomes Outer Other, and the InnerOrder lectures and grade level can be reduced greatly. I would stress that it would take many years of study to get tothe 5.-5 using this method. Almost three or four times the length of time one would normally take to reach 55because of the vast amount of study involved. The second method is to approach it like Mathews did in the oldGolden Dawn. An Adeptus Minor, was never given a paper explaining the 1=10 grade until the Practicus AdeptusMoor level (included as part of the 'Seven Branch Candle Stick' paper). The Adepti did not have the ritual,explanations of all the Elemental Grades until the fifth level ofthe (Adeptus Adeptus).When the Adepti advanced to the 6=5 and 7=4 level, explanations were still given out on portions of theOuter Order rituals. I am refening here to the papers ofthe AO under Mathers, and not the Stella Mainline.At present, within the New Zealand Order, we use the concept that what has been presented in the Z5 seriesmust be known very thoroughly in the various levels of the 55 grade. By that I mean, the magical effect thatGodfonns and their function have must be known. The effect of what subtle anatomy and chains are utilised as wellas the explanation ofthe diagrams and their positioning must also be studied in depth All ofthis takes a great deal oftime to study and while I do not personally care in what grade it is learned I do care about when it should be known -when one is a fullOne ofthe greatest problems that a modem day Temple Chieffaces is the sheer amount of occult material thatis being published Some of it is very good and some of it is rubbish When one is trying to steer a student on apreplanned study course it is inevitable that questions will be asked why one does something this way and not anotherway. In many respects I sympathise with the philosophy of the late Bruce Lee who also told his students that 'The319"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"usefulness of a cup is in its emptiness.'- meaning that one must get rid of old preconceptions and be willing to listenand learn with a teacher about new concepts. I also have no doubt that there are some teachers out there who wishthat I had never written the Z5 series for much the same reason. It must be considered that the additional papersthat I have published that go with each grade are severely dated by today's standards. I would not totally write themoff as something of a curiosity, as there are still a few gems hi each of them that an enquiring mind could expand onmore. The problem which modem temples fire is what to do with some of this dated material. I would suggest tothese Golden Dawn Chiefs that they still be studied with a view to being updated by the individual studera as a fonnof exercise. Modern temples, like the old ones, will continuously give new lectures and suggest a number ofboolcs toread additional to these I have given here, and that is proper, because the Golden Dawn did not stop at 1900, norwith the closure of Wham Ra in 1978. With the new strides in awareness, the modem Golden Dawn temple musttake full advantage of this new deluge of literature but still be discerning enough to sift the wheat from the chaff forthe sake ofthe students.A good example of this new progressive type of thinkng is that of the Ra-Horaldty Golden Dawn Temple,Washington State, U.S.A, which is run by Laura Jennings - Yorke and her husband Peter. They include the oldconcepts but also work on what a student needs in today's world. Alchemy is featured quite significantly in this gradeand I feel that students should, where possble, attempt this. If one does not have a teacher or access to any course onAlchemy I have no hesitation in recommending the 'Practical Handbook of Plant Alchemy' by Manfred Junis which-is written in a style that almost anyone can get started on easily enough, and with no previous laboratory experienceother than common sense. In the Inner Order of the Golden Dawn there is an alchemical ritual in the Z 2 papers. Thephilosophy in the New Zealand Order is that a student can do all the practical alchanical work he or she likes in the-Outer Order, but once in the Inner Order the Adept must be able to blend the practical with the Z2 method of ritual.This is but one example where new insights can be added to Outer Order study. The use of crystals is another newarea that can be studied in depth in the Outer Order as well Divination in almost any form will help the studentstimulate the psychic frailties as welL I might also suggest the study of some Eastern doctrines, the Bhagavad -Gitaas one such example, that will help the student open up to newer dimensions ofoonsciousness.Most Golden Dawn authorities are well aware of the lack of Eastern philosophy in the teachings other thanthe Tatwas and Yogic breathing In this book I have given a great deal on the Eastern subtle body and chakra theory(much of which has now proven to be correct under laboratory conditions) simply because any other explanation ofwhat was happening would not suffice. Long before I became a Golden Dawn student, I was immersing myselfdeeply in Indian philosophy in the 1960's, on an ashram outside ofPondicherry, in India. This, I feel, gave me a broadbase to work on which I later added to when I studied the I-Ching and Tai Chi, and which in turn helped me someyears later into assimilating Taoist concepts, when studying of the Golden Dawn philosophy I mention all thisbecause when we think of the Golden Dawn, we must number that it was made up from a multitude ofphilosophies from different periods of time. Many of these philosophies run a parallel course with some of theirEastern counterparts. As such, some of the teachings of other Eastern philosophies and religions (when compatible)could be studied in conjunction with the Golden Dawn teaching This would help improve the students scope ofvision and therefore they would not feel that they are totally isolated in one particiular type ofpackaged teaching.My old, mentor from Whare Ra, Jack Taylor, always told me that 'all teachings are one teaching' and thatMallets should have finished the job of tieing in more of the Eastern philosophies to the Order's teachings that hestarted in the Golden Dawn manuscript 'Book of General Carespondences'(Tbis was published as '777', withadditional documentation by Altrister Crowley.). To give Crowley his due, he also recognised the point of mergingsome ofthe East-West traditions, and made excellent work of gap bridging them togetherA would hasten to add thatI would pick and choose some ofthe Eastern doctrines very carefully and not embrace the Eastern archetype systemas freely as I would the Egyptian, Hebraic and Greek ones. If there is a line to draw, I feel, it is here in the archetypalsystem. I saw this proved over and over again in India when Western students with Christian or Jewish upbringingstried to come to grips with the Eastern deities such as Kali during meditation. Some overcame this problem, but amajority did not. ,For those ofyou who are familiar with what was taught in the Golden Dawn and Stella Matutina temples, youwill find that there were three lectures for the 47 Grade at Whare Ra that have been omitted from this book Thefast is the one on 'Polygons and Polygrams' which I gave in the 2=J book when the diagram of these Linear figureswas first introduced to the candidate The second is on the actions ofthe Qlippoth which is also presented in the 34320"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"book - where I It it was needed more. A full paper on this subject will appear in the 1Cabbalah of the GoldenDawn.' Apart from these two papers, the reader will have exactly what was given at Whare Ra for the 4=7 Grade.There is a third paper on the tarot that was also given out at 4=7 but I would refer the readers to the forthcomingbook ( The 'Magical Tarot ofthe Golden Dawn' by Pat and Chris Zalewski) which more than adequately caters forthis tarot study at this level There are also bound to be the odd paper written fir the Golden Dawn, and later theStella Matutina, by various temples, and at different periods, that we could not find and subsequently have notproduced in this text, but this book would definitely have the bulk ofthem.I would point out that when one studies a magical text there are usually plenty of other existing texts that canhelp explain things more filly. At Whare Ra, Mrs Felkin stated on a minter of occasions that the essence of theteachings given in Alice Bali's books was very similar to the teachings she had received from her guides. Sayingthis, I would suggest that anyone who wishes to study the actions of the Salamanders, and their effects on variouslevels, should read Bailey's book 'Treatise on Comic Fre', which goes into the subject fir more than the smallWhare Ra paper does.Also, I would point out that although I have given some detailed information in the commentary on theRituals, there is gall a great deal that has to be evaluated. Another problem faced within the Golden Dawn is theperception ofthe various levels and dimensions that exist beyond us. The Kabbalists Wise four (and sometimes five)levels, yet the Order papers on Tatvas dearly show that even within the physical World of &slah alone there are atleast five levels, each level corresponding with a Tatva (The works ofBailey and Blavatsky speak of seven sub-planesin the material world- Assialt). Classical Hindu documents show us that there are in fact more Tatvas above thestandard five. In the various planes above the physical each ofthese states has an incorporeal counterpart.I mention all this because elsewhere while in the Z series, I have desated certain ritual effects as Ttheric' innature, yet there are at least four levels of this matter, each with its own distinct linction. It will take a great deal ofwork, and many more years to correctly study the various levels and their connection with ritual, though the Z series,Mel, is a step in the right direction. In future years, others will be able to build on the work Chris and I have startedhere.Regardie told me years ago that he wanted to publish the Golden Dawn material so that it would not perishand he would be happy if but only one book survived. In my own case I have thought the same, but also wanted toplace at the disposal ofthe reader the word ofmouth teachings from Whare Ra. In many respects Chris and I met theex-Whare Ra members at the fight time, just when Whare Ra closed. Ifwe had come too early or too late they I feel,we would not have got the information that is now imparted in our books on the Golden Dawn. We were notbound by oaths, as some Golden Dawn members we because Taylor reworded them to be up to the dictates ofour own conscience.Another reason why the Z series was written is because I have found that even in temples of 'Apostolicsuccession' -Err want of a better tenn, some advocate changes to the rituals without fully understanding them. I havetried to explain the 'why' of things so that if any one decides to make a change he or she is well aware of whysomething was done as it was originally I have been also informed that in one or two Golden Dawn temples the Z-5books have opened up new layers to peopl regardless of the rank they hekl. For this I am pleased and as long asanything I write makes people think, then I have, in part, accomplished what I set out to do.When I first met Regardie back in 1983, he hoped that Chris and I would start teaching further afield so thatwhat we had learned would not die with us, or with those in our little temple. We both told him then that we felt wenot att out to be teachers and that by teaching the Golden Davvn directly to people we would end up doing so do soto a certain type of exclusive btmch, and with all those other people who wanted the information missing out. Both ofus felt that the hi-fighting which exists in the Order Order to-day would prevent one Temple from working withanother and as area*, only those we worked with closely would benefitI realised that the only way to overcome this type of thing taking place in the future was to write on ourexperiences, and what we had learnt, and this anyone interested enough, could simply read about them without thepersonality clashes of Chiefs getting infix way.In the Golden Dawn proper, there were a series of side lectures for this grade:1.GeomanticTaliamans.2.Tree ofLife in the Tarot.3.

When I went through the Fire Grade my mentor, friend and teacher, JackTaylor told me that the previous level of Practicus is the one that starts to stir the Fire Elementwithin and the Philosphus level is but an expansion of it. I have found, possibly that one of the bestways to equate to the Elemental grades is through Alchemical symbolism and its psychologicalcorrespondences. Using only the elemental descriptions to describe the actions of the variousGrades are in reality, not enough to fully appreciate what occurs in the various parts of thetransmutation process. An example of this, is that alchemists tell us that there are four degrees ofFire. The first being slow and mild. The second being moderate and temperate, the third being moredirect, the four and last being the fusion process. All of these relate to varous alchemical steps,depending on the school of alchemy one follows. All of these steps relate to what the candidateswill go through when they take this grade. Each of the steps may apply to different students and insome cases all four levels will be experienced; this simply depends on the makeup of the individual.Although it was never talked about openly in the Golden Dawn, the Fire grade also workeddirectly on the sex drive. Some years ago, when talking about the grades to a number of elderlymembers of Whare Ra, I was surprised to find out that the Fire grade had a direct effect on theirsexual respones to their partners, and their own view of sexuality. All of them found that anyinadequacies in this area were greatly enhanced or completely shut down, again depending on thepsychological makeup of the individual. My own personal researches into this area took anotherdirection. As a practising Radionic Therapist, I tended to look at things more from an energy levelthan from something deeply psychological. In other words, if there were blockages in the subtlebodies or the erratically spinning chakras then that, in my opinion, would produce the psychologicalstate of the Fire Grade of Philosophus. I would stress, though, that this is but one approach that Iuse as a type of yardstick, the alchemical considerations are equally as valid.In the previous books on the Elemental grades I have not delved deeply into the concept ofcertain grades affecting certain chakras, but in this case, however, the Fire Grade equates verynicely with the base chakra, where the vital Kundaline energy is stored. In my previous books onthe grade ceremonies I have tried to approach each grade from a different viewpoint, wherepossible, to show how a certain level of the Outer Order grades can be interpreted. There is nodoubt that the other Elemental grades also effect various chakras, but the Philosophus grade mustprepare the lcundaline energy for its eventual release. As a result of this, I have often found erraticbehaviour even in the most down to earth individuals when they go through this level. Some of theprevious grades affect the chakras, like peeling the layers off an onion. Certain sheaths are removedwhich prepare the chakras to receive the energy of the Kundaline so that when it is raised it doesnot burn out the protective sheaths and produce psychotic behaviour. The four layers or degrees ofheat used by the alchemist are ideally described, for they represent the four major sheaths aroundthe base chakra. Each sheath is shown as a petal when looking at an Eastern diagram of thechakras. When the Kundaline energy rises it will go through one of these sheaths, depending onwhich are opened. This explains why there are so many different experiences involved with thisenergy when experienced both in and out of ritual.Possibly one of the best books on the subject of Fire and its esoteric significance is AliceBailey's 'Treatise on Cosmic Fire.' When I first went through the Fire Grade, Taylor suggested Idigest this book (all 1364 pages of it). Though I do not uphold all the teachings of Bailey and herTibetan Master D.K. I still find I can get a great deal out of it and would suggest that others studythis text as well. From these teachings we start to see the many different functions that the FireGrade represents on the subtle planes. It would be fair comment to say that each of the otherelemental grades also have a significance equally as important as the Salamanders as described byBailey. I would also stress that while books like these, that reveal the teachings of different Masters,323"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"are extremely helpful they are still, nevertheless, highly subjective. Taking the teachings of EdgarCayce as an example, which differ from Bailey's, they cannot both be right, yet in both. there arestill gems of infinite truth. However, It is up to the individudal to get out of these teachingswhatever they are looking for.Jack Taylor always taught that the Fire Grade of Philosophus was the 'Dynamic Mover'grade. In other words it made things happen on both superficial and the deep subtle levels and had atendency to over-amplify things whether positive or negative. My own research through radionicshas also shown that in the physical, the Fire Grade affects the Gonads, which can release certainhormones into the system, produced by a direct effect on the base chakra. The Fire grade wasalways a grade of purification where transformation took over and equated the alchemical fourthstate of the reddening, when the salts have been purified over a long process and over a constantheat just before they are imbibed back into the elixer to give it a stronger bonding. In many waysthe body's energy patterns perform a similiar function when going through this period. Taylor madethis comment about the Fire Grade:`Anyone who went through the Philosophus Grade at Whare Ra knew that theywere being prepared for something but were generally unsure of exactly what. Veryfew of us in the 4=7 knew about the Second Order, or those of us who did, knewnothing about it. Back in the early 1930's I had never read any of either Crowley'sor Regardie's books and they were almost unobtainable out here in New Zealand.Though I later found that some members of the Second Order did have them sentout from England, but nevertheless they were not available to us and the rituals weregiven to us as they were meant to be, without foreknowledge of their contents: Thewait between the Fire Grade and the Portal was very important to me and preparedme in many ways for the energies of the Second Order. I also have known some thathave dropped out at the 4=7 level yet after a while had many experiences that onewould account with the rising of the Kundaline. The 5=6 was of course was done sothat this energy could be raised safely, but at the 4=7 it sometimes happened to riseand pre-empted the 5=6 a number of times, which in my opinion showed the limitsof the Daemonstrators who were supposed to be monitoring all this.'SYMBOLISM OF THE TEMPLEAbove the Dais are the three Hebrew letters of Shin, Tau and Qoph which forms a triadconnected to Malkuth, the first Elemental Grade. Each of these three paths touches each of the fourelemental grades. This shows the direct route of access to these levels, the final being Qoph whichthe candidate has yet to travel. The Pentagram which hangs beneath it alludes to the Sephirah ofMalkuth which incorporates all the elements and spirit in its sphere of influence. The white lightabove it shows the divine spirit above matter. The placing of the Banner of the East in its positionhas a multifaceted purpose. The main inference in this instance is that it reflects the Light of theHierophant, which its stands beside. The Banner of the West is beside the Hiereus and shows theopposite reflection of Light and Darkness. It is placed here so that the Hiereus who guards theQlippoth will not let them enter.Three inverted blue cups beside the Hierophant, Hegemon and Hiereus represent the invertedtriangle of the Water Element associated with the 18th Tarot Key the 'Moon'. This key representsthe Mutable Water Element through its astrological association. The two candles each side of thealtar represents the symbology of the two watchtowers on the 18th Key. Beneath the tarot trumpthe symbolism of the altar shows the triangle above the cross, signifying the sacred purifying fireabove the elements. The Two pillars are placed beneath the Hebrew letter Qoph, the 29th Path, andshow the Portals that the candidate must enter through. There are four Enochian tablets present.

The arrangement of the astrological symbols isimportant. The crossbar of the calvary cross has the fourfixed signs arranged in the Order of the name YOD HEHVAU HEH. These Hebrew letters also represent the fourdivisions of the River Eden, Phison, Gihon, Hiddekel andPhrath. The River Eden represents Life itself, which is thegreat stream from which we inacamate from and go to afterdeath. The four divisions symbolise truth, yet there aremany options of the truth to take, hence the divisions andthe state of the soul. Eden itself stands for the Tipharethcentre where the development of the Ego is conceivedthrough imagination. The four divisons surrounding it areGeburah for the Will, Chesed for Memory, Hod for Reasonand Netzach for Desire. Together these represent the vitalcomponent of the Kabbalistic soul called the Ruach.The Long vertical angle of the cross has the zodiacalsigns in their natural order of progression, minus the fixedsigns. This represents Eden itself, the never ending conceptof Shekinah, the indwelling glory which represents the vitalYehidah, Chiah and Neshamah.Serpent of Brass: In Numbers 21.6.-9, we are told of the curative powers of the Serpent of Brass which Moses raisedabove the heads of the Children of Israel. Anyone bitten by a serpent who looked upon this Bronze325"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Serpent lived.The symbology of this is adequately explained in the ritual, though some years ago Iapproached Taylor to help me delve deeper into this symbolism.`The Serpent in this symbolism must touch all the paths of the Tree of Life and that to mymind is the most important aspect of the symbolism. The Bible tells us that the Jews had to gazeupon it to be saved but the esoteric meaning of this is that they had to understand the way of theSerpent. This was necessary, for all the trials and tribulations they had gone through, otherwisetheir sacrifice was for nought. Moses was trying to tell them that they had to obey the rules orperish.Within the Order, the Serpent shows us the Way through balance and harmony but that wasand is never easy. The book `Aesch Mezareph' (Purifying Fire) tells us that Brass expresses thefiery nature of Geburah. This also applies to the desires of man, the Kundaline energy rising fromthe desires of the flesh, Netzach.The Jews had to understand, as anyone must who follows the Path of Light, that one musttake things one level at a time, following the trail of the Serpent.'Personally, I agree with Taylor's explanation of the Kundaline concept in this instance, for theSerpent of Brass shows us the rising of this energy through an established framework - The Tree.You will note that there are no paths on this diagram and only the ten Sephiroth.Over two decades ago, while waiting for a train in an Indian railway station outside ofPondicherry, I was with my Tantric teacher Vivandatta. He introduced me to an old man who sat inthe sun reciting mantrams. During the course of the conversation he told us that in his youth he hadthe Kundaline rise when he was shown a snake like diagram by his master. Vivandatta told me thatthis was possible and occurred even in group situations as there were a number of precedents inIndian literature, also even in the West, and he cited the mysterious lights of Fatima as one suchexample.Whenever I study this diagram, I often think back to that old railway station in India, andthat red and golden diagram that the old man showed both of us (which was a serpententwined amongst the seven points of a Hexagram without the connecting lines and which)was the catalyst of his illumination.Kabbalah of 9 Chambers: The following explanation is taken from WynWestcott's 'Introduction to the Study of theKabbalah.' , which was used as an unofficial type ofKnowledge lecture on the Literal Kabbalahrepresented by the diagram of the `Kabbalah of theNine Chambers':`The Literal Qabalah is referred to in severalplaces, and therefore a knowledge of its leadingprinciples is necessary. it is divided into three parts:GMTRIA, Gematria; NVTRIQVN, Notariqon: andThMVRH, Temura.GEMATRIA was a mode of interpretation bywhich a name or word having a certain numericalvalue was deemed to have a relation with someother words having the same number; thus certainnumbers became representative of several ideas, andwere considered to be interpretative one of theother. For example, Messiah spelled MShICh,numbered 358 and so does the phrase IBA ShILH,Shiloh shall come; and so this passage in Genesis 49v.10, was considered be a prophecy of the Messiah:326,"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"note that Nachash NChSh, the Serpent of Moses, is also 358/ The letter Shin, Sh, 300, became anemblem of divinity by corresponding with Ruach Elohim. RUCh ALHEM, the Spirit of the LivingGod.NOTARICON, or abbreviation, is of two forms, one word is formed from the initial and finalletters of one or more words, or the letters of one name are taken as the initials or finals of thewords of a sentence. For example, in Deut. 30 v. 12, Moses asks 'Who shall go up for us toHeaven?' The initial letters of the original words MI IOLH LNV HShMILH, form the word MILH,mylah, which means circumcision, and the final letters are IHVH, the name Jehovah: hence it wassuggested that circumcision was a feature of the way to God in heaven.Amen, AMN, is from the initials of Adonai melekh namen. 'The Lord and the faithful king.'; andthe famous Rabbinic word of power used for talismans AGLA is formed of the initials of the words`Ateh gibur leolam Adonai.' `The Lord ever powerful,' or `Tu patens in soeculum Domine.'TEMURA is a more complex procedure, and has led to an immense variety of curious modesof divination: the letters of a word are transposed according to certain rules with many limitations:or again, the letters as arranged by a definite scheme, often shown in a diagram. For example, acommon form was to write one half of the alphabet over the other in reverse order, and so that thefirst letter A was, placed by the last T, and B by Shin, and so on. On this plan the word Shesnak ofJeremiah 12v. 26, is said to mean babel: this permutation was known as ATBSh. On this principlewe find twenty-one other possible forms named in order ALbat, Abgat: the complete set was called`The combination of Tziruph.' other forms were rational, right, averse and irregular, obtained froma square of 22 spaces in each direction, that is of 484 secondary squares, and then putting a letter ineach square in order up and down, and then reading across or diagonally, etc. Of this type is the so-called `Kabbalah of the of Nine Chambers' of theMark Masons.A further development of the numerical artswas shown by the modes of Contraction andExtension; thus Jehovah, IHVH 26, was extendedto IVD-HA-VV-HA and so 10, 5, 6, 5 or 26became 20, 6, 12, 6, or 44. By extension Zain, z.7, became 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7 or 28; or 28 wasregarded as 2 and 8 or 10. The Tetragrammaton,Jehovah 26 was also at times regarded as 2 and 6or 8: so El Shaddai, God Almighty. Al ShDI, 1,30, 300, 4, 10, was 345 then 12 then 3, a trinity.A quaint conceit was that of the change ofspelling of the names of Abraham and Sara: atfirst Abram ABRM and Sari ShRI, becameABRAM and ShRH: they were 100 and 90 yearsold and were sterile: now H, Heh, was deemed ofa fertile type, and so the letter H was added toABRAM, and the Yod I, converted into an H ofthe name SARAI.Tarot in the Tree of Life: The Tarot applied to the Tree of Life isrelatively straightforward enough, with oneexception being the placing of the Court Cardsbeside the Sephiroth of Chokmah, Binah,Tiphareth and Malkuth.I have always felt that this exception was anover-simplification and in the original GoldenDawn lectures on the tarot the Court Cards are327"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"given in a separate diagram to that of the main Tree. The Court cards are applied to the Partsufimtheory of the Kabbalah and not to the Tree of Life itself. The basis for the Partsufim theory is in thesmall skeletonic format of the Fifth Knowledge lecture. Mathers in fact went into great detail aboutthis subject and devoted a whole book to it, `Kabbalah Unveiled.' The Patsufim theory actuallyexists outside the Tree of Life and is in fact a different dimension from it.The Three Columns:Within the Golden Dawn, the reference to the Pillarsof Jachin and Boaz may appear at first glance to relate toactual people but this is but a blind, for these names aremerely representative or certain forces.Taking the first name Jachin as an example. This infact is made of two root names. Jah, for `Yehovah', andachin 'to establish' which relates to God establishing hishouse (Solomon's Temple in Israel). The word Boaz isbroken down into b, meaning 'in', and oaz, 'strength'which relates to strength being established. A third pillar isintroduced in the ritual of this path with the emblem of thehexagram, the point of unification of the two extremes ofWater and Fire. This relates to Tiphareth, the Sephiroth ofBeauty and balance between the extremes, being the onlyway that one can enter the temple of God.These three Pillars are also representative of thethree phases of the Kabbalistic Soul. Only when theNeshamah, Ruach and Nephesch are untited can one haveaccess to the teachings of the Higher Mysteries. In the`Lesser Ritual of the Hexagram' we are told to vibrate the wordARARITA (when tracing the two different triangles) which stands for`One is his Beginning: One is his Individuality: His Permutation is one.'This tells us that there are many entranceways to many houses, yet alllead to that one vital truth that we seek. This is in the three fold natureof the Trinity.I have actually found this diagram fascinating and have used it agreat many time for meditational purposes. If used this way it opens upmore layers within the Self. For those of you who wish to try thismethod, then simply place the diagram in front of you and projectyourself into it, taking the place of the central pillar. Rather than talkabout my experiences with this diagram in this meditational concept Isuggest you try it for your self.Geomantic Talismans:This method of talisman construction was shown in FrancisBarrett's the 'Magus' in which geomantic symbols had lines drawn onthem so that a number of various symbols could be obtained from theone geomantic figure. The talismatic geomantic figure on the right isRubeus which related to Mars and and the Sign of Scorpio. Thetalisman on the right relates to both Rubeus and Puer which is yetanother figure that was sometimes considered evil.The origin of showing this talisman here comes from the GoldenDawn Cipher manuscripts which Mathers copied and elaborated on.The author of the ciphers had the figures of both Rubeus and Amisso(which the Mathers changed to Puer). Mathers apparently wanted topresent this Mars talisman (on a Luna path) as 'a reflection of the328"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Sphere of Mars' due to its fiery disposition. Also this relates as a further representation of the twintowers on the Lunar Key of the tarot which is again symonomous with the barking dogs each sideof the path, the negative aspects of this trump. In the cipher drawings, the use of Amisso relatedback to the negative aspect of things lost, especially love. This actually fits in with the Tarot Key ofthe Moon. All things considered, I would personally have preferred to have left things as they were,which I think is much more clearer and to the point. I have noticed on more than one occasion thatsome of the diagrams present on the Path quite often show an abstract concept as shown in therelated Tarot Trumps.Diagrams of the 28th PathThe Admission Badge-Pyramid of the Elements. The Pyramid of the Elements is the first diagramthat shows the combined elements and spirit. To anumber of you it will bear a startling resemblanceto the Enochian Pyramid system of the InnerOrder. The following extract was taken from adiscussion I had one night with with somemembers of the Thoth Hermes temple, back in1982, on this diagram, which I believe is worthpresenting here:`Although the Admission Badge for the28th Path represents a pyramid, the implicationsof what it represents are quite subtle. The bodyand structure of the pyramid is, of course, relatedto the Mountain of Abiegnus or the Mountain ofInitiation, though this is presented in ageometrical format. The base is, of course manand the physical body. Each of the triangular sidesof the pyramid relates to an element, which is theclimbing of the mountain; each of these elementsmust be absorbed and conquered before going onto the next. When this is done one then goes upthrough the top of the pyramid - spirit or essence.This relates to the absorbtion and understandingof the essence of self through the Alpha etOmega, the beginning and the end. For life now begins again for the adept as he works hisway through an entirely different framework of beliefs.The Pyramid can also be viewed as a flat surface, when seen from the top. I would refer youto the work of Professor Tucci, who wrote in his book 'Theory and Practice of theMandala.' about the mandala (for this is what the pyramid is) being a concept ofreintegration with the self In many respects this is exactly what happens and when viewedfrom a meditational standpoint, the pyramid forms a life of its own and draws the psycheinto the framework and lets it work through the geometric patterns.A simplified method of understanding this properly is to treat each of the sections separatelyand each of the Hebrew letters as miniature forms of energy. For example, take the word Eth-Essence. When viewed with the Hebrew lettering, it becomes a second aspect of the nature of bothman and spirit. It forces us to look deeper in our selves and consider exactly what Essence is .When I first sat down and meditated on this pyramid I originally took notes of myimpressions - as opposed to Astral work, and after a number of sessions built up a small fileon what I considered this pyramid meant to me. I suggest that you all do the same. Take asection at a time, work clockwise and gradually finish at the centre. The whole process can329"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"be described in one word -therapy!Each individual must make his or her own observations and work directly with the pyramid.I very much doubt if Mathers or the Golden Dawn initially used this diagram for thispurpose- but I have followed my own instincts here, and utilised them in the way I wastrained in India. I feel that with this method of meditational approach a new dimension ofmeaning opens up to us. I might add that what I have found so far, is that by going througheach section separately, it tends to 'balance one up' for want of a better turn of phrase. Isuggest that all of you who are now at this level, spend a few minutes or more, each day fora week, on a regular basis, and meditate on exactly what you think this pyramid means. Asan integration concept it is very personal to you. I used to work on this for about a weeksolid, then give it a break for a few weeks, then come back to it again at a later stage.'Holy Name in the Four WorldsThe teachings of this diagram relate to theinstructions of Rabbi Yitzchak Luria who wasaffectionately called the 'Ari'. The teachings given here were originally given by the Ari to hisselected students in a set of volumes called the 'Eight Gates'. The student is required to meditateon the name of each world. The object of this exercise is to bring a union of Chiah, Neshamah,Ruach and Nephesch. As one mediates on each name, it is visualised and repeated the samenumbers of times as the number of the World one is meditating on. One then goes on to the nextname and so on. In the terminology of subtle bodies, the meditations produce a strong magneticresonance that aligns all the subtle bodies.The correct way of visualisation (starting at Atziluth) is to split up the first name YHVH thenAHIH then unify the two, YAHHVYHH, then the name that brings them together (which is YHVHexpanded by additional Yods) which is reduced to AUB.Taking another example in the World of Yetzirah. Meditate on the words YHVH and ADNIthen unify them to YAHDVNHY. Meditate on this name and the name that unites them, MAH. Theother worlds are meditated on in similar fashion.330"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Yetziratic Symbolic Alphabet. This diagram is relatively straightforward. Taylor insisted that those who reached the 4=7grade meditate on the Hebrew name and astrological associations first thing each morning, thoughhe considered it nothing more than a familiarisation exercise.331"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Tn++.41...,+nA +n.Dln,ncht 'Clrnme'Lineal Figures attributed to the Planet 'Gans' & 'Angles' In the 2=9 grade a set of similar symbols were shown to the candidate.

I would refer the reader to that book and the associated lecture titled 'Polygonsand Polygrams'.332"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Geomantic Figures arranged in the Planetary attribution of the Tree of Life: I have always felt that the previous diagram was misplaced and better placed in the previousgrade, as would also the two previous diagrams. Mathers here placed the diagrams as they wererecorded in the Cipher manuscripts. The association is not new to the candidate for it is given out inthe Geomantic paper in the 3=8 Grade. The only real reason concession for this diagram here is thatit was a subtle hint to the candidate to use the energy and power of the Sephiroth whenconstructing a talisman with geomanticfigures on them. In some temples thisdiagram was omitted.Diagrams of the 27th pathAdmission badge: The description of this diagram isstraight forward enough and shows theSephiroth placed in the format of theCalvary Cross. In this form is the hiddenform or drawing of the ALTAR OFINCENSE.Now at this point I would refer thereaders to the 1=10 explanation of theAltar of Incense, which when examinedcarefully, describes the Altar of BurntOffering which is shown in the last phase ofthe 4=7 ritual. On referring back to theoriginal drawing of the Altar of BurntOffering, as it appeared in the ciphermanuscripts, it appears that Mathers madean error when describing the Altar ofIncense in the 1=10, and it was nevercorrected. This was further compounded by a diagram of the Altar of Burnt Offering, but wascaptioned 'Altar Of Incense' which appeared in Crowley's Equinox, and also in Mr. Torrens'sbook.It is my belief that the diagram as shown in the ciphers and the 1=10 as the Altar of BurntOffering was in fact two separate diagrams and were wrongly captioned. When viewing thediagrams of the ciphers, it is easy to see that the diagrams were copied by someone in hurry.Another point also emerges which is that the diagram of the Altar of Incense and Burnt Offeringlook nearly identical and whoever copied the ciphers made the mistake of interchanging them. Inthe 4=7 ritual, the diagram of Burnt Offering is revealed in its two forms yet its top form is the onlyone discussed. My contention is that the bottom diagram should have been the Altar of Incense. Ifthis contention is correct, then I would suggest making a change to the 1=10 ritual when thedescription of the Altar of Incense (possibly using the Biblical description) is described since it hasconfused quite a number of Golden Dawn students such as Crowley and Mathers, who wrote therituals in the first place. I was always warned by Jack Taylor and others of Whare Ra, that therewere blinds in the rituals and if it was not sloppy copying then it is definitely a blind.To the best of my knowledge, within the Golden Dawn, the Altar of Incense was nevershown. Its description is given in Exodus 37: Vs 25-29:`They made the altar of incense out of acaciawood. It was square, a cubit long and a cubitwide, and two cubits high - its horns of one piece with it. They overlaid the top and all sidesof the horns with pure gold, and made a gold moulding around it. They made two gold ringsbelow the moulding-two on opposites side-to hold the poles used to carry it. They alsomade the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.333"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"The use of acacia wood to make the altar relates the solar influence, for like the sun, acaciawood encompasses the main area where heat is emitted. It is the central point from which theCalvary cross is hinged together. The horns on each corner of the altar show the idea of the deity.These horns are analogous to the four branches of the cross of the Admission badge. The goldenoverlay of the altar shows the solar influence on the planets and elements. The four gold rings showan aspect of the name YHVH, for through him, the teachings of the Order can be carried to thosewho need it, shown by the Golden Poles over acacia.The Rev. Dr. Edershim in his book 'The Temple,'adds further insights into the Altar ofIncense:`The incense burned upon this altar was prepared of the four ingredients mentioned in Ex.xxx. 34, with which, according to the Rabbis, seven others were mixed, beside a smallquantity of `Arnbra,' and of a herb which gave out dense smoke. To these thirteensubstances salt was of course added. The mode of preparing the incense has been preservedin the family Abtinas. The greatest care was taken to have the incense thoroughly bruisedand mixed. Altogether 368 pounds were made for the years consumption, about a poundand half being used every morning and evening in the service.'In 1 Macc. i.21. We are told that the Altar was removed from the temple of Zerubbabel byAntiochus. The Golden Dawn inference being that the ALTAR OF INCENSE was hidden orremoved from the Temple for safe keeping, and assuch was never visible except through symbols.Sulphur on the Tree of Life: Of Sulphur, there are many variations, yet thecommon bonding theme for them all is that it isconsidered the Soul or guiding spirit in all formsof life, in the animal, vegetable and mineralkingdom. By isolating sulphur in the practicalsense, one in fact isolates the very essence of thePrimea Materia and as such, its outward334"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"manifestations vary greatly yet its intrinsic nature remains the same.This diagram represents the trials and tribulations of the Candidate who has been purified andenriched through suffering of the Holy Fire. Its essences can only be reached through the process ofseparation, from the grosser lower forms, shown by the lower Sephiroth. Its symbolic symbolismshows that through the sephiroth of the Tree of Life one can ascend and be purified and rebornthrough the Tiphareth centre of death and rebirth.In many respects this is a hint of things to come for the renewal of the spirit.The Lower Sephiroth form the incorporeal cross (imperfect man) of Sulphur, Sal Salfuris(Salt of the Soul) below the actual start of the material cross (perfected man). The incorporeal crossbeing analogous to man, the areas that have to be purified first. The lowest Sephirah of Malkuthshows Sulphur contained in its most densest material in the Primea Materia. It is separate, yet stilltrapped in the grosser nature of the Primea Materia. The next Sephiroth shows the next stage ofseparation - in its gaseous state. The following Sephiroth shows the watery nature removed. InNetzach we see Sulphur in its own fiery nature, it basic raw state. The Sephiroth of Tiphareth, atthe very base of the cross, is in its perfected state of readiness. The cross of Sulphur is alsoanalogous to the red cross of suffering in the 5=6 ritual, for before the lower Sephiroth, in thisinstance, can be purged of their impurities, the gap must be bridged to its Higher Form, as thecandidate does in the 5=6 oath.Though Sulphur has reached its pure state, at the base of the cross in Tiphareth, it still has anempathy with both Salt and Mercury, in their incorporeal forms, as Chesed and Geburah -as thebars of the cross. As the tip of the cross passes through the bridge in Daath and separates to formthe triangle, the incorporeal becomes corporeal, as further stronger ties are bound for Salt andMercury directly above them. Together they form the polar opposites of the base of the upwardpointing triangle. The tip or apex of the, triangle shows the Basic Life Principle in which Sulphurexists. The right hand base of the triangle shows the Conscious Intelligence, while the left handbasel angle shows the Foundation or substance on which this principle works through.If we study the 16th Key of the tarot we will find that a very important part of Sulphurconstitutes a vital part of the card. Like the Blasted Tower, Sulphur is purified and separated fromthe impurities, showed by the falling bodies, which are then purged from the main Sulphuriscompound of the Tower itself.Salt on the Tree of Life: This represents yet another aspect of theascent up the Tree of Life. It goes a stage furtherthan the previous diagram and shows the resultof the purification process. The best way to linkthese two diagrams is to look closely at the TarotKey 16, the Blasted Tower, for these twodiagrams in fact represent the hidden actions ofKey 16. The diagrams of Sulphur on the Treerepresent the Tower (note the three windowsshowing the top triangle of sulphur) itself beingpenetrated by heat to separate the purified saltsfrom the dregs or useless matter (shown by thefalling figures from the tower).In this diagram you will note that Malkuthis parted from the rest of the Tree. The reasonfor this is that Salt has first to be separated fromits grosser nature-Malkuth, before it can be anentity in itself.In the 4=7 ritual, Mathers broke Salt downinto a Higher and Lower principle, as in this335"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"diagram, and likened it to the actions of Sulphur and Mercury. The Alchemical term for the upperportion of Salt in this diagram is 'Soluble Sal Salis'. Reflected in its grossest terms it becomes theinsoluble or the Caput Mortum. The Caput Mortum is the dregs of the experiment, the left- oversor faeces, hence the Sephiroth below Tiphareth (perfection), are in fact impurities and imperfectionsleft over from the Primea Materia. Its higher form, Soluble Sal Salis, comprises the soluble Saltsthat can dissolve and be resurrected from any body, hence its analogy to the Soul, the essence ofspirit that cannot die. Like the diagram of Sulphur, the lower Sephiroth shows imperfect man andthe upper Tree shows perfected man, or what the lower aspires to. For the Salt, as the body, is theform in which the Soul and Spirit are united.Referring back to Key 16, the left hand Tree of 11 Sephiroth represents the Caput Mortumand the right hand Tree of Ten Sephiroth shoWs thePurified Soluble Salts.Falling and reflected Triangles on the Tree: I have always felt that the explanation of thisdiagram, in the ritual, was oversimplified by simplyadhering to the elemental attributions of the triangles onthe Tree. Placing this diagram in this position is quitesignificant for it directly relates it to the alchemical themeof this path. For those of you who wish to study theTriads from a Jungian concept then I suggest the booksof Z'ev Ben Shimon Halevi which open up new layers ofthe psyche.The alchemical perspective though, does manageto open up yet another layer. The whole Tree as it ispresented in this diagram represents the Circulationprocess, the constant Exaltation of a liquid throughcontinuous Dissolution, Cohobation, Digestion,Distillation and Sublimation. It is the rising and falling ofa liquid through a series of steps when heat is applied.The liquid is continuously changing from a gaseous to aliquid state then returned to gaseous again. The PrimeaMateria is raised through Malkuth when heat is appliedand it passes into its gaseous state as it rises from oneSephirah to the next until it gets to Kether then falls backdown to Malkuth (Congelation) when it goes to its liquidstate. The point of each Triad is a stage of Cohobation,that is when the Liquid is reunited with its residue.To understand this entire process I feel it isnecessary to have worked through alchemicalexperiments. In short, this diagram, if taken to itsuppermost concept shows some very importantalchemical steps and should be studied with this in mind.When applied directly to the 16th Key, this represents thehidden qualities of the Key within the Tower itself, asshown by the three windows of the towers.Diagram of the Image of Nebuchadnezzar: Nebuchadnezzar was possibly one of the greatestof the Babylonian kings who created the HangingGardens of Babylon. In Daniel 3., we are told that theNebuchadnezzar created an image of himself in gold andtold his subjects that it had to be worshipped. Schadrach,336"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Diagram of 12 Princes of the Olippoth: Meshach and Abendigo refused and were then thrown into a fiery furnace where they wereprotected from harm, and were joined by a mysterious spirit that could be seen to stay with them inthe furnace.The main point of reference here is the image that Nebuchadnezzar created was one of gold,silver, bronze with feet of clay. In this story we find the perfect alchemical principles of the previousdiagram. From clay was developed bronze then silver and gold but in fact their symbolism is selfdeceptive for it is not for riches or self grandeurment that these things were created but for thebetterment of the self. Nebuchadnezzar shows the self deception that can occur, through power,and this tells the candidate to beware. The Hot and Moist natures show that balance of thesedegrees of nature are needed before advancement through the transmutation process can begin.In the actual drawing of the Image of the King, you will note that lightning has struck theimage and a small piece has fallen from its base. Which is analogous to the lightning in Key 16. Likethe previous diagrams on this Path, each also tell astory that shows a different aspect of the 16th Key,and this diagram should be studied with this inmind.Diagram of the Seven Yetziratic Palaces in the 10Sephiroth: This diagram and its explanation are liftedalmost straight out of `Kabala Denudata', translatedby Rosenroth which in turn came from 'Book ofPardes'. The correct method of meditation on thesenames is to start with the first, on Sunday and witheach following day concentrate on each new level ofletters. The object of this is for the Ruach and theNeshamah to join or in other terms, to align all thesubtle bodies through prayer.The meditation on these letters involvesvisualising them in their respective Sephirah andconstantly repeating the words they form. The length of time spent on this is up to the individualthough I would suggest a ten minute minimum. A variation on this theme is to add the Hebrewletters of the Sphere as well. For example AB would now become KTHR AB.The actual translation of these names, whenamalgamated, (roughly translated) reads:`The Seraphim stood above him with six wings.One in Two. He covered his face with his hands andhis feet and he shouted Holy, Holy, Lord of the Hosts,whose glory covers the earth.'The entire concept is to visualise the wings to raise oneconsciousness or to skry using the wings as an astralvehicle of sorts. It is not really skrying as such, but aform of meditation to bring about awareness and Ihave no hesitation in recommending it for this level.On a personal note, I found that using thecolours of the Sephiroth of the Queen Scale do help inthis matter. Instead of using wings, just imagine acoloured sphere of light around you. I would suggestthat those in charge of some Golden Dawn temples, trythis exercise for this grade level and have the studentstart notebooks on this form of meditation for a fewmonths.337"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Diagram of 12 Princes of the Olippoth: The symbolism for this diagram has been explained in a previous grade book. Thedescriptions of these forces are extremely archaic. If we look at the left hand Tree of 11 Sephirothin the 16th Key then we have a firm association here. The additional Sephirah of the Qlippoth isreferred to in the diagram and not shown in the Tree is hidden and is in effect the Tower itselfwhich is struck by lightning.Again this area should be approached from that of the individual. I would not suggest thatanyone at 4=7 do this but at a later stage start trying to visualise what each of these Princes looklike and try and create pictures of them for one's own personal references. I personally considerthem as part of the Astrological experience which can be used to help with negative conjunctionsand oppositions. The various auric bodies then are reinforced when the negative aspects areconsidered as an artificial archetype that can be worked against.Diagrams of the Sephirah of NetzachAdmission Badge: To revert the entire subject of theZauir Anpin or Microprosopus to a singlediagram is a very ambitious project-foranyone. This badge symbolised theMicroprosopus when the Practicus wouldsee it for the first time. The most importantsquare is that of the Hexagram, for each barof that represents the 6 sephiroth fromChesed to Yesod, on the Tree of Life.The central diagram of Spirit is theguiding force with the elements in balanceddisposition around it. Years ago, when I firstwent through this grade and approachedTaylor for its hidden symbolism, he wheeledhimself over to his book shelf got out a copyof the `Kabbalah Unveiled' and threw it atme. He then told me to study it for a while,and if I had any questions about the diagramto come back and see him later. Almosttwenty years later I am still studying the text.One of the great failings within the Golden Dawn was the point of not knowing exactly howmuch of the Hebrew teachings should be introduced and how much should be modified. Tacklingthe three important books of the Zohar that Mathers translated in his `Kabbalah Unveiled' would beenough to daunt anyone. The main point is how far should one go with this type of teaching? I havetried to do just that in my `Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn'. My editor made the comment that I had`Almost enough to get a handle on it but not quite.' This comment just about sums up the situationfor most of us who have not enrolled and spent years in a Jewish Seminary College, studyingKabbalistic texts.The 27th Path's discussions on the Edomite Kings also apply here for they were the imperfectvessels discussed in the Zohar, that had to be scrapped so that the Creation theme could start again.In many respects the 27th Path and Netzach, show a blueprint, for the section of the Zohar thatconcerns us for the moment, and is a tribute to Mathers' inventiveness.I feel that at the 4=7 level a number of classes and lectures should be held on the subject ofthe Partsufim theory (as the Macroprosopus and Nficroprosopus are sometimes called) until a basicunderstanding of it is obtained. This is my suggestion to those Golden Dawn teachers for part ofthis level's training. I would point out that a knowledge of this subject becomes invaluable, because338"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"it is impregnated in much Golden Dawn teaching, such as the Court Cards of the Tarot andEnochian chess, to name but two. To those of you who are expecting more information on thisdiagram then I give the same suggestion that my teacher gave me and recommend you purchase (asa start) a copy of the `Kabbalah Unveiled' and study it, along with my `Kabbalah of the GoldenDawn' which may, or may not, present a shortcut or two.Tree of Life After the Fall: The Ritual explanation of this diagram is really selfexplanatory, but I would like to suggest another message itgives.The destructive serpent Leviathan, is, in fact, analogouswith the Kundaline Process rising prematurely, which is whathappened to both Adam and Eve. Such knowledge that wassuddenly made available to them (with the benefit of experience)burnt out the seven chakras and, as such, partly destroyed themin the process. As such the harmony and balance of mind theypossessed within themselves and their surroundings wasdisrupted. The chakras were bipolarised. The fill effect of thesurroundings of the world outside of Eden heightened theirsenses, and with no sense of balance, they were not able tocontrol their desires of the senses, which they had donepreviously before they ate the forbidden fruit of the Tree ofKnowledge. If we ask ourselves, then, how did they cope withsenses while still in the Garden, we can turn to the east for someof that information.The Bhagavad-Gita says:`A person in the divine consciousness, although engaged inseeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving about,sleeping, breathing, speaking, evacuating, receiving and openingor closing his eyes, always knows within himself that he actuallydoes nothing at all. Because while performing all these activities,he always knows that only the material senses are engaged withtheir objects and that he is aloof from them. One who performshis duty without attachment, surrendering the results unto theSupreme God, is not effected by sinful action, as the lotus leaf isuntouched by water,'The expulsion theme is, in fact, a further aspect ofthe 16th Key, which now becomes the expellingof Adam and Eve from the Garden by the FlamingSword. It is now up to the imperfect bodies toacquire perfections in an imperfect state wherethe protection has been taken away.KAMEA OF VENUSUsing the Bachet system, you start with ablank square of 49 cells. On each top and sideyou create a pyramid of additional cells. The firstor bottom line of the pyramid has five cells. Ontop of these are another three cells, and on top ofthese is the remaining cell. Now starting at thetop cell of the top pyramid with the number one,write down the numbers diagonally, andsequentially to the right, stopping at the339"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"furthermost single cell on the right. The entire process is repeated in the next cell diagonal to thefirst, which starts with eight. This is repeated until all the outer cells of the pyramid and square havebeen filled. To fill in the gaps is very straightforward. Take the numbers in the bottom pyramid andtranspose them with the gaps in the top of the square. For example 47 is placed between 22 and 16,41 between 16 and 10, 35 between 10 and 4 etc. If you placed a cutout of the lower pyramid andplaced it on the blanks of the top of the square then it would transpose correctly. When filling in thebottom blanks in the lower portion of the square just transpose the figures from the upper pyramid.Left and right follow the same pattern. The diagram below shows how this is formed.The Seal of the Venus SquareIn the 'Complete Golden Dawn system of Magic.' Vol 5, Page 42, we are told:`The Seal or Sigil of the Planet is a symmetrical form so designed that its traced lines touchevery number on the Kamea.'A close look at the Seals of both Mars and Venus will show that they are hardly symmetrical andthe Seal does not touch every square. I mention this, not to try and point out Regardie' s error (Ihave made enough of those in my time without trying to point the finger at anyone else) but to helpothers what to avoid, and will save a lot of confusion_ Having said this, I must admit that thecontinuity I have found in other seals does not exist in this particular one, and I must admit defeat intrying to fathom it out, I have, however, worked out how most of the seals are formed, from astrictly mathematical base, and, I will make two observations in the hope they may be of some helpto the readers.The first is when the seals were made up, there is more than one instance that a sentence orphrase can be made from the letters of the seal, through which the lines have been traced,sometimes using the last figure only in a double digit square.Using a last digit sequence produces the following results:1.Units - 1,8,9,2 for the circle in the Southern portion of the Seal.2.Tens - 16,17,10 for the first V in the North section of the Square.3.Twenties - 22 to 28 to 29. In the Eastern section of the square.4.Thirties - 30,31,38 in the Western section of the square.5. Forties - 48 to 42, 41 to 49. In the Northern section of the square. I would like to add at thispoint that the words formed in the northern section of the seal, using the right hand single digit ineach square, is MYM and MYY plus permeations. Apart from the word Mayim, I have been unableto work this one out.340"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"The second, is that the letters traced through by the lines form the initial letters or words of aBiblical verse (according to M.Gaster -such as the Schemphamphoresch for example).Unfortunately though, without the key, it is almost impossible to interpret.Sigil of the Spirit of Venus.The Spirit is QDMAL (becoming KEDEMEL) which is 100,4,40,1,30 and becomes10,4.40,1,30.

The Golden Dawn version given here is correct.Tree of Life with DaathThe Golden Dawn make it very clear thatthis diagram 'is not so correct, as Daath is notproperly speaking a Sephiroth.\"This Tree of Lifehas always been a point of confusion for somewithin the Order and, for the most part,explanations of it were sketchy, to say the least.The Tree of Life with Daath, shows whatwas originally considered to be the PerfectedTree. It was a combination of the Tree of Life andthe Tree of Knowledge of Good an Evil. Themeeting point of these two Trees being Daath, thefocal point of the energies of both Chokmah andBinah, the Abba and Aima, concealed by Daath,which is the bridge between the Macrocosm andMicrocosm.In many respects the Perfect Tree was infact Perfect, but the vessels it worked from wereimperfect. The amount of energy that descendedfrom the Veils of Negative Existence far exceededthe limitation of design of this Tree. The objectwas for the vessels to support the Light fromKether, which should be reflected in Malkuth.The Light was held until its descent to Daath, andthe vessels below that were shattered. Thepolarity of the Qlippothic forces then rose up asfar as Daath, between the Worlds of Briah andYetsirah. From this rise, a new Tree was formed,where Daath was missing, for the Tree of342"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Knowledge was only available to those who had advanced to the World of Atziluth.A careful look at the Path positioning show a dramatic difference to the standard Tree as it isnow. You will note that the central Pillar is of particular significance showing the rising up the Treeby the direct route. I would like to make a suggestion here about studying the effects of this Tree.Substitute the Tarot Keys for the letters, and work on the principal of direct access to Kether byeach of the Three Pillars, as opposed to the Lightning Flash of the standard Tree. The Keys goingform one Sephiroth to another are to used as sub-supports, by this I mean a concept of simplybalancing one Pillar with the energy of another. Whenpeople talk of 'Secret Paths' on the Tree of Life one canimagine many different ways to take this, but when thisdiagram is studied it then becomes apparent what those`Secret Paths' are (within the Golden Dawn context). Forthose Golden Dawn Chiefs, they will find that a numberof lectures could be given on the Path positioning of thisdiagram alone, for now the framework of the KabbalaisticSoul as applied to the Tree of Life has to be looked atwithin new dimensions. We must never loose sight of thefact that this Tree represents the perfected State, not theState of things at the moment and as such should betreated with a great deal of respect.The diagram of this Tree is, in fact, another form ofthe diagram of the Fall, and is an extension of this theme(when the energy coming down the Tree was too pure tobe received by the imperfect vessels) and of the expulsionof the Dukes of Edom, which in turn is yet anotherconcept of the Key 16.For a fuller description of the Altar andthe functions connected with it I will refer tothe Dr. Edershem again:`On the altar, which at the top was only36 feet wide, three fires burned, one(east) forthe offerings, the second (south) for theincense, the third (north) to supply the meansfor kindling the other two. The four'horns' ofthe altar were straight, square. Hollowprominences, that at the south-west with twoopenings, into whose silver funnels thedrinking offerings, and, at the Feast of theTabernacles, the water from the Pool ofSiloam, were poured. A red line all round themiddle of the altar marked that above it theblood sacrifices intended to be eaten, below itthat of sacrifices wholly consumed, was to besprinkled. The system of drainage intochambers below the canals, all of which couldbe flushed at will, was perfect; the blood andrefuse being swept down into Kedron andtowards the royal gardens. Finally, north of thealtar were all requisites for the sacrifices-sixrows, with four rings each, of ingenious343"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"mechanism, for fastening the sacrifices; eight marble tables for the flesh, fat and cleaned`inwards:' eight low columns, each with three hooks, for hanging up the pieces; a marbletable for laying them out, and one of silver for the gold and silver vessels of the service.'The Golden Dawn theology of this altar, is that its use is the destruction and purifications of thegrosser Qlippothic elements to YHVH's name through Fire. Again we keep coming back to the16th Key which has never really left us: the purification by Fire and separation of the spirit from thedregs. The offerings are, of course, from Malkuth and the world of Assiah, which has beencorrupted by the Qlippothic influences since the Fall. The purification process, or trial with Fire, isto remind us of our own time and the need of cleansing before the spirit can rise again through theashes of death. It shows us the mortality of the flesh and the immortality of the Spirit. The Altar isyet another trial by Fire that the candidate must pass through before the purification process iscomplete.Laver of the Brazen SeaThe Laver of the Brazen Sea was, in effect, placed in the temple so that priests who enteredcould purify themselves with the water therein before they made sacrifices. The 12 oxen thatsupported the Laver showed the Labour that each man and woman would undertake through the 12Zodiac signs. Within each incarnation, through the Zodiac, man and woman would be able toexperience different phases of life. Because only through trial and tribulation can man or womanhope to raise themselves to unify with the great Mother. This is the purification process to reach theMacroprosopus. When viewing this symbolism we must look at it from the perspective of thereincarnating soul and the tasks it has to undergo - which, broadly speaking are:1.Aires: This shows the raw energy of self expression that must find form and structure for it todevelop.2.Taurus: Here the energy now struggles to exist within its original context and will protect itself344"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"against other forms or structures not like its own.3.Gemini: Here the opposite polarity of structure and form that was opposed in the previous sign isnow accepted for what it is and the individual now becomes part of the whole yet still clinging totheir original structures.4.Cancer: The isolation principle is very evident here for it is through this principle that theappreciation of what others have and how they can help can be realised.5.Leo: 'Control' is the Key word the soul must experience here.6.Virgo: The Soul now breaks through to see newer dimensions of form and structure and leavesbehind the old values. Temptation is the thing we must watch here.7.Libra: The point of balance is reached and the Soul must now contemplate its nature and choose.8.Scorpio: A battle to gain mastery over the. Lower nature.9.Sagittarius: This brings one into closer contact with the Higher Self10.Capricorn: Transfiguration process through initiation.11.Aquarius: The cleansing and purification process through initiation into a higher form oflearning.12.Pisces: The transmutation process which recognition of the function, and path the Higher selfdictates us to take.The 300 hundred Knopps relates to the Ruach Elohim and is further expressed by thecircumference of the Laver which alludes to the Tree of Life in the worlds of Atziluth, Briah andYetsirah. The world of Assiah is shown by the diameter of the Laver for this is the point where thenegative emissions of the Qlippoth are left behind after purification through water, which restsbelow the diameter. Each time an incarnation is gone through the soul must be purified and thedregs of the past life left behind, showing by the cleansing process of water, and one then begins theprocess all over again. Within the original Laver, there were numerous mirrors of reflection whichshow that when every life is finished the actions of that life are caught and reflected back to the souland nothing escapes it. The five cubits of height of the Laver shows the numerical value of Heh,-meaning 'window.' and it is a 'window' from which the Higher Self can view the actions of theLower Self through the added reflection of the mirrors mentioned earlier.SYMBOLISM OF THE OPENINGThe first knock, by the Hierophant, brings in the current that activates the ceremony.At this point, some of you may be asking 'What current?' As the previous books in the Z 5-series on the Golden Dawn have shown, there are a number of currents activated within theceremony itself, but the first current that one attracts is that of the Golden Dawn proper. By this Imean that in the astral, there is a focus point of energy which is seen by some clairvoyants as a typeof transparent bubble containing the seven prismatic colours. This bubble is then filtered through anarchetypal figure of the Godform Thoth, whom the Hierophant asks (during his pre-ceremonymeditation) to guide into the portal, within the Hall. As the current comes through the knock it thenconnects with the astral Godforms on the dais, then the floor. This is done after it first surroundsthe Portal of the Hall, which is circular. It then forms a cross which has been seen as a light greenishhue and connects.the astral stations of the Godforms of Kneph, Horns, Nephthys and Aroueris inthe outline form of the Admission Badge.Now during the course of writing on the Elemental Grades of the Golden Dawn I have beenasked repeatedly what happens if the Hierophant does not do any of the above. Firstly, this dependson the temple and its members as a collective unit. Usually though the desired thought will bringpart of the current through but in a considerably weakened form and possibly not entirely intact. By-this I mean that some energies come through but not them all, in a balanced manner. A goodexample is going through a ceremony where everything is done technically correct and yet the345"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"whole energy aspect is flat. This is when the contact has not properly connected. According to JackTaylor, this happened a number of times during the New Zealand temple Whare Ra's 60 yearhistory. My own personal observations is also that when the intent is so strong that some of thetechnical aspects have been either omitted or fouled up by the officers, the energy pattern that iscalled seems to counterbalance these difficulties and can provide a very powerful ceremony. Butagain this depends entirely on the individuals who are the officers.I have also been asked how the Golden Dawn current got there in the first place for us to tapinto it. Any type of energy pattern that is formulated in the astral comes from what some would callour Astral advisors or by the power of thought, which is a very powerful weapon at ourt disposal.Over the years the thoughts and aspirations of men have been pulled in a certain direction and thatin itself attracts astral energies. When Mathers and Westcott first performed the Golden Dawnrituals, they brought together many aspects of very ancient cultures energy and formulated theminto a solid cohesive unit, something that had been lacking before. As more rituals were performedthen the clearer and more easily obtainable the Golden Dawn energy pattern became. To fullyunderstand the mechanics of this I would suggest the reader obtain a copy of 'HolographicUniverse' by Michael Talbot, who explains this phenomena from more of a scientific base than Icould ever hope to do. I would also like to add to Talbot's theories that once a thought-form iscreated to physical manifestation it can be drawn upon as an additional power source which pertainsdirectly to ritual magic. This is also shown to apply equally as well to the Tibetan Mystics byAlexandra David-Neel in her, book 'Magic and Mystery in Tibet', where thought forms could becreated and seen by other people.Apart from the theories of Talbot, I would also suggest that the concept of `MorphicResonance' be studied as well. This concept is put forward by Rupert Shelldrake in his book`Pressence of the Past'. This theory actually falls in tandem with that of Talbot, but approachedfrom a different angle. Shelldrake informs us that once some form of ritual has been done, and if itis repeated years later, or even halfway around the world, the acting out of that ritual will tap intoMorphic fields that transcend time and space and take one back to when the ritual was originallydone (the greater the degree of similartude, the greater the degree of influence of `MorphicResonance'). Every ritual that is done in the same manner (with the same content) will tap willproduce an energy field that will tap back into the original into the original ritual, in much the samemanner as Jung's Collective Unconscious. So when one taps into a ritual or energy pattern one usesthe concept of `Morphic Resonance' which links into when the first Golden Dawn 4=7 wasperfomed. With the work of men like Talbot and Shelldrake, the scientific explanation of occultrituals and their energy fields will give creedence to the work of ritualists and the energy currentsthey invoke.Once this energy has entered the Temple with the first knock, it is then tapered to fit a certainrole, hence the question and answer phrasing of the opening. With each question and answer themodifying aspects of the energy goes on until it is 'fine tuned' to the desired purpose. This, ofcourse, give us a tremendous power base to work from, for we then take this power base ofcollective energy and invoke yet another current of energy through the Admission badge. As I havestated in my previous book on the 3=8 ceremony, when I first saw this pattern of energy forming Ihad not used any creative visualisation techniques. The energy pattern of the Admission Badges(the outlines of them appear traced on the temple floor) comes as part of the overall package wehave invoked and shows the power of symbology.Additional to the energy pattern invoked with the currents present. The Godfonns of Osiris,Isis and Horns are in the Invisible stations of the triad of officers on the floor. The archangelNlichael is then brought through to be present at the ceremony. During the Banishing Ritual at thebeginning, Michael, along with Raphael, Gabriel and Uriel tend to clean out any negative Astralentities that may have lingered in the Hall. They also make sure that when the Golden Dawn currentis invoked nothing unwanted comes along with it. Now Michael is appeased directly in a new roleas Guardian of the Fire Element. The Sign of the Lion, given straight after Michael's invocation, is346"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"the sign that binds Michael specifically to the elemental of Fire and the cardinal points. So, in effect,the power of Michael is also tapered to fit in with the energy associated with Fire.Standing in front of the Fire Tablet, the passive gestures with the cross are used to connectwith the Three Holy Names on the horizontal cross bar of the tablet. Each of the Three Holy namesin each of the four tablets covers an astrological house, and combined they cover all areas ofhumanity.It is important to note the positioning of the officers in front of the Fire tablet at this time,during the invocation. Each officer is placed in juxtaposition so that the temple Officers, and theGodforms they have created, now act as a conduit of energy as the passive energy of the tablets isabsorbed. The Godform of Aroueris, in front of the Fire Tablet also forms what could be seen as aplasmic egg which envelopes the Officers in an added form of protection. Also the positioning ofthe officers works well when the Hierophant has not done the invocation properly and can draw toomuch energy from the tablets. The formation behind helps spread the load through the otherofficers.After the invocation in front of the Fire tablet the Three Officers then do a battery of sevenknocks each (for the Sephirah of Netzach) showing both an attraction and sealing into the currentof Netzach.The knock of the Hierophant opens up the energy of the 29th Path. This knock activates theenergy of the Godform of Opaut, Lord of the 29th path, who then sends a stream of energy,through the Hierophant, to the central altar where it is picked up and amalgamated with the otherenergy patterns invoked so far. One of the first duties of the current of Opaut is to activate thecurrent of the Admission badge on the temple floor. This of course relates to the ten Sephiroth but347"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"also to the Calvary Cross Squares on the Enochian Tablets.Some years ago, while acting as. Hierophant during a 4=7 ritual, I summoned the CalvaryCross Seniors (for the Fire section of the Fire tablet) and did a small mental invocation for theSeniors to attend and assist with this ceremony. Since the Three Holy names of the Tablets hadalready been invoked I assumed that the Seniors would merely be a tapering effect for this part ofthe ceremony. The psychic impression I gained from this was amazing. The rather pale outline, theCross on the Temple floor lit up like a Xmas tree in glowing emerald green and my abdominalchakra suddenly became quite active. The most important aspect was the Candidate, for he alsotook on an additional radiant glow and later told me a few days after the ceremony, that he felt asudden boost to his health, which was poor at the time, and an increase in his psychic perception.From what I can gather, the Seniors I invoked, aided his Astral and Mental Body which was undersome strain from an epileptic condition he had at the time. It did not cure him but it did help.Now before the Candidate enters the Hall the Hierophant petitions the Guardians of the Orderto let the Candidate enter. The Calvary cross in his or her hands then ignites about the same timethe Calvary Cross on the Temple floor is surging with energy. To a certain extent, the Aura andSubtle Bodies of the candidate then undergo a change. The Astral Body of the candidate usuallythen is taken from the Candidate and held in check between the pillars during the Path ceremonies,though there is the odd exception. In this instance some candidates usually feel a heat sensation tothe kidney area where the Astral body is joined to the physical. This separation of bodies is in factjust an elongation of the Astral body who always remains attached to the physical, by an astral cord.The expurgation of the Astral body from its resting place is done on a completely involuntarybasis. Some of you at this point may be wondering how this can be accomplished without thecandidates consent, yet it does and can happen quite often during ritual. Once the initial obligationis given the consent is also given by the Higher Self (or the Causal Body of the Candidate). Intheory some may find this difficult to accept but in fact it can by done by a good Hierophant with aproperly trained team, through the manipulation of the magnetic currents at their disposal. Theacceptance of the Admission Badge by the candidate is the trigger which transfers the Astral Bodyto the temple floor, drawn by the floor current of the Admission Badge.I was always intrigued by the meaning of the words uttered by the Hegemon: 'And the RuachElohim moved on the face of the waters.' and for a number of years wondered what part thesewords had directly on the 29 Path. My first concept was to think that it related to the Moonsreflection on the waters. While this in itself may be true, if we study Qoph, meaning 'back of thehead', we find that we have a faceless creator who can only be seen in reflected glory. This ofcourse relates to the candidate being blinded with the brightness of the image of the creator. A fewyears ago I had the chance to clairvoyantly observe the actual magical effect that these words hadon the ceremony. The effect was that when the words were uttered by the Hegemon, her aura filledwith a Golden Light. This extended to the candidate also and remained until they entered the templeand touched the Portal on the temple floor. This merged briefly with and outshone the plaingreenish hue that both the Hegemon and the Candidate emitted (which comes from the protectionof the various Godforms). As the Hegemon and Candidate entered the portal the bright lightdisappeared and merged in with the translucent form of the Admission Badge on the Temple floor.By these words the Hegemon raises the vibrational Pitch of the candidate from her own aurathrough her heart chakra. Her Lamen both directs and controls this factor, for it pulsates a brightred that seemes to both control and direct these energies.In the Introduction to this book, I mentioned that each of the Z5 series of books has lookedat ritual from a slightly different perspective and that reference should be made to all the books andthe methods of explanation of the rituals to get an overall picture of how the manipulation ofEtheric currents function. At this point I have not mentioned the functions of the currents of theGodforms on the dais and how they work, and affect the rituals. These work in much the same wayas the currents of Thoth, Osiris, Horus etc., work in the Neophyte and Zelator rituals. Though thenames of the God forms on the dais change, their functions do not. In the Neophyte ritual the Isis348"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"current allowed the Astral body of the candidate to be removed and placed between the pillars andlooked after the physical body while the Nephthys current looked after the Astral Body during theritual. Both currents of energy are working in tandem with each other. In the 4=7 this principle isstill applied (as it was in the previous Elemental Grade rituals) only now the God forms on the Daishave changed. Now, the Isis current is taken over by Sati-Ashtoreth and the Nephthys current istaken over by the Anouke current. The same applies to other God -forms on the dais as well, whichdiffer from ritual to ritual (the and 1=10 Godforms being identical).When the Candidate enters the Hall, a circumambulation around the altar is done first to reachthe South. You do not go straight to the Fire Tablet on the right hand side of the temple. Allmovements within the temple should be with Sol or circled before they reach the objective. Whenthe candidate is taken in front of the Fire tablet, he or she is then turned towards East. The Astral ofthe Godfonns on the Dais, directed through the energy of the Ffierophant, then connect directly tothe candidate in unison. By this I mean the Candidate is exposed directly to them. They all operateon different levels. Once this is done the necessary Sign, grip, word and number are given, from theprevious grade. Now at first glance this may appear to be nothing but 'Claptrap', as some authorshave called it. This opinion is mainly due to the fact that few of them have experienced the realeffects of these gestures. Now gestures on their own have little or no meaning but gestures with apurpose have a great deal more to it. As one Golden Dawn Adept said:`The Sign of the Practicus grade opens up new levels of awareness when done within theHall and ensures that the vibrational pitch or magnetic field around the candidate is up tostrength. It is, in short, just what it purports to be, a testing manoeuvre. The Grand Wordgives the additional support of all the Godforms present in the ceremony but under theadditional and guidance protection of Elohim Tzaboath. The number, 36, relates to thenumerical value of the Password `Eloah'. Its function is to create a bridge of consciousnesswith the Three Holy Names of the Tablet. The Password `Eloah' meaning 'God', relates tothe Godforms around one and that one can draw upon in time of need. The Mystic Title of`Monokeros de Astris 'acts as a cloak which tunes you in to the energies of the previousWater Grade and can be used by those when drawing the energies down for the InvokingPentagram of Fire...'At this juncture the Candidate is then turned directly to face the. Fire tablet. The God form ofAroueris then kicks in, for Aroueris is a variant of Horus, and is, for the moment, part of the-threatening avenging current that both links and binds the Candidate with the Fire Tablet energies.To a certain extent, Aroueris becomes part of the current that is HRU, the avenging angel. Therehas been a great deal said about the Golden Dawn oath. Our oath's (Chris and myself), when we-went through this ceremony, were reworded so that it was left up to the dictates of our ownconscience what we revealed or not. I also suggest that others in Golden Dawn temples shouldconsider the same avenue of approach. I have found that the oath in the Golden Dawn rituals, withthe exception of the Neophyte ritual, binds and links us to our surroundings, in this instance the FireTablet. It gives the extra impetus to link to it. No two people in the Golden Dawn will ever give thesame answer as to the meanings of the oath. In his book `Magick, in Theory and Practice.',-Crowley gave a very esoteric and beautiful description of the Oath that was very in line with theGolden Dawn's original theme and I urge others to study this for it shows the Will as the moist vitalcomponent of the oath, for without it the oath is useless. An Oath taken with the Will to bind it canbe a very powerful tool indeed! The Incense waved in front of the Fire tablet gives us the physicalaspect of the Fire Element, the tangible concept that also bridges to incorporeal nature of the Fireentities.The forty two assessors, who are present in all Outer Order Golden Dawn ceremonies, areGodforms or currents of energy that can both help and hinder a candidate during and after thetaking of the oath. They hover in the Immeasurable Region between the pillars in this part of theceremony and their functions are to either open up the etheric energies of the candidate or shutthem down, if they are not ready, when the candidate is placed between the pillars. Once this is349"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"done the Astral body and physical body of the candidate are united. In Kabbalistic terms links boththe Ruach with the Nephesch. This, of course, is made possible with the help of the Isis Godformwho stands behind the Pillars. In the West, the Astral and Emotional bodies are sometimesseparated, where in the East they are considered as one body. Isis, in this instance, reunites theAstral form with the Candidate but holds back its emotional twin. This is only released at a certainpoint in the ceremony when the candidate enters the Sephirah of Netzach.At Whare Ra Temple, a great deal of work was done on the Subtle bodies and how theyfunction. Much of the work was clairvoyant but a great deal of it came from the works of AliceBailey and thankfully, because some of her revelations caused a large number of Adepti at WhareRa temple to work primarily in this medium, rather than the Kabbalistic Soul. The kabbalistic Soulis yet another explanation of the Subtle bodies. When many of the stops and prompts of ritual wereexplained to me by Jack Taylor, and the subtle bodies were used as an example, it was far easier tounderstand. Some of the problems encountered when using the Kabbalistic Soul during ritual is thatin each form of the Soul, there are a Higher and Lower division and the Golden Dawn papers tell usvirtually nothing about these levels. I have attempted to explain the connection in someconsiderable depth in the 'Kabbalah of the Golden Dawn', which, I hope, will bridge the gap to amuch deeper understanding of both areas in relationship with each other.The speech of the Hierophant, given in front of the Pillars, has a multifaceted purpose. It isduring this speech that he correctly activates the Water triangle from cup to cup. This entireconcept is analogous to taking the Candidate on a journey on the Egyptian river of life (which inpractical terms is sometimes symbolised by the Nile). When Mathers created this part of the-ceremony, he also combined the theology of the Ra boat going through the heavens which is whythe Admission badge consists of the twelve squares of the zodiac. In effect, therefore, there is adual aspect to this part of the ceremony. The magnetic effect of this part of the ceremony is thestimulation of the heart centre. It works through the transference of the Admission badge to thecandidate, by the Hegemon.The Candidate is then taken in a full circumambulation of the temple and is halted when theyreach the throne of the Hierophant (for the second time). The actual wording of the ceremonyshows that the Officers are wearing masks, and in the cipher manuscripts masks are drawn for thisgrade, but some temples did not use them. To understand this concept properly, one has tounderstand the Invisible stations of the Godforms on the Watery triangle which all the officersassume. Taylor maintained that this was the essence and that additional props were not needed,something which I heartily concur with for purely practical reasons.The speech by the Hierophant refers to the rising waters of the Nile which have covered thelow lands and thus bringing mud to them and beginning the first process of fertilisation. It showsthe power of Osiris, the God of resurrection, for the waters will eventually recede and new life willbe brought to areas of the Nile that have covered it. In terms of the Candidate, it effects his or herAstral body the most. Now that the Astral Body has been reunified with the physical self it has to beshown the way to act given that it has been purified for this Path. The first lesson here is stillness,for it must be taught obedience and control of the self.The candidate is then taken to the throne of the Hiereus. The speech here shows the waters offlood and storm that are fast and turbulent. This is the action of both the Hiereus and the nature ofHorns, whom the Hiereus represents. In practical terms it represents the Nile in a flash flood, due tostorms and heavy rains. In every respect this is yet another aspect of the cleansing process ofnature, as only the unfit and unwise who build too near the bank of the river of life will be affected.All those who have studied the river know its ways, and by building on a safe ground they havesaved themselves and families. In terms of the Candidate this also applies. The candidate must studythe lessons of the Order and when he or she is satisfied with their progress they can then build on asafe haven (the self). In relationship to the subtle bodies, however, it can relate to the withdrawal ofthe Astral body from the physical, during moments of great stress or danger.350"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"The candidate then goes to the throne of the Hegemon who represents the Goddess Isis.From the point of view of the Nile, it shows that the waters have receded and the crops have grownin abundance, it is the growth of Life itself, nurtured by the rising river in the previous stations.Here one can rest in safety and be abundantly supplied with provisions for any future journey.Regarding the Candidates journey, it shows that experience and steadfastness to one's journey haswon through. The Astral Body is at a state of comfortable rest and has learned from its experiences.It is in perfect communion with the mental body above it and the Etheric below it. The entirejourney has the alignment of the Astral bodies with the other subtle, bodies.The Candidate is then lead to his seat West of the altar by the Hegemon, and the Hierophantthen gives his speech. This speech has, basically, a two- fold purpose at this juncture. The first is toinstil in the Candidate the fact that what he or she is presently undergoing is closely allied to theGenesis principle. This also explained through the Kabbalistic Partsufun theory on how life wasformed and how the imperfect vessels were created then destroyed, so life could begin again. As faras the ceremony goes this shows the candidate's subtle bodies, in the form of the imperfect vesselthat undergoes a change to rebalance and align itself. Once this change has taken place, the ethericshells that have caused this imbalance are destroyed, through the trials and tribulations experiencedthrough the previous passage on the River of Life.The second aspect of this speech comes from the 'word of mouth' teachings of this grade.Taylor insisted that this speech, when the word 'Brow' is mentioned, a stream of light should bedirected at the candidate's Brow chakra and a triangle formed from the brow to the eyes. The effectis threefold and relates to changes in the Pineal, Pituitary and Carotid gland of the Candidate. Thisactivation process was not done through the wand of the Hierophant but from the Red Ray directedthrough his or her heart chakra. Again, this example of the later teachings of the Order opens upnew levels of awareness that are just becoming apparent today.When the candidate is conducted to the foot of the Hierophant's throne the Admission badgeis handed over to the Hierophant and its function explained. This act of giving away the Admissionbadge has the effect of grounding or earthing the candidate. At this point, many who haveundergone this ritual will have felt that a great weight has been lifted off their shoulders. Thecorrect procedure for visualisation at this stage is for the Hierophant to visualise his lamen directlyat the Candidate, which makes the effect all the more real.The effect of the next two explanations is more intellectual than magical and are a culminationof the previous teaching of this Path. The two main principles are the formation of a body, asexplained in the concept of 'Corporeal Intelligence'. The same aspect also applies to the Tarot Keyof the Moon. Here the body is the Crayfish which is about to embark on the same journey thecandidate did on the River of life. Although the explanation of the card relates to the Crayfishclimbing out of the pool of creation to embark upon the journey of the PATH of life, I have alwaysthought of the Crayfish making his way up through the STREAM of life and undergoing the similarexperience the Candidate goes through when stopping at each station of Cups, on his or herprevious journey around the temple. In many ways what we are shown on this path is the sameprinciple but seen from different perspectives.The Candidate is then led to the symbol of the Serpent of Brass in the East of the Temple.The clairvoyant effect on the Candidate is that he or she is bathed in a golden light. This effect isfrom a highly magnetised and charged aura, when the Astral body pours through energy to theetheric, directed through the Brow centre (previously stimulated). This occurs from the previousbuildup in the ritual and the magical effect of the diagram itself One person who went through thisdescribed it as feeling like a protective cloak was wrapped around her. That is exactly whathappens, through the energy of Osiris, Hours and Isis who have created the correct magneticbalance of energy needed for this part of the ceremony.The Candidate is then taken to the Hiereus who explains the functions of the Kabbalah of theNine Chambers, the Tarot on the Tree of Life, the Tablet of three Columns and the Geomanticfigures all of which have been explained earlier.351"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Again, as in the previous Path, the Godforms on the Dais, assisting and protecting theCandidate at the start of the ceremony, do not change. However the energy pattern on the templefloor does. For now it resembles the Admission badge of the Pyramid square. As before, the AstralBody of the candidate is placed between the pillars before he or she enters the Hall, the momentthat the Admission badge is given.As the candidate is lead to the Pillars the Hegemon leaves no doubt as to the nature of thejourney being one by river, as they go to the source of the Four Rivers. Genesis ii, 10. also leavesno doubt as to what that source is:And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted andbecame four heads.'For the candidate this is a time when he or she is lead back to the state of pure spirituality andharmony that existed before the Fall.With the cube of the elements in the candidate's left hand, he or she is led to the throne of theEfierophant where a speech is delivered. As the Candidate stands before the Hierophant theGodform of Isis then takes over and reinforces part of the Emotional Body of the Candidate. This isdone by inducing a magnetic charge into it, for Isis absorbs the candidate with her cloak of energy.She is referred to as the 'rain of Heaven' and is the one who bestows benefits on her devotees. Therain is analogous to nourishment and that is what the Candidate receives.The next halting point is the throne of the Hiereus under the influence of the Godform ofNephthys. Her influence is silent and in darkness, like the dew of the night. The Candidate is alsoabsorbed by her. The energy of Nephthys is etheric, like the dew of the night and she effects theetheric body. By Clairvoyant analysis we have been able to ascertain what Nephthys does at thispoint. She tends to balance up the prana or energy intake before it is distributed to the Chakras. As352"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"a result of this rearrangement of energy intake the effects are not always immediate. Some yearsago a clairvoyant member of the Order who went through this ceremony wrote in her diary:At the speech of the Hiereus, in the form of Nephthys on the 28th Path, I felt a suddentingling in my spleen chakra. I did not pay much attention to it at first, but up to a few days after the4=7 I felt the same sensation again many times only now stronger. My energy level before the ritualwas low but as the tingling sensation increased in the spleen chakra so did my energy level and aweek later I felt completely refreshed. Since I first felt the tingling sensation immediately at aparticular point in the ceremony I must conclude that it was the energy of Nephthys workingthrough the Hiereus that helped me...Another clairvoyant description of this point in the ceremony is the multicolored spectrum of lightsentering the etheric body of the candidate not only at the spleen but also at the Heart chakra aswell.The candidate is then taken to the Throne of the Hegemon where her or she is introduced tothe Godfonn of Athor, working through the Hegemon. Again, clairvoyant analysis shows thefunction of Athor at this point, who injects a magnetic current into the Etheric body of theCandidate which boosts the Etheral Fluidium.Now in the previous stop, the Spleen Chakra (which is part of the Etheric Body) is workedon directly and now the whole vibration pitch of the Etheric body is raised. If you study thedescriptions of the speeches of the, Officers in the last three stop positions, you will find that thedescription of each Godform describes exactly its function. The dew of Nephthys shows the actionsof energy on almost a sub atomic level and Athor relates directly to the fluid balance of energy inthe Etheric. It is also very obvious from the speeches of the Godforms, that Mathers was very muchaware of the subtle level of energy manipulations on the subtle bodies as one went through therituals, and is a testament to his remarkable clairvoyant abilities.The next lines of speeches by the Hierophant and FEereus show that candidate is instructed inthe basics of occult theology of creation. It relates directly back to the diagrams of the `Gon' and`Gram' and their formation.The Hierophant then instructs the Candidate in the Occult symbology of the Admission Badgeand of the 17th Key of the Tarot. If you study the symbology of the 'Star' with the informationgiven by the Godforms of Isis, Nephthys and Athor you will find that they also represent thediffering aspect of nourishment from the heavens, as portrayed by the theme of the 'Star'. It is acontinuation of the River of Life which is reinforced by rain, nurtured by dew to give its life givingproperties. It is shrouded in the mystery that is veiled to some in the form of mist so that it is notfully comprehended.Further speeches are then given on various diagrams and at the final investiture the AstralBody is then reunited with the candidate.353"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"ADVANCEMENT ON THE 27TH PATH OF PEHThe auric preparations are the same as the previous paths when the Admission Badge is given to theCandidate.The speech of the Hegemon is taken from Judges 5:21. The inference being that Kishon is part ofthe cleansing process which will sweep away the unworthy or unwanted.I would like to point out at this stage that verses of the Bible have magical power, hence theiruse in ritual. As to why certain verses are chosen above others is up to the individuals who tap in tosome form of current that reveals things to them. The actual magical effect of this verse in ritual isquite profound. I have noticed on more than one occasion, through clairvoyant analysis, that awhite mist seems to envelope the Candidate. One person who came to us some years ago fromanother Order, worked a lot with the Horus current and was not careful enough to dispel some ofthe negative energy he drew on. I waited for over a year until the person entered this Path (taking aHomeopathic viewpoint of like curing like) in the hope that it would help cleanse the aura further.To my surprise, the speech of the Hegemon was the thing that did it. At this point, as in previousPaths, the Astral Body of the Adept is then drawn into the temple and placed between the pillars.The candidate is then taken on the first circumambulation of the temple to the South, in frontof the pillars. The Candidate at this point is directly over the position of Samael who is preventedfrom enveloping the candidate with his desires. The power of the Hegemon and the Calvary Crosscarried by the Candidate is said to keep the negative aspect under control.I was always puzzled by the inclusion of the position of Samael here (as an Invisible Station)until I found out that he was a guardian of one of the Dukes of Edom. The meaning of this will besoon apparent.The speech of the Hegemon at this point is taken from Exodus 15:3. The inference being thatthe power one will walk through will not be a passive but an aggressive current and the candidate354"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"should be prepared for it. This speech is said as the Hegemon draws the candidate through thepillars, and in a sense, is fighting Samael for the right to guide the candidate on the correct Path.Once entrance through the pillars is complete the Candidate is reunited with his or her Astral Body.The Candidate is then circumambulated around the Temple until the foot of the Throne of theHierophant is reached, under the protection of Horus the Avenger. The speech of the Hierophantthen follows. This relates to the imperfect bodies (the Kings of Edom) claiming perfection andimmortality and when faced with the reality of their mortality were confused. It is the acceptance ofmatter over spirituality and the results it can lead to. The effect on the Candidate at this time is thatof a warning. Horns then strengthens the Astral body of the candidate and aligns this with theEtheric body.I have seen this subtle-body re-adjustment a number of times during rituals. From a psychicperspective, it is a flash of brilliant red colours. To a certain extent the Solar Plexus chakra is alsostabilised.Another circumambulation of the temple is then done and the candidate is taken before thethrone of the Hiereus, in the form Nephthys.The speech of the Hiereus here also contains the previous speech of the Hegemon on enteringthe hall. The purpose of this speech is twofold. The first is to explain the message of the paththrough the concepts, which is similar to that of Tarot Key 16, the Blasted Tower, as was theprevious speech of the Hierophant. All speeches so far are analogous to this concept. The Tower ofKey 16 now becomes the Fortress of the Edomite Kings, as shown by the Crown, they are expelledby YHVH's wrath, through the influence of Horns the Avenger. On the left hand side of the Towerstands the Qlippoth, headed by Samael, who was guiding them, and is powerless to stop YHVH'smight. On the right hand side of the Tower is the perfected and purified Tree, the Path ofRighteousness.The second purpose of this speech is yet another purification process by Nephthys in muchthe same manner as was done when the candidate entered the Hall.The Candidate is then circumambulated to the throne of the Hiereus, where another speech isgiven. Like the ones before it, it further goes into the destructive powers of the Lord, and continuesto be similar to the Key 16 in approach. Again another purification occurs, through Athor.The Candidate is then placed in a seat West of the Altar where the Hierophant gives yetanother speech. This speech shows the power of YHVH against his adversaries for those who take-the correct path.The Candidate is then taken to the Hierophant where the admission badge is explained alongwith the meaning of the 27nd Path. The Candidate is then taken to the West of the Altar where the-meaning of Key 16 is revealed. I would point out again, that up to this point the Candidate iswarned about the death and destruction of the unworthy, but here the Candidate is faced with apictorial image of all that has gone before. The Candidate is then conducted around the Hall to theremaining diagrams and is given the title of Lord or Lady of the 27 Path.355"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"On command of the Hierophant, the Hegemon goes out of the portal to where the Candidateis waiting. The seven knocks given by the Candidate release the Astral Body which is immediatelytransferred to the place between the Pillars. The Candidate takes the symbol of the Admissionbadge and that link is transferred to the energy pattern of the same symbol on the temple floor. Onlythen do they enter the temple.Some years ago , when I first prompted Taylor about the effect the Godforms had when theCandidate entered Netzach he said:`The Golden Dawn rituals are so complex that there is still a great deal we do not know.When the Philosophus enters Netzach for the first time, I have seen clairvoyantly, onnumerous occasions, bright lights coming down from the letters (from the 29 and 28thpaths.P.Z) to be absorbed by the Philosophus. From this it appears that these Godforms areactively assisting and protecting the Philosophus as the Portal is crossed in the templeproper. I did not see these every time I did a 4=7, but enough to know that when they didoccur I knew the temple at least had been set up properly and the correct Godformscreated.'What Taylor was describing was the magnetic stimuli of group ritual working directly on theEtheric body of the candidate. We must realise that the created Godforms have a constraint placedon them in ritual but still can act independently of charge. Rather than create a thin etheric shell,they are actually absorbed into the etheric body of the candidate directly. This 'wash' effect is justas powerful as a shell, even more so, because it reinforces the inner Etheric Body and does notwork at protecting the auric field. It gives the candidate enough strength to draw on if anynegativity occurs. This is not Godform assumption done on an involuntary basis but Godformabsorbtion, done on an involuntary level. I might also point out that this is not possession because356"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"-the energy dissipates when the ceremony is over.The Hegemon takes the Candidate to his position in the North and is turned to face thediagram of the Fall where the Hierophant instructs the Candidate in the meaning of the diagram.At this point the candidate is almost directly on the station of Nephthys. I have mentioned inearlier grade ritual books the magnetic and magical effect of some diagrams and this instance is noexception. It is here, during the speech of the Hierophant, that a type of etheric purging processbegins, using the diagram of the Fall as a catalyst. This point of the 4=7 ritual was alwaysconsidered the most important because for a very brief moment the Ruach and the Neshamahattempt to merge. It will not be successful for the Candidate has not yet attained the degree ofperfection that is needed, nevertheless, the movement of these two mighty forces together showsthe stimulation of (though not the rising) of the Ktmdaline. This happens briefly in each of the graderituals but in the 4=7 it is the most potent kick start one is ever likely to get in an Outer Orderritual. The energy from Nephthys is the one that helps and directs this energy to move more thanthat of any other Godform and she also controls this energy so that the kundaline does not riseprematurely.After this speech, the. Sign of the 4=7 is shown to the candidate. In past books I havementioned that the effect of this sign is mainly on the Astral and Etheric level. What happens to the-candidate is that when the Fire Sign is given a certain balancing effect is produced in the aura. Bythis I mean that the bio-magnetic energy is increased and produces a light blue etheric field, if seenclairvoyantly. On at least three occasions when doing a 4=7 ritual I have seen this same effect, butwith a direct link to the Fire tablet. When the Fire Sign is done at the start of the ritual a similarforce occurs. This blue light then goes directly above the head where it circles into a cone, thenlinks directly to the tablet. For those of you who do this Sign in the Astral or when working directlywith an other element you will find that it still reaches a cone shape, but from that point it shoots offin all directions. Oddly enough it resembles what Crowley has drawn in 'Ace of Swords'.Many years before I became a student of the Golden Dawn, I used to practice a Karate Kata(pattern of movements) called Koshokundai (also called Kanku Dai). The first movement isidentical to the 4=7 Sign. Before I used to start this Kata, I used to meditate upon the symbolism ona high place and place the sun between my hands. The etheric effect of this was not lost to me, andwhen I was shown it as part of the 4=7, many years later I felt that what I had been doing waspractising the essence of the sign itself.The actual sign not only works from a buildup of power in our own Etheric field, but is also asign of attraction of like forces to give us power and the ability to assimilate among them more. Thesign attracts the Salamanders to our aidas well as the angelic beings whom they work directly under-(sometimes called Devas in the East). They also assist us during the ceremony but their assistancestill requires them to work through the ritualistic framework as a support base.The Pass-word of the Grade is now given to the Candidate. I have often been asked by people-what does a Pass-word do other than let you into the Temple (if you are late or have to leave andcomeback during ritual). The Pass-word gives one a key to tap into the element one is workingfrom. For example, if one is meditating on the Fire element and wishes to do both meditative andritual work in this area or to converse Astrally with the Fire elementals, then this word is used andrepeated. I used to sit in back yard and use it as a mantram (continuous repetition of a name) and itopened quite a few astral doorways with this method that I had never seen before. In ritual, whenthe word is given, it has the effect of raising ones Etheric vibrational pitch and making them in tunewith the energy patterns around them.The Grand Word of the Grade alludes to the God-name of Netzach -YHVH Tzabaoth. Itsactual use is almost limitless but it works primarily on Netzach and brings forth for us the energiesof this Sephirah. The Mystic number of the Grade is 28 and has the meaning of power. Taylor-taught us to use numbers such as this as a quick method of drawing down power. He used tocontinually tell us, 'Numbers have power!' and frequently used numbers for many aspects of hiswork during meditation. 28 as a number, brings forth power in the literal sense, and can be used to357"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"stimulate the etheric body. When used in conjunction with this ritual it brings a sense of additionalprotection to the Candidate and gives an extra boost that will help make the final adjustments to thesubtle bodies. To make this work correctly, 28 must be used in conjunction with a force or God-name, that can direct its use. Like all numbers, they are tools that have to be directed to a desiredend.After receiving the sash of the grade the Candidate is then taken by the Hierophant to the FireTablet. This excursion is what I call an 'Introduction.' For while the ritual has already exposed thecandidate to the Tablet this formal introduction is nevertheless very important. Taylor used to tellme that when he would take a candidate to the Tablets he would link to the aura of the EnochianTablet and send his energy to help integrate the Candidate with the angels of the Tablets. Someyears previously, while in India, my teacher Vivandatta also used a similar principle of introducing astudent to a mandalla, then the student had to copy it as part of the integration process.They then return to the west of the Altar where the Altar symbolism is explained. It is at thispoint that the Astral Body of the Candidate is reunited with him-through the actions of theHierophant.The Hierophant then takes the Candidate to the east where he or she is introduced to theGodforms of the Portals and the Iflerarchy of the Kameas. This is identical to the same methodused to expose the Candidate to the energy of the Enochian Tablet of Fire.The Candidate is then shown to the various diagrams and then given the title of the grade`Illuminating Tower of Light.' This title is easily recognisable as an aspect of the 16th Tarot Keyand its reoccurring theme throughout this ritual. It is the rectified or perfected tower, that towerthat was hit by the Lightning Flash which purified the Adept and restored the Tower to its formerglory. In the 5=6 ritual the Tower is shown above the top of the Mountain of Abiegnus. The towersits on top of the Paths of the Outer Order the Candidate has traversed.The 'Illuminating Tower' also relates to the central Pillar of the Tree of the Life. It is theLight of Tiphareth reflected down to Yesod to guide us on our search. The actual title of this Graderelates to the Balance and Harmony within the Sett for without that, the Light will not flow. As thePersona for the Candidate to assume, it changes the vibrational pitch of the Etheric Body, and insome instances the Astral Body. It is not much concerned with the Fire Grade per se- but more inthe final rectification of balance of the Elemental Properties within the Subtle Bodies - principallythe Etheric. This Title, when given and invoked, can be seen, clairvoyantly, as a shell of Ethericdensity around the Candidate. It also becomes a source of Light that can create openings for us innew directions that our Higher self dictates us to go.To explain the entire concept of this title is extremely complex. The Tower the candidate hasassumed at this point is perfection - but perfection at only one level of consciousness. The Towerwill be blasted open again (as in the 16th Key) numerous times in our life as the old beliefs aretranscended and new structures fall into place.SYMBOLISM OF THE CLOSINGAs in the previous grades the Knocks signify the with-drawing current. The Prayer of theSalamanders is important for they are summoned to meet the new Philosophus by the power andenergy of the Fire Tablet so that when they are called they will be familiar with him or her and cometo him without hesitation when the Philosophus calls to them during meditation. There are so manyforms of Slamanders or Fire Spirit that they ar difficult to count. A Elemental will always workthrough its angelic counterpart, even when one addresses them directly. They work closely withKarmic angels and as such will only come if it is within the Karmic pattern of the individual called.This is also a reason why so many fail in Elemental evocations.The final knocks close the entire sphere of influence of the currents of the Fire Grade.358"}]
