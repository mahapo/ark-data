Yetto date, very few of those who have written about it, have actually undergone the 5=6 ritual. Someoccult authors who have elaborated on what the psychological experiences are, in or after the 5=6ritual, are really talking from a very idealistic viewpoint with no practical experience to back it up.When Chris and I were first trained by the Adepts from the now defunct Whare Ra temple, wequi7zed them relentlessly about their personal experiences that they had both during and followingthe 5=6 ceremony. From talking to over 20 or so who went through the 5=6 ritual (and based onour own personal experiences) I have collated a great deal of information which I intend to try anddiscuss this subject, and also expel some of the myths concerning the effects of the 5=6 ceremony.When discussing the effects of this ceremony I shall also be referring to the Portal ritual as well, forit is very much a part of the 5=6.The first general statement is that the 5=6 ritual roughly equates with the third Masonicdegree and, in effect, releases the Kundaline. This statement tries to draw some sort of parallelbetween the 5=6 and Masonry. The effects of both rituals are entirely different, however, and the-current of energy one uses as a power base in the Masons does not equate with that of the 5=6. TheKundaline is not raised during the 5=6, nor as a direct result of that ritual. What happens both inMasonry and in the Golden Dawn's Inner Order, the Roseae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis, is that acertain type of alignment in the subtle bodies occurs which, in effect, affects mainly the five chakrasabove the head. These centres are not major ones but are too large to be classed as lvfmor, and to acertain extent they are in a type of no man's land in category, and not the seven on the body proper.I say this not as some sort of glib statement, but backed on my own work in testing those who wentthrough the 5=6 experience. As practising Radionic Therapists, we have worked with these energiesmany times, and are able to detect and localise their effect on the individual.The real effects that take place if the Kundaline was raised have been documented in the Westand I suggest the book `Kundaline - Psychosis or Transcendence' by Lee Sannella (M.D). Thisbook outlines in some detail what some of the Kundaline symptoms are and I would suggest the useof this as a guide line for anyone who thinks they have experienced or are experiencing Kundalinesymptoms. It would be safe to say that no one that I have met from Whare Ra who had gonethrough the 5=6 underwent the rising of the Kundaline. I would also ask those of you who are thirddegree Masons the same question. I mention all this because I want to approach the effects of the5=6 in real terms and not repeat in parrot fashion what has been handed down to us either from or-about the Golden Dawn.The 6=5 and 7=4 Grades are also not designed to raise the kundaline but to prepare the bodyby rectifying its polarity and fine tuning its Etheric, Astral and Mental densities so that anycommunication with the Higher Self will be more accurate. A common mistake for those who gothrough rituals such as the 5=6 is to experience heat surges (either during after the ceremonies) andattribute this to an activation of the kuridaline process. Generally speaking, many people who feel-heat surges in various body channels will find that they are heat surges or an activation of Chi flowand nothing more. These surges are a result of high density of energy, working through the variouschannels of the Etheric body. Sannella's work is very explicit on what to expect on this matter.Raising the kundaline is in real terms not that important; it is alignment that is important. When Iwas in India I saw Kundaline raised in people, deliberately, and while the effect was amazing, to mymind, it was very much like a cleansing process. The rituals of the Golden Dawn prepare the bodyone level at a time, and that is, I think, more important than trying to tap into the Kundaline.359"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The next point of interest is the Christ concept within the 5=6. The Second Order of theGolden Dawn has a strong Christ concept - make no mistake about it. But it is not like that of aChurch or any other type of Christian faith. This, of course, varied to a degree in later Temples,especially when many of those in the Order were Christian. Take, for example, Whare Ra Temple,where of those in the Order were devout Christians in which the 5=6 actually strengthened theirbeliefs. It would be fair comment to say that today, most people who practise the Golden Dawnrituals are non Christians and would have to 'bite the bullet' during certain aspects of the 5=6 whenthe name of Christ is mentioned. The name of Christ has power, but those in the Order tend to keepit as an abstract principle rather than as a fundamentalist belief. What many of us who were non-Christians did, who went through this ritual, accepted Christ from a Gnostic viewpoint and in thatway we found no clash with some of our more deeper spiritual brothers and sisters. The ChristCurrent is deep within the 5=6 rituals and one must accept it for what it is, or otherwise one willloose some of their power base.Moina Mathers, a Jew, says this on the subject of Christ, within the Golden Dawn context:...Christ says: \"Whosoever shall confess me before men shall the Son of Manalso confess before the Angels of God\"- signifying that he who shall raiseth himselfby linking his Human to his Divine Self; being consequently in touch with the Ketherof his Assiah, he shall be able to raise still further to the Plane of the Angels. That isto say, that through the Kether of his Assiah he can be admitted to his Plane ofYetzirah, his Angelic Self; for he has accepted the Christ within him, his power ofAscent. \"But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the Angels ofGod,\" meaning that he who denies the me, the power of the letter Shin, the letter ofthe Holy Spirit that makes of Jehovah the name Jeheshua, hath denied that Spirit,that Higher Self; which is his one link with the Truth of Life, and so hath refused theChrist that can be within, the only part which would enable him to rise to his DivineSelf; whence he could receive the Descent of the Divine Spirit, which ever comes tohim who seeketh for it...'Here she talks about Christ as a means to an end, but does not deny his way of peace andlove. To clarify this point even further, her husband and Founder of the Golden Dawn had this tosay:`...every now and then at the end of certain periods, there are greater crises in the World'sHistory than at any other periods, and at such times it becomes necessary that the Sons of Godshould be incarnated to lead on the New Era of the Universe. I do not affirm that Christ wasnecessarily a man who obtained Adeptship in that incarnation, but rather one who had adeptshipand come back down to be incarnated again to lead up a new era. It was, however, necessary in theCrucifixion of so great a Soul, so that the form might actually suffer, that everything except theNephesch should be withdrawn, which would be the reason of the cry of the Nephesch 'My God,My God Why hast Thou forsaken me?' For the Nephesch which was temporarily abandoned in thiscase was the cloak of that Incarnation. In other words, the only mortal part about the Man, or theGod, and then only after incurring that physical death, as it were, could the other Divine Partssuddenly come down and make it the resurrected or glorified body, which, according to thedescription, had after the Resurrection, the apparent solidity of the ordinary body, and the facultiesof the Spirit Body. Because if you can once get the great force of the Highest to send its ray cleandown through the Neschamah into the mind, and thence, into your physical body, the Nepheschwould be so transformed as to render you almost like a God walking this Earth.'Now from these two perspectives one can see the acceptance of Christ is not via the Christianreligion, but as a Master in his own right. It is very much in keeping with the Theosophical conceptof Christ as well. What both the Mathers have not said directly here, but is hinted at in the quotes,is that there are others whose name should be revered as well as that of Christ.360"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"It is rather surprising to see people accept Osiris and deny Christ as a god-form. Each has hisown particular power base that can be utilised if that form is evoked. To reject this out of hand is todeny the self: I say this because I have found this out through trial and error. When people talk tome of this point I try to point out that over the years with all the people praying to Christ one canfind that when they ask his help they can tap into a vast reservoir of energy. The mechanics of thisprinciple are explained in 'Holographic Universe' by Michael Talbot. Crowley was another one whowrote a great deal on Christ and accepted his power for what it was. You do not have to be aChristian to call on Christ for help, any more than one would have to be a member of the Temple ofIsis to call on her help as well. The myth of Christian Rosenkreutz is also an ideal, but an ideal thathas a lot of power. But emulating the resurrection principle of Rosenkreutz, Christ and Osiris, thevarious subtle bodies will tap into those power sources and will be able to direct our spiritual re-birth. By this I do not refer to the kundaline, but to other forms of energy in the subtle bodies andchalcras which are of equal importance.While I have addressed some of the major points of the Portal and 5=6 ceremony this is but inreality a stepping stone in explaining some of its secrets, a great many of which are still hidden.I would also stress that many of the explanations give in this book are skelatonic instructionalmaterial for the Higher grades (6=5 and 7=4).Pat ZalewskiWellington 1993361"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"362"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"363"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Portal Ceremonyof the Vault of the AdeptiOfficersChief Adept: White robe, yellow sash and shoes, red cloak of Hierophant, yellow and white nemyss, RoseCross on yellow collar, Sceptre of Five Elemental colors surmounted by Pentagram.Pentacle.

It is here given in the colors of the King Scale, and is also assignedto the Four Sephiroth ruling the grades of the Outer - Earth to Malkuth, Air to Yesod,Water to Hod and Fire to Netzach. It is again, the Cross which heads the Praemonstrator'sWand, who represents the Sephirah Chesed, the fourth Sephirah. Four is also the number ofJupiter, whose Path unites Chesed to Netzach. The Cross is therefore a fit emblem for thePhilosophus of the grade of 4 = 7.In this diagram are represented the Circle, the Point, the Line, the Cross, the Square and theCube. For the Circle is the Abyss, the Nothingness, the Ain. The Point is Kether. Now, thePoint has no dimension, but in moving, it traces the Line. This gives the First number -Unity - yet therein, lies duality unmanifest, for two points mark its ends. The movement ofthe Line maketh the Plane or Square thus (indicates). The motion of the Point at angles toits first direction and intersecting maketh the Cross. So therefore, are the Square and theCross but one symbol, deriving from the Circle and the Point.Below, is shown the Occult symbol of Malkuth, the Tenth Sephirah. It is in Four parts,corresponding to the Maltese Cross. They are Fire of Earth, Water of Earth, Air of Earthand Earth of Earth, as indicated by the Symbol. They correspond to the Four Grades of theFirst Order, which in one sense, quiteth not Malkuth, being the grades of the Four LowestSephiroth of Malkuth in Assiah.

Theinitials of the following sentence in Latin - the subtle fluid, the Light of the earth - make theword S.A.L.T. Salt, and further, the four words of the sentence answer to the FourElements: Subtilis - Air; Aqua - Water; Lux - Fire; Terra - Earth. And the four words yieldtwenty letters, that is, the product of the Four, the number of the Elements, multiplied byFive, the number of the Pentagram. The words Fiat Lux, meaning 'Let there be Light'consist of Seven letters. The letters of FIAT form the initials of Flatus - Air; Aqua - Water;Ignus - Fire and Terra - Earth. Which four names again yield twenty letters as in theprevious case. And the word LUX is formed from the angles of the Cross.(Hiereus leads Philosophus once around and then to Hegemon, who waits for them in theSouth and shows two diagrams there. Hiereus stands North of Altar and facing the Tabletin the Sign of the 1 = 10 Grade.)Hegemon:These are the Seven Holy Palaces of the Briatic World:The First is the Palace of the Holy of Holies, answering to Kether, Chokmah and Binah andthe Divine name El.The Second is the Palace of Love, answering the Chesed and the Divine Name Matzpatzwhich is the Temurah of Tetragrammaton.The Third is the Palace of Merit, answering to Geburah and the Divine Name Yehevid.The Fourth is the Palace of Benevolence, answering to Tiphareth andTetragrammaton.The Fifth is the Palace of the Substance of Heaven, answering to Netzach andElohim.The Sixth is the Palace of Serenity, answering to Hod and Matzpatz.The Seventh is the Palace of Crystal Whiteness, answering to Yesod and Malkuth and to theDivine Name Yah and Adonai. But the synthesis and the sum of these Holy Names is foundin the word Taklith - Perfection.(Hegemon takes Philosophus to 2nd Diagram.)The Seraphim in the vision of Isaiah are described as having six wings: 'With twain Hecovered his face, and with twain He covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.' That is, hissynthesis is to be found in the Hexagram and in the idea of the Seven, more especiallydominating the planetary region. But the Kerubim of Ezekiel have each four faces - those ofthe Lion, the Bull, the Man and the Eagle counterchanged with each other by revolution,whence the symbolic forms of wheels beside them, wherein was the Spirit; and with the twoof the wings they covered their bodies and two were stretched upwards one to another. Sothe synthesis of the Kerubim is found in the revolving Cross, in the Pentagram, and in theidea of one Spirit dominating the Four Elements. But the Kerubim of St. John's vision inthe Apocalypse are uncompounded, having single heads, but they have six wings and thusunite the powers of the Seven with the Four. And their cry is similar to the Seraphim ofIsaiah: 'Holy, Holy. Holy'.(Hegemon stands East of Altar facing tablet in Sign of 2 = 9.

In a field he is reaping off with the Scythe of Death the fresh vegetationwhich springs from corrupting bodies buried therein, fragments of which, such as handsheads and feet appear above the soil. Bones are also strewn upon the surface. One of theheads wears a kingly crown; another is apparently that of a person of little note showingthat Death is the equaliser of all conditions. The five extremities, the head, hands and feet,allude to the powers of the number five, the letter Heh, the Pentagram, the concealed Spiritof Life and the Four Elements, the originator of all living form.The Sign of Scorpio especially alludes to the stagnant and fetid water, that property of themoist nature which initiates Putrefaction and decay. The eternal change from life into deaththrough death into life, is symbolised by the grass which springs from and is nourished byputrefying and corrupting carcasses; the herbage, in its turn affords food to animals andman, which when dead, nourishes vegetable life and brings to growth and perfection theliving herbage. This is further shown by the figure itself putrefying and decaying as it reapsthe grass of the field. 'As for man, his days are as grass, as a flower of the field so heflourisheth.' The top of the scythe forms the Tau Cross of Life showing that what destroysalso renews.The whole is a representation of the eternal transmutation of the life of nature, whichreforms all things into fresh images and similitudes. This symbol represents the corrosiveand destructive action of the infernal fire as opposed to the Celestial, the Dragon of theWaters, the Typhon of the Egyptians, the Slayer of Osiris which later yet rises again inHorus. The Scorpion, Serpent of Evil, delineated before the figure of Death in the moreancient form of the Key, refers to the mixed and transforming, therefore deceptive, nature ofthis emblem. Behind him is the symbol of the Nameless One, representing the seed and itsgerm, not yet differentiated into Life, therefore incapable of definition. The Scorpion is theemblem of the ruthless destruction; the Snake is the mixed and deceptive nature, servingalike for good and evil; the Eagle is the Higher and the Divine Nature, yet to be foundherein, the alchemical Eagle of Distillation, the Renewer of Life.

The brow denotes the confusionof opposing Elemental Forces in the higher regions of the Air, and the confusion of mindand madness in man. The eyes are the devouring flames of lust and violence - the breath isstorm, devastation and rage, alike in the Universe which is the greater world, and in manwho is the lesser. The arms and the hands are the swift executors of the evil works, thebringers of pestilence and disease.

That is, that in it, there is everpresent the temptation to turn aside to the one hand or to the other.(Second and Third Adept gives Blue Cup and Red Lamp to Philosophus, who holds them inthe form of a Tau Cross.)Let this remind you once more, that only in and by the reconciliation of opposing forces isthe pathway made to true Occult knowledge and practical power. Good alone is mighty,and Truth shall prevail. Evil is but weakness, and the power of evil magic exists but in thecontent of unbalanced forces, which in the end will destroy and ruin him who hathsubjugated himself thereto. As it is said: \"Stoop not down, for a precipice lieth beneath theEarth, a descent of seven steps; and therein is established the throne of an evil and fatalforce. Stoop not down unto that dark and lurid world. Defile not thy brilliant flame withthe earthly dross of matter. Stoop not down, for its splendour is but seeming, it is but thehabitation of the Sons of the Unhappy\".(Second and Third Adept take back Red Lamp and Blue Cup and restore them to theirTablets. On the Altar is the White Lamp and the Tablet of Union. A seat is given toPhilosophus, West of Altar. Second and Third Adept return to their places; Hiereus Northand Hegemon South. Chief Adept returns to the Throne in East. He then takes up Bannerof the East and the Hierophant's Lamers.)Seeing that you are now Lord of the Paths of the Portal of the Vault of the Adepti, and areentered into the Second Degree, approaching the Second or Inner Order, it is fitting that388"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"you should have the knowledge of these emblems, to complete, so far as may be, yourunderstanding of the Powers of the First or Outer Order.

The two colors, red and green,the most active and the most passive, whose conjunction points out the practical applicationof the knowledge of equilibrium, are symbolic of the reconciliation of the celestial essencesof Fire and Water, for the reconciling yellow unites with blue and green, which is thecomplementary color to red, and with red in orange which is the complementary color toblue. The small inner circle placed upon the Cross alludes to the rose that is conjoinedtherewith the symbolism of the Rose and Cross of our Order.The field of the Banner of the East is White, the color of Light and purity. As in theprevious case, the Calvary Cross of Six squares is the number Six of Tiphareth, the yellowCross of Solar Gold, and cubical stone, bearing in its centre the sacred Tau of Life, andhaving bound together upon it, the form of the Macrocosmic Hexagram, the red triangle ofFire and the blue triangle of Water, the Ruach Elohim and the Waters of Creation. The Sixangles of the Hexagram described upon the Tree of Life will give the Planets referred to itas follows: Daath\\ Saturn; Chesedljupiter; Mars\\ Geburah; Netzach\\Venus; Hod \\Mercury;Yesod \\Luna, while in the center is the Sun in Tiphareth.Upon my breast is a symbol, which, 0 Lord of the. Paths of the Portal of the Adepti, is asyet unknown to you. It is no symbol of the Order of the Golden Dawn, nor of the First orOuter Order, nor even of your Degree. It is a symbol of the Red Rose and the Cross ofGold, uniting powers of the Four, Five and Six within itself, but to learn its full meaning, itis needful that you be admitted to the fellowship of that other Order to which the GoldenDawn is but one of the Veils. Of this matter, you have no right to speak to anyone belowyour degree.Admission further can be earned no more by excellence in intellectual learning alone, thoughthat also is required of you. In token that all true knowledge cometh of grace, not of right,such admission is granted, not on demand, but at the discretion of the greatly HonouredChiefs of the Second Order. Moreover, an interval of nine months must elapse before thePortal is opened again to you. Nine is the number of Luna in Yesod, nine Luna months arethe period of gestation before birth; Five is the number of the Pentagram of the IVlicrocosm,the esoteric Luna number, the number of the Spirit and the Four Elements, of the Soulentering a body. Nine multiplied by Five yields 45, the number of Yesod, and the supremenumber of the Square of Saturn, as the Triad expanded into matter.ClosingChief Adept: (knocks)Very Honoured Fraters and Sorores, assist me to close the Portal of the Vault of the Adepti.(All rise.)389"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Honoured Hiereus, see the entrance is properly guarded.Hiereus:Very Honoured Chief Adept, the entrance is properly guarded.Chief Adept:Very Honoured Fraters and Sorores, give the Signs of the Neophyte, Zelator, Theoricus,Practicus and Philosophus.

He was of noble German family, butpoor, and in the fifth year of his age was placed in a cloister where he learned both Greek and Latin. Whileyet a youth he accompanied a certain brother PAL. on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, but the latter, dyingat Cyprus, he himselfwent to Damascus. There then was in Arabia a Temple of the Order which was calledin the Hebrew tongue \"Dmitkar\" (DMKR), that is 'Me Blood ofthe Lamb.\" There he was duly initiated,and took the Mystic title ChristianRosenkreutz, or Christian ofthe Rosy Cross. He then so far improved hisknowledge ofthe Arabian tongue that in the following year he translated the book 'M\" into Latin, which heafterwards brought back with him to Europe.After three years he went on into Egypt, where there was another Temple ofthe Order. There he remainedfor a time still studying the mysteries ofNature. After this, he travelled by sea to the city of Fessa, where hewas welcomed at the Temple there established, and he there obtained the knowledge and the acquaintanceof the habitants of the Elements, who revealed unto him many of their secrets. Of the Fraternity heconfessed that they had not retained their Wisdom hi its primal purity, and that their Kabbalah was to acertain extent altered to their religion. Nevertheless, he learned much there. After a stay of two years hecame to Spain, where he endeavored to reform the errors ofthe learned accorrImg to the pure knowledge hehad received But it was to them a laughing matter, and they reviled and rejected him, even as the prophetsofold were rejected. Thus also was hetreated by those ofhis own and other nations when he showed themthe errors that had crept into the religions. So, after five years residence in Germany, he initiated three of hisforme' monastic brethren, fluters G.W., LA, and 10., who had more knowledge than many others at thattime. And by these four was made the foundation ofthe Fraternity in Europe.These worked and studied at the writings and other knowledge which CRC. had brought with him, and bythem was some of the magical Language transcribed (which is that of the Elemental Tablets) and adictionary thereofmade; and the rituals and part ofthe book \"M\" were transcribed.For the True Order ofthe Rose Cross descended into the depths, and ascendeth into the heights, even untothe Throne of God Himself and inoludeth even Archangels, Angels and Spirits.These four freers also erected a building to serve for the Temple and headquarters oftheir Order, and calledit the Collegian ad Spiritum Sanctum, or the College of the Holy Spirit. This being now finished, and thework of establishing the Order extremely heavy, and because they devoted much time to the healing ofthosesick and possessed, who resorted to them, they initiated four others, vis.: Fraters RC.

In the past rituals up to this point, all the elements of nature were handled in separate graderituals. In the Portal ceremony all these elements are now presented in a unified format with thepurpose of fusing them all together, so that a solid base can be worked on by the Adept before thenext step.By presenting the elements in this fashion, as a unified force, a second type of purging processbegins regarding any elemental imbalances in the psychological and physical makeup, that have notbeen rectified in the previous rituals. In Kabbalistic terms one is preparing the Neshamah for itsunification with the Ruach. Utilising the same precepts through the subtle bodies one will find thatthe real pressure will be brought to bear on the alignment between the subtle bodies that collectivelymake up the Ego, the Physical, Etheric, Astral\\Emotional and Lower mental. Now in relation to thispurging process that is mentioned above, It is very real. Unfortunately some Chiefs of temples bothwithin the. Golden dawn and Stella Matutina ignored it. There are two reasons for the long waitbetween Portal and 5=6. The first was that in the old Order they wanted to have a breather betweenrituals as the Temple Officers felt they were forever doing 5=6 rituals and it gave them a wellneeded break. The second and more important reason was that many people found that after thePortal the person would have a type of delayed effect in getting rid of excessive or latent problemshidden within the psyche and this wait allowed the problems to come to the surface in a naturalmanner. It is very much in tune with the Homeopathic concept of the 'healing crises'. Some yearsago I pressured my friend and mentor from Whare Ra, Jack Taylor about this he said:`Unfortunately a number of the Ilierophants we had at Whare Ra did not understand fullythe concept of waiting between rituals and tended to rush their favoured pupils through tothe Inner order before they were ready. The wait between the Portal and 5=6 was a goodcase in point. There was one good example where a husband and wife who were putthrough the Portal and within a very short time period, the then Hierophant, wanted to putthem through the 5=6. Neither of these people were in any way ready for the 5=6 and bothshowed signs of very tense behaviour that is associated with the releasing of negativeenergy, which the Portal tends to act as a catalyst for. Just before their 5=6, they had aviolent argument and they separated briefly from each other and going through the 5=6 wasthe last thing on their mind. The ritual was postponed even though the then Hierophant toldthem it would be better for them to go through it so that it could help solve their problems.When I heard this I approached Mrs. Felkin and told her what had happened she made it apoint to see the couple, and concurred with my own observations that they were not readyfor the 5=6, then she gave the Hierophant a good dressing down for not using commonsense. A few months later the couple sorted out their problems and eventually went throughthe 5=6 and went on to have a very stable relationship.'Taylor maintained that incidents like this became more common place after the death of NfissFelkin. There was a true lack of understanding of the need for time between rituals as a healingconcept.When the Portal aligns the subtle bodies of the Ego the vibrational effects of the shifting bringabout the 'Healing crises' mentioned earlier. What actually happens is that in most people one willfind a non alignment of at least one or more of these subtle bodies and sometimes there is anoverlap. Generally people learn to live with this overlap and the subtle bodies compensate for it.But when a misalignment occurs, it causes a vacuum or a longing for something was never right inthe first place. As an example one could use and unhealthy relationship, or have very strong interestin something that one has no business being near in the first place. When an alignment occurs thesubtle bodies and chakras have to rebalance. In some instances the Etheric fluid that separates the422"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"subtle bodies has been drained and it needs to re-establish itself and this takes time. It acts as abuffer between the subtle bodies, so that one body cannot overlap and take over the next. When thisdoes occur both delusions and illusions can manifest within a psychopathic framework. A wellbalanced person will experience none of these difficulties on any conscious level. A person with adeep seated emotional problem will find that the alignment being corrected can cause problems inthe Astral\\Emotional body where the negative or excessive energy was either blocked off or beingthrown directly down into the Etheric body. This will manifest in a number of small ailments such asskin rashes to strong mood swings, again this all depends on individuals and how well balanced theyare when they undergo the Portal. Ultimately these are healing reactions and once problemsmanifest, they are worked through and cleared. Whenever a person is ready to go through thePortal and there is still some imbalance in the subtle bodies that is not self correcting in time, someflower essences can make a remarkable difference. Also, I have used gem remedies which haveproved effective.As a Radionic Therapist, alignments and miss alignments as well as chakra balancing can-easily be detected, and for me personally, is a good measuring stick on how a person is comingalong during the wait between Portal and 5=6. In many ways the Portal is tailor made for this typeof research. Others may prefer to use different methods of approach but any Chief of any Golden-Dawn temple should have a good knowledge of subtle body anatomy, for it is needed in the 5=6grades (the grades above it) to know how one functions on different levels. When you study thePortal Address by Mrs. Felkin you will note that she also worked in the area of the subtle bodiesand her descriptions of what happens to a person at the Portal level show a deep understanding.Most of this, though, came from her study of Alice Bailey's volumes which are collectively titled`Treatise on Seven Rays'.When we first started training under Taylor, he mentioned the effect on the subtle bodies anumber of times and I tried to translate this more in line with the Kabbalistic Soul, but becameincreasingly frustrated with the limited and contradictory descriptions of the Kabbalistic Soul and itsperformance. Neither Chris nor I paid much attention to functions and effects of the subtle bodiesother than a general understanding of their functions, until we started studying Radionics, then webegan to appreciate what Taylor was getting at. It also took a good few years to fully understandsome of the meanings of ritual instruction Taylor gave in terms of subtle anatomy.Now I have mentioned the word 'alignment' a number of times. In its mundane concept manyof you will think that this relates to the balancing up of certain core components of the personality.This is quite correct, but this alignment is a form of preparation of things to come. When all thesubtle bodies and chakras are aligned then the Higher Self (consisting of the Higher Mental, Casualand Spiritual Bodies) starts communicating its directions to us in a much more clearer form thanbefore. We then start becoming more aware of our functions upon this level of existence. ThePortal is a grade of preparation for this contact. I would also point out that there are a number ofcopying errors in both Regardie's publications of the Portal ritual. Most of these allude tomovement patterns both before and after various speeches, though there are some changes to thecostumes and apparel of the 2nd and 3rd Adept I have gone over these and corrected them wherenecessary. Also you may notice the extraordinary number of diagrams missing in the previouspublications. It would be fair to say that the Portal was the ritual most tampered with by individualGolden Dawn Temples and those in the Stella Matutina. Taylor informed me that Mathers madesome of those changes after some instructions were found to be impractical.SYMBOLISM OF THE TEMPLETHE INVISIBLE STATIONS OF THE GOD-FORMSSETThis Jackal headed God-form stands in front of the Letter Ayin.

The Five points of the Pentagram relate to theSephirah of Yesod (according to additional notes to my PortalCopy) and as such, constitute the Sephirah ABOVE Malkuth.The basic theory here is that the extra dimension of Spirit takesthe Four Elements into a higher level.In the speech of the Hiereus, the symbolism of the MalteseCross is explained in terms of relating to the Four Elements, theFour Sephirah and the Cross of the Praemonstrator. The Crossitself is within the boundary of the Sephirah of Malkuth. Itshidden meaning is through the watery influence of Chesed foreach arm of the Cross also represents a river of Eden. In thisdiagram the boundaries of the Old Eden do not exist for it isentrapped in the elements and as such man has tried to create hisown replica of the Perfected State.This perfected State of the Elements, in this instance, isInitiation, through which Man strives to achieve what he had inEden. It is also a symbol of the four states of alchemy - theReddening, the Blackening, the Yellowing and the Whitening.Another look at the Cross will show it as a symbol of thecrucified man seeking Redemption. The redemption he seeks isfor his sins. The Four arms of the Cross show the Four Lower subtle bodies of the Ego - Physical,Etheric, Astral\\Emotional and Lower Mental. This diagram shows the properly aligned bodieswhich man aspires to and as such has purified Lower Nature and made it ready to receive theimpetus from the Higher Self. When the correct input comes down across the gulf then the shacklesof Malkuth are loosened and he can rightfully take his place outside the bounds of mortality.The four divisions of Malkuth relate to the Four Grades of the First Order and to the Rite ofthe Cross. The four divisions of Malkuth are as follows:Black Earth of EarthBrown Fire of EarthCitrine Air of EarthOlive Water of Earth424"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"From the Black is purified the Lighter Brown of the Cross in the 1-10 Grade. From the Brown ofMalkuth, the pure Red of Fire in the 4=7 Grade. From the Olive, the Blue of Water in the 3=8Grade. From the Citrine the Yellow of Air in the 2=9 Grade.The two symbols of the Pentagram and Cross mutually act and re-act. Here represented inMalkuth and Yesod, they also refer the Pentagram to Geburah and the Cross to Chesed, for 5 is anumber of Mars and Geburah, while 4 is a number of Jupiter and Chesed. Thus two symbols alsosuggest the interaction and inter-changingactivities of the Black and White Pillars.Ain into Matter. The diagram for this is really self explanatory,however the following notes from aconversation with Taylor on this show thisdiagram from a slightly different perspective:We must consider that when the LimitlessLight enters this Universe it is in itself trappedby the fourfold nature of the Elements and alsothe fourfold nature of the Holy Name YHVH.Like this universe itself the Fourfold nature ismulti-layered and from this the Cube of theUniverse is formed Kabbalistically from theSepher Yetzirah.What Taylor meant was that when the cube isformed, each line of that cube relates to a Pathof the Kabbalah. The following diagram mayhelp explain this concept a lot easier when theTarot Trumps are substituted for the paths,starting with Tau as the central point or Ain.Diagram of MalkuthThe Diagram of Malkuth andits paths in relation to the Sephirothof the First Order further explains thestructure of the Equated Cross of theFour Elements. The White Hexagramshows the reflection of Kether,working through both Tiphareth andYesod upon Malkuth. Within thephysical matter of Malkuth the sevenstage (6 points including the centre)pulse of creation is inherent. TheHexagram in this instance is nottrapped in matter but, is a hiddenaspect of it. The Higher side of thisdiagram shows Tiphareth in Malkuth. Now that the Four Elements have been equilibrated into aunified force, the 6 pointed Star of Light now is activated and holds together the four rectifiedelements.The Four parts of Malkuth are analogous to the four lower Sephiroth of the Elements -Malkuth, Yesod, Hod and Netzach while the six pointed Hexagram is analogous to the six"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Sephiroth of the Second and Third Orders, hence the brilliant white of Kether on the Elementalcolours of Malkuth. The White boundary, around Malkuth is the LIGHT of initiations that bindsthem together and also shows that the elements have purified. This produces the ideal vessel inmatter for the LIGHT to descend into. Using Gematria, the numerical value of the name Malkuth -MIXTh equates to 496, which also relates to Leviathan -LUIThN, which relates to the greatSerpent of the Tree that resides in Malkuth. When the Serpent rises it embraces all the Paths of theTree. This in turn relates to the Eastern concept of the Kundaline, the latent energy that will risethrough the Chakras on the spine.Grade Structure of the OrderThere are two trees in this Diagram.The first Tree on the left hand side is onemost of you will be familiar with for it givesthe Ten Sephirotic Grades (The Babe of theAbyss is a type of Portal for the 8=3 ritual ofthe Stella Matutina). The main differenceBetween the Golden Dawn temples underMathers and those of the Stella Matutina wasthe fact that the Golden Dawn temples wentas high as the Second Order only, 7=4, whilein the Stella Matutina the Grades of the ThirdOrder were opened up to the rank of 10=1,though to the best of my knowledge thehighest rank obtained was 9=2. Since theLower Order has already been explained inprevious books I will devote some attentionto the subject of the Third Order, the onewhich is the most controversial in the GoldenDawn.The Third Order was said to be a legionof Masters who guided and directed humanitythrough esoteric thought. When the Felldnsand Neville Meakin claimed the grades of theThird Order they maintained that they hadcontacted this Order and as such were being guided by it by various spiritual guides. As such, sincethey were their representatives, they claimed the physical grades on their behalf. The whole conceptof the Third Order grades is really one of semantics. Some years ago when I quizzed a former Chiefof Whare Ra, Bettany Jones, on the Higher Grades, their significance and teachings, I was told thatthe Higher Grades were merely temple Grades. By that she meant grades given out to those whohad served the Order long and faithfully, and there was never any connection to the Third Order, orin fact, no one believed because they had obtained the 8=3 that they had reached the Third Order,as some occult authors would have us believe. The Second Order shows the fledging magician inthe Zelator Adeptus Minor Grade to the Exempt Adeptus, a point where the Adept has masteredhis powers and is not ready to go further into the Abyss. Mrs. Felkin often told Jack Taylor that the7=4 was the last of the physical grades.The Diagram on the right shows a tentative arrangement of what some consider the Truescheme of a genuine Occult Order on the Tree. There are nine possible stages. The 33degrees of Masonry are mistaken, 9 being 3.3, i.e. 3 x 3, as X x X = X squared, not 10 x =x. The Freemasons misled this notation, and have yet in it preserved the true fact. Now ofthree degrees only five can be conferred effectively in a ritual physically expressed. Hence,in one sense the 5th degree is in Kether, but in, another is written 7=4.426"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The words around the Inner Circle are`Visita Interiora Terrae Rectifando InveniesOccultum Lapidem' which translated means`Visit the interior of the earth, in purifyingyou discover the hidden stone.' This conceptis multi layered and in Alchemicalterminology relates to the Adept finding thePhilosophers Stone through a discovery ofthe First Matter. The initials of each wordaround the rim make up the name VITRIOL,which most assume is a type of Antinomy,so that it is more than likely that the searchin the earth relates to the ore Stibinite. Onyet another level, it tells the Adept that he orshe must delve deep within their own natureto discover their true essence and that thismust be done through the varying stages_ _ shown in the seven pointed Star.If you study other versions of this diagram you will find that the planetary positioning hasbeen altered to fit the Sephiroth of Yesod to Chesed. This relates very much to the previousdiagrams of the Golden Dawn grade structure. The point related to Saturn here is the exceptionandwe see that Saturn is now related to Malkuth because of its earthy nature. All of these grades noware within the First and Second Orders. If we closely follow the drawing we will find that this sametheme is reinforced.1.The bird (possibly a crow) on the skull relates to the Zelator grade of Earth. This relates to theDead Head in Alchemy and also to the Blackening process. The Zelator is now aware of hismortality and his spirit seeks to strive upwards but is still attached to the body.2.The next image shows the bird looking at his own reflection. This is part of the transformationprocess where the Dead Head is now placed back within the body of the experimented and isrejuvenated to its former glory. This is the Theoricus grade with its Luna influence in which itsreflective nature shows the gains made by the Spiritual side of the nature.3. Here we have two birds raising the Spirit which is still in matter. This shows the Higher Self hascalled in help to raise the matter to a further state through twin or successive distillations. This isthe Practicus Grade of Water.4.In this step two birds are flying upwards with a Crown between their beaks. This is the middlepoint of the experiment and is the halfway between the Fiery and watery natures in the oppositecorners of the large triangle. The transformation stage and structure of the mineral is now shown atthe Red or fiery stage of the experiment. This is also the Fire Grade of Philosophus, the gradewhere the last of the elements are now fused together.5.The two birds on the Tree branch show the growth of the Stone in the form of a tree, the twobird showing the various colours attached to the growth. This is the Grade of Zelator AdeptusMinor where the Adept has attained the level he seeks but must first wait for the growth andexperience to go with it.6. This shows a unicorn under a growing tree filled with flowers. Here the Alchemist takes the partof the unicorn in the form of a guardian of the tree and his watchfulness will be ready to emit thepoisons or impurities when they first appear. Also this shows the appearance of the red (flowers)and white (unicorn) stage of the experiment simultaneously. This is the grade of Adeptus Major.The Adept has gone out into the world of magic and been successful but still has many more thingsto learn.7. The final pictorial shows the figure of a young babe emerging from the womb of the stone itself.427"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"This is the resurrection showing the immortality of the stone and its effects. This is the grade ofExemptus Adeptus where the Adept had flowered to full maturity.The centre piece of the experiment shows the longevity of the results from taking the part ofthe stone, a complete transformation of the basic Salt, Mercury and Sulphur of the body. This, inGolden Dawn terms, is the Third Order.The Queen on the Dolphin represents the Watery nature of the Experiment while the King onthe Lion symbolises the fiery aspect which is not unlike the symbology of the Black and Whitepillars. The winged bird and salamander (resting on each upper corner of the triangle) shows the fireand airy nature of the work -balance- further shown by the horn of Water and torch of Fire. TheBody of Salt, in the cube, is the raw nature of the work that must be the transmuted and isanalagous to the Neophyte.In the 4=7 ritual the Image and History ofNebuchadnezzar was explained. In this Portalritual the Vision of what Nebuchadnezzar saw,which came to him in a dream, is the main pointon interest. The interpretation of this dream isgiven in Daniel 36 - 45. The dream of the Kingshowed a statue that represented the future ofthe history of Babylon. It showedNebuchadnezzar as a great King but those whocame after him could not hold onto the Kingdomthat the King now had, unless the true God wasacknowledged and worshipped. For the King sawhis world as the totality and could not thinkbeyond the material and power he possessed andforgot the spirit which guided him. The dreamshowed his mortality and that of his Kingdomand it was to remind the King that his powercomes from a Higher Source. While had hepossessions today, he and his successors wouldnot possess them tomorrow and with time wentdestruction.In the drawing of the statue you will noticethat the horn of Water is placed over the torch of Fire. The Water is putting out the Fire, and theresult that both these elements will be self destructive to each other, as the Water puts out the firethe horn becomes empty and the elements cease to exist, and the whole balance is destroyed in theprocess of time. It shows that balance and restraint is needed for things to grow and develop. Alsoin the drawing you will see a number of people lined up for worship of the statue as the Lightningstrikes at it. What they worship is material power and not the spiritual side of their natures. Thebuildings in the backgxound have grown since the drawing of the King was shown in the 4=7 andthis to, shows the passage of time on the elements.Certain Latin Words Analyzed. This diagram came from the Golden Dawn Cipher manuscript and is at first glance just a smalltreatise on word games. Yet if an in-depth study is done, it becomes extremely complex. The actualdiagram comes from 'Aurora of the Philosphers' by Paracelsus. The reality is that if you wish tostudy the diagram and its meanings you will need to study the works of Paracelsus and the`Aurora'. I would suggest that Golden Dawn Chiefs who have students at the Portal level get themto study the 'Aurora' as a guide to understanding this diagram more fully. I also feel, that tounderstand this correctly, one would have to be practising alchemist who was using mineral work.The following text is a quote from Chapter 12 of the 'Aurora of the Philosphers.'928"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"`Vitriol is a very noble mineral amongthe rest, and was held always in highestestimation by the philosophers, because themost High God has adorned it withwonderful gifts. They have veiled itsarcanum in enigmatic figures like thefollowing \"Thou shalt go to inner parts ofthe earth, and by rectification thou shalt findthe occult stone, a true medicine.\" By theearth they understood the Vitriol itself; andby the inner parts of the earth its sweetnessand redness, because in the occult part ofVitriol lies hid a subtle, noble and mostfragrant juice, and pure oil. The method ofits production is not to approached bycalcination or distillation...'Seven Palaces of Holiness.To understand the meanings of the variousnames associated with the Seven Palaces,the Chiefs of the temple should get theAspirant to sit and meditate on each level ofthe heavens (starting from the bottom) andthen put ones own interpretation on themeanings of each level one reaches. Taylortold me years ago that to a certain extentthe names of each of these heavenswould be meaningless unless oneunderstood the Kabbalah from theviewpoint of the Jew (which I do notclaim to) who has had formal training inthe significance of each level. WhatTaylor did do. was to make me sit andmeditate on the Hebrew letters andafter about ten minutes or longer hewould then get me to write down whatI had seen. He told me that, like tarotvisions, no two were alike and that themeditation alone on the Hebrew letters,for each level, would open up newlayers of the psyche. He often felt thatto try and put a specific meaning toeach level was asking for trouble for itdid not take into account the growthand development of the individual at thetime of the meditation. He consideredthat the Hebrew names associated witheach level were nothing more than aladder or doorway to the unconscious and the Astral. My suggestion to the readers is to takeTaylor's advice, and meditate like I did in front of the letters and record your own experiences.429"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Also with the initial letter of Ph (where he was born) brings us to the value of 80 which links us toKS meaning 'a throne' which refers to Tiphareth's Higher nature, Kether.b. The Wand of the Chief Adept consists of the Four Elemental colours plus spirit. From the base,-the first colour is black and relates not only to the Earth but also to the Sephiroth of Malkuth. Thenext colour is blue and relates not only to the. Water Element but to the Sephiroth of Hod. TheYellow part of the wand relates to Air and Yesod. The red part to Fire and Netzach. The Whitepart relates to Spirit and Tiphareth. The White Pentagram shows these four forces working throughthe realm of the Spirit but approachedthrough the rectified Elements.To fully understand the Wand of theChief Adept and also the Wands of theSecond and Third Adept, a rudimentaryknowledge of Alchemy is required. Nowtaking the Wand of the Chief Adept as an-example, with some additional alchemicalsymbolism to make its full significanceclearer:-The top point of the Pentagram representsthe Hyle, Spirit or Chaos State. The Hyleis separated into polarity - Positive and-negative, which in alchemical terms can beassociated with Nitre (Positive) and Salt(Negative). If you study the Pentagramdiagram you will note that Nitrerepresents the Elements of Fire and Air,while Salt represents the elements of Earthand Water. Now utilising Nitre and toobtain Sulphur, one must unite Fire andAir. For salt one must unite Water and Earth. In the diagram the Pentagram shows the connectionswith each other for when the end results and Sulphur and Salt are obtained they are united to formMercury.When Hebrew letters are associated with this it gives the name YEHESHUA which meansthe 'spirit of God' (which the Chief Adept represents) both acting through and uniting the elements.c. The White robe stands for the Inner Order which he represents and the yellow shoes show that heworks from the Sphere of Tiphareth. The red cloak shows that he is the driving force of fire and hasmuch the same meaning as given in the 0=0 book. Taylor also had this to say about the-Hierophant's cloak when I asked him if the symbolism changed in the Portal.`Its base meaning does not change but I have always thought that in the Portal thesymbolism of the Cloak reminds me of the flame of the ever-burning lamps of theRosicrucians. For the flame in theory is not extinguishable and as such refers directly to theHidden Mysteries of the Order for the flame and cloak is like the Outer Robe of Glory andis something than can be worn without because it comes from within.'The yellow ribbon for the Rose Cross relates to Tiphareth. This is worn over the lamen of theHierophant. The White Lamp also relates to Spirit and the letter Shin which is analogous with theTarot Key 'Judgement' and as such shows the rejuvenation aspect of the Key. The body andconscious mind are about to be transformed. The Brazier shows the warmth it gives to the Spiritwhen the mysteries are studied for the betterment of self. The yellow candle also relates to the waythe Second Order is light for you to see. Both the Brazier and candle are behind the closed veil butthey can be seen from the temple floor.431"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"the wand represents Fire while the bottomsymbolism shows the active principle of Nitre.c.

The lamen is a Red triangle of Fire in a GreenPentagram. The Fire triangle clearly symbolises the active Nitre principle while the green Pentagramsymbolises the framework through which it operates.

This relates to the AGPhand implies 'anger'. In the Z 5, Book I, we are told:The station of the Hiereus is in the extreme West of the temple ....Representing the terribleAvenging God at the confines of matter, at the borders of the Qlippoth, He or she isenthroned upon matter and robed in darkness.'The function of the Hiereus is to keep the forces of Light focused on the negative gateway in theWest.b. The Sword and Lamen of the Hiereus has also been explained in Book 1 of the Z 5 series andloosely represents the forces of the pillar of Severity.-c. The Hiereus, as usual is in black (his or her nemyss is black and white but this is the same nemyssthat he wears from the Neophyte ritual onwards) and relates to the Earth element and the Sephirahof Malkuth. There is one change only to the costume of the Hiereus in this ritual, as compared to-his or her costume in the Outer Order ceremonies and that is the introduction of the white Sash ofthe Second Order.5.a. The station of Hegemon represents Frater G.G.M.P.I. By Gematria this adds up to 132 which-relates to QBL meaning 'to receive' and relates directly to the Kabbalah itself. This particular Fraterwas also known in the manifestos as aKabbalist, which the gematria seems toconfirm.b.The Hegemon's costume differs in two areashere from her Outer Order costume. The first isthe nemyss which was white and is now Yellowand purple striped. This is because theHegemon represents the station of Yesod andthe Element of Air. The Purple of Yesod andthe Yellow of Air are combined in her nemyss(which are also complementary to each other).c.The Lamen of the Hegemon differs here fromthe Outer Order. The Red and Blue Hexagram(on a White background) she wears will berecognised as the same that is on the Banner ofthe East. It is a symbol of balance andunification. This is also the exact function theHegemon has on the temple. To a certainextent the Officer of Hegemon is a lower-octave of the Chief Adept in Tiphareth.SYMBOLISM OF THE OPENINGThe floor plan of the Temple Officers is that of the lower five Sephiroth of the Tree of Life.The Chief Adept, sits in Tiphareth which is behind the veil. The veil is of course symbolical as thegulf or bridge that separates the First and Second Orders and as such it is closed because it will notbe immediately visible to the Postulant.Apart from the usual preparatory procedures of ritual ceremonies one will find that the-meditation effect of the Portal grade is quite different for each temple Officer when done correctly.Taylor imparted the following to us one day when I queried him about the meditational proceduresof the Temple Officers for the Portal Grade.\"I was taught a method of group meditation for the Portal by Mrs. Felkin. Just before theritual, all the Officers would stand in the form of a Cross of the Elements with me as Chief433"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Adept in the centre and we would then recite a verse five times.`At the Ending of Night.At the Limits of Light.Thoth stood before the Unborn Ones of Time.Then was formulated the Universe.Then came forth the Gods thereof.The Aeons of the Bomless beyond.Then the voice vibrated.Then the name was declared.At the threshhold of the Entrance.Between the Universe and the Infinite.In the Sign of the Enterer, stood Thoth.As before Him were the Aeons proclaimed.In Breath did he Vibrate them.In symbols did he record them.For betwixt the Light and darkness did he stand.'This of course came from the Z 1 paper. I found this very effective at getting the Officers to workas a group. I would then get each Officer to do an invocation in front of the Enochian Tablet theyrepresented. Mrs. Felkin told me that it was done this way in the old Order (Golden Dawn)\".The first knock activates the Energy of the Sephirah of Netzach. This is done with the base ofthe Sulphur wand on the floor and represents the Nitre or activating principle of Alchemy.Clairvoyant analysis shOws it has the effect of equilibrating the Etheric bodies of the Officers andaligning the Etheric Bodies with the Energy of the Sephirah. The Astral Bodies of the Officers workdirectly with the Elemental Energy of the Tablets. During the invocation of the Tablets by theOfficers before the start of the ceremony, the Officers consciously link their Astral forms with thatof the Tablets (the Chief Adept links to the Tablet of Union).When the Hiereus is asked if the Portal is guarded, the Hiereus then Seals off any Etheric orAstral energy by linking his or her Etheric Body with that of the Banner of the West. When Taylorfirst told me about this he said that it was extremely useful in repelling things, especially in acts ofpossession. He told me that during any evocation, haunting or possession he always wore thebanner of the West in front of him. In order to fully appreciate the significance of what the Hiereusactually does here, he had me stand with the Banner of the West around my neck until I started tofeel and merge with it. To do this correctly takes some considerable time and effort. Heoccasionally used to test me by throwing his energy at the Banner in front of me, and if I repelled itthen he was satisfied that I understood what the Hiereus should feel like. This of course relatesmore to the Inner Order than the Outer, as the energy pattern here is much stronger in both positiveand negative aspects. I would suggest to Temple Chiefs that this method be employed in trainingthe Hiereus. So the Hiereus actually absorbs the energy from the banner of the West with hisEtheric body while his Astral form links solidly to the Water Tablet. This entire concept is not easyand takes weeks to perfect properly and I feel again that it can only be done correctly with someonewho has attained Inner Order rank, is thoroughly familiar with controlling the energies of both theEtheric and Astral in two dimensions at once on an entirely voluntary basis and is able todissassociate\\break the link, at the end of the ceremony. I would also point out that the Astralconnection to Netzach with the first knock is linked on an involuntary basis. The Hiereus thenperforms two functions on the Astral level simultaneously.The Second Adept now gives the command to give the Signs of the Neophyte Grade to theEast, towards the Lighted candle held by the First Adept. In the Neophyte explanation a detailedinstruction was given in showing the energy drawn down and pushed out with fingers and aperturesof the body. It is called sometimes an 'Attacking Sign' for it projects energy at a desired object, inthis instance the Light held by the Chief Adept - to strengthen its link to the ritual. By this actionthe veil is starting to separate slightly. The Chief Adept is doing the Sign of Silence to seal off the934"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"-newly charged energy received so that it is not scattered. It also prevents any negative energyentering into the small opening of the veil that is created by the light. The most important aspecthere is the link forged by the Neophyte Sign with the Light behind the veil. Because the energy that-wants to be received is purified, the force it wishes to connect with recognises this fact and starts toaccommodate it by being drawn towards it like a magnet. All the Temple Officers then repeat theSign of Silence.A speech is then given by the Chief Adept which describes what those on the Temple floorsee when looking towards the dais. The speech of the Second Adept refers to the Dukes of Edom -Lords of the unbalanced forces. This is to instil the concept that, where there is harmony and-balance are the forces of Light and where there is Chaotic disruption there is Darkness. This initiallyrefers to the corruption within the Self and that the negative energy has to be purged from theAdept before any further advancement can be made. Also, to a certain extent, this also refers to theuninitiated, where a lack of Spiritual direction relates to corruption and is, in a sense, a reminder tothose present not to stray from the Path of Light. The Use of the Sign of the Cross with a lightedcandle also further instills in those present that forces of Light can save them from corruption. Herea joining process of All Four Elements is about to begin and the Elements and the Officers guidingthem must be pure and consecrated.The next procedure is the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram. As explained in previousbooks, the Pentagram ritual works primarily through the Etheric and Astral Forces. Unlike theprevious Grade Rituals, the Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram is directed at each of the EnochianTablets. The reason for this is to ensure that when the temple Officer is linked to the tablets Astrally(before the Ritual) that this link is a pure one. Taylor gave us one example where this wasnecessary.`We had a person, who shall remain nameless, who had an affair with the wife of a anothertemple member. As luck would have it they were both down for duties for the Portal ritualand from what I can figure out, both were aware of the affair as the wife ended upconfessing it to the husband. I was acting as Chief Adept at the time and had a devil of a jobtrying to clear the negative energy from the husband. When I did the Banishing Ritual of thePentagram for his Elemental Corner it was like looking at dark wispy smoke coming fromhis aura as he glared at the person he was not happy with. If this was not corrected herethen the person who underwent the ritual would, I feel, have not gotten the benefits of theritual, and possibly would have had an unbalanced system that could have taken a great dealof time to clean up.'The group use of the Kabbalistic Cross occurs here and it is the first time it is done in theGrade rituals together. In his book `Middle Pillar', Regardie makes the following statementconcerning the functions of the Kabbalistic Cross.`The procedure of the Qabalistic Cross is through the cultivation of a species of what iscalled in psychology, the fantasy, of encouraging the imagination to build images throughwhich power of the Id may flow unimpeded... Thus it is that the Qabalistic Cross is the idealmeans of placing the Ego under direct surveillance of the YECHIDAH, the divine will inevery human being. It is an excellent method for rendering the consciousness porous andsusceptible to the dictates of the more responsible and more humanitarian levels of theUnconscious.'-I have quoted this because it is an excellent definition of the Kabbalistic Cross from the point ofview of both the Kabbalist and the Psychologist. It is also a book that should be studied with boththese concepts in mind.For a slightly different comparison I have included part of my own concept of the KabbalisticCross, which was given out as part of discussion on the Middle Pillar exercise one night at a Thoth-Hermes lecture in 1985, and it works from the framework of the Subtle Bodies.`...taking the Kabbalistic Cross as an example of polarity alignment within the subtlebodies. The use of the Cross correctly works directly on the Etheric and Astral\\Emotional435"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Bodies of the Adept. Its initial concept is one of balance - a balance of re-alignment of thesetwo subtle bodies. The Etheric Body is polarised so that any additional invocation comingthrough is unimpeded. The function of the Astral body during this exercise is to merge inthe format or archetype and extend or project this to a desired end. The use of the first word`Atoh`(Thou Art) if directed correctly, then begins to aligning the Crown centre, in theEtheric Body with the Base Chakra, when the word `Malkuth' (the Kingdom) is used Theuse of the words `Ve-Gedulah' (and the Glory) and `Ve-Geburah' (and the Power) seem towork more in the Astral Body and help anchor and align more with the Etheric. I do notplace the use of this meditational preparatory exercise as high as the Yechidah, as Regardiehas done, but more in line with the connection in some way between the Ruach andNephesch...'The overall use of this simply prepares the body and subtle bodies of the Adept to act as a type ofchannel for the forces he or she is about to invoke.At this point the Temple Officers now do the entire four Elemental grade signs in correctorder. To understand why this is done one must first accept that the Unveiled tablets present in thisgrade are placed in the form of a cross over the Altar. In fact the Altar draws the energy of thetablets towards it and all points merge together at this juncture. I will quote Taylor again on this:`I have always seen the energy of the unveiled tablets shoot out towards the altar in theform of an elongated blue light. In the 4=7 ritual this is apparent but is luke warm comparedto that of the Portal. The Grade Signs cement this energy and make the Officers a part ofthe Elemental power which is further bonded by the presence of the tablet of Union.'What is happening here is that the vibration level of the tablets is unified or cemented with that ofthe temple Officers. We must remember that the tablets are, in effect, blind forces that needdirection for the use of the four elemental signs have two primary functions. The first is to link withthe Officers so that their invocation will coincide with that of the power of the tablets; and thesecond is to unify or fuse these four basic levels into one pulsating system.The speech of the Chief Adept refers to the Cross of Corruption. What he in fact is describingis what is happening on the Astral level with the unification of the purified tablets at the Altar. Onyet another level it describes what will happen to the Elemental aspects within the subtle body ofthe candidate. The use of the Key word `Phrath' is extremelyimportant here.PHRATH unites the four Lower Sephiroth of the FirstOrder, With Kaph added it makes the word PAROKETH, in acontinuous succession of Paths ruled by the planets, and leadsto the highest Sephirah symbolised by any Temple Officer in theFirst Order, e.g. Praemonstrator (or Daemonstrator as it wascalled in the Stella Matutina). The word PAROKETH is formedby appealing to the highest source in the First Order and alsothe Highest in the Second Order through the Sephirah ofChesed (also considered or linked to the last of the Four riversof Eden). As a result of this, PAROKETH is the best possibleformula by which to open the Veil between the First andSecond Orders.There is also an equation here with Tetragrammaton ofwhich PAROKETH is but a veiled form. The actual linkbetween the two words is as follows:PHRATH is considered to be the Fourth River of Eden, it isone aspect of Heh Final, receiving the virtue of the other threeletters of the Name. Now when relating the above diagram tothe four letters of the Holy Name YHVH we take the top mostPath of Kaph, relating to Jupiter a Planet of Fire which in turn436"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"relates to YOD. The next Path of Mars is of course related to Fire, but its ruler is Scorpio - a Watersign and as such is related Heh. The Sun is, of course, Resh but in Tiphareth it is Air and as suchrelates to Vau and its Airy disposition. Saturn relates to Earth (though once co-ruler of Aquariusand Air) and to Heh Final. The entire concept of the above associations are inter-changeable and assuch represents the nature of the Pillars and also the Cross and the Pentagram. so that they supply akey to comprehension of the whole ritual .With the Signs of the rendering of the Veil towards the East the Outer door of the Vault, theChief shows the triumph of the Hexagram through the united Elements. The Chief Adept theninforms those present about the word Eth and its dominion over the Four Elements.MacGregor Mathers says of the word Eth or Ath:ATh, means \"the very substance of.\" Qabalistically it signifies \"The beginning and theend.\" and is like the term \"Alpha et Omega\" used in the Apocalypse. For as Alpha et Omegaare respectively the first and last letters of the Greek Alphabet, so are Aleph and Tau for theHebrew. The 'two extreme paths.\" are the crown, Kether and the Kingdom, Malkuth, thefirst and the tenth sephiroth, the highest and the lowest, Macroprosopus, and the Queen...`Mallcuth is Kether after another manner' And this recalls the precept of Hermes in theSmaragdine tablet: \"That which is below is like that which is above, and that which is aboveis like that which is below.\"Taylor always described the first part of the Portal as the 'open and closed door part of theceremony' for while one door shuts in the Outer another opens in the Inner Order.The Chief Adept now comes down to the Temple Floor with the Hegemon standing behindhim, and bearing rose petals. Now this point is very significant for here we have the Chief,representing the link with the Second Order descending into the rectified Four Elements. It not onlyrelates to the Hexagram Pentacle he holds but also to the pentagram above the Cross. The Spiritaspect or highest point of the Tip of the Pentagram has descended into matter to establish the linkwith its mirror image above it. The rose petals held by the Hegemon represents the first stages ofemanation from the Rose (hence the use of petals and not a full rose) of the Second Order. Becausethe Postulant has not entered the Vault the emanation from these petals are now visible since theVeil has been removed. The rose is also a symbol of Air and the petals are then placed in front ofthe Air Tablet (after the Kabbalistic Cross). Such placing of the rose petals is beyond a meregesture to the Air Tablet, for the Postulant is reminded that the Air Grade of the 2=9 resembles thatof entering Tiphareth where he will work through the elements yet again, but on an entirelydifferent level.This whole mechanism has the effect of aligning the lower chakras and establishing a form ofpolarity. While Mathers gave us the geometric symbolism of the Pentagram, Cross and theHexagram over the four elements, all of these show unification of a sort. The alignment of the FourLower chakras is a vital part, of this ceremony. Whether Mathers intended it that way is anyone's-guess, but this in fact does happen, as a result of the ritual when viewed from a clairvoyantperception. I owe this observation primarily to Taylor, who could see the chakras and noted achange in the lower ones when he attended a Portal ceremonyThe next part of the ceremony in which the Chief Adept goes to each Enochian Tablet,invokes and places the Rose leaves, Incense, Cup and Salt on the arms of the Cross. This is whenthe alignment of the Lower chakras takes place, which is also allied to the rectification of the bodyof Osiris to its former glory by Isis. There is also another effect in aligning both the Etheric andAstral bodies. This shows us that the Chakras are aligned in both these subtle bodies.The next few moves and speeches also add to that rectification. When the Chief Adept hangs-the pentacle on a hook he in fact is using his own Etheric and Astral Body (boosted by the power ofthe Order as a group) to bring all of this together. Like the 0=0 ceremony, the effect of therectification of placing the Elemental parts on the altar is taking the Etheric Body of the candidate(before he or she has entered the Hall) and preparing them for the next part of the ceremony to bepresent in the opened Portal (In many respects it is a lot like Radionic therapy where the patient is437"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"worked on without them being present).The Enochian Call given by the Chief Adept is translated as thus:`To reign over you saith the God of Justice. 0 Lexarp, Comanan, Tabitom, move thereforeand show yourselves forth and declare the mysteries of your Creation the balance ofRighteousness and Truth.'This part of the great Tablet of Union Invocation is where an appeal is made directly to the ThreeGreat Angels that Rule this Tablet, which is now visible and on the dais.The Chief Adept, as he does the Call, raises his sceptre and lighted candle. The Sceptre hereis white, like the Tablet of Union and also shows the rectified Elements that demand access to thecurrent of Spirit beyond the veil. The Lighted candle was lit in the realm of the Second Order(behind the Veil) is reflected in the rectified elements of the Hall it shows that the Light will survivein the Chamber, Taylor made this comment on the candle.`The symbol of the lit candle is of course Light descending into darkness. At Whare Rawe were told by Mrs. Felkin to keep an eye on this part of the ceremony for if the candlewent out it usually showed that the candidate was an unsuitable subject. I never took muchstock in this until I was told that a later Chief had the candle blow out at this point in hisPortal ritual and it turned out he was the one who eventually closed Whare Ra down.Perhaps there was something in that after all.'I was told by a late member of Whare Ra that the next invocation is allied to not opening the Veilbut pinning it back so that it does not close prematurely. When the word Paroketh is used in thisInvocation all members suddenly face West as the brightness of the opened Veil shows itself tothem. It is at this point in the ceremony that Power of the Portal is fully opened to the Temple floorOfficers. This is shown by the circumambulation of the Chief Adept who then stabilises the powerthat has been opened.The five knocks are given to or seal off and trap the energy coming through the Portal.The Officers now replace the Elements from the Altar to the Four Quarters so that eachcomponent has been duly rectified. In the Neophyte the Kerux performed this function. Now eachOfficer is in fact a living Etherical part of the PostulantADMISSION OF THE CANDIDATERitual of the Rose Cross & Four ElementsThe Veil that was opened in the previous part is now closed. The energy of the Portal has beentrapped by the Opening ceremony even though the Veil is symbolically closed. The Speech of theSecond Adept ensures that the Postulant is prepared. The 3rd Adept who represents Baptism,Phrath and the Black Pillar, is the one who brings the Postulant into the Temple Hall and it is onlythrough his help that the Postulant can enter. Most of the temple is in darkness as the Postulantgoes into the unknown Region save for the Light in the East, which shows the Light from Tipharethand the Second Order shining through.As the Postulant enters, the Hegemon and Hiereus have crossed their weapons as a type ofbar that prevents the Postulant from entering. At this point Hegmon gives a speech, which to acertain extent actually describes what the Postulant is now seeing which is the void of the Portal.The speech of the Iliereus gives caution.I uncovered the following small uncaptioned paper from Whare Ra which was copied fromone of Taylor's papers after his death. I do not know if he wrote it, as it was never mentioned tome. It is also undated and no name of the author though I feel is worth reproducing here.When the Philosophus enters the Hall in the Portal Ritual, he is barred by the Hiereus andthe Hegemon. Both of these Officers represent the Holy Mountains of Gerizim and Ebal,where the wandering Jews took an oath to the obey the laws of the Torah and theCommandments of Lord God Yehovah. These two mountains guarded the entrance to thepromised land. This is shown in the symbolism of the of the crossed wands, both of whohave their crowns in opposite Pinata of the Tree of Life. It is the Blade of Mein, the Hanged438"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Man that crosses the wand at Chesed, showing both the positive and negative associationsto the conditions on entrance to the valley of Nablus.'The wand and sword are then dropped and the way open is presented.The Second Adept faces East and then invokes the form of Thoth. Now this is very importantfor the Second Adept now using the concept I call 'draining the Archetype'. It occurs when anarchetype is formulated and then power is drawn from it. What is drawn out is the current of Thothand is now directly used in the ceremony. Thoth is the impetus for the bridging gap between theSephirah of Tiphareth and the Portal of it. The energy that comes through is merged with that ofthe Postulant when he or she does the 0=0 Sign. What happens is that the Astral body of thePostulant is then re-adjusted to suit the sudden influx of energy at a quicker pace than what thePostulant has experienced before. The lower centres here are also in line. With the words 'Let therebe Light' this fusion of Astral energy happens. Some people have reported a type of giddiness atthis point and this is put down simply to re-alignment of the subtle bodies and lower centres. Nowin the past, some of these centres or chakras have been worked on in various rituals but not at thislevel. The next gesture of handing the candle to the Second Adept is symbolic of what has justhappened, the reception of the Light of the Second Order. Also the Sign of Silence shows that thereception is complete.When the 3rd Adept takes the Light with Sol (circumambulation) and presents it to thePostulant he is reminded of the Lighted Tower which the candle resembles. At this point he and thecandle are one with each other and represents the impregnation of the Light. The Postulant holdsthe Banner of the West (looped over ones right wrist or forearm) while still holding the candle inthe same hand. When the 3rd Adept touches the black sash of restriction or hardship, thePostulants' Ruach becomes the living symbol of the Light before the darkness (the Banner of Westand sash). The Postulant can see the Light because he holds it in front of him. It is the Light hereceived through the current of Thoth. Now the Third Adept as a symbol of the Living Black Pillarstill has hold of the Postulant. The Black Pillar in this instance is not the Pillar per se but the OuterOrder. Since the Postulant is still held back he cannot advance, as the Banner of the West is in frontof him. The Postulant now holds his future in his hands. Part of him, his right hand holds the lightso he is torn between the darkness that holds him and the Light in front of him. The oath is thentaken.Now what actually happens here is that the Astral Body of the Postulant receives yet anotherenergy charge. It then goes through a re-balancing phase with the Etheric body. The use of thetouch of the Third Adept goes way beyond a mere gesture. The Astral Body of the Third Adeptnow starts to re-adjust the pitch of his Subtle body and magnetically will charge that of thepostulant so that when the oath is taken and the Mental Body is brought into play the Third Adeptwill stabilise this energy pattern. Technically this is not very different to what a Guru would do for astudent in Eastern Yogic practices that I have experienced. It is how the subtle bodies are preparedin Kundaline Yoga, and how the subtle bodies are gently re-aligned to receive the powers of thehigher teachings. When I queried Taylor about this he told me that the Third Adept was always toldby the Hierophant that at the taking of the Oath he was to visualise himself as a Black Pillar andthat it should counter balance the energies of the Postulant. The Oath is always a very importantcomponent to ritual and I have discussed it thoroughly in the Z 5 series. In the Portal however, theOath takes on a slightly different concept to that given in the Outer Order. The Oath here is in theform of relief from suffering, as shown by the symbolic gesture of removing the cross from aroundthe neck of the Postulant. The Oath here has no form of threat but more of idealistic fraternity.Taylor maintained that the Oath in the Portal formed a binding link to the Second Order and thePostulant would be judged by his Higher Self on his action. So in reality, as seen from Taylor'sperspective, which I agree with, the Oath in the Portal is the focal point which aligns not only thelower centres but the higher ones as well. This allows for better communication with that immortalaspect of ourselves, and also helps prepare the subtle bodies for the influx of any additional energycharge. When the Oath is taken here, I have noticed the heart chakra is the one that seems to be439"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"overactive. Apart from clairvoyant observation (which can be faulty at the best of times) I actuallytested the rate of a heart chakra of a Postulant both before and after the ceremony. The rate wasalmost 30 percent higher when she finished the ritual (In this test I allowed for normal deviation).The Postulant is taken to the Earth Tablet and is forced to give the recognition Sign andWords of that grade. This is for three reasons. The first is that when the Postulant approachesMalkuth again he now finds the bonded or rectified elements. As he approaches Malkuth he sees inthe Earth Tablet a synthesis of the Self that is more than the physical. The second is that by callingon the Names of Power he gains strength from them. By this I mean the Etheric Body of thePostulant now undergoes another change and the Etheric body is now brought up to the same levelof the Astral and Mental Bodies. The third is that the Postulant is prepared to absorb the meaningof the diagrams he is about to be shown, which, to a certain extent, explains the reason andmethodology of the earth elements.To understand this part of the ceremony correctly it will be necessary here to refer back to thediagrams and their meanings, which have a multi-layered purpose of their presentation at thisjuncture. However one could say that Malkuth here, represents the Outer Order which thecandidate now transverses through, yet again in Order to see if there is a need to rectify anythingthat was done in the previous grades. Malkuth also has many meanings. Apart from the function ofthe Sephiroth and the Elements it is a symbol of starting up on a new Tree. Taylor put it this way,when I once queried on the repetitive nature of some aspects of the Portal are:`When dealing with Malkuth in the Portal one gets the feeling that there is an overlap ofTrees, like Jacob's ladder. The Malkuth one experiences at One Level is not the Malkuthone has already experienced. What we are seeing is new dimensions in the Tree.'Malkuth is also closely allied to the chaotic or darkened state. By going through that state theunfamiliar is now familiar and one is ready to leave this for the Light. This is implied by the speechof the Second Adept when the Postulant is directed to go to the East. Here a number of diagramsare shown indicating not only what the Postulant can become if he accepts the Light but also whatwill happen if he prefers to remain in mortality of Malkuth.There is also yet another layer to the meaning of the journey from Darkness to. It is theclimbing of the Tree again which is mentioned above. The next two Sephiroth are Hod andNetzach, Fire and Water. When the Postulant comes to each Sephiroth he is also having yet anotheralignment of the auric bodies. Some of you may ask is this all necessary? The auric bodies are like afinely tuned tuning fork and must work in juxtaposition to each other. They are multi-dimensionaland must be altered a number of times in various stages. An alignment of all four bodies at one leveldoes not necessarily mean an overall alignment, for in the ritual there are still more aspects of thetuning process to experience. This is given by the words of the Hiereus who mention that theelements are parts of Osiris Slain. From this speech we are also told that the process is by no meanscomplete for Osiris (The Postulant) has not yet Risen.940"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"RITE OF THE PENTAGRAM AND THE FIVE PATHSThe 13th Key of the Tarot is more than adequately explainedin the ritual. One Golden Dawn adept said of this Key:\"The Golden Dawn version of this Key is very much in thetraditional mode. Here we have the typical archetypal image of the`Grim Reaper'or the figure of Death itself. Overall, this shows theunderlying factor of what we will transform into, after Death. Inmany ways death is a continuation of the journey of the HangedMan. Now that the suffering of the former has given way toenlightenment, the cross over from one boundary to another can beaccomplished.'In many respects this diagram of Typhon is yet anotherversion of the 13th Key Death. Also, in the original diagram Kirchergave it a number of the attributes of Synesius who adapted mental;onfusion, concupiscence, evil speaking and action, levity, angerand inconsistency. These were then associated to the fatalitiesproduced by nature such as storms etc. The Golden Dawn took aslightly different perspective on this though. First of all we mustremember that Typhon was the Slayer of Osiris, as in this instanceis the Postulant through his or her own actions. Taylor and manyothers at Whare Ra referred this to the Kundaline energy whichcould get out of control if misused. The Eleven Sephiroth show, inthis context, two fundamental aspects. The first is that the Tree ofLife, which is mirrored in nature, is subject to the will of theQlippoth. Nature itself is subjected to the joint rule of the Qlippothand its counterparts on the upper Tree. The energy that theTyphon represents is unseen and while it can be equated with theKundaline it can also be equated with the core of the planet itself.You will note that the Sephiroth of Daath is placed in the heart ofTyphon, and around this is the spiral showing that at Daath there isbut a hidden juncture that has not developed correctly, and this isthe Tree of Knowledge which Typhon could not rise above in theall.If the Postulant is found wanting then the Qlippoth will riseand take control of him but if the Postulant is strong then theactions of Typhon will be stopped before he can stop theresurrection of Osiris.The explanation of this trump is also very much in thetraditional mold. The Golden Dawn association with the EgyptianMendes is an interesting one. MacKenzie says of this, in his`Egyptian Myth and Legend\":`The god Mendes was reputed to have made \" the Wind ofLife\" for all men, and was called \"Chief of the Gods\", \"ruler of thesky\", and \"Monarch of all deities\". The earth was made fertile by hisinfluence, and he was the origin of passion or love; he caused thefertilizing Nile flood... he was the pillar of the sky...Mendes the\"great father\" was also a ram god, symbolizing the male principle...\"The diagram of Pan (whose name in Greek means 'All') is yet441"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"another form of the 15th Key of the Devil.

Thisdiagram was always very intriguing to many within the Golden Dawn and Stella Matutina, and Iknow of at least two incidents where statues were copied from it. At Whare Ra, Dion Fortune'snovels, which generally incorporated Pan in some way, were widely read. Some members used thisdiagram to experiment with rituals of their own. I was told by Taylor of one farmer who broughtback a statue of Pan from England and used it in agricultural invocations to the God-form. Pan is anextremely powerful and earthy God-form and is a figure that should be studied with this in mind.Pan is nature in a balanced disposition. Pan also is a counter balance for Typhon who is basicallyDestructive by nature.Hexagram of TipharethThis illustrates the attribution of the parts of theHexagram and their correspondences to the Spheres of theplanets in the Tree of Life. Six project and the Seven is inthe midst, the Place of Holiness and the seventh direction inSpace.Thus Saturn at the top links to Saturn in Daath, asynthesis of the Three Supernals.

Individually these names are the Incorporeal Elements and give a spiritual counterpart to each of the Kings of the Four Elemental Tablets. They are associated with the first EnochianCall.

They, in turn, work with even higher energies.443"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"ternperzaoceThe first Tarot version of Temperance shows this but in a 'restricted meaning'. There has also beenconfusion over these two Keys (personally I prefer the first) but the second was introduced tocoincide more with the ritual. In the first the elements are in a raw state, very much like the 4=7ritual where the last of the Elements has been reached. In the new version the Four Elements arethen 'rectified'. I am in no doubt that the second version of the card was created when the Portalritual was draughted and not before, for it shows the final product of the rectification process. BothKeys are in fact an extremity of each other. The first being the beginning and the second taken tothe extreme within the given framework. In essence the second Key here refers to whole function ofthe Portal grade itself where the first Key is more concerned directly with the Path.444"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"PART TWOFour knocks are given which establishes a fresh current of energy and links the Four Officersbeyond the Veil to this current. This is in the form of a petition for the opening of the Portal onceagain. The Chief Adept behind the Veil acknowledges it by drawing a Pentagram with a lightedcandle. By this action he fuses the elements together with Spirit which helps stabilise the energy_flow from beyond the Veil. This also links directly with the Postulant who waits in the anti-chamber. The Hiereus then does the Kabbalistic Cross before he leaves the Portal to fetch thePostulant.I was always intrigued as to why the Hiereus performed the Kabbalistic Cross here before heor she left the temple floor and thought that it was but a strengthening exercise. Later I found outthat this is in effect only partly true. The Hiereus now, as Malkuth, links him or herself to the GreekCross which lies on the Altar and on which lie symbols of the Four Elements. The actions of theHiereus also have a direct effect on the subtle bodies of the Postulant and when the KabbalisticCross is performed it links all the subtle bodies of the Ego together. When the Lamen of theHiereus is given to the Postulant it is symbolic of his or her reception of the Light. It acts as anattractor of force where the upper centres are galvanised into action. It also has a function to bothprotect the centres and also help hold the high vibration which they are now beginning to attune to.The Postulant then enters and also gives the Kabbalistic Cross which immediately connectshim or her to the Cross of binding on the Altar. He is then led by the Hiereus to the Tau symbol(given in the ritual as the 'Diagram of Malkuth') where it is placed in his hands. Now this is yet-another important aspect of the ceremony (and there are many). When the Postulant receives theTau he symbolically accepts the need to go higher than Malkuth and the Tau is the Path of thejourney towards the Light of Yesod. The actual effect of the Tau is like the figure in the Card 'The-Universe', who balances and aligns her subtle-bodies yet further. It is an acceptance of additionalprotection and stabilisation. The Tau is taken back by the Hiereus (as Malkuth) and the Postulant isthen taken to the Altar where he is confronted by the Hegemon, as the symbol of Yesod. He haswalked the Path of Tau and arrived at his destination. This duality in symbolism is most confusingto some for it is obvious the Postulant has already walked Tau in the 1=10. But as explained earlier,it is the leaving behind of matter that is the important facet.The Hegemon's speech describes the various Paths of the Portal and their Astrologicalassociations. With the words 'This symbol must be established in your Sphere of Sensation` isimportant. The Etheric Body of the Postulant is now charged with the Symbol of the Pentagramwhich is embedded in the Etheric Body. Now usually symbols such as this as placed in the Astralbody but by impregnating the Etheric Body. The effect here is linked directly through the-Pentagram which hangs above the Altar. The Inner action of the Hegemon, as Yesod, a symbol ofAir then activates the Etheric body so that it is attuned to the Air element of Aquarius (to which ithas been introduced before). This is done safely by formulating the Pentagram in the Etheric Body-of the Postulant, which gives him additional balance and strength in this subtle body, for this isneeded as he stands at the base of the White Pillar (Inner Order).The Postulant is led to the Paths of Kaph and is turned back and seeks admittance to the Pathof Nun. Now up to this point the Postulant has been continually taken over the ground of the Pathof Tau in which he has previously traversed in the 1=10 Grade. Tau is a lower equivalent of Nun,for Tau leaves the Earthy Sphere of Malkuth behind and Nun leaves behind the combined FourElements. He is then taken to the 13th Tarot Key of Death. The whole concept is one of renewalwhich the Postulant is about to go through on more than one level. He is then taken to the Figure ofTyphon. Typhon is yet another aspect of the 13th Key when taken to an extremity. It is the Formthat is risen from the previous Key. Here the Postulant must understand fully the negative aspect ofwhat this card will do when he receives the title 'Lord of the Path of Nun'. I have mentioned earlierthe effect of symbols (used in rituals) on the various subtle bodies with the paths and associateddiagrams of the Rituals being excellent cases in point. The two diagrams under discussion work onthe Etheric, Astral and Lower Mental bodies of the Postulant and the centres will also start to spin445"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"at a higher vibrational pitch.The Postulant is then returned to his place at Yesod and is told to approach Hod by the Pathof Resh. This is done to be sure that all avenues of the Black Pillars Paths have been fully explored.He is warned of the dangers of preceding too quickly and is turned back. His next recourse is thePath of Ayin where he is shown the 15th Tarot Key of the Devil. The Postulant is told that this Keyis controlled by the Pentagram of Light above the form of Pan. This also relates to the Postulantwho, having advanced the previous Path, had a Pentagram of Light controlling him. In this thePostulant sees that like the figure in the Key he is also of materialised matter but for the Pentagramin his Sphere of Sensation which creates the necessary balance to receive the energy of the Path ofAyin. The Postulant is then led to the diagram of Pan who was described in part in the previousKey. This version of Pan is the rectified one, the result of the transformation of the previous Key. Itshows harmony and balanced disposition and the Postulant then relates this back to the Self. Moreinstruction is given and the Postulant returns to Yesod.The Inner meaning of the lamen of the Hiereus is then explained. This part shows that thelamen is analogous to the Ruach. It is the Ruach of the Order that is now connected with directly,and briefly.The speech of the Hegemon instils in the Postulant the concept of Breaking through the Veil.Its function is on two levels. The first is to mentally prepare the Postulant for what is about tohappen; that is, his or her reception in Tiphareth. The second function is for the Nephesch to mergewith the Ruach. This is not actually done here but there is a certain amount of polarity balancinggoing on. Polarity balancing is, in effect, not an alignment of the Subtle bodies with each other but aprocess in which each subtle body that forms the Ego, is balanced up to its full level of strength.When this happens, the Ethereal fluid that separates each of the subtle bodies is increased. TheHegemon, with this speech, extends his or her Astral Body to initiate this project. The wand of theHegemon sends a magnetic charge into the Postulant to help with that stabilisation.As the 3rd Adept approaches the Altar and gives his or her speech it has been known at thispoint for the Postulant to actually start seeing sparks of a sort, or flashes of light. I have personallyseen them many times. I noticed that they became more intense at certain parts of the ceremony. Intalking to a number of Adepts from Whare Ra, they assured me that when a ceremony is highlycharged, the Astral Body sees these things. If the ceremony is extremely intense they can be seen bythe naked eye by more than one person. These sparks are what I would call 'helpers' and they seemto fit in with the overall pattern of the ritual itself. They are Elemental forms that are directed byangelic forces to add their support at more dramatic moments of the rituals. They are also, ineffect, partial glimpses which the Postulant will perceive during Astral work.The speech of the Second Adept is yet another preparatory exercise which works directly onthe lower chakras and the polarity of the Subtle Bodies of the Ego. Now we are told about theElements in the aura but this is but a general terminology and I hope to try and explain what thismeans from a technical and esoteric standpoint. The Emotional Body is the one directly affectedhere. The Astral and Emotional bodies are, in fact, twins in some instances and when the Elementsare rectified in the next phase of the ceremony the effect is one where the emotions are brought intoalignment with the rest of the subtle bodies. If the Emotional body is full of anger there will be anover abundance of Fire. Brooding shows an over balance of Water and so on. Here, for the firsttime, the Emotional body is worked on directly so that it can be brought under control and notbecome a type of rogue elephant. This is done in a series of stages up until the Chief Adept isrevealed and the Veil is drawn back. (The Cross of the Four Elements on the altar is held in checkand put together by the Pentagram above it; this stabilizes the subtle bodies.) The diagram of theCross acts as a type of magnet that has to be charged by the cross above.The burning of the emblems (Salt, incense etc) into the brazier is more than a symbolicalshow of self sacrifice but rather it has a very real effect on the Postulant. Now most of you will beaware of the fact that in some forms of magic when the clothing or hair or even nails of one personare burned by another for a magical purpose it can have a magical effect. Radionics has shown this446"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"to be true of hair samples at least and I have seen many times the effect of healing a person if thisenergy is used positively. This is, of course, done with a Radionics machine but in places like Indiathey can produce the same effect without the machine. What I am getting at here is that theemblems have been gradually brought up to a level or vibration that corresponds To the FourSubtle Bodies of the Ego and the four lower centres. When these are burned, it has the effect ofburning away all those negative aspects that hold us back. When the Kundaline energy rises it willburn away the dross that collects in the centres. By going through with this part of the ceremonythat dross is burned away gradually and in a controlled manner so that when, or if, the Kundalinerises it will travel up to the top of the head unobstructed. It is another way of preparing the body.Burning away the obstructions however is not designed to raise the Kundaline but give it theopportunity to travel upwards unimpeded. This will prevent negative hallucinations that sometimesoccur during this event. It is a marvellous piece of ingenuity by Mathers. The use of the InvokingPentagrams here maintain a balance so that the burning will not affect the person physically.Taylor told me of one instance where a new Hierophant did not do the correct Pentagrams-while the emblems were being burned, but after they were all done this error caused many problemsfor not only the Philosophus but also for the Officers who had many emotional physicaldisturbances for up to a month after. One was quite ill and could not go on a planed holiday the-next day for fever. Taylor saw clairvoyantly that in each case there was a rip in the subtle bodiesand then tried to clear each persons subtle body that was damaged.The speech of the Chief Adept, in fact, tells us this in the abstract by the use of the white and-black pillars which now assume another meaning, the channels that rise up the base of the Spine -the Ida and Pingala. The Pentagram of Spirit is done to cement the process and make sure that noimbalance has occurred. The symbol of Eth also has many layers of meaning to it but in this instanceit perfectly shows the binding and aligning of the four subtle bodies that comprise the Ego.The next phase of the ritual, the entire 25th Path, is one of integration, shown by the placingof the tablet of Union on the Altar by the Chief Adept. The Tablet of Union firmly integrates andaligns the elements and as such produces yet another, but final, alignment of the subtle bodies.Taylor described this as like tuning in a radio station and slowly increasing the volume. The Tabletof Union is now brought from behind the Veil to bind the Incorporeal Elements together withSpirit. It is the descent of Spirit into matter. It is at this point in the ceremony where the subtlebodies are hit hardest and bonded together. The balance between the Higher and Lower chakras aremore in harmony. The use of the Tablet of Union here produces an up tempo to the entireceremony. The Tablet of Union now catches the rays of the Four Elemental Tablets and traps themin the central Altar and anything on that altar undergoes a change of magical current. The princes ofthe Tablet of Union bind with the Kings and Holy names of the Elemental Tablets. When you lookdown at the floor pattern you find that clairvoyant sight shows the four arms of a huge cross goingfrom the each Elemental Tablet to the Tablet of Union which forms in a five petal Rose.Now there are two versions of the Tarot keys that are shown here. Both show the straightand balanced path to Tiphareth. As both these Keys are shown the Lower chakras are directlystimulated by Chief Adept. This stimulation is to bring them in line or in tune with the higher ones.The Postulant is then seated in the West of the Altar. When the Chief Adept reveals the trueor Inner meaning of the Hierophant's Lamen the first real link with the Rosicrucian Order is thenestablished. The Chief Adept sends a magnetic charge (which to anyone who is psychic enough willappear as a red ray) to the Heart chakra of the Postulant and its the first stirring of this newvibrational level.The closing ceremony is a reversal of the opening. The same word to open the ceremony isused to close it, along with the various knocks, release of spirits and Banishing Pentagrams. Thewhole process follows a similar pattern to other closing ceremonies.447"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"AN INTRODUCTION TO THE GRADE OF ADEPTUS MINORNearly twenty years ago when I first went through this ceremony I sat down and wrote apaper trying to explain the 5=6 ceremony. I decided to review this paper about ten years ago,prompted by Israel Regardie, and added more to it, and eventually called it the Z 4, a term coinedby Regardie for this document in his 1983 visit to New Zealand. As I sit down now and look atwhat I wrote almost a decade ago, I find that indeed my whole viewpoint has altered greatly on the5=6 and what it stands for.One of the most important aspects of the Adeptus Minor Grade is its association withRosicrucianism, for this is the impetus around which the ceremony was constructed. The origin ofRosicrucian doctrine stems from two manifestos that were published in the early 1600s. Since thepublication's of those manifestos texts by other authors have been published which have greatlyadded to the original texts. I will not try to bore the reader with the history of Rosicrucianism forthere is enough literature published to-date on the historical gleanings of this fraternity to keephistorians happy for more than one life time. With each new text published on the subject we gointo yet further dimensions. Authors such as A.E.Waite have written volumes on the subject whileDame Francis Yates put the whole movement's birth down to John Dee. Paul Case wrote from anesoteric viewpoint in his 'True and Invisible Rosicrucian Order' which is about as far right as onecan get from the Yates concepts.What I think has to be addressed here is how the Rosicrucian fellowship affected the InnerOrder of the Golden Dawn. Going back to the original manifestos there are some very straightforward precepts as to what is expected of a Rosicrucian in both study and in character. His mainphilosophy is the study of Nature and how he exists in it and also how he can manipulate it. In thepast many Adepts have tackled this problem, but approaching Rosicrucianism through Alchemy,directly uses Nature as a guide in understanding how one can manipulate it through variousexperiments. Astrology is yet another area where this philosophy is equally applied. This does notmean that any one who is both an alchemist anchor an Astrologer is automatically a Rosicrucian, butthey are using Rosicrucian tools in the manner in which the manifestos laid down. The same thingcould be said of medicine but the doctrines state that all this must be done in accordance withBiblical leanings (whether this be Old or New Testament is not discussed). There are other sciencesthat one must study as well (including Kabbalism). The most important thing that makes a person aRosicrucian is the concept that he or she is not a rogue elephant but must work in harmony with thevarious tides of energy that we call Nature. He or she must be aware of their own spirituality andhow they fit into the scheme of things. In order to put this all together in one package the essentialconcept is to believe in the idealism of what the Founder of Rosicrucianism stood for. We are notasked to believe literally in the resurrection of the Founder but in the principles he laid down.In modern psychology, Christian Rosenkreutz, the Founder, is a major role model or heroarchetype to identify with. The modern psyche to-day is different from that at the time of themanifestos and things can be looked at in a more clinical light. In psychological jargon, ChristianRosenkreutz - the hero, is to a certain extent an identification with the Higher Self, through imageryof Self Sacrifice. When we identify with this figure we in fact identify with the Libido and, like allheroes, there must be death and rebirth. In short, for many of us mere mortals, the image of whatRosicrucianism represents, is an ideal need for something lacking in the Self. It is part of the growthphase of the individual who, at times, will cling to the myth of the hero and, at other times willreject it, depending on the psychological makeup at the time. The entrance into the Vault istherefore analogous with the entry into the womb where the re-birth can take place.For the Golden Dawn Adept today, I feel the way to look at Rosicrucianism is from theviewpoint of ideology rather than as a fundamentalist belief. However the psychological approach isvery neat, but lacks a spiritual sense, a very vital component of which esoteric thinking has a need.However, times are changing fast, as Dr. Stanislav Groph says (on the holographic phenomena in448"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"the 'Adventure of self-Discovery')The new data are of such far-reaching relevance that they could revolutionize ourunderstanding of the human psyche, of psychopathology, and of the therapeutic process.Some of the observations transcend in their significance the framework of psychology andpsychiatry and represents a serious challenge to the current Newtonian-Cartesian paradigmof Western science. They could change drastically our image of human nature, of cultureand history, and of reality.What the holographic theory is trying to say is that firm belief in some type of archetypal ormetaphysical concept can turn into reality, given enough time and impetus. A belief in a system ofesoteric thinking such as Rosicrucianism can in fact become a total reality. This reality has its stepsand pitfalls like anything else, but it must be studied carefully so that in each step along the way allthe correct safeguards are incorporated, or the liberated thinking of Rosicrucianism can indeedbecome a trap - if the process is locked in and not subject to change, to allow for a growth factor.Any Adept worthy of the name who goes into the Second Order must face this fact.I have mentioned all this because when doing an analysis of the 5-6 ritual, and later into otherrelated areas, all this must be taken into consideration to assist reader's own private researches,which I hope will branch beyond mere psychological frameworks.Rosicrucianism to-day is a changing reality, and is a very flexible power base from which towork. Within the 5=6 Ritual it is only part of the power base. The other two being Egyptian andChristian. Mailers took from the Christian component, the most noble and powerful essence of all,-`self sacrifice'. By emulating Christ one manages to tap into this current as one does when oneemulates Osiris and Christian Rosenkreutz. All three constitute the main theme, and all three areself resurrecting.There were three main underlying factors of training in the Outer Order, and which of coursewere a preparation for the training of the Inner.The first principle is the participation in group ritual, by taking various roles as teMple officersover a periods of time This went far more than mere textbook ritual for it allowed the postulant tosee and feel the currents of ritual at a group level. This also protected him or her from themselvesand any mishaps; as the built in safeguards of the grade rituals took care of this. A great deal ofwhat the postulant learnt, felt and saw was subliminal. This of course would manifest and becomeknown on a conscious level as the knowledge lectures and Flying Rolls were read, or when certain-facts were drawn to the attention of the Postulant by the tutor.The second principle was the concept of spoon feeding information. By this the postulantwould not be dabbling in forms of magic, such as scrying or Astral projection, until they were-shown how in the Order fashion, with all the safeguards. Unfortunately today this precept is notpossible due to the vast amount of literature available the subject, and with most people who jointhe Order being well advanced into varying aspects of its Inner Order teachings. To a certain extent-I am as guilty as the next author in this area as I have certainly done my fair share of revealing InnerOrder teachings in the Z 5 series. I would point out though that I personally feel that this concept itnot a necessary one. One can still have a structured programme that enables people to work at theirown pace.The third principle is the framework of the Order itself, and a great deal of this has beendiscussed in previous paragraphs on the Order's ideology. A better word for this is control. It is apoint where senior members controlled the lower ones. This worked for a while but judging fromwhat I saw of this from Whare Ra members, it is something that we can well do without. Personalprejudices were passed on from one generation to the next without the right to question. In somecases this personal touch was quite valid in guiding a student through problems but the reality ofthis really did not work, at Whare Ra or at any other temple. I take the personal viewpoint that-students should read what they want, additional to the grade study curriculum, and if they havequestions then they should them. This is the way it operates at our Thoth-Hermes Temple. Afoundation is built for the initiate through grade structure and study, but the individual is not449"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"limited.When the Adeptus Minor Grade is entered the student is swamped with a vast amount ofpractical and theoretical. We must also remember that the Adeptus Minor had five sub-grades:Zelator Adeptus MinorTheoricus Adeptus MinorPracticus Adeptus MinorPhilosophus Adeptus MinorAdept Adeptus MinorEach of these levels had its own study procedure. Unfortunately only the Theoricus AdeptusMinor Grade was reached before the schism in the Golden Dawn (in 1900) though some of thepapers for the Practicus Adeptus Minor went to the Stella Matutina. The papers for the Other twolevels remained with the Mathers Alpha et Omega temples. However Carnegie Dickson did pass onsome of those papers, as did Brodie Lines, to Whare Ra and Bristol, though these were keptextremely secret.For the purposes of this book I will deal with the papers from the first level of the 5=6 Gradeof Zelator Adeptus. I would point out that while I have listed Official documents, up to around 60(according to Mrs. Felkin in a conversation with Jack Taylor) other documents that were circulatedat this level of the 5=6. Though they were never recorded as 'official' they were nevertheless readjust as much as the 'official' documents were. For the most part many of these papers were copiesof manuscripts from the British Museum, many of which have now been published. I have only beenable to trace 20 titles of these manuscripts. It would be fair to say that these additional papers gavegreater insights into various subjects studied. In alchemy you had the manuscripts 'Homer's GoldenChain', 'Splendor Solis', `Rosicrucian Secrets' and numerous texts that are included in the`Hermetic Museum'. Other texts include the complete works of Paracelsus and a 'Lexicon ofAlchemy by Martin Rutland' (to name but a few). All of these are now published. When all this isadded to the 'Official' list then a different perspective arises of the study procedure for the firstlevel of the 5=6 Grade. Many of the Rosicrucian documents, including the Tama', `Confessio' andthe Thymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz' were all read vigorously as well. A number ofauthors maintained that to leave out the alchemical manuscripts in any official capacity greatlyimbalanced an Adepts knowledge. From the above list one will observe that there were more thanenough alchemical manuscripts to go around, unfortunately many of them could not be understood,hence the reason for leaving them out. Also with Waite's publication of many of them (These wereactually given to Waite to publish and all he did was add a few footnotes) in the early 1890's.Mathers possibly felt that it would be useless to give out published books as knowledge lectures forthe Inner Order.List of Order Documents for the Zelator Adeptus Minor Grade.A.General Orders - The Curriculum of Work prescribed.B.Rituals of the Pentagram.i.Lesser.ii.

Chief Adept: The Chief Adept fulfils two basic functions of representation in the 5=6 ritual. The first, is ofcourse, the part of Christian Rosenkreutz, the founder of the Order but on another level he is Osirisand one will find that through the ritual both of these levels are intermixed. At first there is nodoubt some confusion here but we must accept that the overlapping function of the Chief Adeptworks on two distinct levels, one on the Etheric Plane and the other on the Astral\\Emotional plane.When the postulant goes through this ritual both of these levels are worked at. By this I do notsimply mean the subtle bodies but the chakras on each level as well.Most people think there is but one set of seven chakras on the Etheric Level but in fact eachsubtle body (bar the top three) has seven and the Chief Adept must regulate the energy flow backand forth between these levels. Now apart from the Rosicrucian and Egyptian theme the Christianone is also incorporated, and this is shared with the Egyptian symbolism on the Astral level. In factthe Christian concepts are worked directly from the Emotional Body, the close twin of the Astral.Technically there are three level but two work out from almost the same dimension. The ChiefAdept differs here in association from that described in the Portal, for there he became one of thefollowers of Christian Rosenkreutz and now he has ascended to being the Founder of the Order.Nemyss and Cloak of Chief Adept: The nemyss and cloak are in the same colour schemes both being blue with purple stripes in thecase of the nemyss, and blue with a purple lining and trims in the case of the cloak. Now thefunction of the Nemyss does not change from that of the Hierophant in the Outer Order. It is thereas a protection device to pacify the energy of the etheric body and prevent the chakras from lettingthe kundaline energy rise, for this is not the purpose of this ritual. The Colour of Purple comes fromChesed in the King Scale and the Blue is taken from Chesed in the Queen Scale. The reason for thisduplicity is that two main levels are worked in unison, hence another reason why I have opted forthe subtle bodies descriptions. Now in the nemyss the Blue and Purple are striped and hold an equalbalance of colour. This is because the top chakras, equal to the Kabbalistic Supernal, lies above theearthly abyss of death and is in communion with the Third Order. Here the Second and ThirdOrders work together at higher levels. The purple being representative of the energy and power ofthe Third Order. When the cloak is worn it is blue outside and purple underneath and this showsthat the Second Order hides the Third, as the First hid the second, and this is showing the innerlining to be the power of the Third Order. In Kabbalistic terms, at varying points of the ritual, theRuach and Neschamah unite which form an alignment of sorts, hence the symbology of the twovariations of colour.452"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"The purpose of the Blue\\Purple cloak is also symbolic of the two different concepts ofChesed relating to the Letters Yod Heh, the two Hebrew letters associated to the King and QueenScale which relates to the Fire beneath the Waters of Chesed, the alchemical action of thetransmutation process of the Chief Adept. The manuscript 'Homers Golden Chain', tells us:`Thus the Universal Fire became a vapour of immense extent, which by further Inspissationbecame Chaotic Water, and out of this Chaotic Water the Creator Separated the Light, thatis: Separated the Universal invisible Fire into Light...'Rose CrossThe Rose Cross is a complete synthesis of the Masculine,Positive or Rainbow Scale of Colour attributions, which is alsocalled the 'Scale of the King'. The four ends of the Cross belongto the Four Elements, and are coloured accordingly. The WhitePortion belongs to the Holy Spirit and the Planets. The twenty-two petals of the Rose refer to the twenty-two Paths. It is theCross in Tiphareth, the receptacle and the centre of the Forcesof the Sephiroth and the Paths. The extreme centre of the Roseis white, the reflected spiritual brightness of Kether, bearingupon the Red Rose of Five petals and the Golden Cross of sixsquares; four green rays issuant around the angles of the Cross,from which the Second Order takes its name. They are thesymbols of the receiving Force.Upon the White portion of the Symbol, below the Rose, isplaced the Hexagram, with the Planets in the order which is theKey of the Supreme Ritual of the Hexagram.Around the pentagrams, which are placed one upon eachElemental coloured arm, are drawn the symbols of the Spirit and the Four Elements, in the orderwhich is the key to the Supreme Ritual of the Pentagram. Upon each of the floriated ends of theCross are arranged the Three Alchemical principles, but in a different order for each element, and asshowing their occupation therein.The upmost Arm of the Cross, allotted to Air, is the yellow colour of Tiphareth. In it theflowing Philosophical Mercurial nature is chief and without hindrance to its mobility; hence the evermoving nature of Air. Its Sulphureous side is drawn from the part of Fire, whence its luminous andelectrical qualities. Its Saline side in from the Water, whence results clouds and rain from the actionof the Solar Forces.The lowest arm of the Cross, allotted to Earth, is of the four colours of Mallcuth, the Earthbeing of the nature of a container and receiver of the other influences. The Citrine answers to itsAiry part, the Olive to the Watery, the Russet to the Fire, and the black to the lowest part, Earth.Here also is the Mercurial part chief, but hindered by the compound nature whence its facultybecomes germinative rather than mobile, while the Sulphur and Salt are respectively from the sidesof water and Fire, which almost neutralize their natural operation and bring about the fixedness andimmobility of Earth.The extremity allotted to Fire is of the scarlet colour of Geburah, and in it the Sulphurisnature is chief, whence its powers of Heat and Burning. The Salt is from the side of Earth, hencethe necessity for a constant substantial pabulum whereon to act, and the Mercury is from the side ofAir, hence the leaping, lambent motion of flame, especially when acted upon the wind.The extremity allotted to Water is of the Blue colour of Chesed, and in it the saline side ischief, as exemplified in the salt water of the ocean, to which all waters go; and from hence also isderived the nature of always preserving the horizontal line. The Mercurial part is from Earth, hencethe weight and force of its flux and reflux. Its Sulphuric part is from the Air, hence the effect of thewaves and storms. So that the disposition of these Three Principles forms the Key of their Alchemicoperation in the Elements.453"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The White rays issuing from behind the Rose at the inner angles between the arms, are theRays of the Divine Light issuing and corruscating from the Reflected Light of Kether in its centre;and the letters and symbols on them refer to the analysis of the Key Word of the Adeptus Minor, I.N.R.I. by which the opening of the Vault is accomplished.The Twelve letters of the Twelve petals follow the Order of the Signs of the Zodiac.Uppermost is Heh, the letter of Aries, followed by Vau, followed by Zayin, Cheth, Teth, Yod, whilethe letter of Libra, which is Lamed is lowermost. Ascending are Nun, Samech, Ayin, Tzaddi, Qoph.The Seven Double Letters of the middle. Row are allotted to the Planets in the order of theirExaltations, the planets being wanderers; the Stars are fixed with respect to Earth. These letters arePeh, Resh, Beth, with Daleth exactly over Libra, followed by Gimel, Kaph and Tau. The ThreeMother letters are allotted to the Elements and are so arranged that the petal of Air should bebeneath the Arm of the Cross allotted to Air, while those of Fire and Water are on counter-changedsides, so that the forces of the Arms of the Cross should not too much over-ride the Planetary andZodiacal Forces in the Rose, which might otherwise be the case were the petal of Fire placed on thesame side of the Arm of Fire and that of Water on the side of Water.The back of the Cross bears the inscription in Latin: 'The master Jesus Christ, God and Man.'between four Maltese Crosses which represent the Four Pyramids of the Elements opened out. Thisis placed in the upmost part because therein is affirmed a Descent of the Divine Force intoTiphareth, which is the central point between Supernals and Inferiors. But on the lowest part iswritten the motto of the Zelator Adeptus Minor, because therein is the affirmation of the elevationof human into the Divine. But this is impossible without the assistance of the Divine Spirit fromKether, hence the space above Malkuth is white upon the front aspect of the Cross, white being theSymbol of the Spiritual rescued from the Material.In the centre is written in Latin between the Symbols of the Alchemical principles, of whichthe outermost is Sulphur, the purgatorial Fire of Suffering and Self sacrifice, 'Blessed be the Lordour God who have given us the Symbol Signum.' And this is a word of six letters, thus representingthe six creative periods in the Universe and the Regimen of the Planets ere the glory of the Sun canbe obtained.Wand of the Chief AdeptThe Wand of the Chief Adept, like the Rose Cross has many different layers to its symbolism.The shaft of the Wand itself is divided into the four Elemental colours and Spirit. Starting from thebottom is Black, Blue, Yellow, Red and White and these representthe forces applied to a variation on the Holy Name of YHVH,which is YVHH. This permutation of the Holy name in fact relatesto the Sign of Gemini, in which Mercury is exalted, and is theessence of the Caduceus of Hermes, which is what the outerframework of this Wand represents. Entwined upon this shaft arethe invisible serpents, and at every point of Crossing an element isformed.

The first crossing of the Serpents is in Malkuth, representing theElement of Earth and shown by the colour Black, which alsorepresents the World of Assiah - for within this colour and the onesabove it, are a total of Four Trees. This also represents the Tenth Path or Sphere of 'ResplendentIntelligence' and it is so called because it is exalted above every head, and sits on the Throne of454"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Binah, and it illuminates the Splendour of all Lights, and causes the current of influence to flowfrom Metatron. This of course relates to Binah being the first point of separation and the firmestablishment of the feminine polarity, which in turn relates to the Mother concept of the EarthElement. This shows the first stirring of new Life being formed on an entirely different level -henceits association to Heh Final - the fully developed Tree.2. The Second Crossing of the serpents relates to the Sephirah of Yesod, but not in its associationof Air but to Water, hence the colour Blue. This is called the Path or Sphere of 'Pure Intelligence'because it purifies emanations. It proves and corrects the designing of their representations, anddisposes of the unity with which they are designed without diminution or division. This relates tothe energy flow from Tiphareth bring refined from Kether by Tiphareth, and in conjunction with thedual forces of Hod and Netzach, by producing in Yesod a compatible Vehicle from both polaritiesof the Tree -just before the birth state into Malkuth. These are of course in conjunction with theLunar tides that bathe the earth, Mallcuth, producing, in accord with their watery influence, strongemotional tides that effect us all.-3. The Third Crossing of the Serpents is in Tiphareth which is shown by the Golden Solar colourwhich is representative to the Element of Air. This relates to the sixth Path or Sphere and is called`Mediating Intelligence' because in it are multiplied the influxes of the emanations; for it causes the-influence to flow into all the reservoirs of the blessings with which they themselves are united. Thisrefers to the central position of Tiphareth on the Tree in a balanced disposition, not only from thetwo polarities but of the energy forces moving both down and up the Tree. For the Chief Adept this-is the main point or grip position during this ritual (though this can change from time to time) for itis the most obliging force to wield that will offer the least resistance.4.The Fourth Crossing of the Serpents is in the Shadow Sephiroth of Daath. This is the pointwhere both the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life are joined equally. In the Zohar, from the`Book of Lesser Holy Assembly' we are told 'The Masculine Power is extended through Daath;and the assemblies and Conclaves are filled.' This of course relates to the higher emanationsfiltering down the Tree. In this instance The Red relates to Yod, the Masculine force from which allthings come, the initial impetus.5.The White uppermost point is the bridging gap between worlds since white is the colour thatencloses all other colours. It is in fact, in a sense, an extension of the Sephirah of Daath, for it is theseparating cloud of the Supernal from the Lower part of the Tree. We are told in the Explanation of`The Garden of Eden after the Fall' that the heads of the Dragon rose into the seven lowerSephiroth and even unto the feet of Aima Elohim (roughly an equivalent of the Sephirah Binah).6. And from that point the Serpent of Wisdom (as opposed to the Serpent of Evil) extended herselfinto two halves to help balance the Tree and maintain the Abyss or Gulf between the SUpernal andthe rest of the Tree. Each serpent has the conical crown of the South and the North (shown by redand White) of the Egyptian mystery schools. This is also symbolic to show that the power of the-wand is sanctified by those Gods above -according to Egyptian tradition. The Uraeus symbols werealso related to divinity and the office of High Priest as well as Priest-King and, as such, the Wand ofthe Chief Adept shows an aspect of his Office. On each serpent there are three double marks,-making a total of six on each side. These are analogous to a snakes scales, and relate to the pointsbetween the Equinox and show the changing nature of the Earth's cycles around the Sun. This,again, is analogous to the Serpents around the central Shaft of the Wand. The duality here is that-both forces of Light and darkness are held in abeyance neither one winning or losing.7. Above the symbol of the twin serpents is that of the Winged Red Sphere or Disk. Now each wingis a mirror image of the other. The key number, or the permutations is 120, the number of yearsChristian Rosenkreutz (and the number of the Sephiroth multiplied by the Zodiac) said after whichthe Vault would open. Directly above the central shaft are 15 black feathers, which when dividedinto 120 is 8, the number of Hod and Thoth, the weilder of the Wand who is associated with thePlanet Mercury. There are a total of 17 feathers on side of the Disk (7 + 1 reduces to 8). If youplace the circular Disk over the 64 squared Kamea of Mercury, you in effect square the circle.

Here theblueprint of the 10 Sephiroth, and 22 Paths, are given in their seed form, or embryonic state.There are a total of 24 dots (8 Red, Blue and Black) on each side of the wing which in turnrelates to the number of hours in a day an Thrones of the Elders in the Apocalypse. This is obtainedby dividing 120 by 5 (the four elements and spirit -the 5 colours on the shaft of the Wand of theChief Adept). The 120 divided by the 10 Sephiroth comes to 12, which stands for HUA, the symbolof our Higher Genius which the Chief Adept holds above the heads of the Adepti.The relationship to the book Sepher Yetzirah' is also very important, and in my copy of MissFelkin's 5=6 ritual it relates the three main colours of the shaft of the Wand to the Three Motherletters which in turn generates the Three Primary colours. I have left this to last because this wasmore the official explanation (and the easiest to explain) of the colours of the shaft of the Wand.Double Phoenix or Ureaus Lamen.There are in fact two versions of the doublePhoenix collars. The first is the Golden Dawnversion, and Westcott's own collar was more like aRoman breast plate in size. This in turn, was basedon the print of one shown in the original German' edition of 'Secrets Symbols of the Rosicrucians'.For the Golden Dawn version, Westcott retained'the eagles and stars (with the four Egyptian godforms around each star) and changed the centralmedallion to fit in with Golden Dawn philosophyand Egyptian symbolism. The central medallion wasalso used as the model for the Seal of the R.R et A.C. Westcott changed the central figure of theChrist-like King of the original, in the centre of thehexagram, to that of Osiris with the crook andscrouge. This is the symbol of Osiris risen in the5=6 ceremony. The two kerubs angels on each sideof Osiris are another reminder of the two angels thatguarded the tomb of Christ after the resurrection.The background colouring of the hexagram showsblack on the bottom and gold on top symbolising theinitiation of through Malkuth into the gold ofTipareth. The background colouring of the starsrelate to the old Rosicrucian alchemical tincture ofthe white and red, as stipulated in the originalGerman design. Westcott also changed the positionsof the sun and lunar symbols from the originalplacing to match the pillars of the Tree of Life. TheSun being the left hand pillar and the Moon being onthe right. Around each star or pentagram, is anEgyptian Pantheon or figures. On the right are Godforms on the dais of the earth grade (minus Hon's)and on the left are the figures on the dais from theFire Grade (plus Horus who was transferred).In the second version, used by the StellaMatutina, the central medallion was not used infavour of the twin eagles and stars above the RoseCross and the omission of the Egyptian pantheonsagainst each star...r. 10 e, OWti456"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"The collar overall, in its original Rosicrucian, Golden Dawn and Stella Matutina eras, doesshow two main levels. The first is the practical aspect of the alchemical tincture with the centralfigure being symbolic of the Philosophers Stone, which symbolises the transmuting of the loweranimal into the higher divine aspect of the self, shown by the King (Osiris). The two backgroundcolouring shows the Stone coming forth through the Black state of the Nigredo  the lower, to thegold of the higher. This symbology covers the physical or practical which is the utilisation of themineral Antinomy as the Primea materia into gold. The mystical is transmutation of the lowernature into the divine which sets off the third layer of controlling the unconscious nature bybringing the hidden nature of the unconscious into the conscious. This in turn brings about therealisation of self which is considered the magical. The archetypes figures of the angels and king-like figure show a discovery of the 'Essence' through the higher spiritual plane using the principleof the spiritual rebirth.The complete symbology of this collar alone is extremely intricate and usually reserved for the 7=4Grade where the general symbology of the 5=6 Grade is explainedThe AnkhThe Ankh is generally worn loosely at the wrist andis only gripped at certain points in the ritual. Itsconstruction is of wood or metal and its function inritual is multi-layered. Its main point of effort is forthe Adept to hold it by the Kether band at the Topand direct the bottom or Malkuth End of the Cross ateither a person or thing. It is a stabilising agent thatholds not only etheric but Astral energy firm, whilethe other hand usually utilises the Wand for a setpurpose (I will explain these later.P.Z.). The Ankhitself is in the Colours of the Sephiroth of the QueenScale. The upper loop represents the Sephiroth aboveTiphareth, showing the power of the Second Orderwhile the lower cross forms the energy of the LowerSephiroth that are attached to the Outer OrderGrades. It was considered not only a stabiliser forany additional etheric energy but also for the Adept to direct his or her energy to revitalise anetheric unit. Its function in rituals of Talismanic and Evocation as well as Alchemical ritual hasnever been fully explained before (and will be in my book on the Z 2 series). Taylor oncedemonstrated the power of his ankh one afternoon and simply raised it and directed it at me (when Ihad my nose in a book and was unprepared for what was about to happen) I suddenly felt extremelyheavy, the book I was reading dropped to the floor and I then looked at Taylor who told me since Iwanted to find out more about the ankh that this was best demonstration possible. He then changedhis grip position and I went back to normal again. He told me that on more than one occasion heand others had seen an Ectoplasmic energy (shown as a blue writhing light) leave the Ankh and gOto a desired object. The ankh actually amplified the wearer's capabilites - much like some crystals inthis area. Though he pointed out it still depended on the abilities of the wielder and not the Ankh. Ihave Taylor's ankh in my possession and could never (at the time of writing) duplicate what Taylorcould do with it.Second Adept: Nemyss and Cloak. The nemyss of the Second Adept is a combination of Red and orange stripes. These of course relateto the Sephiroth of Geburah in both the King and Queen Scales. Like the nemyss of the Chief Adeptit relates to the Supemals of the Tree of Life. The Cloak is Red on the outside and Orange on theinside which shows the Third Order hidden beneath the Second.957"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Wand of the Second AdeptThe shaft of the Wand of the Second Adept is in the colours of the orderof the rainbow or prismatic scale of colours. The top is white as is the Phoenixhead, as, again, is the white band beneath it which is almost the length of twocolours from the prismatic scale The Phoenix head refers to the symbol of bothrebirth and knowledge (in its form of the Bennu bird) this rebirth is through theSephiroth of Daath where the White Rays of Kether stream through. It is theemergence of both Knowledge and Life in a united form. The colourcombinations relates to the Double letters of the `Sepher Yetzirah' and aretaken from the Paths of the King Scale.ColourPlanetRedMarsOrangeSunYellowMercuryGreenVenusBlueMoonIndigoSaturnEach colour also represents one of the Seven Rays of influence which brings itin tune with the walls of the Vault itself and this is where its power base comesfrom.-The base of the wand is black, slightly longer than the rainbow colours. Thiswand is about thirty-six inches in length and is slightly longer than any of the other wands.It is also important that the face of the Phoenix Wand must be held outwards during theceremony. In some respects, the Wand of the Second Adept is more important than that of theChief Adept. This is the Wand that is used to bring new life and regeneration to the Second Orderthrough the process of initiation. On the base of the wand, are two prongs'which are magnetised - one to reverse polarity. It is from this that the energy ofthis wand can be generated at almost ten times the power of other similarwands. The wand itself is a type of super conductor during ritual. Because itshead is centered in Daath, it is the sphere where the two heads of the Serpentmeet. Like the Wand of the Chief Adept, the grip positions change a great dealin the ritual - something which will be discussed later.Third Adept: Nemyss and CloakThe nemyss of the Third Adept is Rose Pink and yellow stripped. This, like theprevious nemyss's discussed so far in this ritual comes from the combination ofcolours from Tiphareth from the King and Queens Scale. The Robe is Yellowon top with a Rose Pink lining, to symbolise the Third Order working throughthe influence of the Second.Wand of the Third AdeptThis is, in fact, an identical Lotus wand that the Adept first consecrates whenthe elemental weapons are constructed. This one however is not consecrated byany one person.The Lotus Wand has an upper end White, the lower Black. Between theends are the twelve colours of the Zodiac Signs, whose colours are taken fromthe Paths of the King Scale. At the upper end of the White is fixed a lotusflower in three whorls of twenty-six Petals: the outer eight, the middle eight,and the innermost ten. The calyx has four lobes or sepals of orange colour. Theflower centre is orange or gold. The lotus wand should be twenty-four to fortyinches long and the wood about half an inch thick.

( refer to colour plates for diagram)The Outer Rim is divided into five portions of colour -all of equal proportion, going anti-clockwisefrom the bottom; Red, Blue, White, Yellow and the mixed Colours of Malkuth. Starting at the redportion one will find that each colour relates to the Hebrew name of YHShVH. The introduction tothe letter Shin, which has a value of 300, is equivalent to the words RUCh ALHIM (Ruach Elohim)which is the Divine Spirit of the living 'God Elohim. Each of these colours also relate to theSephiroth:White KetherBlue ChesedRed GeburahYellow TipharethMixed MalkuthThese are not only the Sephiroth of the Kabbalistic Cross, but they are also the Sephiroth that areapplied to the Partsufim Theory (Arikh Anpin and Zaur Anpin - the vast and lesser Countenances).The upper tip of the Hexagram forms a five pointed cross, above which the Hebrew letters AHIEI(Each letter takes up the space between points). Of these letters in connection with the PartsufirnTheory Mathers says:`The one is ARCH, Eheieh; the other is the V, Vau, of the Tetragrammaton. The first twoletters, I and H, Yod and Heh, are the father and mother of the Microprosopus, and the Hfinal is the bride. But in these forms is expressed the equilibrium of severity and mercy;severity being symbolised by the two H's, has, the mother and the Bride, but especially thelatter. But rather conveys a certain idea of weakness and want of force, too great an excessof weakness and want of force, too great an excess of severity calls forth the executioner ofjudgement, the evil and oppressive force...'This is further demonstrated by the two Crowned faces (both masculine and feminine) next to theKether portion of the circle, The Stella Matutina taught that, the masculine figure on the right is the- ABBA - the Supernal Father, shown by the four pointed Golden Crown. The figure on the left is459"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"the Aima -the Supernal Mother, who wears a four pointed Silver Crown. The Four points eachallude to the Holy Name YHVH.

The \"Prince ofCountenances\" or of the \"Faces\" whose office it is to bring others before the Face of God.In the Rosicrucian Seal at the foot of the 5=6 Obligation supports the extended left Arm ofthe Crowned figure standing upon the earth.

In theRosicrucian Seal, at the foot of the 5=6 Obligation supports the Right Arm of the Crownedfigure standing upon the Earth...Associated in Egyptian symbolism with the Great Goddessof the \"Via Lactea\", also with the Hermetic Cross.'The central androgynous figure stands in the position of the Sign of the 5=6 Grade, and relates tothe balanced disposition of the Equinox, when all forces are equal. This figure is also analagouswith the Flaming Sword as given in the 1=10 ritual.The Ten Sephiroth are then written both beside and on the body of the Christ like figure, theSephirah Daath being represented by a cross in a circle on the throat of the figure. The hands abovethe top cross bar of the Hexagram show blood dripping from them which form the letters R.C.. Thisblood is also the Red Glory or the Agnus Dei- 'the Lamb of God that destroyeth the sins of theworld'. You will note that Red is also transposed for Yellow in the Tiphareth centre. Apart fromsacrifice it also relates to the first alchemical principle 'The Red powder cast upon the watersproduceth the Golden Sol' which shows the inverted aspect of a new arc that rises from theTiphareth centre as the Adept starts a renewed life. You will note that the downward pointingtriangle has the Three Alchemical essences of Sulphur, Salt and Mercury, so vital to Creation, withred centre situated perfectly balanced between the Sulphur and Mercury.The Hexagram has in -fact six paths associated to it which relate to the first six days ofCreation. We are told that:`And the Chaos cried out the unity of Form and the Face of the Eternal arose... That theBrow and those eyes formed the upward triangle of the measureless heavens: and theirreflection formed the downward pointing triangle of the measureless waters. And thus wascreated one Eternal hexad: and this is the number of the dawning Creation.'You will note a differentiation here from the Christian concept in which the Son is the first. Thissymbol shows the Father and the Mother creating the Son through the process of evolvement andthe reincarnation process, all of this is shown by the Partsufim theory. The Black colouring withinthe Hexagram is in the form of an upward pointing triangle. The Blackness is the Chaos of theElements. It also represents the Mystical Mountain of the Grades. Where the black stops, at thepoint of Tiphareth, the Bow of Quesheth starts. It is the point of Eth, where man and spirit evolveas one. The Sun and the Moon symbols, within the two lower points of the Hexagram represent themasculine and feminine energies of the Pillars.Within the Hexagram are written the Names of the Great Angels of the Tree of Life -Metatron and Sandalphon. These are the angels who control the Macroprosopus and theMicroprosopus. On the lowest tip of the Hexagram is the representation of Malkuth or the Worldwe live in. On the forearms, Chest and feet of the figure are the letters YHVH and their elementalassociations.Admission Badge (refer to colour plates for diagram The Sword here is the Sword of Cheribum which guarded the Gates of Eden. It's powercomes YHVH and starts in Kether and gradually descends through the Sephiroth (shown by itsmulti-colours) until it reaches Malkuth., This Sword is intractable and immoveable.

The entire concept of thisone symbol is in fact a synthesis of previous symbols shown to the Postulant in the Outer Order.Also it shows the Souls journey back up the Tree (through the Framework of Initiation) and eachsegment of the Soul relates to its component parts in the upward ascent. Mathers summed this allup when he says:`After the First Grade comes the 1=10, where we find the first form of the Sephiroth inthe Tree of Life -this is the representation of the Flaming Sword Descending, but it is notuntil the 2=9 comes that we begin to find the Actual symbol of self sacrifice. The 2=9 Altardiagram, then, represents the Serpent of Wisdom twined through the Paths. In the 4=7Grade, however, you are shown the same Serpent, its representation being that of theSerpent Nechushtan. This was the Serpent of Brass that Moses made in the Wilderness, andwhich was turned around the central Pillar of Mildness; having three cross bars upon it;representing a species of Triple Cross.Dealing now with the altar diagram of the 3=8 Grade, it will be seen that Adam is theTiphareth part; wherein he is extended. That is to say that the form of the man is projectedfrom there. The figure of Eve stands in Malkuth in the form of the Supporter. The first idealform of the Man is in Adam Kadmon, behind the Kether form and, as it were, the prototypeof the Tiphareth form. This Tiphareth answers to the letter Vau of the Holy Name, asrepresenting the Prince. The letter Vau also represents the number six and Adam wascreated on the Sixth day, for Tiphareth is the symbol of Creation. Furthermore, thehexagram consists of two forms, Fire and Water, that is the ideal Fire and the ideal water;the Spirit and the Water of Creation-the spiritual Ether and the Etheral Fire (of the HolySpirit). This, in the Creation the Man is extended from Tiphareth i.e. the moment Adam iscreated, that is the beginning of the reflection of the Lower triad, and finally of Malkuth.Eve is a synthesis of Creation and represents the Mother of Life, as the name ChaVaH is.The 3=8 diagram thus represents the establishment of Life, i.e. created life, and the Goodand Evil is represented in Malkuth, and it is the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evilbecause it is the balance point between Good and Evil: for in the material Body we areplaced to give the victory to which we will. Hence the significance of the word Serpent, 'Yeshall be as Gods, knowing Good and Evil'. But the knowledge of Evil brought with it thedescent into the Qlippoth, and although Malkuth is directly involved in the 'Fall', theSephiroth immediately above cannot be said to have actually entered into the knowledge ofEvil. Therefore in the allegorical account of the Creation in Genesis, it is said that Man ischecked from putting forth his hand to take of the Tree of Life, so as not to involve thehigher Sephiroth in the 'Fall', which, (he being unbalanced in himself) would only haveprecipitated disaster.In the 4=7 diagram we find represented the fall and the consequent rise of the Dragon,which in the 3=8 Grade is represented coiled beneath Malkuth in the Kingdom of the Shells;but it only raise its head to the Sephiroth by right of the Crowns of the Kingdom of Edom.These latter represent the Worlds of unbalanced force, before the Creation is established.They furthermore symbolise the places of the Sephiroth which are hollowed and before thelight fills the cavities (the Light which comes down and fills the cavities is to be foundallegorically set forth in the story of the usurpation of the younger brother in the story ofEsau and Jacob). \"before all things were the Waters, and the darkness, and the Gates of theland of the Night.' Note also the war of the Titans who rise and fight against Jupiter. TheEdomite Kings, therefore, are not altogether Evil, but they are partly connected with Evil.They are the forces of restriction.The result, therefore on a higher plane, in the Tree, the Great Serpent rises to Daath,and if the Four Worlds be placed upon the Tree itself, it will be observed that the cutting offby the Serpent is between Yetzirah and Briah. Thus Evil cannot arise into the World ofBriah, or indeed transcend the limits of Yetzirah. But if we seek for the correspondence of461"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Evil in the Worlds of Briah and Atziluth, it will be found to consist in a Lesser form ofGood, a limiting, restricting and binding force without which you cannot have form on theHigher Planes. It is only in the Worlds of Yetzirah and Assiah that the analogue of thisprinciple becomes absolutely Evil. This idea was expressed by the Gnostics when they saidthat the Achamoth attempted to comprehend the Pleroma, and could not understand it, andfrom the grief of her were formed the demons and Evil Spirits.Therefore, if we seek to institute the analogy between the Microcosm, it will be seenthat the Nephesch refers to Malkuth and Assiah: Ruach will refer to Yetzirah, which is theWorld of Formation, therefore the formative principle operating Ruach gives form to allideas, and is that which weighs, balances and works in things. Ruach can also have an Evilside.The Neschamah is the Highest Aspirations of the Soul, which aspire to the ideal. Therecan be no positively Evil side to the Neschamah, there will only be higher and loweraspirations.If the Ruach overpowers the Neschamah; if the Neschamah seeks the lower good, bothwill be ruined. The following of a false idea cannot be said to be exactly Evil, but is a lowerGood than it should be. The Neschamah will answer to the World of Briah, as also will theChiah, which is allotted to Cholunah; but you cannot touch the Yechidah part of you withyour Ruach; you must use the consciousness of the Neschamah. This Yechidah will,together with the Chia', be the `I-figher Genius', though this again will not be the HighestSelf. For in and behind Kether will reside part of the being, which is impossible tounderstand, and which one can only aim at: this is the Highest. Soul, and answering to theHighest part of the Yechidah, cannot be touched by the Neschamah. There must be a modeof transferring the synthesis of the consciousness making up the Man: to this upperSephirah. The Fall, which cut away the Higher from the Lower Sephiroth in Daath, was alsoour descent into this Life, as it were from That Upper and Higher Soul. Therefore ourobject is to get into contact with that again, which is only to be done through theNeschamah, which is the Divine Mother of the Soul; our Aima.'Commentary on the OpeningThe Chief Adept stands outside the Door of the Vault while the Second and Third Adeptstand behind him in the form of a triangle, representing the Supernal Father, Mother and Son. TheChief Adept knocks once. This knock directly taps the energy of the Chief Adept, in his dual formas Isis and Christian Rosenkreutz. The Isis association links directly to the Venus door through itsdevotional current. The Rosicrucian link is formed through the Seven Rays which surround theVault, and which the Chief Adept taps into. It is both the Emotional and the Astral forms of theChief Adept that form and secure the link through this initial knock. Taylor told me this about thispart of the opening ceremony of the 5=6 Grade, which is worth passing on:`When I first became Hierophant and also took the part of the Chief Adept in the 5=6 I hada very good teacher who was also psychic to boot. The first knock he told me was to reachinto and through the Veil of the Rainbow. Sometimes when I used to do this knock my aurawould be flooded by the multi-colours so there was no doubt in my mind what its functionwas...There are a series of six following knocks, two each by each officer. The number of the knocksrepresents the Sephirah of Tiphareth, the 6th Sephiroth, however, there are many levels to this and Iagain take my lead from Taylor:`Each of the next series of knocks does produce a unity, but a separation in the subtlebodies, in the first three batteries. Here the Astral bodies of the Officers are dislodged andsent into the Vault. The next three knocks links the Etheric bodies of the Officers firmlywith the energy from the Vault - the Seven Rays. It is the function of the Chief Adept tomake the link and then forge a bridgehead for the, other officers to enter a type of EthericLimbo which initially captures the Rosicrucian current from the Vault itself. Once when I462"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"was Chief Adept, I found myself inside the Vault with my two companions. Realising that Iwas in the Astral form I then struggled to put my consciousness back into my physical body.On that occasion Hugh Campbell was Second Adept and he had the same problem. He and Iboth 'jumped' at the same time. Considering that Hugh and I would not agree on even thetime of day, for us both to agree on this matter must have been monumental. Mrs. Felkintold me afterwards that it had happened to her husband a number of times and showed thepower of the 5=6.'The next words by the three Officers comes from the Rosicrucian greeting. With the words `Avete,Fratres et Sorores' the Chief Adept prepares the Officers for the Rosicrucian current that all havepreviously tapped into to get ready to focus and capture its essence for the ceremony. With thesewords the Chief Adept then starts to attune his or her Etheric Body to stabilise the energy from theVault. The load is taken by the next two officers each side of the Chief and a triangle of power isformed.The Chief Adept then calls on the other officers to assist him in opening the Vault. Now thislink is very different one than linking into the current of the rainbow scale which was donepreviously. Here one has to actually open the Vault and let all these energies be experienced on thephysical level. The Grade sign given by the Third Adept is done in the God-form of Osiris for this isthe Sign of Osiris Slain. The old self has been dis-assimilated and placed in a temporary state ofLimbo. This suspension state is the one needed for the Vault to be opened. It sets the tone for thewhole ceremony. The sign of closing the veil is also then given. The Hebrew letters PRKTh is thengiven by the Temple Officers.After the Third Adept gives the speech on the Mystic Mountain of Abiegnus, The Officerssalute with the L.V.X Signs. I was always intrigued by the way these Signs were glossed over inthis section of the ceremony, in the ritual description, yet as part of the Divine White Brillianceformula they are thoroughly explained. When I put this to Taylor he replied:`The First 5=6 Signs in the ritual are to connect the Officers correctly to both theirRosicrucian and Egyptian counterparts, through their Etheric form. It prepares them forwhat will happen when they enter the Vault and really start turning on the power. Mrs.Felkin felt that they were an alignment of the aura or subtle bodes as you prefer to call them.They are also a recognition signal that all those present are truly Adepts. Do not forget thatbefore any can enter the vault the L.V.X signs must be done first.'The Adepts then read out the speeches showing that the way to the Vault is by Initiation only.In one such speech The Chief Adept 'What is the Key to this Tomb?'. The Second Adept replies`The Rose and Cross, which resumes the Life of Nature and the Powers hidden in the word I.N.R.I.'.This refers to the formula of Divine White Brilliance (not yet revealed) that implants, throughKether, the descent of the Second Order power into the aura of the Adepts.A brief description of the Wands of the Officers are then given. Now the grip positions duringthese speeches are as follows: The Chief Adept holds the Wand by the Blue band, which symbolisesthat his rank of Office is associating to the Sephiroth of Chesed. The Second Adept holds his Wandin the Grip of Mars, to Symbolize his Office in Geburah, while the Third Adept holds the LotusWand by the Leo band which is the binding force holding together the two Higher Powers, and bythis holds the Balance of Power between either extreme.The Third Adept tells us that the words inscribed on the Door of the Tomb of the ChristianRosenkreutz, are: 'After 120 years I shall open.' Then follows a further analyses of the number 120.The Door of the Vault is then opened and the Three Adepts enter and form a triangle aroundthe pastos. The Three wands are raised above (forming a three sided pyramid) and the ankh' s belowalso touch. The grip positions on the Wands now change to holding the black bands on each ofthem. This effect grounds their Astral form with their physical and it also evokes a cone of power intheir Etheric Bodies. The Hidden formula in the crossing of the Wands is the L.V.X., which bringsdown the Light from the Mystic Rose above (of twenty=two letters) in the ceiling of the Vault.Now when the wands are held by their Black bands it acts as a clearing of latent energy. One cannot463"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"banish in the Vault so the use of the wands this way is the next best thing. Its functions differSlightly from that of the Kerux who utters in the Neophyte Ceremony 'Hekas, Hekas, EsteBebeloi!'The Wands first clear out the latent energy but then the Light comes down once the latentenergy has been drawn out. The use of the Ankhs here is crucial for they are responsible for theenergy coming back down, through the wands and into the Altar and eventually the Pastos itself.The Ankhs touch just above the Altar. The energy then dislodges itself directly into the Altar wherethe energy of the Four Kerubim guard any energy entering the Vault.Taylor told me of an interesting event that happened at Whare Ra in the late 1920's. Onemember of the temple who took the part of the Third Adept (as a last minute replacement for anofficer who was ill) found that when they entered the Vault and touched the ankhs it felt like anelectric shock, and the Third Adept was knocked back against the Vault Wall. Dr. Felkin. who wasacting as Chief Adept (with Reginald Gardiner as Second Adept), stopped the ceremony. They thenretires to a small room and after questioning the Third Adept he found out that the man had beenperforming some rituals that were 'incompatible with Golden Dawn teaching'. Mrs. Felkin thencame into the room during this, completely unaware of what had happened, immediately banishedover the person who she then pronounced was literally possessed. A possession ceremony was doneon the spot, with positive results and the 5=6 was allowed to resume the next day.When the energy passes through the Kerubic Emblems it travels into the pastos (below theAltar) for here the Astral form Christian Rosenkreutz is resident in the Pastos itself.Formula of Divine White BrillianceI.N.R.I. The Analysis of the Key word I.N.R.I. is the epitome of Redemption. One aspect shows thewords 'Jesus Namenus Rex Judicorum` which is the Four Fold name YHVH, but its essentialsignificance is Creative, not redemptive. The Sun in Virgo accomplishes the transmutation ofScorpio. The Virgin Mother treading on the head of the Serpent so that the father may be bornagain in the Son. This is the Key to the Rosicrucian philosophy, the, Redemption of matter bytransforming the human to the Divine. The blending of Dew and the Fire of Purification and,Consecration. The Exaltation of the Cross of Light.The Rosicrucian idealogy of the Order tends to associate the key Phrase with the followingSymbology:Yod VirgoNun ScorpioResh SunYod VirgoThe last Yod, being repetitive, is dropped. So from the Four we pass to the Three - The triangle ofSpirit rising from the Cube of Matter. Isis the eternal Virgin, Osiris, father, and Son Horus, andbetween them the Serpent which must be transformed into the Eagle. The Destroyer who mustbecome the Transmuter. It is no accident that these representations are shown in the Tarot Key`Death', the Path to Tiphareth, where the renewal of Life in another form is shown. Mathers says ofthis formula:\"It is written: 'Os father was the Sun, his Mother was the Moon, the Air carried him in herbosom, his nurse was the Earth.\" Recall the analysis of the Key word of the Adeptus MinorGrade, I.N.R.I.The first 'I' is Virgo, Isis, Mighty Mother - in this sense 'Mother' being the producer ofseeds and fruit of the Earth when the Sun is therein.`N' is Scorpio, Apophis, Destroyer - the Destructive Force which is brought into play, tocheck or restrict the continuation of the action of the. Regenerative Force.`R' is Sol.The final 'I' is Osiris Slain and Risen - the Sun in the decadence of Force from the AutumnalEquinox, and his increase of Force from the Vernal Equinox.\"Mathers was trying to show here that the whole concept of what he was trying to establish was the464"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"-cycle of Nature itself and the influence the Sun has on it. In many respects this is the concept inMacrocosm of the construction of the Vault itself.We must never lose sight of the fact that the call on the INRI formula is done by a group and-in the Vault, and this sets it apart from performing it as a solo exercise. This brings through anadditional aspect of the Light that uses Wands and ankhs as a conduit of force for both the Altarand Pastos. In Kabbalistic terms, the Ruachs of the temple Officers now merge with the Ruach ofthe energy of the Vault. It is the first point of the Light coming through into the Vault. The INRIformula now acts as a tuning fork for this energy and virtually tells it that it is redemptive.It mustdie to live again and that is exactly what will happen to the energy within the Vault once theceremony is over. The INRI formula tells us what we want to contact and how much of it werequire, the next formula tells us how to Direct and utilise this energy, and most importantly, whereit comes from.The Vault has been charged each year at Corpus Christi in the 'Consecration of the VaultRitual' but this energy is the one that sustains it. The Corpus Christi ritual merely prepares it and bya modern analogy sets the electrical wire up so that someone will flip the switch to turn the poweron. The Vault is not dormant either and if one enters it without the correct preparation of the LVXSigns, then one is astrally asking for one to touch a live cable of considerable voltage. The LVX-Signs clothe one in a magnetism that is allied to what one will expect in the Vault. Once you get inthere you then raise the current up to the pitch you want. Additional to the above formula is theadded concept of the vibratory phrase I.A.O. which is thought to be taker,' from the Hebrew-`Shemesh Olam' (Sun of the World) for here it shows that all things return to the Source, the Sun,as Osiris.L . V. XThe English translation of the latin LVX is 'Light'. This is accomplished by making the letters withthe arms. The important thing to remember is that from one of the important Golden Dawnperspectives the Signs are done within an imaginary circle of the zodiac with each hand touchingone or more of certain constellations. By placing the hands in these positions one in fact drawsdown the energy from these constellations. The Adept or Adepts emulate the Solar Drama, inMicrocosm.Now before the L.V.X signs areutilised The Sign of the 5=6, Osiris Slain isgiven by all Officers. This brings harmonyand balance to the Adepts and the Astraland Etheric sheaths they have created forthe ritual. It temporarily aligns all the subtlebodies and chakras for a small moment intime so that this energy can come through.Because these Signs are done in the Vaultan extra void is created and that can onlybe done through the symbolic sacrifice orSelf sacrifice, shown by the form of Osirisand the Equinoctal currents he manipulates.By this I do not mean that the 5=6 ritualcan only be done at Equinox but that theimpetus of force field that the Equinoxproduces can be duplicated for a limitedtime in the Vault, and this is triggered bythe Signs of Osiris Slain.465"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Now we go to the first Sign of the LVX trilogy, and this is the Sign ofthe Mourning of Isis and is performed by the Chief Adept in the Astralform of Isis. The Chief Adept raises his right arm above him, with hiselbow slighty bent in the air above him, the upper finger and wristpoint to an apex directly above the crown, this forms a lazy 'L'. Thehead is bent, to his left, as though in mourning, and the whole upperbody is slightly bent towards the lowered arm (which is bent and is amirror image to the upper arm). The Upper hand points to 0 degreesCancer, of which Jupiter (the planetary association of the Chief Adept)is exalted in. The left arm is slightly apart from the side, but due to thebent angle of the body, the hand now rests directly in front of thegenital region, in the position of 0 degrees Capricorn, in which Mars isexalted. Here the energy of Light, through necessity, has caused thesorrow to Isis through the death of Osiris. As this concept wasexplained to me initially :`Isis seeks the Mercy of Chesedas she points to the cause of herproblems in Capricorn. Isis truimphsover Set through the libertion of Hornsfor the war between Light and darkness. The Light called byIsis pushes down through to Horns (The exaltation of Marsin Capricorn). Hope, however is on the horizon as Isismourns, for the hands are in the position of the SummerSolstice, in the case of the right arm and the Winter Solsticein the case of the left. The upper 'L', from which the initialpower is drawn shows the Sun in the Summer Solstice, andequating with the Life Force of Osiris.'Now both Crowley and Regardie referred to the LVX sign as beingbut three aspects of the symbol of the Cross, unfortunately however,the Zodiac signs were never drawn around this cross to show themeanings in their relative context.VBoth Arms are placed in the V position above the head of the SecondAdept. Now the Second Adept forms the energy of Geburah but in the formof Typhon. The right hand of the Adept is 0 degrees Virgo, the left hand isin 0 degrees Taurus, showing the transmutation of the forces of the EarthSigns into growth through the influence of the Moon and Mercury. Thewhole span of the V arc encompasses from mid spring to late summer, theperiod where Horns waged war against Typhon Set, and once victorious,also destroyed the enemies of Ra. The Light drawn from the arc into the Vpoint which brings Light into darkness.XThe Third Adept, representing Tiphareth and Osiris, performs the final Signin the trilogy by crossing the arms and bowing the head. This is the Sign ofOsiris Risen, for he has risen as result of both the Equinox's and theSolstice for his spirit had separated, tried and regenerated throughredemption. The crossed arms represent the four points of the Equinox andSolstice's and show that the Sun has now gone a full cycle and Osiris willnow rise from his posture of death (also shown by the crossed arms). Theenergy of Tiphareth is Redemption and this brings for new growth.466"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"The Three Officers now say the LVXformula in unison and perform the Sign ofOsiris Slain.If you carefully study the actions ofeach Officer in the vault up to this point youwill find the actions of three Sephiroth onmany fundamental levels. The Motherweeping for the Son through the Chief Adept,the Fight for the Soul, the battle betweenTyphon -Set and Horus, and the Redemption.All actions in the Vault have reinforced thesethree themes. Any energy or form that nowenters the Vault will be subjected to thesethree stages. In modern terms it works thepulsation rate for the energy to enter. Anyenergy coming in must be transformed andany energy going out must follow the sameprocess. This is the theme which preventsnegativity from entering the Vault for if by arare chance it does, it will be instantlytransformed into a positive state, hence thenecessity for anyone entering the Vault to dothe LVX signs first.The Sign of Osiris is then given again and this is the signal that the energy force that has beenasked to appear is in effect in the Vault and now the Three Adepts must withdraw from the Vault.Taylor always described the leaving of the Vault in this manner similar to that of an air lock wherethe pressure is re-adjusted.With the use of the Grand Word and Keyword, through the Concealed word, a portal isestablished so that even with the open door nothing negative will enter nor will any vital energyescape. It also sets the tone for the ritual using the Three aspects of the LVX Signs where anythingthat comes through the Portal will be greatly transmuted. Taylor added this:`...You must remember that to enter the Vault you are experiencing a very powerful energyand to get to this level a number of steps must be taken. The first is in the Opening which is tosecure the Portal, bring the current through to the Vault then raise the pitch of energy in the Portaleven further when one leaves the vault, at the end of the opening part of the ceremony.. When thePostulant next comes through that Portal, even before he gets to the Vault, the energy must feellike walking into an electric fog. I have often seen flashing blue and purple sparks hum around theofficers after the Vault is opened. To anyone who is psychic this can be a very deep and movingexperience...'FIRST POINT The Chief Adept now remains hidden in the Vault as Osiris Slain, hidden in another world-for the door and Curtain in front of it are closed to the outside world. The Wand and Ankh of theChief Adept are now hung on the Inner door of the vault. The Chief Adept is the Etheric form ofChristian Rosenkreutz, waiting for the Vault to open so that his Spirit can be released.The Second Adept now acts as Horus, son of Osiris and takes charge of the Portal outside ofthe Vault. The Third Adept who took the part of Osiris in the Opening now is interchangeable withthat of Anubis. I was always curious about this interchangeable concept and when I asked Taylor hereplied:`You must remember Anubis was the Guardian of the Souls, and he takes care of thePostulant in that manner. Do not forget though that the Astral form of the Postulant and theChief Adept also change, for they are all forms of Osiris.'467"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"What happens is that the postulant enters the Portal clothed in the Astral Shell of Osiris himself.This is formulated by the Chief Adept before the ritual actually starts. The Astral form of Osiris andhis form is now united and like Osiris he must follow in his footsteps and go through the death andrebirth. It took me quite a while to understand what Taylor was getting at, as he sometimes had thehabit of making a cryptic comment then leaving me to think about it before he would elaborateanther. This is also shown in the Catholic Church where people travel the Stations of the Cross inthe hope that if they emulate the important points leading up to the death and resurrection of Christthat some of it will rub oft and it often does. We in the Golden Dawn do exactly the same thing,but it is more controlled. We also utilise more than one energy level where the Christians prefer touse but one. The Rosicrucian energy does not permit this, and people must take their own way tofind the body and spirit of the Founder in the Mystic Mountain. This is why there are three mainlevels, for in some instances the resurrection theme is independent of the candidate and in others hetakes a part of it.After the Tomb is opened the Astral Body of the Postulant now lies in the Pastos, under thecare of the Chief Adept. Now, as the Postulant enters the Portal he is asked by the Third Adept, bywhat Weapon does he enter? - he replies the Sword - and by what symbol - the Serpent. TheAnubis now takes charge of his Etheric Body, though it is the 'Introducing Adept' (who enters thePortal with him) who must now prepare him for his journey. He takes the Postulant outside andstrips him of all necessities, and binds his hands behind his back. At this juncture, the 'IntroducingAdept now becomes a 'shadow form' of Osiris as well.When the Postulant shows the Admission badge and is admitted back into the Portal it is thefirst phase were all the chakras become aligned. One person who underwent the 5=6 at Whare Ra,actually heard a type of Ethereal music being played at this point in the ceremony. I would point outthat the postulant is in a very uncomfortable position with the hands bound tightly, and with a heavychain around the neck (not a light one by any means). The postulant is fully realised, on the Ethericlevel at the very least) that he or she enters the Portal with heavy burdens. One paper on the 5=6, -written by the Stella Matutina says:`The candidate enters and asserts his pretentious, only to be reproved and admonished tohumility whereon he retreats and appears prepared for the offering and dedication of allthose Lower Principles which have awakened previously. In the earlier ceremonies thesehave been purified and consecrated...'The Speech of the Second Adept refers to the Postulant letting go of the Ego and surrendering himor herself to the Higher Forces of the Soul. This speech is actually a from of petition to the HigherForces that govern the Order, on behalf of the Postulant. What the Second Adept now does is tolink his Etheric form with that of the candidate to stimulate the upper Chakras directly. His gripposition on the Wand now changes to the White Upper Part. As such, he then uses his upperchakras to take control. The energy then goes upward through the head of the wand and bathes thePostulant's Etheric body with additional energy. As a result of this the Emotional Body is to acertain extent 'cut loose' from the Astral and allowed to support the Etheric since the Astral formof the Postulant is in the Vault.I experienced this concept a number of times in eastern meditations when I was living in Indiaa couple of decades ago. One very hot morning my then teacher, Vivandatta, came to the area that Ihad chosen to do meditation exercises, which happened to be under the branches of a large tree. Icould feel his presence for a few minutes behind me and since he did not interrupt, so I continuedwith what I was doing. At one point in the meditation which I was working on, I felt a barrier andcould not break through it. Vivandatta suddenly told me that I was holding back and withoutanother word I felt a shower of magnetic sparks over me and I achieved the breakthrough I wasafter, and met the Goddess. His energy came from, the walking stick he was never without, andworked on a similar principle to the wand of the Second Adept. Like the Second Adept Vivandattaworked directly on my Etheric body and the upper centres, from his upper centres. When Taylortook me through the 5=6 the same feeling happened.468"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"The unbinding process of the hands is 'in sync' with the transferring of consciousness fromthe Upper to the Higher. The raising of the Officers from the kneeling to the standing position is ineffect symbolic of the rise from the Lower to the Higher. The speech of the Third Adept then tellsthe Postulant that the previous speech was `but to jest with thy feelings'. I have often found thatthis was a rather strange statement to make at this crucial point of the ritual, what it refers tothough is the use of the Emotions, or moreparticularly the Emotional Body to givepower to the Etheric. The Emotional Bodycan actually alter cellular structure, and whenworking directly in empathy with the Etheric.The Third Adept here works more directlythrough the Emotional Body and inparticular, the heart centre. It gives thePostulant an anchoring process so badlyneeded while the change is starting tomanifest.The Second Adept then tells thePostulant to rise. He or she realises thatattainment to the ideal is still not complete.Nor are the trials and tribulations that onemust go through. The Speech of the SecondAdept is then set to instil the virtues of theOrder as well as some of the obligations.In the next phase of the rituals part ofthe symbology of 120 is revealed to thePostulant and he or she is then reminded as towhat has been accomplished so far and whatis to be expected when one enters the Vault.The Postulant then agrees to take theOath and is lead to the Cross of Suffering.Cross of SufferingThis is quite a large Red heavy cross on which the Postulant is bound. Its colour is for the symbolof Suffering, the Blood of Sacrifice (It is in the place where the Hiereus stands in the 0=0, and theHiereus also represents the Mars force). Around the four cross bars is a Golden circle which showsthat to attain the Golden Tiphareth one must bind oneself to a life of sacrifice and suffering. Abovethe Head of the Cross are the letters I.N.R.I. The Cross is situated in the West corner of the Hall,quite a distance away from the Dais and the Vault. It is so placed because it is the Corner whereThe Sun sets, it is the opposite to the rising Dawn of the East and directly opposite to the Vaultdoor. As Jack Taylor said:Tor in the setting Sun comes the shadows of darkness, which are like the Qlippothic forcesand these must be sent away and that can only be done through suffering. The Shadows ofthe West also resemble the Lower forms of the Qlippoth that try to fight their way up theTree, which the Aspirant is lashed upon.'With the Rose Crucifix that the Second Adept holds out to the Postulant, a link is formedfrom Geburah, which the Second Adept represents. This is a symbol of the hardship he is about toendure. Once this is taken and accepted the Second Adept then invokes the Angel HUA, but as anavenging angel. In previous books I have mentioned the difference between the HRU and HUA andthe confusion between them (Taylor thought this confusion was a blind and never worried about it.He always insisted that there were a number of blinds in the Rituals, a point which a number of highranking Whare Ra Adepts agreed with). It is the function of HRU when invoked to seek out469"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"negative aspects and destroy them. The Second Adept however invokes HRU of the Second Ordernot of the Self, a point that has often been overlooked. The Avenging angel HRU is the power ofthe Third Order working through the Second. By accepting its judgement one can possibly layoneself open to some negative kickbacks if all is not in order. I know of at least three cases fromWhare Ra where the crucifixion on the Cross produced a series of setbacks in their personal lives.Afterwards things settled down, but for a number of people who were not ready for this it is thepsychic version of a homeopathic healing crises. Additional use of the IA0 formula helps bringthrough the energy of HRU by a thorough cleansing of the heart chakra. When the Third Adepttakes the crucifix back and places it on the Altar. Osiris has now accepted the burden the Postulantis about to endure.The Obligation in this ritual is extremely important. Mathers says of this:`In the fully Initiated Adept the Nephesch is so withdrawn into the Ruach that even thelowest parts of these two principles cease to become allied to the Body and are withdrawninto the first six Sephiroth. This is again brought out in the Obligation, where you say 'Ipledge myself to hereby give myself to the Great Work, which is so to exalt my lower naturethat I may at length become more than human and thus gradually raise and unite myself tomy Higher and Divine Genius'. If it is a very great thing to unite yourself to your Genius,how much more so must it be to unite yourself with the God that is behind it...It isespecially intended to effect the change of consciousness into the Neschamah...when theAspirant is on the Cross, because he is so exactly fulfilling the Symbol of Abnegation of theLower Self and the Union with the Higher Self 'In the first clause of the Obligation, through Kether, the Adept is told point blank that he is amember of the Body of Christ (through the Rosicrucian framework). It is because of this I felt thatbefore going through the 5=6 the Aspirant should be informed of the Clauses of the Obligation andwhat to visualise. Taylor helped me here greatly, for he told me what energies to expect and how toaccept them more fully. I was told, to formulate the spirit, and energy, of Christ around me in anAstral form, for it is here that the Astral Body comes out of the Vault body and unites with thePhysical. I would like to quote Taylor again on this point.`The Cross of Suffering has all the attributes of the LVX Sign imbedded in it. When youutter the first words of the Obligation, this attracts the Light down into your subtle bodiesand pulls back the Astral into its correct place. The Golden Ring around the Cross alsohelps lock this Light into your heart centre or Ruach.'The explanations of the Obligations to each Sephirah is Self explanatory. What one is doing is bringdown the Light (attracted by the Cross and Obligation) so that the whole Astral form is filled withlight and energy. I have felt this and others who have gone through this experience have also felt it.When Malkuth is reached then the Aspirant invokes the Avenging Angel HUA (which is HRU asboth are titles of Kether) which is now a direct link to the Higher self.In the terms of Subtle Body anatomy what actually happens is an alignment between SubtleBodies and the Chakras (you must remember that this alignment is temporary) and transfer ofconsciousness to the upper centres. On a deeper level one breaks across the gulf and one is brieflyconscious of the Higher mental, Casual and Spirit Bodies. It has been my experience though thatthis jump in consciousness is to the Higher Mental Body and no Higher. To fully explain the deepersignificance of this would probably take a small book in itself save that the Ego (which comprisesthe Physical \\Etheric\\ Astral-Emotional and Lower mental are the vehicles that disintegrate afterDeath while the other three bodies go on in a form of immortality. The Spleen chakra goes intooverload to cope with the energy transference at this point as well.The Third Adept now anoints the Postulant in the cross of Light for the dagger here worksdirectly on the Etheric centres in a form of purification and also help release the burden of assumingthe Christ Form. This is also the signal for the consciousness to return to the Lower subtle bodiesthough the consciousness in the Higher Chakras is retained.The next part of the ceremony is a history lesson, by the Third and Second Adepts, on the970"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"47,70 13"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"adventures of Christian Rosenkreutz. The Postulant is then given the Chief Adepts Wand and Ankh,and leaves the ceremony to retire to the anti-chamber.SECOND POINTThe Chief Adept lies in the Pastos on his back. At one level he represents ChristianRosenkreutz, on the next he is Osiris, as shown by the Crook and Scourge across his chest. Onanother level, he is Amon the Concealed One, and on another he is Christ in the Tomb after theCrucifixion. This can be very confusing ith regard to what level he is working at. Taylor maintainedthat all these levels were utilised, and each level vibrated to a particular energy the subtle bodies areattuned to. The results are as follows. On the Etheric level he is Christian Rosenkreutz, on theAstral he is Osiris, on the Emotional he is Christ and on the Mental level he is Amon. It took mequite some time to grasp all this when Taylor first instructed me on all its principles. He told me-that Amon must represents the mental level because it has to cross the abyss to the upper levels andthis can only be done with the Mental Body. Taylor told me that his teacher (a former member ofBristol temple) told him to lie in the Pastos and take the form of each level, then link the formstogether through the Chakras. He told me that it took a great deal of time and energy to docorrectly. Also he informed me that in the Golden Dawn proper, all these forms were created to beheld through the power of the Ruach. Taylor and others who worked with the subtle bodies decided-to use the above formula, which proved a great deal easier than using the Kabbalistic one. Alsofrom a practical viewpoint at Whare Ra, they found it best to let some air in the Pastos and it wasalso better for the Chief Adept in the Pastos to be heard. I have been told on a number of occasionsthat those speaking from the Pastos could not be heard properly!On command of the Second Adept the Aspirant is admitted by the Third Adept. He holds theWand of the Chief Adept by its Yellow band and the Ankh at its yellow juncture. This is to show-that he is now in harmony with his Higher Self and his Tiphareth centre is now directly under theguidance of his Higher Genius. The Wand and Ank of the Chief Adept are in fact placed on hookson the Inner door and they are given to the Aspirant at this juncture. The Aspirant is then placed infront of the Vault door. Now at Whare Ra, the Vault door was undetected and had an outer coversimilar to stone, with a green curtain in front of it (the colour of the Path of Nun) with a thread ofGold running through it (the reflection from the gold of Tiphareth).Inner Vault Door Diagram ( refer to colour plates for diagram) When this outer door was drawn back it revealed the Five Enochian Tablets (as per diagram) alsodirectly above this was a Red Rose. The Kerubic emblems were also at each corner protecting theVault from any negative energies entering.The Second Adept now explains the concept of the Kerubic emblems while the Third Adeptexplains the original finding of the Tomb of Christian Rosenkreutz. The Third Adept continues thehistory lesson but now opens the door to the Vault and enters with the Third Adept. The SecondAdept is at the head of the pastos in the East, the Third adept in the South and the Aspirant in theNorth - all facing the Pastos. At this point a descriptions is given of the Altar by the Second Adept.AltarThe Altar itself is on castors or wheels and is wide enough to be able to move it so that thewheels are either side of the pastos when it is placed directly over it, apart from the top, the altar iswhite. The Altar has four disks in the colours of the Four Elements. These are arranged with theRed disk (Leo - Fire) at the East and head of the pastos. Directly below it is the Yellow disk(Aquarius - Air) in the West, the Black Disk (Taurus - Earth) in the South and the Blue Disk(Scorpio - Water) in the North. The arrangement here is shown in the Golden Dawn treatise on Starmaps, each colour represents a Sign and a point allotted to the Four Tiphareth points on the map ofthe Zodiac in the Heavens. Since the Golden Dawn astrological map acknowledges Leo as thestarting point, of the Zodiac symbol for Leo is placed at the top position of the Altar, closest to the-head of the Pastos.The Red Disk is a Green Lion with the Letter Yod; on the Black Disk is aWhite Ox and the Letter Heh(F); on the Yellow Disk a Purple man's head and the Letter Vau; onthe Blue Disk an Orange eagle and the letter Heh. Each of these figures are winged to represent the471"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Four Kerubs who guard the Universe. On the Lion's head is an upright cross on a stand and aburning lamp, on the Bulls head is a chain, on the man's head a dagger and on the Eagle's head acup. The implements can be likened to the principle of the Tarot Princesses and Aces rotating in the`Convoluted Forces' paper.The black background on the top of the table represents the Universe or night sky and theFixed points on it (the disks) are there to guide the Adept.On the White letter Shin (on which incense is placed) shows the redemptive quality thatrenews the elements and is the guiding force in the name. It alludes also to the Christ like influenceof resurrection.After the Altar has been explained to the Postulantall those in the Vault kneel and join their wands above the Altar, and the Second Adept theninvokes the power of the Order (through the LVX formula of the Crossed wands) to come downthrough to the Kether of the Aspirant. The energy the Second Adept has invoked is that of theChrist current.When the Chain is handed to the Postulant and the bonds of Self sacrifice are then accepted,he stands in the form of a Cross and part of that which he felt on the Cross of suffering then re-occurs but only on the higher centres. A link is then formed again with the Christ influence. Afterthis there is another anointing, as before. This anointing is done in the Vault itself and this is thepoint that makes the difference. We must accept that the Christian Rosenkreutz mysteries are partof the Christian Ethic, and when the Second Adept tells the Postulant to rise he does so, not only inthe form of Christ but also in current of the Founder Christian Rosenkreutz. The whole process isnow controlled by the Third Adept, using his influence as Amon in guiding both the Christianaosicrucian currents.When the Altar is moved away, revealing the upper part of the pastos, and the lid is openedthe Chief Adept is revealed. Now what the Aspirant sees is the Form of Osiris, for Amon cannot beseen. The Third Adept now has the function, to remove any Etheric Obstructions in the Postulant,this is done through holding the band of Leo on his Lotus Wand. This shows a new beginning and anew incoming energy, it also gives strength and support to the Postulant. On instructions from theSecond Adept, the Postulant must now touch the Rose Cross with the head of the Chief Adept'sWand. Mathers maintained that this effect transfers the Consciousness from the Ruach to theNeschamah, this explanation, though important, is just the tip of the iceberg. Taylor explained thispart of the ceremony:`The energy in the Wand now links again with a charge when it touches the Rose Cross. Ihave actually seen it spark on more than one occasion and do not put it down to staticelectricity, but more to a type of Etheric energy...'What happens is that the Wand's Astral energy touches that form of Osiris, in the Astral. Now thisAstral form of Osiris is not the Astral Body of the Chief Adept but a form he or she built up on theAstral plane. The use of the wand now breaks the link with Chief Adept and it becomes a form ofits own volition, linked to the Postulant through the Wand. The exchange of Wand for the Crookand scourge is symbolic of the transference that has just taken place and the Postulant now becomesOsiris. The Third Adept helps the Postulant cross the crook and Scourge at the Chest then gives hisspeech which though historical, builds up to the main part, 'In God are we born, in Yeheshuah wedie, through the Holy Spirit we rise again.' For the Postulant is now reborn. The pastos is re-closedand the Postulant walks out of the Tomb with the Crook and Scourge crossed. Some years agowhen a couple from Whare Ra (both of whom were extremely psychic) underwent the 5=6 theyfound that the placing of the Crook and Scourge across the heart definitely changed something inthemselves. Others have made the same remark. This is the acceptance of Osiris as ones spiritualbenefactor. Those of the Christian beliefs sometimes feel it on the Cross, but for the majority, thecrossing of the Crook and Scourge was the trigger point for many changes to come into the future.THIRD POINTThe pastos is now placed outside the Vault and on the temple floor. It is a symbol of the472"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"INNER VAULT DOOR"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"empty tomb of the risen Christ, and Osiris. The speech of the Second Adept is a direct biblicalquote from the one of the Gospels, after the resurrection, to reinforce this fact. The Second Adeptthen explains the meaning of the top of the Pastos. Mathers says of this part of the ceremony:`...whether he understands it, or not, the Aspirant actually approaches his own Genius...Now if the Genius part, instead of identifying itself with the God part, identifies itself toomuch with the Neschamah, a fall of the Genius takes place: which is not altogether Evil butmay entail a certain Evil effect. The most complete point of contact (between Aspirant andhis Genius P.Z.) is in the Third Point, where the Chief Adept says: \"I am the Resurrectionand the Life! He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live, and whosoeverliveth and believeth in Me shall never die\": i.e. if you can live at Will in the Neschamah andtouch the Genius, you will have made a great step towards the Divine Elixir, for you will beworthy to sit with the Gods, and that which you drink of is the real Elixir, the Elixir of theSpirit of Life.Then the Second Adept says: \"Behold the Image of the Justified One, crucified on the Crossof the Infernal Rivers of Death\", and the Third Adept shows deific antithesis: the Exaltationinto the Divine. Then the Chief Adept says again: \"I am the first and the last\"; the Aleph andthe Tau and the Yod and the Heh final of the Sacred Name; \"I am He that liveth but wasDead, and behold! I am alive forever more. Amen\", that is using the name of the EgyptianDeity AMON, or Amen, who represents the Ideal God Force: \"and I hold the Keys of Deathand of Hell\" (because if you stand on Malkuth and keep your touch with the Gods, you holdthe Keys of that which is below). But the Lower Self all this time has an existence, for it iscertainly not quite eliminated: it is cast forth from the Nephesch, yet preserving a link withit, it goes down into the Qlippoth, and in this connection it is well to observe what mayreally be Evil on this Earth plane, may be even as a God among the Demons.The words \"He descended into Hell\", have such a significance. This Third Point thenrepresents the attainment of the Divine; and the Second Adept proceeds to say;\" he thathave an ear let him hear what the Spirit says unto the Assemblies (i.e in Malkuth) and if theVoice of the Divine is found in Malkuth it must find its echo in the realms beneath.Then follows the Exaltation into the Neschamah of the Consciousness of the Chief Adept,whose voice seems as it were symbolically standing with his head in Atziluth, whence itreverberates through the Worlds sinking down below Malkuth into the dominion of Shellsand he says: \"For I know that my Redeemer Liveth\" (The Redeemer is He that bringsagain)\" and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth. I am the Way, The Truth andthe Life. No Man cometh unto the Father but by etc.\" This whole passage of the ChiefAdept is formed of a collection of utterances, which are, as it were, the speeches of theGreat Gods, which he can only hear when is still further exalted into Kether. \"I am the way,the Truth and the Life\", is the reflected Triad. No Man cometh unto the Father, but by me.Then the Neschamah speaks; down to \"I have entered into the Invisible\". Then it is as if theConsciousness went into the Genius, which says \"I am the Sun in his rising, I have passedthrough the hour of the Cloud and Night.\"Then follows: \"I am Amon the Concealed One, the Opener of the Day,\" like the Great Godin Atziluth: \"I am Osiris Onnofris, the Crucified One,\" who is perfected in the balance andRisen above all considerations that come from Maya, or illusion, and who only seeks theeternal life from above, and then, as if in a supreme moment \"I am the Lord of Life,triumphant over death, there is no part of me that is not of the Gods\", (That is the Voice ofKether.) This again is followed by a synthetical culmination, as if all the Divine Ones unitedin the utterance: \"I am the Preparer of the Pathway, the Rescuer unto the Light! Out of theDarkness let the Light arise!\"The Aspirant is prompted to say: \"Before I was blind but now I see,\" representing again theblindness to the Neschamah Consciousness and the passage into this. \"When the Chief Adept states that he is the Reconciler with the Ineffable he places himself here as473"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"the central Pillar of the Tree of Life which allows the Divine White Brilliance to descend. This isnow the final subtle manipulation, for the Chief Adept must now bring the vital subtle bodies of thePostulant up to the same level as that of the ceremony. With the Invocation of the Light the fusionof the two energy levels into one then begins. The rationale behind this is that each subtle body ofthe Postulant (up to the Higher Mental Body which the Chief Adept utilises in this ritual) now fusesat each level with that of the ritual.The next step is to place the Wands above his head and the ankhs to the heart centre whichgives a direct stimulation to the heart centre, but at the Astral level. It shows that this level can betapped again by the Postulant when he is a fully fledged Adept.The touches of the Wands to the base of the brain and the two temples were meant to showthat the obstructions of Daath are partly cleared away and knowledge from the Third Order(through Cholanah and Binah) now flows though the Second. It also shows the removal of theQlippothic influence from the body and Soul of the Postulant. Eventually all the Sephiroth asapplied to the body are stimulated.A question that people often asked is that if the Sephiroth points on the body are stimulatedwhat then about the Seven major chakras and how does it effect them? Well first of all along thepoints allocated to the Sephiroth are minor chakras and when they are stimulated they in fact alterthe major ones indirectly. Actually it is a safermethod than direct stimulation of the minorchakras. The use of the Ankhs however keep thisin check as a type grounding on the energy beingintroduced.Over the years I have read various authorstalk about the Golden Dawn and how oldfashioned it rituals were, yet this part of the ritualis extremely advanced because, it involveselectrical and magnetic changes in the body, fromthe direct stimulation of the wands and ankhs. Anew type of bio-magnetic field is tapped into andutilised.Once the stimulation of the Sephiroticcentres has been completed then the weapons arelaid out on the altar, with the Crook and Scourgeplaced on the Altar, right and left of the diagramof the Sword and Serpent. The Crook andScourge are placed in the same position of theTwo pillars of the Tree of Life and that is whatthey represent. The Full Divine White Brillianceformula is then given.Minutum MundumThe Chief Adept then describes the meaning of the Minutum Mundum diagram. The explanationsfor this diagram are self explanatory and need no further elaboration. I would however refer thereaders to the book 'Magical Tarot of the Golden Dawn' where full mixing methods are given foreach of the Four Trees of the Colour Scales.Crook and Scourge (refer to colour plates for diagram)The Colouring Attributions are given for the Crook (starting from the Top) and Scourge show thecolours for Kether, Air, Chokmah, Taurus, Chesed, Leo, Aries, Tiphareth, Capricorn and Hod. Forthe Scourge, starting at the tip of the flail, Water, Geburah, Cancer, Binah, Gemini, Tiphareth,Scorpio and Netzach. All of these colours come from the Diagram of the Minutum Mundum. Twomore diagrams are then explained, the 'Sword and the Serpent' (explained earlier in the text and themountain of Abiegnus (which has been elaborated in the Portal ritual). These two diagrams also474"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"CROOK AND SCOURGE AND COLOUR ASSOCIATIONS"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"represent another aspect of the colours placed on theTree of Life.The Vault ceiling needs no more elaboration thanis in the text. The names written in above are the namesof the Sephiroth.The Vault floor, also described, has a black backgroundwith white lettering and lines. The Serpent is Red, thecross Gold and the Rose red. There are also a series ofnames written on the diagram. On the lowest tip of thedownward pointing triangle is the name 1. Thaumiel; onthe upper left hand side is the name 2. Ghagiel, on theupper left hand corner is the name 3. Satariel. Theremaining seven names written in each corner, startingfrom the top point of the seven pointed star (goingcounter-clockwise) 4. Ghaahsheblah, 5.Golachab, 6.Thagirion, 7. Aarab Zaraq, 8. Samael, 9.Gamaliel, 10.Lilith - these are, of course, the Orders of the Olippoth.Vault WallsThe Top rank of each wall relates to the KerubicEmblems (in the Order of Tetragrammaton), with the'`Sign Spirit in the centre, which is always white with adark wheel upon it. You will note that the eagle replacesthe Sign of Scorpio here. The planetary symbols areplaced roughly in the order they are in when associatedto the Hexagram. The Hebrew letters of the Sephiroth-are placed in the position they occupy on the Tree of Life.-The Astrological Signs are arranged in their perpendicularcolumns of their Earth, Air, Water and Fiery Triplicity.The horizontal symbolism of the Signs (in order of-Tetragrammaton) -starting at the top rank (4th from thebottom) are in their fixed, Cardinal and Mutable positions.The Three Elements and the Three alchemical principles-are also given as well.Now as to the actual colouring of the Vault wallsthere are number of ways to do this, each temple had itsown scheme. The usual and simplistic method to do this isto colour out the Vault squares on paper, but associatethe colours of the Minutum Mundum to each relevantsquare. On the squares that are left the following basiccolours are associated:Kerubics (right to left) Red, Blue, Yellow and Black.These colours are not to duplicate those of the MinutumMundum and are to be considered somewhat darker than-those colours associated with the Elements on the Paths.The colours for the Three alchemical principles -Mercury,Salt and Sulphur are Yellow, Blue and Red. These are in a475"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"lighter colour than those of the Kerubics and theElemental associations to the Path. The Hebrew letteredsquares are in the colours of the Sephiroth of the QueenScale while the Planetray and Zodiac squares are in thecolours of the King Scale Paths. Now this gives you thecomplete basic colour plan to work with. The importantthing to remember is that no square should have anidentical colouring with another square. Each square ofthe same colour should be either darker or lighter in tintthan its counterpart.Now how you actually colour each wall is simplein theory (but difficult to do practically). If you want tocolour say the Venus Wall then select the colour green,taken from the square of the planet, from your basicdraught sheet, and colour each square with a mix of thatcolour. Taking the Venus square as an example. TheSymbol of Venus will be in its own green colour and thebackground in a complementary Red. You will note thataround each Hebrew letter there is a square, (except Mfor Malkuth which has no border and the letter ispainted in White), both the letter and the square borderare coloured in the compound mix of the Sephiroth andthe Green of Venus, the background will be thecomplementary colour. When the planetary compoundis mixed with the squares of the Planets, Signs, Kerubics and Elements, it is mixed with thebackground colour of the square with the respective symbol in the complementary Red. It would befair to say that each temple did not use identical methods of colouring. A comparison of copiesfrom the walls of Bristol and Whare Ra will bear this out. I know of another method where only thecolours of the King Scale (both Sephiroth and Paths) are, used as well.Cross of VictoryThe Cross of Victory is then shown to the Postulant and it is explained as the rose of fivetimes five petals representing the interchanging energies of Spirit and the Elements. In the publishedRegardie and Crowley versions of this cross only the back of the Cross is shown. The originalGolden Dawn (and later the Stella Matutina) used ablack carved crucifix, with Christ on the Cross, theColoured painted on the back of the cross in the formof a rose. I am told that in one Golden Dawn temple anantique black Florentine cross was utilised for thispurpose with later modifications of the rose being donein Venice. In one lecture it was described simply as`The figure of Christ surrounded by the Four Elementssymbolises the perfected Adept who has so balancedhis elemental nature that the Divine spirit can manifestin him.' .The form of Christ is important here for it is theinfluence that helps the Adept to change and gothrough the rebirth principle. We must also rememberthat any type of figure or symbol in the Vault istransformed and imbibed with power. The Cross ofVictory becomes a very powerful talismatic figure thathelps and enforces theAdept (mainly through the heart476"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"centre) and guides the the lower subtle body into some sort of reunification. By simply ignoring thefigure and using a Cross shows a lack of understanding of the precepts of the use of Christ in the5=6 ritual.The colour scheme of the Cross of Victory is derived from the colours of the Four elementsand spirit. The easiest method to work this out is to form a blank square of 25 cells.1.From the Upper left to the lower right diagonal, place the colours Red, Blue, White, Yellow andBlack.2.Take, Red, the first upper colour of the diagonal, and mix it with the next colour on the diagonal,blue, and you form purple.3.You then mix Red with the next colour, white, on the diagonal to form Pink.4.Mix Red with the next colour, Yellow, on the diagonal to form_Orange.5. Nix Red with the last colour on the diagonal, black, to form Russet. Now this gives you the Topsquares by Rank and the first row of squares by column (on the left hand side).By the same proceedure derive the next set of squares via column and rank only this time you startwith the second colour Blue by mixing it with the next colour white on the diagonal. Blue andWhite make Pale Blue, Blue and Yellow make green, Blue and Black make Indigo. The diagrambelow shows how the colours are formulated.Cell square of Colours.

But at the foot, that which the feet reston, as if they are exalted by it, is the Cross exalted on a pedestal of Three Steps, viz. theObligation Cross. This latter is also to an extent represented on the top in a crucified figure,and symbolises the Voluntary Sacrifice of the Lower Will, which is incidental to allying theintellect with the higher aspirations and to the establishment of your consciousness therein -If the ordinary consciousness were centred in the Ruach you could touch the Neschamah,while it is in the latter you could touch the Genius...\"On the Upper half of the Lid of the Pastos the lid is White.

The figure is pinkflesh colour while the Serpent is a combination of Red and black.I uncovered the following 'Notes on the Pastos' from Taylor with no indication of who wroteit, save the comment from Taylor that the paper was dated in the early 1890's:\" The outside length is 89.62 inches. The external width is 38.5 inches. The external width is38.5 inches. The depth is 34.42 inches. The Lids diagonal is 88.25 inches which relates tothe width of space from the Suns orbit was taken at. If the Suns orbit and that of Venus,. bedrawn on the Lid (with the Suns distance at a scale of 10) the orbit of Venus is thencontained in the Lids breadth -a direct empathy with the Vault door. The Contents of thePastos is 70,500 cubic inches - which is the Suns diameter in miles.\"The Postulant is now placed between the Lid and the Pastos. This is symbolic of what he was andwhat he has now become. The LVX Signs are given. The Pastos is replaced in the Vault, the Adeptiresuming their opening positions. The closing procedure then begins with the knocks to withdrawthe current and seal the entrance way of the Vault, which is then closed.THE SASH OF THE 5 = 6.The first mention of the Golden Dawn Grade sash for the 5=6 Grade was in a paper by WynWestcott in 1892. It was a White Sash with Gold trim. The numbers 5=6 were Red and in a Redcircle and square with a Red Rose Cross beneath it.By 1900, just prior to the Golden Dawn breakup, Mathers (from his Paris Temple - Ahathor)issued Crowley with a 5=6 sash that was markedly different. The sash was White with Red trim.The 5=6 numbers were in gold, as were the circle and square. The Rose Cross was Red. Beneath itwas a Red Hexagram with a Golden Sun in its centre. Below this were four red horizontal Lines,with the numbers 24, 25 and 26 placed between them, respectively. From this one can deduce thatMathers must have considered marking the paths of the Portal off in Red.At Whare Ra Temple this changed more than once as well. With a Red sash substituting forthe Portal's white one (with no insignia) and the 5=6 sash being white. Some had numbers on themand some did not, depending on the period one attained the inner Order rank. A Gold sash wasworn around the waist for 5=6, a Red one for 6=5 and a Blue one for 7=4. Most of this dated fromthe early 1940's and in the 1930's they were more strict. I must admit I have failed to uncover anydefinitive Whare Ra paper on the grade sashes other than a generalisation. Franldy though, I preferthe later Mathers version as I think it has more merit than the original Westcott arrangement.480"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The Cross of Victory(Front View)"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"ez) 4"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The original tablets of the Golden Dawn from Westcott's copy of 'H' Document.481"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Vision of the Angelic ChoirsThe first diagram of the Seraphimof Isaiah shows them as the guardians ofthe Seven Planets.
