It was a collection of Teachings on the Vault and combines a Flying Roll and several official documents under one cover. Wynn Westcott's August 1893 lecture, which is Flying Roll XVII, only forms a part of it. It is worthwhile noting that this version of the Flying Roll are identical to that used in the 1904, AO documents that were used in Berridge's London Temple, with the absense of some minor diagrams. It was for this reason that I did not think it worth duplicating when I came to write the book King over the Water with Melissa Seims. Flying Roll XVII appears to have been edited when it appeared in Israel Regardie's Golden Dawn. This version of the flying roll is at times clearer and others more clumsy. In my view however this version is superior if only because sentences where linked Regardie in such a way they meant something different. The date of the Book of the Tomb, 1921 suggests the period when JW Brodie-Innes was in charge of the Order along with Mina Mathers, after the latter had taken over Berridge's London temple (see King over the Water). Other papers in this book are clearly written by Brodie-Innes, The style is more modern, clearer and makes a reference to the Amon Ra temple vault which was Brodie-Innes's own temple. In laying out this book I have followed the style and language of the original. I have replaced the astrological fonts with words because this makes it easier for electronic sharing and conversion to HTML. Where I have commented it has been as an endnote. The pictures are from the original document.Nick FarrellRome 2009"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Copied by     Frater Vincit qui Patitur5=6(4/9/1921)Recopied and Annotated Nick Farrell (24/5/2009)_____________________________________________________BOOK OF THE TOMBExtracts from SA's Flying Roll No XVIIGrade NAM5=6"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The Symbolism of the Seven Sides of the Vault of C.R ________There are many even in this Grade which is alone been gained by serious study, who after being charmed and instructed by the first view of the Vault of C.R. have made no attempt to study it as a new theme.There are many who have attended many ceremonial admissions, and yet know nothing of the symbolism of the 7 sides and nothing of the emblematic arrangement of the 40 squares upon each side.Some of you have not even known that Venus is in an astrological sense misplaced among the sides and not two in five have been able to explain why this is so or the basis of the arrangement of seven colours and forces.Many have told me which element among the four is missing, and others have known that Leo occurs twice; but very few can tell me why the eight forms of Leo, are in different colours in each case and only a few can tell me without hesitation which of the three Sephiroth have no planet attached. The seven sides are all alike in size and shape and subdivisions; and the 40 squares on each side bear the same symbols. But the colouring is varied in the extreme; and no two sides are alike in tint; and none of the squares are identical in colour, excepting the single central upper square of each wall. The seven walls are under the planetary presidency, one side to each planet; the subsidiary squares represent the colouring of the COMBINED FORCES OF THE PLANET AND THE SYMBOL OF EACH SQUARE; while the EMBLEM IS THE COLOUR CONTRASTED TO THAT OF THE GROUND COLOUR. Now these Planetary Sides are to be found in a special order, neither astronomic nor astrological. The common order of the succession of planets is that which is defined by their relative distance from the Sun. Putting Sun however in the earth's place in the series; Thus .Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon. Saturn is the furthest from the Sun and Mercury is the nearest with the Earth being between Mars and Venus.Beginning with Saturn in our case, the order is Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Mercury, Venus, Moon: here Mercury and Venus are transposed. But there is something more than this; for Saturn, being the planet the furthest off, is neither the door, nor the East, nor anywhere else that is obviously intended for it; i.e. the corner between the South and the South-West sides; nor is the Moon, at the other end of the scale, at any notable position on the old lines. There is then a new key to the order to be found and such who are intuitive can see it at a glance.The planets are in the ORDER OF THE RAINBOW COLOURS; and in colours because this Adeptus Grade is a special exponent of colour. You Adepti are in the Path of the Chameleon, HODOS CHAMELIONIS.Now, if you take the planetary colours, affix the planets, and arrange them in the order of the Solar Spectrum; then bend the series into a ring and make the chain into a heptagon and bend the whole lot about until you get the two ends to meet at the East, you will have this Mysterium.(1), Jupiter, Violet. (2) Saturn, Indigo. (3) Moon, Blue. (4) Venus, Green. (5) Mercury, Yellow. (6) Sun, Orange. (7) Mars, Red."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Modern Science teachers and reveals a great truth: that however valuable the seven colours of the prism may be, there are rays invisible (and so not demonstrable by space), beyond the red end of the spectrum and beyond the violet and that these have great chemic or Yetziratic force. These forces are present but are unseen and are represented by the Chief Adept standing at the Eastern Angle, the most powerful person in the group and the delegate of the Chiefs of the Second Order and through them of the Mystic Third Order. He it is who has symbolically, at any rate, passed from Death into Life and holds the Keys of all the Creeds. And he it is who may place in our hands the Keys of the locked Palace of the King if we are able to make our knocking heard.Representing the East, coming from the East, he faces the Western world, bringing Initiations with him. Before him lies the symbolic body of our Master C.R.C., our grand Exemplar and Founder, or at other times, the empty Pastos, from which he has arisen.The Chief Adept has Mars and Geburah at his right; and on his left hand he has Jupiter and Gedulah; and he faces Venus in the West, the Evening Star which represents the entry of the Candidate who has toiled all the day until the evening. At even he enters by the Western door of the planet Venus, that sole planet unto whose symbol all the Sephiroth are conformed.“At Evening Time there shall be light,” the Light of the mixed Colours; and the newly admitted Adept comes in contact with totality of the Planetary Forces for the first time. A great opportunity opens before him; but let him see well that he use it worthily. He enters through the Green side of the vault; Green is the colour of growth: let him see that he grow.Upon each side of the vault are 40 squares, five vertical series and eight horizontal, the whole being symbolically five foot x eight foot. The published and printed Fama Fraternatitas says this 40 square feet were divided into ten squares. If you are a mathematician you would know that ten similar squares could not ALONE be placed in such an area and yet fill it. Ten squares alone to form a rectangle could only be placed in an area of the shape five by two. Hence in the Fama Fraternatitas “ten squares” is a blind which we know to represent “TEN SQUARES ARE MARKED AND SALIENT” (See the 5=6 Ritual). They are the Sephiroth. SEPHIROTH =10; CHERUBIM=4; PRINCIPLES=3; ELEMENTS=3; PLANETS=7; ZODIACAL SIGNS=12; WHEEL OF SPIRIT = 1/ Total = 40 Squares.The Spirit wheel is on every side and always in the central upper square and is always depicted unchanged in Black upon White.Upon the sides thereof are always the four CHERUBIC EMBLEMS Zodiacal and yet different, for the Eagle replaces Scorpio. SCORPIO has three forms: (1) Scorpio (The zodiacal sign), (2) The Eagle (the Eagle sign for its best aspect; and (3) The Snake for the Evil. These Cherubim represent the letters of the name.NOTE. They are always arranged in that order, the Hebrew order of the letters Yod, Leo; Heh, Eagle; Vav, Aquarius; Heh (final), Taurus. It is convenient to distinguish he Heh final by dotting it.Note that the four Zodiacal signs as Cherubic Emblems are not in their own colours, but as symbols of the elements have elementary colours. As Zodiacal signs, then, they are found to be compounds of the zodiacal and planet colours. When these four signs are repeated below as Zodiacal Signs then they are found to be compounds of the Zodiacal Sign colour and the Planetary colour; but here they are compounds of the Element colour and Planet colour.The THREE PRINCIPLES are composed of the colour of the Principle, and the colour of the Planet. Salt being fundamentally blue, Sulphur red, and Mercury yellow.The THREE ELEMENTS have fundamentally the usual three colours, Fire red, Water blue, Air yellow. Note that Earth is missing.The SEVEN PLANETS and their colours are often stated; and note that each of the seven is set beside its appropriate Sephira, so that there are three Sephira which have no Planet: They are Kether, Chokmah, and Malkuth.The 12 ZODIACAL SIGNS close the lower portion of the sides of the five vertical columns. The central one has none of the twelve. They are allotted between the four remaining columns. Note further that they are only three ranks, the 5th, 7th, and 8th; none are in the 6th rank.This arrangement then shows: Four Triplicities and three Quaternaries.

The ground colour is a compound of the colour of the Planet and the colour of the Force to which the square is allotted. Each side has the square of its own Planet in its own colour; and this exception all the coloured grounds are compound. The Emblem colour is always complementary to the ground colour.of the side tinting the colour of the Force to which the Square is allotted.The 5=6 ritual gives the colours of each planet and sign which are to be used in this system. There are other allotments of colour to each of these symbols and forces, in other scales, as those of the QUEEN; and the CHILDREN OF THE FORCES; but they are still retained as mysteries yet to be evolved and revealed when you have become familiar with the present elementary system.“NOM”"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"CUBICAL ALTAR OF THE 0=0 CEREMONY"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"THE TOMBThe TOMB is a small seven sided chamber with a black floor and white ceiling.The PASTOS lies with its head to the East; and over it is a Circular Altar.The plan shows their position. The Altar bears the symbols of the four elements, a red, yellow, black and b lue disc, surrounded by a white circle. On the red disc is a green lion; on the yellow is a purple Cherub, or a Man's head. On he blue is a bronze or orange coloured eagle; on the black, a white Ox.These discs surround the letter Shin which is in white in the centre, exactly under the white rose in the middle of the ceiling. Near this Shin stands a small crucifix. The carved ivory figure is of antique Florentine workmanship; and the craved Rose of 25 petals behind the head was made for this purpose in Venice.The colours represent the interchanging energies of the Spirit and the Elements. The figure of Christ surrounded by the four elements symbolises the perfect Adept who has so balanced his elemental nature that the Divine Spirit can manifest in him.The cup, dagger, chain and the burning lap, each standing on its own element simply repeat the same symbolism. It should be observed that the four elements are placed according to the Zodiac; that is to say the fire, Leo = Aries is to the East, Air, Aquarius= Libra to the West; Water, Scorpio = Cancer to the North; Earth, Taurus = Capricorn to the South.This is the direction of the Enochian Tablets to the Elements and points to that in which the Adept should look when he wishes to visit the elemental realms or Astral regions. For a planet it is better to find the actual position from an Ephemeris in actual work. Sitting in the tomb it is sufficient to astrally rise through the white ceiling with the correct names and symbols, vibrating the former while doing so.The Cubical Alter in an Outer Temple, or one arranged by an Adept, bears the four Implements and the four elements in a different Order (See Page Nine). This is according to the Winds:Incense (or Rose) and Dagger, Air, to the East;Wateri in Cup, water, to the West;Salt and Pentacle to the North;Lamp and Fire Wand to the SouthThe Red Cross and the White Triangle in the Middle Place of the Shin.In the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram the Archangels are arranged in this position of the Elements on the Cubical Altar. “Before me RAPHAEL” is said Facing the East; and he is the Archangels of Air. “Behind me Gabriel”, is the Archangel of Water in the West.This arrangement is used in the invocation of any force in a temple or ordinary room. The Hierophant follows this rule in his invocations of the Elemental Spirits in the Outer Ceremonies.For the consectration of a TALISMAN, the Apet must look towards the East if he wishes to invoke the power of AIR, though if he wishes to visit those regions symbolised by the Vayu TATWA, or the Air Tablet, he must astrally fly westward.This information is given in the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram but in so confused form that it is difficult to comprehend it clearly.ii The separate clairvoyant study of the four circles on the Tomb Altar is extremely interesting; by it the forrses of the elements on the active side can be observed symbolically and contrasted wit the same on the passive side, as seen in the simple Tatwas.Instead of holding a paper symbol the Adept can sit in the Tomb and feel himself pass through the selected disc, having first invoked the Divine Names and used a suitable Pentagram.By simply using the pentagram and vibrating the Divine Name allotted to it, the blackness of the atmosphere of the Tomb can become so charged with the astral colour of the Element that it seems"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"visible to the material eyesight.It is necessary to balance the people sitting in the Tomb. The most practised could take the place at the head of the Pastos with the beginners on either side; but when only two are working together they should sit opposite each other at the sides or at the head and foot of the Pastos.The Lotus Wand should be held by the White portion when SPIRIT is being invoked.When an Element is chosen a suitable coloured band should be selected. After some practice it is not difficult to find the correct band in the darkiii. ; at first it is better to hold it before extinguishing the light. Even when first sitting in the Tomb, strange blueish balls of light like phoshorus will be seen by natural clairvoyants: these are not to be confused with the ordinary daylight remaining in our eyes when we go into a dark room.The SPIRIT square on each side has the same outward appearance; but when studied clairvoyantly each will be found to have characteristics in harmony with the planet. The ZODIACAL squares are much better explored when the actual planet of that particular side is in the Sign. Such as in the part of the August Sun is in Leo; then choose the Leo Zodiacal square on the Solar Side or any other planet in the same manner.Those who are not familiar with pigments should be careful to examine the colour of the square that they are about to study and also the contracting colour of the symbol thereon. It is important that they should be clearly impressed on the mind before the Tomb is darkened.THE PASTOSThe pastos which stands under the altar has no bottom, but a hinged lid which can be turned back during the second point of the 5=6 ceremony.The designs are shown in the diagrams.The inner surface bears the “Colours of the Children of the Forces”.Both the inner and outer of the right side are in the positive scale of the colour.The head is white, inside and out.Outside it bears the Red Rose of 49 petals on a Golden Greek Cross.

A careful study of the following diagrams will show the result of these mixtures.There is some difficult for those not used to pigments in comprehending the reason for the particular colours used on the sides of the Tomb. To make this clear, the seven solar squares have been selected as examples. In addition to this there are added the two squares from the Venus side bearing the symbol of Aquarius.The first is that in the Cherubic Rank Air, Vav = yellow.

If not perfectly done the result is dull and unluminous and even pigments orginally perfect change with time. Another method, and that used in the Amen Ra Vault, is to form the symbol in its own colour, placed on the square of its own colour, the Planet on its own side being expressed in its own colour. Thus the Venus symbol on the does side is red on a green ground. These colours are made in coloured papers which if accurate are more brilliant than pigments.vSUN SQUARE ON SUN SIDE OF THE TOMBOrange Ground Unmixed Blue, its Complementary unmixed"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"SUN SQUARE ON THE MERCURY SIDE Orange Ground Yellow Mercury ColourBlue ComplementaryPurple ComplementarySUN SQUARE ON THE VENUS SIDEOrange Ground Green Venus GroundBlue Complementary Red Venus Complementary"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"SUN SQUARE ON MOON SIDEOrange GroundBlue Moon ColourBlue ComplementaryOrange Complementary of MoonSUN SQUARE ON SATURN SIDEOrange Ground Black Saturn Colour Blue ComplementaryAmber Saturn ComplementarySUN SQUARE ON THE JUPITER SIDEOrange Ground Purple Jupiter GroundBlue ComplementaryYellow Complementary of Jupiter"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"SUN SQUARE ON THE MARS SIDEOrange Ground Red Mars Ground Blue Complementary Green Mars ComplementaryThese squares are to be placed in their order around the Tomb but commencing with the Sun side to show the simplest first.The square on the Cherubic Rank, Venus Side, bearing the Aquarius symbol means the Vav in Yod, Heh, Vav, Heh; it's colour naturally is yellow charged with purple.

Mars is the complementary of Venus, green, Sun, Orange is the complementary of the Moon, blue; but as there are seven Planets the exact complementary colour of each one cannot always be expressed by that of another planet. Hence Saturn and the Sun, indigo and purple both have yellow for complementary, yet Mercury is not exact for both of them. A careful study of the Zodiacal colours settles the question. Capricorn indigo is that of Saturn. Capricorn is opposite of Cancer, amber, so amber is the complementary of Indigo. Aquarius purple is the Jupiter colour. Leo is the opposite of Aquarius so the complement of purple is greenish yellow. The Mercury yellow is not always found in the Zodiac; this colour is the complement of a clear purple amethyst, neither bluish nor reddish.The “flash” of light from carefully balanced complementary colours is a matter of optics. It is the shining from blended rays, making a whiteness which in pigments would be blackness. It is a sign that the talisman bears the correct colours, nothing occult. It is often seen on effective advertisments and is quite different from the astral flash or brilliance which shows when a talisman is powerfully charged with the desired force.HEAD OF THE PASTOS (Inner surface) Black Tree on a White GroundKETHERWhiteCHOKMAHLight BlueBINAHRose CHESEDBluish PurpleGEBURAHRed OrangeTIPHARETHPinkNETZACH YellowHODPurpleYESODBlue IndigoMALKUTHYellow (lighter than Netzach"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"FOOT OF THE PASTOS (Inner surface) Black Tree on a White GroundKETHERWhiteCHOKMAHPearly GreyBINAHLight Russet CHESEDLight VioletGEBURAHOrange ScarletTIPHARETHLight OrangeNETZACH Pale GreenHODYellow-BrownYESODPurplish GreyMALKUTHOrdinary colours (mixed with Black covered with yellow spots)4/9/1921"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"iThe 0=0 ritual it should be wine and most water cups are kept empty in the modern Golden Dawn Groups.iiConfused in the same way as it means “not mentioned at all”. It is not clear what the author is referring to here.iiiThis is the second time that a mention has been made of darkness in the vault. Since the reference assumes that people are sitting around the pastos it means that in Amon Ra at least there was no light in the Vault. This strikes me as extremely strange as the Fama specifically mentions that the Vault had a light which was never extinguished inside it. It also means that the only way that colour could be appreciated in the Vault is that moment when the the officers first enters the temple. While it may be possible that Amon-Ra did not wire up a basic lamp for its vault, or relied only on the candle on the altar, Innes later talks about extinguishing all light in the Vault. On the whole however I feel that this is a bad symbol. The Vault represents our own spiritual self at the centre of the Universe. It should not be left in darkness.ivBrodie-InnesvThis is the lazy person's method of creating a vault quickly using flashing colours. The result lacks the aesthetics of a properly constructed vault and can make someone feel quite unwell. This might explain why Brodie-Innes was so keen on turning the light in his vault off. Fortunately his advice was not taken in London, France or in the Stella Matutina."}]
