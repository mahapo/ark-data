However he did not include any . documents on the administrative structure behind the Golden Dawn. From the inception of the Golden Dawn in 1888Willlam Wynn Westcott developed not only a complete ceremoni\\il structure upo~ which the Golden Dawn was built,but also the Rules of Order. The Grade Ceremonies and Kn:owl~dge .Lectures were d~veloped from the outlines in the Cipher Manuscript, but theadministmtive structure was left fo~ Westcott to create. ' , The Golden Dawn's structure or. Rules of Order were based upon Masonry and their concordant bodies, organizationat forms familiar to Westcott. The Rules 6f Order were designed to facilitate the smooth operation of the Order and they were amended by the Three Chiefs and subscribing mernbers of the Secorid Order as th,e Golden Dawn went through schisms and growing pains. MariyOccult groups of the past and presetittend to neglect the rules of conduct within th~ir own system~Without irtternaladminisrrative structUre, any large working groJlP is doom'ed to splinter and dissolve. The challenge is always to develop a structure that isn~ither too rigid to allow for growth,·o(so flexible that members develop their own .rndividual agendas and lose sight of the intent df the group as a whole ..
