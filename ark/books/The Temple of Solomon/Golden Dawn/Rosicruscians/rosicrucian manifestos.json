Now I do not think that there can be found any onewho would not wish and desire with all his heart to be a Partaker of thisnoble Treasure; but seeing the same Felicity can happen to none, exceptGod himself give Wisdom, and send his holy Spirit from above, we havetherefore set forth in print this little Treatise, to wit, Famam & Confes-sionem, of the Laudable Fraternity of the Rosie Cross, to be read by everyone, because in them is clearly shewn and discovered, what concerning itthe World hath to expect.Although these things may seem somewhat strange, and many mayesteem it to be but a Philosophical shew, and no true History, which ispublished and spoken of the Fraternity of the Rosie Cross; it shall here suf-ficiently appear by our Confession, that there is more in recessu then may beimagined; and it shall be easily understood, and observed by every one (if"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"2he be not altogether voyd of understanding) what now adays, and at thesetimes, is meant thereby.Those who are true Disciples of Wisdom, and true Followers of theSpherical Art, will consider better of these things, and have them in greaterestimation, as also judge far otherwise of them, as hath been done by someprincipal Persons, but especially of Adam Haselmeyer, Notarius Publicus tothe Arch Duke Maximilian, who likewise hath made an Extract ex scriptisTheologicis Theophrasti, and written a Treatise under the Title of Jesuiter,wherein he willeth, that every Christian should be a true Jesuit, that is, towalk, live, be, and remain in Jesus: He was but ill rewarded of the Jesuits,because in his answer written upon the Famam, he did name those of theFraternity of the Rosie Cross, The highly illuminated men, and undeceiv-ing Jesuits; for they not able to brook this, layd hands on him, and put himinto the Galleis, for which they likewise have to expect their reward.Blessed Aurora will now henceforth begin to appear, who (after thepassing away of the dark Night of Saturn) with her Brightness altogetherextinguisheth the shining of the Moon, or the small Sparks of HeavenlyWisdom, which yet remaineth with men, and is a Forerunner of pleasantPhebus, who with his clear and fiery glistering Beams brings forth thatblessed Day, long wished for, of many true-hearted; by which Day-lightthen shall truly be known, and shall be seen all heavenly Treasures of godlyWisdom, as also the Secrets of all hidden and unvisible things in the World,according to the Doctrine of our Forefathers, and ancient Wisemen.This will be the right kingly Ruby, and most excellent shining Carbun-cle, of the which it is said, That he doth shine and give light in darkness,and to be a perfect Medicine of all imperfect Bodies, and to change theminto the best Gold, and to cure all Diseases of Men, easing them of all painsand miseries.Be therefore, gentle Reader, admonished, that with me you do earnestlypray to God, that it please him to open the hearts and ears of all ill hearingpeople, and to grant unto them his blessing, that they may be able to knowhim in his Omnipotency, with admiring contemplation of Nature, to hishonour and praise, and to the love, help, comfort and strengthening of ourNeighbors, and to the restoring of all the diseased."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"3Fama Fraternitatis,or,A Discovery of the Fraternity of the most laudable Order of the Rosy Cross.Seeing the only Wise and Merciful God in these latter days hath poured outso richly his mercy and goodness to Mankind, whereby we do attain moreand more to the perfect knowledge of his Son Jesus Christ and Nature, thatjustly we may boast of the happy time, wherein there is not only discoveredunto us the half part of the World, which was heretofore unknown & hid-den, but he hath also made manifest unto us many wonderful, and never-heretofore seen, Works and Creatures of Nature, and moreover hath raisedmen, indued with great Wisdom, which might partly renew and reduce allArts (in this our Age spotted and imperfect) to perfection; so that finallyMan might thereby understand his own Nobleness and Worth, and why heis called Microcosmus, and how far his knowledge extendeth in Nature.Although the rude World herewith will be but little pleased, but rathersmile and scoff thereat; also the Pride and Covetousness of the Learned is sogreat, it will not suffer them to agree together; but were they united, theymight out of all those things which in this our Age God doth so richlybestow upon us, collect Librum Naturae, or a perfect Method of all Arts: butsuch is their opposition, that they still keep, and are loth to leave the oldcourse, esteeming Porphiry, Aristotle, and Galen, yea and that which hathbut a meer shew of learning, more then the clear and manifested Light andTruth; who if they were now living, with much joy would leave their erro-neous Doctrines. But here is too great weaknesses for such a great Work:And although in Theologie, Physic, and the Mathematic, the Truth dothoppose it self; nevertheless the old Enemy by his subtilty and craft dothshew himself in hindering every good purpose by his Instruments and con-tentious wavering people. To such an intent of a general Reformation, themost godly and highly illuminated Father, our Brother, C.R. a German,the chief and original of our Fraternity, hath much and long time laboured,who by reason of his poverty (although descended of Noble Parents) in thefifth year of his age was placed in a Cloyster, where he had learned indiffer-ently the Greek and Latin Tongues, who (upon his earnest desire andrequest) being yet in his growing years, was associated to a Brother, P.A.L.who had determined to go to the Holy Land."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"4Although this Brother dyed in Ciprus, and so never came to Jerusalem,yet our Brother C.R. did not return, but shipped himself over, and went toDamasco, minding from thence to go to Jerusalem; but by reason of thefeebleness of his body he remained still there, and by his skill in Physick heobtained much favour with the Turks: In the mean time he became bychance acquainted with the Wise men of Damasco in Arabia, and beheldwhat great Wonders they wrought, and how Nature was discovered untothem; hereby was that high and noble Spirit of Brother C.R. so stired up,that Jerusalem was not so much now in his mind as Damasco; also he couldnot bridle his desires any longer, but made a bargain with the Arabians, thatthey should carry him for a certain sum of money to Damasco; he was butof the age of sixteen years when he came thither, yet of a strong Dutchconstitution; there the Wise received him (as he himself witnessseth) not asa stranger, but as one whom they had long expected, they called him by hisname, and shewed him other secrets out of his Cloyster, whereat he couldnot but mightily wonder: He learned there better the Arabian Tongue; sothat the year following he translated the Book M. into good Latin, whichhe afterwards brought with him. This is the place where he did learn hisPhysick, and his Mathematicks, whereof the World hath just cause torejoyce, if there were more Love, and less Envy. After three years hereturned again with good consent, shipped himself over Sinus Arabicus intoEgypt, where he remained not long, but only took better notice there ofthe Plants and Creatures; he sailed over the whole Mediterranean Sea for tocome unto Fez, where the Arabians had directed him. And it is a greatshame unto us, that wise men, so far remote th’one from th’other, shouldnot only be of one opinion, hating all contentious Writings, but also be sowilling and ready under the seal of secrecy to impart their secrets to others.Every year the Arabians and Affricans do send one to another, inquiringone of another out of their Arts, if happily they had found out some betterthings, or if Experience had weakened their Reasons. Yearly there camesomething to light, whereby the Mathematica, Physic and Magic (for inthose are they of Fez most skilful) were amended; as there is now adays inGermany no want of learned Men, Magicians, Cabalists, Physicians, andPhilosophers, were there but more love and kindness among them, or thatthe most part of them would not keep their secrets close only to them-selves. At Fez he did get acquaintance with those which are commonlycalled the Elementary Inhabitants, who revealed unto him many of theirsecrets: As we Germans likewise might gather together many things, if therewere the like unity, and desire of searching out of secrets amongst us."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"5Of these of Fez he often did confess, that their Magia was not altogetherpure, and also that their Cabala was defiled with their Religion; but not-withstanding he knew how to make good use of the same, and found stillmore better grounds of his Faith, altogether agreeable with the Harmony ofthe whole World, and wonderfully impressed in all Periods of times, andthence proceedeth that fair Concord, that as in every several kernel is con-tained a whole good tree or fruit, so likewise is included in the little bodyof Man the whole great World, whose Religion, policy, health, members,nature, language, words and works, are agreeing, sympathizing, and inequal tune and melody with God, Heaven and Earth; and that which is dis-agreeing with them, is error, falsehood and of the Devil, who alone is thefirst, middle, and last cause of strife, blindness, and darkness in the World:Also, might one examine all and several persons upon the Earth, he shouldfind that which is good and right, is always agreeing with it self; but all therest is spotted with a thousand erroneous conceits.After two years Brother R.C. departed the City Fez, and sailed withmany costly things into Spain, hoping well, he himself had so well and soprofitably spent his time in his travel, that the learned in Europe wouldhighly rejoyce with him, and begin to rule, and order all their Studies,according to those sound and sure Foundations. He therefore conferredwith the Learned in Spain, shewing unto them the Errors of our Arts, andhow they might be corrected, and from whence they should gather the trueInditia of the Times to come, and wherein they ought to agree with thosethings that are past; also how the faults of the Church and the whole Philos-opia Moralis was to be amended: He shewed them new Growths, newFruits, and Beasts, which did concord with old Philosophy, and prescribedthem new Axiomata, whereby all things might fully be restored: But it wasto them a laughing matter; and being a new thing unto them, they fearedthat their great Name should be lessened, if they should now again begin tolearn and acknowledg their many years Errors, to which they were accus-tomed, and wherewith they had gained them enough: Who so lovethunquietness, let him be reformed.The same Song was also sang to him by other Nations, the which movedhim the more (because it happened to him contrary to his expectation,)being then ready bountifully to impart all his Arts and Secrets to theLearned, if they would have but undertaken to write the true and infallibleAxiomata, out of all Faculties, Sciences and Arts, and whole Nature, as thatwhich he knew would direct them, like a Globe, or Circle, to the onelymiddle Point, and Centrum, and (as it is usual among the Arabians) it"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"6should onely serve to the wise and learned for a Rule, that also there mightbe a Society in Europe, which might have Gold, Silver, and preciousStones, sufficient for to bestow them on Kings, for their necessary uses, andlawful purposes: with which such as be Governors might be brought up, forto learn all that which God hath suffered Man to know, and thereby to beenabled in all times of need to give their counsel unto those that seek it,like the Heathen Oracles: Verily we must confess that the world in thosedays was already big with those great Commotions, laboring to be deliveredof them; and did bring forth painful, worthy men, who brake with all forcethrough Darkness and Barbarism, and left us who succeeded to followthem: and assuredly they have been the uppermost point in Trygono igneo,whose flame now should be more and more brighter, and shall undoubt-edly give to the World the last Light.Such a one likewise hath Theophrastus been in Vocation and Callings,although he was none of our Fraternity, yet nevertheless hath he diligentlyread over the Book M: whereby his sharp ingenium was exalted; but thisman was also hindered in his course by the multitude of the learned andwise-seeming men, that he was never able peaceably to confer with othersof his Knowledg and Understanding he had of Nature. And therefore in hiswriting he rather mocked these busie bodies, and doth not shew them alto-gether what he was: yet nevertheless there is found with him well groundedthe aforenamed Harmonia, which without doubt he had imparted to theLearned, if he had not found them rather worthy of subtil vexation, then tobe instructed in greater Arts and Sciences; he then with a free and carelesslife lost his time, and left unto the World their foolish pleasures.But that we do not forget our loving Father, Brother C.R. he after manypainful Travels, and his fruitless true Instructions, returned again into Ger-many, the which he (by reason of the alterations which were shortly tocome, and of the strange and dangerous contentions) heartily loved: There,although he could have bragged with his Art, but specially of the transmu-tations of Metals; yet did he esteem more Heaven, and the Citizens thereof,Man, then all vain glory and pomp.Nevertheless he builded a fitting and neat inhabitation, in the which heruminated his Voyage, and Philosophy, and reduced them together in a trueMemorial. In this house he spent a great time in the Mathematicks, andmade many fine Instruments, ex omnibus hujus artis partibus, whereof there isbut little remaining to us, as hereafter you shall understand. After five yearscame again into his mind the wished for Reformation; and in regard he"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"7doubted of the ayd and help of others, although he himself was painful,lusty, and unwearisom, he undertook, with some few adjoyned with him,to attempt the same: wherefore he desired to that end, to have out of hisfirst Cloyster (to the which he bare a great affection) three of his Brethren,Brother G.V. Brother J.A. and Brother J.O. who besides that, they had somemore knowledg in the Arts, then at that time many others had, he didbinde those three unto himself, to be faithful, diligent, and secret; as also tocommit carefully to writing, all that which he should direct and instructthem in, to the end that those which were to come, and through especialRevelation should be received into this Fraternity, might not be deceived ofthe least sillable and word.After this manner began the Fraternity of the Rosie Cross; first, by fourpersons onely, and by them was made the Magical Language and writing,with a large Dictionary, which we yet dayly use to Gods praise and glory,and do finde great wisdom therein; they made also the first part of theBook M: but in respect that the labor was too heavy, and the unspeakableconcourse of the sick hindred them, and also whilst his new building (calledSancti spiritus) was now finished, they concluded to draw and receive yetothers more into their Fraternity; to this end was chosen brother R.C. hisdeceased fathers brothers son, brother B. a skilful Painter, G. and P.D. theirSecretary, all Germains except J.A. so in all they were eight in number, allbatchelors and of vowed virginity, by those was collected a book or volumnof all that which man can desire, wish, or hope for.Although we do now freely confess, that the World is much amendedwithin an hundred years, yet we are assured, that our Axiomata shallunmovably remain unto the Worlds End, and also the world in her highestand last Age shall not attain to see any thing else; for our Rota takes herbeginning from that day when God spake Fiat, and shall end when he shallspeak Pereat; yet Gods Clock striketh every minute, where ours scarcestriketh perfect hours. We also stedfastly beleeve, that if our Brethren andFathers had lived in this our present and clear light, they would moreroughly have handled the Pope, Mahomet, Scribes, Artists, and Sophisters,and had shewed themselves more helpful, not simply with sighs, and wish-ing of their end and consummation.When now these eight Brethren had disposed and ordered all things insuch manner, as there was not now need of any great labour, and also thatevery one was sufficiently instructed, and able perfectly to discourse ofsecret and manifest Philosophy, they would not remain any longer together,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"8but as in the beginning they had agreed, they separated themselves into sev-eral Countries, because that not only their Axiomata might in secret bemore profoundly examined by the learned, but that they themselves, if insome Country or other they observed anything, or perceived some Error,they might inform one another of it.Their agreement was this: First, That none of them should profess anyother thing, then to cure the sick, and that gratis. 2. None of the Posterityshould be constrained to wear one certain kind of habit, but therein to fol-low the custom of the Country. 3. That every year upon the day C. theyshould meet together at the house S. Spiritus, or to write the cause of hisabsence. 4. Every Brother should look out for a worthy person, who afterhis discease might succeed him. 5. The word C.R. should be their Seal,Mark, and Character. 6. The Fraternity should remain secret one hundredyears. These six Articles they bound themselves one to another to keep; andfive of the Brethren departed, only the Brethren B. and D. remained withthe Father Fra: R.C. a whole year; when these likewise departed, thenremained by him his Cousen and Brother J.O. so that he hath all the days ofhis life with him two of his Brethren. And although that as yet the Churchwas not cleansed, nevertheless we know that they did think of her, and withwhat longing desire they looked for: Every year they assembled togetherwith joy, and made a full resolution of that which they had done; theremust certainly have been great pleasure, to hear truly and without inventionrelated and rehearsed all the Wonders which God hath poured out here andthere through the World. Every one may hold it out for certain, that suchpersons as were sent, and joined together by God, and the Heavens, andchosen out of the wisest of men, as have lived in many Ages, did livetogether above all others in highest Unity, greatest Secrecy, and most kind-ness one towards another.After such a most laudable sort they did spend their lives; and althoughthey were free from all diseases and pain, yet notwithstanding they couldnot live and pass their time appointed of God. The first of this Fraternitywhich dyed, and that in England, was J.O. as Brother C. long before hadforetold him; he was very expert, and well learned in Cabala, as his Bookcalled H. witnesseth: In England he is much spoken of, and chiefly becausehe cured a young Earl of Norfolk of the Leprosie. They had concluded,that as much as possibly could be their burial place should be kept secret, asat this day it is not known unto us what is become of some of them, yetevery ones place was supplyed with a fit successor; but this we wil confesse"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"9publickly by these presents to the honour of God, That what secret soeverwe have learned out of the book M. (although before our eyes we beholdthe image and pattern of all the world) yet are there not shewn unto us ourmisfortunes, nor hour of death, the which only is known to God himself,who thereby would have us keep in a continual readiness; but hereof morein our Confession, where we do set down 37 Reasons wherefore we nowdo make known our Fraternity, and proffer such high Mysteries freely, andwithout constraint and reward: also we do promise more gold then boththe Indies bring to the King of Spain; for Europe is with child and willbring forth a strong child, who shall stand in need of a great godfathers gift.After the death of J.O. Brother R.C. rested not, but as soon as he could,called the rest together, (and as we suppose) then his grave was made;although hitherto we (who were the latest) did not know when our lovingfather R.C. died, and had no more but the bare names of the beginners,and all their successors to us; yet there came into our memory, a secret,which through dark and hidden words, and speeches of the 100 years,brother A. the successor of D. (who was of the last and second row and suc-cession), and had lived amongst many of us,) did impart unto us of the thirdrow and succession; otherwise we must confess, that after the death of thesaid A. none of us had in any manner known anything of Brother R.C. andof his first fellow-brethren, then that which was extant of them in ourPhilosophical Bibliotheca, amongst which our Axiomata was held for thechiefest Rota Mundi, for the most artificial, and Protheus the most profit-able. Likewise we do not certainly know if these of the second row havebeen of the like wisdom as the first, and if they were admitted to all things.It shall be declared hereafter to the gentle Reader, not onely what we haveheard of the burial of R.C. but also made manifest publickly by the fore-sight, sufferance and commandement of God, whom we most faithfullyobey, that if we shall be answered discreetly and Christian-like, we will notbe afraid to set forth publickly in Print, our names, and sirnames, ourmeetings, or any thing else that may be required at our hands.Now the true and fundamental relation of the finding out of the highilluminated man of God, Fra: C.R.C. is this; After that A. in Gallia Nar-bonensi was deceased, then suceeded in his place, our loving Brother N.N.this man after he had repaired unto us to take the solemn oath of fidelityand scerecy, he informed us bona fide, That A. had comforted him in tell-ing him, that this Fraternity should ere long not remain so hidden, butshould be to all the whole German Nation helpful, needful, and com-"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"10mendable; of the which he was not in any wise in his estate ashamed of.The year following after he had performed his School right, and wasminded now to travel, being for that purpose sufficiently provided withFortunatus purse, he thought (he being a good Architect) to alter some-thing of his building, and to make it more fit: in such renewing he lightedupon the memorial Table which was cast of brasse, and containeth all thenames of the brethren, with some few other things; this he would transferin another more fitting vault: for where or when Fra: R.C. died, or in whatcountry he was buried, was by our predecessors concealed and unknownunto us. In this Table stuck a great naile somewhat strong, so that when hewas with force drawn out, he took with him an indifferent big stone out ofthe thin wall, or plaistering of the hidden door, and so unlooked for uncov-ered the door; wherefore we did with joy and longing throw down the restof the wall, and cleared the door, upon which that was written in great let-ters, Post 120 annos patebo, with the year of the Lord under it: therefore wegave God thanks and let it rest that same night, because first we wouldoverlook our Rotam; but we refer our selves again to the confession, forwhat we here publish is done for the help of those that are worthy, but tothe unworthy (God willing) it will be small profit: For like as our door wasafter so many years wonderfully discovered, also there shall be opened adoor to Europe (when the wall is removed) which already doth begin toappear, and with great desire is expected of many.In the morning following we opened the door, and there appeared toour sight a Vault of seven sides and corners, every side five foot broad, andthe height of eight foot; Although the Sun never shined in this Vault, nev-ertheless it was enlightened with another sun, which had learned this fromthe Sun, and was situated in the upper part in the Center of the sieling; inthe midst, in stead of a Tomb-stone, was a round Altar covered over with aplate of brass, and thereon this engraven:A.C.

This Vault we parted inthree parts, the upper part or sieling, the wall or side, the ground or floor.Of the upper part you shall understand no more of it at this time, butthat it was divided according to the seven sides in the triangle, which was inthe bright center; but what therein is contained, you shall God willing (thatare desirous of our society) behold the same with your own eys; but everyside or wall is parted into ten squares, every one with their several figuresand sentences, as they are truly shewed, and set forth Concentratum here inour book.The bottom again is parted in the triangle, but because therein is dis-cribed the power and rule of the inferior Governors, we leave to manifestthe same, for fear of the abuse by the evil and ungodly world. But thosethat are provided and stored with the heavenly Antidote, they do withoutfear or hurt, tread on, and bruise the head of the old and evil serpent,which this our age is well fitted for: every side or wall had a door for achest, wherein there lay diverse things, especially all our books, which oth-erwise we had, besides the Vocabular of Theoph: Par.

All that same concurreth together, and make a Sphere orGlobe, whose total parts are equidistant from the Center, as hereof more atlarge and more plain shal be spoken of in Christianly Conference.But now concerning (and chiefly in this our age) the ungodly andaccursed Gold-making, which hath gotten so much the upper hand,whereby under colour of it, many runagates and roguish people do usegreat villanies, and cozen and abuse the credit, which is given them: yeanow adays men of discretion do hold the transmutation of Mettals to be thehighest point, and fastigium in Philosophy, this is all their intent, and desire,and that God would be most esteemed by them, and honored, which couldmake great store of Gold, and in abundance, the which with unpremeditateprayers, they hope to attain of the alknowing God, and searcher of allhearts: we therefore do by these presents publickly testifie, That the truePhilosophers are far of another minde, esteeming little the making of Gold,which is but a parergon; for besides that they have a thousand better things.And we say with our loving Father R.C.C. Phy: aureum nisi quantumaurum, for unto them the whole nature is detected: he doth not rejoyce,that he can make Gold, and that, as saith Christ, the devils are obedientunto him; but is glad that he seeth the Heavens open, and the Angels ofGod ascending and descending, and his name written in the book of life.Also we do testifie that under the name of Chymia many books and pic-tures are set forth in Contumeliam gloriae Dei, as we wil name them intheir due season, and wil give to the pure-hearted a Catalogue, or Register"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"15of them: And we pray all learned men to take heed of these kinde ofBooks; for the enemy never resteth, but soweth his weeds, til a stronger onedoth root it out.

It is the Lord Jehovah (who seeing theLord’s Sabbath is almost at hand, and hastened again, his period or coursebeing finished, to his first beginning) doth turn about the course of Nature;and what heretofore hath been sought with great pains, and daily labour, isnow manifested unto those who make small account, or scarcely once thinkupon it; but those which desire it, it is in a manner forced and thrust uponthem, that thereby the life of the godly may be eased of all their toil andlabour, and be no more subject to the storms of inconstant Fortune; but thewickedness of the ungodly thereby, with their due and deserved punish-ment, be augmented and multiplied. Although we cannot be by any suspected of the least heresy, or of anywicked beginning, or purpose against the worldly government, we do con-demn the East and the West (meaning the Pope and Mahomet) blasphemersagainst our Lord Jesus Christ, and offer and present with a good will to thechief head of the Roman Empire our prayers, secrets, and great treasures ofgold. Yet we have thought good, and fit for the learned’s sakes, to add some-what more to this, and make a better explanation if there be anything toodeep, hidden, and set down over dark in the Fama, or for certain reasonswere altogether omitted, and left out; hoping herewith the learned will bemore addicted unto us, and be made far more fit and willing for our pur-pose. Concerning the alteration and amendment of Philosophy, we have (asmuch as this present is needful) sufficiently declared, to wit, that the same isaltogether weak and faulty; yet we doubt not, although the most part falselydo allege that she (I know not how) is sound and strong, yet notwithstand-ing she fetches her last breath and is departing."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"20But as commonly, even in the same place or country where there brea-keth forth a new a unaccustomed disease, Nature also there discovereth amedicine against the same; so there doth appear for so manifold infirmitiesof Philosophy the right means, and unto our Patria sufficiently offered,whereby she may become sound again, which is now to be renewed andaltogether new. No other Philosophy we have, than that which is the head and sum, thefoundations and contents of all faculties, sciences, and arts, the which (if wewill behold our age) containeth much of Theology and medicine, but littleof the wisdom of the law, and doth diligently search both heaven and earth:or, to speak briefly thereof, which doth manifest and declare sufficientlyMan, whereof all learned who will make themselves known unto us, andcome into our brotherhood, shall find more wonderful secrets by us thanheretofore they did attain unto, and did know, or are able to believe orutter. Wherefore, to declare briefly our meaning hereof, we ought to labourcarefully that there be not only a wondering at our meeting and adhorta-tion, but that likewise everyone may know, that although we do not lightlyesteem and regard such mysteries and secrets, we nevertheless holde it fit,that the knowledge thereof be manifested and revealed to many. For it is to be taught and believed, that this our unhoped (for), willingoffer will raise many and divers thoughts in men, unto whom (as yet) beunknown Miranda sexta aetatis, or those which by reason of the course ofthe world, esteem the things to come like unto the present, and are hin-dered through all manner of importunities of this our time, so that they liveno otherwise in the world, than blind fools, who can, in the clear sun-shineday discern and know nothing, than only by feeling. Now concerning the first part, we hold this, that the meditations,knowledge and inventions of our loving Christian Father (of all that, whichfrom the beginning of the world, Man’s wisdom, either through God’s rev-elation, or through the service of the angels and spirits, or through thesharpness and depth of understanding, or through long observation, use,and experience, hath found out, invented, brought forth, corrected, and tillnow hath been propagated and transplanted) are so excellent, worthy andgreat, that if all books should perish, and by God’s almighty sufferance, allwritings and all learnings should be lost, yet the posterity will be able onlythereby to lay a new foundation, and bring truth to light again; the whichperhaps would not be so hard to do as if one should begin to pull down and"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"21destroy the old ruinous building, and then to enlarge the fore court, after-wards bring lights into the lodgings, and then change the doors, stair, andother things according to our intention. But to whom would not this be acceptable, for to be manifested toeveryone rather that to have it kept and spared, as an especial ornament forthe appointed time to come? Wherefore should we not with all our hearts rest and remain in the onlytruth (which men through so many erroneous and crooked ways do seek) ifit had only pleased God to lighten unto us the sixth Candelbrium? Were itnot good that we needed not to care, not to fear hunger, poverty, sicknessand age? Were it not a precious thing, that you could always live so, as if you hadlived from the beginning of the world, and, moreover, as you should stilllive to the end thereof? Were it not excellent you dwell in one place, thatneither the people which dwell beyond the River Ganges in the Indiescould Hide anything, nor those which in Peru might be able to keep secrettheir counsels from thee? Were it not a precious thing, that you could so read in one only book,and withal by reading understand and remember, all that which in all otherbooks (which heretofore have been, and are now, and hereafter shall comeout) hath been, is, and shall be learned and found out of them? How pleasant were it, that you could so sing, that instead of stony rocksyou could draw the pearls and precious stones, instead of wild beasts, spirits,and instead of hellish Pluto, move the might princes of the world. O ye people, God’s counsel is far otherwise, who hath concluded now toincrease and enlarge the number of our Fraternity, the which we with suchjoy have undertaken, as we have heretofore obtained this great treasurewithout our merits, yea without our hopes, and thoughts, and purposewith the like fidelity to put the same in practice, that neither the compas-sion nor pity of our own children (which some of us in the Fraternity have)shall draw us from it, because we know these unhoped for goods cannot beinherited, nor by chance be obtained. If there be somebody now, which on the other side will complain of ourdiscretion, that we offer our treasure so freely, and without any difference toall men, and do not rather regard and respect more the godly, learned, wise,or princely persons, than the common people; those we do not contradict,seeing it is not a slight and easy matter; but withal we signify so much, thatour Arcana or secrets will no ways be common, and generally made"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"22known. Although the Fama be set forth in five languages, and is manifestedto everyone, yet we do partly very well know that the unlearned and grosswits will not receive nor regard the same; as also the worthiness of thosewho shall be accepted into our Fraternity are not esteemed and known ofus by Man’s carefulness, but by the Rule of our Revelation and Manifesta-tion. Wherefore if the unworthy cry and call a thousand times, or if theyshall offer and present themselves to us a thousand times, yet God hathcommanded our ears, that they should hear none of them: yea God hath socompassed us about with his clouds, that unto us his servants no violence orforce can be done or committed; wherefore we neither can be seen orknown by anybody, except he had the eyes of an eagle. It hath been neces-sary that the Fama be set forth in everyone’s mother tongue, because thoseshould not be defrauded of the knowledge thereof, whom (although theybe unlearned) God hath not excluded from the happiness of this Fraternity,the which shall be divided and parted into certain degrees; as those whichdwell in the city of Damascus in Arabia, who have a far different politickorder from the other Arabians. For there do govern only wise and under-standing men, who by the king’s permission make particular laws; accord-ing unto which example also the government shall be instituted in Europe(whereof we have a description set down by our Christianly Father) whenfirst is done and come to pass that which is to precede. And thenceforthour Trumpet shall publicly sound with a loud sound, and great noise, whennamely the same (which at this present is shown by few, and is secretly, as athing to come, declared in figures and pictures) shall be free and publiclyproclaimed, and the whole world shall be filled withal. Even in such man-ner as heretofore, many godly people have secretly and altogether desper-ately pushed at the Pope’s tyranny, which afterwards, with great, earnest,and especial zeal in Germany, was thrown from his seat, and trodden under-foot, whose final fall is delayed, and kept for our times, when he also shallbe scratched in pieces with nails, and an end be made of his ass’s cry, by anew voice. The which we know is already reasonable manifest and knownto many learned men in Germany, as their writings and secret congratula-tions do sufficiently witness the same. We could here relate and declare what all the time, from the year of OurLord 1378 (in which year our Christian Father was born) till now, hathhappened, where we might rehearse what alterations he hath seen in theseone hundred and six years of his life, which he hath left to our breathrenand us after his decease to peruse. But brevity, which we do observe, willnot permit at this present to make rehearsal of it, till a more fit time. At this"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"23time it is enough for those which do not despise our declaration, havingtherefore briefly touched it, thereby to prepare the way for their acquain-tance and friendship with us. Yet to whom it is permitted that he may see, and for his instruction use,those great letters and characters which the Lord god hath written andimprinted in heaven and earth’s edifice, through the alteration of govern-ment, which hath been from time to time altered and reviewed, the same isalready (although as yet unknown to himself) ours. And as we know he willnot despise our inviting and calling, so none shall fear any deceit, for wepromise and openly say, that no man’s uprightness and hopes shall deceivehim, whosoever shall make himself known unto us under the seal ofsecrecy, and desire our Fraternity. But to the false hypocrites, and to those that seek other things than wis-dom, we say and witness by these presents publicly, we cannot be madeknown, and be betrayed unto them; and much less they shall be able to hurtas any manner of way without the will of God; but they shall certainly bepartakers of all the punishment spoken of in our Fama; so their wickedcounsels shall light upon themselves, and our treasures shall remainuntouched and unstirred, until the Lion doth come, who will ask them forhis use, and employ them for the confirmation and establishment of hiskingdom. We ought therefore here to observe well, and make it knownunto everyone, that God hath certainly and most assuredly concluded tosend and grant to the world before her end, which presently thereuponshall ensue, such a truth, light, life, and glory, as the first man Adam had,which he lost in Paradise, after which his successors were put and driven,with him, to misery. Wherefore there shall cease all servitude, falsehood,lies, and darkness, which by little and little, with the great world’s revolu-tion, was crept into all arts, works, and governments of men, and havedarkened the most part of them. For form thence are proceeded an innu-merable sort of all manner of false opinions and heresies, that scarce thewisest of all was able to know whose doctrine and opinion he should followand embrace, and could not well and easily be discerned; seeing on the onepart they were detained, hindered, and brought into errors through therespect of the philosophers and learned men, and on the other part throughtrue experience. All the which, when it shall once be abolished andremoved, and instead thereof a right and true rule instituted, then there willremain thanks unto them which have taken pains therein. But the workitself shall be attributed to the blessedness of our age."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"24As we now willingly confess, that may principal men by their writingswill be a great furtherance unto this Reformation which is to come; so wedesire not to have this honour ascribed to us, as if such work were onlycommanded and imposed upon us. But we confess, and witness openlywith the Lord Jesus Christ, that it shall first happen that the stones shallarise, and offer their service, before there shall be any want of executors andaccomplishers of God’s counsel; yea, the Lord God hath already sent beforecertain messengers, which should testify his will, to wit, some new stars,which do appear and are seen in the firmament in Serpentario and Cygno,which signify and give themselves known to everyone, that they are power-ful Signacula of great weighty matters. So then, the secret his writings andcharacters are most necessary for all such things which are found out bymen. Although that great book of nature stands open to all men, yet thereare but few that can read and understand the same. For as there is given toman two instruments to hear, likewise two to see, and two to smell, butonly one to speak, and it were but vain to expect speech from the ears, orhearing from the eyes. So there hath been ages or times which have seen,there have also been ages that have heard, smelt, and tasted. Now thereremains yet that which in short time, honour shall be likewise given to thetongue, and by the same; what before times hath been seen, heard, andsmelt, now finally shall be spoken and uttered forth, when the World shallawake out of her heavy and drowsy sleep, and with an open heart, bare-head, and bare-foot, shall merrily and joyfully meet the new arising Sun. These characters and letters, as God hath here and there incorporatedthem in the Holy Scriptures, the Bible, so hath he imprinted them in allbeasts. So that like as the mathematician and astronomer can long beforesee and know the eclipses which are to come, so we may verily foreknowand foresee the darkness of obscurations of the Church, and how long theyshall last. From the which characters or letters we have borrowed our magicwriting, and have found out, and made, a new language for ourselves, inthe which withal is expressed and declared the nature of all things. So that itis no wonder that we are not so eloquent in other languages, the which weknow that they are altogether disagreeing to the language of our forefa-thers, Adam and Enoch, and were through the Babylonical confusionwholly hidden. But we must also let you understand that there are yet some Eagles’Feathers in our way, the which do hinder our purpose. Wherefore we doadmonish everyone for to read diligently and continually the Holy Bible,"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"25for he that taketh all his pleasures therein, he shall know that he preparedfor himself an excellent way to come to our Fraternity. For as this is thewhole sum and content of our rule, that every letter or character which isin the world ought to be learned and regarded well; so those are like untous, and are very near allied unto us, who do make the Holy Bible a rule oftheir life, and an aim and end of all their studies: yea to let it be a compen-dium and content of the whole world. And not only to have it continuallyin the mouth, but to know how to apply and direct the true understandingof it to all times and ages of the world. Also, it is not our custom to prosti-tute and make so common the Holy Scriptures; for there are innumerableexpounders of the same; some alleging and wresting it to serve for theiropinion, some to scandal it, and most wickedly do like it to a nose of wax,which alike should serve the divines, philosophers, physicians, and mathe-maticians, against all the which we do openly witness and acknowledge,that from the beginning of the world there hath not been given unto men amore worthy, a more excellent, and more admirable and wholesome Bookthan the Holy Bible. Blessed is he that hath the same, yet more blessed is hewho reads it diligently, but most blessed of all is he that truly understandeththe same, for he is most like to God, and doth truly understandeth thesame, for his most like to God, and doth come most near to him. Butwhatsoever hath been said in the Fama concerning the deceivers against thetransmutation of metals, and the highest medicine in the world, the same isthus to be understood, that this so great gift of God we do in no manner setat naught, or dispise it. But because she bringeth not with her always theknowledge of Nature, but this bringeth forth not only medicine, but alsomaketh manifest and open unto us innumerable secrets and wonders.Therefore it is requisite, that we be earnest to attain to the understandingand knowledge of philosophy. And moreover, excellent wits ought not tobe drawn to the tincture of metals, before they be exercised well in theknowledge of Nature. He must needs be an insatiable creature, who iscome so far, that neither poverty nor sickness can hurt him, yea, who isexalted above all other men, and hath rule over that, the which dothanguish, trouble and pain others, yet will give himself again to idle things,as to build houses, make wars, and use al manner of pride, because he hathgold and silver infinite store.

The which is the right reward of the Romishseducers, who have vomited forth their blasphemies against Christ, and asyet do not abstain from their lies in this clear shining light. In Germany alltheir abominations and detestable tricks have been disclosed, that therebyhe may fully fulfill the measure of sin, and draw near to the end of his pun-ishment. Therefore one day it will come to pass, that the mouth of thosevipers will be stopped and the triple crown will be brought to nought, asthereof at our meeting shall more plain and at large be discoursed. For conclusion of our Confession, we must earnestly admonish you, thatyou put away, if not all, yet the most books written by false Alchemists,who do think it but a jest, or a pastime, when they either misuse the HolyTrinity, when they do apply it to vain things, or deceive the people withmost strange figures, and dark sentences and speeches, and cozen the simpleof their money; as there are nowadays too many such books set forth,which the Enemy of man’s welfare doth daily, and will to the end, mingleamong the good seed, thereby to make the Truth more difficult to bebelieved, which in herself is simple, easy, and naked, but contrarily False-hood is proud, haughty, and coloured with a kind of lustre of seeminggodly and of humane wisdom. Ye that are wise eschew such books, andturn unto us, who seek not your moneys, but offer unto you most willinglyour great treasures. We hunt not after your goods with invented lying tinc-tures, but desire to make you partakes of our goods. We speak unto you byparables, but would willingly bring you to the right, simple, easy andingenuous exposition, understanding, declaration, and knowledge of allsecrets. We desire not to be received by you, but invite you unto our morethan kingly houses and palaces, and that verily not by our own propermotion, but (that you likewise may know it) as forced unto it, by the insti-gation of the Spirit of God, by his admonitions, and by the occasion of thispresent time. What think you, loving people, and how seem you affected, seeing thatyou now understand and know, that we acknowledge ourselves truly andsincerely to profess Christ, condemn the Pope, addict ourselves to the truePhilosophy, lead a Christian life, and daily call, entreat and invite manymore unto our Fraternity, unto whom the same Light of God likewiseappeareth? Consider you not at length how you might begin with us, notonly by pondering the Gifts which are in you, and by experience whichyou have in the word of God, beside the careful consideration of the imper-fection of all arts, and many other unfitting things, to seek for an amend-"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"27ment therein; to appease God, and to accommodate you for the timewherein you live. Certainly if you will perform the same, this profit willfollow, that all those goods which Nature hath in all parts of the worldwonderfully dispersed, shall at one time altogether be given unto you, andshall easily disburden you of all that which obscureth the understanding ofman, and hindereth the working thereof, like unto the vain eccentrics andepicycles. But those pragmatical and busy-headed men, who either are blindedwith the glittering of gold, or (to say more truly) who are now honest, butby; thinking such great riches should never fail, might easily be corrupted,and brought to idleness, and to riotous proud living, those we desire thatthey would not trouble us with their idle and vain crying. But let themthink, that although there be a medicine to be had which might fully cureall diseases, nevertheless those whom God hath destined to plague with dis-eases, neverthelesss those whom God hath destined to plaque with diseases,and to keep under the rod of correction, such shall never obtain any suchmedicine. Even in such manner, although we might enrich the whole world, andendue them with learning, and might release it from innumerable miseries,yet shall we never be manifested and made known unto any many, withoutthe especial pleasure of God; yea, it shall be so far from him whosoeverthinks to get the benefit and be partaker of our riches and knowledge,without and against the will of God, that he shall sooner lose his life inseeking and searching for us, than to find us, and attain to come to thewished happiness of the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross. \u0001 \u0001 \u0001"}]
