Wynn Westcott, and Samuel Liddell Macgregor Mathers. LordLytton (Sir Edward Bulwher−Lytton, author of \"Zanoni\") and Eliphas Levi were both awardedHonorary membership, but there is no evidence they ever attended SRIA meetings.The SRIA worked nine grades in total: four learning grades,Zelator• Theoricus• Practicus• Philosophus• three Teaching grades,Adeptus Minor• Adeptus Major• Adeptus Exemptus• and two Ruling Grades,Magister Templi• Magus.• Of these, the first seven were the only ones that could usually be attained: however, unlike theGolden Dawn, the SRIA made no pretence that Magistri Templi and Magi were mysteriouspraeterhuman \"Secret Chiefs\". Although both grades could theoretically be awarded on an HonorisCausa basis (e.g. for outstanding lifetime−service to the Rosicrucian Order), they were usuallyreserved to the senior−most administrators of the Society.For example, William Woodman would have been a Magus, as at one point he was Supreme Magusof the SRIA. So too would have been his deputies, the Senior and Junior Substitute Magi; so towould the \"Chief Adept\", who is mentioned in these ceremonies.It is interesting to note what Kenneth Mackenzie had to say about the Rosicrucian grades in his\"Royal Masonic Cyclopedia\".The \"Zelator\", alternatively known as \"Illuminatus\" or \"Junior\" – mystical name \"Periclinus deFaustis – is a learner only.Foreword2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The \"Theoricus\", or \"Theoreticus\" – mystical name \"Poraius de Rejectis\" – is concerned with therealisation of gold without labour.The \"Practicus\" – mystical name \"Monoceros de Astris\" – is inured to hardship, and finds from othersources the essential sources in the form of coin.The \"Philosophus\" – mystical name \"Pharos Illuminans\" – studies Botany, natural history, and thebranches of science.The \"Adeptus Minor\" – mystical name \"Hodos Chamelionis\" – finds the Philosophical Sun, andworks marvellous cures.The \"Adeptus Major\" – mystical name \"Sphaere Fortus a Sales\" – finds the Lapidem Mineralis, orMagnet.The \"Adeptus Exemptus\" – mystical name \"Ianus de Aure Campus\" – finds the Philosophers’ Stone,and studies the Qabalah and Natural Magic.The \"Magister Templi\" – mystical name \"Pedemontanus de Rebus\" – possesses the Three PrincipleSciences in a perfect degree.Finally, to the \"Magus\" – mystical name \"Luxianus Renaldus de Perfectis\" – nothing is unknown, hepossesses superiority and rank over all others, like Moses, Aaron Hermes (Trismegistus) and Hiram(Abiff).Note that unlike the later Golden Dawn there was no \"Neophyte\" grade – it would appear that thiswas made up for by the fact that all members were Master Masons of at least six months’ standing.SRIA members also had to be believers in the trinitarian Christian faith – hence not all Masons couldjoin. It was also a male only society, there were no Co−Masons or other females – again, unlike theGolden Dawn.The SRIA proved to be popular enough that Masons in America wanted to set up their own branch.This they did – getting a charter from the English order, to found the \"Societas Rosicrucianis inCivitatibus Federatis\" i.e. the Rosicrucian Society in the United States. It is from this \"SRICF\" thatthe following Rituals derive – they date from around the year 1880.As for these first four rituals themselves – one can make the following observations. They arestrikingly different from the Golden Dawn ceremonies for the equivalent grades. Clearly whoeverwrote the Golden Dawn Cipher Manuscripts was not deriving them on the SRIA.The ceremonies tell a four part story concerning a member of the original order, Frater Gualdi. Hardat work trying to find the Elixir Vitae, he rang the ceremonial bell in the middle of the night – whichannounced his success. However, when the other Brethren reached him, he was lying on the floor,apparently dead. The Brethren tried to discover his last secret by consulting the working papers thatlay on the bench...The Initiate is therefore put into the role of a Brother trying to piece together Gualdi’s discovery, byinvestigating Alchemy, Astrology and Astronomy, etc. At the climax of the Philosophus ceremony,the Initiate sees Gualdi return to life – the hymn which is sung at this point giving some telling cluesRituals of the Societas Rosicrucianis in AngliaForeword3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"as to the real nature of the \"Elixir Vitae\"Alex Sumner.Rituals of the Societas Rosicrucianis in AngliaForeword4"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ZelatorFirst SectionThe Aspirant in the Preparation Room, retains his Citizen’s dress, but uncovered.

Listen!Historical NarrativeBuried in the depths of solitude, far from the sight and sound of human life, partly rock−hewn andpartly constructed of massive stone closely and carefully placed in position, were three clusteringand connecting, but equally sized compartments; so completely and studiously compacted anddeadened in their structure and approach that the outside world could not know of their existencewere the roar of thunder, or the shouts of Myriads to awake their echoes in these subterranean halls.One chamber was devoted to a general Laboratory with a section set apart for domestic purposes,with ingenious sieve−like flues for the unrecognisable escape to the outer world of the smoke, gassesand fumes. This Apartment was long and of ample size; while the Second, also rectangular in shape,was set apart for rest, containing rude couches and also simple tables for simpler fare. Opposed tothis, across the Main Laboratory and opening into it, but with descending steps, was the Third andlargest Hall, with rising pointed roof of rugged structure, used for a monkish study and Chapel, aswell. At regular intervals through the centre, were four cubic tables used as desks with seats of stone,and pendant from the centre of the lofty roof hung the wondrous lamp, whose radiant flame, was asthe rosy light of a summer’s setting sun, intensely golden, illuminating all space, never needing careand inexhaustible.

Into these sacred, silent precincts none were allowed to enterexcept the Adepts, the Magister Templi and the Magus, save at the daily morning and evening hourof prayer, when all must gather for silent worship, or at periods of Reception of Aspirants, or duringthe Annual Assembly. These solitary chambers formed the home of 36 of the RosicrucianBrotherhood, no more, no less, could occupy these rock−built Halls: all others were constrained toserve their learnings and to account for deeds of good and service done. Their brief sojourn beingended, from the entire number the Magus again tailed off those who were to serve humanity at largeand 36 remained.

Once it was the Mystery solved, that alloyand baser metal had yielded to transmutation to Silver, and again, once to the richer Gold, but theirproducts were not permitted to result in ease and luxury.The greatest secret yet lay hid, the prolongation, the rejuvenation of animal life. ‘Twas death to strikethe tocsin−bell, save by him whose skill had solved one of four problems: First, the rejuvenation ofthe ever−burning lamp; Second, the transmutation to Silver; Third, the transmutation to gold; andFourth, the discovery of the Elixir Vitae.Of this last, long had the Frater, Signor Gualdi, a Magister Templi, daily hoped for the final solution;that he was on the verge of the discovery he had no doubt, and his belief was imbued in the minds ofhis fellows, he longed to sound the bell and startle his own soul. In letters of fire he had written thisaphorism, Igne Nitrum Roris Invenitur, \"by Fire the Nitre of the dew is extracted\" and this was to behis solution.All nature slept, the wearied monks save, save one, had gone to rest, the very fires of the forge werewrapped in slumber, when at the dread hour, the hopeful Gualdi, rose from his seat of stone in thebrilliant but rocky chapel, and shouting Eureka, rang out the bell with unearthly clangour, startlingthe very rocks into echo. It as suddenly ceased as Monk followed Monk into the Holy Chamber tomeet, to see nought, even to hear but the still resounding echo of the clamouring bell.At the central table−altar were open books of Gualdi; by their side a small vessel containing nitreand a crucible partly filled with gold held in solution.

The want of intelligence would be simply amazing were it not evidentthat the mischievous ignorance of a few has been repeated successively without individual research.Ignorance, prejudice, envy and conceit have taken possession of the minds of the critics andHistorians; yet the unique and attractive Rosaic doctrines interested vast masses of 17th century,although the society had taken its rise in the latter part of the 15th century.The lives of the Rosicrucians were dramatic to a sensational degree. The practical branch of theSociety was in charge of Alchemists and Hermeticists, who while they claimed, and not withoutmuch reason, their ability to transmute metals to Silver or Gold, further sought for mental and moralpowers, rather than riches, which are the aims of true philosophers. The real philosopher looks notfor pomp, glitter, splendour nor luxury, he has been schooled in a higher sphere and he appreciatestheir transitory nature. Wealth in money to him is dross, far desire, and freedom from confusedannoyance of worldly thoughts, which are engendered and distracted by the purchases of riches.Possessions, honour, rank and money to him are but as trifles; he forces the growing Supernaturalsoul to work amidst the loving sunshine and to propagate holy thoughts as the most precious ofheavenly gifts.Worldly grandeur fades before intellectual elevation; the physical world sinks below him and hefeels nearer to the angelic Hosts. He values the unseen kingdoms, and glimpses of immortal gloriesobtained from Magic reveries. He dwells in an atmosphere of heavenly music, his soul keepingharmony with the yearnings of his intellect.The earnest wish of the Rosicrucians was to pass through with World unnoticed and unchallenged,but ever prepared for exalted action when in their power, without a revelation of who they are.Now, Frater Zelator, having passed through the ceremonies required by our Ordinance, and havingknelt before the Altar of Light, you are permitted to join in the Mystic labours of this grade.This privilege is conferred only upon discreet and worthy men to whom the revelations ofTheosophy and Hermetic Science may be safely confided.

You wereinformed in the Grade of Zelator, of three rock−built Halls in juxtaposition, they were the MainLaboratory, the Apartment for refreshment and rest, and the Secret or Sacred Hall, sometimes termedthe Chapel, seclusive under certain circumstances: You were also told of the discovery of thetransmutation to Silver and Gold, of the continued search for the re−invention of the wondrousever−burning Lamp and the presumed discovery of the \"Elixir of Life\" by Frater Gualdi, of whomyou will learn more hereafter, end his being found apparently lifeless as he rung the greatDeath−bell. Let me give you a further insight into this Home of the Rosicrucians.In connection with the general structure of the three Apartments were four other and smaller roomsopposite the Laboratory, and on the other side of the Chapel or Congregating Hall. These werevariously fitted up and adapted to the purposes of which they were assigned as will be made knownto you. They were of about equal size and could aggregate a space covering the Main Hall to whicheach one communicated by a short passage while having inter−communication with each other.Upon entering the first passage from the Chapel Porch, and near what we may term the South−West,we are led to the entrance of a quadrangular apartment of convenient proportions; having a rude builtroof with sieve flue or outlet for vapours, and fitted up and devoted to Chemistry, Alchemy and theirkindred studies. The equipment of materials essential for service were plain receptacles, butapparently for a long series of years been in practical use.In this apartment evidently unconscious of any intrusion were gowned and cowled in blue, sevenStudents of the Pestle and Mortar, mixing, compounding and calculating without unnecessaryconverse or recognition of each other's presence, but deeply intent upon their assumed tasks. Thesewere the Theorici or Rosicrucians of the 2nd Grade.Acids and Chemicals, roots, herbs, gums and minerals in abundance, in powders and pastes, and allapparently in confusion, surrounded the wells, on shelves, in closets, and drawers, in bottles, jars andboxes, stored to all appearance in unknown quantities. These were Nature's unadulterated gifts to beused for the health and preservation of Man.The small Laboratory was made famous in the early part of the 16th Century by the followingdiscovery of transmutation by the Chemists of the Rosicrucians: while examining and investigatingthe amalgam of Mercury, Lead and Arquifoux with the readily fusible Bismuth, wonderful changesappeared by the introduction of a solution known to the Theorici as 'Primitia' or Primordial Solution.Slowly did these changes appear, when a whitish metal, in grains and dendrites, of the colour ofsilver with a similar lustre and ductility, yet softer, was found mixed with cobalt bloom, a littleRituals of the Societas Rosicrucianis in AngliaSecond Section Colour Blue23"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"sulphuret and chloride of silver.The interest manifested in this hitherto unknown production or result among the Theorici attractedthe attention of the Alchemists of the Grade of Practicus, who pronounced the discovery of thetransmutation of Silver.Then the deep−toned bell was for the first time rung with no uncertain sound, and the Brethrenassembled in the Chapel for praise and prayer.A feeling of cupidity immediately seized the Brethren of the Society, and with caution of no lessthan 10,000 Marks of this silver were disposed of in the various cities of Europe, when the Magusand his Council forbade, under pains and penalties the further production of the metal inconsequence of its evident baneful effect upon the entire Rosicrucian Society, and the danger of theirorganisation being annihilated.This famed discovery took place in the apartment intended to be represented by the one in which youare: and to this extent you are now introduced into the Home and to the Study of the Second Gradeof the Rosicrucians.

It is a primarypower, pure and uncorrupted, it exerciseth with the intellectual man and takes no part with theunthinking and indolent.

We purposely propose making to you a new and startlingdiscovery, and assigning you work in a more interior apartment of our moral laboratory.You are to be instructed in the use of new and subtle simples and compounds of more artful andingenious composition, through the force of elimination by Fire or Flame, Be not regardless of theirsymbolic application.Lest our approach to Alchemic discovery may be thoughtlessly revealed, we find it essential. toemploy symbols to obscure our thoughts and ideas to the worldly and curious.

In this and congenial studies by being an activeparticipant you are entitled to rank as Practicus.2nd Alchemist:In continuation of your late instruction received from the four Ancients, let me speak of our practicalexperience in this Laboratory. Your attention was drawn to the various phases of Fire.

Men of Science cannot tell. uswhat is Fire, but simply say, it is a phenomenon; they cannot tell whence it comes, or whither itgoeth. They tell us it is the evolution of Light and hear in the combustion of bodies.Conductor:What knowledge can you impart upon the effect of the Fire element upon the production of preciousmetals?3rd Alchemist:We may advise you, that Gold and Silver are the chief metals of the Alchemists, and the two chiefMystic Symbols of the Rosicrucians. Fire, light, vitality exists in everything, metal, stone and timber,when the 'Life' of which is gone, it becomes unfit for service. In the combination of the metals whichwas explained to you as a Theoricus, you well remember of the product of silver through the germ ofPrimordium, which germ has also given to us the product of Gold, and which it is ardently hopedwill shortly give to us the Elixir Vitae. To the uninstructed, it is the generally received opinion thatthese things are among the impossible: this may be, but the approach, to us, seems at our door, andnot a drew, nor a fable. This possibility is based upon the assumption that every metal consists ofMercury as a versatile and flexible base, out of which all metals have their being, and. into whichthey may be ultimately reduced by Art. 2nd: That the Species of Metals and their specific forms arenot subject to transmutation, but only the individual or primal parts, which are visible and can beacted upon. 3rd: All metals differ in their degree of perfection or purity toward the invisible Light orLife which is within everything, the 'Celestial glory', or primordial base, which has matter for itscover, or exterior, or mask. 4th: Art overleaps and transcends Nature, accomplishing, quickly thatwhich Nature requires periods to attain. 5th: God has created every metal of its own kind, and fixedin them a principle of growth, especially in Gold, the Superior metal, and which in itself hasmagnetic seed, an unseen power, unappreciable in this world, but which Art can , inspire andmultiply.We feel that we are upon the eve of obtaining this power, for what may be done with metal, mayhave a co−relative effect upon the human body; that is that the solution of prolongation of animal lifemust follow quickly upon the ability to transmute other metals to Gold, as they are kindred, thepurest metallic life with animal life. The ability to hold Gold in solution is already familiar to us.Conductor:What mean you by the product of Gold by Nature through germination and increase; is it subject tomultiplication through seed as in the animal and vegetable kingdoms?4th Alchemist:Certainly, but under a modified process of Nature. The precious metals are nurtured, and subject toincrease through the secret operations of the Planets, they gestate and grow daily in the bowels of theearth. The Sun and Moon, night and day, light and darkness, water and fire are all active in thegeneration of the precious metals. It has been a matter of assumption, that the invisible operation ofthe Sun effects the natural production of Gold, while the refining and bleaching lucidity of the Moonhad its effect on Silver. Whence their origin, if they do not germinate and fructify in the Laboratoriesof the Earth as in the womb of their Mother, and produce strains of Nature in maturing? The purposeof the Alchemist is to assist Nature and expedite it through the hermetic Art.Rituals of the Societas Rosicrucianis in AngliaPracticus31"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"A spark, an atom of Fire, Life, or Divine Lux, which is within every thing, is in the metals, deeplyhidden in the interior which buds, germinates and bears fruit.Conductor:The production of the precious metals is only through assisting Nature in its more rapid gestation,while the multiplying its seed is an impossibility?4th Alchemist:Not altogether so, for the Rosicrucian Alchemist claims to be able to gather the subtle, escapinggases or fumes, he or retain them and reduce them to material shape, thus, metaphorically, they enterthe outer world or exterior of visible and material matter, and bring back into visible, tangible formold things metamorphosed into new things. This is the true significancy of Transmutation. Theinvisible escaping light or fire of certain metals seized upon, that is this 'Fairy Gold', is condensedinto real Gold, through the influence of 'Primitia' or Primordial solution.We thus figuratively express our ability 'to go beyond the line of this physical world, to pass as itwere into the next world, work in it, and come back in safety bearing our well earned trophies ofmarketable gold, and the Elixir Vitae, or the means of rejuvenation, and perpetuation of human life.We thus become possessed of a revealed divine power, having the impress of immortality, andtermed the monstruum or Hagisterium, which seizes upon the departing breath of the spirit, as itwings from man, and wins it back despite itself to redischarge its functions. The physical man isestopped in his decay, in his daily bodily corruption and the escaping native Fire resumes its ordinaryduty end faculty.This paradox presents itself, 'Light is material and hence must be dark, as all material, hence itcannot be light to us, though it may be darkness to God'.Conductor:That evidence can be produced of these powers of change in material substances and immaterialshadows?5th Alchemist:Have you not already witnessed them, or does not your intellect present them possible?

It is not necessary for the eyeless cave−fish have orbs end fitting sockets, to give itperceptive sight. Give me your Scarlet Rose, the emblem of our Love, the symbol of our darningFaith in eternal Life.5th Alchemist takes the Rose from the Cross, and holds it in the fumes of flour of sulphur, whichflour is taken from a jar, and sprinkled on the chemical flaming tripod dish: TheChemist then continues: Behold this beauteous Rose of scarlet colour and brilliant hue, emblematicof the blood that washes away the sins of the world, note its contact with the fumes of this simpleyellow mineral and the effect; how gradually end yet certainly it conceals its collar, when thesulphurous gases, as of an evil Spirit, dare to approach it.Rituals of the Societas Rosicrucianis in AngliaPracticus32"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The colour of the Rose turns to a pallor, or white.Our expressive emblem of Man’s redemption, blushing in its pride, fails not to hide its beauty andscorning the distasteful union, exhibits its defilement through every part; as the Soul grows pallid bycontagion with the influences of the evil One, whose symbols are sulphur in contact with Fire.

Shortly the1st Alchemist, recovering, speaks: Know, Frater, The cause of our sudden grief. Our hopes, ourconvictions, were centred, and our belief is still unshaken, that the Great Mysterium is discovered,but the secret was with the Magister Templi, Gualdi; who at the instant of his discovery, rang of thewelcome tidings, but becoming overjoyed at his success, the functions of Nature succumbed, and hewas found at the midnight hour by those he had alarmed still holding the thong that sounded thejoyous news, but as it now appears, his own death knell.It was his habit to pursue his labours at night when all nature was still and his Fraters in repose: hissuccess was foreshadowed and a nightly alarm expected; but from the time of the finding his body hehas never uttered a word, or given his watchers a sign. The solution that was found on his centraldesk contained Nitre and Gold in solution with some other admixture: and his motto, 'Igne NitrumRoris Invenitur', by Fire the Nitre of Dew is extracted, scrawled in crimson upon a piece of dyedskin, was laying close by his seat.The supposition was entertained that he may have drunk of the solution, and his own life mightthereby be saved: his body was taken accordingly to the Chamber of Rest, together with his books,and the chemica1s with which he was experimenting, in hopes of his giving evidence of life andrevealing the long sought for secret.It had been agreed that his watchers should be without intermission, and that the Magus and Councilshould set this day and hour (it being now 3 days since his syncope commenced) and adjudge himalive or dead: with the notification to the Brotherhood, that one−half the number of hours into whichRituals of the Societas Rosicrucianis in AngliaPracticus33"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Hermes had divided the day should be tolled announcing the conclusion of their decision, and thatbriefly following one bell stroke should signify their decision of Death, and three in quick successionthe power of his resuscitation.

Your second interrogatory is to be sought for in and afterstudy, and with the Adepts.We will now retire to the Chapel or Sacred Hall, and leave you under the care of your able and wiseConductor.The Alchemists retire, with arms crossed on breast.Conductor:Frater, the learned Alchemist who has just left us, is a wise and noted Rosicrucian; he intimates toyou the source from which the name of this noble Fraternity takes its rise, at least this scientificportion: thus, the name comes from 'Ros', the Latin word for Dew, and 'Crux', 'Cross'. From themystical Cross is formed the letters spelling the Latin word Lux, or Light or Fire: hence the hiddensignificancy in the Aphorism, 'By Fire the Nitre of the Dew is extracted', or 'Igne, Nitrum, Roris,Invenitur'.The great revival in this class or branch of Rosicrucianism was at Paris. In March 1623, when thenumber 36 was thus distributed, 6 in Paris, 6 in Italy, 6 in Spain, 12 in Germany, 4 in Sweden and 2in Switzerland.You well remember what was said to you of the discovery of transmutation to Silver, and theexcitement occasioned thereby, as narrated to you in the preceding Grade of Theoricus, but thewildness of enthusiasm was evinced, when the Practicus Philosophers sounded that terrible Bell,which announced the double discovery of the Transmutation to 'White Gold', or Platinum. and that ofVirgin Gold.The sole attention of the 6 Alchemists of the Practicus Grade was given to the transformation ofmetals to Gold, immediately after realising the force of Primitia when excercised by Fire uponcertain. primary metals and producing silver.Realising that through evolution all things in the Universe had succumbed to change, and that byprogression even in the metals a theory of successive changes is established by which nature revealsstrange results, the task remained to ascertain the requisite metals for the combination, with theproper proportions thereof, and the dynamic conditions or laws by the use of Primitia to produce thedesired result, which was Gold.They were confident that Mercury was an essential: that copper was necessary, and most likelysulphur and tin.The ability to hold Gold in solution had already been conquered by Nitro Nuriatic Acid. In formingRituals of the Societas Rosicrucianis in AngliaPracticus34"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"the amalgam native gold was added to the above named metals, as a seed. The course of Nature,under the operation of a simple and universal law, is effected, sometimes slowly, before evolutionensues exhibiting organic development. Thus having the matter as a vehicle of change, motion beingrequired to attain the result by change, a force became requisite to cause change that evolutionshould follow. As one thing is derived from others, the problem of advance becomes one oftransmutation; and as matter and force are not created, the changes must be those of transformation.The Alchemists then had recourse to Primitia, a Nitre extracted from dew, which caused motion, themechanical collision, the breathing as it were of the component parts, which produces life, andresulted in a chemical change. This was from an incoherent mass to coherence producing integrationof parts. After tedious experimenting, and with different components, two new combinations of greatvalue were disclosed, one of 'White Gold', or Platinum, and the other, the long sought for, malleable,unoxidizing, lustrous, precious gold.Joy and relief to millions of their fellow−men was their first impulse. But had these Alchemists oncerevealed the power of goldmaking, the metal could have lost its value and not unlikely the producerwould have lost his life to gratify an insatiate people. But no, the very knowledge of their magicpower, and the surprise at its existence, delighted them more, than aught the World could give. Theyconcealed their Mystery, denied its existence, shunned Society and the World, remained unknown,invisible, illuminated; serving their God and as well mankind, assisting the feeble, frail andsuffering. They were overcome and astonished at the immensity of the power accorded by God’sgrace to man.A long list of eminent men, experts and profound students have examined the product of gold by Art,and have verified its production in its material state by Alchemical Transmutation.This Chamber, Frater, although small in size, is intended to represent the Laboratory of thesePhilosophers, as you perceive, and is the Second in the Series of four rooms on the south side of theSacred Hall, that occupied by the Theorici being the first, and which leads into this by a connectingpassage−way. Here you beheld loss of confusion in the retorts, bulbs, receivers, worms and cylindersfor compounding and distilled. Here were required scales and measures, heating and hanging lamps,and all the appliances necessary and requisite for the use of the Philosophers of Hermes. Salt,Sulphur and Mercury abound in various shapes. Alkali and Acids continually met the gaze: and inlong rows, systematically arranged and occupying one side of the room, were many books of theEgyptians, treating of universal principles, of the nature and orders of Celestial beings. of medicinesand ever of divination.

It could be impossible to contemplate theHeavens and not believe in the existence of One Supreme Being of the Universe.A consideration of this Science includes the movements, distribution, and the physical characteristicsof the Heavenly Bodies. Next to that of tilling the soil to obtain sustenance for life, Astronomy is theoldest Science, for it became essential to measure time, and this could be furnished only through astudy of the firmament.The first recorded observations off any remarkable accuracy are those from the Tower of Bel, atBabylon, by the Assyrians in the 23rd century before this era. This powerful Empire understood theuse of the Dial, the precession of the Equinoxes, and within a fraction the exact length of the tropicalyear, they even predicted in some cases, the return of Comets.Rituals of the Societas Rosicrucianis in AngliaPhilosophus43"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The chief seat of Astronomical learning among the Hindus, was at Benares, but the knowledge of theIndians in this Science was not equal to their neighbours. The Egyptians, however, who erected theirPyramids with mathematical precision, and not unlikely for astronomical purposes, and who erectednumerous monoliths to their Sun−God Ra, justly receive credit in astronomical history. Theremarkable coincidence exists, that through the inclined entrance of the Great pyramid, the StarDraco, in Hesperides, at its upper transit was visible day and night, and marked the period 2170 BCor the period when the chronological mensuration takes 25,868 years to return to itself again. Theerection of that Pyramid marked the great year of the Pleiades.The Astronomy of the Chinese is ancient though inexact. The wise Chwien−hio marked 2449 yearsbefore Christ, as an Epoch, through the conjunction of Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Theseancient people understood, to some extent, the Celestial motions, calculated Eclipses and slew two oftheir philosophers, Ho and Hi, for not announcing an eclipse of the Sun, 2169 BCThe Ionian School of the Greeks was founded by Thales, of Miletus, 600 BC It thoroughlycomprehended the seasonal changes and length of the year.To Hipparchus of Nicaea, however, 160 BC from whom the Ptolemaic School took its rise, isastronomy indebted for evidence of skill and acumen. He catalogued 1082 stars, calculated themotions of the Sun and Moon, made observations of the planets, and described. their motions by atheory of epicycles: he also invented plain and spherical trigonometry. Ptolemy followed, correctingthe procession, but insisted in placing the Earth in the centre of his system.The Arabians, impelled by the Mahomedan faith, swept down upon the Egyptians in the 7th.Century, and by the destruction of the Alexandrian Library, the great history of the astronomy of thispast was mainly lost to the world. But the Arabians surpassed the Greeks in practical astronomy.Continental Europe took little interest in this Science until the 13th Century, and even then madeimmaterial advancement until the Active days of the Rosicrucians when Fraters Purbach andReglementanus paved the way for our Brother Copernicus, who died in 1543, aged 70, and whofounded the time System by placing the Sun in the centre, and thus overthrew the Ptolemaic systemwhich had obtained. for 14 Centuries: nevertheless it required Galileo, Keplar, Newton and others toperfect the Copernican system, which was still entangled with the epicycles of Hipparchus and whichwere removed together with the centricities and concentricities by Keplar, through the theory of theBiblical astronomer Tycho Brahe, a Dane, who pointed out the apparent fixity of the stars, or theirenormous uncalculated. distances from the Earth and Sun.The invention of the Telescope now gave birth to new and certain Astronomic knowledge. Thediscovery of the Satellites of Jupiter by Galileo presented a. miniature of our planetary system andconfirmed it. Then Newton announces the discovery of gravitation about 1660, and Picard gives thedimensions of the Earth: Keplar establishes his three famous laws; the procession of the equinoxes isaccounted for by the law of gravitation; the theories of tides are established, and the solution of theEarth's oblateness: the inequality of the Moon’s motion by the Sun's attraction, is set at rest; the greatlaws of the stability of the Planetary System are firmly determined by the law of universalgravitation. The rings of Saturn and her 8 attending Satellites are announced, followed by Herschel’sdiscovery of Uranus in 1781, and then her four moons; this again by the tidings of the new planetNeptune and his Satellite, and in quick succession no less than 130 Asteroids between the orbits ofMars and Jupiter, then. the startling discovery that the rings of Saturn were composed of myriads ofsmall satellites, and finally, that millions of meteoric systems exist within the Sun’s domain more orless associated with the glowing Comets.Rituals of the Societas Rosicrucianis in AngliaPhilosophus44"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"With this brief review of the history of our Science, you will repair to the Suffragan for furtherinstruction.The Conductor and Practicus now pass the centre of the East to the Station of the Suffragan.Suffragan:Whatever throws additional light on the marvels of the aerial world, and into the starry depths,necessarily exercises a powerful influence over the mind of the earnest Rosicrucian. Astronomy is anexact Science, but an abstruse subject, yet a simple key opens much of its inner mysteries. We dividethe Heavens into three classes, the World of Air, the World of Stars, and the Heaven of Heavens.The first embraces the Atmospheric envelope, clouds, and attendant storms with their inhabitants.The Second includes the infinite space containing the Stars, Planets, Asteroids, Meteors, Comets,Star−Showers, Nebulae and the Universal system while the Third opens to our view God's Holy ofHolies, the Eternal Heavens, the Astronomical and Divine evidence of a real or an ideal residence ofthe Deity.To the Ancients, there were known but seven Planets, the Sun, .Moon, Mercury, Mars, Venus,Jupiter and Saturn, revolving about the central Earth, Each symbolised to them distinctive metals,Gold, Silver, Mercury, Steel, Copper, Tin, and Lead: each had. its assigned colour, musical tone,animal representative, Sacerdotal title, Alphabetical and Mythological designation, as well as Sign,and emanations from the great Central Aeon. The four elements, Earth, Air, Fire and Water,embraced the three principles Body, Soul, and Spirit; these exerted seven influences over the animalcreation: there were seven Virtues with corresponding Vices.

First the proceeding from the doctrine of the \"Soul of the World\". Second, thatderived from the consideration of numbers, letters and sacred words; and, Third that resulting from apure and holy life, and these all summed up in one great system of esoteric ethereal Truth. The Soulof the World is a difficult matter to express, if not to comprehend. We say, the Constellations of theZodiac govern the earthly animals. Every Star has its peculiar Nature, property and function; the sealand character of which it impresses through its rays upon plants, minerals and animal life. Theaffinities of these planets and stars are of great power, although it hath been taught, that each planetis active but one day in the seven fold, and further that the precious stones are produced through theChemic operation of the Planets working secretly in the telluric body. We argue that metals andminerals have but one base or foundation: and having this we would have the key that could unlockthe Universe. It hath been further taught that by the Hermetic or Magnetic Light, we can augmentand purify indifferent stones and, give them greater value: thus, on Sunday, expose yellow gems and.gold, and their weight will increase through the attractive power by affinity of the Sun; and thus bythe Alchemic action of the Moon, pearls and stones of white on Monday are improved: On Tuesdaylet Mars increase the fire of rubies, while on Wednesday, sapphires, turquoises and gems of bluereflect the brilliant mercury. Jupiter in his majesty, and Thor, are supreme on Thursday and givelustre to Amethysts and stones of sanguine tint. On Freddie, Venus favours emeralds; and onSaturday the oldest of gods, Saturn claims the lustrous diamond.The Planets, too, 'tis claimed, have direct power over the physical action of man, as well as over hisintellectual energies; his reason, appetites, senses, and powers of generation. These are some of thetheories which tend to prove our Atmospheric envelope a delicate sensorium, promptly responding toevery wave of physical energy that beats upon it from stellar space. Future observations will provethat the agency of planets in causing Solar disturbances is powerful to influence the great luminary incausing terrestrial cyclones and earthquakes, and that great magnetic and meteorologicaldisturbances over the entire globe are effected.Cond. of N.:We were taught in the Council that Astronomy was an exact Science, then why these uncertaintiesand trusting to a future?3rd Philos.:Mark well, the depths of space lead into infinity in the Universe, the invention of the GalileanTelescope has but opened the eyes of the mind and our instruments though numerous, may beimperfect.
