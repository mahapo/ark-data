Now the same thing still twitching me several times by the coat, Ilooked back, and behold it was a fair and glorious lady, whose garmentswere all sky-coloured, and curiously (like Heaven) bespangled with goldenstars; in her right hand she bore a trumpet of beaten gold, on which aName was engraved which I could well read but am as yet forbidden toreveal it. In her left hand she had a great bundle of letters of all languages,which she (as I afterwards understood) was to carry to all countries. Shealso had large and beautiful wings, full of eyes throughout, with which shecould mount aloft, and fly swifter than any eagle. I might perhaps have been able to take further notice of her, but becauseshe stayed so little time with me, and terror and amazement still possessedme, I had to be content. For as soon as I turned about, she turned her let-ters over and over, and at length drew out a small one, which with greatreverence she laid down upon the table, and without giving one word,departed from me. But in her mounting upward, she gave so mighty a blaston her gallant trumpet, that the whole hill echoed from it, and for a fullquarter of an hour after, I could hardly hear my own words. In so unlooked for an adventure I was at a loss, how either to advise or toassist my poor self, and therefore fell upon my knees and besought my Cre-ator to permit nothing contrary to my eternal happiness to befall me.Whereupon with fear and trembling, I went to the letter, which was nowso heavy, that had it been mere gold it could hardly have been so weighty.Now as I was diligently viewing it, I found a little seal, on which a curiouscross with this inscription, IN HOC SIGNO VINCES, was engraved. O"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Page 2Now as soon as I espied this sign I was the more comforted, as not beingignorant that such a seal was little acceptable, and much less useful, to theDevil. Whereupon I tenderly opened the letter, and within it, in an azurefield, in golden letters, found the following verses written.This day, today Is the Royal Wedding day. For this thou wast born And chosen of God for joy Thou mayest go to the mountain Whereon three temples stand, And see there this affair. Keep watch Inspect thyself And shouldst thou not bathe thoroughly The Wedding may work thy bane. Bane comes to him who faileth here Let him beware who is too light.Below was written: Sponsus and Sponsa.As soon as I had read this letter, I was presently like to have fainted away,all my hair stood on end, and a cold sweat tricked down my whole body.For although I well perceived that this was the appointed wedding, ofwhich seven years before I was acquainted in a bodily vision, and whichnow for so long a time I had with great earnestness awaited, and whichlastly, by the account and calculation of the planets, I had most diligentlyobserved, I found so to be, yet could I never foresee that it must happenunder such grievous perilous conditions. For whereas I before imagined,that to be a welcome and acceptable guest, I needed only to be ready toappear at the wedding, I was now directed to Divine Providence, of whichuntil this time I was never certain. I also found by myself, the more I examined my self, that in my headthere was nothing but gross misunderstanding, and blindness in mysteriousthings, so that I was not able to comprehend even those things which layunder my feet, and which I daily conversed with, much less that I should beborn to the searching out and understanding of the secrets of Nature, sincein my opinion Nature might everywhere find a more virtuous disciple, towhom to entrust her precious, though temporary and changeable, treasures."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 3I found also that my bodily behaviour, and outward good conversation,and brotherly love towards my neighbour, was not duly purged andcleansed. Moreover the tickling of the flesh manifested itself, whose affec-tion was bent only to pomp and bravery, and worldly pride, and not to thegood of mankind: and I was always contriving how by this art I might in ashort time abundantly increase my profit and advantage, rear up stately pal-aces, make myself an everlasting name in the world, and other similar carnaldesigns. But the obscure words concerning the three temples particularlyafflicted me, which I was not able to make out by any after-speculation, andperhaps should not have done so yet, had they not been wonderfullyrevealed to me. Thus stuck between hope and fear, examining my self again and again,and finding only my own frailty and impotence, not being in any way ableto succour myself, and exceedingly amazed at the fore mentioned threaten-ing, at length I betook myself to my usual and most secure course - after Ihad finished my earnest and most fervent prayer, I laid myself down in mybed, so that perchance my good angel by the Divine permission mightappear, and (as it had sometimes formerly happened) instruct me in thisdoubtful affair. Which to the praise of God, my own good, and my neigh-bours’ faithful and hearty warning and amendment, did now likewise comeabout. For I was yet scarcely fallen asleep, when I thought that I, together withan innumerable multitude of men, lay fettered with great chains in a darkdungeon, in which, without the least glimpse of light, we swarmed likebees one over another, and thus rendered each other’s affliction more griev-ous. But although neither I nor any of the rest could see one jot, yet I con-tinually heard one heaving himself above the other, when his chains andfetters had become ever so slightly lighter, though none of us had muchreason to shove up above the other, since we were all captive wretches. Now when I with the rest had continued a good while in this affliction,and each was still reproaching the other with his blindness and captivity, atlength we heard many trumpets sounding together and kettle drums beat-ing in such a masterly fashion, that it even revived us in our calamity andmade us rejoice. During this noise the cover of the dungeon was lifted up from above,and a little light let down to us. Then first might truly have been discernedthe bustle we kept, for all went pell-mell, and he who perchance hadheaved himself up too much, was forced down again under the others’ feet.In brief, each one strove to be uppermost. Neither did I myself linger, but"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Page 4with my weighty fetters slipped up from under the rest, and then heavedmyself upon a stone, which I laid hold of; howbeit, I was caught at severaltimes by others, from whom yet as well as I might, I still guarded myselfwith hands and feet. For we imagined no other but that we should all be setat liberty, which yet fell out quite otherwise. For after the nobles who looked upon us from above through the holehad recreated themselves a while with our struggling and lamenting, a cer-tain hoary-headed ancient man called to us to be quiet, and having scarcelyobtained this, began (as I still remember) to speak on thus:If the poor human race We r e n o t s o a r r o g a n t It would have been given much good From my mother’s heritage, But because the human race will not take heed It lies in such straits And must be held in prison. And yet my dearest mother Will not regard their mischief, She leaves her lovely gifts That many a man might come to the light, Though this may chance but seldom That they be better prized Nor reckoned as mere fable.Therefore in honour of the feast Which we shall hold today, That her grace may be multiplied A good work will she do: The rope will now be lowered Whoever may hang on to it He shall be freed.He had scarcely finished speaking when an ancient matron commandedher servants to let down the cord seven times into the dungeon, and drawup whosoever could hang upon it. Good God! that I could sufficientlydescribe the hurry and disquiet that then arose amongst us; for everyonestrove to get to the cord, and yet only hindered each other. But after seven"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 5minutes a sign was given by a little bell, whereupon at the first pull the ser-vants drew up four. At that time I could not get very near the cord, having(as is before mentioned) to my huge misfortune, betaken myself to a stoneat the wall of the dungeon; and thereby I was made unable to get to thecord which descended in the middle. The cord was let down the second time, but many, because their chainswere too heavy, and their hands too tender, could not keep their hold onthe cord, but with themselves beat down many another who else perhapsmight have held fast enough; nay, many a one was forcibly pulled off byanother, who yet could not himself get at it, so mutually envious were weeven in this our great misery. But they of all others most moved my compassion whose weight was soheavy that they tore their very hands from their bodies, and yet could notget up. Thus it came to pass that at those five times very few were drawnup. For as soon as the sign was given, the servants were so nimble at draw-ing the cord up, that the most part tumbled one upon another, and thecord, this time especially, was drawn up very empty.Whereupon the greatest part, and even I myself, despaired of redemp-tion, and called upon God that he would have pity on us, and (if possible)deliver us out of this obscurity; who then also heard some of us. For whenthe cord came down the sixth time, some of them hung themselves fastupon it; and whilst being drawn up, the cord swung from one side to theother, and (perhaps by the will of God) came to me, and I suddenly caughtit, uppermost above all the rest, and so at length beyond hope came out. Atwhich I rejoiced exceedingly, so that I did not perceive the wound whichduring the drawing up I had received on my head from a sharp stone, untilI, with the rest who were released (as was always done before) had to helpwith the seventh and last pull; at which time through straining, the bloodran down all over my clothes, which I nevertheless because of my joy didnot take notice of. Now when the last drawing up on which the most of allhung was finished, the matron caused the cord to be laid aside, and askedher aged son to declare her resolution to the rest of the prisoners, who afterhe had thought a little spoke thus unto them.Ye childer dear Ye w h o a r e h e r e , It is completed What long hath been known,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Page 6The great favour which my mother Hath here shown you twain Ye should not disdain: A joyful time shall soon be come. When each shall be the other’s equal, No one be poor or rich, And who was given great commands Must bring much with him now, And who was much entrusted with Stripped to the skin will be, Wherefore leave off your lamentation Which is but for a few days.As soon as he had finished these words, the cover was again put to andlocked down, and the trumpets and kettle-drums began afresh, yet thenoise of them could not be so loud but that the bitter lamentation of theprisoners which arose in the dungeon was heard above all, which soon alsocaused my eyes to run over. Presently afterwards the ancient matron, together with her son, sat downon seats before prepared, and commanded the redeemed should be told.Now as soon as she had demanded everyone’s name, which were also writ-ten down by a little page; having viewed us all, one after another, shesighed, and spoke to her son, so that I could well hear her, “Ah, how heart-ily I am grieved for the poor men in the dungeon! I would to God I couldrelease them all.” To which her son replied, “It is, mother, thus ordained by God, againstwhom we may not contend. If we were all of us lords, and possessed all thegoods upon Earth, and were seated at table, who would there then be tobring up the service?” Whereupon his mother held her peace, but soon after she said, “Well,however, let these be freed from their fetters,” which was likewise presentlydone, and I was the last except a few; yet I could not refrain (though I stilllooked upon the rest) but bowed myself before the ancient matron, andthanked God that through her, he had graciously and fatherly vouchsafed tobring me out of such darkness into the light. After me the rest did likewise,to the satisfaction of the matron. Lastly, to everyone was given a piece of gold for a remembrance, and tospend by the way, on the one side of which was stamped the rising sun, and"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Page 7on the other (as I remember) these three letters, D.L.S.; and therewitheveryone had license to depart, and was sent to his own business with thisannexed limitation, that we to the glory of God should benefit our neigh-bours, and reserve in silence what we had been entrusted with; which wealso promised to do, and so departed one from another. But because of thewounds which the fetters had caused me, I could not well go forward, buthalted on both feet, which the matron presently espying, laughing at it, andcalling me again to her said thus to me: “My son, do not let this defectafflict you, but call to mind your infirmities, and therewith thank God whohas permitted you even in this world, and in your state of imperfection, tocome into so high a light; and keep these wounds for my sake.” Whereupon the trumpets began to sound again, which gave me such ashock that I woke up, and then first perceived that it was only a dream, butit so strongly impressed my imagination that I was still perpetually troubledabout it, and I thought I still felt the wounds on my feet. Howbeit, by allthese things I understood well that God had vouchsafed that I should bepresent at this mysterious and bidden wedding. Wherefore with childlikeconfidence I returned thanks to his Divine Majesty, and besought him thathe would further preserve me in fear of him, that he would daily fill myheart with wisdom and understanding, and at length graciously (withoutdeserting me) conduct me to the desired end. Hereupon I prepared myself for the way, put on my white linen coat,girded my loins, with a blood-red ribbon bound cross-ways over my shoul-der. In my hat I stuck four red roses, so that I might sooner be noticedamongst the throng by this token. For food I took bread, salt and water,which by the counsel of an understanding person I had at certain timesused, not without profit, in similar occurrences. But before I left my cottage, I first, in this my dress and wedding gar-ment, fell down upon my knees, and besought God that in case such athing were, he would vouchsafe me a good issue. And thereupon in thepresence of God I made a vow that if anything through his grace should berevealed to me, I would employ it to neither my own honour nor my ownauthority in the world, but to the spreading of his Name, and the service ofmy neighbour. And with this vow, and good hope, I departed out of mycell with joy."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Page 8"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Page 9The Second Day had hardly got out of my cell into a forest when I thought thewhole heaven and all the elements had already trimmed them-selves in preparation for this wedding. For even the birdschanted more pleasantly than before, and the young fawnsskipped so merrily that they made my heart rejoice, and moved me to sing;wherefore with a loud voice I thus began:Rejoice dear bird And praise thy Maker, Raise bright and clear thy voice, Thy God is most exalted, Thy food he hath prepared for thee To give thee in due season. So be content therewith, Wherefore shalt thou not be glad, Wilt thou arraign thy God That he hath made thee bird? Wilt trouble thy wee head That he made thee not a man? Be still, he hath it well bethought And be content therewith. What do I then, a worm of earth To judge along with God? That I in this heaven’s storm Do wrestle with all art. Thou canst not fight with God. And whoso is not fit for this, let him be sped away O Man, be satisfied That he hath made thee not the King And take it not amiss, Perchance hadst thou despised his name, That were a sorry matter: For God hath clearer eyes that that He looks into thy heart, Thou canst not God deceive.I"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Page 10This I sang now from the bottom of my heart throughout the whole for-est, so that it resounded from all parts, and the hills repeated my last words,until at length I saw a curious green heath, to which I betook myself out ofthe forest. Upon this heath stood three lovely tall cedars, which by reason of theirbreadth afforded excellent and desired shade, at which I greatly rejoiced.For although I had not hitherto gone far, yet my earnest longing made mevery faint, whereupon I hastened to the trees to rest a little under them. Butas soon as I came somewhat closer, I saw a tablet fastened to one of them,on which (as afterwards I read) in curious letters the following words werewritten:“God save you, stranger! If you have heard anything concerning thenuptials of the King, consider these words. By us the Bridegroom offersyou a choice between four ways, all of which, if you do not sink down inthe way, can bring you to his royal court. The first is short but dangerous,and one which will lead you into rocky places, through which it willscarcely be possible to pass. The second is longer, and takes you circui-tously; it is plain and easy, if by the help of the Magnet you turn neither toleft nor right. The third is that truly royal way which through various plea-sures and pageants of our King, affords you a joyful journey; but this so farhas scarcely been allotted to one in a thousand. By the fourth no man shallreach the place, because it is a consuming way, practicable only for incor-ruptible bodies. Choose now which one you will of the three, and perse-vere constantly therein, for know whichever you will enter, that is the onedestined for you by immutable Fate, nor can you go back in it save at greatperil to life. These are the things which we would have you know. But, ho,beware! you know not with how much danger you commit yourself to thisway, for if you know yourself to be obnoxious by the smallest fault to thelaws of our King, I beseech you, while it is still possible, to return swiftly toyour house by the way you came.”As soon as I read this writing all my joy nearly vanished again, and I whobefore sang merrily, began now inwardly to lament. For although I saw allthe three ways before me, and understood that henceforward it was vouch-safed to me to choose one of them, yet it troubled me that if I went thestony and rocky way, I might get a miserable and deadly fall, or if I took thelong one, I might wander out of it through byways, or be in other waysdetained in the great journey. Neither could I hope that I amongst thou-sands should be the very one who should choose the royal way. I saw like-"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 11wise the fourth before me, but it was so environed with fire and exaltations,that I did not dare draw near it by much, and therefore again and againconsidered whether I should turn back, or take any of the ways before me.I considered well my own unworthiness, but the dream still comforted methat I was delivered out of the tower; and yet I did not dare confidently relyupon a dream; whereupon I was so perplexed in various ways, that verygreat weariness, hunger and thirst seized me.Whereupon I presently drew out my bread and cut a slice of it; which asnow-white dove of whom I was not aware, sitting upon the tree, saw, andtherewith (perhaps according to her usual manner) came down. She betookherself very familiarly with me, and I willingly imparted my food to her,which she received, and so with her prettiness she again refreshed me a lit-tle. But as soon as her enemy, a most black raven, perceived it, he straight-away darted down upon the dove, and taking no notice of me, would forceaway the dove’s food, and she could not guard herself otherwise than byflight. Whereupon they both flew together towards the south, at which Iwas so hugely incensed and grieved that without thinking what I did, I has-tened after the filthy raven, and so against my will ran into one of the forementioned ways a whole field’s length. And thus the raven having beenchased away, and the dove delivered, I then first observed what I had incon-siderately done, and that I was already entered into a way, from whichunder peril of great punishment I could not retire. And though I had stillwherewith in some measure to comfort myself, yet that which was worst ofall to me was that I had left my bag and bread at the tree, and could neverretrieve them. For as soon as I turned myself about, a contrary wind was sostrong against me that it was ready to fell me. But if I went forward on theway, I perceived no hindrance at all. From which I could easily concludethat it would cost me my life if I should set myself against the wind, where-fore I patiently took up my cross, got up onto my feet, and resolved, sinceso it must be, that I would use my utmost endeavour to get to my journey’send before night. Now although many apparent byways showed themselves, yet I still pro-ceeded with my compass, and would not budge one step from the Merid-ian Line; howbeit the way was often so rugged and impassable, that I was inno little doubt of it. On this way I constantly thought upon the dove andthe raven, and yet could not search out the meaning; until at length upon ahigh hill afar off I saw a stately portal, to which, not regarding how far itwas distant both from me and from the way I was on, I hasted, because the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Page 12sun had already hid himself under the hills, and I could see no abiding placeelsewhere; and this verily I ascribe only to God, who might well have per-mitted me to go forward in this way, and withheld my eyes that so I mighthave gazed beside this gate. To this I now made great haste, and reached it in so much daylight as totake a very competent view of it. Now it was an exceedingly royal beautifulportal, on which were carved a multitude of most noble figures anddevices, every one of which (as I afterwards learned) had its peculiar signifi-cation. Above was fixed a pretty large tablet, with these words, “Proculhinc, procul ite profani” (“keep away, you who are profane”), and otherthings more, that I was earnestly forbidden to relate. Now as soon as I came under the portal, there straightaway stepped forthone in a sky-coloured habit, whom I saluted in a friendly manner; andthough he thankfully returned this salute, yet he instantly demanded of memy letter of invitation. O how glad was I that I had then brought it withme! For how easily might I have forgotten it (as it also chanced to others) ashe himself told me! I quickly presented it, wherewith he was not only satisfied, but (at whichI much wondered) showed me abundance of respect, saying, “Come in mybrother, you are an acceptable guest to me”; and entreated me not to with-hold my name from him. Now I having replied that I was a Brother of theRed-Rosy Cross, he both wondered and seemed to rejoice at it, and thenproceeded thus: “My brother, have you nothing about you with which topurchase a token?” I answered that my ability was small, but if he saw any-thing about me he had a mind to, it was at his service. Now he havingrequested of me my bottle of water, and I having granted it, he gave me agolden token on which stood no more than these two letters, S.C., entreat-ing me that when it stood me in good stead, I would remember him. Afterwhich I asked him how many had come in before me, which he also toldme, and lastly out of mere friendship gave me a sealed letter to the secondPorter. Now having lingered some time with him, the night grew on. Where-upon a great beacon upon the gates was immediately fired, so that if anywere still upon the way, he might make haste thither. But the way, where itfinished at the castle, was enclosed on both sides with walls, and plantedwith all sorts of excellent fruit trees, and on every third tree on each sidelanterns were hung up, in which all the candles were lighted with a glorioustouch by a beautiful Virgin, dressed in sky-colour, which was so noble and"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 13majestic a spectacle that I yet delayed somewhat longer than was requisite.But at length after sufficient information, and an advantageous instruction,I departed friendlily from the first Porter. On the way, I would gladly have known what was written in my letter,yet since I had no reason to mistrust the Porter, I forbare my purpose, andso went on the way, until I came likewise to the second gate, which thoughit was very like the other, yet it was adorned with images and mystic signi-fications. On the affixed tablet was “Date et dabitur vobis” (“give and itshall be given unto you”). Under this gate lay a terrible grim lion chained, who as soon as he sawme arose and made at me with great roaring; whereupon the second Porterwho lay upon a stone of marble woke up, and asked me not to be troubledor afraid, and then drove back the lion; and having received the latterwhich I gave him with trembling, he read it, and with very great respectsaid thus to me: “Now welcome in God’s Name to me the man who for along time I would gladly have seen.” Meanwhile he also drew out a token and asked me whether I could pur-chase it. But having nothing else left but my salt, I presented it to him,which he thankfully accepted. Upon this token again stood only two let-ters, namely, S.M. I was just about to enter into discourse with him, when it began to ringin the castle, whereupon the Porter counseled me to run, or else all thepains and labour I had hitherto undergone would serve to no purpose, forthe lights above were already beginning to be extinguished. Whereupon Iwent with such haste that I did not heed the Porter, I was in such anguish;and truly it was necessary, for I could not run so fast but that the Virgin,after whom all the lights were put out, was at my heels, and I should neverhave found the way, had she not given me some light with her torch. I wasmoreover constrained to enter right next to her, and the gate was suddenlyclapped to, so that a part of my coat was locked out, which I was verilyforced to leave behind me. For neither I, nor they who stood ready withoutand called at the gate, could prevail with the Porter to open it again, but hedelivered the keys to the Virgin, who took them with her into the court. Meanwhile I again surveyed the gate, which now appeared so rich thatthe whole world could not equal it. Just by the door were two columns, onone of which stood a pleasant figure with this inscription, “Congratulor”.The other, which had its countenance veiled, was sad, and beneath waswritten, “Condoleo”. In brief, the inscriptions and figures were so dark"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Page 14and mysterious that the most dextrous man on earth could not haveexpounded them. But all these (if God permits) I shall before long publishand explain. Under this gate I was again to give my name, which was this last timewritten down in a little vellum book, and immediately with the rest des-patched to the Lord Bridegroom. It was here where I first received the trueguest token, which was somewhat smaller than the former, but yet muchheavier. Upon this stood these letters, S.P.N. Besides this, a new pair ofshoes were given me, for the floor of the castle was laid with pure shiningmarble. My old shoes I was to give away to one of the poor who sat inthrongs, although in very good order, under the gate. I then bestowed themupon an old man, after which two pages with as many torches conductedme into a little room. There they asked me to sit down on a form, which I did, but they, stick-ing their torches in two holes, made in the pavement, departed and thus leftme sitting alone. Soon after I heard a noise, but saw nothing, and it provedto be certain men who stumbled in upon me; but since I could see nothing,I had to suffer, and wait to see what they would do with me. But presentlyperceiving them to be barbers, I entreated them not to jostle me so, for Iwas content to do whatever they desired; whereupon they quickly let mego, and so one of them (whom I could not yet see) finely and gently cutaway the hair round about from the crown of my head, but over my fore-head, ears and eyes he permitted my ice-grey locks to hang. In this firstencounter (I must confess) I was ready to despair, for inasmuch as some ofthem shoved me so forcefully, and yet I could see nothing, I could thinknothing other but that God for my curiosity had suffered me to miscarry.Now these invisible barbers carefully gathered up the hair which was cutoff, and carried it away with them. After which the two pages entered again, and heartily laughed at me forbeing so terrified. But they had scarcely spoken a few words with me whenagain a little bell began to ring, which (as the pages informed me) was togive notice for assembling. Whereupon they asked me to rise, and throughmany walks, doors and winding stairs lit my way into a spacious hall. In thisroom was a great multitude of guests, emperors, kings, princes, and lords,noble and ignoble, rich and poor, and all sorts of people, at which I greatlymarvelled, and thought to myself,’ah, how gross a fool you have been toengage upon this journey with so much bitterness and toil, when (behold)here are even those fellows whom you know well, and yet never had any"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Page 15reason to esteem. They are now all here, and you with all your prayers andsupplications have hardly got in at last’. This and more the Devil at thattime injected, while I notwithstanding (as well as I could) directed myselfto the issue. Meanwhile one or other of my acquaintance here and there spoke tome: “Oh Brother Rosencreutz! Are you here too?” “Yes (my brethren),” I replied, “the grace of God has helped me in too”. At which they raised mighty laughter, looking upon it as ridiculous thatthere should be need of God in so slight an occasion. Now havingdemanded each of them concerning his way, and finding that most of themwere forced to clamber over the rocks, certain trumpets (none of which weyet saw) began to sound to the table, whereupon they all seated themselves,every one as he judged himself above the rest; so that for me and someother sorry fellows there was hardly a little nook left at the lowermost table. Presently the two pages entered, and one of them said grace in so hand-some and excellent a manner, that it made the very heart in my bodyrejoice. However, certain great Sr John’s made but little reckoning of them,but jeered and winked at one another, biting their lips within their hats,and using other similar unseemly gestures. After this, meat was brought in,and although no one could be seen, yet everything was so orderly managed,that it seemed to me as if every guest had his own attendant. Now my art-ists having somewhat recreated themselves, and the wine having removed alittle shame from their hearts, they presently began to vaunt and brag oftheir abilities. One would prove this, another that, and commonly the mostsorry idiots made the loudest noise. Ah, when I call to mind what preter-natural and impossible enterprises I then heard, I am still ready to vomit atit. In a word, they never kept in their order, but whenever one rascal here,another there, could insinuate himself in between the nobles, then theypretended to having finished such adventures as neither Samson nor yetHercules with all their strength could ever have achieved: this one woulddischarge Atlas of his burden; the other would again draw forth the three-headed Cerberus out of Hell. In brief, every man had his own prate, andyet the greatest lords were so simple that they believed their pretences, andthe rogues so audacious, that although one or other of them was here andthere rapped over the fingers with a knife, yet they flinched not at it, butwhen anyone perchance had filched a gold-chain, then they would all haz-ard for the same."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Page 16I saw one who heard the rustling of the heavens. The second could seePlato’s Ideas. A third could number Democritus’s atoms. There were alsonot a few pretenders to the perpetual motion. Many a one (in my opinion)had good understanding, but assumed too much to himself, to his owndestruction. Lastly, there was one also who found it necessary to persuadeus out of hand that he saw the servitors who attended us, and would havepersuaded us as to his contention, had not one of these invisible waitersreached him such a handsome cuff upon his lying muzzle, that not only he,but many more who were by him, became as mute as mice. But it pleased me most of all, that all those of whom I had any esteemwere very quiet in their business, and made no loud cry of it, but acknowl-edged themselves to be misunderstanding men, to whom the mysteries ofnature were too high, and they themselves much too small. In this tumult Ihad almost cursed the day when I came here; for I could not behold butwith anguish that those lewd vain people were above at the board, but I inso sorry a place could not rest in quiet, one of those rascals scornfullyreproaching me for a motley fool.Now I did not realise that there was still one gate through which wemust pass, but imagined that during the whole wedding I was to continuein this scorn, contempt and indignity, which I had yet at no time deserved,either from the Lord Bridegroom or the Bride. And therefore (in my opin-ion) he should have done well to sort out some other fool than me to cometo his wedding. Behold, to such impatience the iniquity of this worldreduces simple hearts. But this really was one part of my lameness, of which(as is before mentioned) I dreamed. And truly the longer this clamourlasted, the more it increased. For there were already those who boasted offalse and imaginary visions, and would persuade us of palpably lyingdreams. Now there sat by me a very fine quiet man, who often discoursed ofexcellent matters. At length he said, “Behold my brother, if anyone shouldnow come who were willing to instruct these blockish people in the rightway, would he be heard?” “No, verily”, I replied. “The world,” he said, “is now resolved (whatever comes of it) to becheated, and cannot abide to give ear to those who intend its good. Do yousee that same cocks-comb, with what whimsical figures and foolish conceitshe allures others to him. There one makes mouths at the people withunheard-of mysterious words. Yet believe me in this, the time is now com-ing when those shameful vizards shall be plucked off, and all the world shall"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Page 17know what vagabond impostors were concealed behind them. Then per-haps that will be valued which at present is not esteemed.” Whilst he was speaking in this way, and the longer the clamour lasted theworse it was, all of a sudden there began in the hall such excellent andstately music such as I never heard all the days of my life; whereupon every-one held his peace, and waited to see what would become of it. Now inthis music there were all the sorts of stringed instruments imaginable,which sounded together in such harmony that I forgot myself, and sat soimmovable that those who sat by me were amazed at me; and this lastednearly half an hour, during which time none of us spoke one word. For assoon as anyone at all was about to open his mouth, he got an unexpectedblow, nor did he know where it came from. I thought since we were notpermitted to see the musicians, I should have been glad to view just all theinstruments they were using. After half an hour this music ceased unexpect-edly, and we could neither see or hear anything more. Presently after, a great noise began before the door of the hall, withsounding and beating of trumpets, shalms and kettle-drums, as majestic as ifthe Emperor of Rome had been entering; whereupon the door opened byitself, and then the noise of the trumpets was so loud that we were hardlyable to endure it. Meanwhile (to my thinking) many thousand small tapers came into thehall, all of which themselves marched in so very exact an order as altogetheramazed us, till at last the two aforementioned pages with bright torchesentered the hall, lighting the way of a most beautiful Virgin, all drawn on agloriously gilded triumphant self-moving throne. It seemed to me that shewas the very same who before on the way kindled and put out the lights,and that these attendants of hers were the very same whom she formerlyplaced at the trees. She was not now, as before, in sky-colour, but arrayed ina snow-white glittering robe, which sparkled with pure gold, and cast sucha lustre that we could not steadily look at it. Both the pages were dressed inthe same manner (although somewhat more modestly). As soon as theycame into the middle of the hall, and had descended from the throne, allthe small tapers made obeisance before her. Whereupon we all stood upfrom our benches, yet everyone stayed in his own place. Now she havingshowed to us, and we again to her, all respect and reverence, in a mostpleasant tone she began to speak as follows:The King, my gracious lord He is not far away,"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Page 18Nor is his dearest bride, Betrothed to him in honour. They have now with the greatest joy Beheld your coming hither. Wherefore especially they would proffer Their favour to each one of you, And they desire from their heart’s depth That ye at all times fare ye well, That ye have the coming wedding’s joy Unmixed with others’ sorrow.Hereupon with all her small tapers she courteously bowed again, andsoon after began as follows:Ye know what in the invitation stands: No man hath been called hither Who hath not got from God already All gifts most beautiful, And hath himself adorned aright As well befits him here,Though some may not believe it, That any one so wayward be That on such hard conditions Should dare to make appearance When he hath not prepared himself For this wedding long before. So now they stand in hope That ye be well furnished with all good things, Be glad that in such hard times So many folk be found But men are yet so forward that They care not for their boorishness And thrust themselves in places where They are not called to be. Let no knave be smuggled in No rogue slip in with others. They will declare right openly That they a wedding pure will have,"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Page 19So shall upon the morrow’s morn The artist’s scales be set Wherein each one be weighed And found what he forgotten hath. Of all the host assembled here Who trusts him not in this Let him now stand aside. And should he bide here longer Then he will lose all grace and favour Be trodden underfoot, And he whose conscience pricketh him Shall be left in this hall today And by tomorrow he’ll be freed But let him come hither never again. But he who knows what is behind him Let him go with his servant Who shall attend him to his room And there shall rest him for this day, For he awaits the scales with praise Else will his sleep be mighty hard. Let the others make their comfort here For he who goes beyond his means ’Twere better he had hid away. And now the best from each be hoped.As soon as she had finished saying this, she again made reverence, andsprung cheerfully into her throne, after which the trumpets began to soundagain, which yet was not forceful enough to take the grievous sighs awayfrom many. So they conducted her invisibly away again, but most of thesmall tapers remained in the room, and one of them accompanied each ofus. In such perturbation it is not really possible to express what pensivethoughts and gestures were among us. Yet most of us were resolved to awaitthe scale, and in case things did not work out well, to depart (as theyhoped) in peace. I had soon cast up my reckoning, and since my conscienceconvinced me of all ignorance, and unworthiness, I purposed to stay withthe rest in the hall, and chose rather to content myself with the meal I hadalready taken, than to run the risk of a future repulse. Now after everyone"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Page 20had each been conducted into a chamber (each, as I since understood, intoa particular one) by his small taper, there remained nine of us, and amongthe rest he who discoursed with me at the table too. But although our smalltapers did not leave us, yet soon after an hour’s time one of the aforemen-tioned pages came in, and, bringing a great bundle of cords with him, firstdemanded of us whether we had concluded to stay there; when we hadaffirmed this with sighs, he bound each of us in a particular place, and sowent away with our small tapers, and left us poor wretches in darkness. Then some first began to perceive the imminent danger, and I myselfcould not refrain from tears. For although we were not forbidden to speak,yet anguish and affliction allowed none of us to utter one word. For thecords were so wonderfully made that none could cut them, much less getthem off his feet. Yet this comforted me, that still the future gain of many aone who had now taken himself to rest, would prove very little to his satis-faction. But we by only one night’s penance might expiate all our presump-tion. Till at length in my sorrowful thoughts I fell asleep, during which Ihad a dream. Now although there is no great matter in it, yet I think it notimpertinent to recount it. I thought I was upon a high mountain, and saw before me a great andlarge valley. In this valley were gathered together an unspeakable multitudeof people, each of which had at his head a thread, by which he was hangedfrom Heaven; now one hung high, another low, some stood even almostupon the earth. But through the air flew up and down an ancient man, who had in hishand a pair of shears, with which he cut here one’s, there another’s thread.Now he that was close to the earth was so much more ready, and fell with-out noise, but when it happened to one of the high ones, he fell so that theearth quaked. To some it came to pass that their thread was so stretched thatthey came to the earth before the thread was cut. I took pleasure in thistumbling, and it gave my heart joy, when he who had over-exalted himselfin the air about his wedding got so shameful a fall that it even carried someof his neighbours along with him. In a similar way it also made me rejoice that he who had all this whilekept himself near the earth could come down so finely and gently that eventhe men next to him did not perceive it. But being now in my highest fit of jollity, I was jogged unawares by oneof my fellow captives, upon which I was awakened, and was very much dis-contented with him. However, I considered my dream, and recounted it to"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Page 21my brother, lying by me on the other side, who was not dissatisfied with it,but hoped that some comfort might be meant by it. In such discourse wespent the remaining part of the night, and with longing awaited the day."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Page 22"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Page 23The Third Dayow as soon as the lovely day was broken, and the bright Sun,having raised himself above the hills, had again took himself tohis appointed office in the high Heaven, my good championsbegan to rise out of their beds, and leisurely to make themselvesready for the Inquisition. Whereupon, one after another, they came againinto the hall, and saying good morning, demanded how we had slept thatnight; and having seen our bonds, there were some that reproved us forbeing so cowardly, and because we had not, rather, like them, hazardedupon all adventures. However, some of them whose hearts still smote themmade no loud cry of the business. We excused ourselves with our igno-rance, hoping we should now soon be set at liberty, and learn wisdom bythis disgrace, that they on the contrary had not yet altogether escaped; andperhaps their greatest danger was still to come. At length everyone being assembled again, the trumpets began again tosound and the kettle drums to beat as formerly, and we then imaginednothing other but that the Bridegroom was ready to present himself; whichnevertheless was a huge mistake. For it was again the Virgin of yesterday,who had arrayed herself all in red velvet, and girded herself with a whitescarf. On her head she had a green wreath of laurel, which greatly suitedher. Her train was now no more of small tapers, but consisted of two hun-dred men in armour, who were all (like her) clothed in red and white. Now as soon as they were alighted from the throne, she came straight tous prisoners, and after she had saluted us, she said in few words: “That someof you have been aware of your wretched condition is hugely pleasing tomy most mighty Lord, and he is also resolved you shall fare the better forit”. And having seen me in my habit, she laughed and said, “Goodness! Haveyou also submitted yourself to the yoke? I imagined you would have madeyourself very smug”. With which words she caused my eyes to run over.After which she commanded that we should be unbound, and coupledtogether and placed in a station where we might easily see the Scales. For,she said, it may yet fare better with them, than with the presumptuous whostill stand here at liberty. Meanwhile the scales, which were entirely of gold, were hung up in themiddle of the hall; there was also a little table covered with red velvet, andseven weights placed on it. First of all there was a pretty big one, next fourN"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Page 24little ones, lastly two great ones. And these weights were so heavy in pro-portion to their bulk, that no man can believe or comprehend it. But eachof the armoured men had, together with a naked sword, a strong rope;these she distributed according to the number of weights into seven bands,and out of every band chose one for their own weight; and then againsprang up into her high throne. Now as soon as she had made her rever-ence, in a very shrill tone she began to speak as follows:Whoever goes into an artist’s room And nothing knows of painting And yet will speak with much display Will yet be mocked by everyone. And he who enters artist’s orders Who hath not been selected And begins to paint with much display Will yet be mocked by everyone. And who will to a wedding come And hath not bidden been, And yet doth come with much display Will yet be mocked by everyone. And who will climb upon these scales And find he weigheth not, But is shot up with mighty crash Will yet be mocked by everyone.As soon as the Virgin had finished speaking, one of the pages com-manded each one to place himself according to his order, and one afteranother to step in. Which one of the Emperors made no scruple of, butfirst of all bowed himself a little towards the Virgin, and afterwards in all hisstately attire went up: whereupon each Captain put in his weight, againstwhich (to the wonder of all) he held out. But the last was too heavy forhim, so that he must go forth; and that he did with so much anguish that(as it seemed to me) the Virgin herself had pity on him, and beckoned toher people to hold their peace; yet the good Emperor was bound and deliv-ered over to the Sixth Band. Next after him again there came anotherEmperor, who stepped haughtily into the Scale, and, having a great thickbook under his gown, he imagined he would not fail; but he was scarcelyable to abide the third weight, and was unmercifully flung down, and his"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Page 25book in that upheaval fell from him, and all the soldiers began to laugh, andhe was delivered up bound to the Third Band. Thus it went also with someof the other Emperors, who were all shamefully laughed at and put in cap-tivity. After these there came forth a short little man with a curled brownbeard, also an Emperor, who after the usual reverence got up, and held outso steadfastly, that I thought that had there been more weights ready hewould have outstood them. To him the Virgin immediately arose, andbowed before him, making him put on a gown of red velvet, and finallygave him a branch of laurel, of which she had a good store upon herthrone, upon the steps of which she asked him to sit down. Now how itfared with the rest of the Emperors, Kings and Lords after him, would taketoo long to recount; but I cannot leave unmentioned that few of thosegreat personages held out. However, various eminent virtues (beyond myhopes) were found in many. One could stand out this, the second another,some two, some three, four or five, but few could attain to the just perfec-tion; and everyone who failed was miserably laughed at by the bands. After the Inquisition had also passed over the gentry, the learned, andunlearned, and all the rest, and in each condition perhaps one, it may betwo, but for the most part none, was found perfect, it came at length tothose honest gentlemen the vagabond cheaters, and rascally Lapidem Spi-talanficum makers, who were set upon the Scale with such scorn that Imyself, in spite of all my grief, was ready to burst my belly with laughing,nor could the very prisoners themselves refrain. For the most part couldnot abide that severe trial, but were jerked out of the Scale with whips andscourges, and led to the other prisoners, but to a suitable band. Thus of sogreat a throng so few remained, that I am ashamed to reveal their number.However, there were persons of quality also amongst them, who notwith-standing were (like the rest) honoured with velvet robes and wreaths of lau-rel. The Inquisition being completely finished, and none but we poor cou-pled hounds standing aside, at length one of the Captains stepped forth, andsaid, “Gracious Madam, if it please your Ladyship, let these poor men whoacknowledged their misunderstanding be set upon the Scale too, withouttheir incurring any danger of penalty, and only for recreation’s sake, if per-haps anything that is right may be found amongst them”. In the first place I was in great perplexity, for in my anguish this was myonly comfort, that I was not to stand in such ignominy, or to be lashed out"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Page 26of the Scale. For I did not doubt that many of the prisoners wished thatthey had stayed ten nights with us in the hall. Yet since the Virgin con-sented, so it must be, and we were untied and one after another set up.Now although the most part miscarried, they were neither laughed at, norscourged, but peaceably placed on one side. My companion was the fifth,and he held out bravely, whereupon all, but especially the Captain whomade the request for us, applauded him, and the Virgin showed him theusual respect. After him again two more were dispatched in an instant. ButI was the eighth. Now as soon as (with trembling) I stepped up, my companion whoalready sat by in his velvet looked friendlily upon me, and the Virgin herselfsmiled a little. But for as much as I outstood all the weights, the Virgin commandedthem to draw me up by force, wherefore three men also hung on the otherside of the beam, and yet nothing could prevail. Whereupon one of thepages immediately stood up, and cried out exceedingly loud, “THAT’SHE”: upon which the other replied, “Then let him gain his liberty”; whichthe Virgin accorded. And, being received with due ceremonies, the choicewas given me to release one of the captives, whosoever I pleased; where-upon I made no long deliberation, but elected the first Emperor whom Ihad long pitied, who was immediately set free, and with all respect seatedamongst us.Now the last being set up, and the weights proving too heavy for him, inthe meantime the Virgin had spotted my roses, which I had taken out ofmy hat into my hands, and thereupon presently through her page gra-ciously requested them of me, and I readily sent them to her.And so this first Act was finished about ten in the morning. Whereuponthe trumpets began to sound again, which nevertheless we could not as yetsee. Meantime the bands were to step aside with their prisoners, and awaitthe judgement. After which a council of the seven captains and us was set,and the business was propounded by the Virgin as President, who desiredeach one to give his opinion how the prisoners were to be dealt with. Thefirst opinion was that they should all be put to death, yet one more severelythan another, namely those who had presumptuously intruded themselvescontrary to the express conditions. Others would have them kept closeprisoners. Both of which pleased neither the President, nor me. At lengthby one of the Emperors (the same whom I had freed), my companion, and"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Page 27myself, the affair was brought to this point: that first of all the principalLords should with a fitting respect be led out of the Castle; others might becarried out somewhat more scornfully. These would be stripped, andcaused to run out naked; the fourth should be hunted out with rods, whipsor dogs. Those who the day before willingly surrendered themselves, mightbe allowed to depart without any blame. And last of all those presumptuousones, and they who behaved themselves so unseemly at dinner the daybefore, should be punished in body and life according to each man’sdemerit. This opinion pleased the Virgin well, and obtained the upperhand. There was moreover another dinner vouchsafed them, which theywere soon told about. But the execution was deferred till twelve noon. Herewith the Senate arose, and the Virgin also, together with her atten-dants, returned to her usual quarter. But the uppermost table in the roomwas allotted to us, they requesting us to take it in good part until the busi-ness was fully dispatched. And then we should be conducted to the LordBridegroom and the Bride, with which we were at present well content.Meanwhile the prisoners were again brought into the hall, and each manseated according to his quality. They were likewise told to behave them-selves somewhat more civilly than they had done the day before, aboutwhich they yet did not need to have been admonished, for without this,they had already put up their pipes. And this I can boldly say, not with flattery, but in the love of truth, thatcommonly those persons who were of the highest rank best understoodhow to behave themselves in so unexpected a misfortune. Their treatmentwas but indifferent, yet respectful; neither could they yet see their atten-dants, but to us they were visible, at which I was exceedingly joyful. Nowalthough Fortune had exalted us, yet we did not take upon us more thanthe rest, advising them to be of good cheer, the event would not be so bad.Now although they would gladly have us reveal their sentence, yet we wereso deeply obligated that none of us dared open his mouth about it. Nevertheless we comforted them as well as we could, drinking withthem to see if the wine might make them any more cheerful. Our table wascovered with red velvet, beset with drinking cups of pure silver and gold,which the rest could not behold without amazement and very greatanguish. But before we had seated ourselves, in came the two pages, pre-senting everyone on the Bridegroom’s behalf with the Golden Fleece witha flying Lion, requesting us to wear them at the table, and as became us, toobserve the reputation and dignity of the Order which his Majesty had now"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Page 28vouchsafed us; and we should be ratified with suitable ceremonies. This wereceived with profoundest submission, promising obediently to performwhatsoever his Majesty should please. Besides these, the noble page had aschedule in which we were set down in order. And for my part I should nototherwise wish to conceal my place, if perhaps it might not be interpretedas pride in me, which is expressly against the fourth weight. Now because our entertainment was exceedingly stately, we demandedof one of the pages whether we might not have leave to send some choicebit to our friends and acquaintances; he made no difficulty of it, and every-one sent plentifully to his acquaintances by the waiters, although they sawnone of them; and because they did not know where it came from, I myselfwished to carry something to one of them. But as soon as I had risen, oneof the waiters was at my elbow, saying he desired me to take friendly warn-ing, for if one of the pages had seen it, it would have come to he King’s ear,who would certainly have taken it amiss of me; but since none hadobserved it but himself, he did not intend to betray me, but that I ought forthe time to come to have better regard for the dignity of the order. Withwhich words the servant really astonished me so much that for a long timeafterwards I scarcely moved in my seat, yet I returned him thanks for hisfaithful warning, as well as I was able in my haste and fear. Soon after, the drums began to beat again, to which we were alreadyaccustomed: for we knew well it was the Virgin, so we prepared ourselvesto receive her; she was now coming in with her usual train, upon her highseat, one of the pages bearing before her a very tall goblet of gold, and theother a patent in parchment. Having alighted from the seat in a marvellousskillful manner, she took the goblet from the page, and presented the sameon the King’s behalf, saying that it was brought from his Majesty, and that inhonour of him we should cause it to go round. Upon the cover of this gob-let stood Fortune curiously cast in gold, who had in her hand a red flyingensign, because of which I drunk somewhat more sadly, having been all toowell acquainted with Fortune’s waywardness. But the Virgin as well as uswas adorned with the Golden Fleece and Lion, from which I observed thatperhaps she was the president of the Order. So we asked of her how theOrder might be named. She answered that it was not yet the right time toreveal this, till the affair with the prisoners was dispatched. And thereforetheir eyes were still veiled; and what had hitherto happened to us, was tothem only like an offence and scandal, although it was to be accounted asnothing in regard to the honour that attended us. Hereupon she began to"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Page 29distinguish the patent which the other page held into two different parts,out of which about this much was read before the first company: “That they should confess that they had too lightly given credit to falsefictitious books, had assumed too much to themselves, and so come intothis Castle, although they were never invited into it, and perhaps the mostpart had presented themselves with design to make their market here, andafterwards to live in greater pride and lordliness; and thus one had seducedanother, and plunged him into this disgrace and ignominy, wherefore theywere deservedly to be soundly punished.”Which they with great humility readily acknowledged, and gave theirhands upon it. After which a severe check was given to the rest, much tothis purpose: “That they very well knew, and were in their consciences convinced,that they had forged false fictitious books, had fooled others, and cheatedthem, and thereby had diminished regal dignity amongst all. They knewlikewise what ungodly deceitful figures they had made use of, in so much asthey spared not even the Divine Trinity, but accustomed themselves tocheat people all the country over. It was also now as clear as day with whatpractices they had endeavoured to ensnare the true guests, and introducethe ignorant: in such a manner that it was manifest to all the world that theywallowed in open whoredom, adultery, gluttony, and other uncleannesses:All which was against the express orders of our Kingdom. In brief, theyknew they had disparaged Kingly Majesty, even amongst the common sort,and therefore they should confess themselves to be manifest convicted vag-abond-cheaters, knaves and rascals, whereby they deserved to be kept fromthe company of civil people, and severely punished.” The good artists were loath to come to this confession, but inasmuch asnot only the Virgin herself threatened them, and swore that they would die,but the other party also vehemently raged at them, and unanimously criedout that they had most wickedly seduced them out of the Light, they atlength, to prevent a huge misfortune, confessed the same with sadness, andyet withal alleged that what had happened here was not to be animadvertedupon them in the worst sense. For inasmuch as the Lords were absolutelyresolved to get into the Castle, and had promised great sums of money tothat effect, each one had used all craft to seize upon something, and sothings were brought to that state that was now manifest before their eyes.But just because it had not succeeded, “They”, in their opinion, “haddeserved no less than the Lords themselves; Who should have had so much"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Page 30understanding as to consider that, if anyone could be sure of getting in, heshould not have clambered over the wall with them, that there should be sogreat peril for the sake of a slight gain?” Their books also sold so well, that whoever had no other means tomaintain himself, had to engage in such a deception. They hoped more-over, that if a right judgement were made, they should be found in no wayto have miscarried, for they had behaved themselves towards the Lords, asbecame Servants, upon their earnest entreaty.But answer was made to them that his Royal Majesty had determined topunish them all, every man, although one more severely than another. Foralthough what had been alleged by them was partly true, and therefore theLords should not wholly be indulged, yet they had good reason to preparethemselves for death, they who had so presumptuously obtruded them-selves, and perhaps seduced the more ignorant against their will; as likewisethose who had violated Royal Majesty with false books, for the same mightbe shown from their very writings and books. Hereupon many began to lament, cry, weep, entreat and prostrate them-selves most piteously, all of which notwithstanding could avail them noth-ing, and I marvelled much how the Virgin could be so resolute, when theirmisery caused our eyes to run over, and moved our compassion (althoughthe most part of them had procured us much trouble and vexation). For shepresently dispatched her page, who brought with him all the Cuirassierswho had this day been appointed at the Scales, who were each of themcommanded to take his own to him, and in an orderly procession, so thateach Cuirassier should go with one of the prisoners, to conduct them intoher great garden. At which time each one so exactly recognised his ownman, that I marvelled at it. Leave was also likewise given to my companionsof yesterday to go out into the garden unbound, and to be present at theexecution of the sentence. Now as soon as every man had come forth, theVirgin mounted up into her high throne, requesting us to sit down uponthe steps, and to appear at the judgement; which we did not refuse, but lefteverything standing upon the table (except the goblet, which the Virgincommitted to the pages’ keeping) and went forth in our robes, upon thethrone, which moved by itself as gently as if we passed through the air, tillin this manner we came into the garden, where we all arose together. This garden was not extraordinarily curious, but it pleased me that thetrees were planted in such good order. Besides, there ran in it a most costlyfountain, adorned with wonderful figures and inscriptions and strange char-"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Page 31acters (which, God willing, I shall mention in a future book). In this gardenwas raised a wooden scaffold, hung about with curiously painted figuredcoverlets. Now there were four galleries made one over another; the firstwas more glorious than any of the rest, and therefore covered with a whitetaffeta curtain, so that at that time we could not perceive who was behindit. The second was empty and uncovered. Again the last two were coveredwith red and blue taffeta. Now as soon as we had come to the scaffold, theVirgin bowed herself down to the ground, at which we were mightily ter-rified, for we could easily guess that the King and Queen must not be faroff. Now we also having duly performed our reverence, the Virgin led usup by the winding stairs into the second gallery, where she placed herselfuppermost, and us in our former order. But how the Emperor whom I hadreleased behaved himself towards me, both at this time and also before atthe table, I cannot well relate without slander of wicked tongues. For hemight well have imagined in what anguish and solicitude he should nowhave been, in case he were at present to attend the judgement with suchignominy, and that only through me he had now attained such dignity andworthiness.Meanwhile the Virgin who first of all brought me the invitation, andwhom until now I had never since seen, came in. First she gave one blastupon her trumpet, and then with a very loud voice declared the sentence inthis manner: “The King’s Majesty my most gracious Lord could wish with all hisheart that each and every one here assembled had upon his Majesty’s invita-tion presented themselves so qualified as that they might (to his honour)with greatest frequency have adorned this his appointed nuptial and joyfulfeast. But since it has otherwise pleased Almighty God, his Majesty hasnothing about which to murmur, but must be forced, contrary to his owninclination, to abide by the ancient and laudable constitutions of this King-dom. But now, so that his Majesty’s innate clemency may be celebrated allover the world, he has so far absolutely dealt with his Council and estates,that the usual sentence shall be considerably lenified. So in the first place he is willing to vouchsafe to the Lords and Poten-tates, not only their lives entirely, but also that he will freely and frankly dis-miss them; friendlily and courteously entreating your Lordships not at all totake it in evil part that you cannot be present at his Majesty’s Feast ofHonour; but to remember that there is notwithstanding more imposedupon your Lordships by God Almighty (who in the distribution of his gifts"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Page 32has an incomprehensible consideration) than you can duly and easily sus-tain. Neither is your reputation hereby prejudiced, although you berejected by this our Order, since we cannot all of us do all things at once.But for as much as your Lordships have been seduced by base rascals, it shallnot, on their part, pass unrevenged. And furthermore his Majesty resolvesshortly to communicate to your Lordships a catalogue of heretics or IndexExpurgatorius, that you may henceforth be able to discern between thegood and the evil with better judgement. And because his Majesty beforelong also intends to rummage his library, and offer up the seductive writ-ings to Vulcan, he friendlily, humbly, and courteously entreats every one ofyour Lordships to do the same with your own, whereby it is to be hopedthat all evil and mischief may for the time to come be remedied. And youare withal to be admonished, never henceforth to covet an entrance here soinconsiderately, lest the former excuse about seducers be taken from you,and you fall into disgrace and contempt with all men. Finally, for as muchas the estates of the land still have something to demand of your Lordships,his Majesty hopes that no man will think much to redeem himself with achain or whatever else he has about him, and so in friendly manner todepart from us, and through our safe conduct to take himself home again. The others who did not stand up to the first, third and fourth weight, hisMajesty will not so lightly dismiss. But so that they also may now experi-ence his Majesty’s gentleness, it is his command to strip them stark nakedand so send them forth. Those who in the second and fifth weight were found too light, shallbesides stripping, be noted with one, two or more brand-marks, accordingas each one was lighter or heavier. They who were drawn up by the sixth or seventh, and not by the rest,shall be somewhat more graciously dealt with, and so forward. (For toevery combination there was a certain punishment ordained, which is heretoo long to recount.) They who yesterday separated themselves freely of their own accord,shall go out at liberty without any blame. Finally, the convicted vagabond-cheaters who could move up none ofthe weights, shall as occasion serves be punished in body and life, with thesword, halter, water and rods. And such execution of judgement shall beinviolably observed as an example to others.”"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Page 33Herewith our Virgin broke her wand, and the other who read the sen-tence blew her trumpet, and stepped with most profound reverencetowards those who stood behind the curtain. But here I cannot omit to reveal something to the reader concerning thenumber of our prisoners, of whom those who weighed one, were seven;those who weighed two, were twenty one; they who three, thirty five; theywho four, thirty five; those who five, twenty one; those who six, seven; buthe that came to the seventh, and yet could not well raise it, he was onlyone, and indeed the same whom I released. Besides these, of them whowholly failed there were many; but of those who drew all the weights fromthe ground, but few. And as these each stood before us, so I diligently num-bered them and noted them down in my table-book; and it is very admira-ble that amongst all those who weighed anything, none was equal toanother. For although amongst those who weighed three, there were thirtyfive, yet one of them weighed the first, second, and third, another the third,fourth, and fifth, a third, the fifth, sixth, and seventh, and so on. It is like-wise very wonderful that amongst one hundred and twenty six whoweighed anything, none was equal to another; and I would very willinglyname them all, with each man’s weight, were it not as yet forbidden me.But I hope it may hereafter be published with the Interpretation. Now this judgement being read over, the Lords in the first place werewell satisfied, because in such severity they did not dare look for a mild sen-tence. So they gave more than was desired of them, and each one redeemedhimself with chains, jewels, gold, money and other things, as much as theyhad about them, and with reverence took leave. Now although the King’sservants were forbidden to jeer at any at his going away, yet some unluckybirds could not hold their laughter, and certainly it was sufficiently ridicu-lous to see them pack away with such speed, without once looking behindthem. Some desired that the promised catalogue might at once be dis-patched after them, and then they would take such order with their booksas should be pleasing to his Majesty; which was again assured. At the doorwas given to each of them out of a cup a draught of FORGETFULNESS,so that he might have no further memory of misfortune. After these the Voluntiers departed, who because of their ingenuity wereallowed to pass, but yet so as never to return again in the same fashion. Butif to them (as likewise to the others) anything further were revealed, thenthey should be welcome guests."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Page 34Meanwhile others were stripping, in which also an inequality (accordingto each man’s demerit) was observed. Some were sent away naked, withoutother hurt. Others were driven out with small bells. Some were scourgedforth. In brief the punishments were so various, that I am not able torecount them all. In the end it came to the last, with whom a somewhatlonger time was spent, for while some were being hung, some beheaded,some forced to leap into the water, and the rest otherwise being dispatched,much time was consumed. Verily at this execution my eyes ran over, notindeed in regard of the punishment, which they for their impudency welldeserved, but in contemplation of human blindness, in that we are continu-ally busying ourselves in that which ever since the first Fall has been hith-erto sealed up to us. Thus the garden which so recently was quite full, wassoon emptied, so that besides the soldiers there was not a man left. Now as soon as this was done, and silence had been kept for the space offive minutes, there came forth a beautiful snow-white unicorn with agolden collar (having on it certain letters) about his neck. In the same placehe bowed himself down upon both his forefeet, as if hereby he had shownhonour to the lion, who stood so immoveably upon the fountain, that I hadtaken him to be of stone or brass. The lion immediately took the nakedsword which he had in his paw, and broke it in two in the middle, and thepieces of it, it seemed to me, sunk into the fountain; after which he roaredfor so long, until a white dove brought a branch of olive in her bill, whichthe lion devoured in an instant, and so was quieted. And so the unicornreturned to his place with joy. Hereupon our Virgin led us down again by the winding stairs from thescaffold, and so we again made our reverence towards the curtain. We wereto wash our hands and heads in the fountain, and there to wait a little whilein our order, till the King was again returned into his hall through a certainsecret gallery, and then we were also conducted into our former lodgingwith choice music, pomp, state, and pleasant discourse. And this was doneabout four in the afternoon. But so that in the meantime the time might not seem too long to us, theVirgin bestowed on each of us a noble page, who were not only richlydressed, but also exceedingly learned, so that they could so aptly discourseupon all subjects that we had good reason to be ashamed of ourselves.These were commanded to lead us up and down the Castle, but only intocertain places, and if possible, to shorten the time according to our desire.Meanwhile the Virgin took leave with this consolation, that at supper she"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Page 35would be with us again, and after that celebrate the ceremonies of thehanging up of the weights, requesting that we would in patience wait tillthe next day, for on the morrow we must be presented to the King. She having thus departed from us, each of us did what best pleased him.One part viewed the excellent paintings, which they copied out for them-selves, and considered also what the wonderful characters might signify.Others wanted to occupy themselves again with meat and drink. I caused my page to conduct me (together with my companion) up anddown the Castle, which walk I shall never regret as long as I have a day tolive. For besides many other glorious antiquities, the Royal Sepulchre wasalso showed to me, by which I learned more than is extant in all books.There in the same place stands also the glorious phoenix (about which, twoyears ago, I published a particular small discourse). And I am resolved (incase this narration shall prove useful) to set forth several particular treatisesconcerning the lion, eagle, griffin, falcon and the like, together with theirdraughts and inscriptions. It grieves me for my other companions, that theyneglected such precious treasures. And yet I cannot but think it was thespecial will of God that it should be so. I indeed reaped the most benefitfrom my page, for according as each one’s genius lay, so he led whoever wasentrusted to him into the quarters and places which were pleasing to him.Now the keys belonging hereunto were committed to my page, and there-fore this good fortune happened to me before the rest; for although heinvited others to come in, yet they imagining such tombs to be only in thechurchyard, thought they should get there well enough, whenever anythingwas to be seen there. Neither shall these monuments (as both of us copiedand transcribed them) be withheld from my thankful scholars. The other thing that was shown to us two was the noble library as it wasall together before the Reformation. Of which (although it makes my heartrejoice as often as I call it to mind) I have so much the less to say, becausethe catalogue of it is very shortly to be published. At the entry to this roomstands a great book, the like of which I never saw, in which all the figures,rooms, portals, also all the writings, riddles and the like, to be seen in thewhole Castle, are delineated. Now although we made a promise concern-ing this also, yet at present I must contain myself, and first learn to knowthe world better. In every book stands its author painted; of which (as Iunderstood) many were to be burnt, so that even their memory might beblotted out from amongst the righteous."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Page 36Now having taken a full view of this, and having scarcely gone forth,another page came running to us, and having whispered something in ourpage’s ear, he delivered up the keys to him, who immediately carried themup the winding stairs. But our page was very much out of countenance,and we having set hard upon him with entreaties, he declared to us that theKing’s Majesty would by no means permit that either of the two, namelythe library and sepulchres, should be seen by any man, and therefore hebesought us as we cared for his life, to reveal this to no man, he havingalready utterly denied it. Whereupon both of us stood hovering betweenjoy and fear, yet it continued in silence, and no man made further enquiryabout it. Thus in both places we passed three hours, which I do not at allrepent. Now although it had already struck seven, yet nothing had so far beengiven us to eat; however, our hunger was easy to abate by constant reviv-ings, and I could be well content to fast all my life long with such enter-tainment. About this time the curious fountains, mines, and all kinds of art-shops, were also shown to us, of which there was none but surpassed all ourarts, even if they should all be melted into one mass. All their chamberswere built in a semi-circle, so that they might have before their eyes thecostly clockwork which was erected upon a fair turret in the centre, andregulate themselves according to the course of the planets, which were tobe seen on it in a glorious manner. And hence I could easily conjecturewhere our artists failed; however it’s none of my duty to inform them. At length I came into a spacious room (shown indeed to the rest a greatwhile before) in the middle of which stood a terrestrial globe, whose diam-eter was thirty feet, although nearly half of it, except a little which was cov-ered with the steps, was let into the earth. Two men might readily turn thisglobe about with all its furniture, so that no more of it was ever to be seen,just so much as was above the horizon. Now although I could easily con-ceive that this was of some special use, yet I could not understand whatthose ringlets of gold (which were upon it in several places) served for; atwhich my page laughed, and advised me to view them more closely. Inbrief, I found there my native country noted in gold also; whereupon mycompanion sought his, and found that so too. Now for as much as the same happened in a similar way to the rest whostood by, the page told us for certain that it was yesterday declared to theKing’s Majesty by their old Atlas (so is the Astronomer named) that all thegilded points exactly answered to their native countries, according as had"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Page 37been shown to each of them. And therefore he also, as soon as he perceivedthat I undervalued myself and that nevertheless there stood a point uponmy native country, moved one of the Captains to entreat for us that weshould be set upon the scale (without peril) at all adventures; especially see-ing one of our native countries had a notable good mark. And truly it wasnot without reason that he, the page who had the greatest power of all therest, was bestowed on me. For this I then returned him thanks, and imme-diately looked more diligently upon my native country, and found more-over that besides the ringlet, there were also certain delicate streaks upon it,which nevertheless I would not be thought to speak about to my ownpraise and glory. I saw much more too upon this globe than I am willing to reveal. Leteach man take into consideration why every city does not produce a philos-opher. After this he led us right into the globe, which was thus made: onthe sea (there being a large square beside it) was a tablet, on which stoodthree dedications and the author’s name, which a man might gently lift upand by a little joined board go into the centre, which was capable of hold-ing four persons, being nothing but a round board on which we could sit,and at ease, by broad daylight (it was now already dark) contemplate thestars. To my thinking they were mere carbuncles which glittered in anagreeable order, and moved so gallantly that I had scarcely any mind ever togo out again, as the page afterwards told the Virgin, with which she oftenteased me. For it was already supper-time, and I had so much amusedmyself in the globe, that I was almost the last at the table; so I made nomore delay, but having put on my gown again (which I had before laidaside) and stepping to the table, the waiters treated me with so much rever-ence and honour, that for shame I dared not look up, and so unawares per-mitted the Virgin, who attended me on one side, to stand, which she soonperceiving, twitched me by the gown, and so led me to the table. To speakany further concerning the music, or the rest of that magnificent entertain-ment, I hold it needless, both because it is not possible to express it wellenough, and because I have reported it above according to my power. Inbrief, there was nothing there but art and amenity. Now after we had related our employment since noon to each other(however, not a word was spoken of the library and monuments), beingalready merry with the wine, the Virgin began thus: “My Lords, I have agreat contention with one of my sisters. In our chamber we have an eagle.Now we cherish him with such diligence, that each of us is desirous to be"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Page 38the best beloved, and upon that score we have many a squabble. One daywe concluded to go both together to him, and toward whom he shouldshow himself most friendly, hers should he properly be. This we need, andI (as commonly) carried in my hand a branch of laurel, but my sister hadnone. Now as soon as he saw us both, he immediately gave my sisteranother branch which he had in his beak, and reached for mine, which Igave him. Now each of us hereupon imagined herself to be best beloved of him;which way am I to resolve myself? “This modest proposal of the Virgin pleased us all mighty well, and eachone would gladly have heard the solution, but inasmuch as they all lookedto me, and wanted me to begin, my mind was so extremely confoundedthat I knew not what else to do with it but propound another in its stead,and therefore said: “Gracious Lady, your Ladyship’s question would easily be resolved if onething did not perplex me. I had two companions, both of which loved meexceedingly; now they being doubtful which of them was most dear to me,concluded to run to me, I unawares, and that he whom I should thenembrace should be the right. This they did, yet one of them could not keeppace with the other, so he stayed behind and wept, the other I embracedwith amazement. Now when they had afterwards discovered the business tome, I did not know how to resolve myself, and have since then let it rest inthis manner, until I may find some good advice herein”. The Virgin wondered at it, and well observed whereabout I was, where-upon she replied, “Well then, let us both be quit”; and then desired thesolution from the rest. But I had already made them wise. So the next began thus. “In the citywhere I live, a Virgin was recently condemned to death, but the Judge,being somewhat pitiful towards her, caused it to be proclaimed that if anyman desired to become the Virgin’s Champion, he should have free leave todo it. Now she had two lovers; the one presently made himself ready, andcame into the lists to await his adversary; afterwards the other also presentedhimself, but coming somewhat too late, he resolved nevertheless to fight,and willingly suffer himself to be vanquished, so that the Virgin’s life mightbe preserved, which also succeeded accordingly”. Whereupon each challenged her: “Now my Lords, instruct me, towhich of them of right does she belong?”"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Page 39The Virgin could hold out no longer, but said, “I thought to havegained much information, and have got myself into the net, but yet wouldgladly hear whether there are any more to come.” “Yes, that there are”, answered the third, “a stranger adventure has notyet been recounted than that which happened to me. In my youth I loved aworthy maid: now so that my love might attain its desired end, I used toemploy an ancient matron, who easily brought me to her. Now it hap-pened that the maid’s brethren came in upon us just as we three weretogether, and were in such a rage that they would have taken my life, butupon my vehement supplication, they at length forced me to swear to takeeach of them for a year, to be my wedded wife. Now tell me, my Lords, should I take the old, or the young one first?” We all laughed sufficiently at this riddle, and though some of them mut-tered to one another about it, yet none would undertake to unfold it. Hereupon the fourth began: “In a certain city there dwelt an honourablelady, who was beloved of all, but especially by a young nobleman, who wastoo importunate with her. At length she gave him this determination, thatif he could lead her into a fair green garden of roses in a cold winter, thenhe should obtain what he desired, but if not, he must resolve never to seeher again. The nobleman traveled to all countries to find such a man asmight perform this, till at length he found a little old man that promised todo it for him, if he would assure him of half his estate; which he havingconsented to the other, was as good as his word. Whereupon he invited theaforesaid lady to his garden, where, contrary to her expectation, she foundall things green, pleasant and warm, and remembering her promise, sheonly requested that she might once more return to her lord, to whom withsighs and tears she bewailed her lamentable condition. But because he suffi-ciently perceived her faithfulness, he dispatched her back to her lover whohad so dearly purchased her, so that she might give him satisfaction. Thishusband’s integrity did so mightily affect the nobleman, that he thought it asin to touch so honest a wife; so he sent her home again with honour toher lord. Now the little man perceiving such faith in both these, would not,however poor he was, be the least in honour, but restored to the noblemanall his goods again and went his way. Now, my lords, I know not which ofthese persons may have shown the greatest ingenuity?” Here our tongues were quite cut off. Neither would the Virgin makeany other reply, but only that another should go on."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Page 40So the fifth, without delay, began: “My Lords, I do not wish to makelong work of this; who has the greater joy, he that beholds what he loves, orhe that only thinks on it?” “He that beholds it,” said the Virgin. “No,” I answered. Hereupon a debate arose, so the sixth called out, “My lords, I am to takea wife; now I have before me a maid, a married wife, and a widow; ease meof this doubt, and I will afterwards help to order the rest.” “It goes well there,” replied the seventh, “where a man has a choice, butwith me the case is otherwise. In my youth I loved a fair and virtuous vir-gin from the bottom of my heart, and she loved me in similar manner;however, because of her friends’ denial we could not come together inwedlock. Whereupon she was married to another, yet an honest and dis-creet person, who maintained her honourably and with affection, until shecame to the pains of childbirth, which went so hard for her that all thoughtshe was dead, so with much state and great mourning she was interred.Now I thought to myself, during her life you could have no part in thiswoman, but now she is dead you may embrace and kiss her sufficiently; so Itook my servant with me, who dug her up by night. Now having openedthe coffin and locked her in my arms, feeling about her heart, I found somelittle motion in it still, which increased more and more from my warmth,till at last I perceived that she was indeed still alive. So I quietly bore herhome, and after I had warmed her chilled body with a costly bath of herbs,I committed her to my mother until she brought forth a fair son, whom Icaused to be nursed faithfully, as for his mother. After two days (she beingthen in great amazement) I revealed to her all the preceding affair, request-ing her for the time to come to live with me as a wife; against which shefound exception, in case it should be grievous to her husband who hadmaintained her well and honourably. But if it could be otherwise, she wasobliged in love at present to one as well as the other. Now after two months(being then about to make a journey elsewhere) I invited her husband as aguest, and amongst other things demanded of him whether, if his deceasedwife should come home again, he would be content to receive her. Heaffirmed it with tears and lamentations, and I brought him his wife togetherwith his son, and gave an account of all the preceding business, entreatinghim to ratify with his consent my intended espousals. After a long disputehe could not deny me my right, but had to leave me his wife. But there wasstill a debate about the son.”"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Page 41Here the Virgin interrupted him, and said, “It makes me wonder howyou could double the afflicted man’s grief.” “What,” he answered, “Was I not concerned about it?” Upon this therearose a dispute amongst us, yet most affirmed that he had done right. “No,”he said, “I freely returned him both his wife and his son. Now tell me, myLords, was my honesty, or this man’s joy, the greater?”These words had so much cheered the Virgin that (as if it had been forthe sake of these two) she caused a health to be drunk. After which the rest of the proposals went on somewhat perplexedly, sothat I could not retain them all; yet this comes to my mind, that one saidthat a few years before he had seen a physician, who brought a parcel ofwood against winter, with which he warmed himself all winter long; but assoon as the spring returned he sold the very same wood again, and so haduse of it for nothing. “Here there must be skill,” said the Virgin, “but the time is now past.”“Ye s ,” replied my companion, “whoever does not understand how toresolve all the riddles may give each man notice of it by a proper messenger,and he will not be denied.” At this time they began to say grace, and we arose all together from thetable, satisfied and merry rather than satiated; and it is to be wished that allinvitations and feastings were kept like this. Having now taken a few turnsup and down the hall again, the Virgin asked us whether we desired tobegin the wedding. “Yes, noble and virtuous lady,” said one. Whereupon she privately des-patched a page, and yet in the meantime proceeded in discourse with us. Inbrief she had already become so familiar with us, that I ventured to requesther Name. The Virgin smiled at my curiosity, but yet was not moved, butreplied: “My Name contains five and fifty, and yet has only eight letters; thethird is the third part of the fifth, which added to the sixth will produce anumber whose root shall exceed the third itself by just the first, and it is thehalf of the fourth. Now the fifth and the seventh are equal, the last and thefifth are also equal, and make with the second as much as the sixth, whichcontains just four more than the third tripled. Now tell me, my lord, whatam I called?” The answer was intricate enough to me, yet I did not leave off, but said,“Noble and virtuous lady, may I not have only one letter?” “Ye s”, she said, “that may well be done”."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Page 42“What then,” I replied again, “may the seventh contain?” “It contains”, she said, “as many as there are lords here”. With this I was content, and easily found her Name, at which she wasvery pleased, and assured us that much more should yet be revealed to us. Meantime certain virgins had made themselves ready, and came in withgreat ceremony. First of all two youths carried lights before them; one ofthem was of jocund countenance, sprightly eyes and gentle proportion.The other looked rather angry, and whatever he would have, must be, as Iafterwards perceived. After them first followed four virgins. One looked shame-facedlytowards the earth, very humble in behaviour. The second also was a mod-est, bashful virgin. The third, as she entered the room, seemed amazed at something, and asI understood, she cannot easily abide where there is too much mirth. Thefourth brought with her certain small wreaths, thereby to manifest herkindness and liberality. After these four came two who were somewhat more gloriously appar-eled; they saluted us courteously. One of them had a gown of sky colourspangled with golden stars. The other’s was green, beautified with red andwhite stripes. On their heads they had thin flying tiffaties, which adornedthem most becomingly. At last came one on her own, who had a coronet on her head, butlooked up rather towards heaven than towards earth. We all thought it wasthe Bride, but were much mistaken, although otherwise in honour, richesand state she much surpassed the Bride; and she afterwards ruled the wholeWedding. Now on this occasion we all followed our Virgin, and fell downon our knees; however, she showed herself to be extremely humble, offer-ing everyone her hand, and admonishing us not to be too much surprisedat this, for this was one of her smallest bounties; but to lift up our eyes toour Creator, and learn hereby to acknowledge his omnipotency, and soproceed in our enterprised course, employing this grace to the praise ofGod, and the good of man. In sum, her words were quite different fromthose of our Virgin, who was somewhat more worldly. They pierced methrough even to my bones and marrow. “And you,” she said further to me, “have received more than others, seethat you also make a larger return.” This to me was a very strange sermon;for as soon as we saw the virgins with the music, we imagined we mustsoon begin to dance, but that time was not as yet come. Now the weights,"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Page 43which have been mentioned before, stood still in the same place, so theDuchess (I knew not yet who she was) commanded each virgin to take upone, but to our Virgin she gave her own, which was the last and greatest,and commanded us to follow behind. Our majesty was then somewhatabated, for I observed well that our Virgin was too good for us, and wewere not so highly reputed as we ourselves were almost in part willing tofantasise. So we went behind in our order, and were brought into the firstchamber, where our Virgin in the first place hung up the Duchess’ weight,during which an excellent spiritual hymn was sung. There was nothingcostly in this room save only curious little prayer books which should neverbe missing. In the middle was erected a pulpit, very convenient for prayer, in whichthe Duchess kneeled down, and about her we all had to kneel and prayafter the Virgin, who read out of a book, that this Wedding might tend tothe honour of God, and our own benefit. Afterwards we came into the sec-ond chamber, where the first Virgin hung up her weight too, and so for-ward until all the ceremonies were finished. Hereupon the Duchess againpresented her hand to everyone, and departed hence with her virgin. Our president stayed yet a while with us. But because it had already beennight for two hours, she would no longer detain us. I thought she was gladof our company, yet she bade us good night, and wished us quiet rest, andso departed friendlily, although unwillingly, from us. Our pages were wellinstructed in their business, and therefore showed every man his chamber,and stayed with us too in another bed, so that in case we wanted anythingwe might make use of them. My chamber (of the rest I am not able tospeak) was royally furnished with rare tapestries, and hung about withpaintings. But above all things I delighted in my page, who was so excel-lently spoken, and experienced in the arts, that he spent yet another hourwith me, and it was half past three when I first fell asleep. And this was thefirst night that I slept in quiet, and yet a scurvy dream would not let merest; for all the night I was troubled with a door which I could not getopen, but at last I did it. With these fantasies I passed the time, till at lengthtowards day I awakened."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Page 44"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Page 45The Fourth Day was still lying in my bed, and leisurely surveying all the nobleimages and figures up and down about my chamber, when sud-denly I heard the music of coronets, as if they were already inprocession. My page jumped out of the bed as if he had been athis wit’s end, and looked more like one dead than living. In what state I wasthen is easily imaginable, for he said, “The rest are already presented to theKing.” I did not know what else to do but weep outright and curse myown slothfulness; yet I dressed myself, but my page was ready long beforeme, and ran out of the chamber to see how affairs might yet stand. But hesoon returned, and brought with him this joyful news, that indeed the timewas not yet, but I had only overslept my breakfast, they being unwilling toawaken me because of my age. But now it was time for me to go with him to the fountain where mostof them were assembled. With this consolation my spirit returned again, soI was soon ready with my habit, and went after the page to the fountain inthe aforementioned garden, where I found that the lion, instead of hissword, had a pretty large tablet by him. Now having looked well at it, Ifound that it was taken out of the ancient monuments, and placed here forsome special honour. The inscription was somewhat worn out with age,and therefore I have a mind to set it down here, as it is, and give everyoneleave to consider it. (“Hermes the Prince. After so many wounds inflicted on humankind,here by God’s counsel and the help of the Art flow I, a healing medicine.Let him drink me who can: let him wash who will: let him trouble mewho dare: drink, brethren and live”.) This writing might well be read and understood, and may therefore suit-ably be placed here, because it is easier than any of the rest. Now after we had first washed ourselves out of the fountain, and everyman had taken a draught out of an entirely golden cup, we were once againto follow the Virgin into the hall, and there put on new apparel, which wasall of cloth of gold gloriously set out with flowers. There was also given toeveryone another Golden Fleece, which was set about with precious stones,and various workmanship according to the utmost skill of each artificer. Onit hung a weighty medal of gold, on which were figured the sun and moonin opposition; but on the other side stood this saying, “The light of themoon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenI"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Page 46times lighter than at present.” But our former jewels were laid in a little cas-ket, and committed to one of the waiters. After this the Virgin led us out in our order, where the musicians waitedready at the door, all appareled in red velvet with white guards. After whicha door (which I never saw open before) to the Royal winding stairs wasunlocked. There the Virgin led us, together with the music, up three hun-dred and sixty five stairs; there we saw nothing that was not of extremelycostly workmanship, full of artifice; and the further we went, the more glo-rious still was the furniture, until at length at the top we came under apainted arch, where the sixty virgins attended us, all richly appareled. Nowas soon as they had bowed to us, and we, as well as we could, had returnedour reverence, our musicians were sent away, and must go down the stairsagain, the door being shut after them. After this a little bell was tolled; thenin came in a beautiful Virgin who brought everyone a wreath of laurel. Butour virgins had branches given them.Meanwhile a curtain was drawn up, where I saw the King and Queen asthey sat there in their majesty, and had not the Duchess yesterday so faith-fully warned me, I should have forgotten myself, and have equaled thisunspeakable glory to Heaven. For apart from the fact that the room glis-tened with gold and precious stones, the Queen’s robes were moreovermade so that I was not able to behold them. And whereas before Iesteemed anything to be handsome, here all things so much surpassed therest, as the stars in heaven are elevated. In the meantime the Virgin came in, and so each of the virgins takingone of us by the hand, with most profound reverence presented us to theKing, whereupon the Virgin began to speak thus: “That to honour yourRoyal Majesties (most gracious King and Queen) these lords here presenthave ventured here in peril of body and life, your Majesties have reason torejoice, especially since the greatest part are qualified for the enlarging ofyour Majesties’ Estates and Empire, as you will find by a most gracious andparticular examination of each of them. Herewith I desired to have thempresented in humility to your Majesties, with most humble suit to dischargemyself of this commission of mine, and most graciously to take sufficientinformation from each of them, concerning both my actions and omis-sions.” Hereupon she laid down her branch upon the ground. Now it wouldhave been very fitting for one of us to have put in and said something onthis occasion, but seeing we were all tongue-tied, at length the old Atlas"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Page 47stepped forward and spoke on the King’s behalf:- “Their Royal Majestiesdo most graciously rejoice at your arrival, and wish that their Royal Gracebe assured to all, and every man. And with your administration, gentle Vir-gin, they are most graciously satisfied, and accordingly a Royal Rewardshall therefore be provided for you. Yet it is still their intention that youshall also continue to be with them this day, inasmuch as they have no rea-son to mistrust you.” Hereupon the Virgin humbly took up the branch again. And so we forthe first time were to step aside with our Virgin. This room was square onthe front, five times broader than it was long; but towards the West it had agreat arch like a porch, wherein in a circle stood three glorious royalthrones, yet the middlemost was somewhat higher than the rest. Now ineach throne sat two persons. In the first sat a very ancient King with a greybeard, yet his consort was extraordinarily fair and young. In the thirdthrone sat a black King of middle age, and by him a dainty old matron, notcrowned, but covered with a veil. But in the middle sat the two young per-sons, and though they had likewise wreaths of laurel upon their heads, yetover them hung a large and costly crown. Now although they were not atthis time so fair as I had before imagined to myself, yet so it was to be.Behind them on a round form sat for the most part ancient men, yet noneof them had any sword or other weapon about him, at which I wondered.Neither saw I any other body-guard, but certain Virgins who were with usthe day before, who sat on the sides of the arch. Here I cannot pass over in silence how the little Cupid flew to and frothere, but for the most part he hovered over and played the wanton aboutthe great crown; sometimes he seated himself between the two lovers,somewhat smiling upon them with his bow. Indeed, sometimes he made asif he would shoot one of us. In brief, this knave was so full of his waggery,that we would not even spare the little birds which flew in multitudes upand down the room, but tormented them all he could. The virgins also hadtheir pastimes with him, but whenever they could catch him, it was not soeasy a matter for him to get from them again. Thus this little knave made allthe sport and mirth. Before the Queen stood a small but inexpressibly curious altar, on whichlay a book covered with black velvet, a little overlaid with gold. By thisstood a small taper in an ivory candlestick. Now although it was very small,yet it burnt continually, and was such that had not Cupid, in sport, nowand then puffed upon it, we could not have conceived it to be fire. By this"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Page 48stood a sphere or celestial globe, which turned clearly about by itself. Nextto this, a small striking-watch, and by that was a little crystal pipe orsyphon-fountain, out of which perpetually ran a clear blood-red liquor.And last of all there was a skull, or death’s head; in this was a white serpent,who was of such a length that though she wound about the rest of it in acircle, her tail still remained in one of the eyeholes until her head againentered the other; so she never stirred from her skull, unless it happenedthat Cupid twitched a little at her, for then she slipped in so suddenly thatwe all could not choose but marvel at it. Together with this altar, there were up and down the room wonderfulimages, which moved themselves as if they had been alive, and had sostrange a contrivance that it would be impossible for me to relate it all.Likewise, as we were passing out, there began such a marvellous kind ofvocal music, that I could not tell for sure whether it was performed by thevirgins who still stayed behind, or by the images themselves. Now we beingsatisfied for the time being, went away with our virgins, who (the musiciansbeing already present) led us down the winding stairs again, and the doorwas diligently locked and bolted. As soon as we had come again into thehall, one of the virgins began: “I wonder, Sister, that you dare hazard your-self amongst so many people.” “My Sister,” replied our president, “I am afraid of none so much as ofthis man,” pointing at me. This speech went to my heart, for I well understood that she mocked atmy age, and indeed I was the oldest of them all. Yet she comforted meagain with the promise that if I behaved myself well towards her, she wouldeasily rid me of this burden. Meantime a light meal was again brought in, and everyone’s Virginseated by him; they knew well how to shorten the time with handsome dis-courses, but what their discourses and sports were I dare not blab out ofschool. But most of the questions were about the arts, whereby I could eas-ily gather that both young and old were conversant in knowledge. But stillit ran in my thoughts how I might become young again, whereupon I wassomewhat sadder. The Virgin perceived this, and therefore began, “I bet anything, if I liewith him tonight, he shall be pleasanter in the morning.” Hereupon they all began to laugh, and although I blushed all over, yet Ihad to laugh too at my own ill-luck."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Page 49Now there was one there who had a mind to return my disgrace uponthe Virgin again, so he said, “I hope not only we, but the virgins them-selves too, will bear witness on behalf of our brother, that our lady presidenthas promised to be his bedfellow tonight.” “I should be well content with it,” replied the Virgin, “if I had no reasonto be afraid of my sisters here; there would be no hold with them should Ichoose the best and handsomest for myself, against their will.” “My Sister,” began another, “we find by this that your high officedoesn’t make you proud; so if with your permission we might divide by lotthe lords here present among us for bedfellows, you should with our goodwill have such a prerogative.” We let this pass for a jest, and again began to discourse together. But ourVirgin could not leave tormenting us, and therefore began again. “Mylords, what about if we should let fortune decide which of us must lietogether tonight?” “Well,” I said, “if it may not be otherwise, we cannot refuse such anoffer.” Now because it was concluded to make this trial after the meal, weresolved to sit no longer at table, so we arose, and each one walked up anddown with his Virgin. “No,” said the Virgin, “it shall not be so yet, but let us see how fortunewill couple us,” upon which we were separated. But now first arose a dispute how the business should be carried out; butthis was only a premeditated device, for the Virgin instantly made the pro-posal that we should mix ourselves together in a ring, and that she begin-ning to count the seventh from herself, was to be content with thefollowing seventh, whether it were a virgin, or a man. For our parts wewere not aware of any craft, and therefore permitted it to be so; but whenwe thought we had mingled ourselves very well, the virgins neverthelesswere so clever that each one knew her station beforehand. The Virginbegan to reckon; the seventh from her was another virgin, the third seventha virgin likewise, and this happened so long till (to our amazement) all thevirgins came forth, and none of us was hit. Thus we poor pitiful wretchesremained standing alone, and were moreover forced to suffer ourselves tobe jeered at, and to confess we were very handsomely tricked. In short,whoever had seen us in our order, might sooner have expected the sky tofall, than that it should never have come to our turn. With this our sportwas at an end, and we had to satisfy ourselves with the Virgin’s waggery."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Page 50In the interim, the little wanton Cupid came in to us too. But we couldnot sport ourselves with him enough, because he presented himself onbehalf of their Royal Majesties, and delivered us a health (from them) out ofa golden cup, and had to call our virgins to the King, declaring also that hecould at this time tarry no longer with them. So with a due return of ourmost humble thanks we let him fly off again. Now because (in the interim) the mirth had begun to fall to my con-sort’s feet - and the virgins were not sorry to see it - they quickly started upa civil dance, which I beheld with pleasure rather than taking part; for mymercurialists were so ready with their postures, as if they had long been ofthe trade. After a few dances our president came in again, and told us howthe artists and students had offered themselves to their Royal Majesties, fortheir honour and pleasure, to act a merry comedy before their departure;and if we thought it good to be present at this, and to wait upon theirRoyal Majesties to the House of the Sun, it would be acceptable to them,and they would most graciously acknowledge it. Hereupon in the firstplace we returned our most humble thanks for the honour vouchsafed us;not only this, but moreover we most submissively tendered our humble ser-vice. This the Virgin related again, and presently brought word to attend theirRoyal Majesties (in our order) in the gallery, where we were soon led; andwe did not stay long there, for the Royal Procession was just ready, yetwithout any music at all. The unknown Duchess who was with us yesterdaywent in front, wearing a small and costly coronet, appareled in white satin.She carried nothing but a small crucifix which was made of a pearl, and thisvery day wrought between the young King and his Bride. After her wentthe six aforementioned virgins in two ranks, who carried the King’s jewelsbelonging to the little altar. Next to these came the three Kings. TheBridegroom was in the midst of them in a plain dress, but in black satin,after the Italian fashion. He had on a small round black hat, with a littlepointed black feather, which he courteously took off to us, so to signify hisfavour towards us. We bowed ourselves to him, as also to the first, as we hadbeen instructed before. After the Kings came the three Queens, two ofwhom were richly dressed, but she in the middle was likewise all in black,and Cupid held up her train. After this, intimation was given to us to fol-low, and after us the Virgins, till at last old Atlas brought up the rear. In such procession, through many stately walks, we at length came to theHouse of the Sun, there next to the King and Queen, upon a richly fur-"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Page 51nished scaffold, to behold the previously ordained comedy. We indeed,though separated, stood on the right hand of the Kings, but the virginsstood on the left, except those to whom the Royal Ensigns were commit-ted. To them was allotted their own place at the top of all. But the rest ofthe attendants had to stand below between the columns, and to be contentwith that. Now because there are many remarkable passages in this comedy, I willnot omit to go over it briefly. First of all a very ancient King came on, with some servants; before histhrone was brought a little chest, with mention being made that it wasfound upon the water. Now it being opened, there appeared in it a lovelybaby, together with some jewels, and a small letter of parchment sealed andsuperscribed to the King, which the King therefore opened; and havingread it, wept, and then declared to his servants how injuriously the King ofthe Moors had deprived his aunt of her country, and had extinguished allthe royal seed even to his infant, with the daughter of which country hehad now the intention of matching his son. Hereupon he swore to maintainperpetual enmity with the Moor and his allies, and to revenge this uponthem; and with this he commanded that the child should be tenderlynursed, and to make preparation against the Moor. Now this provision, andthe disciplining of the young lady (who after she had grown up a little wascommitted to an ancient tutor) took up all the first act, with many very fineand laudable sports besides. In the interlude a lion and griffin were set at one another to fight, andthe lion got the victory, which was also a pretty sight. In the second act, the Moor, a very black treacherous fellow, came ontoo. He, having with vexation understood that his murder had been discov-ered, and that a little lady was craftily stolen from him too, began thereuponto consult how by stratagem he might be able to encounter so powerful anadversary; on which he was eventually advised by certain fugitives who fledto him because of a famine. So the young lady, contrary to everyone’s expectations, fell again into hishands; he would have been likely to have caused her to be slain if he hadnot been wonderfully deceived by his own servants. Thus this act was con-cluded too, with a marvellous triumph of the Moor. In the third act a great army of the King’s party was raised against theMoor, and put under the conduct of an ancient valiant knight, who fellinto the Moor’s country, till at length he forcibly rescued the young lady"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Page 52from the tower, and appareled her anew. After this in a trice they erected aglorious scaffold, and placed their young lady upon it. Presently twelveroyal ambassadors came, amongst whom the aforementioned knight made aspeech, alleging that the King his most gracious lord had not only deliveredher from death earlier, and even caused her to be royally brought up untilnow (though she had not behaved herself altogether as became her). Butmoreover his Royal Majesty had, before others, elected her to be a spousefor the young lord his son, and most graciously desired that the said espous-als might actually be executed, if they would be sworn to his Majesty uponthe following articles. Hereupon out of a patent he caused certain gloriousconditions to be read, which if it were not too long, would be well worthyof being recounted here. In brief, the young lady took an oath inviolably toobserve the same, returning thanks too in a most seemly way for such ahigh grace. Whereupon they began to sing to the praise of God, of theKing, and the young lady, and so for the time being departed. For sport, in the meantime, the four beasts of Daniel, as he saw them inthe vision and as he described them at length, were brought in, all of whichhad its certain signification. In the fourth act the young lady was again restored to her lost kingdom,and crowned, and for a while, in this array, conducted about the place withextraordinary joy. After this many and various ambassadors presented them-selves, not only to wish her prosperity, but also to behold her glory. Yet itwas not for long that she preserved her integrity, but soon began again tolook wantonly about her, and to wink at the ambassadors and lords; in thisshe truly acted her part to the life. These manners of hers were soon known to the Moor, who would byno means neglect such an opportunity, and because her steward did not paysufficient attention to her, she was easily blinded with great promises, sothat she did not keep good confidence with her King, but privately submit-ted herself entirely to the disposal of the Moor. Hereupon the Moor madehaste, and having (by her consent) got her into his hands, he gave her goodwords until all her kingdom had subjected itself to him. After which, in thethird scene of this act, he caused her to be led forth, and first to be strippedstark naked, and then to be bound to a post upon a scurvy wooden scaffold,and well scourged, and at last sentenced to death. This was so woeful aspectacle, that it made the eyes of many run over. Hereupon like this, nakedas she was, she was cast into prison, there to await her death, which was tobe procured by poison, which actually did not kill her, but made her lep-rous all over. Thus this act was for the most part lamentable."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Page 53Between acts, they brought forth Nebuchadnezzar’s image, which wasadorned with all manner of arms, on the head, breast, belly, legs and feet,and the like, of which more shall be said in the future explanation. In the fifth act the young King was told of all that had passed betweenthe Moor and his future spouse; he first interceded with his father for her,entreating that she might not be left in that condition; which his fatherhaving agreed to, ambassadors were despatched to comfort her in her sick-ness and captivity, but yet also to make her see her inconsiderateness. Butshe still would not receive them, but consented to be the Moor’s concu-bine, which was also done, and the young King was acquainted with it. After this came a band of fools, each of which brought with him a cud-gel; within a trice they made a great globe of the world, and soon undid itagain. It was a fine sportive fantasy. In the sixth act the young King resolved to do battle with the Moor,which was also done. And although the Moor was discomforted, yet allheld the young King too to be dead. At length he came to himself again,released his spouse, and committed her to his steward and chaplain. Thefirst of these tormented her greatly; then the tables were turned, and thepriest was so insolently wicked that he had to be above all, until this wasreported to the young King; who hastily despatched one who broke theneck of the priest’s mightiness, and adorned the bride in some measure forthe nuptials. After the act a vast artificial elephant was brought forth. He carried agreat tower with musicians, which was also well pleasing to all. In the last act the bridegroom appeared with such pomp as cannot bebelieved, and I was amazed how it was brought to pass. The bride met himin similar solemnity, whereupon all the people cried out LONG LIVETHE BRIDEGROOM! LONG LIVE THE BRIDE! - so that by thiscomedy they also congratulated our King and Queen in the most statelymanner, which (as I well observed) pleased them most extraordinarily well. At length they walked about the stage in this procession, till at last theybegan to sing altogether as follows:I This lovely time Bringeth much joy With the king’s wedding, So sing ye all That it resound"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Page 54And gladness be to him who giveth it to us. II The beauteous bride Whom we have long awaited Shall be betrothed to him, And we have won Whereafter we did strive O happy he Who looketh to himself. III The elders good Are bidden now, For Long they were in care, In honour multiply That thousands arise From your own blood After this thanks were returned, and the comedy was finished with joy,and the particular enjoyment of the Royal Persons, so (the evening alsodrawing near already) they departed together in their aforementionedorder. But we were to attend the Royal Persons up the winding stairs into theaforementioned hall, where the tables were already richly furnished, andthis was the first time that we were invited to the King’s table. The littlealtar was placed in the midst of the hall, and the six royal ensigns previouslymentioned were laid upon it. At this time the young King behaved himselfvery graciously towards us, but yet he could not be heartily merry;although he now and then discoursed a little with us, yet he often sighed, atwhich the little Cupid only mocked, and played his waggish tricks. The oldKing and Queen were very serious; only the wife of one of the ancientKings was gay enough, the reason for which I did not yet understand. During this time, the Royal Persons took up the first table, at the secondonly we sat. At the third, some of the principal virgins placed themselves.The rest of the virgins, and men, all had to wait. This was performed withsuch state and solemn stillness that I am afraid to say very much about it."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Page 55But I cannot leave untouched upon here, how all the Royal Persons, beforethe meal, attired themselves in snow-white glittering garments, and so satdown at the table. Over the table hung the great golden crown, the pre-cious stones of which would have sufficiently illuminated the hall withoutany other light. However, all the lights were kindled at the small taper uponthe altar; what the reason was I did not know for sure. But I took verygood notice of this, that the young King frequently sent meat to the whiteserpent upon the little altar, which caused me to muse. Almost all the prattle at this banquet was made by little Cupid, whocould not leave us (and me, indeed, especially) untormented. He was per-petually producing some strange matter. However, there was no consider-able mirth, all went silently on; from which I, myself, could imagine somegreat imminent peril. For there was no music at all heard; but if we weredemanded anything, we had to give short round answers, and so let it rest.In short, all things had so strange a face, that the sweat began to trickledown all over my body; and I am apt to believe that the most stout-heartedman alive would then have lost his courage. Supper being now almost ended, the young King commanded the bookto be reached him from the little altar. This he opened, and caused it onceagain to be propounded to us by an old man, whether we resolved to abideby him in prosperity and adversity; which we having consented to withtrembling, he further had us asked, whether we would give him our handson it, which, when we could find no evasion, had to be so. Hereupon oneafter another arose, and with his own hand wrote himself down in thisbook. When this also had been performed, the little crystal fountain, togetherwith a very small crystal glass, was brought near, out of which all the RoyalPersons drank one after another. Afterwards it was held out to us too, andso to all persons; and this was called the Draught of Silence. Hereupon allthe Royal Persons presented us their hands, declaring that if we did notnow stick to them, we should nevermore from now on see them; whichtruly made our eyes run over. But our president engaged herself and prom-ised a great deal on our behalf, which gave them satisfaction. Meantime a little bell was tolled, at which all the Royal Persons becameso incredibly bleak, that we were ready to despair utterly. They quicklytook off their white garments again, and put on entirely black ones. Thewhole hall likewise was hung about with black velvet, the floor was coveredwith black velvet, with which also the ceiling above was overspread (all this"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Page 56being prepared beforehand). After that the tables were also removed, and allseated themselves round about upon the form, and we also put on blackhabits. In came our president again, who had before gone out, and shebrought with her six black taffeta scarves, with which she bound the sixRoyal Persons’ eyes. Now when they could no longer see, six covered cof-fins were immediately brought in by the servants, and set down in the hall;also a low black seat was placed in the middle. Finally, there came in a verycoal-black, tall man, who bore in his hand a sharp axe. Now after the oldKing had first been brought to the seat, his head was instantly whipped off,and wrapped in a black cloth; but the blood was received into a greatgolden goblet, and placed with him in this coffin that stood by; which,being covered, was set aside. Thus it went with the rest also, so that Ithought it would at length have come to me too, but it did not. For as soonas the six Royal Persons were beheaded, the black man went out again;another followed after him, and beheaded him too just before the door, andbrought back his head together with the axe, which were laid in a littlechest. This indeed seemed to me a bloody Wedding, but because I could nottell what was yet to happen, for the time being I had to suspend my under-standing until I had further resolved things. For the Virgin too, seeing thatsome of us were faint-hearted and wept, bid us be content. “For”, she said to us, “The life of these now stands in your hands, and ifyou follow me, this death shall make many alive.” With this she intimated that we should go to sleep, and trouble ourselvesno further on their part, for they should be sure to have their due right.And so she bade us all goodnight, saying that she must watch the dead bod-ies this night. We did this, and were each of us conducted by our pages intoour lodgings. My page talked with me of sundry and various matters(which I still remember very well) and gave me cause enough to admire hisunderstanding. But his intention was to lull me to sleep, which at last I wellobserved; so I made as though I was fast asleep, but no sleep came into myeyes, and I could not put the beheaded out of my mind. Now my lodging was directly over against the great lake, so that I couldeasily look upon it, the windows being near to the bed. About midnight, assoon as it had struck twelve, suddenly I saw a great fire on the lake, so outof fear I quickly opened the window to see what would become of it. Thenfrom afar I saw seven ships making forward, which were all full of lights.Above each of them on the top hovered a flame that passed to and fro, and"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Page 57sometimes descended right down, so that I could easily judge that it mustbe the spirits of the beheaded. Now these ships gently approached land, and each of them had no morethan one mariner. As soon as they had come to shore, I saw our Virginwith a torch going towards the ship, after whom the six covered coffinswere carried, together with the little chest, and each of them was secretlylaid in a ship. So I awakened my page too, who greatly thanked me, for, having run upand down a lot all day, he might have slept through this altogether, thoughhe knew quite well about it. Now as soon as the coffins were laid in theships, all the lights were extinguished, and the six flames passed backtogether over the lake, so that there was no more than one light in eachship for a watch. There were also some hundreds of watchmen who hadencamped themselves on the shore, and sent the Virgin back again into thecastle; she carefully bolted everything up again, so that I could judge thatthere was nothing more to be done this night, but that we must await theday. So we again took ourselves to rest. And I only of all my company had achamber towards the lake, and saw this, so that now I was also extremelyweary, and so fell asleep in my manifold speculations."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Page 58"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Page 59The Fifth Dayhe night was over, and the dear wished-for day broken, whenhastily I got out of bed, more desirous to learn what might yetensue, than that I had slept enough. Now after I had put on myclothes, and according to my custom had gone down the stairs,it was still too early, and I found nobody else in the hall; so I entreated mypage to lead me about a little in the castle, and show me something rare. Hewas now (as always) willing, and led me down certain steps under ground,to a great iron door, on which the following words in great copper letterswere fixed:(Here lies buried Venus, that beauty which has undone many a greatman both in fortune, honour, blessing and prosperity.)This I thus copied, and set down in my table-book. Now after this doorwas opened, the page led me by the hand through a very dark passage, tillwe came again to a very little door, that was only now put to; for (as mypage informed me) it was first opened yesterday when the coffins weretaken out, and had not since been shut. Now as soon as we stepped in, Isaw the most precious thing that Nature ever created, for this vault had nolight other than that from certain huge great carbuncles, and this (as I wasinformed) was the King’s Treasury. But the main and most glorious thingthat I saw here was a sepulchre (which stood in the middle) so rich that Iwondered that it was not better guarded. To which the page answered me,that I had good reason to be thankful to my planet, by whose influence itwas that I had now seen certain pieces which no other human eye (exceptthe King’s family) had ever had a view of. This sepulchre was triangular, and had in the middle of it a vessel of pol-ished copper; the rest was of pure gold and precious stones. In the vesselstood an angel, who held in his arms an unknown tree, which continuallydropped fruit into the vessel; and as often as the fruit fell into the vessel, itturned into water, and ran out from there into three small golden vesselsstanding by. This little altar was supported by these three animals, an eagle,an ox and a lion, which stood on an exceedingly costly base. I asked my page what this might signify. “Here,” he said, “lies buried Lady Venus, that beauty which has undonemany a great man, both in fortune, honour, blessing and prosperity.” Afterwhich he showed me a copper door on the pavement. “Here,” he said, “if you please, we may go further down.” T"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Page 60“I still follow you,” I replied. So I went down the steps, where it was exceedingly dark, but the pageimmediately opened a little chest, in which stood a small ever-burningtaper, at which he kindled one of the torches which lay by. I was greatlyterrified, and seriously asked how he dared do this? He said by way of answer “As long as the Royal Persons are still at rest,we have nothing to fear.” Then I saw a rich bed ready made, hung about with curious curtains,one of which he drew aside, where I saw the Lady Venus stark naked (forhe heaved up the coverlets too) lying there in such beauty, and in such asurprising fashion, that I was almost beside myself; neither do I yet knowwhether it was a piece thus carved, or a human corpse that lay dead there.For she was altogether immovable, and yet I dared not touch her. So shewas again covered, and the curtain drawn before her, yet she was still (as itwere) in my eye. But I soon saw behind the bed a tablet on which it waswritten as follows:(When the fruit of my tree shall be quite melted down then I shall awakeand be the mother of a King.)I asked my page about this writing, but he laughed, with the promisethat I should know it too. So, he putting out the torch, we ascended again.Then I had a better look at all the little doors, and first found that on everycorner there burned a small taper of pyrites, of which I had before taken nonotice, for the fire was so clear that it looked much more like a stone than ataper. From this heat the tree was forced continually to melt, yet it still pro-duced new fruit. Now behold (said the page) what I heard revealed to theKing by Atlas. When the tree (he said) shall be quite melted down, thenshall Lady Venus awake, and be the mother of a King. Whilst he was thus speaking, in flew the little Cupid, who at first wassomewhat abashed at our presence, but seeing us both look more like thedead than the living, he could not in the end refrain from laughing,demanding what spirit had brought us there. I with trembling answeredhim, that I had lost my way in the castle, and had come here by chance, andthat the page likewise had been looking up and down for me, and at lastcame upon me here, and I hoped he would not take it amiss. “Well then, that’s well enough yet, my old busy grandsire,” said Cupid,“but you might easily have served me a scurvy trick, had you been aware ofthis door. Now I must look better to it,” and so he put a strong lock on thecopper door where we had before descended."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Page 61I thanked God that he had not come upon us sooner. My page too washappier, because I had helped him so well at this pinch. “Ye t ,” said Cupid, “I cannot let it pass unrevenged that you were so nearstumbling upon my dear mother.” With that he put the point of his dart into one of the little tapers, andheating it a little, pricked me with it on the hand, which at that time I paidlittle attention to, but was glad that it had gone so well for us, and that wecame off without further danger. Meantime my companions had got out of bed too, and had returnedinto the hall again. To them I also joined myself, making as if I had justrisen. After Cupid had carefully made all fast again, he came to us too, andwould have me show him my hand, where he still found a little drop ofblood; at which he heartily laughed, and bade the rest have a care of me, asI would shortly end my days. We all wondered how Cupid could be somerry, and have no sense at all of yesterday’s sad occurrences. But he was inno way troubled. Now our president had in the meantime made herself ready for the jour-ney, coming in all in black velvet, yet she still carried her branch of laurel.Her virgins too had their branches. Now all things being ready, the Virginasked us first to drink something, and then presently to prepare for the pro-cession, so we did not tarry long but followed her out of the hall into thecourt. In the court stood six coffins, and my companions thought nothingother than that the six Royal Persons lay in them, but I well observed thedevice. Yet I did not know what was to be done with these others. By eachcoffin were eight muffled men. Now as soon as the music began (it was somournful and dolesome a tune, that I was astonished at it) they took up thecoffins, and we (as we were ordered) had to go after them into the afore-mentioned garden, in the middle of which was erected a wooden edifice,having round about the roof a glorious crown, and standing upon sevencolumns. Within it were formed six sepulchres, and by each of them was astone; but in the middle was a round hollow rising stone. In these gravesthe coffins were quietly and with many ceremonies laid. The stones wereshoveled over them, and they shut fast. But the little chest was to lie in themiddle. Herewith my companions were deceived, for they imagined noth-ing other but that the dead corpses were there. Upon the top of all therewas a great flag, having a phoenix painted on it, perhaps the more to deludeus. Here I had great occasion to thank God that I had seen more than therest."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Page 62Now after the funerals were done, the Virgin, having placed herselfupon the middlemost stone, made a short oration, that we should be con-stant to our engagements, and not repine at the pains we were hereafter toundergo, but be helpful in restoring the present buried Royal Persons tolife again; and therefore without delay to rise up with her, to journey to thetower of Olympus, to fetch from there medicines useful and necessary forthis purpose. This we soon agreed to, and followed her through another little doorright to the shore. There the seven aforementioned ships stood all empty,on which the virgins stuck up their laurel branches, and after they had dis-tributed us in the six ships, they caused us thus to begin our voyage inGod’s name, and looked upon us as long as they could have us in sight, afterwhich they, with all the watchmen, returned into the castle. Our ships eachhad a peculiar device. Five of them indeed had the five regular bodies, eachtheir own, but mine, in which the Virgin sat too, carried a globe. Thus wesailed on in a particular order, and each ship the Moor lay. In this weretwelve musicians, who played excellently well, and its device was a pyra-mid. Next followed three abreast, B, C, and D, in which we were. I sat inC. In the middle behind these came the two fairest and stateliest ships, Eand F, stuck about with many branches of laurel, having no passengers inthem; their flags were the sun and moon. But in the rear was only one ship,G; in this were forty virgins. Now having passed over this lake in this way, we first went through anarrow arm, into the right seas, where all the sirens, nymphs, and sea-god-desses were waiting for us; wherefore they immediately dispatched a sea-nymph to us to deliver their present and offering of honour to the Wed-ding. It was a costly, great, set, round and oriental pearl, the like of whichhas never been seen, neither in our world nor yet in the new world. Nowthe Virgin having friendlily received it, the nymph further entreated thataudience might be given to their entertainments, and to make a little stand,which the Virgin was content to do, and commanded the two great ships tostand in the middle, and the rest to encompass them in a pentagon. Afterwhich the nymphs fell into a ring about, and with a most delicate sweetvoice began to sing as follows:INaught better is on earthThan lovely noble love"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Page 63Whereby we be as GodAnd no one vexeth his neighbour.So let unto the king be sungThat all the sea shall sound.

When they, with most admirable concert and melody, had finished thissong, I no more wondered at Ulysses for stopping the ears of his compan-ions, for I seemed to myself the most unhappy man alive, because naturehad not made me, too, so trim a creature. But the Virgin soon dispatchedthem, and commanded us to set sail from there; so the nymphs went offtoo, after they had been presented with a long red scarf for a gratuity, anddispersed themselves in the sea. I was at this time aware that Cupid began to work with me too, whichyet tended by a very little towards my credit, and forasmuch as my giddinessis not likely to be beneficial to the reader, I am resolved to let it rest as it is.But this was the very wound that in the first book I received on the head ina dream. And let everyone take warning by me of loitering about Venus’bed, for Cupid can by no means brook it.After some hours, having gone a good way in friendly discourses, wecame within sight of the Tower of Olympus, so the Virgin commanded togive the signal of our approach by the discharge of some pieces, which wasalso done. And immediately we saw a great white flag thrust out, and asmall gilded pinnace sent forth to meet us. Now as soon as this had come tous, we perceived in it a very ancient man, the Warder of the Tower, withcertain guards clothed in white, by whom we were friendlily received, andso conducted to the Tower."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Page 65This Tower was situated upon an island which was exactly square, andwhich was environed with a wall that was so firm and thick that I myselfcounted three hundred and sixty passes over. On the other side of the wallwas a fine meadow with certain little gardens, in which grew strange, andto me unknown, fruits; and then again there was an inner wall about theTower. The Tower itself was just as if seven round towers had been builtone by another, yet the middlemost was somewhat the higher, and withinthey all entered one into another, and had seven storeys one above another.Being come in this way to the gates of the Tower, we were led a little asideby the wall, so that, as I well observed, the coffins might be brought intothe Tower without our taking notice; of this the rest knew nothing.This being done, we were conducted into the Tower at the very bottom,which although it was excellently painted, yet we had little recreation there;for this was nothing but a laboratory, where we had to beat and wash plants,and precious stones, and all sorts of things, and extract their juice andessence, and put the same in glasses, and hand them over to be put aside.And truly our Virgin was so busy with us, and so full of her directions, thatshe knew how to give each of us enough employment, so that in this islandwe had to be mere drudges, till we had achieved all that was necessary forthe restoring of the beheaded bodies.Meantime (as I afterwards understood) three virgins were in the firstapartment washing the bodies with all diligence. Now when we had at lastalmost finished this preparation of ours, nothing more was brought us butsome broth with a little draught of wine, by which I well observed that wewere not here for our pleasure. For when we had finished our day’s work,too, everyone had only a mattress laid on the ground for him, with whichwe were to content ourselves. For my part I was not very much bothered about sleeping, and thereforewalked out into the garden, and at length came as far as the wall; andbecause the heaven was at that time very clear, I could well drive away thetime in contemplating the stars. By chance I came to a great pair of stonestairs, which led up to the top of the wall. And because the moon shonevery bright, I was so much the more confident, and went up, and looked alittle upon the sea too, which was now exceedingly calm. And thus having good opportunity to consider more about astronomy, Ifound that this present night there would occur a conjunction of the plan-ets, the like of which was not otherwise usually to be observed. Now hav-ing looked a good while at the sea, and it being just about midnight, as"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Page 66soon as it had struck twelve I saw from afar the seven flames passing overthe sea towards here, and taking themselves towards the top of the spire ofthe Tower. This made me somewhat afraid, for as soon as the flames hadsettled themselves, the winds arose, and began to make the sea very tempes-tuous. The moon also was covered with clouds, and my joy ended withsuch fear that I scarcely had enough time to find the stairs ended with suchfear that I scarcely had enough time to find the stairs again, and take myselfto the Tower again. Now whether the flames tarried any longer, or passedaway again, I cannot say, for in this obscurity I did not dare venture abroadmore. So I lay down on my mattress, and there being in the laboratory a pleas-ant and gently murmuring fountain, I fell asleep so much the sooner. Andthus the fifth day too was concluded with wonders."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Page 67The Sixth Dayext morning, after we had awakened one another, we sattogether a while to discuss what might yet be the events tooccur. For some were of the opinion that they should all bebrought back to life again together. Others contradicted this,because the decease of the ancients was not only to restore life, but toincrease it too to the young ones. Some imagined that they had not beenput to death, but that others had been beheaded in their stead. We now having talked together a pretty long while, in came the oldman, and first saluting us, looked about him to see if all things were ready,and the processes sufficiently completed. We had so conducted ourselves asregards this that he had no fault to find with our diligence, so he placed allthe glasses together, and put them into a case. Presently in came certainyouths bringing with them some ladders, ropes, and large wings, whichthey laid down before us. Then the old man began as follows: “My dearsons, each of you must this day constantly bear one of these three thingsabout with him. Now you are free either to make a choice of one of them,or to cast lots about it.” We replied, “we would choose”.“No,” he said, “let it rather go by lot.” Hereupon he made three little schedules. On one he wrote ‘Ladder’, onthe second ‘Rope’, on the third ‘Wings’. These he put in a hat, and eachman must draw, and whatever he got, that was to be his. Those who got theropes imagined themselves to have the best of it, but I chanced to get a lad-der, which afflicted me greatly, for it was twelve feet long, and prettyweighty, and I was forced to carry it, whereas the others could handsomelycoil their ropes about them. And as for the wings, the old man joined themso closely onto the third group, as if they had grown upon them. Hereupon he turned the cock, and then the fountain no longer ran, andwe had to remove it from the middle out of the way. After all things werecarried off, he took leave, taking with him the casket with the glasses, andlocked the door fast after him, so that we imagined nothing other but thatwe had been imprisoned in this Tower. But it was hardly a quarter of an hour before a round hole at the very topwas uncovered, where we saw our Virgin, who called to us, and bade usgood morrow, desiring us to come up. Those with the wings were instantlyabove and through the hole. Only those with the ropes were in an evilN"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Page 68plight. For as soon as every one of us was up, he was commanded to drawup the ladder after him. At last each man’s rope was hanged on an ironhook, so everyone had to climb up by his rope as well as he could, whichindeed was not accomplished without blisters. Now as soon as we were all up, the hole was covered again, and we werefriendlily received by the Virgin. This room was the whole breadth of theTower itself, having six very stately vestries raised a little above the room,and were entered by an ascent of three steps. In these vestries we wereplaced, there to pray for the life of the King and Queen. Meanwhile theVirgin went in and out of the little door A, till we were ready. For as soon as our process was absolved, there was brought in by twelvepersons (who were formerly our musicians), through the little door, andplaced in the middle, a wonderful thing of longish shape, which my com-panions took only to be a fountain. But I well observed that the corpses layin it, for the inner chest was of an oval figure, so large that six personsmight well lie in it one by another. After which they again went forth,fetched their instruments, and conducted in our Virgin, together with herfemale attendants, with a most delicate sound of music. The Virgin carrieda little casket, but the rest only branches and small lamps, and some lightedtorches too. The torches were immediately given into our hands, and wewere to stand about the fountain in this order.First stood the Virgin A with her attendants in a ring round about withthe lamps and branches C. Next stood we with our torches B, then themusicians A in a long rank; last of all the rest of the virgins D in anotherlong rank too. Now where the virgins came from, whether they lived inthe castle, or whether they had been brought in by night, I do not know,for all their faces were covered with delicate white linen, so that I could notrecognise any of them.Hereupon the Virgin opened the casket, in which there was a roundthing wrapped up in a piece of green double taffeta. This she laid in theuppermost vessel, and then covered it with the lid, which was full of holes,and which had besides a rim through which she poured in some of thewater which we had prepared the day before. Then the fountain beganimmediately to run, and to flow into the little vessel through four smallpipes. Beneath the underneath vessel there were many sharp points, onwhich the virgins stuck their lamps, so that the heat might reach the vessel,and make the water boil. Now the water beginning to simmer, it fell inupon the bodies by many little holes at A, and was so hot that it dissolved"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Page 69them all, and turned them into liquor. But what the above-mentionedround wrapped-up thing was, my companions did not know, but I under-stood that it was the Moor’s head, from which the water drew so great aheat. At A, round about the great vessel, there were again many holes, inwhich they stuck their branches. Now whether this was done of necessity,or only for ceremony, I do not know. However, these branches were con-tinually besprinkled by the fountain, and from them it afterwards droppedinto the vessel something of a deeper yellow. This lasted for nearly twohours, the fountain still constantly running by itself; but the longer it ran,the fainter it was.Meantime the musicians went their way, and we walked up and down inthe room, and truly the room was made in such a way that we had oppor-tunity enough to pass away our time. There were, for images, paintings,clockworks, organs, springing fountains, and the like, nothing forgotten.Now it was near the time when the fountain ceased, and would run nolonger, when the Virgin commanded a round golden globe to be brought.But at the bottom of the fountain there was a tap, by which she let out allthe matter that was dissolved by those hot drops (of which certain partswere then very red) into the globe. The rest of the water which remainedabove in the kettle was poured out. And so this fountain (which had nowbecome much lighter) was again carried forth. Now whether it was openedelsewhere, or whether anything of the bodies that was further useful yetremained, I dare not say for certain. But this I know, that the water that wasemptied into the globe was much heavier than six, or even more of us,were well able to bear, although going by its bulk it should have seemed nottoo heavy for one man. Now this globe having been got out of doors withmuch ado, we again sat alone, but I perceiving a trampling overhead, had aneye to my ladder. Here one might take notice of the strange opinions my companions hadconcerning this fountain, for they, imagining that the bodies lay in the gar-den of the castle, did not know what to make of this kind of working, but Ithanked God that I had awakened at so opportune a time, and that I hadseen that which helped me the better in all the Virgin’s business. After one quarter of an hour the cover above was again lifted off, and wewere commanded to come up, which was done as before with wings, lad-ders and ropes. And it vexed me not a little that whereas the virgins couldgo up another way, we had to take so much toil; yet I could well judge thatthere must be some special reason for it, and we must leave something for"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Page 70the old man to do too. For even those with wings had no advantage bythem other than when they had to climb through the hole. Now we having got up there, and the hole having been shut again, I sawthe globe hanging by a strong chain in the middle of the room. In thisroom was nothing but windows, and between two windows there was adoor, which was covered with nothing other than a great polished looking-glass. And these windows and these looking-glasses were optically opposedto one another, so that although the sun (which was now shining exceed-ingly brightly) beat only upon one door, yet (after the windows towards thesun were opened, and the doors before the looking-glasses drawn aside) inall quarters of the room there were nothing but suns, which by artificialrefractions beat upon the whole golden globe standing in the midst; andbecause (besides all this brightness) it was polished, it gave such a lustre, thatnone of us could open our eyes, but were forced to look out of the win-dows till the globe was well heated, and brought to the desired effect. HereI may well avow that in these mirrors I have seen the most wonderful spec-tacle that ever Nature brought to light, for there were suns in all places, andthe globe in the middle shined still brighter, so that we could no moreendure it than the sun itself, except for one twinkling of an eye. At length the Virgin commanded the looking-glasses to be shut upagain, and the windows to be made fast, and so to let the globe cool again alittle; and this was done about seven o’clock. This we thought good, sincewe might now have a little leisure to refresh ourselves with breakfast. Thistreatment was again right philosophical, and we had no need to be afraid ofintemperance, yet we had no want. And the hope of the future joy (withwhich the Virgin continually comforted us) made us so jocund that wetook no notice of any pains or inconvenience. And this I can truly say tooconcerning my companions of high quality, that their minds never ran aftertheir kitchen or table, but their pleasure was only to attend upon thisadventurous physick, and hence to contemplate the Creator’s wisdom andomnipotency. After we had taken our meal, we again settled down to work, for theglobe, which with toil and labour we were to lift off the chain and set uponthe floor, was sufficiently cooled. Now the dispute was how to get theglobe in half, for we were commanded to divide it in the middle. The con-clusion was that a sharp pointed diamond would best do it. Now when wehad thus opened the globe, there was nothing more of redness to be seen,but a lovely great snow-white egg. It made us rejoice most greatly that this"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Page 71had been brought to pass so well. For the Virgin was in perpetual care lestthe shell might still be too tender. We stood round about this egg as jocundas if we ourselves had laid it. But the Virgin made it be carried forth, anddeparted herself, too, from us again, and (as always) locked the door. Butwhat she did outside with the egg, or whether it were in some way pri-vately handled, I do not know, neither do I believe it. Yet we were again towait together for a quarter of an hour, till the third hole was opened, andwe by means of our instruments came to the fourth stone or floor. In this room we found a great copper vessel filled with yellow sand,which was warmed by a gentle fire. Afterwards the egg was raked up in it,that it might therein come to perfect maturity. This vessel was exactlysquare; upon one side stood these two verses, written in great letters.O. BLI. TO. BIT. MI. LI.On the second side were these three words:SANITAS. NIX. HASTA.(Health, Snow, Lance.)The third had only one word:F. I . A .

Now whether the egg were hereby meant, I leave to the learned to dis-pute; yet I do my part, and omit nothing undeclared. Our egg being nowready was taken out, but it needed no cracking, for the bird that was in itsoon freed himself, and showed himself very jocund, yet he looked verybloody and unshapen. We first set him upon the warm sand, so the Virgincommanded that before we gave him anything to eat, we should be sure tomake him fast, otherwise he would give us all work enough. This beingdone too, food was brought him, which surely was nothing else than theblood of the beheaded, diluted again with prepared water; by which thebird grew so fast under our eyes, that we saw well why the Virgin gave ussuch warning about him. He bit and scratched so devilishly about him, thatcould he have had his will upon any of us, he would have despatched him. Now he was wholly black, and wild, so other food was brought him,perhaps the blood of another of the Royal Persons; whereupon all his blackfeathers moulted again, and instead of them there grew out snow-whitefeathers. He was somewhat tamer too, and more docile. Nevertheless wedid not yet trust him. At the third feeding his feathers began to be so curi-ously coloured that in all my life I never saw such beautiful colours. He wasalso exceedingly tame, and behaved himself so friendlily with us, that (theVirgin consenting) we released him from his captivity. Our Virgin began: “Since by your diligence, and our old man’s consent,the bird has attained both his life and the highest perfection, this is a goodreason that he should also be joyfully consecrated by us.” Herewith she commanded that dinner should be brought, and that weshould again refresh ourselves, since the most troublesome part of our workwas now over, and it was fitting that we should begin to enjoy our pastlabours. We began to make ourselves merry together. However, we still hadall our mourning clothes on, which seemed somewhat reproachful to ourmirth. Now the Virgin was perpetually inquisitive, perhaps to find towhich of us her future purpose might prove serviceable. But her discoursewas for the most part about Melting; and it pleased her well when oneseemed expert in such compendious manuals as do particularly commendan artist. This dinner lasted not more than three quarters of an hour, which"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Page 73we still for the most part spent with our bird, and we had to constantly feedhim with his food, but he still remained much the same size. After dinnerwe were not allowed long to digest our food, before the Virgin, togetherwith the bird, departed from us.The fifth room was set open to us, where we went as before, and offeredour services. In this room a bath was prepared for our bird, which was socoloured with a fine white powder that it had the appearance of milk. Nowit was at first cool when the bird was set into it. He was mighty well pleasedwith it, drinking of it, and pleasantly sporting in it. But after it began toheat because of the lamps that were placed under it, we had enough to doto keep him in the bath. We therefore clapped a cover on the vessel, andallowed him to thrust his head out through a hole, till he had in this waylost all his feathers in the bath, and was as smooth as a new-born child; yetthe heat did him no further harm, at which I much marveled, for the feath-ers were completely consumed in this bath, and the bath was thereby tingedblue. At length we gave the bird air, and he sprang out of the vessel of hisown accord, and he was so glitteringly smooth that it was a pleasure tobehold. But because he was still somewhat wild, we had to put a collar witha chain about his neck, and so led him up and down the room. Meanwhilea strong fire was made under the vessel, and the bath boiled away till it allcame down to a blue stone, which we took out, and having first poundedit, ground it with a stone, and finally with this colour began to paint thebird’s skin all over. Now he looked much more strange, for he was all blue,except the head, which remained white. Herewith our work on this storey was performed, and we (after the Vir-gin with her blue bird was departed from us) were called up through thehole to the sixth storey, where we were greatly troubled. For in the middlewas placed a little altar, in every way like that in the King’s hall abovedescribed. Upon this stood the six aforementioned particulars, and he him-self (the bird) made the seventh. First of all the little fountain was set beforehim, out of which he drunk a good draught. Afterwards he pecked thewhite serpent until she bled a great deal. This blood we had to receive intoa golden cup, and pour it down the bird’s throat, who was greatly averse toit. Then we dipped the serpent’s head in the fountain, upon which sherevived again, and crept into her death’s-head, so that I saw her no more fora long time after. Meantime the sphere turned constantly, until it made thedesired conjunction. Immediately the watch struck one, upon whichanother conjunction was set going. Then the watch struck two."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Page 74Finally, while we were observing the third conjunction, and this wasindicated by the watch, the poor bird submissively laid down his neck uponthe book of his own accord, and willingly allowed his head to be smittenoff (by one of us chosen for this by lot). However, he yielded not a drop ofblood until his breast was opened, and then the blood spurted out so freshand clear as if it had been a fountain of rubies. His death went to our hearts,and yet we could well judge that a naked bird would stand us in little stead.So we let it be, and moved the little altar away and assisted the Virgin toburn the body to ashes (together with the little tablet hanging by) with firekindled by the little taper; and afterwards to cleanse the same several times,and to lay them in a box of cypress wood. Here I cannot conceal what a trick was played on myself and three oth-ers. After we had thus diligently taken up the ashes, the Virgin began tospeak as follows: “My lords, here we are in the sixth room, and we haveonly one more before us, in which our trouble will be at an end, and thenwe shall return home again to our castle, to awaken our most graciousLords and Ladies. Now I could heartily wish that all of you, as you are heretogether, had behaved yourselves in such a way that I might have com-mended to our most renowned King and Queen, and you might haveobtained a suitable reward; yet contrary to my desire, I have found amongstyou these four lazy and sluggish workers (herewith she pointed at me andthree others). Yet, according to my goodwill to each and every one, I amnot willing to deliver them up to deserved punishment. However, so thatsuch negligence may not remain wholly unpunished, I am resolved thusconcerning them, that they shall only be excluded from the future seventhand most glorious action of all the rest, and so they shall incur no furtherblame from their Royal Majesties.” In what a state we now were at this speech I leave others to consider. Forthe Virgin knew so well how to keep her countenance, that the water soonran over our baskets, and we esteemed ourselves the most unhappy of allmen. After this the Virgin caused one of her maids (of whom there weremany always at hand) to fetch the musicians, who were to blow us out ofdoors with cornets, with such scorn and derision that they themselvescould hardly blow for laughing. But it afflicted us particularly greatly thatthe Virgin so vehemently laughed at our weeping, anger and impatience,and that there might well perhaps be some amongst our companions whowere glad of this misfortune of ours."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Page 75But it proved otherwise, for as soon as we had come out of the door, themusicians told us to be of good cheer and follow them up the windingstairs. They led us up to the seventh floor under the roof, where we foundthe old man, whom we had not hitherto seen, standing upon a little roundfurnace. He received us friendlily, and heartily congratulated us that we hadbeen chosen for this by the Virgin; but after he understood the fright wehad received, his belly was ready to burst with laughing that we had takensuch good fortune so badly. “Hence,” said he, “my dear sons, learn that man never knows how wellGod intended him.”During this discourse the Virgin also came running in with her littlebox, and (after she had laughed at us enough) emptied her ashes intoanother vessel, and filled hers again with other stuff, saying she must nowgo and cast a mist before the other artists’ eyes, and that we in the mean-time should obey the old lord in whatsoever he commanded us, and notremit our former diligence. Herewith she departed from us into the seventhroom into which she called our companions. Now what she did first withthem there, I cannot tell, for not only were they most earnestly forbiddento speak of it, but we also, because of our work, did not dare peep on themthrough the ceiling. But this was our work. We had to moisten the ashes with our previouslyprepared water until they became altogether like a very thin dough, afterwhich we set the matter over the fire, till it was well heated. Then we castit, hot like this, into two little forms or moulds, and let it cool a little. Here we had leisure to look a while at our companions through certaincrevices made in the floor. They were now very busy at a furnace, and eachhad to blow up the fire himself with a pipe, and they stood blowing about itlike this, as if they were wondrously preferred before us in this. And thisblowing lasted until our old man roused us to our work again, so that I can-not say what was done afterwards. We opened our little forms, and there appeared two beautiful, bright andalmost transparent little images, the like of which man’s eye never saw, amale and a female, each of them only four inches long, and what surprisedus most greatly was that they were not hard, but lithe and fleshy, like otherhuman bodies, yet they had no life; so that I most assuredly believe that theLady Venus’s image was also made after some such manner.These angelically fair babes we first laid upon two little satin cushions,and looked at them for a good while, till we were almost besotted by such"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Page 76exquisite objects. The old lord warned us to forbear, and continually toinstil the blood of the bird (which had been received into a little goldencup) drop after drop into the mouths of the little images, from which theyappeared to increase; and whereas they were before very small, they werenow (according to proportion) much more beautiful, so that all paintersought to have been here, and would have been ashamed of their art inrespect of these productions of nature. Now they began to grow so big thatwe lifted them from the little cushions, and had to lay them upon a longtable, which was covered with white velvet. The old man also commandedus to cover them over up to the breast with a piece of the fine white doubletaffeta, which, because of their unspeakable beauty, almost went against us.But to be brief, before we had quite used up the blood in this way, theywere already in their perfect full growth. They had golden-yellow, curlyhair, and the above-mentioned figure of Venus was nothing to them. But there was not yet any natural warmth or sensibility in them. Theywere dead figures, yet of a lively and natural colour; and since care was tobe taken that they did not grow too big, the old man would not permitanything more to be given to them, but covered their faces too with thesilk, and caused the table to be stuck round about with torches. Here I mustwarn the reader not to imagine these lights to have been put there out ofnecessity, for the old man’s intent hereby was only that we should notobserve when the soul entered into them; and indeed we should not havenoticed it, had I not twice before seen the flames. However, I permitted theother three to remain with their own belief, neither did the old man knowthat I had seen anything more. Hereupon he asked us to sit down on abench over against the table. Presently the Virgin came in too, with the music and all necessities, andcarried two curious white garments, the like of which I had never seen inthe castle, nor can I describe them, for I thought that they were nothingother than crystal; but they were soft, and not transparent; so that I cannotdescribe them. These she laid down on a table, and after she had disposedher virgins upon a bench round about, she and the old man began manyslight-of-hand tricks about the table, which was done only to blind us. This(as I told you) was managed under the roof, which was wonderfullyformed; for on the inside it was arched into seven hemispheres, of whichthe middlemost was somewhat the highest, and had at the top a little roundhole, which was nevertheless shut, and was observed by no-one else."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Page 77After many ceremonies six virgins came in, each of whom carried a largetrumpet, around which were rolled a green, glittering and burning materiallike a wreath. The old man took one of these, and after he had removedsome of the lights at the top of the table, and uncovered their faces, heplaced one of the trumpets upon the mouth of one of the bodies in such away that the upper and wider end of it was directed just towards the afore-mentioned hole. Here my companions always looked at the images, but Ihad other thoughts, for as soon as the foliage or wreath about the shank ofthe trumpet was kindled, I saw the hole at the top open, and a brightstream of fire shooting down the tube, and passing into the body; where-upon the hole was covered again, and the trumpet removed. With thisdevice my companions were deluded, so that they imagined that life cameinto the image by means of the fire of the foliage, for as soon as he receivedthe soul his eyes twinkled, although he hardly stirred. The second time heplaced another tube upon its mouth, and kindled it again, and the soul waslet down through the tube. This as repeated for each of them three times,after which all the lights were extinguished and carried away. The velvetcoverings of the table were cast over them, and immediately a birthing bedwas unlocked and made ready, into which, thus wrapped up, they wereborn. And after the coverings were taken off them, they were neatly laid byeach other, and with the curtains drawn before them, they slept a goodwhile.Now it was also time for the Virgin to see how other artists behavedthemselves. They were well pleased because, as the Virgin afterwardsinformed me, they were to work in gold, which is indeed a piece of thisart, but not the most principal, most necessary, and best. They had indeedtoo a part of these ashes, so that they imagined nothing other than that thewhole bird was provided for the sake of gold, and that life must thereby berestored to the deceased.Meantime we sat very still, waiting for our married couple to awake.About half an hour was spent like this. Then the wanton Cupid presentedhimself again, and after he had saluted us all, flew to them behind the cur-tain, tormenting them until they awakened. This was a cause of greatamazement to them, for they imagined that they had slept from the veryhour in which they were beheaded until now. Cupid, after he had awak-ened them, and renewed their acquaintance with one another, steppedaside a little, and allowed them both to get themselves together a bit better,"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Page 78meantime playing his tricks with us; and at length he wanted to have themusic brought in, to be somewhat merrier. Not long after, the Virgin herself came in, and after she had most hum-bly saluted the young King and Queen (who found themselves rather faint)and kissed their hands, she brought them the two aforementioned strangegarments, which they put on, and so stepped forth. Now there werealready prepared two very strange chairs, in which they placed themselves.And they were congratulated with most profound reverence by us, forwhich the King himself most graciously returned his thanks, and again reas-sured us of all grace.It was already about five o’clock, so they could no longer stay, but assoon as the best of their furniture could be laden, we had to attend theyoung Royal Persons down the winding stairs, through all doors andwatches to the ship. In this they embarked, together with certain virginsand Cupid, and sailed so very swiftly that we soon lost sight of them; butthey were met (as I was informed) by certain stately ships. Thus in fourhours’ time they had gone many leagues out to sea. After five o’clock themusicians were charged to carry all things back again to the ships, and tomake themselves ready for the voyage. But because this took rather a longtime, the old lord commanded a party of his concealed soldiers to comeout. They had hitherto been planted in a wall, so that we had not noticedany of them, whereby I observed that this Tower was well provided againstopposition. Now these soldiers made quick work with our stuff, so thatnothing more remained to be done but to go to supper. The table being completely furnished, the Virgin brought us again toour companions, where we were to carry ourselves as if we had truly beenin a lamentable condition, and forbear laughing. But they were always smil-ing to one another, although some of them sympathised with us too. At thissupper the old lord was also with us, who was a most sharp inspector overus; for no-one could propound anything so discreetly, but he knew eitherhow to confute it, or to amend it, or at least to give some good informationon it. I learned a great deal from this lord, and it would be very good ifeach one would apply themselves to him, and take notice of his procedure,for then things would not miscarry so often and so unfortunately.After we had taken our nocturnal refreshment, the old lord took us intohis closets of rarities, which were dispersed here and there amongst the bul-warks; where we saw such wonderful productions of Nature, and otherthings too which man’s wit, in imitation of Nature, had invented, that we"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Page 79needed another year to survey them sufficiently. Thus we spent a good partof the night by candlelight. At last, because we were more inclined to sleepthan to see many rarities, we were lodged in rooms in the wall, where wehad not only costly and good beds, but also extraordinarily handsomechambers, which made us wonder all the more why we were forced toundergo so many hardships the day before. In this chamber I had good rest,and being for the most part without care, and weary with continual labour,the gentle rushing of the sea helped me to a sound and sweet sleep, for Icontinued in one dream from eleven o’clock till eight in the morning."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Page 80"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Page 81The Seventh Dayfter eight o’clock I woke up, and quickly made myself ready,wanting to return again into the Tower; but the dark passages inthe wall were so many and various, that I wandered a goodwhile before I could find the way out. The same happened tothe rest too, till at last we all met again in the nethermost vault, and entirelyyellow apparel was given to us, together with our golden fleeces. At thistime the Virgin declared to us that we were Knights of the Golden Stone,of which we were before ignorant. After we had made ourselves ready, and taken our breakfast, the old manpresented each of us with a medal of gold. On one side were these words:AR. NAT. MI.(Art is the Priestess of Nature)On the other these:TEM. NA. F.(Nature is the Daughter of Time.)He exhorted us moreover that we should try to take nothing more thanthis token of remembrance. Herewith we went forth to the sea, where ourships lay, so richly equipped that it was not possible but that such amazingthings must first have been brought there. The ships were twelve in num-ber, six of ours, and six of the old lord’s, who caused his ships to befreighted with well appointed soldiers. But he himself came to us in ourship, where we were all together. In the first the musicians, of which theold lord also had a great number, seated themselves; they sailed before us toshorten the time. Our flags were the twelve celestial signs, and we sat inLibra. Besides other things our ship also had a noble and curious clock,which showed us all the minutes. The sea was so calm, too, that it was asingular pleasure to sail. But what surpassed all the rest was the old man’sdiscourse; he knew so well how to pass away our time with wonderful sto-ries, that I could have been content to sail with him all my life long. Meanwhile the ships passed on in haste, for before we had sailed twohours the mariner told us that he already saw the whole lake almost coveredwith ships, by which we could conjecture that they had come out to meetA"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Page 82us, which proved true. For as soon as we had come out of the sea into thelake by the aforementioned river, there before us were five hundred ships,one of which sparkled with gold and precious stones, and in which sat theKing and Queen, together with other lords, ladies, and virgins of highbirth. As soon as they were well in sight of us the pieces were discharged onboth sides, and there was such a din of trumpets, shalms, and kettle drumsthat all the ships upon the sea capered again. Finally, as soon as we camenear they brought our ships together, and so made a stand. Immediately the old Atlas stepped forth on the King’s behalf, making ashort but handsome oration, in which he welcomed us, and asked whetherthe Royal Presents were ready. The rest of my companions were in greatamazement, where this King should come from, for they imagined nothingother than that they would have to awaken him again. We allowed them tocontinue in their amazement, and acted as if it seemed strange to us too.After Atlas’ oration out stepped our old man, making a rather longer reply,in which he wished the King and Queen all happiness and increase, afterwhich he delivered up a curious small casket. What was in it, I do notknow, but it was committed to Cupid to keep, who hovered between theKing and Queen. After the oration was finished, they again let off a joyful volley of shot,and so we sailed on a good time together, till at length we arrived atanother shore. This was near the first gate at which I first entered. At thisplace again there attended a great multitude of the King’s family togetherwith some hundreds of horses. Now as soon as we came to shore, and dis-embarked, the King and Queen presented their hands to all of us, everyone, with singular kindness; and so we were to get up on horseback.Here I wish to friendlily entreat the reader not to interpret the followingnarration as any vain glory or pride of mine, but to credit me this much,that if there had not been a special necessity for it, I could very well haveutterly concealed this honour which was shown me. We were all one afteranother distributed amongst the lords. But our old lord, and I, mostunworthy, were to ride alongside the King, each of us bearing a snow-white ensign with a red cross. Indeed, I was made use of because of my age,for we both had long grey beards and hair. I had also fastened my tokensabout my hat, which the young King soon noticed, and asked if I were hewho could redeem these tokens at the gate? I answered in most humble manner, “Ye s”. But he laughed at me, saying, “There was no need for ceremony; I wasHIS father”."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Page 83Then he asked me with what I had redeemed them? I replied, “With Water and Salt”. Whereupon he wondered who had made me so wise; upon which Igrew a bit more confident, and recounted to him how it had happenedwith my bread, the Dove and the Raven, and he was pleased with it andsaid expressly that it must be that God had herein vouchsafed me a singularhappiness. With this we came to the first gate where the Porter with the blueclothes waited, bearing in his hand a supplication. Now as soon as he sawme alongside the King, he delivered me the supplication, most humblybeseeching me to mention his ingenuity to the King. Now in the first placeI asked the King what the condition of this porter was. He friendlilyanswered me, that he was a very famous and rare astrologer, and always inhigh regard with the Lord his Father, but having once committed a faultagainst Venus, and seen her in her bed of rest, this punishment was there-fore imposed upon him, that he should wait at the first gate for so longuntil someone should release him from it. I replied, “May he then be released?” “Ye s ,” said the King, “if anyone can be found that has transgressed ashighly as himself, he must take his place, and the other shall be free.” This went to my heart, for my conscience convinced me that I was theoffender, yet I kept quiet, and herewith delivered the supplication. As soonas he had read it, he was greatly terrified, so that the Queen (who with ourvirgins, and that other Duchess as well - whom I mentioned at the hangingof the weights - rode just behind us) observed this, and therefore asked himwhat this letter might mean. But he had no mind to take any notice of it,and putting away the paper, began to talk about other matters, till thus inabout three hours’ time we came to the castle, where we alighted, andwaited upon the King as he went into his hall.Immediately the King called for the old Atlas to come to him in a littlecloset, and showed him the writing, and Atlas did not tarry, but rode outagain to the Porter to get more information on the matter. After this theyoung King, with his spouse, and the other lords, ladies and virgins, satdown. Then our Virgin began to highly commend the diligence we hadshown, and the pains and labour we had undergone, requesting that wemight be royally rewarded, and that she might be permitted to enjoy thebenefit of her commission from then on. Then the old lord stood up too,and attested that all the Virgin had said was true, and that it was only justthat we should both be contented on both our parts. Hereupon we were to"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Page 84step forward a little, and it was concluded that each man should make somepossible wish, and accordingly obtain it; for it was not to be doubted thatthose of understanding would also make the best wish. So we were to con-sider it until after supper. Meantime the King and Queen, for recreation’s sake, began to playtogether, at something which looked not unlike chess, only it had differentrules; for it was the Virtues and Vices one against another, and it mightingeniously be observed with what plots the Vices lay in wait for the Vir-tues, and how to re-encounter them again. This was so properly and clev-erly performed, that it is to be wished that we had the same game too.During the game, in came Atlas again, and made his report in private, but Iblushed all over, for my conscience gave me no rest. After this the King gave me the supplication to read, and the contents ofit were much to this purpose. First he (the doorkeeper) wished the Kingprosperity, and increase, and that his seed might be spread abroad far andwide. Afterwards he remonstrated that the time was now come in whichaccording to the royal promise he ought to be released, because Venus hadalready been uncovered by one of his guests, for his observations could notlie to him. And that if his Majesty would be pleased to make a strict anddiligent enquiry, he would find that she had been uncovered, and if thisshould not prove to be so, he would be content to remain before the gateall the days of his life. Then he asked in the most humble manner, thatupon peril of body and life he might be permitted to be present at thisnight’s supper. He was hoping to seek out the very offender, and obtain hisdesired freedom. This was expressly and handsomely indicated, by which Icould well perceive his ingenuity, but it was too sharp for me, and I wouldnot have minded if I had never seen it. Now I was wondering whether hemight perhaps be helped through my wish, so I asked the King whether hemight not be released some other way.“No,” replied the King, “because there is a special consideration in thebusiness. However, for this night, we may well gratify him in his desire.” Sohe sent someone to fetch him in. Meanwhile the tables were prepared in aspacious room, in which we had never been before, which was so perfect,and contrived in such a manner, that it is not possible for me even to beginto describe it. We were conducted into this with singular pomp and cere-mony. Cupid was not at this time present, for (as I was informed) the dis-grace which had happened to his mother had somewhat angered him. Inbrief, my offence, and the supplication which was delivered, were an occa-"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Page 85sion of much sadness, for the King was in perplexity how to make inquisi-tion amongst his guests, and the more so because through this, even theywho were yet ignorant of the matter would come to know about it. So hecaused the Porter himself, who had already arrived, to make his strict sur-vey, and he himself acted as pleasantly as he was able. However, eventually they all began to be merry again, and to talk to oneanother with all sorts of recreative and profitable discourses. Now, how thetreatment and other ceremonies were then performed, it is not necessary todeclare, since it is neither the reader’s concern, nor serviceable to mydesign. But all exceeded more in art, and human invention, than weexceeded in drinking! And this was the last and noblest meal at which I waspresent. After the banquet the tables were suddenly taken away, and certaincurious chairs placed round about in a circle, in which we, together withthe King and Queen, and both their old men and the ladies and virgins,were to sit. After this, a very handsome page opened the above-mentioned gloriouslittle book, and Atlas immediately placed himself in the midst, and began tospeak to this purpose: that his Royal Majesty had not forgotten the servicewe had done him, and how carefully we had attended to our duty, andtherefore by way of retribution had elected all and each of us Knights of theGolden Stone. And that it was therefore further necessary not only onceagain to oblige ourselves towards his Royal Majesty, but also to vow to thefollowing articles; and then his Royal Majesty would likewise know how tobehave himself towards his liege people. Upon which he caused the page toread over the articles, which were these.(I) You my lords the Knights shall swear that you shall at no time ascribeyour order to any devil or spirit, but only to God your Creator, and hishandmaid Nature.(2) That you will abominate all whoredom, incontinency and unclean-ness, and not defile your order with such vices.(3) That you through your talents will be ready to assist all that are wor-thy, and have need of them.(4) That you desire not to employ this honour to worldly pride and highauthority.(5) That you shall not be willing to live longer than God will have youdo. At this last article we could not choose but laugh, and it may well havebeen placed after the rest only for a conceit. Now after vowing to them allby the King’s sceptre, we were afterwards installed Knights with the usual"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Page 86ceremonies, and amongst other privileges set over Ignorance, Poverty, andSickness, to handle them at our pleasure. And this was afterwards ratified ina little chapel (to which we were conducted in procession) and thanksreturned to God for it. I also hung up there at that time my golden fleeceand hat, and left them there for an eternal memorial, to the honour ofGod. And because everyone had to write his name there, I wrote thus:The highest wisdom is to know nothing.Brother Christian RosenkreutzKnight of the Golden StoneA.D. 1459.Others wrote likewise, each as it seemed good to him. After this, wewere again brought into the hall, where, having sat down, we were admon-ished quickly to think what we each one would wish. But the King and hisparty retired into a little closet, there to give audience to our wishes. Noweach man was called in separately, so that I cannot speak of any man’s ownwish. I thought nothing could be more praiseworthy than to demonstratesome laudable virtue in honour of my order, and found too that none atpresent could be better, and cost me more trouble, than Gratitude. Where-fore in spite of the fact that I might well have wished something more dearand agreeable to myself, I vanquished myself, and concluded, even at myown peril, to free the Porter, my benefactor. So as I was now called in, I was first of all asked whether, having read thesupplication, I had observed or suspected nothing concerning the offender?Upon which I began undauntedly to relate how all the business had passed,how through ignorance I fell into that mistake, and so offered myself toundergo all that I had thereby deserved. The King, and the rest of the lords,wondered greatly at so unexpected a confession, and so asked me to stepaside a little. Now as soon as I was called in again, Atlas declared to me that althoughit was grievous to the King’s Majesty that I, whom he loved above others,had fallen into such a mischance, yet because it was not possible for him totransgress his ancient usages, he did not know how to absolve me; the othermust be at liberty, and I put in his place; yet he would hope that some otherwould be apprehended, so that I might be able to go home again. However,no release was to be hoped for, till the marriage feast of his future son. This sentence had nearly cost me my life, and I first hated myself and mytwaddling tongue, in that I could not keep quiet; yet at last I took courage,"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Page 87and because I thought there was no remedy, I related how this Porter hadbestowed a token on me, and commended me to the other, by whose assis-tance I stood upon the scale, and so was made partaker of all the honourand joy already received. And therefore now it was but fair that I shouldshow myself grateful to my benefactor, and because this could not be donein any other way, I returned thanks for the sentence, and was willing gladlyto bear some inconvenience for the sake of he who had been helpful to mein coming to such a high place. But if by my wish anything might beeffected, I wished myself at home again, so that he by me, and I by my wishmight be at liberty. Answer was made me, that the wishing did not stretchso far. However, I might wish him free. Yet it was very pleasing to hisRoyal Majesty that I had behaved myself so generously in this, but he wasafraid I might still be ignorant of what a miserable condition I had plungedmyself into through my curiosity. Hereupon the good man was pro-nounced free, and I with a sad heart had to step aside.After me the rest were called for too, and came jocundly out again,which pained me still more, for I imagined nothing other than that I mustfinish my life under the gate. I also had many pensive thoughts running upand down in my head, what I should do, and how to spend the time. Atlength I considered that I was now old, and according to the course ofnature, had few years more to live. And that this anguished and melancholylife would quickly send me from this world, and then my door-keepingwould be at an end, and by a most happy sleep I might quickly bring myselfto the grave. I had many of these thoughts. Sometimes it vexed me that Ihad seen such gallant things, and must be robbed of them. Sometimes I rejoiced that still, before my end, I had been accepted to alljoy, and should not be forced to depart shamefully. This was the last andworst shock that I sustained. During my cogitations the rest had got ready. So after they had receiveda good night from the King and lords, each one was conducted into hislodging. But I, most wretched man, had nobody to show me the way, andmust moreover suffer myself to be tormented; and so that I might be cer-tain of my future function, I had to put on the ring which the other hadworn before. Finally, the King exhorted me that since this was now the lasttime I was likely to see him in this manner, I should behave myself accord-ing to my place, and not against the order. Upon which he took me in hisarms, and kissed me, all which I understood to mean that in the morning Imust sit at my gate. Now after they had all spoken friendlily to me for awhile, and at last given their hands, committing me to the Divine protec-"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Page 88tion, I was conducted by both the old men, the Lord of the Tower, andAtlas, into a glorious lodging, in which stood three beds, and each of us layin one of them, where we spent almost two, &c..... (Here about two leaves in quarto are missing, and he (the author ofthis), whereas he imagined he must in the morning be doorkeeper,returned home.)"}]
