A few basic rules should be kept in mind when performing the ritual.While in the learning stage, it is advisable not to perform the L.I.R.P. before going to sleep.The energies invoked may be too potent for a novice and therefore may disturb one's peaceof mind, making it hard to get any rest. Keep in mind that the Archangels are to be facingthe Zelator in the ritual, and lastly, that it is not necessary to perform the L.B.R.P. after theL.I.R.P. under normal circumstances. What is meant by normal circumstances is to say thatother than conditions of using the ritual for balancing, grounding and conversing with theArchangels, it is usually not necessary to banish afterwards."}]
