However, here at the Sanctuary of Ma'at we have incorporated this LesserInvoking Pentagram Ritual as an introduction ritual to the Elemental Airprinciple of nature, while still adhering to principles set forth by theFounders . This Lesser Invoking Ritual should be used as a Daily Ritualwhich will help invoke the energy and call the spiritual forces into onestemple or ritual space. It is recommended to be perfomed in the morningsfor as long as one is in the Theoricus grade."}]
