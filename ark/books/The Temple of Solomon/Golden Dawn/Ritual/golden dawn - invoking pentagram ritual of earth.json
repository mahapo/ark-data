We watch and we labor unceasingly, we seek and we hope, by thetwelve stones of the Holy City, by the buried Talismans, by the Axis of theLodestone which passes through the center of the Earth.

O Day clothed in Night! O Master who never dostwithhold the wages of Thy Workmen! O Silver Whiteness! O GoldenSplendor! O Crown of Living and Melodious Diamond! Thou who wearest theHeavens on Thy Finger like a ring of Sapphire! Thou who hidest beneath theEarth in the Kingdom of Gems, the marvelous Seed of the Stars! Live,reign, and be Thou the Eternal Dispenser of the Treasures whereof Thouhast made us the Wardens!Amen.Give the Zelator SignRepeat The Qabalistic Cross.Note: A few of the benefits that may be obtained from this ritual; it will aid in groundingmental and emotional conditions, it will allow the student to call forth the four elements ofEarth within his/her circle, and the Zelator will have the ability to commune with the greatArchangel Uriel. A few basic rules should be kept in mind when performing the ritual. Whilein the learning stage, it is advisable not to perform it before going to sleep. The energiesinvoked may be too potent for a novice and therefore may disturb one's peace of mind,making it hard to get any rest. Keep in mind that the Archangels are to be facing theZelator in the ritual, and lastly, that it is not necessary to perform the L.B.R.P. after thisunder normal circumstances. What is meant by normal circumstances is to say that otherthan conditions of using the ritual for balancing, grounding and conversing with theArchangel Auriel, it is usually not necessary to banish afterwards."}]
