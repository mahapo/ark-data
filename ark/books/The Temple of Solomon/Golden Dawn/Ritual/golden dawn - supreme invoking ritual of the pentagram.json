The LVX Signs vs. the Portal Signs:\"In some of the rituals suggested in this curriculum, (the SIRP, the SBRP, the BRH, andRegardie's Opening by Watchtower) call for the initiate to give the LVX Signs after tracingthe Spirit pentagrams.This is because traditionally, advanced rituals of is type were performed only by initiates inthe grade of Adeptus Minor (or higher). The LVX Signs are the grade signs of an AdeptusMinor, not necessarily the grade sign of the Element of Spirit. The Fifth Element is conferredon an initiate in the Portal grade, and therefore the grade signs of Spirit are the Openingand Closing of the Veil, just as the grade sign for Air is that of the Theoricus. Itis therefore apropriate for the Portal initiate to freely substitute the PortalSigns for the LVX signs [Rendering for the SIRP, Closing for the SBRP].We realize, however, that many students have already been performingthese rituals with the traditional LVX Signs, and may be reluctant to switchto the portal Signs. Therefore we have presented the rituals in this coursewith the traditional LVX Signs, and leave the option open for the individualto choose.\"Excerpted from the \"Self-Initiation into the Golden Dawn Tradition,\" Chic and TabathaCicero, 1998, Llewellyn Publications, St. Paul, Min."}]
