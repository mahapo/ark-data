The practice of fortune-telling is based on the falsenotion that human life is governed by luck, chance, or fate—by obscure powers at work outsidethe personality. True divination rests upon the occult truth that the causes of all events inhuman life are really internal, proceeding from the Cause of Causes—the Universal IntelligentEnergy or Life-power which is the Source, Mover and Knower behind all the phenomena of theuniverse.Because this Universal Intelligent Energy is omnipresent, it must necessarily be a real presenceat any given point in space. Consequently it must be the real Presence at the heart of everyhuman personality. That Presence is the True Self, the real I AM, the Concealed Divinity in theshrine of the temple of personality. This True self is the author of all phenomena, and itsperfect knowledge includes all the details of phenomenal manifestation, past, present andfuture. It knows all events, and the significance of all events. Thus it knows the complete past,present and future of every human being.Ordinarily this perfect knowledge of the True Self is hidden from us; but under certainconditions some part of it may be brought down into the personal level of awareness. The rightuse of Tarot provides the necessary conditions, because Tarot is a device invented by expertpsychologists who understood the laws whereby the superconscious knowledge of the TrueSelf may be brought to bear upon the specific problems which confront us as we function at theself-conscious level of our waking existence.The Tarot Keys are composed of pictorial and geometrical symbols. These symbols are thenatural “language” of the subconscious mind, a language older than any human tongue, alanguage from which all modes of human speech have been derived. Fundamentally we think inpictures, not in words, and this pictorial language, common to the whole human race, is themeans whereby the subconscious mind may communicate to us the higher knowledge reflectedfrom the superconscious levels of the True Self.As you begin to study divination, bear in mind that it is not meant to satisfy your own oranother’s idle curiosity about the future. Take the work seriously. What you are about to learn isa method whereby you may bring to bear upon your own problems, and upon the problems ofthose who consult you, the light of the superconscious knowledge of past, present and futurewhich is characteristic of the mental activity of the One Life-power. To deal lightly with this istruly to profane the most sacred of mysteries, and the penalty for such profanation in inevitable.He who debases Tarot to mere fortune-telling will rob himself of whatever insight he maypossess. He will deceive himself and others by false visions, and may open the door todangerous obsession by inimical astral entities."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"2Oracle of TarotIntroductionThe practice of divination offers you a real opportunity to serve, and will aid you to unfoldintuitive powers of a high order. As you become more and more proficient, you will be calledupon by persons beset by all sorts of perplexities, faced by all sorts of seeming obstacles,troubled by all sorts of appearances of inharmony. As you gain their confidence they will tell youtheir inmost secrets. Never abuse that confidence. Make it a rule not to discuss the affairs ofyour consultants—not even anonymously. There is altogether too much comparison ofhoroscopes, altogether too much discussion of the affairs of clients, in certain circles of personsinterested in astrology, palmistry, numerology, and other divinatory arts.Furthermore, avoid personal judgement of the lives of your consultants. Even when their viewsand conduct differ radically from your opinions and standards, remember that everycondemnatory judgement is evidence that he who makes it is himself more or less in the dark.To divine well you must be in sympathetic rapport with your consultants, and there can be nosympathy where there is condemnation.After these preliminary observations we may proceed to a brief examination of...The Tarot PackFor divination the best pack of Tarot cards now available is that given with this course ofLessons. It was drawn by J. A. Knapp under the supervision of Manly P. Hall, and is an excellentexample of the exoteric Tarot. It has, furthermore, the decided advantage that the cards are ofsuch size that they may be conveniently shuffled and dealt.In calling this an exoteric pack I mean that it is simply a better-drawn and better-colored versionof that version of Tarot issued, some centuries ago, by the Western School of occult adepts,who purposely disguised it as a game. The Keys of this exoteric pack, particularly the picture-cards called major trumps or greater arcana, are neither so exact nor so explicit in theirsymbolism as are the cards of the esoteric Tarot. The later, at this writing, has not beenpublished. The Rider pack, designed under the supervision of A. E. Waite, approximates theesoteric version. So does the set of major trumps drawn by Jessie Burns Parke some years sinceat my suggestion. Waite’s version and mine approximate the esoteric designs we have bothseen. The present pack of Mr. Knapp’s is practically the same as any good example ofeighteenth century exoteric packs, except for the small symbols added at Manly Hall’ssuggestion, which are mostly good. And the symbolism of these Keys is sufficiently exact forevery purpose of divination. Even for the higher uses of Tarot it is not wholly incorrect.In the original exoteric Tarot no Hebrew letters were printed on the major trumps. SinceEliphas Levi wrote The Dogma and Ritual of Transcendental Magic nearly all books on Tarothave reproduced the “blind” attribution of the letters to the major trumps first published in thatremarkable volume. C. C. Zain uses yet another attribution, but if it is compared with that givenbelow its inadequacy becomes evident. I have dealt with this whole matter in other of mywritings. Here it is enough to say that Levi knew the correct attribution, but was under"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"3obligation not to reveal it. Hence he chose a blind which would lead the more discerningamong his readers to discover the correct arrangement. Unfortunately, those of his admirersand disciples who have written books about the Tarot (including Papus, Stanislas de Guiata, Dr.and Mrs. Curtis, Manly P. Hall, and others of lesser note) have either failed to perceive Levi’sblind, or else have felt themselves bound to perpetuate it.The true arrangement, long held in reserve by the School of Adepts who originally issued theTarot as we now have it, came by accident into the possession of the founders of the HermeticOrder of the Golden Dawn. A former member of that society, convinced that its claim to directconnection with the Secret Chiefs of the True Rosicrucian Order was a false claim, broke awayfrom the Hermetic Order, published its rituals, and also made public the attribution givenbelow. Three years prior to this I had myself been led to the discovery of the true arrangement,which follows:Figure 1-1Hebrew Attributions of the Major Trumps1Aleph(A)0Le Fou2Beth(B)1Le Bateleur3Gimel(G)2La Papesse4Daleth(D)3L'imperatrice5Heh(H)4L'empereur6Vau(V)5Le Pape7Zain(Z)6L'amoureux8Cheth(Ch)7Le Chariot9Teth(T)11La Force10Yod(I)9L'ermite20Kaph(K)10La Roue de la Fortune30Lamed(L)8La Justice40Mem(M)12Le Pendu50Nun(N)13La Mort60Samekh(S)14La Temperance70Ayin(O)15Le Diable80Peh(P)16Le Feu Du Ciel90Tzaddi(Tz)17Les Etoiles100Qoph(Q)18La Lune200Resh(R)19Le Soleil300Shin(Sh)20Le Jugement400Tau(Th)21Le Monde"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"4Oracle of TarotIntroductionThis arrangement enables us to determine the astrological meanings of the major trumps. Thekey to these meanings is partially given in the various printed versions of the Hebrew Book ofFormation, or Sepher Yetzirah. All versions of this book agree that the mother letters, Aleph,Mem and Shin represent the elements Air, Water and Fire. All versions also agree that thesimple letters Heh, Vau, Zain, Cheth, Teth, Yod, Lamed, Nun, Samekh, Ayin, Tzaddi and Qophrepresent the signs of the zodiac. But none of the published versions agree as to the attributionof the seven heavenly bodies known in ancient astrology to the seven double letters, Beth,Gimel, Daleth, Kaph, Peh, Resh and Tau. These were probably kept secret when the Book ofFormation was first published, for fear that the correct arrangement might lead to thepremature disclosure of certain practical secrets. But as the correct arrangement has now cometo light, its accuracy will be obvious to every really competent symbolist. Learn theseattributions by heart, so thoroughly that you recall them without the least effort.Figure 1-2:Astrological Attributions of the Major Trumps0Le FouAir; Uranus1Le BateleurMercury2La PapesseThe Moon3L'ImperatriceVenus4L'EmpereurAries5Le PapeTaurus6L'AmoureuxGemini7Le ChariotCancer8La JusticeLibra9L'ErmiteVirgo10La Roue de la FortuneJupiter11La ForceLeo12Le PenduWater; Neptune13La MortScorpio14La TemperanceSagittarius15Le DiableCapricorn16Le Feu du CielMars17Les EtoilesAquarius18La LunePisces19Le SoleilThe Sun20Le JugementFire; Pluto(?); Vulcan21Le MondeSaturn; Earth"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"5N.B.In the esoteric Tarot the numbers of the Keys corresponding to Leo and Libra are differentfrom those given above. In the esoteric pack Strength, corresponding to Leo, is numbered 8,and Justice, corresponding to Libra, is numbered 11. So also in Waite’s Tarot and in thosewhich I use for philosophical work.Besides the 22 major trumps there are 56 minor trumps similar to ordinary playing-cards, whichare derived from the Tarot. The minor trumps comprise ten spot-cards numbered from Ace to10, arranged in four suits, which are: Wands (Clubs); Cups (Hearts); Swords (Spades); Pentaclesor Coins (Diamonds).In addition to these numbered cards, each suit includes four court-cards. In the Knapp packthese are designated by letters, as follows: King (K); Queen (Q); Knight or Warrior (W); Page orServant (S).Kings represent Spirit; Queens are symbols of Soul; Knights or Warriors correspond to the astralbody; Pages or Servants represent the physical body. These are their more general meanings.Their particular divinatory meanings will be given in the lessons wherein the separate cards ofeach suit are explained from the divinatory standpoint.The general divinatory meaning of the four suits of minor trumps is as follows, but each cardhas a separate meaning to be considered later:Figure 1-3:Divinatory Meanings of the Four SuitsThis suit......represents these concepts......and element.WandsWork, enterprise, ideas; the energies of thespiritual plane or archetypal world (Plato’sworld of ideas)FireCupsDesires, hopes, wishes; emotional activities;the states and forces of the mental plane,the creative world in which mental patternsare formulated;WaterSwordsAction, and therefore conflict of forces; thestates and activities of the astral plane, theformative world of unseen forces whichbuild the conditions of the physical plane;AirCoins orPentaclesThings, possessions; the concrete objectsand bodies of the physical plane; theobjectification of the energies and forces ofthe higher worlds or planes represented byWands, Cups and Swords;Earth"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"6Oracle of TarotIntroductionThe SignificatorThis is the card chosen to represent the Querant, or person for whom a divination is made. Thismay be Le Bateleur (Key 1) for a man, or La Papesse (Key 2) for a woman. In a subsequentlesson you will find a method for selecting the Significator, based on the Querant’s birth-date;but many good diviners invariably use Le Bateleur for a man, and La Papesse for a woman.Formulating The QuestionThis is the first step in a divination. When you divine for yourself, state the question as youbegin to shuffle the entire pack. If you are divining for another person, let the Querantformulate his question as you begin to shuffle the cards. If the Querant has formulated hisquestion before sitting down opposite you at the table where the divination is to be made, bidhim or her concentrate upon the question, and, if possible, endeavor to restate it while you areshuffling. This formulation of the question by the Querant is wholly mental, and the Querantshould be careful to say nothing whatever, at the beginning of the divination, that will indicatethe nature of the question.First OperationThe diviner shuffles the entire pack until he feels like stopping the shuffle, or until the packbegins to feel heavy in his hands. One comes soon to recognize this feeling. While shufflingthe diviner should mentally and most earnestly invoke the aid of the true self toassist in the operation.After the shuffle the diviner hands the entire pack to the Querant, who cuts it once, completingthe cut so that the portion of the pack which was at the bottom when the Querant received itfrom the diviner is now on top.The diviner now takes the cards, and with his left hand cuts the pack into two piles, from rightto left, on the table before him, thus:PilePile12He then cuts each of these into tow piles, again to the left, and with his left hand, so that Pile 3is taken from Pile 1, and Pile 4 from Pile 2, as shown below.PilePilePilePile4231These four piles of cards, counting from right to left, represent the four letters of the Hebrewdivine name, YOD-HEH-VAU-HEH (IHVH, or Jehovah), thus:"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"7HEH 2VAUHEH 1YODPilePilePilePile4231The diviner now examines these piles of cards, to find in which one the Significator, (Bateleuror Papesse) is located.If the Significator appears in the YOD Pile (No. 1) the diviner says to the Querant: “Yourquestion is about the beginning of some enterprise, about the root-ideas behind some matter.It is more concerned with causes than with outward conditions, and may have to do with thespiritual life.”If the Significator appears in the HEH Pile (No. 3), the diviner says: “Your question has to dowith your desires and wishes, with the formation of plans, with some state of your emotions oraffections, with matters in which your feelings are deeply affected.”If the Significator is in the VAU Pile (No. 2), the diviner says: “You want to know what to do,what action is best to bring about some result, either to avoid some conflict with others, or toovercome some conflict which has already come up. Your question is somehow connected withinharmony, with disappointment, either actual or threatened.”If the Significator be in the 2nd HEH Pile (Pile 4), the diviner says: “Your question has to dowith the things of the outer world, or practical life. It is almost wholly concerned with materialaffairs.”The beginner will do well to commit these paragraphs to memory, until he has progressed farenough to depend more completely on intuition. In any case the substance of what the divinersays to the Querant is always as above.Be careful at this point not to let the Querant state his question to you. You should be able tostate it to him, by reason of the position of the Significator. You may have to add some fewwords of explanation to those suggested above, but unless the Querant acknowledges that youhave correctly determined the main substance of his question, abandon the attempt to divinefor him, and do not resume it for at least two hours. Better still, wait until the next day. If youare unable to determine the nature of the question by the position of the Significator thedivination is “not radical,” as astrologers say of those indications in a horary chart which indicatethat no attempt should made to give advice or delineation. Never proceed with a divinationunless you have been successful in this first operation."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"8Oracle of TarotIntroductionPracticeBefore continuing with the next lesson, you should practice every day, at first by yourself, andthen with a sympathetic friend. Carry the whole first operation through, up to the formulationof the question, in accordance with the position of the Significator. Put a different question, anda different kind of a question, each time. Keep a record of your practice, in which you note:1.the number of attempts;2.the number of times the Significator fell in a pile that corresponded to the question;3.the number of times the Significator did not so fall.Continue this preliminary practice for at least one week before going further."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"9Lesson 2: The Suit Of WandsTAKE the 14 cards of the suit of Wands from your pack, and put the Servant or Page face up onthe table before you. On this put the Warrior, then the Queen, then the King, then the spot-cards, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, Ace. You will then have all the Wands in a pile, face up, with theAce on top and the Servant at the bottom. This is the order of the following paragraphs. As youread a paragraph look again and again at the card it describes. When you have finished the firstparagraph, turn over the Ace, to the left, as you would the page of a book.

If it does, say: “Thedominant ideas in relation to your question had their origin in some idea which you held in thepast.” If the Significator is not in this pile, look to see if there are any cards of the Wand suittherein. Read each of these as you come to it, counting from the face of the small pack, held inyour hand. But read it always in the past tense. If neither the Significator nor any cards of theWand suit are in this pile of cards, put it aside, and say: “Your question is little concerned withany idea formulated by you in the past,” and go on to the next step of the operation.5.Turn Pile 2 face up, and look for the Significator. If it is in this pile say: “The dominant ideas inrelation to your question have to do with something in the immediate present, or have justbeen formulated.” If the Significator is not in this pile, read any cards of the Wand suit you mayfind in it, but always in relation to the present.6.Turn up Pile 3, and repeat as before, except that all the reading from this group of cards inrelated to the future, and it is in relation to this pile that most of your advice to the Querant willbe given.N.B.No matter what Pile the Significator is in, read whatever cards of the Wand suit you find ineither of the three piles. The point about the Significator is simply that it shows the Querant'spersonal attitude to be more particularly related either to past, present, or future.Shuffle the cards so that some of them will be reversed. For the purpose of this kind of reading,those which are upside-down are regarded as being ill-dignified.This type of divination, which will be elaborated in subsequent lessons so as to include thecards of all four suits, and those of the major trumps, may be used for practice in learning theattributions, and should be the only method employed for any but really serious questions.

Just as the Cups in Tarot are not, on the whole, so fortunate as Heartsare taken to be in ordinary fortune-telling, so the Swords, as symbols of Air or the Life-Breath,are less adverse than Spades are usually supposed to be. Lay out the cards for study as in thepreceding two lessons.Ace of SwordsThe ankh cross, similar to a Venus symbol, represents the union of positive and negative forces,and thus corresponds to VAU, the third letter of the Great Name, IHVH. The Swords are allsymbols of AIR, which is alchemically the mixture of the hot and dry nature of FIRE with thecool and moist nature of WATER, but with the heat and dryness predominant over the cold andmoisture. Thus AIR is more fiery than watery, and there is a closer affinity between Swords andWands than between Swords and Cups. The Ace of Swords symbolizes Invoked Force, by way ofcontrast to the Natural Force typified by the Ace of Wands.Occult titleThe root of the powers of air.MeaningsIn the Knapp Tarot it is shown point downward, but this represents its evil and negativesignificance, for in ceremonial magic the sword in this position is used for the invocation of theevil and demonic forces. On ancient exoteric and esoteric versions of this Key the single swordoften is shown with its point upward, and the point is surrounded by a radiant Crown,symbolizing the invocation of spiritual Radiance. Thus, in using this card, it is to be consideredIll-dignified if it appears with the point of the sword down, and Well-dignified if in the reverseposition.Time periodFrom Libra 0 to the end of Sagittarius, September 23rd to December 21st, representing theconjoined powers of Venus, Mars and Jupiter.KeywordActivity, particularly mental force in operation."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"30Oracle of TarotSuit of SwordsTwo of SwordsHere also the symbolism is better when the points of the swords point upward.

Read them with especial reference to the types of activity bearingon the Querant's problem. From them, also, may be gained some hints as to the subtler forcesplaying upon the Querant and those other persons who are involved in his problem, for theSword suit always refers to the influences of the astral plane.You will notice that the 2, 3, and 4 of a suit always refer to the decanates of the cardinal sign ofthe element to which the suit corresponds. The 5, 6 and 7 always refer to the three decanates ofthe fixed sign of that element. The 8, 9 and 10 always refer to the three decanates of themutable and common sign.Kings have their principal influence in the cardinal sign of the element to which the suitcorresponds. Queens refer to the fixed sign of that element. Warriors refer to the mutable orcommon sign. Thus there is an affinity between Kings and the 2, 3 or 4 of a suit; between theQueen and the 5, 6 or 7; and between the Warrior and the 8, 9, and 10.

Alwayssay whatever you are impelled to say, even though in so doing you may be departing a littlefrom the strict significance of the card that is your starting-point for the statement. Rememberthat you help your Querant to the degree that you get in touch with his subconsciousness, andto the degree that you keep open the channel leading to your own superconsciousness. If aperson or a scene comes into your mental field of vision very definitely, do not hesitate todescribe that person or scene. But to keep yourself from wandering off into mere personalfantasy, check your vision as you go along. You will find that if you make a statement with just asuggestion of a rising inflection, the Querant will usually respond with some word of assent ordenial. Ask as few questions as you can, but watch carefully the expression of the Querant's face,especially his eyes and lips. Divination will lead to the unfoldment of clairvoyance, if youhappen to be gifted in that direction. But successful divination demands that you exercise to thefull your powers of observation, so as to keep yourself on the right track. But be careful that youdo not so completely identify yourself with your Querant that you lose your own detachedattitude toward his problem. It is his problem, not yours, and if you are to help him, you mustnot share his emotional bias, for that is just what usually clouds his judgement, and you cannothelp him if your own judgement is overshadowed by the same cloud."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"42Oracle of TarotSuit of Swords"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"43Lesson 5: The Suit of CoinsTHE cards of this suit correspond to the final letter of IHVH, to the material world of objectiveforms, and to the element Earth. As the things of this lowest of the four Qabalistic worlds havemoney-value, Coins represent that value, as do the Diamonds of ordinary playing-cards. In theesoteric Tarot this suit is named Pentacles, from the circular wax or metal plate, engraved withthe sigils and names used in an operation of ceremonial magic. In the Knapp Tarot each card ofthe Coins suit bears a cube, the Pythagorean symbol of the material world.Ace of CoinsOn the face of the small cube is a double vesica pisces, which also resembles the mathematicalsymbol of infinity and rhythmic whirling motion, the horizontal figure 8. This refers to theQabalistic idea that physical form is the result of a series of whirling motions originating in thePrimal Will—an idea practically the same as that to which modern physicists have been led bytheir investigations into the constitution of matter. The connection of the Ace of Coins with theHebrew ideas relating to the Divine Number 1 is shown by the crown over the upper point ofthe pentagram, or five-pointed star. Behind the pentagram is a glory composed of forty rays,suggesting the operation of the ten Divine Numbers in the four Qabalistic worlds; andintimating also that the solidest physical forms are manifestations of the whirling motion ofradiant energy. Of this motion the pentagram itself is another symbol, and its employment invarious magical operations is based upon mathematical formulas directly connected with thefigure itself, which formulas lead to mental control of the currents of the Astral Light.Time periodFrom the beginning of the sign Capricorn to the end of Pisces, from December 22nd to March20th.Occult titleThe root of the powers of earth..MeaningsThe power of will as expressed on the physical plane.

Readers of these pages who are familiarwith astrology will at once see the connection between these astrological attributions and thedivinatory meanings of the major trumps.It should, perhaps, be said that although Uranus, Neptune and Pluto were unknown to ancientastronomy within the historical period, there is evidence that these planets were known inprehistoric times. The Tarot Keys which correspond to them are plainly symbolicrepresentations of the particular planets to which they correspond. Furthermore, Uranus ispredominantly a planet of the airy quality, and AIR is the element attributed to Aleph, first of thethree mother letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Neptune, which corresponds to the letter Mem, towhich the element of Water is assigned in the Book of Formation, is predominantly watery inits astrological significance. Pluto, the most recently discovered planed in our system, is littleunderstood astrologically, but as time goes on, it seems probable that its influence will be foundto be closely analogous to that of the fiery element depicted in Tarot by Key 20, The Judgement,the true correspondence to the letter Shin."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"54Oracle of TarotMajor Trumps0, The FoolThe design for this Key is perhaps the least happy in its symbolism of all the cards in the KnappTarot. In the old eighteenth century exoteric packs the Fool was not blindfolded, nor was hethe altogether idiotic figure shown in the Tarot which was drawn by Oswald Wirth in 1880. Theoldest name for this Key was Le MAT, and this word MAT is the clue to the whole mystery of thecard. For MAT is the transposition of the Hebrew word AMT, or Ameth, signifying truth. Thecrocodile in this picture was a suggestion of Eliphas Levi, and it does not appear in any exotericTarot prior to his time. It is, however, fairly good symbolism, because the crocodile is theEgyptian god regarded as the Vehicle of Horus, and as Horus himself. Thus the Fool, about tofall into the mouth of the crocodile, is a symbol of the power which is to be incarnate as Horus,and that power is the pure spirit of Truth or the sky-power, for which the Greek name isOURANOS, or Heaven. Thus, when the New Testament speaks of the “kingdom of heaven” thesame word “Ouranos” is used, and this is the original of our English Uranus. Curiously, indrawing this design, Mr. Knapp has (unintentionally, he tells me) introduced a very obviousUranian symbol. The notched ornaments of the Fool’s dress are so disposed that they bear aclose resemblance to the familiar symbol of the sign Aquarius, ruled by Uranus. This is anexample of the way in which the Tarot designs have been, so to say, protected through all theirvariations. For when an artist sits down with the intention of drawing a Tarot Key forces playupon him of which he may have no conscious knowledge.MeaningsMuch depends upon the position of this Key in relation to others in the layout.In spiritual mattersOriginality, audacity, a tendency to iconoclasm, venturesome quest of higher truth. Uranusupsets fixed conceptions. He disturbs habits, breaks up customary modes of expression, forcesreadjustments. Thus, whenever the Zero card appears in a Tarot layout it signifies suddenreadjustment, and often indicates the unexpected onset of chaotic conditions. In spiritualmatters this is all to the good.In material mattersFolly, eccentricity, sudden action without sufficient consideration or forethought, stupidity, oreven insanity."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"551, Le Bateleur“Bateleur” means “juggler,” or prestidigitator.” Thus the name given to this trump in theexoteric Tarot refers to the lower aspects of Mercury. Here is a symbol of manual dexterity, likethat suggested by the rulership of Mercury in Gemini. The mountebank who surprises yokels byhis sleight-of hand, the trickster in the commercial world, the subtle deceiver—these are thelower meanings of the card. That Manly Hall accepts the attribution of this Key to Mercury issufficiently clear from his having had the caduceus, or wand of Mercury, put in the Juggler’s lefthand. The sceptre, cup, sword and coins on the table are the emblems of the Tarot suits, thethings which the Juggler plays with. And if we remember that the minor trumps of the Tarot areall related to definite time-periods, we shall understand something of importance here. ForMercury is also the personification of the self-conscious mind. He is the Thoth of the Egyptians,and in Egyptian symbolism he was sometimes represented as a dog. Thus the Juggler is the dogwho bites the Fool’s leg in the preceding Key. He feeds on the movement, or motive power ofthe Spirit, on the motion principle of the sky. The secret of his magic power is that he can makesuitable combinations of time elements.Well-dignifiedSkill, adaptation, constructive power, initiative, subtlety.Ill-dignifiedCraft, the power of sense-illusion, lying, deception, cunning.2, La PapesseThe keys in the Knapp version repeat Oswald Wirth’s variation from the older symbolism. Theydo not belong properly to this card. The lunar crescent surmounting her crown identifies LaPapesse as the Tarot symbol of the Moon. The symbol of Mercury on her breast suggests thatshe reflects the power of the preceding Key, just as the subconscious mind, whose principalpower is memory, is responsive and reflective in all its activities, which are controlled from theMercurial, or self-conscious, level.MeaningsThe divinatory meanings are the same as those of the Moon in astrology: Fluctuation, reaction,change, alternation, increase and decrease, instability, secrets, things hidden, the unrevealedfuture, Whether these meanings are good or evil depends altogether upon the dignity of thecard in the divinatory layout."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"56Oracle of TarotMajor Trumps3, L’ImperatriceEven Papus, who was led astray by the mistaken attribution of the major trumps to the Hebrewalphabet, perceived that L’Imperatrice is a symbol of Venus.Well-dignifiedThe divinatory meanings of the card all correspond to the astrological significance of that lovelyplanet. They include: Fruitfulness, Beauty, luxury, pleasure, success and happiness.Ill-dignifiedBut if the card is very badly placed in the layout it is like the afflicted Venus in astrology, andthen signifies Dissipation, lust, waste of time and substance in pleasure, laziness and sensuality.4, L’EmpereurThis card, corresponding to the letter Heh, first of the 12 simple letters, is related to the Martiansign, Aries. As Mars represents the basic force in Aries, we can see why the card correspondingto this sign bears a title which implies that its central figure is the consort of L’Imperatrice. Forin mythology and in astrology, Venus and Mars are closely related, even as imagination (Venus)and action (Mars), act and react upon each other. Furthermore, in the astrological signs, Aries,the home of Mars, directly follows Pisces, the sign in which Venus is exalted.Well-dignifiedMental energy; foresight, supervision, oversight, control; reason, persistence, determination;ambition, leadership, enthusiasm.Ill-dignifiedStrife, anger, tendency to go to extremes; over-active; lack of discretion."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"575, Le PapeThis card corresponds to the letter Vau, and to the sign Taurus, the attribution being that givenin the Book of Formation. In this connection it may {be} of interest to note that the name ofthe first Pope was Simon, or Simeon, which in Hebrew means “hearing.” Hearing is alsoattributed to the letter Vau in Qabalah, and Taurus, according to astrology, rules the neck,throat and ears, so that this sign is directly connected with those parts of the human bodywhich establish communication by means of speech. “LE PAPE” means literally “The Father,”and in the technical language of the Qabalah the name “Father” is particularly associated withthe idea of Wisdom.MeaningsThus the divinatory meanings of this Key correspond to these fundamental notions: DivineWisdom; intuition; explanation, teaching. It is also a symbol of occult force voluntarily invoked.Of this the symbol of the pentagram is a reminder.6, L’AmoureuxThis card represents the letter Zain, and the Mercurial sign Gemini. In accordance with an oldmisunderstanding the picture in the Knapp design shows an initiate hesitating at the parting ofthe ways, with Vice on his left hand and Virtue on his right. None of the ancient Tarot cards, noteven the exoteric versions, justify this interpretation, and the consequent change of symbolism.In some old Tarots this card is called Marriage, and such is one of its meanings, although thedeeper significance is that of the sign Gemini, namely, polarity.MeaningsAttraction, beauty, love, sympathy. Balance of forces, and reciprocal activity. Particularly,agreement in things of the mind, symbolized by the six-pointed star, or hexagram. It is a card ofharmony between the inner and outer life.7, Le ChariotThis Key stands for the letter Cheth and the sign Cancer. In astrology, Cancer is connected withthe fourth house, and so with home, and with the conclusion of a matter in a horary reading.The picture shows a victorious chieftain, resting. The sphinxes, however, in the divinatoryaspect of this card, may be understood to indicate some secret relating to the Querant. Ingeneral the divinatory aspect of this card, may be understood to indicate some secret relating tothe Querant.MeaningsTriumph, victory, the successful outcome of a matter.

Le PenduThe letter corresponding to this card is Mem, to which are attributed the element of Water andthe planet Neptune.MeaningsIn divination, much depends on the nature of the question whenever this card appears in alayout. If the question is concerned with spiritual matters, the Hanged Man represents wisdom,but a wisdom that is just the reverse of what the world commonly accepts. The card also standsfor surrender to the inevitable, but in spiritual things this is surrender to the spiritualperception of universal laws, while in material affairs it is involuntary submission to the force ofcircumstances. In ordinary material affairs Key 12 is a symbol of reverses and losses, of sufferingand sacrifice. But much depends upon its position in a layout, and upon whether or not it iswell or ill-dignified.13, La MortCorresponds, through the letter Nun, to the zodiacal sign Scorpio.

In all but the highest spiritual questions,where the Querant is definitely and consciously on the occult path, this card is of evilsignificance. In its most general meanings, it signifies Mammon, and thus big business, theconventions of society, the injustice and cruelty of a social order in which money takes theplace of God, in which humanity is bestialized, in which war is engineered by greedmasquerading as patriotism, in which fear is dominant. Students of astrology will have nodifficulty in seeing how this corresponds to Capricorn, the sign of big business, and the sign ofworldly fame. Not that Capricorn is evil, but that its lower and negative expression is what hasjust been mentioned.MeaningsBondage, materiality, force (especially the force of convention and public opinion), fate,necessity.16, Le Feu du CielCorresponds, through the letter Peh, to Mars. The symbolism, which has, for a long time, beenconnected with the story of the Tower of Babel, has a direct bearing upon the divinatorymeanings.MeaningsThese meanings correspond also to the influence of Mars in astrology. As a rule an evil card,although in spiritual matters it may be understood as symbolizing the overthrow of mistakenconceptions, or the defeat of activities opposed to the Querant's spiritual development.

In the methodof divination you have been practicing up to this point, the zodiacal keys often indicate the timewhen some event occurs. Whether in the past or in the future depends, of course, on which ofthe three heaps of cards the Key is located in. Practice is the only thing that will enable you tojudge these cards well, but the better you understand their symbols and particularly thefundamental meaning of the planets and signs of the zodiac, the easier will it be to divine.In the next lesson we shall begin explaining a more definite system of divination, which shouldalways be resorted to for the solution of really important questions. In the meantime, continueyour practice with the method already explained. When you apply this to the discovery of the"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"63general trend of a day’s events, ignore the time-values of the cards representing the signs anddecans of the zodiac, and consider only the general significance of those cards.Remember, too, that the pile of cards containing the significator is the only one to be read. Inthe “morning, afternoon, evening” method, the location of the significator shows which part ofthe day will be most important for the Querant, but after this is determined, the cards of thepile containing the Significator are to be shuffled, cut once, and then dealt into three heaps,from right to left, of which the first, or right-hand heap is “evening.”The same principle is to be adhered to when the three original piles are called “past, presentand future,” but in this case the time-values of the cards should be considered."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"64Oracle of TarotMajor Trumps"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"65Lesson 7: Further Stages of DivinationTHIS lesson begins the explanation of the method of Tarot divination to be used for the moreserious problems. The simpler method already explained is to be employed for practice, and forthose occasions in which the use of the cards for their higher purposes seems inadvisable,especially those occasions where there are persons present who are more or less sceptical.Remember that the first and most essential point in a real divination is the Querant's earnestdesire for help. The second point is that the Querant should clearly formulate his question tohimself. The third is that the diviner should mentally invoke the aid of his Higher Self inbeginning to divine. No matter what the attitude of the persons present at a divination may be,the diviner himself should always be in earnest. This does not mean that he should put on aheavy, solemn demeanor. In divination, as in everything else connected with the occult arts, thelight touch should always be sought, because the light touch is the sure touch. Yet the intentionof the diviner must always to help and enlighten those who come to him. To the degree that hethinks of himself as the instrument of a power higher than his limited personality, to thatdegree will he be of real service.Second Stage of Tarot DivinationWhen the Significator has been found in one of the four piles of cards, as before explained, ifthe divination is radical, the diviner proceeds as follows:1.Arrange the cards of the pile containing the Significator in a circle or wheel on the table. Placethe Significator at the top of the wheel, but be careful not to alter the sequence of the cards.2.Count around the wheel, beginning with the Significator, as explained below. Count alwaysfrom right to left, or counter-clockwise, unless the picture of the Significator faces to the right,as, for example, the King and Queen of Cups, or the Warrior of Swords. When the picture of theSignificator faces to the right, and only then, count from left to right, or clock-wise.The counting should always include the card from which you start. Thus, if the Significator be aServant (S), you count 7, and if the card the count ends with be the 9 or Wands, the next countwill be 9, and will commence with the 9 of Wands.For Kings, Queens and Warriors count 4. for Servants or pages, count 7. For Aces count 11. Forsmall cards of minor trumps count the number printed on the card.The counting for major trumps is as follows: For Keys 0, 12 and 20 count 3; for Keys 1, 2, 3, 10,16, 19 and 21 count 9; for Keys 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, and 18 count 12."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"66Oracle of TarotFurther Stages of DivinationIt is permissible to mark the number to be counted on the cards. On the major trumps this maybe conveniently placed just below the number of the card. On the minor trumps it may beplaced below the index in the upper left-hand corner.3.As you count, make a story from the meanings of the cards. At first this may be little more thanslight elaboration of the meaning of each card, as you come to it in the counting. If you practicefaithfully and regularly, it will not be long before you find yourself, as you come to a card,impelled to say something which is by no means restricted to its bare meaning. The main thingis to watch that you do not say anything which runs counter to the basic meaning of the cardunder consideration.4.Sooner or later this counting will bring you to a card you have touched before. This card isinvariably the most important card at this stage of the operation. Suppose, for example, thatyour first layout was as follows: Queen of Swords (Significator) 8 of Swords Warrior of Wands 21. Lee Monde 7 of Coins 8. La Justice Warrior of Coins 11. La ForceBegin to count with the Significator, here the Queen of Swords. Count 4 to the left, ending thecount at Key 8, La Justice. Continue the count in the same direction, counting 12, and ending atthe 7 of Coins. The third count begins with the 7 of Coins and ends with Key 11, La Force. Thefourth count begins with Key 11, from which you count 12, and ending with the Warrior ofWands. The fifth count begins with the Warrior of Wands, counting 4, and ends with Key 21, LeMonde. Beginning with Key 21 and counting 9 brings you back to Key 21 and ends thecounting. Thus, in this layout, Key 21 is the most important card.N.B.In counting around the wheel, always keep going in the direction you started. Thus, in theexample above, you would not reverse the direction of the count on coming to Key 8, althoughthe woman printed on that Key seems, in this position in the layout, to be facing opposite tothe direction of the count."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"675.Pair the cards on either side of the Significator, then those outside them, and so on. This willenable you to continue your story, filling in details omitted as you went round the circle. In theexample above the first pair would be the Warrior of Wands and the 8 of Swords; the secondpair would be the 7 of Coins and Le Monde; the third pair would be the Warrior of Coins and LaJustice. This would leave Key 11, La Force at the bottom of the wheel, to be paired with theSignificator at the top. In reading these pairs, no matter which way the Significator faces, norwhich way the counting has run, the card on the right of the diviner is invariably related to thepast, and that on the left to the future.When the pairs come out even, so that there is no single card at the bottom of the wheel,opposite the Significator, the solution of the Querant's problem depends largely on theinteraction of forces surrounding him, and not so much upon his own will, thought or action.But when a single card is left over, as above, this Key represents a force, condition, or personapparently opposed to the Significator, but really standing as the basis of his action, or the rawmaterial for his work.At this stage of the divination the two stories may not be quite accurate. One reason for this isthat the Querant does not, as a rule, know everything about the matter. But the main outlinesshould be such as the Querant can recognize. If not, abandon the divination at this point, andwait for another occasion. If the two stories develop enough of the question to warrantcontinuing, proceed withThird Stage of Tarot Divination1.The diviner shuffles, and the Querant cuts the cards once, as before.2.The diviner deals all the cards, face down, into 12 packs, thus: 1 2 3 4 5 6 12 11 10 9 8 7These 12 packs correspond to the 12 astrological houses of heaven."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"68Oracle of TarotFurther Stages of Divination3.Turn up the packs, one by one, until you find that one which contains the Significator. Judgethe general nature of the further development of the question by the nature of the house inwhich the Significator appears. Thus, if the Significator falls in the First House (pack 1), thefurther development of the matter will depend largely upon the Querant himself, upon his owninitiative, or upon his own action. But if the Significator should fall in the Tenth House, thefurther development of the Question would be concerned with the Querant's profession, withmatters making for or against his promotion, or the attainment of some degree of influence orfame. If other indications pointed that way, and the Significator were in the 10th house, thefurther development of the question might be concerned with the Querant's father, or withsome man of prominence and authority whose influence might work for the Querant, or againsthim, according to the indications of the layout.The Dignities of the cards are very important in this third stage of the divination. No attention ispaid to the “accidental dignity” indicated hitherto by the card’s being rightside-up or upside-down. The dignities are all based upon the astrological significance of the cards. Studentsfamiliar with astrology will understand at once why Key 19, corresponding to the Sun, is Well-dignified in the First House and Ill-dignified in the Seventh House. They will see, too, that Key4, L’Empereur, which represents Aries, is naturally Well-dignified in the First House, but Ill-dignified in the Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth Houses, which are in adverse aspect to the FirstHouse in a “natural chart.” Those who know nothing of astrology will not so easily understandthe why of these dignities, but they will, if they practice, soon come to recognize the accuracy ofwhat is given below.Meanings of the HousesThe meanings of the 12 houses, and the powers of the cards therein are:First HouseThe Querant himself; his life, personality, disposition, personal outlook; his own initiative andaction.Well-dignified in the first houseIll-dignified in the first houseMajor trumps 1, 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 14, 16(especially in spiritual questions), 17,19, 20.

The cards should bedealt face-down, as in the preceding stage of the divinatory.3.Turn up the packs, until you find the Significator, beginning with pack 1, or Aries. The time-period represented by that pack, and the general meaning of the sign of the zodiac itrepresents, will be of greatest importance in relation to the question.Determining the Time PeriodSuppose, for example, the Significator is found in the third pack. This corresponds to the thirdsign, Gemini, and thus to the time-period between May 21st and June 20th. Whether it refers topast or future depends wholly upon the time of year in which the divination is made. The rulefor this is as follows:At the fourth stage of divination, if the pack containing the significator representsthe same time-period as that in which the divination is made, it is regarded asrelating to the present. If it represents a time-period not more than three monthsprior to the time of the divination, it relates to the past. Otherwise it relates to thefuture. [This paragraph is in all caps in the original.]An ExampleWe will suppose, for the sake of illustration, that the cards in this Gemini pack are Queen ofSwords (Significator); 3. L’Imperatrice; 4 of Coins; 15. Le Diable; 5 of Swords; 7 of Cups; 11. LaForce.The Significator herself is Well-dignified in Gemini, because she represents a person of the airytriplicity (and has been chosen on that account). Key 3, L’Imperatrice is fortunate, for itrepresents the influence of Venus, the Lesser Fortune, and Venus in Gemini suggests pleasureand profit from travel, writings, and all other Mercurial pursuits. The 4 of Coins is not Ill-dignified in this layout, for there is no real conflict of forces between its time-period and that ofGemini. But the next card 15. Le Diable, is unfortunate in anything but purely materialquestions. On the other hand, the better meanings of the 5 of Swords suit are Well-dignified inairy signs. The 7 of Cups has merely its ordinary power in this layout, yet this is strengthened bythe card that follows it, for Key 11 is strong in all airy signs but Aquarius."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"74Oracle of TarotFourth Stage of DivinationIn reading the layout, the same method of counting is used as before. Thus, in the examplegiven, the first count is 4, from the Queen of Swords to the 15th major trump. This indicatesrestriction, obstacles and difficulties for the Querant, connected either with travel or withMercurial pursuits. Possibly great difficulty in arriving at a decision between two possiblecourses of conduct. The next count of 12, beginning with the 15th Key, brings us back to theSignificator. Thus the clear indication is that the obstacle is mental, and that it is within theQuerant's own mental life that the solution must be sought.Pairing the CardsNow, pairing the cards, as in the preceding stages of the operation, we have Key 11, La Force,indicating that in the time prior to the divinatory the Querant has power sufficient to overcomeher difficulties, and imagination and inventiveness sufficient to apply that power so as toprocure excellent results.The next pair is of 7 of Cups and 4 of Coins. The former probably means that the Querant,though fairly successful in the past, has lacked definiteness and decision in making her plans;or, that she has not followed up her successes vigorously enough, so that she had lessadvantage from what she gained in the past than she might have had, but for some indecision ofindolence. The 4 of Coins, paired with the 7 of Cups, and in the position referring to the future,indicates the need of wisely managing all material resources. It indicates activity in moneymatters, and suggests the need of tact.The third, and last pair in this group is the 5 of Swords and Key 15. The 5 of Swords is well-dignified in Gemini, hence, although it means trouble, it is here a symbol of power gained fromtrouble, and this power will enable the Querant to meet her problem and work it outsuccessfully.An Important NoteIn this operation, and in the one that precedes it, the first six piles of cards, corresponding tothe houses from 1 to 6, or to the signs from Aries to Virgo, will always contain 7 cards, becausethere are only 78 cards in the Tarot pack. And the last six packs will contain only 6 cards. Hence,if the Significator falls in any of the first six packs, the pairing will be as follows:SIGNIFICATORFuture(Mind)PastFuture(Desires)PastFuture(Conditions)Past"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"75But if the Significator is in any of the last six packs the pairing will be as follows:SIGNIFICATORFuture(Mind)PastFuture(Desires)PastSynthesis(Conditions)—That is to say, in reading Houses or Signs, when you come to pair the cards, the first pair alwaysrelates to the Querant's mental states; the second pair is more concerned with the Querant'sdesires, feelings, or emotions. The third pair (if there be 7 cards in the layout) relates to theexternal conditions. If there be only 6 cards in the layout, the single card which pairs with theSignificator is the synthesis of past and future conditions, and will usually be found to relatemore particularly to the present, so far as time is concerned, although it must be rememberedthat the present sums up to the past, and affects the conditions of the future, so that a singlecard in this position looks, so to say, both ways.The Time ElementThis is the most difficult to judge, and only experienced diviners are likely to be accurate in it.But even experienced diviners were not always experienced, hence the student should alwaysattempt to judge time, and then carefully check the success or failure of his attempts. There are,however, certain principles to be considered and acted upon.1.In questions of a very ephemeral nature, such as relate to the affairs of what is practically thepresent or the immediate future, the pack in which the Significator falls may be understood torepresent the time-period in which the Moon will be passing through the sign represented bythat pack. Thus, in the example given, the pack corresponds to Gemini, and if the divinationwere made on January 3rd, 1934, the time might be read as having to do with the next passageof the Moon through Gemini. Reference to an ephemeris for 1934 will show that on January 3rdof that year the next passage of the Moon through Gemini will occur on the 25th and 26th daysof the same month.2.In questions where the operation of the forces is likely to be slower, the Sun’s position in thesign is to be taken as indicating the time-period, subject to the rule given in “Determining theTime Period,” above."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"76Oracle of TarotFourth Stage of Divination3.In a divination which concerns only the affairs of a single day, the sign occupied by theSignificator in this fourth operation refers to the period of the day during which that signascends over the Eastern horizon. Roughly speaking, the sign ascending at sunrise is the sameas that in which the Sun is placed, and every two hours thereafter a new sign ascends, in theregular order of the zodiac. Hence, if the divination we are considering had been limited to theaffairs of January 3rd, 1934, when the Sun is in Capricorn this fourth stage of the operation,relating to the sign Gemini, would be concerned with the approximate time-period between thetenth & twelfth hour after sunrise on that day. This is only a rough calculation, and studentswho are desirous of developing accuracy in this respect should learn the comparatively simpleastrological method for determining the time of day when a sign is on the ascendant at theplace where the divination is performed.4.The time-value of the card which represents the future condition in the fourth stage of thedivinatory operation is also important. In the example we were using, this card is Key 15. LeDiable. And if the divination were performed on January 3rd, 1934, this Key, which representsCapricorn, would relate to present time, so far at the Sun’s position is concerned, or to that partof the immediate future corresponding to the period between the 3rd of January, when thedivination is made, and the 21st of January, when the Sun leaves Capricorn and enters Aquarius.When the time-value of this final card of the fourth stage of the divination corresponds to aperiod of the year which is past at the time the divination is performed, the card usually relatesto the next period in which the Moon passes through the sign corresponding to the card. Thusif this same example occurred in a divination made in the latter part of February, 1934, say onthe 23rd of that month, Le Diable would probably refer to the time-period corresponding to the9th, 10th and 11th of March, since the Moon will be passing through Capricorn on those days.5.When the final card of this fourth operation is a planetary card, and therefore has no definitetime-value, its operation is to be judged as follows:1.In very ephemeral questions it represents the time of day when the first sign ruled bythat planet is rising. Thus if the divination were made on the 3rd of January, and Key 3,L’Imperatrice were in this final position in the layout, the condition it represented wouldrefer to the time of day when Taurus, the first Venusian sign after Capricorn, was in theAscendant for that day.2.In questions whose solution is expected in the near future, the same Key, on January 3rd,1934, would refer to the time in which the Moon was passing through Taurus, or, in thisinstance, to the period between the 22nd and 23rd of January, 1934."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"773.In questions whose solution may take longer than those included in the precedingparagraph, the time-period relates to the time when the Sun is in the next sign ruled bythe planet in question. Thus, if the divination were made when the Sun was in Capricorn,and L’Imperatrice were the final card, it would refer to the time-period when the Sunentered and passed through Taurus, or the period from April 20th to May 20th of thatyear.6.When the final card is an Ace or a Page, the time-period refers in very ephemeral questions tothe time of day during which the three signs controlled by that card are ascending; in lessephemeral questions to the period during which the Moon is passing through those threesigns; in questions where the solution will take considerable time, to the period when the Sunis passing through those three signs.7.The same principle applies when the final card is one of the other court-cards (King, Queen orWarrior). In ephemeral questions the time-period is that part of the next day when the signsrepresented by the card are ascending; in questions having to do with the immediate future thetime-period is that of the next passage of the Moon through the signs; in questions concernedwith the more remote future, the time-period is to be judged by the next passage of the Sunthrough the signs.The only book required for determining these time-periods is an ephemeris for the currentyear. The daily paper usually gives the time of sunrise, and this is accurate enough to judge thetime-period of ascending signs for divination."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"78Oracle of TarotFourth Stage of Divination"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"79Lesson 9: Fifth Stage of Divination1.Shuffle the entire pack, and let the Querant cut once, as before.2.Turn the cards face up in your left hand, and run through the pack, without disturbing theorder of any of the cards, until you come to the card you have selected as Significator. Put allthe cards preceding this one, as you have run through the cards, at the back of the pack,without disturbing their order. That is, cut the pack at the Significator, so that this will be thetop card when the pack is turned face up.3.Place this card on the table.4.Deal the next thirty-six cards in a ring around him, beginning at the usual position of the signAries, or of the First House, in a zodiacal wheel. The first three cards dealt will represent thethree decanates of Aries; the next three the three decanates of Taurus, and so on through thetwelve signs.5.Judge each card as it is placed on the table, according to its agreement or disagreement withthe position in which it falls. Key 4, L'Empereur, for example, would be Well-dignified anywherein the first group of three cards. So would any card of the Wands suit, and any card of theSwords suit except those representing the three decanates of Libra; those representing thethree decanates of Cancer, and those representing the three decanates of Capricorn (in theCups and Coins suits respectively) would also be Ill-dignified in Aries. In general the strength orweakness of any card will be practically the same as those given on pages 27, 28 and 29.6.After the cards have been judged and read as above, count (beginning with the first point inAries, or the first card following the Significator) and pair as in preceding stages of thedivination. Note carefully in which division of the zodiac the final card appears.N.B.The pairing, in this stage, is across the wheel, that is card 1 with card 19, card 2 with card 20,card 3 with card 21, and so on. The final card referred to above is not card 36 (or the onecorresponding to the last decanate of the twelfth sign, Pisces). It is the card to which thecounting returns, that is, the card which shows up a second time as the result of counting, andso brings the counting to an end."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"80Oracle of TarotFifth Stage of Divination7.As in the preceding stage of divination, judge the time represented by this final card as relatingto the corresponding ascending sign in a question that refers to the day following thedivination. If the question is one that has to do with a problem in which a solution is desiredwithin a comparatively short time, look in the current ephemeris for the next passage of theMoon through the decanate of the sign in which the final card falls. Otherwise consider the finalcard as applying to an event or condition which will become manifest when next the Sun passesthrough the decanate of the sign in which the final card is placed.Further As To Dignities Of The CardsThese remarks apply particularly to this layout of 36 cards, although they have some bearing onall stages of the operation.1.In considering the strength or weakness of any card, consider what cards are next it on eitherside. Cards of the same suit strengthen it for good or evil, according to their nature. Similarly,major trumps on either side of a minor trump strengthen or weaken the latter, according totheir nature. But minor trumps have less effect on major trumps. Wands are friendly withSwords and Pentacles.Wands are inimical to Cups. Cups are friendly with Swords and Coins. Swords are friendly withCups and Wands. Swords are inimical to Coins.2.When a card falls between two others which are of contrary nature, or inimical to each other, itis not much affected by either. For example, if the Ace of Wands should fall between Key 7, theChariot and Key 8, La Justice, it would not be very much affected. Neither would it be greatlyaffected if there were a card of the Sword suit on one side, and a card of the Coins suit on theother.3.A greater number of one suit or the other in this fifth stage of the operation has a particularrelevance:"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"81A majorityof this suitor card......shows this.Wandsthere will be much mental energy expended in the matter.

In studying them,begin always with the keywords as given in the lesson on the four suits and the twenty-twomajor trumps. It is absolutely impossible to divine at all satisfactorily until the significance of theentire pack is thoroughly learned.Spend at least half-an-hour every day with the Tarot. Shuffle the cards, cut them at random, andrun through the whole pack. Lay out the cards in rows on the table, and practice makingsentences from the various sequences.

To this end, there is no better low-priced bookthan The Student’s Chart Reader, published by Llewellyn George at 8921 National Boulevard(Palms), Los Angeles, Cal. The price of this little book in paper is only $1.00, or $1.50 in cloth. Itcan be had from us, or direct from the publisher.Its use in connection with the stage of the Tarot divination just explained is as follows:Suppose that in the first section of the wheel containing 36 cards there were Key 14,Temperance, the King of Swords, and the Servant of Wands. The position of the first of thesewould specifically relate it to the first ten degrees of Aries, which have a Martian quality; and thequality of Key 14 itself is that of its ruler, Jupiter. Thus the first card would be the same as theastrological influence of Jupiter in the first decanate of Aries. This is explained on page 43 of thebook just mentioned.The second card in the series would represent, in the main, the influence of the sign Libra, andthus the active force of Venus. Venus in Aries is explained on page 23 of the little book.The third card is itself a symbol of the whole sign Aries, and of the two signs following. Itsposition in the 3rd decanate of Aries would confirm the suggestion represented by the presenceof Key 14 in the first decanate.The same book also gives the significance of the various planets in the 12 houses, and as everycard of the Tarot represents either a planet itself, a sign of the zodiac ruled by a planet, or adecanate of the zodiac under the sub-ruler-ship of a planet, there is a sense in which every cardrepresents some aspect of planetary force, and may therefore be read as a planetary influence ina given sign or house. So learn the meanings. Then it will be easy to combine them."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"83Lesson 10: Final Stage of Divination1.Shuffle, and let the Querant cut once, as before.2.Deal the entire pack into ten piles of cards, in the form of the Tree of Life, as below:  1 3 2 5 4  6 8 7  9  103.Look for the Significator.

The vertical line is also particularly the symbol of man,standing upright on the earth. Among the meanings of the number are: Beginning, initiative,originality, unity, singleness, isolation, and the like. In Hebrew occultism 1 is called the Crown,to show that it represents the determining, ruling, directive and volitional aspect ofconsciousness; hence the Crown is termed also the Primal Will. The same philosophy alsoterms 1 the Hidden Intelligence, to show that the primary mode of consciousness is concealedbehind all veils of name and form. In Qabalah, again, 1 is the specific number of Jechidah(IChIDH) the Self or I AM, and of that primary activity in the universe whence all other forms ofenergy and force are derived, known as The Beginning of the Whirlings.KeywordsBeginning, Control, Force, Consciousness, and Selfhood."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"85The Number 2Duality, polarity; association, coexistence, partnership; duplication, doubling, repetition,succession, rhythm; likeness, similitude, reflection, reproduction; receptivity, secondariness,dependence, connection; alternation, reciprocation; mutuality, interconnection,interdependence; periodicity, pulsation, vibration; round, revolution, rotation—are somefundamental meanings of the number 2. In the Hebrew Wisdom this number is called, in thecosmic sense, Masloth, “the highway of the stars,” that is, the Sphere of the Zodiac, or Sphere ofthe Fixed Stars. The idea here is that the number 2 represents the reflection of the invisible Life-Energy of the number 1 in the regular rhythmic movement of the heavenly bodies. Note, too,that the root-meaning of Zodiac is “Living.” The idea here is that the manifest movements wesee in the heavens are the duplication or reflection of the invisible activities of the Primal Will.This is important, for it indicates that behind the whirling motion of the heavenly bodies,behind the succession of their positions and aspects, is something higher. The Sphere of theZodiac is secondary, not primary. With the number 2, again, the Hebrew Wisdom associates thenotion of Wisdom, which is regarded as the reflection of the Self. Wisdom is the perfect self-recognition of the I AM, the mirror in which the Self is reflected to itself. Wisdom is revealed tous by the celestial order, and the true astrology which gives us the meaning of that order is thebasis of all human wisdom. Hence 2 is known also as the Illuminating (literally Shining)Intelligence. The Hebrew original also carries the significance of mental enlightenment orinstruction, and reminds us that 2 has always been called the number of Science. Furthermore,this original Hebrew word refers to the idea of admonishing or warning. All this ties up with theconnection between 2 and the Zodiac. The stars do literally enlighten us, for they are suns, thesource of all our light. The rhythmic order of their motion is the manifestation of the HiddenOrder and power of the original Whirling Motion signified by 1. From the study of that orderwe gain wisdom to direct our lives. Finally, the energy which streams from the heavenly bodies(including that heavenly body, the Earth, which is our own abode) is the vital force of our ownorganisms, hence we find that the Qabalah designates the number 2 as the specific symbol ofthe Life-Force in man and in all creatures; and this force, of course, is that which is most highlyconcentrated in the power of continuing the species, characteristic of all living things, so thatthis idea ties up directly with the abstract meaning of 2 as relating to reproduction.KeywordsWisdom, Universal order, Reflection, Vitality."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"86 Oracle of TarotFinal Stage of DivinationThe Number 3The number 1 represents, geometrically, the Point which is the beginning of all manifestation.The number 2 represents the line, or extension of the activity of the Point. The number 3 isrelated to the Surface, or plane in which the motion of the Line generated from the initialactivity of the Point becomes manifest. Again, 3 is the sum of 1 and 2, and therefore combinestheir meanings. As 2 is duplication, reproduction and manifestation, while 1 is original force,initiative and will, it becomes evident that 3 must stand for the actual outworking of theprinciples reflected from 1 by 2. In Hebrew philosophy 3 is Understanding, which is regarded aslooking forward into the field of manifestation, in contrast to Wisdom (2), which is regarded aslooking back toward the self-knowledge of the original I AM (1). Understanding (3) is theconcrete application of abstract Wisdom (2). Note that adjective “concrete.” It represents thedefinite and specific in contradistinction to the vague, indefinite and general. That is concretewhich has specific outlines, qualities, or properties. It is particular. It is itself, and not somethingelse. Behind all these ideas is the thought of specific Limitation, the notion of outline, form,boundary and so on. And this idea of limitation, coherence, aggregation, consolidation, etc. isjust exactly what is meant in astrology by the power designated as Saturn, the power ofcondensation, limitation and restriction. Thus we see why the number 3, in Qabalah, is calledthe Sphere of Saturn. (But here we need to remember that the “sphere” of any power or forceis not that force itself. 3 is not the number of the planet Saturn, but the number of the field inwhich Saturn operates). In English, by derivation, Understanding and Substance are literalequivalents, and they have the same meaning in Hebrew. Thus 3 is the symbol of the actualMaterial or Substance out of which all forms are constructed, and is therefore called AIMA theMother in the Qabalah. In all esoteric systems we find more or less clearly expressed the ideathat original Substance is eternally pure, and this thought is connected with the various mythsof a heavenly or earthly Virgin. The root-thought is that the fundamental Substance or Seed-Ground of manifestation (which the thought-habits of all mankind force us to think of asfeminine) is something consecrated and holy, something pure and inviolable. Thus the idea ofSanctifying Intelligence is connected with the number 3 in the Hebrew Wisdom, to convey theidea that through growth or expression (symbolized by 3) is brought about the perfectedmanifestation of the potencies latent in the originating power. Perfect expression of thepotencies of life brings about perfected organism, and perfected organism makes possible theexpression of perfected consciousness. All organic growth and development are thereforeconnected with the number 3, and in the larger aspects of life-unfoldment, this number standsfor the perfect evolution of organisms which shall be adequate vehicles of expression for thedivine Life.Furthermore, the occult theory of evolution is that organic change is the consequence ofimpulses originating within the organism. In a certain sense, the occult teaching holds thatwhat brings about the effort which ultimately results in specific alterations of physical structure,is the living creature’s intuitive knowledge that such a change is possible. The intuition may bevery vague and indefinite, hardly more than a blind urge, at the beginning of an evolutionaryprocess; but as the creature who feels this urge responds to it with effort towards realization,"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"87the very changes in the organism which follow that effort make the intuition more and moredefinite. At last the time comes when, as in men and women of real enlightenment, this urgetoward improvement is clearly understood, and definitely referred to the influence of a powerhigher than the mere personality. Hence we can see why the Qabalists refer the number 3 toNeshamah, the spiritual “breathing” or Higher Soul, which they regard as the source ofIntuition.KeywordsSubstance, Development, Growth; Multiplication, Elaboration, Expression; Definition,Limitation, Coherence; Formation, Combination, Mixture, Incorporation, Embodiment.The Number 4Geometrically 4 is the square, composed of equal lines forming rectangles. The use of thesquare in building from ancient times has made this number representative of the employmentof right lines in construction, so that 4 and ORDER are fundamental associations of ourthinking. Even our figure 4 shows a combination of the T-square and triangle, familiarimplements of the architect and builder. As 1 plus 3, 4 conveys the thought of the organicdevelopment of forms (3) expressing the original Life-power (1). As the duplication of 2 itconveys the idea of the reproduction and continuance of Wisdom. Both types of association areconnected with the esoteric meanings of 4. The literal meaning of the Hebrew word Tzedek,(which is associated with 4 because 4 is said to be the Sphere of Jupiter, and the Hebrew namefor Jupiter is Tzedek) is justness, accuracy, correctness. Here it is curious to note that the firstletter of Tzedek (which is spelt TzDK in Hebrew) has the value 90, suggesting the number ofdegrees in a right angle; that the second letter (D) has the value of 4. Hence 4 as the Sphere ofJupiter refers to a field of activity which is the scene of adjustment, right proportion, the correctmeasurement of forces, the true appraisal of materials. Readers of these pages who are familiarwith astrology will see how truly all this fits in with the fundamental meanings of Jupiter. Jupiteris said to be the planet of reason. He signifies judges, bankers, theologians; also science, lawand reason.Well-dignified, he inclines those whom he influences to be generous, truthful, honest, moral,reasonable, sincere and upright. Jupiter, furthermore is ceremonious and inclines to goodmanners, to the correct performance of the ritual of human association. His relation to 4considered as the duplication of 2 is that the development and classification of the materials ofscience is furthered by the scientists’ inspection and consideration of the meaning of theirfinding. In a sense Science feeds upon itself (as the symbol of the serpent biting its own tailintimates). Science gathers facts from the observation of nature, but the advance of science isnot limited to the consideration of these objective facts. Quite as much progress is made whenscientists turn from considering objective things to careful inspection of the classifications andcategories of their various special fields. Thus Neptune and Uranus were discovered by this"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"88 Oracle of TarotFinal Stage of Divinationmeans, and the new discoveries of chemical elements have been hastened since Mendeleefcompiled his tables.All this will prepare you to understand why the Qabalists called 4 the Measuring Intelligence.The original Hebrew adjective conveys the notion of fixation, steadiness, regularity. But it also isrelated to a root meaning to curve, to bend, to be arched, and thus to contain, hence 4 is alsocalled the Receptacular Intelligence or the Receiving Intelligence. Here again there is a hint ofthe doubling of the ideas represented by the number 2. Finally, 4 is called Mercy or Beneficencein the Hebrew Wisdom, and this is clearly enough related to the astrological ideas connectedwith Jupiter, the Greater Fortune. And since 4 represents the duplication of Wisdom, it isassociated with memory in Qabalistic psychology. The Life-power remembers perfectly. Itknows its own potencies, its own resources, and also knows perfectly the needs of every one ofIts centers of expression. It is limitless in power and substance, and cannot be supposed to fail.Hence it must be beneficent. But its “good-givingness” cannot be otherwise than orderly. It isnever wasteful prodigality. All the gifts of God are measured out, even when the measure is full,pressed down, and running over. Every center of expression receives, always exactly what iscoming to itKeywordsOrder, Regularity, Righteousness; Truth, Reason; Co-Ordination, Measurement, Arrangement,Assortment, Allotment, Distribution; Organization, Classification, Systematization, Codification.The Number 5As representing the sum of 1 and 4 it may be taken to represent the consequence of thecodification (4) of the powers of the Primal Will (1); as being the consequence of the reasonedmeasurement (4) of the impulses of the Origination Energy of the universe (1). Suchcodification of the best of human knowledge as to the sources of our power, as to the laws oflife, as to the potencies of our being has, as its consequence, the body of knowledge embracingphilosophy, theology and metaphysics. This body of knowledge is the substance of religion. It isthe aggregate of the self-revelation of Spirit to human consciousness. And it is in this sense thatthe number 5 represents religion, both in its exoteric forms and in its esoteric inner substance.As representing the sum of 2 and 3, the number 5 may be taken to represent the consequenceof the working of Wisdom (2) upon Understanding (3), whereby the multiplying andmanifesting power of Understanding gives definite form to the more abstract principles ofWisdom. Here, too, we have the Life-force (2) working itself out into manifestation throughIntuition (3). Hence, in this connection, 5 may be regarded as peculiarly the number whichrepresents the processes whereby wise knowledge of nature’s hidden laws and forces comes tobe part of human consciousness. Considered as the middle term between 1 (beginning) and 9(completion), the number 5 is a symbol of meditation, adaptation, agency, and the like."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"89In the astrology of the Qabalah, the number 5 is called Madim, the Sphere of Mars, and it hasalso the names Pachad, Fear; Geburah, Strength or Severity; and Deen, Justice. Again let meremind you that 5 is not Mars itself, but the sphere or field of the Mars activity. AstrologicallyMars represents force, strength, courage and activity. Mars rules the muscular system, and asruler of Scorpio, has much to do with the force of reproduction. Now, just as 3 is in a sense themanifestation of 2, or concrete development of 2, so is 5 the manifestation or concretedevelopment of 4. It is the consequence of the abstract order symbolized by 4. It is, so to say,that Order transferred from the sphere of abstract principle to the field of concrete application.It is the Cosmic Order perceived by Reason as that Order actually operates in the field of humanactivity and experience.Primitive man, encountering that order at work in the world around him, does not even dreamthat the events of his daily experience are expressions of order, much less of truth andbeneficence. He fears his environment, and transfers that fear to whatever mysterious beings heimagines to be the causes of what happens around him. Thus, for the primitive mind, thereligious aspect of the number 5 is truly expressed by the word Pachad, Fear.More highly-evolved mentalities see the regularity and order of the universe, and learn, to someextent, that knowledge of the cosmic order puts power in the hands of him who possesses it.Such men see the world around them as a veritable Sphere of Mars, in which the fittest andstrongest survive. Unless there be a touch of spiritual intuition in the consciousness of suchmen, they will never see the universe as other than a power source, ruled by inexorable laws,which may be utilized by the man who knows them, to dominate the rest of humanity, andcontrol the forces of nature. This level of consciousness in relation to the number 5 is expressedby the word Geburah, Strength or Severity.Higher spiritual intuition, however, enables those who possess it to recognize the truth that themanifested Order of the universe cannot conceivably be other than perfect Justice. To suchminds the number 5 becomes the symbol of the high types of adaptation and adjustment bywhich a man brings himself into perfect harmony with the real tendencies and purposes ofuniversal activity.In this connection, note that 5 for Qabalists is the number of “personal will,” representing thatfeeling of tension within the personality which accompanies the making of choices or decisions.All choice and decision, it will be observed, has for its object some particular adaptation of theconditions of the chooser’s environment. (Here we include in environment all the conditionsof the mental and emotional life, the states of which appear to the person observing them asbeing just objective, if apparently less substantial, as are the things and conditions outside hisbody.The particular aspect of intelligence associated with 5 by Qabalists is called the RadicalIntelligence. The original Hebrew means “original, rooted.” It calls up the picture of the greattap-root of a tree, and reminds us that the tap-root is the means or agency whereby the tree"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"90 Oracle of TarotFinal Stage of Divinationadapts the chemical conditions of the soil to its requirements, and the means also, by which itholds itself firm and upright. The root is a source of contact and a source of sustenance, butmost important of all, a source of adaptation and specialization, a source of power and strength.In one of the Hebrew books of occultism, it is said that the Radical Intelligence emanates fromthe depths of the primordial Wisdom. Now, Wisdom is 2, the Sphere of the Zodiac, and the fieldof the cosmic Life-force. Hence here is a hint that 5 is somehow to be regarded as speciallyrelated to the number 2; a suggestion that whatever we find explicitly expressed by 5 we mayalso find implicitly present in 2. I speak of this in order to remind you that in the Major trumpsof Tarot, 2 is the number of La Papesse while 5 is the number of Le Pape. On the practical side,5 represents Applied Science in all its variations, including magic, the ceremonial part ofreligion, but most important of all, the ritualization of daily life. And correct ritualization ofdaily life means, basically, the correct synchronization of personal action with the rhythmicalternation of forces represented by the movement of the planets through the zodiac. The“highways of the stars” telegraph to us the symbolic messages whereby we may know the will ofour Father in Heaven. To decipher the message, and live in accordance with it, is true religion,perfect wisdom, and applied science that links human conduct with the very tap-root of cosmicvitality and order.KeywordsAdaptation, Adjustment, Equilibration; Agreement, Union, Conformity; Discipline, Teaching,Training; Variation, Differentiation, Versatility; Magic, Applied Science, Ritual.The Number 6As 1 plus 5, the number 6 shows the result of the correct ritualization and application of theforces having their origin in the Primal Will. As 2 plus 4, the number 6 becomes therepresentative of those inner states of consciousness having principally to do with thecodification and arrangement (4) of the materials of more or less abstract knowledge andscience (2). As 3 plus 3, the number 6 refers to the fact that as soon as there is newdevelopment and organization (3), the results so achieved themselves become the subjects ormaterial for the evolutionary process. All these ideas, here but dimly suggested, are to be foundexplicitly connected with the number 6 in the age-odd symbolic meanings of that number. Itsmost familiar symbol is the hexagram, or six-pointed star, among plane figures; but the cube, orhexahedron, is its representative among solids.A correct ritualization of the forces originating in the Primal Will (1 plus 5) must needs workitself out in conduct which shall be an accurate and adequate reflection of that Will. Thus thenumber 6 is regarded by Qabalists as representing the reflection of the Universal Self or CosmicI AM by the personalized Self, the Ego which is the center of reference for every human being’sexperience. And the perfected expression of the number 6, at its very highest level, is, on theone hand, perfect obedience to the Law, and on the other, extraordinary control of externalconditions. The truly wise man serves God and masters nature."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"91Thus he becomes an actual mediator between that which is above him and that which is below.This idea is definitely related to 6 in the Qabalah, which calls 6 the intelligence of mediatinginfluence. To mediate is to stand between, and thus to act as a point of division between twoopposite fields of activity. A mediator is an arbitrator between two conflicting parties. Rightmediation is therefore right assessment of the respective claims of the two parties, and gives toeach what belongs to it.It is in this sense that the number 6 has come to be related to the idea of discrimination. Thenumber itself proceeds directly from the number 2, in this wise; We cannot consider 2 withoutimplying the pre-existence of 1. Therefore 2 really includes the ideas of 1 and 2. The sum ofthese is 3. Thus, in occult arithmetic, we say that 3 is the “theosophic extension” of 2. Similarly,3 implies the pre-existence of 2 and 1, so that the theosophic extension of 3 is the sum of 1, 2and 3, or 6. Hence we say that 6 has its roots in 2. This is hinted at also when one considers thehexagram, which is composed of two equilateral triangles, pointing in opposite directions, yetblended with each other. Similarly the cube, by the perfect equality of opposite faces, conveysthe fundamental ideas of the number 6.This number is called Tiphareth, (ThPARTh), Beauty, in the Qabalah, and in the Bible, as in theQabalah, this word is definitely associated with man, which is also one of the traditional names(ADM, Adam) of the number 6. Thus in the 13th verse of the 44th Chapter of Isaiah we read:“The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes,and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according tothe beauty of a man (in the Hebrew Tiphareth Adam); that it may remain in the house.” Thispassage is part of a denunciation of idolatry, and refers to the making of an image, or idol. Thusit is in direct connection with the attribution of imagination to the number 6 in Qabalisticpsychology. But it has a deeper meaning, and that is why I have introduced it here.The number 6 is also called The Sphere of the Sun, and refers to the field of operation of the rayof the cosmic Self reflected into, or terminating as, the personal Ego. There is a certain strictlytrue sense in which that which appears to us to be the central point of our personal being, orthe central “I” which is the hub around which all things in our experience revolve, may beregarded as none other than this end or the territorial terminus of a stream of vibratory energyhaving its other end in the actual physical Sun which is the central body of our solar system.The Sun is not a mere mass of flaming gas. It is the body of the controlling Intelligence of ourworld-system, or perhaps it might be more correct to say that the Sun is the physical organ ofthat controlling Intelligence. The truly discriminating wise man sees himself and his actions asthe terrestrial expressions of impulses and energy originating in the Sun. Such a wise manregards himself, and other human personalities, as being none other than so many differentexamples of solar intelligence and action. And through a vivid realization of this truth, the wisemake themselves true mediators, producing harmony and beauty through their own ritual oflife, and inspiring others to copy that ritual."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"92 Oracle of TarotFinal Stage of DivinationKeywordsBalance, Symmetry, Harmony; Beauty, Harmony Of Opposites; Reciprocity, Polarity, Love.The Number 7Seven is the great sacred number, and to exhaust its occult meanings would require volumes.One most important thing about this number is that it is seldom found in nature.Conventionally, the week has seven days, but the number is only an approximation. Theselection of seven as a number to represent musical tones and colors is purely arbitrary. So isthe sevenfold classification of the principles of man. And since the discovery of Uranus andNeptune, we know that there is no particular connection between the number 7 and thenumber of the planets. Neither is there any mathematical way to construct an exact regularheptagon or seven-sided figure. Such a figure can be constructed, but it must be done by trial-and-error, and demands considerable skill of the draftsman.In the Qabalah 7 is named Netzach, a word which is ordinarily translated Victory, but which hasoften the secondary meaning of Eternity. It is often used as an adjective signifying “perpetual,”or “continual.” It is from this Hebrew name for 7 that many of the occult meanings of thenumber are derived, such as: Success, mastery; upper hand, whip hand; ascendancy, conquest,triumph. These ideas are clearly suggested by the symbolism of Key 7, Le Chariot.The special mode of consciousness associated in Hebrew Wisdom with 7 is the Occult or SecretIntelligence. The Hebrew word here translated “Occult or Secret” is NSThR, Nesther, from SThR,Sether, signifying “to shut up, to cover, to hide, to veil, to conceal.” There is a closecorrespondence of meaning between this particular terminology and the Sanskrit Bupta Vidya,or Secret Wisdom. And if you are at all familiar with modern works on Occultism, particularlywith those of H. P. Blavatsky, you will understand that the number 7 is, so to say, the seal of theSecret Doctrine. It is so in the Orient, and equally so in the Occident, for the Western School ofAdepts, when they summarized their occult knowledge in the Rosicrucian Fama Fraternitatisgave an elaborate description of a seven-sided building as the key to that strange little book.Again, the Tarot itself is built on a system of sevens. For it is composed of one un-numbered, orZero, card and 77 or 7 x 11 other cards. The major trumps fall naturally into a scheme of 7s,thus: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"93The minor trumps are 56 in number (7 x 8), and each suit is composed of a double septenary,or 14 cards. Thus this sacred and mysterious number is stamped on the Tarot, which is noneother than the ROTA mentioned by the Rosicrucians as one of their most cherishedpossessions.The number 7 is known also as the Sphere of Venus, and the magic square of 7 x 7, containing49 cells, is given by Cornelius Agrippa and others as the one which particularly belongs toVenus. Remember here, as elsewhere, that the Sphere of Venus is not to be confused withVenus herself. This Sphere of Venus is said in Qabalistic psychology to be the seat of desire,closely akin to what Hindus call Kama.KeywordsMystery, Occultism, Hidden Wisdom, Secrecy; Rest, Stillness, Quiescence (but not absolutecessation. What is represented is rather a period of quiescence between periods of activity, therest of the Sabbath, and not the stillness of the grave); Victory, Success, Fulfillment.In the Tarot all the Sevens of the minor trumps indicate, more or less, the temporary cessationof activity. So does Key 7 in the Major Trumps. And when, in the final stage of a divination, theSignificator falls in the 7th place on the Tree of Life, the meaning us much the same. If the cardsin this final layout are Well-dignified, the suggestion is usually that the Querant will enjoy a well-earned rest. If Ill-dignified, the intimation is that he will be delayed and blocked in his actions,that his desires will be active, but not fruitful.The Number 8By its form, suggesting a twisted belt, in whose loops wheels would revolve in oppositedirections, the number 8 symbolizes the truth that opposite modes of expression (all pairs ofopposites) are effects of a single cause. 8 is the digit value of the name IHVH, Jehovah, 888 isthe numeration of the name Jesus in Greek, 8 is the “Dominical Number,” or “Number of theLord” in Christian tradition, and it is the particular number of the “god” named Mercury byRomans, Hermes by Greeks, Nebo by Assyrians, and Thoth by Egyptians. Thus 8 is mostdefinitely the number of Magic and Hermetic Art, the number of supreme attainment. Someshadow of this truth, and of the association of 8 with Mercury, god of commerce, is shown inthe attribution of the meaning “big business” to 8 in modern numerology.The form of the figure is derived from the twined serpents of the wand of Mercury (See Key 1,Le Bateleur, where the juggler holds such a wand in his left hand.) The movement of the handin writing the number 8 is a rhythmic alternation which suggests action and reaction, andtherefore compensation, equation, equalization, coordination, and like ideas. Here we have animage of the alternate cycles of involution and evolution. Rhythm is perhaps one of the mostimportant meanings of 8. All the great forces of nature have their characteristic rhythms, andthe great magical secret is related to this truth. Much of the practical work in magic consists inprocesses whereby the operator attunes certain of his own activities to define cosmic rhythms,"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"94 Oracle of TarotFinal Stage of Divinationso that he vibrates in synchrony with them. A hint of this is given in the major trump entitledStrength, or La Force, which is numbered 8 in the occult Tarot.The Hebrew name of 8 is HVD, pronounced “hode”, and usually written Hod. It is usuallytranslated Splendor, but its root-meaning is prominence or eminence. Thus the root-ideasassociated with 8 in the Qabalah are: Distinction, Eminence, Importance; Intensity, Fullness,Greatness; Immensity, Infinity (which is represented in mathematics by the horizontal 8).The mode of consciousness represented by 8 in Qabalah is named the Perfect Intelligence, andthe adjective translated “Perfect” is ShLM, rendered in English as “Salem.” It signifies: Whole,entire, perfect; healthy, full of strength; peaceable, friendly. It is noteworthy, too, that a slightvariation of the same word, spelt with the same letters, but with different vowel-points, meansrequital, or recompense, and thus ties in with the idea of compensation suggested by the formof the figure 8. This mode of consciousness is directly connected with the functioning of theself-conscious level of the human mind, personified as Hermes or Mercury, for it is through thefunctions of this part of our make-up that we discover, classify and utilize the cosmic rhythms.By this means we attain to perfect physical and psychical adjustment, and thus to health of mindand body. And because a perfectly healthy person is self-confident without being egotistic orbumptious, such a person is naturally peaceable. Personal and national ill-health is expressed inirritability, strife and warfare. Persons and nations with healthy minds and bodies keep thepeace.8 is the Sphere of Mercury in the Qabalistic system.The Number 9As the last of the series of numeral symbols, 9 represents completion, attainment, realization,the goal of endeavor, the end of a cycle. But this completion is not absolute cessation. The endof one cycle is the beginning of another. Every End is the seed of a fresh Beginning. In HebrewWisdom, therefore, 9 has from time immemorial been associated with the idea of reproduction.Its Hebrew name is Yesod (ISVD), signifying Bias or Foundation. This word is often used tosignify commencement or beginning, and thus bears out what was said about 9. Other wordsrelated to 9 in this connection are: Ground, support, substratum; fundamental, principle.9 is also termed the Pure or Clear Intelligence. The Hebrew adjective is THVR, Tahoor, signifyingclean, shining, not soiled, pure (as Unalloyed gold). In the metaphysical sense it refers to thesublimation and purification of consciousness. But the important point to be noted here is that9 on the Tree of Life also relates to the automatic consciousness, the subconsciousness ofmodern psychology. This is the habit-mind, and since habits determine fundamental characterand temperament, here is a very strong hint that the supreme attainment, or completion ofoccult training, is the establishment of right habits, the purification of the automaticconsciousness, so that he who has completed the Great Work maintains his right relation to thecosmic rhythms automatically, without the necessity for continual conscious effort which"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"95besets those of us who are not yet perfect adepts. Key 9 of the major trumps will repay study inthis connection. Note that the Hermit has himself reached the heights of attainment, but thathe is disseminating light to others who struggle upward on the path.9 in the Qabalah is called the Sphere of the Moon.The Number 10The number 10 is a sacred number in occultism. Symbolized as shown in the margin.•• •• • •• • • •it was called the Tetraktys, and on this figure Pythagoras is said to have sworn his pupils tosecrecy. 10 is a self-reproductive number, because the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10, or thetheosophic extension of 10, is 55, and the digits of 55 add to 10.In Hebrew Wisdom 10 is called Malkuth (MLKVTh) the Kingdom. It is also known as the Sphere ofthe Elements, the Hebrew for this designation meaning literally, “The Breaker of theFoundations,” or that in which the fundamental basis of manifestation is divided into apparentmultiplicity, or broken up into parts. The meaning of “kingdom” is, the realm of a king, thesphere of a king’s operations, also the government, laws and administrative activity whereby theauthority of a king is made manifest. Thus in the Bible the idea of “Kingdom” is definitelyconnected with the Ten Commandments which are the summary and basis of the Mosaic Law.The Kingdom in other words is the manifest law. Thus the theosophic extension of 10 givesthe number 55, or the doubling of 5, the number of Law and Justice.10 is also called the Resplendent Intelligence, but the Hebrew adjective is probably derived froma word meaning number, measure, arrangement, composition. The root-idea is that of Order,and just as 10 is the theosophic extension of 4, so is the idea of arrangement implied by 4worked out to its completion in the occult meaning of 10. Key 10 in the major trumpsrepresents this conception of a world-order, or cosmic mechanism.In the human organism, 10 corresponds to the field of sensation, to the point of contactbetween a human being and the world around him.The connection of all this material with divination may not be apparent at the first or even atthe tenth reading. But the student who wishes to be a true diviner will do well to develop asmuch understanding of these ten fundamental numbers as he can. For the final stage of thedivinatory operation, in which the basic meanings of one of these numbers is the key to theinterpretation of whatever cards appear in the layout, is the one which most often leads to thediscovery of the essential significance of the operation."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"96 Oracle of TarotFinal Stage of DivinationThe operation itself is concluded by counting the cards, and pairing, as in earlier stages of thedivination. Because there are 78 cards in the pack, and they are dealt one at a time into tenheaps, the first 8 piles will contain 10 cards each, and the last two will contain only 9 cards. Andsince the Significator will be one of these, in piles 1 to 8 inclusive there will be a single card leftover at the completion of the pairing, while in piles 9 and 10 the pairs will come out even. Thesingle card in the first 8 piles, and the card to the left of the last pair in the 9th and 10th pileswill be the one that gives the final indication as to time. The rule for judging this is the same asthat given in the preceding lesson.— • —YOU now have the method. All that you need from now on is practice. Above all, be sure tolearn thoroughly the fundamental meanings of the cards. When these are committed tomemory, you will find that their correlations are much easier to understand. You will find that ifyou work with one suit at a time in the minor trumps, mentally calling up the image of eachcard, wherever you happen to be, you can soon perfect your knowledge in odd moments whichmight otherwise be wasted."}]
