It alludes to your condition in a state of darkness unillumined by the Lamp of Occult Knowledge and groping your way blindly in the search for truth.

The grip or token is given in the following manner Advance your left foot about six inches touching mine, side to side and toe to heel Now extend your right hand as if to grip mine, but miss it intentionally; again extend it and seize mine by the fingers only. It alludes to the seeking for guidance in darkness. The Grand Word is HAR-PAR-KRAT whispered by alternate syllables mouth to ear thus.

The password is (blank) which will be periodically changed at each Equinox so that a member who has resigned, demitted, or been expelled from the Order, may be in ignorance of the existing password.

Hiero: The Three Fold Cord bound about your waist, was an image of the three-fold bondage of Mortality, which amongst the Initiated is called earthly or material inclination, that has bound into a narrow place the once far-wandering Soul; and the Hood-wink was an image of the Darkness, of Ignorance, of Mortality that has blinded men to the Happiness and Beauty their eyes once looked upon. The Double Cubical Altar in the center of the Hall, is an emblem of visible Nature or the Material Universe, concealing within herself the mysteries of all dimensions, while revealing her surface to the exterior senses. It is a double cube because, as the Emerald Tablet has said The things that are below are a reflection of the things that are above. The world of men and women created to unhappiness is a reflection of the World of Divine Beings created to Happiness. It is described in the SEPHER YETZIRAH, or The Book of Formation, as An Abyss of Height and as an Abyss of Depth, An Abyss of the East and An Abyss of the West, An Abyss of the North and An Abyss of the South. The Altar is black because, unlike Divine Beings who unfold in the Element of Light, the Fires of Created Brings arise from Darkness and Obscurity. On the Altar is a White Triangle to be the Image of that Immortal Light, that Triune Light, which moved in Darkness and formed the World of Darkness and out of Darkness. There are two contending Forces and One always uniting them. And these Three have their Image in the three-fold Flame of our Being and in the threefold wave of the sensual world. Hiero: Stands in the form of Cross, saying: Hiero: Glory be to Thee, Father of the Undying. For Thy Glory Bows out rejoicing, to the ends of the Earth! Hiero: He reseats himself. Hiero: The Red Cross above the White Triangle, is an Image of Him Who was unfolded in the Light. At its East, South, West and North Angles are a Rose Fire, Cup of Wine and Bread and Salt."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"These allude to the Four Elements, Air, Fire, Water, Earth. The Mystical Words - KHABS AM PEKHT - are ancient Egyptian and are the origin of the Greek KONX OM PAX - which was uttered at the Eleusinian Mysteries. A literal translation would be Light Rushing Out in One Ray and they signify the same form of Light as that symbolized by the Staff of the Kerux. East of the Double Cubical Altar of created things, art the Pillars of Hermes and of Solomon. On these are painted certain Hieroglyphics from the 17th and the 125th Chapters of the Book of the Dead. They are the symbols of the two powers of Day and Night, Love and Hate, Work and Rest, the subtle force of the Lodestone and the Eternal out-pouring and in-pouring of the Heart of God. The Lamps that burn, though with a veiled light, upon their summits show that the Pathway to Hidden Knowledge, unlike the Pathway of Nature - which is a continual undulation, the winding hither and thither of the Serpent - is the straight and narrow way between them. It was because of this that I passed between them, when you came to the Light, and it was because of this that you were placed between them to receive the final Consecration. Two contending Forces and one which unites them eternally. Two basal angles of the triangle and one which forms the apex. Such is the origin of Creation, it is the Triad of Life. My Throne at the Gate of the East is the Place of the Guardian of the Dawning Sun. The Throne of the Hiereus at the Gate of the West is the Place of the Guardian against the Multitudes that sleep through the Light and awaken at the twilight, The Throne of the Hegemon seated between the Columns is the Place of Balanced Power, between the Ultimate Light and the Ultimate Darkness. These meanings are shown in detail and by the color of our robes. The Wand of the Kerux is the Beam of Light from the Hidden Wisdom, and his Lamp is an emblem of the ever burning Lamp of the Guardian of the Mysteries, The Seat of the Stolistes at the Gate of the North is the Place of the Guardian of the Cauldron and the Well of Water of Cold and Moisture. The Seat of the Dadouchos at the Gate of the South is the Place of the Guardian of the Lake of Fire and the Burning Bush.

Let me therefore advise you to remember this day as a marked one in your existence and to adopt and cultivate a mental condition worthy of this Order. To this end let me first earnestly recommend you never to forget due honour and reverence to the Lord of the Universe, for as the whole is greater than its parts, so is He far greater than we, who are but as sparks derived from that unsupportable Light which is in Him. It is written that the borders of his Garment of Flame sweep the ends of the Universe and unto Him all return. Therefore do we adore Him, therefore do we invoke Him; therefore in adoration to Him sinks even the Banner of the East. (Done)Secondly, let me"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"advise you never to ridicule or cast obloquy upon the form of religion professed by another, for what right have you to desecrate what is sacred in his eyes? Thirdly, never let the seal of secrecy regarding the Order be absent from your recollection, and beware that you betray it not by a casual or unthinking word. Fourthly, study well that Great Arcanum, the proper equilibrium of mercy and severity, for either unbalanced is not good; unbalanced severity is cruelty and oppression; unbalanced mercy is but weakness and would permit evil to exist unchecked, thus making itself as it were the accomplice of that evil. Lastly, do not be daunted by the difficulties of Occult Study and remember that every obstacle can at length be conquered by perseverance. Hiero: Before you can pass on to the next Higher Grade of this Order you will have to make yourself perfect in the following: 1) The names and alchemical symbols of the four elements. 2) The names, astrological symbols and elemental attribution of the twelve signs of the Zodiac. 3) The names and astrological symbols of the seven planets, also their houses, exaltation and triplicity in the Zodiac. 4) The names, characters and numerical values of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. 5) The names and English meanings of the ten Qabalistic Sephiroth. A MSS. lecture on these subjects of study may be obtained on application. When you know these thoroughly you must signify the same by letter to the Cancellarius or Scribe. You will then be examined and if found perfect you will be eligible for admission to the next higher grade, should the higher powers approve your application.
