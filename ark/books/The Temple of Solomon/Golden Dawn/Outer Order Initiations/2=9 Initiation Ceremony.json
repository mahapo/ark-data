Fan, Lamp, Cup, and Salt are replaced by them on the Altar. Hiero: (Taking Cubical Cross from Candidate) The Cubical Cross is a fitting emblem of the equilibriated and balanced forces of the Elements. It is composed of 22 squares externally thus referring to the 22 Hebrew letters which are placed thereon. Twenty-two are the letters of the Eternal Voice; in the Vault of Heaven, in the depth of the Earth, in the Abyss of Water, in the all-presence of Fire; Heaven cannot speak their fullness, Earth cannot utter it. Yet hath the Creator bound them in all things. He hath mingled them through Water. He hath whirled them aloft in Fire; He hath sealed them in the air of Heaven; He hath distributed them through the Planets; He hath assigned unto them the 12 Constellations of the zodiac. (Places Cubical Cross aside.) The Thirty-second Path of the Sepher Yetzirah which answereth unto the Letter Tau is called the Administrative Intelligence and it is so called because it directeth and associateth in all their operations the Seven Planets, even all of them in their own due courses. To it therefore, is attributed the due knowledge of the Seven abodes of Assiah, the Material World, which are symbolized in the Apocalypse by the Seven Churches. It refers to the Universe as composed of the Four elements; to the Kerubim; to the Qlippoth, and to the Astral Plane. It is the Reflection of the Sphere of Saturn. It represents the connecting and binding link between the Material and Formative worlds, Assiah and Yetzirah, and necessarily passes through the Astral Plane, the abode of the elementals, the Qlippoth, and the Shells of the Dead. It is the rending of the Veil of the Tabernacle whereon the Kerubim and the Palm Trees were depicted; it is the passing of the Gate of Eden. (Leads Zelator to the West of the Altar.) These ideas are symbolically resumed in the representation of the twenty-first Key of the Tarot before you. Within the oval formed of the 72 circles is a female figure, nude save for a scarf which floats around her. She is crowned with the lunar crescent of Isis, and holds in each hand a wand, her legs form a cross. She is the Bride of the Apocalypse, the Qabalistic Queen of the Canticles, the Egyptian Isis of Nature now shown partly unveiled, the Great Feminine Kerubic Angel Sandalphon on the left hand of the Mercy Seat of the Ark. The two wands are the directing forces of the Positive and Negative currents. The Seven pointed Star or Heptagram alludes to the Seven Palaces of Assiah, the crossed legs to the Symbol of the Four Letters of the Name. The surmounting Crescent receives the Influences alike of Geburah and of Gedulah. She is the synthesis of the 32nd Path uniting Malkuth with Yesod. The oval of 72 small circles is the Schem-hamphorasch, or the 72 fold Name of the Deity. The 12 larger circles form the Zodiac. At the angles are the four Kerubim, which are the vivified Powers of the Letters of the Name Tetragrammaton operating in the elements, through which you have just symbolically passed in the preceding ceremony. The Fan, Lamp, Cup and Salt represent the four elements themselves, whose inhabitants are the Sylphs, Salamanders, Undines and Gnomes. Be thou therefore prompt and active as the sylphs, but avoid frivolity and caprice; be energetic and strong like the salamanders but avoid irritability and ferocity; be flexible and attentive to images like the undines, but avoid idleness and changeability; be laborious and patient like the gnomes but avoid grossness and avarice. So shalt thou gradually develop the powers of thy soul, and fit thyself to command the Spirits of the elements. The Altar as in the preceding degrees represents the Material universe, and on its right is the Garden of Eden, symbolized by the Station of the Hegemon, and on its left is Gehenna the abode of the Shells symbolized by the Tablet of the Kerux. These Officers will now explain these drawings."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Hiero: Returns to his place. Heg: Leads Candidate to his Tablet in The South. Heg: The drawing before you shows in part the Occult symbolism of the Garden of Eden and the Holy City of the Apocalypse. The Outer circle is the enclosing Paradisiacal Wall guarded by the Kerubim and the Flame, and the Seven Squares are the Seven Mansions thereof, or the Seven Spheres, wherein Tetragrammaton Elohim planted every Tree which is pleasant and good for food symbolized by the Palm Trees wrought upon the Veil of the Tabernacle and the Door of the Holy of Holies in the Temple. But in the midst is the Tree of Life, the Throne of God, and the Lamb. Twelve are the foundations and twelve are the Gates, shown by the twelve entrances in the drawing. The four streams rising from one central fountain are the rivers of Eden, referring to the four elements proceeding from the Omnipresent Spirit. Kerux: Leads Candidate to his Tablet in the North. Kerux: The drawing before you represents the Seven Infernal Mansions and the four Seas. The first circle represents the Waters of Tears; the second circle represents the Waters of Creation; the third circle represents the Waters of Ocean; and the fourth circle represents the False Sea. In the inner circles are on the right hand the seven Earths, which are: 1) Aretz 2) Adamah 3) Gia 4) Neschiah 5) Tziah 6) Arega and 7) Thebel or Cheled. On the left hand are the seven Infernal Habitations which are: 1) Sheol 2) Abaddon 3) Titahion 4) Bar Schauheth 5) Tzelmoth 6) Shaari Moth and 7) Gehinnon.

Hiero: (To Zelator) Frater (Sorer) XYZ as in the Zelator Grade there were given the symbolical representations of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, of the Garden of Eden and of the Holy Place; so in the Grade of Theoricus the Sanctum Sanctorum with the Ark and Kerubim is shown, as well as the Garden of Eden with which it coincides, while in the 32nd Path leading hereunto, through which you have just now symbolically passed, the Kerubic Guardians are represented and the Palm Trees or Trees of Progression in the Garden of Eden. Honoured Hegemon, conduct the Zelator to the West, and place him thus before the Portal of the 32nd Path by which he has symbolically entered. (Done.) Zelator: Faces to East. Kerux: Returns to his place. Hiereus: By what symbol dost thou enter herein? Heg: By the peculiar emblem of the Kerux, which is the Caduceus of Hermes. Hiereus: The Tree of Life and the Three Mother Letters are the keys wherewith to unlock the meaning of the Caduceus of Hermes. The upper part of the Wand rests on KETHER and the Wings stretch out unto CHOKMAH and BINAH, the three Supernal Sephiroth. The lower seven are embraced by the Serpents, whose heads fall upon CHESED and GEBURAH. They are the twin Serpents of Egypt, and the currents of astral light. Furthermore, the wings and the top of the wand form the letter Shin, the symbol of fire. The heads and upper halves of the serpents form Aleph, the symbol of Air, while their tails enclose Mem the symbol of Water. The Fire above, the Waters of Creation below, and the Air symbol vibrating between them. Hiero: Leaves his throne and comes to the West of Altar. Hegemon conducts Candidate to him and then returns to his place in the south. Hiero: The symbols before you represent alike the Garden of Eden and the Holy of Holies. Before you stands the Tree of Life formed of the Sephiroth and their connecting Paths. Into its"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"complete symbolism it is impossible here to enter, for it is the key of all things, when rightly understood. Upon each Sephira are written in Hebrew letters its Name, the Divine names ruling it, and those of the Angels and Archangels attributed to it. The connecting Paths are twenty two in number, and are distinguished by the twenty two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, making with the Ten Sephiroth themselves, the thirty two Paths of Wisdom of the Sepher Yetzirah. The course of the Hebrew letters as placed on the Paths forms, as you see, the symbol of the Serpent of Wisdom; while the natural succession of the Sephiroth forms the flaming Sword, and the course of the Lightning Flash, as shown in the drawing. The cross within the triangle, apex downwards placed upon the Altar at the base of the Tree of Life, refers to the Four Rivers of Paradise, while the angles of the Triangle refer to the Three Sephiroth NETZACH, HOD and YESOD. The two Pillars right and left of the Tree are the symbols of Active and Passive, Male and Female, Adam and Eve. They also allude to the Pillars of Fire and Cloud which guided the Israelites in the Wilderness, and the Hot and Moist natures are further marked by the Red Lamp and the Cup of Water. The Pillars further represent the two Kerubim of the Ark; the right Metatron, Male; the left Sandalphon Female. Above them ever bum the lamps of their Spiritual Essence, the Higher Life of which they are partakers in the Eternal Uncreated One. (Giving Sign of Theoricus) Glory be unto Thee, Lord of the Land of Life, for thy Splendor filleth the Universe. The Grade of Theoricus is referred to Yesod, as the Grade of Zelator is to Malkuth. The Path between them is assigned to the Letter Tau, whose Portal you now see in the West and through which you have just symbolically passed. To this Grade as to those preceding it certain Secret Signs, and Tokens are attributed. They consist of a sign, grip or token. Grand Word, Mystic Number and Pass Word formed therefrom; The sign is thus given - Raise the arms level with the shoulders, bend the elbows, arms upwards and hands bent outwards, as if supporting a weight. It represents you in the Path of Yesod, supporting the Pillars of Mercy and Severity; it is the sign of the classical Atlas, supporting the Universe upon his shoulders, whom Hercules had to emulate. It is the Isis of Nature supporting the Heavens. The grip is the general grip of the First Order. The Grand Word is a name of seven letters which means the Vast and Mighty One - SHADDAI EL CHAI. The mystic number is 45 and from it is formed the Pass Word which is Mem, Heh, Mah. It should be lettered separately when given. Unto this Grade and unto the Sephira Yesod the ninth Path of the Sepher Yetzirah is referred. It is called the Pure or clear Intelligence, and it is so called because it purifieth and maketh clear the Sephiroth, proveth and amendeth the forming of their representation and disposeth their unities or Harmonies wherein they combine without mutilation or division. The distinguishing badge of the Grade which you will now be entitled to wear, is the sash of a Zelator with the addition of a white cross above the triangle and the numbers 2 and 9 within a circle and a square respectively left and right of its summit; and beneath the triangle the number 32 between two parallel narrow white lines. The meaning of the Tablet of Earth was explained to you in the preceding Grade. Hiero: Proceeds to East. Hegemon comes forward and guides Candidate to the East. Hiero: The three Portals facing you are the Gates of the Paths leading from the Grade. That on the right connects it with the Grade of Philosophus, that on the left with the Grade of Practicus, while the central one leads to the higher. This Grade is especially referred to the element of Air, and therefore the great Watch Tower or Terrestrial Tablet of the East forms one of its principal emblems. It is known as the first or Great Eastern Quadrangle or Tablet of Air, and it is one of the four great Tablets delivered unto Enoch by the Great Angel Ave. From it are drawn the three Holy Secret Names of God ORO IBAH AOZPI which are borne upon the Banners of the East; and the numberless Divine and Angelic names which appertain unto the Element of Air. To the Moon also is this Grade related. Its Kamea or Mystical square is formed of 81 squares containing the numbers from 1 to 8 1 arranged so as to show the same sum each way. Its ruling numbers are 9, 81, 369 and 3321. This Tablet (indicating it) shows the mystical Seals and Names drawn from the Kamea of the Moon. The Seals are formed from lines drawn to and from certain numbers in the square. The name answering to 9 is Hod"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"meaning Glory; that answering to 81 is Elim the plural of the Divine Name El, that answering to 369 is Chasmodai, the Spirit of the Moon. The other names are those of the Intelligences and Spirits of the Moon. On this Tablet are shown the meanings of the Lunar symbol when inscribed upon the Tree of Life. Thus its crescent in increase represents the side of Mercy; and its crescent in decrease the side of Severity; while at full it reflects the Sun of Tiphareth. Hiero: Resumes his seat. Heg: Conducts Candidate to Hiereus in The West. Hiereus: The Tablet before you shows the duplicated form of the alchemic Sephiroth. In the first the Metallic root is in Kether, Lead in Chokmah, Tin in Binah, Silver in Chesed, Gold in Geburah, Iron in Tiphareth, Netzach and Hod are the places of Hermaphroditical Brass, Yesod is Mercury and Malkuth is the Medicine of Metals. In the second form the Mercury, Sulphur and Salt are referred to the three Supernal Sephiroth, and the Metals to the seven lower but in a rather different order. For in all things as Supernal so Terrestrial, is the Tree of Life to be found, whether it be in animal, in vegetable or in mineral natures. Heg: Leads Candidate to his own Tablet in South. Heg: This Tablet shows you the Geometrical lineal Figures attributed to the Planets. They are thus referred: The Number 3 and the Triangle to Saturn. The Number 4 and the Square to Jupiter. The Number 5 and the Pentagram to Mars. The Number 6 and the Hexagram to the Sun. The Number 7 and the Heptagram to Venus. The Number 8 and the Octagram to Mercury. The Number 9 and the Enneagram to the Moon. Of these the heptagram and the octagram can be traced in two modes and the enneagram in three; the first in each case being most consonant to the nature of the Planet. Heg: Resumes his seat. Kerux: Comes forward and conducts the Candidate to his Tablet in the North. Kerux: Before you are represented the sixteen Figures of Geomancy, which are formed from all the combinations of single and double points in 4 lines which can possibly occur. Two are attributed to each of the seven Planets, and the remaining two to Caput and Cauda Draconis. Some of them are also attributed to Fire, others to Air, others to Earth and Water. They are also classed under the signs of the Zodiac. Kerux: Conducts Candidate to foot of Hierophant's throne in The East. Hiero: I now congratulate you upon having attained to the Grade of Theoricus, and in recognition thereof I confer upon you the Mystic title of Poraios de Rejectis which means Brought from among the Rejected Ones and I give you the symbol of Ruach which is the Hebrew name for Air.
