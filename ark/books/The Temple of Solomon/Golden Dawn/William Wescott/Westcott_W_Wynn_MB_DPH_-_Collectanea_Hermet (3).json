THE Esch Meznreph or Ash Metznvefih, is only known to persons of Western Culture from the Latin Translation found in a fragmentary condition in the work entitled Kahalalz De~iudata by Knorr von Rosenroth, published at Sulzbach in 1677-84. These volumes have as a sub-title \" The Transcen- dental, Metaphysical and Theological Doctrines of the Hebrews \", and they enshrine a Latin translation, with part of the Hebrew text and commentaries, of the great Solzar or ZOHAR, \" The Hook of Splendour \" which is the most famous of all the Hebrew mystical codices of the Kabalah. Three of the principal tracts of the Zolzcrr are now familiar to English readers through the translation of my friend, MacGregor Mathers : his edition of TTIw Rook of Conccnled hlystevy , The Grentev Holy A ssenzbly , and The Lessev Holy Assembly, has obtained so great a circulation that I am emboldened to issue this volume, which exemplifies the Kabalistic scheme of Alchymy, as one of the series of Collec- tawa Hevmetica. The Bsch Metznrejh is still extant as a separate treatise in what is called the Hebrew language, but which is more properly Aramaic Chaldee: it was a com- panion volume to the Chaldean Book of Nunzbevs so often referred to by H. P. Blavatsky, and which is no longer to be procured, although I have reason to think that copies still exist in co~cealment. The first volume of Rosenroth's work consists entirely of a Kabalistic Lexicon. Upon the title-page is inscribed :- Apparattis i?z Librum Sohar nerrtpe Loci co~~z~tzu~zes Kabalistici secundum ordinem A lfihabeticz~nz concinitccti, pi Lexici ilzstnv esse possrrnt."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"i v PREFACE. Upon the main title page of the work he describes this portion as collected from five sources:- I. Clsvis ad Kabalam antiquam : i.e., explicatio et ad debitas Classes Sephiristicas facta distributio omnium nomi- nun1 et cognominum Divinorum i: Libro Pardes. 11. Liber Schaare Orah seu Pork Lucis.

Compendium Libri Cabalistico-Chymici, r;Esch Met- zareph dicti, de Lapide Philosophico. The Bsclz Metzareplz can be re-constructed from its fragments scattered through this Lexicon, almost in its entirety. This work has been done by Tlze Lovev of Phila- lethes, who published the English version of 1714. The present volume is a Reprint of that English version, in its original form ; many corrections however, have been made, and a few changes in spelling and diction introduced in order to avoid archaic forms, leading young students into difficulties. For instance, Kabalah is written instead of Kabbala, because the Hebrew word has only one B, and ah represents the Hebrew letter Hi: better than the English n, which suggests that the word is spelled with the Hebrew aleph. The Hebrew or Chaldee name of this treatise is spelled thus ASHH MTzRP. The Lovev of Philalethes of I714 spelled this in English by a diphthong A3 SCH ; and in the second word he puts Z for Tz, zain for tzaddi, this leads to confusion and error. The meaning of Ash or Ashah is \" fire \" or '' a fire offering \", and metzareph is \" cleansing \" or puri- fying \". The whole title refers to '' Cleansing Fires \", as the mode by which pure gold was obtained in Alchymy, by burning off the dross and so separating the pure from the impure- on the material plane ! while the cleansing fire of trial is also a suitable simile for the purification and exalta- tion of the human soul on the plane of spiritual Alchymy, The words Ash Metzareph, or Bsch Mezareph as Kosen- roth spells it, are found in the book of Malachi, cap. 3, v. 2, where it is said that the messenger of the Lord is like a 6b refiner's fire \". There are in the book many references to other old Hebrew"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"PREFACE. V and Chaldee works, several of these are included in the great collection of tracts called the Talmud; of this work there are two great forms, the Talmud df Babylon, and that of Jerusalem. The former is the more important, and is more learned and mystical. Among the tracts referred to, are :- Pirke Aboth, PRQI ABUT, Sayings of the Fathers ; Baba Kama, BBA QMA, The first Gate; Baba Bathra, BBA BTKA, The Latter Gate; Baba Metsia, BBA MTzIOA, The Middle Gate. The work Sclzanve Ovalz mentioned by Rosenroth is the Hebrew SHOK AURH or Gate of Light written by Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla ben Abraham. The Liber Pardes of Rosenroth is the book SePher Pardesh Rimmonim, or Gardez of Pomegra~zates, its author was Rabbi Moses Cordovero, or Remak, who flourished about 1550. The value of this treatise is so largely dependent upon the Literal Kabalah and the method of Gematria, or the mutual conversion between letters and numbers that it is wise to introduce here a table of the English Letters attributed to the Hebrew Letters and Numbers. The system followed is that conventional one laid down in Wynn Westcott on \" Numbers \", which has also been adopted in each of the previous volumes of the series of Collectanea Hermetica. The system is only an approximation to the true rendering of Hebrew into English ; as for example I is adopted for Yod, but some authors use I or Y or J ; and for Ayin, 0 is adopted which has sometimes the force of Ay and 0, and at others of Gn, when used as a consonant.

The special final Letters are not used as numerals in the Bslt Metzamplz. The &slz ,Wetzav~plz is almost entirely Alchymical in its teachings, and is suggestive rather than explanatory in its words. The allegorical method of teaching runs through it, and the similes have to be kept carefully in mind, otherwise confusion will result. Several Alchymic processes are set out, but not in such a way that they could be carried out by a neophyte ; any attempt to do so would discover that some- thing vital was missing at one stage or other. Rut although the Bslz Ailetx~zveplz is not a manual of practical Alchymy, yet an attentive study of its statements considered with accurate relation to the numerical allusions, may give some true conclusions as to the materia and agents to be e~nployed in the several forms of Transmutation. The nominal Christian of narrow views will see in this tract a confirmation of his opinion, that Alchymy is an un- holy art and prompted by the Evil One ; and there is perhaps no book which contains more Scripture verses referred to as illustrating the means and aims of Alchyrny ; so that perhaps such a one may point to this work as the brightest example of the assertion that \" the Devil can quote even Holy Scrip- ture to his purpose.\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"CONTENTS.

LISHA%as a most notable Prophet, an Example E of Natural Wisdom, a Despiser of Riches, (as the History of the Healing of Naanlan sheweth. 2 Kings, c. 5, v: 16) and thergfoie truly Rich. AC: cording to what is said in Pirke Ab~th,~ viz., Who is Rich ? He that reioiceth in his Portion, cap. 4. For so the true ~h~sic& of impure Metals hath 'not an outward Show of Riches, but is rather like the Tohu%f the first Nature, empty and void. Which Word is of equal Number with the Word Elisha, viz., 41 I. For it is a very true saying in Baba Karna\" fol. 71. col. 2. The thing which causeth Riches, (such as Natural Wisdom) is supplied instead7 of Riches. Learn therefore to purify Naaman, coming from the North, out of Syria, and acknowledge the power of Jor- dan : Which is as it were Tar-dinvthat is the River of Judgment flowing out of th& North. And remember that which is said in Baba Bathra, fol. 25, col. 2. He that will become Wise, let him live in the South; and he that will grow Rich, let him turn himself toward the North, etc. Although in the same place Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi says, let him live always in the South, for whilst he becomes Wise, at the same time"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"he becomes Rich. \" Length of Days is in her right hand, and in her left, Riches and Honour.\" Prov., c. 3, V. 16. So thou wilt not desire other Riches. But know, that the Mysteries of this Wisdom, differ not from the superior ~ysteries of the Kabalah. For such as is the Consideration of the Predicaments in Holiness, the same is also in Impurity ; and the same Sephiroth which are in Atziluth,\"he same are in Assiah,1Â° yea, the same in that Kingdom, which is commonly called the Mineral Kingdom ; although their Excellency is always greater upon the spiritual plane. Therefore the Metallic Root here possesseth the place of Kether,ll which hath an occult Nature, involved in nreat obscurity, and from which all Metals have their b Origin ; even as the Nature of Kether is hidden, and the other Sephiroth flow from thence. Lead hath the place of Chokmah, because Chokmah immediately proceeds from Kether, as it immediately comes from the Metallic Root, and in Enigmatic similes, it is called the \" Father \" of the following Natures. Tin possesseth the place of Binah, shewing Age, by its Greyness, and shadowing forth Severity and Judicial Rigour, by its Crackling. Silver is placed under the Classis of Chesed, by all the Masters of the Kabalah, chiefly for its Colour and Use. Thus far the White Natures. Now follow the Red. Gold is placed under Geburah, according to the most common Opinion of the Kabalists ; Job in c. 37, v. 22, also tells us that gold cometh from the north,12 not only for its Colour, but for the sake of its Heat and Sulphur. Iron is referred to Tiphereth,ls for he is like a Man of War, according to Exod., c. 15, v. 2, and hath the Name of Seir Anpin,\" from his swift Anger, according to Psalm 2, v. ult., kiss the son lest he be angry.\" Netzach and Hod are the two Median places of the"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Body, and the Seminal Receptacles, and refer to the Hermaphroditic Brass. So also the two Pillars of the Temple of Solomon (referring to these two Sephirot h) were made of Brass, I Kings, c. 7, v. 15. Jesod is Argent vive. For to this, the name L6 ~ivine\" is Characteristically given ; and this Livings IYater is in every case the Foundation of all Nature and of the Metallic Art. But the true Medicine of Metals is referred to Mal- kuth, for many Reasons ; because it represents the rest of the Natures under the Metan~orphoses of Gold and Silver, right and left, Judgment and Mercy,lkon- cerning which we will speak more largely elsewhere. Thus I have delivered to thee the Key to unlock many Secret Gates, and have opened the door to the inmost adytk of Nature. But if anyone hath placed those things in another order, I shall not contend with him, inasnluch as all systems tend to the one truth. For it may be said, the three^ Supernals are the Three Fountains of Metallic things. The thick water is Kether, Salt is Chokmah, and Sulphur is Binah; for known reasons. And so the Seven Inferior will represent the Seven Metals, uiz., Geclulah and Geburah, Silver and Gold ; Tiphereth, Iron ; Netzach and Hod, Tin and Copper ; Jesod, Lead ; and Malkuth will be the Metallic Woman, and the Luna of the Wise Men ; and the-Field into which the Seeds of secret Minerals ought to he cast, that is the Water of Gold, as this Name (hTezahabu') occurs, Genesis, c. 36, v. 39. But know, my Son, that such Mysteries are hid in these things as no Tongue may be permitted to utter. But I will not offend any more with my Tongue, but will keep my Mouth zoith a Bridle, Psalm 39, v. 2. 17Gehazi the Servant of Elisha, is the type of the vulgar Students of Nature, who contemplate the Vnlley"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"and Depths of Nature, but do not penetrate into her Secrets. Hence they Labour in vain, and remain Servants for ever. They give Counsel about procuring the Son of the Wise Men whose Generation exceeds the Power of Nature, but they can add nothing to assist in his Generation, 2 Kings, c. 4, v. 14 (for which purpose a Man like Elisha is required). For Nature doth not open her Secrets to them, v. 26, but contemns them, v. 30, and the Raising of the Dead is impossible to them, v. 31. They are Covetous, cap. 5, v. 20; Liars: v. 22 ; Deceivers, v. 25 ; Prattlers of other Men's Deeds, 2 Kings, c. 8, v. 4-5, and instead of Riches, contract a Leprosy themselves, that is Disease, Contempt and Poverty, v. 27.

IN Metallic things, Geburah is of the Class to which Gold is referred ; which has again its Decad ; (i.e., Ten Orders or Degrees). So that, I. Chethem,\"hat is, pure fine Gold, is referred to the Kether thereof; which, Canticles, c. 5, v. I I, is re- ferred to the Head. 2. Batzar,' Gold, is referred to Chokmah, as though laid up in strongholds, Job, c. 22, V. 24, 25, and c. 36, v. 19. 3. Charutz,' Prov., c. 8, v. 10, is referred to Binah, from the digging of it ; which Name belongs to the Feminine Gender. 4. Zahab Shachut,Qhat is, fine and drawn Gold, 2 Chron., c. g, v. 15, because it hath the Analogy to the Thread of Chesed. 5. Zahab,G alone, is referred to Geburah, because Gold cometh from the North, Job, c. 37, v. 22. 6. P~z,~ and Zahab Muphaz,' are referred to Tiphereth, I Kings, c. 10, v. 18 ; Psalm, c. 21, v. 4, and 19, v. 11; and Daniel, c. 10, v. 5.' For so Tiphereth and Malkuth are compounded in the Golden Throne, I Kings, c. 10, v. 18; also when it is called a Vessel of Gold, Job, c. 28, v. 17 ; a Crown of Gold, Psalm 21, v. 3 ; Bases of Gold, Cant., c. 5, v. 15. 7. Zahab Sagur,lo is referred to Netzach, that is Gold shut up, I Kings, c. 4, v. 20, 21, Job, c. 28, v. 15, to wit, to bring forth Seed. 8. Zahab Parvajim,ll is referred to Hod ; 2 Chron., c. 3, v. 6, I Kings, c. 6, v. 20, from its likeness to the Blood of Young Bullocks, for this kind is Red at the left Hand."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"9. Zahab Tob,12 is referred to Jesod, that is good Gold, Gen., c. 2, v. 12, for this kind is called good, after the manner of a good Man. 10. But Zahab Ophir,la is referred to Malkuth, Job, c. 22, V. 24, for it is the Name of a Land (or Earth) as called so from Ashes. See also I Chronicles, c. 29, And14 now concerning the Name Zahab, I will lead thee into the Cave of the hidden Matter, and will shew thee the Treasuries of Solon~on'~ mentioned in Nehemiah, c. 13, V. 13, viz., the Perfection of Stones, Exodus, c. 26, v. 6. Come See ! There are many places, to which Gold is referred, va'z., Geburah and Binah, and other special Places, where the Species of Gold are disposed by one thus, by another other ways. But now I represent to thee the Nature of Gold in Tiphereth. Neither can you object out of the Zohar or Tikkunim. For know, that in this place ought to be understood Tiphereth, of the Measure or Degree of Geburah. And it is a great Mystery, because Tiphereth commonly contains Iron under it, from whence we seek Gold. This is the Sol or Sunl\"f Nature and Art, whose lesser Number is ten, the Symbol of all Perfection ; Which Number by Gematria also shews you the lesser Number of Tiphereth ; likewise the word Atah17 belonging to the same in its lesser computation. Mingle therefore Iron and Clay, Daniel, c. 2, v. 33, and thou shalt have the Foundation of Gold. This is that Gold, to which is attributed the Notion of Tetragrammaton,'' Exodus, c. 32, v. 5, in the History of the Calf, which was to be ground to powder, and thrown upon the Waters, v. 20, whence you shall see seven kinds of Gold immediately following one another in the Work."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"First, simple Gold, which is called Zahab barely ; for it is truly Gold, tho' not digged out of the Earth ; nor destroyed by the Violence of the Fire, but living, risidg out of the Waters ; sometimes of a Black, sometimes of a Yellowish, and often like a Peacock's Colour ; going back of its own accord into the Waters, and this may be called Zahab Saba,l%s tho' you should say, Sabi, the Gold of Captivity, because 'tis newly captured, and shut up in its Prison; where it keeps a Fast of Forty Days and Nights, that you know not what is become of it, Exodus, c. 32, v. I ; for there is then no External appearance, even as Moses was hidden and they knew not what had become of him. Secondly, it becomes Zahab Shacuth as though killed and slain, for it dies and its corpse putrefies and grows black : then it is under Judgment and the Shells rule it, and the powers of the name of 42 lettersm fulfil their time upon it. Thirdly, but then follows Zahab Ophir, as tho' you should say Aphar,\" for it is of the Colour of Ashes; which time the twenty-two Letters of the Alphabet will determine for vou. Fourthly, it \"become Zahab Tob, because it is good to Colour, tho' not of the Colour of Gold, but Silver. This may be called Chethem. For it may be so called, according to Lam., c. 4, v. I.\" How shall Gold be coloured with Redness, and Hacchethe~n Hattob,\"?. e., good Silver be changed ? And thence is referred that text in Job, c. 22, v. 24, and pst it upon Opher, he would have said Opheret,\" Lead, Batsar, Silver, that is this White Gold. For from hence you shall have Silver. And to Silver when it shall be in the state of a Stone, add Na~hlim,~~ Rivers of Metallic Waters; from whence you shall have Ophir, that is Gold of Ophir, which was accounted the best. Now you shall have the Number of the great Name Ehejeh ;\" for thou shalt possess, after twenty-one days, these things. If thou"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"wilt now open thy Trea~ure,~' open it ; but it shalt yet only give Silver as Stones, I Kings, c. 10, v. 27. But if thou desire more, let thy Gold be, Fifthly, Zahab Sagur, i.e., Shut-up Gold: Let it remain in the Prison, in the Place of its Maturation, in the Bowels of the Earth of the Wise Men all the time of the Decumbiture of Ezekiel, c. 4, v. 6.2\"nd thy Gold shall become the Sixth, Jarak Rak,\" i.e., Yellow Gold, like Zahab Parvajim. These are the thirty Men, Judges, c. 14, v. 19, whom Sampson slew. For this being done, Seventhly, Your Gold will be Paz and Muphaz and Uphaz ; being strengthened to Conquer and Colour all imperfect Metals. This is that Charutz, that sharp pointed (or pene- trating) thing; which Job, c. 41, v. 30, says ought to be cast upon Clay, i.e., imperfect Metals, that hath Cohach, Power to produce Gold: for Tit ,and Cohach31 are of equal Numbers. And make it to boil like a deep pot, a Sea of thick Metallic Waters ; and it shall become like a Vessel of Paint : But after that it shall make the Path to shine, v. 31-32. Blessed be the Name of the Glory of his Kingdom for ever and ever. I write these things, I the insignificant one, according to my slender knowledge, who have earnestly sought out secret things, to the healing of all Creatures. But that which moved me thereto is spoken in Sohar Hezsinu, fol. 145, cap. 580, concerning the Office of a Physician, that I should not desist from the good and right Way ilntil I should find the best Medicine : And the Words are these ; It is written, Deut., c. 32, V. 10, \"He found him in Desert land and in the waste howling Wilderness ; he led him to find the causes, and made him understand and kept him as the apple of his eye. And rightly be- cause he hath compelled all the Cortices to serve him.\" Thus far was it written in the Book of Kartanaeus the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Physician. And then he drew from this Text various Observations necessary to a wise Physician about the Cure of the Patient, lying in the Chamber of sickness, Genesis, c. 39, v. 20, where the Captives of the King may worship the Lord of the World. For when a prudent Physician comes, he finds him in the Land of the Desert, and in the Wilderness of the Howling Solitude, which are as the Diseases afflicting him, and finds him in the Captivity of the King. Here it may be objected that it is not lawful to cure him, because the Holy One, Who is Blessed for ever, hath caused him to be ill and as if a captive. But this is not so ; for David says, Psalm 41, v. 2, \" Blessed is hk who considereth (the curing of) the poor : the Lord will preserve him and keep him alive.\" For he is poor who lies in the House of Sickness ; and if the Physician be wise that Holy One, who is blessed for ever, loads him with Blessings, in reference to him, whom he cures. That Physician finds him in the Land of the Desert, that is ill, etc. And what is to be done for him ; Rabbi Eleasar hath told us : Hitherto we have heard nothing of that Physician, nor of his Book ; ex- cept that once a certain Merchant told me that he heard his Father say, that in his time there was a certain Physician, who having seen a Patient, presently said, i6 this one will live and that one will die \" ; and that it was reported of him, that he was a just and true Man fearing Sin; and that, if any Man could not procure those things he needed, he would buy then1 for him, and freely supply his necessities ; and that it was said, there was not so nice a Man in the whole World, and that he did more with his Prayers, than with his Hands. And when we supposed this Man to be the very same Phy- sician, the Merchant made reply, Certainly his Book is in my Hands, having been left to me as an Inheri- tance by my Father ; and all the Sayings of that Book are hidden in the Mystery of the Law : And in it we"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"do find profound Secrets, and many Medicines ; which notwithstanding, is not lawful to apply to any, except to him that feareth Sin, etc. Rabbi Eleasar said, Lend it to me. He replied, I will, so as to shew to you the Power of the Sacred Light. And you have heard (said Rabbi Eleasar) that Book was in my Hands twelve months, and we found in it sublime and precious Lights, etc., and we have found in it various sorts of Medicines, ordered according to the Prescriptions of the Law, and the profound Secrets, etc. And we said, Blessed be the Holy and Merciful One, Who bestoweth a share of Wisdom upon Men from the Supernal Wis- dom. Thus far here. These things moved me to seek the like good and secret Books ; and from the good Hand of my God I found that which I now teach to thee. And the Camea31 of this ;Metal is altogether wonderful, for it consists of six times six Partitions, everywhere wonderfully shew- ing the Virtue of the Letter V~U,~~ related to Tiphereth. And all the Columns and Lines, as well from the bottom to the top, as from the right to the left, and from one Angle to another, give the same Sum ; and thou mayest vary the same ad in$lzitzwz. And the various totals always observe this principle, that their lesser Number is always 3, 9, or 6 ; and again, 3, g or 6 ; and so on. Concerning which I could reveal many things to thee. Now I add this Example, which shows as the total of a line the number 216 of Arjeh33 our wonderful Lion, 14 times, which is the Name Zahab, Gold.

Silver is also found allotted to each one of the Sephirotic Decad, thus see the c. 38 of Exodus, v. 17 and 19, where Silver forms the Chapiters of the Pillars representing Kether or the summit.
