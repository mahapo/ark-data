[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"The Chaldæan OraclesAttributed To ZoroasterPreface by Sapere AudeTHESE Oracles are considered to embody many of the principal features of Chaldæan philosophy. They have come down tous through Greek translations and were held in the greatest esteem throughout antiquity, a sentiment which was shared alikeby the early Christian Fathers and the later Platonists. The doctrines contained therein are attributed to Zoroaster through towhich particular Zoroaster is not known; historians give notices of as many as six different individuals all bearing that name,which was probably the title of the Prince of the Magi, and a generic term. The word Zoroaster is by various authoritiesdifferently derived: Kircher furnishes one of the most interesting derivations when he seeks to show that it comes fromTzURA = a figure, and TzIUR = to fashion, ASH = fire, and STR = hidden; from these he gets the words Zairaster =fashioning images of hidden fire;—or Tzuraster = the image of secret things. Others derive it from Chaldee and Greek wordsmeaning \"a contemplator of the Stars.\"It is not, of course, pretended that this collection as it stands is other than disjointed and fragmentary, and it is more thanprobable that the true sense of many passages has been obscured, and even in some cases hopelessly obliterated, byinadequate translation.Where it has been possible to do so, an attempt has been made to, elucidate doubtful or ambiguous expressions, either bymodifying the existing translation from the Greek, where deemed permissible, or by appending annotations.It has been suggested by some that these Oracles are of Greek invention, but it has already been pointed out by Stanley thatPicus de Mirandula assured Ficinus that he had the Chaldee Original in his possession, \"in which those things which are faultyand defective in the Greek are read perfect and entire,\" and Ficinus indeed states that he found this MS. upon the death ofMirandula. In addition to this, it should be noted that here and there in the original Greek version, words occur which are notof Greek extraction at all, but are Hellenised Chaldee. Berosus is said to be the first who introduced the writings of theChaldæans concerning Astronomy and Philosophy among the Greeks,* and it is certain that the traditions of Chaldea verylargely influenced Greek thought. Taylor considers that some of these mystical utterances are the sources whence the sublimeconceptions of Plate were formed, and large commentaries were written upon them by Porphyry, Iamblichus, Proclus, Plethoand Psellus. That men of such great learning and sagacity should have thought so highly of these Oracles, is a fact which initself should commend then to our attention.The term \"Oracles\" was probably bestowed upon these epigrammatic utterances in order to enforce the idea of their profoundand deeply mysterious nature. The Chaldæans, however, had an Oracle, which they venerated as highly as the Greeks did thatat Delphi.\"**We are indebted to both Psellus and Pletho, for comments at some length upon the Chaldaen Oracles, and the collectionadduced by these writers has been considerably enlarged by Franciscus Patricius, who made many additions from Proclus,Hermias, Simplicius, Damascius, Synesius, Olympiodorus, Nicephorus and Arnobius; his collection, which comprised some324 oracles under general heads, was published in Latin in 1593, and constitutes the groundwork of the later classificationarrived at by Taylor and Cory; all of these editions have been utilized in producing the present revise.A certain portion of these Oracles collected by Psellus, appear to be correctly attributed to a Chaldæan Zoroaster of very earlydate, and are marked \"Z,\" following the method indicated by Taylor, with one or two exceptions. Another portion is attributedto a sect of philosophers named Theurgists, who flourished during the reign of Marcus Antoninus, upon the authority ofProclus,*** and these are marked \"T.\" Oracles additional to these two series and of less definite source are marked \"Z or T.\"Other oracular passages from miscellaneous authors are indicated by their names.The printed copies of the Oracles to be found in England are the following:—1.Oracula Magica , Ludovicus Tiletanus, Paris, 1563.2.Zoroaster et ejus 320 oracula Chaldaica; by Franciscus Patricius... 1593. 3.Fred.

O.It has been believed by many, and not without good reason, that these terse and enigmatic utterances enshrine a profoundsystem of mystical philosophy, but that this system demands for its full discernment a refinement of faculty, involving, as itdoes, a discrete perception of immaterial essences.It has been asserted that the Chaldæan magi* preserved their occult learning among their race by continual tradition fromFather to Son. Diodorus says: \"They learn these things, not after the same fashion as the Greeks: for amongst the Chaldæans,philosophy is delivered by tradition in the family, the Son receiving it from his Father, being exempted from all otheremployment; and thus having their parents for their teachers, they learn all things fully and abundantly, believing more firmlywhat is communicated to them.\"**The remains then of this oral tradition seems to exist in these Oracles, which should be studied in the light of the Kabalah andof Egyptian Theology. Students are aware that the Kabalah*** is susceptible of extraordinary interpretation with the aid of theTarot, resuming as the latter does, the very roots of Egyptian Theology. Had a similar course been adopted by commentatorsin the past, the Chaldæan system expounded in these Oracles would not have been distorted in the way it has been.The foundation upon which the whole structure of the Hebrew Kabalah rests is an exposition of ten deific powers successivelyemanated by the Illimitable Light which in their varying dispositions are considered as the key of all things. This divineprocession in the form of Three Triads of Powers, synthesized in a tenth, is said to be extended through four worlds,denominated respectively Atziluth, Briah, Yetzirah and Assiah, a fourfold gradation from the subtil to the gross. Thisproposition in its metaphysical roots is pantheistic, though, if it may be so stated, mediately theistic; while the ultimatenoumenon of all phenomena is the absolute Deity, whose ideation constitutes the objective Universe.Now these observations apply strictly also to the Chaldæan system.The accompanying diagrams sufficiently indicate the harmony and identity of the Chaldæan philosophy with the HebrewKabalah. It will be seen that the First Mind and the Intelligible Triad, Pater, Potentia, or Mater, and Mens, are allotted to theIntelligible World of Supramundane Light: the \"First Mind\" represents the archetypal intelligence as an entity in the bosom ofthe Paternal Depth. This concentrates by reflection into the \"Second Mind\" representative of the Divine Power in theEmpyraean World which is identified with the second great Triad of divine powers, known as the Intelligible and at the sametime Intellectual Triad: the Æthereal World comprises the dual third Triad denominated Intellectual: while the fourth or2 of 13"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Elementary World is governed by Hypezokos, or Flower of Fire, the actual builder of the world.

The Second was conceived to be that mode of being havingbeginning but no end; the Creative World or Empyræum falls under this head, abounding as it does in productions, but itssource remaining superior to these. The third and last order of divine things had a beginning in time and will end, this is thetransitory Ethereal World. Seven spheres extended through these three Worlds, viz., one in the Empyræum or verging from it,three in the Ethereal and three in the Elementary Worlds, while the whole physical realm synthesized the foregoing. Theseseven spheres are not to be confounded with the Seven material Planets; although the latter are the physical representatives ofthe former, which can only be said to be material in the metaphysical sense of the term. Psellus professed to identify them buthis suggestions are inadequate as Stanley pointed out. But Stanley, although disagreeing with Psellus, is neverthelessinconsistent upon this point, for although he explains the four Worlds of the Chaldæans as successively noumenal to thephysical realm, he obviously contradicts this in saying that one corporeal world is in the Empyræum.Prior to the supramundane Light lay the \"Paternal Depth,\" the Absolute Deity, containing all things \"in potentia\" and eternallyimmanent. This is analogous to the Ain Suph Aur of the Kabalah, three triads of three letters, expressing three triads ofPowers, which are subsequently translated into objectivity, and constitute the great Triadic Law under the direction of theDemiurgus, or artificer of the Universe.In considering this schema, it must be remembered that the supramundane Light was regarded as the primal radiation from thePaternal Depth and the archetypal noumenon of the Empyræum, a universal, all-pervading—and, to humancomprehension—ultimate essence. The Empyræum again, is a somewhat grosser though still highly subtilized Fire andcreative source, in its turn the noumenon of the Formative or Ethereal World, as the latter is the noumenon of the ElementaryWorld. Through these graduated media the conceptions of the Paternal Mind are ultimately fulfilled in time and space.In some respects it is probable that the Oriental mind today is not much altered from what it was thousands of years ago, andmuch that now appears to us curious and phantastic in Eastern traditions, still finds responsive echo in the hearts and minds ofa vast portion of mankind. A large number of thinkers and scientists in modern times have advocated tenets which, while notexactly similar, are parallel, to ancient Chaldæan conceptions; this is exemplified in the notion that the operation of naturallaw in the Universe is controlled or operated by conscious and discriminating power which is co-ordinate with intelligence. Itis but one step further to admit that forces are entities, to people the vast spaces of the Universe with the children of phantasy.Thus history repeats itself, and the old and the new alike reflect the multiform truth.Without entering at length into the metaphysical aspect, it is important to notice the supremacy attributed to the \"PaternalMind.\" The intelligence of the Universe, poetically described as \"energising before energy,\" establishes on high theprimordial types or patterns of things which are to be, and, then inscrutably latent, vests the development of these in theRectores Mundorum, the divine Regents or powers already referred to. As it is said, \"Mind is with Him, Power with them.\"The word \"Intelligible\" is used in the Platonic sense, to denote a mode of being, power or perception, transcendingintellectual comprehension, i.e., wholly distinct from, and superior to, ratiocination. The Chaldæans recognised three modesof perception, viz., the testimony of the various senses, the ordinary processes of intellectual activity, and the intelligibleconceptions before referred to. Each of these operations is distinct from the others, and, moreover, conducted in separatematrices, or vehicula. The anatomy of the Soul was, however, carried much farther than this, and, although in its ultimateradix recognised as identical with the divinity, yet in manifested being it was conceived to be highly complex. The Oraclesspeak of the \"Paths of the Soul,\" the tracings of inflexible fire by which its essential parts are associated in integrity; while itsvarious \"summits,\" \"fountains,\" and \"vehicula,\" are all traceable by analogy with universal principles. This latter fact is,5 of 13"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"indeed, not the least remarkable feature of the Chaldæan system. Like several of the ancient cosmogonies, the principalcharacteristic of which seems to have been a certain adaptability to introversion, Chaldæan metaphysics synthesize mostclearly in the human constitution.In each of the Chaldæan Divine Worlds a trinity of divine powers operated, which synthetically constituted a fourth term. \"Inevery World,\" says the Oracle, \"a Triad shineth, of which; the Monad is the ruling principle.\" These \"Monads\" are the divineVice-gerents by which the Universe was conceived to be administered. Each of the four Worlds, viz., the Empyræan, Ethereal,Elementary and Material, was presided over by a Supreme Power, itself in direct rapport with \"the Father\" and \"moved byunspeakable counsels.\" These are clearly identical with the Kabalistic conception of the presidential heads of the four letterscomposing the Deity name in so many different languages. A parallel tenet is conveyed in the Oracle which runs: \"There is aVenerable Name projected through the Worlds with a sleepless revolution.\" The Kabalah again supplies the key to thisutterance, by regarding the Four Worlds as under the presidency of the four letters of the Venerable Name, a certain letter oftile four being allotted to each World, as also was a special mode of writing the four lettered name appropriate thereto; and,indeed in that system it is taught that the order of the Elements, both macrocosmic and microcosmic, on every plane, isdirectly controlled by the \"revolution of the name.\" That Name is associated with the Æthers of the Elements and is thusconsidered as a Universal Law; it is the power which marshals the creative host, summed up in the Demiurgus, Hypezokos, orFlower of Fire.Reference may here be made to the psychic anatomy of the human being according to Plato. He places the intellect in thehead; the Soul endowed with some of the passions, such as fortitude, in the heart; while another Soul, of which the appetites,desires and grosser passions are its faculties, about the stomach and the spleen.So, the Chaldæan doctrine as recorded by Psellus, considered man to be composed of three kinds of Souls, which mayrespectively be called:First, the Intelligible, or divine soul,Second, the Intellect or rational soul, andThird, the Irrational, or passional soul.This latter was regarded as subject to mutation, to be dissolved and perish at the death of the body.Of the Intelligible, or divine soul, the Oracles teach that \"It is a bright fire, which, by the power of the Father, remainethimmortal, and is Mistress of Life;\" its power may be dimly apprehended through regenerate phantasy and when the sphere ofthe Intellect has ceased to respond to the images of the passional nature.Concerning the rational soul, the Chaldæans taught that it was possible for it to assimilate itself unto the divinity on the onehand, or the irrational soul on the other. \"Things divine,\" we read, \"cannot be obtained by mortals whose intellect is directedto the body alone, but those only who are stripped of their garments, arrive at the summit.\"To the three Souls to which reference has been made, the Chaldæans moreover allotted three distinct vehicles: that of thedivine Soul was immortal, that: of the rational soul by approximation became so; while to the irrational soul was allotted whatwas called \"the image,\" that is, the astral form of the physical body.Physical life thus integrates three special modes of activity, which upon the dissolution of the body are respectively involvedin the web of fate consequent upon incarnate energies in three different destinies.The Oracles urge men to devote themselves to things divine, and not to give way to the promptings of the irrational soul, for,to such as fail herein, it is significantly said, \"Thy vessel the beasts of the earth shall inhabit.\"The Chaldæans assigned the place of the Image, the vehicle of the irrational soul, to the Lunar Sphere; it is probable that bythe Lunar Sphere was meant something more than the orb of the Moon, the whole sublunary region, of which the terrestrialearth is, as it were, the centre. At death, the rational Soul rose above the lunar influence, provided always the past permittedthat happy release, Great importance was attributed to the way in which the physical life was passed during the sojourn of theSoul in the tenement of flesh, and frequent are the exhortations to rise to communion with those Divine powers, to whichnought but the highest Theurgy can pretend.\"Let the immortal depth of your Soul lead you,\" says an Oracle, \"but earnestly raise your eyes upwards.\" Taylor commentsupon this in the following beautiful passage: \"By the eyes are to be understood all the gnostic powers of the Soul, for when6 of 13"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"these are extended the Soul becomes replete. with a more excellent life and divine illumination; and is, as it were, raisedabove itself.\"Of the Chaldæan Magi it might be truly said that they \"among dreams did first discriminate the truthful vision!\" for they werecertainly endowed with a far reaching perception both mental and spiritual; attentive to images, and fired with mysticfervours, they mere something more than mere theorists, but were also practical exemplars of the philosophy they taught. Lifeon the plains of Chaldæa, with its mild nights and jewelled skies, tended to foster the interior unfoldment; in early life thedisciples of the Magi learnt to resolve the Bonds of proscription and enter the immeasurable region. One Oracle assures usthat, \"The girders of the Soul, which give her; breathing, are easy to be unloosed,\" and elsewhere we read of the \"Melody ofthe Ether\" and of the \"Lunar clashings,\" experiences which testify to the reality of their occult methods.The Oracles assert that the impressions of characters and other divine visions appear in the Ether. The Chaldæan philosophyrecognized the ethers of the Elements as the subtil media through which the operation of the grosser elements is effected—bythe grosser elements I mean what we know as Earth, Air, Water and Fire—the principles of dryness and moisture, of heat andcold. These subtil ethers are really the elements of the ancients, and seem at an early period to have been connected with theChaldæan astrology, as the signs of the Zodiac were connected with them. The twelve signs of the Zodiac are permutations ofthe ethers of the elements—four elements with three variations each; and according to the preponderance of one or anotherelemental condition in the constitution of the individual, so were his natural inclinations deduced therefrom, Thus when in theastrological jargon it was said that a man had Aries rising, he was said to be of a fiery nature, his natural tendencies beingactive, energetic and fiery, for in the constitution of such a one the fiery ether predominates. And these ethers were stimulated,or endowed with a certain kind of vibration, by their Presidents, the Planets; these latter being thus suspended in orderlydisposed zones. Unto the Planets, too, colour and sound were also attributed; the planetary colours are connected with theethers, and each of the Planetary forces was said to have special dominion over, or affinity with, one or other of the Zodiacalconstellations. Communion with the hierarchies of these constellations formed part of the Chaldæan theurgy, and in a curiousfragment it is said: \"If thou often invokest it\" (the celestial constellation called the Lion) \"then when no longer is Visible untothee the Vault of the Heavens, when the Stars have lost their light the lamp of the Moon is veiled, the Earth abideth not, andaround thee darts the lightning flame, then all things will appear to thee in the form of a Lion!\" The Chaldæans, like theEgyptians, appear to have had a highly developed appreciation of colours, an evidence of their psychic susceptibility. The useof bright colours engenders the recognition of subsisting variety and stimulates that perception of the mind which energizesthrough imagination, or the operation of images. The Chaldæan method of contemplation appears to have been to identify theself with the object of contemplation; this is of course identical with the process of Indian Yoga, and is an idea which appearsreplete with suggestion; as it is written \"He assimilates the images to himself casting them around his own form.\" But we aretold, \"All divine natures are incorporeal, but bodies are bound in them for your sakes.\"The subtil ethers, of which I have spoken, served is their turn as it were for the garment of the divine Light; for the Oraclesteach that beyond these again \"A solar world and endless Light subsist!\" This Divine Light was the object of all veneration.Do not think that what was intended thereby was the Solar Light we know: \"The inerratic sphere of the Starless above\" is anunmistakable expression and therein \"the more true Sun\" has place: Theosophists will appreciate the significance of \"the moretrue Sun,\" for according to The Secret Doctrine the Sun we see is but the physical vehicle of a more transcendent splendour.Some strong Souls were able to reach up to the Light by their own power: \"The mortal who approaches the fire shall haveLight from the divinity, and unto the persevering mortal the blessed immortals are swift.\" But what of those of a lesserstature? Were they, by inability, precluded from such illumination? \"Others,\" we read, \"even when asleep, He makes fruitfulfrom his own Strength.\" That is to say, some men acquire divine knowledge through communion with Divinity in sleep. Thisidea has given rise to some of the most magnificent contributions to later literature; it has since been thoroughly elaborated byPorphyry and Synesius. The eleventh Book of the Metamorphoses of Apuleius and the Vision of Scipio ably vindicate this;and, although no doubt every Christian has beard that \"He giveth unto his beloved in sleep,\" few, indeed, realise thepossibility underlying that conception.What, it may be asked, were the views of the Chaldæans with respect to terrestrial life: Was it a spirit of pessimism, which ledthem to hold this in light: esteem? Or, should we not rather say that the keynote of their philosophy was an immense spiritualoptimism? It appeals to me that the latter is the more true interpretation. They realised that beyond the confines of matter lay amore perfect existence, a truer realm of which terrestrial administration is but a too often travestied reflection. They sought, aswe seek now, the Good, the Beautiful and the True, but they did not hasten to the Outer in the thirst for sensation, but with afiner perception realised the true Utopia to be within.And the first step in that admirable progress was a return to the simple life; hardly, indeed, a return, for most of the Magi werethus brought up from birth.\" **** The hardihood engendered by the rugged life, coupled with that wisdom which directedtheir association, rendered these children of Nature peculiarly receptive of Nature's Truths. \"Stoop not down,\" says theOracle, \"to the darkly splendid World, For a precipice lieth beneath the Earth, a descent of seven steps, and therein is7 of 13"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"established the throne of an evil and fatal force. Stoop not down unto that darkly splendid world, Defile not thy brilliant flamewith the earthly dress of matter, Stoop not down for its splendour is but seeming, It is but the habitation of the Sons of theUnhappy.\" No more beautiful formulation of the Great Truth that the exterior and sensuous life is death to the highestenergies of the Soul could possibly have been uttered: but to such as by purification and the practice of virtue renderedthemselves worthy, encouragement was given, for, we read, \"The Higher powers build up the body of the holy man.\"The law of Karma was as much a feature of the Chaldæan philosophy as it is of the Theosophy of today: from a passage inFicinus, we read, \"The Soul perpetually runs and passes through all things in a certain space of time, which being performed itis presently compelled to pass back again through all things and unfold a similar web of generation in the World, according toZoroaster, who thinks that as often as the same causes return, the same effects will in like manner return.\"This is of course the explanation of the proverb that \"History repeats itself\" and is very far from the superstitious view of fate.Here each one receives his deserts according to merit or demerit, and these are the bonds of life; but the Oracles say, \"Enlargenot thy destiny,\" and they urge men to \"Explore the River of the Soul, so that although you have become a servant to body,you may again rise to the Order from which you descended, joining works to sacred reason!\"To this end we are commended to learn the Intelligible which exists beyond the mind, that divine portion of the being whichexists beyond Intellect: and this it is only possible to grasp with the flower of the mind. \"Understand the intelligible with theextended flame of an extended intellect.\" To Zoroaster also was attributed the utterance \"who knows himself knows all thingsin himself;\" while it is elsewhere suggested that \"The paternal Mind has sowed symbols in the Soul,\" But such pricelessknowledge was possible only to the Theurgists Who, we are told, \"fall not so as to be ranked with the herd that are insubjection to fate.\" The divine light cannot radiate in an imperfect microcosm, even as the Clouds obscure the Sun; for of suchas make ascent to the most divine of speculations in a confused and disordered manner, with unhallowed lips, or unwashedfeet, the progressions are imperfect, the impulses are vain and the paths are dark.Although destiny, our destiny, may be \"written in the Stars\" yet it was the mission of the divine Soul to raise the human Soulabove the circle of necessity, and the Oracles give Victory to that Masterly Will, which\"Hews the wall with might of magic,Breaks the palisade in pieces,Hews to atoms seven pickets ...Speaks the Master words of knowledge!\"The means taken to that consummation consisted in the training of the Will and the elevation of the imagination, a divinepower which controls consciousness: \"Relieve yourself to be above body, and you are,\" says the Oracle; it might have added\"Then shall regenerate phantasy disclose the symbols of the Soul.\" But it is said \"On beholding yourself fear!\" i.e., theimperfect self.Everything must be viewed as ideal by him who would understand the ultimate perfection.Will is the grand agent in the mystic progress; its rule is all potent over the nervous system. By Will the fleeting vision isfixed on tile treacherous waves of the astral Light; by Will the consciousness is impelled to commune with the divinity: vetthere is not One Will, but three Wills—the Wills, namely, of the Divine, the Rational and Irrational Souls—to harmonizethese is the difficulty.It is selfishness which impedes the radiation of Thought, and attaches to body. This is scientifically true and irrespective ofsentiment, the selfishness which reaches beyond the necessities of body is pure vulgarity.A picture which to the cultured eye beautifully portrays a given subject, nevertheless appears to the savage a confusedpatchwork of streaks, so the extended perceptions of a citizen of the Universe are not grasped by those whose thoughts dwellwithin the sphere of the personal life.The road to the Summum Bonum lies therefore through self-sacrifice, the sacrifice of the lower to the higher, for behind thatHigher Self lies the concealed form of the Antient of Days, the synthetical Being of Divine Humanity.These things are grasped by Soul; the song of the Soul is alone heard in the adytum of God-nourished Silence!8 of 13"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"___________________________ NOTES:* This powerful Guild was the guardian of Chaldæan philosophy, which exceeded the bounds of their country, and diffuseditself into Persia and Arabia that borders upon it; for which reason the learning of the Chaldæans, Persians and Arabians iscomprehended under the general title of Chaldæan.**Diodorus, lib.
