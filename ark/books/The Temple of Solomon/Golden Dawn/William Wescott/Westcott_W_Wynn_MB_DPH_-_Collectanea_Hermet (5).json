Where it has been possible to do so, an attempt has. been made to elucidate doubtful or anlbiguous ex- pressions, either by modifying the existing transla- tion from the Greek, where deemed permissible, or by appending annotations. It has been suggested by some that these Oracles are of Greek invention, but it has already been pointed out by Stanley that Picus de Mirandula assured Ficinus that he had the Chaldee Original in his possession, \" in which those things which are faulty and defective in the Greek are read perfect and entire,\" and Ficinus indeed states that he found this MS. upon the death of Mirandula. In addition to this, it should be noted that here and there in the original Greek version, words occur which are not of Greek extraction at all, but are Hellenised Chaldee. Berosus is said to be the first who introduced the writings of the Chald~ans concerning Astronomy and Philosophy anlong the Greeks,\" and it is certain that the traditions of Chaldea very largely influenced Greek thought. Taylor considers that some of these xnystical utterances are the sources whence the sublime conceptions of Plato were formed, and large conmen- taries were written upon them by Porphyry, Iani- blichus, Proclus, Pletho and Psellus. That men of such great learning and sagacity should have thought so highly of these Oracles, is a fact which in itself should conimend them to our attention."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The term \" Oracles \" was probably bestowed upon these epigrammatic utterances in order to enforce the idea of their profound and deeply mysterious nature. The Chaldzans, however, had an Oracle, which they venerated as highly as the Greeks did that at Delphi.\" We are indebted to both Psellus and Pletho, for comments at some length upon the Chaldzan Oracles, and the collection adduced by these writers has been considerably enlarged by Franciscus Patricius, who made many additions from Proclus, Herniias, Sim- plicius, Damascius, Synesius, Olyinpiodorus, Nice- phorus and Arnobius ; his collection, which corn- prised some 324 oracles under general heads, was published in Latin in 1593, and constitutes the groundwork of the later classification arrived at by TayIor and Cory ; all of these editions have been utilised in producing the present revise. A certain portion of these Oracles collected by Psellus, appear to be correctly attributed to a Chal- daeari Zoroaster of very early date, and are marked \" 2,\" following the method indicated by Taylor, with one or two exceptions. Another portion is attributed to a sect of philosophers named Theurgists, who flourished during the reign of Marcus Antoninus, upon the authority of Proclus,t and these are marked 4, T.\" Oracles additional to these two series and of less definite source are marked \" Z or T.\" Other oracular passages from miscellaneous authors are indicated by their names. * Stephanus, De Urbibus. t Vide his Scholia on the C??at'yhs of Plato."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The printed copies of the Oracles to be found in England are the following :- I.

It has been asserted that the Chaldaxn Magis pre- served their occult learning among their race by continual tradition from Father to Son. Diodorus says : \" They learn these things, not after the same fashion as the Greeks: for anlongst the Chald~ans, philosophy is delivered by tradition in the family, the Son receiving it from his Father, being exempted from all other employment; and thus having their parents for their teachers, they learn all things fully and abundantly, believing more firmly what is com- municated to them.\"f- The remains then of this oral tradition seems to exist in these Oracles, which should be studied in the light of the Kabalah and of Egyptian Theology.

Had a similar course been adopted by commentators in the past, the Chaldaean systein expounded in these Oracles would not have been distorted in the way it has been. The foundation upon which the whole structure of the Hebrew ~abalih rests is an exposition of ten deific powers successively emanated by the Illimitable Light, which in their varying dispositions are con- sidered as the key of all things. This divine pro- cession in the form of Three Triads of Powers, synthesized in a tenth, is said to be extended through four worlds, denominated respectively Atziluth, Briah, Yetzirah and Assiah, a fourfold gradation from the subtil to the gross. This proposition in its meta- physical roots is pantheistic, though, if it may be so stated, mediately theistic; while the ulti- mate nounienon of all phenomena is the absolute Deity, whose ideation constitutes the objective Universe. Now these observations apply strictly also to the Chaldzean system. The accompanying diagrams sufficiently indicate the harmony and identity of the Chaldaean philosophy with the Hebrew Kabalah. It will be seen that the First Mind and the Intelli&%le Triad, Pater, Potentia, or Mater, and Mens, are allotted to the Intelligible World of Supramundane Light : the \" First Mind \" represents the archetypal intelligence as an entity in the bosom of the Paternal Depth. This concentrates by reflection into the \" Second Mind \" representative of the Divine Power in the Empyrzan World which is identified with the second great Triad of divine powers, known as the Inkdligidk and at th~ same time htellectual Triad : the athereal World comprises the dual third Triad denominated Intellectual: while the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"fourth or Elementary World is governed by Hppezokos, or Flower of Fire, the actual builder of the world.

The Second was conceived to be that mode of being having beginning but no end ; the Creative World or Empy- raturn falls under this head, abounding as it does in productions, but its source remaining superior to these. The third and last order of divine things had a beginning in time and will end, this is the transitory Ethereal World. Seven spheres extended through these three Worlds, viz., one in the E)inpyrzuni or"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"verging from it, three in the Ethereal and three in the Elementary Worlds, while the whole physical realm synthesized the foregoing. These seven spheres are not to be confounded with the Seven material Planets ; although the latter are the physical representatives of the former, which can on1y be said to be material in the metaphysical sense of the term. Psellus professed to identify them bt~t his suggestions are inadequate as Stanley pointed out. But Stanley, although dis- agreeing with Psellus, is nevertheless inconsistent upon this point, for although he explains the four Worlds of the Chaldzans as successively noumenal to the physical realm, he obviously contradicts this in saying that one coqbowal world is in the Empyrzeum. Prior to the supramundane Light lay the \" Paternal Depth,\" the Absolute Deity, containing all things '' in flokwtia \" and eternally immanent. This is analogous to the Ain Suph Aur of the Kabalah, three words of three letters, expressing three triads of Powers, which are subsequently translated into objec- tivity, and constitute the great Triadic Law under the direction of the Demiurgus, or artificer of the Universe. In considering this schema, it must be remembered that the supramundane Light was regarded as the primal radiation from the Paternal Depth and the archetypal nounlenon of the Empyr~urn, a universal, all-pervading-and, to human comprehension-ulti- mate essence. The Enlpyram again, is a somewhat grosser though still highly subtilized Fire and creative source, in its turn the noumenon of the Formative or Ethereal World, as the latter is the noumenon of the Zlementary World. Through these graduated media the conceptions of the Paternal Mind are ultimately fulfilled in time and space. In some respects it is probable that the Oriental mind to-day is not much altered from what it was"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"thousands of years ago, and niuch that now appears to us curious and phantastic in Eastern traditions, still finds responsive echo in the hearts and minds of a vast portion of mankind. A large number of thinkers and scientists in modern times have advocated tenets which, while not exactly similar, are parallel to ancient Chaldzan conceptions ; this is exeinplified in the notion that the operation of natural law in the Universe is controlled or operated by conscious and discriminating power which is co-ordinate with intelligence. It is but one step further to admit that forces are entities, to people the vast spaces of the Universe with the children of phantasy. Thus history repeats itself, and the old and the new alike reflect the multiform truth. Withotlt entering at length into the metaphysical aspect, it is important to notice the supremacy attri- buted to the \" Paternal Mind.\" The intelligence of the Universe, poetically described as \" energising before energy,\" establishes on high the primordial types or patterns of things which are to be, and, then inscrutably latent, vests the development of these in the Rccfores M~~zdo~unz, the divine Regents or powers already referred to. As it is said, \"Mind is with Him, power with them.\" The word \" Intelligible\" is used in the Platonic sense, to denote a mode of being, power or perception, transcending intellectual comprehension, i.e., wholly distinct from, and superior to, ratiocination. The Chaldzeans recognised three modes of perception, viz., the testimony of the various senses, the ordinary pro- cesses of intellectual activity, and the intelligible conceptions before referred to. Each of these opera- tions is distinct from the others, and, moreover, conducted in separate matrices, or vehicula. The anatomy of the Soul was, however, carried niuch farther than this, and, although in its ultimate radix"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"recognised as identical with the divinity, yet in manifested being it was conceived to be highly corn- plex. The Oracles speak of the \" Paths of the Soul,\" the tracings of inflexible fire by which its essential parts are associated in integrity ; while its various '' summits,\" \" fou~~tains,\" and \" vehicula,\" are all traceable by analogy with universal principles. This latter fact is, indeed, not the least remarkable feature of the Chald~ean system. Like several of the ancient cosnlogonies, the principal characteristic of which seems to have been a certain adaptability to intro- version, Chaldaean metaph>-sics syntl~esize most clearly in the human constitution. In each of the Chaldzan Divine Worlds a trinity of divine powers operated, which synthetically con- stituted a fourth term. \" In every World,\" says the Oracle, \" a Triad shineth, of which the Monad is the ruling principle.\" These \" Monads \" are the divine Vice-gerents by which the Universe was conceived to be administered. Each of the four Worlds, zix., the Empy raean, Ethereal, Elementary and Material, was presided over by a Supreme Power, itself in direct ~a#$ort with \" the Father\" and \" moved by unspeak- able counsels.\" These are clearly identical with the Kabalistic conception of the presidential heads of the four letters conlposing the Deity name in so many different languages. A parallel tenet is conveyed in the Oracle which runs: \" There is a Venerable Name projected through the I%Torlds with a sleepless revolu- tion.\" The Kabalah again supplies the key to this utterance, by regarding the Four Worlds as under the presidency of the four letters of the Venerable Name, a certain letter of the four being allotted to each World, as also was a special mode of writii~g the four- lettered name appropriate thereto ; and, indeed in that system it is taught that the order of the Elements, both rnacrocosn~ic and nlicrocosmic, on every plane,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"is directly controlled by the \"revolution of the name.\" That Name is associated with the athers of the Elements and is thus considered as a Universal Law; it is the power which marshals the creative host, summed up in the Demiurgus, Hypezokos, or Flower of Fire. Reference may here be made to the psychic anatomy of the human being according to Plato. He places the intellect in the head; the Soul endowed with some of the passions, such as fortitude, in the heart ; while another Soul, of which the appetites, desires and grosser passions are its faculties, about the stomach and the spleen. So, the Chaldzan doctrine as recorded by Psellus, considered man to be composed of three kinds of Souls, which may respectively be called : First, the Intelligible, or divine soul, Second, the Intellect or rational soul, and Third, the Irrational, or passional soul. This latter was regarded as subject to mutation, to be dissolved and perish at the death of the body. Of the Intelligible, or divine soul, the Oracles teach that \" It is a bright fire, which, by the power of the Father, reniaineth immortal, and is Mistress of Life ; \" its power may be dimly apprehended through regene- rate phantasy and when the sphere of the Intellect has ceased to respond to the images of the passional nature. Concerning the rational soul, the Chaldzeans taught that it was possible for it to assimilate itself unto the divinity on the one hand, or the irrational soul on the other. \"Things divine,\" we read, \"cannot be obtained by mortals whose intellect is directed to the body alone, but those only who are stripped of their gar- ments, arrive at the sunlinit,\" To the three Souls to which reference has been made, the Chaldaeans moreover allotted three distinct"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"vehicles: that of the divine Soul was inmortal, that of the rational soul by approximation became so; while to the irrational soul was allotted what was called \"the image,\" that is, the astral form of the physical body. Physical life thus integrates three special modes of activity, which upon the dissolution of the body are respectively involved in the web of fate consequent upon incarnate energies in three different destinies. The Oracles urge men to devote themselves to things divine, and not to give way to the promptings of the irrational soul, for, to such as fail herein, it is significantly said, \"Thy vessel the beasts of the earth shall inhabit.\" The Chald~ans assigned the place of the Image, the vehicle of the irrational soul, to the Lunar Sphere; it is probable that by the Lunar Sphere was meant something more than the orb of the Moon, the whole sublunary region, of which the terrestrial earth is, as it were, the centre. At death, the rational Sot11 rose above the lunar influence, provided always the past permitted that happy release. Great iniportance was attributed to the way in which the physical life was passed during the sojourn of the Soul in the tene- ment of flesh, and frequent are the exhortations to rise to conimunion with those Divine powers, to which nought but the highest Theurgy can pretend. \"Let the immortal depth of your Soul lead you,\" says an Oracle, \"but earnestly raise your eyes upwards.\" Taylor conlnients upon this in the following beautiful passage : \"By the eyes are to be understood all the gnostic powers of the Soul, for when these are extended the Soul becomes replete with a more excellent life and divine illumination; and is, as it were, raised above itself.\" Of the Chaldzean Magi it might be truly said that they \"among dreams did first discriminate the truth-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"ful vision!\" for they were certainly endowed with a far reaching perception both mental and spiritual; attentive to images, and fired with mystic fervours, they were something more than mere theorists, but were also practical exemplars of the philosophy they taught. Life on the plains of Chaldaea, with its mild nights and jewelled skies, tended to foster the interior unfoldment; in early life the disciples of the Magi learnt to resolve the Bonds of proscription and enter the inlnleasurable region. One Oracle assures us that, \"The girders of the Soul, which give her breathing, are easy to be unloosed,\" and elsewhere we read of the \"Melody of the Ether\" and of the \"I,unar clashings,\" experiences which testify to the reality of their occult methods. The Oracles assert that the impressions of charac- ters and other divine visions appear in the Ether. The Chaldaean philosophy recognized the ethers of the Elements as the subtil media through which the operation of the grosser elements is effected-by the grosser elements I mean what we know as Earth, Air, Water and Fire-the principles of dryness and moisture, of heat and cold. These subtil ethers are really the elements of the ancients, and seen1 at an early period to have been connected with the Chal- daean astrology, as the signs of the Zodiac were con- nected with them. The twelve signs of the Zodiac are permutations of the ethers of the elements-four elements with three variations each; and according to the preponderance of one or another elemental condition in the constitution of the individual, so were his natural inclinations deduced therefrom. Thus when in the astrological jargon it was said that a man had Aries rising, he was said to be of a fiery nature, his natural tendencies being active, energetic and fiery, for in the constitution of such a one the fiery ether predominates. And these ethers were"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"stimulated, or endowed with a certain kind of vibra- tion, by their Presidents, the Planets; these latter being thus suspended in orderly disposed zones. Unto the Planets, too, colour and sound were also attributed ; the planetary colours are connected with the ethers, and each of the Planetary forces was said to have special dolninion over, or affinity with, one or other of the Zodiacal constellations. Conlrnu- nion with the hierarchies of these constellations formed part of the Chaldaean theurgy, and in a curious fragment it is said : \" If thou often invokest it\" (the celestial constellation called the Lion) \" then when no longer is visible unto thee the Vault of the Heavens, when the Stars have lost their light the lamp of the Moon is veiled, the Earth abideth not, and around thee darts the lightning flame, then all things will appear to thee in the form of a Lion ! \" The Chaldzans, like the Egyptians, appear to have had a highly developed appreciation of colours, an evidence of their psychic susceptibility. The use of bright colours engenders the recognition of subsis- ting variety and stimulates that perception of the mind which energizes through imagination, or the operation of images. The Chaldzan method of contemplatioil appears to have been to identify the self with the object of contemplation ; this is of course identical with the process of Indian Yoga, and is an idea which appears replete with suggestion ; as it is written, \" He assin~ilates the images to him- self, casting them around his own form.\" But we are told, \" All divine natures are incorporeal, but bodies are bound in them for your sakes.\" The subtil ethers, of which I have spoken, served in their turn as it were for the garment of the divine Light ; for the Oracles teach that beyond these again dL A solar world and endless Light subsist! \" This Divine Light was the object of all veneration. Do not think"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"that what was intended thereby was the Solar Light we know: '\"I'he inerratic sphere of the Starless above\" is an unmistakable expression and therein \" the more true Sun \" has place: Theosophists will appreciate the significance of \" the more true Sun,\" for according to The Secret Doctrize the Sun we see is but the physical vehicle of a more transcendent splentlour. Some strong Souls were able to reach up to the Light by their own power: '' The mortal who approaches the fire shall have Light from the divinity, and unto the persevering mortal the blessed immortals are swift.\" But what of those of a lesser stature? Were they, by inability, precluded from such illumination? \"Others,\" we read, \" even when asleep, He makes fruitful from his own Strength.\" That is to say, some men acquire divine knowledge through cominunion with Divinity in sleep. This idea has given rise to some of the most magnificent contribu- tions to later literature ; it has since been thoroughly elaborated by Porphyry and Synesius. The eleventh Book of the Metamo~@hoses of Apuleius and the Visiolt of Sci$io ably vindicate this ; and, although no doubt every Christian has heard that \" He giveth unto his beloved in sleep,\" few, indeed, realise the possibility tmderlying that conception. What, it may be asked, were the views of the Chal- dzans with respect to terrestrial life : Was it a spirit of pessimism, which led them to hold this in light esteem ? Or, should we not rather say that the key- note of their philosophy was an immense spiritual optimism? It appears to me that the latter is the more true interpretation. They realised that beyond the confines of matter lay a more perfect existence, a truer realm of which terrestrial administration is but a too often travestied reflection. They sought, as we seek now, the Good, the Beautiful and the True, but"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"they did not hasten to the Outer in the thirst for sensa- tion, but with a finer perception realised the true Utopia to be within. ~hd the first step in that admirable progress was a return to the simple life; hardly, indeed, a return, for most of the Magi were thus brought up from birth.% The hardihood engendered by the rugged life, coupled with that wisdom which directed their asso- ciation, rendered these children of Nature peculiarly receptive of Nature's Truths. \"Stoop not down,\" says the Oracle, \"to the darkly splendid World, For a precipice lieth beneath the E;arth, a descent of seven steps, and therein is established the throne of an evil and fatal force. Stoop not down unto that darkly splendid world, Defile not thy brilliant flame with the earthly dross of matter, Stoop not down for its splen- dour is but seeming, It is but the habitation of the Sons of the Unhappy.\" No more beautiful formula- tion of the Great Truth that the exterior and sensuous life is death to the highest energies of the Soul could possibly have been uttered : but to such as by purifi- cation and the practice of virtue rendered themselves worthy, encouragement was given, for, we read, \" The Higher powers build up the body of the holy man.\" The law of Karma m7as as much a feature of the Chaldzean philosophy as it is of the Theosophy of to- day: from a passage in Ficinus, we read, \" The Soul perpetually runs and passes through all things in a certain space of time, which being performed it is presently compelled to pass back again through all things and unfold a similar web of generation in the World, according to Zoroaster, who thinks that as often as the same causes return, the same effects will in like manner return.\" \" They renounced rich attire and the wearing of gold, Their raiment was white upon occasion ; their beds the ground, and their food notliiiig but herbs, cheese and bread"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"This is of course the explanation of the proverb that b'History repeats itself,\" and is very far from the superstitious view of fate. Here each one receives his deserts according to merit or demerit, and these are the bonds of life ; but the Oracles say, \" Enlarge not thy destiny,\" and they urge men to \" Explore the River of the Soul, so that although you have become a servant to body, yo11 may again rise to the Order from which you descended, joining works to sacred reason ! \" To this end we are corninended to learn the Intelli- uible which exists beyond the mind, that divine por- ?ion of the being which exists beyond Intellect : and this it is only possible to grasp with the flower of the mind. \" Understand the intelligible with the extended flame of an extended intellect.\" To Zoroaster also was attributed the utterance \"who knows himself knows all things in himself: \" while it is elsewhere suggested that \" The paternal Mind has sowed symbols 1x1 the Soul.\" But sucli priceless knowledge was possible only to the Theurgists Who, we are told, \" fall not so as to be ranked with the herd that are in subjection to fate.\" The divine light cannot radiate in an imper- fect nlicrocosm, even as the Clouds obsc~~re the Sun ; for of such as make ascent to the most divine of speculations in a confused and disordered manner, with unhallowed lips, or unwashed feet, the progres- sions are imperfect, the impulses are vain and the paths are dark. Although destiny, our destiny, may be \" written in the Stars\" yet it was the mission of the divine Soul to raise the huinan Soul above the circle of necessity, and the Oracles give Victory to that Masterly Will, which \" Hews the mall with might of magic, Breaks the palisade in pieces, Hews to atoms seven pickets . . . Speaks the Master words of knowledge ! \""},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The means taken to that consunlnlation consisted in the training- of the Will and the elevation of the imagination, a-divine power which controls conscious- ness: \" Relieve yourself to be above body, and you are,\" says the Oracle ; it might have added \"Then shall regenerate phantasy disclose the symbols of the Soul.\" But it is said \" On beholding yourself fear! \" i.e., the imperfect self. Everything must be viewed as ideal by him who would &de&tand the ultimate perfection. - Will is the grand agent in the mystic progress ; its rule is all potent over the nervous system. By Will the fleeting vision is fixed on the treacherous waves of the astral Light ; by Will the consciousness is impelled to commune with the divinity : yet there is not One Will, but three Wills-the Wills, namely, of the Divine, the Rational and Irrational Souls-to harmonize these is the difficulty. It is selfishness which impedes the radiation of Thought, and attaches to body. This is scientifically true and irrespective of sentinlent, the selfishness which reaches beyond the necessities of body is pure vulgarity. A picture which to the cultured eye beat~tifully por- trays a given subject, nevertheless appears to the savage a confused patchwork of streaks, so the extended perceptions of a citizen of the Universe are not grasped by those whose thoughts dwell within the sphere of the personal life. The road to the Summum Bonzcm lies therefore through self-sacrifice, the sacrifice of the lower to the higher, for behind that Higher Self lies the concealed form of the Antient of Days, the synthetical Being of Divine Humanity. These things are grasped by Soul ; the song of the Soul is alone heard in the adytunl of God-nourished Silence !"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE ORACLES OF ZOROASTER. CAUSE. GOD. I.
