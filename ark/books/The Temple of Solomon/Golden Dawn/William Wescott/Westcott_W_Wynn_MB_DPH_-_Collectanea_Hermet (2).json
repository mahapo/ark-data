THERE is great reason to believe that this E~zqzlivy ilzto thc Hermetic Art, first published in 1714, led to the composition of the still more extended and more spiritually conceived volun~e, the Suggestive Euquivy in to the Hermetic Mystevy nvd Alchemy, which was published anonymously in 1850. This latter volume, which has for many years been unprocurable, and which cannot yet be reprinted by any one unless with the consent of the survivor of the two authors, is an almost com- plete review of Alchymy on the spiritual plane. The volume before us has a distinct reference to the science of Alchymy referred to the plane of human improvement, although it is also definitely concerned with the equally possible, though almost incredible power of transmuta- tion upon the material plane. This Short Enquiry was written with especial reference to the Kabalistic work, now almost unprocurable, the Bsch Mezavejh, which is a tractate connecting physical alchymy with the Kabalah- so well known to refer to divine, human and cosmic conceptions ; arid which system of philosophy has been so very largely used by the late Madame Blavatsky to support and corroborate the wonderful system of human and universal genesis partly unveiled in her great work, The Secret Doctvirte of the adepts of the Eastern World. With her wonderful intuition she perceived that the published and still extant Kabalistic treatises were but debased copies of the more true Chaldee Hebrew doctrine; for she indeed was never entirely initiated into either of the branches of the still extant Kabalistic and Hermetic secret societies. From the Eastern Light which had dawned upon her so generously, she could indeed criticise, but could never fully comprehend the nature of Kabalistic illumination. Dr. Anna Kingsford, the other eminent modern Theosophist or seeker after the true conception of the Divine, although but slightly familiar with the Indian school of thought, was somewhat fully in communion with the doctrines called Hermetic-or by collateral descent,-Rosicrucian."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The anonymous author of this Short Enquiry was definitely a Rosicrucian adept, and although his common name has not transpired, yet his identity was known to the initiated occul- tists of his day, and the records of his progress inscribed in the unpublished roll of his branch of the Rosicrucian fraternity. The Szrggestive E11quiry chose instead of Bsch Mezarejh, two other ancient discourses upon Alchymy as the text for its in- struction ; these were the \" Aureus, or Golden Tractate of Hermes,\" and the \" Six Keys of Eudoxus,\" which formed one of three portions of the famous He~wzetic T~iuntph, the other two fragments being named the \" War of the Knights,\" and the \" Discourse of Eudoxus and Pyrophilus.\" The earliest edition, known to me, of these curious tracts, is the French translation of \" Limojon de Saint Didier,\" dated 1699; besides this, there is still procurable the English version of 1723. It is intended to reproduce these curious essays in succes- sion to the Esch Mezavejh, which is already in preparation, and which is certain to interest all true students of the occult sciences, because it points out the analogies between alchy- mic tenets and the allegorical explanation of many passages in the Old Testament of the Hebrews. In order to assist fellow students in their investigations, I have added here a summary of the Slzort Enqzriry, and have prevailed upon the learned Soror S. S. D. D., to contri- bute an \" Introduction to Alchymy,\" which will be found pregnant with meaning by those who have the divine afflatus, although to the ordinary reader, who takes up an Hermetic book only from curiosity, her essay will need to be studied with the closest attention. SUMMARY. THE anonymous author commences with a definition of Alchymy, and proceeds to argue that there must be a sound basis for the science because so many authors of different eras and widely separated countries have all agreed upon the essentials of the doctrine and of the art, and that in many instances almost identical results have been described by adepts wholly unknown to each other, although contem- poraneous. He very properly urges that the decision of the truth or error of these doctrines can only be rightly judged by other persons who have actually investigated these researches, and the negative evidence of those who have failed, and the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"judgment of those who have not searched for themselves, is not any criterion by which such intricate forms of philosophy shollld be estimated. He further insists that the great learn- ing and lives of pious zeal of many of those who gained suc- cess in alchymy should demand an 2 pviori confidence in the tenets they demonstrated and sought to unfold. Leaving for the time the thread of the argument, he regrets the failures and wasted energies of manv who, in defiance of the warnhgs of true adepts, and in disregard of the conditions which the3. laid down as essential to success, yet intruded themselves upon this psycho-spiritual path. He points out especially three requirements which were always insisted upon as necessary to attainment of the summum bonum, viz., a vir- tuous life, pure and unsullied by sensual enjoyrnent from birth to the time of trial, a certain freedom from ordinary social and business liabilities, and the inherent power to compre- hend the language of sy~nbol and allegory. He then warmly supports the alleged necessity for the use by alchy~nists of symbolis~n and illustration rather than the plain language of exoteric science ; remarking most truly that to the pupil who has in himself the power to succeed, the light of intuitive perception will surely dawn, and that so will he be enabled to appreciate the ideals intended .to be conveyed, and at the same time will acknowledge the wisdom of such re- veiling as is present in thc works of the true adepts. The Enqui1.y then passing superficially to the Assiatic or material plane, yet at all times preserving the actual scheme of spiritual ~nanifestation, considers the grand doctrine of con- trast, alluding to the essentialdifferences between Perfect and Imperfect metals, and thus introduces the ideal of the Triune. There are three principles of manifestation and of matter, and even three processes of transmutation. The Universal Solvent or bond of union is then considered, the snowy splendour of C'nity standing between the two contrasted forces which form the Dyad. (See the Seplzer Yetzivah.) This subject is largely commented upon, and allusion is made to the Process even upon the plane of matter, requiring a \" Means Mineral \" between the two material forms. Manv illustra- tions are then given, notably the doctrines of sir George Ripley, a Carion of Rridlington, famous alike as a churchman and as a chemist, who formulated the ideal of the Green Lion as a type of the third element--the Means-by which alone could the extremes be knit in perfect association. Ixeturning once more to the help of the student, the Enquiry recommends that such as mean to succeed should"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"study not only oric real master in his published works, but several; because each author took care that by one book alone the whole secret could not be learned ; and that this was not only to stimulate research and cultivate the intuition, but also lest any unworthy person should obtain so great an acquisition as transmutation, which could be rnisused as well as turned to good account. Our author then becomes discursive and suggestive and elucidates (or reveils) the meaning and intention of several symbols and paraphrases, such as the terms '' Doves of Diana'' and the Caduceus of Hermes, and some of the Kabalistic allegories such as the story of Naaman, Elisha and Gehazi. Becoming still more useful to the learner, onr author reverts to the requirements and aims of students, telling them plainly that the Great Secret is almost unattainable by study alone, and that a Master is needed, and that a Master will be forth- coming to him or her who has the inherent faculty of culture upon the Alchymic basis ; and finally Be ends his discourse by encouraging the learner in his efforts by showing the analogies between the seed of gold reproducing gold, and the grain of wheat by which alone is a crop of Wheat to be ob- tained. The Solar heat of nature in her working to produce a crop for man's needs and benefit, is also a type of the Hidden Fire by which the alchyrnist is able to separate the inipure from the pure, and to produce the mystic gold from amongst the dross of worldly mind and common matter. In conclusion, he states, that although the adepts made such free use of allegory, symbol and simile in order to dis- guise their secret, yet if a man's intuition do but take a firm grasp of one of them, the mystery of a whole series unfolds itself, and the discovery of matters, means and process is achieved, alike on the material plane, and in that higher world where we find Rest in God alone.

M.; R.R. et A.C."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"RITEKS on Alchemy are in the habit of making W so many prefatory remarks on their own acccrunt, that their books stand in very little need of preface ; unless indeed, the Editor undertakes to reveal the secrets which the Author is so careful to conceal. I must at once say I am not prepared to do this, but to one thing, I can with advantage call your attention, which is that the study of Alchemy, above all other branches of Occult science, demonstrates the value of Analogy in our search after the real meaning of the mysteries of man and his relation to the Universe. The process of transmutation, which displays a series of colours, recalls the Religion of the Egyptians, sym- bolising as it did, the blackness of night, the rainbow colours of dawn, the whiteness of noon, and the red glow of evening. The first stage of this syn~bolism alludes to the blackness of ignorance, the chaotic dark- ness of men who reject the keys to the secret of the Uriiverse, which are to be found in the rainbow colours; to the vibrations of sound, to scents, tastes, feelings, and subtle psychical impressions. n'hen a man's mind begins to grasp the order and relation of such sense impressions as these, he bids fair to pass from the dark- ness of ignorance to the white light of wisdom, and perhaps eventually to attain to the imperial purple which clothes the elect. To do this he must, within himself, possess the divine gift of wonder; for it is through this faculty that he raises"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"himself above the cares of life. The man whose curiosity carries him from the contemplation of the manifestation to the contemplation of its causes, is the man whose instincts are him to undertake the Great Work. Content is fatal ; the man who is content with any- thing, who does not feel in his most successful momenis, during the most sacred earthly joys, a keen sense of want and disappointment, can never hope to find the Stone of the ii'ise-true wisdom and perfect happiness. The happy are sufficiently rare, however, for me to hope that few of my readers will be deterred frorn the study of Alchemy by what I have said. \\Ve have all been taught to look with horror upon Medusa's head, with the serpents twisting round its face, the terror of which turned all to stone who gazed upon it. Bl~t we must, if we would learn the secret wisdom of the ages, learn to long for a glance from those wonderful eyes, which will bestow upon us the gift of indifference to personal joys and sorrows. For the wise man must be as a precious stone; a centre of light to all that approach him ; giving joy to others, because he contains the image of the highest joy in himself ; desiring nothing from the world, drawing his inspiration from the supernal light-that \" TVisdorn Goddess \" who wears the serpent crowned head upon her shield. \\Tell has Robert Fludd said, \" Be ye changed from dead stones into living philosophical stmes. Be equal with God. Ye hear all these things but ye believe not. Oh miserable mortals, who do so anxiously run after 17 your own ruin. Then the philosopher points out the futility of the ordinary man of petty aims and weak will, never gain- ing the goal of the higher, or for the matter of that, the lower Alchemy. Oh thou miserable one, wilt thou be more happy ? Oh thau proud one, wilt thou be elevated above the circles of this world ? Oh tho^^ ambitious one, wilt thou command in Heaven above this earth, and thy dark body ?"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Oh ye unworthy, will ye perform all miracles ? Know ye rejected ones, of what nature it is, ve seek it.\" before J So it comes to the old, old teaching, GNOTHI SZAUTON, Know thyself; until by deep thought and medita- tion, words have become more than words to thee ; until thou hast analyzed them, separated them, trans- posed them into every conceivabie form, and finally extracted from them, their quintessence and spiritual meaning, thou wilt understand no word that the ancient philosophers speak to thee. Take now the loose meaning attached to such a word as imagination ; in these materialistic days it has become synonymous with extravagant fancy, if not with lyirlg : but hear what Paracelsus says of imagination as an occult manifestation of power : b6 Man has a visible and invisible workshop. The visible one is his body, the invisible one his imagination. . . . The imagina- tion is a sun in the soul of man acting in its own sphere, as the sun in our system acts on the earth. \\I7herever the latter shines, germs planted in the soil grow, and vegetation springs up ; the imagination acts in a sindar manner in the soul, and calls forms of life into existence. . . The Spirit is the master, imagination the tool ; and the body the plastic material. Imagina- tion is the power by which the will forms sidereal en- tities out of thoughts, it can produce and cure disease. 7 3 Perhaps this passage will give new light to those who tlave lately treated this faculty with such contempt, in dealing with the subject of hypnotism. In truth, Imagination is the power of forming images in our minds. It is the development and intensification of an idea, which first exists, is then conceived passively in the thought sphere ; then the mind (perceiving the idea can be used) briqs desire into play, which is de- veloped into an act ofWill, and this converts the passive conception of the idea into an active Imagination. So begins the magical process, the rest it is not for me to divulge."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"I will only add on this subject the saying of Eliphaz Levi, that. \" The first matter of the Magnum Opus is both within and about us, and the intelligent will, which assimilates light, directs the operations of substantial form, and only employs chemistry as a very secondary instrument.\" The Suggestive Enquivy, published a century later than the work under our consideration, points out the method which should he employed in the exhaustive analysis of the nature of man, so necessary to the con~pletion of the great work. He says :- \" Metempsychosis takes the human identity (or con- sciousness) from animal existence to the ethereal ele- ments of its original formation. 7 7 That is, in thinking inwardly with calm and philoso- phic mind we can pass from the manifested life we see and feel, to the motive power of that life ; and finally to the cause of the motive power ; from the mundane to the supra-mundane ; from the intellectual to the intelli- gible ; from the earth to the firmament ; from water to the fiery rays of heat enlergjng from the central light which is the source of all things. The same book continues, \"These elements are the universal fundamentals of nature: only in the Homan form can they attain that supremacy of reason which returns to its first cause.\" Reason is the light which guides us. Let me hasten to add how necessary it is to distinguish between the false reason, and the Heavenly Reason which we per- ceive when intuition is purified ; and we rise above the lower passions. The false reason is merely an image set up by our unbalanced forces to justify us in evil doing. Well has it been said, that when we find our- selves seeking to justify ourselves by giving reasons for our actions, we have been doing something we are secretly ashamed of. True Reason is the clear light descending upon us from that which is above all pretence. It was a com- munion with this faculty, that Saint Thomas B Kempis"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"desired when he told those who would must leave them, as one was waiting for detain him, he him in his cell. False reason seeks to justify itself with much argument ; Pure Reason knows Truth, and can afford to be silent. So continues the Suggestive Enquiry \" In the Fluman form only is it possible to comprehend the Divine form ; when it has done so by a triplicate growth of Light in the understanding consciollsly allied, it emanates a fourth form, truthful, godlike, being the ex- press image of its person magically portrayed.\" 1 think I have said enough to show that the Alchemist undertakes no light task. I can hold out no hope of success to those who still retain an absorbing interest in the world. Itz the world Adepts may be, but not of it. Alchemy is a jealous mistress, she demands from pupils no less than life; for her sake you must perform the twelve labours of Hercules ; for her you must descend into Hell, for her sake you must ascend into Heaven. You must have strength and patience, nothing must terrify you, the joys of Kirv2na must not tempt you ; having chosen your work, you must to this end purify yourself from perishable desires, and bring down the light of the shining ones, that it may radiate upon you here on earth. This is the work of the Alchemist ; his true ideal is also the highest ideal of Eastern Theosophy ; to choose a life that shall bring him in touch with the sorrcws of his race rather than accept the Nirvha open to him ; and like other Saviours of the world, to remain manifested as a living link between the supernal and terrestrial natures.

Of this they often warn us, telling us also, that if it were not for this, they could not disclose, and at the same time hide their Secret. And though this be a Paradox, that at the same time they give light, they darken, yet they affirm it for Truth, with many other things hard enough to be understood; which yet must be understood before any one can profit by them, witness Gebev, j Sendivo, &c.

Magnetia is fair and bright, known by few, and is found in High Places as well as in Low and called by Plato, Tztanos; these are the Materials to make Elixir ; and addeth :- \" This Secret never was before this Day So truly shewed, take it for your Prey.\" Now to apply these things to the Doctrine of Philoso- phers ; Litharge must be their Crass or Philosophical Sol ; Magnetia must be understood to be their Subtil Humidity, or Philosophical Mercury ; which is Living and not only so, but Inlivening ; Clean and not only so, but cleansing ; Volatile, and not only so, but Volatilizing, even the most fixed Body of Sol ; and is the Radical Moisture of Metals. How this is attained, is worthy our Inquiry, and whether they agree in the manner of preparing it, as well as from whence it is to be drawn, viz., From the Sun and Moon; for it seems it must have the Influences of both.

He has in his Books led us some part of the way under such Philosophical Vails, as have been pretty easily seen through by most that read them with Appli- cation ; who no sooner discover some of his Metaphors, but overcome with joy, and exalted with an Opinion of their own Abilities, presently cry out, we have found ! we have found !

This stands at the Entrance into a great Labyrinth, in which are abun- dance of Inquirers rambling at this day; many of them undiscerned by one another. I have taken several Turns in it myself, wherein one shall meet with very few ; for 'tis so large, and almost every one taking a different Path, that they seldom meet.

For as they' have a double Sulphur, so they have a double Mercury, viz., For the White and for the Red : Which is but seldom, and then very cautioudy hinted ; and these Mercuries differ, both in Colour and Quality, as may be easily gathered from their Books, by careful Readers.

This Melancholy Prospect, I say, should leave such a deep Impression upon us, as to make us more cautiously meddle with this rare and difficnlt Philosophy ; which without a Master or the special Favour of God, is never attain'd.

Gehazi labour'd in vain, and reniain'd a Servant for ever ; never qualified to be a Master, notwithstanding he had the Advantage of conversing with so great a one: He was Covetous, a Lyar and Deceiver; a Prattler, boasting of other Men's Deeds ; Conceited and Hasty, thinking he sufficiently understood his Master, when he bids him take his Staff, and lay it upon the Dead Child, presently enterprising, though with an Heterogeneous Matter, and so able to effect nothing not discerning the Law of Nature ; but Elisha apply'd a living Honlogenous Agent, and then the Dead was raised.

Whence they have erred and will always err, unless they learn it better ; the way to learn it, is but just told above, by the Author of The Way to Bliss, which agrees with the \\%Tay Pontanus prescribes, viz., They that should read Geber, and all other Philosophers, never so long, could not comprehend it, because that Fire is found by deep and profound Meditation only ; and then it may be gather'd froni Books, an3 not before. We must not only have the Knowledge of this Fire ; but, as we are often told, the true Measure of it to its Furnace ; both which seem to be remote from the Eyes of the Vulgar : When this is known, the Difficulties that attend the Radical Dissolution of the close and fixed Body of Gold vanish. And before this can be done, this stout fixed Body must be Calcined, and re- * Query, hindrance. t To be reprinted in a future volume of this series."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"duced into as fine a Calx as possible, which is often hinted by Philosophers, but with a design to conceal it. Geber witnesses, that everything Calcined is of easier Solution, because the Parts of the Calcined Body, more subtilated by Fire, are more easily mixed with-water, and turned into Water. Without this previous Calcina- tion, no Solution is found. Therefore no wonder so many fail in their Attempts, to dissolve Gold in a Generative Way, by working on its Compact and Gross Body ; For as the gross Bodies of Sol and Luna are not fit for Dissolution, but only their altered and unctuous Calxes; so Mercury, in its gross Body, is not able to do this, but in its altered more subtile and spiritual Natl~re ; and drawn from its Vitriolick Caverns, acuated with its pure salt and pierc- ing Sulphur, which then overcomes all things, even itself. For it not only dissolves Sol and Luna into its own Nature. but coag&tes itself into theirs, true and fixed, by a proper Heat only. Some may say, All these are so fully taught already, that a bare repeating of them is of no use. That they are taught already, by the Masters of this Science themselves, 1s my warrant for repeating of 'em ; and if you have already ldearn7d these things, you have no Reason to be uneasie ; if you have not, tls your ad- vantage to be put in mind of them, even by an Inquirer. Sad experience sheweth, that but very few of the past or present Searchers, learn those things which they often brag the Philosophers have taught : But at length to cover their own Ignorance, they fall into Arrogance, and blame the Philosophers for hiding of thern ; as is observed by (the never too much to be admired) Candid Ripley ; who, in return, only modestly reproves them, Thus :- ;' All Philosophers record and say the same ; Rut simple Searchers putteth them in blame, Saying, they hide it ; Rut they are Blameworthy, Who are no Clerks and meddle with Philosophy.\" Here this good Man, in few words, justifies the true"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Philosophers, and lavs the blame where it ought, uiz., on the Unskilful ~ediers with Philosophy. What tho' he has conceal'd the Key of the Art under his green Lion, as others have done under the Doves, Chalibs, secret Fire, etc., some under one figure, some under another, which best answered their purpose, viz., Concealing the Art from the Unworthy. IVhat they have done towards Discovering of it to the Deserving, merits the greatest Acknowledgements, not Censure from Inquirers to whom they declare they are not indebted. Nor do I affirm, that all these different Terms are synonymous, that behoves the Inquirer to satisfy himself in, from their Writing, whether they are or can be deemed so. I have ventur'd to call the Green Lion of Ripley the Key of the Work, because his Expositor has as good as called it so.

Again our Chalibs is the true Key of our work, with- out which the Fire of the Lamp could not be, by any Art, kindled. Which he further describes thus, viz., It is the Minera of Gold, a Spirit very pure, beyond others, etc. Sendivogius calls this Matter, as well by the Name of Magnet, as Chalibs, ziz., To speak more plainly, says he, 'tis our Magnet, which, in our foregoing * Sendivogius."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Treatises, I called Chalibs, or Steel.

This Author has cornprized in few Words what the Author of Intvo. AQe9.t. has divided into Three Chapters, viz., Chalibs, Magnet, and Air ; all which he has Con- centrated in a Fourth, viz., Chaos. The Earth, says he, is a heavy Body, the Matrix of Minerals, because it keeps them occultly in itself; altho' it brings to light Trees and animals. The Heaven is that wherein the great Lights, together with the Stars, are rowled about ; and it sends down its Virtues through the Air into inferior things. When he has gone thus far, he, in Imitation of Sendivogius's Skill and Candor, adds, But in the Beginning, all being confounded together, made a Chaos. Eehold !

In Philosophers Rooks therefore, who lifts to see, Our Stone is called the less World One and Three : Magnesia also of Sulphur, and Mercury, Proportionate by Nature most perfectly.\" Thus we see Ripley's One Mass, Phila!ethesYs Chaos, and Sendivogius's Matter of the Antient Philosophers, are the same ; containing Three, viz., Magnet, Chalibs, Air, or RIagnesia, Sulphur and Mercury : which also are called by abundance of other Names in Philosophers' Books, e.g., Artephius speaking of the Compound, Magnesia, says, That 'tis compounded,\" like a Man of Body, Soul and Spirit ; which he thus expounds, viz.,"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"\" For the Body is the fixed Earth of the Sun, which is bb more than most fine, ponderously lifted up by the force bb of our Divine Wa-ter : The Soul is the Tincture of the '( Sun and Moon, proceeding from the Conjunction or 4b Communication of these two : But the Spirit is the bL Mineral L'irtue of the Two 1-3odies and the Water, which ((carries the Soul, etc. Again, the Spirit therefore 6L pierceth, the Body fiseth, the Soul coupleth, coloureth bb and whitcneth.

It ~vould be as it were endless, and indeed needless, to recite all the different Expressions used by Philosophers, who confirm and constantljr maintain this Doctrine of Trinity in Unity, under vn;ious Modes of Speech, and llard-to-be-understood Similes.

Why 'tis called a Lion, is hinted by another, viz., Having Power to overcome, and reduce Bodies to their first Matter, and to make fixed things volatile and spiritual ; whence 'tis fitly called a Lion. Some there are who derive the Name Green from the Rawness or Unripeness of the Subject, and not from the Colour, viz. :- \"Whose Colour doubtless is not so, And that your Wisdom do well know ; Rut our Lion wanting Maturity, Is called Green, from Unripeness, trust me.\" The Hzr~zti~zg of the Gi~een Liou.

These are some more of the seeming Contradictions, which Philosophers warn us not to be deceived with, but to learn to Reconcile. These Difficulties are to be overcome by Meditation only. Now, let us try whether, or how far, 'tis possible to Reconcile these Contradictions concerning the Green Lion. The Cabalist (much admired by me) says, the Matter is actually green, both before 'tis dissolved and afterwards also : This doth not deny, but confirm, that 'tis spoke of, and considered, in divers States ; and then it may not be absurd to suppose, that it may be, and is, described by one in one state and degree of Perfection, and by others in another: Hy one in its Impurity ; bj?"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"another in its Passage from thence to its Purity (for Ripley says 'tis unclean) ; and by a third when 'tis Purified. For as Matters, when more or less pure or mature, are of a different Texture, so they also differ in Colour. And 'tis in this Sense, I make no doubt the Philosophers are to be understood, not only with relation to this Subject, but 'Tis not therefore every Matter which is foul or green (as Vitriol is, which Ripley says, Fools take to be their Green Lion) that intitles it to this wonderful Name ; no, but it must have all the other Virtues and Powers in it, that are assigned by Philoso- phers : Which thing lies very obscure, and seemingly base, but it is, in its Purity and exalted Virtue, their Subject of Wonders. To produce which, this fond Minera, they tell us, must be dissolved and exactly purified, in a pure Homogeneal Wzter, which is its own Blood, as White as Milk; which Name some have rather imposed. This Leprous Body, Sendivo and others have called Saturn, and Saturn's Child; and what some have called Blood and Milk, lie calls Urine. Thus the Masters of this Science take the liberty to express themselves by different Similes, in order to dis- guise their Secret, which a mental man will discover and improve by, as soon as he shall discern any one of their Intentions ; the rest follow in course, tho' varied ever so many ways, as they themselves testifie. What some have called Blood, VCrine, &c., the Author of the Lenmed Sopkics Feast calls fiery Water, &c., viz. :'' *' Their Lion green they suffer'd him to prey On Cadrnus Sociates ; and when the Fray Was over, they with Dian's charms him ty'd Aud made him under Waters to abide, And washed hirn clean ; and after gave him Wings To fly, much like a Dragon, whose sharp springs Of fiery Water, the only way was found To cause Apollo his Harp.-strings to sound.

I. Hevrnetic ; alluding to Hermes Trismegistos : a mythical Magus who has given his name to many treatises on western Occultism and Alchemy. The names of Hiram King of Tyre, Chiram abif and Hermes have been counterchanged ; and the Kabalistic Key applied to the name throws some light on the actual meaning of the Alchemical process,-taking the Hebrew lettering CH I R M, we get the falling dew containing that principle of life re production-nitrogen, working in darkness upon the perfectable bodv. Also an expert may here discern an allusion to the wonderful power of chlorine on gold. The merest tyro in chenlistry knows the famous Aqua Regia of the ancients was a cunningly manufactured liquor bearing a close resemblance to the fluid obtained by the mixture of Nitric acid and Hydro- chloric acid. 2. Art.-The Hermetic Science being the Ethical side of 14;estern i)ccultisni ; the Hermetic art may be regarded as the practical application of the same on all planes, from those of pure reason and exalted conscious- ness through those of human life down to the most material ; from the regeneration and purification of the soul, to the regeneration and purification of the baser metals. 3.

The Avt nltogetizev inifiossible.-The position taken up is natural enough. No man could with reasonable hope of success, hope to transform a fully grown elm tree into an oak, just as impossible would it seem to trans- mute a lump of copper into a lump of gold. But the Alcheniists did not assert this to be possible, until both metals were reduced to one original basic substance, which they call HylB and which we call Protyle in the mineral, or Protoplasm in the animal world. It was under these circumstances that they asserted transmutation to be possible; and it is in this relation we find the deep significance of the mystical death and resurrections of Osiris, Buddha and Christ. \" Unless ye be born again ye cannot enter into the kingdom of perfection; \" Unless the imperfect metal is destroyed, it cannot rise again into perfection.

It is the Art of living in the divine light ; the Art of knowing, the Art of \"being one \" with the highest universal consciousness.

This ~nysterioz~s way of writing.-For the guidance of those who propose to study ancient and medizval writers on Alchemy, I may say that the work naturally divides itself into three parts ; and each of these into three processes, decoction, distillation, cohobation. The first part is the preparation of the Body or matter ; the second is preparation of the soul or medium ; and the third is preparation of the spirit or active principle. Take the three principles of the Alchemists, being the time honoured veils under which truth has been hid. Call the body-sulphur, the soul-salt, and the spirit- mercury. Purify each separately, then must these three become one ; they must rise ; they must fall ; they must circulate in the vessel. And this is the fourth work. This is simple enough and is the mere ordinary process of subliming. with heat, cohobating the separated parts, and subliming again until the body becomes spiritual, the spirit become corporified, the impure becomes pure, and nothing is wasted, but all is found in its right place, and the perfection or right proportion is attained. 8. Tnhe one thing.-Just as on the human plane you take the one man ; and reduce him in thought down to the cell unit, so the alchemists reduced their one substance to its simplest form, and found things all latent therein. 9. That is, as soon as anyone develops his power of intuition, of reading between the lines, and of under- standing the oriental passion of allegory that permeates mystical and religious writers, the meaning of many statements, utterly absurd if interpreted literally, wiil appear plain to the enlightened mind. 10. Diana.-The moon goddess, answering to what has of late been called the astral body or aura ; the sensitive radiations of which convey impressions to our bodily sense organs. The Fountain alludes to the uni- versal source of life and light with which it is the object of the occult student to bring his astral life into touch."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"I I. The Secret Way of Philosophers.-The philosophers know well enough that the first study for mankind is Man ; to know thyself is to know nature.

The above explains why in this work we do not begin with quicksilver. 13. This is the first practical remark, on the subject of metals, in the treatise. It may here be noted that com- mon quicksilver dissolves into a liquid resembling water in appearance if mixed with a proportion of one to ten of nitric acid. 14. The Perfect body.-Gold undergoes a considerable change when mixed with mercury. The imperfect body mercury can be reduced to subtil water with nitric acid. 15.
