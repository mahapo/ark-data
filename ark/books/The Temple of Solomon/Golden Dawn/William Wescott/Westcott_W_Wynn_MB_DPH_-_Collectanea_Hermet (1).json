[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"EDITED BY VOLUME 11. THE PYMANDEK HEKMES"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"PREFACE THIS volume contains the English translation by Dr. Everard, 1650, of seventeen tracts (of which the Pynta~zder is one) attributed to Hermes Trismegistos, otherwise Mercurius Termaximus, or in the Egyptian language, Thoth, or Taautes or Tat. Of this Hermes no reliable historical details have come down to us, but many of the ancient authors have referred to Hermes as an inspired teacher who instructed the priests and rulers of the Egyptian nation at a time almost certainly anterior to that commonly associated with Moses. It has been asserted by men who have been called learned, that this Hermes was really identical with Enoch, and by others he has been identified as Gautama- the Buddha. If the name HERMES be taken and the suffix ES be neglected, and the word formed of the letters H, R, M, be traced through Chaldee, Coptic, Greek and Latin forms, an analogy will be observed between Hermes, and Hiram the hero of the myth of Freemasonry, a symbolical system of morals and theosophy which is but a reconstruction of a portion of the Ancient Mysteries. Now the Mysteries of Egypt, named Osirian, Serapian and Isiac, are the most ancient known to us, and were the parents of the Eleusinian Mysteries of the Greeks. All these Mysteries were initiations, or forms of Esoteric instruction relating to theosophy, properly so-called, that is the knowledge of divine powers and beings, and the connection between Man and the Divine Source from which he is animated and inspired. Now the tracts which have come down to us, associated with the name of Hermes as their author, are all concerned with that arcane wisdom which was developed in three directions:- Theosophy,-religious and ethical teaching ; Alchymy-the relation of the material to the spiritual and the transmutations of the former into the latter ; and Magic-the employment of the higher powers latent in man upon the physical plane. In the Hermetic tracts these several objects are not kept dis- tinct, but on the contrary, are almost invariably combined ;"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"iv PREFACE. hence the great value to a true student of Occultism of these very ancient writings. It is not of course asserted that the Pynza~zde~~ or other Hermetic work has come down to us in its original form, but it is contended that although varied in many a line and possibly in many a doctrine by the Neo- Platonists and Alexandrian school, and perhaps in later days by Christian philosophers, the Pynzarzde~f, Au~ws, etc., do* yet enshrine the very old Egyptian ideals, and are almost the only remains now existing of the Wisdom of the hiero- phants of the Nile valley. Kenealy has asserted that the name Hermes meant in the ancient Egyptian language-an interpreter, and in a certain sense the later Hermes of the Greeks and the Mercurius of the Romans conveyed the same notion; this author, in his quaint conceit of Twelve Saviours, places Hermes under the name of Thoth as the Sixth Messiah, and assigns to him the era of 1800 years before Christ. This Thoth, as an Egyptian divinity, is often represented as a human form with an Ibis head ; now the bird Ibis was notable as being the great destroyer of snakes, and the snake as apart from the regal serpent, was an emblem of evil, sin and error; hence the Snake Destroyer fits in well with the character of Hermes as a Teacher of divine truths, which would serve to crush and beat down evil thoughts an& actions. The earliest record of the title Trismegistos, as applied to this Egyptian sage, is found in Greek authors who lived some four centuries R.C. The Neo-Platonists, who were of Greek culture, looked upon Hermes as the embodied LOGOS, or Word or Manifestation of the Divine Spirit. The title may have had reference to his mastery over the Three Divine sciences-Theosophy, Alchymy and Magic-as indeed is stated in paragraph twelve of the Emerald Tablet assigned to him, of which the words following are an old Latin version : Itnque vocatzis sum Hevnzes Tris?negistz~s, Iznbem tvespnrtes divi.11~ plzilocopkia totius mundi-that is \" possessing the three parts of the divine philosophy of the whole world.\" The name Pymander is of Greek and not Egyptian type; it is variously spelled Pinlander and Poemandres. Its deriva- tion appears to be from poi~~z~tz-a shepherd, and an?r, genitive plural ntzdvGrz, and so the Guide of Man, Shep- herd of men, and is nearly equivalent to Messiah. In this tract the Pymander is giving instruction to Hermes the sage, n the capacity of Divine teacher to human pupil. A parallel"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"PREFACE.

Blavatsky in Tlze Sccvet Doctrirze refers to the Pynzmtdev as the \" Thought Divine,\" the Inspired Teacher of that Race- Vol. I., 63 ; and again at page 74, she speaks of Pymander as \" the oldest and most spiritual of the Logoi of the Western continent.\" She also notices the possibility of a Hebrew derivation fro~n PI, meaning a mouth, and command, or instruction. I observe that Parlthurst associates with this word, the Greek Phemi-to speak, so perhaps another form of title may be Phemander-one who spoke to man. There are two other persons mentioned in the Pynza~der ; these are Tat assumed to be a son of Hermes, and Asclepius a grandson. The Py~ltnndev has been many times printed, but it is a very difficult volume to obtain. Recent editions have been those of Hargrave Jennings, 1884, a reprint of Everard's English version ; John David Chambers, Edinburgh, 1882, a new translation from the Greek; and that of L. Rlitnard, Paris, 1867. Of earlier date are the Greek text of C. Parthey Rerolins, 1854; an Italian version by C. Lenzoni, 1548; a German edition by J. Scheible, 1855 ; a French translation, Franqois de Fois, 1579. The earliest Latin edition is that of Marsilius Ficinus, 1471, followed by Franciscus Patricius, 1593 ; Flussas, I j74 ; H. Rosselus, 1630; and 1676 ; and others contained in volmnes associated with the writings of Lucius Apuleius of Madaura, and with the books attributed to Jamblichus of Chalcis. The present edition is a fncsimils reprint of the translation of the Rev. Dr. Everard from an Arabic text, of which there were two editions published in 1650 and 1657 respectively; this edition is from the earlier one. No alteration has been made except in the mode of spelling of a few words, the archaic form of which in the original would, it was feared, distract the reader's attention fro~n the subject. It is preceded by a preface by J. F., whose name is unknown. The second edition was a reprint of the Pywzartdev, and contained in addition an English translation of fifteen chapters of Ascltrpiz~s with a commentary. Very little is known of the Rev. John Everard, D.D., but Alsager Vian states that he was born about 1575 and died about 1650.

It is most probable that he was in truth a Neo- Platonist at heart and was also a disciple of the German mystic Tauler. His original works contain many quotations from Plato, Proclus and Plotinus. With these notes I leave this Preface, without any attempt to comment on or explain the subject matter of the Pynzander, believing that it will be better for a student to read and assimilate what he can from the original, rather than to read the work through my spectacles, or those of any other fellow student .

JUDICIOUS READER, This Book may justly challenge the first place for antiquity, from all the Books in the World, being written some hundreds of years before Moses his time, as I shall endeavour to make good. The Original (as far as is known to us) is Ambic, and several Translations thereof have been published, as G~eek, Latijz, Fvench, Dtttclz, etc., but never E@sh before. It is pity the*: Learned Translator had not lived, and received himself, the honour, and thanks due to him from Englislznze~t for his good will to, and pains for them, in translating a Book of such infinite worth, out of the Original, into their Mother-tongue. Concerning the Author of the Book itself, Four things are considerable, viz., His Name, Learning, Country, and Time. I. The name by which he was commonly styled, is Hemes Tsisntegistzis, i.e., Mevcuvitls tev Mccximus, or, The thrice greatest Intelligencer. And well might he be called Hevnzes, for he was the first Intelligencer in the World (as we read of) that communicated Knowledge to the sons of Men, by Writing, or Engraving. He was called Ter Maximus, for some Reasons, which I shall afterwards mention. 2. His Learning will appear, as by his Works ; so by the right understanding the Reason of his Name. 3. For his Country, he was King of Egypt. 4. For his Time, it is not without much Contro- versy, betwixt those that write of this Divine, ancient * Doctor Everard."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Author, what time he lived in. Some say he lived after Moses his time, giving this slender Reason for it, viz., Because he was named Tev Mnximcs; for being pre- ferred\"' (according to the Egyptintz Customs) being chief Philosopher, to be chief of the Priesthood ; and from thence, to be chief in Government, or King. But if this be all their gronnd, you must excuse my dissent from them, and that for this reason, Because according to the most learned of hist followers, he was called Tev Maxiwns ; for having perfect, and exact Knowledge of all things contained in the World ; which things he divided into Three Kingdoms (as he calls them), viz., Mitzevnl, Vecefable, Animd ; which Three, he did excel in the right understanding of ; also, because he attained to, and transmitted to Posterity (although in an Enigmati- cal, and obscure style) the Knowledge of the Quin- tessence of the whole Universe (which Universe, as I said before, he divided into Three Parts) otherwise called, The great Elixiv of the Philosophers ; which is the Receptacle of all Celestial and Terrestrial Virtues ; which Secret, many ignorantly deny, many have charge- ably sought after, yet few, but some, yea, and Eqlish- nzen: have happily found. The Description of this great Treasure, is said to be found engraved upon a Snznvngdirze Table, in the Valley of Ebvogz, after the Flood. So that the Reason before alleged to prove this Author to live after Moses, seem invalid; neither doth it any way appear, that he lived in Moses his time, although it be the oginion of some, as of lolm Fzwtizcs, who saith in his ch;onology, hat he lived wen ti-one years before the Law was given by Moses in the Wilderness : But the Reasons that he, and others give, are far * Franciscus Flussas. t Geber, Paracelsus ; Henricus Nollius in Theovin Phz1osopki.a Hemetice, tvactatu pviimo. 1 Ripley, Bacon, Norton, etc."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"weaker than those that I shall give, for his living before Moses his time. My reasons for that, are these :- First, Because it is rec eived amongst the Ancients, that he was the first that invented the Art of communi- cating Knowledge to the World, by Writing or Engrav- ing. Now if so, then in all probability he was before Moses; for it is said of Moses that he was from;:: his childhood, skilled in all the Egyptian Learning, which could not well have been without the help of Literature, which we never read of any before that invented by Hevmes. Secondly, he is said by+ himself, to he the son of Sntunz and by: others to be the Scribe of Saiuvfz. Now Sntztvlt according to Historians, lived in the time of Savug, A bvahavz's great Grand-Father. I shall but take in Sz~idns his judgment, and so rest satisfied, that he did not live only before, but long before Moses ; His words are t heselr, Cvedo Mercuviz~;n Tvis~negistzm sL@icntevz Egyp - tium jlovuisse ante Pharnonem In this Book, though so very old, is contained more true knowledge of God and Nature, tahn in all the Books in the IVorld besides, I except only Sacred Writ ; And they that shall judiciously read it, and rightly understand it, may well be excused from reading many Books ; the Authors of which, pretend so much to the knowledge of the Creator, and Creation. If God ever appeared in any man, he appeared in him, as it appears by this Book. That a man who had not the benefit of his Ancestors' knowledge, being as I said before, The first inventor of the Art of Communicating Knowledge to Posterity by writing, should be so high a Divine, and so deep a Philosopher, seems to be a thing more of God than of Man ; and therefore it was the opinion of some/l That he came from Heaven, not born upon Earth. There is contained in this Book, that true Philosophy, * Acts vii. 22. t Chapter x. f Sanchoniathon. lT Suidas. 11 Goropius Becanus."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"without which, it is impossible ever to attain to the height, and exactness of Piety, and Religion. According to this Philosophy, I call him a Philosopher, that shall learn and study the things that are, and how they are ordered, and governed, and by whom, and for what cause, or to what end ; and he that doth so, will acknow- ledge thanks to, and admire the Omnipotent Creator, Preserver, and Director of all these things. And he that shall be thus truly thankful, may truly be called Pious and Religious : and he that is Religious, shall more and more know where and what the Truth is : And learning that, he shall yet be more and more Religious. The glory and splendour of Philosophy, is an en- deavouring to understand the chief Good, as the Foun- tain of all Good: Now how can we come near to, or find out the Fountain, but by making use of the Streams as a conduct to it ? The operations of Nature, are Streams running from the Fountain of Good, which is God. I am not of the ignorant, and foolish opinion of those that say, The greatest Philosophers are the greatest Atheists : as if to know the works of God, and to understand his goings forth in the Way of Nature, must necessitate a man to deny God. The': Scripture disapproves of this as a sottish tenet, and experience contradicts it: For behold! Here is the greatest Philosopher, and therefore the greatest Divine.

It is a Venerable way, and plain, but hard and difficult for the Soul to go in that is in the Body. 9.

And for this cause, Man above all things that live upon Earth, is double; Mortal because of his Body, and Immortal because of the substantial Man : For being immortal, and having power of all things, he yet suffers mortal things, and such as are subject to Fate or Destiny. 27. And therefore being above all Harmony, he is made and become a servant to Harmony. And being Herma- phrodite, or Male and Female, and watchful, he is governed by and subjected to a Father, that is both RIale and Female and watchful. 28. After these things, I said : \" Thou art my Mind and I am in love with Reason.\" 29. Then said Pimander, \" This is the Mystery that to this day is hidden, and kept secret ; for Nature being mingled with Man brought forth a Wonder most won- derful ; for he having the Nature of the Harmony of the Seven, from him whom I told thee, the Fire and the Spirit,Nature continued not, but forth with brought forth seven Men all Males and Females and sublime, or on high, according to the Natures of the Seven Governors.\" 30. \"And after these things, 0 Pimander,\" quoth I! I am now come into a great desire, and longing to hear, do not digress, or run out.\" 3I . But he said, fi Keep silence, for I have not yet finished the first speech.\" 32. TRISM. Behold, I am silent. 33. PIYAND. The Generation therefore of these Seven was after this manner, the Air being Feminine and the Water desirous of Copulation, took from the Fire its ripeness, and from the ~ther Spirit ; and so Nature produced bodies after the Species and Shape of men. 34. And Man was made of Life and Light into Soul and Mind, of Life the Soul, of Light the Mind."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"35. And so all the Members of the Sensible World, continued unto the period of the end, bearing rule, and generating. 36. Hear now the rest of that speech, thou so much desirest to hear. 37. When that Period was fulfilled, the bond of all things was loosed and untied by the Will of God ; for all living Creatures being Hermaphroditical, or Male and Female, were loosed and untied together with Man ; and so the Males were apart by themselves and the Females likewise. 38. And straightway God said to the Holy Word, Increase in Increasing, and Multiply in Multitude all you my Creatures and Workmanships. And let Him that is endued with Mind, know Himself to be Immor- tal; and that the cause of Death is the Love of the Body, and let Him Learn all Things that are. 39. When he had thus said, Providence by Fate and Harmony, made the mixtures, and established the Generations, and all things were multiplied according to their kind, and he that knew himself, came at length to the Superstantial of every way substantial good. 40. But he that through the Error of Love, loved the Body, abideth wandering in darkness, sensible, suffering the things of death. 41. TRISM. But why do they that are ignorant sin so much, that they should therefore be deprived of immortality. 42. PIMAND. Thou seemest not to haw understood what thou hast heard. 43. TRIS~J. Peradventure I seem so to thee, but I both understand and remember them. 44. PI~~AND. I an1 glad for thy sake, if thou under- stoodest them. 45. TRISM.

Because there goeth a sad and dismal darkness before its Body; of which darkness is the"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"moist Nature, of which rnoist Nature, the Body con- sisteth in the sensible IVorld, from whence death is derived. Hast thou understood this aright ? 47. TRISM. But why or how doth he that under- stands himself, go or pass into God ? 48. PI That which the Word of Godsaid, say I : Because the Father of all things consists of Life and Light, whereof Man is made. - 49. TKISM. Thou sayest very well. 50. PIMAXD. God and the Father is Light and Life, of which Man is made. If therefore thou learn and believe thyself to be of the Life and Light, thou shalt again pass into Life. 51. TRISM. But yet tell me more, 0 my Mind, how I shall go into Life. 52. PIMAND. God saith, Let the Man endued with a Mind, mark, consider, and know himself well. 53. TRISM. Have not all Men a mind ? 54. PIMAKD. Take heed what thou sayest, for I the Mind come unto men that are holy and good, pure and merciful, and that live piously and religiously ; and 111y presence is a help unto them. And forthwith they know all things, and lovingly they supplicate and propitiate the Father; and blessing liirn, they give him thanks, and sing hymns unto him, being ordered and directed by filial Affection, and natural Love : And before they give up their Bodies to the death of them, they hate their Senses, knowing their TVorks and Operations. 55. Rather I that am the Mind itself, will not suffer the Operations or IVorks, which happen or belong to the body, to be finished and brought to perfection in them ; but being the Porter and Door-keeper, I will shut up the entrances of Evil, and cut off the thought- ful desires of filthy works. 56. Elxt to the foolish, and evil, and wicked, and envlolis and covetous, and n~urderous, and profane, I am far off giving place to the avenging Demon, which applying unto him the sharpness of fire, tormenteth"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"such a man sensibly, and arrneth him the more to all wickedness, that he may obtain the greater punishment. 57. And such a one never ceaseth, having unful- fillable desires and unsatiable concupiscences, and always fighting in darkness for the Demon afflicts and tormenteth him continually, and increaseth the fire upon him more and more. 58. TRISM. Thou hast, 0 Mind, most excellently taught me all things, as I desired ; but tell me more- over, after the return IS made, what then ? 59. PIMAND. First of all, in the resolution of the material Body, the Body itself is given up to alteration, and the form which it had, becometh invisible ; and the idle manners are permitted, and left to the Demon, and the Senses of the Body return into their Fountains, being parts, and again made up into Operations. 60. And Anger and Concupiscence go into the brutish or unreasonable Nature ; and the rest striveth upward by Harmony. 61. And to the first Zone it giveth the power it had of increasing and diminishing. 62. To the second, the machination or plotting of evils, and one effectual deceit or craft. 63. To the third, the idle deceit of Concupiscence. 64. To the fourth, the desire of Rule, and unsatiable Ambition. 65. To the fifth, profane Boldness, and headlong rashness of Confidence. 66. To the sixth, Evil and ineffectual occasions of Riches. 67. And to the seventh Zone, subtle Falsehood always lying in wait. 68. And then being made naked of all the Opera- tions of Harmony it corneth to the eighth Nature, hav- ing its proper power, and singeth praises to the Father with the things that are, and all they that are present rejoice, and congratulate the coming of it ; and being made like to them with whom it converseth, it heareth"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"also the Powers that are above the eighth Nature, sing- ing praise to God in a certain voice that is peculiar to them. 69.

Furthermore, why sayest thou, What resteth, but that understanding all men, thou become a guide, and way-leader to them that are worthy ; that the kind of Humanity or Mankind, may be saved by God ? 72. When Pimander had thus said unto me, he was mingled among the Powers. - 73. But I giving thanks, and blessing the Father ofs all things, rose up, being enabled by him, and taught the Nature, of the Nature of the whole and having seen - the greatest sight or spectacle. 74. And I began to Preach unto men, the beauty and fairness of Piety and Knowledge. 75. 0 ye People, Men, born and made of the Earth, which have given Yourselves over to Drunkenness, and. Sleep, and to the Ignorance of God, be Sober, and Cease your Surfeit, whereto you are allured, and invited by Brutish and Unreasonable Sleep. d 76. And they that heard me, come willingly, and with one accord, and then I said further. 77. Why, 0 Men of the Off-spring of the Earth, why have you delivered Yourselves over unto Death, having Power to Partake of Immortality ; Repent and Change your Minds, you that have together Walked in Error, and have been Darkened in Ignorance. 78. Depart from that dark Light, be Partakers of Immortality, and Leave or Forsake Corruption. 79. And some of Them That Heard Me, mocking and scorning, went away and delivered themselves up to the way Gf death. - 80. But others, casting themselves down before my"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"feet, besought me that they might be taught ; but I causing them to rise up, became a guide of mankind, teaching them the reasons how, and by what means they may be saved. And I sowed in them the words of ~kdom, and nourished them with Ambrosian Water of Immortality. 81. hnd when it was Evening, and the Brightness of the same began wholly to go down, I comn~anded them to give thanks to God; and when they had finished their thanksgiving, everyone returned to his own lodging. 82. But3 wrote in myself the bounty and beneficence of Pinlander ; and being filled with what I most desired, I was exceeding glad. 83. For the sleep of the Body was the sober watch- fulness of the mind ; and the shutting of my eyes the true Sight, and my silence great with child and full of good ; and the pronouncing of my words, the blossoms and fruits of good things. 84. And thus came to pass or happened unto me, which I received from my mind, that is, Pimander, the Lord of the Word ; whereby I becarne inspired by God with the Truth. 85. For which cause, with my Soul, and whole strength, I give praise and blessing unto God the Father. 86. Holy is God the Father of All Things. 87.

And all the Gods distinguished the Nature full of Seeds. 5. And when all things were interminated and un- made up, the light things were divided on high. And the heavy things were founded upon the moist sand, all things being Terminated or Divided by Fire ; and being sustained or hung up by the Spirit they were so carried, and the Heaven was seen in Seven Circles. 6. And the Gods were seen in their Ideas of the Stars, with all their Signs, and the Stars were numbered, with the Gods in them. And the Sphere was all lined with Air, carried about in a circular motion by the Spirit of God. 7.

For there is one name or appellation of Nature and increase which concerneth things changeable, and another about things unchangeable, and about things unn~oveable, that is to say, Things Divine and Human ; every one of which, himself will have so to be ; but action or operation is of another thing, or elsewhere, as we have taught in other things, Divine and Human, which must here also be understood. 4. For his Operation or Act, is his Will, and his Essence, to Will all Things to be. 5. For what is God, and the Father, and theGood, but the Being of all things that yet are not, and the existence itself, of those things that are ? 6. This is God, this is the Father, this is the Good, whereunto no other thing is present or approacheth. 7.

For Good is always active or busy in making ; and this cannot be in any other, but in him that taketh nothing, and yet willeth all things to be ; for I will not say, 0 Tat, making them ; for he that maketh is defec- tive in ~nuch time, in which sometimes he maketh not, as also of quantity and quality ; for sometime:; he mak- eth those things that have quantity and quality and sometimes the contrary. 10. But God is the Father, and the Good, in being all things ; for he both will be this, and is it, and yet all this for himself (as is true) in him that can see it. I I. For all things else are for this, it is the property of Good to be known : This is the Good, 0 Tat. 12. TAT. Thou hast filled us, 0 Father, with a sight both good and fair, and the eye of my mind is almost become more holy by the sight or spectacle. 13. TRISII. \" I Wonder not at It, for the Sight of Good is not like the Beam oE the Sun, which being of a fiery shining brightness, maketh the eye blind by his excessive Light, that gazeth upon it ; rather the con- trary, for it enlighteneth, and so much increaseth the light of the eye, as any man is able to receive the influ- ence of this intelligible clearness. 14. For it is more swift and sharp to pierce, anJ inndcent or harmless withal, and full- of irGmortality, and they that are capable and can draw any store of this spectacle, and sight do many times fall asleep from the Body, into this most fair and beauteousvision ; which thing Celius and Saturn our Progenitors obtained unto. 15.

For the knowledge of it, is a Divine Silence, and the rest of all the Senses; For neither can he that understands that understand anything else, nor he that sees that, see any thing else, nor hear any other thing, nor in sum, move the Body. 18. For shining steadfastly upon, and round about the whole Mind it enlighteneth all the Soul ; and loosing it from the Bodily Senses and Motions, it draweth it from the Body, and changeth it wholly into the Essence of God. 19. For it is Possible for the Soul, 0 Son, to be Deified while yet it Lodgeth in the Body of Man, if it Contemplate the Beauty of the Good. 20. TAT. HOW dost thou mean deifying, Father ? 21. TRISM. There are differences, 0 Son, of every Soul. 22. TAT. But how dost thou again divide the changes ? 23. TRISM. Hast thou not heard in the general Speeches, that from one Soul of the Universe, are all those Souls, which in all the world are tossed up and down, as it were, and severally divided ? Of these Souls there are many changes, some into a more fortunate estate, and some quite contrary ; for they which are of creeping things, are changed into those of watery things and those of things living in the water, to those of things living upon the Land ; and Airy ones are changed into men, and human Souls, that lay hold of in~mortality, are changed into Demons. 24. And so they go on into the Sphere or Region of the fixed Gods, for there are two choirs or companies of Gods, one of them that wander, and another of them that are fixed. And this is the most perfect glory of the Soul. 25. But the Soul entering into the Body of a Man, if it continue evil, shall neither taste of immortality, nor is partaker of the good."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"26. But being drawn back the same way, it returneth into creeping things. And this is the condemnation of an evil Soul. 27. And the wickedness of a Soul is ignorance ; for the Soul that knows nothing of the things that are, neither the Nature of them, nor that which is good, but is blinded, rusheth and dasheth against the bodily Passions, and unhappy as it is, not knowing itself, it serveth strange Bodies, and evil ones, carrying the Body as a burthen, and not ruling, but ruled. And this is the mischief of the Soul. 28. On the contrary, the virtue of the Soul is Know- ledge ; for he that knows is both good and religious, and already Divine. 29. TAT. But who is such a one, 0 Father? 30. TRISM. He that neither speaks, nor hears many things ; for he, 0 Son, that heareth two speeches or hearings, fighteth in the shadow. I. For God, and the Father, and Good, is neither spoken nor heard. 32. This being so in all things that are, are the Senses, because they cannot be without them. 33. But Knowledge differs much from Sense ; for Sense is of things that surmount it, but Knowledge is the end of Sense. 34. Knowledge is the gift of God ; for all Knowledge is unbodily but useth the Mind as an Instrument, as the Mind useth the Body. 35. Therefore both intelligible and material things go both of them into bodies ; for, of contraposition, That is Setting One against Another, and Contrariety, all Things must Consist. And it is impossible it should be otherwise, 36. TAT. Who therefore is this material God ? 37. TRISM.

And it was once made and is always, and is ever in generation, and made, and continually makes, or generates things that have quantity and quality. 38. For it is moveable, and every material motion is generation ; but the intellectual stability moves the material motion after this manner. 39. Because the World is a Sphere, that is a Head, and above the head there is nothing material, as beneath the feet there is nothing intellectual. 40. The whole universe is matkrial ; The Mind is the head, and it is moved spherically, that is like a head. 41. Whatsoever therefore is joined or united to the Membrane or Film of this head, wherein the Soul is, is immortal, and as in the Soul of a made Body, hath its Soul full of the Body ; but those that are further from that Membrane, have the Body full of Soul. 42. The whole is a living wight, and therefore con- sisteth of material and intellectual. 43. And the World is the first, and Man the second living wight after the World; but the first of things that are mortal and therefore hath whatsoever benefit of the Soul all the others have : And yet for all this, he is not only not good, but flatly evil, as being mortal. 44. For the World is nor good as it is moveable ; nor evil as it is immortal. 45. But man is evil, both as he is moveable, and as he is mortal. 46. But the Soul of Man is carried in this manner, The Mind is in Reason, Reason in the Soul, the Soul in the Spirit, the Spirit in'the Body. 47. The Spirit being diffused and going through the veins, and arteries, and blood, both moveth the living Creature, and after a certain nanner beareth it. 48. Wherefore some also have thought the Soul to be blood, being deceived in Nature, not 'knowing that first the bpirit must return into the Soul, and then the blood is congealed, the veins and arteries emptied, and"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"then the living thing dieth : And this is the death of the Body. 49. All things depend of one beginning, and the beginning depends of that which is one and alone. 50. And the beginning is moved, that it may again be a beginning ; but that which is one, standeth and abideth, and is not moved, 51- There are therefore these three, God the Fatlier, and the Good, the World and Man: God hath the World, and the World hath Man ; and the World is the Son of God, and Alan as it were the Offspring of the World. 52. For God is not ignorant of Man, but knows him perfectly, and will be known by him. This only is healthful to man ; the Knowledge of God : this is the return of Olympus ; by this only the Soul is made good, and not sometimes good, and sometinles evil, but of - necessity Good. 53. TAT. What meanest thou, 0 Father ? 54. TRISM. Consider, 0 Son, the Soul of a Child, when as yet it hath received no dissolution of its Body, which is not yet grown, but is very small; how then if it look upon itself, it sees itself beautiful, as not having been yet spotted with the Passions of the Body, but as it were depending yet upon the Soul of the World. 55. But when the Body is grown and distracteth, the Soul it engenders Forgetfulness, and partakes no more of the Fair and the Good, and Forgetfulness is Evilness. 56. The like also happeneth to them that go out of the Body: for when the Soul runs back into itself the Spirit is contracted into the blood and t lie Soul into the spirit; but the Mind being made pure, and free from these clothings ; and being Divine by Nature, taking a fiery Body rangeth abroad in every place, leaving the Soul to judgment, and to the punishment it hath deserved. 57. TAT. Why dost thou say so, 0 Father, that the Mind is separated frotn the Soul, and the Soul from the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Spirit ? When even now thou saidst the Soul was the Clothing or Apparel of the Mind, and the Body of the Soul. 58. TKISM. 0 Son, he that hears must co-under- stand and conspire in thought with him that speaks ; yea, he must have his hearing swifter and sharper than the voice of the speaker. 59. The disposition of these Clothings or Covers, is done in an Earthly Body ; for it is impossible, that the Mind should establish or rest itself, naked, and of itself; in an Earthly Body; neither is the Earthly Body able to bear such immortality ; and therefore that it might suffer so great virtue the Mind con~pacted as it were, and took to itself the passible Body of the Soul, as a Covering or Clothing. And the Soul being also in some sort Divine, useth the Spirit as her Minister and Servant, and the Spirit governeth the living thing. 60. When therefore the Mind is separated, and de- yarteth from the earthly Body, presently it puts on its Fiery Coat, which it could not do having to dwell in an Earthly Body. 61. For the Earth cannot suffer fire, for it is all burned of a sniall spark; therefore is the water poured round about the Earth, as a Wall or defence, to with- stand the flame of fire. 62. But the Mind being the most sharp or swift of all the Divine Cogitatiocs, and more swift than all the Elements, hath the fire for its Eody. 63. For the Mind which is the Workman of all, useth the fire as his instrument in his Workn~anship ; and he that is the Workman of all, useth it to the mak- ing of all things, as it is used by man, to the making of Earthly things only ; for the Mind that is upon Earth, void, o; naked of fire, cannot do the business of men, nor that which is otherwise the affairs of God. 64. But the Soul of Man, and yet not every one, but that which is pious and religious, is Angelical and Divine. And such a Soul, after it is departed from the"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Body, having striven the strife of Piety, becomes either Mind or God. 65. And the strife of Piety is to know God, and to injure no Man, and this way it becomes Mind. 66. But an impious Soul abideth in its own essence, punished of itself, and seeking an earthly and human Body to enter into. 67. For no other Body is capable of a Human Soul, neither is it lawful for a Man's Soul to fall into the Body of an unreasonable living thing: for it is the Law or Decree of God, to preserve a Hunlan Soul from so great a contumely and reproach. 68. TAT. HOW then is the Soul of Man punished, 0 Father ; and what is its greatest torment. 69. HERM. Impiety, 0 my Son ; for what Fire hath so great a flame as it ? Or what biting Beast doth so tear the Body as it doth the Soul. 70. Or dost thou not see how many evils the wicked Soul suffereth, roaring and crying out, I am Burned, I am Consun~ed, I know not what to Say, or Do, I am Devoured, Unhappy Wretch, of the Evils that compass and lay hold upon me ; Miserable that I am, I neither See nor Hear anything. 71. These are the voices of a punished and tormented Soul, and not as many ; and thou, 0 Son, thinkest that the Soul going out of the Body grows brutish or enters into a Beast : which is a very great Error, for the Soul punished after this manner. 72. For the Mind, when it is ordered or appointed to get a fiery Body for the services of God, coming down into the wicked Soul, torments it with the whips of Sins, wherewith the wicked Soul being scourged, turns itself to Murders, and Contumelies, and Blasphemies, and divers Violences, and other things by which men are injured. 73. But into a pious Soul, the Mind entering, leads it into the Light of Knowledge. 74. And such a Soul is never satisfied with singing"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"praise to God, and speaking well of all men ; and both in words and deeds, always doing good in imitation of her Father. 75. Therefore, O Son, we must give thanks, and pray, that we may obtain a good mind. 76. The Soul therefore may be altered or changed into the better, but into the worse it is impossible. 77. But there is a cornmunion of Souls, and those of Gods, conm~unicate with those of men ; and those of men, with those of Beasts. 78. And the better always take of the worse, Gods of Men, Men of brute Beasts, but God of all : For he is the best of all, and all thing are less than he. 79. Therefore is the \\4'orld subject unto God, Man unto the World and unreasonable things to Man. 80. But God is above all, and about all ; and the bea~ns of God are operations; and the beams of the World are Natures ; and the beams of Man are Arts and Sciences. 81. And Operations do act by the World, and upon man by the natural beams of the World, but Natures work by the Elements, and man by Arts and -. Sciences. 82. And this is the Government of the whole, depend- ing upon the Nature of the One, and piercing or coming down by the One Mind, than which nothing is more Divine, and more efficacious or operative ; and nothing more uniting, or nothing is more One. The Commu- nion of Gods to Men, and of Men to God. 83. This is the Bonus Genius, or good Demon, blessed Soul that is fullest of it ! and unhappy Soul that is empty of it ! 84. TAT. And wherefore Father ? 85. TRISM. Know Son, that every Soul hath the Good Mind; for of that it is we now speak, and not of that Minister of which we said before, That he was sent from the Judgment. 86. For the Soul without the Mind, can neither do,"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"nor say any thing ; for many times the Mind flies away from the Soul, and in that hour the Soul neither seeth nor heareth, but is like an unreasonable thing; SO great is the power of the Mind. 87. But neither brooketh it an idle or lazy Soul, but leaves such a one fastened to the Body, and by it pressed down. 88. And such a Soul, 0 Son, hath no mind, where- fore neither must such a one be called a Man. 89. For man is a Divine living thing, and is not to be compared to any brute Beast that lives upon Earth, but to them that are above in Heaven, that are called Gods. go.

This Discourse I will also make to thee, 0 Tat, that thou mayest not be ignorant of the more excellent Name of God. 2. But do thou contemplate in thy Mind, how that which to many seems hidden and unmanifest, may be most manifest unto thee. 3. For it were not all, if it were apparent, for what- soever is apparent, is generated or made ; for it was made manifest, but that which is not manifest is ever. 4. For it needeth not to be manifested, for it is always. 5. And he maketh all other things manifest, being untnanifest as being always, and making other things manifest, he is not made manifest. g. Himself is not made, yet in fantasy he fantasieth all things, or in appearance he maketh them appear, for appearance is only of those things that are generated or made, for appearance is nothing but generation. 7. But he is that One, that is not made nor generated, is also unapparent and unmanifest. I But making all things appear, he appeareth in all and by all ; but especially he is manifested to, or in those things wherein himself listeth. g.

For the Lord, void of envy, appearetl~ through the whole world. Thou n~ayest see the intelligence, and take it in thy hands, and contemplate the Image of God. 12. But if that which is in thee, be not known or apparent unto thee, how shall he in thee be seen, and appear unto thee by the eyes ? 13. But if thou wilt see him, consider and understand the Sun, consider the course of the Moon, consider the order of the Stars. 14. Who is he that keepeth order ? for all order is circumscribed or terminated in number and place. 15. The Sun is the greatest of the Gods in heaven, to whom all the heavenly Gods give place, as to a King and potentate ; and yet he being such a one, greater than the Earth or the Sea, is content to suffer infinite lesser stars to walk and move above himself ; whom doth he fear the while, O Son ? 16. Every one of these Stars that are in Heaven, do not make the like, or an equal course; who is it that hath prescribed unto every one, the manner and the greatness of their course ? 17.

Good, 0 Asclepius, is in nothing but in God alone ; or rather God himself is the Good always. 2. And if it be so, then must he be an Essence or Substance void of all motion and generation ; but - nothing is void or empty of him. 3. And this Essence hath about or in himself a Stable, and firm Operation, wanting nothing, most full, and giving abundantly. 4. One thing is the Beginning of all things, for it giveth all things; and when 1 name the Good, I mean that which is altogether and always Good. 5. This is present to none, but God alone ; for he wanteth nothing, that he should desire to have it, nor can anything be taken from him ; the loss whereof may grieve him ; for sorrow is a part of evilness. 6. Nothing is stronger than he, that he should be opposed by it ; nor nothing equal to him, that he should be in love with it ; nothing unheard of to be angry, with nothing wiser to be envious at. 7. And none of these being in his Essence, what remains, but only the Good ? 8. For as in this, being such an Essence, there is none of the evils ; so in none of the other things shall the Good be found. 9. For in all other things, are all those other things as well in the small as the great ; and as well in the particulars as in this living Creature the greater and mightiest of all. 10. For all things that are made or generated are"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"full of Passion, Generation itself being a Passion ; and where Passion is there is not the Good; where the Good is, there is no Passion ; where it is day, it is not night, and where it is night, it is not day. 11. Wherefore it is in~possible, that in Generation should be the Good, but only in that which is not gener- ated or made. 12. Yet as the Participation of all things is in the Matter bound, so also of that which is Good. After this manner is the World good, as it nlaketh all things, and in the part of making or doing it is Good, but in all other things not good. 13. For it is passible, and ~novable, and the Maker of passible things. 14. In Man also the Good is ordered (or Taketh De- nomination) in comparison of that which is evil ; for that which is not very evil, is here good; and that which is here called Good, is the least particle, or proportion of evil. 15. It is impossible therefore, that the Good should be here pure from Evil ; for here the Good groweth Evil, and growing Evil, it doth not still abide Good ; and not abiding Good it becomes Evil. 16. Therefore in God alone is the Good, or rather God is the Good. 17. Therefore, 0 Asclepius, there is nothing in men (or among Men) but the name of Good, the thing itself is not, for it is impossible; for a material Body receiveth (or Comprehendeth), is not as being on every side en- compassed and coarcted with evilness, and labours, and griefs, and desires, and wrath, and deceits, and foolish opinions. - 18. And in that which is the worst of all, Asclepius, every one of the forenamed things, is here believed to be the greatest good, especially that supreme mischief the pleasures of the Belly, and the ring-leader of all evils ; Error is here the absence of the Good. 19. And I give thanks unto God, that concerning"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"the knowledge of Good, put this assurance in my mind, that it is inlpossible it should he in the World. 20. For the World is the fulness of evilness ; but God is the fulness of Good, or Good of God. 2 I. For the eminencies of all appearing Beauty, are in the Essence more pure, more sincere, and peradventure they are also the Essence of it. 22. For we must be bold to say, Asclepius, that the Essence of God, if he have an Essence, is that which is fair or beautiful; but no good is comprehended in this World. 23. For all things that are subject to the eye, are Idols, and as it were shadows ; but those things that are not stibject to the eye, are ever, especially t!le Essence of the Fair and the Good. ?4. And as the eye cannot see God, so neither the Fair, and the Good. 25. For these are the parts of God that partake the Nature of the whole, proper, and familiar unto him alone, inseparable, most lovely, whereof either God is enamoured, or they are enamoured of God. 26. If thou canst understand God, thou shalt un- derstand the Fair, and the Good which is most shining, and enlightening, and most enlightened by God. 27. For that Beauty is above comparison, and that Good is inimitable, as God himself. 28. As therefore thou understandest God, so under- stand the Fair and the Good, for these are incommuni- cable to any other living Creatures because they are inseparable from God. 29. If thou seek concerning God, thou seekest or askest also of the Fair, for there is one way that leads to the same thing, that is Piety with Knowledge. 30. Wherefore, they that are ignorant, and go not in the way of Piety, dare call Man Fair and Good, never seeing so much as in a dream, what Good is ; but being enfolded and wrapped upon all evil, and believing that the evil is the Good, they by that means, both use it"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"unsatiably, and are afraid to be deprived of it; and therefore they strive by all possible means, that they may not only have it, but also increase it. 31.

Confessedly. 19. HERM. Therefore the place is unbodily; but that which is unbodily, is either some Divine thing or God himself. And by some thing Divine, I do not mean that which was made or begotten. 20. If therefore it be Divine, it is an Essence or Substance ; but if it be God, it is above Essence ; but he is otherwise intelligible. 21. For the first, God is intelligible, not to himself, but to us, for that which is intelligible, is subject to that which understandeth by Sense. 22. Therefore God is not intelligible to himself, for not being- any other thing from that which is understood, he cannot be understood by himself. 23. But he is another thing from us, and therefore he is understood by us. 24. If therefore Place he intelligible, it is not Place but God, but if God be intelligible, he is intelligible not as Place, but as a capable Operation. 25. Now everything that is moved, is moved, not in or by that which is moved, but in that which standeth or resteth, and that which moveth standeth or resteth, for it is impossible it should be moved with it. 26.

But the Circulation which is about the same, and the motion about the same, are both hidden by Station ; for that which is about the same forbids that which is above the same, if it stand to that which is about the same. 34. And so the contrary motion stands fast always, belng always established by the contrariety. 35. But I will give thee concerning this matter, an earthly example that may be seen with eyes. 36. Look upon any of these living Creatures upon Earth, as Man for example, and see him swimming ; for as the Water is carried one way, the reluctation or resistance of his feet and hands is made a station to the man, that he should not be carried with the Water, nor sink underneath it. 37. ASCLEP. Thou hast laid down a very clear example, Trismegistus. 38. HERM. Therefore every motion is in station, and is moved of station. 39. The motion then of the World, and of every material living thing, happeneth not to be done by those things that are without the World, but by those things within it, a Soul, or Spirit, or some other unbodily thing, to those things which are without it. 40.

What is that incorporeal or unbodily ? 58. HERM. The Mind and Reason, the whole, wholly comprehending itself, free from all Body, unde- ceivable, invisible, impassible from a Body itself, stand- ing fast in itself, capable of all things, and that favour of the things that are. 59. Whereof the Good, the Truth, the Archetypal Light, the Archetype of the Soul, are as it were Beams. 60. ASCLEP. Why then, what is God? 61. HER~I. That which is none of these things, yet is, and is the cause of Being to all ; and every one of the things that are; for he left nothing destitute of Being. 62. And all things are made of things that are, and not of things that are not ; for the things that are not, have not the nature to be able to be made; and again, the things that are, have not the nature never to be, or not to be at all. 63.

In Word it is often said by all men the Good, but all men do not understand what it is; but through Ignorance they call both the Gods, and some men Good, that can never either be or be made so. 73. Therefore all the other Gods are honoured with the title and appellation of God, but God is the Good, not according to Heaven, but Nature. 74. For there is one Nature of God, even the Good, and one kind of them both, from whence are all kinds. 75.

Therefore, 0 Asclepius, ne;er congratulate any man that is childless ; but on the contrary, pity his aisfortune, knowing what punishment abides, and is prepared for him. 80.

HERM. A11 things, 0 Son, are the work of Fate, and without it, can no bodily thing, either Good or Evil, be done. 25. For it is decreed by Fate, that he that doth any evil, should also suffer for it. 26. And therefore he doth it, that he may suffer that which he suffereth, because he did it. 27: But for the present let alone that speech, con- cerning Evil and Fate, for at other times we have spoken of it. 28. Now our discourse is about the Mind, and what it can do, and how it differs, and is in men such a one, but in brute Beasts changed. 19. And again, in Brute Beasts it is not beneficial, but in men by quenching both their Anger and Concu- piscence~. 30. And of men thou must understand some to be rational or governed by reason, and some irrational. 31. But all men are subject to Fate, and to Genera- tion, and Changes, for these are the beginning and end of Fate or Destinv. 32. And all mkn suffer those things that are decreed by Fate. 33. But rational men, over whom as we said, the Mind bears rule, do not suffer like unto other men ; but being free from viciousness, and being not evil, they do suffer evil. 34. TAT. HOW sayest thou this again, Father ? An Adulterer, is he not evil ? a Murderer, is he not evil ? and so all others. 35. HERM. But the rational man, 0 Son, will not suffer for Adultery, but as the Adulterer, nor for Mur- der, but as the Murderer. 36. And it is impossible to escape the Quality of Change, as of Generation, but the Viciousness, he that hath the Mind, may escape. 37. And therefore, 0 Son, I have always heard the good Demon say, and if he had delivered it in writing,"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"he had much profited all mankind : For he alone, 0 Son. as the first born, God, seeing all things, truly spake Divine words. I have heard him say sometimes, That all Things are one thing, Especially Intelligible Bodies, or that all Especially Intelligible Bodies are one. 38. We live in Power, in Act and in Eternity. 39. Therefore a good Mind, is that which the Soul of him is. 40. And if this be so, then no intelligble thing differs from intelligible things. .?-I . As therefore it is possible, that the Mind, the Prince of all things ; so likewise, that the Soul that is of God, can do whatsoever it will. 42. But understand ,thou well, for this Discourse I have made to the question which thou askest of me before, I mean concerning Fate and the Mind. 43. First, if, 0 Son, thou shalt diligently withdraw thy self from all Contentious speeches, thou shalt find that in Truth, the Mind, the Soul of God bears rule over all things, both over Fate and Law and all other things. 44. And nothing is impossible to him, no not of the things that are of Fate. .. 45. Therefore, though the Soul of man be above it, let it not neglect the things that happen to be under Fate. 46. And these thus far, were the excellent sayings of the good Demon. 47. TAT. Most divinely spoken, 0 Father, and truly and profitably, yet clear this one thing unto me 48. Thou sayest, that in brute Beasts the Mind worketh or acteth after the manner of Nature, co- operating also with their (impetus) inclinations. 49. Now the impetuous inclinations of brute Beasts, as I conceive, are Passions. If therefore the Mind do co- operate with these impetuous Inclinations, and that they are the Passions in brute Beasts, certainly the Mind is also a Passion, conforming itself to Passions."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"50. HERM. 1Vell done, Son, thou askest nobly, and yet it is just that I should answer thee. 51. All incorporeal things, 0 Son, that are in the Body, are possible, nay, they are properly Passions. 52. Everything that moveth is incorporeal ; every- thing that is moved is a Hody ; and it is moved into the Bodies by the Mind. NOW motion is Passion, and there they both suffer ; as well that which xnoveth, as that which is moved, as well that which ruleth, as that which is ruled. 53. But being freed from the Body, it is freed like- wise irom Passion. 54. But especially, 0 Son, there is nothing impas- sible, but all things are passible. 55. But Passion differs from that which is passible, for that (Passion) acteth but this suffers. 56. Bodies also of themselves do act, for either they are unnlovable, or else are moved ; and which soever it be, it is a Passion. 57. But incorporeal things do always act, or work, and therefore they are passible. 58. Let not therefore the appellations or names trouble thee, for Action and Passion are the same thing, but that it is not grievous to use the more honourable name, 59. TAT. 0 Father. thou has delivered this Dis- course most plainly. 60. HERM. Consider this also, 0 Son, That God hath freely bestowed upon man, above all other living things, these two, to wit, Mind and Speech, or Reason, equal to immortality. 61. These if any man use, or employ upon what he ought, he shall differ nothing from the Immortals. 62. Yea, rather going out of the Body, he shall be guided and led by them, both into the Choir and Society of the Gods, and blessed Ones. 63. TAT. DO not other living Creatures use Speech, 0 Father ?"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"64. HERM. NO, Son, but only Voice ; now Speech and Voice do differ exceeding much ; for Speech is common to all men, but Voice is proper unto every kind of living thing. 65. TAT. Yea, but the Speech of men is different. 0 Father, every man according to his Nation. 66. HERM. It is true, 0 Son, they do differ: Yet as man is one so is Speech one also ; and it is interpreted and found the same, both in Egypt, Persia, and Greece. 67. But thou seemest unto me, Son, to be ignorant. of the Virtue or Power, and Greatness of Speech. 68. For the blessed God, the good Demon said or commanded the Soul to be in the Body, the Mind, in the Soul, the Word, or Speech, or Reason in the Mind, and the Mind in God, and that God is the Father of them all. 69. Therefore the Word is the Image of the Mind, and the Mind of God, and the Body of the Idea; and the Idea of the Soul. 70. Therefore of the Matter, the subtlest or smallest part is Air, of the Air the Soul, of the Soul the Mind, of the Mind God. 71. And God is about all things, and through all things, but the Mind about the Soul, the Soul about the Air, and the Air about the Matter. 72. But Necessity, and Providence, and Nature, are the Organs or Instruments of the World, and of the Order of Matter. 73: For of those things that are intelligible, every one is but the Essence of them in Identity. 74. But of the Bodies of the whole, or universe, every one is many things. 75. For the Bodies that are put together, and that have, and make their changes into other, having this Identity, do always save and preserve the uncorruption of the Identity. 76.

But this whole World, the great God, and the Image of the Greater, and united unto him, and con- serving the Order and Will of the Father, is the fulness of Life. 81, And there is nothing therein, through all the Eternity of the Revolutions, neither of the whole, nor of the parts which doth not live. 82. For there is nothing dead, that either hath been, or is, or shall be in the World. 83. For the Father would have it as long as it lasts, to be a living thing ; and therefore it must needs be God also, 84. How therefore, 0 Son, can there be in God, in the Image of the Universe, in the fulness of Life, any dead things ? 85. For dying is corruption, and corruption is destruction. 86. How then can any part of the incorruptible be corrupted, or of God be destroyed ? 87. TAT. Therefore, 0 Father, do not the living things in the World die, though they be parts thereof. 88. HERM. Be wary in thy Speech, 0 Son, and not deceived in the names of things. 89. For they do not die, 0 Son, but as compound Bodies they are dissolved. 90. But dissolution is not death ; and they are dis- solved, not that they may be destroyed, but that they may be made new. 91. TAT. What then is the operation of Life ? Is it not Motion ? 92. HERM.

What a ridiculous thing it were, that the Nurse of all things should be unmovable, which beareth and bringeth forth all things. 96. For it is impossible, that anything that bringeth forth, should bring forth without Motion. 97. And a ridiculous question it is, Whether the fourth part of the whole, be idle: For the word immovable, or without Motion, signifies nothing else, but idleness. 98. Know generally, 0 Son, That whatsoever is in the World is moved either according to Augmentation or Diminution. 99. But that which is moved, liveth also, yet it is not necessary, that a living thing should be or continue the same. 100. For while the whole World is together, it is unchangeable, 0 Son, but all the parts thereof are changeable. 101. Yet nothing is corrupted or destroyed, and quite abolished but the names trouble nien. 102. For Generation is not Life, but Sense ; neither is Change Death, but Forgetfulness, or rather Occulta- tion, and lying hid. Or better thus.

And of which soever the choice is made, the other being diminished or overcome, magnifieth the act and operation of the other. 31.

For the Good is not to be transcended, it is un- bounded and infinite ; unto itself without beginning, but unto us, seeming to have a beginning, even our knowledge of it. 37.

For these things that hppear, delight us, but make the things that appear not, hard to believe, or the Things that Appear not, are Hard to believe. 41.

I. Yesterday, Asclepius, I delivered a perfect Discourse ; but now I think it necessary, in suite of that, to dispute also of Sense. 2. For Sense and Understanding seem to differ, because the one is material, the other essential. 3. But unto me, they appear to be both one, or united, and not divided in men, I mean. 4. For in other living Creatures, Sense is united unto Nature but in men to Understanding. 5. But the Mind differs from Understanding, as much as God from Divinity. 6. For Divinity is from or under God, and Under- standing from the Mind, being the sister of the Word or Speech, and they the Instruments one of another. 7. For neither is the Word pronounced without Understanding, neither is Understanding manifested without the Word. 8. Therefore Sense-and Understanding do both flow together into a man, as if they were infolded one within another. 9. For neither is it possible without Sense to Under- stand, nor can we have Sense without Understanding. 10. And yet it is possible (for the Time being) that the Understanding may understand without Sense, as they that fantasy Visions in their Dreams. 11. But it seems unto me, that both the operations"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"are in the Visions of Dreams, and that the Sense is stirred up out of sleep, unto awaking. 12. For man is divided into a Body and a Soul ; when both parts of the Sense accord one with another, then is the understanding childed, or brought forth by the Mind pronounced. 13. For the Mind brings forth all Intellections or Understandings. Good ones when it receiveth good Seed from God ; and the contrary when it receives them from Devils. 14. For there is no part of the World void of the Devil, which entering in privately, sowed the seed of his own proper operation ; and the Mind did make preg- nant, or did bring forth that which was sown, Adulteries, Murders, Striking of Parents, Sacrileges, Impieties, Stranglings, throwing down headlong, and all other things which are the works of evil Demons. 1.5. And the Seeds of God are few but Great, and Fair, and Good Virtue, and Temperance, and Piety. 16. And the Piety is the Knowiedge of God, whom whosoever knoweth being full of all good things, hath Divine Understanding and not like the Many. 17. And therefore they that have that -~nowled~e neither please the multitude, nor the multitude them, but they seem to be mad, and to move laughter, hated and despised, and many times also murdered. 18. For we have already said, That wickedness must dwell here, being in her own region. 19. For her region is the Earth, and not the World, as some will sometimes say, Blaspheming. 20. But the Godly or God-worshipping Man laying hold on Knowledge, will despise or tread under all these things ; for though they be evil to other men, yet to him all things are good. 21. And upon mature consideration, he refers all things to Knowledge, and that which is most to be wondered at, he alone makes evil things good. 22. But I return again to my Discourse of Sense."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"23. It is therefore a thing proper to Man, to commu- nicate and conjoin Sense and Understanding. 24. But every man, as I said before, doth not enjoy Understanding; for one man is material, another essential. 25.

For God is the Workman of all things; and when he worketh he useth Nature. 27. He maketh all things good like himself. 28. But these things that are made good, are in the use of Operation, unlawful. 29. For the Motion of the World stirring up Genera- tions, makes Qualities, infecting some with evilness, and purifying some with good. 30. And the World, Asclepius, hath a peculiar Sense and Understanding, not like to Man's, nor so various or manifold, but a better and more simple. 31. For this Sense and Understanding of the World is One, in that it makes all things, and unmakes then1 again into itself; for it is the organ or Instrument of the Will of God. 32- And it is so organized or framed, and made for an Instrument by God ; that receiving all Seeds into itself from God, and keeping them in itself, it maketh all things effectually and dissolving them, renewet h all things. 33. And therefore like a good Husband-man of Life, when things are dissolved or loosened, he affords by the casting of Seed, renovation to all things that grow. 34. There is nothing that it (the World) doth not beget or bring forth alive ; and by its Motion, it makes all things alive. 35. And it is at once, both the Place and the Work- man of Life. 36.

They that are con~pounded, are the heavier, and they that are less, are the higher. 38. And the swiftness of the Motion of the ITJorld, makes the varieties of the Qualities of Generation, for the spiration or influence, being most frequent, extend- eth unto the Bodies qualities with one f~~lness, which is of Life. 39. Therefore, God is the Father of the World, but the World is the Father of things in the World. 40. And the World is the Son of God, but things in the World are the Sons of the World. 41 And therefore it is well called the World, that is an Ornament, because it adorneth and beautifieth all things with the variety of Generation, and indeficiency of Life, which the unweariedness of Operation, and the swiftness of Necessity with the mingling of Elements, and the order of things done. 42- Therefore it 'ils necessarily and properly called the World. 43. For of all living things, both the Sense and the Understanding, cometh into them from without, in- spired by that which con~passeth them about, and con- tinueth them. 44. And the World receiving it once from God as soon as it was made, hath it still, What Ever it Once Had. 45. But God is not as it seems to some who Blaspheme through superstition, without Sense, and without Mind. or Understanding. 46. For all things that are, 6 Asclepius, are in God, and made by him, and depend of him, some working by Bodies, some moving by a Soul-like Essence, some quickening by a Spirit, and some receiving the things that are weary, and all very fitly. 47.

And by this reason, it follows, that the Bodies also are always, because I affirm : That this corporiety is always by the Act and Operation, or for them. 1.5. For although earthly bodies be subject to disso- lution; yet these bodies must be the Places, and the Organs, and Instruments of Acts or Operations. 16. But Acts or Operations are immortal, and that which is immortal, is always in Act, and therefore also Corporification if it be always. 17. Acts or Operations do follow the Soul, yet come not suddenly or promiscuously, but some of them come together with being made man, being about brutish or unreasonable things. 18. But 'the purer Operations do insensibly in the change of time, work with the oblique part of the Soul. 19. And these Operations depend upon Bodies ; and truly they that are Corporifying come from the Divine Bodies into Mortal ones. 20. But every one of them acteth both about the Body and the Soul, and are present with the Soul, even without the Body."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"21. And they are always Acts or Operations, but the Soul is not always in a Mortal Body, for it can be without a Body, but Acts or Operations cannot be with- out Bodies. 22. This is a sacred speech, Son, the Body cannot Consist without a Soul. 23. TAT. HOW meanest thou that, Father ? 24.. HERM. Understand it thus, 0 Tat, When the Soul is separated from the Body, there remaineth that same Body. 25. ~nd this same Body according to the time of its abode, is actuated or operated in that it is dissolved and becomes invisible. 26. And these things the Body cannot suffer without act or operation, and consequently there remaineth with the Body the same act or operation. 27. This then is the difference between an Immortal Body, and a Mortal one, that the immortal one consists of one Matter, and so doth not the mortal one ; and the immortal one doth, but this suffereth. 28. Arid everything that acteth or operateth is stronger, and ruleth; but that which is actuated or operated, is ruled. - zg. And that which ruleth, directeth and governeth as free, but the other is ruled, a servant. 30.

Act or Operation, 0 Son, is called, whatsoever is, or is made or done, and there are always many things made, or rather all things. 32. For the World is never widowed or forsaken of any of those things that are, but being always carried or moved in itself, it is in labour to bring forth the things that are, which shall never be left by it to corruption."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"33. Let therefore every act or operation be under- stood to he always immortal, in what manner of Body Soever it be. 34. But some Acts or Operations be of Divine, some of corruptible Bodies, some universal, some pecu- liar, and some of the generals, and some of the parts of every thing. 35. Divine Acts or Operations therefore there be, and such as work or operate upon their proper Bodies, and these also are perfect, and being upon or in perfect Bodies. 36. Particular are they which work by any of the living Creatures. 37. Proper, be they that work upon any of the things that are. 38. By this Discourse, therefore, O Son, it is gathered that all things are full of Acts or Operations. 39. For if necessarily they be in every Body, and that there be many Bodies in the World, I may very well affirm, that there be many other Acts or Opera- tions. 40. For many times in one Body, there is one, and a second, and a third, besides these universal ones that follow. 41. And universal Operations, I call them that are indeed bodily, and are done by the Senses and Motions. 420 For without these it is impossible that the Body should consist. 43. But other Operations are proper to the Souls of Men, by Arts, Sciences, Studies, and Actions. 44. The Senses also follow these Operations, or rather are the effects or perfections of them. 45, Understand therefore, 0 Son, the difference of Operations, it is sent from above. 46.

But mortal things themselves have not Sense, as Not consisting of such an Essence. 49. For Sense can be no other than a corporeal apprehension, either of evil or good that comes to the Bodv. J 50. But to Eternal Bodies there is nothing comes, nothing departs ; therefore there is no sense in them. 51. TAT. Doth the Sense therefore perceive or apprehend in every Body. 52. HERM. In every Body, 0 Son. 53. TAT. And do the Acts or Operations work in all things ? 54. HERM. Even in things inanimate, 0 Son, but there are differences of Senses. 55. For the Senses of things rational, &re with Reason ; of things unreasonable, Corporeal only, but the Senses of things inanimate are passive only, accord- ing to Augmentation and Diminution. I - 56. But Passion and Sense depend both upon one head, or height, and are gathered together into the same, by Acts or Operations. 57. But in living wights there be two other Opera- tions that follow tile Senses and Passions, to wit, Grief and Pleasure. 58. And without these, it is impossible that a living wight, especially a reasonable one, should perceive or apprehend. 59: And therefore, I say, tkat these are the ideas of Yassions that bear rule, especially in reasonable living wights. 60. The Operations work indeed, but the Senses do declare and manifest the Operations, and they being bodily, are moved by the brutish parts of the Soul ; therefore [ I say, they are both mnleficial or doers of evil. 61.

OF TRUTH TO HIS SON TAT. I. HERM. Of Truth, 0 Tat, it is not possible that man being an imperfect wight, conlpounded of imperfect Meinbers, and having his Tabernacle consisting of different and many Bodies, should speak with any confidence. 2. But as far as it is possible, and just, I say, That Truth is only in the Eternal Bodies, whose very Bodies be also true. 3. The Fire is fire itself only, and ncthing else ; the Earth is earth itself and nothing else ; the air is air itself and nothing else ; the water, water itself and nothing else. 4. But our Bodies consist of all these ; for they have of the Fire, they have of the Earth, they have of the Water, and Air, and yet there is neither Fire, nor Earth, nor Water, nor Air, nor anything true. 5. And if at the Beginning our Constitution had not Truth, how could men either see the Truth, or speak it, or understand it only, except God would ? 6. All things therefore upon Earth, 0 Tat, are not Truth, but imitations of the Truth, and yet not all things neither, for they are but few that are so. 7.

As many therefore as see not Falsehood, see the Truth. I r. If therefore we do SO understand, and see every one of these things as it is, then we see and understand true things. 12. But if we see or understand any thing besides, or otherwise than that which is, we shall neither under- stand, nor know the Truth. 13. TAT. IS Truth thereforevpon Earth, 0 Father ? 14. HERM. Thou dost not miss the mark, 0 Son. Truth indeed is nowhere at all upon Earth, 0 Tat, for it cannot be generated or made. 15.

But man consists of many things and doth not abide of himself but is turned and changed, age after age, Idea after Idea, or form after form, and this while he is yet in the Tabernacle. 28. And many have not known their own children after a little while, and many children likewise have not known their own Parents. 29.

Consequently the things that are generated of Corruption are false, as being sometimes one thing, sometimes another : For it is impossible they should be made the same things again, and that which is not the same, how is it true ? 45.

For if the World be a second God, and an Immortal living Wight, it is impossible that any part of an Inimortal living Wight should die. 5. But all things that are in the World, are meni- bers of the World, especially Man, the reasonable living Wight. 6.

And as much Matter as there was laid up by him, the Father made it all into a Body, and swelling it, made it round like a Sphere, endued it with Quality, being itself immortal, and having Eternal Materiality. 14.

Moreover, the things that are made, are visible, but he is invisible; and for this cause, he maketh them, that he may be visible ; and therefore he makes them always. I I. Thus it is fit to understand and understanding to admire and admiring to think thy self happy, that knowest thy natural Father. 12. For what is sweeter than a Natural Father? 13. UJho therefore is this, or how shall we know him ? 14. Or is it just to ascribe unto him alone, the Title and Appellation of God, or of the Maker, or of the Father, or of all Three ? That of God because of his Power ; the Maker because of his Working and Opera- tion ; and the Father, because of his Goodness. 15. For Power is different from the things that are made, but Act or Operation, in that all things are made. 16. Wherefore, letting go all much and vain talking, we must understand these two things, That Which is Made: and Him Which is the Maker ; for there is nothing in the middle, between these Two, nor is there any third. I 7. Therefore understanding All things, remember these Two; and think that these are All things, putting nothinq into doubt ; neither of the things above, nor of the things below; neither of things changeable, nor things that are in darkness or secret. 18.

For that which is generated or made, must necessarily be generated or made by another, but with- out the Maker that which is made, neither is made, nor is ; for the one of them without the other, hath lost his prbper Nature by the privation of the othkr. 22. SO if these Two be confessed, That which maketh, and that which is made, then they are One in Union, this going before, and that followlng. 23. And that which goeth before, is, God the Maker, and that which follows is, that which is made, be it what it will. 24. And let no man be afraid because of the variety of things that are made or done, lest he should cast an aspersion of baseness, or infamy upon God, for it is the only Glory of him to do, or make All things. 25. And this making, or facture is as it were the Body of God, and to him that maketh or doth, there is nothing evil, or filthy to be imputed, or There is Noth- ing thought Evil or Filthy. 26. For these are Passions that follow Generation as Rust doth Copper, or as Excrements do the Body. 27. But neither did the Copper-smith make the Rust, nor the Maker the Filth, nor God the Evilness. 28. But the vicissitude of Generation doth make them, as it were to blossom out ; and for this cause did make Change to be, as one should say, Th: Purgation of Generation. 29.

And besides their not knowing him, they are extremely impious against him, attributing unto him Passions, as Pride, or Oversight, or Weakness, or Ignurance, or Envy. 32. For if he do not make or do all things, he is either proud or not able, or ignorant, or envious, which is impGus to affirm. - 33. For God hath only one Passion, namely Good ; and he that is good is neither proud, nor impotent, nor the rest, but God is Good itself. 34. For Good is all power, to do or make all things, and every thing that is made, is made by God, that is by the Good and that can make or do all things. 35. See then how he nlaketh all things, and how the things are done, that are done, and if thou wilt learn, hou mayest see an Image thereof, very beautiful, and like. 36. Look upon the Husbandman, how he casteth Seeds into the Earth, here Wheat, there Barley, and elsewhere some other Seeds. 37. Look upon the same Man, planting a Vine, or an Apple-Tree, or a Fig-Tree, or some other Tree. 38. So doth God in Heaven sow Immortality, in the Earth Change in the whole Life, and Motion. 39.
