THE VISION OF SCIPIO C ICERO, who was almost the most celebrated orator of antiquity, was born B.C. 107, and was educated by Crassus. He served as a Roman warrior under Sylla, and subsequently became a philosopher. After many years he entered political life, becoming Quaestor of Sicily, then Edile, and finally Consul. At the last he retired to Tusculum, and was assassinated B.C. 43. He left many classical works, among which are the beautiful essays on \" Friendship \" and on \" Old Age.\" His only mvstical work was the Sonz?zizm Scifiio~zis, OY Vision of s&$~o, of which a translation by L: 0. is here Pro- duced, with an Essay upon its connection with the doctrines taught in the- ancient Mysteries. This Scipio was named Africanus the Younger ; he had died in B.C. 128 ; he was the grandson by adoption of Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus the Elder. The account of this dream or-vision is put into the mouth of the younger Scipio Africanus, who relates that, in early youth, when he first served in Africa he visited the Court of Masinissa, the steady friend of the Romans, and particularly of the Cornelian family. During the feasts and entertainments of the day, the conversation"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"turned on the words and actions of the first great Scipio. His adopted grandson having retired to rest, the Shade of the departed hero appeared to him in sleep, darkly foretold the future events of his life, and encouraged him to tread in the paths of Patriotism and true glory, by announcing the reward prepared in a future state for those who have served their country faithfully in this life. The scene is laid in the suburban garden of the younger Africanus, and the jdnmatis PEYSOI~ consist of certain intimate friends and acquaiutances. A few literary and suggestive Notes have been added,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THE VISION OF SCIPIO WHEN I came to Africa, where, as you know, I was Tribune to the Fourth Legion of soldiers, under the Consul Manius Manilius, nothing appeared to me more ,desirable than that I should meet Masinissa, a Monarch who had ever been most friendly to our family for just reasons. When I came to him, the old man, having embraced me, wept, and, after a pause, looked up to Heaven : \" Ah, thanks,\" said he, \" to Thee I render, Oh highest Sun, and to ye other Celestial companions, in that before I depart this life, I am permitted to behold in my own Kingdom and under these skies P. Cornelius Scipio, whose name itself refreshes me: for, never from my soul has the memory of that best and most invincible of men departed ! \" Then I inquired of him concerning the affairs of his Kingdom, and he of me respecting our Republic ; and our day thus passed in lengthened conference. After a royal entertainment our talk again drew out into the far night, when the old man would speak of nothing save the elder Scipio (Africanus Major) : everything about him he remem- bered, not only his deeds, but even his sayings. When, therefore, we parted to retire to rest, what with the jour~ey and our nocturnal sitting, I was more than usually tired and fell sound asleep. Whereupon (as I believe arising out of the subject of our talk ;-for it often happens that our thoughts and conversation produce some such result in sleep as that"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"which Ennius3 relates to have happened concerning Homer, whom it appears he was frequently accustomed to meditate upon and to talk about during his waking hours) Africanus appeared to me in a form4 which I recognised more from his bust than from my knowledge of the man himself. When I recognised him, I trern- bled indeed : he, however, speaking said, \" Take courage and banish fear, 0 Scipio ; commit to memory what I have to say.\" '' Seest thou yonder City, which, compelled by me to submit to the Roman people, yet renews its former wars, unable to remain at peace ? (Here he shewed me Carthage from a certain clear and brilliant spot in the celestial heights, full of stars) and to the assault of which thou comest, as yet a mere boy ? This City, in two years from the present time, thou as Consul shalt overthrow, and that hereditary name, which hitherto thou bearest from us, shall belong to thee by thine own exertions. When moreover Carthage has been razed by thee, thou shalt effect thy Triumph and be made Censor; then as Legate thou shalt proceed to Egypt, Syria, Asia and Greece, being made Consul a second time during thy absence, and undertaking thy greatest war, destroy Numantia. But when thou are borne upon the triumphal car to the Capitol, thou shalt find the Republic thrown into confusion by the policy of my grand~on.~ Here, 0 Africanus, it will be necessary for thee to display to the Fatherland the light of thy spirit, thy genius, and thy wisdom ; at this period of thy life I see but darkly the course of thy destiny, though when thine age shall have completed eight times seven circuits and returns of the Sun, thus bringing thee to the fatal epoch of thy lifeG by the natural circuit of these two numbers (each of which is held to be perfect, the one from a different reason to the other) ; to thee alone and to thy name the whole State will turn; to thee, as ~enato;, all good people, the Latin allies and"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the Latins themselves shall turn ; thou shalt be the one upon whom the whole salvation of the State shall rest, and, lest misfortune befall, it behoves thee as dictator to firmly establish the Republic if you would escape the impious hands7 of thy kinsmen : \" at this portion of the recital LaeliusH cried out and the others bitterly lamented, but Scipio, smiling slowly, said : \" I beseech you not to arouse me from slumber ; peace for a little, and hear the rest.\" '' But, 0 Africanus, in order that thou mayest be the more devoted to the welfare of the Republic, mark this well : for all those who have guarded, cherished, and assisted .their Fatherland, a particular place in Heaven is assigned, where the blessed enjoy everlasting life. For nothing on earth is more acceptable to that supreme Deity who reigns over the whole Universe, than those assemblages and combinations of men united by Law which we call States; the rulers and pre- servers whereof coming forth from this place, return thither.\" At this point, although I was thoroughly terrified, not so much by the fear of death, as by the treachery of my own kinsmen, I asked notwithstanding whether he himself was really alive and my father Paulus and others whom we believed to be annihilated ? Yea,\" said he, '' in very truth, those stilllive who have flown forth from the bonds of the body as from a prison : for indeed, what is called your life, is but a death ! TVhy,dost thounot see thy fatherPauluscoming to thee ?\" At that sight I indeed burst forth into a flood of tears : he, on the other hand, embracing, kissed me and forbade me to weep ; and then, when my tears had been repressed, and I began to be able to speak, Prithee tell me,\" said I, most revered and excellent father : Since this is life, as I have heard Africanus say, Why do I tarry upon Earth? Why do I not hasten to come hither to you ? \""},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"\" It may not be,\" he replied, \"for, unless that Deity who is the Lord of this Universe which thou beholdest, shall liberate thee from the prison of your body,1Â° hither approaching, it is not possible to come. For men are born under this Law to be faithful guardians of that Globe which thou seest in the midst of this Universe and which is called the Earth : and a Soul has been given to them from those sempiternal fires which you call Stars and Constella- tions ; these being spgerical and globular bodies, ani~nated with divine Souls, pursue their circling orbits with n~arvellous celerity. LVherefore, 0 Publius,12 both by thee and all pious persons, the Soul should he retained in the keeping of the body : not without His command, by whom that Soul is to you, must it depart from mortal life, lest you should appear to be untrue to that duty to Mankind which has been assigned to you by the Deity. But do thou cultivate justice and piety, 0 Scipio, foilowing in the steps of thy Grandsire and of myself, who begat thee. These qualities, although excellent among parents and relations, become still more nohle when practised towards one's Country : through this life lies the road to Heaven and to the assem'blage of those, who have already lived upon earth and now, released from the body, inhabit this place which thou seest (this Sphere shone forth with the most resplendent brightness amid blazing stars) and which, after the Greeks, yon call the Milky VTay. From this place all other bodies appeared to my gaze exceedingly bright and marvellous. There were, moreover, those ~t~rs which are never seen from Earth : and the mag- nitude of all of them were such as we have never sus- pected : anlong these I beheld the sn~allest~~ to be the farthest from Heaven and the nearest to Earth, shining with a borrowed Light. Moreover, the spheres of the Stars far transcended the size of the Earth. Thus, the Earth itself already appeared small to me, so that I"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"was grieved to observe how small a part of its surface we in reality As I continued to gaze steadfastly, Africanus continu- ing said, \" How long wilt thy mind remain rivetted to the Earth ? Dost thou not behold into how glorious a Temple thou art come ? Now know that the Universe consists of nine circles or rather Spheres, all connected together, one of which is celestial and the furthest off, embracing all the rest, the supreme Deity preserving and governing the others. In this sphere are traced the eternal revolutions of the Stars and to it are subject the seven spheres which revolve backwards with a contrary motion to that of the Celestial Sphere. The first (of these Seven) Spheres is occupied17 by the Star which on Earth is called Saturn. Next comes the sphere of that splendid Star, salutary and fortunate to the human race, called Jupiter. Then comes the Red Sphere, terrible to the Earth, which you call Mars. Following beneath these spheres, and in almost the middle region, is placed the Sun, the Leader, Chief and Governor of the other Lights, the mind1\" of the U70rld and the organizing principle,-of such wondrous magnitude that it illuminates and impregnates every part of the Universe with its Light. The Spheres of Venus and Mercury in their respective courses follow the Sun as companions. In the lowest Sphere the Moon revolves illumined by the rays of the Sun. Below this in truth nothing exists which is not subject to death and decay, save indeed the Souls, which by the gift of the Gods are bestowed upon the hutnan race. Above the Moon all things are eternal, but the sphere of the Earth, which occupies a middle place and comes ninthlVoes not move: it is the lowest and to it all ponderable bodies are born by their own gravity.\" When I had recovered from my amazement at the sight of these things, '' What,\" said I, is this sweet and wondrous melody which fills my ears ? \""},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"\" This,\" said he, ''is that harmony, which, affected by the mingling of unequal intervals, yet notwithstand- ing in harmonious proportions and with reason so separated, is due to the impulse and movement of the spheres themselves : the light with the heavier tones combined,-the various sounds uniformly going to make up one grand symphony.\" For, not with silence, can such niotions be urged forward, and Kature leads us to the conclusion that the extremes give forth a low note at the one end and a high note at the other. Thus the celestial sphere, whose rnotion in its starlight course is more rapid, gives forth a sharp and rousing sound : the gravest tone being that of the lunar sphere, which is lowest ; but the Earth, the ninth sphere, remains im- movable, always fixed in the lowest seat encompassing the middle place of the Universe. Moreover, the motions of those eight spheres which are above the earth, and of which the force of two2' is the same, cause seven sounds supported by regular intervals ; which number is the connecting principle of almost all things. Learned men, having imitated this divine mystery with stringed instruments and vocal har- monics, have won for thennselves a return to this place, just as others, who, endowed with superior wisdom, have cultivated the divine sciences even in human life.\" \" Now to this melody the stopped ears of men ha~re become deaf ;\" nor is there any duller sense in you. Just as at that place which is cnlled Catad~pa,~' where the Nile falls from the highest Mountains, the people living there lose the sense of hearing on account of the magnitude of the sound, so, indeed, such a tren~endous volunle of sound arises from the rapid revolution of the whole Cosmos that the ears of men are not capable of re- ceiving it, just as you are unable to look straight at the Sun whose rays mould blind the eye and conquer the 7 > sense."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Filled with wonder at these things, my eyes ever and anon wandered back to Earth. Hereupon Africanus said : \" I perceive that even now you gaze upon the habitation and abode of mortals. But, if it appear as small to thee, as indeed it is, thus seen, strive erer after these heavenly things and lightly esteem those of earth. For what glory or renown really worthy of being sought after canst thou derive from the mouths of men. Thou seest that the earth is inhabited in scattered places confined within narrow limits, such inhabited regions are in themselves mere specks upon its surface with vast wildernesses inter- vening : and those who dwell upon the earth are not only separated thus, so that no communication is possi- ble amongst them from the one to the other, but they occupy positions partly oblique, partly transverse, partly even opposite to yours; from these you can certainly hope for no glory. Also thou wilt perceive this same earth to be, as it were, circumscribed and en- circled by zones, two of which, the most widely separated and situated at each end under the very poles of heaven, are ice-bound as thou seest'\" while the middle and largest zone is burnt up with the heat of the Sun. Two zones are habitable, one of which lies to the South, those who dwell therein planting footsteps opposite to your own, and having nothing to do with your race. As to the other zone which you inhabit, and which is subject to the North wind, see how very slender a part has to do with you: for the whole surface inhabited by your race, restricted towards the poles and wider laterally, is indeed but a snlall island surrounded by the sea, which you call on earth the Atlantic, the Great Sea, or Ocean. Yet, notwithstanding its name, it is but small as thou seest. How then is it possible that from these known and cultivated countries either thy name or that of any of us can cross those Ca~lcasian Mountains, which thou seest, or pass beyond the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Ganges ? Who, in the remaining parts of the East, in the uttermost regions of the wandering Sun, either in Northern or Southern Climes, will hear thy name ? So then, with these parts taken away, dost thou indeed perceive within what narrow limits your glory seeks to spread itself; and how long even will those who sing your praises continue to do so ? \"Yea, indeed, if generations hence posterity shall seek to perpetuate the fame of anyone of us handed down from father to son, yet notwithstanding, on account of fire and flood, which will inevitably happen at certain fixed periods\" of time, we are nnable to attain lasting renown, much less eternal glory. Moreover, of what importance are the things which shall be said concern- ing thee by those to be born hereafter, when no one who existed before will then be alive ? More especially, when of those same men who are to come, not one will be able to remember the events of even one year. Now, according to common custom, men usually measure the year merely by tile return of the sun, or, in other words, by the revol~ltion of one star. But when the whole of the constellations shall return to the original positions from which they once set forth, thus restoring at long intervals the original configuration of the Heavens, then can that be truly called ' the Great Year,'\" within which period, I scarcely dare say how niany generations of men are comprised. For, just as in time past, when the Soul. of Roniulus entered into these sacred abodes, the Sun appeared to fail and be extinguished, so when the Sun shall again fail in the same position and at the same time, then, when the Signs of the Zodiac shall have returned to their original ?osition, and the Stars are recalled, the cycle of the Great Year shall be accon~plished ; of this enormous period of time, know that not a twentieth part has yet passed away.2H \" Wherefore, if thou despairest of a speedy return to"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"this quarter, wherein all things are prepared for great and excellent men, pray of what value is that human glory which can scarcely endure the smallest part of one cycle ?

True virtue for its own sake should lead thee to real glory. Leave to others the care of ascertaining what they may say of you : they will assuredly speak of yo11 beyond all doubt.

Accordingly that alane which moves spontaneously because it is ever all itself, never indeed ceases to move, and is nloreover the source of nlotion in all things. Now a primary cause is not derived from any other cause ; for forth from that do all things proceed, and from no other. That which springs from something else cannot be the primary cause, and if this indeed never had a commencement, neither will it ever have an end. For the primal cause once destroyed could neither be generated afresh from any other thing, nor itself produce anything else : for all things must necessarily proceed from the primal cause. This eternal principle of all Motion arises out of that which is moved by itself and of itself, and cannot thcrefcre be born or pelis11 ; or else of necessity the whole heavens must collapse, and all Nature come to a standstill, unable any longer to derive the impulse by which it was set in motion at the first. LL Since, accordingly, it is manifest that that is eternal ~vhich movesofitself, who will deny this eternal principle to be a natural attribute of Souls. For everything which is moved by an external impulse is inanimate : but that, on the other hand, which energizes from within is truly animated, and this is the peculiar operation of the Soul. If then the Soul is the one thing above all, which is self motive, it certainly is not born, but eternal. Do thou then exercise this Soul of thine in the noblest pursuits : solicitude and care for the welfare of one's country are the best : for, animated and controlled by these senti- ments, the Soul passes more swiftly to this sphere-its true home.

As a literary production merely, this is one of the most beautiful and imaginative compositions bequeathed to us by Cicero. A careful examination of the ideas un- folded in its few short pages will prove instructive to every earnest student of the Mysteries-those great In- stitutions of Antiquity, guardians of a sacred science, the echoes of which still linger herein. This opinion has been entertained by more than one commentator upon the strength of internal evidence, and constitutes the rnison d'ltre-of the present translation. The Vision of Scipio is suggestive, resuming as it does so many of the leading conceptions involved in the n~ystical philosophy of the old world, and, in this respect, it but rarely happens that so much is conveyed in so brief a fragment. To those, however, who have grasped the many beauties of the Magian philosophy, or such traces of it as appear discernible in the lapse of time, any attempt to reconstruct the scattered fragments which remain to us must be welcome, and hence the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"object of this article is to examine the leading concep- tions of the Somnizm, in order to arrive at a coherent view of the philosophy which underlies it. That philo- sophy, it is reasonable to conjecture, was alike the system inculcated in the ancient Mysteries of every nation-those Mysteries being considered as the organ- ised endeavour of illuminati to elucidate the great pro- blems of Life and Death, the nature of the Soul and its relation to the Deitv, Men have ever lfound themselves face to face with these great difficulties, striving to unravel the skein of life with all the poverty of language, and the restrictions of human thought. But human thought alone is power- less for such sublime ascents-a higher faculty of the Soul being requisite. \" Strive,\" says the Zoroastrian\"' Oracle, \" to understand the Intelligible which exists be- yond the Mind, with the extended flame of an extended intellect.\" The solution of these momentous questions is of the first importance, because of the moral consequences in- volved ; morality being largely modified in scope and direction by the conclusions arrived at in philosophy. Thus the influence of a system of thought purely of the intellect, must obviously differ from that resulting in the case of a Religio-philosophical system : while it is worthy of remark that no influence has proved so powerful in the direction of human affairs--no sentiment so ineradicably implanted in the human breast-as that of Religion. Here lies the supreme bond of union be- tween all human beings-the most highly vitalized sen- timent of which humanity is capable. It seems probable that the Mysteries-which were almost cosmopolitan +-had for object to draw men * The Chaldemz Oracles form Volume VI. of this Series. f Vide L'inmortnliti de l'anze chez les ancie~zs E&ticns, by Wiedemann."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"closer to each other by bonds of union deeper than those of mere worldly interest, and this was only possible by an appeal at once to both the philosophic and religious sides of the nature. Before the instinct of veneration had been dwarfed, as, generally speaking, it has now largely become, and, at a time when the whole activities of the higher mind functioned, so to speak, under the zgis of Religion, it is not surprising that the Mysteries should have exerted an enormous influence in the lands where they were established. What, it will be asked, was the nature of the revela- tions vouchsafed to participants, or the benefit to be derived from initiation therein ? Our information on this subject is confined to certain meagre historical de- tails, from which we gather that these Institutions pro- fessedly existed to celebrate the mythological histories associated with certain divinities. That they were held in universal esteem and treated with profound reverence is certain-a fact which sufficiently points to the serious nature of these activities, and the lofty intentions which animated them. Indeed, it is difficult to understand how any suggestions to the contrary could gain credence in face of the fact that the most cultured and luminous minds in the past have contributed to elucidate our re- flections upon this subject--all the resources of poetry and philosophy in the early days of the world being mainly burthened with this one theme in some shape or form. The best thought of the ancient world was, to a large extent, the Theosophy we know to-day in another dress. From Plato to Proclus, from Homer to Ovid-the thoughts of such men have lived after them, and even if to-da y largely misunderstood, they nevertheless sue- ceeded in investing the traditions of their time with a significance which none but a student of the Mysteries can hope to understand. The peculiar Rlytho:ogies of Egypt and Greece re-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"spectively were but the machinery of a symbolism, the interpretation of which formed alike the science of the Soul and the system of the Mysteries. Herein lay con- cealed those great truths which serve to explain the immediate mysteries of our environment, the develop- ment and elucidation of which served to enlighten and astonish the Neophyte ; these culminating in appropriate theurgic formulz, conferred a clearer hope of immor- tality-a perception of the Universal Presence, such as the E~lthenst':: alone could derive. Needless to say that such results are not attainable by any process of thought pev se : all that thought can do is to dimly apprehend a higher faculty of the Soul-a mode of perception transcending the merely intellectual. In the Vision of Scipio this higher faculty takes the form of a clairvoyant perception, a marvellous insight superior to all bodily limitations, whereby the con- sciousness is brought into mppovt with other worlds than those nornially perceived by the senses. Apuleius, who was initiated into the Isiac Mysteries, thus refers to his ex~erience : '; I approached the con- fines of death, and having trod on the threshold of Proserpine, I returned therefrom, being borne through all the elements. At midnight I saw the Sun shining with its brilliant Light, and I approached the presence of the Gods b2neath and the Gods above, and stood near and worshipped them.

These fragments tersely resume many of the most daring conceptions of mature thinkers and theurgists long ago-conceptions which endow Religion with enterprise and the Soul with God-like attributes. Little wonder then at the old proverb \" Man, know thyself,\"-when that knowledge involved so much, Such self-knowledge-the most profound homage that Inan can render to the divinity-was by no means an analysis of the Leznn seif, 1x1; an atteGpt to consider the principles working- in the great Universe around us as all reflected in the total constitution of each human being. It is for this reason that the Vision of Scipio is nppnwut2y devoted to an exposition of the divine Potencies operating in the Universe around us. The Gods, in the antient conception, around which so many classic traditions have clustered, were repre- sentations through images and sinlilitudes of certain mighty powers, considered to exist between Man and the Supreme Principle : these powers, although rooted in this Principle, were yet regarded as possessing energies distinct from their ineffable cause. \" These mighty powers,\" says Taylor, '' are called by the Poets a Golden Chain, on account of their connection with each other and incorruptil)le nature, . . . . they are rooted in this Supreme Principle like trees in the Earth, which have a distinct energy of their own at the same time that they energize in conjunction with their cause. \" t * Vide the writings of 13ro:lus on the Philosophy cf Plato, akoJ of Plotinus and Porphyry. -f Taylor's Illiscellnys, p. 129."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"But what, it may be asked, about the Supreme Principle of things, that which is so incomparable to its attributes :-mas this not lost sight of in the multitude of divinities 7 '' To that God,\" says Porphyry, \" who is above all things, neither external speech ought to be addressed, nor yet that which is inward, when it is defiled by the -passion of the soul, but we should venerate him in pure silence and through pure concep- tions of his nature. 7) With this view in mind the student is led to regard the Pantheon of any Nation as a collection of symbols, more or less appropriate, and intended to convey some idea of the totalitv of divine attributes. J It is moreover conipara tively easy to discover certain fundamental similarities which mav be said to underlie .I the great classic Pantheons, and such comparisons clearly indicate a unity of conception which enables us to identifjr as essentially one and the same the Mystical Systems pervading alike Chaldea and Greece on the one hand, and Egypt on the other. The divinities of Mythology were symbols ;-symbols which translated to the trained perception of the initiate the factors of his great equation, those supra- mundane forces which are most reverently defined as deific. One in many and many in One. It was the intimate Itnowledge of these and of the various entities correlated therer,vyth which constituted the \" Divine Sciences \" to which reference is made in the Vision of Scipio. ~hese Divine Sciences, by the practice of which wise men have attained release from the gross and the nether, gaining the upper air and endless light, were formulated on Universal Truths, proceeding from Universals to Particulars.

The nine Spheres alluded to in this Vision, and which for the purposes of study are more properly regarded as either seven or ten-are primal powers and the roots alike of force and form. Hence the \" divine sciences\" derived from the decimal numeration rest upon a basis of mathematical accuracy-mathematics being an exact science. Here we find the first trxes of the Kabalistic Sephiroth,-three Triads of Powers resumed in a Tenth,-the Ennead or procession of nine Gods occurring alike in Chaldean and Egyptian Theo- logy as well as in the Platonic systen1.i This idea was no doubt based upon the principle that as the numbers from I to 10 formed the base of every possible numerical variation, so every manifested thing in Nature is ultimately referable to these Ten primordial powers, for number guides form and lies at the root of sound. Pursuing this conception further, it will be seen that the linear equivalents of numbers I and 2 cannot of themselves produce a concrete form : for the first would be represented by one straight line, and the second by two straight lines, neither of which can en- close a space. These two nunlbers must therefore ever remain abstractions, and the succeeding number Three become the first concrete expression : on the other hand, * Who knows himself knows all things in himself. f Compare also the Jupiter, Neptune and Pluto of the Greeks and Romans ruling respectively over three great Realms-Heaven, The Sea,\" and Infernal Regions.

It is for this reason that the objective powers of manifestation are septenary, and these, corresponding to their geometrical forms, are also allied to colours and sounds, as suggested in the Sont~zium. These Seven divine forces were anciently supposed to reside in the Planets, the ruling intelligences of which were thus regarded as the Vicegerents of the Sephirotic powers ; and the administration not only of the whole physical world, but even of human affairs, came to be attributed to the celestial wanderers. This Septenate-called also the \"Tree of Life \"--was traced in every created t hing-in the Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral departments. This theoretical procession, from primal natures down to the more complex, also laid the foundation of Alchemy, for some subjects, from the simple integrity of their nature, were considered as peculiarly appropriate vehicula f~r the Anima Mundi. It is important to notice in the Vision of Scipio, that the Planets are regarded as in a way distinct from the Spheres within which they energize, and here also lies a conception which will repay attention.$: According to Hermetic teaching, everything which has culminated in idea or materiality-in form, per se, or its physical ex- pression-is regarded as ensphered, and thereby indi- vidualized : such intangible and magnetic circuli are conceived to be forces evolvi~~g form-form being static force. Each individual or entity-whether a stone, a plant, an animal, or a man-energizes according to its nature, i.e., gives expression to the archetype of its sphere, and this is the 1t7ork of evolution : while the * \" According to the Orphic theology, each of the planets is fixed in a luminous ethereal sphere called oho~q~ or Wholeness, because it is a part with a total subsistence and is analogous to the sphere of the fixed stars.\" Metamorbhosis of Apzrkizrs, eleventh book, Taylor's translation."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"crown of manifested life is naturally considered to be the production of spiritually perfect man-the form of forms. In just the same way as the planetary spheres are here said to be comprised within the sphere of the fixed Stars, so all entities are vested in the Anima Mundi in varying degree, according to vehiculum ; in the higher kingdoms increased complexity obtains, culminating in the human being-as it is said, \" Oh, Man of a daring nature, thou subtil production ! \"';' The Unity of the Divine One-\" circumscribing the Heavens with convex form \"which is considered to underlie all n~anifestation, is a necessary conception to the doctrines of Macrocosm and h'licrocosm, the greater and lesser worlds : that which is a part, of necessity partakes of the nature of the whole, and thus every entity is a n~icrocosm, or little world, reflecting the greater world or macrocosm after a certain formula-- but reflection involves reversal. This latter truth, re- sumed also in the old axiom, \" As above, so below, but after another manner,\" is probably the explanation of more than one incongruity in the Sonz&nz. Man being made in the likeness of the Gods, the planetary forces find their representatives in the con- stitution of his being, but whereas in n~acrocosmic action their operation is, as it were, without within-in the human organism it is rather within without, and not only are the Seven great Sephirotic powers distributed throughout the entire human system as a whole, but also the three worlds in hqan, viz., the head, the chest, and vital parts, are said to each contain Seven important centres or orifices.+ * See Vol. VI.

To understand the action of the Planets, it is necessary to consider what these Signs of the Zodiac are. The celestial definition is of course familiar to everyone, but that does not throw light on the Chaldean theory. The twelve constellations were related to the three con- ditions of each of the four elements of the ancients, thus making twelve elemental variations in all : these are not, however, to be confounded with the Fire, Air, Water, and Earth usually recognized under these terms, but to the subtil &hers underlying them, and necessary for the manifestation of the gross elements. I hus the - fiery Signs, viz., Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius, were all considered to transmit the influence of subtil Fire, but in three different conditions, these being respectively the Fiery, Watery, and Airy degrees of ztheric Fire- and so on with each of the other elemental triplicities. In one complete diurnal revolution of the Sun, the successive influences of the whole of these twelve con- stellations are transmitted around the circuit of our Earth : this ~vould give an nvelnge time of two hours to each Sign, during which its elemental current would be operative.';' These influences are intensified, or the re- verse, by the presence or absence of the planets from the Signs, because some planets are considered to harinonize with the elemental vibrations of certain Signs, and vice vevsci. This, in its human application, will be the better understood when it is stated that the four elements re- ferred to were especially connected with the constitution of the human being, and the proportion in which these * Compare the Eastern theory of the Tatwas."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"mingled would thus regulate the temperament of the in- dividual under the regimen of the planets. According to the. Hermetic system, it is only when these ztheric vibrations are disposed with due interval and proper balance that the spirit can be rendered manifest-the dead Osiris be raised to life, and the Lord of this World enter into his Kingdom. Some Souls lack qualities in which others abound, but the perfect man is fully representa- tive. The elemental constit~ltion of the individual is derived from the ~~ivific fountains of Nature's energies : the Zodiacal hierarchies having successively endowed the human race at certain stages of its evolution, under the presidency of the Sephirotic powers. The history of human evolution passing in its different phases, from the blackness of putrefaction \" through all the colours,\" to the golden glory of spiritual perfection, presents a perfect parallel with the Alchemical process of the \" Great LVork,\" with which, indeed, in a major aspect it is identical. The period of the Annus Mapus? or Great Year, comprising 25,868 solar years, or there- abouts, is that of one complete \" circulation,\" for a minor revolution of the Zodiacal powers is both begun and finished within that time. The great celestial phe- nomena thus become coincident with the progress of the Race, and its final apotheosis approxin~ately pre- dicable.

They are the Zones immediately penetrated by Souls depart- ing this life, and their period of detention therein is regu- lated by the past spent life. Some few Souls coming forth pure, traverse these without let or hindrance and others require a long purification therein. The following allegorical fragment of Empedocles, cited by Plutarch, is doubtless a true echo of the ancient Mystery teaching concerning this matter. Speaking of the unpurified Souls which enter these Regions, he thus describes the treatment they undergo : \" The ethereal force pursues them towards the Sea.

The exhortation to devote attention to divine things, while faithfully performing the duties of practical life, is one which must echo universal respanse. The calms of lofty contemplation expand our being, enlarging the purview of life, and the true dignity of the Soul is alone maintained when in alliance with its own divine surnn+t.

Aristotle teaches this, and adds Understanding answers to One, Knowledge to Two, Opinion to Three, or the Superficies, and Sense to the Quaternion or Solid. Plutarch in The Opi~zions of the Pkibosophevs, chap. iii., explains the reasons. Vv. lii., liii. Pythagoras and Socrates included hlorality in Physics. In his commentary on these verses Hierocles plainly asserts that by Metempsychosis, Pythagoras meant that Vice changes n:an into the like- ness of a beast, while Virtue makes him resemble God ; and that he can be neither the one nor the other by his nature.

Cov no~z conzed~m'z~~rt. Eat not the heart.-Dacier. It has been suggested that this symbol means that we ought not to wear out our hearts with grief, nor to abandon ourselves to despair. Homer uses the same expression in regard to Nellerophon, bL eating his own heart.\" The brain is usually associated with the in- tellect, and the heart with the enlotions. Some of the ancients held that by eating the heart of an animal, man obtained a tinge of the peculiarities of that animal, in a much greater degree than by eating the flesh of other parts.

Hermetic adepts say that the true meaning is that the Elementals of the Fire should not be threatened by the use of a steel sword, for fire and iron are analogous, but that these may be coerced by the correct pentagrammatic use of the sword when it is used with a due knowledge of the correspondences. H. P. B, in Isis U~zveiled, Vol. I. p. 247, refers to this symbol and points out that this maxim is familiar to the folk-lore of many nations, Tartars, Laplanders, Russians and the Aborigines of North and South America ; see Tylor, Primitive Cultzwe, who quotes De Plnnn Cnvpilzi of I 246. VI. Nun ~eve~tendz~wz, qzczm ad tevlrzi~zos pewenen's. When you have arrived at the end, desire not to turn back.-Dacier. This has been applied to a human life,-when you have come nigh unto death, do not be dismayed and desire not to live. We know that an old proverb says, v~stign mlla ~etvovszsnz,\" Lo no returning footsteps are visible.\" This symbol seems to be a statement of the law of Karma, that there is no escape from the proper reward or punishment of one's own deeds; as one has made one's bed, so one must lie upon it. A craven repentance made when one has no longer an oppor- tunity of re-adjusting the effects of action, is of no value. As the tree has fallen so must it lie. Jamblichus gives, \" Having started do not turn back, for the Furies have followed you.\" VII. Pev vlnm publira~?~ Ire cndns. Go not in the public way.-Dacier.

Carlyle has said, the majority of man- kind are fools,\" and so the common procedure in any case is erroneous. Christianity teaches that many are called but few chosen,\" so that one needs to be exceptional in purity and goodwill to earn the reward. Each man has a natural constitutional peculiarity, and so is suited to progress in some particular path, and not in any common mode of advancement. This assurance should lead us to be charitable in judging of the lives of others, and not to be hasty in judgment, for if one have fallen how do we know L4 that we could have withstood the same temptation.\"--S.A.

VIII. Do~uesticns Hirz~ndines ne hnbeto. Suffer no swallows about your house.--Dacier. We may be sure that this symbol does not mean that we ought to interfere with the visits of these birds of passage, and that a philosophical maxim is here in- tended. Old commentators translated this symbol into the instruction :-do not encourage great talkers to visit your family. Perhaps rather, do not estimate and encourage temporary acquaintances bv the standard of, and with the welcome due to familiar permanent friends.

Wear not the image of God upon a ring.-Dacier. We ought not to profane the name of the God we adore by speaking of Him at every turn, and before unsympathetic persons. It was, of old, deemed an offence to wear a ring, or bear a coin of the ruling monarch, when on an illegal errand, or in an unseemly place. Dion writes of a. young man condemned for visiting a scandalous place while bearing a coin of the Prince of the city, Caracalla. Seneca and Suetonius report the same fact of the illegality of wearing a ring bearing the image of a king when engaged in immoral conduct. Philostratus says that one was found guilty of treason for beating a slave who bore a medal of Tiberius Czsar. The Hebrews were forbidden to make or wear any image of their divine Ruler. The Kabalist teaches that no representation of the Ain Soph is possible, while the emanations of the Sephiroth may be fitly typified by number, letter and word. Neither Buddhist nor Brahman makes any image of the Supreme, although numerous representations of the members of the issuant triad of Brahma, Vishnu and Siva are permissible. N. 0. M.

Solomon gives special warnings in the book of Proverbs, chap. vi., v. I, and chap. xvii., v. 18, against a careless- pledging of oneself tb or for others, such a one, he says, is \" void of understanding.\" But the right hand ;hen given with due prepara$on is of the utmost service, for it is of the Pillar of Geburah, carrying intensity and efficiency. The instructed occultist does not shake hands readily with the chance interviewer, and the Freemason regards the giving of the right hand as a sure pledge of brotherhood. XII. 0ZZn vestigizwz in circeve con fzc~dito. Leave not the mark of the pot upon the ashes.- Dacier. This symbol refers to the cooking utensil, an earthen or iron vessel, and to the ashes of a wood fire. Having cooked, remove the signs of the vessel having rested upon the heap of ashes. Having realised your aims, do not dwell upon the efforts that have beeneexpended. Some say, that having effected a reconciliation with one who has been in enmity with you, do not again refer to the cause of your estrangement. Do not rake up old grievances. Do not add insult to the triumph you have gained over another."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"XIII. Nevbntlt MoZoc1zen sevito, ne tlzmen mzndito, Sow the seeds of the Mallow plant, but do not eat the fruits t hereof.-Dacier. This symbol is explained by the old commentators to mean-use mildness to others, and not to yourself; pardon offences of others, but do not overlook your own. The mallow and marsh-mallow are plants having a soothing property, and were sown and grown as medicinal herbs. Do good to others, but not for your own reward. Do not look for gratitude and expressions of thanks for good actions, and if possible, do not accept any reward for a deed done from a conscientious motive.-S. A. Look for the medicinal virtue of the mallow plant in the leaves, not in the flowers.-L. 0. XIV. Fncda? sedeut ~te extevgito. Wipe not out the place of a torch.-Dacier.

Do not dwell upon the history of a past success, but do not forget the Light which has illuminated yo11 in your search for inspiration ; for the same Light may illumine the path for others, but the material steps will be different for others. xv. .A IL~ZLS~E~ ~I~IZ~ZLJIZ ne gestnto.

The Greek adjective is '' stenos,\" not straight but narrow, confined, too tight. Still the word is used in the same"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"sense as in the New Testament where the narrow way is called straight.\" The maxim then, is \" Do not wear a tight ring.\" Liberty of action is to be desired, and is of great advantage if liberty be not allowed to degenerate into license, and into folly, and thence into sin. Do not be fettered by custom and fashion, but do that which conscience prompts as right to be done by you. Fashion is a great slavery &to us all, brave souls alone save themselves from the current of common stupidity. XVI. A~ti~nalin z~ngz~iczwvin jte ~zz~t~ito. Feed not animals that have crooked claws.-Dacier. Curved claws and nails are a sign of rapacity and of such as prey upon other animals: vegetable feeders have hoofs or soft cushiony feet-among animals. Do not encourage or be familiar with anyone whom you have known to profit by an injustice to others, for such a one will one day turn and rend you also. The appetite grows by what it feeds upon. Do not hold a candle to the Devil for him to see his work by. Do not partici- pate in ill-gotten gains. XVII. A fnbis abstineto. Abstain from beans.-Dacier. This symbol has been interpreted in very various manners, as follows :- I. In the natural sense ; that Beans were a faulty article of food. 2. That Beans were a type for errors, sins, or any other impurity. 3. That Beans referred to civil offices of the state, because in elections and judgments, beans n7ere used in voting ; in a similar manner to our English form of lodge ballot by black and white balls."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Hesychius says that the bean signified the suffrages of judges, and that a synonym for a judge was a bean- caster. . For a theological reason in Egypt, as Herodotus tells us that the bean was sown but not eaten, and that a priest was forbidden even to look at them lest he should become unclean. See Book xi. Hippocrates in chapter I 5 of his second book on Diet, condemns beans as an article of food, calling them too astringent, and tending to cause intestinal gases. Bonwick says that the cult of Ceres condemned the bean, and the Sabeans of Syria also refused it. There was a Sacred Egyptian Bean, which was thrown upon graves as a syn~bol of a renewal of life, from a notion of a sexual resemblance. XVIII. 11/17eln~zzwos Ize gustnto. Eat not fish whose tails are black.-Dacier. Melns means black, and ozwis means tail, but it is not certain what sort of fish was so called ; some say the perch, others the sea bream. This symbol has been explained, thus :- Frequent not the company of infamous men. Black- tailed may be a fair simile for persons of seeming good aspect, who have a hidden evil side behind them, or who have left behind them an evil record. Do not accept a doctrine which h~s a hidden failing, simply because its first appearance is attractive.-S.A. Jamblichus of Chalcis, gives Abstain from him who hat11 a black tail, for it belongs to the infernal gods.\" N. 0. M. XIX. 1Ve E~ythi~zmt edito. Do not eat the gurnet (or gurnard-a fish).-Dacier."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"It is a curious fact that so many of these symbols are apparently directions for diet. No doubt the Pytha- goreans fully recognised that diet largely affected the health and tendencies of a man, and it is equally certain that these symbols have always been understood to require a double interpretation ; one upon the material plane, and another of a philosophic or religious nature. Pliny, the ancient naturalist, says that the Erythrinus was a fish all red excepting a white bellv. The fish we now call gurnard is red ; mediaeval auihors say it was an emblem of blood. The symbol may mean, Do not shed blood, or avoid revenge which may lead to bloodshed. I have not found that this fish was condemned as food by any other teacher than Pythagoras. Some authorities, however, read in the Greek~~osln~~tbn~aon and not esthiei~r, or do not take up, instead of do not eat. RZLOY~MC nliquid ne suscipins ; Do not undertake anything red ; do not shed blood, is another reading found in Mavsilius Ficinus.-S. A. xx. Eat not the matrix of animals.-Dacier. Vulva is not synonymous with matrix--the womb. The Latin should be zctevzcs, not vzdvn, for the oldest Greek version reads Metvnn. The symbol may mean, avoid all that leads to sensuality ; do not ponder over the ideas of sexual relation. This is almost entirely a man's failing ; women are generally the victims of affection rather than passion. The apparently natural dissimilarity of the human sexes in this respect seems inzxplicable. XXI. A ~zorticinis nbsthezeto. Abstain from the flesh of animals that die of therr~selves.-Dacier."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"On the purely material plane this rule is almost universally applied in our times ; all butcher's meat is slaughtered, and presumably only healthy animals are chosen : but Christian butchers outvie the Jews in their rush for wealth, for among the Jews no meat is sold for human consun~ption when it is found post mortenl that the animal has been suffering from disease ; such carcases are handed over to the Christians, who buy them readily. Meat duly passed by the official appointed by the Rabbi is called Kosher,\" that is, really fitted for use as human food. It is believed that this procedure is one reason for the smaller percen- tage of deaths from conimunicable diseases among the Hebrews. The moral meaning of the symbol is not clear. Some old authors have said-Share not in the flesh of profane animals that are not fit for sacrifices, and renounce all dead works. Perhaps, renounce all un- profitable works; such as have no imprint of spiritual progress. Do not long follow a path which leads to no good result ; or perhaps-abstain from dwelling or, past events, rather look forward to future good results Ab mzimdibnts nbsti~zeto. Abstain from eating animals.-Dacier. There is here no necessary reference to eating. Abstain from animals is the simple translation. This might mean, spend your energies upon your fellow men and women, rather than in making pets of animals. Some have referred the word animals to unreasonable men, as animals are believed to be without reason."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Solem qbponito. Always put salt upon the table.-Dacier. Provide salt, simply. The material sense may be as Dacier suggests. Salt was a Greek synihol for Justice, for as salt preserves substances, so Justice preserves the rights of men, and without Justice there is corruption. Leviticus, c. 3, v. 13, says L6 Thou shalt add salt to all thy offerings.\" Compare the old proverb concerning the spilling of salt, which was regarded as the precursor of evil. XXIV. Pn~zerlt ZZE fm~zgito. Never break the bread.-Dacier. U'hat this may mean on the material plane is not clear, for bread is clearly meant to be broken, unless indeed cut, from which no gain is apparent. Greek bread was made in long portions, with surface markings dividing each loaf into four pieces. IYhen given to the poor, it was frequently broken into these pieces and so distrilmted ; so perhaps the meaning is, give a whole loaf, do not be mean to the poor. Bread was also a syriibol of Life, and this symbol has been interpreted, do not too much distribute your energies, but choose some good aim in life, and devote all your strength to that end. Sedew oleo ne nbstevgito. Spill not oil upon a seat.-Dacier. There is some error here, for lze nbstevgito\" and the original Greek me omovg~rusthni \" both mean \" do not wipe,\" and have no reference to \" spilling. 7 7 Old authors said, otl was intended for praise, and sent"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"referred to official positions ; their explanation was that dignitaries should not be praised The English version needs to be changed to, \" Do not clean a seat with oil;\" meaning, use the proper remedy in each case.

Ne cibz~m ~ZI mntellnm ia2jicitc. Put not meat into a foul vessel.-Dacier. On the material plane this is sound advice, for nothing will make meat decay so rapidly as exposure to animal excreta. A foul vessel is the symbol of a wicked man, the New Testament calls the wicked, \" vessels of dis- honour.\" It is useless, if not worse, to give to the vicious the spiritual knowledge which a good man will appreciate and be thankful for. XXVII. Gnllu~lt wtvito, ue snc~zficnto, L z41ze enim et Soli sncev est. Feed the Cock, but sacrifice hini not, for he is sacred to the Sun and the Moon.-Dacier. The ancients used to sacrifice a cock to Bsculapius, as the thank-offering for recovery from sickness : even in our century, the great Platonist Thomas Taylor did this in pursuance of ancient usage. The Cock was a symbol of Watclifulness and care for others. The Templar degrees of Freemasonry refer to this idea. The people of Crotona and Metapontum, colonies of Greeks among whom Pythagoras laboured, were not mindful of the maxim, for they killed him ; and the Athenians sacrificed Socrates, who had been as rhe symbolic Cock to them.

De~rtes sze f~mzgito. Break not the teeth.-Dacier. The Romans used this formula to mean \" do not revile,\" or \" avoid satire.\" Do not break your teeth is a wise maxim, for the teeth are necessary to good digestion, and in ethical matters a good perception must precede clear development and real progress. A cetnrizrw vrzs nbs te ~etnoveto. Keep the vinegar cruet far from you.-Dacier.

Spit upon the parings of your nails and the clippings of your hair.-Dacier. The act of spitting upon anything meant the casting off and rejection of it : these parings were things of no farther use, superfluities which, if allowed to remain, would only be sources of mischief, so they are to be cast off rernorszlessly ; this clearly must be extended to our faults, which are excrescences."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"XXXI.

The Sun as chief light-giver was also the symbol of divine purity, to which no unworthy action should appear. XXXII. Ad Solem vevsus, Ize lopzcitzw. Speak not, facing the Sun.-Dacier. It has been said that this maxim means, do not pub- lish your thoughts to the world.

In via, ne lipn mdito. Cut not wood by the way.-Dacier. Do not convert to private use what is intended for the public welfare. Otherwise, the cutting of wood was a menial task, among Greeks and also among the Hebrews ; so the maxim may mean, do not be content to labcur at low employments, when higher occupations are within your ability.
