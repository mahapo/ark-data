D. has contributed a Commentary to this very curious and highly mystical tract, which was written by that eminent Rosicrucian Adept, Thomas Vaughan, and published by him under the pseudonym of Eugenius Philalethes. The seriously minded mystical student will find much to instruct and interest in the learned comments with which this edition is enriched. The Paragraphs of the original work have been numbered for convenience of reference, and the new notes and com- ments have beell placed after each numbered portion. It must be borne in mind that there is an essential differ- ence between the meaning of the word \" element \" as used by Vaughan, and the modern scientific meaning of the word. For the ancient and mediaeval philosophers knew nothing of our modern theory of chemical elements; their view of the common origin of matter not recognizing such definite and independent substances. The word \" Element \"as used by the learned at the period when \" Euphrates \" was penned, meant rather a \" state \" of matter, such as the hot, cold, moist and dry natures ; or the solid, liquid, gaseous or ethereal conditions; or the stationary, slow, quick or instantaneous processes of change. No alteration has been made in the text of Vaughan's work except in the mode of spelling of a few words, the omission of italics and the correction of misprints. It is intended to issue shortly the \" Lumen de Lumine \" of the same author, these two volumes will be found to be nlutually explanatory. W.

I HAVE Reader, (and I suppose it is not unknown to thee) within these few years, in several little Tracts delivered my Judgement of Philosophie, I say of Philosophie, for Alchymie in the common acceptation, and as it is a torture of Metals, I did never believe, much less did I study it. In this print, my books being perused will give thee evidence ; for there I refer thee to a subject that is universal, that is the founda- tion of all Nature, that is the matter whereof all things are made, and wherewith being made are nourished. This I presume can be no metal, and therefore as I ever disclaimed Alchimie in the vulgar sense, so I thought fit to let the Alchinlists know it, least in the perusal of my Writings they should fix a construction to some passages, which cannot suit with the Judge- ment of their Author, Hence thou mayest see what my conceptions were, when I began to write, and now I must tell thee they are still the same, nor hath my long experience weakened them at all, but invincibly confirmed them. But to acquaint thee how ingenuous I am, I freely confess, that in my practise I waved my own principles, for having miscarried in my first attempts, I laid aside the true subject, and was content to follow their Noise, who will hear nothing but Metals. VC7hat a drudge I have been in this school, for three years together, I will not here tell thee, it was well that I quitted it at last, and walk'd again into that clear light, which I had ioolishly forsaken. I ever conceived that in metals there were great secrets, provided they be first reduc'd by a proper dissolvent,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"but to seek that Dissolvent, or the matter whereof it is made, in Metals, is not only Error hut Madness. I have for the Truths sake, and to justify my innocent and former Discourses, added to them this little piece ; which perhaps is such, and hath in it so much, as the UTorld hath not yet seen published. It is not indeed the tenth part of what I had first design7d, but some sober Considerations made nle forbear, as my sudden and abrupt Close will inform thee. ow eve;, what I now reserve, as to the Philosophical Mysteries may be imparted hereafter in our Meteorologie; and for the Theological, we shall draw them up for our own private use in our Philosophia Gratiae. I have little more to say, but if it may add anything to thy content, I can assure thee here is nothing affirm7d, but what is the fruit of my own experience. 1 can truly say of my own, for with much labour have I wrung it out of the Earth, nor had 1 any to instruct me ; for I was never so fortunate as to meet with one man, who had the abilitv to contribute to me in this kind. I would J not have thee build mountains on the Foundation I have here laid, not especially those of Gold ; But if thou dost build Physick upon it, then have I hew'd thee the Rock and the Basis of that famous art, which is so much profest, and so little understood; here thou shalt find the true subject oi it demonstrated, and if thou art not very dull, sufficiently discovered ; Here God himself and the TYord of God leads thee to it ; Here the Light shews thee Light, and here hast thou that Testimony of Iamblicus, and the Aegyptian Records cleared namely, that God sometimes delivered to the ancient priests and Prophets a certain matter, per bentn spectncziln, and communicated it for the use of Man. I shall conclude with this Admonition ; if thou would'st know Nature, take heed of Antimonie and the common metalls ; seek onely that very first mixture of elements, which Nature makes in the great world ; seek it I say, tvhi17st it is fresh and new, and having"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"found it, conceal it. As for the use of it, seek not that altogether in Books, but rather beg it at the Hands of God, for it is properly his gift, and never man attain'd to it, without a clear and sensible assistance from above ; Neglect not my Advice in this, though it may seem ridiculous to those that are overwise and have the mercies of God in derision. Many men live in this World without God; they have no Visits from him, and therefore laugh at those that seek him, but much more at those that have found him. St. Paul gloried in his Revelations, but he that will do so now shall be cumber'd among Ranters and Anabaptists. But let not these things divert thee, if thou servest God, thou servest a good Master, and he will not keep back thy Wages. Farewell in Christ Jesus. E. P."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"OF THE ADDRESS TO THE READER. BY S. S. D. D. Let no Inan take up this book in the hope of finding it to contain a treatise on the transmutation of metals. It is rather a very profitable study of the philosophy of nature and a guide to the attainment of that perfection of mind and body. which has been called by some, the achievement of Adeptship. Thomas Vaughan, who wrote under the name of Eugenius Philalethes, the lover of truth, published this work in 1655. At a time when the struggles between Puritans and Catholics had reached an acute stage. At a time when it was dangerous to write openly, and when man was still supposed to be the end of Creation. Spinoza was writing his exposure of the ignorance of Bible comnlentators and of the vulgar interpre- tation of the Scriptures ; Hume's famous essay on miracles was still unthought of; Nature was degraded as the enemy of God much in the same way as Woman was looked upon as the temptress of Man. Luther's demand that the \"sacred oracles\" should be placed in the hands of the unlearned, while it exposed the restric- tions of the Priestly teaching was still doing as much harm as good. For without much learning, the words of the Jewish scriptures may be twisted into enough contradictory dogmas to furnish the battle cries of opposing sects till the end of time. It is impossible to understand the Old Testament while we are ignorant of the esoteric construction put upon it by the Jews; and this key to its secret rneaning is given in the Qabalah. That Thomas Vaughan was a Qabalist there is no doubt ; but he dared not openly aclinowledge the fact ; s0"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"that we shall find him frequently speaking in a manner that obliges him to excuse himself to the learned and acknowledge that he writes thus \" for the sake of those with weal; con- sciences.\" Our author says that he treats of a \" subject which is uni- versal;\" that is to say, of a subject which has its analogies on all planes, a subject \" which is the fou~zdntiolz of all nature.\" Now the Foundation was the special name used by English Qabalists to translate the word Jesod, which is the Ninth Sephira, or absolute emanation of the manifesting God : and the waters of the fourth river of Eden, Phrath or Euphrates, flow down throng11 the foundation of life into the visible universe. The Egyptians, in whose secret archives we find the origin of much of the gabalah, considered the human principle, or Chaibt, which they represented hieroglyphically by an open fan. to imply thc cn~anation lin0~11 to ~noderns as the odour, or the Aura, or the sympathetic or antipathetic in- fluence of one being upon another. In like manner we may think of the Sephira Jesod as not only a symbol of generative force, but also of this snbtle emanation acting and reacting upon all creation ; some of the results of which are tides, tempests, affinities, love, friencl- ship ; which is in fact the foundation alike of the relationship of a being to its parts, and of one being to another. This odour or aura is especially noticeable in vegetable life. It is found that the essential oil existing in the outer cells of the petals is the source of the perfumc of a flower, the lower surfaces COII taining tannin'aud colouring matter. Now the first action of the of life is to emit an odorous sphere or aura or emanation of influence. From the intcr- action of this with the Kuach or spirit, the material body is formulated from the elements. The seed being the magnet of attraction as we shall see expressed later on in the text of this work."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Thornas Vauglian's next sentence confirms us in the con- clusion that the ideas he associates with the word Foundation are strictly Qal)alistic, \" That is the matter whereof all things arc made, and wherewith bcing made they are nourished.\" Now there is no doubt that in whatever form we may take food, whether as beef, rice, or green food, it is alike re- soltred by digestion and fermentation into a milky emulsion in which will be found the essential oils of the various ingredients we have eaten, and that occurs before it can in any way be said to nourish us. Again Metals can be acted npon by ferments of an acid nature and so changed into their higher form or ti~lcture, but without the aid of the external ele~ncntary snbstance they are in themselves incapable of regeneration. Having said thus nlucll ill words irltendcd to puzzle the untrained scholar, our author closes his introduction abruptly, advising the student to apply himself to physic, or thc rcgener- ation of his o\\s.~i nztl~rc rather than to the niaking of gold. iVith a filial warning against metals and an exhortation to scek only the first mixture of elenlents which nature makes, lie closes his introduction. I may here remark that after fernlentation or putrefaction, an anlount of a volatile oil far exceeding in quantity the original essential oil ot a natural substance can be extracted from it by the usual processes of distillation, etc. Fernientatioli in tllis sense was one of the most important processes linown to the ancients. \\Ire may I thi~ili gather that the essential oil and compre- hend with it the perfutne or aura, was the physical basis of life in the eyes of thc ancieuts. Death, putrefaction or fer- liientation sets free large qua11 tities of this essence which when treated by the wise, may effect the regeneration of a particular body.

I-r is written in those living Oracles, which we haye received, and believe, that there is an ICe\\-. ch xvi Angel of the I'C'aters : and this seems to lw v. j spoken in a general sense, as if the Angel there mentioned had Ljeen President of all that Element. Elsewhere we find an Angel limited to a more particular Charge, as that which descended at a certain season, and stirred the Waters in John, ch. Y. the Pool of Hethesda.

Surely I a111 one that thinks very honourably of Nature, and if I avoid such Disputes as these, it is because I would not offend weak Consciences. For there are a people, who though they dare not think the Majesty of God was dimin- ished, in that he made the It'orld, yet they dare think, the Majesty of His Word is much vilified, if it be applied to what he hath made. An Opinion, truly, that carries in it a most dangerous Elasphe~ny ; namely that God's Word and God's IVork should be such different things, that the one must needs disgrace the other. I must confess I am much to seek, what Scripture shall be applied to, and whom it \\Iark i. was written for if not for us, and for our v. 17. instruction ; for if they that are whole (as our Saviour testifies) have no need of a Phisician, then did God cause Scripture to be written, neither for himself, nor for his Angels, but it was written for those creatures, who having lost the first estate, were since fallen into corruption. Kow then if scripture was written for us, it concerns us much to know what use we shall make of it, and this we may uather from the different conditions of Man before and a after his Fall. Before his fal1,Man was a glorious Creature, having received from God Immortality, and perfect Knowledge ; but in and after his Fall, he eschanged immortality for death, and knowledge for ignorance. Xow as to our redemption from this fall, we may not"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"(in respect of Death) expect it in this world, God having decreed, that all men should once die ; But for our ignorance, we may and ought to put off in this life, for- asmuch as without the Knowledge of God, no man can be saved : for, it is both the Cause and the Earnest of our future immortality. It remains then that our ignorance must be put off in part, even in this life, before we can put off our mortality ; and certainly to this end was Scripture written ; namely that by it we might attain to the knowledge of God, and return to him from whom we were fallen. And here let no man be angry with me, if I ask how Scripture teacheth us to know God ? Doth it only tell us there is a God, and leave all the rest to our discretion ? Doth it (that I may speak my mind) teach 11s to know God by his Works, or without his Works ? If by his IVorks then by Natural things, for they are his IVorks, and none other, if without his Works, I desire to knowwhat rnanner of teaching that is,for I cannot yet find it. If they say it is by Inspiration, I say too that God can teach us so, but Scripture cannot ; for certainly Scripture never in- spired any man, though it came itself by inspiration. But if it be replied, that in Scripture we have the testimonies of men inspired, I say this ilnswer is beside my Ques- tion ; for I speak not here of the bare Authority or Testimony of Scripture, bat 1 speak of that Doctrine, by which it proves what it testifies, for with such Doc- trine the Scripture abounds.

For my own part, I fear not to say, that Nature is so much the business of Scripture, that to me, the Spirit of God, in those sacred Oracles, seems not only to mind the Restitution of Man in particular, but even the Re- demption of Nature in general. VITe must not there- fore confine this Restitution to our own Species, unless we can confine corruption to it withal, which doubt- less we cannot do ; for it is evident that Corruption hath not onely Seiz'd upon Man, but on the World also for man's sake. If it be true then that man hath a Saviour, it is also as true, that the whole Creation hath the same ; God having reconciled all things to himself in Christ Jesus. And if it be true, that we look for the Redemption of our Bodies, and a New man; It is equally true, that we look for a new Heaven, and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth righteous- ness ; for it is not man alone, that is to be Renewed at the general Restauration, but even the world, as well as man, as it is written : Behold! I make Rev. ch., all things New. I speak not this to dis- sxi. v. 5. parage man, or to match any other creature with hi111 : for I know he is principal in the Restauration, as he was in the Fall, the Corruption that succeeded in the Elements, being but a Chain, that this prisoner drags after him : but I speak this to sho~v, that God minds the Restitution of Nature in general, and not man alone, who though he be the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"noblest part, yet certainly is but a small part of Nature, Is scripture then misapplied, much less vilified, when it is applied to the object of Salvation, namely to Nature, for that is it, which God would save, and redeeme from the present Deprivations, to which it is subject : verily, when I read Scripture, I can find nothing in it, but what concerns Nature and Natural things : for where it mentions Regeneration, Illumina- tion, and Grace, or any other spiritual gift, it doth it not precisely, but in order to Nature, for what signifies all this, but a new influence of Spirit, descending from God to assist Nature, and to free us from those Corrup- tions, wherewith of a long time we have been opprest ? I suppose it will not be denied, but God is more Meta- physical, than any Scripture can be and yet in the work of salvation, it were great impiety to separate God and Nature, for then God would have nothing to save nor indeed to work upon. How much more absurd is it in the Ministry of Salvation to separate Scripture and Nature, for to whom I beseech you doth Scripture speak ? Nay, to whom is Salvation minis- ter'd, if Nature be taken away ? I doubt not but man stands in nature, not above it, and let the School-men resolve him into what parts they please, all those parts will be found natural, since God alone is truly Meta- physical. I would gladly learn of our Adversaries, how they came first to know, that Nature is Corrupted ; for if Scripture taught them this physical truth, why may it not teach them more ? but that Scripture taught"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"them, is altogether undeniable; Let us fancy a Phy- sician of such Abilities, as to state the true tempera- ment of his patient, and wherein his Disease hath disordered it. Doth he not this to good purpose? Questionless, he doth: and to no less purpose is it in my opinion, for the spirit of God, whose patient nature is, to give us in Scripture a Character of Nature, which certainly he hath done i11 all points, whether we look to the past, present, or future Complexion of the VVorld. For my own part, I have this assurance of Philosophy, that all the Mysteries of Nature consist in the knowledge of that Corruption, which is mention'd in Scripture, and which succeeded the Fall: namely to know what it is, and where it resides principally : as also to know what Substance that is, which resists it most, and rewards it, as being most free from it, for in these two consist the Advantages of life and death. To be short, Experience, and Reason grounded there- upon. 1 have taught me, that Philosophy and Divinity are but one, and the same science : but man hath dealt with knowledge, as he doth with Rivers, and Wells, which being drawn into several pipes are made to run several ways, and by this accident come at last to have several names. We see that God in his work, hath united spirit and matter, visibles and invisibles, and out of the union of spiritual, and natural substances riseth a perfect compound, whose very nature, and Being consists in that union. HOW then is it possible to demonstrate the Nature of that Compound by a divided"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Theory of Spirit by itself and matter by itself? for if the nature of a Compound consists in the Composition of Spirit and matter, then must not we seek that Nature in their separation, but in their mixture and Tempera- ture, and in their mutual mixt Actions and Passions. Besides : who hath ever seen a spirit without matter, or matter without spirit, that he should be able to give us a true Theory of both principles in their simplicity ! Certainly, no man living. It is just so in Divinity, for if by evasion we confine Divinity to God in the abstract, who (say I) hath even known him so? Or, who hat11 received such a Theology from him, and hath not all this while delivered it unto us ? Verily, if we consider God in the abstract, and as he is in himself, we can say nothing of him positively, but we may some- thing negatively, as Dionysius hath done, that is to say, we may affirm what he is not, but we cannot afiirnl what he is. But if by Divinity, we under- stand the Qoctrine of Salvation, as it is laid down in scripture, then verilv it is a mixed Doctrine, involving both God and Nature. And here I doubt not to affirme That the Mystery of Salvation can never be fully understood without Philosophy, not in its just latitude, as it is an Al~plication of God to Nature, and a Conversion of Nature to God, in whicl~ two Motions and their Means, all spiritual and natural knowledge is comprehended."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"COMRlENTS UPON THE FIRST PARAGRAPH. ,And I heard the Angel of the Waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.\" (Rev. xiv. 5). Here we find at once our author falling in with the \" weak consciences\" he expected to deal with, and for the xnoment taking the literal meaning of the sacvcd owzcles. \" For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water.\" (St. John v. 4.) .'And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.\" (Gen. i. 2.) Then he circumstantially states his opinion that God's \\Vork does not disgrace God's Word, and his object is \" to show that God is conversalit with matter though he be not tied to it.\" It is curious to note that Professor Tyndal in his famous Belfast Address to the British Association for the Advancement of Science made an almost identical appeal to his audience saying :- ': Spirit and matter haw ever been presented to us in the rl~dest contrast, the one as all noble, the other as all-vile. Supposing that, instead of having the foregoing antithesis of spirit and matter presented to our vouthful minds, we had been taught to regard them as equally worthy and equally wonderful; to consider them as two opposite faces of the self-same mystery. . . , , Look- ing at matter not as brutc matter but as the living garment of God ; do you not think the law of relativity might have had an outcome different from its present one. Without this total Revolution of the notions now prevalent, the Evolution hypothises must stand condemned (for what is the core, the essence of this hypothesis ? Strip it naked"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"and you stand face to face with the notion that not the more ignoble forms of animalculx but the human body, the hurnan mind itself, emotion, intellect, will, and all their phenomena were once latent in a fiery cloud) ; but in many profoundly thoughtful minds such a revolution has already taken place. They degrade neither member of the mysterious duality referred to, but they exalt one of them from its abasement, and repeal the divorce hitherto existing between both. In substance, if not in words, their position as regards the relation of spirit and matter is ; ' What God hath joined together let not man put asunder.' \" It is necessary in this place to make a slight digression on the nature of God according to the Ancients. \" The Egyptians recognised a divinity only in those cases where they perceived a fixed law either of permanence or change. The Earth abides, so do the Heavens, Days, Months, Seasons; these show a regularity which was called Maat. The Gods are called possessors of MaGt or subsisti~~g through Mast. Truth and Justice are but forms of Maat applied to human action\" (Renouf, Introduction to the PnPyrr~s of Ani). Beyond these the Egyptians believed in the Unnameable One. He whose throne the plumes of Amen's headdress barely touch. (The Hebrew root Amen, AMN, signifies stability.) Among the Jews, the \" Jehovah \" holy as He was, existed only as the manifesting deity taking form in the world of matter as the holy living creatures, the forces of heat, moisture, cold and dryness ; or on another plane developing as spirit, soul, mind and matter. But the real Being of Deity was called \" Ehyeh,\" the \" I am that I am,\" and behind Him was the Potential Being or Ain Soph Aur. For it is written \" His is the Mind, Theirs are the powers.\" In the same w2y Krahma the Universe separated its body into two halves ; Vimj, the spiritual, intelligent nature, and Vnclz or the manifest expression of the eternal divine Idea-"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"tion. Kut this was not the same as the Great Brah~n, or \" Great Breath \" breathing out for millions of years, and again breathing in for the same period, becorning alternately manifest and unmanifest. So far we have spoken of the Macrocosmic God or Macroprosopus. Of the Microprosopus ; the Microcosmic God of the New Testament, He through whom we can approach the vast ideal which the human brain is too small to grasp, we need not here speak further. I must now deal shortly with the occult meaning of the Fall. The Fall means more especially-fallen into generation or corruptibility. When Isis let loose Typhon after his imprisonment by Horus, her enraged son destroyed her royal diadem and cut off her head, but Thoth-in one sense the moon god, replaced it by a cow's head. That is to say, when in the course of cosmic evolution Prirnzval chaos seemed to return as ruler of night and winter, the child of the spirit moving on the waters of creation laid low the glorious mother who had borne him. She. became the Nature Goddess of the earth the symbol of fruitfulness, the sacred cow, the increaser of harvest. Henceforth the processes of change became recognised as gods or \" fixed laws ; \" death and corruption which for a time seem like annihilation, being some of these. Of the teaching of the Qabalah on the Fall I have only room to quote the following paragraph from S. L. Macgregor Mathers' Introduction to the Kabaialz Ull~EilEd. \" The first two letters of Jehovah I and H are the father and mother of Microprosopns \" (or the supernal Adam) ib and the H final is hisbride \" (or Eve). \" But in these forms is expressed the equilibrium of severity and mercy. Mercy being masuline and severity feminine. Excess of Mercy is merely weakness, but Excess of Severity calls forth the evil and oppressive force which is synibolised by Leviathan. Wherefore it is said ' Behind the shoulders of the Bride, the Serpent rears his head.' Of the Bride9' (the cow-headed"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Isis) \"not the Supernal Mother\" (Isis crowned with the Royal diadem) \" for she bruises the head of the Serpent.\" The serpent is the centripetal force, ever seeking to pene- trate paradise, and \" thereby constricting the efflux of divine radiation,\" which is centrifugal. The Adam Qadmon's exchange of the Garden of Eden for knowledge and death, nus st be talcen to mean the exchange of untreated thought into differentiation and evolution, resulting finally in the creation of a nlaterial universe. On this subject much may be learnt from thc first book of the Diuim P~~i1uz7idt:~, published in this series ; in the Seven- teenth book it is written :- \" Moreover the things that are made are visible, but Ht: is invisible; and for this cause hi: ~n~zh&flt ~JZCIIZ, that he IIZLIJJ be visible ; and therefore he ~nalieth them always.\" So we see that the Eternal one being defined, saw a rcflec- tion of hinlself; and the love he bore his image emanated as a third form, the Supernal h'lother who aspireth to the Wisdom which is beyond. So is the Supernal triad formed. In like rnanner the Holy Triad, reflected and defined, became the throne whereon the holy deific form was seated, and the Hexagram of the Macroprosopus was reflected unto the Heart of the hlicroprosopus. And in this sense are to be understood the words written on the mummy case of Panehen~isis, \" The heart of hlan is his own God.\" Around the image in thc sanctuary of our hearts is the firmament and the powers, and below are the Kerubim or Living Creatures. In his book cntitled Lu~~zctz dt: Lunzine, our author laments the separation that has taken place between the Elemental, Celestial, and Spiritual Sciences, for he says, these three are branches of one tree. '. Out of one universal root, the Chaos, grew all specified natures and their individuals.\""},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"I must deal shortly with the nature of Chaos as understood by the ancients, because in the present volume our author evades any dcfinite explanation of it. Chaos, the Abyss or \" Great Deep \" was personified among the Egyptians by Neith ; the only one co~taining all-with- out form or sex, giving birth to itself without fecundation. She was adored under the form of a Virgin Mother. She is the Father-Mother, the immaculate Virgin. She is called the Lady of the Sycamore, and is represented as dispersing the waters of the Tree of Life. She is the Hythos of the Gnostics, The One of the Neoplatonists, The All of the German Mctaphpsicians, the Anaita of Assyria. Now from this root or chaos sprang all manifestations, divine, celestial, and elemental, and these three are one, and if separated from each other are like the dead branches cut from the parent stem. For some pages our author dwells on the exoteric meaning of the scriptures in a manner that concerns the modern thinker very little. Rut we must bear in memory the intoler- ance and bigotry that prevailed at the period, and that twenty years later Spinoza forfeited all worldly advantages by asserting that the vulgar interpretation of the Sacred Oracles had led to much error. However, Thomas Vaughan having paid his tribute to \"weak consciences:\" touches us all when he says, \" God minds the Restitution of Nature in general, and not of Man alone, . . . . who is hut a small part of nature. Re- generation, Illumination and Grace, signify a new influence of Spirit. If God and Nature be one, how much nlore shall man and nature be one.\" Emerson has said in this relation, '* Indeed we are but Shadows we are not endowed with real life and all that seems most real about us is but the thinnest substance of a dream, till the heart be touched by nature.

Philosophy or the passion for wisdom stimulates the intellect, as religion stimulates the emotions : these passions or expansions of the Ego carry it beyond the limits of its own being, and tend to merge it in the all being. Here the cen- trifugal or redeeming force is free to act, and the constric- tions of- matter cease. When the Passions of the Emotions and the Intellect are set free, the Experience of Elemental Nature can be judged with safety. This then is the Esoteric meaning of the -' Unity with God.\" \" I ail1 in my father, and ye i;i me, and I iri you.\" (St. John x. 14-20.) Compare again, \" His is the mind, theirs are the powers \" of the Chal- dean Oracles. For the perfect man stands between the finest ether and the coarsest matter, and his spirit must penetrate all. For the world, religion means, as Cardinal Newrilan puts it, \"the knowledge of God, of His will, and of our duties towards Him.\" Separating Him as a formal notion from His works, cutting Him off as a branch from the Tree of. Life of which He is the very root and being. Therefore to the ini- tiated it is no blasphemy to say that such religion is a vanity and vexation of spirit. The world holds many half evolved personalities who have to live and learn much before they can be conscious of the latent complexities of their own natures. Their hour has not yet come. But for the more fully developed,-life daily sounds undreamed of harrrionies. Just as in modern music the most acute emotion is produced by subtle changes of key, so the human being in passing from one aspect to another of a highly complex existence intensifies and en-"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"riches his being with experiences, undreamed of by the undeveloped man, just as little as, by the masters of the simple harmonies of ancient music. Our author's first paragraph ends with the clear statement that without philosophy, or the passion for wisdom, salvation cannot be understood. Again he pleads for the union of the divine, the celestial, and the natural ; for he says the very nature of the highest existence is the union and synthesis of the diverse products of differentiation. Can we not dimly comprehend from this principle how it is that each day of Brahma (or manifestation of the Universe) enriches and beautifies the night of his repose ; how Nirvana becomes more and more exquisite ill its subtle harmonies, as beings are prepared for it by finer and finer complexities and variations of parts. To speak then of God without Nature, is more than we can do, for we have not known him so, and to speak of Nature without God, is more than we may do, for we should rob God of his Glory, and attribute those Effects to Nature, which belong properly to God, and to the spirit of God, which works in Nature. We shall therefore use a mean form of speech, between these extremes, and this form the Scriptures have taught us, for the Prophets and Apostles, have used no other. Let not any man therefore be offended, if in this Discourse we shall use Scripture to prove Philosophy, and Philosophy to prove Divinity, for of a truth our"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"knowledge is such, that our Divinity is not without Nature nor our Fhilosophy without God. Notwith- standing, I dare not think but most men will repine at this course, though I cannot think, wherefore they should, for when I joyne Scripture and Philosophy, I do but join God and Nature, an union certainly approved of by God, though it be condemned of men. Hut this perverse ignorance, how bold soever it be, I shall not quarrel with, for besides Scripture, I have other grounds, that have brought me very fairely, and soberly to this Discourse. COMhjENTS UPON THE SECOND PARAGRAPH. This is a recapitulation of- the general principle that God and Nature,-Scripture and Philosophy-are to be joined together and not separated from each other in our minds. I have sojourn'd now for some years, in this great Fabric, which the fortunate call their World : and certainly I have spent my time like a Traveller, not to purchase it, but to observe it. There is scarce anything in it, but hath given me an occasion of some thoughts ; but that which took me up much, and soon, was the continual1 action of fire upon water. This Speculation (I know not how) surpris'd my first youth, long before I saw the University, and certainly Nature, whose"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"pupil 1 was, had even then awaken'd many notions in me, which I met with afterwards, in the Platonic Philosophy. I will not forbear to write, how I had then fancied a certain practice on water, out of which, even in those childish dayes, I expected wonders : but certainly neither gold, nor silver, for I did not so much as think of them, nor of any such covetous artifice. This Consideration of my self, when I was a Child, has made me since examine Children, namely, what thoughts they had of these elements, we see about us, and I found thus much by them, that Nature in her simplicity, is much more, wise, than some men are with their acquired parts, and Sophistry, of a truth I thought my self bound to prove all things, that I might attain to my lawful desires, but least you think, I have only conversed with children I shall confess, I have con- vers'd with children and Fools too : that is, as I interpret it, with Children and Men, for these last are not in all things, as wise as the first. A Child, I suppose, in puris Naturalibus, Before education alters him, and ferments him, is a Subject hath not been much consider'd, for men respect him not, till he is company for them, and then indeed they spoil him. Notwithstanding I should think, by what I have read, that the natural disposition of Children, before it is corrupted with Customs and Manners, is one of these things, about which the Antient Philosophers have busyied themselves even to some curiosity. I shall not here express what I have"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"found by n~y own experience, for this is a point of foresight, and a ground by which wise men have attained to a certain Knowledge of Morals, as well as Saturals. PAKAGRAPH IV. But to return from this Digression, to the Principles first proposed, namely Fire and Water, I shall borrow my entrane into this discourse, from my famous Country-man Rice of Chester, who speaking of this Art, delivers hin~self thus. Lks hoec (saith he), de Philosophia occulta est ; est de illa parte Yhilosophiae quae Meteora tractat ; Loquitur enim, haec Ars non solu~n de elevatione et depressione Elementorum, sed etian~ Elementatorunl.

These words, if the Mysteries they involve and relate to were distinctly laid down, would make an endless Discourse ; for they contain all that Nature doth: and all that art can do. Rut that we may in some order, and as far as Conscience will permit, ex- press what they signifie : IVe do first say, That God is the principal and sole Author of all things, who by his IVord and Spirit hath forrn'd and manifested those things we see, and even those things which at present we cannot see. As for the matter whereof he formed"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"them, it being a substance pre-existent, not only to us, but to the world itself, most men may think the know- ledge of it impossible, for how shall we know a thing that was so long before us, and which is not now extant with us, nor ever was (in their opinion) since the creation ? To this objection, which at first sight may seem invincible, we shall return an answer that shall break it ; for we will show how and by what means, we came to know this matter, and not only to know it, but after long labours to see it, handle it, and taste it. It is evidence enough that every Individual (suppose man himself) is made of a seed, and this seed when the body is perfected, appears no more, for it is altered and transformed to a body. However that self-same body does afterwards yield a seed which is the very same in nature with that original first seed whereof the body was made. I presume then, that he that would know the generation of man, needs not look back so far as Adam to know the first seed, for if Nature still affords the like, what needs that fruit less retrogradation ? It is even so with the world, for it was originally made of a seed, of a seminal viscous humidity or water, but that seed (as we have said in our Aphorisms) disap- peared in the Creation, for the Spirit of God that moved upon it transformed it, and made the world of it. Howsoever that very world doth now yield and bring forth out of its own body a secondary seed, which is the very same in essence and substance with that primitive general seed whereof the world was made. And if any"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"man shall ask what use nature makes of this general seed, and wherefore she yields it ; I answer, that it is. not to make another world of it, but to maintain that world with it which is made already. For God Almighty hath so decreed that his creatures are nourished with the very same matter whereof they were formed, and in this is verified tha,t maxim which otherwise would be most false : Ex iisdem nutrimur, ex quibus constamus. We seek not much whence our own nutriment comes, nor that of beasts, for both provisions are obvious* But what is that which feeds Grass, Herbs, Corn and all sorts of trees with their fruits? IVhat is it that restores and supplies the earth, when these copious and innumerous products have for the greatest part of the year lived sucking on her breasts and almost exhausted her? I am afraid they will speak as they think and affirm it is water, but what skilful assertors they are shall appear hereafter. COMMEXTS UPON THE FIFTH PAICAGKAlPH. Thomas Vaughan begins by defining the creative deity as the formulator and manifestor of the visible world. He pictures him as an artificer working upon pre-existent sub- stance. As I have already pointed out, this idea is that of the Jehovah of the Jews in relation to the Ehyeh and Ain Suph Aur. This latter principle must, however, be regarded by us at prcsent as the Divine Neith or Chaos, also explained in the notes on the first paragraph. This fundamental virgin substance is only to be understood, says Vaughan, by the study of seeds."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Now if we cut open any moderate-sized seed, we shall find an outer covering, two masses of starchy matter, and a root or radicle. In the root we have the image of the One from whom spri~lg the many ; in the two halves the positive and negati1.e nourishing or preserving principles ; and in the coat or cover the constricting force without which manifest form is i~n- possible, but which must be overcome for growth to take place. The seed planted in the ground becomes a sugary f<;eculent mass, and in the midst of putrefaction and fermentation the new living being grows and becomes manifest. The study of embryology takes us a long way towards the solution of the rnystery of life. We start with the protyle or protoplasm of modern science, we trace the beginnings of a human being through stages akin to the mollusc, the fish, the reptile, and the monkey. This protyle or secondary chaos, which so much resembles the Hyle or sediment of the waters of creation is most evident to the unscientific mind in the scum of a stagual~t pool. &I. I'asteur has shewn us that the air is full of microscopic life, that it can be found everywhere, from the bloom of a peach to the liver of a pig; that it can be taken thence and made to germinate in any gelatine, syrup, or glycerine basis; that the white corpuscles of blood are minute living organisms. capable of being oxygenated, and that they, like gold, beconie red in the process. This is no doubt a materialistic transla- tion of our author's meaning ; but the evolution of the highest is similar to the evolution of the lowest, as is taught us by the Emerald Tablet of Herines. A11 my researches lead me to consider that the great mystery of the origin of life consists almost entirely of a measure of temperattu-c.

PARAGRAPH VI. Certainlv, even that which we eat ourselves, and beasts also, proceeds all of it from the same fountain, but before it comes to us it is altered, for animals feed on particulars, but vegetables abstract this sperm immediately in its heavenly universal form. Notwith- standing I would not have this so understood, as if this seed did serve only to nourish, for many thing, are made of it, and especially that subterraneous family of minerals and metals. For this thing is not water, otherwise than to the sight, but a coagulable fat humidity, or a mixture of fire, air and pure earth, over- cast indeed with water, and therefore not seen of any nor known but to few. In vegetables it oftentimes appears, for they feed not as some think, on water, but on this seminal viscosity that is hid in the water. This indeed they attract at the roots, and from thence it ascends to the branches, but sometimes it ha~prns by the way to break out at the bark where meeting with cold air, it subsists and congeals to a gum. This congela- tion is not sudden but requires some small time, for if you find while it is fresh it is of an exceedingly subtle moisture, but glutinous for it will spin into strings as small as any hair, and had it passed up to the branches, it had been formed, in time, to a plum or cherry."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"This happens to it by cold, and above ground, but in the bowels of the earth it is congealed by a sulphureous heat into metals and if the place of its congelation be pure, then into a bright metal, for this sperm is im- pregnated with light, and is full of the star fire, from whence all metals have their lustre, The same might be said of pearls and precious stones, this starry seed being the Mother of the all, for when it is mineralised by itself and without any faeculent mixture, then, Vomit igniculos suos it sheds and shoots its fires, and hath so ~nuch of heaven that if we did not know the conspiracy we should wonder how it could love the earth.

COMMENTS UPON THE SIXTH PAKAGIIXPH. This calls attention to the fact that difference of circuin- stance alone congeals the prima materia into metals, vege- tables, or animals. We know very well that between the lowest forms of animal and vegetable life, between the small water fungi and the hydra or ameba there is very little to choose; in fact, if we look upon the brain of an animal as corresponding to the root of a tree, we shall find extraordinary similarities even in the more complex developments of the two great kingdoms.

This Figure is Raymond Lullie's, and in the centre of it you see the first Hyle, or matter whereof the world mas made. In this Hyle (saith Raymond) alf the Elements and all natural Principles, as well as Means and Extremes, were mingled potentially, in fortlla confusa Aquae ; and this primitive Spermatic ocean filled all that space which we now attribute to the air, for (saith he) Attingebat usque ad circulum Lunarem. Out of this central Hyle (with wllich we have now done) did rise all those Principles and Bodies which jron find written in the circumference of the Figure and here begins our Philosophy. In the first place over the Hyle, yo11 see the Elements of the visible created world, whose parts are con~inonly called Elements, namely Earth, ate, Air and Heaven, for there is no other fire but that Ignis fatuus, which Aristotle kindled under the ~Ioo~. Fronl the elements on the right hand, by rarefaciion and resolu- tion of their substance, y 011 see derived another Princi- ple, namely ITapores Elemen torum the Vapours of the Elements or the clouds, in which vapours the inferior and superior Natures meet and are there married, and out of their mixture results that secondary Sperm or"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Chaos Philosophica!, which we look for.

Et illa est Res (saith Lullie) argent0 vive vivo magis propinqua, quae quidem reperitur supra terram currens, fluens. The fourth Principle, which Nature immediately generates by congelation out of the substance or viscosity or the Aqueous universal Mercury is the glassy Azoth, which is a certain fiery sulphureous masculine Minera ; and this is gold philosophical, the sulphor, the earth, and the Male, as the viscous Water is the Mercury and the female. The rest of the Prin- ciples which are ranged in the Figure, are artificial Principles, and cannot be known or manifested without art, excepting the seventh and last Principle, which is either gold or silver, for these are perfect metals and Ferments that specify the medicine which of itself is universal, and reduce it to a particular disposition and effect. Thus far we thought fit to deal plainly with you, and for the practice part of this Figure, we shall wave it, lor we had rather speak nothing than to speak that we cannot be understood. I daresay there are some writers who rejoice in their own riddles, and take a special pleasure to multiply those difficulties which are numerous enough already. For my part I shall not put you to a trial of wit, you may take the rest from their author, and thus expose you to no other"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"hazard, but what I have been formerly exposed to myself. IVe shall now again return to our theory and to make our entrance we say, that fire begins every motion, and motion begins generation. For if the Elements or parts of this material world did all of them stand in suis terminis (on their own bases) such a cessation would produce nothing. To prevent this, the Almighty God placed in the heart of the world, namely in the earth (as he did in the heart of every other creature) a fire-life which Paracelsus calls the Llrchaeus and Sendivow the Central Sun. This Fire, lest it should consume its own body the earth, he hath overcast with a thick, oily saltish water, which we call the sea, for sea water, (as we have tried) not to speak of its salt, is full of a sulphureous volatile fatness, which doth not quench fire like the common water, but feeds it. The like Providence we see in the bodies of animals whose heat or life is tempered with a sulphure- ous, saltish moisture, namely with blood, and the blood with the breath, as the sea is with wind and air. Over this Archaeus, or central fire, God hath placed in his heaven the sun and the stars, as he hath placed the head and the eyes over the heart. For between Man and the world there is no small accord, and he that knows not the one can never know the other. \\Ve may observe also, that the wind passeth between the inferior and superior Fires, that is between the cen- tral and celestial sun, and in man the breath liath all its liberty and motion between the heart and the eyes,"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"that is between the fire and the light that is in us. We feel moreover in man and the world, a most even correspondency of effects, for as the blood, even so the sea hath a constant pulse or agitation, both spirits stirring and working alike in their bodies. Nor ought we to neglect another consideration, That the light of the world is in the superior parts of it, namely in the sun and stars, but the original fire from whence these sparks fly upwards appears not, but lives imprisoned in the earth, even so certainly, all the brightness of man is in his face, for there he slleds his light at the eyes, but the first source of it, namely that fire which is at the heart, is no more seen than that which is in the earth. Only this we may say, that both these im- prisoned forces are manifested to reason by the same effects, namely by the pulse, that the one causeth in the blood arid the other in the sea, to which may be added that transpiration or evaporation of humours, which both these spirits produce alike in their several bodies. And that we may fr~rtl~er prove that these terms of Archaeus and Sol Centralis are not vain words, let us but consider what a strong heat is required to this sublimation of vapours and eshalations, for it is not simple water that is driven upwards, but abundance of salt and oil together with the water. If any man thinks the sun can do this, I must tell him he knows not the operations of the sun, nor for what use it serves in nature. The sun serves only to dry up the superfluous humidity which the night leaves behind her on the out-"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"side of things, for this makes all vegetables cold and flaccid, hinders their digestion and maturity. But the sun with a clear heat, taking off that extraneous moisture, forwards their concoction, and helps to ripen that which is raw. This unust be done with a most gentle heat, not with such as shall make the earth to smoke and extract clouds from it, for this would not bring things to a maturity, but rather burn and calcine them. 11-e know that if we stand long in the sun we shall grdw faint, and common fire will not b~lrn in the light of it, for the sun, which is the true element of fire, attracts it, so that by degrees it goes off and forsakes his fuel. But if you con~~ey the fire out of the sun, then it mill more strongly apply to the fuel and unite itself to it and burn it. It is just so with the earth, for while the heat of the sun is present the heat of the earth is more busy with the sun than with its own body. For as Sendevow hath well written, In superficie Terrae liadii radiis junguntur. 111 the face of the earth the beams of both luminaries meet, and there is such a conspiracy between fire and fire that the central breaking forth to meet the celestial suffers a kind of estasy and doth not much mind his own body. Give me leave to speak thus, for there is such an afinity between these two, that they had rather join with one another than with any third nature, 1)ut that is it which cannot but be in part and by way of influence, God having confined the one to the centre, and the other tothe circumference. I could demonstrate"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"this sympathy by a most noble magnetism, which I have seen to my admiration, between the sun and sweet oil, or rather the fire and soul of Nitre, and here I shall tell you that the earth is full of nitre, nay I must affirm that pure earth is nothing else but Nitre, whose belly is full of wind, air and fire, and which differs no more from heaven than the root of a tree that lodgeth in the dirt, doth from the branches of it that grow in the sunshine. This attraction of fire by tire is the true cause why the heat of the earth is so weak in summer, and so strong in winter, for in the winter when the sun is absent, the central fire keeps altogether within the earth, and being irritated by an hostile invasion of cold, heats the waters much more vigorously, so that exhala- tions and clouds are far more copious in the winter than they are in the summer, which could not be if the sun were the cause of them. Add to this, that an outward dry heat, as that of the sun is, falling immediately on the earth, must needs burn the earth before it can make it smoke, but an inward fire, that is mingled with the moisture of the earth, cannot burn, be it never so intense, for it is qualified with the water, and tempered to a moist heat, and without doubt such a fire may very naturally reso!ve some parts of the earth, and cause them to exhale as our own inward heat, being nloisened with the blood, makes us sweat without any violence. To reduce all this to a Corrollary we say that in the winter God seals the face of the earth with frost and cold, as a man would seal a glass, and this is"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"to keep in the congelative Spermatic Humidity, which otherwise might ascend with the more crude vapours that break out copiously at that time and filling the sphere of the air take in, like so many sponges, the celestial vital influences. For we must know, that nature begins to impregnate the earth about the end of autumn, and continues it all winter, the fiery, subtle influx of the heavens being then condensed by the cold and moisture of the moon, who is regent all the winter and elevated above the sun. This you may see in snow, which falls in hard frost, which being taken up while it is fresh, and digested in a Blind Glass in ashes for twenty-four hours, if then you open the glass whilst the solution is warm, you shall perceive in the breath of the water all the odours of the world, and certainly far nlore pleasant than they are in the flowers at May. Look into the bottom of the glass and you shall find there a fat grey slime, not unlike to Castile soap, separate the phlegm from it by a soft distillation in balneo, and put the residue in a Boltshead well stopped, in a dry heat of ashes, keep it then warm for an hour or two, and suddenly the glass will fly to pieces, for the wind, the life or spirit, is not well fetled in the body.

This puts me in mind of an opinion I have read some- times in the Cabalists ; namely that this bulk or body we have attained to by attraction and transmutation of nutriment, riseth not in the resurrection, but out of that seminal particle, which originally attracting the nutriment, did overcast itself therewith, there shall spring another new body, and this seminal particle (say they) lurketh somewhere in the bones, not in that part which moulders into dust.

Certainly iE we judge rightly, we must confess that this seminal particle is our only original fundamental matter, the rest being but an accretion that comes from the extraneous substance of meat and drink. \\\\'hat loss is it then if we lay by this corrupt accretion or access of matter, for cannot He that made us at first of the seminal particle, make us of it again ?

Vaughan here returns to Mr. Rice. of Chester, or Khaesus Cestrensis, whose Latin aphorism was quoted in the third paragraph, and deals with the meaning of the word elernen- tates or secondary elements, which are generated in the same manner as simple elements by the application of a gentle heat and nioisture. Then our author is reminded of the association of the re- incarnating ego with the os coccygis by the Jews; after a lengthy digression on this subject, he hints that particular minerals are to be regenerated in the same way as universal elements; we presume he wishes to point out that in the same way as simple life is generated, so a complex being can also be regcnerated, It is worthy of note that phosphorus discovered by Brand in 1669, is prepared from bones, and has many properties in common with the secret fire of the Alchemists."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"50 PARAGRAPH XIT. To make this more clear, the vapours p called, rise from the sea, and from all fresh waters. These partake of the substance and qualities of such minerals as are in the water, some of them being bituminous, some saltish, some mercurial and all of them moist and phlegmatic. On the contrary, those exhalations that come from the earth are dry, for the earth is more hot and mineral than the water. These fiery earth fumes meeting with the cold vapours of the water, oftentimes produce most terrible tempests, some of these being nitrous, some arsenical, some sulphurous and all hot, and some by reason of their copious sulphur, inflammable. Both these, I mean the earthly exhalations and the watery vapour, meet in that vast circulatory of the air, where their contrary conlplexions of heat and cold are mingled together like agent and patient, or sulphur and mercury, and the particular Natures and Vapours which they acquired from the minerals, are resolved by the wind, and totally reduced into general principles. It is strange to consider what a powerful resolving faculty there is in wind or air, for wind is no other thing than air stirred, and that by fire, as we feel in man, that the motion of the breath is caused by heat, as well as that of the blood, both proceeding from the same hot principle of life. So certainly the life of the world causeth wind or a commotion in the sir as well as a flux in the sea, for both these are seas, and have"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"their fluxes, as we shall prove elsewhere more fully. *Air then, as we have said, resolves all things, and especially wind, for it resolves all salts into water, and if this solution be distilled, we shall find some part of the salt reduced into fresh water. :IS for the residue, if it be exposed to the wind, it will resolve again, and you nmy distil it the second time. In a word, if you repeat this process, you will bring the whole body of the salt into a volatile fresh water, nothing different from the common either in sight or taste. And here you must not think your salt is lost, for if -ou know how to congeal the water, you will find it again, but so altered from what it was, that you will wonder to see it. This practice, if well understood, sufficientiy declares the nature of air ; but he that knows where to find con- gealed air, and can dissolve it by heat to a viscous water, he hath attained to something that is excellent. Much more I could say of this wonderful and spiritual element, whose penetrating, resolving faculty I have sometimes contemplated in this following and simple experiment. Common quicksilver hath a miraculous union of parts, and of all compounds is the strongest excepting gold ; for if you distil it by retort a hundred times, it will be quicksilver still notwithstanding all those reiterated rarefactions of his body. But if you take a thousand weight of it, and vapour them away but once in thc open air, it will never come to quicksilver again ; for the fumes will be lifted up to the wind, where they will suffer a total dissoluticn, and will conle down"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"as mere rain-water. This is the very reason why also the vapours of the elements are lifted up to the middle region of the air ; for there the wind is most cold, and hath most liberty, and in no other place can their resolution, which Nature intends, be perfected. This if understood, is a most noble secret of Nature : nor was Job ignorant of it, when complaining of the decays of his own body, he delivered himself thus. ~11. 111 \" Thou lifteth me up to the wind, Thou \\-. 22. causeth me to ride upon it, and dissol~eth 7 1 rup substance.

C. that those who would be proficients in this art should studv the elements and their operation before they seek after the tinctures of metals. It is to be wished indeed that men would do so, for then we should not have so many broilers, and so few philosophers. But here it may be questioned, who is he that studies the elements for any such end as to observe and imitate their operations? For in the Universities, we study them only to attain, to a false book theory, whereof no use can be made but quacking, disputing, and making a noise. Verily the doctrine of the Schoolmen hat11 allayed and per- verted even that desire of knowledge which God planted in man. For the traditions we receive there, coming from our superiors, carry with.them the awe of the tutor, and this breeds in us an opinion of their certainty ; so that a University man cannot in all his lifetime, attain to so much reason and confidence as to look beyond his lesson. 1 have often wondered that any sober spirits can think ;Iristotle's philosophy perfect, when it consists in mere words without any further effects ; for of a truth the falsity and insuffi- ciency of a mere notional knowledge is so apparent that no wise man will assert it. This is best known to the physicians, who when they have been initiated in this whirligig, are forced at last to leave it, and to assume new principles, if they will be such as their"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"profession requires they should be. Aristotle will very gravely tell us: Ubi definit Philosophus, ibi incipit Medicus; But I admire what assistance a physician can receive from this philosopher, whose science tells us : Scientia non est particularium ; for without particulars a physician can do nothing. But in good earnest, did not .\\ristotle's science (if he had any) arise from particulars, or did it descend immediately from universals ? If from universals, how came he to be acquainted with them ? did he know the genus, before he knew the species, or the species before the individuals ? I think not ; he knew the individual first, and having observed his nature and propriety, he applied that to the whole species ; or to speak sense,. to all individuals of that kind : and this application made that knowledge general, which at first was particular, as being deduced from a particular object. This is true, and Aristotle will tell us so, though he give himself the lie ; for elsewhere he affirms, Nihil esse in intellectu, quod non fuit prius in sensu. 1bThich if it be true then \"Scientia non est par- ticularium\" is false. But I have done with him at present, and for my own part I have learnt long ago not of Aristotle but of Roger Bacon, Quod communia pauci sunt valoris, nec proprie sequenda, nisi propter particularia. And this is evident in all practices and professions that conduce anything to the benefit of man. For Nature herself hath imprinted the Universal notions and conceptions in every soul, whether learned"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"or unlearned, so that we need not study Universals, and this our Friar had observed ; for saith he. In cornmunibus Aninli conceptionibus vulgus concordat cum sapientihus ; in particularibus vero, et propiis errat et discordat. And for this very reason, he condemns Xristotle and Galen. Quia in comrnunibus et univer- salibus se occupaverunt, et perducti sunt ad senectu- tem, vitam consumentes in pejoribus ct vulgatis, nec vias ad haec secreta nlagna perceperunt. Let not us do as those Hebrews did, though in this very point the greatest part of the world follows them. Let us rather follow where Nature leads ; for the having irn- pressed these Universals in our mind, hath not done it in vain, but to the end we should apply them to out- ward sensible particulars, and so attain to a true experimental knowledge, which in this life is our only crown and perfection. If a man should rest in the bare theory of husbandry, and only read Virgil's Georgics, never putting his hand to the plough, I suppose this theory could not help him to his daily bread : and if we rest in the notions and names of things never touching the things themselves, we are like to produce no effects, nor to cure any diseases, without which performances philosophy is useless, and not to be numbered amongst our necessities.

This element is the deferent, or Vehiculum of all influences whatsoever : for --hat efflux so ever it be that proceeds from the terres- trial centre, the same ascends and is carried up in her to the air. And on the contrary all that comes from Heaven descends in her to the earth, for in her belly the inferior and superior natures meet and mingle, nor can they be manifested without a singular artifice. Hence it IS that whatsoever is pure in the earth, all that she receives from the water: and here I mean such pure substances as are called by the philosophers 1)ecomposita ; for the eagle leaves her egg, that is to say, the water leaves her Limosity in the earth, and this limosity is connected into nitre, and to ather innurrierous minerals. We have formerly told you of two suns or fires, the celestial and the central. Now both these dispense their effluxions, or influences, and they meet in the vapour of the water ; for the Vulcan, or earthly sun, makes the water ascend to the region of the air, and here the water is spread under the superior fires, for she is esposed to the eye of the sun, and to the pointed ejaculations of all the fixed stars and"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"planets, and this in a naked, rarefied, opened body. The air, of a truth, is that temple, where inferiors are married to their superiors ; for to this place the heavenly light descends, and is united to the aereal oleous h~irnidity, which is hid in the belly of the water; this light being hotter than the water, malies her turgid and vital, and increaseth her seminal ~iscous moisture ; so that she is ready to depose her sperm or limosity, were she but united to her proper male. Hut this cannot be unless she returns to her own country, I mean the earth, for here the collastrum, or ma!e resides. To this purpose she descends hither again, and immediately the male lays hold upon her, and his fiery sulphureous substance unites to her limosity. And here observe that this sulphur is the father in all metallic generations, for he gives the masculine fiery soul, and the water gives the body, namely, the linlosity or heavenly aqueous nitre, whereof the body, by coagulation is made. \\Ire must know, moreover, that in this sulphur there is an impure extraneous heat, which gnaws and corrodes this watery Venus, endeavouring to turn her to an impure sulphur, such as his owfi body is ; but this cannot be, because of the heavenly seed or light hid in the aqueous nitre, which will permit no such thing, for as soon as the sulphureous terrestrial heat begins to work, so soon it awakes and stirs up the heavenly light, which, being now fortified with the masculine tincture, or pure fire of the sulphur, begins to work on its own body, namely, on the aqueous nitre, and separates from it, the feculent"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"extraneous parts of the sulphur, and so remains by itself a bright celestial metalline body. Observe then, that the tincture or soul of the sulphur cannot be regenerated in its own impure body, but it must forsake that dark and earthy carcase, and put on a new purified body before it can be united to the light of Heaven, This new body springs out of the water, for the water brought it down from Heaven, and certainly by water and spirit we must be all regenerated ; which made some learned divines affirm that the element of water was not cured, but only that of the earth. Nor can I here omit the doctrine of St. John, who makes the water one of those three witnesses which attest God here on earth. And much to this purpose is that speech of St. Paul: How that God in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways, but nevertheless (saith he), he left not himself without a witness, inasmuch as he gave them rain from Heaven, etc. The benedictions or blessings that descend from God, are not a form of words, like the benedictions of men ; they are all spirit and essence, and their Deferents are natural visible substances, and these are the Gen. blessings which the Patriarch wished to his son : \" God give thee of the dew of Heaven from above, and of the fatness of the earth from beneath.\" He was not ignorant of those blessings, which the God of Nature had enclosed in those natural things ; and therefore He saith in the same place :"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"cL The stme11 of my son is like the smell of a field, which the Lord hath blessed.\" And St. Paul in his epistle to the Hebrews tells us : 'L That the earth, which drinketh in the rain, that coxneth oft upon it, receiveth blessing from God : but that which beareth thorns and briars is rejected and nigh unto cursing, whose end is to be burnt.\" COMhilENTS UPON THE EIGHTEENTH PARAGRAPH.

But to explain what this blessing is, we remember we have written elsewhere, that water is of Anthrop. a double complexion, circumferential and central. In the circumference she is crude, volatile and phlegmatic ; but in the centre she is better concocted, viscous, aereal, and fiery. This central part is soft and saltish, outwardly white and lunar, but in- wardly red and solar, nor can it be well extracted without a lunar or solar magnet, whose proper element it is, and with which it has a wonderful sympathy. Hence that obscure saying of the philosophers, who when they describe unto us their mercury, give it this character as most natural, Quod adhaxet corporibus. That it adheres to the bodies or metals. And as Pythagoras saith in the Turba, Suum absque igne con- sequitur socium. And therefore it is written in the same book, Magna est propinquitas inter magnesiam et ferrum. We see indeed by a vulgar experience, that if any ordinary stone stands long but in common water there sticks to it a certain limosity, which the water deposeth. But notwithstanding all this, and all they say, we must needs affirm, that even their mercury adheres not to the vulgar metals ; and in this word mercury, as in all other terms, they are not a little an-ibiguous and subtle.

This author confessed he miscarried two hundred times, not- withstanding his knowledge of the true matter, and this because he did not know the fire or agent by which the matter is altered. These misfortunes of his own moved him it seems, to a commiseration of posterity ; but I must needs affirm he hath taken his liberty, and expressed his own mind after his own way. \"Our fire (saith he) is mineral, equal, continual ; it vapours not unless the heat be too great ; it participates of sulphur; it dissolves, calcines, and congeals all ; it is artificial to find, and not chargeable, and it is taken elsewhere than from the matter.\" To all this he adds that at last, whereof he would have us take notice. \" This fire (saith he) is not altered or transmuted with the matter.\" He thought certainly he had spoken enough, and truly so he hath but it is to such as know it already."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"COMMENTS UPON THE TWENTIETH PARAGRAPH.

Here again we have the symbolism of thought and gentle ~~ielancl~oly, purity, and finally practical power. For my own part I have found a certain mineral stinking water, which partakes of the nature of sulphur, and whose preparation is artificial, which is not of the essential parts of the matter, but accidental and extra- neous, which vapours not unless it be overheated, which dissolves, calcines, and congeals all, but is not con- uealed ; for it is expelled at last by the fire of nature, b and goes off in windy fumes.

In this respect it is called of some philosophers phlegma, ros, aqua nuhiunl ; not certainly that it is such, and therefore let us not deceive ourselves with n~isconstructions.

I sriid this fire effects that in the glass which common water doth in the great world ; for as this phlegmatic element coagulates not, nor is it at all diminished, notwithstanding that infinite number of individuals which Nature still produceth, even so it is so in our work; for our water also alters not, though the matter be altered in her belly, and our very princi- ples generated there, namely, sulphur and mercury philosophical.

For example, the earth cannot ascend, unless the water be first rarefied, for in the belly of the water is the earth carried up: and if the earth ascends not, having put off her gross body and being subtilated and purged with the water, then will not the air incorporate with it, for the moisture of the water introduceth the air into the rarefied and dissolved earth. And here again as the water reconciled the air to the earth, so doth the air reconcile the water to the fire, as if it would requite one courtesy with another; for the air with its unctuosity and fatness introduceth the fire unto the water, the fire following the air, and sticking to it as to its fuel and element. It remains now, that we observe, that the vapour of the water was the locus or matrix, wherein the other three ele- ments did meet, and without which they had never come together ; for this vapour was the deferend that carried up the pure virgin earth to be married to the sun and the moon, and now again she brings her down in her belly impregnated with the milk of the one and the blood of the other, namely, with air and fire, which principles are predominant in those two superior lumi- naries. But some wise ones, they argue and tell me,"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"that this vapour being thus impregnated may now be coagulated, and fixed, by help of those hot principles of air and fire. To this I answer that the viscous seminal part of the water may, but the phlegm never, and I will show as much by example. When this vapour is fully impregnated it stays no longer in that region, but returns presently to the earth from which it ascended. But how doth it return ? But Lumen de certainly not in a violent stormy precipita- lurnine. tion like rain, but as I have written else- where, it steals down invisibly and silently ; even if it be a vapour, such as I speak of, In quo est imaginatum semen astrale certi ponderis, then it is neither heard of nor seen till a long time after. But to proceed in what I have promised to do, I shall instance in comnlon dew: for dew hath in it sone small dose of the star fire. We see therefore that this humidity comes down silently, for its enclosed fire keeps it rarefied in the form of air, and will not suffer it to condense to water at that height as the vapour of rain doth, but when it is descended near the earth it mingles with other crude vapours, and borrowing from them a great quantity of phlegm settles at last into drops. But before we go any further let us here consider those words of the son of Sirach. LL Look (saith he) on all the works of the Most High, and there are two and two, one against the other.\" In this he agrees with that little fragment which goes under the name of Moses, where God teacheth him thus."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Scias, quod unicuique Creaturae, et compar, et con- trarium creavi. I will not peremptorily affirm that Moses is the author of this piece, or that God taught him in those very words, but I affirm that those words express the truth of God, and point at some great mysteries of His wisdom. Nor will I here omit a circun~stance, namely, that this piece hatb in it some Hebrew words, and this proves that the author was a Jew if not Moses. But to pass by the author and come to the sense; 1 say that God created water to oppose it to the earth, and this appears by their different complexions and qualities ; for the earth is gross and solid, the water, suhtil and fluid ; and the earth hath in her the coagulating, astringent power, as the water hat11 partly in it the softening dissolving faculty. The earth tlien shuts up herself and in herself the fire so that there can be no generation or vegeta- tion, unless the earth be opened, that the fire may be at liberty to work. This we may see in a grain of corn, where the astringent earthly faculty hath hound up all the other elements, and terminated then1 to a dry corn- pacted body. Now this body, as long as it is dry, or as Our Saviour saith, as long as it abidetll alone ; that is to say as long as it is without water, so long it can bear no fruit ; but if it falls into the ground and dies, that is to say, if it be dissolved there by the humidity of Heaven (for death is but dissolution) then it will bring forth much fruit, as Our Saviour testifieth. It is the water then that dissolves, and life followeth the disso-"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"lution ; for no sooner is the body opened, but the spirit stirs in it, perceiving in the dissolvent or dewy water, another spirit, to which he desires to be united. This spirit is the air enclosed in the dew or water, which air is called in the philosopher's books Aqua maris nostri, aqua vitae manus non madefaciens. But who will believe that there is a dry water hid in the moist ? certainly few : and this Sendivow tells us of some Sophisters of his acquaintance. Non credebant aquarn esse in mari nostro, et tarnen philosophi videri volebant. I have myself known many such philosophers, and of whom I say the very same. But to return to our business ; it is called aqua vitae, because this air involves in itself a fire, which is life Universal : not yet specified, and therefore it agrees with all particular lives, and is amicable to all kinds of creatures. Now the particular specified fire, or life of the grain, which is the vegetable magnet, attracts to himself the universal fire or life, which is hid in the water, and with the fire he attracts the air which is the vestiment or body of the fire, called by the Platonics, currus Anima, and sometimes Nimbus ignis descendentis. Here then is the ground upon which the whole mystery of natural augmentation and multiplication is built ; for the body of the grain of corn is augmented with the aliment of air, not simple but decomponded, which air is carried in the water, and is a kind of volatile sweet salt ; but the fire or life of the grain, is fortified with the universal fire, and this fire is involved in the air, as"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"the air is in the water. And here we may observe that it is not water only that conduces to the generation or regeneration of things, but water and fire; that is water and spirit, or water that hath life in it and this, if rightly understood, is a great manuduction to divinity. COMMENTS UPON THE TWENTY-SECOND PARAGRAPH. It is not the vehicle that coagulates, but the matter borne in the vehicle. Here it will be well to remember the Qabalistic definitions of the parts of the Soul. The Earth or The Nephesh is the aura or lower astral. The Water or The Neshamah is the throne of the spirit. The Fire or The Chiah, and Neshamah form the Wheels and the Throne of the Incarnating Ego (Yechidah) or the real spirit of the Triple Fire. While the air, or the human Ego, is the meeting place of the other forces. PAKAGRAPH XXIII. To conclude, the sum of all we would say is this, the roots and seeds of all vegetables are traced in the earth, in the midst of this dewy fountain, as a lamp is placed in the midst of oil ; and the fire or life of the seeds attracts to itself the abryssach or leffa, I mean the juice or gum of the water, as the fire of a lamp attracts the oil that is round about it. Now when all the air is drawn out of the water then the traction"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"ceaseth, and concoction or transmutation begins, but if the crude water, which was the vehiculum of the air stays with the seeds, then it hinders concoction, and therefore the sun and the archeus jointly expel her, so that she takes wing and returns to the region of the air, where again she fills her belly with that starry milk, and then descends as before. This is the reason why there is in nature such a vicissitude of showers and sunshine, for the showers bring down the aereal nutriment, and when the plants have attracted it, then the sunshine calls up the crude water, which otherwise would hinder digestion and coagulation. This then is the trade that common water drives, but if she could be coagulated, this trade would cease, and all life would cease with it. 1 have for many years looked upon her as on a bird that flies to her nest, and from it again, feeding her young ones, and fetching food for them. Now is this a new fancy of mine, for some learned men considered as much before ; in which respect that milky moisture which is found in her crystal breasts is called by some of then1 Lac vola- tilium, the milk of birds, and they have left it written, that birds do bring their stone unto them. To make an end, observe that there is a great differ- ence between this common water, and our chymical ater or fire, mentioned formerly out of Pontanus, for"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"our water helps coagulation and this hinders it. For if the phlegm, or crude spirit stays with the air, the air will never congeal ; and therefore said Sendivow, omnis aqua congelatur calido, si est sine spiritu, and thus have I demonstrated my position, namely that common water is not congealable. PARAGRAPH XXV. Nothing now remains, not is there anything hinders, but that we may safely and infallibly conclude, that simple crude water feeds nothing ; but the gum of congealable part of it feeds all things ; for this is the astral balsam and the elemental, radical humidity, which being compounded of inferiors and superiors, is a restorative both of spirits and bodies. This is the general vital element which God Himself provides for a11 His creatures, and which is yearly produced and manifested in the elements, by the invisible operation of his spirit, that works all in all. This hath in it the whole anatomy of Heaven and earth, whose belly is full of light and life, and when it enters into these lower parts of the world, it overcasts them with a certain virility, makes them break forth into flowers, and presents us with something that is very like to the paradise we have lost.

And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold upon the face of the wilderness there lay around small thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground, and when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, it is manna; for they wist not what it was, and Moses said unto them 'this is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.' \" Every child knows that dew settles into round drops ; and here Moses tells us that when the phlegmatic hurriidity was gone up, the congelative part that stayed behind, was a round small thing, for it retained still the figure of the drop, in whose belly it was hid. This coagulative part is oleous and fusible, and with this also the Scripture accords, telling us, tllat when the sun waxed hot, it rnelted. It is with all of a most facile quick alteration, and therefore easily transmutable or convertible into any form; and for this reason !Moses charged the people to leave none of it till the morning ; but some of them (saith the text) left of it till the morning, and it bred worms and stank ; whence we may gather, that it is in some degree animal.

Chap. xxxviii. or who hath begotten the drops of dew ?\" it v. 28. is worth our observation that the children of Israel, when they saw this thing (though they knew it not) said one to another : it is Manna ; for what argues this, but that Manna (as the words im- ports) was some secret gift of God, which they knew not, but had formerly heard of by tradition from their fathers ; and perhaps by such a description as Hermes gives it in the Zaradi, namely, that it ascends from the earth to Heaven and descends again from Heaven to the earth; and this might make them call it Manna, because it descended with the dew. I question not but Moses knew it well, though the common people wist not what it was; for the golden calf could not be burned to powder with common fire, but with the fire of the altar, which was not that of the kitchen. This is plain out of the Machabees, where it is written, that this fire was hid in a pit, 2nd that for many years it was there kept safe during the captivity. But who is so mad as to hide common fire in a pit, and to expect he shall find it there many years after ? is it not the best course to quench it, and rather drown it in a well than bury it in a pit. We doubt not for our part, but &his fire was far different from the cornmon, and this the text also tells us, for when it was brought out of the pit it was not fire, but a thick water. The truth"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"is that this mystery belonged to the Jewish agia Church : the priests and prophets having Adamioa received it from the patriarchs, I mean from Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and they from Noah, and all of them from Adam, as we have proved elsewhere.

COMMENTS UPON THE TWENTY-FIFTH PAKAGKAPH. But the gum or jelly of water feeds all things. Manna is a translation of the Hebrew word Man, meaning occultly the mixture of the upper and lower waters; the waters of crea- tion in the chariot of the waters of the floods. The fire that was hid in the pit, the fire of the altar, may, of course, have been any inflammable spirit or oil, such as spirits of wine, petroleum or a preparation of phosphorus, limelight or even an application of electrical force. But there is a deeper meaning to be looked for in the passage quoted from Maccabees. This paragraph ends with an apology for the Jews, whom, it nus st remembered, were at this time, still looked upon with loathing by the Christians. PARAGRAPH XXVI. We shall now (before we make an end) repeat all we have said and that in a few words, such as shall be"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"agreeable to Nature and to the parts of the world as they have been manifested to us by experience. We have certainly found, that there is nothing above but the very same is also here beneath, but in a more gross material complexion ; for God hath ordained, that the gross and corpulent sperm of inferiors, should afford a body to the animating and subtle influx of their superiors. Now God hath decreed no union of sperms but of such as proceed from bodies that are of the same nature and kind, for his own word bears him witness that he hates confusion or a mixture of seeds that are different or of a diverse kind. Not unadvisably then did the priests, or (as Proclus tells us, Levit. xix. the founders of the ancient priesthood 7, 19. affirm, Coelun~ esse in Terra sed mod0 Terrestri, et Terranl esse in Coelo sed modo Coelesti; for otherwise they could not be of a kind. We say therefore, that in this universe, there are four lun~inaries, whereof two are coelestial and two are central. The celestial are the sun and moon, and they are known to all the world ; the central indeed are not known, and therefore not believed, for the one is over- cast with earth, and the other with water. In the centre then of the earth, there is hid a fire, which is of Nature solar, but more gross than that which is in the sun; and in the belly of the water, there is carried a viscous gross air, of a nlenstrous lunar nature, but not so bright and subtle as that which is in the moon.

This seed is carried invisibly in the belly of the wind, and it is manifested in water, I say in water as clear as crystal, and out of water it must be drawn, for there is not under heaven, any other body where it may be found. I have sought it myself in the common metals, in quick- silver, in antimone, and in regulus of antimony also in regulus of Mars, Venus, and Saturn, and of all the bodies ; but I lost my labour, for I sought it where it was not, A11 these errors did I run into after I had known true matter ; for having mis-carried in my first attempts upon it, I left it as a thing untractable ; and this tergiversation of mine, brought me many incon- veniences.

We now come to the connecting link between the parts of this volume. We have here a series of actual quotations from the Emerald Tablet of Chiram Trismegistus, or as he is commonly called, Hermes. Of the four luminaries I may here quote a passage from our author's book called Lztmelz de Lz~mine. \"' It is most certain that no Astrabolism takes place with- out some grievous corruption and alteration in the Patient, for Nature works not but in loose moyst discomposed Elements. When the Elements fall out among themselves, the Celestial Fire reconciles them and generates some new Form, seeing theold one could consist no longer. . . . The body must be reduced to sperm, which receives the Impress oi the Stars, and must immediately be exposed to the fire of Nature.' . . . When she had thus said she took out two Miraculous Medals. I did not conceive there was in Nature such glorious substances, she called them the Saphirics of the Sun and Moon.\" The sun and the moon are the Celestial luminaries, but the central ones are a fire hidden in the earth or nitre, and an airy lunar nature in the water. These two mixed natures are known to us as the desires of the flesh and the phantasies of the imagination : in their transmutation by consecration of the desires and purifica- tion of the thoughts, lies the pathway to wisdom. The will and the imagination of an adept are symbolised by the Urim andThummim of the High Priest ; with this key read the paragraph carefully, and it will give you food for much profitable reflection."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH XXVI I. This indeed clinks finely, and nzay so swell a young head as to make him turn poet, and like the Delphic devil, tell a lie in heroics. No less obstructive to me was that speech of Parmenides, in the Turha. !' Aes aut pluinbum, pro pinguedine vel nigredine, et stannum pro liquefactione sumite.\" What can this signify at first sight but Antimony ? and what can this stannum, that comes from it by liquefaction be, but Regulus. This made ir_e labour for a long time on this feculent and unprofitable body, supposing of a truth, that Regulus of antimony was white lead or tin philosophical. But that we be not deceived, all these parables relate to another mineral, and not to common antimony, which the Turba conden~ns in these words. Camba in Notanduim est quod invidi lapidein anti- Turba. monium nuncupiirunt. Note (saith Cambar) or observe that the envious call the stone antimony. But what the envious call it, that certainly it is not and Basil Valentine in his Currus 'Triumphalis, which he liath written in the praise of antimony, tells us: non tantun1 illi a Deo concessum est ut in, vel ex Antimonio inventatur Mercurius philosophicus, prinzuni Ens, Argentum vivurn, et aqua prima nlctallorum perfectorum, ex qua sit magnus lapis antiquorum philosophorum, sed hoc primurn Ens in Alio Minerali invenitur, in quo metal- lica ratione operatio altior est, quam stibii.

It remains then, reader that, we lay aside ali common metals, as gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, lead, antimony and quicksilver. For if we seek the sperm in any of these, we shall never find it: because we seek it in metallis vulgi, in quibus non est, as Sendivow hath told us. We must therefore seek another body, which is not common, nor is it made by mixture or otherwise, of any metal that is common ; but is a certain black sulphur made by nature, and which never touched the fire. This is that body whereof Albertus Magnus has thus written : Datur in Rerun1 natura corpus metallicun~ quoddam, facilis solu- tionis, facilisque putrefactionis, si praeparationem ejus nosti, felix Medicus eris. And after him, his disciple Thomas Aquinas speaking of the same minera, cites these notable words out of another philosopher; est quaedam species metalli, quam gens nunquam invenit. This is the metal we must seek for and it is hard to find, because we must not dig to come at it, for if we know where it is, we need no more but stoop and take it up gratis. Yet it is neither Glauber's antimony, nor"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"common lead, nor is it a flintstone, not the marle of Peter Faber, who after he had wearied himself, and deceived his readers with discourses of antimony, and sublimate with salts of conlrnon metals, sulphur at last in this Clod, or blarga as he calls it. But to pass by these fooleries and come to a conclusion : I say that this black sulphur is the male, which being found, we are in the next place to seek the female; and here observe, that God Almighty hath in particular bodies made no differences of sexes, but only in the animal kingdom, for in vegetables and minerals there is no such thing. We see that in grains of corn (suppose of wheat) there is no division into males and females, for the truth is they are all males, and God hath allowed them no female but the universal one, namely water, whose viscous general seed joining with the particular seed and spirit that is in the grain, is therewith fer- mented and congealed into the same nature with the grain itself, and so propagates and multiplies corn : even so it is in metals, for every one of them is mascu- line, sulphureous, choleric, nor hath God ordained that any of them should propagate and multiply the other either naturally or artificially though we deny not but that they may be multiplied by help of that seed, wherein God hath placed the blessing of multiplication. In metals then, there is no distinction or differences of sexes, so that out of them it is irnpossiblc to extract masculine and ferrlixiine sperms, for such cannot be extracted but from bodies that are male or female,"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"which metals are not, for if they were, they would pro- pagate without art, God having so ordained it. It is plain then, that metals (being not male and female) breed within themselves no seed, and by consequence cannot give which they have not ; for the truth is, the seed whereof they spring, is that general seed of the elements, namely a certain humidity, which appears (as Sendivow tells us) in forma aquae pinguis, that is in the form of a fat water. This water is their seed, their mother and their female, for of this they were originally made, and if in this they be again resolved then the child will attract the mother to it, and convert her totally to his own nature ; and on the contrary, the spirit of the mother will nlultiply the spirit of the child and exalt it to a perfection more than ordinary. This is the way, and besides it there is none ; for there is no water under Heaven, from what bodies soever it be extracted, that hat11 in it the multiplying virtue, but this one water which God hath blessed. And here, though I seem to speak indifferently of metals, yet do not I : tnind the common, for their spirits have been mortified in the fire. Take therefore our sulphur which never touched the fire, and whose whole life is whole in Him : join this living male to a living female, for in this (as I have elsewhere intimated) lies all the mystery, namely in the union of a particular spirit to Anima the universal, by which means Nature is Magica. strangely exalted and multiplied.

COMMENTS UPON THE TWENTY-SEVENTH PARAGRAPH. This points out that the only mems of multiplying metallic natures is to apply their sulphurous nature to the universal feminine fat water ; the oxide or tincture of a metal if dealt with according to art with a careful adjust~nent of tempera- ture, may then be treated as a ferment. But as I have said from the beginning, the author is too vague for us to derive any clue to practical alchemy from his work, and I will content myself by pointing out that the human passions, Pride, Envy, Anger, Sloth, Avarice, Glut- tony, Lust, have long been associated with the seven gross metals, and that the oxidised metals may be regardcd as symbolic of their saving virtues, Humility, Love, Patience, Fortitude, Compassion, Temperance and Chastity. The Union of a particular to a universal exalts and multi- plies strongly. Here is the final lesson then. Let us recognise that only the ~nerging of our human wills with the Universal Will can result in hastening the day of our perfection. If we labour against the World's Will we shall fail, and our work will vanish from off the face of the earth,"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"It was not my intention to add anything unto what has been already written : but when I reflect on those vexations I have endured myself in the pursuit of this science, I hegin to think I have not said enough. To be a little more plain, know reader, that whosoever seeks the philosopher's mercury in metals, of what kind soever they be, is already out of the way: for that philosophic mercury so niucll tallied of, is a water, and in metal, water there is none; for the sulphur hath not only congealed it there, lmt hatli withal dried it up. This is evident in common c~uicksilver and antimony, which of all metalline bodies, are the most crude, and yet as crude as they are, their water is exsiccated by their fire ; for if we force them into a fume, that fume settles not to a liquid spirit, but into dried flowers.

In this point I need not say more. and if they be not wilful1~- l)lind, llerc is light enough for our metal- mongers, and especially for those confident roasters of antimony, who over the smo1;e of that drug dream of ~nysteries, as if they were transported into ;I certain capnonancy.
