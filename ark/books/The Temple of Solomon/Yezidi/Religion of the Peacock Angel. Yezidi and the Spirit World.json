More precisely, the Yezidis live today in the Sheikhan region of Iraq, north-west of Mosul, and Jebel Sinjar (Ĉīyā Šangālē), west of Mosul; in Siruj, Birjak, Klis, Afrin, Amuda and Qamishli in Syria; in Yerevan and in the districts of Aragatsotn, Artashat and Talin of Armenia; in the city of Tbilisi in Georgia; in Krasnodar kraj and some other regions of Russia; and in western Europe, primarily in Germany. Almost the entire Yezidi population of Turkey – earlier living in compact settlements, in the rural cen-tres of Tur-Abdin, Nisibin, Diarbekir, Mush, Sasun, Bitlis and on the upper shores of the Tigris river – moved to Syria or Germany and other western European countries. The emergent Yezidi community of Russia is the result of economic migration from Armenia and Georgia in the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the most problematic period for newly independent states’ economies in the trans-Caucasus region.The total number of the Yezidis can be estimated only approximately: in Iraq around 200,000; in Syria 80,000–100,000; Armenia 45,000–50,000; Georgia 20,000–25,000; Russia 10,000–15,000; western Europe 45,000–50,000; all in all some 400,000–450,000 people. The Yezidis speak a local variant of northern Kurdish (Kurmanji), which they call ēzdīkī: “the Yezidi language”. In terms of religion the Yezidis are a product of the Near Eastern non-dogmatic milieu. They are deeply rooted in a form of Sufism but with multiple elements of Christianity, Gnosticism, local pagan cults, and so on. Because of their religious idiosyncrasy they have been traditionally viewed as pagans, heretics or devil-worshippers and have therefore remained for centuries an object of persecu-tion in the Muslim environment. Therefore, almost the entire history of this valiant people seems to have been one of unabated perseverance and almost permanent struggle for survival among the neighbouring Kurds and Turks.PREFACE"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"prefaceviiiDeprived of its own sacred scriptures, this closed esoteric community has developed a rich and multi-genre lore, which fixes the religious tradition and represents the only reliable source for its research.1 The so-called holy books of the Yezidis – Kitēbā Jalwa (“The Book of Revelation”) and Mashafē Raš (“The Black Book”) – are rather late forgeries, although still definitely reflecting the genuine religious and folk tradition.2 Containing much less information on the Yezidi sacred knowledge than the religious lore, these small texts, have gradu-ally become part of tradition and are now approached as holy writings by the Yezidis themselves.The main religious centre of the Yezidis is situated in the valley of Lalish, the Sheikhan region (north Iraq), where the sanctuaries of most of the Yezidi saints and holy men are located. It is also the centre of Yezidi traditional learn-ing. The seat of the Yezidis’ spiritual leader, the Prince or mīr, is in the nearby village of Ba‘dre.The religion exclusive to the Yezidis constitutes one of the most enigmatic and least investigated phenomena of the Near Eastern non-dogmatic milieu. But it has beckoned increasing attention from scholars of religion studies, certainly more than ever before over the last three decades. Despite multiple references by travellers, missioners, military officers and intellectuals to the existence of this mysterious people, as well as to a number of their peculiar features, customs and rites, more or less fundamental researches on the Yezidi history and religion only started appearing from the 1970s. The close charac-ter of this esoteric community and difficulties in interpreting its religious lore – the primary source for the study of the tradition – still remain serious obsta-cles for scholars of the field. Yet the ongoing publication and translation of the Yezidi lore, its proper interpretation and commentaries – both by traditional connoisseurs and scholars of Yezidism – have facilitated a gradual understand-ing of the essence of its complicated religious doctrine.Yezidism is a unique phenomenon, one of the most remarkable illustrations of ethno-religious identity, centred on a religion the Yezidis call Sharfadin (see pp. 29–30). The peculiarities of this religious system are not only limited to its syncretism, some elements of which can be traced in Sufism, a number of extreme Shi‘ite sects, substrate pre-Islamic beliefs, Gnosticism and other related traditions surviving from the ancient world, but they also include spe-cific features solely characteristic of the Yezidi faith which define the belong-ing of its followers to the Ezdikhana (Ēzdīxāna) − the esoteric community of the Yezidis itself. In this case, when providing characteristics of Yezidism in its current state, it is quite legitimate to speak of the unity of both the Yezidi religious identity and Yezidi ethnicity.Historical analyses of various ethno-religious communities in the Middle East and Central Asia have shown that their development has a clearly expressed vector − the drive for ethnicity.3 The dynamics of the development of ethno-religious communities − from religious identity to ethno- religiousness and, finally, to claims of special ethnicity in the modern context − look to be"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"ixprefaceemerging as a coping stone, or at the very least a crucial paradigm, for explai-ning the ethnic vector in the development of any ethno-religious community in the long run.On this reading, the ethno-religious group in its process of establishment and development passes through several stages. First of all, it dissociates itself from its own prior religious surroundings, marking a new “dominant” around which a new syncretic doctrine is being formed. This dominant provides the basic religious specificity of the new community. Then a “closing” of the com-munity takes place: a strict endogamy, indeed, becomes a guarantee of pre-serving the esoteric religious knowledge inside the community. (To a certain extent, endogamy is also determined by hostile surroundings, when outsiders impute the group with distorted doctrines and heresy.) It is specifically endo-gamy that distinguishes an ethno-religious community, that is, as distinct from any other esoteric group (mystical order and others) which one could join as a member by passing some ritual of initiation. And it is namely endogamy that defines the ethno-religious and thus, in the final analysis, the ethnic vector of the development of a new community whereby religion still remains the main differentiative indicator.The process of the formation of the Yezidis as a separate ethno-religious group took place in the period from the eleventh to the fourteenth century in the region of Sinjar in northern Iraq. The religious dissociation of the Yezi-dis from the local milieu took place in the very colourful religious scenery of Mesopotamia where different ideas of Islam and Christianity were interlaced with Gnostic ideas and local folk beliefs. In the tightly loyal surrounding of the Sufi ‛Adawīyya order, which became the core of a new community, there arose and developed a fundamentally new syncretic religious doctrine, and one curi-ously lacking a common dogma in the strict understanding of the term. By preserving a number of elements of mystical Islam, the Yezidis inhaled diffe-rent and sometimes contradictory elements of many other religious streams in the region they inhabited. They were nourished by various marginal ideas found in their “fertile heretical” surroundings, distant from centres of ort-hodoxy. Some elements of Yezidism, however, are extremely specific, even unique in the whole new Iranian expanse, so that it becomes impossible to find echoes of them in other doctrines (even if typological parallels are com-monly available). These peculiarities turn out, in fact, to be fundamental for Yezidi religious ideology, and have emerged as main indicators of their self- consciousness, defining the Yezidis and the conceptions of Yezidism as they are in an assortment of shibboleths.This book is entirely dedicated to the essentials of Yezidi identity – the Yezidi religion, or more precisely the so-called Yezidi folk pantheon in its varied dimensions. The idea of one god and his incarnations, Yezidi deities, saints, holy patrons and deified personalities are the prolonged focus of this book. It is not a mere presentation of the characters in this “pantheon”, but a thorough attempt to determine their domains, to define their main functions"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"prefacexand features, to trace their genealogies, and, in short, to locate their niches in the system of the Yezidi faith. Some parts of this book have been pub-lished before in multiple separate articles, but the compelling need for a solid account of the Yezidi “religious personae” in such a general sourcebook as this is now quite obvious. While most of the relevant publications in the field are dedicated to the problems of Yezidi history and iconography (work by Birgül Açikyildiz, for example), to their survival among hostile peoples (Alphonse Mingana earlier, and John Guest and Eszter Spät later on), and to general aspects of their religion in terms of rites and rituals, as well as to the textual tradition of their writings (Lady Ethel Drower, Giuseppe Furlani, Philip Krey-enbroek and others), we in our turn will explore a sphere mainly ignored by other authors, probing Yezidi conceptions of divinity in the light of a com-parative religious analysis. The term “pantheon” is used in this work as a pro-visional term.As an act of original research, this work is mainly based on Yezidi texts and materials collected by the authors during their fieldwork in the Yezidi com-munities of Armenia, Georgia, Russia and Turkey over the last fourteen years. In what follows, the Yezidis’ key texts on their spirit world and cosmic vision have been transliterated and translated into English for the first time. The idea for this book, as well as its thorough editing and numerous suggestions and comments after its compilation, belong to our friend Professor Garry Trompf, to whom the authors extend their heartfelt thanks and gratitude. Without Garry’s scholarly enthusiasm, encouragement and guidance this work could never have appeared.

Muslims, for instance, erroneously see the concept of the Christian Trinity – the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit – as a manifestation of polytheism in Christianity. Meanwhile, in Islam itself, where monotheism is an indisputable basis – even “the alpha and omega” of the entire theology – some heterodox sects (the extreme Shi‘as, for example) deify the fourth caliph, ‘Ali ibn Abi-Talib, and other figures such as Fatima. They thereby come in for criticism by orthodox Islamic theologians for their departure from the monolithic Allah – from the very idea of tauḥīd, monotheism.The poly-variation in the Yezidis’ religious thought, or rather, their dis-membered representation of the divine entity or of god, is none other than the personification of the functional division of the divine, which has noth-ing to do with polytheism in its pure form, the essential nature of which does not change even in the presence of a manifestly principal divinity within the system of gods. This principal divinity in a “polytheistic system”, while endowed with a greater power compared to others (greater attributes, func-tions, and so on), is, however, not the Absolute, which is the main character-istic of the One God. It is therefore necessary to differentiate clearly between the Yezidis’ dismembered representations of the divine (by different spheres of manifestation and even under differing names) reduced to the single ini-tiation, and polytheism characterized by a dispersed representation of the divine.In “classical” monotheism the Divine Essence in its manifestations does not in any way lose even partially the role, functions or power of God, the sole Part ITHE ONE GOD"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"par t i: the one god2source of divine emanation and of the Divine in its entirety, but rather mani-fests its qualities within different hypostases. From this viewpoint, even Zoro-astrianism, often represented as a dualistic religion, can only be regarded as such with great reservations. Indeed, despite quite an impressive pantheon of gods as a whole, Ahura Mazdā is featured generally as the supreme god, with the functions of the demiurge or creator deity.1In the Old Iranian religion, god is designated by the term *bága- (cf. Old Persian baga “god”, Avestan baga- “lot, good fortune”, Sogdian baγ). This denotes one (single) God (rather, supreme god), unlike the Yazats (Avestan yazata, Middle Pers. yazat, New Pers. īzad, literally meaning “one [or any being] worthy of worship or of sacrifice”). As for *bága-, this concept also means “dis-penser (of good fortune)” (cf. Skt. bhága-). Another denotation of the supreme god in Old Iran was *dātār-, that is, “creator” (New Pers. dādār). At the present time the general designation of god in New Persian and in most New Iranian dialects is xudāy, from Old Iranian *xwa-tāwan-, literally “autocrat”, and basi-cally the same term, xwadē, also designates the one god among the Yezidis, the subject of this study.2As for Angra Mainyu or Ahriman in the Zoroastrian religion, he is only a manifestation of evil, a force of destruction, and to some degree a paral-lel of Satan, although possessing more significant attributes than the devil in Christianity because he is the author of part of creation and is hostile to Ahura Mazdā and his creation. The classical Iranian religion, which was never unambiguously monotheistic, even after Zarathustra, nonetheless tended in its various manifestations towards monotheism, with one god, Ahura Mazdā, dominating over a whole array of divinities. The situation did not change radi-cally when the priority of Ahura Mazdā was challenged by Zurvān, even by Mithra. In effect, a thoroughgoing dualism, with equally significant god and demon locked in unending combat with an unpredictable outcome, has never been known in Iran, although the Manichaeans came to draw on Zoroastrian-ism to accentuate a greater dualism than that which was indigenously Iranian.3 Some students of Zoroastrianism characterize its theology as monotheism, while they read the speculative philosophy of this religion to be dualistic.4In the meantime, even classical Greek religion, whose designation as “poly-theism” is unambiguously substantiated, had monotheistic tendencies with ancient roots: “Der monotheistische Gedanke war alt in Griechenland”, as noted by one well-known expert of the “Old Greek religion”.5 This does not mean we should doubt its polytheistic nature in general terms, for clearly if we are to face up to genuine dominances of religious mentality, and not be too taken by particular ideas allowed to co-exist within a common system, pre-Christian or pagan Greek religion attended to many deities and spirits. And in any case, when characterizing any discrete religion, especially a syncretic one such as Yezidism, it is necessary to consider the entire complex of its structure without leaning mainly upon the external manifestation of the transcendental in the system of the religious dogmas."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"3par t i: the one godA careful analysis of the Yezidi triad will show its component deities to be unambiguous manifestations of the one god worshipped by adherents. In establishing this, an absence of canonized dogmatic literature admittedly leaves us no choice but to lean upon the oral religious code of the Yezidis, yet the folkloric religious texts, particularly within the context of a wider analysis, provide material quite sufficient for research needs. The monotheism of the Yezidis is seen, for example, in the following prayer adopted as their Symbol of Faith called Šahdā dīnī:Šahdā dīnē min ēk Allāh, ...Silt’ān Šēxadī pādšē mina, ...Silt’ān Ēzdī pādšē mina, ...Tāwūsī malak šahdā ū īmānēd mina. ...Haqa, xwadē kir, [am] ēzdīna,Sar nāvē Silt’ān Ēzdīna.Al-h’amd lillāh, am ži ōl ū tarīqēd xō di-řāzīnā.The testimony of my faith is one god,Sultan Sheikh ‘Adi is my king,Sultan Yezid is my king,Malak-Tāwūs [The Peacock Angel] is the Symbol [of Faith] and my faith.Indeed, by god’s will [we] are Yezidis,We are called by the name of Sultan Yezid.God be praised, we are content with our religion and our community.6As for the minor deities of the Yezidi pantheon, the spirits, demons, and so on, their existence provides no reason to talk of polytheism, for similar characters (including the exact counterparts of those of the Yezidis) have been retained by many Iranian (and non-Iranian) Islamic nations at the level of so-called popular or folk Islam.The Yezidi triad comprises the following: Malak-Tāwūs, the Peacock-Angel (in the Yezidi imagination being featured as a bird, a peacock or a cock, and sometimes even a dove); Sheikh ‘Adi (Šeyx ‘Ādī = Sheikh ‘Adi bin Musafir, a his-torical personality, the founder of the proto-Yezidi community, as an old man); and Sultan Yezid (Silt’ān Ēzīd, as a youth). All three characters are manifesta-tions of god – xwadē (or xwadī, xudā, the term, deriving from New Pers. xudāy). There are also other variations to designate god: xudāvand, rab(b)ī, as well as Allāh (mostly in the Arabic formulas); occurring in some religious songs is the term ēzdān (from New Pers. yazdān – “god”).The Yezidi ideas on xwadē are quite hazy and blurred, and can be subjected to systemic processing only with great difficulty. The Yezidi xwadē resembles neither Zeus, the humanized father of the gods of Hellas, nor Yahweh, the almighty and “jealous” God of Judaism."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"par t i: the one god4Xwadē is a little reminiscent of the absolute Allah in Islam or the all- forgiving and merciful God of the Christians. The main thing that makes him equivalent to the One God of the dogmatic religions, and what actually is essential, is his transcendence and his function as demiurge, as the crea-tor. However, according to the Yezidi tradition, despite being creator of the universe, xwadē is completely indifferent to its fate; he is not concerned with worldly affairs or human fortune.It is not an accident that in the Yezidi liturgy, as well as in the oral tradi-tion, direct address to xwadē is made only on very rare occasions, and that he does not want any offerings. There is, however, at least one specimen of religious text dedicated to xwadē directly, which can be described rather as a glorification than an address in prayer. It is called “Madh’ē Xwadē”, that is, the “Glorification of Xwadē” or “Praise to Xwadē”.7 Consider the text of this prayer, emended occasionally:Yā, řabīō, tu dāymī,Tu k’arīmī,Tu řāh’īmī,Tu qadīmī,Tu xudāye har xudāyī,Xudāye milk-ē k’arīmī,Tu xudāne a’ršē a’zīmī [rather, a’zmānī],A’nzaldā dānī qadīmī,Har xudāyē har xudāyī.Hin mak’āyī [that is, mak’ānī], hin maǰāyī [maǰālī],.Tu xudāyē in ū isī [insī],Xudāyē a’rš ū k’ursī.Tu xudāyē ‘ālam ū qusī [rather, ‘ālamī qudsī],Har xudāyē har xudāyī.Hin mak’āyī, hin maǰāyī,Kas nizāna tu čawāyī,Har xudāne har xudāyī ...Ta na māla, ta na p’arda,Ta na lawma [rather, lawna], ta na ranga,Ta na āwāza, ta na danga,Kas nizāna tu čāwānī,Har xudāyē har xudāyī.Walīyē farz ū nimēžanī ...Řuh’ā didī, ruh’ā diparēžī.H’ākimē šāh ū gadānī,H’ākimē ǰimh’ī ‘ālamī.Ta dīhār kir Īsā ū Maryam,Ta am kirin tažbatī [perhaps, ži batnī; cf.

Everything is done by the hand of his manifestations – the triad. Xwadē himself for the Yezidis is an utterly transcendent entity: his features are vague, being perceived only through the activity of the triad, particularly of Malak-Tāwūs, its main rep-resentative, often posing as the creator as well. Actually the members of the triad, as the hypostases of xwadē, are not always distinctly explicated; the triad is more an implication. Neither the oral tradition nor the so-called holy scriptures of the Yezidis make a note of the triad as a derivation from xwadē.To all appearances, the emergence of the triad in the Yezidi doctrine seems to have moved xwadē aside, providing him with an implicit character also. In other words, the triad, having developed in Yezidism, was superimposed upon the already available tradition of monotheism initially present in the Yezidi religion, along with prior dogmas from proto-Yezidi formations – from bear-ers of the mystic Islam. Thus, the Yezidi xwadē looks to sit as a typical example of a deus otiosus, an impartial and removed god, whose image in sacred history will naturally lose its distinct outlines against the background of the trivial phenomena of creation, the aggrandizement of supernatural creatures, minor divinities, cultural heroes and ancestors directly related to human life. The initial stage of creation and the role of demiurge thus end up, in a way, falling into oblivion. In other words, as maintained by Franciscus Kuiper (in appeal-ing to Mircea Eliade) the consecutive chain of events forming sacred history is endlessly recollected and praised, while the primordial stage, involving eve-rything that existed prior to that sacred history – above all the majestic and solitary presence of god the creator but also the origins of the universe itself – goes dark or dim, or increasingly faint or obscure. If the great god is still remembered, they know that he created humans and the universe and that is it. The supreme god seems to have played out his role on finishing the course of his creation.10 It is tempting, and perhaps we should leave this open as a pos-sibility, that xwadē is the residue of the “hidden god” of some ancient Gnostic system, and that his manifestations in the triad are comparable to emanations from the far removed divine,11 but we cannot be preemptive in our judgements before assessing the extent of (other) Gnostic elements in Yezidism. The same applies to influences of Shi‘a Islamic emanationism."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"7par t i: the one godNOTES 1.

In other sources, other gods exist also, whose relationship with the main god is not always clearly defined.

Malak Ṭāwūs, i.e. the Peacock Angel) is the most important character of the Yezidi triad. He dominates all major and minor divinities of the pantheon. Malak-Tāwūs is, in fact, the essence or raison d’être of the religion of the Yezidis. In a variant of the Yezidi Symbol (or Statement) of Faith he is featured directly after xwadē:Min ša’datīya īmānā xwaBi nāvē xwadē ū Tāwūsī malak dāya.I attest that my faith is givenIn the names of god and Malak-Tāwūs.1In another version of the same text,2 Malak-Tāwūs and xwadē are both fea-tured as Symbols of Faith, Malak-Tāwūs himself being characterized as Faith itself:Šahda dīnē min ēk Allāh, ...Tāwūsī malak šahdā ū īmānēd mina ...The Testimony of my faith is one god, ...Malak-Tāwūs is the Symbol [of Faith] and my faith ...Malak-Tāwūs is at the same time the main distinguishing feature of Yezidism, lending a unique character to this syncretic religion. Not one religious trend in the region has a comparable cult, including some dogmatically related extreme Shi‘a sects, in which the same image of the peacock angel has but a nominal representation (see below and Chapter 5).3Malak-Tāwūs is at the same time an eponym for the Yezidis: they are called milatē Malak tāwūs – the nation (or tribe) of Malak-Tāwūs.

Kitāb al-aswad), Malak-Tāwūs is identified with Azrail, the messenger of death, one of the four arch-angels nearest to god. ... Malēkī xalq kird nāvēna ‘Azra’īl; awīš Malak tāwūsa kī gawra hamūyāna, “ ...

I, §§2, 14).4Many peoples of the region go so far as to consider Malak-Tāwūs the embodiment of the lord of darkness. This claim has led travellers who have entered the Yezidi environment at different times to describe them as wor-shippers of Satan. The epithet “devil worshippers” has been attached to the Yezidis particularly among the followers of orthodox religions, primarily among Muslims.5 That was the reason, no doubt formal, for the unending per-secutions suffered by the tribe of Malak-Tāwūs. The Yezidis were very often, and with particular brutality, persecuted by the Kurds, even though they share with them the same language, the Kurmanji dialect. An interesting descrip-tion of the Yezidis and Malak-Tāwūs, their symbol, was given in the report by Mêla Mehmûd Bayazîdî, a Kurdish Mullah, written under the instructions of the Russian Consul in Erzerum (present-day Eastern Turkey) at the end of the nineteenth century:And there is a tribe of the Yezidis, which do not belong to the Muslims, being the Yezidis. And all their customs, and mores, and laws are different [from those of the Muslims]. That tribe (ṭāyfa) worship Iblis (the devil), and the one they call Malak-Tāwūs is Satan (šayṭān). Their language, however, is also Kurdish.6Because of the shadowy character of the image of xwadē as well as by virtue of the members of the triad being his manifestations, Malak-Tāwūs appears at times as the demiurge or as his agent of creation. In the oral religious tradi-tion (in the so-called Qawl-ū-bayt‘) there is only one song directly concerned with Malak-Tāwūs, Qawlē Malakē tāwūs. Textual references to him are also very few. That may be explained by a partial taboo upon his name (see below), for to call out his name in vain, particularly among the members of religious castes, is forbidden (cf. “Never mention my name or my features, lest you should commit a sin”; see immediately below “The Book of Revelation”, Pt. IV, No. 8).This curious situation, of course, hardly facilitates the proper coverage of the image and the role of Malak-Tāwūs in the cult. It is fortunate, however, that the so-called “Book of Revelation” (Kitēbā ǰalwa), a brief treatise reflecting the Yezidi religious tradition, is devoted entirely to Malak-Tāwūs, and ana-lysing this writing allows some account, albeit incomplete, of that divinity’s"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"11malak-tāwūs: the leader of the triadrole and place in the Yezidi pantheon. With regard to the significance of this “Book” as an important source, and its unique character, it is expedient to cite the complete text here in translation, based upon the Kurdish–Arabic edi-tion by Maximilian Bittner and our Armenian translation.7 “The Book of Rev-elation” is divided into six parts, including the Introduction, and consists of forty-four statements.THE BOOK OF REVELATIONIntroduction0. The one who had existed before all creatures, Malak-Tāwūs.1. It is he who has sent Abtavus to this world [lit. “slave of Tawus”, that is, “slave of Malak-Tāwūs”], so that [he may] identify his chosen people [that is, the Yezidis], endow [them] with knowledge and relieve [them] from fear and delusion.2.

Each Time sends a certain ruler, and each of those rulers does his work at his time.5. The creatures created are allowed by me to do [what they want].6. Those who counter me are defeated.7. Other deities do not interfere with my cause: whatever I wish, they never go against me.8. The books held in the hands of infidels [that is, the Torah, the Gospel and the Qur’an] are untrue, have not been written by the prophets, [and] they are distorted and deformed. They all reiterate and negate one another.9. The truth and error are defined by experience.10. I rage against those who speak in my name. My discord is shown by the wise arrangers dispatched by me for a few days. Generally, I forbid [all that I hold to be wrong].11. I show the way and instruct those following my disciples [in text: “those whom I taught”].

I show my miracles only to those who want [to see] them.7. Those aliens who commit evil following not my words and not those of my followers in their actions will see harm, for they ignore the fact that both greatness and wealth are in my hands, and I give them to the best of the sons of Adam.8.

A deeper analysis, however, shows that while Malak-Tāwūs “existed before all creatures”, he is not in actual fact the creator. We look here at the phenomenon, hardly unknown in the history of religions, when there is a complete transference of the features and functions of creator from one god to his chief representative.10 Malak-Tāwūs, being as noted a manifestation of xwadē, claims, quite legitimately, the role of the demiurge, even if, in so being sidelined by a later triad, xwadē could not leave the cosmogonic void. Creation, amended by the prophetic mission of the characters of the triad, has explicitly become the merit of Malak-Tāwūs (implicitly remaining, of course, something done by the one god-demiurge). It is the prophetic mission of Malak-Tāwūs that indicates to us what stays the same – the manifestation of the demiurge, rather than the demiurge himself. Quite another matter is Malak-Tāwūs in the person of a preaching prophet. This is unambiguously his domain; he is more interested in the purity of religion and orthopraxy, in the aspirations of the followers and the endurance of faith, than in cosmogonic categories. He tries"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"par t i: the one god14to controvert the sanctity of aliens’ writings, although he allows acceptance of them if they “match my law” (Pt. IV, §3).There are individual shadowy spots. For example, it is not clear what is meant in Part IV, §4 by “three enemies” (perhaps the three world religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam?) or by the wrath on the “three things” (the holy scriptures of the Jews, Christians and Muslims?), and who Abtavus is (Intro., §2). However, in all, despite such ambiguities, “The Book of Revela-tion” is ultimately a clear text, a manifestly apologetic one which aggrandizes Malak-Tāwūs as a symbol of the Yezidi religion. In the previously mentioned Yezidi text, “The Black Scripture”, which was to all appearances compiled prior to “The Book of Revelation”, Malak-Tāwūs poses in more genuine out-lines and with more authentic attributes. “The Black Scripture” is a classical example of a Sufi treatise, with a mixture of various traditions, myths and cosmogonic details, with invented, possibly ad hoc, fabulous characters associ-ated with the Near Eastern and the biblical traditions. In it Malak-Tāwūs is one of the attendant angels of God (beside those known in the Muslim tradition: Jabrail, Israfil, and so on), having taken part in creation, particularly in arrang-ing the affairs of the forefather Adam. The following passages from the text of “The Black Scripture” (Mash’afē řaš,) mention Malak-Tāwūs (in Pt. I):1. In the beginning god created the white pearl from his kind essence and a dove, calling him Anfar, and put that pearl on him that stayed there forty thousand years.2. Sunday, day one of Creation. [God] has created an angel calling him Azrail; that was Malak-Tāwūs, who is the leader of all.3. On Sunday [god] created the angel Dardail, who is Sheikh Hasan [relative and follower of Sheikh ‘Adi bin Musafir].4. On Tuesday he created the angel Israfil, who is Sheikh Shams [identified with the sun].5. On Wednesday he created the angel Mikail, who is Sheikh Abu Bakr [Shekhobakr or Šēxōbakr].6. On Thursday he created the angel Jabrail, who is Sijaddin.7. On Friday he created the angel Shamnail, who is Nasraddin.8. On Saturday he created the angel Turail [in the Arabic version, Nurail].9. And he set Malak-Tāwūs as the head of all ...Further on (§§10–13) there is a description of the act of the creation of the world: creation of the earth, plants, celestial bodies, natural phenomena, and so on; all creation originates from the pearl.11 Then there follows:14. Great god said to the angels: “I have created Adam and Eve, and I shall make them into people. The essence of Adam will cause Shahd bin Safar, who will start a nation on earth that will later"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"15malak-tāwūs: the leader of the triadproduce the nation of Azrail – in other words Malak-Tāwūs – that is, the Yezidi people.1215. Later [he] sent Sheikh ‘Adi [the second character of the triad] from the country of Sham (Syria) to Lalish.16. Later god came down to the Black Mountain [probably Mount Judi in Mesopotamia] and shouted, thus creating a throng of thirty thousand angels who worshipped him for forty years. Then [god] delivered [those angels] to Malak-Tāwūs and ascended to heaven along with them.17. Then god came down to the holy land [and] commanded Jabrail to bring earth from all four corners of the world, [and] He created earth, and wind, and fire and water, and by virtue of His might planted soul [into earth and created Adam], and com-manded Jabrail to carry him over to paradise, [and to allow] tasting [of the fruit] of all plants, except wheat.18. A hundred years later Malak-Tāwūs said to god: “In what way should the progeny [nasl] of Adam grow?” God said: “I passed to you the arrangement [of this matter]”. [And Malak-Tāwūs] came to Adam and asked: “Have you eaten wheat?”13 [Adam] said: “No, for god forbade it to me”. [Malak Tāwūs] said: “Eat, it is good for you”. After eating wheat Adam’s belly was swollen. Malak-Tāwūs expelled him from paradise, left him then and there and ascended to heaven.19. Adam started to worry, since he did not have any back passage in his body. God sent a dove [in oral legends a raven] who made an opening with his beak [in the back part of his body, and] he became calm.20. Jabrail was distant [from Adam] for a hundred years. For one hundred years he was sad.21. God sent Jabrail [who] came and created Eve out of Adam’s left rib.22. Then Malak-Tāwūs descended to earth for the sake of our people ... 14The cited fragments of “The Black Scripture”, at first glance a mixture of bibli-cal, Muslim and local traditions, with sometimes controversial and awkward formulations along with a distinct explication of the role of Tāwūs in the uni-verse and of his place within the divine hierarchy, also contain a clear allusion that the same character has features of the fallen angel expelled from heaven for violating the divine command and misleading Adam. The remaining §§ 23–9 of the “Scripture” contain food prohibitions and behavioural patterns (§24; see below) and various assortments again in the same vein. However, to all appearances, the details of the “fall” are left out of the “Scripture”, or per-haps removed from the text at a later time. In any case, it is easy to perceive a"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"par t i: the one god16parallel with the biblical serpent the tempter (Gen. 3) or with Adam’s angelic deceivers of later Jewish thinking.15 Essentially, Malak-Tāwūs, using god’s trust, fraudulently coaxed the ignorant Adam to trespass the ban, after which he himself expelled him from paradise, and abandoned him in this improper situation.A very archaic motif is attested in verse 16, telling the story of god creating a thirty thousand throng of angels by shouting. That is possibly a manifesta-tion of the ritual or, so to say, a “creative” shout, having an unconditional con-nection with ritual laughter.16As has already been mentioned, the oral religious tradition of the Yezidis devotes only one praising hymn (wrongly named the main Yezidi prayer) to Malak-Tāwūs, where again his name is not mentioned, even though the text is addressed to him. There exist several versions of this hymn. The first three versions were recorded and published by Solomon Egiazarov, an Armenian ethnographer, as far back as 1891,17 and later published unchanged in 1900 by the Hungarian Orientalist Hugo Makas.18 However, the most complete ver-sion was published by Khidir Sileman and Khalil Jindy in 1979,19 and later re- published in 1995 by Philip Kreyenbroek.20 It is to be noted that this hymn is not used in religious practice; it may be a form of prayer having no institu-tional function, like a number of other pieces of religious folklore, although most such qawls of religious content, comprising the Yezidi liturgic corpus, are performed during the administration of the cult.The hymn runs in rhyme and is named Qawlē Tāwūsī Malak, that is, “Song (or Hymn) to Malak-Tāwūs”. This is a praise for the image, a description of Malak-Tāwūs’s many virtues: his strength, kindness, limitless power, fame, and so on, making the Peacock Angel the stronghold of true faith. Consider the following pertinent extracts from the hymn:2.

Both in composi-tion and in language texture (similar formulations, phrasings, formulas of address, and so on), these are nearly the same texts, all the more so in that neither one nor the other name is specified as the object of worship (xwadē or Malak-Tāwūs). That is, however, not too important – the crucial thing is the conventional status of the text, or the way it is perceived by the carriers of the religious tradition. As for them, both god and his incarnations, whether Malak-Tāwūs, Sheikh ‘Adi, and Sultan Ezid as we shall soon consider them, amount to the same deity. Despite their obvious distinctions in the cultic sense, these characters devolve into the same in their entirety.Nevertheless, Malak-Tāwūs, even while he might seem to have a mere latent presence within the Yezidi dogmatics and beliefs, is an unambiguously key figure in the Yezidi religious domain. The religious tradition even describes Malak-Tāwūs as bēširīk-bēhavāl, “having no companion or friend”,24 or in other words “the only one”, which is undoubtedly the attribute of god transferred to his image."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"par t i: the one god20According to Yezidi religious tradition, as is reflected in “The Black Scrip-ture” (§1–8), Malak-Tāwūs is accompanied and assisted by seven of his “ava-tars”: the angels Azrail, Dardail, Israfil, Mikail, Jabrail, Shamnail and Turail, the attendant angels of god. Another angel, Azrail, the first in the list (§2) features as Malak-Tāwūs himself.25 He spearheads the triad, although Sheikh ‘Adi (as we shall see) is often regarded as a character of the same rank, while all three figures are at times identified with one another in many cultic con-texts. Each year, according to tradition, Malak-Tāwūs with his company of seven will determine the course and the fate of the subsequent year during the celebrations of Jamā‘at, the Festival of the Assembly, on September 23–30, when an offering is made of a bull at the shrine of Sheikh ‘Adi in Lalish, the Yezidis’ holiest place.26 It should be noted that the concept of the supreme deity’s seven extensions or “avatars” is an element coming from later Muslim traditions. It is encountered nearly in the same form and with the same func-tional significance in the religious beliefs of the extreme Shi‘a sects.27 The con-cept of seven angels also existed in the ancient Iranian religion, as reflected in Zoroastrianism.28THE GENESIS OF THE PEACOCK IMAGEMalak-Tāwūs is with no exaggeration one of the most exotic figures in the Near Eastern religious expanse. His non-ordinary character is manifested in everything: in the very image of a bird from foreign parts and with a contro-versial nature. What is more interesting is that among the neighbouring com-munities, despite admitting his ambivalent character, he is generally regarded as an incarnation of evil. They often regard him, the Yezidis’ “Peacock Angel”, as Satan himself,29 even though the Yezidis themselves see the Peacock in quite another light.The origin of this enigmatic “angelic figure” has captivated many people. However, until now there have been no unambiguous answers to a great deal of questions, including his emergence in the pantheon of a small ethnic group. As noted before, no similar cult has been seen in any other religion, either in Middle Eastern and Caucasus regions or outside, although the peacock comes up in certain Near Eastern doctrines in some other hypostases (see below).It is because of this mysterious image that the Yezidis have acquired the attributes of devil worshippers, were considered a mystic tribe originating from the devil’s saliva, and so on. The intriguing peacock imagery, this mystic halo around the Yezidis and their “satanic” religion, inspired not only scien-tific investigators but also poets, writers, lovers of all kinds of exotic things, and plain adventurers. In his travel notes, the Russian officer Aleksandr Eliseev wrote about the nocturnal mysteries of the Yezidis, with torch-lit processions, dedicated to the spirit of evil, that he allegedly secretly observed in Afrin (Syria).30 In actual fact, however, the Yezidis have no comparable mysteries. As"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"21malak-tāwūs: the leader of the triadfor the torch-lit processions described by the author, those are rather remi-niscent of a nighttime turmoil in the midst of a festival, which the author took for an intrinsically important element of festive action. No mysteries of this kind have been noted, as far as we know, by any other observer or pundit of the Yezidi realities.Beside the nocturnal mysteries, Eliseev mentions in his notes a legend of Malak-Tāwūs, which we can hardly vouch for as authentic,31 but which we nonetheless consider it expedient to quote here in full, since it is very substan-tially indicative of the constitutive essence of Malak-Tāwūs. For the legend portrays his character as a fallen angel, an aspect alluded to by “The Black Scripture” as we saw above, although the details in that case seem immaterial to what follows:A little star fell from heaven, said an ancient Yezidi legend, and hid in the depth of the then still dark earth. In that little star a bright beam of the nocturnal sun illuminating paradise fell on earth, and the earth became light, clear and warm; a particle of endless light illuminated it, inflamed life in it, gave it strength, reason and breath. That beam, that particle of endless light, was the great and glori-ous Melak-Tauz [sic!]; through love for the dark earth he exchanged the realm of endless light – the blue sky flooded with the sunbeams and thirty three thousand stars; along with endless light Melak-Tauz lost the grace of the great radiant god ruling in heaven but loathing the earth, which was always distant from him. The creator most high became angry at Melak-Tauz and cast him down from the height of the throne whereupon he had ruled the stars, the sun and the moon. The great and the incomparable, it took him [Melak-Tauz] a long time to fly down, with no place to stay and rest; there was not a star, or moon or sun to lend him support. Loyal to the will of the most high, they drove away the fallen spirit, being afraid to anger the one who cast Melak-Tauz down. Only earth did not deny shelter to the exile, accepting him with open arms. Having fallen on the green earth covered with sweet-smelling flowers, the incom-parable Melak-Tauz lay motionless: battered, sick, dejected, he was alone in the world, for all disdained him ... Even people whom he loved so much, to whom he brought the bright hope and blazing fire, were so mean that they did not want to alleviate the heavy suf-ferings of the exile. Passing by and seeing him helpless, they jeered at him, beat him with sticks, spat in his face and cursed the one to whom they owed their life and their senses. All those insults were patiently born by Melak-Tauz in silence; he believed and hoped that a spark of the better light that had been brought by him would not be extinguished even among cruel and corrupt people, and the bright hope did not deceive Melak-Tauz."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"par t i: the one god22 There came about kind people, pure in heart, who had preserved the unextinguished spark of endless light falling on earth as a bright star of heaven; they recognized and welcomed Melak-Tauz, fearing not what other people would say or in what way Allah would view their kind deed. Gathering around the fallen angel, they washed his body with the water of pure springs, sprinkled him with the incense of the colourful mountain flowers covered him with the best garments woven by the hands of their beautiful daughters. Melak-Tauz then revived and woke up for the new life on earth; he raised his hands to heaven, as if to bid farewell to him, and the everlasting one rolled thrice in the roaring storm. The creator of the world, the source of grace and limitless love, condemned not the kind people for what they did for the miser-able Melak-Tauz, and showed his blessing with the sign of the rain-bow. And the poor people of the mountains received that sky-sign as the command of the most high never to abandon the downcast and rejected Melak-Taus in distress or affliction. Those people were the Yezidis; until now they go after Melak-Tauz, hated and cursed by the whole world.32The two main components making up the image of Malak-Tāwūs are to be explicated: first, his depiction as a peacock, and second, his identification with the devil, the angel of darkness.Malak-Tāwūs as peacock and as cosmically ambiguousIt is to be noted that the homeland of the peacock (pavo cristatus) is India, whence the bird found its way to the West not earlier than the sixth century bc.33 Several elements of the cult of this bird have featured in the beliefs and relics of the spiritual and material culture of the peoples of the Near East for a very long time. The peacock was a solar symbol in ancient India and Egypt: it symbolized immortality and rebirth, as marked on many ancient images of that bird with the tree of life or at the source of life.34The major designations of the peacock in the languages of the Near Eastern region, including Iranian, go back to Arabic ṭāwūs (Armenian is clearly an excep-tion). The Middle Iranian name of the peacock, fraš(ē)murv, attested in Middle Persian, points to Old Iranian *fraša-mṛga-, that is, “miraculous” (or accord-ing to Heinrich Junker, “überherrlich, herrlich, glänzend”35) bird, which would be in keeping with the hypothetical Armenian forms *hrašamarg, *hrašahaw, or *hrašatřčun. Incidentally, a common designation of this bird in Armenian, siramarg, is also an Iranian (rather, Parthian) loan-word, going back, probably, to *sēr(a)marg, which has its attested parallel, sēnmurv, in Middle Persian (New Pers. sīmurγ), both from Old Iranian *saina-(or saira-)mrga-, that is, perhaps,"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"23malak-tāwūs: the leader of the triad“colourful bird”. On this subject, it is this very word, sīmiř (Kurd.), that acts as a substitute of the tabooed name of Malak-Tāwūs as used by the Yezidis in requests and appeals: “bīdī xātirē tayrē sīmiř”, that is, “do it for the sake of the bird sīmurg (=Malak-Tāwūs)”. The Arabic ṭāwūs must be, incidentally, a borrow-ing from Greek taώς,36 and it is actually quite possible for (Malak-)Tawus to be a later adaptation of Tammûz, an ancient deity of Mesopotamian origin, with the Arabic ṭāwūs picking up both senses: this god and the “peacock”.In Ancient Iran the peacock symbolized the vault of heaven, the heavenly light.37 The peacock is featured in many Muslim sects.38 In Sufi mystic sym-bolism the peacock is equivalent to passion or lust (šahwat). Deified by the extreme Shi‘a circles, the fourth righteous Caliph, ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib, son-in-law and cousin of the Prophet Muhammad, in one of his messages, “Khuṭba”, included in the Nahj ul-balāγa (“The Way of Eloquence”) attributed to him, dedicated an entire encomium to the peacock, to this, in his words, “most wonderful (bird) – min a‘ǰabihā xalqan – in creation”.39 In this text ‘Ali describes all the beauties of the peacock, also ascribing to him some mythical quali-ties. Thus, for example, he says that the mating of peacocks occurs when the female gets pregnant by sucking in a teardrop shed by the male. The most interesting speculations, however, are dedicated to the peacock’s legs, attested also in a later tradition, both written and oral. Talking about the divine beauty of the peacock, its magnificence and colouration, and also of this bird’s self-admiration and conceit, ‘Ali notes that the peacock is greatly upset because of his ugly legs, and that causes him a lot of suffering. “And when his (pea-cock’s) gaze goes down to his legs, he utters a yell, as if weeping, it seems as if he is calling for help. That yell is the sign of his true anguish, for his legs are (indeed) lean and black”.40Farid ad-din ‘Attar, a mediaeval Persian Sufi poet, writes, as if echoing ‘Ali:Tāwūs rā be rang-o-negārī ke hastHame tahsīn konand, va ūXeǰel az pāye zešt-e xīš.Everybody praises Tawus [peacock] for his beauty,but he is ashamed of his ugly legs.Thus, the ambivalence of this image is even showing in his exterior, combin-ing magnificence and deformity, as well as in the antagonism between this exterior magnificence and the interior vices of pride and vanity.For his links with the powers of evil the peacock is considered an ominous creature. In the Old Iranian beliefs highlighted by Eznik, an Armenian theolo-gian of the fifth century, the peacock is presented as a creation of Ahriman, or the devil: Orpēs ew zmiws ews asen, t‘e Arhmnn asac‘: Oč‘ et‘e č‘karem ařnel bari inč, ayl č‘kamim.

And as"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"par t i: the one god24substantiation of his words, he created the peacock”.41 That is another exam-ple of an interpretation of his dubious nature: the peacock is a creation of the devil, but possibly a good (or the only good?) creation of his for all that. From time immemorial in the East and even in the beliefs of the European nations, the permanently open “eye” on the peacock’s plumage had been associated with the evil eye gazing from the bottomless pit, and hence with the extreme manifestations of bad luck. Moreover, according to the Muslim apocryphal tra-dition, it was the peacock that had facilitated the penetration of Iblis (perhaps, from Greek διάβολος), the devil, to paradise. According to this story, once upon a time, Iblis, presenting himself to the peacock as an angel, praised his beauty and asked him for help to get into paradise and to see Allah; in return he promised to teach the peacock three magic formulas pronounced so as to retain eternal youth, never to fall sick, and to stay in paradise forever. The peacock sent Iblis to the serpent, which helped him to get to paradise and to deceive Adam, escorting him to the prohibited wheat. For this act they were all expelled from paradise.42 Interestingly, the angel of death, Jabrail (Gabriel), is named Tāwūs al-malā’ika, “The Peacock of Angels”, while Mahdi (the escha-tological Director), the twelfth Imam of the Shi‘as, who is located in a secret place and whose advent is expected, is called Tāwūs ahli-l’ǰanna or “Peacock, the Dweller of Paradise”.Farid ad-din ‘Attar quotes another version of the myth on the expulsion of the peacock, whereby Iblis and serpent are featured in a single character of a seven-headed serpent (mār-e haft-sar).43 Curiously, painted on the wall in front of Sheikh ‘Adi’s tomb at the sacred site of Lalish is a huge black serpent.What is actually very interesting here is the appearance of the peacock with the serpent, a chthonic entity, nearly always having ambiguous properties. In different traditions the serpent had an eschatological meaning, symbolizing the omens of destiny, posing as the symbol of the universe, identified with both life and death, with both night and day, embodying the World Mind and coming out as the Forefather of all life on earth.44 On the one hand the serpent is the embodiment of evil, death and destruction, as in the ancient Iranian tradition,45 and on the other it is a mystic animal possessing the wisdom of pri-mordial nature as a typical representative of the otherworldly fauna, having direct links with the supernatural, the mysterious, in a word, with the non-profane. Perhaps mixing positive (Babylonian?) images of the serpent with the biblical story, ancient para-Christian Gnostic groups of the Near East such as the Ophites and Naassenes honoured the serpent as bearer of the knowledge of good and evil to humanity.46 Yet the positive aspects in his image naturally also provide reasons for a wary attitude toward him. Actually, the most vis-ible characteristic of the chthonic nature is the merging of life-creating and destructive functions within a single image.47With the aforementioned two images, the serpent and the peacock, appear-ing together, Yezidism has inevitably been viewed within the orbit of Gnosti-cism, which is actually what has taken place."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"25malak-tāwūs: the leader of the triadThe cult of the peacock in the Yezidi culture contains clear traces of cock worship noted in Old Iran48 that had a wide following to date inside the region and outside.49 In many Baluchi tribes the cock even now is considered a sacred bird, its meat being unusable for food.50 Particularly worshipped is the white cock, which is considered to be a good angel exorcizing the evil spirits.51 According to the Islamic beliefs, the Prophet Muhammad liked white cocks and even kept one at his home.In Ancient Iran the cock was considered the bird of Sraosha.52 In Avesta (Vendidad 18.14–19) it is named parō-dərəs-, that is, “he who foresees (the coming dawn)”.53 In late Judaic folklore, the cock symbolizes the saviour from the power of darkness, who rescues people from the sinful dream, annunci-ating a working day.54 In Muslim tradition, the voice of the cock is pleasing to Allah, while in paradise, a little below his throne, lives a huge cock-angel whose voice is actually reiterated in the mornings by the cocks of the whole world inviting the faithful to prayer.55 In Sufi dogmatics, by comparison, the cock is at the same time a symbol of passion and lust and the peacock conceit, just as the duck is of greed and the raven tenacity.56The elements of cock worship overlaying the image of Malak-Tāwūs can be traced primarily in the iconographic presentation of the deity by the Yez-idis, featuring a cock effigy made of copper or brass, mounted on a pole with a broad-based pedestal like a large candlestick. That is an important object of the cult, called sanjak, to be carried by a special group of the Yezidi priests (Qawwāl) travelling through the Yezidi settlements and gathering religious tribute. A brief and, perhaps, the best-matching description of this object was given in the mid-nineteenth century by Henry Layard:I was aware that on the occasion of these journeys the priests carry with them the celebrated Melek Taous (= Malak-Tāwūs), or brazen peacock, as a warrant for their mission. As this was a favourable opportunity, I asked and obtained a sight of this mysterious figure. A stand of bright copper, or brass, in shape like the candlesticks generally used in Mosul and Baghdad, was surmounted by the rude image of a bird in the same metal, and more like an Indian or Mexican idol than cock or peacock. Its peculiar workmanship indi-cated some antiquity, but I could see no traces of inscription upon it. Before it stood a copper bowl to receive contributions, and a bag to contain the bird and stand, which takes to pieces when carried from place to place. There are four such images, one for each dis-trict visited by the Cawwals (= Qawwāls). The Yezidis declare that, notwithstanding the frequent wars and massacres to which the sect has been exposed, and the plunder and murder of the priests during their journeys, no Melek Taous has ever fallen into the hands of Mussulmans.57"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"par t i: the one god26Importantly, furthermore, in the Yezidi religious views, as reflected in “The Black Scripture” (§24), Malak-Tāwūs is considered to resemble a cock, and therefore the members of the clerical castes are banned from tasting the meat of that bird: “And the Sheikh and his disciples shall by no means eat of the cock’s meat [for] Tawus is one of the mentioned seven deities, who looks like a cock”.58In a word, individual elements of the cock cult, through indirect references rather than explicitly, have found their way into the image of Malak-Tāwūs, although it should be remembered that the peacock, as noted before, has always had an autonomous cultic significance. While admitting en passant that there are some legends with Malak-Tāwūs as a dove,59 it is no wonder that it was none other than the peacock, symbolizing on the one hand grandeur and magnificence, and on the other pride and passion, attracting with the beauty of its luxurious plumage and simultaneously repelling with its ever-open and gazing eye, its ugly legs, its unpleasant voice so incompatible with its appear-ance, its voracity and both divine and infernal attributes, that could embody both god and demon at the same time.As shown by the analysis above, this concept is largely rooted in the Islamic apocryphal tradition, although this conclusion cannot be viewed unambigu-ously. The peacock had been a symbol of immortality in the multiple mani-festations of early Christendom, since it was widely held that the peacock’s meat is not subject to decay. Even more attractive in this aspect is the fact that among the Mandaeans, one of the most significant syncretic sects, the peacock is featured as the messenger of god or of the Original Spirit.60 That adjacency, however, is not necessarily demonstrative of a mutual influence, because the two groups have become absolutely closed in the course of centuries, with esoteric knowledge being disseminated only within each community, and even then imparted according to certain gradations. But a common Gnostic source is possible.Malak-Tāwūs as fallen angelAs for the second aspect of the nature of Malak-Tāwūs, the incorporated image of the fallen angel expelled from paradise for disobedience to the will of god, this mythological concept can most probably be traced to the Sufi views on Satan and the essence of evil in general. The apologia for Satan is one of the characteristic features of early Sufism.According to the qur’anic tradition and the Hadith, the reason why Satan (Azazel) was alienated from the throng of angelic beings was that, in contrast to all other angels, he disobeyed Allah’s command to worship Adam (Man) (Qur. 2:34, 17:61, 18:50). In any case, according to the same sources, Satan, like the genies (jinns), had been created out of fire, while the other angels were from light."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"27malak-tāwūs: the leader of the triadThe same line is traced with the extreme Shi‘as. “Satan was the head of the angels”, wrote Nur-‘Ali-Shah Elahi, a notable religious figure of the Ahl-i Haqq:God created man (Adam) out of rotten earth [gel-e gandīde] and commanded the angels to worship him. Satan disobeyed the com-mand, saying “How can a higher creature [xelqat-e ‘ālī] bow his head to man who has been created out of rotten earth? How can fire [nār] bow to rotten earth?” and for this reason god expelled Satan from paradise: rānde šodī, “you are expelled”, he said.61In this connection, it is interesting to find a curious explanation given for the word dev, “demon, devil” in one of the mediaeval Armenian lexicons. That is, hreštak, kam apstambac, “angel or rebel”.62 Actually, a piece of Armenian popular wisdom thinks that demons and devils are angels headed by Sadael, who have been expelled from Heaven for their conceit. They are character-ized as Astco eresic‘t‘ap‘vac, Astco irisanc‘ inkac, that is, “Fallen from the face of God”. The same view exists in the Yezidi popular tradition, whereby Satan is the head of all angels temporarily overthrown as a punishment, but in time becomes a recipient of mercy.63The biblical story on the celestial origin of Satan and his subsequent expul-sion from the divine presence has received an aetiological explication in the Yezidi mystic doctrines, so that he is eventually exonerated or his deed not regarded as sin in any way. Indeed, god himself desired that Azazel should disobey him and become Iblis (and the fall of Adam was essentially desired by god as well). Thus, Azazel becomes the executor of god’s providence within the context of predestination, since he was only the executor of a decreed role, he should therefore be pardoned. An interesting version about Satan was told to Edward Soane, a British intelligence officer, by the Yezidis in Tiflis, whereby Satan “has, after weeping sufficient tears in seven vessels to quench the seven hells of his seven thousand years’ exile, now been reinstated in Heaven”.64According to some Islamic Mystics (such as ‘Ayn al-Quzat Hamadani) (1098–1131), Allah and Satan are in the relation of coincidentia oppositorum: Satan is presented as a black lock of hair emphasizing the whiteness of the face of the beloved (Allah). The explanation by Satan of his refusal to worship Man is that he bows to no one but Allah in order to underscore the greatness of the crea-tor: “For Adam is nothing before you.”65 Satan is perceived by Mansur al-Hallaj, the outstanding Sufi (858–922), as “a greater monotheist than god himself”,66 because Satan, in contrast to the rest of the angels, realized that except Allah’s purest substance there is nothing worthy of worship, and adopted this Truth as his stand. As a result, Hallaj recognizes only two real muwaḥḥids (monothe-ists): the Prophet Muhammad and Satan, their only difference being that the former is a treasury of divine grace, while the latter shows the wrath of the creator. “My disobedience is only for aggrandizing your substance!” cries Satan in desperation, which enables another outstanding Sufi, Ahmad al-Ghazali"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"par t i: the one god28(d. 1126), to state: “One who will not learn to worship one god (tauḥīd) from Satan is a heretic and infidel”.67In his Manṭeq at-Ţayr Farid ad-din ‘Attar dedicated an entire section to the story of Satan’s downfall: “Creation of Adam and Satan’s refusal to worship him”. ‘Attar, too, considers Satan to be a muwaḥḥid, as well as a self-renouncing lover of the way of truth, carrying Allah’s curse joyfully, as a mantle of honour. Moreover, Allah appointed Iblis guard of his gate, saying: “My beloved, because of the jealousy and love that you entertain for me, you do not allow aliens to approach me”.68It was this Sufi concept, whereby Satan is an adherent absolutely devoted to the creator, moreover, ready for self-sacrifice and doomed to exile, the one who is tragically in love, without whom, however, there can be no recognition of the object of love, that has produced a powerful effect upon the concept of the fallen angel in Yezidism. This perception of Satan is so original and ambig-uous that the word “Satan” (Arab. šayṭān) is taboo among the Yezidis, and even more interestingly this taboo has come to cover a number of similar-sounding words (for example, the words šatt, “estuary”, qaytān, “rope” and so on) that are substituted by synonyms: “Neither is it permitted to us to pronounce the name of Satan (because it is the name of our God), nor any name resembling this, such as Kitan, Sharr, Shatt” (§23, “The Black Book”).The Sufis, as well as the Yezidis, accept evil as one of the necessary princi-ples of creation, “unjustifiably” condemned by the dogmatic religions, without which it is impossible to comprehend the source of energy per se.69 The pre-determination of the downfall and the complete subordination to the divine will, as perceived by the Sufis, is reflected in Yezidism, although in a slightly modified version.In comparison with this comprehension, Armenian Church Father Eznik in his Refutation of Heresies, wrote on the Christian view of the predetermination, emphasizing the importance of free will: Ayl mek‘ asemk‘, t‘e mtaneloy i mard č‘uni išxanut‘iwn (devn) ařanc‘ Astuacoy t‘ulac‘uc‘aneloy; ew aynr pēs pēs patčařk‘ en, orpēs ink‘n miayn gitē (“But we say that the devil cannot enter a man with-out permission from God. And there are many reasons for that, which only he knows”).70 In defence Eznik cites Gospel stories (e.g. Mt. 8:30-33; Mk 5:11-13; Lk. 8:32-33), and in particular explains Judas’ treachery by Satan’s interfer-ence, which had God’s permission, yet was done by their free will.71Evidently, the varieties of the image of Satan (devil, Ahriman) and the ambiguous interpretation of his nature are rooted in the Old Iranian reli-gious tradition. The same dual appearance of Ahura Mazdā and Ahriman in Zoroastrianism and Zurvanism indicates some predetermined presence of the “dark” hypostases of the supreme god in wider Persian tradition. Meanwhile, the early stages of the positive perception of Satan can be perceived at least in the story of the creation of the peacock cited by Eznik.72 One more similar story (about the demon Mahmi) has been attested both by Eznik and by one Manichaean Middle Persian fragment: Na, ew t‘e dewk‘ bnut‘eamb č‘ark‘ ēin, čēr"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"29malak-tāwūs: the leader of the triadhnar Mahmeayn hangamanac‘ lusoyn ařneloy gušak linel, orum c‘ayžm paštawneak‘ aynr k‘eši eric‘s yami zohs matuc‘anen (“And if the demons were evil in nature, it would have been impossible for [the demon] Mahmi to reveal the means of creating the light, to which until now the servants of this sect offer sacrifices thrice a year”).73 In a Manichaean text (M28 IRI, 5) we find stated gwynd ’br ’whrmyzd kwš m’hmydyw hmwxt šhr rwšn kyrdn (“They say about Ōhrmazd that the demon Mahmi has taught him [how] to illuminate the world”).74In any case, the mythological concept of the expelled deity, the fallen angel, having deep roots in the Near Eastern traditions, is particularly brightly mani-fested in Islamic mysticism. Although the latter is a crucial component of the religious outlook in the Yezidism-forming environment, it has been intricately contaminated with the controversial image of the peacock through the afore-mentioned reasons – the infernal features of this bird, its functional resem-blance to the angel rejected by god, and so on.After an intuitive discovery of a congenital symbol, the peacock, the syn-thesis of the fallen angel and an ambivalent creature, or, rather, the need to reflect the double nature of the character, whose glorification had become a crucial concept of the new religious ideology, resulted in the appearance of the character of Malak-Tāwūs as the supreme deity of the triad in the Yezidi religion. The material herein exposed and analysed has now hopefully ena-bled the emergence of that image to be traced and accounted for with suffi-cient clarity, while admitting various problems of explanation still need to be resolved.SharfadinThe Yezidi Sheikhs of Armenia usually answer the question of their ethnic and religious affiliation in this way: Milatē ma – Ēzīd, dīnē ma – Šarfadīn, “Our nation – the Yezidis, our religion – Sharfadin”. What or who is Sharfadin? One version of the Yezidi Symbol of Faith reads as follows:Ātqātā min Silt’ān Ēzīd,Dīnē min ŠarfadīnMy faith is Sultan Ezid,My religion is Sharfadin.Or:Šarfadīna – dīnē mina.Sharfadin is my religion.However, the identification of the religion using the name of Sharfadin is “unmotivated”, either historically or mythologically. Sharfadin is the name"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"par t i: the one god30of an insignificant figure from the prestigious ‘Adawi family, or associates of Sheikh ‘Adi bin Musafir (d. 1162).75 This Shafadin has never been canon-ized, even informally, and he is left outside the seven “avatars” of Malak-Tāwūs, unlike his named uncles, Sheikh Shams (Šams ad-dīn) (see “The Black Scripture”, §4) and Farxadīn (Faxr ad-dīn), and he has no cultic significance whatsoever. This enigma, that is, how the name of such an obscure figure has become the very title of the religion, with the character himself possessing not a single quality or attribute fit for a deity, even saint, requires explanation.We suggest that Sharfadin as the title of the Yezidi religion should be regarded as an allegory substituting the tabooed name of Malak-Tāwūs, the supreme deity of the Yezidis. The Arabic name Sharfadin (Šaraf ad-dīn), that is, Sharfadin, means literally “the honour of religion”, which had been more likely than not one of the main epithets of the principal deity, Malak-Tāwūs himself, who lies at the core of the Yezidi religious ideology. Quite naturally, as time went on, this epithet, having replaced the tabooed name, came to be used to denote the religion. Thus, Sharfadin as the name of a religion, needs in no way be correlated to the name of a specific historical person, although it is not to be excluded that later, by way of a secondary reference, the name became associated, even identified, in the folk tradition with the respective member of the ‘Adawi family.The Peacock Angel in other traditionsAs noted before, Malak-Tāwūs is a unique image in the treatment that it is given in the Yezidi religion, but the Peacock Angel nonetheless features else-where as a marginal image and in other interpretations, and is present in cer-tain Near Eastern cults.Some Ahl-i Haqq groups also regard Malak-Tāwūs as the embodiment of Satan,76 yet of a Satan with an alternate set of attributes, one not completely identified with evil and having the features of the angel rejected by god.77 Also noted in Ahl-i Haqq doctrine are the elements of Satan’s apologia, and there is even a kind of taboo on the word “šayṭān” as well. For the extreme Shi‘as, Satan is merely Azazel, the angel waved aside by god, whose name was changed to Iblis (“devil”) after the downfall. He is feeble and infirm, limited in his move-ments, rather than the concentration of evil as presented in dogmatic doc-trines. The Ahl-i Haqq think that except for Man there is no evil in nature; evil (or the devil) is just the means whereby the dominant Self is manifested in us.78Among the Ahl-i Haqq, we note, Malak-Tāwūs is sometimes identified with Pir Dawud,79 the second most important of the Haft-tan, the Seven Saints in the Ahl-i Haqq religion.80 In one of the Ahl-i Haqq groups (in the region of Qalkhan, the Dalahu mountains), the figure of Malak-Tāwūs has such a partic-ular significance that the rest of the Ahl-i Haqq sectarians call this very group"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"31malak-tāwūs: the leader of the triadMalak-Tāwūsīhā; that is, Malak-Tāwūsis or “the followers of Malak-Tāwūs”. The local tradition has it that the followers of Malak-Tāwūs have existed from times immemorial. When Soltān Sohāq, the fourth divine incarnation (among the seven successive incarnations of divinity that built up the basic ideas of the Ahl-i Haqq faith) came to this world, all the Malak-Tāwūsis became his devo-tees, and thus part of the People of Truth, that is, Ahl-i Haqq. Since that time they have preserved two cults, those of Ahl-i Haqq and Malak-Tāwūs together. Thus, while all the Ahl-i Haqq sectarians, who equally venerate Soltan Sohak as god’s main incarnation, the Malak-Tāwūsis believe that Allah created the universe and appointed Malak-Tāwūs as the supervisor over the world. One of his main functions is to do god’s will, particularly to punish people for their sins. At the same time, no one is allowed to allude to Malak-Tāwūs’s own sin as that of the Fallen Angel, since god had already forgiven him. Malak-Tāwūs is even approached as Malak-e Amin (the Trusted Angel), who had proved his monotheistic view to Allah by his action.In this group Malak-Tāwūs acquires new characteristics also in the light of the veneration of ‘Ali that is typical of most of heterodox Shi‘a doctrines.81 Malak-Tāwūsis believe that ‘Ali had existed before the Creation as Perfect (Absolute) Light (nūr-ē mutlaq). Four servitor Angels were created from ‘Ali’s pure essence (az jesm-e pāk-ē ‘Ali). Jibrail was created from ‘Ali’s right hand, Michail from his left, Israil from his tongue, and Malak-Amin (i.e. Malak-Tāwūs) as the reincarnation of ‘Ali (dūn-ē ‘Ali). As ‘Ali’s reincarnation, Malak-Tāwūs therefore rules over the world.So much more interesting against this background is the Mandaean Tāwūs Melka. In the Mandaean legend narrating the creation of Man, the following story, inter alia, is recounted:The Jews were of the children of Ruha and Adam. Their great men were the children of Ruha ... They travelled and travelled until they came to ‘Urshalam [Jerusalem] ... They wanted books, and Melka d Anhura [King of Light, the supreme being] said, “A book must be written that does not make trouble for the Mandai,” and they sent one of the melki – Tāwūs Melka to write the Torat.82Malkia (Melki) are semi-divinities among the Mandaeans, executing the will of Great Life. They obey the creator, being at the same time his initial incarna-tions. As seen, the Mandaeans interpret malka in the compound name Tāwūs Melka as “king”, rather than “angel”. Although the functions of malkia, as noted by Lady Stefana Drower, are akin to the functions of messengers, angels (Heb. malāk, Arab. malak), the Mandaeans used the word malax (equivalent of the aforementioned Heb. and Arab. forms) also to designate the evil spirit. The entities that are completely beneficial are referred to by the Mandaeans as ‘uthria (sing. ‘uthra). In the colloquial Iraqi dialect an evil spirit or a jinn is also sometimes named by using a related word melek.83"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"par t i: the one god32As for the peacock (Ṭāwūs), it is the name given in the Mandaean tradi-tion to the very malka who was distressed about his having rebelled against the Great Life and allowed his pride to push him into rebellion.

Multiple circles embraced fully respectable folks infatuated by peculiar Eastern exotics, worshipping two powers, the “Augmentation” and the “Construction”, known under the code names “Peacock” and “Serpent”. The members of the order regarded one another as brothers, took part in common rituals, facilitating, in their opinion, an establishment of close association among the cult followers. Similar societies must have been established on the American continent as well (for details, see A. Darol, Tajnye obsčestva (Moscow: Kron-press, 1998), 165–84). The concept of the Peacock Angel cult of this order was, of course, borrowed from the Yezidis. This attempt at an artificial recreation of the esoteric knowledge in an alien environment among the people of an alternate mentality is evidence of noth-ing more than a general interest of the Europeans in diverse systems of clandestine knowledge, so typical for the Europe of the early twentieth century.

The oral"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"33malak-tāwūs: the leader of the triadtext does not mention Malak-Tāwūs, but this meets the standards of religious practice, because of the taboo on his name. The pearl is a polyvalent symbol noted in the Gnostic teachings (e.g. “Hymn of the Pearl” in Syriac Acta Thom., 108–13) and in a number of Near Eastern syncretic doctrines (those of the Ahl-i Haqq, and so on). But that is primarily the symbol of the universe. The fact that the pearl is located in a shell, as stated by Eliade (Patterns on Comparative Religion, 398–405), indicates how it can be transformed into a “cos-mological centre”. The Yezidi cosmogony regards the pearl in the same hypostasis: the essence of the universe, existing with the divinity in pre-eternity, prior to anything else. 12. This verse is interesting because it features the concept of the Yezidis having originated from Adam directly, rather than from his union with Eve, as is the case with all the rest of mankind. That tradition, based perhaps upon the apocryphal Gnostic legend, narrates the dispute between Adam and Eve as to the main role in the reproduction of children. To prove the irrelevance of the woman’s claim to this role, Adam suggests placing his seed and Eve’s seed in two separate jars to see what fruit they will bear. The result was that Eve’s jar contained worms, scorpions and different vermins, while the jar with Adam’s seed contained a moon-faced boy who was named Šahid bin Jarr (Arab. “Witness, son of the Jar”) (see in more detail Spät, “Shahid bin Jarr, Forefather of the Yezidis”). Both the Kurdish and the Arabic versions of “The Black Scripture” give Šahr bin Safar, to be regarded as the distorted Šahid bin Safar (i.e. Re instead of Dāl). The patronymic Safar (lit. Arab. “yellow”), may be an allusion to jarr “jar, jug”, since a clay jar is mostly yellow. Later the marriage of Adam’s son and a houri produced the tribe of Yezidis. Adam, being a true Yezidi, delivers his religion to Shahid, the latter passing it to his successors (see N. Siouffi, “Notice sur la secte des Yézidis”, Journal Asiatique 7(20) (1882): 259–60; R. Lescot, Enquête sur les yézidis de Syrie et du Djebel Sinjar (Beirut: Institut française de Damas, 1938), 59.

In the next section, these angels, in their turn, similarly to the above six, become involved in the act of Creation: they created heaven, the sun, moon, horizon, morning star and atmosphere.

These seven assistant-angels of god, including Azrail/Malak-Tāwūs, at least nominally, reflect the Muslim apocryphic tradition, and in almost the same suc-cession, are also attested in the beliefs of some extreme Shi‘a sects (see Chapter 6 for the relevant literature).

We shall deal with them – Sheikh ‘Adi and Sultan Ezid – in turn.Sheikh ‘Adi (Šeyx ‘Adī) was born around 1075 in the village Beyt Far (present-day Xirbet Qanafar), Lebanon. Also well known as ‘Adī bin Musafir, his full name was Šaraf ad-Dīn Abū l-fadā’il ‘Adī bin Musāfir bin Ismā’īl bīn Mūsā bīn Marwān bin al-Hakam (or al-Hasan) bin Marwān. The family of his father, Musafir bin Ismail, goes back to the Umayyad Caliph Merwan bin al-Hakam; his mother’s name was Yezda.In Baghdad, where he moved as a young man, ‘Adī bin Musafir became a disciple of the prominent Sufi philosopher Ahmad al-Ghazali. Among his fellow-students was ‘Abd al-Qadir al-Gilani (Arab. Jīlī), later the founder of the Qadiriyya Sufi order. At the end of eleventh century, ‘Adī bin Musafir left Bagh-dad, and in 1111 finally settled in Lalish in the Hakkari region, thirty-six miles northeast of Mosul. Lalish became his abode until the very end of his life; he left it only once, in 1116, in order to make a pilgrimage to Mecca.1 Тhus, Lalish was predestined to become the centre of a new syncretic religion, having almost nothing in common with the ideology preached by ‘Adī bin Musafir himself, yet with the great mystic appearing to be the dominant figure in its bizarre dogma.With years, ‘Adī bin Musafir became famous for his piety, asceticism and mystical power. He was said to recite the whole Qur’an twice on one night, to eat fruits only from trees cultivated by himself and to wear clothes made of SHEIKH ‘ADI, A HISTORICAL PERSONALITYCHAPTER 2SHEIKH ‘ADI"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"par t i: the one god38cotton from his own field. “If one would attain the gift of prophecy through striving, Sheikh ‘Adi would certainly have attained it.”2 His fame attracted mul-tiple pilgrims and disciples, which resulted in the foundation of the ‘Adawiyya Sufi order.Sheikh ‘Adi’s religious ideas were marked by adherence to traditional doc-trine, as presented in his Arabic works How to Improve the Soul and The Creed of the [Orthodox] Sunni. In his treatises Admonitions to the Caliph and Admonitions to Sheikh Qaid and Other Disciples, he exhorts his audience to live in chastity and follow the dogmas of Islam. He appealed for an asceticism among his follow-ers, apparently alluding to Jesus “Oh ye disciples, let your bellies hunger and your livers thirst and cast away your raiment, that ye may see Allah on high; for fasting is the key to scorn of worldly things, and through fasting the soul and body are humbled and the heart becomes whole.”3In contrast to Sheikh ‘Adi’s sober theological prose, however, his poetry is full of life, exultancy, and mystical inebriety with the wine of love. Some pieces of self-praise demonstrate the characteristic Sufi approach to conveying the particular status of a Master. The marked suggestions of his own role attitude as that of a Sufi Master found emphasized in his poetry,4 coupled with the gen-eral trend of veneration of Sufi Masters, resulted in his followers approaching him as the qibla, taking him as the centre of their afterlife when as Master he was alive,5 and equating him to god after his death (see below).Significantly, he was among the Sufis exculpating Iblis, a fact that later dra-matically influenced the whole Yezidi doctrine. Re-voicing the mystics, who asserted that evil was also created by Allah, Sheikh ‘Adi argued that “If Evil existed without the will of Allah most high, then Allah would be powerless, and a powerless one cannot be God, since it is impossible for anything to exist in his house that he does not will, just as nothing can exist in it that he does not know.”6 Sheikh ‘Adi died in January 1162, in Lalish. His shrine became the main sanctuary and centre of pilgrimage for all the Yezidis. There are several manuscripts of his Sufi writings – in the State Library of West Berlin, the Brit-ish Library and the Library of Congress.7SHEIKH ‘AdI dEIFIEdThe cult of Sheikh ‘Adi looks absolutely logical in the “tide-way” of the Sufi tradition to venerate Sufi masters, particularly the founders of orders, who are supposed to possess some specific mystic power – baraka – which disciples can obtain not only directly from their master, but also after his death from his tomb.8 Sheikh ‘Adi’s shrine is more than illustrative here – it became the centre of the Yezidis’ spiritual life.Sheikh ‘Adi’s legendary fame as a Sufi saint with supernatural powers was widely blazed, adorned with new details, and steadily transformed the biog-raphy of the Sufi master into that of Sheikh ‘Adi as the incarnation of xwadē."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"39sheik h ‘adiHe made Mam Rašān (see below, Chapter 4) ride a rock, he transferred objects from remote places, he released prisoners from jail, the beat of his stick made a spring of Zam-zam gush out from a rock, and so on.9 His identification with xwadē endues him with the functions of the creator: the creation of the fourteen spheres of Heaven and Earth is attributed to Sheikh ‘Adi, and in the Doomsday all believers will be called together for his council of final accounting (dīvān).In the Yezidi pantheon, Sheikh ‘Adi appears as Šīxādī, Šēxādī, Šīxāndī or Šēx(ē) A’dī (Ādī), sometimes bearing the titles of Sultan (Silt’an), King (P’ādšā), and Angel (Malak). The variety of his titles, functions and characteristics demon-strates the diversity of perceptions about him in the Yezidi tradition – from a saint to an incarnation of an angel and the divine incarnation.Although an unambiguous determination of Sheikh ‘Adi’s concrete place in the Yezidi triad is impossible, there is one point attributed exclusively to this character: he is the head of the Yezidi sacred dīvān (council). He is P’ādšā Sult’ān Šīxādīyā – dīvānbagē Šamsē ēzdīna, or King Sultan Shikhadi, that is to say, the head of the Council of the Sun of the Yezidis.10Otherwise, all the three divine incarnations, the so-called triad, often inter-change each other in the same or similar religious contexts, and generally, in the whole religious oral tradition. Their functions are often superposed and intertwined with each other in the sacred space, so that all three appear either as creator, or as credo, articles of faith, or as eponym, or as Yezidi saint, and so on. Despite certain personal characteristics, they can act in tri-unity, as, for instance, in the following variant of the Yezidi credo:Tāwūsī malak īmānā mina,Ēzdī(d) ātqātā mina,Šīxādī a’rkānē mina.11Malak-Tāwūs is my faith,Ezid is my belief,Shikhadi is the essence of my religion.In another context, Sheikh ‘Adi is approached as “faith” instead of Malak-Tāwūs. Cf., in the “Hymn of Faith” (Qawlē īmānē):Řangē īmānē ži čīya?K’ilāma a’nzalīya,Nāvē Šēxē A’dīya.12What is the colour of the faith [made of]?[It is made of] the eternal word,[and] the name of Sheikh ‘Adi.Such a “unification” of the characters is evinced in the use of such common epithets as Silt’ān Ēzīd and Silt’ān Šīxādī, or Malak Tāwūs and Malak Ādī.13"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"par t i: the one god40As for Sheikh ‘Adi, he also appears as the lord of the fourteen spheres of Heaven and Earth:Šēxakī min haya H’akārīya,Zarg ū kawānē qudratē p’āra wīya,Čārda tavak a’rd ū a’zmān k’afā dastē Siltān Šīxādīya.14I have a Sheikh who is from Hakkari,He has a powerful sling and a bow;The fourteen spheres of Earth and Heaven are on Sultan Shikhadi’s palm.The sling and bow point to Sheikh ‘Adi’s cosmic abilities: the sling symbol-izes the earth, and the bow the sky. The same domination over the fourteen spheres is attributed to Sultan Ezid (see below).Sheikh ‘Adi is also described as the Master of the Path and of the pillars of faith (ark’ān):P’ādšā awa Sult’ān Šīxādī – xudānē yōlē ū ark’ānē.15That King, Shikhadi is the Master of the Path and the pillars of faith.Here yōl or “path” is definitely the term coming from the legacy of Sufism, which is based on the doctrine of the mystic path to god (see also the relevant formula characterizing Sultan Ezid in Chapter 4).It is just Sheikh ‘Adi, however, who judges souls – both right after death, at the Salāt bridge (Kurd. Salāt, Arab. Şirāt), and on the Day of Doom. That is why in some texts, Sheikh ‘Adi is called “the lord of the hereafter”, as in the dec-laration: P’ādšāyē min Silt’ān Šīxādīya dinē āxiratē, “My king Sultan Shikhadi is the lord of the hereafter”.16 At the Salāt bridge, the “brother/sister of the Next World” intercedes for the mercy of Sheikh ‘Adi to the soul of his/her disciple:Šīxādī, tu šahidā bī,Šīxādī, tu p’ādšāyī,P’ādšāyē qadīmīyēyī arhadayī,Aw silāmata, bēlak’aya!Birā hařa jinatē.Shikhadi, be an attestor,Shikhadi, you are the king,The ancient and primeval king,He/she is perfect, irreproachable!Let it go to paradise.17"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"41sheik h ‘adiThat is why they say: Bē farwāra Šīxādī jizratā řuh’ nahāta bara,18 “Without Shikhadi’s will, a soul cannot get retribution.”There is an interesting detail in the Yezidi religious lore, that Sheikh ‘Adi appears as a horseman riding the legendary Dundul (Duldul or Dādul). In the Shi‘a tradition, Dundul is the name of the steed of ‘Ali, the fourth righteous caliph and the son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad. ‘Ali is said to ride Dandul in all his battles against infidels. The grey horse of the Prophet Muhammad himself bore the same name, as Muslim tradition has it, the word deriving from the Arabic dundul – “porcupine”. Denoting such a legendary horse, the name is widespread in the folklores of Central Asian and North Caucasian peo-ples (Tartars, Uzbeks, Pamirians, Adyghes, Kabardinians, etc.). Thus:Šīxādī mi habū A’rabistānē,Xudānē Dādul ū dāna.19I had a sheikh in the land of Arabs [i.e. Sheikh ‘Adi],[Who is] the owner of Dundul and dān [?].Another owner of Dundul is Malak-Tāwūs himself, but of course in his allegoric representation – as Sharfadin (see above) – since his own name is tabooed. So:Šarfadīnō, xarzē gulē,A’māmata [a’lāmat (?)]20 dastē gulē,Šarfadīn sīyārē Dundulē.Šarfadīna – dīnē mina,Šarfadīna – dīnē mina.21Sharfadin [i.e. Malak-Tāwūs], [you are] – the green of a flower,The manifestation of a bouquet of flowers,Sharfadin is the horseman upon Dundul,Sharfadin is my religion,Sharfadin is my religion.Incidentally, Dundul is another Shi‘a element, alongside ‘Ali, Fatima (Pīrā Fāt) (see below, Chapter 4), which has penetrated Yezidism and which so far finds no unambiguous explanation.22 ‘Ali himself figures in the Yezidi lore as a leg-endary hero fighting with infidels for the Yezidi faith. In the Yezidi tradition he bears the same epithet of god’s lion – Šērē xwadē (Arab. Asad ullāh) – as in the Shi‘a tradition, and, like Sheikh ‘Adi and Sharfadin (Malak-Tāwūs), he rides Dundul. There is a Yezidi story about ‘Ali’s journey to the Hereafter – A’lī Šērē xwadē āxiratēdā (“Ali, god’s Lion in the Hereafter”) – where he is involved in ascertaining the retributions for sins, particularly for offending against Yezidi religious law.23 Another text rich in Shi‘a motifs adopted in Yezidi tra-dition is Bayt’ā A’lī Šērē xwadē, the “Hymn to ‘Ali, god’s Lion”.

Shi‘a elements constitute one of the most enigmatic problems of the Yezidi tradition. These features probably entered the “belief reper-tory” of this syncretic sect from the heterodox Shi‘a milieu, for in its dogmatic form “mainstream” Shi‘ism holds views hostile to Yezidism, primarily and often specifically towards the contradictory figure of Sultan Yezid (see below). Besides, the penetration of the mentioned elements into the orbit of Yezidism could hardly go back to the twelfth-century ‘Adawiyya period, since ‘Adi bin Musafir himself was a faithful Sunni. The fact is that most of the syncretic teachings of the region have been shaped out of the same “heretical field” and are often marked with common motifs, although many such peripheral elements shared by these various sects are curiously enough not the result of mutual influences.26In keeping with common Shi‘a speculative concepts concerning emanations from the divine, moreover, the Yezidis consider Sheikh ‘Adi a personification of light and a divine extension: Yā Sult’ān Šixādī, mērā gōtin ma rōnkāyī nāv dik’re ta hava,27 “O Sultan Šixādī, the saints told us that light appears only in men-tioning you”. The fulfilment of peoples’ desires totally depends on Šixādī’s will: Šixādī mirāzē hāsil dika, “Šixādī complies with [our] wishes”, as the Yezidi proverb says. Qawlē īmānē, “The Hymn of Faith”, points to this directly:Harčē kasē xwa dastē xwa dāminā xarqē Šixādī mālā Ādīyā bigra,Sult’ān Šixādīyē mirāzē wānā jam xwa hāsil bika.28"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"43sheik h ‘adiThose, who catch the edge of the gown of Šixādī from the house of ‘Adi,Sultan Šixādī will comply with their wishes.The Yezidis believe that, after the realization of his mission in this world, that is, having founded the Yezidi community, Šixādī ascended to heaven (ži a’rda fiřī a’zmīn) and is now ruling over the world, together with Malak-Tāwūs. Sheikh ‘Adi features in most of the religious texts as “Patriarch” of the Yezidi folk pantheon.NOTES 1. Guest, The Yezidis, 15–16. 2. Al-Gilani, based on Guest, The Yezidis, 17. 3.

At the age of twenty, when “he was riding by moonlight across a plain, the summons came to him. In front of an old tomb an apparition rose out of the ground – two camels with legs eight foot long, heads like water buffaloes, long bristly hair, big round ox-like eyes glowing green and a jet black skin, yet otherwise resembling a man. Meanwhile the tomb grew larger until it touched the clouds, taking the shape of a minaret which then began to shake. In his terror Adi knocked over a jug of water that stood nearby. The apparition now turned into a handsome boy with a peacock’s tail, who said to him: Fear not; the minaret may well fall and destroy the world, but you and those that hearken to you will be unharmed and will rule over the ruins.

We find the image of Sultan Ezid generally features in the triad with Malak Tawus and Sheikh ‘Adi.Like Sheikh ‘Adi, Sultan Ezid is considered the master of the fourteen spheres of the Earth and heavens. Thus:Āqā-yē min Ēzīda,Bayraqā sōr ū spī p’ida;Čārda tavak ard ū a’zmān k’afa dastē Sultan Ēzīda.3My lord is Ezid,In his hand is a red-and-white flag,The fourteen spheres of Earth and Heaven are on his palm.Sultan Ezid is sometimes called “red” (Silt’ān Ēzīdē sōr), though the same epithet is applied to one of the minor figures of the Yezidi folk pantheon, for instance Šēkh Mūsē sōr (the lord of the wind and air, as we shall see in Chapter 4).4Sultan Ezid is the only deity whose name is used in the important praying formula with hōl (yōl), “[mystical] Path”, signifying the religion itself, which again points at the Sufi roots of Yezidism. Thus: Hōla, hōla, hōla, Silt’an Ēzīdē sōra! “The red Sultan Ezid is our mystical way”, or, in fact, “Sultan Ezid is our religion”, which most probably used to be the zekr formula (a text recited during the major Yezidi samā‘ ceremony, with its specific ecstatic practices typical of esoteric groups). Very often, the purity of the faith is confirmed by the formula barxē Silt’ān Ēzīd, “the lamb of Sultan Ezid”. Loud addresses to CHAPTER 3SULTAN EZID"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"par t i: the one god46Sultan Ezid can be heard during the samā‘ rites and on the Sultan’s birthday (Řōžā Ēzīdē) on the first of December, which involves a grand religious celebra-tion preceded by three days of fasting. Sultan Ezid has his own shrine, a leg-endary grave in Lalish. Although his so-called mazār (shrine) does not look as impressive as those of other legendary personalities and Yezidi deities, it is always overcrowded with pilgrims during religious feasts.Despite the fact that his name is more often used in religious hymns than that of Sheikh ‘Adi (with the name of Malak Tawus almost absolutely tabooed), Sultan Ezid’s secondary role in the triad is obvious. Yet who has become the main eponym of the Yezidi community but Sultan Ezid? This plain datum has given birth to a number of hypotheses concerning the genesis of both his personage and name. According to the most common error, the name Ezid is connected with the Persian īzad “deity, god”, going back to the Avestan yazata- “worthy of sacrifice”, and thus to a defined class of worshipped deities (Old Iranian *yaz- “to sacrifice”). Again, the name of the character and the name of the community as a result have also connected with the name of Yazd, a city in southeast Iran, where a relatively large Zoroastrian community thrives.5 And even in the Yezidi tradition itself the person of Sultan Ezid is sometimes identified with Yazid bin Mu‘awiya, the second Umayyad caliph involved in the death in battle of Hussayn, ‘Ali’s second son in ad 680. All the above-men-tioned theories, however, are mere ad hoc assumptions, except for the last, that is, the identification of Sultan Ezid with Yazid bin Mu‘awiya. No matter how strange such an identification may seem from a historical point of view, since it concerns a caliph who ruled only for three years (680–83) and who did not demonstrate any outstanding characteristics or moral merits, this Ezid/Yazid connection can be substantiated as the result of a secondary development.According to the Yezidi tradition, Sultan Ezid once broke away from Islam and adopted the religion of Shahid bin Jarr, the son of Adam,6 and spread it everywhere in Syria till the time of Shaikh ‘Adi, the founder of the first Yezidi community according to Yezidi tradition.7 In Yezidi lore, moreover, a number of legendary and mythological events (such as the conquest of Constanti-nople) are also connected with the name of Ezid.8 As for the historical Yazid bin Mu‘awiya, his reputation even in Muslim traditions carries a dual nature. According to a legend, Yazid was predestined to play one of the most dra-matic roles in Islam: his father, Mu‘awiya bin Sufiyan once accidentally cut the Prophet Mohammad while he was shaving him, which caused Mohammad to bleed. The Prophet of Islam said that Mu‘awiya’s descendants would fight against his followers and would even win. Mu‘awiya swore never to marry; but Allah sent him a disease that could be cured only if he married. He married an eighty-year-old virgin, Mahusa; on the first night after the wedding, she appeared to be a young girl (a very important element of legendary birth), and later gave birth to Yazid! The legend has a vivid allusion to the tragedy at the battle of Karbala in 680, when Hussain and his infant son were killed, an event"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"47sultan ezidwhich took place in the short period of Yazid’s caliphate, and made the caliph one of the marked figures in the history of Islam.9Yet how could a historical personality become the prefigurement of a deity with whom he had nothing in common? The genesis of this complex phenom-enon can be effectively traced back. Most probably, the image of Yazid, having already been venerated as an Umayyad offspring, was incorporated into the newly forming Yezidi tradition together with a religious-political movement of the supporters of the Umayyad dynasty. Even in that period, some groups venerating the Umayyads called themselves Yezidis, meaning that they held exclusive adherence to Yazid bin Mu‘awiya, and kept up that allegiance after those sensitive turbulences of transference from the first (Rashidun/Rightly Guided) Caliphs to the Umayyad Caliphate and the split between Sunni and Shi‘a. We could conditionally define this group as the proto-Yezidis, or one of the proto-Yezidi sects, probably along with honourers of the third Umayyad Caliph Marwan ibn al-Hakam (ruling 684–5). It is because such continuing groups later came to join the so-called ‘Adawiyyas, those inspired by Sheikh ‘Adi’s piety in the early twelfth century, and because Yazid’s followers were already influential, that they took part in the formation of the Yezidi tradition. The ‘Adawiyya Sufis themselves have paid special deference to the Umayy-ads, since Sheikh ‘Adi bin Musafer himself – the Sheikh ‘Adi now incorporated into the Yezidi triad – belonged to the same dynasty, as descendant of Caliph Marwan ibn al-Hakam.10 Apparently, the atmosphere in the newly formed community of the ‘Adawiyyas, later developing into the Yezidi ethnic-religious group, was quite tolerant. The absence of dogmatic views and beliefs at the early stage, and the prevalence of mystical–emotional knowledge produced a rather flexible structure, which finally resulted in a unique syncretism. The whole ‘Adawiyya community, as an obligatory course of any Sufi order’s affairs, stressed the deification of Sheikh ‘Adi as the founder of the order back in the 1110s, while the particular Ummayad supporters within the same order venerated Caliph Yazid.Eventually and finally, other elements joining the community would bring their own cults, which further either disappeared under the onrush of more significant figures or left some nuances in the colourful palette of the move-ment’s syncretic teaching. At an early stage of its formation, the community experienced a “non-dogmatic” period, when it absorbed many ideas, though naturally ignoring absolutely strange elements. Anyway, the deification of Sheikh ‘Adi to the level of Malak Tawus himself did not exclude the same proc-ess involving Sultan Ezid, particularly in light of the fact that the head of the triad was definitely Malak Tawus, and above all the three there was the over-looking xwadē balancing the situation and unifying all around the common idea of monotheism.It is quite clear that the tragic event of Karbala marked this rather ordi-nary personality. That is why even the followers of the Umayyad members, whether honouring Mu‘āwiya bin Sufyān or Marwan bin Hakam,11 finally came"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"par t i: the one god48to be considered the venerators of Yazid and were called by his name. It was at Shughnan (in the Pamirs region) where the Marvanids, who recognized Muhammad Marwan, taken as secretary of the Prophet Mohammad as the fourth rightful caliph, were also called Yezidis. This was undoubtedly because of the marked figure of Yazid bin Mu‘āwiya, because in folk tradition the whole rule of the Umayyads was heavily associated with the battle of Karbalā. It is also worth mentioning that Mu‘āwiya, in the form of Māwī, occurs in the Yezidi religious hymns (for example, in Qawlē Ēzīd) and is a clear reference to Sultan Yazid.12It is obvious, however, that Sultan Ezid qua deity and member of the Yezidi triad, is not the real equivalent of Caliph Yazid, even if he has actually been shaped on the basis of this character. Still, the question remains how his name, that of the least significant member of the triad, became the main eponym of the Yezidi community. First of all, Ēzdī (< *ēzīdī) is not the only name of the whole group. Previously, there existed other definitions of the commu-nity which later became colloquially obsolete but were preserved in Yezidi religious texts. One of them A‘dabi, goes back to Arab. ‘adawī, meaning “the fol-lower of Shaikh ‘Adi” or rather “a member of the ‘Adawiyya order”). Another one is Šarqī, (lit. “eastern”), most probably from ‘Adawīyē Šarqī, “the Eastern ‘Adawiyya;”13 and finally Dāsinī, from the name of one of the Yezidi tribes. To all appearances, there was a time when all these terms, including ēz(ī)dī, were used simultaneously, and the dominating one (also as the group’s self-defi-nition) was most likely a’dabī or ‘adawī. The term ēz(ī)dī is the heritage of the Umayyad supporters in the community, either from those having joined the community with a “cult” of Yazid or as the result of his deification within the ‘Adawiyyas themselves.Later, by the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the definition ēz(ī)dī had displaced other names, which will have been bolstered by the following cir-cumstances. After the Karbala tragedy, in which the Prophet Mohammad’s grandson was killed, the personality of Caliph Yazid assumed an evil look, and that was not a view limited to the Shi‘as. Thus, the term ēzīd, being already an endo-ethnonym, could also be fixed as a pejorative exo-ethnonym applied mainly by the Shi‘as to the people venerating the cursed enemy.Slowly, the name became, to a certain extent, a synonym of a renegade in the Muslim milieu as well as elsewhere. In the Armenian late mediaeval love poetry, and, in particular, with Sayat‘-Nova,14 we come across Šat mart‘ k‘u ēšxemen ku daṙna ezid (“Many will become the Yezidis because of love to you” [i.e. renegades, infidels]), or Ēšxemet daṙil im ezid/ Halvec‘a, mašvec‘a k‘zid (“My love to you made me a Yezidi, I am pining away ...”).15 The same occurs in Turkish poems by the same author: Yigilsun y[e]zidlar, cama tolansun/Namardün gögsinä qama talansun, “Let the yezidi [here ‘infidels’] come all together, let them put the knife to the bosom of the unrighteous one.”16 The last example reflects the later tradition of the metaphoric use of the term “Yezidi”, that is, the perception of the Yezidis as unbelievers or devil-worshippers."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"49sultan ezidIn the modern Yezidi tradition, the connection between Sultan Ezid and Yazid (b.

The same concerns Shaikh ‘Adi, who would never be recognized in the modern Yezidi tradition as the founder of the ‘Adawiyya Sufi order, for otherwise that would in effect be admitting that he once was a righteous surmān (a contemptuous term denoting Muslims).NOTES 1.

The origins and nature of its members are not too easy to determine because of the scarcity or sparse-ness of available material, but the task must be undertaken to give a proper accounting of the religion. Identifying the denotata of the Yezidi nomenclature of divine beings is obstructed by the multiplicity and heterogeneity of revered historical personalities. These include Sheikh ‘Adi’s kinsmen and ambience, locally significant characters with restricted spheres of influence, the Sufi saints (Mansur al-Hallaj, Rabi‘a ‘Adawiyya), biblical and qur’anic characters (Ibrahim, Musa, ‘Isa, ‘Ali, etc.), as well as some sheikhs and pirs regarded as saints by the Yezidis. At the same time, many mythical and semi-mythical fig-ures, often even historical characters, having retained their cults in various Near Eastern religious traditions (especially in the so-called heretical environ-ment of Islam), gained popularity with the Yezidis, who worship them along with their genuine deities. Specific regional deities form a recognizable cat-egory within the additional collectivity of Yezidi divine beings, these being deeply implanted in the popular mind and adapted to the religious tradition – Ibrahim-khalil and Khidir-nabi most notable among them.Apropos any folk pantheon, it is virtually impossible to identify the unam-biguous attributes of sanctity for a given figure. The problem gets worse among religions where deification or canonization occurs informally, and pop-ular tradition has a freer hand. Despite such informality among Yezidis, two basic criteria suffice to allocate the plethora of various personages into a “pan-theon”, the first being that they are all represented in the oral religious tradi-tion (Qawl-ū-bayt’), and second that in most cases, they have been rested in a legendary burial place in Lalish.1 “Canonization” (basically deification) can in INTRODUCTIONPART IITHE YEZIDIS’ PANTHEON AND THE SYNCRETIC FEATURES OF THEIR RELIGION"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion52most cases also be substantiated by a genealogy going back to the relatives and subordinates of Sheikh ‘Adi (as for instance with Sheikh Hasan, Fakhr-ad-din, and Sheikh Shams).In the next chapter we concentrate on the pantheon of “personal” beings.

In consolidating Part I, what follows will be the first scholarly attempt to com-plete a rounded account of the Yezidi range of beliefs in spiritual beings. While proceeding to sort out the complexities, attention will be paid to the character and likely sources of the tradition’s syncretic and eclectic “leftovers”, to “pan-theistic” tendencies (or elements of “nature worship”), and most importantly Gnostic elements, or various signs that “gnosticizing” thought has been a past and persisting force in Yezidism.In the case of an animal cult in Yezidi folk beliefs, we find certain examples having parallels with Old Iranian religious tradition, albeit without us being able to draw any direct genetic lines between them. This phenomenon can be rather explained as a result both of the religious “mosaicizing” typical of the heretical milieu of Mesopotamia and the forwarding of its more ancient ele-ments, often in their marginal shape, to newly crystallizing traditions. As for the Yezidi plant cult, its main elements (onion and mandrake) are quite uni-versal, being characteristics of multiple traditions.In the analysis of approaches to some “natural phenomena” in the tradi-tion we will touch upon the folk interpretation of lunar eclipses, earthquakes, the rainbow, thunder and lightning, which rather reflects ideas common for the whole Near Eastern region than representing any original approach. The Yezidi celestial map is restricted to such phenomena as the Milky Way, Venus and Sirius, as well as the constellations of Libra, Aries and the Pleiades.All these “pantheistic” views, which are, in fact, part of any folk tradition (including those coexisting with dogmatic religions), just intensify the syncre-tic quality of Yezidism.NOTE 1.

The category of deity also excludes most figures within the system of saints – such as historical personalities of the ‘Adawiyya order, viz. Sheikh Abu Bakr (Šēxōbakr), Sajjad ad-din (Siǰdīn, being characterized as qāsidē řuhē mirīyā or psychopomp, who is responsible for escorting the souls of the dead to the underworld), and Nasr ad-din (iden-tified with the angel of death, a divinized person who used to be the executor under Sheikh ‘Adi and who killed everyone who countered him). The excep-tions whereby saints are conceived as deities, though, are Sheikh Shams and Fakhr Addin, identified with and symbolizing the sun and moon respectively.With regard to the deities controlling the natural phenomena, most are believed to heal the diseases caused by the corresponding spheres under their command. It is to be noted that the effects of healing are typically ascribed to the sanctuaries, shrines, and certain sheikh-connected clans, these believed to be important elements for miraculous outcomes.2 The names of deities, spirit guardians and saints are commonly featured with the caste-related titles sheikh (šēx), pir (p’īr), as well as dervish (dawrēš). The latter term means, as a rule, a saint, a righteous, errant hermit, a mystic, perhaps even “the lord, the master”. This word, as shown by its Old Iranian proto-form *driguška- (< *adari-gauša-), originally meant “listener, (spiritual) disciple”, being attested also in the Middle Iranian texts (for example, cf. Sogdian zɣwšk, δrɣwšk/žɣušk, “disci-ple”). Socially and semantically, dervish is comparable with the Indian bhikṣu (literally “mendicant”), being simultaneously the designation of a monas-tic class. In some respect, the synonym of dervish among the Extreme Shi‘a sectarians is the title bābā (cf. Bābā Yādegār, Bābā Tāhir, etc.), which is spread CHAPTER 4THE YEZIDI MINOR DEITIES, SAINTS AND HOLY MEN"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion54all the way to India. More often than not, used as epithets with the names of saints, spirits and deities, are the terms malak (Arab. malak), “angel”, xās (from Arab. xāṣṣ), “chosen, noble”, xudān, “master, protector, patron”, mēr (lit. “man”), “holy man”, a’ziz (Arab. ‘azīz, “dear, respected”), “holy”, walī (Arab. walī, “friend, beloved, close [to god])”, “holy”, qanǰ, “good, handsome” or “holy, saint” (cf. qanjē xwadē, “god’s saint”), and so on.The throng of gods, goddesses, patron deities, and guardian spirits of the Yezidis are, in fact, predominantly performative entities deprived of a con-stant dogmatic basis. They seem to exist mostly in ritual, being invoked in particular cultic events related to their domains of competence. Thus, counted among the gods and/or deities of the Yezidi pantheon, in addition to the triad, there are the following figures: the thunder-god3 (with a number of equiva-lent figures); the lord of the wind and the air; the foremother of the Yezidis and the patroness of women in labour; the mistress of pregnant women and of infants; the deity of the phallus; the dual deities of cattle; the lord of the earth (underworld); the patron of wayfarers; the spirit of the furrow, the spirit of the household; the spirit of bedding; the lord of the graves; the universal deity (Khidir-nabi); the friend of god (Ibrahim-khalil); the ruler of the genies; the builder-spirit; the deities of the sun and the moon; and the deity of the garment. Traditionally, a good few of the Yezidi deities, including the classical angels ‘Azrail and Jabrail, have been buried in Lalish – the existence of a legen-dary burial place of a saint and all the more so of a deity, with a mausoleum, shrine or sanctuary at the principal centre of Yezidi devotional life, being one key indication of their canonization.THE THuNdER-GOd: THE dEITY OF LIGHTNING ANd WINdMāma-(Mam-)řašān, or Mahmad-řašān, lit. “pouring, darting Mahmad (Muhammad)”, is the god of the thunder and the lightning. The second part of this name, -řašān, may be a nomen agentis from the verb řašāndin, “to pour down, to spread”, going back to Old Iranian *fra-šān-.4 The epithet of Māma-řašān is “lion” (Šēr Mahmadē řašān, or Šēr Mahmad řašān). The published specimens of the Yezidi religious folklore only once refer directly to the lord of the light-ning under another name: Šēx A’brūs.5 In one of the prayers (Dirōzga) mention is made of a certain saint named Malak-Birūs, that is, “Angel Birūs”,6 which may be one more denomination of this deity. It is highly improbable that it is a name of another formerly existing character. Perhaps the form A’brūs (Šēx being the title) has originated from the combination *awr-birūsk, “cloud-light-ning”, so that in its entirety it means the “(Sheikh) of the clouds and the light-ning”. As for Birūs, as in combination with Malak, “angel”, it is the appellative birūsk “lightning” (with the loss of the final -k). Thus, Malak-Birūs means “lightning angel”. That, however, is not the last figure in the inventory of the Yezidi celestials controlling the thunder and related phenomena. At the turn"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"55the yezidi minor deities, saints and holy menof the last century the Armenian Yezidis featured another image named Ābā-birūsk, as Amine Avdal reports,7 which is now completely forgotten (or at any rate no one of the queried pundits of Yezidi folklore amid the spiritual castes in Armenia is able to recollect this name). If this deity is the same as A’brūs (which seems very likely to be the case), then the name can be etymologized in another way, with a good degree of authenticity, namely from *āpē-Birūsk, that is, “uncle Lightning”, as a “pleasing” name, a sort of captatio benevolen-tiae, for this destructive and formidable force of nature.8 In all, Mama-řašān, Ābā-birūsk (A’brūs), and Bā-raš, “Spirit of the hurricane” (lit. “Black Wind”, another figure mentioned by Avdal) are the names of the same deity, but with his differing characteristics. However, Mama-řašān, as the most generic indi-cation (“pouring [rain, lightning, hail] Mahmad”), has sponged most of the thunderer’s nature, while Ābā-birūsk and Bā-raš are actually featured as emo-tional characteristics and labels for his individual functional manifestations. All these designations have only one denotatum: thunderer, though the bearers of these names are often presented as individual characters and sometimes even quarrel with one another. What has been noted is by no means a nega-tion of gods or deities of the wind and hurricane as individual figures of the pantheon as a whole. We know the bright images of Vayu and Vāta, the Old Iranian gods of the hurricane (death, and destiny) and the wind, which are full-fledged cultic figures,9 while Bār-aš is no more than a personification of the wind. The same is true of Āba-birūsk (Malak-birūs) and Šēx A’brūs as mere personifications of lightning.Another indication of the god of thunder and lightning is perhaps A’bdī Řašō (or A’bd Řaš), who is regarded as Sheikh ‘Adi’s servant and has obvious connections with the idea and quality of stone.10 The epithet Řaš(ō) (cf. Kurd. řaš) means “black”, the colour often used to define the names of supernatu-ral beings.11 The designation of the Yezidi spirit of the wind, Bā-raš, also has the formant raš, “black”, as an attribute to bā, “wind”, meaning “Black wind”, signifying also “whirlwind, hurricane”. The Yezidis believe the wind to be the breath of Bā-raš, and the whirlwind and the hurricane to result from a dispute among Mama-řašān, Ābā-birūsk and Bā-raš.12 The mentioned formant (-řaš) might be thought traceable to the same Old Iranian proto-form, *fra-šān-, meaning “Blowing (overtaking) wind”, but the Armenian dialectal designa-tion of a hurricane or whirlwind – sev k‘ami (lit. “black wind”) – provides an unambiguous indication that Bā-raš should be understood as “black wind”. It is possible, by the way, that the second component of the Mama-řašān’s name, -řašān, also includes řaš (“black”), with the patronymic suffix -ān simply mean-ing “Mahmad, or Mām, from the clan of the Blacks (i.e. divine beings)”, for the colour black is in Yezidi lore a definite symbol of the transcendental world, masculinity and chthonism.13Mama-řašān is controller of both reaping and harvest. His feast is cele-brated in spring. In a drought, rain was to be summoned, using the formula: Yā Mama-řašān (or Mahmad-řašānō), biřašīna, bārānē bi jārika bārīna,14 meaning"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion56“Oh Mama-řašān, sprinkle (moisture), make rain fall copiously”.15 Tradition-ally each village owned a special ritual cup carrying the name of Mama-řašān inscribed inside in Arabic letters. It used to be named “Mama-řašān’s cup” (K’āsā Mama-řašānē) and was employed in the ceremony of calling the rain. One of the sheikhs held it in both his hands standing on the roof of his house, chanting:Mama-řašō, Mama-řašō!Mama-řašō, tu xāybī.Am gunana, Mama-řašō,Bārānē bida, Mama-řašō!Oh Mama-řašān, oh Mama-řašān!Mama-řašān, reveal16 yourself.We are pitiful, Mama-řašān,Give us rain, Mama-řašān!Mama-řašān is seen as a rider, usually on a lion, holding a snake as a whip:Mama-řašān mērakī siyāra,Qāmčīyē wī ma’ra.17Māma- řašān is a [lion-]rider,His whip is a snake.According to the legend referred to in the hymn of “Sheikh ‘Adi and the holy men”, Sheikh ‘Adi arrived in Lalish from Beyt Far, his native village, and appointed Mama-řašān head of the holy men. Soon the rumour of Sheikh ‘Adi was spread everywhere. When meeting a group of righteous men (sayyids) who wished to see evidence of his sanctity and miracle-working, Sheikh ‘Adi seated his comrade-in-arms Mama-řašān upon a rock, and the latter started prancing around, sitting astride on the stone:Šēxādī kiribū firwāra,Šēr Mahmad-řašān li barakī kir siwāra,Gō: galī mērā wa čī haya li bāla?Yā Mahmad-řašān, siwār ba li barakī,Awān mērā hēwir namā li darakī,Ži wān bipirsa xabarakī ...Čandī sayyidīnaDang dikin bi nihīna,Av bara ruh’ tē nīna.We dibēžit šēxī sayyidā,Gāvā Mahmad-řašān dīta:"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"57the yezidi minor deities, saints and holy menTu šēxī anī mirīdī?Az Mahmadē řašīma,Siwārē barīma,Az bixō mirīdē Šēxādīma.Sheikh ‘Adi gave a command:He made the Lion Mahmad Rashan mount a piece of rock.He said, “Oh holy men, what is in your minds?”“Oh Mahmad Rashan, mount a piece of rock,Those holy men [will] have no place of refuge left anywhere,[Then] ask them to comment!” ...All the sayyidsExclaimed secretly,“There [can be] no life in that piece of rock”.The leader of the sayyids said,When he saw Mahmud Rashan,“Are you the Sheikh or a disciple?”I am Mahmad Rashi,18I am the rider of the rock,I am Sheikh ‘Adi’s disciple”.19Upon seeing this, the sheikhs, who were also depicted in the legend as mir-acle-workers and among other feats could even tame lions, recognized the superiority of Sheikh ‘Adi and welcomed him. Incidentally, in some legends Sheikh ‘Adi himself also rides a rock.The motif of a saint riding a rock, a wall (or a lion, which is Allah’s hound, by a Muslim legend), is attested also in the Sufi and the extreme Shi‘a tradi-tions (the Chishtiyya, the Bektashis, the Zazas, Ahl-i Haqq). According to a Bektashi legend, once a righteous man, Sayyid Mahmud Hayrani from the city of Akshehir (central Anatolia), set out to visit Haji Bektash Veli, the founder of the Bektashi order, riding a lion, a snake in his hand as a whip, and escorted by three hundred Mevlevi dervishes (members of the Mawlana ṭariqat [Sufi order], founded by the followers of Jalal ad-din Balkhi or Rumi). Having received the news of the visitors coming, Haji Bektash said: “Those men are coming on living creatures, while we shall straddle a non-living object”. Not too far, close to Kizilca Havlet, there was a red rock, as high as a wall. Haji Bektash straddled it and commanded it to move. The rock assumed the shape of a bird at once and set out on the road. Since that time the rock is rumoured to have retained the shape of a bird.20 There are also other versions of this story with different religious figures of Asia Minor and Albania posing as opponents of Haji Bek-tash, such as Karaca Ahmed, Haci Bayram and Ahmad Rifa’i.21 Similar stories are being told about Sary Saltik, another religious figure of the Extreme Shi‘a movement in Asia Minor, featured as a saint also in the religious beliefs of the Zazas (of southeastern Turkey);22 and early in the twentieth century a similar"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion58legend was recorded from among the Zazas (Qizilbashis) by an English travel-ler. As the author reports:On reaching the western end of Dujik Baba Dagh, we leave the stream, which continues south-west round the base of the moun-tain to join the Muzur Su near Surb Karapet monastery23 and clam-ber up a rugged ravine to the right, striking Dujuk Baba’s northern edge. Not far from here one passes a high rock split in two, the upper portion of which bears a striking resemblance to a head sur-mounted by a fez. This, the Kezelbash say, was the head of a hated Turk cleft in two, and the rock on which he stood with it, by a blow from the mighty sword of Hazreti Ali.24 At a village hard by, called Kardéré, there is a stone wall much venerated by the Kezelbash for the part it played in the miraculous demonstration of the supe-rior sanctity of one Seïd over another. In the old days, much rivalry existed between the various Seïds as regards their respective degrees of sanctity, and as humility was not one of the virtues that counted, they did not hesitate to parade their miracle-working powers ... The Seïd of the Gureshan tribe one day mounted a lion and went to visit his neighbour, the Seïd of the Bamasurli tribe, with the intention of thus displaying his sanctity. The latter, seeing from afar his brother Seïd approaching on a lion, felt himself chal-lenged; so he mounted the abovementioned wall, took in his hand a snake, which he brandished as a whip, and thus equipped went forth to meet his guest. At this sight, the Seïd Gureshan was com-pelled to avow that his sanctity was as nothing compared to that of Seïd Bamasurly, and dismounting from the lion he kissed the latter Seïd’s hand.25Sultān Ishāq (or Sohāq), one of the founders of the Ahl-i Haqq, regarded to be the fourth manifestation of the divine essence,26 features prominently in simi-lar legends, one being recorded by Vasilij Žukovskij. According to this story, Sultān Ishāq commanded his servant Dawud to build a wall on the land owned by a certain Pīr Mikāīl. When the latter knew about that, he mounted a lion, grabbed a horrible serpent and set out to defend his property. Dawud informed his master about the approaching threat. Without confusion, Sultān com-manded Dawud to mount the partially erected wall and go ahead to meet the threat, warning that he, Sultān, was to be found at a certain place. Following the instructions, Dawud hit the road and joined Pir Mikail along the way; later they got to the river, the present-day Sorevan,27 with Sultān Ishāq waiting for them on the opposite bank. The tumultuous mountain river gave forth a terri-ble roar so that the two parties could not hear each other, this nuisance being noted by Mikail. Sultān then tamed the outrush by throwing a little rug on it. In the ensuing stillness Sultān and Mikail sat down on the mat and entered"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"59the yezidi minor deities, saints and holy meninto negotiations. To make a long story short, Mikail started to feel fits of hunger and told of it to Sultān. At that very moment there was a splash, and a fish came out of the water, then it rose up at a sign or a word by Ishāq, to lie down at his feet on the rug. After a blessing, Sultān offered it to Mikail; the latter refused, thinking that the fish was raw, then, at Ishāq’s request he made sure that the fish was well cooked. The meal was started, and then Sultān gath-ered the bones left and suggested his recent opponent to do the same. When the meal was over, Sultān read the “word” over the remaining bones: the fish came to life and plunged into the river with a wave of Ishāq’s hand. What was happening was quite enough for Mikail to acknowledge the outstanding power and the superhuman nature of Ishāq. No further claims were relevant.28Stories involving the mystics riding lions with a serpent-whip abound also in Sufi literature.29 This elaborate motif, having undoubtedly ancient roots, is a product of the so-called heretical milieu of Asia Minor; it is introduced into the image of Mama-řašān (and Sheikh ‘Adi) as a secondary element, linking Yez-idism with non-orthodox Islam, with extreme Shi‘ism in particular. It may be not an accident that in the entire New Iranian continuum, besides the Yezidis, the god of thunder and lightning has been retained in the “underground” Shi‘a community of the Zazas.30 Dūzgin (Dūzgin-bābā or Dūžīk-bābā), the supreme deity of the Zaza folk pantheon, the Master of the universe, the Ruler of the thunder and lightning, of clouds and hurricane, is even more “authentically indigenous” than Mama-řašān of the Yezidis. The Zazas believe that Dūzgin protects the people from natural disasters, as well as from alien invasions, and that he is ready to come to the aid of anyone or to punish anyone guilty of trespassing the moral and humane standards. He is imagined as a lightsome bearded (sometimes bald) man riding a gallant steed in the mountains. This god has a number of other names: Siltān Dūzgin, Dūzginē kamarī (the Dūzgin of gorges and mountains), Bimbārak,31 Aspārē astōrē kimatī (the Blue Steed Rider), Aspārō yāxiz (the Black Steed Rider), Wāyir (Master), and so on.Dūzgin is not alone; he has a massive army of similar gallant riders ready to commit any deed at his command. His messenger is an eagle (Halīyō Siltān Dūzginī, “Sultan Dūzgin’s Eagle”); it is considered a holy bird, the killing of which is a great sin. The Zazas have many invocations for addressing Dūzgin. To illustrate:Dūzgin, Dūzgin, Dūzgin!Xō vīra maka ...Dāl ū būdāe mi tīya, ādire mi waka.Sātā tangada, bāwō, xō vōra maka!Duzgin, Duzgin, Duzgin!Do not forget [us] ...You are from our branch; open our fire.32Do not forget us in need, oh Father!"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion60And:Bērē varō ǰārima,Hawār sērō kamarē Dūzgin,Jāyē tō rindō, barzō.Aspārē rāmanō yalgar ū larzō;Birā varō ǰārē tanga varā,Dast rā gōvānē čatini var arzō.Hay dilō, hay dilō!Wāyirō, Wāyirō, Wāyirō, Wāyirō!Come, please!Our cry, let it reach the gorges of Dūzgin [mountain].Your place is beautiful and high.The rider is as fast as wind;Brothers, pray to him,Relief from trouble comes from him.Oh heart, oh heart!Oh lord, oh lord, oh lord, oh lord!In a difficult situation it is customary to call for Dūzgin: Yā Haqq, Yā Dūzgin! “Oh god,33 Oh Dūzgin!” And Dūzgin, it is believed, is sure to come to help, pro-vided the thoughts of the caller are clean, and he is a righteous man.34The etymology of the name Dūzgin remains unclear. It may be a variant of Dūžīk(-bābā) attested in the Armenian sources as an alternative name both for the supreme deity of the Zazas and the highest mountain in Dersim.35 By all appearances, this theonym (Dūzgin/Dūžīk) is of non-Iranian origin. It is very likely that we look here at a (regional) substrate name of a god/mountain. Incidentally, both Māma-řašān and Dūzgin, as well as Khidir-nabi (among the Yezidis, see below), and Khizir (by the Zazas) in many ways have assimilated the elements of the cult of Surb Sargis (St Sergius), the popular saint of the Armenian Apostolic Church, in charge inter alia of the natural elements.Coming back to the Yezidis’ Māma-řašān, let us consider his attribute “thun-derer”, which may seem too “toothless” for a deity, albeit not a centrally impor-tant one. At a closer scrutiny of the image, however, this characteristic looks more justifiable. For in this now syncretic character, whereby the thunder-god becomes a “saint prancing on a lion”, the essential thing is the archetype, and it is just the archetype that possesses the necessary and sufficient attributes of a thunderer. At any rate, all that we know about such deities in other tra-ditions (storm-gods, thunder-gods) – above all controlling the thunderstorm, rain, lightning, the obvious links with the stone, the snake, the tree, and the like – is on the whole quite adequate for the features of Māma-řašān. Let us, for instance, look at his title “strewing (rain), darting (lightning)”,36 to say noth-ing of his other manifestations (A’brūs or Ābā-birūsk, Bā-řaš). Meanwhile, an"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"61the yezidi minor deities, saints and holy menimportant attribute of the thunderer in the Indo-European tradition is actually the snake symbolizing the thunder (lightning, storm) unambiguously: a rider brandishing a snake is a classical symbol of a thunder-god or a storm-god. As for the motif of riding a lion or a rock, although related to the Sufi tradition it may have had very early origins, only to be later absorbed into the mys-tical interpretation in Islam (signifying control over the elements of nature obtained by mystics through austerity, righteousness, forbearance, etc.).Thus, Māma-řašān, with his functional variations, reflects the ancient reli-gious concept of the thunder-god. For the Hittites, the older name for such was Tahu. In the Old Iranian pantheon, Māma-řašān and Dūzgin (of the Zazas) would probably have as their counterpart Vayu, the god of hurricanes and death, or the combined image of Vayu and Vāta, the god of the wind, which acquired the additional attributes on the Islamic mystical background. As would be expected, Māma-řašān’s legendary tomb is in Lalish.Šēx MūSē-SōR (ŠēxMūS), THE LORd OF THE WINd ANd AIRŠēx Mūsē-sōr, the Red Sheikh Mūs (Moses) is a Yezidi atmospheric deity con-trolling the winds and the air. He is addressed, therefore, during work on the threshing-floor for winnowing when what is needed is wind in fair weather to screen and clean the grain from hay. Thus:Yā Šēx Mūsē Sōr,Biday bāyakī zōr,Dē bō ta pēžin sawkēd sōr.O Red Šēxmūs,Give a great deal of wind,Then we shall prepare for you baked red loaves.37At harvesting and winnowing time, or during other field works, Šēxmūs receives offerings of flapcakes and pies left, as a rule, near the field or close to the threshing-floor. Šēx Mūsē-sōr is regarded as the companion of ‘Abdi Rašō, and through him is possibly linked with Māma-řašān, which is natural, for they are in charge of closely related elements.The sheikhy families traditionally derived their origin from this deity (Ōǰāxā Sōrē Sōrān, the branch of the sheikhy clan Adani), are known for their ability to cure the diseases of lungs, joints, rheumatism, etc.38 The sanctuary of Mūsē-sōr, his alleged mazār is in the village of Bahzané in the Lalish Valley and, as described by Ethel Drower, looks like a slab with shattered crockery around.39 The ground around the slab is thought to have a healing action against skin diseases. The shrine is frequented by pilgrims, who each carry a vessel to water the ground and who apply the wet clay on patches of affected"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion62skin. Before leaving, the pitcher is smashed to pieces. It is also believed that if someone would walk by the mazār without offering his respect to it (by kissing its wall), he would be punished – his eyes would swell up and hurt.40Šēx Mūsē-sōr is usually glorified by the title Sōrē Sōrān, meaning “the Red of the Reds”. The attribute sōr (“red”) may be here intended to underscore sanctity, the colour red being directly opposite to blue, the latter being con-sidered by the Yezidis as the colour of apostasy. Sultan Ezid quite properly holds this attribute as well, as Silt’ān Ēzīdē sōr, “Sultan Ezid the Red”. Accord-ing to different legends,41 the control over the “white” wind belongs also to Šēxisin (Sheikh Hasan), who is simultaneously considered to be the lord of the Tablet and the Pen and that is why only his posterity amid the Yezidis have the right to possess literacy.42 However, Šēx Mūsē-sōr is the most suitable figure for the role of the lord of the Tablet and the Pen, which is just the case with his counterpart among the Ahl-i Haqq, the Archangel Pīr Mūsī, with the whole motif reminiscent of the Biblical story of Moses having received the Tablets of the Law from God. The displacement of functions from Šēxmūs to Sheikh Hasan has apparently occurred through the contamination of images, caus-ing also the entanglement of power controlling the wind and the air. Sheikh Hasan, having a historical archetype, is a marginal figure among the Yezidi saints, actually possessing no attributes of a deity. He exhibits a somewhat dummy character, taking on the functions of other gods from time to time. For instance, he is often associated with the moon, although that is unambigu-ously the domain of Farxadin,43 and so on.The image of Moses in the Yezidi tradition must have had a double pen-etration, perhaps a parallel one: one as Šēxmūs, as a god, and one as a folk-loric character, Mūsā P’ēxambar, that is, the Prophet Moses. There is even a hymn dedicated to the latter called “Qawlē Mūsā P’ēxambar”.44 In the religious concepts of the Iranian cattle breeding communities, the Prophet Moses is a popular figure who has replaced many local characters of primitive worship.45 For comparison, note that the Ahl-i Haqq regard Pīr Mūsī as an incarnation of Angel Israfil (Raphail), and so on.46THE SuN ANd THE MOON, SHEIKHS SHAMS ANd FAxR Ad-dINSheikh Shams (Šēx Šams, Šēx Šims, Šēšims, Šēšim) and Faxr ad-Din (Farxadīn, Faxradīn) are deified historical personalities, brothers, the sons of ‘Adi II, who was the third to lead the ‘Adawiyya community.47 Except for the fact that the former, Sheikh Shams, became the head of the community after his father’s death, we can hardly find any significant event in their real biographies. The tradition has preserved neither scriptures nor even any oral testaments attributed to them.Still, with both informally canonized, they passed the limits of mere Yezidi saints and penetrated into the folk pantheon, having become associated with"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"63the yezidi minor deities, saints and holy menthe lords of the sun and the moon. Generally, the deification process, if it does not have a traceable genesis as it does in the case of Sheikh ‘Adi, for exam-ple,48 belongs among the most enigmatic though widely represented phenom-ena known in many syncretic religious systems, and in Yezidism in particular. Sometimes it has nothing to do with the real contribution of the deified per-sonage to the history of a given religious movement, nor with their deeds, nor even with thaumaturgy. The “required” mythological details hide a hero’s realistic characteristics and together with them the probable derivation of the process itself. This occurs all the more so when doctrines are deprived of any centralized religious institution, orthodoxy being entirely left to the spirit-ual masters’ interpretations, and the orthopraxy’s fate left to a tradition built up and preserved by spiritual castes. In such cases it is sometimes useless to search for the roots of phenomena, which are lost, as a rule, in divarications at the early stages of a teaching’s formation.The case of Sheikh Shams, however, does not seem to be so problematic: the secondary reference of his name to the sun, Šams ad-dīn, or Šēx Šams, the per-sonification of the sun (Šams, Arab. “the sun”) determined his identification with the god of the Diurnal Star. Sheikh Shams is the third manifestation of Malak-Tāwūs, corresponding to the Angel Israfil (Raphael).49 Although mainly the sun’s personification, Sheikh Shams is sometimes endowed with the char-acteristics of the godhead: one of his epithets is bīnāyā ĉavā, “the eyes’ light”, a metaphor used of god among the Yezidis. And sometimes he is identified with Isa (even while ‘Īsā or Jesus, is only nominally represented in the Yezidi liturgy).50Sheikh Shams is considered the wazīr of Sheikh ‘Adi, that is, his deputy, and the head of the Yezidi spiritual council (dīvān). Kreyenbroek’s suggestion51 that Sheikh Shams should be also regarded as the lord of the moon (although tradi-tionally this is his brother Farxadin’s domain) seems to be unwarranted, as it is based on an erroneous interpretation of the hymn to which the author refers. The line Šēšimsē min xudānē māngā, translated as “My Sheikh Shams is the lord of the moon”,52 should in fact be interpreted as “My Sheikh Shams is the lord of the disc (disc of the sun)”. The word māng in similar contexts, mainly occur-ing in religious hymns, has two meanings – “moon” and “disc, circle” (either that of the sun or of the moon; “moon” itself being hīv or hayv in Kurmanji). Consider, for instance, the following passage from the hymn to Sheikh Shams (Baytā Šēx Šims):Wē kim, řo hiltēya,Māngā zara p’ēya,Šēx Šims divānbagē xwadēya.53I testify, the sun has risen,The golden disc [of course, that of the sun, not of the moon] hasascended,Sheikh Shams – the head of god’s council."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion64And:Řō hātiya a’ršāna,Hilātiya māngā girāna,Nūr, nadaraŠēx Šims dāya ma’sīyā binī ba’rāna.54The Sun has ascended to the sky,The heavy disc has risen,The light [and] the look of Sheikh Shams penetrated [even]to the fish under the sea.Sheikh Shams is taken as the essence of the Yezidi religion, as in Šēx Šims masabē mina, “Sheikh Shams is the essence [literally ‘confession, doctrine’] of my religion”.

Thus:Wē kim, řō hilāta,Mizgīna walāta,Daste Šēx Šims dāya p’ira dōža-salāta.Wē kim, hiltē řōža,Šēxē nurī biškōža,Dastē Šēx Šims dāya p’ira Salāt ū dōža.55I testify, the sun has risen,The good news to the world,The bridge of hell – Sirat – is given into the hands of SheikhShams.I testify, the sun is ascending,Sheikh Shams is in the button,56The Sirat bridge and hell are given into the hands of SheikhShams.According to the tradition, Sheikh Shams has twelve children (in accordance with the twelve months). Nine of them are sons: Xidir (Xidir-nabi), Šēx ‘Alī Šams, Āmādīn (‘Imād ad-dīn), Bābādīn, H’asan, Āvdal (A’vdāl), Bāvik (Bābik), Tōqin and Hāvind.57 Another version of this list58 runs as follows: Āmādīn,"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"65the yezidi minor deities, saints and holy menXidir, Bābik, ‘Alī, Āvdal, Bābādīn, Hāwind, H’asan59 and Tōqil (or Tōqal).60 With the exception of Sheikh ‘Ali Shams and Xidir, all of them are represented in the tradition nominally, exclusively as Sheikh Shams’s sons (although there are separate allusions to some of them).61 As for the daughters of Sheikh Shams, we know nothing about them but their names: Sti Sti (Stī Stī), Sti Gulan (Stī Gulān) and Sti Nisrat (Stī Nisrat) (stī is a honourable title, going back to the Arabic saidatī, “my lady”).

The hymns dedicated to him are read at the funerals of espe-cially honoured members of the Yezidi community.The sun’s polyvalence allows Sheikh Shams to interfere in the other dei-ties’ domains, and sometimes even to acquire the Demiurge’s features. See, for example, the following:Yā Šēšims, tuyī řah’manī,Xāliqē minē ǰānī,Li h’amū dardā tuyī darmānī,Li h’amū muxliqā tuyī řah’manī."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion66Yā Šēšims, tu mafarī,Xāliqē minē har ū harī;Rizgā diday ū rizgā dibarī ...Ži darajē h’atā daraǰē,Šēšims xudāne faraǰē,Dast ū dāmanēd Šēšims dē t’iwaf kaynŠūnā Ka’bat-illāhē ū h’aǰē.O Sheikh Shams, you are compassionate,You are my dear creator,For all ills you are the remedy,To all creatures you are merciful.O Sheikh Shams, you are a refuge,You are my creator for ever and ever;[You] give sustenance and you take it away.From stage to stageSheikh Shams is the lord of dawn.We shall kiss the hand of Sheikh Shams and the hem of hisclothes,The place of god’s Ka‘aba and [the object] of pilgrimage.64To be more precise, the last two lines should be translated as follows:We shall make the tawāf [sacred procession] around the handOf Sheikh Shams and the hem [of his toga],Instead of the tawāf around the Ka‘aba and the pilgrimage toMecca.See also further:Ži sarī h’atā p’ēyā,Yā Šēšims, ta am naqšāndin dānāyina sarēd řēya,Am, Šēšims, nābiřīn ži hīvīya.From head to feet,O Sheikh Shams, you designed us and set us upon our paths,We shall not give up our hopes of Sheikh Shams.65The Yezidi folk beliefs maintain that Sheikh Shams is also venerated by Jews and Christians, a phenomenon difficult to explain. The Yezidi deities are extremely esoteric, and their attribution to other religious traditions (even"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"67the yezidi minor deities, saints and holy menthose who have vivid analogues) is strictly prohibited by the tradition. Sheikh Shams has become an exception, probably due to the omnitude and universal-ity of the sun. Contemplate, for example, the following:ǰihū ku di ǰihūna,Salafxōrin di Bōtānē būna,Aw žik (ži ku) li pē Šēšim dičūna.Falah ku falāna,Yē bi k’ašiš ū ābūnana,Aw žik li pē Šēšim dihařina.The Jews, who are Jews,Were usurers in Bohtan,They too have gone in search of Sheikh Shams.The Christians, who are Christians,Who have priests and monks,They too are going in search of Sheikh Shams.66It is intriguing that Islam is not mentioned among the alien confessions, which, at first sight, looks strange, taking into consideration the present-day emphasis on the Yezidis’ past separation from the latter. The most probable explanation here could be only that the text of the qawl’s in which one expects this was created at an early stage of the formation of the Yezidi community, when the memory of its ‘Adawiyya genesis was still alive and the complete rupture with Islam had not yet taken place: that is, when the community still identified itself as a derivative of mystical Islam.In some contexts Sheikh Shams has the title Tatar, or Šēx Šimsē T’atar, as in the following:Či ark’ānaka nadar!Nāv mērādā bū badalXarqa hāt xalātē Šamsē T’atar.What a visible cornerstone,Took his turn among the good men:The khirqe [“robe”] came to Shems the Tatar.67Kreyenbroek argues for an interpretation of this that Shams-e Tabrizi, the dervish who inspired Jajal al-Din Rumi, being an inhabitant of Tabriz, and thus a Turkic speaker, can be referred to as “Tartar”.68 Admittedly this kind of over-lap, or juxtaposition of two characters, Sheikh Shams and Shams-e Tabrizi, does in fact occur in the tradition. Yet the weakness of this explanation seems"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion68obvious. For a start, for the Yezidis, the Turkic-speaking world has never been “the back of beyond”, or some remote reality, for the greater part of their history eventually took place within the Ottoman Empire. Thus, the Turkic milieu has for long existed in the Yezidi oecumene, and had an unambiguous definition: t’irk, “Turk”, walatē t’irkē (or Rōmē), “Turkey, the country of Turks”. Would it not be strange, then, for the epithet Tabrizi in Shamsi-e Tabrizi to refer to a Turkish city? The Yezidis (as well as other Near Eastern peoples) could hardly have considered Tabriz to be a Turkic town, as it had always had for them a definite Iranian attribution. Thus, the problem should be intro-duced as follows: by the time of the creation of this piece of folklore (and this was most probably the early stage of Yezidism, as noted above), had Tabriz been Turkicized at all? And if so, was it Turkicised enough to gain the charac-ter of a Turkic town par excellence? The travellers from the tenth to the four-teenth century (Naser Khosrow, Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta) chronicled mainly the Iranian ethnic element in the northern Iranian provinces; the wide- ranging transition from the Iranian dialects of the area to the Turkic dialects took place only after the fifteenth century.69Besides, Shams-e Tabrizi, a renowned Persian poet, could hardly be associ-ated with the Turks, far much less with Tartars: Turks were never called “Tar-tars” in the Near East. The term “Tartar” has been applied to “Turks” in the European tradition, and in particular by Russians, with “the Caucasian Tar-tars”, for example, being applied to the Turkic-speaking population of the his-torical Arran and Shirvan provinces (the present-day Republic of Azerbaijan). Sheikh Sham’s title t’atar is, apparently, a corrupted form of the Persian takfūr (which is attested in the same form in Kurdish dialects) meaning “king”, prob-ably “lord, god”. The exceptional phonetic development is explained by the secondary reference of the word t’atar, “Tartar”. The Persian takfūr, in its turn, is borrowed from the Armenian dialectal t‘äk‘fur (Classical Armenian t‘agawor), “king”, which has penetrated into many languages of the region – apart from Persian and Kurdish, also into Arabic, some Turkic dialects, and so on.An interesting detail – the motif of the sacrifice of a bull – has prompted some authors to draw certain parallels between Sheikh Shams and the Old Ira-nian Mithra, in later tradition mainly identified with the sun.70 In the Yezidi tradition the bull-sacrifice takes place on the fifth day of Jažnē jamā‘īyya (Arab. ‘ayd al ǰamā`īyya) – the feast of popular gathering annually celebrated during the week following 23 September at Sheikh Shams’s shrine in Lalish and a feast connected to Sheikh Shams as the sun. True, tauroctony is one of Mithra’s main characteristics: he is over and again depicted as bull-slayer.71 But we can hardly trace the Yezidi rite of the bull-sacrifice back to the Mithraic mysteries, or to the Old Iranian religious Weltanschauung in general. The analogy in such a multi-cultural ethnic-religious area as Northern Mesopotamia could be attrib-uted to any indirect influence: the idea of the bull-sacrifice could have various roots, including, of course, the Old Iranian ones. A bull as a cultic animal could have become the object of various rites in many traditions; this requires a very"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"69the yezidi minor deities, saints and holy menfastidious approach while interpreting the given cases. Moreover, the myth about the sacrifice of a bull, carried over from one tradition to another, can acquire a new content with new principal importance.It is not the mere “iconography” of the bull-slaying idea that must come first here, but the idea of sacrifice itself. Because if the “icon”, the scene, the visual rite itself, can pass unchanged from one tradition to another, it will be typically filled with another content as many social changes go by, which is closer and clearer to the mentality of any new culture. The “original” idea will thus be transformed when it transcends the scope of the authentic or primary culture. A shining example of such a transformation can be pro-vided precisely by Mithraism itself, which migrated from the Old Iranian pan-theon to the Roman one, and thus the authentic Iranian idea of bull-slaying in the act of cosmogony was transformed in order to become meaningful for the Roman devotee. In this regard John Hinnells states: “the Roman Mithraic reliefs depict the divine sacrifice which gives life to a man, a concept which ultimately derived from Iran but which was expressed in terms meaningful to people living in the Graeco-Roman world”.72 Thus, even if the parallel between the sacrifice of a bull to the Yezidi sun-deity and Mithra’s taurochtony seems to be obvious, still the interpretations of the ideas of these rites in both tradi-tions may have practically no points of contact.Due to the special attitude of the Yezidis to the sun, Sheikh Shams is one of the most venerated religious characters in the tradition: Šēx Šams ĉirāya, “Sheikh Shams is our light”, they say.73 At dawn a righteous Yezidi should kiss the place where the first rays of the sun fall, and neither Muslim, Christian nor Jew should see him at that moment.74 Still, this is not an adequate reason to consider Yezidis to be sun-worshippers, as they are often characterized to be in the literature. In the phrase of Sheikh Hasane Mamud, interviewed in field research, Sheikh Shams is xāčē maya, “our cross”, and only one of the Yezidis’ symbols. The sunworshipping among the Yezidis does not have any special resonance or relevance beyond the scope of the typical religious attention to the sun, or the ubiquitous solar cult.75The situation with Farxadin, that is, Faxr ad-din (Faxradīn, Farxadīn), the personification of the moon, is more enigmatic. There is no way to relate his name to the moon, and the information about his historical prototype gives no grounds for the similar development of the mythological personage. Farxa-din acquired his lunar character, most likely, as a result of his sibling relation-ship with Sheikh Shams, who was transmogrified into the solar deity due to his name. Such a cliché is quite typical for the Near Eastern religious mental-ity, according to which the sun and the moon are male deities, neighbouring each other in the sky.76 Thus, it is no wonder that the full blood-brother of Sheikh Shams, the personification of the sun, could come to be approached as his celestial brother as well. This does not come into conflict with the fact that the Yezidi folk tradition considers the sun and the moon to be brother and sister."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion70In any case, the elusive concept of this personage is also evidential of the secondary character of Farxadin as that of the lunar deity. It is enough to mention that a prolix hymn dedicated to Farxadin, the Qawlē Malak Farxadīn,77 does not even allude to his connection with the moon. And according to “The Black Scripture”,78 Malak Faxradīn (Farxadīn) or A’zīz Malak Faxradīn, that is, (Saint) Angel Farxadin is identified with Turail (or Nurail), the seventh avatar of Malak-Tāwūs. Thus, actually, the only reference to his lunar character is the fact that in folk tradition the moon is called Māngā Malak Farxadīn or “The disc of the Angel Farxadin”. Another, rather indirect, reference to the celestial nature of Farxadin can be found, probably, in the following passage of the qawl below:Či bāziyakī bi-nūrīna,Fiřī, ču a’zmīna,Min nadizānī ku suřā Faxradīna.What a luminous falcon it is!It flew away, it went to heaven,I was unaware that it was a mystery of Faxradin.79The lunar nature of Farxadin is also revealed from the ability to heal from the “lunar disease”, kēma hayvī or hīvē lēxistī (literally “the [state of being] moon-struck”), ascribed to him. Still, our field materials about the healing proce-dure, collected among the Yezidis of Armenia and characterized by numerous archaic elements preserved both in everyday life and rituals, contain neither any appeal to Farxadin nor any sacrifice to him. He is not even mentioned in the rite, while the role of the moon itself is obvious. One of the elements of the rite presupposes that a crescent-shaped pendant cut from a coin should be worn around the patient’s neck for three years, “until the moon is completely changed”. Mothers used to carry their sick children outside to the new moon, repeating Yā hīvā nu, tu dāykā zārēyī, az dāmārī, wī zārē xilāzka ži vī āgirī, “Oh new moon, you are the [real] mother of the child, and I am [his] stepmother; rid this child from the malady [literally ‘fire’]”.80Malak Farxadin is also believed to be a creator of the Yezidi religious lore or Qawl-ū-bayt.81 That is why the qawwals – the reciters – are considered Jēšē Malak Faxradīn, qawālē Šēxadī, “the armies of Malak Farxadin, the qawwals of Sheikh ‘Adi”.82 They should ask for Farxadin’s permission before reciting hymns. Hence the invocation of legitimacy: Haka ži bā Malak Faxradīn bētin dastūre (or īǰāzatē): “If authorization comes from dear Malak Farxadin”.83 The deliquescence and ambivalence of the moon’s nature (and correspondingly that of Malak Faxra-din) is determined, above all, by the fact that in the folk tradition, the moon is apprehended as something mystical and even inauspicious. The Yezidis believe that the moon (Farxadin) is able to bring misfortunes and calamities to people and livestock, as well as natural disasters – floods, earthquakes, and so on."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"71the yezidi minor deities, saints and holy menDespite the fact that in many cultures the moon has always been a wor-shipped figure, folk traditions never approach it so unambiguously: its declin-ing from the full disc and complete waning through the crescent and its waxing again to the appearance of the disc have always been fearsome for the human mind, which has preserved a number of negative characteristics of this celestial body as of something mutable, inconstant, connected with the powers of darkness, and bringing disease and destruction. It is no wonder that the moon has always been the object of magic, and the patron of witches and magicians.84 The most infernal is considered, of course, the phase of the full moon, when, according to various folk beliefs – Armenian, Iranian and Slavic (as well as various Western European) – the gates of hell are open and the earth is overrun with devilry. Clapping eyes on the full moon, a Yezidi passes his hand across his face and turns to Farxadin: Yā māngā Farxadīn, tu ma bēī řah’mē, “Oh Farxadin’s disc, have mercy for us”.A Yezidi should meet a new moon by touching his face with his hands while watching the young crescent. In former times the procedure included also singing and dancing, which was called līstikē hīvē or “the moon-dance”. People also let livestock outside and asked Farxadin for fertility. Among the Yezidi sheikhs of Armenia there is a rather marginal belief, that the moon is also the domain of Sheikh Sin (Malak Šēx Sīn), that is, Sheikh Hasan, one of the ‘Adawiyya’s esteemed leaders. This fact conveys the suggestion of the sec-ondary reference (as in the case of Sheikh Shams) to the Assyrian-Babylonian lord of the sun, Sīn. However, Sin as the lord of the moon exists in the more decisively Gnostic Mandaean tradition, and the described development could exclusively be the result of Mandean influence. Other variants can hardly be proposed, no matter how strange this may seem at first sight (as both Yez-idis and Mandeans have been closed esoteric societies, which considerably reduces the possibility of mutual influences). In the Mandaean folk tradition the moon is one of the seven planets – the creatures of god, each having a spirit in it: Shamish, Sin or Sera, Nirigh, Bel, Enwo, Liwet and Kiwan.85 The Mandaean Sin is also an ambivalent personage: he can appear either black or white. His sinister influence manifests itself in men’s behaviour, as he inclines people to commit crimes:86The face of Sin, the Moon, is like a cat, animal-like and black ... With Sin in the moon-ship is the King of Darkness also. He ... pulls men towards the earthly and gross, towards the dark and evil. He does this because he must, though he was created by and serves God, for there must be darkness and light and day and night. He is ordered to this by the Lord of Greatness ...87The Mandaean Sin, responsible also for abortions and deformities, is a mal-formed figure.88"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion72PīRā-FāT, FOREMOTHER OF THE YEzIdISThe Yezīdī sheikhy tradition says that, unlike all other peoples who originated from Adam and Eve, the Yezidis had only a primeval father, Adam. Eve played no role in their genesis. Once, the Yezidi legend tells us, Eve claimed that chil-dren were produced by her alone and that Adam had no part in creating them. In order to test her claim they put their seeds in separate jars and closed them. When, nine months later, they opened Eve’s jar, they found serpents, scorpions and poisonous insects, while in Adam’s jar there was a beautiful moon-faced child. They called the boy Šahīd bin-ǰarr (Arab. “Šahīd, the son of the pot”). He later married a hūrī and became Forefather of the Yezidis.89 This account of the origin of the Yezidis is also confirmed in one of the Yezidis’ so-called Holy Books, “The Black Scripture” (§14):Xwadāyī gawra bimalāyikaī gōt, min Ādam wa Hawā xalq dikim wa diyānkim bi bašar. Li siřī Ādam Šahr ibn-Safar dibē wa liawīš milatī li sar arz p’aydā dibē lipāštir milatī ‘Azrayīl ya‘nī Malak Tāwus kī yazīdīyāya p’aydā dibē.90The great god said to the angels: I create Adam and Eve, and make them human beings. From Adam’s essence Šahr ibn-Safar91 will appear, and from him will originate on Earth a people, who will later give birth to the people of ‘Azrayīl, i.e. Malak Tāwūs, who are the Yezidis.Another version of the same legend mentions two children in Adam’s jar.92 However, this Semitic legend with its non-orthodox, probably Gnostic inter-pretation is not the only popular myth that exists in this syncretic tradition.We were recently able to record some extremely interesting details among the Yezidis of Armenia that point to the existence of another legend concern-ing Yezidi origins, one that has Iranian roots and which is probably more authentic than the story of Adam and the jar. According to these materials, there is a female deity called Pīrā-Fāt and she is the daughter of Farxadin.93 Hitherto, nothing had been known of this character: scholarly works on Yez-idism make no mention of her existence at all. Philip Kreyenbroek does refer to a mythical character, Pīr Āfāt, allegedly associated with hail and damage to crops, inundations and storms.94 However, it appears that this author, or rather his informant,95 arrived at this name by misinterpreting the izāfa con-struction, that is, the feminine izāfa formant -ā in pīrā (probably from pīrikā) was understood as a part of the deity’s name itself, which resulted in the form Āfāt (pl. of Arab. āfat), meaning “damage, harm”. The presence of the izāfa formant in the deity’s name (formally it should be Pīr or Pīrik Fāt) supposedly emphasizes her female nature.96"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"73the yezidi minor deities, saints and holy menIn the Yezidi tradition Pīrā-Fāt is the patroness of women in labour, as well as of newborn babies, who protects them from the evil demoness Āl.97 A partu-rient woman asks for Pīrā-Fāt’s help: Yā Pīrā-Fāt, ālī min bika! “Oh Pīrā-Fāt, help me!” Those present traditionally express their hope for the deity’s assistance: Čārā Pīrā-Fāt bē hawārā ta! “May the seed of Pīrā-Fāt help you!”98 The word čār in this formula means “seed”, which developed from “means, possibility” via the interim stage of “liquid, medicine” (cf. Middle Pers. čārak, New Pers. čāra, also Armen. dial. čār, “medicine, means”). This phrase specifically expresses the wish that the woman will give birth to a pure Yezidi from the original seed of the Yezidi people, since Pīrā-Fāt is traditional preserver of this seed. Similarly, they invoke this seed when embarking on a journey: Yā Pīrā-Fāt, čārā ta sar ma, “Oh Pīrā-Fāt, let your assistance (seed) be with us”. Pīrā-Fāt actually appears here as the foremother of the Yezidis, who has saved from annihilation the seed from which this people originated.The legend says that the seed was given to Pīrā-Fāt for safekeeping by Sheikh Abū Bakr (Šēxōbakr), the incarnation of the angel Michael (Mikail), one of the avatars of Malak-Tāwūs. Pīrā-Fāt then preserved it for seven hundred years, or, according to another version, for seven thousand. Unfortunately, no further details of this myth are to be found. One of the religious hymns (qawl) merely alludes to the story, and this appears to be the only trace of this legend in the Yezidi oral tradition.P’ādšāyē min vē yakē dilšāya,Faqīrak šāndīya tavakā harharē, āvak ānyīya;Nāvē wē dānīya šarāv, ti’ūn, a’ynil-bayzāya;Aw řōša, av řōža miǰlisā mērē ēzdī pē būya āvāya.99My god [lit. “king”] is happy because[He] sent once a faqīr [probably Šēxōbakr] to the seventh sphere ofheavens; [he] brought a liquid [lit. “water”];They called it wine, flour, yolk and egg white;100That day, this day, the community of Yezidis appeared.This “liquid” (āv), according to our informant Faqir Tayar (Armavir, Armenia), consisted of four elements: fire, water, earth and air. It is directly indicated further in the same hymn:P’ādšāyē mine ǰabāra,Ži duřē farq [rather xalq] kirna čāra:Bāyā, āva, āxa ū nāra.101My god [lit. king] is powerful,[He] created a liquid from a pearl:It is wind [air], water, earth and fire."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion74Here the legend of origin is combined with the symbol of cosmogony, the pearl (duř): the liquid, seed of the Yezidi people, represents actually the arte-fact of the primordial pearl, thus becoming an element of cosmogony.102The existence of two popular legends of genesis in one and same tradition is fascinating per se, providing clear evidence of the tradition’s syncretic roots. As mentioned above, the basic legend, which has been perfectly preserved, is most probably a Gnostic hangover of Yezidism. The second myth, which has been preserved only partially, mainly in its secondary and indirect references to the deity Pīrā-Fāt, is, no doubt, more typical for the Iranian world. Another indirect reflection of this myth can be found in the following passage from a hymn by Sheikh Arabagī Antūzī, an example of the genre of hymns involving theological polemics with the representatives of other confessions. In fact, the whole contradiction between two anthropogonic myths is reflected in the fol-lowing lines:Nawērim bik’ēlimīm;Wakī az bēžim, sunata barī Ādama,Azē biřiǰimīm.Sunata barī Ādama,Aw ma’nīka mazina ... 103I cannot speak;If I say that [the people of the] sunna [here, the Yezidis]had existed before Adam,I will be accursed.[But] in the precedence of Adam,The great meaning [is hidden] ...The name of the deity, Pīrā-Fāt, literally means “old woman Fāt”, and appar-ently goes back to the name of the Prophet Muhammad’s daughter, Fātima. This character absorbed many of the features of pre-Islamic patron deities of fertility and family, and she is worshipped all over the Muslim world, espe-cially among the Shi‘as. The Virgin Mary (Mariam) has almost the same func-tion in Islam, and women in labour appeal, as a rule, to both of them.104 Fāt is shown to be a variant of Fātima by the fact that in certain contexts both forms of the name are used for the Prophet Muhammad’s daughter. The Yezidi hymn dedicated to ‘Alī, the lion of god (Bayt’ā A’lī Šērē Xwadē), offers clear evidence of this:105Či sibaka nahīna!Digrī A’yš, Fāt ū ZīnaSavā hard kurē A’līna.A’lī dihāta māla,"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"75the yezidi minor deities, saints and holy menFātimē pēřā sařū qāla;Gōta: “Ta girtī kirina zīndānē”,Aw Fātima dēm šalāla.What a horrible morning!Aysha, Fātima [Fāt in the text] and Zaynab [Zīn] were weepingFor the two sons of ‘Alī [i.e. Hasan and Hussain].‘Alī was coming home,Fātima was arguing,[She] said [to him]: “You jailed the prisoners!”That Fātima with a shining face!The shortening of the name Fātima, or, to be more precise, the omission of the end syllables, obviously results from the Kurdish interpretation of the name: Fātima (or Fātīma) was understood as an izāfa construction Fātī ma (Fātā ma): “our Fāt”.“The palm of Fātima”, the symbol of the five main characters in Shi‘ism, the Prophet Muhammad, ‘Alī, Fātima, Hasan and Hussain, is an essential ele-ment of the talismans and amulents that offer protection from evil spirits and demons.106 A metal representation of “the palm of Fātima” is a significant accessory of any god-fearing Shi‘a house, alongside a portrait of ‘Alī, whose image has also accumulated certain characteristics of Old Iranian mythical personages – from Verethragna to Rustam.Fātima’s many features in the popular Shi‘a interpretation are strikingly similar to those of Anahita (Anāhitā), the Old Iranian goddess (yazata-) of fecundity and procreation, who is directly connected with water. Pīrā-Fāt’s role as the preserver of the first seed in the Yezidi religion associates her still more with her archetype Anahita.107 What is especially important here is that Anahita is in charge of the man’s seed, as well as childbirth: she is the purifier of all men’s seed and all women’s wombs.Yā vīspanam aršnam xšudrū yaoždaδāiti,Yā vīspanam hāirišinam zδai garǝuuan yaoždaδāiti,Yā vīspå hāirišīš huzamitō daδāiti,Yā vīspanam hāirišinam dāitim raδuuim paēma auua-baraiti.108In James Darmesteter’s translation this passage is rendered as follows:Who [Anahita] makes the seed of all males pure,Who makes the womb of all females pure for bringing forth [so that]it may conceive again,Who makes all females bring forth in safety,"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion76Who puts milk into breasts of all females in the right measure andthe right quality.109Moreover, Pīrā-Fāt’s function as the original seed-keeper also matches that of Armati-Spandārmat in preserving the seed of the First man (Gayōmart) and thereby ensuring the procreation of the first human couple: Mašyak (Martiyak) and Mašyānak (Martiyānak). In the Bundahishn, this myth reads as follows:When Gayōmart was dying and dropped his seed, a part [of it] was imbibed by Spandarmat [Earth]. For forty years it remained in the earth. In forty years, Mašyak and Mašyānak grew up as rhubarb plants out of the earth ... Then [they] turned into humans, and xwarr – their soul – entered into them.110Preservation of the primordial seed in various environments is in gen-eral a common mythologeme in the Iranian tradition (as with the story of Zoroaster’s seed, which was kept for 99,999 years in lake Kansaoya-Hāmūn; the story of Satana and a shepherd in the Ossetic Nart epic; and so on). The examples given above confirm the authenticity of the myth about Pīrā-Fāt, the seed-keeper in the Yezidi tradition. Although this is not explicity stated in the extant materials, it was most probably Pīrā-Fāt who produced the first Yezidi from the primordial seed.111xATūNā-FARxā, PATRONESS OF PREGNANT WOMEN ANd INFANTSXatūnā-farxā literally means “The Dame of Children” (Arab. farx, “chicken”, meaning “infant”). Incidentally, a similar attribute used to be given also to evil creatures: consider how the well-known demoness Āl (Armen. Alk‘), the enemy of infants and women in labour, is named ’umm uṣṣibyān, “mother of children”. This latter type of definition, however, is an attribute of a demonized deity,112 whereas on the Yezidi understanding Xātūna-farxā mostly cares about a woman during pregnancy. It is likely that both labour and the postnatal periods fall under the cognizance of Pīrā-Fāt. The name of Xātūna-farxā does nonetheless unambiguously indicate the function of protectress of infants during the initial forty days of life in particular. It is believed that she stays in the house, side-by-side with the woman in labour and with the new-born child, protecting them in every way from the encroachments by Āl. It is strictly prohibited to bath the baby during the čilla – the initial forty days – for it is believed that the baby will be invaded by evil spirits, but they will lose their malignant power when this term expires with the first bathing of the baby at the čilla’s end. Before bathing they pour seven times forty spoons of water on baby’s head, reiterating the following formula:"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"77the yezidi minor deities, saints and holy menČilla čū xwařā,Zāřōk mā mařā.Chilla has left all alone,[And] the child will stay with us.In fact, Xātūna-farxā is a frail duplicate of Pīrā-Fāt with a reduced scope of activities and yet with many features in their images being similar. Xātūna-farxā, like Pīrā-Fāt, is a daughter of Malak Fakhr ad-Din (Farxadīn); she is addressed for help in childbirth (when seeing a pregnant woman, they say: Xatūnā-farxā bē hawāra ta! “May Xatūnā-farxā help you!”); like Pīrā-Fāt, Xātūna-farxā protects the newly born from Āl and other evil creatures.Although Xātūna-farxā has her own (rather controversial) genealogy, has kin (brother, husband), a legendary tomb in Lalish, and is even the eponym of the sheikhy clan Shekhe-Khatune (Šēxē Xātūnē),113 she is nevertheless a sec-ondary figure, budding from the image of Pīrā-Fāt, her kinship and genealogi-cal links probably resulting from secondary developments. The existence of two goddesses with nearly similar functions, almost identical origin and activ-ities cannot be logically explained. Perhaps the epithet Xātūna-farxā (i.e. “the mistress of infants”) had been primarily an attribute of Pīrā-Fāt, yet with the overall name of the goddess being Pīrā-Fāt – xātūna-farxā (i.e. “Pīrā-Fāt – the lady of infants”). Later, probably, the attribute may have been recognized as an individual entity with restricted functions and a self-sustained life within the popular mind, overgrowing with personal features and popularly imaged elements.Šēx-KIRāS, THE SPIRIT OF THE GARMENTŠēx-kirās is an almost forgotten personage now. He is mentioned only by Giuseppe Furlani.114 His name – Šēx-kirās – can be literally translated as the Sheikh of the garment (rather, “the Sheikh of the robe”) (Kurdish kirās < Old Iranian *kṛpa-pāθra-, “protecting a body”). Probably, he was responsible for the process of death, transmigration of a soul, maybe even reincarnation – the exchange of bodies like that of clothes. In modern Yezidism the concept of reincarnation exists only implicitly (and this idea coexists with the traditional concept of paradise and hell, left to the Yezidi doctrine by the Islamic deriva-tion). There is an allusion to it in the Yezidi “Book of Revelation” (part II, §12; see Chapter 2 above). Still, tanāsux (reincarnation) is one of the basic ideas of some esoteric teachings in Islam,115 including heterodox Shi‘a sects, which have much in common with Yezidism, and could in turn have been acquired from prior Gnostic and “mystical” roots.116 The absence of any centralized religious institution, meaning the absence of any official doctrine, very often allows two opposite notions to coexist in the Yezidis’ world outlook, elements"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion78sometimes being without adequate representation in the tradition. Šēx-kirās could be also an epithet to the name of Nasr ad-din, a psychopomp and the angel of death, one of the manifestations of Malak-Tāwūs. Then later Šēx-kirās could have been transformed from an epithet to a separate personage with certain functions.The garment and clothes in general often symbolize the body and physi-cal existence; “to take a garment off” is a metaphor for death, and to change it is a metaphor for reincarnation. The phrase kirās guhērīn – lit. “to change clothes” – is the denotation of death among the Yezidis. The Ahl-i Haqq fol-lowers, speaking about incarnation, use the Turkish word dun or Persian ǰāme (“dressing”); the Persian be lebās āmadan, lit. “to put on clothes” and meaning “to be made flesh”.117 The reference to the body as a garment is a well-known Gnostic concept.118 It is worthy of note that in one of the Parthian Manichaean mourning hymns, the dramatic description of Mani’s death is represented with the same metaphor: frāmōxtiš tanβār padmōžan aβδēn (M5, 63–66), “And he (the Prophet Mani) shed his beautiful bodily garment (= he died)”. Still, even this turns out to be the most conventional metaphor when there are deeper insights to be found. In Gnosticism the robe can symbolize the primordial self of a person, his initial idea, his alter ego in the heavens, preserved in the upper world, while the person himself lives below, in the material world: “His image (garment) was kept untouched in its place”, says the Mandaean text.119 One of the emanations in the Coptic Manichaean genealogy of gods is the Image of Light or the Angel with the Garments of Light, who comes to a dying man. The Angel meeting a dying man, delivers to him his true clothes – “the Garment of Light” – thus giving him back his real, original essence, or his heavenly ego.120 The fact that Šēx-kirās is in charge of the process of death suggests a compa-rably assignable role to him.A very illustrative piece ad locum is “The Hymn of the Pearl” from the apoc-ryphal Acts of Thomas. The narrative text, which, actually, can hardly be called a “hymn”, is about Judas Thomas, who has to leave his “splendid robe” in his Father’s home and to set out in search of the Pearl (the Gnostic metaphor for a soul, in particular, the lost soul). Having come home after long wanderings, the son again acquires his robe, realizing suddenly that it is like his reflection in the mirror:... my splendid robe which I had taken off,And my toga with which it was wrapped about,From the heights of HyrcaniaMy parents sent thitherBy the hand of their treasurers,Who for their faithfulness were trusted therewith.Indeed, I remember no more its dignity,For I had left it in my childhood in my father’s house,But suddenly, when I saw it over against me,"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"79the yezidi minor deities, saints and holy menThe splendid robe became like me, as my reflection in themirror;I saw it wholly in me,And in it I saw myself quite apart from myself,So that we were two in distinctionAnd again one in a single form....And my toga of brilliant coloursI drew completely over myself.I clothed myself with it and mounted upTo the court of greeting and homage.I bowed my head and worshippedThe splendour of the father who had sent it to me,Whose command I had accomplished,As he also had done what he promised....And I was with him in his kingdom....And he promised me that to the courtOf the king of kings I should journey with him againAnd with my offering and my pearlWith him appear before our king.121Thus, regaining the heavenly robe means the return to the eternal home, to the Father’s kingdom.We would, of course, refrain from drawing a direct genetic parallel between this Gnostic sujet here and the functions of the Yezidi Šēx-kirās. Nonetheless, the fact that Sheikh of the robe is in charge of the burial rite, and he meets a soul right after a person has just passed the way of all things and is ready to enter the Hereafter, may actually reflect the same concept, which once existed in Yezidism, but was later lost together with the memory of its mystical roots.There is also another character dealing with clothes in the Yezidi beliefs – Hazmamān (Hasan Mamān, Hazmamān, Hazil Mamān), who is also venerated among the Yezidis of Armenia. Almost nothing is known about him either. Hazmamān is as the distributor of caps and dervishes’ robes (k’ulik and xarqa). He is also called P’īrē xarqa ū k’uluk, the Pir (i.e. “saint”) of xarqa and k’ulik. Being the head of all pirs, he bears the title P’īrē čil p’īrā(n) or čil mēra(n) –“The pir of forty pirs”. “Forty saints”, as well as four, seven or eleven ones, popu-lar clichés in folk Islam, has exclusively nominal representation in Yezidi doc-trine, without any names or details. Yet apart from Hazmamān, leadership over forty saints is ascribed to Mama Rashan122 or to Pir Dawud (P’ir Dāwūdē Darmān).123 The latter, considered to be Sheikh ‘Adi’s servant, is sometimes mentioned in qawls in parallel with Hazmamān. Consider the following:"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion80Dāwūdē bin Darmāna,Hazmamān p’īrē čil p’īrāna.124This is Dawud, the son of Darman,Hazmaman, the Pir of forty pirs.As likely as not, Hazmamān could once have been either the same figure as Šēx-kirās, or just another personification of the same concept.MAMē-ŠIVāN ANd GāVāNē zARzāN, THE LORdS OF CATTLEIn the pantheons of the peoples who are overwhelmingly cattle farmers in their traditional lifestyle, usually the most venerated figures are deities patronizing livestock. Ancient Graeco-Roman mythology has retained for us a very colourful image of Old Greek Pan and his Roman counterpart Faunus. The playful Pan, patron of herds, forests and fields and a great judge and fan of the shepherd’s pipe, is ambivalent, like any chthonic image. For, at the same time, he patronizes the destructive elements of earth, one of his favourite games being to spread panic. In the customs and beliefs of the Iranian peo-ples, despite their deeply rooted Muslim outlook, a close scrutiny will reveal an array of pagan images patronizing domestic and wild animals, certainly going back to very early layers of religious thinking. In many cattle- breeding Iranian communities, ancient gods of cattle were converted into guardian spirits of animals, being generally featured under a polysemantic term pīr and having no institutional manifestations.125 However, the Yezidis, the Zazas and the peoples of Caspian coastal areas known for archaic lifestyle and adherence to traditions, as well as the highlanders of southwestern Iran, have retained to date the gods or lords of livestock in their authentic images, with the relevant characteristics and original names.Among the Yezidis it is Mamē-Šivān, the “shepherd (for small cattle) Mam”, and Gāvānē Zarzān, “herdsman (for neat cattle) Zarzan”.126 They protect live-stock from the wolves, from misfortune and disease. Mamē-Šivān patronizes small cattle, while Gāvānē Zarzān protects the heavy beasts. Meanwhile, the cultic value of the former is distinctly more visible in the prayers of popu-lar usage, perhaps by virtue of the prevailing role of small cattle breeding in the agricultural activities of the Yezidis. Hence the ejaculative sayings: Mamē-Šivān puštīvānē ta ba, “Let Mamē-Šivān be your protector”, or Du’ae Mamē-Šivān sar mālē ta ba, “Let the blessing by Mamē-Šivān be upon your home”, and so on. The Yezidi shepherds rely upon these gods, calling on them when putting cattle to pasture:Am pištī ta, Mamē-Šivān, dičin bar vī pazī; pišti ta, Gāvānē Zarzān, dičin bar vī dawārī; am pištī ta, Mamē-Šivān, paz xway dikin, am pištī ta Gāvānē Zarzān, dēwēr xway dikin."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"81the yezidi minor deities, saints and holy menRelying on you, Mamē-Šivān, we follow that flock (of sheep); rely-ing on you, Gāvānē Zarzān, we follow the herd (of cows); relying on you, Mamē-Šivān, we go after the small cattle; relying on you, Gāvānē Zarzān we go after neat cattle.127The young shepherds about to start work address them with hope for help: Gumānā ma hūnīn; gumāna ma tuī, yā Mamē-Šivān; gumāna mā tuī, Gāvānē Zarzān, “You are our hope; you are our hope, Oh Mamē-Šivān; you are our hope, Oh Gāvānē Zarzān!”128The cultic significance of Mamē-Šivān and Gāvānē Zarzān is vividly traced during the celebration of the Yezidi New Year or A’ydā sarsālē, celebrated on the first Wednesday in April (Old Style), or (according to other sources) on March 8 (hayštē ādarē). Put into a big New Year pie, called kulučē sarā sālē (tōtkē sarē sālē) is a bead, a blue one according to some sources (which is remark-able, since the colour blue is a taboo in Yezidism), or a coin. The pie is cut into pieces marked out for different gods and guardian spirits, as well as for the family members, except infants who cannot discern virtue from sin (xēr ū guna). The pie is divided between Mamē-Šivān and Gāvānē Zarzān, the Spirit of the Household (Xudānē-mālē) augmenting welfare, the Spirit of the furrow (Xatā-ǰōt) patronizing land farming, and then further among the family: master of the house (malxwē mālē), the mistress (kavānīyā mālē), and so on. Depending on who is going to get the bead, any one of these gods is going to be particularly benevolent to the family in the new year, or one of the family members is going to be particularly fortunate.129Mamē-Šivān used to be addressed by a special incantation within a par-ticular rite during the Barān-bardān festival. The protector of small cattle was propitiated by mixing sheep wool with ram wool, spreading it on the ground and letting children wallow on it chanting the song, appealing to the deity for more cattle yield:Barān-bardān, ǰān, Barān-bardān!Barak’at ba Barān-bardān;Birā hāzir ba Mamē-Šivān,Pazē ma xwayka ži γadā-balā.Baran-Bardan, glory to you!Let there be abundance [prosperity];Let Mamē-Šivān attend [the holiday],Let [him] protect our cattle from misfortune.By some sources, the wool from the rams and sheep was plucked by an old man, sitting on the back of his old wife.130 Mamē-Šivān is considered, among other things, an earthly twin representative of the constellation of the Ram.131"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion82An interesting legend has been preserved about Gāvānē Zarzān: Sheikh ‘Adi was entertaining members of his community at his home; each came with a due gift and obtained a blessing and the proper empowerment. Gāvānē Zarzān, being a poor shepherd of neat cattle, brought a barley loaf to the Patriarch, the only thing that he had found. However, when approaching the chamber of Sheikh ‘Adi, he became shy and stood in a humble posture with the loaf under his dress. The all-seeing Sheikh addressed him with the following words: “Take courage, your modest gift is worth more for me than a whole cow”; then he blessed the shepherd: “Go, and be the protector of the cows! Let your patron-age over the herds of my people remain for ages and ages!”132Healing the small cattle is a special procedure whereby the representa-tives of clergy (a sheikh or a pīr) wash the diseased sheep with water from the miracle-working bowl of Mamē-Šivān (t’āsā Mamē-Šivān). Such bowls (made commonly of copper, ornamented inside in Arabic writing-style) were kept in wealthy families in the home bedding (stēř), which was regarded as holy (see below). The bowl is removed when needed only by spiritual persons or unmarried girls or young men. A certain offering is due to the bowl annually. It is provided also for the treatment of sheep of other families who have paid a tribute to the host (with a length of cloth, butter or cheese) or made an offer-ing.133 Making part of the shrine of Mamē-Šivān in Lalish, in a cave-like recess with the so-called “Wishing Pillar” (stūnā mirāza), visitors put their palms to the column, believing that it will help fulfil desires. The name of Mamē-Šivān has become the eponym of a family of pīrs at a village in Sheikhan, called Mamē-Šivān, which is also known as “Little Lalish”.134Interestingly, the cults of cattle guardians in a dual form and linguistically resembling the Yezidi patrons of cattle have been registered in Central Ana-tolia, in Dersim (now Tunceli) among the Zazas, in our view originating from Daylam (south Caspian area) and confessing predominantly a particular type of extreme Shi‘ism.135 Meanwhile, the Kurds, a linguistically proximate people to the Yezidis, have only an indiscriminate spirit of domestic animals – P’īr. The god-protectors of cattle amid the Zazas are Sārikō-šuān and Mamō-gāvān (or Wāyirō xēr, i.e. “Master of Prosperity”). The Zazas have also the evil spirit, enemy of the cattle, Wāyirō xirāv (i.e. “Master of Evil and Destruction”), the persecutor, the torturer of animals, who smothers them by mounting them, causing them to run wild screaming in despair. Therefore, when the cattle return from the field in the afternoon, after closing the door on them, the Zaza custom prescribes to mention Sārikō-šuān and Mamō-gāvān, at the same time defaming Wāyirō xirāv.136THE HOLY ANGEL, dEITY OF THE PHALLuSIt seems to be that the Yezidi Milyāk’atē-qanǰ (i.e. the Holy Angel),137 is the only example of the Deus Phalli in all New Iranian folk pantheons. Moreover,"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"83the yezidi minor deities, saints and holy mensimilar personages have never been attested in Iran, neither in ancient nor in the mediaeval periods. As far as we know, the only written reference to this deity is to be found in Amine Avdal’s book published in 1957 in Armenian.138 Nor is any mention made of Milyāk’atē-qanǰ in recordings of Yezidi folkloric texts. Our thorough fieldwork in the Yezidi communities of Armenia, as well as among the northern Iraqi Yezidis, has not added much to the existing data. Most of the female informants, incidentally, tried to avoid this subject alto-gether, denying the very existence of a phallic deity in Yezidi beliefs.Still, the information gleaned from our research thus far allows us to recon-struct at least the general idea of this deity, once probably a popular image among the Yezidis. Naturally, Milyāk’atē-qanǰ is far from being the popular Priapus of ancient myth, who had a variety of functions. The Holy Angel is a classic example of an authentic phallic deity charged with the sphere of Eros and impregnation. The comparison with Priapus is significant, for the differ-ence between them points to the more primeval nature of the Yezidi phallic personage. The authenticity of the Holy Angel is one of his most important characteristics. Any religious form that attempts to rid itself of “historical” accretions will tend to gravitate to its authentic archetype.139 Thus, whereas the humanized god of the ancient world expresses resistance to the sacral, and hence a departure from authenticity, Milyāk’atē-qanǰ in this respect is authen-ticity itself. He does not merely personify his functions, but is himself the very organ. The Holy Angel is imagined only in a phallic form. In this regard the Yezidi deity can be duly compared with the Indian Lingam, one of the avatars of Shiva, which is also a bare phallus per se.140Convinced that a child could be conceived only with the blessing of Milyāk’atē-qanǰ, young brides traditionally wore a silver or stone pendant called xiyār (“cucumber”), which was shaped like a phallus to symbolize the deity.141 “Cucumber” is definitely a metaphoric euphemism, as is the deity’s name “Holy Angel”. At earlier stages, no doubt, the deity may well have had another name, most probably one that pointed more directly to his func-tions142 and was, therefore, formally tabooed later on and replaced by the euphemistic expressions. Milyāk’atē-qanǰ was supposed to cure sterility and to help women conceive a boy. The Yezidi women turned to him with the fol-lowing words:Yā Milyāk’atē-qanǰ, wara hawārā min.Bar mi rūnī;Da’w ba, risq ba;Kur vī, qīz vī.143O Milyāk’atē-qanǰ, help me [to conceive a child],Impregnate me [lit. “Sit upon me”];Let me have yogurt, let me have good;Let me have a son, let me have a daughter."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion84According to the same informant, whose data are indirectly substantiated in Adval’s materials,144 the Yezidi women would walk to the mountains after the wedding ceremony and make a sacrifice to Milyāk’atē-qanǰ before large phallic-shaped stones. The sacrifice was considered the guarantee of multiple progeny.Barren women performed a fertility ritual by sitting down on the stones and making rubbing motions invoking the deity: Yā Milyāk’atē-qanǰ, mi āvis ka, “O Milyāk’atē-qanǰ, make me pregnant” (the same informant). This formula, incidentally, offers a very special example of verbal magic. In particular, it should be noted that the word āvis (here meaning “pregnant”) is normally applied only to cattle. The proper terms to apply to a human pregnancy are girān, duhālī or hamla. And if such an apparent aischrology really occurred in the verbal part of the rite dedicated to the Holy Angel, this could be one of the reasons for the taboo.145 A similar rite existed also among the Armenians. A woman rubbed her navel against a large phallic-shaped stone called portak‘ar (lit. “navel-stone” in Armenian), and then hammered a nail into a stone crack, transferring her ailment to the stone.146 Turkic speaking women living in enclaves in the Zangezur region of Armenia used to perform the same rite.147Generally, a stone as an object of Sexualkult is seen in many different cul-tures. In some, a bride climbs on top of a stone, or obscene gestures accom-pany a ritual dance, and so on. All such rituals are aimed at curing sterility and ensuring fertility in general.148 Moreover, stone worshipping in this connec-tion cannot be explained exclusively by the logic of imitative magic, but pri-marily by the fact that a stone was considered a deity’s abode, one of the very common elements of the primitive religions.149 Present-day rites of this kind, however, have more or less lost their original essence, this communion with the hierophany. What they reveal instead is secondary perception, the result of the symbol’s degradation to an object of imitative magic.Milyāk’atē-qanǰ was obviously supposed to be present during the circum-cision ceremony, which is completely forgotten by now. The ceremony was performed by the “Brother of the Next world” of the family,150 who, upon cut-ting the boy’s prepuce, appealed to the Holy Angel: Yā, Milyāk’atē-qanǰ, barak’atī bida; birā zēda ba qawatā vī kūř, “O Milyāk’atē-qanǰ, give prosperity, [and] may the force of this boy be increased”. After the ceremony they used to sacrifice a sheep and distribute the meat among the poor.The Holy Angel, as could be expected, is also traced in the wedding rites. The Yezidis used to adorn one of the trees in front of the groom’s house, and put a phallic-shaped wooden stick in between its boughs. They called it Milyāk’atē-qanǰ. Before entering the house, a new-married couple stayed for a while under the tree, and the groom’s friends shook it uttering: Zavā ū būk mīna vē dārē bibār bin, “May the groom and bride be fertile (fruitful) like this tree”, or Mālā zavē t’ižī zāřō bin, “May the groom’s house be full of children”.Odd traces of the phallic cult have been preserved in the Yezidi festival Barān-bardān or “Releasing of Rams”, celebrated on the fortieth day of autumn,"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"85the yezidi minor deities, saints and holy menthat is, at the end of the first ten days of October. The feast is described by the Armenian Yezidi writer Arab Shamilov in his novel Šivānē kurd (“Kurdish Shep-herd”) and later in his short story Barbāng (Day-spring):This day the whole world is joyful, as if they were celebrating the wedding of their sheep. Young people dance; some of them fight, bubbling over with joy ... The shepherds and wranglers [dūšivān] are the most exalted ones, as they receive their payment for the whole summer season [on this day]. During the Barān-bardān, they drive ewes into a sheepfold, and then release the rams, which have been grazed separately the whole summer. They do this in order that the sheep will produce their young simultaneously in the spring. The moment the rams are released to the ewes, people start shooting from rifles, as if they wanted to celebrate the wedding of their sheep.151As reported elsewhere:They hang bunches of coloured wool, small bells and amulets on the sheep’s horns and necks – it seems as if the sheep know them-selves that this is their wedding: holding their heads high, they jostle each other, then stand quietly for a while, then try to prove themselves again, looking proudly at the shepherds and the gazing folk around. Then young girls take off their kerchiefs and tie them around the sheep’s necks, and young lads come and take them off: in this way they reveal their secrets, for by taking a kerchief of a certain girl, a lad shows his intention to marry her (the result of their flirtation during the Summer pasture). The girls’ parents look on from afar to see who will take their daughter’s kerchief.152They released the rams to the ewes in late evening when the Ram constella-tion (Barānī) appeared in the sky. The Yezidis believed that the Ram was the celestial twin of Mamē-Šivān and could increase the sheep’s get. While releas-ing the rams they used to utter: Yā Barānī, yā Mamē-Šivān, hūn pazē ma zēdakin, “O, Ram, O, Mamē-Šivān, increase [the number of] our sheep!” Other details of this feast have been described in the ethnographical literature: red apples are speared on sheep’s horns; their foreheads are decorated with pieces of mirror; young girls bring the rams to the ewes, holding them by their horns; in some cases a young maiden straddles a ram; and so on.153Of course, the ceremonies described above are not directly connected with the cult of Milyāk’atē-qanǰ. Still, to ensure the fertility of the flock and to a certain extent that of the young people attending the feast as well, ample use is made of phallic symbolism: in the indirect means used to deliver kerchiefs to the girls’ chosen fellows; in the way the young maidens hold the rams’ horns;"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion86in the use of red apples as tokens of defloration and of mirrors to symbolize doubling and fertility; and so on. In earlier times the rite probably involved people’s active participation in the “wedding” ceremony as well, if not through outright coitus, then at least through ritual (gestural and verbal) obscenity, and so on. In mediaeval Iran this feast was probably called *gušn-hilišnīh, the exact equivalent for which in Classical Armenian was xoy-t‘ołowt‘iwn, that is, “the releasing of the rams”. The Middle Iranian form cited above can be traced to Old Iranian *waršni-hṛdzana-.154In a short talk, Gulizar Mamoyan, a Yezidi woman of around ninety years from Aragats region of Armenia, added a new detail of utmost interest to the story of the Yezidi phallic cult. She remembered that when she was young, the barren and newly married women, in summer quarters (wārga), used to pick up small red mushrooms – kārīēd sōr – on the mountain slopes. They strung the mushrooms on threads and hung them on the necks. They believed, she said, that mushrooms could cure sterility and induce the productivity of women’s wombs. The women also performed a round dance (gōvand) around big mushrooms that appeared after rain, in a secluded place, far from men’s eyes. The old lady remembered a short part of the incantation accompanying the rite:Kārī, kārī,Laz mi bika ārī!Zikē mi bika p’ētak,P’ētakā mi – ǰērē ēr,Jērē mi bika p’ētak ...Mushroom, mushroom,Help me soon!Make my womb a box [here a wooden box for keeping cereals],[Make] my wooden box a flour’s jar,[Make] my jar a wooden box ...The significant role of the mushroom in magic and cult is a renowned fact. Mushrooms are universally known as aphrodisiacs. The swelling and grow-ing of a mushroom must have been perceived as imitation of phalloi. The red colour of the mushrooms used as objects of magic by the Yezidi women is itself an obvious sign of masculinity. The whole complex of cults devoted to Milyāk’atē-qanǰ has been virtually lost by now, yet he may well have been a rather influential deity, who initially had wider functions. It is quite possi-ble that Milyāk’atē-qanǰ was the Yezidi women’s deity par excellence, a kind of secret fetish that was concealed, formally, of course, from men."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"87the yezidi minor deities, saints and holy mendAWRēŠ-A’Rd, LORd OF THE EARTHOne of the rare gods in the Yezidi pantheon actually carries in his name the direct explication of his domain, in contrast to others commonly named after mythical or semi-mythical characters. Dawrēš-a’rd or Dawrēšē-a’rd liter-ally means “Saint (Master or Host) of the earth”.155 According to some data, Dawrēšē-a’rd is identified with Sheikh Abu Bakr (Šēxōbakr), personifying Angel Michael (Mikail), the fourth avatar of Malak-Tāwus. Dawrēš-a’rd is men-tioned in three sacred texts: Dirōzga (“Prayer”), Du’āya ōxirē (“Prayer of for-tune and bounty”), and Du’āya t’asmīlī (t’aslīmī) a’rd (“Prayer for committing to earth”) – also called Du’āya Dawrēšī-a’rd (“Prayer to the lord of the earth”) – all offered during the funeral rites.In the first of the abovementioned texts the name of this god was brought up only casually, in the one expression (Xātirā Dawrēšē-a’rd, “In the name of Dawrēšē-a’rd), when enumerating the names of some saints. In another text, that is, in the “Prayer of fortune” to be read prior to setting out for travel, Dawrēšē-a’rd is addressed for protection along the way, for among other things he keeps the belongings of the traveller from being damaged or lost, in life as well as after death. Note the end lines of this prayer talking about the lord of the earth:156Yā xwadē, milē Ēzdīd p’arda ba sar ma,Yā Pīrā-Fāt, čārā ta sar ma,Yā xwadē, Dawrēšē a’rd, ānamatē ma ta.Oh god, [may] the shoulder of [Sultan] Ezid be thy curtain over us,Oh Pīrā-Fāt, [may] thy help [lit. “seed”] be with us,Oh god, Dawrēšē-a’rd, [may] our belongings be in thy storage.Detailed information on the functions of this god can be found in the “Prayer for committing to earth”, read quietly by a sheikh or a pir from among the five spiritual guides of the deceased (pēnǰ t’irēqē farzē)157 when the body is com-mitted to earth and the funeral train (except the guides) leaves the graveside.Du’āya t’asmīlī a’rdē, this prayer of committal to the earth, is one of the most sacral prayers of the Yezidis; its performance is banned not only outside the rite, but also within the hearing range of laymen, all the more so of aliens. Any representative of clerical castes should know the prayer of committing to earth by rote. Here is the text of the prayer as recorded by Margarita Rudenko:158T’asmīlī t’aslīma ta,T’aslīmī Dawrēš-a’rd.Yā, Dawrēš-a’rd,Avī a’vdī, harga žina, harga mēra,Bixafirīnī, bisif’irīnī."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion88Sāhibtī ruh’ē wī/wē bikī.Barxē Ezdīda,Tōqā Tāwūsē Malak stūyē wī dāna.Banē ādam, wē bēna sar ta Naka ū Mankīna,Pirskin: “Xwadē ta k’īya?”Bē: “Xwadēyē min azdā”,Xwadēyē hišyār ū mastāna,Xwadēyē čōl ū bistāna,Xwadēyē h’amū xwadāna,A’vd ū banī nizāna.Aw xāliqē mawl ū māwiya,Bē čandara, bē gunaya;Aw na bīna, na žī bāya,Aw na awsiya, na nafsīya!”H’aft xwazilā min vī nafsī,Awī rah’m lē pirsē,Waka a’malē ta rah’m xwadē li ta ba.We commit you [to earth with] commitment,We commit you to the lord of the earth.Oh lord of the earth,This slave [of god], whether a man or a woman,Shelter and appease [him/her],Take care of his/her soul.[He/she] is a lamb of [Sultan] Ezid,The cord–ring of the Peacock Angel is on his/her neck.Oh offspring of Adam, you will be visited by Naka and Mankē;159They will ask [you]: “Who is thy god?”Answer: “My god from the Absolute Beginning160 isThe god of vigilants and inebriates,161The god of desert and gardens,The god of all gods.The slaves162 [of god] cannot comprehend [Him],[As] He is the creator of people and [of all] substances,He is without essence, without sin;He [has] no smell, no breath,He [has] no passion, no soul!”Seven times for the soul [of the deceased]I would beseech to be pardoned by Him;[May] the mercy of god be equal to thy deeds!163Vardan Voskanian cites two more versions of this prayer, more concise than the first one published by Rudenko.164 The relevant formula of these texts would be as follows:"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"89the yezidi minor deities, saints and holy menYā Dawrēš-a’rd,T’asmīlī ta av a’vd,Birā tu r’uh’ē vī mirī birah’mīnī.O lord of the earth,[We] commit to you this slave [of god],Let your mercy be over the soul of this dead man.The lord of the earth is addressed also in mandatory toasts in his honour, right upon the tomb and during the memorial meal after the funeral. The toasts are given by the “Afterlife brother” of the deceased. The toast on the tomb is as follows: A’šqā Dawrēšē a’rd! Birā Dawrēšē-a’rd řuhē vī mirī birah’mīna! “To the lord of the earth! Let Dawrēšē-a’rd pardon the soul of this deceased!” The toast in the house of the deceased runs: A’šqā nāvē Dawrēšē-a’rd! “In the name of the lord of the earth!” At the ritual memorial meal, toasts are pronounced for Sheikh ‘Adi, Malak-Tāwūs, Šīxālī-Šamsān (see below) and other divinities of Yezidism, the mandatory number of toasts being odd: three or seven. By the records made by Rudenko,165 the first cup is drunk to the Yezidi faith (or in another version, to the soul of the deceased and his parents), the second one to Malak-Tāwūs, the third to the lord of the earth, the fourth to the patron of wayfarers (Šīxālī-Šamsān), the fifth to the lord of the graves (P’īr Mandī-gōrā), the sixth to Sheikh ‘Adi, and the seventh one to the daily bread, to the giver of the daily bread – qadrē řisqā, yē ku řisq dida sāzā. The toast to saints, angels or outstanding personalities is named a’šq (Arab. ‘ašq), while the toast to a person’s health is sālix (sālxīyā ta). There is also a special manner of drinking: standing, glass in both hands, held using six or all fingers.An important function of the lord of the earth is preservation of people’s possessions either hidden or pawned. Yā Dawrēšē-a’rd, tasmīlī ta av āmanata, “O lord of the earth, (I commit) to you this pledge”, is the formula uttered when hiding some object in a secret place. They believe that it will remain intact provided the hider’s clothes do not include the tabooed colour blue.It can thus be seen that the basic competence of Dawrēšē-a’rd is safekeep-ing of entrusted objects within the boundaries of the earth, whether it is a dead body or any object. That may explain the tradition to call for him when planting grain.166 Mircea Eliade formulates a connection between agriculture and the world of the dead:Agriculture is concerned with the world of the dead at two dif-ferent levels, both as a profane activity and as a cult. The former level is chthonic, for only seeds and dead people get into an under-ground dimension. The latter level is managing the fertility, life, which is self-reproductive. That is the domain of agriculture, while the dead are directly involved with the mystery of revival, with the cycle of Creation, with the inexhaustible fertility. Like a seed lying"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion90dormant in earth’s lap, the dead, too, are expecting the return to life in a new form.167As shown by the material, Dawrēšē-a’rd can be described as god of the Earth and of the Underworld at the same time, with all ensuing functions of the deity of fertility and vegetation. Meanwhile he is also accredited with the power of pawn.In this respect Dawrēšē-a’rd can be compared with Ārma(i)ti (Spṇta Ārmaiti), the Old Iranian goddess of cultivated land, vegetation and fertility, having a link with the rite of inhumation, banned in Zoroastrianism.168 She is attested in the Middle Iranian period both in eastern and in western Iranian traditions, among the Persians, the Sogdians and the Sakas. To quote the Bun-dahishn (137, 3–5): Spandārmat xvēš-kārīh parvartārīh dāmān har ēr ī pat dāmān bavandak bē kartan ut-š gētīk zamīk xvēš, “the peculiar work of Spandārmat is the nurture of creatures to make complete all wealth among the creatures, and the material earth belongs to her”.169 And another text has: Spandārmat rōč varz ī zamīk kunēh – “Am Tage Spandārmat sollst du das Feld bestellen”.170 The clas-sical Armenian texts contain two Middle Iranian dialectal variants of this dei-ty’s name: with the initial sp- and s- (going back to the north-western Iranian initial group *sp- and south-western *s-), that is, Spandaramet and Sandaramet respectively. In the Armenian folk-beliefs reflected by Tovma Arcruni, a ninth-century author, we find the saying: Erkir pandoki ē Spandaramet astowcoy, “the earth is the inn of the god Spandaramet”.171 Dawrēšē-a’rd is the unique exam-ple of a chthonic deity of this type, with obvious ancient roots within the whole new west-Iranian area.ŠīxāLī-ŠAMSāN, THE PATRON OF WAYFARERSŠēx A’lī Šams (Šīxālī-Šamsān) is protector of wayfarers, captives, exiles, or all who are in strange lands. He is son of Sheikh Shams, yet being a mythical character who is one of the seven Yezidi saints (the counterpart of Israfil in the group of the seven avatars of Malak-Tāwūs) and traditionally considered a disciple of Sheikh ‘Adi. According to the legend reported by the recognized Armenian Yezidi theologian Sheikh Hasane Kalashe, Sheikh Shams had twelve children – nine sons and three daughters – who are identifiable with the twelve months of the year.According to the legend, Šīxālī-Šamsān got into captivity, was held in a fortress in Sham (Syria) and released two days before the ‘Ayd al-fiṭr holiday, marking the termination of Ramadan. Being joyous at the return of his pupil, Sheikh ‘Adi commanded all the Yezidis to celebrate this day as the holiday of Šīxālī-Šamsān.172 Our informant reported that this holiday is celebrated on the first Wednesday in April. A hymn dedicated to Šīxālī-Šamsān describes this event as follows:"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"91the yezidi minor deities, saints and holy menČāršama sarē nīsānē,Dang balābū ēzdīyē šarqē ū ŠāmēŠīxālī-Šamsā k’aramkir hāta diwānē,Žērā kirin a’ydā qurbānēVakirin daftarā īmānē.173On a Wednesday of the month Nisan [April–May],A rumour moved among the Yezidis of Syria and the EastThat Šīxālī-Šamsān came back to the Divan [“Council” ofSheikh ‘Adi],A sacrificial festival was arranged for him,The Tablets of faith were opened.When having a meal, festive or mournful, they drink to Šīxālī-Šamsān. The toast in his honour is called ašqā Šīxālī-Šamsān. He is addressed particularly before hitting the road, with the following formula: Šīxālī-Šamsān, hara hawārā girtīyē hafsā, nafsē tangā, řēvīyē řīyā, “O Šīxālī-Šamsān, go to help the prisoners, the aggrieved and the wayfarers” (as reported by Sheikh Hasane Mamud). The legendary tomb of Šīxālī-Šamsān is located at Lalish.xATā-JˇōT, THE SPIRIT OF THE FuRROWThe name of the deity (Xatā-ǰōt) means literally “the furrow of the plough”. It is a marginal image, evidence is scarce, except that a piece of the New Year pie is owed to her, and Xatā-ǰōt is almost certainly a female character. The lit-erature makes no references to her; field research has not revealed much: we have not succeeded in recording any addresses, incantations or prayer formu-las. Nonetheless, a genuine imaging of her exists, having its own niche in the religious concepts of the Yezidis. Perhaps, the marginal position of this char-acter can be explained by a secondary role of agriculture in the economic life of the Yezidis, who are mostly cattle breeders.Xatā-ǰōt is commonly assumed to boost the crops and the efficiency of agri-cultural production. Although the furrow in ancient Iran had no direct pro-tector, a “spirit of the fields” has been attested. That is šōiθrapaiti, that later generated amid the Armenians the class of spirits called šahapet vayrac‘ or “spirits of localities”, featuring mostly in the form of snakes.174 A parallel of Xatā-ǰōt under the name of Bobo-dehqon (lit. “old peasant”) is attested among the Tajiks and the Uzbeks. He is mentioned in the formula pronounced when planting: “Let it (be) our hand and the hand of Bobo-dehqon”.175 Meanwhile the Old Indian folk-beliefs contain an exact match of Xatā-ǰōt in the form of a female spirit of the furrow, named Sītā (“Genie der Ackerfurche”), and her favour had to be gained by offerings.176"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion92xudāNE-MāLē, THE SPIRIT OF THE HOuSEHOLdThe name of this character, Xudāne-mālē, can be translated as “Master of the house”. He embodies the welfare of home and the family, supports the family morals, facilitates cattle breeding and crop yield. Xudāne-mālē dwells in the fire-place,177 but sometimes assumes the form of a serpent and crawls out of the house. Therefore, killing domestic snakes is a great sin that can turn off fortune, cause trouble and adversity. This type of attitude to home- dwelling snakes is almost a universal element in nearly all cultures of the East and West, from India to Europe, Asia Minor, including Armenia and the Caucasus area as a whole.178In his habitual image Xudāne-mālē is a human-like creature, sometimes vis-ible to children and those experienced in wizardry. Xudāne-mālē has to be given offerings or mentioned at different rites or religious offerings. Some authors179 call the home spirit Dawlat, which is essentially the same “person-age”.180 A very similar spirit having the same functions resides in the pantheon of the Zazas: Wāyirō čeī or the “Master of the house”.181 The Zaza Wāyir and the Yezidi Xudān are virtually different phonetic reflections of OId Iranian *xwatāwan-. The Zaza čē “house, home” comes from Old Iranian *kata-.Reverence of the fire-place was widely spread in ancient Iran, when, during the Sassanid period, for instance, any home fire was considered to be a holy altar, although it was placed low in the hierarchy of sacred fires. The Avesta names Atar, the god of the fire, as vispanam nmānam nmānō-paitīm,182 meaning “Master of all houses”.183 In all, the spirit protectors of the household and fire-place are common to many cultures – Slavonic peoples (cf. Russian domovye), Armenians, Georgians, the peoples of the North Caucasus, including the Osse-tians, and so on.PIRā-STēř, THE SPIRIT OF THE BEddINGPirā-stēř or Prikī stēř, lit. “the old woman of bedding”, is a unique deity having no clear parallels, at least in the Near Eastern region and in the Caucasus.184 Pirā-stēř is an old woman, invisible to the eye. She is considered protectress of the bedding or stēř (from the OId Iranian *starya-; *star- “make the bed”); she cares about the welfare of home and family. She dwells in the bedding, getting out to roam about the house at night. Therefore, after sunset the Yezidis with-draw the curtain fencing from the bed so that the “Old Woman” can freely move away from her abode. Roaming about the house, Pirā-stēř emits some sounds continually, her talk with other good spirits, for example, such as Xudānē-mālē (see above), and so on. She warns the household of danger (fire, etc.), wakes them up when thieves are in the house, and tries to drive them off by assuming the appearance of a night-time monster. Pirā-stēř is entitled to good treatment and sweets left on the bedding in a special bowl.185"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"93the yezidi minor deities, saints and holy menŠēx MANd OR P’īR MANdī-GōRā, LORd OF GRAVESThis is the son of Malak Faxr ad-din (Farxadīn), brother of Pirā-stēř and prob-ably of Xātūnā-farxā.

In this position he is approached as the one “in charge of the affairs of the dead”, which generally links him with the executor, also visiting the grave as Naka and Mankī, or Niknikīn. Hence the following passage describing Niknikīn’s appearance in the grave:Niknikīn hāt ū hādirī,Čōmāxē dastē wī p’ēt ū āgirī ...Ta ča’v mīnā ča’vē ma’rā,T’ilī – nōt’lānī bērā,Naynuk – nōt’lān k’ērā,Wē nāvē tištakī nāvēžin xudānī xērā.Ta ĉa’v nōt’lāni t’ās,T’ilī – nōt’lānī risās,Naynuk – not’lānī da’s,We nāvē xudānē xērā haq dinās!Ta ĉa’va řa’šin mīnānī faqīr,Šēbiska řa’šin mînānī harīr,Bandē bivīnin dīndār mīr.194Niknikīn came and stood,Staff in his hand, burning coals and fire ...Your eyes are like the eyes of snakes,Your fingers are like spades,Your nails are like knives,This name is hardly fit for lord of goodness.Your eyes resemble drinking cups,Your fingers are like lead,Your nails are like sickles,Is that the just lord of goodness?Your eyes are black as eyes of a fakir,Your hair is black as silk,Let the devout servants perceive the face of god.We are, however, not inclined to identify P’īr Mand with the executor. Contrary to the threatening functions of the latter, the management of the affairs of the dead by P’īr Mand is rather the caretaking for the correct burial to be per-formed, so that the body in the grave should undergo all the necessary rituali-zation that has to maintain the wellbeing of the soul in the underworld.The apparent link of P’īr Mandī-gōrā with chthonic entities – snakes and other creatures of this class – is an unambiguous indication of the domain of death and consequently burial. This character, as evident from his name, is rather master or guard of the tombs and manager of the burial process.

It is to be noted, how-ever, that in all the mentioned traditions, except the Yezidi and the Zaza,195 Xidir-Nabī is regarded as a saint. That is natural, since the orthodox Islamic environment, while recognizing sainthood (by no means canonized), admits no deification of saints.The name Xidir-nabī (-navī) can be translated as Prophet Xidr (Arab. al-Xiḍr, Pers. Xizr, or Xezr). Xidir-nabī is often identified with the Prophet Elijah, which caused the emergence of a character with a double name196 who in essence is the same figure. The double form occurs also in the Yezidi tradi-tion: Xidirnabī-Xidiraylās197 or Xirdaylās. Xidir-nabī, having obvious Muslim roots (a hint at him, perhaps without mentioning his name, being in Qura’n: 18: 59–81), has been shaped as a deity among the Yezidis and the Zazas under the influence of Surb Sargis (St Sergius), a popular saint in the Armenian folk-Christian pantheon embodying both a military principle and the control of storms.198 The saint Xidir-nabī amid the Kurds, having almost the same image as the Yezidi deity, merits the same characteristics.In all, it can be assumed that both Xidir-nabī of the Yezidis and the Zazas’ Xizir are in essence generally reflective of Surb Sargis, yet while bearing his distinctive roles, they have assimilated the universal qualities and functions relevant to other figures of both the pantheons, duplicating them in many aspects (e.g. Xizir is the same Dūzgin in many features). This situation points to a fuzzy type of this image within the popular mind and consequently to its being a secondary figure.Xidir-nabī is one of the sons of Sheikh Shams; he is a celestial warrior in the first place, a rider on a white horse (haspē sīyārē bōz), rushing tirelessly along the mountains and gorges as mērē gāz-gēdūkā, “the man of mountains and gorges”. He is also a patron of the young, the travelling, and those in love; he helps those caught in the tempest, helps to live in plenty and to get people out of a mess. While taking care of a travelling friend or kinsman, it is custom-ary to address Xidir-nabī: Yā Xidir-nabī, tu bēyī hawāra rēvīyā rīyā, “O Xidir-nabī, be a help to the wayfarers!”The Xidir-nabī festival is an important event in the Yezidi calendar. It is celebrated on the first Friday after 13 February, and is preceded by a three-day “lent” (řōžīyē Xidir-nabī).199 Another version occurs on the fourth Wednesday after 16–20 February,200 and here we may note with interest that the Armenian feast of Surb Sargis is celebrated on one of the Saturdays between 18 January and 23 February.Traditionally, on the day of the Yezidi festivities the main beams of the house were painted with flour, the pictures showing figures of cattle, celestial"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion96bodies, people, and so on. There was a teeter mounted in the house, and the members of the family were given a few swings each saying Gunē xwa dāwāšīna, “Shake out your sin”. Incidentally, a ritual rocking at a festival is also noted with the peoples of Central Asia. The Turkmens, to illustrate, believed that tee-tering removes sins accumulated during the year.201 According to L. Šternberg, such ritual swinging derives from “an imitative sexual act with regard to the deity of fertility”.202One day before the festival, young girls baked salted pies, and after eating them did not drink any water for the rest of the day, so as to see their betrothed, the one who would come in their dream to give them water. A bowl with flour made of roasted grains was put on the bedding (stēř) for the night in the belief that Xidir-nabī would notch it with his spear or with the hoof of his horse. On the day prior to the festival and during the festival, young men kindled fires (guřīk, guřguřīk, or t’alālōk), jumping over them and muttering:Ādānā giškā dyā minřā,Ādānā dyā min zēdaba.The milk of all is to my mother,Let my mother have more milk.203On the festive night, during the late meal named pašīv,204 two dishes of food have to be put out in the courtyard. One is a tribute to the souls of the deceased, while the other one is for the Old Man of the late-night meal – Bāpīrē-pāšīv, a Yezidi saint, who when alive had been a righteous man but had no children. It is believed that, after his death, god rewarded him with the capacity to enrich the families who gave alms to him and to the souls of the dead on the eve of the Xidir-nabī festival.205Further, starting with the night of the festivity until the next morning, people visited one another wishing fortune and plenty to the families of neighbours and kinsmen. There was free food and handouts to the beggars. The whole ceremony was named Laylaqadr, which was an exclusively Muslim concept, for at Laylatu l’qadr, the “Night of Greatness”,206 according to Muslim beliefs, the Qur’an was godsent to people, which is commemorated by a great holiday, ‘Īd al-qadr. The night-time visits (šavā Laylaqadr) during the Xidir-nabī holiday are an important occurrence in the religious calendar of the Yezidis, being of primary importance for the destiny of a devotional Yezidi, according to the definition of Sheikh Hasane Sheikh Kalashe.207The description of the festival significantly coincides with the celebration of Surb Sargis by the Armenians, Teařnəndařaǰ (Candlemas), as well as par-tially with the Persian festival Čahār-šambe-sūrī, following the Nowruz (tra-ditional Persian New Year). The motif of a saint leaving a trace on food as a visible sign of his blessing is recurrent in the folk tradition of Iran, not only in reference to Hazrat-e Xezr, but also to Fāteme Zahrā (Fatima, daughter of"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"97the yezidi minor deities, saints and holy menthe Prophet Muhammad), Bībī Hawā (mother of Eve), Bībī Sešambe (Mother-Tuesday, Patroness of Weavers), and so on.208In all, it can be stated that Xidir-nabī is a regional character with a very extensive range of functions, an incomer from the Muslim environment, though having been shaped as a pantheon figure against the Armenian cul-tural and historical background, which is also the case with regard to the figure of Xizir among the Zazas.īBRāHīM-xALīL, GOd’S FRIENdFrom the name of this deity we certainly see the biblical prophet Abraham, who is, like Moses (as stated above), very popular in folk beliefs not only of Muslims but of Christians as well.209 Including Ībrāhīm-Xalīl (xalīl, Arab. “friend”) into the Yezidi pantheon is, of course, quite provisional, for he has neither definitive spheres of influence, nor specific functions in the cultic practice. He is perhaps a deified saint, to be addressed during a meal, a ritual meal in particular. The following prayer is read during the ritual meal after a funeral by the “Brother of the Afterlife” or by the Sheikh of the deceased:Sifrayī ǰalīl –Barak’ata Ībrāhīm-Xalīl!Harčika dāya av tam;Buhušt lē biva miqām,Dōža lē biva h’arām!Nāv dik’re ta,Ālēkī-ma salām!210A splendid meal –[By] the kindness of Ībrāhīm-Xalīl!Who gave this taste [to food],Let paradise be his abode,[While] from hell let him be banished!211In mentioning of you,Peace be with you!During meals on the occasions of offerings, the pans containing the meat of offered animals are to be opened by the “Brother of the Afterlife” of the head of the family or the Sheikh of the family.Sifrayī ǰalīl,Qurbānē Ībrāhīm-Xalīl!Qabūl-maqbūl ba!212"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion98A splendid meal,Let us become an offering to Ībrāhīm-Xalīl!Let [God] accept [this offering]!Ībrāhīm-Xalīl is mentioned in the following prayer of good wishes:...

The head of the family recites the following prayer prior to a meal: Rahmā Ībrāhīm-Xalīl li vē sifra ba, “Let grace of Ībrāhīm-Xalīl be on this cloth”. He is perhaps associated with plentiful food, probably the only sphere tracing the role of the “Friend of God”.JIN-TAYāR, THE LORd OF THE GENIESThis deity is believed to be the Ruler of the jinns (genies, spirits). However, his name means literally “flying jinn” (Arab. ţayyār). He has obvious links with Sheikh Shams: the latter’s shrine in Lalish is believed to be his abode.Jin-tayār is believed to grant cures to the mentally ill: appealing to him is an effective means of exorcizing evil spirits from the possessed, since he is dominating over all invisible entities. Therefore, the mentally ill and those possessed by the spirits are advised to visit the sanctuary of Sheikh Shams.214 The sanctuary of Jin-tayār, in the village of Vache in the Ashtarak region in Armenia, is located in the house of a Sheikh belonging to this family (Šēxē Jin-tayārē). Both Jin-tayār and Māma-řašān are associated with stories of riding a stone or a lion, with a whip, becoming a snake.215 These common fea-tures, probably, explain the fact that the sheikhy Rashan clan (having Māma-xašān as their eponym) is known also as Oǰaxā Jin-tayār (i.e. the family of the lord of the genies). It is believed that this family possesses the capa-bilities to heal the maladies of the soul.216 Jin-tayār is a fuzzy image, lack-ing precise explication within the cult. Perhaps, he is one of the functional manifestations of Sheikh Shams personifying the sun, or Māma-řašān, the thunder-god."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"99the yezidi minor deities, saints and holy menPīRē-LIBINā(N), THE BuILdER-SPIRITPīrē-Libinā(n) literally means “Pir (a spirit or patron) of unfired brick (Arab. laban)”. The religious tradition ascribes to him the building of many sanc-tuaries in Lalish during the times of Sheikh ‘Adi. Pīrē-Libinā(n) is also the patron of the household and matrimonial union. He is alleged to arrange marriages. Therefore, he is addressed to facilitate marriages.217 It is believed that his prayer of intercession for an object of love will always be heard, this being: du’ā-qabūl P’īrē-libnā.218 Pīrē-Libinā(n) is named as an embellishment of a number of deities and saints of Yezidism, like Sheikh ‘Adi, Sultan Ezid, Sheikh Mand, and so on.

Pīrē-Libinā(n) seems to be an image imported from the local cults. In Lalish, he has been nearly forgotten, while the Transcaucasian Yezidis ignore him completely.CONCLuSIONThe material cited above is as inclusive and complete an inventory of divini-ties comprising the Yezidi folk pantheon we can attain. Most of these figures have long been sunk into oblivion; even among the spiritual castes not all of them form sustainable associations. Because of what is now inevitably irregu-lar or vaguely targeted research, some deities and their associated characters had not been known except by name, with many remaining completely uni-dentified. That will explain the great difficulties of reconstructing the total picture of the folk pantheon, which has been herein performed by gleaning scattered data and fragmented materials, using comparative techniques.NOTES 1.

Remember that the Yezidis’ legendary history traces its origin back to the twelfth century ad to Sheikh ‘Adi bin Musafir and his community. Sheikh ‘Adi was the founder of the ‘Adawiyya Sufi order, a part of which, most probably, became the back-bone of the first Yezidi community. The leader himself was deified in the Yezidi tradition. Having no children of his own, Sheikh ‘Adi passed the leadership to his nephew Faxr Abu’l Barakat, and after the latter’s death, the community was led by his son, ‘Adi bin Abi’l-Barakat or ‘Adi II (Guest, Yezidis, 20–21). 48. The deification of Sheikh ‘Adi was a well-nigh determined process. The Sufi orders are characterized by the veneration of their founders and successor-leaders, who, according to the Sufi tradition, have special mystical power (baraka) (see Trimingham, Sufi Orders, 25, 33–4). Worshipping masters’ graves is also a part of the above-mentioned general process, and the case of Sheikh ‘Adi is more than illustrative here: his northern Iraqi sanctuary in Lalish became the centre of Yezidism. 49. As argued in Chapter 2, Malak-Tāwūs (the Peacock Angel) is the very quintessence of the Yezidi religion, its raison d’être. The Peacock Angel, being the incarnation of xwadē himself, simultaneously possesses the characteristics of the Fallen Angel and he has seven avatars: Azrail, Dardail, Israfil, Michail, Jabrail, Shamnail and Turail (see Edmonds, A Pilgrimage to Lalish, 4). 50.

It is interesting that Pir Dawud also figures in Ahl-i Haqq beliefs: he is one of the seven saints or Haft-tan (similar to the seven manifestations of Malak-Tāwūs, the Peacock Angel, in the Yezidi tradition). Moreover, Pir Dawud is some-times associated with Malak-Tāwūs in the Ahl-i Haqq doctrine, and regarded as the incar-nation (mazhar) of Imam Reza – the eighth Shi‘a imam.

Pers. pīr, “old, elder” also means a saint, or else a tomb of a holy man, a place of worship (a mausoleum, sacred tree, etc.). In the language of the Yezidis, the Kurdish dialect of Kurmanji, this term occurs in two forms: with the initial voiceless p- (pīr), meaning “old, elder” (pīrik, “old woman”), and with the aspirated p’- (p’īr) in all other meanings, includ-ing as a caste-name. 126. Both names are izāfa constructions, with -ĕ masculine suffix. Mam is a shortened form of Mahmad (Muḥammad), but Zarzān (or Zarzā) does not have a convincing explanation. The first element of this name (zar-) probably is “gold”, the second (-zān) could be from zāyīn “give birth”, the whole compound meaning “producing gold”. As for šivān “shepherd” (cf. also Pers. šabān, c̈ūpān), it has a well-known etymology (<Old Iranian *fšu-pāna-); gāvān, “shepherd of neat cattle”, is a secondary formation by analogy with šivān, from gā (Pers. gāv) “cow”, with the suffix -vān (<*pāna-). It is hardly an old compound, from *gāwa-pāna-. 127. M.

Still, to complete the religious picture of the Yezidis, it is necessary to consider their pantheistic views, all of them turning out to be reflections of early forms of religion.Now, we have already considered the cultic importance of the peacock and snake, and because these manifest a rather Gnostic/Sufi substrate of Yezidism, we will move on first to examine the place of other animals in the tradition.The chameleon is considered a variety of snake for the Yezidis, and they feel devout fear towards this animal. It is called mārā a’zmān, “The Celestial Snake”. In their belief, the chameleon is born in heavens and then falls down to the earth; nobody has ever seen how this animal eats, drinks or supplies its needs. Moreover, it can mysteriously change its colour.The rooster is considered as a variety of peacock that has been mystically respected in the tradition; using cock’s meat as food, especially for a repre-sentative of the spiritual caste was strictly prohibited. “Either sheikh and a pupil should never eat cock’s meat in honour of Malak-Tāwūs, (as) Tawus (Pea-cock) is one the seven divinities who are the same as him (i.e. seven avatars of Malak-Tāwūs) and he looks like a cock”, as “The Black Scripture” (§24) states (see above in Chapter 2). Yezidis believe that the sunrise is possible only by the call of a rooster; this bird brings happiness, especially to newlyweds – a notion, by the way, that is one of the most widespread among Iranian peoples since ancient times. Some Baluchi tribes consider the rooster as a holy bird, with the eating of its meat forbidden.ANIMALSCHAPTER 5ASPECTS OF NATURE AND CELESTIAL BODIES IN THE YEZIDI TRADITION"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion110A white rooster is as well an angel who protects people, assists in wellbeing of a family, and to kill such a bird is banned. One of the most important char-acteristics of a rooster, mentioned also among the Yezidis, is its apotropaic nature, its presence helping to oust evil spirits and demons.1 In ancient Iran the rooster was believed to be a divine creature, a bird of Sraoša (in the late tradition Srōš) the deity of religious obedience and order.2 According to a Muslim legend, most probably of Iranian origin, a rooster was assigned to have divine attributes. It is believed that the Prophet Muhammad favoured white roosters, held one at his home and personally looked after it. A white cock-angel lives under Allah’s throne in heaven; it calls every morning and cocks from all over the world echo him and announce time of prayer to true believ-ers.3 A Christian legend affirms that the rooster was the first living creature who proclaimed the Nativity of Christ in Bethlehem by a call Christus natus est, and since then all roosters sing all through the Christmas night. In addition, every rooster that will live on earth on the Judgement Day and every metal-lic cock on the spires and towers will sing to notify about Dies Irae (the Day of Wrath) and dire alarms.The remains of white rooster’s cult can be found in the popular beliefs of the Armenians of Isfahan, Iran. They have inherited legends which say that, if a person comes across a white cock somewhere in spinney (or thorny under-growth) at sunset and immediately make the sign of the cross, the cock will turn into a pile of gold and gems.4 Cock artefacts were very important among magic and bewitching accessories in very different traditions, including those of the Armenians: they preferred, however, the black hen – its blood, feathers and beak in a full set – to make up the so-called materia magica.5 It is not incon-ceivable that the image of Malak-Tāwūs as that of a peacock-divinity accumu-lated some elements of the rooster’s cult.Then there is the dog. In ancient Iran, it is the most esteemed creature. In Zoroastrianism and Mithraism the dog was considered to be the second sig-nificant creature after a human being. In the Avestan Vendidad (or Vidēvdāt) a whole chapter is devoted to the dog and its varieties, descriptions of its virtues and of those punishments one will suffer if one kills a dog, harms it or even feeds it badly (chapter 13, esp. §§10–16). The Zoroastrian Book of the Righteous Viraz narrates about arduous trials which people’s souls must suffer if they, during their lifetime, hit or kill a dog, or even begrudge food for shep-herd or sentry dogs.6 In Sassanid Iran it was believed that those who did not like dogs’ barking were doomed to spend their days in foreign lands and be unlucky.7The dog was considered a creature that had a direct link with the under-world. One thinks immediately of the dog as the guard at the underworld gate – of Cerberus in Greek mythology. The participation of dogs in funeral rites is also a kind of locus communis. Most demonstrable in this regard is the Zoroastrian sagdit (sag-dīt, lit. “dog’s look”), when a dog was specially brought to look at the deceased. It was believed that a gazing dog ousts the Drug-nasu,"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"111aspec ts of nature and celestial bodies in the yezidi traditionor cadaveric evil spirit.8 Here we can clearly see the protective nature of the dog, whose mere presence wards off evil sources. Thus, according to the Ira-nian concept, dog and evil are in relations of complementary distribution; in this function the dog in Zoroastrianism assists a rooster. In terms of clas-sification the ancient Iranians considered also foxes and hedgehogs as varie-ties of dog: both had their own place in the complex of Zoroastrian popular beliefs.9Nowadays dog worship among Yezidis does not go beyond the scope of that special attitude this animal enjoys among cattle-breeding peoples in general. Earlier, however, the situation was different. Valuable facts about dog homage can be found in Siyāhet-nāme (“Book of Travels) by Evliya Çelebi, the Turkish traveller and official Ottoman historiographer of the seven-teenth century:[The Yezidis of Sinjar] first give to their children milk of a black dog. If somebody dares to hit a dog, he is mercilessly killed. Each Yezidi holds from five to ten dogs in front of the doors (of his house). Food is first given to a dog, and only then, when the dog is satisfied, they eat themselves. One black dog is sold for 1000 kuruş(es) and ten mules ... Adding of black dog’s hair to the shroud of the deceased is a general tradition [among them] ... In this region they usually arrange great feasts when a black dog is born. And when the dog dies, it [its body] is washed with the sap of [napiform] onion [see also below] and it is buried at a special dog cemetery. For the [peace of the] soul of the dead dog the rest of the dogs are given roasted mutton. The dogs of those people resemble lions indeed. There are no wolves at all in this country. It is strange that the mount Sinjar, known as a blessed land, sheltered such infidels ...10In this short passage, almost all the above elements of the dog cult are clearly marked: dog homage and its top position, its connection with death and funeral rites, and thus its apotropaic nature (also reflected in the fact that its milk is given to a baby, in order to ward off evil spirits), cruel punishment for killing or harming a dog, and so on. Moreover, the colour symbolism is quite obvious here – a black dog has particular religious meaning. The latter can be also seen in the dog worship among the Zaza people (of Central Anatolia). In T. Gilbert’s words, “il adorent un grand chien noir, comme l’image de la Divinité” (i.e. “they” – the Qizilbash, here meaning the Zazas – “worshipped a black dog as the symbol of deity”).11 This could not last, for the loss of the dog cult among the Yezidis was expectedly conditioned by the influence of Islam, in whose teachings the dog is taken as an unclean animal.12The burial of dogs (and cats) at a special cemetery is another ancient reli-gion element, considering first the similar rite in ancient Egypt mentioned"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion112by Herodotus (Hist. II, 66–7). Relics of this tradition are attested also among Armenians. Raffi (or Hakob Melik‘ Hakobian) the Armenian writer of the end of the nineteenth century, notes that when a dog that had served for a long time dies, they advise nra gluxe dřan šemi tak t’aγele oγurov ē, meaning “burying its head under the house threshold will bring luck;”13 and Anatolian Turks used to hang the skull of a wolf above the house threshold for the same reason.14 In some popular legends, on the level of the so-called folk Islam, a black dog is mentioned to be a medium, a creature with evident infernal features, and is sometimes a kind of werewolf that can turn into genies.15 Yezidis as well as Armenians of some regions (those of Mush-Bulanykh, for example) believe that the long dog howl means a forthcoming death, as a dog can supposedly see the angel of death, while for the Karabakh Armenians a night howl of a wolf is considered a good sign.16While it is not an object of worship, it would be remiss if we did not men-tion Yezidi attitudes to the donkey, since, as one of us has argued elsewhere, a misunderstanding arose about it.17 A curious story about traces of donkey-worship among the Yezidis still haunts the thoughts of Kurdologists. The authors of this theory were Jean Przyluski and Basilie Nikitine, the whole idea being formulated by the latter in his 1956 monograph on the Kurds.18On Nikitine’s account, Przyluski once visited a Yezidi sanctuary in a vil-lage called Malatia, where on the walls of a house he saw depictions of a hip-pocephalic creature and a bird, which was identified later as Malak-Tāwūs, the Yezidis’ supreme deity. Later on Przyluski found in the Jaba/Justi dictionary19 a word entry k’arnāmūt, explained as “l’âne ne meurt pas, a feast celebrated by the Kurds on the 20th of March (i.e. ‘Nawruz’)”, and commented on k’ar-nā-mūt, “immortal donkey”. Such data became the basic arguments for le culte de l’âne, the donkey-worshipping tradition allegedly once practised by the Kurds. Przy-luski actually tried to substantiate this theory by tracing etymological par-allels between the ethnonym Kurd and the Sanskrit and Dravidian terms for “ass, donkey”, garda(bha), gadaboī, karuda, kadi, and so on. Nikitine, in his turn, adds the name of a Kurdish mosque near Ushnu in Iran, K’ar-xōrān, as if mean-ing “donkey-eaters”, and alluding by that to a certain reverence towards this useful beast of burden.As a matter of fact, however, the donkey has always been a despised animal among the Kurds, and among the Yezidis – as a terminus comparationis for illogi-cal behaviour and feeble-mindedness. The whole set of conjectures is mere fantasy and a misunderstanding, as we have already explained there is no Yezidi sanctuary outside Lalish, and the depiction of Malak-Tāwūs, even of its name, are strictly taboo. K’arnāmūt is an Armenian borrowing in Kurdish, from Armenian dialectical k’arnamut (literary garnanamut), “the advent of spring”; K’ar-xōrān is a derogatory label given not to the mosque, but to the inhabitants of the village itself; and so on."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"113aspec ts of nature and celestial bodies in the yezidi traditionPLANTSThere is no explicit tree cult in Yezidism such that can be viewed as dendro-latria, despite the existence of a cultic complex connected with the so-called Dārā mirāzā or “the Trees of Desire”. The sacred character of these particular trees does not depend on their sort, but on the place where they grow, their age, shape or any other attributed features. Usually, in late autumn, festivals with some sacrifice (bindārūk) are celebrated under these trees.This kind of tradition has been recorded among many nations of the region, and should be considered more as an element of the cult of “the cosmic chan-nel” (like worship of the holding beam of the house or central pole of the marquee, but with a different interpretation) or connecting the lines of three worlds – underworld, our world and heaven. The cult complex concerned with worship of such trees also involves hanging rags on the branches of a tree in memory of the dead or for the fulfilment of a wish. To clarify, the worship of huge trees like oak, especially the black ones, or that of juniper, as attested among the Zazas in Central Anatolia, is never recorded either among Yezidis or Kurds.20As for the wider world of flora, the most esteemed plant bearing evident cultic significance is the onion (Lat. allium cepa) or pīvāz. The earliest evi-dence of onion worship among the Yezidis can be found in the same passage by Çelebi that discusses the worship of black dog (see above). The Yezidis of Sinjar, he writes,carry onion and jajezil [a sort of cheese with pungent flavouring]. If anybody smashes or squashes onion, his head will be smashed and he will be killed by them. And the most important is that if a rich person dies, he is washed with onion juice and onion is planted on his grave. I asked the captives [Yezidis] several times about it, but never got a straight answer. “Onion is good”, they said. There is a parable. It says that a Yezidi was asked what he would do if he became a king. I would eat onion, he answered. And indeed, Kurds [here: Yezidis] like onion very much.21Leaving aside the gastronomic partiality towards onion, which is tracea-ble among Yezidis and Kurds even now, the cultic significance of this plant cannot be doubted, judging from Çelebi’s information. The fact of killing a human because of an improper ritual handling of this plant directly bespeaks its sacred character and the presence of a certain cultic complex connected with it, an aspect of life unfortunately now no longer mentioned among the Yezidis, but very probably once existing. The washing of a deceased person with onion juice and the planting of onion on the grave is apparently part of this complex, which protected the dead’s soul against dark forces. Together with congener garlic and also parsley, onion is a well-known protective means"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion114against evil spirits. Sion Archimandrite Ter-Manuelian, an Armenian intellec-tual of the beginning of the twentieth century, narrates about Yezidis’ particu-lar passion for onion thatOnion is their whole-hearted love, which they will never change for anything else; this love and worship came to such an extent that it turned into parable. In their words: Az pīvāz na-dixōm, dibēža šak’ar bixō (“I [even] do not eat onion, and [he] says ‘eat sugar’”). Onion is a permanent adornment of Yezidi traditional meal, and its big bunches are always put in the middle of a table.22Garlic and onion often appear as characters of Yezidi tales – as Pīvāz and Sērō.23 One notes also the registered Yezidi tribal name Pīvāzī, with the Armenian family name Pivazyan evidently originating from there.Elements of onion worship can be traced in various traditions. In Egypt, for instance, people celebrate Šām an-nasīm (“the Breath of Breeze”), when from the very morning, they eat onion and dye eggs. The French litterateur Gérard de Nerval documented the direct worship of the onion in Egypt from the second half of the nineteenth century. “Imagine my amazement”, he writes, “when once I entered my (Egyptian) slave’s room and saw a long garland of onions, hang aslant the door, and other onions symmetrically hang over the sofa she sleeps on, and she was making acts of worship”.24Onion is an important part of materia magica, used both in the so-called white and black, harmful magic for bedeviling purposes. In some regions of Persia, in order to make harm or do a bad turn to a neighbour, the onion is pierced with a needle, and then it is pointed towards a definite house and left in this position for a night as sorcery.25 Talishis (traversing the Republic of Azerbaijan and Iran) also believe that an onion tied to the heel relieves tooth-ache.26 The Kurds of Khorasan (northeastern Iran and Central Asia) say that if one eats an onion on Saturday, one will become rich.27 And according to a Zaza tradition, to eat onion on Friday is a serious sin, in fact in Zaza popular beliefs it is even forbidden and considered a grave sin to eat garlic or onion at all.28 Onion has certain ritual and magic significance among Armenians as well.29Another plant having a kind of universal mystical fame and inspiring rev-erential attitude in many traditions, including the Yezidi one, is mandrake (Lat. Mandragora). Mandrake is widely used in folk medicine as antihypertensive and diuretic, as well as to subdue a fever, remove pain, stop bleeding, and so on. But first of all mandrake is considered to be a means of stimulating the desire of lovemaking and it is believed to ensure conception, characteristics inciden-tally reflected in mandrake’s Persian name mehrgyāh, that is, “love plant”. In the Bible (Gen. 30:14-16), it is also mentioned with the same meaning.Mandrake (Grk. μανδραγόρας) is a Mediterranean narcotic plant of the night-shade family (solanaceae) and its tuber-like root resembles a human figure. The Yezidi folk tradition considers it has the colour of human skin. Yezidis believe"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"115aspec ts of nature and celestial bodies in the yezidi traditionthat at night mandrake glitters and its leaves look like silver, but as soon as somebody is approaching it, mandrake hides below the ground. In order to call it out, one should splash some drops of a woman’s urine on it. And when one tries to uproot mandrake, it supposedly shouts so shrilly that the one who digs it up dies at once. In order to avoid death, the soil must first be dug round the root, then a hungry dog or a goat is tied to it. Having moved away to a rea-sonable distance, a person should show food to the hungry animal to coax it to follow him and pull up the plant. The animal is believed to die afterwards.The same procedure is mentioned among different peoples of various regions.30 Armenians call mandrake loštak, mardaxot or manragor, and appar-ently it unites two denotations – Mandragora and Brionia (in Latin). In the Armenian folk tradition, mandrake is considered to be “the king of all plants”, or t‘agawor amen xotic‘. Its obvious sacred meaning among Armenians and its high estimation as real panacea is proved by the existence of a special prayer-praise called Aγot‘k‘ vasn loštakin, the “Prayer to Mandrake”:31You are the king of all the plants!Almighty God created you and endowed you[With talent of] healing of people and nationsFrom all the known illnesses in the name ofInvisible and eternal God,Kind and beneficial CreatorAnd [in the name of] His Apostles,Prophets, martyrs, patriarchs,Hermits, saint virgins,Warriors [for faith] and saint angels,And archangels and the whole heavenly hosts,And all the more so, through the mediation of all-merciful blessed Holy Mother.Be blessed, you, Mandrake!By the power of Almighty, by the spear-hand of Invisible,By powerful hand of Mighty, let all the afflictions disappear,The demons be prostrated, and intrigues come out,And the assemblage of demons be scattered,And the foundations of those evil be ruined,And you be blessedFrom here to eternity.It is recommended to recite this prayer seven times before digging man -drake out.An Armenian legend tells how this plant (loštak) appeared:Once upon a time there was an ostiary-servant (a monk of the very lowest order), Loshtak by name. Constantly oppressed by the"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion116monk he attended upon, once Loshtak poured some lamp oil over the sleeping monk’s beard and set it on fire. The monk awoke in horror and bawled at Loshtak: “Let the earth swallow you up!” and at the same moment Loshtak sank into the ground. But the monk regretfully added: “Be the panacea for all diseases”. However, some time later, suffering from the pain, he again cursed Loshtak, wish-ing that if anyone tried to dig him out, would sink into the ground himself. That’s why people are digging out Loshtak, tying it to a dog’s tale.32There are no other unequivocally sacred plants among the Yezidis.A popular legend tells about a kind of herb in the mountains whose smell makes a person blind. But there is always an antipode growing right next to it, which will bring your eyesight back. Another legend tells about a tree which once grew in the mountains of Sinjar and people used to put a new xarqa over its branches, to make it acquire its particular colour. Now it is believed that these trees are no more to be found, and that “the Kurds cut them all down”.33CELESTIAL BOdIESThe interpretations of natural phenomena in the Yezidi beliefs are as a whole typical for the Near Eastern region, yet some of them are not devoid of interest.34The lunar eclipse is caused by a dragon (or, in some versions, by a big cat) trying to swallow the Orb of night. He will never manage to, but, on the off-chance, just to be sure of evil’s defeat, the dragon should be frightened by a big noise – shoots, shouts, clanging, and so on.35 There is also another expla-nation for this phenomenon. The Brother-Moon is said to be in love with his Sister-Sun. In order to catch her, he covers his face with a veil. But angels snatch the veil off, unmasking the Brother-Moon, thus helping the Sister-Sun escape. Lunar phases, too, have their popular explanation. Brother-Moon, suf-fering from his one-way love, gets old, dies, and relives again. There is even a riddle referring to this: Av kʿiya, ku mahē ǰārākē kāl diva, dimira ū dīsā dizē? “Who (is the one) gets old, dies and is born again each month?” The Yezidis look upon the lunar eclipse as an ill omen threatening epidemic, drought, war and other disasters.Earthquakes, bībalarz (a’rdhažīn), the Yezidis say, happen when the huge red bull carrying the earth moves his ears or wags his tail. According to another version, the bull is constantly disturbed by a fly whirling over his head. When the fly approaches the bull’s eye, he blinks, thus making the earth tremble. The folk-belief says if one day the fly sits on the bull’s belly, he will move from his place, the earth will collapse and Doomsday will come."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"117aspec ts of nature and celestial bodies in the yezidi traditionThe rainbow, or k’askasōr (lit. “green–red”), is the belt of Prophet Solo-mon (Silēman p’ēxambar). If someone ever stands right under it, all his desires will come true. And if someone walks under it, he will change his sex, a man becoming a woman and vice versa. A similar belief exists among Armenians. In newer Armenian tradition the rainbow is also called “green-red” (kanač-karmir), while in the classical version is ciacan, a word of obscure origin.In the Yezidi folk beliefs, thunder and lightning are sent by Mama-rašān, Šēxē-birūskē, or Āba-birūskē, the atmospheric deities of the Yezidi pantheon discussed in Chapter 5. Raining is the will of xwadē himself, with the Prophet Solomon being a mediator in this connection. The latter, being versed in the language of the feathered race, orders the birds to take water from the sea into their beaks and drop it on the earth. That is why raindrops are of differ-ent size, as Yezidi tradition has it. Hail (tayrōk, New Pers. tagarg) is believed to be the punishment of god for sins and various delicts committed by people inhabiting the area involved.The Yezidis, like other peoples of the region, believe that stars appear and die together with men’s birth and death. Everyone has his own star in the sky; when it falls, they say, the person dies at that moment: stayrikā wī ži a’zmānā řižīya, “his star has fallen down”, or stayrikā wī vēsīya, “his star flickered out”. A man’s health, his destiny itself, is directly connected with his star: marī hana stayrā wāna gaša, marī hana stayrā wāna ĉilmisī (i.e. “There are people, who have bright stars, and others, whose stars are flickering”), as a Yezidi proverb says.36 Therefore, during a wedding ceremony the mother of the groom used to hold up her hands to heaven, asking Malak-Tāwūs, the Yezidi supreme deity, to keep the newly-married couple’s stars shining: Yā Malakē Tāwūs, birā stayrē būkē ū zavā gaš bin. And the young girls dancing round, used to address the fol-lowing prayer to the stars:Stayrnō, stayrnō, stayrnē gaš!Ma binhēřin, ma vē šāya,Řahmā wa li sar būk ū zavē.Oh, stars, stars, bright stars!Have a look at us, at our joy,Let your mercy be upon the bride and the bridegroom!An appearance of a star in the daytime is another bad sign, hence the warn-ing: stayrā řōžē bē dītinē, wē sālē diva šař, “If a star is seen in the daytime, a war will start”. A comet, stayrā bi bōĉik, that is, “a star with a tail” (cf. Armen. gisastł, “a hairy star”) is another dreadful phenomenon spelling catastrophes and adversities, and filling people with consternation.There are but very few notions fixed in the Yezidi folk perception of the celestial map.

The Pleiades, as a sign of good fortune, are espe-cially venerated. Thus the saying: Pēwirē f-kē xūyā būn, “Someone’s Pleiades have appeared”, or Pēwirē f-kē hiltēna, “Someone’s Pleiades have risen”.38 This constellation is often mentioned together with Libra, as in the poignant song:Šavē dirēža dāyīPēwir u Mēzīn aʿzmānā būna qāyī,Az miskīn būm harī hāyī.39It is a long night,Pleiades and Libra are set in the sky,[Still] I am unhappy forever.The name of Pleiades in Kurmanji, Pēwir, is one of the lexical archaisms having its Avestan parallel, Paoiriiaēnī, going back to the OId Iranian *parwya-, “first”.40 Aries, which the Yezidis call Barān (= Kurd. Barān, “ram”), appears in the sky late in the evening, when shepherds usually drive their sheep into the fold. This constellation is the symbol of fecundity and simultaneously the protector of Mamē-šivān, the patron deity of small cattle, as well as the latter’s celestial counterpart.41 The spirit of Mamē-šivān is believed to represent the constella-tion of Ram on the earth.NOTES 1.

Such common features can be revealed on differ-ent levels: the mentioned traditions can share both important basic ideas and marginal elements. A part of these parallels simply consists of common ele-ments deriving from Islamic mysticism. The most interesting point here is that in many cases such parallels cannot be the result of mutual influences of these traditions and are rather the common markers of the Near Eastern “her-etic” milieu inherited from earlier, pre-Islamic layers (e.g. elements of long-lasting Gnostic teachings) and/or shared by different non-dogmatic traditions (including Yezidism) as derivatives of that “heretical” milieu.1The extreme Shi‘a sects, generally known as ghulāt (ɣulāt-i šī‘a), are distin-guished, at least formally, by their specific attitude towards ‘Ali, the Fourth Caliph, cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, glorifying him as an object of worship and as of supreme worth.2 Admittedly the pattern of things is complex, for in some of them ‘Ali is a rather marginal figure, even if retain-ing the obvious traits of an epic hero. Among these sects, the largest number of parallels bearing on Yezidism are found with the Ahl-i Haqq (People of the Truth), mainly in the province of Kurdistan, Iran, and in the religion of the Zazas, centred in the uplands of Central Anatolia.Among the main points of comparison, especially between Yezidis and these two groups, is, first and foremost, the religious institution of “Brother and Sister of the Next World”,3 as well as a number of other common charac-ters, such as ‘Ali and Fatima, who are in any case deified by most heterodox Sh‘ites. With regard to the Ahl-i Haqq, one of the sect’s autonymics is Yāresān COMPARABILITIES WITH HETERODOX SHI‘ITE SECTSCHAPTER 6YEZIDI RELIGIOUS SYNCRETISM"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion122or Yārsān (the Iraqi Ahl-i Haqq are commonly named Kakāī),4 while the Yez-idis’ self-denomination is Ēzdīxāna (i.e. “the abode of the Yezidis”). The term Yāresān is perhaps going back to yārestān, “the abode of those in love [with god]”, with the suffix -stān indicating “place”, and yār “beloved”. The forma-tion of these two terms, Ēzdīxāna and Yāres(t)ān, in fact, is based upon one and the same principal concept, the idea of community as the abode (home) of co-religionists (the faithful). Like the Yezidis, the Ahl-i Haqq must have spiritual masters; with the latter these are pirs and dalils from among the hereditary caste of religious leaders or seyyeds, who shape the life of the xāndān, or fami-lies, as spiritual tutors drawing their disciples from among the caste of laymen or murīds. A similar hierarchy, social structure of society, and the institution of spiritual tutorship can be observed in that other comparable heterodox Shi‘ite group, the Alevi Zazas.5Parallels are also traced in the cosmogony of the Ahl-i Haqq and of the Yez-idis: the One God, the primeval Creator initially created a pearl, which con-tained all elements of the universe. In the religious doctrine of the Ahl-i Haqq there are seven images or hafttan, being effectively analogous to the avatars of Malak-Tāwūs in the Yezidi religion. In both cases, they are the seven great angels; particularly visible is the position of the four angels governing the four elements: fire, water, earth and wind. The concept of the seven angels pen-etrated to Yezidism from the combined biblical-Zoroastrian-Muslim axis, And in a very similar form and functional meaning it occurs in the religious beliefs of the Extreme Shi‘a sects in general.6 In Gnostic tradition, too, there is an idea of the Seven Creator Angels, often being associated with the Seven Days of Creation, although this was only one line of interpretation.7Of special interest is the problem of reincarnation. In contemporary Yez-idism the concept of tanāsux (reincarnation, re-embodiment) is somewhat vague; it is present, but not dominating.8 This idea may prima facie seem antagonistic to the tradition of paradise and hell, as the latter rules out the need for reincarnation. In any case, the idea of reincarnation, coexistent with the tradition of paradise and hell, is widespread within the esoteric trends of Islam, in particular, in a number of extreme Shi‘a sects. To illustrate, in Ahl-i Haqq concepts human beings have to pass through a thousand and one rein-carnations (depending upon their deeds in previous incarnations). The Ahl-i Haqq perception of tanāsux clearly illustrates the absence of any antagonism between the idea of reincarnation and that of paradise and hell. The single-shot tanāsux-e malakūtī, they say, is a general eschatological idea, shared by all Muslims, including the “People of the Truth” themselves. Thus, the essence of the eschatology of the Ahl-i Haqq still turns out to be the Last Judgement (sān “review”) as a result of which the Good shall enter paradise, and the wicked shall be annihilated. The successive transmigration of a human being’s soul, called tanāsux-e melkī, lit. “earthly, material reincarnation”, is approached by the sectarians as a means to perfection and purification.9 The Nusayris,"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"123yezidi religious syncretismanother heterodox Shi‘a sect, recognize the reincarnation of men only. A par-allel notion is attested in the Gnostic tradition.10At this point we should note some parallels between the religious practice of the Yezidis and the Ahl-i Haqq and other relevant groups. Both, for instance, keep the three-day “Lent”, unknown to Islam, the Yezidis prior to the birth-day of Sultan Ezid, and the Ahl-i Haqq in honour of Soltān Sohāq. The ritual of community assembly (jam) practised by the Ahl-i Haqq, the Zazas, as well as by other extreme Shi‘a sectarians, most probably existed also in Yezidism at the early stage of its formation, considering not only its mystical roots but the fact that joint community meetings with women admitted is an inalien-able part of esoteric sects.11 Essentially, mystical Islam became the only niche wherein a woman could fulfil herself in a Muslim society, although the Yezidis today have retained only the annual general assembly (jamā‘at) of the com-munity, with women participating. The place of assembly (jamxāna) for Shi‘ite sectarians is sacred; on its threshold everyone had to fall prostrate, and the Yezidis do the same when entering the shrine of Sheikh ‘Adi. During the the ceremony of recollection of Allah (the zikr and samā‘ rituals), the Ahl-i Haqq and a number of other extreme Shi‘a sects prefer the so-called loud zikr. They also make use of a sacred musical instrument, a sort of a tambourine (tambūr), while when performing their religious hymns, the qawwals, the Yezidis use a big tambourine (daf) as well as a flute (šibāb).12Incidentally, it was most probably the admitting of women into their gen-eral assemblies by the sectarians that gave rise to various incriminations against the Extreme Shi‘ites and the Yezidis that they held night-time orgies. Quite naturally this type of alleged conduct was abhorred within the Islamic environment, women being separated from men during the congregational prayers. Even more suspect was the esoterism of Yezidi doctrine itself (and those of other associated communities): they possessed a closed communal character and imposed a severe ban on revealing secrets of their cultus to outsiders. At any rate, the accusations of nightly orgies and even promiscuity amount to a typical manifestation of intolerance toward esoteric sects and all sectarians on the part of the orthodox. Used as a corpus delicti, there is usually one and the same plot with slight variations: the story of a night-time orgy with commonly condemned moral violations and supposed promiscuous con-tacts after extinguishing the light, and so on. Such accusations, however, were completely groundless, as multiple objective authors and researchers have attested.13 Despite categorical denial of the sectarians, mainstream believers have generated derogative stigmas, which have become a leading feature of popular ideas about non-orthodox religious trends in the Near and Middle East in general.14"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion124GNOSTICA, OR GNOSTIC FILAMENTS IN YEzIdISMOf course we should acknowledge that similar incriminations, not completely unlike those against the Shi‘a sects and not always quite groundless, were also levelled in the past against Gnostic sects, whose members were reproached by the Christian Church for violating the human and divine prescripts. Some of the Gnostics’ mysteries stunningly disregarding any taboos, even sexual ones, evidently did not contradict the worldviews held, because the act of copula-tion, for instance, was symbolic of a sacred marriage overcoming isolation and ascertaining unity. The soul, accordingly, had to experience all temptations of evil, to self-actualize all activities, both good and evil. The charge that such cult activity would lead to promiscuity, as described in the apocryphal source The Secret Book of Noria, however, could not dissuade Gnostics from practis-ing in other ways – by self-denial and abstinence, even down to celibacy, as preached in such apocryphal gospels as The Gospel of Thomas and The Gospel according to the Egyptians.15 The divergences over behavioural issues, however, cannot be said to clinch a disunity of views or target settings for different Gnostic sects. Rather, we see the same general attempt in the different ways, some very extravagant, to remove all restrictions holding back the aimed-for ecstatic experience or all interferences preventing the arrival at the condition of mystical unity, light, and consequently, for a Gnostic – the Truth.With regard to religious philosophy more generally, the various, even contrastive, behavioural models of the mystics can be explained as different means of approaching the sacral. Since between the profane and the sacral there is always a gap,16 and the religious experience is based upon the transi-tion between them, that is, upon the attempt to bridge that gap, there appear two ways of accomplishing that transition: either by sanctifying the profane, or inversely, by profanation of the sacral (the way of anti-ascesis). Very indica-tive in this latter case is the philosophy of the Mahasiddhis in India, “the great perfect ones”, who erased the borderline between the sacral and the profane by profaning sacrality in stunning, and therefore, more demonstrable fashion. These eccentric yogins had never observed the accepted standards, opposing their lifestyle to that of the monks and even pious laymen. For the Mahasiddhis the basic line of conduct was the recognition of the fundamental non-duality of reality, or its non-hierarchical structure. More often than not, later religious tradition, on a popular level in particular, can sanctify this type of behaviour as a special way of spiritual development for the select, for the special mem-bers of a spiritual elite. Sanctified in this way, for example, was the saffron colour of clothing of the Buddhist clergy, which had originally been the colour of the lower varnas of the Indian society, even of the pariahs, thus becoming the symbol of submission and renunciation of the conventional values.17Muslim mystics and members of the esoteric sects, while their behavioural profile is not as extreme as found among certain Gnostic libertarians or Indian Mahasiddhis have taken on distinctive aspects. And by the same token, despite"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"125yezidi religious syncretismthe ambiguity surrounding their attitudes and behaviour, and in spite of con-tinuous persecution on the part of official Islam, they have come to acquire considerable popularity in the wider society. Their spiritual authority for a Muslim layman would often exceed the authority of an orthodox clergyman, despite the latter’s strict Shariat observance, for a mystic can trespass many religious prescripts by openly disregarding them or by providing them with a different interpretation (some sectarians, for instance, drinking wine).18 In a way comparable to complicated Gnostic ethics vis-à-vis normative Christianity and its dogmas, Muslim sectaries sit in contradistinction to orthodox Islam. Both have attracted to themselves auras of elite and esoteric status. Moreover, in both cases we are dealing with special members of the communities, with the chosen ones who possess exclusive access to the True Knowledge, and thus with an absolute esoterism. All kinds of ritual assemblies have a related pur-pose – of attaining a mystical unity by the community members, the faithful, who ideally achieve overall communion with the Truth – both in the esoteric sects of Islam and in the Gnostic milieu.It is quite probable that the earlier suspicious attitudes towards the Gnos-tic and Gnosticizing sects was simply later transferred to the esoteric streams in Islam, since many of them clearly showed Gnostic elements or conceptual parallels with Gnosticism. The ethics of both is conditioned by mystical expe-rience, so that some behavioural patterns generated in this spiritual milieu drop out of the set of rules prescribed by the orthodoxy. In both cases there are formal allegations of trespassing upon the public standards, as contended by Epiphanes, the son of libertarian Gnostic Carpocrates, in his composition On Justice (c.150s): “The private character of the laws is cutting and gnawing at the alliance established by the divine law”, for the Creator established the laws “in accordance with His justice, no distinction being made of the femi-nine from the masculine”.19The idea of xwadē (one god) in Yezidism, who had delegated all his func-tions to the triad except perhaps the function of the demiurge (though peri-odically this role is also ascribed to the incarnations of xwadē), is to a certain degree reminiscent of the Gnostics’ image of the demiurge, who had created the world by the lesser god’s assignment. The Yezidi xwadē is also a typical example of a deus otiosis, who, through being the creator of the world, remains completely indifferent to its destiny.20 Is not it also reminiscent of another problem, also related mostly to the Gnostics: “Why did so many people come to deny the value of the world and to attribute its creation to an inferior, blind demiurge?”21 A peculiar feature of Yezidism is that in the tradition xwadē, due to the absence of a strict dogma, comes forth as the supreme god who both acts as blind demiurge himself and transfers his demiurgical functions to the triad, and in both cases xwadē does not interfere with the affairs of the world after its creation.Some images and symbols of Yezidism also find parallels both in the Extreme Shi‘a and the Gnostic traditions. Malak-Tāwūs, the Yezidi supreme"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion126deity combining the divine elements with the features of the fallen angel, is attested also among the Ahl-i Haqq and the Mandaeans.22 One of the conspicu-ous, although tacit, symbols of Yezidism is the serpent,23 which is practically never mentioned explicitly in any Yezidi religious text, oral or written. The only manifestation of this symbol is in the two-metre image of the black ser-pent at the entrance to the shrine of Sheikh ‘Adi in Lalish. Meanwhile, the Sheikhy clan Dārā Mirāzā (in Armenia) has preserved a figure of a dragon ser-pent made of brass as an important relic, although with no detailed explana-tions provided by the relic holders. In this connection it is to be noted that the Mandaeans, too, feature the serpent in the same two forms – as a reptile, head-less and legless, and as great earthly dragon. The serpent as a symbol of life and as an amulet is carved by the Mandaeans above the door of a new house, overhanging the entrance with blue beads (also being amulets) and decora-tions made of clay. A serpent woven of blue cotton is suspended from a conju-gal bed, and there is a design among the Mandaeans that includes a serpent, a scorpion and a lion, although this is most probably of zodiacal significance, keeping in mind interpretations that have been made of the similar Mithraic bas-reliefs.24 In all, however, in the whole region an image of a serpent, some-times paired with a peacock or a dove, is a widespread motif in art.25There is every reason to believe that we deal here with a striking instance of so-called symbol degradation. Before becoming a mere element of decora-tion, the serpent was presented at least as a patron, protector, and amulet. It would be quite reasonable, considering the important function of the serpent in Gnostic knowledge, to suggest that the serpent-amulet is a secondary inter-pretation of the image. In effect, the serpent was originally one of the main symbols of Gnosis and, quite naturally, in most traditions affected by Gnosti-cism this symbol had to be preserved, either in a degraded form (as with the Mandaeans), or in formal representation with no dogmatic context (as among the Yezidis).The Gnostics approached the serpent from the point of view of pneumatic contradiction, underscoring its role in cognition: having tasted from the tree, Adam and Eve acquired the Knowledge, the power beyond the bounds, and turned their faces away from the Creator.26 That destroyed the principle of concealing the Knowledge from Man. The action of the serpent (resp. Malak-Tāwūs with the Yezidis) is viewed in effect as the inception of Gnosis on earth.27Even Jesus could be regarded by the Gnostics as an embodiment of the supreme serpent. In the Gnostic Apocryphon of John Christ presses the man to taste against the commandment by the Chief Archon (II,1 [22]), thus assum-ing some functions of the serpent. In Manichaeism the link of Jesus with the paradisiacal plot is so solid and natural that a new myth is born: the serpent cedes his place to Jesus completely.28 As to the mighty serpent-dragon ‘Ur, on him, according to the Mandaean tradition, rests the physical world: over him are seven firmaments, below him are seven underground worlds of darkness (it is to be noted that Yezidism also deals with as many as fourteen spheres of"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"127yezidi religious syncretismthe world). The serpent-dragon has fiery breath, while his belly is now fire and now ice.29 His mouth is like an absorbing whirlwind; sometimes he is depicted as holding his tail in his mouth. The serpent with his tail in his mouth is the universe in the Gnostic tradition; its dark head is earth and the light-coloured tail is heaven.30The Gnostic image of serpent as one of the elements of the universe is also ambivalent. In the form of the earth-girding dragon of the primeval chaos, he is featured as the principle of evil and darkness, in contrast to light: “The out-ward darkness is a giant dragon, his tail being in his mouth.”31 The same is true with regard to the serpent “as the king of the earth’s worms, with its tail in its mouth”, the serpent who misled the angels and the first Adam.32Another important element enabling parallels to be drawn between the Yezidi religion and some Near Eastern syncretic doctrines, as has been men-tioned above, is the pearl.33 However, the pearl in different hypostases has been manifested in very differing and remote traditions. Prior to degrading down to a mystical-religious symbol, then with a magico-medical attribute, and even-tually as a merely aesthetic and economical form, the pearl carried crucial metaphysical significance as cosmological symbol. Since a pearl is contained in a shell, qua deep symbol, it can become the cause of its own conversion into a cosmological centre, including all the elements of the universe within its substantial, quintessential part.34 The Yezidi cosmogony endows the (white) pearl with this very status, as the quintessence of the universe, coexisting with the divine in eternity, prior to everything else.35 Ahl-i Haqq goes even further. In the Ahl-i Haqq doctrine the sanctity of pearl lies not in its affiliation with any particular symbol. It is sanctified by hierophany directly: in the eternal existence the divine has been enclosed in “the Pearl”.The pearl becomes so polysemantic through the relevant symbolism of water, the moon, of creative femininity, and so on. It is very significant in this respect that, according to the Yezidi tradition, the primeval liquid, the seed that had generated the Yezidi people, had also been created by god out of a pearl.36 In Gnosticism, we find the pearl has another interpretation and is a metaphor for soul. In the so-called Gnostic “plots” the search for the pearl is the search for one’s own lost soul, one’s own true Self, while its acquisition is the contingency of coming back to god.37 For the Yezidi case an interesting point in this regard is their legend that they take origin from the seed of Adam alone, an anthropogonic story traceable to a Gnostic sujet.38 With the Yezidis there is thus a suggestion of a whole people capable of recovering the divine.It becomes increasingly obvious, then, that the Yezidi religion, along with the basic concepts of Islamic mysticism (later transformed within the already closed community), incorporates a number of elements from Gnosticism and of “Oriental mysticism” in the broad sense. Similar elements have also been discovered in other non-orthodox doctrines developed in the same multicul-tural area of northern Mesopotamia, each distinguished for multiple manifes-tations of syncretism."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"par t ii: the yezidis’ pantheon and the syncretic features of their religion128ON SuFI HERITAGE IN YEzIdISMSufi elements in the Yezdi tradition belong to the layer actually rooted in Islamic mysticism. The most obvious elements of Sufi heritage in Yezidism are the figures of two central personages of the latter: Sheikh ‘Adi himself, a once Sufi leader and later a Yezidi saint, and Malak-Tāwūs, whose cult was mainly developed upon the Sufi idea of the apology of Iblis.39But some other specific elements could be also mentioned as connecting to Sufi practice. The particular mystical role of a circle in the Yezidi tradition, for instance, is likely among them. A circle, even an imaginary one, drawn around a Yezidi by anyone, allegedly can not be trespassed unless it is erased (or, if imaginary, deleted, “cancelled”). An interesting description of this phe-nomenon among the Yezidis of Alexandropol (present-day Gyumri, Armenia) is given by George Gurdjieff, a mystic and popular theosophist of the early to mid-twentieth century.I saw a boy who was standing surrounded by children, crying and doing strange movements. The other kids were laughing. I came closer, asked what happened and found out that the crying boy was a Yezidi, that around him they drew a circle, which can not be crossed unless it is erased. The kid was doing his best to go out of the circle, but he failed. I approached and erased a part of the circle, that allowed him to go out.40Leaving aside the veracity of this description, it must be particularly noted that the mysterious attitude towards a circle still occurs among the Yezidis.Another point is Sufi terminology in the Yezidi religious lore, attested pri-marily in early qawls, and requiring special interpretation within the present-day tradition.41 Even the term “Sufi” itself can have opposite connotations depending on the period of the creation of a qawl. For instance, in Qawlē Šēx A’rabagī Ant’ūzī, verse 16 runs very negatively as follows:Tālib, sofi, aw mallana,Aw darawā xangaranā,Rojā āxirātē sarē wān davē dojē, ǰa’nimēvā diǰama.42The Talibs, sufis and mullahs[They are] liars, stupid,On the Doomsday their heads will be thrown to hell.Such a disparaging attitude towards both the Muslim clergy and mystics, how-ever, points to the late origin of this piece of lore, one estimates not earlier than the fifteenth or sixteenth century, when the Yezidi community no longer associated itself with Islam and was then already persecuted in the Muslim"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"129yezidi religious syncretismmilieu as “devil worshipping”. However, even in the late tradition, especially on the popular level, the initially positive attitude towards Sufis persisted and can still be traced. One of the most vivid examples is the popular game, a kind of dicing, in which each side of the cube has its name. Two opposite sides are called diz and sof (i.e. “thief” and “Sufi”), emphasizing thus two opposite qualities – negative and positive. Yet, the latter can be hardly explained by a kind of collective memory of the Sufi roots of the community; most prob-ably, it reflects one of the general trends in the “Oriental world” – showing respect towards dervishes, mystics in general, whose behaviour, be it even contradictory and asocial, is usually sanctified on the popular level in various traditions.43Another case to note is the adaptation of popular Sufi saints to the Yezidi tradition. There are qawls dedicated to the historical personalities, like Husayn al-Hallaj44 or Rabi‘a Adawiya,45 in which the prominent Sufis are approached as righteous Yezidis defending their faith. These qawls can be definitely dated back to the Sufi period of the ‘Adawiyya community, which can be easily proved by a number of Sufi terms that have gained no additional interpreta-tion up to the present days of Yezidi tradition. One of these terms is yār, usu-ally used by the Muslim mystics (both in the Sufi orders and the Extreme Shi‘a sects)46 while addressing each other, and here occurring in the passage when a woman Khaja, asks al-Hallaj Ma žī t’av yār, birāka – “Reckon me among your followers”.47Another relevant example relates the term mast, “drunk”, which has a con-vincing interpretation in the Sufi tradition, particularly in regard to the per-sonality of al-Hallaj. The latter’s “extreme” character was actually opposed to the behaviour of the so-called “sober” mystics. The allusion to this conflict can be also seen in the same Yezidi Qawlē H’usēyīnī H’alāj, where we come across Mastā malōmīnin, meaning “Let us not distress those drunk”.48 There can be little doubt that in the context of al-Hallaj’s story, the term “drunk” could have been referred only to the Sufis, but later in Yezidism it lost its initial meaning and gained no other special one. The term mast is alien to the present-day tradition, it is never used in its figurative sense; in the modern Yezidi lexicon, this word now has the profane and obviously negative connotation of the drunken state.NOTES 1.

The process of this research allows a better determination, as one key result, of Yezidism’s place in the intricate system of Near and Middle Eastern non-dogmatic trends in general.By viewing Yezidi beliefs comparatively vis-à-vis the varieties and deriva-tives of heterodox Islam, as well as Gnostic currents and other “heresies” in the region, multiple parallels have been uncovered both on the level of central ideas and of many filaments both significant and marginal. Some of the com-parabilities had been mentioned before us in various academic publications, especially similar features of religious-social hierarchism or specific feasts, and so on, that the Yezidis share with heterodox Shi‘a sects. Some of these parallels have been further explored in this particular work, including such apparently marginal elements as the dog cult or the idea of tanasux. Only some of these similarities can be explained either by common origin or by mutual influence; many of them simply remain in their earlier impulses and nature-specific shibboleths typical of the Near and Middle Eastern “heretic” milieu, helping to define its constituents but not offering enough clues to historical linguists and historians of religion to settle questions of beginnings or cultic transference.To have carried out this multifaceted analysis of the Yezidis’ beliefs, we nonetheless dare to claim, has enabled us to do some reconstructing of how their syncretic tradition probably crystallized, and more particularly how their special community with its manifestly Sufi backbone could transform into a quite new form of religious identity – incorporating ideas and practices CONCLUSION"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"conclusion134that at first glance appear utterly incompatible.
