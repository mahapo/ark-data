Box 1 392 MECHANICSBURG, PA 17055 \"Just what does the word \"Mezlim\" mean, anyway?\" I've been asked that question a lot, and I'm sure there are many others who just wonder in silence. It comes from the Aramaic version of the Hebrew word Mazel (as in Mazel tovl). It means, literally, \"the influence of the divine\", or \"the sparks emanating from Kether\", the Crown of the Tree of Life. It references the fact that the divine lives in many paths, with each path as unique as the individuals who walk it. Here at MEZLIM, we subscribe to the premise that we are entering a new aeon - a new age - which is bringing and will continue to bring many changes in the way we see ourselves and the world around us. We are dedicated to presenting information, views, images and ideas concerned with our transition into this new world which we are creating. Our editorial policy is androgynous, egalitarian and eclectic, supporting all growth oriented, magickal movements; celebrating the spirituality of the Living Earth! So, in our own way, we are attempting to bring a few \"sparks of the divine\" into the world through our mag-ickal labor of love: Mezlim. A note about this issue: For this issue the editors of Mezlim have kindly allowed foreign hands at the Macintosh.

The Festival move-ment, as it relates to the magickal community, is of recent origin. It brings with it new ideas and roles. The Bard of old was a unifying ele-ment. He or she spoke a language, sang songs, told news and tales understood by most, if not all, of the audience grouped to listen or dance. The role of Bard and the unifying function the Bard performed has been, in large measure, ceded to the Drummer at festivals. mer Festivals bring hundreds of persons with alternative religious and philosophical backgrounds together in an environment of mutual trust and respect. These events are unique in the history of religious and philosophical inquiry where tolerance is often preached and little practiced. The idea that it is possible to trust and learn from an individual who approaches divinity from a perspective which differs from one's own is revolution-ary in a very deep sense. Festivals demonstrate that to respect anoth-er's individuality and personal rela-ionship with divinity can lead o mutual personal unfolding if a profound nature. The Deities and Spirits worshiped by the various esoteric groupings at Festivals differ widely. The tra-ditions that I have encountered at Festivals include Wicca, Esoteric Christianity, Theosophy, Sheya, Druidism, Paganism, Thelema, Voodoo, Gnosticism and a number of eastern disciplines. It is easy to see that at this level of diversity, differences, if not problems, in communication are likely. Symbol systems used to communicate expe-riences often are particular to spe-cific groups or solitary individuals. There is a need for a unify-ing form of expression that tran-scends the intellectual barriers that weigh so heavily upon verbal com-munication; a nonverbal commu-nion open to all who would partake of its magick.

The language of the drum and the hands that move with the drum's head are more universal. There is one major happening that is shared by almost all who attend Festivals. This shared experience; this common ground is the Festival Fire and the lan-guage of the Fire is drumming. Perhaps now is the time to lay the ground-work for the future myths and legends that will grow with this new type of Bard; the Festival Drummer. Festival Drumming is a type of drumming; much like Jazz Drumming or Blues Drumming are types of drumming. As a type of drumming, it has flexible parameters. The important word here is \"flexible.\" The British Bard of old was expected to know three types of songs; a song that could make people laugh, a song that could make people cry, and a song to induce sleep. The Festival Drummer, as Bard, can be expected to know three styles of Festival Drumming. Styles of Festival Drumming There is a definite flow to the type of drumming around the Festival Fire. The manner of drumming changes as early evening passes into late night. Zayin, a drummer who was associated with the E.L.F. Festivals, distinguishes between three separate styles of drumming. The terms Community, Specific, and TVance can be used to describe these three styles. The styles generally follow a time line: Community Drumming first, Specific Drumming second, and TVance Drumming being the third style played. COMMUNITY DRUMMING: Community drumming expresses and invokes the spirit of the Festival com-munity as a whole. This is a drumming usually heard when the fire is first ignited. It is a loud, medium to fast style of drum-ming. There are usual-ly the maximum jnumber of persons (standing and dancing around the Fire dur-ing the time of Community Drumming. Here also there are the largest numbers of drummers playing and a strong underlying beat is necessary in order to keep the rhythms together. The rhythms associated with Community Drumming are straight forward and played in a manner that allows for the greatest diversity of individual pref-erences in drumming. It is not unusual to hear a great number of rhythms layered over a basic 4/4 beat. Community Drumming is a pow-erful expression of the bonds created between individuals at Festivals. In this type of drumming, individual differences are not lost or glossed over. They express themselves freely over the unifying matrix of the underlying beat. This underlying beat can be likened to the trust and respect developed and shared by Festival goers. SPECIFIC DRUMMING: Specific Drumming is a style that draws upon specific rhythms associated iwith one or more esoteric traditions. The Continued on page 44 first sounds of this Specific style are usually"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"When I first heard that the Bard was to be an issue topic in Mezlim, I thought I would have to write something about it. After all, the British Isles are rich in Bardic tra-dition. There must be something I could say about the sub-ject from my per-spective over here. Indeed, since being here I have experi-enced the beauty of listening to a genuine Irish harpist as she sang her stories, enchanting all who listened, in the hall of a major pagan conference. I have heard the minstrels who grace the street of the aid city of York and watched the Morris Dancers practicing their ancient tradi-tures all over the world, not just Britain. It is still actively practiced in Arab countries, American Indians and other tribal communities. It is the modern western world which has to actively remember and recover the story-telling tradition if it is to sur-vive, because the original pur-pose has been usurped by tech-nology. So, where are the Bards in today's western world? Some of the old storytelling practices are revived through re-enactment societies, indi-viduals with historic inter-ests or old family traditions in some rural communities. If one restricts the definition of Bard' to a minstrel or poet, this is the answer. The Bards become a quaint custom from the past, an anachronism :ion. Britain is loaded with tradition of all ;orts, not least of all the remnants of the )ld Bardic tradition. The Druid Orders here help to ceep the old Bardic tradition alive in its original form, or as near to it as can be lone in these times of modem communi-;ation methods. The old Bards were the lews carriers and social commentators of by Jaq D. Hawkins their time. We now have television, radio, hard-nosed journalists and all sorts of opin-ion makers to fill that purpose which has relegated the Bardic tradition to a less immediate position. The old Bards have become story tellers of past legends rather than wandering bringers of current news. Of course the storytelling tradi-tion comes from cul-with enough charm to revive periodically, or a family custom. In the case of Druidic Orders and some Hereditary traditions, there is a deeper purpose. To memorize one's history or magical lessons through song is also part of the Bardic tradition. Still there is the question of the newsbringer and social commentator of the past.

The ancient bards were entrusted with preserving the pagan Celtic or Druidic traditions on into the Christian historical period. Many of our revered legends are noth ing more than veiled references to the old traditions. Gwydion went dis-guised as a bard to the court of Pryderi in hopes of stealing his swine. The Arthurian legends deal 1 much with the pagan Celtic _ theme of sovereignty. And let us not forget THE BARD -Shakespeare... many of his plays are views of the history of his era as well as some pagan themes: \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", \"King John\", \"Hamlet\", King Henry IV and V\", \"Macbeth\", etc. As the colonization of our present country occurred, much of the ancient lore was lost or changed. Some was brought to by Rick Allen our country and the tradition continues in 1 Appalachian lore. The instruments may have changed or improved, but the music remains. Listen to bluegrass and you can still hear medieval roots. Country and folk music still tell stories, perhaps not as elo-quently as our ancestors or as pure, but it still stands as music with a clear message. Some of our modern bards still have the storytelling talent: Bob Dylan - listen to . the story of the \"Hurricane\", Gordon Lightfoot - \"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\". And even now becoming more popular is much of the music from the British Isles, groups like [ Clannad or artists like Loreena McKennitt. The bards of the Middle Ages wrote songs of love, songs of tragedy, songs of valor, and songs of current events, much like some of our modern music. Even rap tells stories of life in the ghetto and the difficulty of survival for the oppressed and underprivileged. Of course, much of modem music has no vital message or meaning. Perhaps it is because our mod-em society wants to be entertained and for-get their troubles.

So, if the mind can be kept preoc-cupied by music, then it is obvious that music has great power to influence - for good or bad. And so, the responsibility of the musician becomes clearer and will become even more clear as you read on. Now, ever since I was a child, music has held a fascination for me. I was raised in a musical household and learned to play guitar early. As 1 grew older, many special times were spent honing my talent on a hillside in the mountains of Colorado, playing to the breeze and listening to the sounds of nature. Of course, during the '60's, music played a key role in the soci-etal upheaval that we all know took place. (warriors go off to battle. In my own ances-ties, etc. I earned enough to keep from starving, slept on park benches, beaches, and sometimes nicer places. But as I sang time and have unfortunately, for the most part, gone the way of the passenger pigeon. Historically, the bard told tales with or without music, keeping the realm informed of current events and teaching e too the Muses made write verse. -Virgil Songs by Dylan and others fueled many a protest and became our anthems. I'm sure we all can remember certain songs that influenced our lives or hold a meaningful place in our memories. As I continued along my path, I started to write songs of my own and perform publicly for the first time. It was then that I started to feel the real power of music and to investigate its uses through the centuries. All cultures have their own musi-cal styles and it is often tied to deity wor-ship, in one form or another. Chants and hymns come to mind immediately when \"religious\" forms of music are mentioned. Of course, the intent is to move the listen-er towards a spiritually receptive mood or open their consciousness to a mystical experience. Anthems have been sung as tral heritage, bagpipes led the troops to war.

What I was discovering was that for some people, my song touched a part of them that needed healing. For some reason, my gift had been given for another purpose than fleeting fame and fortune (although I jstill wouldn't mind playing for the Stones). I discovered that many times, I was able to cheer up the most forlorn person with a song of hopefulness. I remember another jtime a lady who was suicidal because she had broken up with her lover. I sang her a song about finding joy in the depths of sor-row. She gained a new perspective and put away her thoughts of death. As I meditated on these things, I realized that music has several effects that has much to do with our body chemistry. Of course, music is sound, which is energy. This energy reacts with our body's electri-cal system and produces a resulting action or emotion. It seems to be much like a telephone works (particularly if you have a touch-tone phone): a certain set of notes will reach a particular location. In the individual, it is the same: we each have our own \"phone number\" (unlisted?). A partic-ular song or rhythm will connect and enable communication.

In a way, they were historical chroniclers that performed for their living, while serving a vital function. Unfortunately, with the advent of the printing press and even more so with mod-em technology, the vital need of the bard has passed. It is an unfortunate loss. It is obvious to see that much has been lost, per-haps permanently, of our pagan heritage, because the tales are no longer told as they once might have been. But on another note, pun INTENDED, music has other uses that some may not be as knowledgeable of. As I mentioned earlier, I have played guitar and written music for a couple of decades or so.

Now that you know how it all started, you may want to know how things are now. To put it simply, I was playing in the '70s, I was playing in the '80s and I am still playing now, in the '90s. In 1985, I started a band called Thelema which still exists, and we have released two albums, Tantra in 1986 and, eight years later, The Vision and the Voice in 1994. Since the beginning of my involvement in Magick, Magick has been the most important source of inspiration for both my lyrics and my music. Could/should I call myself \"a bard\"? Treccani's Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Italian Language reads: \"bard: the name indicates ancient poets-singers of celtic origin ... it is important to notice that this character is exalted as the poet par excellence.\" I know that the theme of this issue is \"The Bard: Magickal Myths and Legends\", but I want to take the risk of not writing about legends of the past, but instead about celebrating the new genera-tion of bards, the Magickal Bards of today's Magickal Community. \"In case anyone hasn't noticed, we are involved in the creation of a cul-ture\" Kia writes in the \"Sacred Dance\" issue, and I also call your attention to Caliph Hymenaeus Beta's \"Introduction: Culture vs. Cult\" in The Equinox III; 10. It's as simple as that. We are cre-ating a Culture. Not a cult: a Culture. Not a sub-culture / alternative-culture / ecolo-gist-culture / sectional-culture / labelling-culture / theGodsknowwhat-culture: a Culture written with a capital C, so that all the world must acknowledge the fact that the Pagan/W iccan/Magicka 1 etc. lifestyle is an absolute part of this planet's life. And a Culture needs means of communi-cation. Now, it would be easy for me to speak about the media (TV, radio and press) and their attention to the world of music, but the fact is that ART (and music among the other forms of art) is the best medi-10 um to communicate ideas. Remember, the bards were singers as well as poets. The Magical Revival has given birth to a generation of artists whose inspi-ration abides in Magick, and among those artists the musicians are those who have managed to get the public eye, and have been able to spread the information and ideas they wanted people to know. I think of people like Jimmy Page, Dave Tibet, Douglas Pearce, David Bowie, Blood and Roses, Sex Gang Children, Glod, SleepChamber, Non, Ian Read, Psychic TV, Ordo Equitum Solis and so on and on and on and on. The music they play is not important: they all are bards. Keter and the others who recorded Voice of the Sheya are bards; Elie and Friends are bards. \"The poets have always been with us, although we (for our part) have not always fully reciprocated ... the poets know their business and a goodly part of ours.\" (Caliph Hymenaeus Beta in \"Introduction: Culture vs. Cult\") \"Your music ... is the expressione of your own understanding and ecstatic embrace of Law.\" (Lon Milo DuQuette in a Continued on page 43 A: We barcis!"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The power WWW  by KIA word ry.

Then too, there are actors who apply masks in the form of makeup to develop believ-able characters for their audi-ence. Today, each of these seem per-fectly fitting in their setting, yet they whisper relent-lessly of a faraway time and mysterious customs. Mask-wearing is a tradition with roots delving well into the by Patricia Telesco When you think of a mask, what comes immediately to mind? Is it the image of the Lone Ranger, or perhaps children donning masks on Halloween to portray an alternate persona? Is it the superhero of your youth who used a mask to safeguard his or her identity? Or, what about special-ists, such as doctors and dentists, who wear Shamans used masks regularly in ritual, and primitive people wore masks to appease the spirits of nature. All this leaves us wondering about what attracts humankind to this form of masquerade? The answer to this question is many faceted. First, masks are a way to explore the depths of our imagination. Here, for a few moments we can retreat from \"normalcy\" and explore limitless pos-sibilities, quite literally walking a mile in different shoes. From this vantage point we gain unique perspectives into animals, plants and personas. Secondly, masks delivered a visi-ble face for folk heros and even the Gods. The vastness of Divinity was overwhelm-ing to primitive people. To better under-stand this force, they needed to character-ize it in personable forms — images with which they could relate and interact. Thus, medicine men in Africa or the shaman of Nepal might don a mask designed like the face of an appropriate Spirit when effecting H  cures. The hope was •h  to better relate to •  that Force, become • ^^L^^H possessed, and thereby produce miracles. In distant past of our species. The ancient Egyptians, for example, had gold funerary masks that emblemized Divine power and gave the spirit status in the after life. Other similar masks were found at Incan and Aztec burial sites.1 Masks were part of clas-sical Greek and Japanese theaters. 12 both these regions, and many others, the Medicine man is both priest and healer for their people. In this set-ting, the mask serves an alternative func-tion of providing inspiration to the patient. Instead of seeing good, old \"Joe\" before them, who might not inspire any type of emotional response, the mask transformed the individual into a formidable sight. Over time a specific mask repeatedly used could elicit specific responses. Among"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"these fear, relief, and hope are three depending on the situation. Third, masks tap into a primitive side of our nature, expressing fears and hopes in allegorical form. It is this very form that found its way into magic and religious observance. Beginning with paint-ings left by cave dwellers, we see that masks participated readily in imitative magic. As part of the sacred dances to insure a productive hunt,3 people readied masks of the desired beast. They then enacted a mime of sorts where the person embodying the creature gets captured. This magical parody represented the tribe's ambition as an accomplished feat. The idea was to metaphysically affect the creature as portrayed, and therefore have a successful hunting expedition. In this illustration the mask fulfills several important functions religiously and socially. First, it provides the symbolism necessary to empower the magical rite. Second, it visually gives the participants something positive to focus on. Third, it becomes a central figure to rally around, inspiring the hunters before they begin their tasks. Finally, it honored the spirit of the beast being hunted. This last function for masks reflects animistic beliefs among early peo-ples. It is analogous to the Native American tradition of thanking one's food for nourishment. In both instances, the animal became a sacred sacrifice that con-tinued human existence by its gift. Thus, paying homage to the creature through costume or mask was appropriate. A small sampling of masks from the Royal Ontario Museum and MET reveal masks for the harvest, healing, death, sickness, and all the major events marking human existence. So what does all this say to us? Modern propriety often laughs at the use of masks as outmoded, foolish superstition. We giggle at Lois Lane's inability to see Clark Kent for who he really is because of his mask—a simple pair of glasses! We no longer believe that demons tremble in fear at hideous masks, or that decorative masks must accompany us to the grave to insure a better afterlife. Yet, none of us are without a figu-rative mask or two. There are home masks, office masks, social masks and solitary masks that hide, or reveal, what we truly are. Each one has a purpose, a role on the stage of our life; each guise is but one facet of the greater individual. That is the Magic of the mask in whatever form it takes. Webster's New World Dictionary describes a mask as anything that conceals or disguises. While this definition usually pertained to facial coverings, this article covers a slightly broader scope. Masks don't always cover the whole face. Some \"masks\" aren't masks at all, but a form of costume. In either case, however, masks can become a valuable magical tool for many purposes. Here are some examples: A friend of mine created a \"preg-nancy\" mask of her stomach using plaster as a cast. This became a ritual bowl throughout her last trimester, through which she directed loving, healthful magi-cal energy to the child. Herbs, libations and milk were poured therein to share her sacred space with that developing spirit. During labor, her husband broke the mold to help release the baby easily from the !womb, much as old midwives might have opened doors, windows and cupboards. For bad habits, create a paper mache image of the negative characteristic. Wear this image into your sacred space at ithe beginning of a ritual. Then, in conjunction with a spell or prayer for 13 release, remove the image and ritually destroy it; this visually makes that negative energy disappear and thereby reinforces your magic. If you find you're having difficulty adjusting to a specific situation, look through your clothing and jewelry for something easily worn. Magically empower the token for the qualities you perceive necessary to handling that situation. Then, each time you don that item, likewise take-up the personal mind-set necessary to han-dle those circumstances. Allow it to become your prop, makeup and costume temporarily until you return home. Here, this mask should be removed until needed again. For children's rituals, masks can be very educational and fun. Let them cre-ate images of one specific animal, then imitate that creature. Afterward, have a discussion of what it felt like to be that animal and if they learned anything from the experience. Additionally, make note of the different animals children choose. This may be an indication of a specific guiding energy in their lives. Masks give us the opportunity to rediscover the breadth of human imagina-tion. They encourage us to explore all the different aspects of ourselves and our magic in new and creative ways. Through masks, we can find an image of our fears, then face them. We can create a likeness of our God/desses and honor them. Then when the mask comes off, we can be reminded of the Divinity within that gives expression to every facet of our life. 1 The Smithsonian: \"False Faces from Far-Flung Places,\" December 1994, p. 94-2 \"Powers of Healing,\" Time Life Books, Alexandria VA, 1989, pp. 10-13. 3 Oesterly, WOE, DD; \"The Sacred Dance,\" Dance Horizons, Brooklyn NY, 1923."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Religion 1S a way of ufe. ifS what-!to move throu8h life totallvunaware of ever we do and how we live our lives.

In April of 1904, a young occultist visiting Cairo while on his honeymoon received what we today might call a \"chan-nelled communication.\" The occultist was Aleister Crowley, arguably the most bril-liant, and certainly the most misunder-stood, magician of this century - or any other century of recent memory. The com-munication he received was The Book of the Law, equally misunderstood, which was to become the foundation of Crowley's philosophy, religion and rpagickal practice, the origin of that system of thought known as \"Thelema.\" This book, also known as Liber Legis, proclaimed the advent of a New Aeon in human spirituality and presented the spiritual principles designed to guide mankind for the next two thousand years. Thelema has had a pervasive influence on Western culture for the rest of this century, an influence often unnoticed, but nonethe-less powerful. Yet even among Crowley's admirers today, there is considerable dis-agreement and outright misunderstanding of what Thelema means. Nowhere is the problem more acute than in popular esti-ema mation of Thelemic ethical philosophy. The term, \"Thelema,\" is derived from the Greek word for \"will.\" The prima-ry statement to Thelemic thought is well-known to most students of the occult: \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.\"-Liber Legis 1:40 At first glance, this seems to sug-gest that anything goes, that it is proper to follow every whim of the moment, to satis-fy all one's urges at any cost, heedless of courtesy, the rights of others or even of common sense. Critics have complained that Thelema calls for a complete aban-donment of all moral principles; such a philosophy, they feel, condones murder, theft, rape or any other barbarity if one claims that such is one's will. Nothing could be further from the truth. \"Do what thou wilt,\" means none of these things; in fact, it is one of the most austere moral statements ever conceived...and one of the hardest to practice. The unusual form of the language should in itself be a clue that we must think carefully about this phrase. Who is the \"thou\" indicated here? Why does it say, \"shall be\" rather than the more immediate \"is?\" How, for that matter, can any law be based on a pro-gram of \"Do what thou wilt?\" Crowley himself insisted vehemently throughout his long and active life that this statement did not mean, \"Do as you please.\" Careful study of his writings shows that the \"thou\" referred to is not to be under-stood as one's mundane ego, the everyday consciousness with which we normally identify ourselves. Rather the phrase refers to what a Buddhist might call \"the Buddha-nature;\" a Christian might refer to \"Christ-con-sciousness.\" Others might speak of the Higher Self,\" \"the God within\" or \"the Holy Guardian Angel.\" All these dif-ferent forms of expression mean the same thing; in magickal terms, it is our \"True Will\" we are to pursue, not the fickle, momentary whims of the ego. The Thelemic slogan is, surpris-ingly, the exact equivalent to Jesus of Nazareth's statement: \"Nevertheless, not my will, but thine, be done.\"—Luke 22:42 In Thelema, however, the princi-ple is carried a step farther. Instead of sub-duing the ego to an external authority fig-ure, a \"God\" outside of ourselves, who sits above us in the heavens looking down, we are expected to submit our egos to that spark of God that lives within us. We are to identify, not with our egos, but with that inner divinity, knowing that the will of that God is also our own True Will. We are to look for the kingdom of heaven within and follow the deepest intuitions of our !hearts, trusting and believing that what is best within us is true and good. This reliance on the best impulses of our own hearts is truly what Thelema is all about. Furthermore, we are cautioned to trust only that divine consciousness within our-16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"selves, not the opinions of our neighbors, not the dictates of secular law, not the preaching of priests, pastors and prelates, who may, after all, be totally unenlight-ened and merely repeating the prejudices of their own meager egos. We are to apply the touchstone of our own best and highest understanding to any man-made laws, commandments, dogmas, doctrines or moral directives. All else is dross. Obviously, this reliance on such inner guidance will work only for those who are in touch with that spark of divini-ty within themselves. It is equally obvious that relatively few of us have reached such an exalted state of consciousness. This is why the primary statement of Thelema is expressed in the future tense. Only when we have gained the higher consciousness required does \"Do what thou wilt\" become \"the whole of the Law.\" In magick, this event is known as \"Attaining the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.\" A Buddhist would refer to it as \"enlightenment.\" Only the enlight-ened may apply this Law as a present reali-ty. The rest of us struggle toward it, often groping blindly, but trusting that we will one day find that inner source of strength and confidence which will offer sure guid-ance for the choices of our lives. Thelema teaches, in fact, that the ego has no real will of its own, merely whims and automatic processes. The ego is that component of one's psyche that bal-ances unconscious and instinctive drives with the equally unconscious contents of our super-egos, the psychological complex that records all the teachings of our parents, society, church and laws, that tells us what is right and wrong...in accordance with our early programming. Only by diligent effort may we discover our True Wills, the prompting of our inner divinity, buried under all that we have been taught. Then only can we be said to have a free will at all. The true nature of the Law of Thelema is further indicated by the second major slogan of Thelemic philosophy: \"Love is the law, love under will.\" —Liber Legis 1:57 Here, the Law which has already been identified as Will is further identified with Love. Thus, \"Do what thou wilt\" is made equivalent to \"Love.\" The true nature of our inner Law is love—love guid-ed by and subordinated to the will of that which is best within us. This love is not to be confused with mere appetite, with lust, and petty striving for gratification; all this is simply self-aggrandizement. Thelemic love refers to the holiest devotion of which we are capable—divine love of our own divine natures and of the divinity of our fellow men and women. The third slogan expands on this theme: \"Every man and every woman is a star. \"-Liber Legis 1:3 There can hardly be a clearer manifesto of the egalitarian principle. If everyone is a star, we are all equal in our essential natures. True, some may shine more brightly, but all are equally stellar. Each star in the heavens is capable of sup-plying warmth, energy and life; this is a star's love, a love we are called upon to emulate in our dealings with our fellows. In Crowley's Gnostic Mass, the Deacon's exhortation to the sun reads, in part: \"Let thy perpetual radiance heart-en us to continual labor and enjoyment, so that as we are constant partakers of thy bounty, we may, in our particular orbit, give out light and life, sustenance and joy to them that revolve about us...\" Surely, if we give out such valuable 17 commodities as light, life, sustenance and joy, our neighbors will have little reason to complain of our conduct towards them. An important phrase from The Book of the Law, which is often over-looked, is: \"Thou hast no right but to do thy will.\"-Liber Legis 1:42 This expresses the clear under-standing that each and every one of us has a purpose to fulfill in this life. We are expected to devote all our best efforts to discovering and accomplishing that pur-pose. All secondary rights that we may claim as humans derive from the one essential right to do our wills. Nothing else really matters, because unless we are accomplishing our purpose, we are wasting our time. Please note that we are to accomplish our wills, not the wills of our parents, our government, our church, not the will of any other person nor of any human institution. We live only to do our wills. We eat only to sustain our lives so that we may do our wills. We earn our money only so we may bear the expenses of doing our wills. If we marry, we marry to gain companionship and cooperation in the accomplishment of our wills. If we rest or play, it is to refresh ourselves so that we may better do our wills. Nor is this to be understood as a grim self-sacrifice; it is doing our wills that gives all the rest of our lives meaning and joy. And let us not forget that the will we labor at is found in the deepest, most sublime portion of our psyches. In the doing of our wills, neither we nor anyone else should have any occasion for fear—pro-vided it is truly our will that we do. If our will springs from divine love, the doing of it will bring nothing but light, life, love and liberty to us and to our fellow men and women."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"In Thelemic doctrine, all disputes between one human star and another, all animosity, hatred, rancor—all evil in human thought and action arise only when we lose sight of our purpose in being, or when we seekers are still struggling to find our purposes. Between people who are active, productive, creative and motivated solely by love and purpose, there can be no dis-pute. \"Thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that, and no other shall say nay.\" (Liber Legis 1:42,43) For our only right is to do our wills. We have no right to inter-fere with another's will, still less to force him to comply with ours. We do our wills; we do not force someone else to do our wills for us. This cannot be emphasized strongly enough. We have no right but to do our wills! We have no business med-dling with anyone else. Crowley reserved stem warnings for those who would forget this principle. To quote again from The Book of the Law, \"The Word of Sin is Restriction.\" (Liber Legis 1:41) To which Crowley adds the comment (in his essay, \"Duty\"): \"The essence of crime is that it restricts the freedom of the individual out-raged. (Thus, murder restricts his right to live; robbery, his right to enjoy the fruits of his labour; coining, his right to the guaran-tee of the State that he shall barter in security, etc.) It is then the common duty to prevent crime by segregating the crimi-nal, and by the threat of reprisals; also, to teach the criminal that his acts, being ana-lyzed, are contrary to his own True Will. (This may often be accomplished by taking from him the right which he has denied to others; as by outlawing the thief, so that he feels constant anxiety for the safety of his own possessions, removed from the ward of the State.) The rule is quite simple. He who has violated any right declares magi-cally that it does not exist; therefore it no longer does so, for him.\" Surely, we need not stress that these are hardly the words of a man who would promulgate a code of immoral or amoral conduct! How then are we to avoid conflict with others in the pursuit of our True Wills? Again, for Thelemites, The Book of the Law provides valuable guidance: \"For pure will, unassuaged of pur-pose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect.\"-Liber Legis 1:44 When all are attuned to their True Wills, with their purposes unblunted, and are not attached to results, they can-not come into conflict. If a man wills to make music, he need only play his instru-ment; it is not his business to force anyone to listen to him. If he does not play well enough to attract an audience, he need merely practice. If he cannot learn to play at all, he has probably mistaken his will—a true musician will play, without regard to anything but his music. Note that this is not to say that we are not to care about what we are doing. The musician in the example above cares passionately—about his music; this is the pure will, unassuaged of purpose. Whether he play well or ill, it is the music that truly matters, not the applause of his hearers; this is his freedom from the lust of result. If he desires nothing but the applause, he has not found his Will; his fulfillment depends on the will of others to applaud him or not. Thelemic doctrine teaches that all questions of ethics can be resolved on these few principles—provided they are rigorously applied. Meanwhile, in this still imperfect world, we rely on Crowley's statement of 18 the Rights of Man, a document which he called \"Liber OZ.\" To summarize rather than quote, this declaration states that each person has the untrammeled right to live as he pleases, provided only that he allows others the same, equal right. In a free society, only voluntary associations are legitimate, only voluntary participation is ethical. \"The word of Sin is Restriction.\" Victimless crimes are no crimes at all, merely an example of someone meddling into someone else's business—forcing his own will on everybody else. Between con-senting adults, any behavior is ethical and moral, but only if all participants truly and freely consent to participate. Thelemites believe that these principles constitute the only rational stan-dard of ethics possible. They believe that consistent application of these principles would eliminate any possible conflict between one person and another. They believe that these principles are the hope of mankind in the New Aeon that rose upon the world in 1904—the Aeon of Horus, the Divine Child, Crowned and Conquering. We must learn to see our-selves as such children, joyful and inno-cent, playing what games of life we will, giving offense to none, but love to all. Finally, in the words of the Gnostic Mass: \"The LORD bless you. The LORD enlighten your minds and comfort your hearts and sustain your bodies. The LORD bring you to the accom-plishment of your true wills, the Great Work, the Summum Bonum, True Wisdom and Perfect Happiness.\" So mote it be! Love is the law, love under will."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"divine artist by Andrew D.

The temporal manifestation of this Gnosis utilising the name of the Zos Kia Cultus seeks to attain an hypostasis of the Magical Current, a vehicle specialized for the reification of the Inherent Dream. Its votaries meet alone ... in a great company of spirits; its rites are held within secret conclaves that are states of the heart and mind; sometimes amid the thrall of the Astral, sometimes amid the circles of the Adept, and oft-times — unbeknown to all ... in solitude. IV The Current of the Zos and the Kia was transmitted through the work of Zos vel Thanatos, the artist known in the world of men as Austin Osman Spare (AOS, born 1886, died 1956). Its inception partakes of the work of an on-going initiatic lineage, of which Spare was an adept; this being known as the Tradition of the Sabbatic Mysteries. Having no name, but that which Time, Place and Purpose require, the Sabbatic Tradition has passed from hand-to-hand, mind-to-mind, throughout and beyond mortal reckoning of Time. It was from his initiatrix, the Witch-mother Paterson, that Zos vel Thanatos was inducted into the Craft of the Wise, and thus placed his mark within the book of its ancestral vitality. Through his unique skill as an artist he evolved his own recension of Sabbatic lore, the spe-cialized system of sorcery known as the Way of the Zos and the Kia. This sorcerous unification of art and magic establishes the conscious recog-nition of awareness functioning within the field of magical aesthesis. It is this very quality of recognition that marks its singu-lar importance, for it permits the Self-knowledge of artistic genius and thus marks our progression upon the path of incarnat-ing the Primal Dream of the Divine Artist. This Self-knowledge of perceptual evolu-tion and its implicit ethos of creativity has accreted the form of transmission known as the Zos Kia Cultus. This step of attainment was achieved in 1952 through the collaborative work of Zos vel Thanatos and Kenneth Grant; the latter being a Grand Master of the Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis. The Zos Kia Cultus may thus be viewed from an initiatory perspective as a bridge between two ancient streams of occult tradition, the Sabbatic and the Typhonian. Our present purpose within this statement is to clarify the nature of the Zos Kia Cultus, to demonstrate the integration between the atemporal gnosis implicit in the chosen form of its transmission and the temporal work of its votaries as relating to the interaction of the aforementioned ini-tiatic streams. Amidst these words let the reader seek not for the lightning-flash of the Kia, for it strikes wheresoever it desires; it is thus I bid the reader to remember: \"The law of the Kia is its own arbiter, beyond necessita-tion, who can grasp the nameless Kia?... How free it is, it has no need of sovereignty. Without lineage, who dare claim relation-ship.\" The Book of Pleasure, AOS Seek not, for Thou are That which Thou seekest! 20 v The ethos of the Zos Kia Cultus unifies the summit of mysticism with the depth of fetishistic diablerie. Its subtle metaphysical bases are Zos 'the Body con-sidered as a whole' and Kia 'the Absolute of the Other'; these are the Sorcerer and the Out-reach of his Entity to embrace Total Awareness in freedom. The means of reification utilised by its votaries are as diverse and unique as is the nature of genius; and yet given the initiatic context of its origination there are certain magical praxes which identify the mundane working of the Cultus. It is here that one must distinguish between the spe-cialized nature of the Zos Kia Cultus as both a manifest Body of Artist-initiates and as a zone of activity within the range of consciousness through which magical aesthesis is generated. Its essence should be understood without nominalization, its naming is for the self-conscious activity of the initiate within. VI The lineal descent of the Gnosis which has come to be manifest through the Way of the Zos and the Kia traces a path-way back to the very fount of witchblood's origins; for it is said in lore that the Initiatrix of AOS derived her wisdom from the Elder Gods, the Gods that were before the gods of men. This initiatic provenance is true of all forms of Traditional Craft. According to the words of Kenneth Grant the specific lineal stream of the Zos Kia Cultus is informed by an Amerindian magical current. This impetus was transmitted through the tribe of the Naragansett Indians and later surfaced with the Salem Witch-cult. It was from this lat-ter source that Paterson claimed her derivation."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"It is said that she worked within covens of this lineage which were operant within various regions of Great Britain, but oft'times in the South of Wales. (There is here a nominative identity with a lineage which informs the present phase of the Sabbatic Tradition; the line of which I speak derives from Llandeilo in South Wales, this in itself means 'Land of the Devil'. Adjacent to this location is a place called Salem.) These covens achieved con-verse with the transmundane source of their power through the tutelary spirit which has come to be known as Black Eagle. This Spirit was bequeathed to AOS by his witch-mother, and its function is to serve as the point of transference between the Elder Gods and the present initiates of the Cultus. It is the Grand Famulus for the Magical Force which has manifested through the Way of the Zos and the Kia, and carries with it the karmic heredity of its previous mediums. It is therefore that certain initiates of the Cultus Sabbati and O.T.O., have been led, within the present phase of the Tradition, to form cells specif-ically to evoke Black Eagle in their attain-ment of communion with the Elder Gods. It is of note that Black Eagle is represented by AOS as both a personage and, more fre-quently, as a mask; there is here a subtle Here follows a Vision of Black Eagle derived from Frater Dr'ku Aleaos Sottoz: Standing at the Crossroads' heart, the eyes be not open, nor be closed.

In this way, Bards and their travels were like threads which were used to stitch small pieces of fabric together to form a larger cloth. In this way, the old way, common culture was created and peo-ple were united by it. The previous announcement of the theme for this issue, \"The Bard: Magickal Myths and Legends\", called for \"some not-quite-forgotten tale to share around our conceptual bardic circle.\" I have been at many bardic circles and have been entertained by stories, songs, jokes, dances, drums, and just about any other form of creative endeavor of which the human spirit is capable. No one person, no single Bard, was dominant at these circles, but rather each member of the circle con-tributed to the evening and to the spir-it of that event. I have witnessed poems recited by children not yet old enough to be in school and great stories told by some of the oldest among us. It has been both an honor and a privilege to be a participant at such circles. Yet, if all par-ticipate, are all then Bards? I believe that the answer to this question is defi-nitely \"Yes!\" We magical folk are often cul-turally extant from those who surround us. In the United States particularly, we exist j as islands within the popular christian cul-| ture, separated from those who fear us ! simply because we are different. In many ways, it is similar to those long-ago times. However, it is also dissimilar in that we are freer than we have ever been to express ourselves and to share our talent(s) with our greater communities. In addition, we have more resources at our command ... books, magazines, radio, TV, tapes and CDs. Almost anyone can obtain access to these mediums and use them to \"exercise\" their Bardic prerogative(s). And we are a very creative bunch! So, in the spirit of magickal cre-ativity and using this wonderful magazine as my medium, I submit the following to this \"conceptual\" bardic circle: She was tired of living in I\"interesting times.1 The Chinese were right about that one — it certainly was a curse.

Clifton Once upon a time there were three magicians. At least they thought they were magicians, and their names were Mike, Phil, and Teresa. Mike, Phil and Teresa lived in the little frame house on Trinket Street in the city whose name was a real-estate develop-er's lie. Now, obviously some details in this story have been changed because no one tells the whole truth and nothing but the truth in a story about magicians. But it is true that the city's name was a lie, a lie stretching back to the nineteenth century. In the little frame house on Trinket Street, however, the three magi-cians did not worry about the lie because they were more worried about money, or rather, its lack. For Teresa had only the part-time clerical job that had sustained her while she was finishing her degree at the university, while Phil worked for very little money at a struggling advertising agency, and Mike managed a struggling used-book store that was not, shall we say, putting peanut butter on the table for him. Often times he would sleep in the store unless Phil and Teresa let him sleep on their sofa, for he could converse about any-thing and was not a bad cook. Mike was also the first of them to become a magician. He had lived with three or four other magicians in a two-story house that smelled like cats in a part of the city where most of the houses had been replaced by printing companies, warehous-es, auto-repair shops, and nightclubs of changing ethnic complexion. \"If that was I the way that magicians live,\" Teresa had J thought, \"then what's the point?\" But that household had split up, as magickal households so often do, and Mike, as mentioned, ended up sleeping in the back of the bookstore on God Avenue, which is merely a translation of its real name, except for those times when he stayed at Phil and Teresa's house. So the three magicians decided, with some justification, to do a Big Ritual to improve their situations. They pored for days over volumes of forgotten mystic lore, most notably David Conway's Magic; An Occult Primer (New York: E.P. Dutton, 1973). And so they planned their magickal working. As it happens, all three of them tions: a bookstore manager, a secretary, and ian advertising copywriter. | That being the case, clearly a Mercurial ritual was called for, and their books of magick told them all they that needed to know. Well, almost all. They did it on Wednesday, of course, and figured out from the tables of mystic hours that they should begin at something like 9:22 on a bright late-winter morning. Not being a morning person, Teresa was not totally sold on that idea, but it was what the book said to do. On empty stomachs, they dressed in mercurial colors as much as was possible for economically disadvantaged magicians who did not possess great fortunes, noble lineages, faithful manservants, or any of the other helpful accessories owned by the magicians in the novels of Mr. Dennis Wheatley. They anointed their foreheads with the cinnamon-flavored \"Mercury\" oil that Phil had prepared in a pill bottle, and on their heads they placed circular bands of orange construction paper marked with special sigils that had to do with Mercury. And if you know what a \"sigil\" is, then you will understand how this was important magick stuff and not an attempt to look were born with their natal Suns in Gemini, like the Friendly Indians in an elementary-and - for there must be some tmth to this astrology business - they all worked in what could be called \"Geminian\" occupa-school Thanksgiving pageant. In the living room they carried away the table made of plywood and fruit crates and pushed back the other furniture, 28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"which was only an old sofa and some big floor pillows. They made an altar and lit lots and lots of cinnamon-flavored incense sticks. And then they performed the ritual, the one in Latin in Mr. Conway's book, and if you want to know what it sounds like, you may read it there yourself. And they visualized real hard and tried to go to the Qabalistic Sphere of Hod although none of them really could have explained exactly what that was. But the air in the little frame house still seemed sort of sparkling afterwards. Since they were all three Geminis in Gemini-type jobs, they asked for some-thing equally suitable but more lucrative and satisfying in the same line. Phil was still hoping for a better-paying copywriter job; Teresa wanted to work full-time, and Mike asked that the bookstore make more money, since his pay directly depended on what was in the cash register drawers. Afterwards, Teresa had to leave for the office, since she only worked in the afternoons. Mike had a few glasses of wine from the big green jug. Eventually Phil per-suaded him that it would be a good idea to open the bookstore and that he, Phil, would give him a ride up to God Avenue. Phil was still pretty naive about the combination of ceremonial magick and alcohol. That spring their lives did change. When Phil went to apply for a better-paying copywriter job, the universe spun him 90 degrees and he wound up in publishing. The agency that employed Teresa got some fed-eral grant money and promoted her into a [more challenging full-time job. And with warmer weather, the bookstore started doing better still. Its owners fired Mike, whose work habits were too erratic, moved it to a new location and had their best year ever. Phil and Teresa are still together. One evening while they were eating sup-per, the telephone rang. It was an old ^acquaintance from the magick days, calling to tell them that Mike had shot himself to death. They never do rituals in Latin anymore, nor do they think much about what magickal hour it might be. But some-times when spring snows are melting they remember the sparkling air inside the little house on Trinket Street. And they realize how much they do not know. Chas S.

Never mind whether it's in a classroom, at a party, or over din-ner, that urge to broaden horizons - of both the speakee and speaker - presses on one's tongue like a Freudian slip waiting to ... er ... slip. Here's one of my favorites: \"Without lifting your pencil, pen, finger or other pointing device, can you draw four straight, connected lines which pass through all of the circles?\" o o o o o o o o Figuel o Try it before you go any further. If you can't get it right away, then read on before you peek at the solution (which appears at the end of this column). The point is that our thinking, creativity, and very view of the world is constrained by artificial and self-imposed limits. Consider this episode from the life of astronomer Tycho Brahe: While walking home from his laboratory one night, he saw something unusual in the sky. He couldn't quite put his finger on it, but he cnew something wasn't right. Passing some locals on the way, he asked if they saw any-thing different about the night sky. Straight off, they answered, \"Why, yes. There's a new star.\" Amazing though it may seem, an astronomer missed what untrained and uneducated villagers spotted right away. Why? Because he believed so strongly that God's universe was constant and unchanging that his beliefs wouldn't allow him to see the plain truth. Whether it's writer's block, a cre-ative block, or a spiritual block, it's likely that such a barrier lies nowhere else but inside your head. For many ceremonial magicians, this is true of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. All too often, the Tree is simply a diagram on paper. Even when visualizing it in the body of light as in the Middle Pillar Ritual, that page in a book is simply imagined upright. What happens if you take the path from Yesod to Hod, then turn a hard left? The Tree of Life is more than a two-dimensional diagram in a book. Even as a drawing, Tiphareth, for me, always seemed deeper than the other sephiroth. And about that term I just used: Although the word sephirah comes from Hebrew roots meaning \"cipher,\" \"number\" and \"telling,\" the ten stations on the Tree are commonly referred to as \"spheres.\" Not circles (which are flat, two dimensional objects), but three-dimen-sional shapes like globes. Similarly, consider the 22 paths. The Hebrew word for path is netiv. It is an unusual term, distinct from the more com-mon derekh, which designates a public road. By contrast, a netiv is a personal, hid-den path which the individual blazes on his/her own; the road less traveled. At first, a path conjures images of a rustic road or a strip of matted grass... decidedly flat in appearance. This may be why some writers prefer the term \"tunnel,\" which encourages a three-dimensional 32 image. However, a tunnel seems unneces-sarily limited when one considers that a path is open to the sky above. The Cube of Space Early Kabbalists recognized the need to understand the world by conceptu-alizing it beyond two dimensions. The Sepher Yetzirah lays the groundwork for a three-dimensional projection of the 22 sacred letters. According to its plan, the three mother letters M, & and Cf become the X, Y and Z axes (up-down, east-west and north-south) of three-dimensional space (see Figure 2). This triplicity is sig-nificant, because it also corresponds to the three primordial elements (H= air, fi = water, and BT= fire), the threefold name of God (TP), and the three horizontal paths on the Tree of Life (in western esoteric schools, these paths are attributed to the letters 1, £3., and £). While the three Mother Letters represent axes of what magicians might call the Six Cardinal Directions, the remaining 19 letters (and six of the sephiroth) are assigned to three dimensions as the Cube of Space. Although this cube is difficult to illustrate in two dimensions, Figure 3 rep-resents the cube \"unfolded\" on a flat sur-face. If you stood on the square corre-sponding to \"down\" and folded the page up around you, that's what the cube of space looks like, i.e., Figure 3 gives the Cube of"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"n/r man i/tt a/si \"I/O/East Vn rrmj p/'jo p/x J/Ci/North 3/2= -nn B/g/Down D/y Ton 7» n/s 3/)/South j/m.

Some observations: • The attributions of the letters to the Cube follows the order of the Zodiacal signs to which they are attributed: For instance, the side facing east gives Aries, Taurus and Gemini; the side facing south gives Cancer, Leo and Virgo; the side facing west gives Libra, Scorpio and Sagittarius; and the side facing north gives Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces. Note that the order of these signs around each face of the cube correspond to the Hebrew letterS, (the first letter of Genesis) as if stamped on each face of the cube by someone from the outside (gee, who might that be?). • This arrangement of the Cube of Space gives the Cardinal Signs along its top edges, the Fixed Signs along its vertical edges, and the Mutable Signs along its bottom edges. • For each direction, the four signs attrib-uted to that square correspond to three of the four elements, one given twice. The element given twice is the one which corresponds to the cardinal direc-tion: In the east there is Aries and Leo (both A); in the south, Cancer and Scorpio (both V); in the west, Libra and Aquarius (both A); and in the north, Capricorn and Taurus (both V). • Only six of the seven planets in tradi-tional astrology are assigned to the cube. That's because the complex of H/^/rfSho is assigned to the center. • The supernal triad of Kether, Chokmah and Binah is not represented. • The attributions of planets, sephiroth, paths and directions are highly inconsis-tent with the Kabbalah as taught in cere-monial magic(k) ... which may be why it has been neglected by so many. It's easier to ignore what doesn't fit one's system than to revise one's beliefs. Spirituality, like history, is written by the winners. Breaking into Four Dimensions If three dimensions weren't enough, then the ante can always be upped. By now, it should surprise no one that Kabbalistic secrets extend to this dimen-sionality. Indeed, the Cube of Space can be expanded into 4-D space with very interest-ing results. However, since there's no way to make (let alone show) a four dimension-central projection of a 3-D cube into two dimensions. In other words, if you looked dead on into the center of a cube, you'd see the front surface, the back surface, and the edges which connect them. On paper, it looks like a square inside a square. If the central projection of a 3-D cube into 2-D looks like a square within a square, then the central projection of a 4-D hypercube into 3-D looks like a cube with-in a cube. In his television series Cosmos, Carl Sagan described this projection as the three-dimensional shadow of a four-dimen-sional object. Figure 5 gives a general idea of what this 3-D shadow looks like. 7 • /—Z Figure 4 al hypercube, a surrogate is necessary. Consider Figure 4, which is a 33 Figures A four-cube (as mathematicians call it) has 16 vertices and 32 edges. The latter number represents the 32 paths of the Tree of Life. The number 16 represents the primordial alphabet from which other alphabets are believed to be derived. This can be found in the Hebrew alphabet by I combining letters which can be inter-changed (e.g., 1 andfi). Sixteen is also the number of geomantic figures. The four-cube also looks like six truncated pyramids, their apexes forming the interior cube. This calls to mind Enochian magic ... another system where its model (i.e., the tablets) are often treated as flat surfaces even though they have depth; first, perceived as a grid of truncated pyramids, and, second, united into a 3-D cube.

In our three-dimen-j sional continuum, a blade is essentially a or similar long-term working, most ritual occupies a brief point in time. Thus, the fourth dimension is collapsed to a finite point (or duration), during which the entire continuum is ostensibly available to the magician via the principle of \"quod superius, quod infemus\" (as above, so below). Five Dimensions Just as three pairs of letters sym-bolize the three axes or six directions of three dimensional space, the ten sephiroth represent the polarities of five dimensional space. According to the Sepher Yetzirah, these five dimensions are north-south, east-west, up-down, past-future, and good-evil. The first four dimensions agree to the space-time continuum of modern physics. Interestingly, the fifth dimension is moral. This 5-D projection explains why the supernal triad was missing from the Cube of Space, and why Malkuth appeared so incongruously at its center. In fact, these four sephiroth constitute the polarities of the fourth and fifth dimensions: Chokmah and Binah correspond to past-future, while Kether and Malkuth correspond to good-evil. The five-cube contains 32 ver-tices, corresponding to the 32 paths of the Tree of Life. It also has 80 edges. The num-ber 80 refers to JD, the mouth which gener-ates the sephiroth (\"tellings\") and the Kabbalah (\"oral tradition\"). This reinforces the notion that the essence of Kabbalah lies in its speaking and performance: in short, in experience. Lest there be any doubt that the Tree of Life symbolizes five dimensional space, Kaplan writes: \"In general, a knife or cutting blade has one dimension less than the con-j five-dimensional continuum, one would expect a blade to have four dimensions. Such a blade would be a four-dimensional hypercube having 16 apexes. The Midrash states that God's sword has 16 edges, indi-cating that it is indeed a four-dimensional hypercube.\" (Sepher Yetzirah, p. 46) And what does a five-dimensional hypercube look like? Check any book on multidimensional geometry and you'll see a ! drawing like Figure 6. Although this figure is a crude attempt to render a 5-D figure as a 2-D central projection, its similarities to the natural array (Figure 7) and the Tree of Life are very striking. Rotating the perspec-tive on the five-cube produces something even closer. This is especially interesting con-sidering that the Sepher Yetzirah was writ-ten no later than 900 A.D. (and parts may pre-date the Talmudic period), while high-er dimensional geometry was not explicat-ed until the mid 1800s. Once I discovered this five-dimensional representation, I real-ized those wily old Kabbalists were onto something. Never again did the Tree of j Life look flat. exception is Wang's Kabbalistic Tarot (1983), which devotes but a few pages to the subject. A decade later, Townley's The Cube of Space (1993) provided a personal exploration. Finally, Kaplan's Sefer Yetzirah: The Book of Creation (1991) includes an enlightening discussion on the Cube of Space and the five dimensional Tree of Life.

This would have been an interesting analysis, but, alas, it is not touched. 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Another aspect of this book which I personally did not like was the focus on women-as-victims. Greer uses the approach found in Nina Auerbach's book, Woman and the Demon: The Life of a Victorian Myth. The basic context is that women of the Victorian period were locked into four categories - Angel of the House, the woman who is the vital force behind a man but who stays in the background; Old Maid, an heroic figure in exile from soci-ety; Fallen Women, who can only advance through freedom of behaviour which goes against societal norms; and Outcasts, who exchanged \"humiliating dependency for heroic exile in order to remake themselves and the world around them\" (p. 20). Greer locks each of the four women she studies into one of the above categories, victims of the time and the conventions of society. What she doesn't show is how these unique, independent women were, as the title of her book implies, rebels who fought their perhaps unrealized victimization and broke through the categorical myths. Unfortunately, the theme of the long and continuously suffering victim, a popular topic in some feminist and pop psychological literature, pervades this book. This is odd as one of the purposes of being a magician is self-empowerment and the ability to get through and rise above victimization, to be an actor rather than a reactor. Is not one of the purposes of prac-tical magick to improve your own life and the lives of those around you? In my opin-ion, a magician who sees himself or herself as a victim denies his or her own magick. I don't want to imply that this is a bad book, only that I found it very unsatis-fying. I found the historical information on the four women - Moina Mathers, wife of the founder and eventual head of the Order; Maude Gonne, a leader in the movement for freeing Ireland from British rule; Annie Hornimann, wealthy supporter of the arts and the idea of a privately-sup-ported repertory theater; and Florence Farr, unique and original actor, model for Shaw's \"New Woman,\" and head of a GD temple -quite fascinating. Greer did much research, including finding previously unpublished documents, but relies mostly upon previous-ly published biographies. Nowhere else can you find such a collection of material about these women in one place. There are also a few insights into the Golden Dawn, such as Moina's direct admission that sex was discussed in the higher degrees of the Order, although it is unclear if this is mere theory or does have practical, magical applications. A less direct letter from Moina was printed in Howe's The Magicians of the Golden Dawn. As in many other books on the GD, you will also find a great deal of historical information, but here it has a feminist point of view (that could lead into a dis-cussion of the technique of literary criti-cism known as deconstructionism, but I leave that for the reader to examine on his or her own). This feminist viewpoint invites new perspectives on the GD, but because the information is filtered through that atti-tude, it is open to error. For example, she claims that \"astral visioning\" (skrying) is something which is \"scorned by many male magicians who deem it to be a self-indul-gent waste of time: Francis King, for instance, believes skrying can make one an 'astral junky' ...\" (p. 108). I cannot agree with that statement. First, I do not know any male magicians who deem scrying in the spirit vision to be \"a self-indulgent waste of time.\" In fact, most of the magicians I know value it highly. It has also been my expe-I 36 rience that many women have a better nat-ural proclivity for this magical technique (as I wrote in Modem Magick), and men who are not good at it highly respect anyone who is an excellent skryer. Also, to state that King believed that \"skrying can make one an 'astral junky\"1 is totally false. What King was dis-cussing was that a group within the GD which had originally done skrying (and, as a private and secret group within the Order was involved with fraternal political dis-agreements and struggles) shifted from skrying to a form of mediumship which would today be called \"channeling.\" One of the things both the skryers and the later channelers did was try to get new informa-tion from the \"third order\" (the highest level of the GD; members of which are not incarnated). As King writes in The Rites of Modem Occult Magic (p. 127), \" ... the Chiefs of the Amoun Temple [of the GD, by then (circa 1909) known as the Stella Matutina] in London became as addicted to mediumship and astral travel as a drug-addict is to heroin!\" Later he adds that their misinterpretation of GD techniques of astral projection and travel may have been derived from their spiritualistic inter-pretation of the work done by the skrying group (Florence Fart's \"Sphere\" group), \"but they indulged in them to a far greater extent\" (p. 127). Much of the information they obtained, channeled from an \"Arab\" named Ara ben Shemesh, was adopted by Dr. Felkin, who took the information (including such things as changing the tra-ditional color scales with no reason) with him to New Zealand. This certainly brings into question information that comes from those whose training came directly or indi-rectly from the GD in that area. To sum up, contrary to Greer's claim, King was"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"criticizing channeling without checking on the validity of the information thus obtained (contrary to the technique used by the GD), and not skrying. King even claims that a seance was held in the Vault of the Adepti in 1909, something entirely foreign to the system of the GD. Later (p. 244), Greer even admits that there were problems with the Sphere Group. \"Annie [Homimann] saw the prob-lem [keeping accurate records of admissions, examinations and members] as an evasion of laws and precedents,' which she blamed on the existence of secret groups within the Order, especially the Sphere Group.\" Greer also focuses on the idea that members of the GD would choose their magical mottos as the result of close exami-nation of personal desires and goals. In fact, many of the members simply looked up family mottos from a resource book and used those. When Mathers determined that originally his surname should have been MacGregor, he took the motto of the clan MacGregor as his own (\" 'S Rioghail Mo Dhream\"). Greer's statement (p. 160) that Thomas Lake Harris developed Karezza, is also in error, although her description of Karezza, \"a trance state induced by a kind of yogic breath-control during sexual inter-course, in which the participants, sitting face to face, withheld both movement and physical orgasm,\" is correct. In fact, Harris (according to Catherine Yronwode's arti-cle, \"Tantra, Male Continence and Karezza\" as posted on the internet) \"did not practice Karezza by that name nor did he practice it in form. He, like many oth-ers, followed the lead of Henry Noyes of the Oneida Community and practiced Male Continence.' In this tantra-like sex-ual system, female orgasms are allowed and encouraged.\" Karezza should be traced to a woman named Alice Bunker Stockham. She was a gynecologist and revolutionary interested in women's suffrage, birth con-trol, prohibition of alcohol, rehabilitation of prostitutes and eugenics. She \"invented, named and taught Karezza, based in part on Noyes' Male Continence and in part on Hindu tantra yoga, which she had also studied in India but with one difference -she asked that her female followers also abstain from orgasm.\" Ms. Greer seems to have some problem with Aleister Crowley. As a result of the infamous incident in which he tried to take over the London Temple for Mathers when the Order was trying to lib-erate itself from Mathers' growing dictator-ial attitude, he is described as Mathers' \"henchman\" (p. 245). The choice of this word and its negative baggage seem to indicate her negative attitude toward Crowley. She could have just as easily described him as \"loyal to the man who was the head of the Order to which he had dedicated himself and proud to function as his leader's representative.\" In the same paragraph she described how Crowley shortly thereafter went to New York and true is that they were referring to the still occurring (and false) belief in international conspiracies between Jews and Freemasons to take over the world. It was described in the infamous Protocols of the Learned Elders of Z ion. Later, a former head of a GD tem-ple (who had been pushed through the degrees so that others could use her natur-al, mediumistic abilities) denied the Order and revealed her twisted interpretation of them and the \"conspiracy\" as \"Inquire Within,\" author of Lightbearers of Darkness and Trail of the Serpent. This type of fool-ishness goes on today as you can hear if you listen to so-called \"Christian\" radio and television, and especially the teachings of Pat Robertson who adds Trilateralists and others to the conspiracy brew. In short, it was a statement of paranoia and anti-semitism, something which Greer seems to want to deny. Near the beginning of this article I described the fact that I disliked the \"women as victims\" attitude which I feel pervades the book. On page 377 she writes, quoting Gerda Lerner in The Creation of Patriarchy, '\"It is only through the discov-ery and acknowledgement of their roots, then Mexico. She claimed that \"Everyone their past, their history, that women, like sighed with relief\" because Crowley had removed himself from the picture. In such a well-documented book I am surprised that she offers no proof for this defamatory statement. On page 246 Ms. Greer claims that Maude Gonne's sister (as well as Maude) were not satisfied with the GD because of its Masonic basis and \"conspira-cies of wealth and power with 'Semitic' (meaning Kabbalistic) tendencies.\" Again, she offers no proof of the idea that Semitic means Kabbalistic. In fact, what is probably 37 other groups, become enabled to project an alternate future.1\" I cannot agree with this. True, there are many therapists who claim that by focusing on history and our person-al past we (both men and women) are able to create a better future. In fact, merely focusing on the past and personal and soci-etal victimhood, we stay victims. This was fully described in the book, Return of the Furies by Wakefield and Underwager (1994. Open Court, Peru, Illinois). The real problem in my opinion, is that these therapists do not go on to the logical next step and ask, \"Okay, you were"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"a victim. Now what do you do? How do you stop being a victim?\" and then help their clients move away from victimhood into freedom. Focus on something and you create it - this is a corollary of magick. Of one and presents a possible future which is inclusive rather than exclusive. But instead of a forward attitude, she makes some of this book a political assault. \"Over the next two years Pixie course, if these therapists keep their clients [Pamela Colman Smith] was to paint... as victims, the clients will keep returning for more \"therapy.\" However, to claim that these so-called therapists are just greedy bottom-dwellers may be overstating the facts (at least in some cases). Greer correctly says that \"The story of the Golden Dawn and its women has been preserved primarily by men.\" She adds, \"I have made a deliberate effort to look for and present ideas and events from the women's point of view. This shift has led to new perspectives, new possibilities, that are both personal and political\" (emphasis added). Here we come to the crux of the problem with this book - it is not about the Golden Dawn or even about the Women of the Golden Dawn and their she painted. But what about the person(s [what] would become the world's most popular Tarot deck, the Rider-Waite Tarot, or, as is more correctly called by feminists today, the Smith-Waite deck\" (p. 318). It has been a time-held tradition that employers, rightly or wrongly, take credit for the work of their artisans, male or female. You don't see the name of every-one who designed, created parts and built a car, you merely see the name of the compa-ny which employs them. The names of men and women who painted in the styles of the more famous artists they worked for have been lost over time, their works being listed as \"from the school\" of the famous artist. Smith deserves credit for the cards amazing contributions to occultism and society. Rather, it is a political document intended to present a particular view of feminism. It is true that the male historians of the GD tended to ignore the women who played such vital roles in the Order and in society. Their sexism discounted the who created the necessary \"separations\" which allowed them to be printed? Why doesn't he/she/they get credit, too? And while it may be true that some feminists refer to it as the Smith-Waite deck, she gives no proof for her claim. Greer even goes so far as to deny Waite's involvement with the major origi-nal aspect of the deck. \" ... [T]he Minor Arcana number-cards are original works that were only loosely imagined by Waite if at all\" (p. 406, emphasis in original). Her women's roles and made them invisible. But Greer doesn't merely ignore the men She describes them either as weaklings controlled by passions or as bullies who need to dominate others, especially \"proof' for this claim is two-fold. On page women. Personally, I find this view of men 457 is a statement that in one earlier deck, as offensive as the sexism of the male ! of which there is a copy in the British authors. It is a view which is both anti-male Museum, there are a few cards of the and dated. For a more advanced version of a Minor Arcana which, unlike other decks freedom-oriented philosophy of honor and | until the Rider-Waite deck, had pictures respect for all I suggest the book, The Dialectic of Sex by Shulamith Firestone. It focuses on liberation and freedom for every-I ! on them. Greer ignores the fact that Waite was a scholar (although a very pedantic one) and would have frequently visited the British Museum. My guess, therefore, is that Waite found the pictures of the cards and showed them to Smith. My proof, which admittedly is not strong, is that Waite writes (in The Pictorial Key to the Tarot), in his description of the two of cups, that the Caduceus and lion's head is \"a variant of a sign which is found in a few old examples of this card.\" So chances are the designs were by Waite and the fulfill-ment of the designs were by Smith. For this she should receive due credit, just as Lady Harris should receive full credit for brilliantly realizing the designs of Crowley for the Thoth deck. Greer's second proof that Waite may have had little to do with the design of many of the cards, especially the Minor Arcana, comes from her quote from Rachel Pollack's \"... second volume of Seventy-Eight Degrees of Wisdom, [where she writes that] many of Smith's cards do not follow the descriptions given in Waite's book on the Tarot.\" This is not true; the descrip-tions match entirely. However, some of his interpretations do not seem to match some of the illustrations. He does write, howev-er, that his interpretations are only \"inti-mations,\" and that people with psychic ability will create their own meanings based on the images. Could Waite have been con-sciously deceptive and misleading? My contention is that he was. In the introduc-tion to the Pictorial Key he writes about the meanings of the cards, saying that, \" ... they are the truth so far as they go. \"It is regrettable in several respects that I must confess to certain reservations, but there is a question of hon-our here ...

That is why he says he did not include the Hebrew attributions on the cards: others who had done so had \"nearly every attribution ... wrong.\" This, of course, implies that he must have known the correct ones, the ones used by the Golden Dawn, the ones on the deck which he must have used within the GD. Like a dedicated member of any magickal order, he refused to reveal the meanings to the uninitiate. There are errors in this book which are compounded by an admitted political agenda and a fruitless, ex post facto attempt to prove the accuracy of astrology. But in no other single source can you find such a collection of information about the lives of four important GD most occultists unless they are collectors of anything to do with the Golden Dawn. They, like myself, will find this book -even with all its problems - a necessity. THE CELESTIAL BAR A Spiritual Journey 'Tom Youngholm 'Delacorte Press ISBN: 0-385-31548-1 Reviewed by Robert Ross \"Throughout most of my life, during the challenging and even the happier times, I felt that something was missing. I didn't know what it was, just that I didn't have it\" says Tom Youngholm, the author of The Celestial Bar. A few years ago, Tom Youngholm jwas meditating. In his words, \"it was a very jdeep meditation\". He felt a hand gently women. It is hoped that in the future some |rockmg him and he made conracr wjth what he calls his spirit guides. \"For thirty of the other, lesser-known women of the GD will also be investigated. Perhaps the most interesting of the other women was the author Fiona Mcleod. Her writings are said to be totally from a woman's point of view, and yet she was not an incarnate woman but an entity who at times took possession of the body of a man, literary journalist William Sharp. Some feminists will find this book interesting.

In this book, Mr. Youngholm's alter ego, Johnathan \"Digger\" Taylor is a forty something would-be composer whose !book 15 an eni°Vable read- and reminds us life has been a series of failures and broken of that search for balance that needs our relationships. He's stalked by an ongoing nightmare that affects his dreaming and waking state. Digger is searching for some-thing that will not only lessen the sense of foreboding that he has in life, but will also motion picture. He's invited to an audi-tion, arriving early and exhausted, he takes a nap in the studio's dressing room. Soon, in his dreams, Digger Taylor is again being pursued by the foreboding force which has been stalking him for years. In his attempt to escape the force, he enters a fictional bar (as in drinking establishment) called the Celestial Bar. In this cosmic tavern, \"Digger\" meets some :very unusual people; Ahmay, a Shoshone imedium who acts as his spiritual guide; Paula, who he recognizes as the love of his life and soulmate; and Ramda, an interac-tive computer who adds new meaning to the term \"virtual reality\". All of these char-acters assist him in putting his life back on track and discovering PEIS - physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual bal-ance. Five minutes before Digger's audi-tion is to begin, he's awakened by the stage manager. Of course, he's not the same per-son who went to sleep an hour earlier. Digger auditions of course, and ... well, it's worth reading the book just to read about 'the experience of the audition.

In addition, 'the production schedule for this issue falls for an answer. They persisted in their attentions, even to the point of approach-ing her at her job. Finally, she became so disenchanted that she withdrew from the community entirely. Hearing her story, I found myself wondering how people who call themselves around Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New ,7 • r n • i i \"pagan\" could justify such behavior. We are Year; a time tor reflection on the past and setting of clear paths for the future. This is a season to reflect on the path that has brought each of us the present moment, and which will carry us onward from the here and now. This is a time to consider the quality of that path; how we can jimprove it, how we can clarify it, so that we - and others - can understand it more fully. Recently I performed a handfast-ing for a NeoPagan couple. While sitting at the reception afterwards, I was approached by a woman with a question that speaks directly to the issue of healthy boundaries and to our goals for the magick-al/pagan community as a whole. The question she asked was essen-jtially: Can you be monogamous and still be j Pagan? She had become active in her local icommunity about a year ago, and, being an attractive woman, had received a lot of attention from both men and women who wanted to engage her sexually. All well and good - so far. The difficulty came when many of them would not take \"no\" supposedly tolerant and supportive of other [people's beliefs and values, even when we don't happen to share them ourselves. Are there people in our community who feel that each individual is not entitled to place Hlr boundaries where they choose - includ-ing the choice to be more exclusive in their choice of sexual partners? Apparently so. And this saddens me. This can by no imeans be an isolated incident, and if this is jthe image we present to new people seek-ing to enter our community, what sort of long term goals can we hope to achieve? Personally, I believe there can be no real positive growth in our extended Magickal Family until this issue is addressed and dealt with in a clear and decisive manner. I invite your response.

I feel stark terror. I want to vacate the car NOW! It doesn't matter that I am one hundred feet up and still climbing. I want out - NOW! Yet, deep within I really want to do this and I know 1 will enjoy the ride. But for that eternally long moment near the summit of the tallest hill - I want out! That's what my life feels like. I have worked long and hard climbing my personal mountain (no insignificant little hill!). But now I no longer see the path going up. It seems to drop right out from under me. In the distance, I see other parts of the track but immediately in front -nothing. I can not stop my forward progress and there is no way to get out, at least not without significant personal harm. So, I must go forward. Arrrghhh!!!! The next step in my magickal growth felt like this a couple of months ago. I went over the top of the hill and down the other side. I did enjoy the ride -eventually. But the sheer terror of that first step into the unknown remains etched in my memory. In magickal, spiritual growth many steps build one's path. No, not all of them involve the emotional turmoil I describe. Sometimes the next step follows the previous easily, effortlessly. Sigh... But usually our egos and attitudes fight and struggle every inch of the way as we strive to unfold. Next steps occur at forks in our paths as well as at emotionally laden events - births, weddings, funerals. Or any other thing that triggers a response deep within the psyche. You know - another fucking growth opportunity. Yep, the next step on your path in disguise. It is how we choose to respond to these events that directs our path. The one ironic and universal truth to choosing mag-ick or any other spiritual growth discipline is once started you cannot go back. Sure, you might stop practicing, doing rituals or keeping your journal. But you already set the process in motion. You will never be the same. Remember - this is GOOD! Overcoming the fear of change ranks up there as one of the biggest lessons to learn. Most of us use the rest of our lives perfect-ing that one! In fact, this basic fear lies at the root of all our quandaries in taking the next step. Instead of using my magickal tools to ease my journey down my mountain (that I had carefully constructed from a mole hill), I conjured visions of failure and \"what ifs\". What if I fail? What if no one ever likes me again? What if I really haven't grown? What if I'm not really a magickian? Fear. The one constant it seems in this thing called life is our battle with fear. Strangely, I have found if I name it and look at it, the feelings of terror evaporate like mist. And I take the next step, with-out having to go down the roller coaster. Of course if you like roller coasters - be my guest! A baby learns to walk. First taking one unsteady step, then another. After much practice, the infant learns that if the body leans forward the feet must follow or kerplunk! I've seen teetering toddlers lead-ing adults a merry chase using this I 42 method. Lean forward, get gravity going, build momentum and the feet must follow - faster and faster. Of course, until control is learned, a few tumbles are inevitable. Path walking and step taking become more like this process when fears are quickly dealt with. Yes, it is a learning process. But it doesn't need to be nearly as painful as we make it. Which is another point to keep firmly in mind. We are mag-ickians even when we do not chose to acknowledge it. WE create our realities -pain, roller coasters and all. So next time another growth opportunity comes your way, ask yourself why you have chosen to experience this. Maybe you cannot yet accept the fact you created the event. Accept this fact, so that you can choose how to respond. I am learning that first I must allow myself to feel any emotion that comes up. I do not need to act on them, just feel and acknowledge. Then, after the emotions subside, I chose how to respond. Step tak-ing becomes easier and more rewarding. At this time I feel I'm at a cross-roads in my path. I see many different directions in which to go. But I feel con-fused as to which way to go. Actually, it isn't a fork in the road - it's an octopus. How can I take my next step, confidently? First I need to take my own advice and journal. What patterns do I see? Is there a pattern of fears I need to confront? I also need to list all my options and the benefits and drawbacks of each. Then lis-ten, really listen to my inner self. Are there little screams of fear and doubt I am ignor-ing? What are my emotions? Am I allowing myself to experience them fully or am I stuffing them? In the midst of this I need to continue my magick. I need to do tem-ple and sit in stillness. Often, I find my answers there. Amazing!

In Peace, Donna Stanford-Blake Letter? to the editor Dear Managing Editor: I just had read the Beltane '95 edition of MEZLIM, and was very pleased with the depth of understanding in the dis-cussion^ on sexual orientation in the mag-ickal community. I found Paul Ravenscraft's \"Sexual Identity as a Spectrum of Possibility\" and Morgana's \"Sexual Orientation, Gender, and that Polarity' Business\" both to be thoughtful and enlightening. Where I disagree, how-ever, is with Ivo Dominguez's \"Three Gay Male Archetypes\" which seem short-sight-ed for the modern gay man - especially the •modern gay man who is also a pagan. The three archetypes which Dominguez chooses are very closely related to the stereotypes that modern society holds for us; and comes at a time when the gay community is struggling very hard to broaden its own self-perception and the perception of the larger society. We must remember with these archetypes, as with all others, we should not limit the facets that the triple god/dess can take; and this includes their images as gay or lesbian. We are not one dimensional people, and our archetypes of the gods/desses should not be either. We do not have to accept standard-ized precepts - or archetypes. The point is, that when choosing an archetype, we should not be afraid to explore all the facets of the diamond that we, as children of the Great Lady and the Horned God, truly are. Sexual orientation is a difficult issue, and I must say, that as a young gay man, and a novice on the Wiccan path, I appreciate the Wisdom and compassion that is expressed in this issue of MEZLIM. Taken as a whole, I'd say that this collec-tion of addresses demonstrates that the magickal community is heading in the right direction in terms of understanding and acceptance of differing orientations. Let's hope that society can eventually move in the same direction. But until then, it is good to know that there is a place where we can all call home. I am, yours in the Craft, Joshua ap Herne-Dragonsong Dear N'Chi and Friends, 1 just finished reading the latest issue of MEZLIM and my sides are aching from laughter.

There are, of course, legends and myths about the bards of the past and Ossian is our model, but it is a model that must be updated. Please, think about it deeply: this new magick has set upon each of us the most beautiful task, the Great Work and the spreading of our Culture all over the world. This we must sing about, now. Otherwise our children won't have any-thing updated to sing around the bonfires: what do you expect, that they read Waite's books while banging the drums?

The number of drummers decreases and the rhythms grow more pointed and complex. Beats that call to specific Deities are played to invoke or evoke their presence. Dancers may be moved into possession by the Deities that are called. Specific Drumming may show up in any tempo or speed. Some pre-knowl-edge of the rhythms played is usually help-ful but intent listening usually reveals a rhythmic pattern that a drummer new to a particular beat can play. Festivals are great opportunities for learning new rhythms and many of the rhythms leamt fall into the Specific category. TRANCE DRUMMING: Trance Drumming is usually very late night/early morning drumming. Relatively few people remain at the Fire and those who do usually have a deep com-mitment to contacting the Sacred. Rhythms associated with trance drumming are customarily slower in tempo and quite simple in outward structure. Rhythmic phrases are repeated over and over until the drummers and other participants are swept into an altered state of consciousness by the repetition of the rhythmic phrase. 1 find that Trance Drumming is very similar to mantric yoga. At a Festival I attended some time ago, Trance Drumming was practiced before a shrine dedicated to ancestral spirits. While I was drumming, I became aware of various aches and pains in my body from holding a con-stant position while drumming. After awhile I moved beyond the discomfort into a space where the drum rhythm filled my consciousness. The next step in my experi-ence of the Trance Drumming process can be compared to the flickering of a candle. Awareness comes and goes ... it seems to flicker on and off. It pushes off from the rhythm being played and returns to the rhythm after a spell of profound inner silence. In summary, it may be beneficial to distinguish between three styles of Festival Drumming: 1.COMMUNITY DRUM STYLE -This style calls forth the spirit of the community and is a celebration of the trust and respect shared by the Festival goers. It is usually the first style of drum-ming heard around the Festival Fire. 2.SPECIFIC DRUM STYLE -Here the drummers play specific rhythms in order to invoke/evoke specific Deities. Festivals are excellent environments for drummers to teach and learn new rhythms and many of the rhythms shared between drummers are Specific in nature. The Specific style of drumming ordinarily follows the Community Style. 3.TRANCE DRUM STYLE -This style of Festival Drumming is ordi-narily associated with intense magickal work. Simple rhythmic phrases are repeated in order to induce a trance state. This style of drumming is com-monly the last played and many Festival goers greet the dawn to the sound of Trance Drumming. \"Bard\" is a word used to designate a position; a position dressed in character-istics that distinguish it from other roles and positions. \"Temple Drummer\" is an apt term to describe those drummers who play for and to Spirit at home and at Festivals. IThe term Ter..ple Drummer is meant to describe both a type of drummer and a position and role in a magickal group. It is common for Festivals to nurture the growth of Temple Drummers and for these drummers to take their new skills and mag-icks back to the mystical groups with whom they work. Many groups have positions such as Priest or Priestess. The position of Temple Drummer can also be of great value to the functioning of a group. The position could be vested in one individual or float from one member to another as situation and skill prescribe. Initiations into the position of Temple Drummer can be per-formed based upon the group's orientation and the drummer's relationship to Spirit. The primary role of the Temple Drummer is to call/assist in the calling of Spirit. Other functions that the Sacred Drummer could perform in a magickal group include; signaling the opening and the closing of the rites, providing a unify-ing framework for songs and chants, sup-plying rhythms for group and individual ritual dances, setting a pace for the ritual work at hand by either speeding up or slowing down the rhythm being played, and bolstering mood changes within the rite by varying the volume of the playing. I have often times observed a shift in the confidence level of ritualists when drums are included in the rite. People who are reticent to speak lines, invocations, etc. in a silent environment quite frequently forcefully project their parts when a back-ground of drumming is present. The Temple Drummer walks hand in hand with Spirit. S/he uses the sound and silence of the drum to speak the end-less Names of Spirit. The drum not only talks, it listens. It pulls into itself the Names it speaks and grows more powerful in the process. Perhaps it is well that the Bard of"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"the Festival Movement seems to speak through the tight membrane of the drum. The drum is the most primary of instru-ments.

A very large casino has been built across the street from the Temple and it advertis-es its presence with a 3 to 4 hour laser light show almost every night.

We all have seen how music can drive a person to self-destruction or lead countries to war. I firmly believe that if a person is weak spiritually and mentally, they will be wide open for this kind of influence. And it is evident that if a per-son refuses to let down their mental barri-ers, they will be mostly unaffected by musical influences.

As a musical \"healer\", one must ensure that they are empathic enough to communicate the right message or information to do the maximum benefit to the listener. There are of course certain ethical standards involved as well. One should not use their music with the intent of harming or gain-ing control over someone. Ideally, the musician should ask permission before arcanely using music or there must at least be the knowledge by all parties involved that the music will be reinforcing or creat-ing magick (much like during a ritual or celebration). Something that I have found useful is to spend some time in meditation before playing in front of a group or if my sound like two cats fighting...), but if one is strong, they can at least tolerate it until the light changes to green, so to speak. In ending, I would like to also mention that it is not only skill that is important, but to be in tune with the forces around you (another bad pun). Sincerity and a fervent desire to use your music to lighten the heavy heart, ease bur-dens, teach, and learn are vital skills that must not be lost. Mechanical, formulaic barding can be quite counter-productive. It ' is one thing in the studio to hone a song to perfection, but to try something like that during a celebration around a sacred fire is basically closing yourself off to the influ-ence of the deities and what wonders could transpire during a truly inspired session of drumming and dancing.

It was not responsible (a value which she clearly cherished) to assume tasks and instill trust in others regarding their com pletion, and then fail to accomplish all but the most pressing of details. She saw clearly that her image of herself as busy but productive was not reflected in her actions or her life. She was busy, but she accomplished little or noth-ing. Her life was not a joy, was not even productive, but rather was evidence of the ultimate uselessness of a frantic human \"doing\" rather than the progress of a cen-tered human \"being\". Focus, discipline, responsibility. She had had her \"fun\" (as in NOT!), and it was time to get on with her Work (and hopefully a lot more real fun as part of the process). She was ready to move from the wind-buffeted periphery of her own per-sonal tornado to its center... and to begin to assume control of its power.
