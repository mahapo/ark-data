HIEBImages of kachinas and clowns are found throughout books, journals, andmagazines that celebrate the arts of American Indian peoples, including theHopi. As familiar as we are with these visual images, for the most part theyare one-dimensional and suggest little of their meaningful contexts in Hopithought and ritual. There are other more subtle contexts that contribute tothe meaning of tsukulalwa (clowning), including the plaza in which the cere-mony is performed and the events the clowns address through their humor.This article provides an introduction to the narrative and ritual contexts ofthe clown ceremony and considers the changing historical circumstancesof clowning.'Here in the spring and early summer the katsinas (katsinam) come tothe Hopi villages as \"messengers\" to receive the prayers and prayer offeringsof the Hopi people in complex two-day ritual performances called katsinadances (katsintithu) and to reciprocate with food and assurances that theirprayers have been heard.2 These masked figures are the spirits of the ances-tors and the spiritual essence of all things and beings within the Hopi world.As intermediaries, they not only carry human prayers to the gods, but alsothey return as rain for the corn plants that sustain Hopi life. The katsinam arespoken of as \"beautiful beings\" for they are the embodiment of the Hopi way(hopi): \"Katsina soosok qatsit yuwsi'la, katsinas wear all things of life.\"3Clowns (tsukskut) participate in a ritual drama called tsukulalwa duringthese katsina ceremonies. In their being and behavior the tsukskut are theopposite of the katsinas. The katsinam embody the colors of the cardinaldirections and the six varieties of Hopi corn-a form of \"chromatic prayer,\"while the tsukskut are \"earth-colored\" and wear strips of cast-off clothing andcorn husks in their hair. More importantly, the clowns \"depict life as it shouldnot be,\" that is, behavior that is qahopi (bad, misbehaving, nonconforming).Although they are clowns, these tsukskut are also priests whose role is sacredand serious.Louis A. Hieb (professor emeritus) was head of Special Collections at the Universityof Arizona Library and later director of the Center for Southwest Research at theUniversity of New Mexico.107"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"AMERICAN INDIAN CULTURE AND RESEARCH JOURNALThe following is an account of the clown ceremony as it was performedin the villages of the Hopi Third Mesa in the early 1970s and as it continuesto be performed today.4 The clowns of the First and Second Mesas differ inappearance as do aspects of the ritual drama in which they participate.5 Inthe years following the research on which this article is based, Hopi linguistEmory Sekaquaptewa and poet Ramson Lomatewama each wrote insightfulaccounts of clowning on Third Mesa, and the ceremony was also the subjectof a dissertation by German anthropologist Hans-Ulrich Sanner.'Ã½As an introduction it is helpful to draw on Sanner's summary of his workon tsukulalwa: \"The overall clown ceremony follows a traditional pattern ofdramatic ritual development that reflects and enacts a central conceptionof Hopi philosophy: the life cycle of the people from a paradise-like begin-ning to a stage of utmost corruption and decadence that will inevitablylead to supernatural punishment and a renewal of life. According to Hopieschato]ogy, this has happened several times before, and it will happenagain, perhaps soon.\"7 Intertwined with the traditional drama of the tsuk-skut are carefully planned skits, \"farcical morality plays,\" performed bypiptuqam (sometimes defined as \"arrivals\") that reflect problems in Hopisociety. A piptuqa is a katsina skit actor, one who visits the clowns in theplaza. Although the skits of piptuqam are planned, much of clowning iscreative and spontaneous as when tsukskut regard individuals in the plazaas piptuqam, for example, asking several albino Hopi children they discover,\"Are you Pahaanas [Anglos]?\" or asking a bearded, white-robed hippie whojust entered, \"Are you Jesus? Are you here to save us?\" As Lomatewamanotes, \"The clowns' antics in the plaza can range from slapstick to serious-ness, from G-rated to XXX-rated material.\"8 By presenting what is qahopi in ahumorous manner, the clowns and their \"instruments,\" the piptuqam, bringthe judgment of laughter on unacceptable behavior and in doing so sustainan ethical consensus.\"THE NARRATIVE CONTEXTThe clown ceremony brings the microcosm of the present within the macro-cosm of the Hopi philosophy of history. In a brief period of time and in anabbreviated form, the tsukulalwa recalls the events of the Hopi emergencenarrative and relates what Edmund Leach called the \"time-now of experi-ence\" to the \"time-then of myth.\"10Hopi narratives of the past include the emergence narrative, clan migra-tion narratives, and narratives that explain the presence of ruins in the regionsurrounding the Hopi villages. The emergence narratives record events priorto and including the emergence of the Hopi and other peoples on the earth'ssurface.1' Clan migration narratives describe the movements of the variousclans at the emergence from the lower world to the village of Oraibi (or someother place considered as a center).One version of the emergence narrative begins:108"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The Hopi Clown Ceremony (Tsukulalwa)A very long time ago they were living down below. Everything was goodthere at that time. That way of living was good down there. Everythingwas good, everything grew well; it rained all the time, everything wasblossoming. That is the way it was, but by and by it became different.The chiefs commenced to do bad. Then it stopped raining and theyonly had very small crops and the winds began to blow. People becamesick. By and by ... the people participated in this. They, too, beganto talk bad and to be bad .... The chiefs ...became angry and theyplanned to do something to the people, to take revenge on them.They began to think of escaping. So a few of the chiefs met once andthought and talked about the matter.'2Another version begins bluntly, \"In the Underworld all the people were fools[qahopi].... All was confusion, and the chief was unhappy.\"'13Life had reached a stage of decadence and corruption. So the mongwi,\"leaders,\" came together to see what could be done.... They decidedthat to regain a pure life, they would have to leave this place. Theywould make sure that popwaqt, \"witches\" or \"evil-doers\" among thepeople, who had caused the world's corruption, could not follow.The sky, they knew, was a dome that covered the earth. Up above thedomed arch, on its \"roof,\" they had heard the tread of footsteps. So,they reasoned, there must be another world above this one. Perhapsthe being who made the footsteps would give them permission tocome and live there. In this way they would escape the evil of theworld below.'4Once on the earth's surface, the Hopis eventually meet Maasaw who says tothem, \"You ... are strong of heart. Look in the'valleys, the rocks and thewoods, and you will find my footsteps there. All this is mine, but by yourcourage you have won it. All this I give [to] you, all this is yours forever.\"15Moving from world to world, as in the emergence narrative, or from placeto place, as in the clan migration narratives, the people seek to escape evil andbegin life anew. The same perspective is found in the ruins narrative as well.In these the teller implicitly or explicitly likens the circumstances of the pastto those of the present. In an account of the destruction of Awat'ovi, Ta'palo,the chief of Awat'ovi, calls on other villages to destroy his own people whowere \"out of control.\" Ta'palo says, \"The same thing took place when we stilllived in the underworld. Now I want my village erased from the surface ofthe earth. It will disappear completely.\"'6 These narratives define what it is tobe hopi (one who adheres to the Hopi way of life) by considering the conse-quences of behavior that is qahopi (bad behavior) or qahopqatsi (a bad way oflife). The stories are powerfully tied to ruins whose physical reality the narra-tives seek to explain. They are part of a chain of memories and, consequently,historically important, but they are also part of a body of knowledge in whichthe remembered past has ethical meaning for the present.109"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"AMERICAN INDIAN CULTURE AND RESEARCH JOURNALTHE CLOWN CEREMONYTsukulalwa takes place in the context of a katsina dance (katsintihu). In apredawn appearance in the village plaza (tivongyapave) the katsinum are heardsinging, and they are greeted&by the katsinam na'am'iw (the father of thekatsinas), who invites the dancers to return during the day to sing, dance, andmake the people's hearts glad.'7 So it is that throughout the two-day durationof the dances, the katsinam are led to the plaza, ideally four times before lunchand four times after (but often six to eight times).While attention focuses on the dancing of the katsinam, the men who havebeen asked to play the role of tsukskut enter a kiva nearby. Their attire-shredsof a woman's black dress to be tied at their wrists and knees, sheep's hoofsrattles to be worn at their ankles, an old pair of shoes, and breech cloth-canbe carried easily in a paper bag. Each man covers his body, face, and hair withearth-colored mud, ties his hair into two upward-pointing queues, and, withsoot, paints spots on his eyebrows and above the upper lip and paints cres-cents below his eyes and mouth. Finally, each man dons a bandolier of food(nitkya, bag lunch). The chief clown (tsukumongwi) goes to the clan house ofthe clan (Eagle) that owns the clown ceremony and invites the clown youth(tsukutiyo) and clown maiden (tsukumana), who are the spiritual ancestors,to attend to their activities and then lays a prayer-meal path in the directionof the plaza. The men play the role of the clown youth while the chief clowncarries a cloth doll (tsukumana), whose face is.painted like a tsuku, in a clotharound his waist.When all is ready the tsukskut offer a prayer at the foot of the kiva ladderand then make their way behind the houses that define the plaza.'8 Theclowns climb to the flat roof tops and move to the edge of a house overlookingthe dancing katsinam. The chief clown calls out \"yaahahay!\" four times.Significantly, it is noon. The sun is at its zenith, its highest point, and Hopissee a correspondence in the decline of the sun during the afternoon and themoral decline of clowns in the events that follow.19 The commotion of theirarrival commands attention, and the clowns now make one of the few formalstatements associated with their role: \"Look down there. There is the lightof blossoms, of flowers, down there. Everything is bountiful and beautiful-siitalawva, the light of life or flowers in bloom [a portent of happiness andprosperity]. How can we get down there, it is so precipitous?\"The tsukskut then descend (an inversion of the Hopi's own emergenceaccount) into the plaza (\"this world\") by a variety of unorthodox methods-for example, upside down on a rope or by \"parachute\" (that is, by jumpingwith a borrowed umbrella in hand). Once down they set about investigatingthis \"beautiful\" place-eating scraps of food, refuse, and other debris theyfind and examining the flowers on women's shawls. Before long they stumble(literally) into the katsinam while doing a one-footed dance and realizethe presence of these \"beautiful creatures.\" Immediately and greedily theyattempt to \"own\" as many as possible shouting, \"This many are mine! Thismany are mine!\" as they race around the katsinam with outstretched arms.As the katsinam finish their song and move to the third and final position on110"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"their circuit of the dance plaza, the clowns make a prayer-meal path for thekatsinam to follow and make prayer-meal offerings to them.When the katsinam have finished dancing, the father of the katsinas invitesthem to rest and to return to sing again, and he begins to make a prayer-mealpath to their resting place (katsinki) outside the village. The clowns preventthem from leaving and start looking for their \"leader\" (mongwi). Beginningwith the chief clown, each clown addresses the katsinam, \"Are you the leader?Are you the leader?\" (Ya um mongwi?) When they reach the kukuynaqa (songleader), he shakes his rattle affirmatively. Each clown then says, \"I, too, amthe leader!\" The clowns then tell the katsinam to bring \"lots of piki\" and otherfood, cars, and beautiful women.The katsinam are finally permitted to depart under a shower of prayer-meal offerings and the tsukskut wander to the opposite end of the plaza wherea small evergreen tree had been placed at the time of the predawn dance.The clown maiden doll (tsukumana) carried by the chief clown is placed atthe base of the tree and the other clowns place their bandoliers of food theresaying, \"This is what will sustain our mortal life.\" The plaza is now the clowns'world-a microcosm-in which they set about building a house, a house ofashes and other incongruous elements.When the men are invited to play the roles of the tsukskut, they are told,\"You have been chosen to go to the plaza to eat there.\" As they busy them-selves with imaginary televisions and picture windows, their aunts bring themclothes and boxes filled with food. In a prayer ceremony expressing the needfor life-sustaining rain and corn, the clowns are presented with an abundanceof food, which they greedily consume and waste.The katsinam return and dance, and the tsukskut make prayer offeringsto the dancers. The katsinas leave again, and throughout the afternoon,between the dances of the kalsinam, a second kind of figure appears: thepiptuqa. These \"arrivals\" or \"visitors\" are masked individuals or groups whocome to the plaza to illustrate to the tsukskut-by means of \"plays withinthe play\"-behavior that is qahopi. Because most of these skits deal withcurrent concerns in Hopi society, the piptuqam wear masks, clothing, and, onoccasion, nametags representing an Anglo tourist, Bureau of Indian Affairsofficial, teacher, anthropologist, Hopi alcoholic, adulterer, and namedindividuals, for example, traditionalist spokesman Thomas Banyacya andaffluent artist Charles Loloma. Once a skit is completed the chief clowngives the piptuqam a prayer-meal offering and says, \"We want you to take themessage so that before long they (the cloud people) may bring forth theirblessings for us, that we may have rain.\" The piptukum are also katsinam,although of a \"lesser order.\"At first the clowns do not notice the piptuqam. When they do, they becomecurious and strike up a conversation saying, \"Who are you? What is thepurpose of your visit?\" The piptuqam then divulge their identities, why theyare there, and then act out a skit. The skit is intended for the tsukskut, but,in the words of one Hopi, \"it shows the public their mistakes, the kinds ofthings they've neglected to do, the kind of life they are leading, or the liber-ties they have taken. It shows their excesses.\" Often when they appear to theThe Hopi Clown Ceremony (Tsukulalwa)III"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"AMERICAN INDIAN CULTURE AND RESEARCH JOURNALtsukskut, the piptuqam say, \"You remember you did this,\" or 'You also did that,\"addressing the \"you\" to all those in attendance.In his analysis of ritual metaphors, Emory Sekaquaptewa writes, \"Hopikatsina songs, one component of these performances, focus almost whollyon rain and the practices of life that put the gift of rainfall to its mostfulfilling use.\" He notes that most katsina songs include \"the phrases Umanaawuwayani, 'You will reflect back,' or Ura hisato, 'You remember when,'followed by a reminder of the good life when rains came and the landscapewas lush with blooming plants.\" He continues, \"Implicit in these reminders isthe message that this good life was the result of adhering to the Hopi way oflife.\"21 Although the katsina songs reference a \"past perfect time,\" the tsukskutand the piptuqa illustrate in their being and behavior the imperfections of thepresent time and its consequences.A member of the Eagle clan recalled the following five examples ofskits performed by the piptuqam in 1971.22 The humor here is planned andspontaneous, verbal and visual, and relies on shared knowledge of receivedtraditions or current problems within Hopi society. At the same time, manyskits affirm Hopi identity compared to other cultures, including the Navajo.1. Most skits are humorous and evoke laughter but some, as the first skitillustrates, are serious. A Sotuqnongu katsina, its mask and clothing wornand moth-eaten, enters the plaza, and, upon questioning by the tsukskut,he tells them his problem: \"You have not been faithful in your prayerofferings. It's been a long time since you've seen fit to make the properritual offerings. Now my crown of eagle feathers has decayed away sothere's nothing left but a stick on my head. You are straying from yourritual duties and so you'll not receive the blessings for which prayer offer-ings are made. You've forgotten your duties. You're only out for a goodtime, for amusement.\"2:T Then he departs.2. This second skit conveys something of the temporal and political natureof behavior deemed to be qahopi. In this instance, all Hopis will laughat the incongruity between perception and reality; for many there willalso be an implicit reminder of what it is to be hopi. Two piptuqam enterthe plaza, an old Hopi woman leading an old Hopi man with a stick inthe manner in which the .blind are led. They make their way to wherethe clowns are eating and stuff some food in their masks. The oldwoman yells at the old man as do the clowns, and the audience is led toconclude that he is blind and deaf. When the tsukskut ask him questions,he just stares at them. Finally, a little Koyemsi (\"Mudhead\") katsina(Koyemsihoya) comes into the plaza, approaches the old man, andwhispers in his ear. Immediately, the old man jumps up and runs outof the plaza. The old woman explains, \"His welfare check just arrived.\"With that, she departs.Not all clown behavior is concerned to make an explicit ethical point.Some is simply humorous, a contrast to the seriousness of the katsina cere-mony. Humor-especially in the tsukulalha-is enormously complex. It oftenderives not so much from the subject matter as from how the subject matter is112"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"presented. Hopi men and women, young and old, or Hopis who live on or offthe reservation do not perceive all the skits of piputuqam in the same way.3. There is a Hopi popular belief that crickets cause cracks in the walls ofhouses and in the sandstone of the mesas on which their villages arelocated. Moreover, there is a saying, \"If you have crickets in the house,it will cause your walls to crack.\" With this shared knowledge in mind,the humor of the following skit is more apparent. The tsukskut got intoan argument regarding the condition of their \"house\" and accused eachother of having a \"bad heart\" and being bad housekeepers. Then twocricket piptuqam came into the plaza wearing carpenter's overalls andcarrying a toolbox between them with a variety of carpenter's tools. Theyhad whistles inside their masks and made cricket chirps as they movedfrom house to house around the plaza. They measured the walls, feltthem, hit them with their chisels, and then blew on their whistles. Theyfound many cracks in the process. Eventually they came to the clowns'\"house,\" which on this occasion had one log wall and three \"walls\" ofashes. The crickets got out some tools, including a saw and an ax, andbegan to saw and chop on the log. The tsukskut began to wonder andbacktracked to the other houses in the plaza. They blamed the cricketsfor all the cracks and then repeated the saying regarding crickets in thehouse. The tsukskut then chased after the crickets, took their tools away,tore off their overalls, and tossed mud and water on them.4. A frequent \"visitor\" to the lsukskut, Kwikwilyaqa, the \"imitator katsina,\"has black-and-white striped conical eyes and a nose and a wig of cedarbark. Kwikwilyaqa can echo every spoken word, seemingly regardless oflanguage, repeat lengthy speeches, and mimic the actions and gestures ofthe person before him. On one occasion, copying a tsuku who touchedhis mud-covered head with a firebrand, Kwikwilyaqa started a fire on hiscedar-bark wig (cedar bark being favorite tinder) and ran smolderingfrom the plaza. On another occasion, the tsukskut discuss a phonographone of their numbers had brought into the plaza. One says it's a fake,that it can't reproduce a human voice. They wonder what is inside, butbefore they investigate further some piptuqam appear with a large box.This, too, is a phonograph. After a lengthy discussion they decide to testit. They wind it up (or pretend to do so), and one of the clowns gives along, elaborate speech recounting several exploits of a sexual nature.Finally the box is given its chance, and it does a remarkably good job inrepeating the lengthy speech. The clowns' curiosity has now been pushedto its limit, and they tear the box open only to find Kwikwilyaqa inside.5. Alcoholism has become the. most significant disease related to social andcultural factors. There is much gossip about families who leave small chil-dren for weeks at a time, Hopi women who work off-reservation and havedrinks before returning home in the evenings, and Hopis hitchhiking toWinslow for beer or wine. While the tsukskut ate lunch, three small Utepiptuqam children, barefoot and wearing gunnysacks, enter. Their \"father\"enters shortly after with a hoe in his hand. The Utes wander to where the113The Hapi Clown Ceremony (Tsukulalwa)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"AMERICAN INDIAN CULTURE AND RESEARCH JOURNALclowns are eating. The tsukskut invite them to eat, and both the childrenand their father tell the clowns that their mother started drinking andleft them. The father said, \"I don't understand. I tried to provide for herand for them by weaving and farming. But she ran off.\" Throughout eachrecitation the clowns wailed loudly and caused much laughter by theirexaggerated response. As the piptuqam started to leave, the clowns said,\"we have the same trouble here\" and gave each of them prayer meal.Throughout the afternoon of the first day and most of the second, thepiptuqa?n continue to appear to the tsukskut. At the same time, various warningfigures--kipok katsinam (raider or warrior katsinas)-led by the owl (Mongwu)katsina arrive in quick succession at the entrances to the plaza and giveominous calls and warnings. Each of these katsinam--as many as ten or moredifferent figures-has a distinct mask, attire, dance step, and circuit aroundthe plaza. Many appear in pairs with synchronized movements and calls (forexample, Eewiro, a warrior katsina). Others like the crow (Angwushahay'i, akatsina considered a totokswuuti, or wildcat woman, because she encouragesthe whipper katsinas), wolf (Kwewkatsin), Tsorposyaqahontaqa (the namerefers to the turquoise that dangles above the nose), and several ogres moveslowly around the dance area addressing warnings and threatening gesturesto the audience as well as the tsukskut.The warnings to the tsukskut increase in number and frequency. Asthese take place, the chief clown is seen meeting with the owl and passinga turquoise necklace to him. Toward the midafternoon of the second day alull falls over the plaza between dances by the katsinam. The kipok katsinumand various warrior katsinam gather their forces in a nearby kiva and thenswarm into the plaza-yucca whips in hand-to punish the tsukskut. The kipokkatsinuni first tear the clown's house apart and toss the tsukumana into theaudience. The clowns hide, but-with the exception of the chief clown-theyare quickly discovered, articles of their clothing are torn off, and they are tiedin a heap with the black strips of cloth that had been around their waists andknees. The chief clown is then found and tossed on the heap. Buckets of waterappear from the plaza-side houses, and the clowns are drenched and whippedby the kipok katsinum. As they untangle themselves the clowns discover thechief clown is free, and they accuse him of betraying them by bribing the owlto lessen his punishment. The most significant aspect of this punishment isthat the \"clowns\" have been washed clean, all of the \"earth color\" has disap-peared, and the painted smiles are gone from their faces. They are, in a sense,no longer tsukskut, no longer qahopi-they are 'Just plain Hopis.\" However,they have not yet confessed their wrongs, something they must do if they areto receive the blessings of the katsinam.The kipok katsinanz return, carrying boxes and sacks. of food, but'theclowns--setting aside their grievance with the chief clown-hide among thewomen seated around the plaza where the warrior katsinam seek them out.As Sanner has pointed out, \"The gifts the kipok katsinam have brought for theclowns are considered blessings. But in order to earn and truly deserve them,each clown must first make a confession.\" The warrior katsinam then lead the114"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"clowns, one at a time, to the end of a double line formed by the kipok katsinam.The clown asks \"What shall I do?\" and the warrior kachina tells him, 'You shallsing!\" The clown then \"sings\" (tells a story) in exchange for a pile of foodassigned to him by the warrior katsinam. He does this, holding his hands upto his breast and making some sidelong hops toward the food pile with hisfeet close together. As he hops, he shouts out, \"aa ii, aa ii, attend to this truestory!\" Then he tells the story, pointing at someone of his own kin, exposingsome real or imaginary weakness by means of word play or a pun.2 4The clown ceremony is concerned with life from an age of innocence toan age of awareness. At the end the clowns are punished, the paint that madethem tsukskut is destroyed, and they escape-renewed through the laughterthey have evoked-from the corrupt world they and the piptuqam have createdin the plaza. The judgment of laughter on what is qahopi is also an affirmationof what is hopi.HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVESIn his account of the Isukulalwa Ransom Lomatewama concludes that \"theclowns are mirrors\": they reflect not only life as it should not be but also \"lifeas it is, particularly its choices and consequences.\"25 The tsukskut respond,in part, to situations and events that are localized in space and time, andtherefore the historical context is significant for understanding certain clownhumor. During the past two centuries many aspects of Hopi culture andsociety have undergone significant changes-changes that are reflected inhistorical accounts of clowning.With the annexation of Hopitutskwa (Hopi land) as a part of the landacquired by the United States in 1848 following the Mexican War, a number ofmilitary expeditions reached the Hopi mesas. On 1 April 1852 Dr. P. S. G. TenBroeck, surgeon in the US Army stationed in New Mexico, attended a katsinadance in the First Mesa village of Sichomovi and wrote the first description ofpart of the tsukulalwa:As appendages to the feast, they had clowns who served... to amusethe spectators while the dancers were away. [They were dressed] inbreech-clouts, having some comical daubs of paint on their faces andpersons ... and were amusing themselves by attempts at dancing,singing, and running races, when they were attacked by a huge grizzlybear (or rather a fellow in the skin of one), which, after a long pursuitand many hard fights, they brought to bay and killed. They thenimmediately opened him and took from out of his body a quantity ofguaves, green. corn, etc., which his bearship had undoubtedly appro-priated from the refreshments provided for the clowns.26In 1892 and 1893 Alexander M. Stephen wrote detailed descriptions ofseveral katsina dances, including parts of the clown ceremony.27 In the fortyyears between Ten Broeck's visit and Stephen's employment as an ethnologistwith the Hemenway Southwestern Archaeological Expedition a number ofThe Hopi Clown Ceremony (Tsukulalwa)115"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"AMERICAN INDIAN CULTURE AND RESEARCH JOURNALevents took place that are reflected in his accounts of the skits of the piptuqam.The Hopi were overrun with missionaries, anthropologists, agents and othergovernment officials, traders, and tourists, many of whom brought alcoholwith them, engaged in prostitution, and forced American-style schoolingon Hopi children. There appears to be a significant shift in Hopi ritualhumor during the second half of the nineteenth century from a concernwith internal boundaries-especially gender relations and/or the rights andobligations of kinship-to more of a concern with external boundaries-maintaining Hopi cultural identity in the context of an increasingly pervasivedominant culture.Stephen was employed byJ. Walter Fewkes in September 1891 to recordthe Maraw and Wuwtsim ceremonies at Walpi as a part of the work of theHemenway expedition. Until his death in April 1894, Stephen worked dayand night to record Hopi and social ceremonial life, including elements ofthe tsukulalwa (for example, time and mode of entry, ash house, warnings,and punishment). Although Stephen wrote that the clowns performed \"asusual\" and \"according to custom,\" it is clear from his field notes that he didnot understand that the elements were part of a dramatic whole. \"What is themeaning of this begging? What of this gluttony,\" he asked, \"the house, etc.?\"28Nevertheless, his detailed accounts reveal the changing world reflected-albeit distorted by the creativity of humor-in the clown's mirror.Americans-or rather \"grotesques\" of them, as Stephen called thepiptuqam,Y---appeared in a series of skits in a katsina dance in April 1893. In thefirst, the clowns give a \"stranger\" two bottles that contain \"very dilute coffeeto simulate whiskey.\" The stranger began to praise the drink, \"saying that theAmericans were fond of it, drank it and got happy, until they staggered, grewdizzy, and fell down; that the Navajo had lots of it which they bought from theAmerican.... [There was] much more of this mild satire on whisky drinking,but in the uproar I could not follow.\" This was followed by \"a very goodburlesque of an American visitor\" and several piptuqam, males and females:[The American visitor] shook hands very effusively with the Pi'ptumaids, and when they asked him for paper money notes, he gener-ously scribbled them. But when the Pi'ptu men asked him for anythinghe abruptly said, \"Get out!\" and pushed past them. The Pi'ptu maidsbrought him \"dolls\" [tithu, katcina doll] and these he eagerly boughtand gave them generous prices for them, the other Pi'ptu holdingup the American paper money and calling out the amount it was for,etc. The American put his hand in the basket and brought out a lotof imitation candy, moist nodules of meal pressed into about the sizeof almonds and stained with bright pigment; these he threw about forthe Pi'ptu to scramble for.29After this \"American visitor\" left, \"another well made-up American came incarrying a camp chair, one hand thrust into his overcoat pocket and swingingthe chair in the other.\" This \"eager sight-seer\" looked up at the terraces and indoors and windows. Reaching one open doorway, he dropped that character116"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"and became \"a store keeper.\" \"Presently he made overtures to one of thePi'ptu women and he took her inside, and she came out with an armful ofprints. 'Ho,' said her husband, 'there has been chomni, etc.,' and thereuponhe fells her for infidelity, and some of the other Pi'ptu take her part and ageneral row ensues.\"30A few weeks later Stephen recorded, \"Between dancesten and eleven, three grotesques came in. Two of these and the six clownsstood in a row and the other grotesque in American clothes and carrying acane under his arm and a book in his hand burlesqued schooling.\"3'Several of the skits performed by the piptuqam concerned neighboringtribal groups. In these, to be Hopi (hopi) is not only a matter of ethics, it isalso a matter of identity, an answer to the even more basic question of whoare we? To be Hopi is not to be Apache, Paiute, or Navajo. For example,Stephen portrays \"a dilapidated old Apache with an old Harper Ferry musketand an old horse pistol, red and blue chevrons on face, red on body, oldwhite hat, old pair of overalls and torn moccasins, [who] speaks in Apacheand sings an Apache song\" and gets into a \"general row with all the clowns\"and elsewhere described \"a band representing Pah Utes ... carrying bowsand arrows, rabbits, etc. They want to trade.\"32 More often, however, Navajowere the subject of humorous reflection. While the katsinum were singing,Stephen writes:A burlesque Navajo comes into the court, mimicking a Navajo ridingon horseback, the horse being a rolled up sheepskin fastened betweenhis legs, a bridle made fast to one end. Whip in hand, he come incantering down and around the line of kachina, passing round themtwo or three times. His make-up as a Navajo is very good indeed, andhe wears a silk turban pulled well over the brow of his grotesque mask,just as a swashbuckler scalawag among the Navajo has the fashion ofdoing. As he passes by an elderly man, here and there, he pulls up his\"horse\" and inquires in pantomime as to water or for some distantplace, all this pantomime very graphic, and when he passes a Chukuhe gives him a cut with his whip and they of course fall over or dancearound in comic pain and lamentations.-33Stephen worked at Thomas V. Keam's trading post for ten years beforejoining the Hemenway expedition. He learned Navajo and wrote accountsof Navajo ceremonies, and when a Navajo curing ceremony was burlesquedduring a Tasapkatsina (Navajo katsina) dance in the spring of 1893 Stephenprovided a richly detailed account. The piptuqam, representing a Navajo medi-cine man (singer, hataali) and his wife, entered:This Navajo song man [carrying] an old pouch, representing thefetich pouch, with a bundle of eagle feathers projecting from it ...walked with a staff like an old man, passed down the line of singingkachina, occasionally touching one as if in wonder and walked downthe court as if all were quite strange to him. He soon spies the clowns... and tells them he is a song man and has brought his medicine withThe Hopi Clown Ceremony (Tsukulalwa)117"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"AMERICAN INDIAN CULTURE AND RESEARCH JOURNALhim. His speech is in Navajo and most of the clowns converse with himin the same tongue. Two of the clowns say that they are ailing, havepains in their belly and limbs. [A fee is agreed to.] The song man...takes off his medicine pouch and produces the small chanter's rattlewhich he elevates, shaking it and beginning his song which is a faithfulimitation of the chanter's song.After a number of ritual acts, the Navajo \"blows away the malign influence.\"Meanwhile, Stephen notes, the spectators have \"followed his proceeding withmuch interest and amusement.\" He continues:[The song man] then made his patients lie down flat on their belliesarid, stripping off their breech cloth ... gets a handful of grasspulp and slaps it on the anus, and then pretends to insert an eaglefeather in the anus, really thrusts the quill between the legs, leavingthe feather upright. The other clowns then ask to be treated, and hecauses all of them to lie down side by side on their bellies and treatsthem with the grass pulp and feather, and all the people shout withlaughter. And it is assuredly a most absurd spectacle, especially whenone considers that of the six clowns, four of them are of the principalmen of the mesa-Sun chief, Snake chief, Kachina father, [and] Hornkiva chief.... The chanter then gathers up his fetiches, slings hismedicine pouch and gives his wife the rifle [the fee], bell and blanketto carry, and makes off leisurely.... But before leaving, the clowns allgive him a pinch of meal and their thanks.34Many skits recorded by Stephen involved burlesques of the katsinam,including the Wawarkatsina (running katsina), and several identified by himas \"Dog kachina,\" \"Rabbit kachina\" (who came hopping into the plaza),\"Picho'Li (Pig) kachina\" (its body stuffed with various objects includingNavajo blankets, bridle and lariat, and a suit of white man's clothes), \"Dawnkachina,\" and others who are often mistreated by the tsukskut and strippedof all their attire except their masks.3 5 Stephen also recorded an elaborateparody of a Hopi wedding ceremony punctuated with a great deal of whatStephen termed \"pornographic display\" that resulted in \"an uproar of shoutsand laughter.\"36Over the course of the next half century there are few accounts ofthe tsukskut and piptuqam. Hopi sensitivity to the presence of Anglos, espe-cially government officials, is noted in a skit recalled in the 1930s by DonTalayesva:While we [the tsukskut] were eating, we saw the old Katcina \"lady\" [apiptuqa] coming with a flat rock on her shoulder. Upon it was carvedan old-fashioned Hopi checker game. She challenged us to play, andpromised that in case we won she would reward us with her favors.The game started and she beat us again and again. We played untilwe had lost everything except our hair and loincloths. Then the old118"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Katcina won our hair; but when she drew shears from her bosom toclip it, our aunts rushed into the plaza, took them from her, and savedus. The old lady warned us that if she won again, she would take ourloincloths. We played and lost. She grabbed my G-string to snatch itoff. I looked around for government employees and saw the schoolprincipal watching us with a frown on his face. I whispered, \"Stop,there is the principal, and he looks cross.\" The old Katcina replied inan undertone, \"That doggone white man should stay away if he can'tstand it.\" \"She\" let go my G-string and said, \"Well, we will have race.If you win, you may do what you please with me; but if I win, I surelyshall have your loincloth.\" We agreed to race, but were afraid that thewhite man would spoil that too.37In his Hopi Bibliography W. David Laird lists more than 150 accounts ofthe snake/antelope ceremonies written since a former Hopi agent, William R.Mateer, published the first account in 1879.38 Hundreds of photographs weretaken between 1885 and the prohibition of photography in 1915. EdwardKennard describes \"a take-off of the behavior of the swarms of tourists whoinvade the villages for the Snake Dance every year,\" which he witnessed inthe 1930s:First several clowns [that is, piptuquam] ran into the plaza carryingsmall black boxes, and then proceeded to \"take pictures\" of everythingin sight and from every imaginable angle. They even dragged peopleout of their houses and made them assume ridiculous poses. Thenthey settled themselves on the housetops, removed their shirts, andexhibited all the manifestations of restlessness seen on such occa-sions. Finally, a clown [piptuqa] entered at the far end of the plaza andimmediately called in a loud voice to another sitting at the oppositeend. They carried on a conversation in English at the top of theirlungs. The new arrival strode across the plaza, made a great fuss as heclambered up the ladder, and then they indulged in a great deal ofhand shaking and back slapping.39By way of summary, in this article I have related the narratives of the eventsof emergence and the dramatic performance of the tsukulalwa to the Hopiphilosophy of history. Hopis refuse to separate the remembered past from itsethical meaning for the present, and in the clown ceremony past and presentare brought together in the communal judgment of laughter. Although thestructure of the ceremony seems much the same during the past century, thecontent began to change during the second half of the nineteenth centuryas the tsukskut and the piptuqam confronted the many kinds of behavior intro-duced by an increasingly pervasive dominant culture not in accordance withhopiiqatsi--the Hopi way of life.The Hopi Clown Ceremony (Tsukulalwa)119"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"AMERICAN INDIAN CULTURE AND RESEARCH JOURNALAcknowledgmentsI dedicate this article to the memory of Emory and Abbott Sekaquaptewawhose scholarship and political leadership did much to preserve and sustainHopi language and culture.

The Hopi people live on or near the southern escarpment of Black Mesain northeastern Arizona on a reservation surrounded by that of their neighbors,the Navajo. Traditionally, Hopis were farmers who pursued a life based on cornagriculture and who supplemented their.diet with small game. Today, Hopis farm,raise cattle, and engage in a variety of occupations on and off reservation. As thewesternmost Puebloan people, the Hopis live in thirteen villages on three finger-likeprojections south from Black Mesa and to the west along Moencopi Wash. Thereare three villages on First Mesa-Walpi, Sichumovi, and the Tewa-speaking villageof Hano-and the modern community, Polacca, which has spread at the base of thenarrow mesa. Second Mesa includes the villages of Shipaulovi and Mishongnovi,which occupy small, isolated promontories, and the large village of Shungopavi.Prior to the twentieth century, Oraibi was the only Third Mesa village. A factionalsplit in 1906 and further dissention led to the development of Hotevilla, Bacabi,and New Oraibi (Kykotsmovi). Forty miles to the west, a summer farming villageexpanded and divided to form Lower and Upper Moencopi. By mid-twentiethcentury, rapid culture change affected all aspects of Hopi life, although the rate ofchange was more marked in some villages than others.2. The Hopi ritual calendar consists of a diverse and complex cycle of ritualperformances. Between the summer and winter solstices, there are a number ofceremonies (wiimi, sing.; wiwimi, pl.) including those of the snake and antelope soci-eties and, in alternate years, those of the flute societies, as well as the dances of threewomen's societies (Lakon, Maraw, and Owaqol) and the ceremonies of the \"manhoodinitiation\" societies (Wuwtsim). In Hopi thought, each clan and each religious societywas welcomed to become a part of a village only on the assurance it would make acontribution to sustaining the life and common good of the community. Jesse WalterFewkes, an early student of the Hopi, tells of the beginning of the flute ceremony:\"As the Flute chief and his followers approached [the edge of the village], the Bearchief challenged him, demanding 'Who are you? Whence have you come?' The Flutechief responded that they were kindred and knew the songs necessary to bring rain.\"Through prayers and prayer offerings, these ceremonies are concerned with creatingand maintaining \"a place to make life.\" The ceremonies that occur between the wintersolstice and the summer solstice, differ in that they are \"masked dances,\" and although\"this worldly\" priests (wimkya, sing.; wiwimkyam, pl.: initiated members of an adult120"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Hopi Clown Ceremony (Tsukulalwa)religious society) attend to the masked figures, it is the \"other worldly\" katsinam whoare central.

Just as the katsinasongs refer \"not only to this past perfect beautiful life but also the actions necessary toachieve this life that must be constantly undertaken.\" Sekaquaptewa and Washburn,\"They Go Along Singing,\" 465.11. Another significant context of the katsina dance and the clown ceremony isarchitectural. At the beginning of the twentieth century, a Hopi village consisted of aseries of multistoried, terraced structures, each containing a number of living units,which were arranged in low rows or irregularly around the kiisonvi, a central plaza.The kiihu, the individual matrilineal/matrilocal residence, was a rectangular structureconstructed of sandstone and adobe mud. The kiva, a semisubterranean religious struc-ture constructed of similar materials and built in the form of a rectangular keyhole,was located in the plaza, in the broad streets, and/or at the ends of the house blocks.121"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"AMERICAN INDIAN CULTURE AND RESEARCH JOURNALThe metaphors in terms of which Hopis perceive, experience, and describe theirtraditional architecture derive largely from their worldview. Hopi cosmology includesthe notion of the evolution of mankind through four worlds, with final emergence ofthe Hopi in the Grand Canyon by way of the sipaapuni, an opening (hatchway) fromthe underworld below. In Hopi thought, the architecture of the kiva-through thesipaapuni, an opening in the floor, and the levels of the floors-replicate this account.The ladders that stood against the doorless first-floor exterior of the traditional kiihuor extended above the entrance to the kiva remind Hopis of the trees their ances-tors climbed at the emergence. For Hopis, the sipaapuni is the first component of avillage to be constructed, and the houses that form the plaza are built around it. Thesipaapuni is a symbolic medium of exchange and communication between the upperworld of the living and the lower world of the spirits-between life and life after thislife. From this conception, the levels of the kiva, the tall ladders, the architecture ofthis world, and the architecture of their cosmology correspond and complement eachother. Although culture change has affected all aspects of Hopi life, the central plazaremains the focal point of the ritual calendar. See also n. 17.12. H. R. Voth, The Traditions of the Hopi (Chicago: Field Columbian Museum,1905), 16.13. Alexander M. Stephen, \"Hopi Tales,\" ed. Elsie Clews Parsons, Journal ofAmerican Folk-Lore 42 (1929): 3.14.

In 1883 Sullivan indicated that the Hopis called their landMaasawtutskwa, Maasaw's land, see H. F. C. ten Kate, in Travels and Researches in NativeNorth Atierica, 1882-1883, ed. P. Hovens, W. J. Orr, and L. A. Hieb (Albuquerque:University of New Mexico Press, 2004), 256, 268n47. Today Hopis distinguish betweentutskwa (land as a geopolitical construct) and Hopitutskwa (Hopi land, a religiousconcept). Maasaw is the god of the earth's surface and of death.16. Ekkehart Malotki, ed., Hopi Tales of Destruction, narrated by MichaelLomatuway'ma, Lorena Lomatuway'ma, and Sidney NaminghaJr. (Lincoln: Universityof Nebraska Press, 2002), 182. The destruction of Awat'ovi in 1700 and its narrativereconstnrction may be viewed also as involving a self-transformation of Hopi iden-tity and society. See Peter Whiteley, \"Re-imagining Awat'ovi,\" in Archaeologies of thePueblo Revolt: Identity, Meaning, and Renewal in the Pueblo World, ed. Robert W. Preucel(Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2002), 147-66. The phrase \"narratedby\" is what is used by the editor (Malotki) on this book's title page.17. According to Emory Sekaquaptewa, \"Hopi use the compound form tivongya-pave, literally 'their dance,' tiiva (ti-), + 'display,' pongya (-vongya), + 'at the place of'(-ve) or, as we know it, 'their plaza,' to convey the idea that song as well as dance and allthe associated activities and paraphernalia in these public performances function as anintegrated complex.\" Sekaquaptewa and Washburn, \"They Go Along Singing,\" 461.18. In his autobiography, Don Talayesva recounts his experience as the chiefclown and says, \"When the Katcinas returned to the plaza at about noon, I stepped tothe foot of the ladder and said, 'My partners, let us go over there with happy hearts.If we are lucky some of the people will smile upon us.

In contrast to his brother, seen. 19 above, Abbott Sekaquaptewa emphasized the importance of the piptuqam andthe immediate moral consensus they achieved through humor and, I will add, thecommunitas of shared laughter.23. A katsina may also appear as a piptuqam and as such is able to speak thehuman language.24. Sanner, \"Another Home Run,\" 156-66, provides a detailed analysis of fourtsukutatawi. Stephen noted a clown who \"told of an Oraibi who copulated with his wifewith a big cannon, the wife giving birth to young firearms.\" Stephen, HopiJournal480.25. Lomatewama, \"A Hopi Mirror,\" 12.26. Quoted in Thomas Donaldson, Moqui Pueblo Indians of Arizona and PuebloIndians of New Mexico: Extra Census Bulletin (Washington, DC: US Census PrintingOffice, 1893), 26.27. Alexander Middleton Stephen (1846-94) was born in Scotland and servedin the New York Infantry during the Civil War. After that little is known of his where-abouts until he arrives at Keams Canyon in April 1879. At the time of the 1880 censusStephen listed his occupations as explorer and prospector. Between 1880 and hisdeath in 1894, Stephen was a boarder, clerk in charge, and postmaster at the tradingpost of Thomas V. Keam. He learned Navajo, shared his knowledge of Navajo socialand ceremonial life with Washington Matthews, provided Cosmos Mindeleff with arich account of Navajo vernacular architecture, and published eight articles on theNavajo. He assisted Keam in marketing a large collection of ancestral and historicHopi pottery through \"Catalogue of Keam's Canon Collection of Relics of the AncientBuilders of the Southwestern Table Lands\" (1884). During the field season 1887-88Stephen was employed by the Bureau of [American] Ethnology and contributed toVictor Mindeleff's study of the architecture of Tusayan (Hopi land). In 1891 he joinedthe second Hemenway Southwestern Archaeological Expedition and assisted JesseWalter Fewkes in developing the basis of what Stephen hoped would be a comprehen-sive study of the Hopi. Stephen was well versed in the social evolutionary theory ofLewis Henry Morgan, the dominant theoretical position of the Bureau of [American]Ethnology. For the most part his field notes are those of a natural scientist, and thispartly accounts for his easy collaboration with Fewkes. As is clear from the descriptionsof the tsukskut and piptuqam on First Mesa quoted in this article, Stephen's notebooksare precise.in their accounts of observable behavior-of who didwhat and when, andexact in their description of material culture-of shape, color, and use. Although in hislast letter to Fewkes he wrote of his interest in \"the misty places and their meanings,\"123"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"AMERICAN INDIAN CULTURE AND RESEARCH JOURNALthe mainstays of Stephen's approach were in collecting, describing (often seeking thescientific term for flora and fauna), classifying, and, as occasion demanded, venturinginto developmental and evolutionary frameworks. At the same time, his theoreticaland methodological approach contrasts with that of his contemporary and frequentcompanion,Jeremiah Sullivan (1851-1916), who lived in the Hopi First Mesa village ofSichumovi for nearly seven years (1881-87). Although Stephen described the observ-able behavior and material aspects of Hopi culture, Sullivan recorded the conceptualand moral, locating practices in the context of Hopi thought. Unfortunately, Sullivanleft no account of the tsukulalwa.28. Stephen, HopiJournal, 490.29. Ibid., 367.30. Ibid., 368. The Hopi word (Third Mesa dialect) for copulate is tsuugi.
