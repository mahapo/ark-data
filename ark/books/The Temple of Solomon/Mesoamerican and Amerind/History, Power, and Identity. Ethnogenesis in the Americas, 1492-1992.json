HillCultural anthropologists have generally used the term ethnogenesis to describethe historical emergence of a people who define themselves in relation to asociocultural and linguistic heritage. 1 In the following collection of essays,a number of cultural anthropologists are concerned to demonstrate thatethnogenesis can also serve as an analytical tool for developing criticalhistorical approaches to culture as an ongoing process of conflict and struggleover a people's existence and their positioning within and against a generalhistory of domination.2 In this more analytical sense, ethnogenesis is notmerely a label for the historical emergence of culturally distinct peoples but aconcept encompassing peoples' simultaneously cultural and political struggles tocreate enduring identities in general contexts of radical change anddiscontinuity. For all the indigenous and Afro-American peoples whose historiesare discussed in the following essays, ethnogenesis can be understood as acreative adaptation to a general history of violent changesincluding demographiccollapse, forced relocations, enslavement, ethnic soldiering, ethnocide, andgenocideimposed during the historical expansion of colonial and national statesin the Americas.Ethnogenesis is a useful concept for exploring the complex interrelationsbetween global and local histories through focusing upon \"the dialogues andstruggles that form the situated particulars of cultural production\" (Tsing1994: 283). Ethnogenetic processes are intrinsically dynamic and rooted in apeople's sense of historical consciousness, or \"a reflexive awareness on thepart of social actors of their ability to make situational and more lastingadjust-"},{"pageContent":"Page 2ments to social orderings . . . and an ability to understand that ordering as itis situated in larger, more encompassing spatiotemporal orders that includeothers who are socially different\" (Hill 1988: 7). By defining ethnogenesis as asynthesis of a people's cultural and political struggles to exist as well astheir historical consciousness of these struggles, Ethnogenesis in the Americasdecisively breaks out of the implicit contrast between static local cultures anddynamic global history. None of the indigenous and Afro-American peoplesdiscussed in the following essays can be understood as isolated local cultures,nor do their entanglements in broader relations of national and global powerfully explain or determine the specific forms of ethnogenesis. 3In addition to a people's struggle to exist within a general historycharacterized by radical, often imposed changes, ethnogenesis is grounded in theconflicts within and among indigenous and Afro-American peoples. In contexts ofcolonial domination and structures of national power, ethnic groups becomeinternally divided into factions struggling to control access to the dominantsociety's wealth and power (see Ferguson 1990; Whitehead and Ferguson 1992).Alternatively, factions can develop around the issue of how to cope with thedominant society.4 Both kinds of factionalism can lead to ethnogenesis through aprocess of resisting not only a dominant social order but also other factions'ways of relating to that dominant order. Similarly, interethnic rivalries amongindigenous and Afro-American peoples often formed part of ethnogenesis andethnocide, especially in cases where competing colonial powers institutionalizedsuch divisions into ethnic soldiering (see Whitehead, this volume).Reconstituting Cultural Identities under Colonial DominationMaroon societies of the circum-Caribbean area, or communities founded by escapedAfro-American slaves, offer what are perhaps the most dramatic illustrations ofethnogenesis in the Americas because of their radically uprooted origins asforced exiles from a great diversity of West, South, and East African societies.The diverse African peoples who founded Maroon societies had very little commonground upon which to embark on their struggles to create new communities, asidefrom their shared opposition to the inhumanity of colonial plantation societiesthat reduced Afro-American peoples to animal-like status.Among the Aluku, a Maroon society of inland Surinam and French Guiana, sharedhistorical origins through opposition to institutionalized slavery foundexpression in the practice of naming social groups according to the specificplantations from which their founding members had fled (see Bilby, this volume).These historically differentiated subgroups of the Aluku remained partiallyautonomous through the late eighteenth century, even as"},{"pageContent":"Page 3their leaders formed political and military alliances in order to fight theDutch and their local allies, the Ndjuka Maroons. After their military defeat in1793, the surviving Aluku united into a single ethnic group through worshiping acommon set of religious oracles. Ritual and myth provided the central elementsof Aluku political unification and ethnogenesis in the nineteenth century: \"agod known as Tata Odun, said by the present-day Aluku to have come over fromAfrica along with the ancestors . . . became the supreme tribal deity, to whichall the different groups now owed obeisance\" (Bilby, this volume). Whereas thehistorical experiences of slavery and escape into the remote interior forests ofSouth America had produced an internally fragmented set of Maroon communities,shared religious beliefs and practices provided the Aluku with the raw materialsfor creating a new community by reaching deeper into the historical past ofpeoples and deities migrating across the ocean from Africa to America.The importance of African, indigenous American, and European religions ascornerstones in the building of new ethnic identities emerges as one of thecentral themes in this collection of essays. In some cases, indigenous peoplesrevitalized precolonial symbols of ritual power, as in the building of theSeminole Confederation around ritual chiefs who controlled the sacred fire ofmythic creation (see Sattler, this volume). In other cases, indigenous peoplesformed new alliances and shaped new cultural identities through creativerefashionings of formerly separate indigenous religions. The Kiowa, for example,owe their modern identity at least in part to their Jumano ancestors' adoptionof ritual and ceremonial practices from the Crow, Hidatsa, and other northernPlains peoples with whom they entered into new patterns of trade and allianceduring the eighteenth century (see Hickerson, this volume). Similarly, theArawakan Wakuénai of interior South America formed new patterns of trade andalliance with their eastern Tukanoan neighbors as they fled from forcedrelocations and diseases along the lower courses of the Rio Negro into therelative safety of remote headwater areas (see Hill, this volume).Also important were indigenous peoples' appropriations of European symbols ofritual power, especially in Andean regions, where Christian saints and deitiesbecame absorbed into a centuries-long process of constructing religioushierarchies (Silverblatt 1988; Dillon and Abercrombie 1988; Rasnake 1988).Although such appropriations of Christian ritual symbols were somewhat lessprevalent in the South American lowlands than they were in the Andes, thenineteenth-century adoption of Christian symbols into indigenous religion amongCarib-speaking Kapon and Makushi of Venezuela and Guiana provides an unusualexample of ethnogenesis through actively appropriating religious symbols of theEuropean colonizers (see Staats, this volume). In all these different cases,indigenous American, African, and European ritual and"},{"pageContent":"Page 4myth did not act as static cultural molds existing independently of changinghistorical conditions but as dynamic building blocks for the historicalconstruction of new cultural identities.Historical conditions for indigenous American peoples during the colonial periodpresented a grim picture of demographic collapse, slavery, warfare, and loss ofcontrol over lands and other resources. Within one century after the arrival ofSpanish conquerors in the Andean highlands (ca. 1530), an indigenous populationof approximately 9 million had been reduced to only 1 million (Cook 1981). 5 Inlowland areas of South America, a precontact population of 8.54 million (Denevan1976) had declined to about .5 million by the eighteenth century (Dobyns 1966)and continued to diminish throughout the nineteenth and early twentiethcenturies. Indigenous North American population losses were equally devastatingin proportional terms, falling from a precontact level of about 5 million to .6million in 1800 and reaching a nadir of only .25 million between 1890 and 1900(Thornton 1987: 90, 133). Thus, while indigenous Andean populations fell toabout 10 percent of the precontact level, indigenous populations of lowlandSouth America and the entirety of North America declined to only 5 percent oftheir strengths in 1492.6Indigenous American survivors of the Great Dying during the colonial periodfaced many of the same problems as the Maroon societies of escaped Afro-Americanslaves. Although indigenous American peoples conserved many elements ofsociopolitical organization, ecological adaptation, ritual, and myth thatreached far into the precolonial past, the indigenous cultural identities thatemerged during and after demographic collapse sharply diverged from precontactsocial formations. For example, the various Carib and Arawakan identities thatemerged in colonial Surinam and the Guianas bore little resemblance to theregional chiefdoms that had spread across northern South America and theCaribbean Islands prior to the arrival of Europeans in the Americas (seeWhitehead, this volume). Even in remote frontier areas located far away from thepoints of initial contact and early European colonization, indigenous peoplesconstructed new cultural identities as they adjusted to European diseases,technologies, and distant power struggles.The voracious appetite for fertile lands, cheap labor, and material goods incolonial America affected indigenous and Afro-American peoples in very similarways. The introduction of steel tools, firearms, and other European trade goodstipped the balance of power in favor of indigenous peoples who had the mostdirect access to centers of colonial wealth and power. Aside from the spread ofcontagious diseases, the most devastating effects of the colonial period wereinternecine wars aimed at capturing slaves to sell to or barter with theEuropeans. In northern South America, for example, Dutch merchants offered Caribmiddlemen \"10 axes, 10 machetes, 10 knives, 10 bands of glass"},{"pageContent":"Page 5beads . . . and sometimes a rifle, powder and lead molds\" (Morey and Morey 1975:12, translation mine) for each indigenous slave taken from the interior. Inturn, the Carib middlemen needed only one axe, one machete, and four strings ofpearls to acquire one indigenous slave from the interior. The indigenous slavetrade did not end in lowland South America after its official abolition in 1767but continued through the Rubber Boom of the late nineteenth to early twentiethcenturies (Taussig 1987). Along the Caquetá and Putumayo Rivers in Peru andColombia, Brazilian merchants traded steel tools, firearms, and othermanufactured items to indigenous headmen, who canceled their debts by furnishingindigenous men, women, and children from neighboring groups. Except for greateremphasis on firearms, the terms of exchange were very similar to the paymentsthat the Dutch slave traders had offered to Carib mercenaries during the earlycolonial period. \"An infant costs the value of an American knife; a six-year-oldgirl is valued at one saber and sometimes an axe; an adult man and woman reachedthe price of one rifle\" (Landaburu and Piñeda Camacho 1984: 27, translationmine). Although the trade in indigenous American slaves differed in manyimportant ways from the massive African slave trade, both indigenous andAfro-American peoples suffered the same reduction to subhuman status in colonialAmerica. 7Racist ideologies and practices against indigenous and Afro-American peoplesbuttressed the founding and expansion of Euramerican states in the colonialAmericas. The common experiences of powerlessness, racial stereotypification,enslavement, and marginalization among indigenous and Afro-American peoplesoccasionally found historical expression in sociopolitical unification ofescaped Afro-American slaves and resistant indigenous peoples. The SeminoleConfederation of northern Florida is perhaps the most well documented case ofsuch unification through resistance (see Sattler, this volume).8 However, in thecontext of overwhelming Euramerican military force and material wealth,indigenous and Afro-American peoples more commonly found themselves internallyfragmented and divided against each other in the service of colonial domination.The colonial powers bribed indigenous peoples to enslave other indigenouspeoples from interior regions and hired indigenous mercenaries to preventAfro-American slaves from escaping from coastal plantations into remote interiorforests (see Whitehead, this volume). Ironically, the colonizers were evensuccessful at obtaining the loyalty of Afro-American Maroons in militarycampaigns against other Maroons (see Bilby, this volume). In the colonialperiod, Euramericans created a Hobbesian \"war of all against all\" in whichstrategic considerations of military power and economic forces of materialprofit more often than not outweighed crosscutting ties based on resistance todomination.In a 1991 study of Asháninka uprisings in the lowlands of eastern Peru,"},{"pageContent":"Page 6Michael Brown and Eduardo Fernandez documented a complex variation on theinterethnic relations that developed between indigenous and Afro-Americanpeoples during the colonial period. During the early eighteenth century,Franciscan missionaries brought Afro-American slaves into their Amazonianmission settlements to serve as military defenders against indigenous attacksand uprisings. Black freedmen served as leaders of reprisal raids againstrebellious Asháninka bowmen. When a major uprising began under the leadership ofJuan Santos de Atahualpa in 1742, Afro-American freedmen and slaves switchedtheir allegiance to the Asháninka. Many of Juan Santos's indigenous followerswanted to execute these renegade slaves and freedmen, but Juan Santos overrodetheir sentiments in favor of the Afro-Americans' strategic value in militaryresistance against the Spanish.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]Although Juan Santos saw blacks as an oppressed people . . . , he also had tocontend with their role as occasional killers of Indians. It was probably thetactical skills of blacks . . . that convinced Juan Santos to put aside hisprejudices and welcome them to the rebellion. He could ill afford to spurn theirknowledge of Spanish weapons and fighting techniques. (Brown and Fernandez 1991:49)Also, by the 1740s, several Afro-American freedmen who had lived in the missionsfor many years had taken Asháninka wives and had thus become affinal relativesof the Asháninka (Brown and Fernandez 1991: 48).Juan Santos was an indigenous highlander from Cuzco and was thus well suited tofit the mythic role of King Inca in an Asháninka messianic movement. Thealliance of indigenous and Afro-American peoples under his command was able tosuccessfully resist Spanish military forays into the eastern lowlands during the1740s and 1750s. However, Juan Santos's messianic movement never stabilized intolong-term processes of ethnogenesis, since he mysteriously died and his movementhad disappeared by the late 1750s. Nevertheless, the story of Juan Santos'sbrief rise to power in the 1740s demonstrates how Afro-American and indigenouspeoples were able to overcome their mutual suspicions as well as the colonialforces that set them in adversarial relations.In the interior regions of North and South America, away from the diaspora ofenslaved and escaped Afro-American peoples in southern North America, theCaribbean Basin, and coastal South America, the late eighteenth century was aperiod of intensified geopolitical competition among waning colonial powers andmajor challenges to the survival of indigenous peoples. On the southern Plainsof North America, the Jumano faced new political and economic pressures from theApache, Comanche, and other southwestern peoples during the eighteenth century.In order to take advantage of French"},{"pageContent":"Page 7trade networks to the east and north, some Jumano groups formed new relations oftrade with indigenous groups of the northern and central Plains (see Hickerson,this volume). These shifting patterns of interethnic relations and colonialpower gave rise to the modern Kiowa.In the interior of lowland South America, the eighteenth century was a period ofmassive depopulation among indigenous peoples who had survived the diseases andwarfare of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Portuguese slave tradersremoved an estimated 20,000 indigenous people from the Upper Rio Negro region inthe 1740s and 1750s, and the campaign of forced relocations to downstreamlocations, called descimentos (descents), further weakened indigenous peoples ofthe Amazonian interior in the last half of the century. In response to thesePortuguese expansions into headwater regions of the Amazon Basin, the Spanishsent military expeditions and missionaries from the Andean highlands and thenorthern lowlands. As Spanish and Portuguese forces vied for control over theUpper Rio Negro region and its indigenous inhabitants, Arawakan peoplestemporarily abandoned their ancestral lands along the Rio Negro and its majortributaries in order to flee to the relative safety of remote headwater areas tothe south and west. These migrations forced Arawakan peoples to develop new tiesof trade and alliance with the eastern Tukanoan peoples of the Vaupés River (seeHill, this volume). In the process, both Arawakan and Tukanoan peoples wereforced to develop new forms of sociolinguistic and political organization, andnew ethnolinguistic groups came into being along the boundary between Arawakanand Tukanoan territories.The Rise of Independent States and the Geopoliticization of Indigenous AmericanIdentitiesThe essays in this volume build upon a number of recent studies that have brokenaway from past notions of indigenous American peoples as a conglomeration ofstatic, isolated societies that were totally unequipped to deal with the massivechanges set in motion during the colonial period (see, for example, Turner 1988;Whitten 1985, 1988; Wright and Hill 1986; Hill 1988; Whitehead and Ferguson1992). In his anthropological vision of global history, Eric Wolf (1982) clearedthe way for the emergence of critical historical approaches to ethnogenesis byreplacing the earlier anthropological concept of precolonial America as acollection of isolated cultures, or ''billiard balls,\" with a more sophisticatedunderstanding of widespread regional systems of trade, warfare, and interethnicalliances. More recently, Whitehead and Ferguson (1992) advanced the concept of\"tribal zone\" as a sphere of interaction in which state-level expansion reducesmultilingual, multicultural regional networks to territorially discrete,culturally and linguistically homogeneous"},{"pageContent":"Page 8\"tribes.\" South Americanists replaced the Lévi-Straussian notion of Amerindiansocieties as \"cold,\" \"mythic,'' and ahistorical with a number of case studiesdemonstrating that indigenous Amazonian and Andean peoples had alreadyformulated dynamic ways of understanding their historical pasts and that theywere capable of transforming these indigenous modes of historical interpretationinto coherent understandings of Europeans and their alien forms of disease,technology, and governance (Hill 1988). The essays in the present volume onethnogenesis in the Americas continue in these recent and ongoing historicalapproaches and broaden them to include parallel developments in NorthAmericanist and Afro-Americanist studies.In the context of this growing rapprochement between anthropology and historythat has so strenuously argued against linear, oppositional models ofinterethnic relations between states and indigenous (or Afro-American)minorities, the editors of a recent book entitled Nation-States and Indians inLatin America (Urban and Sherzer 1992) have resurrected the ahistorical notionof a fundamental contrast between \"isolated Indian populations\" and \"ethnicgroups.\" \"Indians within Latin America can be located on a continuum fromisolated, uncontacted Indian populations to full-fledged ethnic groups, on a parwith other recognized ethnic groups within the nation-state\" (Urban and Sherzer1992: 5). This manner of setting up the issue brings back to life olderdichotomies, such as traditional versus modern or pristine versus acculturated,under the new terminology of isolated Indian population versus ethnic group.Ethnicity, and hence also ethnogenesis and ethnocide, only comes into beingafter isolated Indian populations have become situated within states as interestgroups that to some degree \"accede to state sovereignty\" (Urban and Sherzer1992: 4). This linear model, or continuum, is intrinsically ahistorical andcontributes to the reification of \"Indians\" as a category of peoples existingoutside state-level political organizations and \"ethnic groups\" as indigenouspeoples who have given up their cultural identities in proportion to the degreethat they have accepted citizenship within Euro-American states. Extrapolatingfrom this linear model of change back to precolonial times, the Americas appearas a checkerboard dotted with a myriad of isolated Indian populations (i.e.,Wolf's billiard balls) which only came to develop a higher level of historicaland ethnic consciousness through being incorporated into European or Euramericanstates. Even a cursory reading of Albers's essay on the northeastern Plains ofNorth America, Whitehead's account of colonial Surinam, Hickerson's essay onKiowa ethnogenesis, or Hill's essay on northwestern Amazonia is sufficient tocast great doubt on the notion that precolonial America consisted of suchisolated Indian populations. The concept of isolated Indian populations morefaithfully reflects a Europocentric historical perspective on the Americas thanthe vast multilingual, mul-"},{"pageContent":"Page 9ticultural regional networks that had developed prior to the Europeans' arrivalin the Americas.A typologizing model that starts out from the assumption of a basic dichotomybetween isolated Indian populations and ethnic groups cannot be transformed at alater stage into a fully historical understanding of cultural identities, nomatter how much special pleading to the effect that \"none of the terms in ourtitle, Indians, nation-states, and culture, are monolithic and staticcategories, but dynamic, in that they are constantly changing and adapting\"(Urban and Sherzer 1992: 12). Urban and Sherzer recognize the fact thatnation-state is a culturally specific concept of political organization that hasan ambivalent relationship to cultural differences. They are also fully aware ofthe artificiality of the category \"Indian\": \"Until the arrival of Europeans,there were no 'Indians.' The concept is a European invention\" (1992: 12).However, just when Urban and Sherzer approach the brink of addressing therelations between states and indigenous peoples in a more complex, historicalmanner, they revert back to asserting that \"a most fruitful way to conceive ofthe emergent quality of nation-state and Indian relationships is in terms of acontinuum from Indian population to ethnic group'' (1992: 1213).If such terms as \"nation-states\" and \"Indians\" are merely artificial Europeaninventions, then why do the editors insist on preserving and promoting theseterms not only in the title but as analytical concepts underpinning theirtheoretical model? One possible answer is that the promotion of a linear,dichotomous model of Indians and nation-states allowed the editors to circumventthe more challenging task of questioning relations of power as these havehistorically developed within and among indigenous American societies and intheir interethnic relations with expanding European and Euramerican states. Todo so would reveal the categorical term \"Indian\" to be not only a Europeaninvention but one that was, and still is, part of a broader process ofsymbolically removing indigenous American peoples from their histories andreducing them to stereotypic symbols of isolation and alienation from thecolonial and independent states of the Americas.Looking at the other end of the continuum, or ethnic groups situated within thestate, the dichotomous model supports the dangerous misunderstanding thatcultural differences among indigenous peoples are \"potentially threatening tothe sovereign jurisdiction of the state\" (Urban and Sherzer 1992: 12). How andwhy such cultural differences pose a threat to state sovereignty are not evenraised as questions, much less answered. Colonial and independent states in theAmericas have always and everywhere encompassed a diversity of indigenous andother ethnic groups, and history provides no examples of this diversitythreatening state sovereignty (although examples of the converse abound). By theend of the colonial period and the rise of inde-"},{"pageContent":"Page 10pendent states in the late eighteenth to early nineteenth centuries, indigenousAmerican peoples had been so marginalized and demographically reduced that theycould hardly be seen as a threat to state sovereignty. In the United States, thenineteenth century saw the reduction of 600,000 indigenous Americans to only250,000 by 1900. \"Meanwhile, the non-Indian population of the U.S. increasedfrom about 5 million in 1800 to about 63 million in 1890 to over 75 million in1900\" (Thornton 1987: 133). How could anyone perceive a mere quarter of amillion indigenous survivors of the Great Dying, divided into separate peoplesand widely separated territories at the peripheries of Euramerican politicalpower, as a threat to national sovereignty in such historical contexts? 9Population figures for indigenous peoples of lowland South America werecomparable to those in North America during the nineteenth century. The totalindigenous population in 1800 for all areas of what was soon to become therepublic of Venezuela had fallen to a mere 258,000, a number which posed no realthreat to the predominantly European, Afro-American, and mestizo majority (Grau1987: 6466). Throughout the northern lowlands of South America, the War ofIndependence and subsequent rise of independent liberal states created a powervacuum in which large landowners and mestizo colonists expanded into indigenousterritories which the Catholic Church had formerly protected and managed. In thenineteenth century, the expansion of national states into the northern lowlandsoverwhelmed indigenous peoples in coastal and llano areas or forced them to seekrefuge in inaccessible forests or across international borders. Thesemarginalized groups of people lost their communal lands under new national lawsmandating privatization of land ownership. Such refugees can only be understoodas isolated Indian populations whose continued existence is \"potentiallythreatening to the sovereign jurisdiction of the state\" by removing them fromthe histories of colonial and national state expansion that originally producedtheir contemporary situations.The danger of using ahistorical, linear models that dichotomize nationstates andIndians becomes even more apparent when its terms are applied to thecontemporary political struggles of indigenous peoples in the Americas. Indiscussing indigenous rights movements in Latin America and the efforts ofinternational organizations such as IWGIA, Survival International, and CulturalSurvival to assist indigenous peoples, Urban and Sherzer assert that \"theattempt by the Indians and their supporters is to deny one of the pillars of thestate, namely, its autonomy with respect to other states\" (1992: 9). This way ofcharacterizing indigenous struggles for control over their lands and otherresources is most unfortunate, since it attributes seditious motives to"},{"pageContent":"Page 11both the members of the movements and their international supporters. 10 Insteadof aiming \"to deny one of the pillars of the state,\" a more reasonableunderstanding of the aims of international groups supporting indigenous peoplesin the Americas is that they are concerned with creating political spaces withinthe state which allow indigenous peoples to regain control over their lands andlocal forms of social organization and thus to have some measure of control overthe manner in which they articulate themselves with national and internationalpolitical orders.From their very inception during the Wars of Independence in North and SouthAmerica, the founders of liberal Euramerican states perceived indigenous peoplesas potential equals only if they could be educated and brought into directrelations with Americans of European descent. The European concept ofnation-state placed indigenous American peoples into a double bind. On the onehand, the liberal state promised civil and legal equality to all citizens withinits borders. On the other hand, the rationalist, assimilationist, andindividualist nature of this promised equality was extremely hostile to theolder colonial policy of granting collective land rights to indigenous peoplesas well as to the continuation of indigenous modes of economic production andsocial organization that had survived into or emerged during the colonialperiod. The rise of independent liberal states in the Americas placed indigenouspeoples into contradictory social statuses: full citizens who received equalrights and lawless savages who must be educated and assimilated into the sociallife of the state.The new nationalist rhetoric masked older colonial beliefs in the racial andcultural inferiority of indigenous and other non-European peoples. The principalarchitect of Latin American democracy, Simón Bolívar, was aware of thesociocultural diversity within Gran Colombia, but ultimately the Great Liberatorhimself could not transcend the racist stereotyping of indigenous and AfricanAmericans so common in the early nineteenth century. \"These gentlemen have notcast their vision over the Caribs of the Orinoco, over the pastoralists ofApure, over the sailors of Maracaibo, over the merchants of Magdalena, over thebandits of Patia, over the indomitable Pastusos, over the Guahibos of theCasanare, and over all the savage hordes from Africa and America who, like malefallow deer, traverse the solitudes of Colombia\" (letter from Simón Bolívar toGeneral Santander, June 13, 1821; quoted in Grau 1987: 114, translation mine).Thus, even as the new republics gave official recognition to the equality of alltheir citizens, they remained rooted in colonialist ideologies of racialhierarchy that placed whites of European descent at the pinnacle of enlightenedreason and African and indigenous Americans into a category of brutish \"savagehordes.\" Throughout the nineteenth cen-"},{"pageContent":"Page 12tury, such racist ideologies and the political turmoil of the postwar periodpermeated the struggles among competing nation-states for control over remoteborder areas and their indigenous inhabitants.The rise of independent states in the Americas failed to create a politicalspace for indigenous peoples to survive and prosper as citizens within thejurisdiction of state sovereignty and as ethnic groups who were culturally andlinguistically different. In their vision of democracy, the founders of Americanstates saw no place for indigenous peoples except as remnants of a vanishingpast (McGuire 1992). The primary reason for this institutionalized blindnesstoward indigenous American peoples was the adoption of the European concept ofnation-state as the model for state formation and expansion in the Americas.In a recent article called \"The Nations of a State,\" Edward Spicer (1992) arguedthat the term nation-state is a misnomer insofar as the ideal model of amonolingual, culturally homogeneous, territorially bounded state has neverexisted, not even among the Europeans, who invented the nation-state concept andwho unleashed it on the Americas and the rest of the world. With the possibleexception of the tiny state of Denmark, modern European states emerged after theRenaissance through the rise of specific ethnic groups, or \"nations,\" topositions of political and economic dominance over a plurality of other ethnicgroups within bounded political territories (Spicer 1992: 33). The term\"nation-state\" obscures the internal cultural and linguistic diversity of statesthat could more accurately be called \"conquest states.\"4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] Whatremained hidden from the makers of state policy was that these peoples wereliving cultural lives of their own, that they had developed languages, or eventhat they spoke anything worthy to be called a language. . . .Either, it came tobe believed, the subordinated peoples were inherently inferior or they mightdemonstrate their worthiness as human beings by discarding their outworn waysand becoming like the dominant peoples. (Spicer 1992: 29)Spicer's approach offers a general vision of the dialectical articulationsbetween ethnic homogenization and differentiation within conquest states, or theongoing tensions between state-level ideologies asserting control overindigenous and other ethnic minorities through cultural assimilation and thepotential resurgence of a plurality of unique ethnic groups within the bordersof a single state.

This process of tribalization(Whitehead and Ferguson 1992), or the geopoliticization of indigenous Americancultural identities, was already in evidence during the colonial period inregions of sustained contact between European and indigenous American peoples.In the course of the nineteenth century, geopoliticization of indigenouscultural identities extended into regions that had continued to develop asmultilingual, multicultural patterns of trade, warfare, and alliance during thecolonial period.The process of simplifying complex regional systems of interethnic overlappings,alliances, and mergers was clearly illustrated during the frontier expansion ofEuramericans in the Great Plains of the United States and Canada. In the regionnorth of the Missouri River, Cree, Ojibwa, and Assiniboin peoples entered intomany different types of interethnic formation during the eighteenth and earlynineteenth centuries. These shifting alliances were based in part on warriorsocieties that allowed Cree, Ojibwa, and Assiniboin peoples great flexibility inecological adaptation to Plains resources as well as historical accommodation tochanging economic patterns of European and U.S. trade (see Albers, this volume).Only after U.S. and Canadian military campaigns and subsequent treaties duringthe 1860s and 1870s did ethnonyms such as Cree and Ojibwa become concretized andassociated with specific territories. As late as the early twentieth century,however, many Cree, Ojibwa, Assiniboin, and other indigenous peoples in northernMontana and North Dakota still remained officially \"landless\" (i.e., withoutofficial trust status in the United States) \"because their hybridized ethnicbackgrounds and identities did not match the picture of the policymakers, whichwas based largely on a notion of tribal blocs with exclusive memberships andterritories\" (Albers, this volume). The picture referred to here is that of theEuropean concept of nation-state, and what was left out of that picture was thetremendous fluidity and sheer magnitude of interethnic relations amongculturally and linguistically differentiated indigenous peoples. 11Although the nation-state model shaped official policies toward indigenousAmerican peoples during the nineteenth century, these official discourses andpractices often masked underlying currents of interethnic complexity thatcontained the seeds for long-term historical renewal and the emergence of newmultilingual regional networks.

The British continued thesystem of Dutch Postholders in the interior but greatly reduced the scale ofgift giving to indigenous leaders (Menezes 1977). Meanwhile, Brazilian merchantsbacked by groups of armed thugs invaded Makushi settlements from the south andrelocated some indigenous communities as forced laborers in agriculturalprojects along the Rio Branco. In this context of marginalization andgeopoliticization, the Makushi and neighboring indigenous peoples created theAlleluia religion, both as a means of resisting Anglican missionaries and as aprocess of reconstituting a multilingual, regional network among Carib-speakingpeoples of the Guiana Shield (see Staats, this volume). As the title of Staats'sessay so aptly phrases the issue, \"fighting in a different way\" has continued toserve as a vital means for building communities and opposing the ethnocidaleffects of gold mining, hydroelectric dam construction, fundamentalist NorthAmerican missionizing, and other manifestations of late-twentieth-century stateexpansion.1992 and the Struggles to Recapture the Historical PastThe double bind of equality at the expense of cultural identity that becameconcretized into nation-state policies during the rise and expansion ofindependent states in the Americas continues to engulf indigenous andAfro-American peoples in the late twentieth century. In contemporary Venezuela,Afro-Americans from the community of Curiepe have attempted to reassert theircultural identity within the state by giving recognition to the militaryimportance of black freedmen and escaped slaves during the War of Independence(see Guss, this volume). What the people of Curiepe are trying to achieve is analternative perspective on history that allows Afro-Venezuelans to have ethnicidentities within a national context that denies the existence, much less thevalue, of such Afro-American identities. Official state ideology masks racialand cultural heterogeneity through \"the myth of racial democracy,\" creating \"adouble bind situation wherein despite racial discrimination, blacks were unableto articulate it as the very category responsible, for this oppression was notrecognized\" (Guss, this volume; Wright 1990). Any individuals or groups whochallenge this official ideology of racial democracy are quickly labeledpolitical troublemakers: \"if race did not exist as a recognizable category inthis colorblind society, then all who spoke of it must be either foreign orsubversive\" (Guss, this volume). The dilemma of Afro-Americans"},{"pageContent":"Page 15in Venezuela is nearly identical to that of indigenous peoples who are caughtbetween the twin ideologies of equality and the denial of racial and culturaldifferences within the state. 12As Guss points out, the people of Curiepe have been doubly removed from theirancestral African cultures, since the majority of Afro-Americans in Venezuelaare descended from slaves brought from islands throughout the Caribbean orescaped slaves who sought refuge on the mainland. Faced with a doublychallenging task of recapturing their history, the people of Curiepe haveappropriately chosen a double-stranded strategy of revitalizing African musicaltraditions and elevating the historical figure of Negro Primero, anAfro-American who gave his life in the War of Independence. This historicalsymbolism neatly finesses the charge that Afro-American cultural identity issubversive or threatening to national sovereignty by integrating Africancultural origins with the political struggles that gave rise to the modernVenezuelan state.In contemporary Ecuador, the leaders of indigenous and Afro-American socialmovements are seeking to move out of their state-defined statuses asmarginalized, inferior peoples through \"counterideologies . . . that seek tospark recognition of the falsity of the hypostatic ideological racialiststructures [of the state]\" (Whitten, this volume). In the confrontational arenaof social opposition to the racial hierarchy of nation-state structure,indigenous demands for self-determination are met with official discoursesportraying the movements as unruly behavior (alzamiento) that threatens nationalsovereignty. As Whitten correctly observes, the flurry of racist and racialistaccusations against the indigenous rebirth (levantamiento) obscures the factthat the movement does not threaten national sovereignty but seeks to unmask theahistorical, racist, and racialist ideologies that have placed indigenous andAfro-American peoples below and outside of the Euramerican dominated state.Again, the movements are not about \"denying one of the pillars of the state\" or\"threatening the sovereign jurisdiction of the state\" (Urban and Sherzer 1992)but about the creation of political spaces, or nations, within the state thatallow people a degree of control over their lands and local forms ofsociopolitical organization. This goal was made explicit in the EcuadorianLevantamiento Indígena of 1990 by the indigenous leaders' demands for aconstitutional change to designate Ecuador as a multinational, multiethnic stateand by their consistent usage of \"indigenous nationalities\" as a term ofself-reference. Their movement aimed at raising the possibility of a new kind ofstate, a nations-state instead of a nation-state, and the regaining ofindigenous self-determination that had been progressively weakened by fivecenturies of colonial and national domination.In the context of this politically charged resurgence of indigenous Ameri-"},{"pageContent":"Page 16can ethnic identities, the 500th anniversary of European domination overindigenous and Afro-American peoples has taken on new symbolic meanings.\"Después de 500 años de dominación, autodeterminación en 1992!\" [After 500 yearsof domination, self-determination in 1992!] (Whitten, this volume). In theindigenous levantamiento, 1992 emerged as an epitomizing symbol for the struggleto break out of static, racialist categories and to carve out new spaces forindigenous and Afro-American peoples within the mainstream of Ecuadorianpolitical culture, no longer down and outside but up and inside. 1992 asepitomizing symbol is a symbolically overdetermined, historical metaphor for\"the idea of people remaking the world and being in a world refashioned from theconquered one that the European 'discovery' . . . of 1492 began\" (Whitten, thisvolume).Drawing upon Comaroff's ethnography (1985) of African resistance to colonialdomination, Whitten interprets the recent indigenous and Afro-American movementsin Ecuador as \"an unending struggle to take possession of the sign\" (Whitten,this volume). It is no coincidence that both indigenous and Afro-Americanpeoples have chosen to focus their political struggles on history. Forindigenous Americans, this semiotic struggle over history focuses on 1992 as ametaphor for half a millennium of conquest, depopulation, enslavement, andmarginalization as well as for the movement to transform this symbol ofethnocidal losses into the creation of new ethnic identities that are notvanishing from the Americas but reasserting their places in history. ForAfro-American peoples, the histories of escaped slaves and freedmen holdprofound significance as models of ethnogenesis in opposition to the brutallyracist, dehumanizing historical roots of the American states. To buildcommunities such as Curiepe or the Maroon societies of Jamaica and Surinam inthe context of such institutionalized racism provides a metaphor for theresilience and spontaneous creativity of Afro-American peoples.The power to control and define the historical past is perhaps the ultimate formof hegemony. Historicide, or the removal of peoples from their histories, isradically disempowering because it obscures the historical processes that haveproduced the racial hierarchies that prevail in the Americas today.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] Eachnation-state saw itself in the center of the stage of history, and chronicleswere written accordingly.

This ordering of the essays is designed to stimulatea comparative, hemispheric understanding of ethnogenesis that transcends thedivisions of cultural anthropologists into geographic areas of specialization.Also, a chronological ordering of essays more faithfully reflects the intrinsichistoricity of ethnogenesis than an arrangement based on spatial proximity.Notes4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 1.For a review of this literature, see Whitten (in press).4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 2.This approach to ethnogenesis builds upon Sider's recent definition ofethnohistory as \"a name for struggles over the production and distribution ofculture and, simultaneously, the existence of a people\" (1994:115).

Significant political contrasts between the trading-plantationsettlements made by the Dutch, English, and French in this region and theterritorial and evangelical ambitions of the Spanish and Portuguese in the restof South America flow over into the relationships that were established betweenAmerindian leaders and the European colonizers, especially during the firstcentury of contact (see also Whitehead 1993b).The importance of these contrasting processes in Iberian and non-Iberiancolonial occupation stems from the fact that such contrasts were critical to theultimate survival, or destruction, of the different ethnic formations that wereoriginally encountered in this area (see Whitehead 1992). By \"ethnic formations\"I mean to indicate the range of native political structures, economic systems,and cultural practices that went together to define the ethnicity of anyparticular group. By retaining this unitary framework for historical analysis itis possible to obviate various intractable theoretical problems as tosociopolitical typology, and we may then speak of the processes of ethnogenesis(and ethnocide), as well as the secondary phenomenon of tribalization (seeWhitehead 1992). Moreover, this allows us to avoid the well-worn narrative tropeof the clash of discrete, insulated \"cultures,\" which produces a caricature ofactual historical process and event. These historical processes of ethnicformation (ethnogenesis) thus involved Europeans, Africans, and Amerindi-"},{"pageContent":"Page 21ans, and the groupings that emerged in the first decades of contact aretherefore distinct from those that were initially encountered.It was in reference to these new social formations, and in view of the demise ofearlier, precontact ones, that we may speak of ethnogenesis and ethnocide. Thisfundamentally means that new group identities were created and old ones fellinto disuse, not necessarily that persons were themselves destroyed or born.Although the question of the demographic impact of these processes is obviouslyimportant (see Whitehead 1988 for a discussion of the Kariña case), this essayis principally concerned with the historical context of how self-representationand the definition of others work as synergetic processes for the formation ofgroup identity.It has been proposed that the Guianas generally have formed a retreat area forAmerindian groups that were threatened by the expansion of the Spanish andPortuguese colonies to the south and north. While this is certainly the case forthe eighteenth century onward, it has been mistakenly assumed that much the samecan be said of the earlier period. In fact, much had already changed among theAmerindians of this region between 1499 and 1681. Those ethnic groups that wehave come to know from the later colonial records and more modern ethnographicaccounts, such as the Carib, Arawak, Wayana, Trio, and others, are not nearly soprominent in the sixteenth-century descriptions, if they are evident at all.This was only partly due to the fact that the Europeans had an incompleteknowledge of the interior regions and relates as much to the fact that theethnic and cultural composition of native Surinam has also undergone some 500years of historical evolution. Just as the modern states of Europe and theAmericas are in some cases recent and unstable creations, so too the ethniccharacter of the peoples of modern Surinam have emerged from earlier ethnicformations, and for this reason it is not possible to simply project thesemodern ethnographic paradigms back into the past. This consideration isunderlined by the recent work on the human ecology of Amazonia (Denevan 1992;Posey and Balée 1989; Roosevelt 1989).It will be the purpose of this chapter to outline the historical conditions ofthis transformation of native Surinam, a process that can be summarized asresulting in a reduction of cultural variety and a general reorientation ofnative political and economic systems toward the coast and away from the uplandsand their contacts with the Amazon Basin. As a result of these twin politicaland economic pressures the range of ethnic self-ascription increasingly narrowedinto either Carib or Arawak identities or allegiances. At the same time thisprocess of indigenous identity re-formation was impacted by the direct effortsof the European colonizers to actively promote stable ethnic groupings with whomthey could profitably interact, as in the use of Amerindians as a mercenarymilitary resource (Whitehead 1990a). Therefore, it will also be nec-"},{"pageContent":"Page 22essary to look at the formation of Surinam as a European colony, since thedistinctiveness of Surinam from the other Dutch colonies of the Atlantic Coast,Berbice and Essequibo, can in large part be attributed to differences in therelationships that developed with the native population in this early contactperiod, a point that colonial historians have overlooked when trying to explainsuch contrasts (Goslinga 1971: 420).One further consequence of the complex nature of ethnogenesis and ethnocide inthis region is an apparent lack of continuity between archaeological,historical, and ethnographic analyses of native societies. On the one hand, itis held that Surinam and the other Guianas were unfavorable environments for thedevelopment of effective agriculture, especially in the upland regions (Evansand Meggers 1960). But on the other hand, the contribution of food-stuffs by theAmerindians to the nascent colonies of the region was considerable, continuous,and critical to their eventual stability. Similarly, in the political sphere,without an appreciation of the past productivity of Amerindian agriculture,early descriptions of powerful chiefdoms in the Surinam region have beendismissed as the exaggerations of glory-seeking colonialists. Careful collationof a range of historical evidence suggests otherwise, however, and it is withdescriptions of the earliest contacts along the Wild Coast, as the Atlanticlittoral of the Guianas was first known, that our account of the ethnictransformation of native Surinam must begin.First Contact: The Destructor ArrivesAlthough Columbus found his \"Antilles,\" en route to Cathay in 1492, he did notreach the southern continent until 1498. It was 1499 before Vicente YáñezPinzón, who had accompanied Columbus on his first voyage, made the first reporton the Wild Coast in the region of Surinam, saying that it was known to thenatives as Paricora. This region had been sighted earlier in the year by theflotillas of Alonso de Hojeda and Amerigo Vespucci, but then, in the ominouswords of Las Casas, \"after Vicente Yáñez, another discoverer, or ratherdestructor, came out in the same month of December 1499 . . . Diego de Lepe\"(1951, 2: 158, translation mine).The low-lying mangrove coast of this part of northern South America offered noobvious haven or entrepôt for the further exploration of the interior. As aresult, the discoveries taking place in the Caribbean and around its littoralsufficiently preoccupied the Europeans over the succeeding decades, and nosettlement was attempted in this region. Indeed, the Amazon itself was virtuallyunknown until the 1540s, and the Orinoco was not occupied until the 1590s,despite its proximity to the prosperous colonies of the northern Venezuelancoast and Antilles."},{"pageContent":"Page 23As a result of these circumstances, our knowledge of the native societies of theregion is largely intermittent for the first hundred years. But by the sametoken, the information dating from the 1590s onward illumines the character of astill autonomous native polity and economy as it grappled with the indirecteffects of European occupations in the Caribbean and the southern littoral ofBrazil, where the French, Dutch, and Portuguese were also active (see Whitehead1993a). Nonetheless, the regional interconnections between native societies inthe Guianas indicate that this was only a relative autonomy, and it should notbe thought that the effects of European intrusion were not also manifest in theevolution of those groups on the periphery of initial contacts (Whitehead 1988:7381). Given the relatively late occupation of this region, the nature of theearly European ethnology along the Wild Coast was often explicitly historical incharacter. This ethnographic interest was a direct result of the need tounderstand and cultivate native alliances in order to offset the existingSpanish presence in the Orinoco Basin and the Caribbean.For the same reasons, Spanish historical sources are less ethnographicallyexplicit, not just because the Spanish lacked an incentive to gather highlydetailed information but also because they simply neglected to investigate thisarea. Nevertheless, the native regional links that connected the Amazon andOrinoco Basins, via the Rupununi savannas in the east and the Casiquiarewatershed in the west, meant that at least diplomatic relations were necessarywith the more eminent chiefs, known as adumasi, of the Wild Coast (Whitehead1994). Such relationships were critical to Spanish efforts in settling thenorthern coast of Venezuela because of the role of the adumasi in supplyingfoodstuffs to the booming pearl fisheries on Margarita and the realization thatnative economic and political systems spread far into the interior of thecontinent.It is probably because of its importance in these regional trade links that theriver Surinam was so named by the Amerindians. In the language of the Karipuna(Island Carib), who habitually raided the aruacas (Arawak) for caracoli (goldenartifacts), Sulinama was the country and river which gave access to the Amazon(Goeje 19311932: 519), as it was also a manufacturing site for the famousAmazon-stones, or takua (Boomert 1987: 4041). This upland link to the AmazonBasin was also well known to the early Dutch traders, such as Amos vanGroenewegen and Hendrickson, \"merchants in those parts 27 years in quality afactor, with the upland Indians of Guiana\" (Harlow 1925: 133). Dutch tradersalso participated in the exchange of steel tools for gold ornaments, usingSurinam as their entrepôt (Purchas 1906: 409). This was probably managed withthe Manoa of the Rio Negro acting as intermediaries for the sources of Amazongold as far as the Rupununi savannas, the trade"},{"pageContent":"Page 24then being taken up by the Arawak (probably the Lokono) to the east and intoSurinam proper (Edmundson 1906; Whitehead 1990a). This strategic position in aregional network of elite exchange was an economic basis for the political powerof the Lokono adumasi in the early colonial era. Such interconnections over theGuiana Shield were quickly exploited by English, Irish, and Dutch traders fromboth the Guiana coast and Amazon Basin. For the Spanish the limited nature ofthis trade was outweighed by the search for military achievement and easy wealthin Peru and Colombia. Nonetheless, it is from the Spanish sources that the firstdirect and substantive information concerning the Amerindians of the Surinamregion comes.Information was first collected in 151920 for the Spanish crown by thelicenciado Figueroa which vaguely indicated that aruacas were widely settled onthe Wild Coast to the south of Orinoco. Some thirty years later, this region wasmore clearly described by Martin Lopez and again in the period 1560 to 1575 byJuan de Salas, Antonio Barbudo, and Rodrigo de Navarrete. These accounts relatethat the Corentyn River formed the eastern limits of this Provincia de losAruacas and describe a distinctly organized stratified group with a highlyproductive subsistence base. Rodrigo de Navarrete wrote that \"it is well knownthat in their country no want of provision is felt [and] at the end of [each]month . . . two thousand loads of Cacabi [cassava bread] can be supplied, eachload being more than two arrobas [= 50 lb./23 kg]. Thus they have frequentlyassisted us, and even at the present day they relieve the hunger of the peopleof that island [Margarita]\" (CDI 18641885, 21: 221239, translation mine). It isalso noted that they grew maize and sweet potatoes, highlighting this use of anintensive agricultural system, reflected archaeologically in the form of variousraised field and mound sites in ancestral Lokono territories (Boomert 1980;Versteeg 1985).Aside from evidence of a highly productive economic base, there are strongindications that these aruacas operated a complex social system involving, forexample, a shamanic elite, the Cemetu, who \"recount the traditions and exploitsof their ancestors and great men and also narrate what those ancestors heardfrom their forefathers . . . and in like manner they recount or preach aboutevents relating to the heavens, sun, moon, and stars . . . Indeed, I considerthat in many respects they are better acquainted with all those phenomena ofnature, which the Christians hold in so much account, than we are\" (CDI18641885, 21: 225226, translation mine).Clearly, in a cultural sense, this group was ancestral to the Arawak (Lokono) oftoday. But the antiquity of the aruaca identity in this region is uncertaingiven both the contemporary testimony of the aruacas, as well as that of theEuropeans. According to these accounts, \"they came from the east in some ships,sailed all along that coast . . . and made friendship With the caribes"},{"pageContent":"Page 25that then possessed them. Noticing in time that the caribes were badneighbors . . . they were against them, and after long and bloody wars succeededfrom driving them out of the rivers [in the east] and remaining masters of thecountry, firmly establishing themselves therein\" (CDI 18641885, 21: 222223,translation mine).The Europeans certainly played a role in this process, especially in theEssequibo and Surinam region, and so it should be appreciated, as in the case ofthe caribes, that even these early aruacas are not a simple equivalent of theLokono of today. As the origin histories of the modern Lokono make clear (ImThurn 1883: 175186), they represent an alliance of clans and lineages, such asthe Neekeari, Sceawani, and Panapi. These lineages differed somewhat in theirnatal language, as well as in their political orientations toward both eachother and the Europeans. In this light a significant force for their unity asaruacas, under Lokono leadership, as paralleled by the caribes under Kariñaleadership, was the profitable economic and political relations that the Lokonoadumasi engineered with the Europeans. In short, the adumasi of the Lokono wereamong the most successful leaders in negotiating the pitfalls of the alienpolitical conditions that the Europeans had created. More obdurate, or lesspliant, groups such as the Yao, Suppoyo, Nepoyo, and Paragoto, despite theirearly importance in native political life, were eclipsed first by Spanishsupport for the aruacas and then by Dutch, French, and English alliances withboth the aruacas and caribes (Whitehead 1990a, 1992).Further complicating the identification of ethnic continuities between historicAmerindian groups and those in modern Surinam were cultural connections with theArawakan groups of the Antilles, as well as this rise of the caribes as asignificant native political force. Cultural connections to the Antilles areshown in the fact that the Arawakan Karipuna, referred to as Ipaio (i.e.,\"islanders\" from Dominica), as well as Carepini in the early sources, weresettled from the region of the Corentyn to the Malmanoury River in FrenchGuiana. This has in itself considerably complicated the certain identificationof Cariban groups, since the similarity of the name Carepini to caribe meansthat the early European sources often fail to distinguish this group from theKariña. Further compounding these errors of identification, later sources,including modern ethnography, have perpetuated this confusion by referring tothe Karipuna as Island Carib, which they certainly were not (see Whitehead1995).At the same time, the caribes, under Kariña leadership, developed extensivetrade partnerships with the Europeans, thereby becoming very influential in thenative economy, bringing many smaller or less well positioned ethnic groups,such as the Arawakan Karipuna, into dependent relationships, giving them theircharacter as caribes (Whitehead 1988). The overall result of the interplay ofthese factors was that the Europeans lost sight of the more subtle"},{"pageContent":"Page 26ethnic distinctions between Amerindian groups, tending to lump all groupstogether as either aruacas or caribes. In this way both native self-ascriptionand the ethnological definitions generated by European colonialism workedtogether to cement the contrasting identities of aruaca and caribe into thenative political networks of the whole northern South America region.Since the Karipuna from the Caribbean islands straddled this tidy Europeandistinction, by virtue of their Arawakan linguistic and cultural base but caribepolitical and military orientation, they became known as the Island Carib,notwithstanding the continued existence of satellite settlements on themainland. But as the complexity of the foregoing explanation suggests, there isa continuing debate as to their role in the history of Amerindian politics inSurinam (see Allaire 1980; Boomert 1984, 1986, 1995; Hoff 1995; Whitehead 1995).While the conflict of Carib (caribes) and Arawak (aruacas) has been an importantnarrative theme in the history of Surinam Amerindians, it cannot be simplyequated with a conflict between Lokono and Kariña. Many other ethnic groups, nowdisappeared, were involved in this historical outcome, while the Europeansthemselves exploited such emergent divisions among the Amerindians for their ownpurposes. As a result, the myriad of group identities referred to in theearliest accounts (e.g., Purchas 1906: 396) had all but disappeared by themiddle of the seventeenth century, having been overshadowed by Spanish allianceswith the aruacas in the sixteenth century.One particularly good example of this process of ethnocide taking place in acontext of regional ethnogenesis is the case of the Yao. According to thetestimony of one of their chiefs, Wareo, reproduced by Lawrence Keymis,4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] hewas lately chased by the Spaniards from Moruca [River]; and that having burnthis own houses, and having destroyed his fruits and gardens, he had left hiscountry to be possessed by the Arwaccas, who . . . for the most part serve andfollow the Spaniards. He showed me that he was of the nation of Iaos, who are amighty people and of late time were Lords of all the sea coast as far asTrinidad, which they likewise possessed. However, when the Spaniards first beganto borrow some of their wives, they all agreed to change their habitation and donow live united for the most part towards the river of the Amazons. (1596: 4)Some of these refugee Yao settled between the Cottica River and the mouth of theMaroni, where they formed towns with the Paragoto and Arawak. Although other Yaoexiles were briefly dominant in the Oyapok region, both here and in Surinam theysubsequently fade from the historical record. Whether this ethnic extinction wasmatched by a demographic one is unclear, as they may well have been absorbed asaffines on one or the other side of the"},{"pageContent":"Page 27emergent Carib-Arawak hegemony. Whatever the case, their fate stands as a starkexample of those processes of ethnocide and ethnogenesis that were occurringthroughout the region at the start of the seventeenth century.Trade and SettlementThe first traders and settlers in Surinam thus entered a complex politicalsituation that was not resolved to the Europeans' satisfaction until theconclusion of the Indian War of 1681, which marked the definitive establishmentof a Dutch Surinam.In the interim, Surinam was the venue for intercolonial rivalry between theFrench, English, and Dutch. In these conflicts the Amerindians sometimes playeda critical role as auxiliary troops (Whitehead 1990a), as they had done inconsenting to settlement and trade in the first place. The Europeans soonrealized that Lokono and Kariña leaders were particularly receptive to thesepurposes, and so, as mentioned above, it was they who came to dominate relationswith the colonial authorities. Later in the seventeenth century this was to leadto formal treaties of peace and the exemption from slavery of those whoparticipated in the Carib and Arawak identities. Those Amerindians that were notpart of this status quo, such as the Paragoto and Suppoyo, tended to retreatfrom the coastal zone into the uplands, where their lack of a politicalconnection to the European coastal zone meant they became the target of Arawakor Carib slavers supplying the burgeoning sugar plantations.Until 1626 central Surinam was not a favored site for colonization within thiscoastal zone, the Oyapok, Cayenne, Maroni, Berbice, and Essequibo Rivers beingpreferred by the first Spanish, French, and English interlopers. In 1626,according to the manuscript of Major John Scott, a colony of some 500 men andwomen from La Rochelle was established on the Saramacca River but was desertedin 1629, \"sickness falling amongst them and the Indians being troublesome.\" Tenyears later the French returned to the Saramacca with nearly 400 persons, andalthough \"they lived peaceably until the year 1642 . . . they grew careless,spread themselves to [the] Surinam [River] and Corentyn [River], had greatdifferences with the Indians, and were all cut off in one day.\" Hard on theheels of this disaster, the English brought out a further 300 families in 1643who settled on the Surinam, Saramacca, and Corentyn Rivers and \"lived peaceablyuntil the year 1645, at which time they espoused the quarrel of the French andwere cut off by the natives.\" The French made one further attempt at settlingthe Saramacca, but the \"greater part were cut off by the Careebs and Saepoyes[Suppoyo] Anno 1649\" (Harlow 1925: 141, 142).Contemporary with these efforts at the settlement of Surinam was theintermittent establishment of Dutch trading posts on the Surinam River, pos-"},{"pageContent":"Page 28sibly entailing also some clearing of the land for sugar plantations on theMaroni and Commewine Rivers (Goslinga 1971:419). It will easily be appreciatedthen that the disposition of the native population, as much physical aspolitical, was a key element in the survival or destruction of these firstcolonies. By midcentury this was summarized by Scott as follows: \"In Surinam,Commewine, Saramacca, Copename and Corentyn are about 5000 Careeb families, andthere lives in Saramacca and the upper parts of Surinam about 1400 Turroomacs[Taruma] and up the Corentyn about 1200 Sapoyes. From the west side of Corentynto Wina [Waini River] there live about 8000 families of Arawagoes, the besthumoured Indians in America\" (Harlow 1925: 137).Although, as we have seen, the Suppoyo and Paragoto were still of somesignificance in the calculations of the colonizers, it is also evident that bythis time the political preeminence of the Arawak and Carib had become wellestablished. Accordingly, it is the development of adversarial identitiesbetween the Arawak and Carib which dominates native history in the latter partof the seventeenth century. It was in the context of Dutch and English rivalryover possession of the Surinam colony that the political and economic conditionswere created for the emergence of relatively monolithic native power blocs underthe control of coastal Arawak and Carib leaders.As might be directly inferred from Scott's account of Amerindian settlement, theCarib were located far more extensively in Surinam than the Arawak. Yet it wasthe Arawak who were eventually to win the favor of the colonial authorities. Thehostility of the Carib to almost all European settlement in their territories isevident enough from the successive failure of the various colonies up to the1650s, and in fact this hostility never really ceased. Permanent settlement wasonly finally achieved as a result of the direct military and economic dominationof the Carib population, facilitated by the military support of the Arawak fromthe Corentyn River.In 1650, some 300 people were landed on the Surinam and Commewine Rivers underthe command of Anthony Rowse, \"a gentleman of great gallantry and prudence, andof long experience in the West Indies. His making a firm peace with the Indianssoon after his landing, and reviving the name of Sir Walter Ralegh, gave theEnglish firm footing in those parts, and it soon became a hopeful colony\"(Harlow 1925: 142). According to Francis Willoughby, who initiated thiscolonization, \"the gentleman which I sent [Rowse] hath brought with him to metwo of the Indian kings, having spoken with several of them, who are willing toreceive our nation, and that we should settle amongst them\" (quoted inWilliamson 1923: 153). Still extant in 1660, the English colony then adopted thename Willoughby-Land in recognition of Francis Willoughby's financialinvestment.Despite this positive diplomatic beginning, contemporary descriptions of"},{"pageContent":"Page 290029-01.GIF [434c8f86285c352d6762448d0be22f74.gif]Figure 1.The Wild Coast, ca. 1650.the English colony indicate that there was little cooperation from either side.Unlike the Arawak, who supplied the Spanish, the Carib appear to have givenlittle assistance in fishing or hunting, while the upland groups remainedaltogether hostile (Warren 1667: 38). This is quite understandable in view ofthe English opinion of the Amerindians as ''a People [who are] Cowardly andTreacherous, qualities inseparable\" (Warren 1667: 23). Moreover, the economicorientation of the colony to sugar production meant that, in contrast toEssequibo, where direct trade with the Amerindians was the basis of a colonialeconomy, there was no real incentive to cultivate alliances with the Carib.In 1665 Lord Willoughby himself arrived in the colony. \"In the same year, and inthe month of May, was this colony in its meridian, and after this month had itsdeclination and went ever retrograde\" (Harlow 1925: 199). This was caused by thefirst recorded epidemic in the colony, originating in the jointly settledEuropean/Amerindian town of Torarica. Notwithstanding this and the \"strangejealousies that possessed the inhabitants,\" various attacks were launchedagainst the neighboring Dutch settlements on the Approuage, Pomeroon, andEssequibo in pursuance of the second Anglo-Dutch War of 16651667. Although alocal neutrality was initially agreed between the French and"},{"pageContent":"Page 30English, eventually the English were also ordered to attack the French at theSinnamary and Cayenne Rivers, following the entry of the French on the Dutchside in the war in January 1666.As we have seen, the local Carib did not actively oppose the English, but thesupport of the Arawak for the Dutch and French seems to have been far moreimportant. In response to the threat of a joint raid by the Arawak and Dutchfrom the Berbice River, the English attacked two Arawak \"ware-houses,\" probablythe fortifications at Ouden-Amen and Naby villages between the Demerara andBerbice Rivers; altogether some thirty Arawak were killed and seventy captured.As a result, contingents of Arawak assisted the French and Dutch in retaking theforts at Pomeroon and Essequibo. In Pomeroon the French \"most inhumanelydelivered them [English prisoners] to the cruelty of the Arawaks at the mouth ofthat river to be massacred\" (Harlow 1925: 203).Meanwhile, the Surinamese colony fared worse, in the words of Governor WilliamByam: \"in August, God's Justice most sharply visited our transgressions, thesickness spreading throughout the colony\" (Harlow 1925: 203). The indifferenceof the local Carib to the fate of the English colony, enhanced by itsfast-deteriorating condition, stands in contrast to the persistent support ofthe Arawak for the Dutch in Berbice, Essequibo, and Pomeroon. Certainly some ofthe local Carib served as paddlers for the pirogues and even joined the Englishtroops with \"bundles of war-arrows\" (Harlow 1925: 211), but lack of provisionsmeant they retired to their villages within a few days.Such was the scene when in February 1667 the Dutch admiral Abraham Crijnssenappeared with a fleet before the fort of Paramaribo and demanded the Englishsurrender. After Governor Byam refused, the Dutch attacked the followingmorning. A sharp fight followed, but the English surrendered. Significantly, thearticles of capitulation recognized the role of the Amerindians in theserivalries. Article 11 states: \"that the Charibees, our neighbours, shall be usedcivilly: & that care shall be taken, that we, & our estates shall not be damagedby the Dutch, French or other Indian nations\" (Harlow 1925: 218, emphasis mine).Since the petition sent to Willoughby from the Assembly of the Colony of Surinamjust prior to this attack makes explicit reference to the \"fear of invasion ofthe Arawaca Indians, who will effect such mischief, as will consequently producethe inevitable ruin of us all,\" it seems clear that the advent of Dutch rule inSurinam would lead to the promotion of a corresponding dominance of their Arawakallies over the local Carib.Although the English actually retook the colony six months later, Sir JohnHarman forcing the surrender of the Dutch on October 7, 1667, Articles 3 and 6of the Treaty of Breda required that the colony be handed back to the Dutch. TheEnglish gained New York (New Amsterdam) in return. The definitive"},{"pageContent":"Page 31establishment of the Dutch in Surinam then completed the process of ethnictransformation that had been initiated by the English.The Dutch ConquestThe \"firm peace\" that had been made with the Carib and the limited nature of thedemands that the English colony, \"planted at a distance and alone\" (Oxenbridge,in Williamson 1923: 162) from the Carib, had made on the Amerindians meant thatthey had been relatively indifferent to its seizure by the Dutch. However, theArawak clans that moved into Surinam under Dutch protection, particularly theSchotje, threatened to marginalize the powerful Carib chiefs of the Corentyn,Copename, Surinam, and Maroni Rivers. The ex-governor, William Willoughby, whohad taken up his brother's titles after he had been lost at sea in a hurricanein 1666, belatedly tried to remedy this situation by commissioning one MajorNeedham to lead a punitive expedition against the Arawak in Corentyn andBerbice, pointedly referring to the torture of English prisoners by the Arawak\"by the instigation of the Dutch\" (CSP, Colonial Series, 16611668, no. 1812).However, diplomatic protests to Willoughby by Crijnssen prevented the executionof this plan, which Willoughby then disowned. Contemporary sources record that4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] atthe end of May arrived Serj.-Major Wm. Nedham [sic] and 20 Englishmen in a sloopwith a commission from the Gov. of Barbados [William Willoughby] to actsomething upon the natives of this coast; whereupon the Dutch seized the vesseland sent Nedham and his company to Zeeland. This made some desirous to extricatethemselves from the colony, and Major Banister in particular demanded a licenceto leave the colony with all his estate, which Crynsens [sic] denied. (CSP,Colonial Series, 16611668, no. 1814)Although it was now in the interest of the Dutch conquerors to promote peacebetween the Arawak and Carib, which Crijnssen certainly attempted, it wasdisingenuous of him to suggest that it was only the English who promoteddivision between the Carib and Arawak (Archief Staten van Zeeland, 2035, No. 22,fol. 186). As we have seen, both the Dutch and French also promoted divisionamong the Amerindian population where it served their interests. Crijnssen foundhe was unable to ignore past conflicts, and, following further incidents such asdisputes between the Carib and Dutch traders on the Copename in 1675, openconflict with the Carib followed in 1678.Undoubtedly these problems were aggravated by the lack of competent leadershipafter the departure of Crijnssen (Buve 1966: 1617). In addition, there wereattempts by William Willoughby and the other dons of Barbados to seduce theplanters of Surinam to leave, as had happened even when the colony was English,since Barbados and Surinam plantations competed in the"},{"pageContent":"Page 32production of sugar (CSP, Colonial Series, 16611668, no. 577). The result ofthese overtures was that the white population steadily declined, presenting theCarib with a picture of decay that paralleled the deterioration of the Englishsettlement just prior to Crijnssen's raid. Not surprisingly, Carib leaders sawthis as an opportunity to rid themselves of the Dutch along with their Arawakallies.In the latter part of 1678, the Carib attacked the European settlements atPirica, Commewine, Torarica, and Para Creek, encouraging the black slaves towreck the sugar mills and desert the plantations. This dealt a most effectiveblow to the already weakened colonial economy, and the Jewish and Englishplanters damored to be allowed to leave for Barbados immediately.As Buve notes, in the middle of this chaos a new governor, Johannes Heinsius,arrived in December 1678 (1966: 17). He acted quickly, reinforcing the fort atParamaribo and sending small detachments to Para Creek and Torarica. He alsoforbade the planters to leave and tried to reassure them as to the stability ofthe Dutch government by requesting reinforcements from the Netherlands. As theselevies would take some time to arrive, he meanwhile tried to organize anegercorp from among the slaves. He also encouraged the Arawak from Berbice,under the command of Lucas Caudri, to join him in a joint attack on the Carib inthe Para Creek area and along the Saramacca, with a second coordinate Arawakforce, under their adumasi Warray, attacking the Carib in the Copename River.Neither of these expeditions was particularly successful in achieving itsmilitary aims. In both cases the Arawak eventually refused to fight, clearlysuggesting that the hostility of Carib and Arawak was very much a product ofthese European conflicts, rather than their cultural differences. In any case,as was discussed earlier, these identities as Arawak or Carib were themselvesrelatively recent and so obscured the heterogeneity of the ethnic origins oftheir members (see Whitehead 1990a).Unable to simply play off Carib and Arawak, Heinsius pursued the policy ofkeeping up the military patrols of Dutch plantations, while trying by diplomaticmeans to divide the Carib settled in the central regions from those to the eastin the Corentyn region and to the west in the Maroni area. In this endeavor hewas reasonably successful, being permitted by the Carib chief Annassabo toconstruct a fort on the Corentyn in early 1679 and receiving a contingent oftwenty warriors from the formerly hostile chief Tonay, thanks to theintervention of Annassabo (see Buve 1966: 2022; Lichtveld and Voor-hoeve 1980:5561).Such overtures initially were less successful in the Maroni region since theactivities of the bokkenruylders (Indian traders), always a difficult element to"},{"pageContent":"Page 33control for the colonial authorities throughout the Guianas, had alienated theCarib. However, once agreement was reached that certain named traders would notbe allowed into the Carib villages again, permission was given to construct afort at the junction of the Cottica and Commewine. This site was chosen in orderto inhibit communication between the Carib of the central regions of Surinam andthose of the Maroni River.In April 1680 reinforcements of regular troops arrived from the Netherlands,effectively signaling an end to the need to further cultivate the outlying Caribcommunities. Although Heinsius died in July of this year, his strategy ofattacking the Copename, Surinam, and Saramacca Carib only after having firstsecured the neutrality of the eastern and western groups was maintained by hissuccessors (Buve 1966: 2223). The fact that they now had European troops attheir disposal also meant that there was no need to rely exclusively on Arawakassistance.Those Carib that surrendered were well treated, not least because Carib aid torunaway slaves opened up the specter of a combined Amerindian and slaverebellion that could have overwhelmed the Dutch, as it nearly did in Berbicesome ninety years later. However, the further pacification of the Corentyn Caribin 1684 and the resultant isolation of the Maroni chiefs meant that Dutch rulewas never again explicitly challenged in Surinam.ConclusionIt will be appreciated then that the subsequent evolution of political andeconomic relationships between the Dutch and Amerindians was heavily conditionedby the events of the first two centuries of contact. In certain areas thehistory of this period remains frustratingly opaque, especially when thecontinuous story of particular identities or individuals is sought. However, thesame is often true as regards the history of European colonialism in the region,so the absence of certain kinds of information is not in itself fatal tohistorical study of native society and culture.Furthermore, this period was one of often extreme and rapid change for thenative population, so the apparent inconsistencies and unevenness of thehistorical information may be said to reflect this fact, rather than the generalunreliability of this kind of evidence, as has sometimes been assumed (Meggersand Evans 1957: 583589; Meggers 1992). In such a context the search forcontinuities between ethnic formations in the archaeological, historical, andmodern eras is as much a contemporary political concern as it is a scientificone, just as the search for European tribal origins was undertaken to bolsterthe ideology of the nation-state.This essay should not therefore be taken to indicate that there are no"},{"pageContent":"Page 34significant continuities between the Amerindian groups of past and present butrather that such continuities are not always at the ethnic level, despitepersistence in cultural practices. As we have seen, the Arawak and Carib oftoday had their origins as much in the colonial struggles of the sixteenth andseventeenth centuries as they did in the fifteenth-century groups from whichthey arose, precisely as a result of the challenges posed to native autonomy byEuropean contacts.One important consequence of these considerations is that the Arawak and Caribof today, as well as the rest of the Amerindians, can be seen to be asSurinamese as any other of the European, African, or Asian ethnic groups thatmake up modern Surinam. They are all the product of a shared history andsymbiotic social processes. It is to be hoped that a better understanding ofthis joint legacy will allow the Amerindians to take their rightful place in thecontinuing story of Surinam, just as our knowledge of the nature of ethnogenesisand ethnocide allows us to understand the historical sources of specificAmerindian identities.Debate as to the meaning and origins of ethnic sentiment has tended to focus onthe contrasts between what have been termed the primordialist andinstrumentalist accounts (see Whitehead 1990a). But what is very evident fromour consideration of the emergence of successive Amerindian identities here isthat these analytical distinctions obscure the extent to which both kinds ofprocess are at play. Barth's (1969) classic account tends to underplay thesignificance of the cultural base in determining the way in which specificethnic identities are manufactured, while arguments for a strong continuitythrough the contact period are always in danger of a simplistic projection ofpresent ethnic categories onto the heterogeneous data from the past. Clearly acombination of these understandings, coupled with the appreciation that bothtypes of ethnic dynamic may coexist with a varying emphasis on one or anotherfactor over time, is required for the adequate analysis of the genesis andextinction of ethnic identity through time.It is for precisely these reasons that ethnogenesis and ethnocide have to beseen as complementary aspects of the same process of social and cultural change.Depending upon at which moment in time we choose to investigate this process, wewill come away from that examination with an impression as to the dominance ofone or another type of event. However, since we are really investigating thefate of forms of sociopolitical organization and their attendant culturalcategories in the guise of ethnic identities, the processes of ethnogenesis andethnocide are not necessarily indications of the demographic extinction orgenesis of groups of people, only their identities as those groups. For theserather obvious reasons the investigation of the cultural aspects of"},{"pageContent":"Page 35ethnicity will only tell half the historical story. Until we also know howcultural actors are enmeshed in specific social relations that are the cause andmotivation for cultural change (that is, until we also address the issue ofpower in conjunction with that of ethnicity), the historical process of identityformation will necessarily remain opaque."},{"pageContent":"Page 36Remnants, Renegades, and Runaways Seminole Ethnogenesis ReconsideredRichard A. SattlerWith the publication in 1971 of the seminal essay \"Creek into Seminole,\" WilliamSturtevant introduced the concept of ethnogenesis into American anthropologygenerally. It therefore seems appropriate to reconsider the Seminole case ageneration later in a volume dedicated to examining that process.Sturtevant's work remains an invaluable outline for the history of the Seminoleand their emergence as a distinct ethnic group. Advances in anthropologicaltheory and more recent research on the early historic period in the Southeastboth support a reexamination of the topic. Likewise, Sturtevant's primaryreliance on ethnographic models derived from the post-Removal Florida Seminole,rather than the majority Oklahoma Seminole, suggests the need for revision.Earlier anthropological models of chiefdoms largely reflected functionalist andadaptationalist theories. These models emphasized relatively benign, organicintegration and the role of chiefs as mediators in economic and politicalexchanges (Fried 1967; Service 1962; Steward 1955). More recent research onchiefdoms recognizes the inherent inequalities and conflicts within suchpolitical systems. These studies therefore examine elite strategies formaintaining power and emphasize the means by which elites finance thesepositions and recruit political support (Drennan and Uribe 1987; Earle 1991).The accepted view of the southeastern Indians during the early historic periodhas been that they were organized as tribal societies, confederacies, or simplechiefdoms (cf. Hudson 1976). An explosion of research on the late"},{"pageContent":"Page 37prehistoric and early historic period in this region during the last decade hasstrongly challenged this view (Barker and Pauketat 1992; DePratter 1991; Hann1988; Hudson 1990; Milanich and Hudson 1993; Smith 1987; Thomas 1990). As aresult, a new consensus has emerged which dramatically alters our perceptions ofthese peoples. 1These recent studies of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in this regionindicate that it was dominated by relatively large, complex chiefdoms, ratherthan tribal societies with largely autonomous villages (Hudson 1990; Barker andPauketat 1992; Thomas 1990). These studies also provide important information onnative sociopolitical concepts and models at the time of contact and suggest anew perspective from which to understand those of the late seventeenth andeighteenth centuries.In the past, most ethnographic and ethnohistorical research has focused on theFlorida Seminole. Their society underwent profound disruption and fragmentationduring and after the Second Seminole War (18351843). By 1842, 90 percent of theSeminole had been removed to Indian Territory (modern Oklahoma), includingalmost all the established leaders. Further, the remnant Seminole had beendriven south into the Big Cypress Swamp and the Everglades, where it wasimpossible to maintain traditional subsistence and settlement patterns. Refugeesin these areas lived in dispersed family or clan settlements united inrelatively loose coalitions under the leadership of the few remaining leaders.Given these circumstances, the post-Removal Florida Seminole provide aninappropriate model for understanding the earlier Seminole and proto-Seminole.Ethnographic and ethnohistorical research on the Oklahoma Seminole reveals thatthey retained a strongly corporate, essentially Creek sociopolitical structurethroughout the nineteenth century and into the present. Likewise, theirsociopolitical groups show marked continuity throughout their history (Sattler1987). There is also a marked similarity between modern Oklahoma Seminole andCreek sociopolitical concepts and those of the sixteenth century. Thus theyshould provide a better model for understanding Seminole ethnogenesis.Sturtevant's analysis clearly reflects the earlier understandings of thesoutheastern Indians and chiefly sociopolitical organization. He views Creek andSeminole towns as generally autonomous and possessed of a natural tendencytoward fission as population increased or as local resources became strained.When this is combined with an organic view of chiefly organization, theestablishment of the Seminole settlements in Florida requires no moreexplanation than the opportunities offered by vacant lands and the pressures ofEuropean colonial expansion. His reliance on ethnographic models based on theFlorida Seminole is also reflected in his analysis. While recognizing that theyretained"},{"pageContent":"Page 38many Creek features, he views proto-Seminole settlements as random aggregationsof individuals and families with less corporate forms of community andgovernment.Other analyses generally have shared these inadequacies (Swanton 1922; Craig andPeebles 1974; Fairbanks 1974, 1978; Wright 1986). Most have seen the process ofproto-Seminole settlement as essentially random movements of individuals andfamilies into Florida, requiring the creation of new and novel forms ofcommunity and government. The new forms generally are seen as more flexible andless corporate than their predecessors. These studies also give primacy to vagueand generally exogenous forces in driving this movement.The following essay attempts to refine the existing view of Seminoleethnogenesis. It draws on more recent historical and anthropological researchand the perspective provided by ethnographic and ethnohistoric research on theOklahoma Seminole. As such it is informed by improved knowledge of nativesociopolitical models and a closer examination of political processes.Eastern Muskogean Sociopolitical OrganizationBases of Elite Power in the Sixteenth Century. In order to understand Seminoleethnogenesis, it is first necessary to describe the nature of eastern Muskogeansociopolitical organization prior to the eighteenth century. The Seminole didnot emerge in a vacuum, and their actions were shaped by existing patterns ofbehavior and thought which provided the basis for meaningful action.At the time of European contact in the early sixteenth century, most easternMuskogean peoples were organized into a number of competing hierarchicalpolities. These polities varied in size, complexity, and integration, rangingfrom simple chiefdoms along the northern Gulf Coast and the confederatedchiefdoms on the Atlantic Coast to the complex paramount chiefdoms of theinterior Southeast (Milanich 1990; Hudson 1990: 5558). The larger, more complexpolities possessed a three- or four-level political hierarchy with villageheadmen, provincial chiefs, and paramount chiefs. These polities incorporatedmultiple simple chiefdoms, using both peaceful incorporation and militaryconquest (Dye 1990: 213214; Milanich 1990).Organizationally, all of the sixteenth-century eastern Muskogean chiefdomsresembled what Southall (1988) has termed \"segmentary states,\" though perhaps ona lesser scale. Rulers in these societies relied primarily on ritual hegemony tomaintain political integration. As such, the paramount ruler's authority largelyderived from sacred power and knowledge, often accompanied by claims of divinedescent. The central ruler exercised little direct control over the outlyingdistricts, which local rulers administered. The paramounts required onlyacknowledgments of suzerainty and the payment of"},{"pageContent":"Page 39tribute. Such polities are inherently unstable and given to rebellion andsecession (Anderson 1990: 190192; Hudson 1990: 5758; Southall 1991; Trouwborst1991).The districts or simple chiefdoms, italwas in Muskogee and ''towns\" in English,2 were apparently the most stable units and internally self-governing. Each hada hereditary civil chief (mikko), a council of hereditary and appointiveofficials, and a body of military leaders. Each italwa contained a number ofranked matrilineal descent groups whose senior men served as heads (achulakis)and sat on the italwa council (Hawkins 1848: 6772; Nairne 1988: 3236; Hudson1990; Sattler 1987: 3559; Swanton 1928a: 242259).3The sixteenth-century chiefs drew on various bases of power. Socially, they werethe most senior men in their italwa (Sattler 1988: 1415). Economically, thechiefs drew on both staple and wealth finance. They collected taxes andcompelled corvée labor within the italwa, as well as tribute from subordinatepolities (Brose 1989: 29; DePratter 1991: 132133).4 They also exercised at leastpartial control of foreign exchange, especially valuables (DePratter 1991: 155).Control over the distribution of these resources created important support. Thewar chiefs (tastanaki) provided an internal police force and specializedmilitary force under the direct control of the chiefs. Paramount chiefs alsoemployed military force to subdue rebellions (DePratter 1991: 4852; Dye 1990:213215).The most important source of elite power, however, was control over intangibleassets. The hereditary chiefs (mikkos) and other officials were believed topossess inherent sacred power (hiliswa) similar to Polynesian mana. This powerpassed by matrilineal inheritance and, at least for the mikkos, extended outwardthrough their descent group in diminishing degrees. During the sixteenthcentury, mikkos often based this sacred power on descent from the sun, apowerful deity. This power was combined with specialized sacred knowledge thatenabled the mikkos and other officials to perform group rituals necessary to theprosperity and well-being of the italwa. These rituals centered on the sacredfire, which was the tutelary deity of the group and with which the mikkos had aspecial relationship (DePratter 1991: 5772, 113; Hudson 1990: 50; Sattler 1987:5255).Change and Continuity in the Colonial Period. Events during the sixteenth andseventeenth centuries profoundly affected these Muskogean chiefdoms. Somecomplex chiefdoms were already declining, owing in part to an unstable anddeteriorating climate and to regional conflicts (Brose 1984: 167). Europeancontact exacerbated this process through military action and the introduction ofalien pathogens (Smith 1987: 54112, 1989: 2134). Some groups, such as the Gualeand Apalachi, also came directly under Spanish domination and were subject tomissionization."},{"pageContent":"Page 40By 1716, major changes had occurred. European diseases had produced massivedepopulation in some areas. Older paramount chiefdoms, such as Kusa andTascalusa, had collapsed and fragmented, and new alignments had emerged. Oncepopulous districts were reduced to single settlements, and others hadeffectively disappeared. Significant dislocation accompanied this depopulation(Smith 1989).The paramount chiefs relied heavily on sacred power to maintain their authority.This power was supposed to bring health and prosperity to their subjects.Epidemics and military defeats, therefore, called this power into question. Itis significant that the chiefs apparently did not claim descent from the sunduring the eighteenth century but still maintained a special relationship withthe sacred fire, the sun's earthly representative (Anderson 1990:192199; Bartram1927: 388389; Hawkins 1848: 6872; Hudson 1990: 5558; Sattler 1987: 5255).The increasingly important deerskin trade also undermined the economic basis ofchiefly power. The traders resided in the towns and dealt with individualhunters, rather than through the chiefs. The large number of these traders andthe willingness of colonial governments to intervene on their behalf made itimpossible for the chiefs to control them or the trade effectively. Thissituation largely undermined chiefly control over foreign trade, though thechiefs compensated by demanding large gifts from the traders residing in theirjurisdictions and through coercing diplomatic gifts from the colonialgovernments (Sattler 1989).International rivalries among the European powers also presented problems. Whilethese rivalries offered major opportunities to skilled statesmen like Brim ofKawita, they seriously threatened less able leaders. 5 Representatives ofEuropean governments constantly intervened in the internal politics of thechiefdoms as they attempted to bolster their allies and undermine opponents. Inthe case of the British, the governments of different colonies competed againsteach other at times. Even private citizens intervened to further either nationalor private interests (Crane 1928).Most researchers maintain that the older chiefdoms were replaced by simplertribal societies during this period (DePratter 1991; Hudson 1990; Smith 1987).In contrast, I would argue that paramount chiefdoms continued to dominate thenative political landscape through most or all of the eighteenth century, thoughin much weakened form.Throughout the eighteenth century, the eastern Muskogean peoples were organizedinto named divisions, most importantly, the Talapusa, Apihka (also called theKusa), Alabama, and Kawita (also called Apalachicola or Lower Creek). Membershipin each division remained relatively stable throughout the century. The Apihkabuilt towns on both the Coosa and upper Tallapoosa"},{"pageContent":"Page 410041-01.GIF [bceab96110b110915d8b3197a5ce47fa.gif]Figure 1.Eastern Muskogean chiefdoms, late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.Rivers, and the Alabama settled on the lower Coosa and Tallapoosa as well as theAlabama River, indicating that these were not merely geographical divisions (seefigure 1). Likewise, each division maintained a separate council with arecognized capital and exhibited general internal coherence of action and adegree of independence from each other (Farmar 1764; Fitch 1916; Glover 1725;Grant 1980: 1517; Rivers 1874: 94; Swanton 1928a: 306310; Taitt 1916). 6These divisions are best understood as successor chiefdoms. They lacked thepower, wealth, and size of their predecessors but retained similar organi-"},{"pageContent":"Page 42zational principles and concepts of political legitimacy. Some of thesechiefdoms, at particular periods, may not have been much more centralized orpowerful than confederacies. Such fluctuations reflect the normal competitionfor power between central paramounts and district chiefs during periods ofinstability.Within this context, paramounts, subchiefs, and others contended with each otherand with the Europeans for power and prestige during the eighteenth century. Thepower of all chiefs had declined significantly after European colonization.Multilateral conflicts involving European powers and native polities, diseaseand depopulation, and repeated relocation of populations all contributed to thedecline in chiefly power and increased political instability, as did therelative recentness of the new chiefdoms. Conversely, the manifest advantages ofaffiliation with larger and more powerful groups and with successful leaderspromoted a degree of unity.Seminole Ethnogenesis. The Lower Creek Kawita chiefdom provided the primaryimpetus for the formation of the Seminole, and the early settlers derivedprimarily from this chiefdom. Its complex history and heterogeneous compositionpromoted both instability and secession.The available evidence indicates that this chiefdom was established in the earlyseventeenth century by towns from the former Kusa chiefdom who conquered anexisting Apalachicola chiefdom on the Chattahoochee River. 7 The migrationlegend related by the Kawita chief, Chikilli, in 1735 describes this conquest bythe Kawita, Kasihta, and Chickasaw (Gatschet 1969). The latter probablyrepresent the Taskigi.8 Archaeology and linguistics support this scenario, as dosixteenth-century documentary sources.9After 1715, the Lower Creek also incorporated the Yuchi and Yamasi and conqueredthe Apalachi (see figure 2).10 They thus constituted a multiethnic polity underthe suzerainty of Kawita, which contained Muskogee, Apalachicola, Apalachi,Yamasi, and Yuchi elements (see figure 3). In part these groups formed separateitalwas, but Apalachi and Yamasi were also present in other towns (Boyd 1949,1952; Fitch 1916: 182; Sattler 1992; Swanton 1922: 124, 141143, 165184, 216230).The Kawita apparently imposed religious and linguistic hegemony, as well aspolitical control. Ritual practices and beliefs in all of the Lower Creekitalwas generally converged during the eighteenth century despite indications ofearlier differences (Hann 1988: 7095; Swanton 1928b).11 Likewise, the Muskogeelanguage dominated in relations between towns, and Hichiti emerged as the commonlanguage of the Apalachicola, Yamasi, and Apalachi towns (Swanton 1928a:248249).Diego Peña and Tobias Fitch described intense political rivalries within theLower Creek chiefdom between 1716 and 1725. During this period, the para-"},{"pageContent":"Page 430043-01.GIF [718cfa48cca8764459c35cb47758ce63.gif]Figure 2.Ethnic mergers, 16801700.0043-02.GIF [1dcda2415ec8daf64d88347b2c8ca05a.gif]Figure 3.Ethnic mergers, 17001715.mount chief, Brim of Kawita, actively pursued a policy of balanced neutralityand détente in regard to the British, Spanish, and French. A dissident factionled by his son, Simpukasi (Seepeycoffee), and his brother, Chilokilichi(Cherokeelechee), favored a stronger pro-Spanish alliance. This disagreementnearly produced armed conflicts on several occasions and resulted in threats ofsecession by dissident leaders (Barcía Carballido y Zuñiga 1951: 358; Boyd 1949,1952; Fitch 1916). During the 1720s, the chiefs of Yufala Hopoya and Tamali alsopursued generally independent courses and frequently defied the authority ofBrim, without making a complete break (Fitch 1916).Most of the leaders and towns identified with these dissident movements weresubordinate ethnic groups. Simpukasi was an Apalachi through his mother and wasalso married to an Apalachi woman (Barcía Carballido y Zuñiga 1951: 362).Likewise, the chief of the Apalachi Wakoka (Bacuqua),"},{"pageContent":"Page 44Adrian, was another dissident leader (Boyd 1952). Chilokilichi and his town mayalso have had Apalachi or Yamasi connections (Barcía Carballido y Zuñiga 1951:366). Two of the villages, Hichiti and Okoni, which intended to relocate toApalachi have been identified by Swanton as Yamasi. Two more, Apalachikola andSawokli, he identifies with the earlier Apalachicola chiefdom (Swanton 1922:129134, 141143, 172181). Likewise, both of these towns had strong associationswith the Apalachi (Boyd 1949, 1952: 119). Tamali and Yufala Hopoya also largelyderived from the Apalachi and Yamasi.These internal divisions and rivalries, both ethnic and personal, played a majorrole in Seminole ethnogenesis. Likewise, the larger geopolitical and economicconditions in the Southeast contributed to this process.Proto-Seminole settlements initially appeared in three separate areas. Thesewere the old Apalachee territory around Tallahassee, the Alachua region aroundmodern Gainesville, and the forks of the Apalachicola River, where modernGeorgia, Alabama, and Florida meet (see figure 4). Each area has a somewhatdifferent history, though all areas share common elements. Their history canconveniently be divided into three periods: Colonization, 1720 to 1780;Separation, 1780 to 1822; Consolidation, 1822 to 1835.Colonization, 1720 to 1780The Colonization period extended from about 1720 until the end of the AmericanRevolution. This period saw the colonization of northern Florida by people fromthe Lower Creek towns and the establishment of new chiefdoms there. Thesechiefdoms closely followed the older Muskogee patterns, though settlements mayhave been somewhat more dispersed. 12 While they established separate chiefdomsin Florida at this time, the proto-Seminole settlements still acknowledgedKawita's suzerainty, if somewhat distantly (Sturtevant 1971; Fairbanks 1978).Apalachi Old Fields. The process by which the proto-Seminole settled theApalachee Old Fields remains somewhat obscure. Several lines of evidence,however, indicate that this process began in the 1720s and that the Apalachi andthe Yamasi played a central role.Spanish authorities repeatedly reported new Apalachi and Yamasi settlements inthis region between 1718 and 1738, though the number remains unclear, includingone established by Apalachi refugees from Pensacola (see figure 5). The Apalachiand Yamasi villages named in Spanish sources included Amapexas, Hamasti, Tamali,San Juan de Wakulla, and San Antonio (Barcía Carballido y Zuñiga 1951: 347348;Benavides 1726; Bishop of Cuba 1728; Hann 1988: 291294; Montiano 1738, 1747;Swanton 1922: 126127). Some of these are probably different names for the samevillages. In addition, the Spanish reported two settlements of Tocabaga on theAucilla and Wacissa"},{"pageContent":"Page 450045-01.GIF [671897ef9b98cdacdd6bd3dfe7be7789.gif]Figure 4.Lower Creek and Seminole, ca. 1800.Rivers in 1718 (Primo de Rivera 1718). TePaske (1964: 206) has suggested thatthere were as many as six villages in the area in 1725, but the Spanish sourcesindicate no more than four and generally twoone Apalachi and one Yamasi (Hann1988: 291294). By 1739, only one village of Yamasi, Tamali, was listed in theregion (Montiano 1738).The Spanish invited the Lower Creek and the Apalachi among them to settleApalachee several times after 1716. While several towns said they would move,there is little evidence that they did so before 1720 (Ayala y Escobar 1718;Barcía Carballido y Zuñiga 1951: 378; Boyd 1952: 199; Hann 1988: 291294; Primode Rivera 1718). There are indications, however, that some people from the LowerCreek moved into the area during the 1720s.Simpukasi, one of those who earlier promised to move, disappears from thehistorical record after 1726 (Porter 1948: 371). 13 For such a prominent and"},{"pageContent":"Page 460046-01.GIF [887e6fca07097620c629f1a9ff107cb6.gif]Figure 5.Ethnic movements, 17151720.controversial leader to disappear without comment seems unusual. Importantly,Simpukasi is named as the founder of the Seminole in a tradition recorded in themid-nineteenth century (Sprague 1847: 1819). 14 Likewise, the Talahassi mikko,Tonapi, stated in 1777 that he was from Kawita, as was Simpukasi, and was taughtto \"love the Spanish\" from infancy by his father. He further stated that hesettled in the Apalachee region sometime between 1724 and 1740 (Boyd and Latorre1953:110111).15 The correspondence in town of origin and affinity toward theSpanish suggests a connection between Simpukasi and Tonapi. Interestingly,Tonapi also reports, in the same statement, that many of his people wereChristians. The Apalachi and a few of the Yamasi constituted the onlysignificant Christian element among the Lower Creek towns.Additionally, a modern Oklahoma Seminole tradition names Talahassi, originallylocated in the Apalachee region, as the oldest of the Seminole towns.16 Thistradition must be viewed with some caution given the rhetorical use of \"eldest\"to indicate structural seniority and high prestige among the Seminole and Creek.If it accurately reflects Seminole settlement history, then Talahassi and theApalachee region must have been settled prior to the mid1740s, when the Alachuaregion was settled (see below).Most or all of the Seminole settlements also apparently spoke Hichiti, ratherthan Muskogee (Sturtevant 1971: 103). Their language, however, is oftendescribed as corrupted and unintelligible to the Creek or as a mixture ofMuskogee and Yamasi (Swan 1791: 200; Boyd 1958: 83). This is what would beexpected if the Seminole primarily derived from conquered or otherwise"},{"pageContent":"Page 47incorporated Apalachi and Yamasi, rather than from the dominant Muskogee Kawitaand Kasihta.There is an apparent discrepancy between Spanish statements of the number oftowns present and the evidence for additional Lower Creek settlements in theregion. An examination of the nature of the Spanish statements partiallyresolves the problem. The Spanish authorities only list mission sites and townsloyal to the Spanish. There is reason to believe that there were alsonon-Christian Indians and Indians not firmly tied to the Spanish living in thearea. 17 Likewise, Isidoro de León, commander of the Spanish fort at San Marcos,indicates a relatively large population in the region in the mid-1740s (Wenholdand Manucy 1957). The marked correspondence in these accounts suggests that theApalachi and Yamasi first settled the Apalachi region beginning in 1718. Themain emigration, however, apparently occurred in the 1720s and 1730s, involvingSimpukasi and his followers (see Figure 6).Maps from the 1740s through the 1760s indicate several settlements in the area,though some of these probably represent duplications under differing names,since the cartographers had no direct experience of the area (Delahaye 1740;Mitchell 1755; Jefferys 1761). More reliable sources from the 1760s and 1770s,after title to Florida passed from the Spanish to the British, indicate at leastfour towns: Talahassi near the modern city of that name, Mikasuki on thesouthwest shore of Lake Miccosukee, Okilakni (Ochlockonee) on the OchlockoneeRiver near the junction of the Little River, and Wasissa (Wacissa) on the upperWacissa River. None of the sources listed all these towns, but each is welldocumented (Bartram 1927; Boyd 1934: 117118; Boyd and Latorre 1953; Romans 1775;Stuart and Purcell 1778). In addition, other sources indicate more towns (Boyd1941b: 204; Farmar 1764).The exact relationship among these towns during this period remains ob-0047-01.GIF [27326305bc79c719e7a9e5bb0b235893.gif]Figure 6.Ethnic movements, 17201780."},{"pageContent":"Page 48scure. They generally acted in concert, however, under the leadership ofTalahassi. The Talahassi chief, Tonapi, consistently represented all of them attalks with the British and the Spanish (Boyd and Latorre 1953; Covington 1961;Sattler 1987: 6364). Despite a degree of independence, the Indians in thisregion remained under the control of Kawita prior to 1780 (Boyd and Latorre1953: 113; Searcy 1985: 57).Alachua. During the late 1740s or early 1750s, a group of Okoni under theWakapuchasi (Cowkeeper) settled in the Alachua region around modern Gainesville,where they established several towns. They were joined over the next twentyyears by other settlers from the Lower Creek (see figure 6). This group was thefirst designated as Seminole, also known as Alachua, and is the best documentedof the Florida chiefdoms (Fairbanks 1978; Sturtevant 1971).By the 1770s, this group comprised at least five towns: Kuskowilla (Cuscawilla)near modern Micanopy, Suwani Talahassochi on the Suwannee River, 18 Wichatuknion the lower Santa Fe River, Santafi Talofa (Santa Fe Talofa) on upper Santa Fe,and Itani at the head of Black Creek (see figures 4 and 5).19 The Okoni also hadincorporated, peacefully or by conquest, at least five other groups with anunknown number of villages: Talakchapko on the head of Pease River, Okliwaha atthe bend of the Oklawaha River, Talofa Okhassi on Lake Apopka at the head ofthat river, and Chukochati at the south end of Annutiliga, or Big Hammock(Bartram 1927; Boyd 1934: 120; Romans 1775; Stuart and Purcell 1778).The origins of the Talakchapko settlements are unclear, though they were laterunder the control of the Okmalki Chiaha and may have been from this town (Boyd1958: 9092). The Oklawaha and probably the Talofa Okhassi settlements areclearly Yamasi (Anonymous 1763; Bartram 1927: 164; Cohen 1836: 33; Jefferys1761). The original Talakchapko settlements may also have been Yamasi, asstatements by Okoni chiefs indicate that all of the settlements to the southwere Yamasi (Candler 1910: 628; Bartram 1927: 164). The Chukochati settlers camefrom Yufala Hopoya on the Chattahoochee in 1767 (Romans 1775: 280281).20Various contemporary documents clearly state that the Okoni incorporated theYamasi through conquest (Anonymous 1763; Bartram 1927: 117123; Sattler 1987:1920). There is a reasonable probability that Wakapuchasi's Okoni were identicalwith the Ocute of the early Spanish accounts. They certainly occupied the samearea during the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, and the similarityof the names is significant.21 If this is the case, then their movement intoFlorida represents an attempt to reestablish the independent Okoni chiefdom.Their constant warfare with and conquest of the Yamasi in Florida may thenreflect an attempt to reassert earlier hegemony over the latter."},{"pageContent":"Page 49By 1780, Wakapuchasi apparently exercised suzerainty over much of northcentralFlorida south of the Santa Fe River between the Suwannee and St. Johns Rivers.His successors maintained control through the nineteenth century (Bartram 1927:117124; Fairbanks 1974: 127136; Sturtevant 1971: 104105).All the Alachua paramount chiefs succeeded to office through matrilinealinheritance and evidently primogeniture (Porter 1952). 22 They also employedstrategic marriage alliances with subordinate chiefs to maintain their power(Sattler 1989).The Forks. Throughout the eighteenth century, the people of the towns that hadbeen settled well south of the other Lower Creek on the Chattahoochee (seefigure 4) often pursued an independent course and defied the authority of theKawita chiefs, but they did not make a complete break before 1780.Chilokilichi, the previously mentioned brother of Brim, established a town atthe forks on the lower Chattahoochee in 1715. This town was located on the siteof the older Sawokli mission nearly 100 miles below the other Lower Creek towns.Chilokilichi's town was also known by the Spanish as Uchise and probably gaverise to the later town of Ochisi, which was originally located in the same area.In 1716 Diego Peña also reported another settlement, under Paypa Mikko, on theFlint River, one and a half miles from the forks. This is undoubtedly the Yamasitown in the same area referred to by other Spanish authorities (BarcíaCarballido y Zuñiga 1951: 378; Boyd 1949, 1952; Wenhold and Manucy 1957).In the late 1710s, Peña also described several Apalachi settlements on theChattahoochee below the other Lower Creek towns (Boyd 1949, 1952). In the 1720s,Tobias Fitch places the Yufala Hopoya and Tamali in this area (Fitch 1916). Thesimilarity of the names of these towns and those of the Apalachi towns of Tamaand Ayuwali (Ayuvale, Ayuville) is significant. Peña specifically names theApalachi Tama (Boyd 1952: 116), and Ayuwali was among those settled on theSavannah River prior to 1715 (Salley 1926: 313, 1939: 1316). Similarly, YufalaHopoya and the Seminole towns derived from Tamali contain several small clans,which are rare or absent among other Creek towns. Some of these clans can bedirectly linked to the Apalachi, while others may be indirectly linked.23 Onbalance, both Yufala Hopoya and Tamali were probably of Apalachi origin, thoughthey may also have contained some Yamasi (Fitch 1916).By the 1730s, these towns were located fifteen to twenty-five miles south of theothers, which were generally separated by no more than two to five miles. Tamalihad moved into the forks of the Apalachicola by 1772. Both Yufala Hopoya andTamali also had established a number of outsettlements by that"},{"pageContent":"Page 50time, including Chowala, Ikanchati, and Ichiskatalofa (Farmar 1764; Covington1961: 47; Stuart and Purcell 1778; Bonar 1757; Taitt 1916).The relationship among the various towns on the lower Chattahoochee at this timeremains unclear. None of the evidence suggests unified leadership, but theytended to act cooperatively. All remained under the authority of Kawita butconsistently defied that authority (Fitch 1916; McDowell 1958: 320; Taitt 1916:546547, 551554).Several factors contributed to the initial movement of people from the LowerCreek territory into Florida. Lower Creek and Yamasi raids on the Spanishmissions had effectively depopulated northern Florida by 1710 (Nairne 1708:196197). The abundant and fertile vacant lands there offered an attractiveeconomic resource for both chiefs and commoners, as did the large herds of feralcattle and horses and the extensive hunting territories. Eighteenth-centuryobservers later described extensive fields and large herds among the Seminolewhich provided both subsistence and trade commodities (Blyth 1916; Bartram 1927:115132).The Spanish presence was far smaller than that of the British, and theyexercised less control over their territorial claims. The Florida chiefs,therefore, suffered less from foreign intervention in internal politicalaffairs. They also succeeded in restricting or eliminating the presence oftraders in their towns, thus reestablishing a greater degree of control overforeign trade and reducing foreign interference in internal affairs. The Indiantrade was of less importance to the Spanish than to the British and wasprimarily organized as an adjunct to diplomacy, rather than as a privatecommercial enterprise. 24 The dependency of the Spanish on Indian allies tomaintain their frontiers with the British also made them particularlysusceptible to demands for diplomatic gifts (TePaske 1964; Murdoch 1957).By the time title to Florida passed to Britain in 1763, the Indians were wellestablished. The British largely maintained existing arrangements, includinglimiting European presence in the Seminole towns, as they did not want anothercostly Indian war. The transfer, therefore, had little negative impact on theFlorida chiefdoms (Gold 1969; Mowat 1943).The greater abundance and lower cost of English trade goods provided newopportunities for expanded trade. Following the Spanish practice, the Britishtraders maintained stores at prescribed locations outside of the Seminolesettlements and only occasionally visited there. Thus the foreign presence inthe Seminole towns was minimized. Under these conditions, the Alachua became themajor suppliers of beef and horses to St. Augustine under the British (Parkern.d.: 79)."},{"pageContent":"Page 51Separation, 1780 to 1822The 1780s, ushered in by an unprecedented series of disruptive events, led toincreasing separation and ultimately to full autonomy for the Seminolechiefdoms. The rising power and importance of the Creek Confederacy, theAmerican Revolution, the usurpation of power within the confederacy by AlexanderMcGillivray, and the activities of the British adventurer William AugustusBowles all contributed to this movement.These events diminished the power of the mikkos and particularly of theparamount chiefs as the external demand and internal need for unified action byall eastern Muskogean groups shifted power away from the chiefdoms to theconfederacy. Simultaneously, these conditions promoted dissent and factionaldisputes within the Muskogee. Withdrawal and independence provided a reasonablealternative for the geographically separated Seminole chiefdoms.Specific conflicts of interest between the Florida chiefdoms and their northernrelatives furthered the separatist trend. The Creek faced increasing pressuresfor land and other concessions after the American Revolution, primarily by theAmericans. While the majority of the confederacy lay within the territorialclaims of the new United States, the Seminole chiefdoms resided in territoryclaimed by Spain, which made fewer demands on the Indians. The focus of concernfor the confederacy, therefore, diverged from that of the Seminole. The apparentwillingness of the confederacy to sacrifice the property and prerogatives ofmore marginal groups, like those in Florida, to satisfy claims against theconfederacy as a whole or to preserve the interests of the core groups increasedthis rift (Fairbanks 1974: 205210; Sattler 1987).The Alachua Seminole were the first to sever ties. Because they were distantfrom the centers of Creek power, Kawita's suzerainty had always been nominalthere. During the American Revolution this group actively participated with theBritish in attacks against the Americans, in violation of official Creekneutrality (Boyd and Latorre 1953: 113; Searcy 1985: 20, 72, 108, 154). By the1790s, the Alachua actively pursued an independent course, mostly by withdrawingfrom participation in Lower Creek and confederacy affairs. The succession ofPayne as paramount chief following his uncle's death shortly prior to 1790undoubtedly led to this policy shift (Caughey 1938: 124125; Hawkins 1916: 317).The abortive American invasion of East Florida in 1812 further contributed tothe separation of the Alachua Seminole. While initially neutral in thisconflict, the Alachua soon began attacking the American settlers and troops innortheastern Florida. The American response resulted in the destruction of threeAlachua towns and severe injuries to Payne. Payne died of his wounds some timelater and was succeeded by his brother Bowlegs. At this time, most"},{"pageContent":"Page 52of the Alachua withdrew farther south toward Tampa Bay. Bowlegs, along withabout 500 of his people, moved to the site of Suwani Talahassochi (Davis 1930;Fairbanks 1978: 212216; Sattler 1987: 73; Young 1934: 88).The Mikasuki and Talahassi in Apalachee also began resisting Creek suzeraintyafter 1780. While this group generally followed the decisions of the confederacyat this time, they actively resisted the power of Alexander McGillivray, 25instead early and actively supporting William Augustus Bowles, an Englishadventurer and opponent of McGillivray (Kinnaird 1931a, 1931b; Kinnaird andKinnaird 1983; Wright 1986). Differences with the Creek increased to the pointwhere these groups assumed full independence by 1804. Prior to this, theApalachee Seminole had considered themselves bound by treaties and agreementsmade by the Lower Creek, sometimes without direct representation in thenegotiations. During the 1790s, they more aggressively demanded directrepresentation in negotiations, and even the Lower Creek acknowledged Seminoleautonomy by 1802 (U.S. Congress 18321861, Indian Affairs 1: 670, 673, 676;Sattler 1987: 71).This increasing independence probably reflected another important change amongthe Seminole of this region. Tonapi of Talahassi apparently died shortly after1777. He was succeeded as spokesman and leader by Kapicha Mikko (more commonlyknown as Kinhachi) of Mikasuki. Not only had a new leader emerged, butpreeminence had shifted from Talahassi to Mikasuki. The nature and causes ofthis shift are unknown, but the effects were significant.26 Regardless of thenature of the transition, the Mikasuki would remain dominant until the SecondSeminole War, and the Apalachee settlements as a whole came to be known by theirname (U.S. Congress 18321861, Indian Affairs 1: 127; Fairbanks 1974: 184).Kapicha Mikko, in contrast to his predecessor, pursued a much more aggressiveand independent foreign policy. Not only did he actively assert his autonomyfrom the Creek, but he also adopted an aggressive anti-American policy. Underhis rule, the Apalachee Seminole opposed the United States on numerous occasionsand engaged in a prolonged border feud with American settlements in Georgiabetween 1790 and 1818 (Fairbanks 1974: 194228; Grant 1980: 453456; Innerarity1931: 105; Lockey 1949: 109111; Sattler 1987: 83, 100104).The American Revolution also introduced a new component in the makeup of theSeminole chiefdoms. During the war, British authorities in Florida encouragedslaves from the rebellious colonies to escape by promising them freedom inFlorida. At least some of these escaped slaves formed Maroon communities in theinterior of Florida.27 These communities forged alliances with the Seminolechiefdoms already there, paying an annual tribute to the chiefs. Most of theMaroons settled in the Alachua territory prior to"},{"pageContent":"Page 530053-01.GIF [cd720d7ce016450211d72660fd7e1bff.gif]Figure 7.Ethnic movements, 17801822.1814, where they formed at least two towns, allied with Payne and his subchiefImala, or Philip. Other blacks also lived in the Seminole towns either as slavesor as free men. Like the Maroons, most of them had come in during the AmericanRevolution (Giddings 1858; Porter 1945, 1946a, 1946b, 1948, 1951a).The Yufala and Tamali continued their southward expansion after the AmericanRevolution, though they retained a loose association with the Lower Creek. Whilethe Yufala Hopoya remained in the same location on the Chattahoochee they hadoccupied in the 1760s, their outsettlements extended southward. The Tamalimigrated below the forks to the Apalachicola River, as did the Ochisi. TheYamasi also established settlements on the lower Chattahoochee, the upperApalachicola, and the branches of the Ochlockonee River (see figure 7). Between1780 and 1820, the Indians established at least twelve towns on theChattahoochee and Apalachicola Rivers below Yufala (Olivier 1793; Westcott1833a; Young 1934: 8588).By the 1810s, several of these towns had united under a single chief and assumeda common identity. At that time they comprised at least six towns: Ikanchati(Tohtohuili[Tohtohuili), Yamasi, Tamali (Chukonikla[Chukonikla), Ochisi(Ispaniwakki), and Yawohli (Iola), each of which maintained its own chief andsquare ground. The whole body was called Yamasi in 1818 and later referred to asthe Apalachicola (Westcott 1833b; Young 1934: 8588).The Chiaha, Yuchi, and Hichiti also established several settlements on the lowerFlint River beginning in the 1770s. By 1800, these numbered at least"},{"pageContent":"Page 54ten towns: the Yuchi towns of Pachilika, Intachkalka, and Topanalka; the Chiahatowns of Itopanalka, Amakali, Hotalihuyana, and Okmalki; and the Hichiti townsof Hichitochi, Chikasahachi, and Tottolosi Talofa (see figure 7). All thesetowns had their own chiefs and square grounds (Hawkins 1848: 6166, 1916: 171172;Young 1934: 8588).In the 1790s the towns on the Flint, Apalachicola, and lower ChattahoocheeRivers constituted at least four semiautonomous chiefdoms, each with severalsettlements. These included the Yamasi (Ochisi and Tamali), the Yuchi, theHichiti, and the Chiaha. While they remained part of the Lower Creek, all beganacting more independently and often in opposition to Kawita and the CreekConfederacy after 1790 (U.S. Congress 18321861, Indian Affairs 1: 309310,313316, 373374, 383, 669670; Grant 1980: 427, 678679; Westcott 1833b; Young1934: 8588). Clearly, the declining power and authority of the paramount chiefs,as well as conflicts of interest within the confederacy, encouraged minoritygroups within the Creek to assert greater independence. At this time theAmericans and Spanish often referred to all of the Flint River and forks groupsas Seminole (Green 1982: 3538; Caughey 1938: 3536, 286287).The aftermath of the War of 1812 and the Creek War of 1814 introducedsignificant changes among the Seminole. Most significant were a massivepopulation increase and a change in the tribe's makeup from the inclusion of twonew groups.The defeat of the dissident Redstick Creek by the Americans and their LowerCreek allies produced a massive influx of refugees into Florida, mostly UpperCreek Talapusa (see figure 7). 28 While the earlier Seminole derived from LowerCreek towns and predominantly spoke Hichiti, the new immigrants mostly spokeMuskogee and outnumbered the older Seminole by perhaps two to one (Fairbanks1974: 209211).Initially, most of the Upper Creek Redstick refugees settled in West Florida onthe Escambia, Conecuh, and Choctawhatchee Rivers. In 1815, the Mikasuki, who hadalso joined the Redstick Movement, invited the refugees to join them, and manydid so. These Redsticks established towns among the Mikasuki and Talahassi orsettled in the area just to the east between the Aucilla and Suwannee Rivers.Other Redsticks settled at the abandoned Alachua territory, and some fledfarther south to the Tampa Bay region (U.S. Congress 18321861, Indian Affairs 1:838, 860; Boyd 1937: 260, 1958: 88, 93, 182; Carter 1956: 968971; Fairbanks1974: 210211; Sattler 1987: 7374).Some of these Redstick towns were incorporated into the existing Mikasuki andAlachua Seminole polities. The alliance between the Mikasuki and the TalsiRedsticks was particularly strong and continued through the Second Seminole War.Other Redstick towns apparently remained independent or"},{"pageContent":"Page 55formed a separate chiefdom or confederacy in Florida. Unsettled conditions and alack of records leave their situation unclear (U.S. Congress 18321861, MilitaryAffairs 1: 681701; Fairbanks 1974: 229, 231, 238239, 249250; Williams 1837: 214,274; Young 1934: 8384, 88).The War of 1812 also brought a major new influx of blacks. During the war, theBritish established a fort at Prospect Bluff on the Apalachicola River, wherethey armed and trained escaped slaves and Maroons to fight the Americans. Inresponse, blacks flocked to the area and established populous communities alongthe lower Apalachicola River. The fort was destroyed by American soldiers in1816 as a result of continuing border conflicts and escaping slaves. Thesurviving blacks joined the Seminole and established communities among theMikasuki and Alachua (Porter 1951a; Fairbanks 1978: 177187; Sattler 1987: 8182).Events overtook the Seminole before the newcomers could be fully incorporated.The Mikasuki, Redsticks, and Alachua on the Suwanee River continued to followthe Redstick cult, producing much anxiety among the Americans. Likewise,hostilities between Florida Indians and Maroons and the Georgia settlerscontinued unabated. These hostilities involved elements of all three Seminolegroups (Grant 1980: 698699, 713714, 717718, 724727, 763764, 771, 773774, 786787;McReynolds 1957: 6387; Young 1934).These conditions provided Andrew Jackson with an excuse to invade Florida.During the invasion, Jackson's troops burned seven Seminole settlements:Tottolosi, Ikanchati, Attapalka, Talahassi, Mikasuki, and the two Maroon andIndian settlements on the Suwannee River. More important, both Kapicha Mikko ofthe Mikasuki and Bowlegs of the Alachua were killed in these engagements. Theywere succeeded by Takosa Imala and Mikkonapa, respectively (U.S. Congress18321861, Indian Affairs 2: 409, 432; U.S. Congress 18321861, Military Affairs1: 681778; Young 1934).Jackson's main purpose, however, was the conquest of Florida. After destroyingthe Mikasuki villages, he seized the Spanish fort at St. Marks on a pretext andproceeded directly from the Suwanee villages to Pensacola, which he besieged forthe next five months. This siege actually lasted a month longer than thecampaign against the Indians. The Spanish acknowledged reality and signed atreaty in 1819, transferring title to the Americans in 1821 (Fairbanks 1978:183185; McReynolds 1957: 7387; Sattler 1987: 8788). Despite his pretext ofsubduing the Indians, Jackson never negotiated a treaty with the FloridaIndians. It was not until 1823 that such a treaty was finally signed. The Treatyof Camp Moultry set the stage for the next phase of Seminole history (McReynolds1957: 88101).During the period 1780 to 1825, all three Seminole groups emerged as unified,independent chiefdoms. The political unification of the Alachua and Mi-"},{"pageContent":"Page 56kasuki clearly predated this period, and that of the Apalachicola Seminole mayhave also. The three chiefdoms achieved independence from the Lower Creek atdifferent times, largely reflecting their proximity to the latter. The Alachuaaccomplished this earliest, being essentially autonomous by the end of theAmerican Revolution and completely so by the 1790s. The Mikasuki and Talahassiachieved full independence by the beginning of the nineteenth century. TheApalachicola, closest to the Lower Creek settlements and the least numerous,only achieved full independence after 1818.The Alachua Seminole were the most centralized and, prior to the arrival of theRedsticks, the largest of these chiefdoms. By 1820 they comprised fivesubchiefdoms, each with several villages, including Alachua, Tohopikalika,Okliwaha, Chukochati, Talakchapko, and Opilaklikaha (see figure 4). 29 TheAlachua chief ruled as paramount chief over the whole body and took the rifleMikkonapa, or top chief.30 Either his brother or nephew served as paramount warchief and normally succeeded him. The paramounts also employed dynasticmarriages to bind subordinate chiefs to them (U.S. Congress 18321861, IndianAffairs 2: 411412; Fairbanks 1974: 242272; Porter 1951b, 1952; Sattler 1987:9699; Williams 1837: 214).31The Seminole in Apalachi, known collectively as Mikasuki, comprised at least sixtowns with numerous villages stretching from Lake Miccosukee in the east to theOchlockonee and Little Rivers in the west and south to St. Marks. These townswere organized into at least two subchiefdoms, Talahassi and Mikasuki (seefigure 4). The latter provided the paramount chief throughout the period 1780 to1825, but little else was recorded regarding their internal organization.Following the Redstick War in 1814, this group also incorporated the Redstickrefugees from Atasi, Fushachi, Kolomi, and Talsi (U.S. Congress 18321861, IndianAffairs 2: 413, 439; Grant 1980: 708709; Hambly and Doyle 1818; Sattler1987:100104).The Apalachicola Seminole also formed a unified chiefdom in 1820. The five townsmaking up this group (Ikanchati, Tamali, Attapalka, Ochisi, and Yawohli) eachhad its own chief, but all acknowledged the authority of the paramount, who hadthe authority to depose a subordinate town chief. Like the Alachua, theApalachicola paramounts used dynastic marriages to bind subordinate chiefs.Yellowhair of Tamali was paramount chief in 1818 but was succeeded by Blount ofYawohli shortly afterward. The latter was succeeded by Nokus Yahola (JohnYellowhair), chief of Tamali and son of Yellowhair. This pattern of rotationalsuccession is extremely unusual for the Muskogee but resembles that reported forthe Guale and the Apalachi in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (Hann1988; Sattler 1987: 99100; Swanton 1922: 8489; Westcott 1833b; Young 1934). Thisgroup achieved full independence only in consequence of the First Seminole Warin 1818 and the Treaty of Camp"},{"pageContent":"Page 57Moultry. The authority of Kawita, however, seemed rather nominal prior to thattime. The other towns on the lower Chattahoochee and Flint Rivers eitherreturned to the Lower Creek or joined the Mikasuki and Alachua in Florida (seefigure 7) (U.S. Congress 18321861, Indian Affairs 2: 413, 439; McReynolds 1957:7387).Following the American Revolution, the Florida Indians and some of those at theforks of the Apalachicola established separate identities from the Creek. WhileAmericans and Creek referred to them collectively as Seminole, they lacked aunified identity at this time. Instead they possessed disparate identities asmembers of several paramount chiefdoms.While there are no reports of conflicts between the Florida chiefdoms, there isno evidence for any unifying organization either. In fact, the three groups eachshowed considerable independence of action and actively pursued independentcourses (Fairbanks 1974: 74; Sattler 1987: 83).Conflict and Consolidation, 1822 to 1835The period immediately following the American conquest of Florida was one ofconsiderable turmoil for the Indians. Several towns had been destroyed, andresidents of a number of others had fled into the unsettled regions to the southand east. More important, the American government insisted on treating theIndians as a single, unified tribe. As such, the Americans intended to relocateall of the Seminole onto a single reserve, whose location was not decided until1822.In response to American demands, the disparate Seminole groups formed a unifiedcouncil to deal with them. This council included all the Redstick towns, theAlachua, the Apalachee Seminole, and the Apalachicola Seminole. One Hichititown, Tottolosi Talofa, participated as well. This council existed, initially,simply to deal with the Americans and to negotiate a new treaty with them. Ithad no enforcement powers, and its only official was a speaker. This office,largely symbolic and honorary, was given to Hiniha Imala, mikko of TottolosiTalofa, in recognition of the fact that his was the first town burned in thelate war (Fairbanks 1974: 265; Sattler 1987: 104105).The treaty, signed in 1823, clearly reveals the lack of unity. Under itsprovisions, virtually all the Seminole were to be located on a singlereservation in central Florida near the existing Alachua settlements. Separatereservations for six Apalachicola chiefs and their followers were established onthe Apalachicola River. Hiniha Imala was one of these chiefs, but most of histown seems not to have joined him there (McReynolds 1957: 88102).Various difficulties beset implementation of the treaty, including opposition bythe Indians. Those in the Apalachee region and on the Apalachicola had no desireto be removed. Conversely, the Alachua, in whose territory the"},{"pageContent":"Page 58reservation was located, did not welcome an influx of people from otherchiefdoms who did not recognize their suzerainty. In consequence, it was notuntil 1825 that Indians from the Apalachicola River and Apalachee were removedto their new homes (U.S. Congress 18321861, Indian Affairs 2: 618, 620621,625626).This conflict over removal to the new reservation further revealed theinsubstantial nature of the Seminole council. In 1824, Governor Duval of FloridaTerritory deposed Hiniha Imala for resisting the removal efforts and replacedhim with the Mikasuki mikko, Takosa Mikko (John Hicks). Not only did theSeminole tolerate this unprecedented and unique event, they unanimously approvedit (U.S. Congress 18321861, Indian Affairs 2: 689690; McReynolds 1957: 106). TheSeminole clearly placed little significance on this council, other than as amechanism for dealing with the Americans, since such interference in internalpolitics was never tolerated in any other context.The council was transformed into a true government after the northern townsremoved to the new reservation. In 1825, an election was held, and Takosa Imalaof Mikasuki was selected paramount chief of the whole body. George McCall, whowitnessed the event, described the installation of the new paramount as anelaborate affair with more than 100 participants and 2,000 spectators. After hewas installed, Takosa Imala pledged to enforce the laws and punish violators whobroke the laws of either tribe, and shortly after had two violators punished(McCall 1974: 152156). Conflicts between the Alachua and Mikasuki continued,however, and Takosa Imala was replaced by Mikkonapa, paramount chief of theAlachua, in 1833 (U.S. Congress 18321861, Indian Affairs 2: 630631, 636637, 694;McCall 1974: 157; Sprague 1847: 79; Sattler 1987: 105106).The new Seminole council grew progressively unified and effective between 1825and 1835. In part, this evolution reflected the need for greater cooperation onthe restricted reservation. Increasing pressure by the United States on theSeminole to sell their Florida lands and remove west of the Mississippi alsocontributed to growing unification.The powers of the chief and unity of the council were well illustrated by theexecution of Charley Amarthla (Chali Imala) and actions early in the SecondSeminole War in December 1835. The council ordered Charley Amarthla's executionfor cooperating with the American removal effort. A party of warriors fromseveral different towns under the command of Osceola (Asi Yahola), war chief ofthe Talsi, carried out the sentence. Several military actions early in theSecond Seminole War involved close cooperation and coordinated action by diverseelements of the Seminole. The ambush of Dade's command near Tampa Bay and thesimultaneous execution of Wiley Thompson, U.S. Indian agent, at Fort Kinginvolved 400 to 1,000 warriors in locations ninety"},{"pageContent":"Page 59miles apart. The Battle of the Withlacoochee with U.S. troops under GeneralGaines in February 1836 likewise involved several hundred warriors from severaldifferent towns (U.S. Congress 18321861, Military Affairs 6: 561563, 565; Potter1836: 9497, 102116, 143147; Sprague 1847: 8893, 110111).In form the Seminole national council resembled those of the paramount chiefdomsand that of the Creek Confederacy. It consisted of the chiefs and principalofficials of each of the Seminole towns and had a principal chief, speaker, warchief, and other officials like the towns and paramount chiefdoms. The office ofprincipal chief remained hereditary in the line of the Alachua paramounts until1885. American observers reported that the principal chief had absoluteauthority over the whole, as did the other chiefs in their own towns (Bemrose1966: 15; Harney 1837: 870871; McCall 1974: 156, 221; Perryman 1817: 8; Simmons1973: 71, 77; Sprague 1847: 88, 93). 32 Clearly, the Seminole followed earliersociopolitical models in developing this new government.One innovation was the appointment of Takosa Imala as principal war chief afterMikkonapa's accession to office. This pattern of appointing the war chief fromthe Mikasuki chiefdom continued through the Second Seminole War (Hitchcock 1837:518531; Sattler 1987: 105107, 141146; Westcott 1833a: 9697).33This development marked the first emergence of a unitary Seminole identity.Unity, however, was fragile, and dissidents were common and often followedindependent courses. The separation of the tribe into friendly and hostilefactions during the Second Seminole War clearly revealed these divisions. Onlyafter removal to Indian Territory did this unified identity become fixed andencompass the Apalachicola as well (McReynolds 1957: 159173, 243289; Sattler1987: 106107, 176214).34Among the Florida Seminole after 1840, fragmentation and dislocation resulted inthe creation of novel sociopolitical relations. Earlier political ideologiesinfluenced these new forms, but reduced circumstances and altered materialconditions precluded following older practices. As a result, Florida Seminoleethnic identity became more diffuse and relied more on kinship and ritual bases(Fairbanks 1978; Sturtevant 1971).35ConclusionThe eastern Muskogean people retained the same political models and forms in theeighteenth century that they had had in the sixteenth century. Events during theintervening period and conditions in the eighteenth century, however, hadweakened the power of the chiefdoms and the paramount chiefs. These conditionsincreased divisions within the chiefdoms, particularly the multiethnic LowerCreek, and encouraged dissidents to secede. The presence"},{"pageContent":"Page 60of vacant lands in northern Florida and weak Spanish control over the regionprovided a vital opportunity for secession. The success of the Kawita paramountchiefs in international affairs and the protection offered by the emergent CreekConfederacy, however, kept the dissidents from completely severing ties.After 1720 immigrants from the Lower Creek colonized northern Florida. Corporategroups, primarily incorporated Apalachi and Yamasi, apparently initiated thisimmigration. The immigrants established new chiefdoms in Florida which closelyfollowed older Muskogee patterns, though settlements may have been somewhat moredispersed. 36 While they established separate chiefdoms in Florida at this time,the proto-Seminole settlements still acknowledged Kawita's suzerainty, ifsomewhat distantly (Sturtevant 1971; Fairbanks 1978).Changing geopolitical and world economic conditions following the AmericanRevolution increased both centralization and conflicts within the CreekConfederacy, while eroding the power and authority of the paramount chiefs. Astheir interests diverged from those of the confederacy, the Seminole paramountspursued a more independent course, resulting in full autonomy and separation.Other minority groups within the confederacy followed similar, though lesssuccessful, strategies of independence.Unification of the Seminole occurred only under external pressure from theUnited States, although it also reflected the need for greater internalcooperation and the resolution of disputes between chiefdoms in a morerestricted area. Consolidation, however, followed existing Muskogee models, andthe new tribal government resembled those of the older paramount chiefdoms.Unification also met some opposition as paramounts and subchiefs sought topreserve their own power or pursued personal and group interests. The Seminoletook thirty years to complete the process, and then only after the defection ofseveral chiefs and their followers.The process of Seminole ethnogenesis and unification must be seen within thecontext of the interaction of aboriginal sociopolitical models and shiftinggeopolitical situations. Native elites contended for power and prestige,pursuing personal and group interests, within this context. In doing so, theylargely maintained the earlier sociopolitical models, rather than replacing themand developing novel modes of organization. These aboriginal models, in force inthe sixteenth century, retained much of their force and legitimacy among theSeminole and Creek at least until the 1850s and to some extent to the present inOklahoma.Seminole withdrawal and later separation represented rebellions and secession,rather than sociopolitical transformation. Subordinate chiefs, largely fromconquered or incorporated minority groups, sought to expand their"},{"pageContent":"Page 61power and independence at the expense of the paramount chiefs of Kawita. In theprocess they challenged the legitimacy of the paramounts but not of thesociopolitical models, which they replicated in their new locations. Inmobilizing support for their claims, these rebellious chiefs employed numerousstrategies, including ethnic identity, kinship, and economic or politicaladvantage.Such rebellions were not new and were documented for the early-sixteenth-centurysoutheastern chiefdoms, as well as for similar polities elsewhere. The reducedpower of the eighteenth-century paramount chiefs, owing to reduced populationsand resources and increased geopolitical instability, fostered such separatistmovements by subordinate chiefs. Because of the recent formation of theirchiefdom and externally induced disruptions, the paramounts of Kawita also hadnot consolidated their position and were particularly susceptible to challenge.Many dissident chiefs sought to reconstitute earlier independent paramountchiefdoms, albeit in new configurations or locations. These new chiefdoms werefrequently multiethnic, but this situation also reflected older patterns. Eventhe formation of multiethnic communities was not novel.The new chiefdoms in Florida assumed different names, thus creating new ethnicidentities, also in keeping with aboriginal practice. Ethnic identity in theaboriginal Southeast largely reflected political unity along with sharedlanguage, ritual, and descent. The dynamics of chiefly sociopoliticalorganization in the region imposed linguistic and religious unity, whilefostering intermarriage and shared descent.Descriptions of Seminole towns from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuriesclearly indicate the existence of square grounds and regular Muskogeeinstitutions and forms of government (Bartram 1848, 1927; Porter 1952; Young1934; U.S. Congress 18321861, Military Affairs 1:681749, 6: 5680, 450574, 7:870871). Most direct observers of both groups in fact make no distinctionbetween the two and indicate that Seminole practices are identical to those ofthe Creek.Assumptions that the Seminole created novel forms of social and politicalrelations rest on several grounds, all suspect. First, Lower Creek leaders andEuropean or American observers, all of whom were politically interested parties,frequently stated that the Seminole towns were ''made up\" and derived fromseveral different Creek towns. Second, all three of the Seminole regional groupscontained towns of differing ethnic origins.Reports that the early Seminole towns were made up of people from various townslikely indicate that they drew Apalachi and Yamasi previously incorporated intoother towns, as well as their relatives and friends, rather than a lack ofcorporate structure and identity. Similar accusations were made concerning theTamali and Yufala Hopoya, who were clearly corporate and fol-"},{"pageContent":"Page 62lowed established Creek patterns (Swanton 1922: 181184, 261263). Suchaccusations that a town is invented or improperly constituted remain a centralelement in Oklahoma Seminole and Creek political rhetoric as a means ofdiscrediting political rivals. 37Likewise, multiethnic chiefdoms were not uncommon in the sixteenth century andclearly represent a longstanding pattern in the region, rather than aninnovation (Hudson 1990; Hann 1988: 2469). As mentioned, however, paramountsimposed a degree of linguistic and ritual hegemony over subject chiefdoms. Overtime this process would create unified ethnic identity within the chiefdom.Multiethnic settlements were also common, at least by the early eighteenthcentury. Most of the Lower Creek towns contained people from other groups atthis time, and several Apalachi settlements were also multiethnic in theseventeenth century (Hann 1988: 2469). The important factor in determiningidentity in these communities and chiefdoms was the composition of the corepopulations, particularly the elites.All the major Seminole groups showed considerable continuity through time.Talahassi, Mikasuki, Ochisi, Alachua, Yufala, and others exist throughout theperiod prior to Removal and continue among the Oklahoma Seminole. If theSeminole were less corporate than the Creek there should have been more fluidityand less permanence. Furthermore, the Oklahoma Seminole today hold to Creekpolitical models and clearly did so throughout the nineteenth century (Sattler1987).Traditional Muskogee concepts of political legitimacy imposed importantconstraints on group formation and claims to rulership. As stated previously,legitimacy derived from lineage and control over intangible assets, primarilyinherited sacred power and knowledge (Sattler 1987: 5255, 1992; Hudson 1990:50).38 Establishing a new town required access to a sacred fire, which could notsimply be invented or created, and to its rituals (Sattler 1987: 4445, 5255,1992).Dissident leaders who wished to found new towns therefore had to establishpublicly acknowledged access to sacred power and knowledge. Such access waslargely determined by descent and lineage. Leaders also had to recruit thesupport of others who could fill other essential leadership positions,principally those of the hiniha and priest. These positions also depended inpart on descent as well as on specialized training, and the hiniha officebelonged to a clan other than that of the mikko (Bartram 1848: 2127, 3941, 1927:388392, 399, 400401; Hawkins 1848: 6775; Sattler 1987: 5152, 5557).These conditions largely limited leadership to those of demonstrable \"royal\"lineage. Among the Lower Creek this group included both those belonging to theclans of the existing mikkos and those of formerly royal Apala-"},{"pageContent":"Page 63chi and Yamasi lineages. The former may have been less likely to secede sincethey partially shared the power of the mikkos and had opportunities for highoffice. This was particularly true during the early eighteenth century, whenLower Creek population reached an initial nadir. Not only was the totalpopulation of the towns low, but royal clans were not normally the largest.Junior members of the royal lineages or members of junior lineages within theroyal clans were probably responsible for establishing the numerous \"daughtertowns\" and outsettlements in the late eighteenth century after the populationrebounded. Incorporated Apalachi and Yamasi, however, generally enjoyed no suchbenefits and faced limited opportunities for advancement. Even where theycontrolled separate towns, these were subordinate to Kawita and the Muskogeetowns. It is therefore not surprising that the identifiable leaders and townsinvolved in the early formation of the Seminole derived from these groups.Immigration thus reflected a counterhegemonic response by ethnic groups andleaders subordinate to Kawita's suzerainty.Dissident leaders derived support through a variety of other mechanisms. Kinshipclearly provided a basis for recruiting followers and would have included bothconsanguinal and affinal relatives. 39 Shared ethnic identity provided anothersource, as did promises of economic and political advantage.While these polities derived primarily from the Apalachi and Yamasi, they wereundoubtedly multiethnic. Both groups intermarried extensively with each otherand with other Lower Creek towns (Fitch 1916; Taitt 1916). The new settlementswould have drawn affinal relatives from other groups, as well as friends andassociates seeking the greater economic or political opportunities availablethere.In both Alachua and Apalachee, the immigrants also seem to have incorporatedearlier settlements of refugee Apalachi, Yamasi, and probably Timucuan, none ofwhom had joined the Lower Creek after 1715. Most authorities have assumed thatall the refugee populations were either absorbed by the Creek or settled nearSt. Augustine, Pensacola, and Mobile following the Yamasee War of 1715. Thepopulation data make this unlikely, however. A comparison of populationestimates for the Lower Creek, Apalachicola, Yamasi, and Apalachi from 1715 inCarolina and Georgia with those of the known settlements in the twenty yearsfollowing the war shows a marked disparity (Rivers 1874: 94; Boyd 1949; Glover1725). Such a massive population loss would require far higher mortality amongthe Indians than is indicated in the records of the war.40Ethnic identity among the Seminole, and in the Southeast generally, thereforelargely reflected political alignments. Political ideology remained conservativeover three centuries, though political realities shifted markedly.

To avoid confusion, this term will beemployed here to designate the minimal self-governing units, known as \"towns\" or\"bands\" in English. Larger units will be referred to as chiefdoms, and villagesunder the direct control of another town will be referred to as settlements. Thelatter term also applies to villages whose status is uncertain.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 3.While these descent groups included lineages, clans, and phratries by thebeginning of the eighteenth century, the evidence does not indicate the natureof the earlier descent groups. The universality of matrilineality among theMuskogean peoples argues that this descent rule pertained earlier.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 4.Household contributions to the public granaries are often treated as voluntarycontributions to the commonweal. There is no indication, however, that anyoneever failed to contribute. During the nineteenth century, the tastanaki enforcedsuch contributions, as well as participation in corvée labor (Reynolds 1867:328). Under such conditions, these are more realistically termed taxes.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 5.Brim of Kawita was paramount chief of the Lower Creek from before the YamaseeWar to the early 1730s and a primary architect of the Creek Confederacy. He wasunquestionably one of the greatest statesmen of the era. His successors havemaintained his foreign policy but seem less successful at domestic policy(Fairbanks 1974: 101105; Juricek 1987: 7885, 110118, 181193).4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 6.The minor shifts in membership, which were not always accompanied by relocationof the towns, also argue that these were primarily political rather thangeographic divisions. Likewise, shifts in power among towns within the divisionsreflect processes common in chiefdoms and other centralized polities.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 7.The Lower Creek temporarily relocated to the Okmulgee and Oconee Rivers between1690 and 1715 but returned to the Chattahoochee following the Yamasee War(Bolton 1925: 55; Crane 1928: 168179, 254).4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 8.The origins of the Taskigi remain somewhat obscure, though they are supposed tobe from the north (probably the Tennessee River) and to have originally spoken adifferent language (Swanton 1922: 207211). Diego Peña referred to this languageas the \"diamaza tongue\" in 1716 (Peña 1716). This may be a copying error forChickasaw.

Linguistically, these four townsare Muskogee speakers, while the other Chattahoochee groups speak Hichiti(Swanton 1922). While Kawita does not appear in the sixteenth-centuryexploration documents, both Kasihta and Taskiki are mentioned as subjects ofKusa in the Coosa-Tallapoosa drainage (Hudson 1990: 104).4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 10.The Yamasi were a successor to the sixteenth-century Ocute chiefdom on the UpperAltamaha, Okmulgee, and Oconee Rivers. By 1715 they had incorporated remnants ofthe Guale from the Georgia coast and had relocated to the South Carolina coastabove the Savannah River. Following their defeat in the Yamasee War of 1715, theYamasi towns dispersed widely. In addition to those who joined the Lower Creek,several towns settled near St. Augustine, and some settled farther south alongthe Oklawaha River (Delahaye 1740; Jefferys 1761). The Apalachi originallyoccupied northwestern Florida between the Ochlockonee and Aucilla Rivers andwere missionized by the Spanish in the 1630s. In 1704, a combined force of SouthCarolina colonists, Lower Creek, and Yamasi conquered the Apalachi and destroyedtheir towns. The survivors were widely dispersed. A significant number wereenslaved by the Carolinians. Others fled to St. Augustine, Pensacola, andMobile. The majority, however, relocated northward, where they settled either inthe Lower Creek towns on the Okmulgee and Oconee Rivers or in four towns on theSavannah River. The latter comprised over 600 people in 1715. Like the Yamasi,they were defeated and dispersed following the Yamasee War. Those who werecaptured were enslaved and shipped out of the colony. Many joined other Apalachiat the Spanish and French settlements or among the Lower Creek, but many remainunaccounted for in the records (Hann 1988: 264318).4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 11.I would suggest that the eight-day-long Apuskita or Green Corn Ceremony reportedfor Kawita and other \"Mother\" (capital) towns reflects this ritual hegemony.Other towns held four-day ceremonies, and the longer ceremonies in the capitalslikely allowed representatives of subordinate towns to attend (Swanton 1928b:546611).4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 12.Other authors (Sturtevant 1971; Fairbanks 1978) have assumed that thesesettlements abandoned the older Creek forms of organization and government. Theavailable direct descriptions from the eighteenth and early nineteenthcenturies, however, indicate the existence of square grounds and regularMuskogee institutions (Bartram 1848, 1927; Porter 1952; Young 1934).4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 13.While Porter (1952) identifies Simpukasi with the later figures, particularly"},{"pageContent":"Page 664171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] withSampiaffi (Muskogee, Simiapaya), I feel this identification is erroneous. Bothnames are properly titles, rather than personal names. Simpukasi means \"with theleader,\" while Simiapaya designates an official who acted as a representative ofthe italwa (Hewitt 1939: 138139). A twenty-year absence from the records seemsunlikely given his earlier prominence and the fact that his uncle Chilokilichiremains prominent as Chikilli during this period.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 14.The recorded version is somewhat garbled and wrongly identifies Simpukasi withthe Alachua Seminole but is still significant.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 15.In a statement made in Havana on December 22, 1777, he specifically says that\"ever since he learned how to manage firearms, he came to live with them at thebefore mentioned fort San Marcos de Apalachee, where he remained.\" This wouldindicate an age of about fifteen, when Creek and Seminole boys became designatedgunmen. Since he earlier stated he was nine or ten years old during thegovernorship of Antonio Benavides, this would place his emigration to the areabetween 1724 and 1740. He also states he acted as a courier for the Spanishcommander at St. Marks for about twenty years, clearly placing him in the areaby 1743.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 16.Because this tradition was collected from members of several different Seminoletowns, some not closely tied to Talahassi, it carries some weight. Had it comeonly from Talahassi or from members of towns closely tied to it, the statementwould be rather suspect.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 17.Barcía indicates that there may have been Apalachi settlements in the areaaround Apalachee, though north of the former Apalachi settlements and the latersite of St. Marks, as early as 1718 (Barcía Carballido y Zuñiga 1951: 366).Governor Dionisio de la Vega reported in 1728 that the Indians in Apalachee hadrevolted the previous year and that those who remained hostile had withdrawnfrom the area of the fort (Swanton 1922: 127). Other statements that there wereonly a few Indians at St. Marks also leave open the possibility ofBritish-allied Indians in the region (Auxiliary Bishop of Florida 1736).4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 18.William Bartram's description of this town in 1775 seems to conflate it with theTalahassi town in the Apalachee region (Bartram 1927: 180), but it also appearson the Stuart-Purcell map of the road from Pensacola to St. Augustine (Stuartand Purcell 1778).4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 19.Bartram also describes at least two other unnamed villages on the St. JohnsRiver (Bartram 1927: 9596, 180).4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 20.Swanton assumes this town was established by the Upper Creek Yufala town, butthe evidence really does not support this interpretation. While Romans statesthat Chukochati was settled from the Upper Creek Yufala, he uses the term ratherloosely in places to include the Lower Creek. Likewise, while the population ofthis town decreased by 50 between 1764 and 1793, that of Yufala Hopoya droppedby 100 (Farmar 1764; Olivier 1793).4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 21.The name may be properly Okonni and is often spelled with a double n in earlyEnglish documents.

The Creek Chikota clan corresponds to theApalachi Chuguta, Ispani to Esfan, and Kowi or Koi to Cui. Likewise, Nokfilhaclan, whose name has no meaning in Muskogee, translates as \"good things\" inApalachi (Haas 1975: 288). Some or all of the reported but largely extinct Creekclans Osana (otter), Asun(wa) (Spanish moss), and Sonaki (toad) may correspondto the Apalachi Osan(ac) (Swanton 1928a: 159161).4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 24.Only two traders were located in Seminole towns at Alachua and SuwaniTalahassochi. The remaining trading posts were established on the borders of theSeminole territory and at the Spanish fort at St. Marks. The Spanishgovernment's desire to control and regulate trade, particularly to preventillegal trade with the British colonies, thus converged with the desires of theSeminole chiefs.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 25.Alexander McGillivray, the son of a Scots trader and an Alabama woman, was themost powerful man in the Creek Confederacy during the 1780s. Despite the factthat many referred to him as the \"chief\" of the confederacy, the only office heheld was that of war chief, a subordinate position. He manipulated thisposition, an appointment as Spanish \"commissary\" to the Creek, and a silentpartnership in Panton, Leslie and Company, who dominated the southern Indiantrade, along with impressive personal wealth bequeathed by his father, todominate the confederacy (Sattler 1987: 6466).4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 26.This may have reflected either normal matrilineal succession or a moresignificant usurpation of power. While Kapicha Mikko's parentage isundocumented, his mother may have been a \"sister\" of Tonapi. Dynastic marriageswere a regular feature among the Florida chiefdoms. In such cases women went tolive with their chiefly husbands rather than follow the normal matrilocalpattern (Sattler 1987: 7273, 1989). Conversely, the Mikasuki had been at thecenter of various conflicts with the Creek authorities. They were prominentamong Bowles's supporters in 1804 and active Redsticks after 1812 (Kinnaird1931a; Kinnaird and Kinnaird 1983; Sattler 1987: 7273). Such actions mayrepresent an assertion of power and influence in opposition to Talahassi.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 27.While Maroon communities existed in Florida earlier under the Spanish prior to1763, there is no evidence that they formed any connection with the Seminole orthat they formed a part of the later Seminole Maroons. The available evidenceindicates that the earlier Maroons in fact left with the Spanish in 1763. Mostreferences to the later Maroons indicate that they had moved to Florida duringor after the American Revolution (McReynolds 1957: 23, 84; Mulroy 1993: 612;Sturtevant 1971: 106108).4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 28.In response to embassies by the Shawnee leader, Tecumseh, the nativisticRedstick Movement emerged among the Upper Creek.

The Alachua were the descendants of the original Okoni settlers underMikkonapa. The Oklawaha, under the chief Yaha Hacho, represented the olderYamasi population. The Chukochati, under Halpata Hacho, originated from theYufala Hopoya. The Hotalihuyana, also called Talakchapko, were Okmalki-Chiahasettled on the Pease River under Opony, who probably settled there in part inthe 1790s. The Opilaklikaha were Maroons under Abraham. The Tohopikalika, underthe leadership of Philip or Imala, are of unknown derivation but may representthe earlier Talofa Okhassi. They also included a Maroon community under JohnCaesar (Bemrose 1966: 70; Porter 1946a).4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 30.While this is generally considered the personal name of the Alachua chief duringthe 1820s and 1830s, his uncle, Payne, also employed this title in 1802 (Morales1802).4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 31.Philip of Tohopikalika, Abraham of Opilaklikaha, and Huti Imala (Jumper) all hadwives given them by Payne or Mikkonapa.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 32.The same reports also state that the chiefs were marked by particularlysumptuous dress.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 33.This ascendancy of the Alachua also may reflect older sociopolitical models, asthe reservation was in their territory.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 34.Even after Removal, Seminole identity remained fluid, and many towns vacillatedbetween Creek and Seminole identity. It was not until the late 1850s that theSeminole achieved their final configuration, when dissident elements, includingmost Redsticks and some Apalachicola, rejoined the Creek.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 35.It is noteworthy in this regard that most of the remaining Seminole leaders inFlorida after removal were war chiefs (tastanaki) and priests (Sprague 1847).4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 36.A more dispersed pattern of scattered hamlets around a smaller central villagewas typical both earlier and later in more favored conditions.

There were severalother bases of power. Socially, they were the most senior men in their italwa.Economically, they collected taxes from within the italwa and tribute fromsubordinate polities.

For persons or groups who are to constitute a new ethnic entity,separation amounts to the negation or severing of their existing grouployalties. In the liminal phase, survivingusually dysfunctionalsocial and/oreconomic ties wither away, and alternative connections are initiated orstrengthened. Reintegration means that a new identity is consolidated, affirmedthrough ritual and the adoption of a validating mythology. This phase sets thecourse for future collective consciousness; it may obscure all traces of theearlier history (or histories) of the population and even promote a belief in amiraculous origin or special creation. While the term ethnogenesis itself wouldseem to imply a special attention to the third phase, the formation of the newidentity, it is obvious that the prior phases are also crucial to the process.In fact, research interest has more often been directed toward the discovery ofprevious identity and the consequences of cultural death than to the history andcircumstances of reintegration.In essence, ethnogenesis can be no more than an outcome of the universalworkings of culture change, which are constant and ongoing. Economic and socialrelations are frequently in flux, a fact which is reflected in shifts in socialalliances and in the formation of new political groupings. However, it is rapidand wholesale changes of this sort which appear as apparent discontinuities inthe historical record. These bring an air of mystery to the subject in the guise"},{"pageContent":"Page 71of ''lost civilizations\" and new tribes which seem to \"emerge\" out of nowhere,without obvious predecessors. Examples of such seeming discontinuity can readilybe recalled worldwide (e.g., the demise of the Maya Old Empire, the appearanceof the Scythians), but among the tribes of the Great Plains, at the dawn ofhistory, it seems to have been the norm. Between the identifiable prehistoriccultures and the historic tribes of the region there is an interval of a centuryor more, typically characterized by rapid overall change and the interminglingof previously disparate cultural traits and complexes.In his book The Cheyenne Nation, John Moore (1987) posits the existence, in lateprehistoric times, of three independent Algonkian-speaking villages which, inthe course of the seventeenth century, shifted westward from the Great Lakesregion into the Plains and in so doing adopted a seminomadic style of life.Moore traces the transition of these groups to the full nomadism of huntingbands and documents their conjunction, with segments of allied tribes, in theformation of the Cheyenne camp circle. He thus reveals the Cheyenne tribe to bea complex whole built of diverse components and brought, in the changingpolitical setting of the northern Plains, to a nationhood formalized by theadoption of a charter and symbolized by the organization and performance of theSun Dance.Moore suggests that other Plains peoples are the products of similar pluralisticorigins. I believe that those whom we know as Kiowa have undergone experiencesof separation, transition, and reintegration during a history which can beshown, in a general way, to parallel that of the Cheyenne. However, the detailsof these histories are evidently quite different; cultural resemblances betweenthe historic tribes may be seen as a kind of convergence, under the levelinginfluence of similar ecological and political milieus.In this essay, I attempt a preliminary formulation of Kiowa ethnogenesis. As theinitial phase, I examine the cultural death of one ethnic entity, the Jumano ofthe South Plains. The Jumano were well known to Spanish explorers and colonistsin the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries but disappeared from the historicalrecord soon thereafter. I infer the possible course of events during a liminalperiod which began as Jumano identity eroded and which brought the survivingpopulation into new geographical and social settings. In the reintegrativephase, a century after the Jumano diaspora, I suggest that eastern remnant bandsformed the nucleus for the emergence of the Kiowa nation.The Jumano at the Dawn of HistorySixteenth- and seventeenth-century accounts of Spanish exploration andcolonization often mention a wandering nación which inhabited much of the SouthPlains east of the Rio Grande. This people, the Jumano, 1 were a conge-"},{"pageContent":"Page 720072-01.GIF [2a4d834c3901bca2f789d4f44c092917.gif]Figure 1.The South Plains showing the location of the Jumano, ca. 1630, andmajor trade routes with neighboring peoples.ries of interrelated bands indigenous to this region, evidently corresponding toa continuation of the late prehistoric Jornada culture (Campbell n.d.). Theirlikely linguistic affiliation, Tanoan, links them to the eastern and southernPueblo tribes of New Mexico (Hickerson 1988). Sites associated with the Jornada,a marginal extension of the southwestern Mogollon tradition, show traces of alate transition to bison hunting and indications of trade contacts both with thenuclear Southwest and with agricultural tribes of the eastern Plains. Similarly,the historic Jumano were known to the Spaniards as bison hunters and traders.A series of regional trade partnerships linked individual Jumano bands toagricultural communities from New Mexico to La Junta de los Rios, the confluenceof the Rio Grande and the Río Conchos. They moved seasonally between theirhunting grounds in the South Plains and the Rio Grande Valley, where certainfrontier villages were centers for their trade. In the Plains, the Jumano werealso in contact with a number of eastern and southern tribes; they are known tohave traveled as far as Quivira, beyond the Arkansas River, and the Hasinai (orCaddo) in eastern Texas.Since their contacts extended into Mexico, it is possible that the Jumano hadsome knowledge of horses prior to 1570, when a Spanish exploring party left ahorse in a Jumano village near La Junta de los Rios. A few decades later,"},{"pageContent":"Page 73at the time of Salas's expedition, the Jumano in the Plains east of New Mexicomay have been partly equestrian. By 1680, in any case, the Jumano wereconducting a large-scale trade in horses and were evidently using horses andwagons to haul goods eastward from La Junta de los Rios. At this date, late intheir history, theylike the Kiowa two centuries laterfollowed a way of lifewhich hinged on bison hunting, horse pastoralism, and trade.The role of the Jumano as traders probably originated as an extension of a longhistory as nomadic hunters. By the time of the Spanish entradas, they werealready specialized in this role to a degree. There were Jumano enclavecommunities in gateway locations in the pueblos, at La Junta, and at the borderof Quivira (the gran población encountered by the Oñate expedition). Theprocessing and warehousing cadres at these sites were seasonally augmented byincrements from the Plains, as nomadic hunters and itinerant traders arrived anddeparted. At rendezvous sites in the High Plains of West Texas, contacts betweenJumano bands would have been the occasion for exchanges of goods; this increasedthe circulation of exotic trade wares (such as New Mexican turquoise and mineralpigments, Mexican copper bells and macaw feathers, Alibates flint, westernobsidian, Rio Concho pearls, and seashells from the Gulfs of Mexico andCalifornia).Through the seventeenth century, the Spanish colonies evidently considered theJumano to be an important economic and political power, valued especially as alink to the Nations of the North, the Caddoan tribes and confederacies. Duringthese years, the name \"Jumano\" was evidently used in two related senses. First,and earliest, it was a generic term which the Spaniards applied to people of acertain cultural and linguistic type who were widespread along and east of theRio Grande and in the South Plains. In a narrower sense, the term referred toIndians of this type in their role as traders. In this capacity, they could befound far from their bases near the Rio Grande and well outside of their huntingrange in the South Plains. This second usage had become predominant in the lastdecades of the seventeenth century; by this time, the Jumano people hadabandoned or been driven from most of their earlier territories, and theirpresence is principally documented in peripheral areas, both east and west.Separation: The Jumano DiasporaThe late seventeenth century was the period of the rapid decline of the Jumanowhich so intrigued Bandelier (1890), Hodge (1911), Bolton (1911), and others.The \"mystery\" of Jumano disappearance from the historical record continued to bea popular topic of scholarly speculation until 1940, when Scholes and Mera wentso far as to propose, in effect, that such a tribe had never really existed; thename, they argued, was simply a synonym for rayado (striped or"},{"pageContent":"Page 74painted people) (1940: 275). For several decades, this formulation has beenwidely accepted as a solution to the \"Jumano problem.\"Such rumors to the contrary, however, my research indicates that the Jumano werean authentic people who did not disappear mysteriously. Rather, theirterritories were preempted and the survivors became scattered as a consequenceof more than a century of intermittent warfare. In this struggle, which wasalready in progress during the years of Spanish exploration and colonization,the contending parties were, on one side, a wave of invading Apache and, on theother, the Jumano and their allies. The confrontation continued sporadicallythrough the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, with the invaders advancingfrom the north and west, while the aboriginal groups lost ground and were eitherdisplaced or incorporated by their conquerors.The Jumano-Apache war was not simply a contest over hunting grounds andterritoryit also concerned trade routes and access to trade centers. Earlyintimations of this war appear in the accounts of the Coronado expedition, whichreported that the \"Querechos\" (Apache) and \"Teyas\" (Jumano) were embattled justeast of the northernmost pueblos. Five decades later, Oñate's troops foundApache \"Vaqueros\" trading at these villages (Taos and Picuris), while battlingtheir enemies the Jumano farther south, near Pecos pueblo. Thirty years afterthis, the Apache controlled the trade at Pecos, and the Jumano had withdrawnover 100 leagues to the east.In the 1660s, the Seven Rivers Apache disrupted Jumano trade in the Tompiros,their last remaining foothold in the pueblos. Loss of this port of entry endeddirect Jumano access to the colony of New Mexico, although the Spaniardscontinued to make annual expeditions to deal with them in the Plains, and thetrade continued at El Paso and La Junta de los Rios. However, the southern traderoute, linking La Junta with Jumano rancherías in central Texas, was brokensometime during the 1680s; the Upper Colorado Valley became Apache territorysoon thereafter. At this point, Apache dominance of the South Plains wascomplete, and the Jumano were a conquered and displaced people.Much of the recorded information on the Jumano and their struggle against theApache in the South Plains derives indirectly from their efforts to win Spanishassistance to the native resistance movement. Two occasions stand out, early andlate in the century. In the 1620s, Jumano emissaries came repeatedly to theFranciscan mission at Isleta, begging for missions in the region to the east.This eventually led fray Juan de Salas to make the long trek into the Plainsdescribed in Benavides's memorial of 1630 (Ayer 19001901). The upshot of Salas'sefforts, however, was not the stabilization of the Jumano position, which theIndians evidently desired, but a missionary-assisted re-"},{"pageContent":"Page 75treat and resettlement of refugees in the Estancia Valley, east of the Tompiropueblos.More explicit appeals for Spanish military support were made at El Paso in 1681and 1682 by the Jumano chief Juan Sabeata. The accounts of the subsequentLopez-Dominguez de Mendoza expedition, which included both clergy and a militaryforce, provide detailed information on the route between La Junta de los Riosand the river that the Spaniards called \"Rio Nueces\" in central Texas anddocument the existence of a chain of Jumano settlements along the way. Oneimportant base was situated near the confluence of Toyah Creek and the RioPecos; another was located on the Rio Nueces itself, probably the Concho nearits confluence with the Colorado of Texas. It was in the Plains between thesetwo locales that the Jumano pastured the horses they traded to the Nations ofthe North. The journal of Captain Juan Dominguez de Mendoza records both theconcern of the Jumano for the safety of their herds and the very real threat ofApache raids, which resulted in the theft of both Jumano and Spanish horses(Bolton 1908: 331335). However, the colonial government of New Mexico did notcommit forces to the cause of the Jumano and their allies, and fray NicolasLopez subsequently failed to obtain support for a proposed campaign of missionbuilding in the Plains.A few years after this failed expedition, depositions taken at Parral in NuevaVizcaya, from Juan Sabeata and other native leaders, describe the annual wars ofthe Jumano with the Apache and their struggle for continuing access to the herdsof buffalo in their traditional hunting grounds (Hackett 1926: 261277). Theregion must have fallen soon thereafter, with any remaining Jumano settlementsabandoned or destroyed. In the early eighteenth century, the entire region wasoccupied by the Apache, who were soon trading and raiding at San Antonio andother new Spanish settlements in central and southern Texas.The Eastern FrontierThe foregoing account of Jumano decline and fall reflects the perspective ofSpanish observers based in New Mexico and Nueva Vizcaya. Their reports documentthe position of the Jumano in relation to the Spanish colonies; however, littleis known about the actual extent of native trade and diplomacy in the east,beyond the limits of direct Spanish rule. Indications of the nature of thesecontacts are rare, especially in the earlier period, when very few Europeansvisited the South Plains and eastern Texas.One of the earliest indications of long-distance trade of the sort conducted bythe Jumano is the mention, by the Gentleman of Elvas, of woven textiles andturquoise which the De Soto expedition found in the territory of Guasco,"},{"pageContent":"Page 76evidently on the Brazos; these things \"were brought from the direction of thesunset\" (Hodge 1911: 246247). The narrative of Cabeza de Vaca also documents theoperations of a trade network which reached as far as the Karankawa andCoahuiltecan and reveals the presence of specialized traders who had freedom ofpassage among feuding tribes and bands (Covey 1961: 6768). Interestingly enough,Cabeza de Vaca and his companions sojourned for a time with a band of traderswho carried bows and arrows into central Texas from the west, just as the Jumanodid a century later. Like the Jumano, these traders contacted their clientsduring intertribal gatherings at the time of seasonal events such as pecan orprickly pear harvests.Jumano claims of trade in Texas are echoed in French documents of the lateseventeenth century. Members of La Salle's colony learned about the visits ofJumano traders, both from the Hasinai (Tejas) and from a neighboring tribe (Cox1922: 231233). In 1686 and 1687, representatives of the French colony were ableto purchase much-needed horses in Hasinai country, noting that the animals hadbeen brought there by the Choumane (Jumano) (Cox 1922: 9394).The Manrhout and GatackaTwo letters written several years earlier by La Salle himself from the Illinoiscountry are of special interest in relation to the trade in horses. Theseletters are fragmentary and undated; however, internal evidence suggests thatone was written just prior to, and the other subsequent to, his 1682 voyage tothe mouth of the Mississippi (about the time of the Lopez-Dominguez de Mendozaexpedition in Texas). In the earlier, as part of a general discussion ofproblems of travel through the interior of the continent, La Salle raises thepossibility of obtaining horses from a native source. There are many, heindicates, to be found among the \"Pana, Paniassa, Manrhout, Gatacka, Panimahaand Pasos.\" La Salle seems uncertain about the location of these groups, whichare located \"a bit farther than one might wish\"; but he appears to believe thatthey can readily be reached, via the Missouri or, alternatively, by land, theintervening country being open (Margry 1974 [1879], 2: 168).In the second letter, La Salle recounts events of the voyage of explorationduring which he took possession of the Mississippi. Here, in an aside concerningthe rivers and peoples of North America, he again mentions the Pana and their\"neighbors and allies,\" the Manrhout and Gatacka. This time, La Salle seems tobe on surer ground and indicates the source of his information: a Pana of aroundeighteen years of age, one of a group of young men sent to him by their familiesto be educated à la françoise (Margry 1974 [1879], 2: 201)."},{"pageContent":"Page 77It can be assumed that this Pana youth represented native economic interestscompatible with the development of the trade to which La Salle also aspired. Hispeople, La Salle was told, live \"more than two hundred leagues to the west, onone of the branches of the Mississippi\" in two adjacent villages. The Gatackaand Manrhout are located to the south of these villages. They sell horses to thePana, which (La Salle assumes) they \"apparently steal from the Spaniards of NewMexico.\" He goes on to convey a good deal of information about the Indians andtheir horses: the horses could be very useful because of their hardiness. TheIndians use them in war, in hunting, and to carry their possessions; they do notuse them in farming. The horses can live out of doors, even in the snow, andneed no other food than pasturage. They are strong, of great endurance; they cancarry the meat of two buffalo. Finally, he adds that his petit Pana informanthas seen, in his country, certain stones which may be turquoise; La Salle findsthis to be a confirmation of a trade connection with the west (Margry 1974[1879], 2: 202).For present purposes, the most important information is perhaps the locations ofthe Pana, just over 200 leagues 2 from La Salle's headquarters of Fort St.Louis, and of the Manrhout and Gatacka, an unspecified distance to the south ofthe Pana. The series of names \"Pana, Paniassa . . . Panimaha\" suggests thescattered Caddoan groups west of the Mississippi. The locale, on \"one of thebranches of the Mississippi,\" is vague but indicates at least that it was not onthe Missouri, a river with which La Salle was already well acquainted; perhapsthe specific stream could not be identified from the information given by thePana youth. French maps of 1700 to 1720 show the Paniassa in locales which latercame to be identified with the Taovaya and Wichita.3 In this case, the youngman's estimate of distance would be confirmed: from Fort St. Louis, a radius of200 leagues (roughly 530 miles) intersects the Arkansas River twice, just aboveand just below the earliest documented location of the Taovaya and Wichita. Inthis connection, the reference to \"two villages, side by side\" is of specialinterest. In 1719, Claude du Tisne visited two such Paniassa villages which layroughly one league apart on a tributary of the Arkansas. There were, all told,around 300 horses in the villages at the time; silver work and other goodstestified to past trade contacts, direct or indirect, with the Spanish colonies.Horses were evidently in short supply, since the villagers were reluctant tosell them to the Frenchmen. A few individuals claimed to have visited theSpanish settlements, years past, in the company of the traders; at the time ofTisne's visit, however, the way was blocked by the Comanche (Margry 1974 [1879],4: 311314).Who were the traders, the source of the Paniassa horses? In 1682 (orthereabouts), the most likely purveyors of horses to the Taovaya and Wich-"},{"pageContent":"Page 78itathe people of Quivirawould certainly have been the Jumano. They heldterritory south of the Arkansas, carried on an active trade in horses, and dealtboth with the Spanish colonies and with Indian tribes located east of the Apachefrontier. As already indicated, there were Jumano rancherías and horse herdsalong the Upper Colorado of Texas; other Jumano bands, with their herds, mayhave been spread over a wider area, perhaps as far north as the Upper Brazos.Jumano friendship with Quivira was documented by Benavides as early as the1620s. In 1683, Juan Sabeata claimed two great Caddoan confederacies or\"kingdoms\"Quivira and Tejasas allies. Sabeata's Jumano made annual expeditionsto trade with the Tejas (Caddo or Hasinai), transporting horses as well asclothing, weapons, and other goods of Spanish manufacture. Delegations from theTejas sometimes accompanied the Jumano on visits to La Junta de los Rios;representatives from Quivira (Wichita) may have done so as well.There is no evidence that the Jumano, in the late seventeenth century, regularlyraided or stole large numbers of horses from the Spanish colonies. Rather, itwould seem that they had become true horse pastoralists and that their herds inthe South Plains were at least partly self-sustaining. The Jumano did stealhorses from their enemies, the Apache, as the Apache stole from them. But theywere at pains to maintain good relations with the Spanish colonies. Late in thecentury, circa 1685 to 1691, Juan Sabeata was named by the royal governor ofNueva Vizcaya as \"governor of the Cibolos, Jumano, and Nations of the North\"(Hackett 1934: 138; Hackett 1926: 263). In this capacity, he and his followerswere active agents of the colonial administration, serving as messengers andinformation-gatherers as well as traders in Spanish relations with the villagepeoples of the eastern Plains, notably the Caddoan tribes.But what of the names \"Manrhout\" and \"Gatacka\"? James Mooney may have been thefirst to call attention to the significance of the La Salle letters and topropose an identification of these groups. He must immediately have recognizedGatacka as the long-established name of the people also known, in recent times,as the Kiowa Apache. Reasoning from this positive identification and bearing inmind the long association of the Gatacka with the Kiowa, he went on to suggestthat \"Manrhout . . . may possibly be some obsolete name for the Kiowathemselves\" (1979 [1898]: 248). Mooney made this inference, in part, on thebasis of nomenclature but also with an eye to geographical location and to thecultural implications of the La Salle textparticularly the references to thehorse culture.For present purposes, Mooney's reasoning may be provisionally accepted, leadingto the following propositions: (1) The Gatacka, or Kiowa Apache, can"},{"pageContent":"Page 79be securely identified as an Athabascan-speaking group. If (2) the Manrhout areposited as ancestral Kiowa, they were, perforce, Tanoan-speaking. Since (3) theJumano were Tanoan-speaking, the Manrhout are best identified with the Jumano.Thus, the La Salle letters provide support for the premise that (4) the Jumanoof the eastern frontier, at the end of the seventeenth century, were a likelyfounder population for the Kiowa nation and indicate that their alliance withthe Gatacka, or Kiowa Apache, was already established at this early date.The Liminal Phase: 1700 to 1800Between these references and a continuous historical record of the Kiowa,beginning around 1800, there is a century of mystery. The liminal phase wouldhave begun with the destruction of Jumano integrity, in several stages:displacement from their more northern territories and from trade with New Mexicoby 1670; loss of hunting grounds between the Pecos and the Colorado a decadelater; displacement from the Colorado Valley and termination of the trade at LaJunta, perhaps a decade after that. The last straw may have been the outbreak ofhostilities between the Caddo and Spain, beginning in 1693. This temporarilybrought an end to Spanish involvement in Texas and coincided with Apacheexpansion eastward. It signaled the end of Spanish sponsorship of Jumano tradingexpeditions and may have forced various Jumano bands to choose betweensubmitting to their longtime enemies, the Apache, in the west or joining forceswith their longtime allies, the Caddoan tribes, in the east.Juan Sabeata, the Jumano chief and governor, was disappointed at the failure ofhis efforts to win Spanish support against the Apache. In a petition for helpwhich he addressed to New Mexican officials at El Paso in 1682, Sabeata hadraised the possibility of a French presence in Texasa constant bugaboo in NewSpainand hinted that trade contacts may already have taken place in thatquarter. Spanish fears of French encroachment were realized a few years later,when La Salle planted his colony on the Texas coast. During an encounter in aHasinai village, the Jumano solicited trade with members of the French colony,and a Jumano leaderprobably Sabeata himselfeven approached La Salle with aproposal for a joint attack on Spanish settlements on the Rio Grande. La Salle'scolony was short-lived, however, and the Jumano overtures came to naught.However, they clearly give notice of conflict and instability in economicrelations and reveal a Jumano leadership which was weighing both internationaland regional geopolitics in a desperate search for alliances.As the Apache advanced eastward to occupy the valleys of the Colorado"},{"pageContent":"Page 80and Brazos, there were repercussions along the Rio Grande. As early as 1685,Posada reported that refugees from central Texas, Jumano included, were seekingshelter in the Spanish missions below El Paso. Posada went on to suggest, aspart of an ambitious proposal for the development of a port at the Bay ofEspíritu Santo (Matagorda Bay), that the Jumano be resettled on the Colorado, tohelp protect the port against Apache encroachment. They would, he suggested,defend this territory because \"it is their land which the Apacha nation tookaway from them and whom they hold as enemies. Their desire forvengeance . . . will impel them to remain faithful\" (A. B. Thomas 1982: 6567).Thus, on the west, there was some movement of the Jumano from the Plains towardthe Rio Grande, where the missions provided temporary security. Some yearslater, when the Apache invaded the Rio Grande Valley south of New Mexico, mostof these missions were abandoned. Eventually the surviving Jumano, like otherremnant groups, were at least partly absorbed into the Apache population.References cited by Bolton indicate the presence of bands of \"Apaches Jumanes\"in western Texas and northern Mexico. Bolton saw in this the solution to themystery of the disappearance of the Jumano from the historical recordthey hadmerged with their former enemies (1911: 84).But was this the whole story? Was withdrawal westward the only recourse open tothe Jumano of the eastern frontier? What of their herds and the trade in horses?Might not a part of this population have removed eastward rather than westward,seeking new pastures and hunting territory ahead of the advancing Apache andcloser to their Caddoan allies? These allies were, at the time, already lookingto France as a potential market for their furs and a new source of trade goods.The east-west routes had fallen, but the opportunity was at hand for areoriented trade network in which the erstwhile Jumano could find a new role anda new identity.I hope eventually to present a more complete scenario of the transition fromJumano to Kiowa but can now only posit a possible course of events and suggestsome considerations which may be of significance when a complete chronology canbe written.Changing Jumano NomenclatureAs already noted, \"Jumano\" appears to be a Hispanization based on a number ofcognate native appellations. Used as a generic term, subsuming much geographicaland cultural variation, it thus represents, from the beginning, an extension ofaboriginal usage. In this generic sense, the Jumano consisted of a looselyorganized network of territorial divisions or bands. A number of"},{"pageContent":"Page 81names of these divisions are known (though not always clearly distinguishablefrom allied groups which were often found in the company of the itinerantJumano). For example, in 1582, one chronicler, Espejo, referred to a string ofcommunities along the Rio Grande between La Junta and El Paso as ''Jumanos\"(Bolton 1908: 168192); another member of the same expedition, Luxan,distinguished, from south to north, the \"Otomoacas,\" \"Caguates,\" and\"Tanpachoas\" (Hammond and Rey 1953: 153212).A century later, the native captains who accompanied Juan Sabeata on the roadeast from La Junta represented the \"Cibolos,\" \"Caguas,\" and \"Cholomes\" (Hackett1934: 137). The Cibolo (the \"Cow Nation\" earlier encountered by Cabeza de Vaca)were the predominant Jumano group in the hinterlands east of La Junta and were(as the name suggests) primarily buffalo hunters. The Cholome were part of thefarm belt at the confluence of the Rio Grande and Rio Conchos. Scatteredreferences to the name Cagua (cf. Caguate) or Caigua are found throughout thehistory of the Jumano trade. This diffuse group may have been more integrallyinvolved in the trade itself than were the others, and their namewhether itdenoted a band, a kinship grouping, or a status categorygives the most obvioushint of a connection to the later Kiowa. It appears that while the use of Jumanodeclined, Caigua endured; it recurs from time to time in the eighteenth centuryand reappears as the principal designation of a new tribal entity in thenineteenth.Only a tentative explanation can be offered for the name Manrhout, used by LaSalle, which does not obviously resemble any known tribal designation in theSouth Plains region. It could have originated in the Spanish word manso (or, inthe seventeenth century, manxo), meaning \"docile\" or \"tame,\" an adjective mostoften applied to domesticated animals but also commonly used in the Spanishcolonies to characterize friendly Indiansin contrast to those who wereunfriendly or \"wild.\"The Spanish term was apparently incorporated in a borderlands pidgin. As earlyas 1598 it is recorded in Oñate's account of an encounter near El Paso withIndians who surrendered with the words \"Manxos . . . Micos!\" [(We are)peaceful . . . Friends!] (Hammond and Rey 1953, 1: 315). It is, incidentally,retained as the name of the Manso tribe, historically located in that sameregion. The term could well have been applied, descriptively, to the Jumano,based on their reputation for trade and other friendly dealings with the Spanishcolonies. 4The Gatacka or \"Kiowa Apache\"As already indicated, the Gatacka alliance with the Kiowa is longstanding andmay even predate the liminal period. Their origin, like that of the Kiowa, pre-"},{"pageContent":"Page 82sents a mystery; in this case, the mystery hinges on whether the ancestralpopulation was eastern Apache (historically, enemies of both Jumano and Kiowa)or a segment of another, unidentified Athabascan population. The degree oflinguistic distance between Kiowa Apache and other Apache groupsall of which,according to Hoijer (1971), speak dialects of a single languagesuggests that theseparation of the Gatacka from these southwestern Athabascan is relativelyancient. 5I concur with Hyde (1959: 43) in favoring a link between the Gatacka and theEscanjaque, whose presence in the Plains is first noted at the time of Oñate'sexpedition to Quivira. In the 1650s, these people were evidently antagonists andtrade rivals of the Jumano on the Rio Nueces. However, an alliance between thetwo groups could have arisen out of their common involvement in the Caddo trade,as well as their shared experience of losing lands along the Colorado River tothe eastern Apache (ancestors of the Mescalero and/or Lipan) (A. B. Thomas 1982:57).In the nineteenth century, the Kiowa and Gatacka were frequently encounteredtogether, sometimes appearing under the generic name of \"Trading Indians.\" TheGatacka came to be called \"Kiowa Apache\" in recent times, probably because oftheir inclusion in the Kiowa camp circle during the summer tribal assembly; thisindicated a formal political union, as well as an economic alliance.The Caddoan Tribes and ConfederaciesThe earliest Spanish references to the Jumano east of New Mexico give evidenceof their friendship with Quivira (presumed to be the ancestral Wichita people).To the southeast, the Jumano were closely allied with the Tejas (Caddo orHasinai) of eastern Texas. These alliances were deafly reflected in Spanishpolicy, which, throughout the seventeenth century, repeatedly sought to use theJumano as intermediaries in maintaining economic ties and friendly (if distant)relations with the Caddoan confederacies. The Caddoan were, in turn, seen aspotential buffers against encroachments from the east by France or otherEuropean powers.After the turn of the century, the Caddoan groups evidently continued theirfriendship with the erstwhile Jumano and may have actively sponsored thereorientation of their trade along a north-south axis. The northern terminus ofthe new network could have been another Caddoan groupperhaps for a time thePawnee but eventually the Arikara, whose villages on the Missouri were a majorfocus of trade up to the 1790s. At that time, according to Hyde, there was a\"league of tribes\" in the northern Plains which united the Arikara, Kiowa, andGatacka (1959: 185). Throughout the nineteenth century, neither Kiowa nor KiowaApache were ever in a prolonged state of war with the south-"},{"pageContent":"Page 83ern Caddoan; their cordial relationship with the Wichita, in particular, isreflected in the continuing cooperation of these tribes in the treaty period.The Trade in HorsesThe Manrhout location apparently lay along the Upper Colorado River of Texas, azone of natural pasturage which, years later, was famous for its abundance ofwild horses. This is the region in which Spanish sources document the presenceof large Jumano herds. It is likely, however, that other Jumano bands, also withhorse herds, were spread over a larger area, perhaps as far north as the UpperBrazos.Until shortly after 1700about the time the Apache became established on theColorado and Brazosthe Wichita villages on the Arkansas lay at the northernlimit of the trade in horses. By midcentury, horses were found throughout thePlains, at least as far north as the Crow and Blackfoot (Haines 1938: 434). Inthe interval, the ancestral Kiowa and Gatacka must have shifted location andextended their movements toward the north. This shifting may, in part, have beenmotivated by the expansion in the South Plains of a new and highly aggressivepeople, the Comanche, who challenged and eventually gained precedence over theApache.North of the Comanche-Apache frontier, Kiowa bands then spread through thecountry between the Arkansas and the Platte, a region ideally suited for theirpastoral way of life. They pastured their herds north and west of the villagesof their Wichita allies, who were relocating toward the south and east forbetter contact with French trading posts in Louisiana. The Kiowa were now inposition to become middlemen between the French-Wichita trade and the northernPlains tribes. They became known as a hunting and trading people, moving betweenthe Arkansas and the villages of the Arikara and Mandan. The pattern of theirmovements must have resembled that of the old Jumano, who gravitated betweentheir camps in the Plains and the villages of their eastern and western tradingpartners. It might be noted that the proposed connection to the Jumano implies along history for the Kiowa horse complex, dating to the 1570s, if not earlier. 6Reintegration: The Kiowa NationWhen modern Kiowa recount their own past, they usually begin with an account oftheir ancestors' emergence out of an underworld onto the earth's surface. Theevents are set in a cold land in the far north. The place of emergence isthought to be in the Yellowstone River Valley, close to the camps of the Crow.The Kiowa have many place-names for mountains and other geographical features ofthis region, and they recall a trail of southward migration that led them totheir historic territory between the Arkansas and Platte Rivers."},{"pageContent":"Page 84It has often been pointed out that the tradition of the Kiowa northern homelandis at odds with the evidence of language, which provides an obvious link to theTanoan Pueblos in the Southwest; Kiowa origins therefore pose a problem (Davis1979). The Kiowa emergence myth itself appears to be a variant of a well-knownsouthwestern type, exemplified in Zuni and Hopi accounts of the ascension ofclan ancestors through a series of underworlds to the earth's surface. Newcombe,considering a somewhat broader spectrum of \"their varied and complex social andceremonial life . . . their societies, traditions, and their artistic sense,\"also posits a southwestern cultural origin for the Kiowa (1969: 220221). R.Lowie (1953) and Erminie W. Vogelin (1933), though not arguing for asouthwestern affiliation, specifically discounted Kiowa traditions of northernorigin and alliance with the Crow tribe on the basis of comparisons of culturetraits and folklore motifs.Despite the hard evidence of such etic comparisons, however, the Kiowa mythrings true in emic terms. 7 Like other sacred stories of creation and culturalorigin, it celebrates a real beginning, the coming into being of a new ethnicentity. However, it must be admitted that such entities do not really springinto existence fully formed, out of nothingness. In this case, the mythicnorthern emergence may be read as a metaphoric expression of the actualemergence of the Kiowa people into a new level of political reality; it markstheir birth as a tribal nation.8The Kiowa nation, like the Cheyenne, was undoubtedly diverse in its sources,incorporating both Kiowa-speaking bands and other elements drawn fromincorporated and allied groups. Besides having maintained a long politicalalliance, the Gatacka and Kiowa undoubtedly intermarried over many generations.Kiowa families also trace descent from Crow, Arapaho, and Sarsi ancestors, aswell as the many Mexican, Texan, and other \"captives\" who were part of thetribe.A suggestion of the composite nature of the Kiowa nation in its earlier days maybe found in the plan of the 1867 Sun Dance circle, as recorded by Mooney in1896. One place in the circle belonged to the Khato, or Biters, a name whichrefers to the Arikara. Another place was reserved for the Ga'igwu, or Kiowaproper. Three places were assigned to the Kobui, or Elk; the Kinep, or BigShields; and the Kontallyui, or Black Boys. The sixth place, of course, was thatof the Semat, the Gatacka or Kiowa Apache. There is also a tradition of anextinct seventh band, the Kuatda, or Pullers, who spoke a \"peculiar dialect ofKiowa\" (Mooney 1979 [1898]: 228230). Reportedly, in earlier days, these bandshad their own chiefs, as well as distinctive ritual paraphernalia, religioussocieties, and so on (Boyd 1981: 4042; Nye 1962: 30). It is not unreasonable,then, to suppose that these segments of the Sun Dance circle can be traced tooriginally disparate groupsKiowa-speaking and non-Kiowawhich made"},{"pageContent":"Page 850085-01.GIF [52e9bd67af0cd4c980a6927a4e3e1559.gif]Figure 2.The South and North Plains, ca. 1830, showing the location of the Kiowaand major trade routes with other peoples.up the Kiowa nation. In addition, an ancient separation of northern and southerntribal divisions, or moleties, may be recalled in the designations ofT'okinahyup, or Northerners (literally \"Cold People\") and Guahalego, Southerners(named for the Kwahadi, or Comanche, with whom they were affiliated) (Mooney1979 [1898]: 227).The CrowIt is clear that a close relationship with the Crow constituted an importantinfluence on the Kiowa in their formative period. The Kiowa recall especiallyfriendly relations with the Crow people, as well as with the Arikara, Mandan,and Hidatsa. A special tradition of Crow fosterage of Kiowa children was re-"},{"pageContent":"Page 86ported by Mooney: the children were, reportedly, left with the Crow for longperiods of time in order to maintain a knowledge of the Crow languagea practiceundoubtedly related to the Kiowa role in trade (Mooney 1979 [1898]: 156). Anumber of prominent Kiowa, including Chief Kicking Bird, have claimed Crowancestry (Boyd 1981: 12).More to the point, perhaps, is the tradition that the Sun Dance was acquired,directly or indirectly, from the Crow. More basic, and perhaps more significantthan adoption of the Sun Dance itself, however, was the acquisition of a newstyle of tribal organization. This innovation, which greatly facilitatedcooperation in hunting and warfare, amounted to the formal linkage of disparatebands and families into a single integrated political bodya tribal nation. Theannual gathering of bands amounted to an affirmation of national unity,dramatized in the performance of the Sun Dance. This innovation was undoubtedlya response to the pressures engendered by colonialism and, especially, by thewestward expansion of the United States in the post-Civil War period. The newform of political organization became established in the northern Plains beforespreading, in a more diffuse form, to adjacent regions. My own cursorycomparison of features of social and political organization shows the largestnumber of similarities between the Kiowa and tribes of the North Plains andPlateau areas. This area of congruence stands out in contrast to other culturaland linguistic traits which betray the older and more deep-rooted connection tothe South Plains and Southwest. 9When the Lewis and Clark expedition ascended the Missouri River in the summer of1805, they reported that the \"Kiawa,\" in seventy tents, were located on theheadwaters of the Platte, very near to the Yellowstone Valley, the territoriesof the Crow, and the traditional place of Kiowa emergence (Coues 1965 [1893], 1:5860). The seventy householdslikely the northern moiety but not the entire Kiowapopulationcould have been assembled to participate in a Sun Dance, perhaps underthe sponsorship of the Crow. The tradition that the taime idol, a stone effigyfigure that is central to Kiowa Sun Dance symbolism, was a gift from the Crow(or, alternatively, from an Arapaho who received it from the Crow) suggests thatthere was a formal, ritualized transfer of the ceremony, along with its sacredartifacts.In their early years of trading in the north, the Kiowa could have been witnessto a wave of spectacular ceremonial events, as the Sun Dance complex spreadthrough the tribes of the region. They became friends and trading partners ofthe Crow, lived among them for periods of time, and eventually intermarried.When the Crow assembled for their summer ceremonials, the visitors may have beengiven a place in their camp circle (as the Gatacka would be part of the Kiowacircle). Eventually, the Kiowa also adopted these ceremonies and adapted them totheir own needs. This process was completed"},{"pageContent":"Page 87when the Kiowa Cold People, after sojourning in the north, eventually reunitedwith their southern congeners. They brought with them a vision of a new type oftribal unity, promoted by an annual gathering of bands and heightened by thedrama of a great ceremonial. Thus, sometime around 1800, the Kiowa assimilated apolitical and religious complex which was already current among their northernneighbors and allies.U.S. Traders and Trading CompaniesThroughout the eighteenth century, there is no indication of French or Spanishrecognition of the Kiowa, a tribe which is first acknowledged as a politicalentity in the Louisiana Territory under U.S. rule. On the other hand, there canbe little doubt that trade relations, direct or indirect, were maintainedthroughout this period. The history of relations between Plains tribes andFrancophone traders, from La Salle's exploration of the Mississippi to theLouisiana Purchase, is obscure and may never be fully documented. U.S. tradingcompanies, based in New Orleans and St. Louis, undoubtedly built on the contactsbegun under French and Spanish rule. As already noted, Jumano-French relationswere established in the 1680s; it is likely that such relations (at timesdirect, at times through the Caddoan) continued to influence the movements ofthe Jumano and their eighteenth-century descendants.Around 1800, the earliest U.S. references to the Kiowa already indicate aninclination to establish and maintain close relations with trading companyrepresentatives. Meriwether Lewis himself remarked on their penchant for barterand suggested that the Kiowa \"might be readily induced to visit the tradingestablishments on the Missouri\" (Coues 1965 [1893], 1: 58). In the same period,around the turn of the nineteenth century, an American trader, James Purseley(or Purcell), was evidently closely associated with the Kiowa, since he was withmembers of the tribe on the Upper Platte River in 1803 and also is known to haveaccompanied a delegation of Kiowa to New Mexico two years later (Weber 1971: 37;Mooney 1979 [1898]: 171).After Lewis and Clark, U.S. traders rapidly expanded operations in the newterritories. The movements of the Kiowa were likely orchestrated to meet theneeds of certain St. Louis-based traders who established posts on the ArkansasRiver and its tributaries. The tribe had a working relationship with theChouteau family and its operatives beginning in the 1830s, if not earlier; thisrelationship continued through the treaty period. 10The ComancheFrom the perspective of recent Kiowa history, the most important allied tribe isundoubtedly the Comanche. The entry of this Uto-Aztecan people into the Plainswas roughly concurrent with the Jumano diaspora; it may even be hy-"},{"pageContent":"Page 88pothesized that pressures initiated by the Comanche precipitated the eastwardsurge of the Apache, which in turn drove the Jumano from their lands in centralTexas. Although there is no record of direct Jumano contact with the Comanche,they or their Great Basin congeners may be foundas \"Yutas\"among the nationswhich Juan Sabeata named as allies, based on their common opposition to theApache (Hackett 1931: 138139).As to subsequent relations between the Kiowa and Comanche, Kiowa traditionindicates an early period of hostilities. This warfare may initially have forcedthe Kiowa toward the north and then have temporarily blocked intercourse betweennorthern and southern Kiowa bands. Prior to 1800, however, the Kiowa and theKwahadi band of Comanche became allies; reportedly, the alliance was negotiatedby a Mexican rancher or trader (Mooney 1979 [1898]: 162; Boyd 1981: 16). Thealliance was lasting and served the Kiowa well, as it opened the way around 1805for trade access to New Mexico.More important, the Kiowa, with the Comanche as their allies, were now able toextend their territorial base south of the Arkansas and Canadian Rivers and torediscover the old Jumano routes for raiding and trading deep into Texas andMexico. In a very general sense, the Kiowaas the cultural heirs of the Jumanonowhad come full circle. They could reoccupy territory which their ancestors hadbeen forced to abandon two centuries earlier, and they regained a role in tradewith New Mexico and other provinces. They had preserved and maintained theirtraditional role as hunters, horse-pastoralists, and traders while escalatingthis role to a new level of complexity in the cultural flux of thenineteenth-century Great Plains.NotesMany of the insights and interpretations expressed in this paper have beendeveloped in previous papers and a recent book (Hickerson 1988, 1990, 1994).

For example, early Kiowa participation inthe peyote complex, as well as their historical role as intermediaries in thetrade in peyote, may become more understandable when it is realized that Jumanotrade extended into peyote-producing regions of Mexico in the seventeenthcentury.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 7.Etic refers to culture traits (material, social, folkloric, etc.) treatedanalytically, as discrete entities, for purposes of cross-cultural comparisonand generalization; emic implies that such traits have value and significanceonly in a specific cultural context.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 8. Ihave followed Moore (1987) in using the term tribal nation to indicate a degreeof political unification which goes beyond the more informal ties ofterritoriality, kinship, language, and sense of common identity which constitutethe usual definition of a tribe. Periodic gathering of bands and performance ofinclusive rituals, such as the Sun Dance, are associated with this type oforganization.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 9.From Murdock (1967), the following columns were tabulated: 7, 12, 14, 19, 20,22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 67, 72, 73, and 8084.

AlbersOver twenty years ago, William Sturtevant introduced the idea of ethnogenesis toAmerican anthropology in a pioneering study of the sociopolitical processes bywhich the Seminole became differentiated historically from the Creek (1971: 92).Although he defined ethnogenesis in this work simply as \"the establishment ofgroup distinctiveness,\" his study actually touched upon broad transformationalprocesses in ethnic group identification. These involve the long-term movementsby which the ethnic identities of human communities get changed, and as suchthey are historical and evolutionary in scope (Moore 1987). But no matter how itis specified, ethnogenesis is an important idea that needs to be recovered andincluded in any conceptual discourse on ethnic phenomena. It is also a conceptwhose myriad dimensions require further exploration and explication.Although ethnic phenomena have drawn a great deal of scholarly interest over thepast few decades, the concept of ethnogenesis has gotten buried and lost underthe more inclusive rubric \"ethnicity.\" In the literature on historic NorthAmerican Indian populations, for example, considerable attention has been paidto the scope and variety of ethnic identities and interethnic relations(Elmendorf 1971; Anastasio 1972; Albers 1974; Davis 1974; Trigger 1976; Sharrock1977; Ewers 1975; Weist 1977; Blu 1980; Wood 1980; Fromhold 1981; Ford 1983;Muga 1984, 1988; Albers and James 1986; Bishop 1987; Hanson 1986, 1987; Albersand Kay 1987; Tanner 1987; Miller 1989; Milloy 1988; White 1991; Quinn 1993;Miller and Boxberger 1994). However, only a few studies (Sturtevant 1971, 1983;Sharrock 1974; Wood and Downer 1977;"},{"pageContent":"Page 91Greenberg and Morrison 1981; Moore 1987; Albers 1993) actually address how localgroups changed their ethnic identities as a result of their relationships withothers or reveal how ethnogenesis involved a variety of different transformativeprocesses.Many of the better-known examples of ethnogenesis result from conflict andfission, but there are a number of interesting cases where transformations inethnic identities were based on cooperation and fusion. As a form ofethnogenesis, neither interethnic fusion, hybridizaton, or merger has been aswell described as other historical processes of ethnic change (Albers 1993:112122). The situation of the Plains Assiniboin, Cree, and Ojibwa, as originallyreported in the pioneering study of Susan Sharrock (1974), is one notableexception. Throughout much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, thesepopulations jointly occupied a large area of territory in the northeasternPlains, and in varying ways and degrees they intermarried and collaborated in arange of activities from combat and trade to subsistence and ceremony. Segmentsof these populations also lived together, eventually forming composite residencegroups in which new ethnic identifications developed over time.The historic situation of the Plains Assiniboin, Cree, and Ojibwa did notconform to typical tribal models where territories were divided, claimed, anddefended by discrete ethnic groups, nor did it fit descriptions in whichpolitical allegiances were defined primarily in exclusive ethnic terms.Ethnicity in the generic and highly abstract sense of a ''tribal\" name did notalways function as marker of geopolitical boundaries. Given a pluralisticpattern of land use and alliance making, most of their ethnic categories did nothave a high level of salience or any a priori power to organize and distributepeople across geographic space. What appears to have been more important indefining the geopolitics of access to land, labor, and resources were socialties based on ties of kinship and sodality in their varied metaphoric extensionsand expressions. Indeed, it was only after the imposition of U. S. and Canadiansovereignty that their ethnic names took on any real importance, and then it wasonly because these were invested with the legal power of treaties written bynation-states (Sharrock 1974; Albers and Kay 1987).In addition to serving as an important challenge to conventional representationsof American Indian ethnicity and geopolitics, their case also provides an aptillustration of the variable paths ethnogenesis takes. In particular, ithighlights instances of ethnogenesis where processes of merger rather thanseparation dominate ethnic change. Merger is one of a continuum ofaccommodations that groups of different ethnic origins make to each other'spresence, and, as described at length elsewhere (Albers 1993: 112122), it is atype of interdependence involving the mutual use and protection of a shared landbase. As an accommodation that ethnic groups make to each other's presence,"},{"pageContent":"Page 92merger assumes a variety of different structural configurations and associatedpatterns of ethnic identification, ranging from loosely knit alliances amongethnically distinct groups to tightly integrated coalitions where ethnicdifferences are dissolved.Building upon the seminal contributions of Sharrock's study (1974), this essaydescribes how interethnic merger entailed a variety of transforming patternswithin the ranks of Plains Assiniboin, Cree, and Ojibwa. Not only does itdiscuss the regionally varied and historically changing characteristics of thesepatterns on the northeastern Plains, but it also defines some of the conditionsthat fostered a widespread process of ethnic hybridization and that contributedto the emergence of new cultural groups and ethnic identifications during theeighteenth and nineteenth centuries.Merger and Its Structural VariationsIn many earlier ethnographic writings on the historic Plains, tribes wereidentified as either friends or enemies, and the relations between them weredescribed as either peaceful or hostile. This kind of division, as KatherineWeist (1977: 43) astutely noted, obscures the complexity of relations amongpopulations of different ethnic origin. On the friendly, peaceful side of thedivide, Plains Indian populations were linked to each other in various ways. Onthe one hand, they were connected through different kinds of symbiosis, whererelationships were formed out of functionally differentiated positions inproduction and/or distribution. In these relations, peoples of diverse ethnicorigins formed alliances against common enemies, collaborated in trade andceremony, and even intermarried. Notwithstanding their interdependence andcoparticipation in a variety of activities, groups maintained their ethnicintegrity and separateness through various structural mechanisms (Albers 1993:100111). On the other hand, Plains Indian populations were tied to each otherthrough relationships of merger where ethnically distinct groups stood on moreor less common grounds in relation to the means of production. Under merger,groups not only intermarried and jointly collaborated in subsistence, ceremony,and military activity, but they freely traveled and resided within each other'snominally designated areas of occupation. In the process, ethnic differenceswere often minimized (Albers 1993: 112121).In contrast to the past, when it was customary to view the Plains as little morethan an epiphenomenal extension of its autonomous tribal pieces, more recentperspectives (Albers 1974, 1993; Sharrock 1974; Ewers 1975; Weist 1977; Wood1980; Hanson 1987; Moore 1987) see the area as consisting of a series ofregional formations that were greater than the sum of their ethnic parts. Inthese arrangements, local ethnic groups were connected to each other throughcomplex ties of symbiosis and merger. When Plains Indian popula-"},{"pageContent":"Page 93tions stood on common grounds and held shared interests in a setting of merger,their relationships produced a variety of structural patterns which can berepresented heuristically by a four-stage continuum which marks a series ofdifferent structural positions along the road to ethnogenesis.One end of this continuum is represented by a polyethnic alliance formation, inwhich different ethnic groups share territory, engage in joint military action,and collaborate in a variety of ceremonial and subsistence activities. Alliancesof this order are highly varied in terms of both the character and degree ofinterlinkage between constituent groups, but for the most part, local groupsretain some level of residential and ethnic distinctiveness (Sharrock 1974;Ewers 1975; Hanson 1987; Albers 1993: 113114). This contrasts with otherpatterns of merger, where separateness breaks down at a residential level andwhere, as a result, the ethnic markers identifying local groups change.At the other end is the emergent ethnic community, where the process ofethnogenesis has reached completion. Here groups that were once distinct are nowjoined. Indeed, they become so intermingled that they are virtuallyindistinguishable from each other in a cultural and social sense. In theprocess, they not only form a political entity that is separate from theirparent populations, but they also assume an ethnic identification that isdistinctive as well. It is an identity that emphasizes unity and solidarity overany differences from their ethnic pasts.Toward the middle of the continuum are two different, but often overlapping,merger patterns. One, the ethnic bloc confederation, is associated withsituations where politically dominant ethnic blocs retain their integrity andsimply absorb \"foreign\" ethnicities into their ranks. This kind of patternsometimes evolves when a small population becomes incorporated into the bodypolitic of a larger group and, in the process, does not give up the identity ofits separate origin (e.g., Kiowa-Apache in the ranks of the Kiowa, or Sarcee inthe Blackfoot confederation) (Jenness 1932; Bittle 1971; Albers 1993:113115). Inanother form, members of equally large, powerful, and contiguous ethnic blocsintermarry, Share territory, and collaborate in warfare and other activities,and in the process some of their residence groups, especially those situated inborder zones, develop bicultural heritages. The groups with dual backgrounds,however, remain affiliated politically and ethnically with one or the otherparent bloc (i.e., bands of Lakota ancestry in the Cheyenne tribal circle)(Moore 1987). In this kind of pattern, merger begins to penetrate the core oflocal settlements; however, intermarriage and coresidency are not widespreadenough to alter political arrangements at the level of either parent bloc.The other pattern at the middle of the merger continuum is the hybridized groupcoalition. Here intermarriage and coresidency become so pervasive and"},{"pageContent":"Page 94widespread that local settlements with dual ethnic origins begin to constitute asociopolitical body whose interests and actions stand apart from those of eitherparent bloc. In the process, they take on hybrid ethnic identities as well(Sharrock 1974: 111113). At this point, ethnogenesis is not yet completedbecause the hybrid populations still retain some sort of umbilical connection(i.e., in language preference, economic dependence) to either or both parentalblocs.In historic times, the merger patterns of the Plains Assiniboin, Cree, andOjibwa were historically changing and regionally varied. In one way or another,their patterns of merger represented the full breadth of the four-stagecontinuum just described. How these were manifested in different locations andat changing points in time is a central concern of the following discussion.Early Movements and Historic AntecedentsContrary to earlier interpretations (Secoy 1953; Ewers 1974; Sharrock andSharrock 1974; Mandelbaum 1979), the Assiniboin and Cree moved to the prairiesand High Plains of North America from a variety of forest and parkland locationswhich spanned a vast area between the Red River on the east and the North Branchof the Saskatchewan River on the west (Wright 1965: 189227, 1981; Hlady 1970:278279; Ray 1974: 4; Syms 1977; Smith 1981; Russell 1991). From the seventeenthcentury onward, their migrations and adaptations happened gradually whenfrontier populations from the parklands of Manitoba and Saskatchewan became moredependent on a grassland subsistence cycle and remained in prairie locations forextended periods. Eventually, many of the immigrants moved deeper into theprairies and onto the High Plains, where they were joined by additional waves ofAssiniboin, Cree, and later Ojibwa from parkland and forest habitats (Ray 1974;Milloy 1988; Russell 1991; Peers 1994).By the mid-eighteenth century, Cree and Assiniboin populations coexisted over awidespread and ecologically varied territory. The most southerly locatedAssiniboin, and some of the Cree as well, were adopting horses and beginning tooccupy prairie lands on a permanent basis. The transition of some Cree andAssiniboin to a grassland subsistence pattern was accompanied by the emergenceof distinct ethnic markers. Not only did the Native populations makedistinctions among themselves along ecological lines, but fur traders in theregion increasingly identified and separated groups according to the kind ofenvironments in which they lived (Sharrock 1977: 721). The name \"Strong Wood\"was applied to Cree and Assiniboin involved in a parkland-forest subsistencecycle with a seasonal use of the prairies. These populations traveled primarilyby canoe, worked as trappers for the fur trade, and became the groups mostdependent on the trade for their means of production (Ray 1974:"},{"pageContent":"Page 95144). The other label, \"Meadow,\" was used for Cree and Assiniboin who wereadapted to a grassland cycle. These people were equestrian, buffalo hunters andtraders, who neither liked nor were especially good at trapping (Sharrock1977:11; Ray 1974: 147). Their dependence on the fur trade was marginal andconfined primarily to the acquisition of guns and ammunition and other sundryitems for which these groups increasingly exchanged meat provisions (Ray 1974:147). By the late eighteenth century, even though the Assiniboin had come to beassociated with the grasslands more often than the Cree (and vice versa),representatives of both were intermingled across forest, parkland, and grasslandenvironments in varying ways and degrees.Wherever these two populations located themselves, they appear to have livedwith each other largely in peace. After establishing trade with the British atHudson Bay in the seventeenth century, several groups of Cree and someAssiniboin developed into middlemen who traveled the river systems over longdistances to exchange peltries for guns and other European goods (Ray 1974:5171; Thistle 1986: 332; Milloy 1988: 520; Russell 1991: 8791, 187199). In thewestern reaches of Cree and Assiniboin occupation, these bands established tradealliances with their ethnic congeners and with the neighboringPiegan-Blood-Blackfoot-Sarcee who lived on the prairie's edge between the Northand South Branches of the Saskatchewan River. Every year, Cree and Assinibointraders would meet these neighbors in a trade fair located at the junction ofthe North and South Branches. After more than a century of trading in which theAssiniboin (but especially the Cree) were sole suppliers of guns and otherEuropean goods to the Blackfoot-Piegan-Blood-Sarcee, these various ethnic groupsbecame linked to each other not only through ties of trade but marriage as well(Milloy 1988: 16).To the east, a similar trade complex was developing between Assiniboin and Creeand the Mandan-Hidatsa of the Upper Missouri River. Those trading directly withthe Missouri villagers were a prairie/park/and people who received Europeancommodities from ethnic congeners following a woodland/ park/and subsistencecycle (Ewers 1968: 1433; Ray 1974: 5557, 8789; Milloy 1972: 4748; Wood 1980:98109; Albers 1993: 100112). In a pattern paralleling developments farther west,the eastern Assiniboin and Cree became the primary suppliers of European goodsto the Missouri villagers in return for hides, corn, and, later, horses. Butunlike the more westerly trade chains, the Missouri River complex was much moreunstable politically. This was probably because the Missouri villagers hadaccess to competing lines of trade, including ones that bypassed theCree/Assiniboin's British trade chains and linked them with the Ojibwa/Dakota'sFrench connections. Indeed, until the early eighteenth century, there isindirect evidence (Burpee 1927: 109; Bowers 1965: 217218, 476, 482; Wood 1971:2, 58; Ray 1974: 56, 1219;"},{"pageContent":"Page 96Syms 1977: 112113, 1979) that the trade competition and hostility betweenCree/Assiniboin and the Ojibwa/Dakota spilled out into the Plains and in alllikelihood contributed to Hidatsa, Crow, and Cheyenne villagers abandoning theirsettlements in eastern North Dakota and taking up residence on the Missouri.After the Ojibwa broke off their trade with the Dakota in the 1730s and becameallied with the Assiniboin and Cree, most of the Mandan-Hidatsa's access toEuropean goods was restricted to one or more of their Ojibwa-Cree-Assinibointrade connections (Hickerson 1970: 6566, 8186, 1974: 5859; Ray 1974: 412).As an extension of their partnership in long-distance trading, the Cree andAssiniboin were military allies across the entire expanse of their jointterritorial range. In the west they were united in an unremitting war with theAtsina-Arapaho, and they also joined together with Blackfoot-Blood-Piegan tofight the Shoshone-Flathead-Kootenai (Milloy 1988: 1216; Russell 1991: 187189).Farther east they were engaged in warfare with the Atsina as well, but they werealso enemies of the Lakota and Crow. In addition, there was intermittenthostility with Hidatsa and sometimes even Mandan (Milloy 1988: 4146). Finally,in their most easterly locations they remained allied in a war against theOjibwa-Dakota until the 1730s, when the latter's trade connectionsdisintegrated. Thereafter, the Ojibwa entered the alliance camp of the Cree andAssiniboin, and they shared the same enemies over much of the region that allthree groups commonly traveled and occupied (Hickerson 1956, 1970; Vogelin andHickerson 1974: 17159).From the late seventeenth until the middle of the eighteenth century, detailsabout the character of relationships between these populations are very sketchy.From what is known, however, a couple of general points can be made. First ofall, it is apparent that throughout much of their area of occupation the Creeand Assiniboin were shifting from relationships resting on symbiosis and afunctional differentiation in trade to ones based largely on merger (Sharrock1974: 103106). Throughout their co-occupied and ecologically varied territories,many followed similar subsistence strategies and held the same position inregional trade chains (Ray 1974: 27115). But whether ties between particulargroups of Cree and Assiniboin were based on symbiosis or merger, it is clearthat over the entire reach of their shared territories they constituted apolyethnic alliance formation (Albers 1993: 112122). At this time in history,however, there is little evidence of merger much beyond the level of looselyamalgamated trade and military alliances within territories that were jointlytraveled and occupied. Local settlements, even when interspersed, were stillbeing separated and identified as either Assiniboin or Cree. Althoughintermarriage was reported and probably widespread, it was not of sufficientmagnitude to break down preexisting ethnic markers."},{"pageContent":"Page 97It was into this polyethnic alliance formation that the Ojibwa entered in themid-eighteenth century, adding to the already complex patterns of merger in theregion at large.Evolving Patterns of Merger: 1780 to 1830The years between 1780 and 1820 mark a time when increasing numbers ofAssiniboin and Cree along with a small but growing population of Ojibwa movedonto the prairies and became fully adapted to a Plains way of life (Ray 1974:94103; Sharrock 1977:11; Milloy 1988: 2137; Peers 1994: 2797). In the lateeighteenth century, much of their movement was precipitated by changing economicconditions. As described in much greater detail elsewhere (Ray 1974: 125182;Thistle 1986: 5180; Peers 1994: 6384, 99112), these entailed a declininginvolvement in the fur trade and an increased participation in the meatprovision, robe, and hide traffics. In order to maintain economic viability inthe region's changing markets, many of the groups located in parklandenvironments moved onto the prairies, where they adopted the use of horses andengaged in a competitive production of food provisions and hides for Europeanmarkets (see figure 1).While this shift was taking place, Euramerican traders were also changing theirlocations and opening up posts within reach of the prairies. In doing this, theyundercut some of the important and powerful middlemen positions that Assiniboin,Cree, and Ojibwa occupied in the peltry and gun trade (Ray 1974: 130133; Jackson1982:1119; Milloy 1988: 5264). With this change, many of those who wereprimarily trappers and/or traders were pushed or drawn into the production offood provisions to sustain their position in the marketplace (Ray 1974: 137148,157160; Peers 1987: 111138). But even though changes in the fur market and inthe locations of traders may have motivated many groups to focus more of theirproductive activity around a grasslands environment, their ability to make theprairies a primary homeland and resource base rested on other factors as well,including the acquisition of horses through either trading or raiding (Peers1987: 7779, 110114; Milloy 1988: 4764).The ability of the Assiniboin, Cree, and Ojibwa to enter the prairies and remainthere on a sustained basis also had important demographic aspects. One of themost significant of these was the impact of the 17801782 smallpox outbreak(Taylor 1977; Trimble 1986). In its aftermath, many of the parkland/woodlandAssiniboin, Cree, and Ojibwa gained a foothold in depopulated prairie zoneswhose earlier occupants were unable to retain their territories. Entry into someof these zones was gained through force and warfare. In others, however, entrytook place peaceably through marriage and coresidency (Morton 1929: 6364; Ray1974: 105106; Taylor 1977; Green-"},{"pageContent":"Page 980098-01.GIF [f21b831de7b3fab10c4d6ba6fc1310e0.gif]Figure 1.Overlapping territorial ranges, 1800.berg and Morrison 1981; Thistle 1986: 6365; Milloy 1972: 5758, 1988: 1213; Peers1994: 2021; Schilz 1988).Since the territorial expanse of prairie-adapted Assiniboin, Cree, and Ojibwawas vast, extending in a northwesterly direction from the Red River to the NorthBranch of the Saskatchewan, these economic and demographic transitions haddifferent consequences for them depending on their particular geographiclocations and their social positions within regionally organized systems oftrade and alliance (Milloy 1972, 1988). This, in turn, affected how"},{"pageContent":"Page 99various patterns of merger evolved across the territorial landscapes theyoccupied between 1780 and 1825.Eastern Locations. In the most easterly reaches of their prairie range south ofthe Assiniboine River, between the Pembina and Souris Rivers, the settlements ofAssiniboin and Cree were interspersed. As revealed in the accounts of AlexanderHenry (Coues 1897, 1: 119, 152, 166, 191, 196, 198, 204, 228, 243244, 413, 419)and John Tanner (James 1956: 37, 71, 77, 137, 142), among other early sources(Harmon 1911: 78, 81, 85, 88; Hickerson 1956: 278; Ray 1974: 96100; Sharrock1974: 109110; Sharrock and Sharrock 1974: 3538, 4647), these two populationscovered the same territory, intermarried, occupied joint camping places,utilized identical vision questing sites, and collaborated in winter bisonhunts. Moreover, they traveled together on trading expeditions to the Mandanvillages on the Missouri as well as to European trading posts on the Assiniboineand Red Rivers (Coues 1897, 1:119, 140, 185, 190191, 203, 228, 429; Hickerson1956: 280282, 285; James 1956: 5051, 277; Ray 1974: 157160; Sharrock 1974:109110; Milloy 1988: 5058). They also joined together on war expeditions againstthe Dakota, Atsina, and intermittently the Mandan/Hidatsa (Coues 1897, 1: 135,159, 165; Hickerson 1956: 280, 287; James 1956: 5758, 6364, 8687, 9698, 137143,203207; Milloy 1972: 107127, 1988: 5758). Here ethnic merger continued to takeon the appearance of a polyethnic alliance formation in which local bands heldseparate ethnic identities but cooperated in advancing their common interestsover land and trade routes.In the years between 1790 and 1810, the Ojibwa were just beginning to make theirpresence felt in this region (Coues 1897, 1:53, 57; Hickerson 1956: 274293;Peers 1987: 2761). When they arrived on the prairies west of the Red River, theydid so gradually and usually in small family groups (Ray 1974: 99102; Thistle1986: 7071; Peers 1987: 4760). They lived peaceably among resident Assiniboinand Cree, sometimes intermarrying, camping with them, sharing in subsistence andritual, and fighting against common enemies (Coues 1897, 1: 191, 196, 257, 269,429; James 1956: 5758, 6364, 70, 78, 8687, 9698, 132, 157, 142; Peers 1987: 53,7184). Laura Peers (1987: 7173) argues that the Ojibwa were able to penetratethe prairie regions dominated by Assiniboin and Cree because they posed noeconomic threat to either. There was no competition, because these groups werefunctionally differentiated. The Ojibwa were primarily trappers of small game,whereas the Assiniboin and Cree were mostly big game hunters (James 1956: 7375;Ray 1974: 125135, 168175). Where the Ojibwa intermingled with the Cree andAssiniboin, their relations appear to have been built on merger rather thansymbiosis. Despite the contrasts in their productive orientations, these differ-"},{"pageContent":"Page 100ences did not constitute a basis for any major organized system of trade betweenthem. At any rate, the division was short-lived, because within a decade or twoof their arrival on the prairies, many Ojibwa were no longer trappers butequestrian buffalo hunters whose way of life was inseparable from that of theAssiniboin and Cree among whom they lived (Howard 1977: 1720).Until the 1820s, the Ojibwa were still a minority population on the prairies,and their presence was probably welcomed by the eastern Assiniboin and Cree as asource of recruits to fight the ever-present danger of enemy populations likethe Dakota, Hidatsa/Crow, and Atsina (Peers 1987: 71). This is especially likelyin light of the losses these Assiniboin and Cree suffered in the 17801782smallpox outbreak. Indeed, the magnitude of this epidemic was so great that insome regions of their occupation, especially those east of the Red River, theAssiniboin and Cree no longer retained an identifiable presence. What actuallyhappened to them is a source of debate, but it is likely that some of thesurvivors remained in their home territories, where they became incorporatedinto the ranks of the resident and inmigrating populations of Saulteaux andOjibwa (Tyrrell 1968: lxxvlxxvi; Vogelin and Hickerson 1974: 17159; Ray 1974:104108; Greenberg and Morrison 1981). Others, however, probably moved west,where they joined forces with a large vanguard population of Assiniboin andsmaller but closely associated groups of Cree, both of whom were consolidatingand expanding their prairie holdings from the Assiniboine to the Pembina andSouris Rivers (Coues 1897, 1:314, 408, 2: 516, 522523; Thwaites 19041905:221222; James 1956: 70, 132, 142; Masson 1960, 1: 272; Ray 1974: 96100; Sharrock1974: 109110; Sharrock and Sharrock 1974: 3538, 4647).After 1780, the ties connecting the southeastern Assiniboin and Cree wereclearly linked to a long history of coresidency, trade collaboration, andmilitary alliance making (Russell 1991). Now, however, their alliances appear tohave been more dense and tightly knit in response to the losses each sustainedfrom epidemic diseases (Sharrock 1974: 109110; Taylor 1977; Trimble 1986).Nevertheless, both still maintained ethnic integrity at least from thestandpoint of those outsiders who reported on their identities and whereabouts.Central Locations. In the years between 1780 and 1830 and throughout theprevious century, a combined and growing force of Cree and Assiniboin becameadapted to a Plains way of life on the prairies south and west of the TouchwoodHills. From the Qu'Appelle River to the South Branch of the Saskatchewan River,Assiniboin and Cree were populating the parklands and adjacent prairies not onlyfrom the northern forest areas of Manitoba and Saskatchewan but also from theparklands and prairies along the Assiniboine River in the east (Coues 1897, 2:5; Harmon 1911: 72; Morton 1929: 6364; Ray 1974: 9697, 99101). Here, aselsewhere, a picture of devastation and"},{"pageContent":"Page 101population decline followed in the footsteps of the 17801782 epidemic and, inall likelihood, contributed greatly to the realignment and increased merger ofthe area's populations (Ray 1974: 109111; Taylor 1977). It also probably openedup avenues for the combined forces of Cree and Assiniboin to expand into theless-populated and well-defended prairie regions of other ethnic groups,including the Atsina and Hidatsa (Morton 1929: 3435, 6364; Flannery 1953: 916;Milloy 1972: 102106, 1988: 33, 51; Ray 1974: 105106; Thistle 1986: 6365; Schilz1988: 4156; Russell 1991: 200209).By contrast, movements into prairie regions once occupied by depopulatedsegments of the Blackfoot-Blood-Piegan were much more peaceful and an extensionof this populations long-standing kinship, trade, and military alliances withthe westernmost Cree and Assiniboin (Milloy 1988: 520; Russell 1991: 187191).The ability of Cree and Assiniboin to travel and move peaceably beyond the SouthBranch of the Saskatchewan onto the lands of kin and friends among theBlackfoot-Blood-Piegan, however, came to an end in the early nineteenth century,when trade connections between these populations were undermined by theestablishment of European posts on the western reaches of the North Branch ofthe Saskatchewan River (Milloy 1988: 3140).After a history of close collaboration in trade and military affairs, the mergerrelationships of Assiniboin and Cree in the Qu'Appelle region had advanced astep further (Sharrock 1974: 108109). As described by the trader Daniel Harmon(1911: 4041), the two populations were so intermixed that it was impossible todistinguish them. Local residence groups were bilingual and bicultural, and theyheld dual ethnic affiliations as well (Harmon 1911: 4244). In addition, Cree andAssiniboin were reported in large, mixed encampments on the South Branch of theSaskatchewan River, and there were other multiethnic bands covering much of theprairie/parklands from there to the Qu'Appelle River as well (Coues 1897, 2:522523; Harmon 1911: 78, 81, 85, 103104, 120; Ray 1974: 9697, 99100; Sharrockand Sharrock 1974: 2333).In contrast to Assiniboin and Cree settlements elsewhere, which weredistinguished along ethnic lines, the bands in this region were described inhyphenated ethnic terms as ''Cree-Assiniboin\" (Coues 1897, 2: 597; Harmon 1911:78, 81, 85, 103194; Sharrock 1974: 111112). Here the process of merger wentbeyond the level of regional alliance making and even an intermittent pattern ofcoresidency among ethnically different kin and friends (Sharrock 1974: 108109).It now reached the very makeup and structure of local bands over a fairly largestretch of territory, and in doing so it started to take on the characteristicsof what Sharrock called a \"fused ethnicity form\" (1974: 111), or what isidentified here as a hybridized group coalition.While there is no question that bands in the Qu'Appelle and South Branch"},{"pageContent":"Page 102regions were becoming ethnically hybridized, it is hard to determine at thisdate whether they formed a distinct body politic that was separate from eitherof their respective parent groups and, if they did, how many of them were soinvolved. Depending on their locations and prevailing historical circumstances,many of the hybridized, Assiniboin-Cree or Cree-Assiniboin bands still appear tohave been connected to their larger parent populations, forming ethnicallydistinct enclaves within each bloc (Ray 1974: 96100). As a result, theirsituations probably corresponded more faithfully to that of an ethnic blocconfederation. Whatever the particular case, it is certain that there was a muchmore complex and completely integrated pattern of ethnic merger in this regionthan in the other areas of joint Cree and Assiniboin occupancy between 1780 and1820.Again, the merger patterns of this region were further complicated when theOjibwa entered the scene. As in regions along the Assiniboine and Red Rivers,they arrived in the Qu'Appelle River Valley vicinity in small trapping groups(Harmon 1911: 72). Before the 1820s they followed and mostly occupied the forestzones, which were becoming depopulated of Cree and Assiniboin, who were now moredependent on parkland/grassland subsistence cycles. But no matter where theOjibwa moved in this vast region, their early settlements and trappingterritories were largely intermixed with those of the Cree and Assiniboin (Ray1974: 101103).Western Locations. In their newly occupied lands between the South Branch andNorth Branch of the Saskatchewan River, the Cree and Assiniboin were reportedonce again to cover much of the same territorial range and to participatejointly in trading parties and raiding expeditions (figure 1) (Milloy 1972:9410; Sharrock 1974: 111; Russell 1991). In this general region, however, theyappear to have formed encampments that were more ethnically separate anddistinct than those in the Qu'Appelle area (Coues 1897, 2: 522523; Ray 1974:9697, 99100; Sharrock and Sharrock 1974: 2333). Also, in contrast to many areasfarther east, where Cree and Assiniboin were interspered across the samelandscape in more or less equal numbers, there was a spatial divide in the farwest (Ray 1974: 107113). Here the vast majority of Assiniboin were prairiedwellers, whereas most of the Cree lived in the parklands and forests (Morton1929: 47; Ray 1974: 148155; Russell 1991:181186). Not surprisingly, the culturaldivide that distinguished the two populations was more obvious here as well.West of the Battle River's junction with the North Saskatchewan, the Cree andAssiniboin were primarily forest-adapted trappers. They covered much of the sameterritory, but here the Cree far outnumbered the Assiniboin. Their local groupswere smaller, widely dispersed, and more ethnically distinct, but once again,these were interspersed over a common territorial range. Also, at"},{"pageContent":"Page 103the turn of the nineteenth century, the Ojibwa were brought into the area byEuropean traders from places as far east as Sault Sainte Marie (Coues 1897, 2:603, 653, 703705). Along much of the North Branch of the Saskatchewan River, theexpansion of Cree, Assiniboin, and later Ojibwa onto the prairies was impeded bythe presence of Blackfoot-Blood-Piegan and Sarcee (Sharrock and Sharrock 1974:21), and, as a result, few of these populations were recruited to a Plains wayof life until a much later period.Aside from the fact that the western Cree and Assiniboin were distributedunequally across adjoining ecozones, there were also other conditions that keptthem more separated than groups farther east. One of the more important of thesewas that the Cree, especially those along the North Branch, were much moredependent on trade, alliance, and intermarriage with neighboringBlackfoot-Blood-Piegan (Milloy 1972: 4963, 73). Even after hostilities eruptedwith these groups in the early nineteenth century, the North Branch, or\"Upriver,\" Cree were the ones most often involved in peace-seeking efforts(Milloy 1972: 96106, 200206). In subsequent years, they often took politicalstands that were different from the South Branch, or \"Downriver,\" Cree, who weremore adapted to the prairies and more closely aligned with the Plains-orientedAssiniboin in trade and in an unending pattern of warfare with the Atsina andBlackfoot-Blood-Piegan (Milloy 1988: 3140, 83102, 103118).In the far west as elsewhere, trade and military alliances connecting theAssiniboin and Cree reached back many generations. In the early decades of thenineteenth century, however, the merger pattern between these two populationswas much more amorphous and loosely woven than in regions farther east.Intermarriage and coresidency were reported, but generally not in the samedegree. Here a polyethnic alliance formation existed, but the social networksthat supported it appear to have been less dense and by extension lesscompelling than those evolving in the eastern and central portions of theAssiniboin's and Cree's territorial range. Ironically, however, the firsthistorical reference to the name \"Cree-Assiniboin\" as a distinct ethnicascription comes from the record of Alexander Henry's travels in this regionduring 1808 (Coues 1897, 2: 597). This ethnically mixed band, which was observedat Fort Vermillion, was rare in the area at this time and in all probability wastraveling here from a home location in the vicinity of the Qu'Appelle River,where such groups were common.New Patterns of Merger: 1830 to 1870The years between 1830 and 1870 mark another period when significant change tookplace in the lives of native peoples in the northeastern Plains. First of all,groups who once traded with the British at entrepôts along the"},{"pageContent":"Page 104Assiniboine and Qu'Appelle Rivers were turning their sights to the Americansestablishing posts at Fort Union near the confluence of the Yellowstone andMissouri Rivers (Sharrock and Sharrock 1974: 6869; Ray 1974: 147154, 207). Bisonwere becoming harder to find and starting their precipitous decline in theeastern grasslands (Ray 1974: 205207, 229233; Vogelin and Hickerson 1974:127128). Moreover, increasing numbers of Metis were entering the prairie regionsas full-time freedmen hunters and traders (Hickerson 1956; Ross 1957: 255257;Ray 1974: 205207, 229233; Vogelin and Hickerson 1974: 114125; Peers 1987:124127, 147153, 1994: 154156). Finally, smallpox epidemics were sweeping acrossthe region, decimating several populations in their path (Denig 1961: 7173; Ray1974: 188192; Taylor 1977; Trimble 1986). Taken together, these events triggereda variety of changes in regional patterns of merger and in the ethnicaffiliations of local groups.Eastern Regions. In the first half of the nineteenth century, the easternprairie region occupied by the Assiniboin, Cree, and Ojibwa underwent a majorchange in its ethnic composition. In the first half of the nineteenth century,increasing numbers of Ojibwa moved into the area, and as they did so they becamewidely incorporated into the Cree-Assiniboin body politic (Vogelin and Hickerson1974: 122, 126127; Howard 1977: 512). By the 1840s they had moved from beingminor players in the region's Cree-Assiniboin melting pot to becoming itsdominant population after Cree and Assiniboin numbers were severely depletedduring the smallpox epidemic of 1837 to 1838. Mirroring what had happened inother areas sixty years earlier, much of the prairie region south of theAssiniboine River became Ojibwa in the face of these population losses (figure2) (Ross 1957: 269272, 324325; Denig 1961: 7173; Ray 1974: 187192; Howard 1977:2123; Vogelin and Hickerson 1974: 103104, 117, 120137; Peers 1987: 135178).The growing prominence of the Ojibwa, however, was not a simple process of oneethnic group replacing the others; rather, it involved a complex process ofamalgamation in which ethnic groups indigenous to the area and new arrivals aswell formed at least two emergent ethnic communities. In one, the Ojibwa, alongwith a small population of Cree and Assiniboin, became closely affiliated withthe Metis, who were beginning to occupy much of the same territorial range (Ross1957: 269272, 324325; Denig 1961: 110111, 123131; Vogelin and Hickerson 1974:77, 96, 103104, 117, 122). As described in detail elsewhere (Ross 1957; Sprenger1972; Dusenberry 1985), the prairie Metis were themselves a newly emergentethnic community, with people of predominately mixed French/English, Ojibwa,Cree, and Assiniboin ancestry. After the fur trade collapsed, many of themjoined together to take up buffalo hunting and to become independent traders andtransporters.

Theyalso shared commercial connections to British and American interests along theRed River, and their settlements were often intermixed as well. After thesmallpox epidemic of 1837 to 1838, the Metis became the dominant population inareas northeast of the Turtle Mountains (Stevens"},{"pageContent":"Page 1061859: 148149; Giraud 1945: 820821; Howard 1977: 4651; Ross 1957: 84, 248,255257, 411412; Sprenger 1972: 5255; Ray 1974: 205207; Vogelin and Hickerson1974: 8485, 93, 9899, 115, 119, 123, 126, 128137). But even though the Cree,Assiniboin, and Ojibwa were now minority populations in this region, they stillretained a vested interest in territories that reached to the Assiniboine andRed Rivers (Ross 1957: 411412). This common interest was aptly described byFather Belcourt, who stated that \"the Crees and Assiniboins regard themselves asequally masters of these lands with the Chippewas, having acquired them jointlywith the latter, at the expense of their blood\" (quoted in Vogelin and Hickerson1974: 117, emphasis in original). Thus, notwithstanding a change in this area'sethnic composition, there was still a strong sense that it was a jointly heldterritory.As in earlier decades, the regions ethnically diverse residents were merged andconnected to each other through kinship and marriage (Vogelin and Hickerson1974: 100, 111120, 126, 129). Until the 1840s they continued to form a tightlyknit polyethnic alliance formation. Thereafter, and largely as a result ofpopulation losses sustained by the Cree and Assiniboin, merger patterns in thisarea took on a new appearance. The Cree and Assiniboin, who were not absorbedinto the emergent ethnic community of the Metis, remained in the area inconsiderably reduced numbers either as small remnant communities or as membersof ethnically mixed bands of Ojibwa. In either case, they constituted minoritysegments within an ethnic bloc confederation where the Ojibwa and their Metisrelatives dominated the scene.Beyond the Turtle Mountains to the valley of the Souris River, another patternof merger was evolving. When the hide market developed along the Missouri Riverin the 1820s, Assiniboin and Cree, along with some Ojibwa in their midst, beganto trade with the Americans (Kurz 1937: 5556; Howard 1952; Denig 1961: 8182; Ray1974: 147154). In addition to the attraction of new trade opportunities, jointforces of largely Assiniboin and Cree pushed their territorial ranges farthersouth and west as the size and dependability of bison populations declined inthe east. By the 1830s, many of the allied Assiniboin-Cree and a growingpopulation of Ojibwa newcomers were reported spending much of their time huntingand camping in the region of the Souris River (Ross 1957: 255257; Ray 1974:205207; Sharrock and Sharrock 1974: 6869; Vogelin and Hickerson 1974: 127128).After the 18371838 smallpox epidemic, however, the Ojibwa became a dominantethnic presence on the prairies between the Turtle Mountains and the SourisRiver. In contrast to what happened farther east, however, an emergent ethniccommunity emerged out of the combined forces of Assiniboin, Cree, and Ojibwa.Although this population is usually called the Plains Ojibwa in modernethnographic sources, its ethnic origins were actually much more"},{"pageContent":"Page 107diverse (Howard 1977: 2123). Some of its members were descended from theOjibwa/Saulteaux/Bungi of western Ontario, while others traced their ancestryback to the mixed communities of Chippewa, Huron, Ottawa, and even Menomineefrom northern Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Whether their roots reachedback to the northern or southern shores of Lake Superior, the Ojibwa who werelocated on the Plains west of the Turtle Mountains lived among and intermarriedwith Cree and Assiniboin (Howard 1977: 117123; Peers 1987: 7387, 101102, 1994:2021). Indeed, the very diversity of their roots has led to disagreement amongscholars over whether they constitute a branch of the Ojibwa or the Cree (Howard1977: 511). Even within the ranks of their modern-day descendants on the TurtleMountain and Rocky Boys Reservations, consensus is lacking over whether theybelong to the Cree or Ojibwa (Dusenberry 1962: 52; Howard 1961, 1977: 511; Fox1983: personal communication).Much of the confusion stems, at least in part, from the fact that the westernOjibwa who lived on the prairies covered a vast territorial range, and, as aconsequence, they were not a uniform population either in terms of their cultureor the sociopolitical alliances they maintained with outside groups (Skinner1914; Howard 1977; Peers 1987, 1994). Those who eventually spent most of theirtime west of the Turtle Mountains were probably the most ethnically mixed of theOjibwa populations on the prairies. In fact, they were so intermingled withAssiniboin and Cree that they came to be identified with them in name. Indeed,if ethnographers and historians followed the path of indigenous ethnic namingpractices, it would become apparent that local systems of ethnic classificationwere quite different from those that have become standardized in the literature.One implication of this difference is that indigenous naming practices mark adistinct ethnic group that gets lost in conventional scholarly classifications.The name these \"Ojibwa\" called themselves is Naka.wiyiniuk, which means\"speakers of a foreign language\" (Howard 1961, 1977: 6). The Algonkian-speakingCree also called them Nahka.wiyiniwak (speakers of a foreign language) asopposed to the generic name they gave themselves, Ne.hiyaw, which translates as''those who speak the same language\" (Smith 1981: 267268; Mandelbaum 1979: 8).This, incidentally, is the same meaning as the name Shiya-iyeska, applied tothem by neighboring Assiniboin and Dakota speakers (Albers 1974: 5455).Shiya-iyeska is also a name given to Assiniboin bands of Cree-Ojibwa ancestry,and when used in this context the name is translated either as \"Cree-talkers\" or\"Cree-speakers\" (Kennedy 1961: lxxiilxxv). Such a consistency in namingpractices indicates that these Ojibwa were well nested in polyethnic allianceformations with the Cree and Assiniboin, but it also suggests that within thisalliance some were forming a separate and ethnically"},{"pageContent":"Page 108distinct population. Ethnographic descriptions (Skinner 1914; Howard 1977;Albers, Ahlers, and Howard in press) of their historic culture and socialorganization clearly support this view, and it also suggests that although theywere related to Ojibwa (Bungi) living on the prairies north of the TurtleMountains, they were different from them in many critical respects (Howard 1977:511).One of the bands from this newly emergent ethnic community was led by LittleShell, who lived for many years in the Fort Peck area of Montana. He did sobecause close relatives were enrolled at this agency, including a maternaluncle, Red Stone, who was identified as Assiniboin. He was also related to theCree-Assiniboin Broken Arm, who was a member of the Shiya-iyeska division, manyof whom settled at Fort Peck. It was this Assiniboin division whose members wereintermarried with the Ojibwa who called themselves Naka.wiyiniuk. Indeed, someof the descendants of Little Shell, who eventually settled on the TurtleMountain Reservation, carry the surnames \"Cree\" and \"Assiniboin\" (Bottineau1900: 99, 114; Delorme 1955: 132134; Howard 1977: 525; Fox 1983).The Central Regions. In the late 1820s, combined forces of centrally locatedAssiniboin, Cree, and Ojibwa were also pushing their territorial reach farthersouth and west onto the High Plains (Pilcher 1824: 453457, 1838: 474; Larpenteur1898: 92; Sharrock and Sharrock 1974: 6162). Besides the establishment of anAmerican trading presence at Fort Union on the Missouri River, there were otherfactors which precipitated this movement. One of the most important was theAtsina's abandonment of lands north of the Missouri River (Flannery 1953: 1213),and another was the opening of peaceful relations with the Hidatsa and Crow.Trade and military alliances established with the Crow in the 1830s, plus apeace accord reached with the Hidatsa in the 1850s, laid the groundwork formovements south of the Missouri along the Yellowstone River (Milloy 1972: 4243,163164, 211, 216; Weist 1977: 4549).After the 1830s, the largest concentrations of Assiniboin, along with smallernumbers of Cree and Ojibwa, were located west of the Souris River in an areaextending to the Wood Mountains and then south along the Poplar River to theMissouri (figure 2) (Maximillian 1906, 22: 387388, 23: 1415, 190; Sharrock andSharrock 1974: 6869; Ray 1974: 9698, 104, 207212; Vogelin and Hickerson 1974:117). Only three decades earlier, some of those residing in the Wood Mountainswere reported in the vicinity of the Turtle Mountains (Maximillian 1906, 23:201202; Campbell 1963: 108). In addition to migrations from the east, there werealso reports of groups moving to this area from the Qu'Appelle region (Denig1961: 8182). Here, as in their more easterly locations, growing numbers ofAssiniboin, Cree, and Ojibwa were leaving"},{"pageContent":"Page 109their former homelands and moving west because of changing market opportunitiesand declining bison populations (McKay 1858; Ray 1974: 207208).Much of the area along the Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers was inhabitedprimarily by Assiniboin. By contrast, the neighborhood of the Wood Mountains wasmore equally populated by representatives of each of the three ethnic groups. Itcan be surmised from a variety of sources that the Wood Mountains-Poplar Riverregion, much like the Qu'Appelle area thirty years earlier, was a highlyintegrated zone with polyethnicity reaching beyond the level of regional tradeand military alliances to the very fiber of local residence groups. In theirnewly inhabited lands in the Wood Mountains-Poplar River region, Assiniboin,Cree, and Ojibwa settlements were interspersed across the same geographiclandscapes. These populations also intermarried, traveled and encamped together,and fought on the same side against Atsina, Lakota, and now theBlackfoot-Blood-Piegan (Hamilton 1834a, 1834b, 1835a, 1835b, 1835c, 1835d;McKenzie 1835a; Maximillian 1906, 22: 387388, 23: 1415, 1718, 190, 201202; Abel1932: 390391; Larpenteur 1898: 155164; Kurz 1937: 202; Denig 1961: 80, 82,110111; Campbell 1963: 23, 108; Sharrock and Sharrock 1974: 74, 79, 80). Indeed,some Euramerican observers (Maximillian 1906, 23: 1516; Sharrock and Sharrock1974: 7983) who came to this area in the 1830s reported that these groups notonly shared the same territory but that they were largely indistinguishable intheir appearance and customs.This area certainly conformed to a polyethnic alliance formation, yet it alsotook on many of the characteristics of a hybridized group coalition. This issuggested by the writings of some Euramerican observers who consistently blurredthe ethnic origins of the populations who wintered in the Wood Mountains. Thus,bands associated with such figures as Iron Child and Broken Arm were identifiedas Cree sometimes and at other times as Assiniboin even within the same source(Hamilton 1835c; McKenzie 1835b; Maximillian 1906, 23: 16; Larpenteur 1898:155164; Kurz 1937: 202; Denig 1961: 80, 82, 110111, 114; Campbell 1963: 23;Boller 1972: 125126, 138144). 1 This apparent confusion in ethnic identitycannot be attributed simply to observer error. It was more likely a consequenceof the dual, and in some instances triple, ethnic affiliations of the bandslocated in this region.In the 1830s, many of the hybrid Assiniboin and Cree bands described in theQu'Appelle region in earlier decades were also migrating in southwesterlydirections (Sharrock 1974: 111). By the late 1840s, some of their winter campingsites were located at the eastern edge of the Cypress Hills, and their huntinggrounds extended from the Milk River north to the Prickly Pear (or Cactus) Hills(figure 2) (Denig 1961: 7173). These hybrid bands were the ones"},{"pageContent":"Page 110identified in the ethnographic literature as the Young Dogs, or Nehiopwat inCree (Fraser 1963: 89; Sharrock and Sharrock 1974: 9091; Mandelbaum 1979: 910).Although much of this Cree-Assiniboin population was destroyed in the epidemicsof the 1830s (Denig 1961: 7173) and 1850s (Sharrock and Sharrock 1974: 136137),they still constituted a distinct ethnic force in 1868, when Issac Cowie (1913:302303) described them as parties to a large buffalo hunt in the Cypress Hills.As Susan Sharrock (1974: 112113) writes, Cowie's account (1913: 302303) clearlyseparates the ethnic identities of Assiniboin, Cree, and Saulteaux (Ojibwa) fromthe \"semi-Stony and Cree 'Young Dogs.'\" During the 1860s the Young Dogs werepart of a larger polyethnic alliance formation in southern Saskatchewan, inwhich member groups traveled a common territory, hunted together, and alliedwith each other for military purposes. Yet it is also clear that the Young Dogswere described as being a politically and ethnically distinct group within thealliance and as being closer to the Assiniboin than the Cree (Cowie 1913:308317). Not only did they have a distinct location in the camp circle, but theyalso maintained their own warriors' lodge (Cowie 1913: 308309, 331).The case of the Young Dogs is clearly an example of a hybridized groupcoalition. The collective ethnic ascription for this group is very informative,insofar as it is derived from a warrior society ascription (i.e., Young Dogs orBig Young Dogs of the Assiniboin and Big Dogs of the Cree) that was common inthe Plains (Lowie 1909: 79; Mandelbaum 1979: 110120). That this ethnicallyhybrid population came to be identified with a sodality-like name is notsurprising, since warrior societies were a principal means of bringing aboutcohesion and support within and across local ethnic group boundaries (Albers1993: 119122). In a manner not dissimilar to the Dog Soldier division of theCheyenne, described in detail by John Moore (1974, 1988), the Young Dog bandswere at the frontiers of Cree and Assiniboin expansions into contestedterritorial zones. Indeed, it might even be argued that it was the sodalityalliances of Young Dog warriors among the Assiniboin and the Cree that advancedthe process of structural integration between these two ethnic blocs and that,in so doing, paved the way for interethnic ties in other areas of social life,especially marriage and coresidency (Albers 1993: 121).As in the past the Qu'Appelle region continued to be at the crossroads ofpolyethnic alliance formations. Now, however, the ethnic composition of theregion was changing. The Ojibwa were becoming a dominant ethnic presence,especially in areas north of the Qu'Appelle River, while their numbers weresmaller and intermingled with Cree, Assiniboin, and Cree-Assiniboin to thesouth. There were also a number of groups evolving a mixed Ojibwa and Creeheritage, and by the 1860s they had come to dominate this regions ethnic"},{"pageContent":"Page 111landscape (Palliser 1863: 202; Cowie 1913: 302303, 308310; Denig 1961: 110111;Fraser 1963: 1926; Hind 1971: 46, 53; Ray 1974: 96100; Sharrock 1974: 113).More so than the Saskatchewan River populations farther north, many of theethnically mixed Assiniboin-Cree, Cree-Assiniboin, Cree-Ojibwa, andAssiniboin-Cree-Ojibwa populations who traveled the country between theQu'Appelle and Assiniboine Rivers in the northeast and the Wood Mountains andCypress Hills in the southwest were wiped out in the smallpox epidemics of the1830s and 1850s (Denig 1961: 7173; Ray 1974: 188192). Most of them were toodepopulated to retain a politically independent status, and as a result some oftheir historic uniqueness as hybrid groups was eventually lost. In later decadesthey tended to affiliate politically and identify ethnically with one of theirparent ethnic blocs.After the 1870s, for example, the Nehiopwat were identified primarily with aCree ethnic bloc. Even though Issac Cowie (1913: 308) had linked thempolitically with the Assiniboin, they were eventually included among theNamihkiyinawak, or \"Downstream\" Cree, ethnic divisions (Fraser 1963: 4;Mandelbaum 1979: 1). They appear to have become more associated with Cree, notbecause they were any less Assiniboin than their relatives farther south butbecause they tended to take more of their trade north to posts in territoriesdominated by Cree (Milloy 1972: 163164). In addition, after their numbers wereseverely depleted by the epidemics of the 1830s and 1850s, the more northerlyhybrid groups probably recruited new members from the ranks of the Cree, whowere now a much larger population in the area (Hind 1971: 46, 53; Sharrock andSharrock 1974: 9091).By contrast, the hybrid bands in the Wood Mountains became more closely linkedto one of their parent ethnic groups, where they were known as the Shiya-iyeska.This happened not only because they traded, traveled, and intermarried withpredominately Assiniboin bands on the Missouri River but also because, in lateryears, it became more expedient politically for them to emphasize the Assiniboinside of their identity. Here, as they did farther north, epidemic populationlosses contributed directly to realignments in merger patterns and associatedethnic identities. In both of the areas where ethnically mixed Cree andAssiniboin had once formed hybridized group coalitions, they were now embeddedin the ethnic bloc confederations of their respective parent populations.Western Regions. Although the sociopolitical divide between Assiniboin and Creealong the North Branch of the Saskatchewan River was still obvious by themid-nineteenth century, it was not as pronounced as it had been in earlierdecades (Palliser 1863: 202; Fraser 1963: 1142; Milloy 1972: 223229). In thisperiod increasing numbers of parkland-adapted Cree and Ojibwa"},{"pageContent":"Page 112were leaving their homelands to become full-time prairie dwellers, and they weredoing so for many of the same reasons as Cree and Ojibwa in regions farther east(Milloy 1988: 9599, 103118). With this influx, some of the earlier distinctionsbetween the Plains Assiniboin and Cree began to break down. While each stillretained a unique language and cultural practices, reports of theirintermarriage and coresidency abound, as do references to the sharing ofterritory and collaboration in communal bison hunts (Cowie 1913: 317; Sharp1954: 2930; Hind 1971: 107; Milloy 1972: 232237, 249250, 256260; Dempsey 1984:39, 45, 59). Also, most of the Plains Cree, including those along the NorthBranch, were more firmly and uniformly on the side of the Assiniboin in what hadnow become a largely uninterrupted wave of raiding and war with theBlackfoot-Blood-Piegan and their allies, the Atsina (Milloy 1972: 167199, 1988:9599). With the strengthening of military ties, increased intermarriage, andcoresidency, as well as more frequent collaboration in productive pursuits, thesocial networks that supported polyethnic alliance formations in this areabecame much more ramified and tightly knit.In fact, after the 1840s many of the Cree, Assiniboin, and Ojibwa who livedalong the North Branch of the Saskatchewan River were extending their huntingforays farther south. In these movements, the territorial ranges of the northernAssiniboin, Upriver Cree, and Ojibwa were starting to overlap those of theCree-Assiniboin, Downriver Cree, and other populations in the south (figure 2).In the 1860s, all these populations were reported to hunt together and live incommon encampments in the vicinity of the Cypress Hills (Cowie 1913: 308310;Bennett 1969: 142155; Dusenberry 1954, 1985; Sharrock 1974; Dempsey 1984). Thesegroups, and other ethnically mixed populations from locations in the northeast,moved to the plains of southern Saskatchewan and adjoining areas in northernMontana because of diminishing economic opportunities in their home locales. Bythe 1870s, this entire area had become a haven and a melting pot for a widevariety of native ethnic groups in search both of a livelihood and ofindependence (figure 3) (O'Connell n.d.; Rodnick 1938: 20, 77; Sharp 1955:213218; Sharrock 1974: 111113; Spry 1976; Vogelin and Hickerson 1974: 153163;Dusenberry 1954, 1985; Dempsey 1984).Added to the increasing complexity of interethnic relationships in the regionwas the addition of Crow and Hidatsa to local polyethnic alliance formations.Newly established trade relationships with the Crow and Hidatsa created an evenlarger expanse of territory in which groups could peaceably live and travel.After 1870, the Assiniboin, Cree, and Ojibwa range extended from the NorthBranch of the Saskatchewan in Alberta to the Yellowstone and Musselshell Riversin Montana (figure 3). Relations between the Hidatsa-Crow and Assiniboin-Creewere generated and solidified through intermarriage, adop-"},{"pageContent":"Page 1130113-01.GIF [52740fb71405779ddb0f403bd0af5976.gif]Figure 3.Overlapping territorial ranges, 1875.tion, and sodality \"brotherhood,\" and they contributed to an even greater ethnicdiversification in band membership (Bowers 1965: 5, 217218, 260, 287, 295;Milloy 1972: 4243, 163164, 223, 229; Dempsey 1984: 2584; Weist 1977: 3941). InSaskatchewan, for example, one band, whose ancestry was predominately Cree butmixed with Assiniboin and Ojibwa, was led by a Crow-Hidatsa known as SweetMedicine (Dempsey 1984: 29). In Montana, a leader of Cree-Ojibwa-Assiniboinancestry named Little Poplar was married to a Crow woman. He and his followersspent much of their time hunting and living in regions south of the MissouriRiver until U.S. military forces inter-"},{"pageContent":"Page 114vened in the 1880s and forced them to relocate in Canada (Dempsey 1984: 59).Throughout the northwestern Plains, ethnic hybridization was penetrating moredeeply into the roots of kinship formations and affecting a larger number oflocal residence groups. Whether local bands identified with single ethnic namesor hyphenated ascriptions, their ancestries were becoming more complex andethnically mixed.By the middle of the nineteenth century, the polyethnic alliance formations inwhich the Assiniboin, Cree, and Ojibwa were nested gave these populationsuninterrupted access to at least three major sources of Euramerican trade,including the Hudson Bay Company entrepôts along the river systems of Canada,the American fur-trade posts on the Missouri, as well as a variety of smallindependent outfits that operated an overland trade route connecting St. Paulwith the Red River and then onto the plains of North Dakota and Montana (Howard1977). Their expansive territorial range also encompassed diverse grassland,parkland, and forest habitats, and until the 1850s it gave them access to threeof the large bison populations in the northern Plains. Finally, with the growinginclusion of Crow and later Hidatsa in their political coalitions, they hadaccess not only to new territory and a steady supply of horses but alsoadditional manpower to protect the territories in which they lived and traveled(Anonymous 1940: 130; Milloy 1972: 4243, 163164, 223, 229).In the years between 1840 and 1870 the process of merger had become even morewidespread and complex. Bands traveled and settled over much wider areas,extending their territorial reach, diversifying their economic opportunities,and expanding their social ties (Vogelin and Hickerson 1974: 221224; Dempsey1984: 2555; Albers and Kay 1987: 6774). Widening the range of contacts andresources to which local groups had access was a sensible strategy foraccommodating the rapid political, economic, and demographic changes takingplace in their midst. That this pattern continued well after the formation ofreservations, even in the face of forces which denied its existence, speaks toits strength as a strategy for adapting to rapid change.Further Ethnic Realignments in Postreservation Times: 1870 to 1890In the 1870s reservations were established in northern Montana at the Fort Peckand Fort Belknap agencies for Assiniboin occupancy. No reservation, however, wascreated for the Plains Cree and Ojibwa in the United States, nor had reservesbeen established in Canada for these groups or the Assiniboin. Since the UnitedStates was preoccupied politically and militarily with the Lakota and Cheyenneduring the 1870s, little was done during this decade to address the situation ofthe nontreaty Assiniboin, Cree, and Ojibwa who inhabited the plains of NorthDakota, Montana, and adjoining areas in Canada. As a consequence, many of thenontreaty Assiniboin-Cree-Ojibwa traded at"},{"pageContent":"Page 115and took rations with their Assiniboin, Crow, and Hidatsa relatives who wereaffiliated with U.S. reservations (Simmons 1871: 140; Alderson 18731875; Bogy18741879; Lincoln 1878, 1879; Rodnick 1938: 20, 70). At the same time, theseIndians, along with those \"officially\" under U.S. trust, traveled to places likeFort Walsch to take rations in Canada (Sharrock and Sharrock 1974: 127139). Inthe years after 1870 most of the Ojibwa, Cree, and Assiniboin continued tojointly occupy and opportunistically use their territories as they had inprevious decades (Morris 1881; Kline 1882; Sharrock and Sharrock 1974: 127139;Dempsey 1984: 2555, 9297, 102110).Notwithstanding the imposition of U.S. and Canadian sovereignty over thisregion, which included the establishment of international boundaries andtribally fixed treaty borders between Lakota, Crow, Atsina, Piegan, and someAssiniboin (notably those who lived south of the Missouri River under theleadership of Foolish Bear), many of the Plains Assiniboin, Cree, and Ojibwacontinued to cover their territories, most of which were now concentrated alongthe international line, in a hybridized fashion (figure 3). Since neither theUnited States nor Canada had the means to enforce any of its imposed boundaries,local Indian populations dispersed themselves across the region usingorganizational strategies to which they had become accustomed and largelyignored the borders, which were still only paper abstractions.The continued movement and settlement of Cree, Assiniboin, and Ojibwa on bothsides of the international line, however, was increasingly politicized after itbecame apparent that some of the Metis bands in their midst were arms suppliersto the Lakota and Cheyenne (Freeman 1872; Vail 1872; Merritt 1876). Since themilitary believed these arms came from Canada (even though many were traffickedout of networks originating in St. Paul), it put pressure on Canada to taketreaty and scripts with the Indians who the United States presumed were\"Canadian,\" which meant, by and large, Cree, Ojibwa, and Metis (Bennett 1969:142155; Sharrock and Sharrock 1974: 127139; Dempsey 1984: 59, 92). AlthoughCanada did so and removed many of the border Assiniboin-Cree-Ojibwa to reservesfarther north along the Qu'Appelle and Saskatchewan Rivers, several mixed bandscontinued to remain in the border areas of Montana, not only because bison werestill to be found in these areas but also because many of them were closelyrelated to the Assiniboin, Crow, and even Blackfoot populations already enrolledon U.S. reservations (Dusenberry 1985; Dempsey 1984: 9297, 102110).When U.S. hostilities with the Lakota subsided, the military turned itsattention to the ethnically mixed populations of Assiniboin, Cree, and Ojibwa,along with related groups of Metis, who were staying in Montana and adjoiningareas of southern Saskatchewan. For a wide variety of reasons, these groupsbecame identified generically as either Cree or Canadian. No matter"},{"pageContent":"Page 116what their real ethnic origins happened to be (and many of them had been bornand lived most of their life in the United States and had little or no Creeancestry), they became subject to years of military harassment, which includedthe destruction of their settlements and their forced removal to Canadian soil.However, these groups resisted military harassment and returned to the UnitedStates, where they encamped by themselves or among reservationbased relatives(Kline 1925; Dusenberry 1954, 1962, 1985; Dempsey 1984: 96105).By the 1880s, there were still several groups of Indians without any officialtrust status in northern Montana and North Dakota. Some of them were members offull-blood bands of Assiniboin, Cree, and/or Ojibwa, but the vast majority weremembers of the regions growing Metis community. Much of this population remainedlandless not because their native origins were denied but because their ethnicancestry did not fit preconceived notions about the dispersion of AmericanIndians across the geographic landscape. They were identified consistently asCree, an Indian tribe for whom the United States assumed no trust responsibilityunder the assumption that it had never occupied American soil. Although many hadCree ancestry, they were also Assiniboin and Ojibwa and even Crow, Hidatsa, orBlackfoot. Ironically, most of them had close relatives who were fully enrolledon reservations in the area. Because their hybridized ethnic backgrounds andidentities did not match the picture of the policymakers, which was basedlargely on a notion of tribal blocs with exclusive memberships and territories,some of these ethnically mixed groups remained landless until the twentiethcentury (Bottineau 1900; Dusenberry 1954, 1962, 1985).ConclusionSome scholars (Smith 1969; van den Berghe 1973; Skinner 1975) have viewed ethnicpluralism as a condition unique to the state, arguing that only states havestructures which can contain as well as control the varied and at timesconflicting interests of diverse ethnic groups. To assert that the historicalsocial formations of the Ojibwa, Cree, and Assiniboin were not ethnicallypluralistic is like saying there is no religion without a church, no politicswithout a state, and no economy without a market. The issue is not whetherpluralism exists outside the state but rather how different kinds of socialformations incorporate and integrate ethnically diverse populations instructurally distinct ways.The alliance formations of the Plains Assiniboin, Cree, and Ojibwa constituteone sort of pluralistic structure based on a process of merger. Between 1780 and1870, their patterns of integration ranged from loosely structured alliances interritorial use, trade, and military affairs among ethnically separate residencegroups to highly integrated and ethnically hybrid coalitions. In some"},{"pageContent":"Page 117areas these even reached a stage where new ethnic groups were formed, includingthe Nehiopwat and Naka.wiyiniuk. The diversity of merger patterns that evolveddefy easy generalization, except to say that they were in a constant state offlux and becoming. Not only did these configurations change from one locale toanother, but they were also transformed within each geographic area over time.Even though they were responsive to historically specific forces, it is clearthat epidemic disease coupled with changing economic opportunities wereimportant in bringing about their transformation (Albers and Kay 1987: 7480;Albers 1993: 115119).During the nineteenth century, a growing competition over access to horses,territory, and trading opportunities contributed to the emergence of interethniccoalitions over the entire Plains. For the most part these coalitions took onthe appearance of clustered network formations built around segments ofdifferent ethnic groups whose members banded together and jointly protectedshared territorial ranges and trade routes (Sharrock 1974; Ewers 1975; Weist1977; Albers and Kay 1987; Hanson 1987; Moore 1987; Albers 1993). In manyimportant ways, these clustered structures differed from the chainlikeconfigurations that had evolved in and dominated the region during the previouscentury (Albers 1993: 100112). As Sharrock (1974: 112119) so skillfullydemonstrated, these polyethnic formations were organized segmentally, with localgroups forming large political and economic blocs and subdividing into smallerones as circumstances warranted. One of the most important characteristics ofthese formations was their flexibility, which enabled groups to rapidly reworktheir relations and even identities as local situations demanded.Although segmentary patterns of alliance making under merger were widespread inthe Plains, there were important structural differences from one locale to thenext. Among the Cheyenne and Lakota, for example, these formations were morecentralizing and less amorphous than those of the Cree, Ojibwa, and Assiniboin,a difference which may reflect other widely reported contrasts in the socialorganizations of these groups (Oliver 1962; Moore 1974, 1987). Indeed, it mighteven be hypothesized that the ethnic bloc confederation pattern of merger wasmuch more pronounced and enduring among the Cheyenne and Lakota as a result of agreater formality and stability in the organization of their councils andsoldier sodalities, whereas the hybridized group coalition pattern was morewidespread among the Ojibwa, Cree, and Assiniboin because their councils andsoldier sodalities were less centralized and more informally constituted (Oliver1962; Moore 1974, 1987; Albers 1993). If this was the case, it might also helpus understand why ethnogenesis appears to have followed contrasting paths forthese populations as well.However particular patterns of merger evolved in the Plains, it is clear that"},{"pageContent":"Page 118one of the more significant challenges facing students of American Indianethnohistory is a greater understanding of the changing complexity ofrelationships that interconnect ethnically diverse populations across thegeographic landscape (Quinn 1993). In an intellectual climate where essentialisttheorizing has been rejected in favor of highly particularistic reconstructions,little has been done to compare and explain the character and dynamics ofinterethnic relations across different empirical settings. Yet there is agrowing need to do this. Not only is it important for reaching morecomprehensive understandings of regional integration, ethnic pluralism, andethnogenesis in regions such as the Plains, it is also necessary for developingmore sophisticated theories of interethnic articulation on a global scale.Note4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 1.Contrary to John Ewers's (1974: 4344) writing on the matter, there is compellingevidence to indicate that the Assiniboin Broken Arm and the Cree Broken Arm ofthe Wood Mountain area were one and the same person, while the Broken Armsreported in the vicinity of the North Branch of the Saskatchewan River and atRed Lake in Minnesota were different men (Kane 1968: 49; Milloy 1972: 163164;Vogelin and Hickerson 1974: 148)."},{"pageContent":"Page 119Ethnogenesis in the Guianas and Jamaica Two Maroon CasesKenneth BilbyThe term ethnogenesis, though it entered the English language only a few decadesago, has become well established in the social science lexicon. The growingcurrency of the term in anthropology reflects an increasing awareness of thefact that sociocultural systems and identities are rarely as static or as closedas was once thought.In current usage, ethnogenesis most often denotes a gradual process throughwhich older ethnic categories and boundaries are redefined. Sometimes it is alsoused to refer to the transformation or shifting salience of preexisting culturalidentities as they become politicized in new contexts. Only rarely is the termapplied to cases of full-fledged, truly new ethnogenesis; that is, the rapidformation of entirely new societies and cultures when individuals of diversebackgrounds are suddenly thrown together by fate and forced to create societiesafresh. Perhaps this is because these societies are more the exception than therule in human history.Such societies have been characterized by anthropologists as neoteric orcenogenic, for they cannot be said to have grown entirely, or even primarily,out of any previously existing society; they embody unique and unprecedentedbiological and cultural blends (Gonzalez 1970; Bilby 1988). Many of these newsocieties owe their existence to the major upheavals and displacements ofpersons associated with European conquest and expansion during the last fivecenturies, with the African slave trade playing a particularly prominent role.Because of their relatively recent and rapid formation and"},{"pageContent":"Page 120their typically small scale, these societies provide us with a uniqueopportunity to explore some of the ways in which groups of uprooted anddisplaced individuals have managed to construct new social orders and culturalidentities out of multiple pasts.Among the new peoples that sprang into being as a result of European conquestand colonization are the Maroon societies of the Americas. These societies arecomposed of descendants of enslaved Africans who escaped from plantations andcreated new societies and cultures beyond the reach of the European colonialpowers. Maroon communities were once spread across the slaveholding areas of theWestern Hemisphere, but only a few have survived to the present. 1 The WindwardMaroons of Jamaica and the Aluku, or Boni, of French Guiana and Surinam are twosuch present-day Maroon peoples. This essay compares the Jamaican Maroon andAluku cases, focusing on processes of ethnogenesis and examining how economicfactors, religious ideology, and cultural notions of kinship have intersected inthe construction of new identities and new forms of solidarity.2The Jamaican Case: The Early YearsThe first major groupings of Maroons in Jamaica emerged when the British wrestedthe colony from Spain in 1655 and large numbers of Spanish slaves took advantageof the turmoil to flee to the mountainous interior. Some groups sided with oneor the other of the European adversaries, while others remained aloof from theconflict.3Among these early Maroons were both Africans, veterans of the transatlanticvoyage, and Creoles, born in Jamaica. In later years the original SpanishCreoles were joined by Creole slaves born and raised in what had become aBritish colony. The African-born Maroons, judging from both historical andcontemporary evidence, represented a complex spectrum of geographical andcultural regions, ranging from Senegambia and the Gold Coast down through theCongo-Angola area and even into East Africa.4 Although individuals belonging tocertain broad ethnolinguistic categories, such as those labeled ''Congos\" or\"Coromantees\" by the Europeans, may have been numerically dominant at differentperiods, there were always smaller numbers of individuals from a wide variety ofother African ethnic groups present, and the ethnic balance continued to shiftover time. At any rate, it is certain that many different African languages andcultural backgrounds were represented among the Maroons throughout the lateseventeenth and early eighteenth centuries (Kopytoff 1976a: 3742).Very little can be said with certainty about how the early rebels who escapedfrom the plantations and banded together in common cause organized them-"},{"pageContent":"Page 121selves politically and how they actually coalesced into new societies.Nonetheless, a few general statements can be made based on our limited knowledgeof life among the Maroons prior to 1739, the year of their landmark peace treatywith the British.First, initial groupings tended to grow out of military alliances. Politicalauthority among the early Maroons was typically vested in a handful of militaryleaders who had gained respect as able fighters and skillful strategists and hadbecome recognized as chiefs (Kopytoff 1973: 7079, 1978; Schafer 1973: 6061,6465; Campbell 1988: 5052). Political authority also had a religious dimension,and in some cases ritual specialists, Obeah men and women, who did notnecessarily play an overt military role nonetheless exercised considerablepolitical influence (Kopytoff 1973: 8389, 1978: 298, 301; Campbell 1988: 51,123, 176177; Hart 1985: 8081).Early Maroon social and political organization was relatively unstable. Theformative period was characterized by shifting alliances and fluctuatingboundaries of group identity, with new members continually being added throughrecruiting and raids on the plantations (Kopytoff 1976a: 4246, 1978: 295296). Insome communities, an imbalance of the sexes, with men greatly outnumberingwomen, caused internal tensions and served to increase instability (Kopytoff1973: 7980, 1976a: 43, 1978: 301304; Schafer 1973: 76). 5For their subsistence, the Maroons depended on a form of domestic productionbased on slash-and-burn horticulture in which women played a central role(Edwards 1796: xxx; Dallas 1803: 106108; Kopytoff 1973:161163). One can assumethat over time this led to the development of more stable domestic groups tiedto a land base. Fixed settlements emerged in the general vicinity of primaryareas of cultivation, and the inhabitants of these new communities establishedterritorial claims over the villages they built and the lands they cultivated(Kopytoff 1973: 69). By the early eighteenth century a number of major Maroontowns existed in the Blue Mountains of the eastern part of the island, the mostfamous being Nanny Town, named after the legendary female religious leader ofthe Windward Maroons.Nanny Town appears to have been at the center of a series of shifting alliancesduring the early eighteenth century that led to the formation of a looseknitfederation that included several dispersed Windward Maroon communities. It isnot clear to what extent Nanny and her followers exercised actual authority overthese other villages in daily life, but her preeminence as a religious (andpossibly political) leader seems to have been recognized by virtually all theeastern Maroon groups. In any case, each Windward Maroon village was under theleadership of its own chief or chiefs and operated in a more or less autonomousfashion, although military cooperation and some exchange"},{"pageContent":"Page 122of personnel between different villages is known to have taken place (Kopytoff1978: 298301; Campbell 1988: 49). Windward Maroon attempts to forge militaryalliances reached their greatest extent in the 1730s, when the eastern Maroons,under increasing pressure from the British, who had recently seized their maintown, sent a group to the Leeward Maroons and their chief, Kojo (Cudjoe), morethan a hundred miles away on the opposite side of the island, to propose across-island confederation (Kopytoff 1973: 3839, 53; Hart 1985: 8687; Campbell1988: 70, 9294). The attempt failed, possibly, in part, because of Britishintervention, and the Windward and Leeward Maroons have maintained separateidentities until today. In contrast, the three presentday Windward Marooncommunities of Moore Town, Charles Town, and Scot's Hall recognize commonhistorical origins and a largely shared cultural heritage.Jamaican Maroon ethnogenesis unfolded through a number of interdependentprocesses. In the first instance, new group identities must have grownorganically out of the social and biological bonds that were generated byongoing face-to-face interaction in the early Maroon settlements. It is quitepossible that some actual or fictive kinship relationships were carried overfrom the coastal plantations, as some aspects of kinship ideology undoubtedlyalso were (see Mintz and Price 1992: 4344, 6667); but the creation of new familyunits, however these were defined, must have been at the foundation of the newshared identities that began to emerge in the forest. This process was no doubtclosely linked with the gradual definition of territorial claims and boundaries,for the recognition of rights over land gave concrete expression to socialidentities already rooted in domestic relations. At a later stage, politicalrelationships superseding these local kin-based groupings would also come intoplay, as larger social identities were constructed out of political alliances.Thus, emerging definitions of ethnic identity (that is, who was included inone's primary group of identification and who was not) came to reflect not onlyactual relationships of kinship and, in later years, descent but also extralocalpolitical and military alignments.Religious ideology, derived largely from African models and principles,constituted a powerful social cement, not only for relationships based onkinship, descent, and coresidence but for broader political coalitions lackingsuch a foundation in local social relations. It is known that African-derivedritual oaths were used to induct new recruits into Maroon communities, sealpolitical alliances between distinct groups, and even consecrate the treatiesmade with the British in 1739, which remain sacred to the Maroons to this day. 6Moreover, as we shall see, present-day evidence suggests that the syncreticAfro-Jamaican religion developed by the Windward Maroons was family-"},{"pageContent":"Page 123based, with ceremonial life revolving around possession by the spirits ofancestors, who were called upon to help resolve community problems.The Role of Religion in Jamaican Maroon Ethnogenesis: A Closer LookUnfortunately, historical documentation of land tenure and kinship structure inthe pretreaty Maroon communities is almost entirely lacking. Ethnographic datagathered in recent times cannot be used to construct a reliable picture ofsocial and economic organization in the early days, since these communities wereradically transformed by the 1739 treaties, which in effect created Maroonreservations, thereby setting in motion fundamental social, political, andeconomic changes (Kopytoff 1973, 1976b; Campbell 1988: 126163). Yet thetraditional religion still practiced in the eastern Maroon communities retainsmany features that must have characterized Maroon religion during the formativeperiod. Since Maroon religion has resisted external pressures for change byremaining closed to outsiders and has been kept separate from Christianitythrough a process of compartmentalization (Bilby 198 l: 5355), this is the onearea in which contemporary ethnography can be used to help recover certainaspects of the process of ethnogenesis not revealed in the written record. Whenwe examine contemporary Windward Maroon religion from this perspective, we beginto see the close relationship between religious ideology, kinship, and thesocial meaning of land. This in turn allows us to imagine more clearly how suchlinkages must have operated more than two centuries ago to bring a new peopleinto being. Let us take a closer look, then, at traditional religion in theWindward Maroon community of Moore Town.Traditional religion in Moore Town is centered on the ceremony known as KromantiPlay or Kromanti Dance. Central to Kromanti Play are the ties maintained betweenliving Maroons and their ancestors through spirit possession, or myal. Althoughin theory any Maroon can become possessed by an ancestor, it is the specializedmedium known as the fete-man (or, if female, fete-uman) who serves as the chiefintermediary between the living and the dead. The fete-man cultivates specialrelationships with a number of individual human ghosts, some of whom were spiritmediums during their own lives. These ghosts devote themselves to the fete-manand carry out his bidding in exchange for offerings and favors.A good portion of any Kromanti Play involves interaction between possessedspirit mediums and the other Maroons in attendance, who remain unpossessed(kliin yai). This ongoing interaction between living Maroons and their ancestorsreinforces a strong sense of continuous community identity across generations,even as it allows local social and political relationships to"},{"pageContent":"Page 124be aired, negotiated, and redefined in a public setting. It also renews andhelps to maintain sacred ties to the lands on which the ancestors are buried.The question of burial has traditionally been an important one for Maroons. Forone thing, a fete-man must sometimes visit the graves of those Maroons whosespirits he relies on in order to make offerings, properly care for the burialsite, and otherwise ensure that these spirits' demands are met.As far back as present-day Maroons can remember, Moore Town has had a specialrule governing burial. This rule dictates that all burials within the boundariesof the communally held Maroon treaty lands must take place within a speciallydesignated, centralized public cemetery. (This contrasts with the general ruralJamaican pattern of burial within private yards or on separate family plots.)Originally, the community burial ground of Moore Town was located at a placecalled Bump Grave, next to an area near the center of the village known as theasafo ground or asafo house, where major Kromanti Play ceremonies were onceregularly held. Long ago, however, the cemetery was moved to the Anglicanchurchyard nearby. Although this change of location says much about theincreasing influence of the Anglican church, it did nothing to diminish theimportance of the ties between the living and the dead maintained throughKromanti Play. Kromanti Play continued to be practiced separately, and the oldrule of centralized burial was simply carried over from the original sacredMaroon burial ground to the new Anglican cemetery. Even today, only Maroons arenormally buried in this community cemetery. This mode of burial serves tosustain a collective sense of Maroon identity, rooted in notions of commondescent and communal ownership of land, while endowing this identity with asacred dimension.The sacred relationship between land and the ancestors buried on it is notunique to Maroons. Elsewhere in rural Jamaica it has been shown that the commonpractice of burying kin on family plots contributes to the creation ofinalienable \"family land.\" Clarke (1966: 65), writing of this custom, reportsthat \"the religious association of land is strong: the spot on which theancestors are buried is sacred and land containing their graves should not bepermitted to pass into alien hands.\" In other words, the creation of such familyland establishes sacred, inalienable ties between individual parcels of land andthe groups of cognatic kin who inherit them. All descendants of the originalowner inherit rights to the land, and some of those who activate these rightsmay themselves be buried on the land when they die. Thus, over the generations asort of landholding corporation composed of cognatic descendants of the originalowner comes into existence (Besson 1988: 48). 7 \"Any member of this family'through the name or through the blood' has rights of use which are not lostthrough non-exercise for any period\" (Clarke 1966: 44).The burial practices of Maroons have served to create and maintain a simi-"},{"pageContent":"Page 125lar concept of sacred family land, although in the Maroon case this family landextends beyond individual yards or plots to encompass the entire territory heldby the community (i.e., the collectively held Maroon treaty lands). All membersof the Maroon community, whether actual ties of kinship can be traced or not,are said to belong to a single family by virtue of their common descent from anoriginal ancestress, Grandy Nanny, who is sometimes characterized as the \"motherof the Maroons\" (Martin 1973: 5357; Bilby and Steady 1981: 458; Bilby 1984b:1113). 8 In addition to being remembered as a great ritual specialist and leaderduring the time when the Maroons were at war with the British, Grandy Nanny isalso conceptualized as the original \"owner\" of the Maroon treaty lands.9Membership in the Maroon family is passed on bilaterally from Maroons to theirchildren, who automatically inherit \"Maroon blood\" at birth. Interestinglyenough, the main material consequence of possessing Maroon blood is that itconfers upon an individual guaranteed rights of usufruct over a portion of thecommunally held Maroon lands; all of Grandy Nanny's descendants (called Nanny'syoyo in the Maroon Kromanti ritual language) are entitled to a share of thisland. If a person's claim to membership in the Maroon communityor Maroon bloodisacknowledged, then the individual may acquire a parcel of land by applying tothe colonel, or chief, and the Maroon council (kamati), who are obligated toaccommodate the request.But Maroon blood has spiritual consequences as well, for possession of suchblood entitles one to participate in the ceremony of Kromanti Play. Thisceremony is the main site where the mystical notions of descent that define thesocial boundaries of the Maroon community are put to a sacred test. It isbelieved that the ancestors who possess mediums at Kromanti ceremonies are ableto \"smell\" the presence of non-Maroon blood, which they find intolerable. Shoulda non-Maroon (called obroni in Maroon Kromanti language), even an invited one,be present when possession occurs, the medium invariably becomes enraged by theoutsider's foreign smell and instantly attempts to attack the non-Maroonintruder. This response is conceptualized as an involuntary, almostphysiological, reaction to obroni blood, and there are no exceptions to it. Theobroni will be forced to leave. If he is able, however, to secure the help of aspecially assigned Maroon protector who agrees to guide him through a series ofordeals and rituals intended to assuage the enraged spirit, his presence willeventually become acceptable, and he will be able to stay during episodes ofpossession. (This applies, however, only to possessions by the individual spiritor spirits to which he has been personally introduced, and no others.) Thiscomplex ritual drama, which is enacted whenever nonMaroons visit Kromanti Playfor healing, as they frequently do, constitutes the clearest and most powerfulsymbolic representation in Maroon culture of the"},{"pageContent":"Page 126line dividing Maroons from non-Maroons (Bilby 1981: 7680). It serves to remindMaroons that the division between them and others is an immutable part of thenatural order (Bilby 1984b: 14).We see, then, how religious ideology, notions of kinship, and land tenure areclosely interrelated in the Jamaican Maroon case. The Maroon blood that allowsunchallenged entry to Kromanti Play, thought to have been inherited from acommon ancestress, symbolically embodies the family relationship shared by allMoore Town Maroons (as well as the boundary dividing Maroons from non-Maroons).Membership in this family in turn guarantees access to the communally heldMaroon treaty lands. This collectively owned material base continues to serve asone of the main foundations of Maroon ethnic identity in Moore Town. The sacredrelationship between the Maroon family (Nanny's yoyo), the communal lands, andthe ancestors buried on them is embodied by the centralized Maroon communitycemetery. This symbolized nexus of ideas about kinship, land, and cosmology isat the heart of Maroon identity in Moore Town. 10It is always risky to project from what is known of the present back into thepast. Yet with a little imagination, it is easy to see that the general conceptsof shared blood, family land, and ancestral presence, which survive in modifiedform today, must have been central to the initial process of ethnogenesis in theJamaican Maroon case.The earliest ancestors of these Maroonsthose who first broke away from theplantations and fled to the forest to start a new lifebegan their adventure ascollections of individuals who banded together in order to survive. Thesefugitives, taking their chances in a largely unfamiliar wilderness, started outin a condition that can be characterized as something close to an absence of\"society.\" While the collective effort to survive might have led them almostimmediately to begin the construction of what could be called a new society,based on shared experience and common understandings, the genesis of a newethnic identity would have required another generation at least. Only through aninitial process of biological reproduction could shared blood be created andincorporated into an ongoing process of social reproduction. Meanwhile,subsistence practices, including cultivation, would require a division of laborand the devising of domestic arrangements of one kind or another. These domesticarrangements would come to be associated with rights over land and the foodproduced on it, and these in turn would create a link between shared blood andthe specific sections of land over which groups of kin, however defined, hadcome to have recognized rights. Thus would family land of one kind or anothercome into being. To judge from contemporary ethnographic data, such family landwould likely have been defined partly in religious terms, and the burial ofancestors on such land would likely have played a part in this"},{"pageContent":"Page 127process. 11 A \"community\" (or family) identity based on common descent and ashared territory would gradually emerge out of these evolving relationships.Once this occurred, an initial process of ethnogenesis could be said to havetaken place. Ethnic identities formed in this way might then merge with others,for instance, through marriage outside of the original family or community or asa result of political alliances.To summarize: the limited evidence that we have suggests that Jamaican Maroonethnogenesis depended on the interplay of three primary factors: theavailability and disposition of land, the emergence of localized kin groupingssharing a territorial base, and the development of a religious ideology thatreflected and supported the emerging social order. Let us now briefly considerthe Aluku Maroons of French Guiana and Surinam to see how their origins comparewith those of the Jamaican Maroons.The Aluku Case: The Early YearsAs in the Jamaican case, we have very little certain knowledge about theearliest days of the Aluku.12 While some of their ancestors are known to haveescaped into the forest as early as 1712, the majority fled from coastalSurinamese plantations during the mid-eighteenth century, hiding out in theunsettled swamplands of the Cottica River region. Following a protracted warwith the Dutch colonists, they moved across the Maroni River to French Guiana in1776. In 1793 they suffered a major defeat when their leader, Boni, was killedby a party of Ndjuka Maroons who had allied themselves with the Dutch. In 1860they were finally recognized by a French-Dutch treaty as a free people with theright to travel without restrictions in both French Guiana and Surinam. Sincethis time the majority of Aluku have been considered French subjects and since1969 have been full French citizens.The African ancestors of the Aluku, like those of the Jamaican Maroons, camefrom many different regions, had widely varying cultural backgrounds, and spokea large number of different languages. The early Aluku also included Creolesamong their numbers, individuals who had been born and raised on Surinameseplantations. Although there is evidence that at least one of the groups thatbanded together in the forest after escaping was composed primarily of Kromanti(or Kormantin) individuals originating from the same general region of WestAfrica, most groups were highly mixed, and these varied origins are stillreflected in certain aspects of present-day Aluku culture, such as religiousstructure (Hoogbergen 1990: 203207).13Like the early Jamaican Maroons, the earliest ancestors of the Aluku, those whoescaped into the forest and banded together, organized themselves into a seriesof politically autonomous groupings with their own military headmen and theirown settlements and cultivations (Hoogbergen 1990:2351). They"},{"pageContent":"Page 128too relied upon slash-and-burn methods and a system of domestic production inwhich women eventually came to play a key role (Hoogbergen 1990: 1819). Fromtime to time these autonomous communities joined together and collaborated inmilitary expeditions against the coastal plantations. As in Jamaica, politicalalliances were usually ratified by sacred blood oaths; reports of such ritualoaths abound in the historical literature (Hoogbergen 1990: 1718).Like the Windward Maroons of Jamaica, the ancestors of the Aluku came toconstitute a loose federation, characterized by shifting alliances between localchiefs and a certain amount of intermarriage and movement between communities.Like Nanny in Jamaica, a central figure emerged in this federation, a militaryand religious leader named Boni. A great strategist and particularly courageousfighter, Boni coordinated and led most of those military efforts in which chiefsand warriors from more than one Maroon community participated. Despite thenumerous long-term political and military alliances Boni helped to establish,the various communities and chiefs maintained their political autonomythroughout the war period (Hoogbergen 1990: 199). It was only after thedevastating defeat of the 1790s that the remnants of the different groups cametogether and formed a single sociopolitical unit displaying most of the elementsof Aluku social structure as it exists today. The final political unification ofthe separate bands into a single \"tribe\" or \"nation\" seems to have been effectedthrough the subsuming of the different groups under the authority of a singleset of religious oracles; namely, the oracles controlled by the oldest group ofrebels, those led by a chief named Asikan and, after him, by Boni. The divinityoriginally worshiped by this particular groupa god known as Tata Odun, said bythe present-day Aluku to have come over from Africa along with the ancestorsthusbecame the supreme tribal deity to which all the different groups now owedobeisance (Bilby 1990:118).The settlements formed by the early ancestors of the Aluku were even less stablethan those of the early Jamaican Maroons, for the Aluku ancestors changed thelocations of their villages often, making mobility a part of their strategy ofevasion (Hoogbergen 1990: 199201). Even so, the evidence suggests that theprocesses through which group identity was constructed were similar in the Alukuand Jamaican cases. Early on, for example, coresidence became an importantgoverning principle, and the social identities that began to emerge out offace-to-face interaction, domestic relations, and shared experience graduallybecame anchored to territorial concerns.The Aluku ancestors, however, blended this process of defining territorialclaims and boundaries with an organizing principle that apparently had nocounterpart among the Jamaican Maroons. In the Guianese forest the variousemergent communities of rebels identified themselves collectively with the"},{"pageContent":"Page 129specific plantations from which their founding members or leaders had escaped.As an expression of a new corporate identity tied to collective ownership ofland in their new forest environment, the members of each band adopted the nameof this plantation of origin (or, sometimes, the plantation's owner or theregion in which it was located). As more stable kin groups began to develop andto stake territorial claims based on settlement and first cultivation of anarea, a principle of uterine descent began to be applied to the alreadyoperative concept of collective ownership of natural (or other) resources. Withthe advent of new generations, membership in these collectivities was passed onin the female line, and full-blown corporate matriclans, known as lo, eventuallyemerged (Hoogbergen 1990: 207215). 14Like the Jamaican Maroons, the ancestors of the Aluku came to possess areligious ideology that had developed in tandem with, and both mirrored andsupported, emerging social identities. Not only villages, cultivated land, andnatural resources but certain important ritual possessions came to becollectively owned by the clan. For example, each village acquired its ownshrine to clan ancestors, along with its own mortuary house, where major ritesfor deceased clan members were performed.The Role of Religion in Aluku Maroon Ethnogenesis: A Closer LookAs in the Jamaican case, present-day Aluku Maroon religion provides us withimportant clues to the process of ethnogenesis. Aluku society today is dividedinto six primary named, corporate matriclans, or lo, each of which \"owns\" one ormore villages, the surrounding lands and natural resources, and thehorticultural camps and areas of cultivation established by clan members in moredistant locations (Hurault 1961: 1820; Bilby 1990: 145146). In many ways the lo,which operates as a politically autonomous corporation in most contexts,resembles a distinct \"ethnic group.\" It is at the level of the clan that theAluku acquire their primary social identity and feel the strongest sense ofgroup loyalty, and it is at this level that religious ideology, notions ofkinship, and ownership of land intersect most neatly.Most of the Aluku clans are localized in single villages, although a few, havingundergone fission, are now divided between two or more villages. Like theJamaican Maroons, the Aluku maintain close ties with their ancestors. However,the Aluku do not communicate with the spirits of ancestors primarily in thecontext of ceremonies featuring spirit possession,15 nor do graves or cemeteriesserve as the primary locus of such communication.16 Most invocations ofancestors occur, rather, at a central village shrine called the faaka tiki. Thefaaka tiki consists of one or more wooden posts, the oldest of which is said tohave been \"planted\" in the ground by the village founder, the person"},{"pageContent":"Page 130who originally ''cut the village\" (cleared the land for settlement). Therefellow clansmen assemble on various occasions to pour libations and requestfavors or protection from clan ancestors. Like the central cemetery for JamaicanMaroons, the Aluku faaka tiki symbolizes the sacred, inalienable ties betweenthe ancestors, their living descendants, and the lands they hold collectively;at a more general level, it stands for the corporate identity of the clan. Alsosymbolic of this connection is the mortuary house (kee osu) that every villagepossesses. Here all clan members belonging to the village are brought when theydie to be consulted through divination, honored with offerings, and feted withmusic and dance before being taken to the appropriate cemetery in the forest forburial. Although inactive most of the time, the mortuary house stands in aprominent location, usually near the faaka tiki. As the main site of thetransition from the world of the living to that of the ancestors, it tooconstitutes a powerful symbol of the sacred relationship between land,ancestors, and descendants.The shared essence thought to be inherited by members of the same clan, ratherthan being conceptualized as \"blood\" (as it is by members of the Jamaican Marooncommunity of Moore Town), is represented with the term bee, meaning \"womb.\" Tosay that two people \"are bee\" is to say that they are related through uterinelinks: at some point in their ancestry, whether one generation ago or ten, theyare thought to share a \"common womb.\" At the highest level of generalization(and the only level that corresponds to a corporate identity), a person's bee(matrilineal kin) and lo (clan) coincide (and at this level the two terms can beused interchangeably). 17 All the members of a lo, whether genealogicalrelationships are known or not, are held to be related by virtue of commondescent from an original band of runaways and/or an original ancestress to whomlinks are no longer traceable.Land, valued ritual possessions, and other material assets belonging to the clanare owned collectively by all descendants. As among Jamaican Maroons, land useis governed by a system of usufruct; and although rights to use of particularplots are transmissible across generations within families or clan segments, theland remains inalienable and cannot be given away or sold to persons outside theclan.We have seen how each village has its shrine to clan ancestors and its mortuaryhouse, both of which symbolize the corporate identity of the clan. But there isyet another distinct sphere of religious activity that is peculiar to each clan.This important sphere comprises a special category of gods and spirits calledkunu. Much like the idea of Maroon blood in Jamaican Kromanti Play, the Alukuconcept of kunu defines and represents, in religious terms, the \"natural\"boundaries between those who are of a clan and those who are not. A kunu is anavenging spirit created by an act of wrongdoing against a human"},{"pageContent":"Page 131being, spirit, or god. A victim of murder, for instance, may come back as aghost to haunt the murderer and other members of the murderer's clan withillness and misfortune. Likewise, a god that once inhabited the body of a papasnake may return to exact vengeance from the clan of the individual who causedits death while burning a patch of ground in preparation for cultivation.Spirits of several different kinds, when offended, may become kunu in this way.18What all kunu share is that, once created, they are thought to remain attachedto a clan eternally. Furthermore, they are thought to strike indiscriminatelywithin the clan, without regard to individual guilt or responsibility for theoriginal act of wrongdoing. This means that all clan members, in theory atleast, are equally vulnerable to attacks by such avenging spirits.19 Inaddition, each kunu limits its attacks strictly to its chosen clan, and inprinciple, members of one clan need never fear an attack from another clan'savenging spirits.Despite their fearful nature, kunu have a positive side as well which becomesevident only when they possess mediums and begin to communicate through them.This opens the way for a process of \"taming,\" whereby the avenging spirit may beturned from a threatening force into a source of aid whose powers can be used tobenefit rather than harm the community. This positive transformation can only bemaintained, however, by periodic offerings and collective prayers intended to\"cool the heart\" of the spirit. These observances often bring together largenumbers of fellow clansmen at the faaka tiki, the aforementioned shrine to theancestors that symbolizes the corporate identity of the clan. A particularly oldand venerable kunu may even have a post of its own planted at this centralshrine, merging the notions of common descent and spiritual unity within asingle sacred structure. Thus, in its ''tamed\" form, a kunu both serves as apositive expression of corporate clan identity and defines the boundaries ofthat identity, since members of other clans are excluded from the community ofworshipers defined by common vulnerability to that avenging spirit.This brief description should serve to show that in the Aluku case, as in theJamaican Maroon case, religious ideology, kinship, and land tenure remainclosely linked. The spiritual essence in which all members of a clan are thoughtto share is conceived as having been inherited through descent from a commonwomb. This shared essence is manifested in the common vulnerability of all clanmembers to the same kunu. By virtue of their common descent, clan membersinherit not only a shared set of avenging spirits but also rights to the landand other resources held collectively by their clan. The corporate identity ofthe clan, as a territorial unit, is represented by the central village shrine tothe ancestors, planted in the earth by village founders, as well as the mortuaryhouse, where clan members undergo the transformation from living persons"},{"pageContent":"Page 132to ancestors who from then on will be addressed, like those of earliergenerations, at the faaka tiki, the village shrine.In Aluku religion, as in that of the Jamaican Maroons, we can still detect thekey elements that contributed to Aluku ethnogenesis, and we can imagine how thelinkage between these elements must have been at the foundation of this process.The parallels with the Jamaican Maroon case are apparent. In a sense, those whoran away and banded together in the Guianese forest were forced to start fromscratch. They came from a wide variety of different African backgrounds, andalthough it is known that the Creolized slave culture to which they had beenexposed on coastal plantations provided some basis for common understandings,they nonetheless found themselves in a largely unfamiliar environment without apreexisting social structure, fully shared culture, or sense of collectiveidentity. These they were forced to construct anew, while struggling to survivein the forest.As in Jamaica, the process of ethnogenesisas opposed to simple consociation,coresidence, and military alliancebegan with biological and social reproduction.Both archival and contemporary ethnographic evidence suggests that the firstgeneration of women among the runaways played a crucial role in this process.Their children formed the first kin groups to whom the property acquired andcontrolled by the initial bands of runaways could be transferred. A primaryresource was land, which came to be cultivated in large part by women, andrights established through first cultivation would have become attached overtime to kin-based domestic groups. As it turned out, membership in these groupsquickly came to be defined through a principle of uterine descent, which overthe generations led to the development of corporate lineages and clans(conceptualized as being descended from a common womb) with rights of ownershipand use over the territories first settled or cultivated by their matrilinealancestors (as well as the valued ritual possessions handed down from theseancestors).Along with corporate identities, the property-holding descent groups that beganto emerge from this process acquired lo nen (\"clan names,\" generally derivedfrom the plantation-related names used by the original bands of runaways), andthe evolving social structure was reflected in the emerging religious ideology.Descent groups evolved their own exclusive cults of kunu, or avenging spirits,while the sacred relationship between these corporate groups, the land they heldin common, and the ancestors became embodied in a standardized set of communityshrines consisting of the faaka tiki and the kee osu. It was the formation ofthese initial corporate descent groups that was at the foundation ofethnogenesis among the ancestors of the Aluku; the political alliances thateventually caused these descent groups to be merged into larger"},{"pageContent":"Page 133political units, thus expanding the boundaries of ethnic identity, as well asthe religious adjustments that came to reflect these expanded identities weresecondary.In summary, the general similarities to the Jamaican Maroon case are evident.Aluku ethnogenesis appears to have depended on the interplay of three primaryfactors, namely, the existence and domestication of an available land base, thedevelopment of localized kin groupings linked to territorial claims, and thegrowth of a religious system that reflected and undergirded the newly emergingsociopolitical structure.Differing Outcomes of Ethnogenesis in the Two CasesIn spite of the initial similarities, the societies of the Jamaican Maroons andthe Aluku eventually took on rather different shapes. This can be attributed notonly to the longer and greater isolation of the Aluku from the coastal societybut to the fact that the building blocks of ethnic identity in the two cases,similar as they were in a general sense, were conditioned by unique cultural andecological factors and were combined in politically different ways.Since at least the late eighteenth century, the primary unit of socialorganization and ethnic identification among the Windward Maroons of Jamaica hasbeen the politically self-contained individual settlement, each governed by itsown headmen and councils and none subject to a higher authority other than thatof the colonial government. In effect, ethnic identity and community identityhave long been coterminous for Jamaican Maroons. In contrast, among the Aluku,while the primary unit of social organization is the localized clan, ethnicidentification occurs at a higher level of political organization that outsiderssometimes refer to as the \"tribe.\" In other words, ethnic identity overarchescommunity identity in the Aluku case. While each of the six main Aluku clans hasits own village chiefs, and each village operates in most situations as apolitically independent unit, ultimate political and religious authority isvested in a paramount chief, known as the gaanman.In comparing the contemporary societies of the Jamaican and Aluku Maroons, itbecomes apparent that the structure of the single-community Jamaican Maroonethnic group, viewed as a whole, parallels that of the Aluku localized clan inseveral interesting respects. For reasons that are not yet entirely clear, theJamaican Maroons appear never to have adopted a principle of unilineal descentthat might have generated corporate clans or lineages similar to those of theGuiana Maroons. Nevertheless, the Windward Maroons of Jamaica, as we have seen,still think of themselves as a large, clanlike family, all of whose members arerelated through descent from a common ancestress, the legendary Nanny, eventhough the genealogical links can no longer be"},{"pageContent":"Page 134traced. This is not unlike the conceptualization of the Aluku clan, or lo, whichis imagined as being descended from an original band of runaways and/or anapical ancestress, although the genealogical links cannot be specified.The parallel can be carried further. Membership in an individual Jamaican Marooncommunity, which is acquired automatically at birth, confers upon the individualhis ethnic identity, his rights over communally held land and the naturalresources controlled by that community, and his eligibility to participate inthat community's traditional religious system, embodied in the ceremony ofKromanti Play, from which non-Maroons are excluded. Similarly, membership in theAluku clan, which is automatically inherited from one's mother, determines anindividual's primary social identity, his rights over the collectively ownedmaterial resources of the clan, including land, and his participation in acommunity of worshipers united by their common vulnerability to a number ofkunu, or avenging spirits. When all these similarities between the two societiesare taken into account, the typical ethnic unit developed by the WindwardMaroons of Jamaicathe self-contained ethnic community defined by territory,common descent, shared spiritual essence, and ideals of social and politicalsolidaritybegins to look something like the localized Aluku clan writ large.Indeed, one can surmise that had circumstances been right, the individual Alukuclans might have ended up, at least for a time, as self-contained,single-community ethnic groups bearing some resemblance to those in Jamaica.This could have happened, for instance, if the initial bands of runaways hadfailed to ally themselves with other bands and had continued to develop inisolation. On the other hand, had conditions been favorable in Jamaica, thepolitical alliances initially forged between separate bands and communitiescould have eventually led to a permanent overarching political authority and anexpansion of both territory and ethnic identity.The most important factors militating against either of these outcomes appear tohave been political and ecological. In the Aluku case, the separate bands werefinally forced together by adversity, their numbers having been greatly reducedby war, their most important leaders killed, and their crops destroyed. Thesurvivors had no option but to pull together and salvage what was left of theirfledgling societies (which by that time already included the beginnings of thedescent groups that were to evolve into today's Aluku clans). In the Jamaicancase, on the other hand, permanent political mergers between the various Marooncommunities were prevented by both British intervention and the lack of anadequate land base. The treaties of 1739 included relatively small grants oftax-free lands to individual Maroon settlements, resembling reservations. Laterin the eighteenth century a few additional land grants were made to communitiesin other areas that had been settled by related groups of"},{"pageContent":"Page 135Maroons. (Such land grants amounted to a form of official government recognitionthat the inhabitants of a settlement were Maroons.) Since then each individualcommunity has continued to hold its own treaty lands in common, and thiscommunal land base has helped define and maintain these officially recognizedJamaican Maroon communities as distinct ethnic entities, furnishing them withcorporate identities not unlike those of the landowning Aluku clans. 20 In theJamaican case, however, land has never really been freely available. Over theyears territorial expansion became less and less feasible as lands in thevicinity of the Maroon communities were claimed and occupied by the Britishcrown, private interests, and the expanding peasantry. Unlike the JamaicanMaroons, the Aluku, who inhabit a vast, largely unsettled rain forest, havealways been surrounded by an abundance of readily available land on which newclaims and settlements could be established as needed. Throughout most of Alukuhistory, there has been little to stand in the way of any social or politicalimpetus for territorial expansion.ConclusionThe two cases of recent ethnogenesis briefly examined here throw light on thedouble-sided nature of ethnicity as a social process. On the one hand, theethnic identities of the Jamaican Maroons and the Aluku are ultimately rooted innotions of common descent and shared substance and have grown organically out ofactual kin-based communities through a largely endogenous process of dailyface-to-face interaction and negotiation. On the other, they must also be seen,at least in part, as precipitates of larger political and economic forces. Thetreaties with the British government and the associated land grants, forexample, played a profound part in the definition of Jamaican Maroon ethnicity,hastening the development of corporate ethnic identities and influencing thepath this process took. Among the Aluku, interaction with colonial governmentsplayed a less obvious role. Yet, had it not been for their eventual alliancewith the French, the ancestors of the Aluku would probably have been absorbed bytheir more numerous Ndjuka Maroon neighbors, in which case they probably wouldnot have survived to the present as a separate ethnic group (Lenoir 1975: 314;Bilby 1990: 574). Today the Aluku are undergoing yet another kind ofethnogenesis as their ethnic identity becomes increasingly politicized and itsboundaries more pronounced in response to the rapid incorporation of theirterritory into the French state over the last two and a half decades (Bilby1990).As this last statement suggests, the term ethnogenesis has not always been usedto mean the same thing. Although a distinction is sometimes made in theliterature between primary ethnogenesis (the process whereby a new ethniccommunity or group comes into existence) and secondary ethnogenesis"},{"pageContent":"Page 136(the development of ethnic consciousness caused by social mobilization), theterm is often used without specifying which of these processes is meant, therebycreating a potential for confusion (see Riggs 1985). The distinction betweenprimary and secondary ethnogenesis is an important one, however, for itcorresponds roughly to two contrasting approaches or perspectives in the studyof ethnicity, one of which has come to be labeled \"primordialist\" and the other\"situationalist\" (also sometimes called \"circumstantialist\" or\"instrumentalist''). 21 On the one hand, cases of secondary ethnogenesissincethey tend to be linked with shifts in political and economic circumstances thathave suddenly rendered ethnicity useful as an organizing principle for theconscious mobilization of interest groupsquite naturally lend themselves toone-sided analyses emphasizing the situational nature of ethnicity in anethnographic present. On the other hand, cases of primary ethnogenesis, whichinvolve the gradual emergence of wholly new peoples or ethnic groups over time,reveal more clearly the complementarity and interdependence of situational andprimordial factors in the historical construction of ethnic identities.This is easily seen in the two cases of primary ethnogenesis we have examinedhere. Viewed from one perspective, new peoples such as the Jamaican Maroons orthe Aluku dramatically exemplify the situational nature of ethnicity, since theycan be shown to have come into being as a direct result of large-scale politicaland economic processes and conditions, such as capitalist expansion, warfare,slavery, conquest, displacement, and mass migration. If it were not for suchexogenous forces, these new ethnic groups would never have sprung intoexistence. From another point of view, however, these peoples also demonstratequite clearly the primordial nature of ethnicityits cognitive basis inemotionally charged notions of common origin, shared historical experience,kinship, and shared substance. Indeed, the evidence suggests that if such aprimordial basis for ethnicity does not exist to begin with, a newly formingcollectivity, as part of the process of becoming not just a group with commoninterests and goals but an ethnic group, will certainly create it. As Bentleyremarks, \"Ethnogenesis, the formation of an ethnic group where none existedbefore, requires 'primordialization' of group identity, consensual acceptance ofsome primordial ancestor, event, or place as the common 'root' of identity\"(1983: 9). In the case of the Jamaican Maroons and the Aluku, the beginnings ofthis process of primordialization came about spontaneously as a consequence ofthe biological, social, and political bonds through which diverse individualsand groups merged to create new collective identities rooted in kinship andterritorial rights. Out of this process emerged, along with these new collectiveidentities, religious ideologies and forms of historical consciousness that areas primordialwhich is to say as compelling, ineffable,"},{"pageContent":"Page 137and irreducible to political or economic strategies of the momentas any in theworld. 22Our comparison of ethnogenesis among escaped slaves and their descendants in twodifferent parts of the Americas clearly shows that ethnic identities andsentiments need not be associated with an ancient or immemorial past in order tobe backed by the force of primordial ties and loyalties. As recently as 350years ago, neither the Jamaican Maroons nor the Aluku existed. This much cannotbe doubted. No one, not even these peoples themselves, would argue that theirorigins trail off into an ancient, immemorial past and vanish into the mists oftime. Yet the ethnic identities of these two peoples are not lacking in depth.On the contrary, they are profoundly rooted in the same sorts of seeminglyprimordial ties and sentiments that lend ethnic identities their affective powerelsewhere in the world.As we have seen, the Jamaican Maroons and the Aluku, in creating new societies,very successfully primordialized their historical experience. Ethnogenesisdepended on an actual meeting and union of real individuals and a process ofsocial and biological production and reproduction that was complemented by thegrowth of a religious ideology reflecting the emerging social structure. As timewent on, the new peoples born of this process couched the political alliancesand extralocal relationships through which their nascent societies began toexpand in metaphors and symbols of kinship and breathed cosmological life intothem. The resultant ethnic identities, Jamaican Maroon and Aluku, are no lessprofound and genuine, nor any more contrived or mythical, than those of peopleswho, in absolute historical terms, are known to be much older. Like human beingseverywhere, the Maroons of Jamaica and the Aluku have both invented, and beeninvented by, their worlds.Notes4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 1.For a general overview of Maroon societies throughout the Western Hemisphere,see Price (1979).

Among her many contributions to the study of agrarianrelations in rural Jamaica is her finding that \"burial on family land, generallyfollowed by 'tombing,' places an individual kinsman within the wider context ofthe ancestors of the family line and also fuses this line with the immortalland\" (Besson 1988: 48).

Her claim that \"the relationshipis thought to result from intermarriage among descendants of the small originalgroup rather than from sharing a single common ancestor\" (Martin 1973: 53)conflicts with the statements of many of my informants, who said that it is notonly because of this early intermarriage but because all the Maroons of MooreTown are Grandy Nanny's yoyo (descendants) that they belong to a single\"family.\"4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 9.Fragmentary archival evidence suggests that the eighteenth-century Wind-wardMaroon leader Nanny actually did obtain legal title to at least a portion of thelands that now belong to the Moore Town Maroon community. In 1740, the yearafter the treaty, a grant of 500 acres in the vicinity of Moore Town was made bythe governor of Jamaica to \"a certain Negro woman called Nanny and the peoplenow residing with her.\" The wording of the registered land patent, now housed atthe Jamaican Government Archives in Spanish Town, specifies that the grant wasmade not only \"unto the said Nanny and the people now residing with her\" but to\"their heirs and assigns\" (Campbell 1988: 174180; see also Kopytoff 1973:137140).4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 10.The foregoing description of Windward Maroon ideas about communal land, descentfrom Nanny, and the ancestral presence represents an ideal picture abstractedfrom the statements of many different informants.

For example, despite the general rule of burial inthe central Anglican cemetery of Moore Town, there exists a smaller graveyard inthe outlying district called Seaman's Valley, near the border of the Marooncommunal lands, where both Maroons and non-Maroons have long been buried. Morerecently, a number of other churches in Moore Town have begun their own separateburial grounds, a trend which seems to be gaining increasing acceptance. I evenknow of a few Maroon individuals living on communal land (though not near thecenter of town) who have buried relatives in their own yards (for which theyhave been strongly criticized). Despite such conspicuous exceptions, the notionthat the Anglican churchyard is (as the cemetery next to the asafo ground oncewas) the \"proper\" and \"best\" place for a \"true-born\" Maroon to be laid to restis still widely held and constitutes the official position of the Maroon councilthat governs in Moore Town.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] Thecapsule description of Maroon descent ideology offered here, though accurateenough as an abstraction, also neglects to mention a number of ambiguities. Forone thing, some Moore Town Maroons question the tradition of common descent fromNanny, reasoning that the men and women who fought alongside this foundingancestress must have produced family lines of their own. Some go so far as tostate explicitly that the tradition is but a figurative representation andshould not be taken literally. Furthermore, the idea of a \"shared blood\"exclusive to Maroons (whether derived from Nanny or some other source) ischallenged by a long and complex history of intermarriage and sexual unionsbetween Maroons and other Jamaicans. Despite these apparent contradictions, themyth of Nanny as mother of all Maroons continues to function effectively at asymbolic level. Whether or not it is believed to be literally true, it embodiesthe corporate identity of those Windward Maroons who continue to hold land incommon, practice their Kromanti religion in private, and claim to belong to asingle family or clan. The boundaries of this identity, though not alwaysentirely clear in other contexts, continue to be sharply drawn at Kromanticeremonies, where those believed to share Maroon blood are symbolicallyseparated from those believed to be without it. (In actual practice, how apossessed medium ends up behaving in the presence of a visitor of uncertainblood tends to be worked out in advance through a complex process of negotiationinvolving members of the larger community.)4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] Thefact that the ideological abstractions discussed above are sometimescontradicted by a more complex reality does not detract from their value aslingering symbolic reflections of a past social orderreflections which, Ibelieve, may be used to throw light on the processes through which this ordercame into being.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 11.This process would undoubtedly have been influenced by two cultural principlesthat Mintz and Price describe as being among the \"widespread fundamental ideasand assumptions about kinship in West and Central Africa\"; namely, \"the emphasison unilineal descent, and the importance to each individual of the resultinglines of kinsmen, living and dead, stretching backward and forward through time\"and \"the use of land as a means of defining both time and descent,"},{"pageContent":"Page 1404171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] withancestors venerated locally, and with history and genealogy both beingparticularized in specific pieces of ground\" (1992: 66).4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 12.This historical summary, as well as some of the analysis that follows it, isbased on a careful reading of Hurault (1960), de Groot (1975), de Beet (1984),and Hoogbergen (1984, 1985, 1990), which are the best sources to date on thehistory of the Aluku.

Hoogbergen says of this group that \"their ethnic originnearly always traced back to the Kormantin and Gangu peoples\" (1990: 47). Inthis essay I do not examine in any detail the process of cultural Creolizationthat played a crucial part in the ethnogenesis of both the Aluku and theJamaican Maroons, having chosen to focus instead on the relationship betweenland tenure, kinship, and certain general features of religious structure andideology. Obviously, the African cultural backgrounds of those who created thesenew societies contributed to the process of ethnogenesis in many ways and atmany levels. The complicated question of African cultural continuities, however,cannot be adequately treated in the amount of space available in this paper.

The same term was applied to the corporate matriclans that emergedlater out of these original bands. The question of how exactly the Aluku andother Guianese Maroons came to settle on a unilineal (specifically, matrilineal)principle of descent in forming corporate kin groups has yet to be resolved. SeeMintz and Price (1992: 6971) and Hoogbergen (1990: 216219) for two contrastingpoints of view.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 15.Although it does not play the central role that it does in Jamaican Maroonreligion, direct communication with ancestors does occur among the Aluku throughthe occasional possession of mediums by the yooka (ghosts) of deceased clanmembers.

Instead, settlements suchas Comfort Castle, Ginger House, and Brownsfield (all settled many generationsago by Maroons originally from Moore Town), despite substantial populations,have developed into satellite communities that are granted politicalrepresentation on the Moore Town council. Although many of the Maroons in thesebranch settlements evince a strong sense of Maroon identity, sharing manycultural traditions with Moore Town people and participating to some extent inceremonial life there, they do not live on communally owned lands.

HillPrior to the 1980s, the ethnology of northwestern Amazonia focused almostentirely upon the eastern Tukanoan-speaking peoples of the Vaupés Basin inColombia and Brazil. Several outstanding monographs and numerous shorterpublications on eastern Tukanoan peoples provided in-depth perspectives onindigenous social organization, subsistence economics, mythology, ceremonialexchange, and sacred ritual (Goldman 1963; Reichel-Dolmatoff 1971, 1975; C.Hugh-Jones 1979; S. Hugh-Jones 1979). This rich ethnographic literature depicteda complex tapestry of riverine, fishing, and horticultural societies heldtogether by the practice of language group exogamy and internally organized intopatrilineal, patrilocal sibs that grouped themselves into larger, rankedconfederations, or phratries. Despite these common underlying principles oflinguistic exogamy and serial ranking of patrisibs, there were also numerousvariations and dissimilarities among eastern Tukanoan peoples that called forcomparative analysis and interpretation. Perhaps the most significant of thesedifferences was the fact that the Cubeo, a relatively large easternTukanoan-speaking people of the Cuduyarí River, did not practice language groupexogamy like other eastern Tukanoan peoples but instead divided themselves intothree exogamous phratries within a single language group. 1In the 1990s we have reached a new level of understanding that allows us toraise questions and hypotheses about the historical and political processeswhich gave rise to the unique configuration of multilingualism and ranked socialorganization in the Northwest Amazon region as a whole. Three areas"},{"pageContent":"Page 143of investigation during the 1980s have brought us to this new level ofunderstanding: (1) analysis of the eastern Tukanoan regional system as aflexible process that was in many respects analogous to \"dispersedhunter-gatherers, with their local group interdependencies, fluidity interritorial boundaries, and fluctuations in local group membership\" (Jackson1983: 6); (2) intensive ethnographic and historical studies among the variousphratries and language groups of northern Arawak-speaking peoples living alongthe Upper Rio Negro and its tributaries immediately to the north and east of theVaupés Basin (Wright 1981; Hill 1983; Gonzalez Ñ. 1980; Vidal 1987; Journet1988); and (3) the adoption of new approaches to indigenous histories among botheastern Tukanoan and northern Arawakan peoples (Wright and Hill 1986; Hill andWright 1988; Chernela 1988, 1993; Hugh-Jones 1988; Reichel-Dolmatoff 1985; Vidal1993). Each of these three developments has made significant contributions toour current understanding of history and social organization in NorthwestAmazonia. Taken together, these three new areas of investigation lead toconclusions very different from the pre-1980 ethnographic literature.Regional Analysis of Eastern Tukanoan Social OrganizationJackson's comparative study (1983) of eastern Tukanoan social organization inthe Central Vaupés Basin was a masterpiece of sociolinguistic analysis and thefirst major synthesis to demonstrate that the extralocal, regional ties amongeastern Tukanoan language groups were much more flexible and dynamic thanpreviously imagined. Although the principle of language group exogamy was almostperfectly adhered to in Jackson's survey of intermarriage patterns, 2 marriagestrategies ranged from an ideal of sister exchange between closely relatedaffinal groups all the way to symbolic bride capture among distantly relatedgroups with little or no prior history of intermarriage (Jackson 1983: 81 ff.).These divergent marriage strategies resulted in statistical clusterings of pairsof closely related language groups embedded within a broader, regional set ofalliances that were open, fluid, and dynamic. In a similar manner, relations ofmythic descent that united several language groups into extralocal rankedconfederations through the idiom of common brotherhood were also fluid andnegotiable rather than fixed and agreed upon. Jackson (1983: 8692) providesnumerous examples of disagreement over phratric organization, leading her toconclude that \"phratric membership is probably epiphenomenal\" (1983: 86) andthat \"it is fruitless to try to construct exclusive groupings based on phratricprinciples derived either from known marriage practices or statements byinformants\" (1983: 88).Jackson's analysis of regional social organization in the Vaupés Basin provideda foundation for asking new questions about the historical coming-into-being oflanguage group exogamy and ranked phratries among eastern Tuka-"},{"pageContent":"Page 144noan peoples. At a regional level, the principle of language group exogamyresulted in the integration of separate language groups into wider,geographically dispersed networks of trade and intermarriage. At a macroregionallevel, language group exogamy defined a clear yet permeable boundary betweeneastern Tukanoan peoples and \"others\" who failed to practice language groupexogamy. \"The Cubeo on the northern boundary of the region are at times excludedin discussions of 'real people'\" (1983: 97) because they marry among phratrieswithin the same language group. This example demonstrates how the principle oflanguage group exogamy serves as a means for defining the social boundaries ofthe eastern Tukanoan regional system, yet it still does not explain why easternTukanoan peoples chose to use language as the primary building block of theircollective identities. The existence of shadowy, dispersed phratries in theCentral Vaupés is even more mysterious. Why did eastern Tukanoan peoples developsuch ranked groupings of language groups if they served no apparent political oreconomic purposes?Recent Research on Northern Arawakan PhratriesPreliminary answers to these questions began to emerge in the 1980s throughintensive research among the northern Arawak-speaking phratries inhabiting theIçana-Guainía drainage area immediately to the north and east of the VaupésBasin. In-depth studies among the Hohodeni phratry of Brazil (Wright 1981), theDzáwinai and Wariperidakena phratries of Venezuela (Hill 1983), and the Adzaneniphratry of Colombia (Journet 1988) demonstrated the existence of stronglyhierarchical patrilineal phratries that were (and to some extent still are)localized within distinct riverine territories. The principle of serial rankingof patrisibs within these phratries was amplified through linkage to marriagerules so that men of highly ranked sibs in one phratry married only with womenof highly ranked sibs in other phratries (Hill 1983, 1987). Like the easternTukanoan peoples of the Vaupés Basin, the northern Arawakan phratries to thenorth and east considered shared language to be a crucial marker of collectiveidentity. However, instead of magnifying language differences through a rule oflanguage group exogamy, the northern Arawakan phratries minimized linguisticdifferences by giving emphasis to the mutual intelligibility of widely differentdialects (named after different ways of saying yes and no) within a single,regional ethnolinguistic community. This larger regional identity, calledWakuénai, or People of Our Language (Hill 1983), resembles a greatly expandedversion of Cubeo sociolinguistic organization, or a single language groupdivided into exogamous, internally ranked phratries. The Cubeo population ofapproximately 1,500 to 2,000 (Jackson 1983: 87) is concentrated in a singleriverine territory along the Cuduyarí River, whereas the Wakuénai phratriesnumber at least 8,000 people spread"},{"pageContent":"Page 1450145-01.GIF [616368e97aec0a18e8c6d4aad109c0da.gif]Figure 1.The Northwest Amazon region in Venezuela, Colombia, and Brazil. The ancestral lands ofWakuénai phratries are along the Isana, Aiarí, Cuyarí, and Guianía Rivers.across several different riverine territories in Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia(see figure 1). The strong resemblance between Wakuénai and Cubeosociolinguistic organization receives further confirmation from Goldman'sobservation that \"a possible translation of the Cubeo self-name Pamíwa is'people of the language'\" (cited in Jackson 1983: 84). In other words, the Cubeoselfname is probably an exact eastern Tukanoan translation of the northernArawakan self-name Wakuénai, or. People of Our Language.Research on the northern Arawakan, or Wakuénai, phratries during the 1980sdemonstrated that the eastern Tukanoan regional system of language group exogamyand ranked phratries could no longer be understood in isolation but only as partof a much larger region that included both eastern Tukanoan and northernArawakan phratries. Comparison of the two subregions revealed a clear contrastbetween localized, exogamous phratries among the"},{"pageContent":"Page 146Wakuénai and dispersed, ''epiphenomenal\" phratries among eastern Tukanoanpeoples (Hill 1985). Paralleling this basic contrast was the fact that theWakuénai preference for linking marriage to inherited rank within phratries waseither not practiced among the eastern Tukanoan (Jackson 1983: 75) or activelydiscouraged (S. Hugh-Jones 1979: 206). The contrast is also expressed in thesymbolic realm of religious beliefs: the Wakuénai phratries all claim to havedescended from ancestor spirits that emerged from the ground beneath the rapidsat the center of mythic space, whereas eastern Tukanoan peoples explain theirorigins in terms of a more mobile, decentralized process of journeying ancestral\"Anaconda-Canoes\" (Wright 1981; Hill 1983, 1985). Even without an examination ofhistory, the comparison clearly indicates that ranked social organization ismuch more fully developed among the Wakuénai than it is among the easternTukanoan. Simple logic points to the hypothesis that the mysteriousepiphenomenal phratries found among the eastern Tukanoan are the result ofinterethnic relations with the Wakuénai phratries to the north and east.The comparison is not complete, however, without a consideration of thetransitional forms of linguistic and social organization found along theboundary between eastern Tukanoan and northern Arawakan phratries. The Cubeo,who speak an eastern Tukanoan language but do not practice language groupexogamy, are located in the intermediate area between the Wakuénai and theCentral Vaupés. Like the Wakuénai, the Cubeo divide themselves into exogamousphratries and directly link the principle of inherited rank to marriagepractices (Jackson 1983: 75). Another eastern Tukanoan people who live in theintermediate area between the Central Vaupés and the Içana-Guainía drainage areaare the Wanano of the lower Vaupés River, and they also have localized phratriesand link marriage preferences to inherited rank (Chernela 1983). In other words,localized phratries that play a direct role in shaping intermarriage patternsand other forms of exchange are found among the Wakuénai and only those easternTukanoan peoples who live along the northern and eastern limits of easternTukanoan territory. Farther away from this area bordering on territories of theWakuénai phratries, eastern Tukanoan peoples do not have localized phratries anddo not link the principle of ranking to marriage preferences.New Approaches to Indigenous HistoriesPerhaps the most enduring legacy of anthropology in the 1980s was theadvancement of new ways of approaching indigenous histories. Eric Wolf'spowerful synthesis of global history (1982) brought a definitive conclusion tothe study of small-scale societies as isolated \"billiard balls\" by demonstratinghow the global spread of colonial powers had in one way or another transformed"},{"pageContent":"Page 147the political-economic conditions of even the most remotely situated peoples.Other influential researchers called for a reevaluation of indigenous oralhistories as a valid source of insight into the various ways that small-scalesocieties have struggled to cope with the contradiction betweeen forcedincorporation into state-level societies and the persistence of autonomouscultural identities (Rosaldo 1980; Sahlins 1981; Price 1983).The ethnology of Amazonian societies, and especially that of the NorthwestAmazon region, played a very active role in the emerging rapprochement ofhistory and anthropology during the 1980s. The Lévi-Straussian characterizationof Amazonian societies as \"cold,\" \"mythic\" structures had not only blindedresearchers to the possibility of studying indigenous understandings of thehistorical past but had preempted such studies by asserting that Amazoniansocieties actively suppressed any concern for knowing the historical past. Asimprobable as it may seem from today's vantage point, a leading authority onAmazonian social organization wrote as late as 1981 that \"this kind of thinkingis typical of the ideology of a Lévi-Straussian 'cold society' . . . a mythictimeless order is in each generation re-established\" (Kaplan 1981: 159). In thatsame year, Robin Wright's dissertation on \"History and Religion of the BaniwaPeoples of the Upper Rio Negro Valley\" (Stanford University, 1981) demonstratedthat ritual specialists and other elders among the Hohodeni (a Wakuénai phratryliving along the Aiary River in Brazil) had a complex tradition of oralhistories that encompassed historical events and processes dating back to atleast the early nineteenth century. Wright's archival research on the forcedremovals of indigenous peoples from the Upper Rio Negro region during the latecolonial period fully and specifically corroborated the Hohodeni elders'historical memories. The edifice of Lévi-Straussian structuralism and otherahistorical modes of anthropological theory began to crumble under the weight ofgrowing empirical evidence that Amazonian peoples had developed a rich varietyof oral histories that were grounded in mythic beliefs and ritual practices butnot frozen into a ''mythic timeless order.\" 3Having read an early draft of Wright's dissertation before going to do mydoctoral fieldwork among the Wakuénai phratries of Venezuela in 198081, I wasalert to the possibility that my indigenous interlocutors would express anactive interest in talking about the historical past of the region. They did notdisappoint me in this expectation, and shortly after completing my dissertation(Hill 1983) I began a series of collaborative writing projects on indigenoushistory, ritual, and myth with Robin Wright (Wright and Hill 1986; Hill andWright 1988).4 In a nutshell, we demonstrated that the Wakuénai phratries hadexperienced a long history of interethnic relations with expanding colonial andnational societies of Latin America and that this history was"},{"pageContent":"Page 148actively remembered through an array of narrative discourses and rituallypowerful ways of speaking. Even the most sacred of mythic narratives, or thestory of how the trickster-creator had raised the ancestral spirits from beneaththe rapids at Hípana, was not an attempt to freeze or deny historical changesbut a dynamic mode of historical interpretation that actively sought toreconcile indigenous forms of ritual power with the alien forms of power anddomination that Europeans and their descendants had brought into the region.Concurrent with our collaborative works on Wakuénai ethnohistory, otherresearchers began to study and publish works on the ethnohistory of othernorthern Arawakan peoples (Gonzalez Ñ. 1986; Vidal 1987) and on the easternTukanoan peoples of the Vaupés Basin. Reichel-Dolmatoff published an importantanalysis (1985) of Desana and Tukano narratives about the Tapir-People, or theArawakan peoples living to the north of the Tukanoan. \"From the analysis oftextual sources it seems rather improbable that this [Yuruparí] ritual complexis of Tukanoan origin; it seems rather to have been taken over from the Arawakantribes\" (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1985:113114). Reichel-Dolmatoff's analysis addsfurther support to the assertion that the eastern Tukanoan regional systemcannot be understood in isolation but must be approached from a comparativeperspective that includes a concern for longterm historical patterns of warfare,trade, and intermarriage between eastern Tukanoan and northern Arawakan peoples.Goldman's observation that \"one Cubeo phratry was, in fact, once Arawakan\"(1963: 26) indicates that the \"trading\" between eastern Tukanoan and northernArawakan peoples included not only ritual practices and wives but also entirelanguage groups and phratries. Although it is impossible to pinpoint the precisetime when this integration took place, there is strong ethnographic andhistorical evidence upon which to base some probable hypotheses about when andhow these macroregional ties began to develop.Overview of Wakuénai Ethnohistory: Interethnic Relationswith Colonial andNational PolitiesPrior to the eighteenth century, the Wakuénai were at the center of a vast areaof riverine territories inhabited by northern Arawak-speaking peoples, rangingfrom the Manao along the Lower Rio Negro all the way to the Achagua and Maipurealong the Middle Orinoco and its tributaries (see figute 2). The Upper Rio Negrois strategically situated at the intersection of the two largest river systemsin South America, the Orinoco and the Amazon, a factor that contributed to theemergence of widespread networks of trade and intermarriage."},{"pageContent":"Page 1490149-01.GIF [c486b91c4a94612ed80276947e0263c0.gif]Figure 2.The geographical distribution of Northern Arawakan language groups prior to 1492. Adapted from Key 1979: 74.Interregional networks of trade between the northern Andes, the Caribbean Basin,and the Amazon Basin centered around the Middle Orinoco Basin, where theabundance of turtle eggs and fish during dry-season months brought togetherindigenous peoples from llanos areas to the north and west as well as fromforested areas to the south and east. Radiating outward from the core regionalong the Middle Orinoco were three major chains of trade. To the north andeast, Carib-speaking peoples traded such forest and coastal products asblowguns, arrows, baskets, poison, pigment, and pearls in exchange for quiripa(shell money), turtle oil, smoked fish, gold, and salt (Morey and Morey 1975:18). These predominately Carib-speaking trade networks channeled products fromthe llanos and Middle Orinoco Basin throughout coastal areas of Venezuela, theinterior forests and coastal plains of Guiana, and up into the Antilles. To thewest, Achagua and other Arawak-speaking peoples traded products of the llanosand forest with the Muisca and other Chibcha-speaking peoples of the northernAndes (Rausch 1984: 11). Gold, salt, and cotton cloth were the principal tradegoods obtained from Andean"},{"pageContent":"Page 150peoples (Morey and Morey 1975: 1819). To the south, Saliba- and Arawak-speakingpeoples of the Upper Orinoco and Rio Negro traded forest products, such ascurare poison and resins, in exchange for turtle oil, smoked fish, and shellmoney. Trade networks criss-crossing the northern lowlands centered around theproduction of surplus fish and turtle oil in the Middle Orinoco Basin, but thereis no historical evidence of powerful chiefdoms that dominated this centralregion. Instead, the Middle Orinoco had developed into a zone of interculturaltrade and contact among a variety of linguistically different peoples. \"TheAndean Cordillera, the Upper Orinoco (tropical forest, Amazonia), and Guayanainterconnected themselves with the llanos by means of trade. . . .The commercialrelations with the Andes, the upper Orinoco, and Guayana appear to have passedacross the llanos but not toward the llanos\" (Morey and Morey 1975: 2728,translation mine). Political relations among various indigenous peoples in theMiddle Orinoco Basin consisted of horizontal ties \"in which no one groupdominated the others\" (Biord Castillo 1985: 96, translation mine).It is important to situate the Wakuénai and other remaining northern Arawakanpeoples in the context of this broader, interregional system of trade acrossnorthern South America and the Caribbean Basin. Prior to the traumatic changesof the eighteenth century, northern Arawakan peoples controlled the entirestretch of riverine, tropical forest territories from the central hub of tradingalong the Middle Orinoco River all along the Upper Orinoco, Casiquiare, andUpper Negro and down into the Central Amazon floodplains surrounding Manaus.This macropolitical system of riverine, Arawakan peoples formed one of the threeindigenous centers of northern South America. They were the primary source oftropical forest products to northern Andean and circum-Caribbean chiefdoms aswell as the recipients of gold, salt, textiles, shell money, and other productspassing through the llanos. The Wakuénai phratries of the Upper Rio Negro regionwere strategically situated at the center of the northern Arawakan diaspora andcontrolled the flow of trade goods circulating through the narrow passagesconnecting the Middle Orinoco Basin to the Lower Rio Negro and the CentralAmazon floodplain.Perhaps due to their remote location at the frontier between two expandingempires, the Wakuénai remained numerous during the colonial period at the sametime as Arawak-speaking peoples to the north and south were decimated bydisease, slavery, and warfare. However, after the expulsion of Jesuitmissionaries in 1767, the Portuguese government launched a campaign of forcedrelocations to downstream sites that greatly reduced Arawakan and Tukanoanpeoples living along the Lower Içana and Vaupés (Chernela 1988; Wright 1981;Wright and Hill 1986). Compounding the impact of these forced de-"},{"pageContent":"Page 151scents, or descimentos, was the arrival of successive waves of epidemics of flu,measles, smallpox, and other exogenous diseases in the 1780s. The survivors fledto remote, inaccessible areas at the headwaters of the Içana and Rio Negro(Guainía). Large, permanent settlements along the Lower Vaupés, Içana, and NegroRivers were left totally abandoned for several years.The collapse of the Portuguese colonial government at the end of the eighteenthcentury gave indigenous peoples of the Upper Rio Negro region an opportunity torecover from their losses under the descimento policy. Along the Lower Içana andits tributaries, Wakuénai groups reconstituted their internally ranked phratriesand renewed their subsistence economy of fishing, manioc gardening, and hunting(Wright 1981). The period of recovery lasted well into the nineteenth centurybut came to an end in the 1840s, when the newly independent state of Brazilbegan to implement a policy called the Directorate, which gave localadministrators authority to force indigenous groups to perform \"public servicelabor.\" Resistance to the new policy was met with military force, and in the1850s the program resulted in widespread abuses of indigenous labor.The millenarian movement led by Venancio Camico arose against this background ofhunger and deprivation along the Rio Negro in Venezuela and the abusiveDirectorate policy of public service along the Içana River in Brazil. 5 In 1858Venancio began to prophesy that the world would end in a fiery conflagration onSt. John's Day. Venancio was captured and returned to San Carlos but laterescaped from prison and fled to the Aki River (a tributary of the GuainíaRiver). Although the millenarian movement of 1858 had ended in abrupt militarydefeat, Venancio Camico continued to preach resistance to the whites' economyuntil his death in 1903. By 1900, the shaman-prophet's vision had becomeincorporated into the ritual advice given during male initiation: \"The white menare thieves who buy our wares cheap and sell their merchandise to us at highprices. That is why they are rich and we are poor. Know that the whites are yourenemies. Hide your hatred because it's strong, and treat the whites withdistrust because they are traitors\" (Matos Arvelo 1912: 86, translation mine).Venancio's movement was a historical rite of passage for the Wakuénai, Baniwa,and other Arawak-speaking peoples of the Upper Rio Negro region. The colonialpolitical economy of indebtedness and military force could no longer be regardedas a purely alien power, external to the indigenous social order, but had to beexorcised from within.The first two decades of this century were a period of catastrophic losses oflife and autonomy for indigenous peoples of the Venezuelan Amazon. A rubberbaron turned dictator, Tomas Funes, created a reign of terror in which thousandsof indigenous laborers and their families perished. The Wakuénai,"},{"pageContent":"Page 152whose ancestral lands along the Guainía and Içana Rivers straddled the bordersbetween Venezuela, Colombia, and Brazil, migrated to safety in Brazil or remoteheadwater areas of Colombia.In the post-World War II era, the Rio Guainía was resettled by Wakuénai groupswhose ancestors had fled into Colombian and Brazilian territories to escapeFunes's dictatorship. By the early 1980s, the Wakuénai and Yeral had formedvillages and moved into towns throughout the westernmost areas of the VenezuelanAmazon territory, from Coquí and San Carlos in the south to Puerto Ayacucho andthe llanos in the north.The history of interethnic relations in the Upper Rio Negro is not characterizedby a smooth, progressive incorporation of indigenous Arawakan peoples intocolonial empires or nation-states but by periods of intense change followed byperiods of recovery during which indigenous peoples returned to their ancestrallands to form new alliances. The late eighteenth and late nineteenth centurieswere periods of intense state-level expansion into the Upper Rio Negro and majorirreversible changes to indigenous societies of the region. Each of theseperiods of heightened change was followed by periods of declining state-levelpower that allowed indigenous societies to recover from losses of population,land, and autonomy. It was precisely during these periods of recovery aftermajor, traumatic changes that ethnogenesis flourished in the Upper Rio Negroregion.Some Key Features of an Indigenous Arawakan Model of HistoryWakuénai understandings of the historical and mythic pasts are embodied innarrative discourse and ritual performances of sung and chanted speech, calledmálikai, that instantiate powers of mythic creation and shamanistictransformation. One of the main challenges of developing an indigenous model ofhistory is to find (or invent) a vocabulary of key terms that does not reducethe semantic complexity and poetic musicality of indigenous mythic and ritualdiscourse to a set of soundless abstractions or visual-spatial metaphors.Anthropology and related disciplines have largely failed to develop a vocabularythat is adequate to the task of describing these poetic naming processes intheir full complexity. Paul Friedrich's definition of poetry as \"the symbolicprocess by which the individual mediates between the music of a natural languageand the (nuances of) mythic meaning\" (1986: 39) comes close to capturing thedynamic interactions between musicality and semanticity that pervade Wakuénairitual performances. In my attempts to interpret these verbal performances, Ihave found it useful to relativize, or activate, the interrelations betweenmusicality and mythic meaning by focusing on the relative importance of eithermusicality or semanticity in any specific perfor-"},{"pageContent":"Page 153mance. Mythification is the term I use to denote the process of using semanticcategories of language to constrain the musicality of speech into relativelysteady, tonally and rhythmically stable ways of chanting or singing. Wakuénairitual specialists refer to mythification as \"We heap up the names in a singleplace\" [Wakétaka nakúna papínirítsa], a verbal activity in which a large numberof specific names, or souls, are invoked (i.e., \"heaped up\") within a singlegeneric category of mythic being. Ritual performances of this process are actsof pure signification, social continuity based upon perfect transmission ofmeaning from mythic ancestors to human descendants and the creation ofsocialized individual human beings, or \"persons.\" Through mythification or\"heaping up the names in a single place,\" the Wakuénai poetically construct anidealized concept of the person as a living instantiation of collectively sharedmythic ancestors.Mythification defines the concept of persons at the individual level, but thefull meaning of personhood must allow also for the individual's capacity toactively participate in the historical construction, transformation, andreproduction of the social order. I use the term musicalization to denote theprocess of using dynamic features of musicality to transform semanticclassifications of being into an expanding world of peoples, places, species,and objects, all in perpetual motion. Wakuénai ritual specialists refer to thisprocess as \"We search for the names\" [Wadzúhiakaw nakúna], a musical process ofmoving rapidly through a number of generic categories of mythic being and, atthe same time, \"journeying\" through a number of distinct musical \"places\"(tones, tempos, timbres, rhythms, and volumes). In ritual performances,musicalization embodies the power of communication between persons, or groups ofpeople, to expand and open up the relatively closed, bounded identitiesestablished through language and myth. In myth, musicalization originated in thestruggle between men and women for control over the sacred musical instrumentsof the mythic ancestors. Musicalization transforms social identities throughconstructing and mediating between categories of Otherness, or naturalizedsocial being.The complex interrelations between mythification and musicalization are mostvividly demonstrated in the long sets of málikai songs and chants performedduring male and female initiation rituals. These social events are complex ritesof passage in which chant-owners and other senior kin of the initiantssymbolically construct Kuwái's second mythic creation of the world. Thecollective construction of the world as an expansion, or opening up, is applieddirectly to the transformation of children, who are associated with the mythicprimordium and Kuwái's first mythic creation, into fully socialized adults whoparticipate in the social world of exchange relations between kin groups. A longseries of málikai songs and chants performed over the initiates'"},{"pageContent":"Page 154sacred food (káridzámai) forms the central core of ritual activities for bothmale and female initiations.These performances consist of an opening song, a long series of chants, and aclosing song that musicalize the mythic descent of Kuwái from the sky to theground at Hípana, the horizontal displacement of Amáru and Kuwái across thesurface of the world, the return of Amáru and Kuwái back across the world toHípana, and the return of Kuwái from down on the ground back up to the sky. Themusical, horizontal opening up of the world in initiation rituals creates asociogeographic image of the world of peoples and places occupying an immenseregion of riverine territories. The process begins and ends at Hípana, the placeof mythic emergence and the center, or \"navel,\" of the world, where mythicbeings are linked to the world of human beings via a cosmic umbilical cord(hliépule-kwa dzákare). Between opening and closing songs, a long series ofchants outlines a horizontal journey across the world through the naming ofplaces along the Aiary, Içana, Vaupés, Negro, Atabapo, Orinoco, Guaviare,Inirida, Guainía, and Cuyarí Rivers. In these chants, the Wakuénai musicallyconstruct a mythic map of their world as the center of a much larger region,which corresponds almost exactly to the distribution of the northern, orMaipuran, subfamily of Arawakan languages prior to the colonial period (seefigure 2). The musical naming of places in málikai embodies a historicalconsciousness of a past when the ethnopolitical situation of the Wakuénaidiffered profoundly from that of the present.The horizontal opening up of the world is also directly embodied in theorganization of musical sounds in málikai songs and chants. The opening andclosing performances are sung rather than chanted or spoken, and by making useof exactly the same pitches, the two songs provide a stable, vertical tonalcenter around which the more dynamic chants, or \"journeys,\" gravitate. Musicalmovements between vertically distinct pitches in the opening and closingperformances of málikai poetically construct the mythic space-time of relationsbetween powerful mythic ancestors in the sky-world and their living humandescendants in this world. These vertical musical movements also embody thepower to control movements within human society between developmental stages inthe life cycle and between older and younger generations.Between these two songs, the names of all places and animal species are chantedin a long series of performances that lasts for many hours. Horizontal movement,or displacement from the center of the world, is expressed in a variety ofmusical dimensions. The chants begin on different pitches, and the startingpitch is gradually sharpened through microtonal rising so that the final versesend up on a totally new pitch. The tempo is percussively sounded by strikingkadápu whips on a basket that covers the initiates' sacred food (káridzámai),and the initial tempo is gradually increased during each chant."},{"pageContent":"Page 155The chants also exhibit contrasting dynamics between loud and soft sounds, sincethe principal chanter's voice is doubled at the end of each verse by a secondchanter. From time to time, the chanters' voices are accompanied by a collage ofsounds made on the sacred flutes and trumpets. In short, the musicalization ofmythic power uses tonal variation, microtonal rising, acceleration, andinstrumental heterophony to directly embody the processes of horizontallyjourneying to other places, or becoming other peoples, and back. Musicalizedmythic power is the poetic construction of a historical space-time throughmovements away from and back to the center of mythic and tonal space.An Indigenous Arawakan Model of EthnogenesisThrough the complex of narratives and ritual language outlined above, theWakuénai view themselves as the principal makers and keepers of a sacredregional history which subsumes the origins of the white people and theirculture in the Upper Rio Negro region. The following version of the myth of sibancestor emergence comes from a Dzáwinai chant-owner of the Lower Guainía Riverin Venezuela (Hill, field notes). The bulk of his narrative consists of a simplelisting of Wakuénai sib names and their corresponding male and female tobaccospirits. Excluding the list of names, the narrative is reducible to thefollowing underlying sequence of actions:1. The white men were the first people to emerge from the hole beneath therapids at Hípana, and Iñápirríkuli gave them all a single name (yarinarinai) andtobacco spirit (hérri hálepíwanai iénipe). \"Later we will go to search for thenames [nanáikika] of these people,\" explained the trickster-creator.2. Iñápirríkuli searched for the names of all the Wakuénai sibs and gave themeach a pair of tobacco spirits.3. After giving names and spirits to all the Wakuénai sibs of the Içana andGuainía Rivers, Iñápirríkuli continued to search for the names of Arawakan andTukanoan groups of the Vaupés (Tariano, Wanano, and Cubeo). Although thesegroups formed part of the same search for sib names by Iñápirríkuli, they aredistinguished from Wakuénai sibs by the phrase \"after the white men\" [hnetédaliyárinárinái].4. Iñápirríkuli ran out of names, for \"there were too many people\" [néni ñétimyúhakawa]. \"Let's heap up these people and give them the spirit-name'liwakétanhim dzáwi-ñápirríkuli' (the heap or pile of Iñápirríkuli).\"Iñápirríkuli gave the white men the name yárinárinái, and he named the placeswhere they were to live Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil."},{"pageContent":"Page 156In this narrative, the twin processes of mythification and musicalization inmálikai becomes a means for giving cultural form to an indigenous interpretationof the history of Indian-white relations in the Upper Rio Negro region. Thearrival of the white men is not expressed as a passive experience that \"happenedto\" the Wakuénai but as part of the same active process through whichñápirríkuli, the trickster-creator, brought into being the ancestral spirits ofthe Wakuénai. The trickster-creator raised the white men's ancestors from theground at Hípana before raising the sib ancestors of the Wakuénai and otherindigenous groups, but he did not give the white men powerful sib names thatmust be actively \"searched for.\" Iñápirríkuli announced his intention to searchfor the sib names of the white men later, after searching for those of theWakuénai and their neighbors. As is so often the case in narratives aboutIñápirríkuli, the trickster-creator's words and deeds are in the final analysisshown to be clever deceptions which must be interpreted rather than taken atface value. In the final episode of the narrative, when Iñápirríkuli has run outof names because the white men were too numerous, the real intentions of thetrickster-creator are revealed: to heap up the white men as liwakétanhim (heapor pile) rather than to search for their sib names (nanáikika). This denouementmakes explicit the contrast between higher- and lower-level naming principlesand the analogous contrast between indigenous peoples (hwá nawíki) and the whitemen (yárinárinái). The contrast is not a simple binary opposition of theLévi-Straussian sort (i.e., Indian: white :: dynamic: static) but a continuum ofmore-to-less dynamic.In the concluding episode of the narrative, Iñápirríkuli runs out of namesbecause there are \"too many people,\" and he names the places where the white menare to live: Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil. The indigenous view of historypresupposes smallness of social scale but not rigidity. Sib names for severalindigenous societies of the Upper Rio Negro region are added to Iñápirríkuli'ssearch \"after the white men,\" but the white men themselves are simply toonumerous to include in this mythical process. The trickster-creator does,however, name the places where the white men are to live. Given the centralimportance of spatial movements and the naming of places in Wakuénai ways ofthinking about the past, Iñápirríkuli's naming of white men's places is betterunderstood as a metaphor of the active creation of a historical space-time whichthe Wakuénai have shared with the white men for the past 250 years rather than astatic, atemporal arrangement of space into a mythic order. The division ofWakuénai ancestral lands among Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela was a historicalprocess of great significance to the Wakuénai, for the spatial movements backand forth between river systems has been a key strategy for coping with thewhite men's diseases, economic oppression, military force, and missionaryactivity."},{"pageContent":"Page 157Beyond serving as a metaphorical vehicle for indigenous understanding of theambiguities of power relations that have historically developed betweencolonizing and colonized peoples in the Upper Rio Negro region, the narrative ofmythic ancestral emergence symbolically reformulates the chronological sequenceof major historical periods beginning with the arrival of Western peoples,technologies, and diseases in the eighteenth century. The colonial periodbrought massive social, demographic, and ecological changes to the Upper RioNegro region, and the overwhelming significance of these changes is recognizedin the narrative by placing the whites as the first category of people to emergeat the center of mythic space. At the same time, the narrative gives recognitionto the historical decline of Western colonial power at the end of the eighteenthcentury by explaining that the whites were not given sacred names but ''setaside until a later time.\" In both political and mythic history, the end ofcolonial governments in the region was followed by a period during which thewhite colonizers were \"set aside\" or did not play a significant part in theregions history. This period is elaborated upon in the second and third episodesof the narrative through the trickster-creator's search for the spiritnames ofvarious Arawakan and Tukanoan groups of the Upper Rio Negro region and adjacentportions of the Vaupés Basin. The narrative acts as a historical and mythicexplanation of the coming-into-being of hierarchical, internally rankedpolitical confederations of patrilineal sibs among the Arawakan Wakuénai.Keeping in mind that the metaphor of \"going in search of the names\" refers toprocesses of social and geographic expansion through migration and exchangebetween affinally related groups, it makes sense to interpret these two episodesas an indigenous model of ethnogenesis, or the coming-into-being of the Wakuénaipeoples as a process of recovery and reconstitution in the aftermath of colonialdomination and accompanying losses of population, land, and other resources. Asthe narrative of mythic emergence implies, this process of ethnogenesis includeda reorientation of Arawakan phratries toward neighboring eastern Tukanoanpeoples living along the Vaupés River and its tributaries.It takes only little historical imagination to understand how and why this shiftin regional interethnic relations took place during the early nineteenthcentury. By the end of the eighteenth century, larger, more sedentary riverinegroups of Arawak-speakers, such as the Manao, Baré, Maipure, and Achagua, hadbecome so completely assimilated into colonial systems of mission settlements(called reducciones) that the Arawakan peoples living in the headwater regionsof the Rio Negro were cut off from their former trading partners. Downstreamareas which had been major points of intersection in the vast network ofnorthern Arawakan peoples stretching from Manaus to the Central Orinoco becamecenters of colonial control, epidemics of contagious disease,"},{"pageContent":"Page 158and economic exploitation of indigenous labor. Arawakan peoples of the headwaterregions survived the colonial period by moving farther upstream to moreprotected, remote locations, and this movement brought them into increasinglypermanent contact with the eastern Tukanoan of the Vaupés and its tributaries.The initial movement of Arawakan peoples into Tukanoan areas was almostcertainly a period of interethnic competition and warfare, and these conflictsmay have been the political reason for the historical emergence of rankedphratries among the Wakuénai. With the decline of colonial governments in theregion, competitive pressures eased as many Wakuénai sibs returned to downstreamareas along the Içana and Negro Rivers. Not all Wakuénai sibs returned todownstream areas; some remained in the Vaupés Basin, where they became Tukanoan.If this analysis is correct, then the most probable time that this fusion ofTukanoan and Arawakan peoples took place was the period of recovery fromcolonialism during the early nineteenth century.The period of recovery lasted several decades into the nineteenth century butended with the expansion of the newly independent states of Brazil, Venezuela,and Colombia into the Upper Rio Negro region. In the 1840s and 1850s, theBrazilian government began to implement its Directorate policy, giving moreauthority to local administrators to force indigenous laborers to perform\"public service.\" In Venezuela, Arawakan peoples were increasingly ensnared inexploitative relations of debt peonage with white or mestizo traders. Thesepolitical and economic conditions set the stage for indigenous revitalizationmovements and other forms of resistance that overtly expressed indigenouspeoples' desires to free themselves of the whites' domination. Revitalizationmovements, among other things, made clear the indigenous population's sense ofbeing overloaded by alien political controls and economic exploitation. In thenew context of expanding and competing independent nation-states, the Wakuénaiand their eastern Tukanoan neighbors were becoming increasingly powerless. Thenarrative of mythic ancestral emergence expresses this growing sense ofdisempowerment in the fourth and final episode. \"There were too many people\" and''not enough names,\" so the trickster-creator gave the whites a single name and\"heaped them up\" in one place. In this context, names are not justrepresentations or labels but social identities and the corresponding naturalplaces that the mythic ancestors created for the survival of their livingdescendants. With the rise of independent nation-states and their expansion intothe Upper Rio Negro region in the mid- to late nineteenth century, theindigenous model of ethnogenesis as a process of using language to definedistinct social identities and musicalized language to reproduce, transform, andcreate new identities was overwhelmed. Revitalization movements helpedindigenous peoples to survive"},{"pageContent":"Page 159traumatic changes during the Rubber Boom of the late nineteenth and earlytwentieth centuries, but this second major crisis in Wakuénai history redefinedthe social meaning of the twin processes of mythification and musicalization.After the Rubber Boom the Wakuénai were no longer able to define themselves assimply the living descendants of the mythic ancestors and the affinal allies ofthe Cubeo, Wanano, and other eastern Tukanoan peoples. From the period of theRubber Boom forward, the Wakuénai had also to struggle with their historicaldisempowerment within nation-state systems of political control. By thetwentieth century, the Wakuénai had become the survivors of a holocaust, and thetwin processes of mythification and musicalization had become part of a deadlyserious game of recapturing a viable historical past in the aftermath ofgenocidal oppression and a culture of terror that had destroyed entireindigenous peoples of the Upper Rio Negro region in less than a singlegeneration.ConclusionThe ethnohistory of Northwest Amazonia has taken new directions as researchershave adopted more broadly comparative, regional approaches (Jackson 1983; Hill1985) and as they have experimented with new ways of studying indigenous modelsof history. Our current understanding of the complex social and historicalforces that led to the formation of the Northwest Amazon regions uniqueconfiguration of exogamous language groups and ranked patrilineal phratries willundoubtedly undergo further refinement and revision as new studies continue toappear (e.g., Vidal 1993).Today there is a general consensus that the northern Arawakan phratries of theUpper Rio Negro region formed part of a macroregional diaspora of riverine,Arawak-speaking peoples that spanned the Orinoco and Negro Basins and that wasfully established long before eastern Tukanoan peoples arrived in the VaupésBasin. Through combining the insights of Jackson (1983), Goldman (1963), Wright(1981), Chernela (1983, 1988, 1993), Reichel-Dolmatoff (1985), and myself (1983,1985, 1993), I have concluded that the eastern Tukanoan practice of languagegroup exogamy originated as an adaptation to the historical interrelations withthe set of northern Arawakan phratries who collectively identify themselves asthe \"People of Our Language.\" Language group exogamy can be understood as aneastern Tukanoan strategy of resisting the migratory waves of northern Arawakanphratries by inverting the latter's practice of dividing the language group intoseveral ranked, exogamous phratries. By creating a mirror image of thesesociolinguistic patterns, or the building of ranked phratries through languagegroup exogamy, the eastern Tukanoan constructed a regional boundary that clearlydistanced them from the Wakuénai and that also allowed for a zone ofinterpenetration along the"},{"pageContent":"Page 160northern and eastern borders of the Vaupés Basin. Sustained interethnicrelations between eastern Tukanoan and northern Arawakan peoples most likelybegan in the late colonial period (ca. 17401810), when the external pressures ofdisease, forced labor campaigns, and missionization were driving the Wakuénaiphratries and remnants of downstream peoples to migrate to places of relativesafety in the remote headwater areas of the Vaupés, Içana, and Guainía Rivers.Notes4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 1.Goldman provided a tantalizing bit of evidence that has subsequently turned outto be highly significant when he observed that \"one of the Cubeo phratries was,in fact, once Arawakan\" (1963: 26).4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 2.Only 1 out of 534 marriages in Jackson's sample violated the principle oflanguage group exogamy (1983: 94).4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 3.Simultaneously, Fabian (1983) and other theorists launched major critiques ofstructuralism and other ahistorical theories that removed the subjects ofanthropological research from history.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 4.The edited volume Rethinking History and Myth (Hill 1988) broadened the critiqueof \"cold societies\" to a wide range of indigenous Andean and Amazoniansocieties.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 5.Venancio Camico was an indigenous Baniwa man from the Río Guainía in Venezuela.For a detailed reconstruction of Camico's biography, see Wright and Hill (1986).For interpretations of historical and mythic narratives about Venancio Camico,see Hill and Wright (1988)."},{"pageContent":"Page 161Fighting in a Different WayIndigenous Resistance Through the Alleluia Religion of GuyanaSusan K.

The familiar approach ofisolating within religious practices a dialectic of resistance and accommodationwas recently given depth with the suggestion that revitalization movements mayrespond as much to conflicts among indigenous people as to colonial domination(Brown 1991). Social and ideological differentiation is a commonplace at mosttimes and locations, and so any religion that develops as an ethnogeneticmovement must bring meaning to people following a variety of life strategies. Acentral problem in the study of religious revitalization is to find the means bywhich a religion deals, through its organization and ideology, with the enduringconundrum of unity in the presence of difference, of resistance that toleratesfactionalism.In the following essay I will document the development of the Alleluia religionas an ethnogenetic movement of resistance and discuss the treatment of"},{"pageContent":"Page 163social difference through Alleluia symbolism and performance. Symbolic andperformative considerations are keys to understanding that Alleluia is, for itsadherents, a means of \"poetically constructing a shared understanding of thepast that enables them to understand their present condition as the result oftheir own ways of making history\" (Hill 1992: 811). While reaffirming regionalinterethnic bonds, the followers of Alleluia were obliged to set upon,literally, a \"way of making history,\" an abstract model of the passage ofAmerindian culture through time.To see that Alleluia is rightly considered an ethnogenetic movement, it isnecessary to specify the way it came to mold some aspect of social identity.Many identities vie for importance in daily life in Guyana. The commonlyrecognized social categories in this Land of Six Races are Indo-Guyanese,Afro-Guyanese, Portuguese, Chinese, Amerindian; the final category is generallygiven as either white or mixed. To be Amerindian is to be culturally suspect, toface in ordinary relationships the expectation that one's life choices shouldaugment the development of all native people, an assessment in which, notsurprisingly, sophistication equals fluency in coastal culture.Beyond national models of race, there are a number of ethnic groupings that havetheir greatest influence in the Guyanese interior. The table mountain Roraimamarks not only the triple frontier of Guyana, Venezuela, and Brazil but also thecenter of an ethnically, linguistically, and historically complex group ofindigenous South Americans (Butt Colson 19831984; Thomas 1982). Arawak-speakingWapishana live in the South Rupununi Savannas and Carib-speaking Makushi live inthe North Savannas. Speakers of other Carib dialects include the eponymous Caribnorth of the Pakaraima Mountains, the Pemon, and the Kapon. The Pemon, most ofwhom live in the Gran Sabana to the west of the Kapon, include the Arekuna,Kamarakoto, and Taurepan. Kapon refers to the Akawaio in the Mazaruni Riverregion and the Patamona to the south. In addition to membership in one of theselinguistically distinct groups, people strongly identify with communities on theriver or creek of their birth. Identities based on heritage aside, religion andclass indicators such as literacy, fluency in English, degree of education, andoccupation have considerable divisive force in daily life.The Alleluia religion developed in the mid-nineteenth century among the Makushiand has remained remarkably influential, particularly in many Akawaio andPatamona communities. 2 Some Pemon communities follow the related religiousmovements Chochimuh and San Miguel that developed in the 1950s and 1970s (D.Thomas 1976, 1982). It is not the case that the religion supplies a biogeneticcharter through which Akawaio adherents see themselves as a unique and boundedpeople distinct from, say, Seventh Day Akawaio.

Alleluia followers affirm, through daily worship, a representation of themeaning of Amerindian culture, in the recognized presence of other definitions,through hymns, prayers, and the historical tales that illuminate theirsignificance.Alleluia Culture: A New Tradition for Earth's Last DaysThe heart of Alleluia worship is song. Early in the morning, while everyone liesasleep or dozing in their hammocks, one of the Alleluia leaders begins to singand carries through until sunrise prayers. During the day, people sing Alleluiato purify freshly killed game, request safe passage for travelers, assist in thegrowth of crops, and cure the sick. In keeping with the egalitarian ethos ofmost communities, leaders include both men and women (Forte and Melville 1989;Jordan 1980). The strongest Alleluia followers obtain songs through dreams.Community members learn the short texts quickly, and during services, with theireyes tightly closed or with a hand covering the face in a personal meditation,they sing the hymns in unison over and over. Alleluia songs often speak ofpersonal redemption and the coming destruction of the world.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]Earth-maker God is coming,Mist-maker God is coming.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif[4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif[4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif](Butt 1960: 73)4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]Take me up to heaven, Father,Let me touch my bench there.Take me up to heaven, Father.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif[4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif[4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif](Henfrey 1964: 134)People say that when they sing these songs, they feel great solemnity becausethe performance reveals to them the beauty of heaven, and they are sad that theymust continue their lives of hardship and struggle on earth.

The stories of the divine revelations to prophets reinterpretthe history of missionization so that unequal access to knowledge was reversedthrough immediate contact with God. A summary of Butt Colson's version of theorigin story follows. 34171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] Thefirst Hallelujah prophet, a Makushi named Bichiwung, worked for a white parsonin a mission school. The parson took Bichiwung to England. Bichiwung had learnedsome English, and so he was able to discover that the parson was withholdingGod's words, a source of strength, from him. One day, the whites left him alonein their house to look after their great wealth.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]During this time, Bichiwung decided to meet God and find out if the whites'teachings were true. He set off on the trail to God which the whites had shownhim, and reached heaven. At first, God wouldn't let Bichiwung into heaven, butafter Bichiwung explained his purpose, God gave him a tour. God said that thewhites were deceiving him, and that Hallelujah was good. God gave BichiwungHallelujah, a bottle of white medicine, words and songs, and a piece of paperthat was the Indian Bible. Bichiwung sealed all these things inside a canister.He wanted to stay in heaven, but God refused, as Bichiwung had not yet died. SoBichiwung returned the way he had come. He stopped reading the white man'sBible, knowing that he had got Hallelujah from God on his own (originalemphasis)."},{"pageContent":"Page 1664171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] WhenBichiwung returned to Georgetown, he was met by Makushi friends. He had sent forthem to help him carry back all his wealth. As Bichiwung had directed, they soldparrots, baskets, and other things to get money to buy trade goods.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] Backat his village, he began to teach Hallelujah. His wife, refusing to observe theSabbath, went to work in her gardens. Left at home with his daughter, Bichiwungslept and his spirit went to heaven, and he found Hallelujah there once more.His daughter also slept and went to heaven. His wife returned to a locked doorseveral times and accused her husband of incest. He denied the allegation, andfinally converted her. Bichiwung and his family preached among the Makushi: somebelieved him, and some thought he was a liar. He had several helpers: Plegoman,Enewali, Pratalu, Wakowyamu, and Jesik. Believers prayed all the time until theygot the right words from God.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]Sorcerers became jealous of Bichiwung's plentiful gardens, and one day theyattacked him. Bichiwung died. His wife rubbed his body with the medicine he hadreceived from God and he returned to life. Later, sorcerers killed him and cuthim into two or three pieces. His wife gathered together the pieces andresurrected him with the medicine again. Finally, Bichiwung was killed and cutinto many small pieces. The sorcerors scattered the pieces all around. Becausesome pieces were lost, Bichiwung could not be revived. He died and went toheaven.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]People began to forget what Bichiwung had taught them, mixing up Hallelujahsongs and dances with traditional ones. Then Abel, the founder of AkawaioHallelujah, got good Hallelujah from God and gave it to the people.The negotiation of tensions between inherited and invented tradition is acentral theme in Alleluia origin tales, prompting the question of whether newperspectives on the past implied a repudiation of indigenous cultural practices.Many of the Alleluia prophets, for example, are said to be reformed shamans(piaimen) or kanaimas, indigenous sorcerors who are believed throughout thecircum-Roraima area to be the cause of most deaths. As is commonly the case,piaimen in this area arouse distrust because they have the ability to kill aswell as to cure. While some prophets switched their specialization from piai topreaching, Alleluia leaders generally did not aim to curtail the practice ofindigenous curing. Butt Colson's work in the 1950s indicates that Akawaiofollowers of Alleluia did not abstain from shamanic ritual. She observed that\"all present shamans are believers, and many are enthusiastic adherents, takingpart in church activities and feasts\" (1977: 45). Among the Patamona, Alleluiadances partially replaced shamanic performances, but piaimen still practiced andattended to the local condition of the community along with Alleluia leaders,who sought the ultimate source of"},{"pageContent":"Page 167power (Butt Colson 1971). Indeed, the Alleluia prophet who follows a trail toheaven during dreams retraces the soul flight of a piaiman. Although only a fewpeople in the Mazaruni today would call themselves piaimen, many people know anduse some piai techniques, evidence that the practice has undergonetransformations partially independent of Alleluia. During much of its tenure,then, the Alleluia religion has coexisted with indigenous curing practices.Kanaima violence, a source of terror in the region for decades, seems to be evenmore resilient than shamanism. Kanaimas often act out of jealousy or the desirefor revenge and inflict upon their victims devastating damage to the tongue,anus, and joints that is almost always fatal (im Thurn 1883; Wavell, Butt, andEpton 1966; Whitehead 1990b). This form of violence may be a relatively recentassassination cult that developed in the nineteenth century as a result ofdemographic collapse and diminished Carib leadership (Whitehead 1990b: 166); atany rate, the threat of kanaima attack is a major source of factionalismthroughout the circum-Roraima region. Family histories cycle around a byzantinepattern of kanaima attacks and reprisals. The threat of kanaima attack alsoarises during disagreements on political issues such as strategies for gainingland title. Even if kanaimas threaten society and culture in Alleluia origintales, they are just as much a part of indigenous life today. The religion hasnot limited their activities substantially.The traditional practice that receives more ambiguous treatment in thesenarratives is not kanaima violence or shamanism but the parishara dancefestivals that led to the loss of Alleluia knowledge among the Makushi. ThePatamona, like the Makushi, from whom they learned Alleluia, drank too much in aspree one night and lost the knowledge again (Butt Colson 1971). These parisharafestivals are superficially similar to Alleluia worship: both involve night-longsinging and dancing, and performers are fortified with plenty of cassava drinklike paiwari and cassiri. Although organized festivals are not common, peoplestill sing and enjoy parishara songs; many people find the songs' sexual andnaturalistic imagery wicked but compelling. An Alleluia leader explained,\"They're like Sparrow music,\" comparing parishara to the popular and prurientcompositions of the Calypsonian Mighty Sparrow. Alleluia worship probably tooksome of its performative organization from parishara festivals, and so thecritical issue for followers is the separation of sacred and secular genres andnot a denial of tradition.As can be appreciated from this discussion, the Alleluia religion was not, inintention or in result, concerned primarily with the repudiation of indigenousculture. It does not appear to have addressed factionalism that may have beencaused by shamanic violence, nor did it curb the greatest sources of fear,kanaima attacks. The problems that Alleluia sought to redress were based onbroader social processes."},{"pageContent":"Page 168Historical Beginnings: The Currents of RevitalizationBichiwung's revelatory vision cannot be dated precisely; the earliest traveler'sobservation of Alleluia occurred in 1884, recorded by Sir Everard im Thurn onhis trip to Mount Roraima: ''The Indians around us, under the influence of amost remarkable ecclesiastical mania which had just then spread in a wonderfulway into those distant parts raisedas they kept Christmas with much drinking,without intermission from sunset to the next dawnan absolutely incessant shoutof 'Hallelujah! Hallelujah!'\" (im Thurn 1885: 266, quoted in Butt Colson 1985:107).It was common from the earliest periods of contact for indigenous people to betaken to England as curiosities for the audiences of the conquest. RobertSchomburgk, an explorer and colonial administrator in British Guiana, took aMakushi, a Warrau, and a Paravilhano to England in 1839 (Butt 1960), and so thestory that Bichiwung received his earliest visions and \"got Hallelujah\" inEngland may be literally true. At any rate, Colson accepts im Thurn's suggestionthat Alleluia was new in 1884 and sees this decade as the period of the originof the religion, in contrast to Henfrey, who lists the 1840s as its beginning(1964: 128).What is clear, in spite of these ambiguous beginnings, is that the emergence ofAlleluia was a response to drastically changing interethnic relations in theearly post-Emancipation period. An appreciation of the turbulent interval fromthe 1830s to im Thurn's observations of 1884 suggests that the daily lives ofMakushi and other indigenous people were shaped by the nation-building effortsof several colonial governments. The original followers of Alleluia foundthemselves in a convergence of political collapse, economic restructuring, andinternational border disputes.In the early seventeenth century Dutch settlers in Essequibo, Demerara, andBerbice, the three colonies that made up British Guiana, allied themselves withindigenous people to insure safety and trade for the new colony, just asneighboring Spanish colonies were allied with the Lokono of the Orinoco (Menezes1977; Whitehead 1988). They traded steel implements and cloth for forestproducts and, increasingly, indigenous slaves. By the late seventeenth century,the shift from a subsistence to a plantation economy stimulated the slave tradeand began a major transformation in international and local relationships thatentwined the lives of indigenous and Afro-American peoples. As in otherplantation societies, Maroons proved to be a major problem for the Dutchcolonial government. By 1744, the director-general of Essequibo noted that therewere at least 300 Maroons living in the northwest of Essequibo, and from 1796 to1803 the number of slaves doubled from around 30,000 to 60,000, drasticallyoutnumbering the 10,000 planters (Menezes"},{"pageContent":"Page 1691977: 6, 6 n, 52). As a means of providing regional security, the Dutch adoptedthe twin policies of military recruitment and presentation of annual gifts.Their use of indigenous peoples to capture runaway slaves and to put down slaverebellions involved the Arawak and other groups but was directed primarily atthe Kariña, or \"True Carib,\" whose political and economic position relative toother indigenous peoples was augmented as a result.Near the turn of the century, international power struggles resulted in thetransfer of the three colonies to the British. Although indigenous groupscontinued to protect the plantation system, British authorities proved to bedisappointing partners who were much less trustworthy in their remuneration thanthe Dutch (Menezes 1977: 49). The period of Emancipation, from 1833 to 1838,created intense dissatisfaction and disorganization of indigenous peoples in thecolonies. In 1837, when the return of Maroons was no longer necessary, annualpresents were discontinued. The resulting collapse of Carib dominance coincidedwith decreased interethnic hostilities, which nevertheless became entrenched inindigenous folklore. Farabee (1924: 14) writes that during his expedition earlyin the twentieth century, open warfare had ended, but the Makushi rememberedviolent conflicts with the Wapishana, Carib, and Arekuna. Many indigenous groupswere obliged to find alternative sources of income, especially in the emergingtimber industry. Income was likewise the preeminent issue for the colonialgovernment, which now found itself devoid of productive labor on theplantations. Before new immigration policy brought contract laborers from India,Southeast Asia, and the Portuguese island of Madeira, the administration turnedbrief hopes to the interior as a source of labor. The labor crisis coincidedwith breaches of security in the south.On the eve of Emancipation in 1833, an Anglican missionary named Thomas Youdreported Brazilian slave raids against the Makushi living in the border town ofPirara and was given permission to establish a mission for their protection.Colonial administrators offered their own solution: they set aside crown landsfor Makushi willing to abandon their frontier homelands (Farabee 1967; Riviere19661967). Their goal was clear: by convincing the Makushi to relocate, thecolonial government could establish an easily controlled workforce. The PiraraMakushi declined the offer but did not find peace at home. Slaving continuedthroughout the 1840s and 1850s after Youd's mission failed (Menezes 1977: 157,164). In 1838, for example, the Brazilian militia enslaved a group of Makushi atPirara whom they claimed had been taught false religion and the Englishlanguage. Facing enslavement from the south and spiritual imperialism and thethreat of relocation from the north, the Makushi were surely aware of theirposition as a lever in the struggles of nation building."},{"pageContent":"Page 170Both colonial archives and indigenous oral history record cultural struggleamong the Makushi at Youd's mission. According to colonial records, in themid-1840s, Reverend Youd was confronted by a Makushi man whose sons had stoppeddancing the traditional dances. The confrontation became quite seriousYoud'swife was fatally poisoned, and on his return to England, Youd himself died,perhaps of slow poisoning (Menezes 1977: 219). The same Makushi, indigenousconsultants told Butt Colson (1960: 85, 105), was subsequently struck down bylightning one Sunday while preaching as if he were a minister.This episode testifies to the problematics of religious innovation. Althoughsome Makushi resented Youd's well-intentioned intervention, one of his strongestcritics apparently patterned a new method of worship on Youd's performativetechniques. This proposal received the same fatal verdict as Youd's. Themissions were thus centers of ambivalence. As indigenous people weighed theprospects of religious experimentation against cultural struggle, employmentagainst epidemic disease, it is reasonable to imagine that many approachedreligious instruction as intercultural training, to better allow them to copewith employers and partners. It is little wonder, in any case, that differentactors followed different strategies and adhered to different concepts ofauthentic spiritual experience.It was in this context of economic and political restructuring after theEmancipation that the beginnings of the Alleluia religion can be found. Labormigration and differing evaluations of missionization were likely concerns forthe originators of Alleluia, who may have been stationed at Demerara missiontowns such as Muritaro and nearby timber operations (Butt Colson 1985: 113).Although literary references to Alleluia appear many years later, the ReverendBrett (1868: 180182, 258259) gives evidence of a large revitalization movementduring 1845 and 1846 that anticipates many features of Alleluia. A Caribcatechumen left Brett's Waramuri mission but returned after becomingdisillusioned with the prophet and reported to Brett: \"A person pretending to bethe Lord went into the interior with some deluded followers, and he establishedhimself in the upper part of the Masaruni. From this distant spot, he sentemissaries into the neighborhood of all the missions, calling on the Indians toquit their homes and provision grounds and go to him\" (Brett 1868: 180). Brettemphatically states that no baptized Indians from his mission left permanently,but many went temporarily to Akawaio territory to \"see God.\" Thiscountermissionary movement drew hundreds of followers, no doubt moredisillusioned than deluded, from several Carib-speaking groups and provided themwith spiritual guidance for a year.Brett's terse denunciation offers glimpses of a social movement that prefig-"},{"pageContent":"Page 171ures much of the performance and symbolism of Alleluia. Entire families enteredthe Upper Mazaruni to hear prophecies of the fire and flood that would end theworld; paiwari sustained them as they worshiped through song and dance.Promising times of plenty, the leader offered bananas that thrived withoutcultivation and land on which cassava crops would grow from a single stick. Theleader gave Brett's informant paper documents to distribute, a \"commission frommakonaima, the Almighty, to collect and send to that place all the Indians hecould gather\" (Brett 1868: 259), probably a version of the \"Indian Bible\" thatBichiwung received from God.As he sought to wrest indigenous spirituality from foreign control, the leaderof the 1845 revival affirmed cultural features such as dance and folklorerecognizable to many of the regions ethnolinguistic groups and therefore createdconsciousness of the bonds these groups shared. Such unifying discourses wereambitious correctives to intra- and interethnic factionalism caused by colonialpolicy and developed at a moment when the collapse of the Carib and thecomparative inattention of the colonial government made cross-ethnic alliancesmore viable. This ethnogenetic precursor of Alleluia clearly sought to fosterpolitical and spiritual resistance by focusing on the meanings of Amerindianidentity shared by all groups in the region.\"Aibilibin Would Sing for You\": Resistance and DialogueDespite internal disagreements, false starts, and the eventual adoption of aEuropean signifier for the supreme deity, Alleluia followers have consistentlypresented the religion to travelers, missionaries, and ethnographers as a meansof resisting coastal spiritual influence. Their words, usually recorded inEnglish Creole, speak to the strength of ethnic identity in the face ofgovernmental policies and pressure to adopt the beliefs of Roman Catholic andAnglican Churches and especially Protestant evangelicals like Seventh DayAdventists and Pilgrim's Holiness.This is the case with the earliest evidence. Butt Colson was told that MakushiAlleluia went underground during the 1930s and 1940s as a result ofmissionaries' criticisms (Butt Colson 1985: 139). Similarly, Friar Cary-Elwesvisited the Patamona in 1917 and recorded his conversations with Benjamin, thefirst Patamona prophet.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] Allthe people, he told me, wanted to know the doctrine of Jesus Christ, so thatthey might all go to heaven. He further told me the prayers he said were nothis, he had got them from Amokokupai and accepted them without question . . . weactually chose a site together for the church which I intended to build at mynext visit. But when I took my departure the very next day, Benjamin began towaver. \"You may build your church over there,\" he said,"},{"pageContent":"Page 1724171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] \"butI will continue with my Alleluia church here\" . . . I can see that he isunwilling to act without the Amokokupai people. (Quoted from Cary-Elwes'sunpublished manuscript in Butt Colson 1971: 2930)Benjamin's position suggests a willingness to establish relationships withcoastlanders for intercultural learning and most assuredly economic advantagesbut at the same time to insist that these affiliations be ones of mutuality andnot domination.Patamona followers were again pressured to renounce Alleluia by Pilgrim'sHoliness and Roman Catholic missionaries in the early 1960s. A Patamona Alleluialeader named Henry commented that \"other Patamona people lost it . . . thiswhite priest came from America. He say the people going to burn in the big fireif they keep up with the Hallelujah. That make them so frightened so they leaveoff and take up the white man's Bible . . . But I ain't get so frightened. Thisplace is for the Indians. God give we Hallelujahthe white man ain't supposed totrouble we\" (Henfrey 1964, quoted in Butt Colson 1971: 31).The Akawaio also coped with missionary interference through a combination ofsecrecy and selective disclosure. Colin Henfrey's guide to Amokokupai revealedthat he was an Alleluia leader only at the moment an Alleluia dance started,Henfrey believed, because of his distrust of potential missionaries (Henfrey1965: 70). Some past and present Alleluia leaders say that Alleluia knowledgemust be kept secret from non-Amerindians, but as Aibilibin, the fifth prophet atAmokokupai, told Henfrey, \"Once a priest came here to stop we. He did want tosteal Hallelujah and he vexed that we got it. This thing is for Indian people.But if you come in a right way, if you like this Hallelujah, Aibilibin wouldsing for you\" (1965: 91).Religious accommodation finally became mutual: the Anglicans made a partialrapprochement with the Alleluia Church. Largely owing to the recommendation of aBritish Anglican priest based permanently in the Upper Mazaruni, Father JohnDorman, the Anglican Church held an inquiry on the subject of Alleluia theology(Father C. Roland, personal communication). Father Dorman traveled to Amokokupaito discuss the matter with Aibilibin, and the Anglicans' central concerns(whether the referent of Alleluia's \"Jesus Christ\" was in fact the Christiandeity and the inclusion of a concept of trinity) were answered to the church'ssatisfaction in the affirmative. This inquiry was instrumental in the inclusionof the Alleluia religion in the Guyana Council of Churches.At various times and places (essentially whenever statements about Alleluia wererecorded), the religion was a banner of the cultural distinction of indigenouspeople. The consistent resistance of native peoples suggests that Chris-"},{"pageContent":"Page 173tian signifiers are not evidence of succumbing to the power of the dominantsociety. Clearly aware of their role in the governance of the colonies, of theirhistory of alliance and abandonment, indigenous people may have adopted thesymbol of Jesus Christ as an emblem of membership in a multiethnic regionalculture that had come to include European, Afro-American, and other immigrants.Certainly Christ was one of the only prominent symbols common among themissionaries, hinterland administrators, and timber operators with whom they hadcontact. The concept of a multiethnic society united by cultural symbols andpractices was not new to people of the circum-Roraima and in fact was ofprecolonial provenance. The Amerindian Bible of Alleluia folklore and JohnWinston's baptismal record both index processes through which indigenous peoplerecognize the history that they share with coastlanders without abnegatingcultural identity or waiving the option to resist cultural imperialism.Practice, Poetics, and Performance in a Multiethnic LandscapeThe fact that Alleluia has consistently been presented as a resistance movement,rather than a repudiation of tradition, is insufficient to explain the longevityand tenacity the religion has held in Guyana's hinterland. Just as important,the religion has developed flexible means of creating and describing multiethnicrelationships.It would be incorrect to conclude that the Alleluia religion allowed people totranscend all sources of local conflict. Beyond the competitive forces amongdifferent religions, indigenous people hold a variety of views on culturallegitimacy and development. Many people follow a mixed economy, includingfarming, hunting, and small-scale mining, but many others have come to dependprimarily on employment in the mining industry to purchase expensive foodstuffsimported from the coast. In the Middle Mazaruni, deciding whether to sendchildren away to the few, widely separated primary schools is quite difficultand creates a great deal of dissension over the future of indigenous culture.Accusations of kanaima attacks also disrupt relationships. In this context, theexplanatory functions of a religion are perhaps more cogent than theprogrammatic ones. A religion that sought to limit action in the midst of somany life strategies would likely prove short-lived.During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, communities across thecircum-Roraima took up Alleluia worship. Koch-Grunberg (cited in Butt Colson1985: 107) noted the participation of Arawakan Wapishana along with Carib groupsin a 1911 Alleluia festival. By this time, Alleluia \"missionaries\" had traveledthrough nearby parts of Venezuela and Brazil to bring Alleluia to distantvillages (Narine 1979: 125). Indeed, as Alleluia spread from Makushi to Kaponand Pemon communities, it reaffirmed indigenous"},{"pageContent":"Page 174economic relationships that had existed, perhaps tenuously, since precolonialtimes (Butt Colson 1985). The movement of Alleluia spiritual wealth paralleledthat of material wealth by passing through marriage and exchange links atinterethnic levels, serving to institutionalize awareness of a regionalcommunity. Each June, this community is physically represented at Amokokupaiwhen people from Guyana, Venezuela, and Brazil assemble for the New CropsFestival.As Alleluia developed a multiethnic purview, it was necessary to develop a meansof understanding indigenous life as coherent and unified in spite of linguisticdifferences, geographical breadth, and memories of interethnic conflict. Acommon South American motif for the concept of many-in-one draws upon theregenerative power of domestic plants, a trope especially well suited todescribe the atomistic but flexible social organization of indigenous groups ofthe Guianas. For the Barama River Carib, the vegetative propagation of cassavais iconic of egalitarian social organization (Adams 19831984: 304305). Ofcourse, sustaining social life involves equally the political and the edible:the Kapon, Pemon, and the Ye'kuana regard Mount Roraima as the center of thesocial world, the severed trunk of a tree of life that contributed all theworld's cultivars of fruits and vegetables (Thomas 1982: 33; de Civrieux 1980).It is no coincidence that these images combine in the magically productiveplants possessed by the leader of the Akawaio movement of 1846. Drawing uponspecifically indigenous domains of knowledge, the promise of indigenousindependence through abundant sustenance and social equality was powerfulpolitical commentary.It can be appreciated, then, that the miraculous calabash, bananas, andplantains that Bichiwung obtained from God (Butt 1960: 76) were recognizable asfolkloric shorthand for social unity and independence, a dynamic metaphor forthe reproduction of society. This process is perhaps mirrored in the fate ofBichiwung's body. Kanaimas grew jealous of Bichiwung's exuberantly productivegardens and chopped him to pieces. Having been restored to life twice, his finaldeath occurs when the pieces of his body are too widely scattered to bereclaimed. The dispersion and retrieval of Bichiwung's body teach that socialdifferentiation is not deadly unless it is irreconcilably divisive.The complexities of socially differentiated, multilinguistic landscapes whichhave just begun to be appreciated by anthropologists have not been ignored inAlleluia expressive culture. The multiethnic group of worshipers has itspresence felt in the rules of performance for Alleluia songs. The language ofAlleluia songs and prayers differs slightly from ordinary speech, but textsoften use conventional phrases, making them interpretable to many people.Performers recognize that some songs use a foreign indigenous language;"},{"pageContent":"Page 175Akawaio singers, for example, often know songs in Makushi or Patamona. Thismultilingual repertoire is the legacy of Abel, who fathered the secondgeneration of Alleluia leaders and who was the first to carry Alleluia acrossethnic boundaries:4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]Abel, the first Akawaio prophet, used to be a wicked man. He was a blowmanheblew magical spells on people and made them sick. One night, though, he had adream. He was in heaven and everybody there was singing. The song was sobeautiful that when he woke up, he began to sing it to himself over and overagain. After a while, he forgot it, but later, in another dream, he went toheaven and caught the song again. This time, God told him that he had to keepsinging the song just as he had heard it, in the original language. Abel keptsinging the song just so, and later he got more songs. It was Abel who told usthat we must never translate Alleluia songs into another language when we singthem. (Akawaio Alleluia leader, Staats field notes, 1994)Because indigenous language in the circum-Roraima indexes ethnic group, thediversity of the Alleluia congregation was forged in this episode of Abel'slife. Instead of social fault lines, distinctions between groups appear asstable boundaries in a confederation of multiple language groups sharing mythicand performative cultural features.Both narrative symbolism and performance criteria elaborate views of the passageof social groups and practices through time. The social form that receives themost attention is the reproduction of Alleluia knowledge itself, perhaps becauseAlleluia worship is a totalizing expression of indigenous identity for manyfollowers. More than, say, a blow-by-blow interpretation of historical episodesor an elucidation of religious ideology, Alleluia folklore is highly concernedwith delineating modes of transmission of spiritual knowledge. There are twoindependent and therefore seemingly contradictory pathways through whichprophets \"get Alleluia.\"Through the commemoration of the personalities and interpersonal relationshipsof learning that brought Alleluia from the Makushi to Akawaio and Patamonacommunities, Alleluia leaders recall their intellectual lineage with a precisionreminiscent of the First-Time knowledge of Saramaka historians (Butt Colson1971, 1985; Price 1983). The Makushi Wakowyaming taught Alleluia to the KukuiAkawaio. An Akawaio prophet named John William learned Alleluia from Abel andfrom Poregaman, a Makushi successor to Bichiwung. John William and his youngerbrother succeeded Abel at Amokokupai and subsequently taught Joseph Grant.Alleluia passed from Grant to a leader named Johnny Bai and from him to CasianoAntoniko and so on, in a complex line of inheritance that can be traced tocurrent leaders."},{"pageContent":"Page 176Alleluia prophets recognize a second mode of transmission of knowledge in whicheach prophet obtains songs, dances, plants, and papers directly from God duringdreams. Certainly, this legitimizes Alleluia leaders' authority andsimultaneously renders foreign clergymen superfluous. Divine revelation furtherinsures that Alleluia knowledge, if lost through improper worship, can beregained. But if legitimate spiritual knowledge can only be obtained throughGod, why then should indigenous people consider it necessary to remember acentury-long network of interpersonal learning?Taken together, this dual genealogy of knowledge is a model of culturaltemporality. It represents in a strikingly compact fashion the cogency of bothmythic and historical ways of understanding the past (Hill 1988). The mythicaxis, obtaining Alleluia directly from God, affirms spiritual distinction andthe potentials of the universe open to indigenous people. The historical axisemphasizes agency, the tangible, interpersonal network that brought Alleluiaacross the region. More important, these two modes of inheritance indicate aconvergence of approach between indigenous people and anthropologists inexplaining cultural history: \"cultural realities are always produced in specificsociohistorical contexts . . . it is necessary to account for the processes thatgenerate those contexts in order to account for both the practice of identityand the production of historical schemes\" (Friedman 1992: 837). Alleluia leadershave been on the front lines of intercultural encounters for decades, and the\"practice of identity\" developed in Alleluia culture informs these contexts ofinteraction. The emphasis on process in Alleluia origin tales is a model for thepast and the future, a theory of history that explains the contemporary meaningsof indigenous life.The Upper Mazaruni Hydroelectric ProjectA well-documented case in which the Alleluia religion provided guidance inclaiming a position in national culture was the Upper Mazaruni HydroelectricProject. The homes and livelihood of Akawaio, Arekuna, and Patamona peoples inthe Mazaruni and Potaro districts were threatened in the 1970s and 1980s by theplans of former president Forbes Burnham to develop the hydroelectric potentialof the area (Bennet, Butt Colson, and Wavell 1978; Henningsgaard 1981; Fournier1979). Burnham hoped to secure Guyana's claim to the Essequibo, a resource-richarea that is also claimed by Venezuela (Braveboy-Wagner 1984). Had the planreached completion, the dam would have flooded most of the Akawaio communitiesin the Upper Mazaruni, including Amokokupai. Alleluia leaders were among thestrongest detractors of the plan.In response to this development program, an old man wrote anonymously to ComradeBurnham:"},{"pageContent":"Page 1774171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] Longyears past it was said we would have to fight to keep our lands . . . but now Ipartly understand, that Abel received Alleluia from God, and he told us it is anevil to fight and kill one another for we are all brothers. Only now I try tofight in a different way by writing this letter to you. It is my work to tellyou how we are living on these lands that God has given to us, and to ask thatwe can keep the ways the old people taught us. (Bennet, Butt Colson, and Wayell1978: 9)It is surely a delicate task to choose a persuasive rhetorical strategy thatclaims cultural legitimacy in the face of demeaning, exclusionary coastalstereotypes. The letter writer approaches this problem by adopting a historical,developmental framework. After traveling to heaven to get Alleluia, Abelpreached against interethnic violence. This criticism of warfare must not beread as self-deprecation. The same development that a coastlander may view asrecanting a past identity is, the writer makes clear, a transformation ofinterethnic conflict into resistance. By \"fighting in a different way\" hereforms the coastal image of the \"wild Indian\" into a politically active butethnically and geographically distinct member of the national scene. Hecontinues:4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] I donot like it that teachers tell the children it is best to get more money, getdiamonds and gold, get job. I want to tell you that alleluia has been given toour people as the ways to pray and we know God taught us how to live in peaceand happiness. I do not find that the men with money are able to do this better.I have built my house on the earth and my children are happy around me. I havebuilt our church on the earth and our naked feet have made the earth hard as wedance alleluia. I kneel on the earth to pray. For God has made it good and I amnot ashamed.In this man's powerful assessment, Alleluia is the principle through whichnative people possessed the earth. The religion is the heart of his claim,fundamental to indigenous rights discourses, of prior occupation and culturaldistinction. The author goes on to build up an image of extraordinary stabilitycentered around family and Alleluia worship. He cites the vertical, centeredmovement whereby Alleluia was received from heaven. He is surrounded by hischildren, he builds his church, his feet beat the ground into a solid floor.These sequential images of stability, firmness, and cultural integrity contrastsharply with images of futile movement, the casting-about of capitalistexpansion: \"get more money, get diamonds and gold, get job.\" This authorrecognizes that his life has been transformed by long-term encounters with thecoast, and yet his ability to critique those with whom he shares a culturalhistory is uncompromised.Burnham's administration was unable to raise sufficient funding from in-"},{"pageContent":"Page 178ternational agencies and as a result the Upper Mazaruni Hydroelectric Projectwas never completed. Plans to relocate Akawaio families to the banks of theEssequibo, to be implemented before building the dam, failed as well. People saythat in a vision, Aibilibin had perceived that coastlanders would come to theUpper Mazaruni to flood everybody's homes. He saw that the plan would ultimatelyfail and told the people that they must not leave their homes. They wereencouraged by this prophecy and stayed.Although incomplete, the project nevertheless transformed indigenous livesenormously. In order to remove valuable resources before flooding, coastalminers were permitted to enter the area to prospect for gold and diamonds. Theprevious small-scale prospect and dredges were superseded by more extensivedredging operations that clogged the Mazaruni River channel and led to decreasedfish yields. Many young people found employment in the business and consequentlyacquired the pragmatics of mineral work, alcoholism, and prostitution. Most ofthe coastal miners who entered the area were Afro-Guyanese, primarily becausepost-Emancipation legislation and labor history have rendered this sector of thepopulation quite mobile. In perhaps its most damaging legacy, this policyinflamed the difficult history of relations between indigenous and Afro-Guyanesepeoples and prolonged a centuries-old tactic of bringing these groups intoconflict with each other.ConclusionAlleluia narrative and ritual reinterpreted the devastating experiences of thepost-Emancipation period in British Guiana by strengthening regional ties amongindigenous people. The religion did not repudiate traditional culture but ratherdeveloped a variety of powerful and compelling representations of the distinctbut interconnected ethnolinguistic groups in the circum-Roraima, a vision thatfostered resistance against cultural domination. The temporal relations ofdistinct kin, linguistic, and ethnic groups are a primary preoccupation ofAlleluia expressive culture, and the nature of social dynamics is most formallydeveloped in the dual processes of inheritance of Alleluia knowledge throughlearning and through dreaming. Alleluia cultural temporality is thus bothgeographical and transcendent, a reminder that social integration is compatiblewith cultural autonomy.Notes4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 1.The symbol a: represents a schwa in the original document.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 2.Alleluia has a variety of spellings, including Hallelujah, Aleluia, Aleluya,Areruya.

GussDespite its celebrity as a center for African traditions and colorful festivals,the small town of Curiepe does not often attract many visitors from beyond theborders of Venezuela. So it was with some surprise that the first two people Imet upon arriving for the great San Juan fiesta of 1989 were both Americans, twofreshly tanned twenty-eight-year-old women on a tour of northern Latin America.They had arrived early that morning and were still excited at having witnessedwhat they believed was the inauguration of the festival. I was extremely curiousabout this, as it is common knowledge that this annual, three-day drumcelebration only begins at noon on June 23. But they insisted that it had begunaround nine in the morning in the open space in front of the church. In fact,although there were few spectators, it had been filmed by a television crew fromCaracas. The ''ceremony,\" as they described it, was the reenactment of a slaverebellion. Hacendados and soldiers, in somewhat tacky costumes, had beenoverwhelmed by a group of enraged blacks, who, once vanquishing them, stole offinto the streets beyond.This, the women assured me, was exactly what San Juan was about. The touristagent who had directed them to Curiepe had informed them that the holiday was acelebration of the liberation of the slaves. It was certainly unlike anything Ihad ever witnessed or read about San Juan, so much so that I began to ask peoplein the village what they knew of the events of that morning. Most had no idea,but finally someone in a very amused voice told me that what the two Americanwomen had seen was the filming of the final episode of a TV miniseries entitledLa Iluminada. Far behind schedule, the crew from Canal"},{"pageContent":"Page 181Ocho had desperately been trying to wrap up production before the town succumbedto three days of uncontainable revelry.While I too was amused by the Americans' confusion between a colonial soap operaand a complex religious celebration, events occurring the following year led meto recall this odd scenario and to reconsider its possible meanings. At the samehour on June 23, 1990, a large procession of children entered the plaza andcircled it several times before finally coming to a halt at the bust of SimónBolívar in its center. At the head of this procession was a small boy of twelveor thirteen. He was shirtless but wore light tan pants and typical, campesinosandals. In his hands was a lit torch, symbol of hope, freedom, anduniversality. Behind him marched a girl of the same age, yet she was dressedsmartly, with pleated skirt, blouse, socks, and sneakers, all freshly pressedand white. The contrast between these two images of black history could not havebeen clearer. Now came two more students with the school standard stretchedbetween themUnidad Educativa Estado Trujillo. Behind them marched a large groupof boys dressed identically to the one who led the column. Instead of torches,they carried a large sign constructed of gray cardboard letters attached tosticks. It read \"ABAJO CADENAS\" [down with chains] and was connected, one letterto the next, by a rope simulating bonds. It was obvious that these childrenrepresented slaves, as did the group of girls who followed behind. However, thegirls were dressed in colorful full-length skirts and large white blouses andhad kerchiefs wrapped around their heads. Each one held a different object,indicating the various tasks which female slaves were forced to carry out. Oneheld a bundle of wash, another firewood, and still others baskets of fruit andagricultural products. Behind this group marched the masters, boys dressed incolonial hats and waistcoats, with boots made of cardboard reaching up abovetheir knees. There were also soldiers, and behind them came the rest of theschool. This group, which numbered at least sixty, was divided into three equalparts, each one separated by the color of its shirtsred, yellow, and blue, withseven of the latter pressing white stars against their chests. It was a humanflag of Venezuela.A semicircle was formed around the monument and a wreath carefully laid. Now theprincipal of the school read a statement acknowledging that this was thebicentennial of General José Antonio Paéz, hero of the War of Independence andfirst president of the Republic of Venezuela. However, the statement only spokeof Paéz in passing. Its main focus was Negro Primero, a former slave who earnedhis name by always being the first into battle. It was Negro Primero who whenmortally wounded at the critical Battle of Carabobo went to find Paéz beforedying. When Paéz reprimanded him for leaving his post, he responded with thestatement which every Venezuelan child knows: \"General, vengo a decirle adiós,porque estoy muerto.\" 1 At the end of this"},{"pageContent":"Page 182presentation, which emphasized the contribution of blacks to the struggle forVenezuelan independence, there was a rousing cheer of \"abajo cadenas,\" and thechain and sign were thrown down. Now the procession reformed and, after marchingaround the plaza one more time, headed off in the direction of the school.What did this curious embodiment of history, witnessed by only a handful ofpeople, have to do with the celebration of San Juan, which was still severalhours away from beginning? Or was this enactment actually meant to be abeginning, a preamble added onto the festival in an attempt to redirect itsmeaning? For it had become clear to me, after witnessing several San Juancelebrations in Curiepe, that an attempt was being made to transform thisholiday from a simple celebration of saintly devotion to one of historicalrecuperation, to relocate its center not in a Catholic and European past but inan African and social one. To do so, a host of strategies, both conscious andunconscious, had been employed, not simply in Curiepe but in Afro-Venezuelancommunities throughout the country. As various authors have pointed out in othercontexts, new social and historical realities often lead to a radicalreselection of what a group chooses to remember. 2 Put another way, the mosteffective means of transforming the present may be through the reimagining ofone's past.Similar to the experience of other African-descended populations in theAmericas, those brought as slaves to Venezuela were quickly severed from allethnic, linguistic, and familial ties. Yet it was not simply the possibility ofcreating an autonomous and dignified history that was denied them, for evenafter manumission their cultural and racial identity continued to be erased.Hence, as part of what Mexican philosopher José Vasconcelos termed la razacósmica (the cosmic race), they were merged (at least ideologically) into a newand greater entitya mestizo or criollo one wherein Indian, white, and Africanwere no longer said to be distinguished. This \"myth of racial democracy,\" asWinthrop Wright refers to it in his recent book, Café con Leche: Race, Class,and National Image in Venezuela, created a double-bind situation wherein despiteracial discrimination, blacks were unable to articulate it as the very categoryresponsible, for this oppression was not recognized (Wright 1990: 113).Distinctions, where they did occur, were steadfastly claimed to be the resultnot of race but of class. Complicating this vicious cycle of marginalization andpoverty was the belief that if race did not exist as a recognizable category inthis color-blind society, then all who spoke of it must be either foreign orsubversive. Statements such as the following by writer and philosopher ArturoUslar Pietri typify this commonly held view: \"Whoever speaks of blacks orwhites, whoever invokes racial hatred or privilege, is denying Venezuela. InVenezuela, in political and social matters, there are neither whites"},{"pageContent":"Page 183nor blacks, neither mestizos nor Indians. There are only Venezuelans\" (ElNacional, October 20, 1948, quoted in Wright 1990: 122). 3This pattern of \"nonviolent discrimination,\" as Solaún and Kronus characterizeit, has been recognized in a number of countries, including Brazil, Cuba, theDominican Republic, and Puerto Rico (Wright 1990: 2).4 What may distinguishVenezuela from these other examples, however, are the particular patterns ofsettlement. Unlike Brazil and Cuba, the Africans brought to Venezuela were notfrom any one dominant group. Many in fact were not brought directly from Africabut rather from islands throughout the Caribbean, where they had already beenworking. Furthermore, while slaves began arriving in Venezuela from thebeginning of the 1500s, almost all importation had ceased by 1800.5 This fact isimportant in explaining the greater cultural and historical distance whichVenezuelan blacks have experienced in relation to Africa. Unlike in Cuba andBrazil, where the slave trade continued until nearly the end of the nineteenthcentury, in Venezuela ties were cut much earlier. There are no linguisticmemories, no African \"nations,\" no religious cults like Candomblé or Palo montedrawing blacks closer to a motherland distantly remembered. In Venezuela therecuperation of an African past (as well as a present) has faced particularchallenges. Yet inhabitants of the small cacao- and sugar-growing communitiesdispersed along the coast from Yaracuy and Zulia in the west to Barlovento inthe east have found strategies to reconstitute a past of both dignity andresistance.6Of all the ties still identifiable with an African heritage, none are soimportant in Venezuela as the music and drum traditions incorporated intovarious religious festivals. Although masked within a Catholic liturgy, thechimbangueles, mina, culo e' puya, curbata, and cumaco played at suchcelebrations as San Juan and San Benito can be traced to an origin that isclearly African. It is little surprise, therefore, that these drums have becomethe focus of a movement by many Afro-Venezuelans to recognize the particularplace they have played in their country's history and through this recognitionto begin redressing many of the injustices heretofore ignored. This is not tosay that what began in the small towns of Barlovento in the mid-1970s is simplya black pride movement, insisting on the acknowledgment of the Africancontribution to the national culture; rather, these festivals, with theircultural core of African drumming and dance, have been used as vehicles for thetelling of a new narrative, one in which Africans are not simply victims andslaves but heroes and liberators. It is a story that above all focuses onresistance, with the central character that of the cimarrón. In fact, it is thevery quality of cimarronaje which these local celebrations are now being used tocommemorate.Difficult to translate into English, particularly as the closest word we have,Maroon, is already a Spanish cognate, cimarronaje is the quality or ethos of a"},{"pageContent":"Page 184cimarrón, an escaped slave. In Venezuela, as elsewhere in the New World, escapedslaves, whether in a cumbe, quilombo, palenque, or free village, were a sourceof inspiration for those still in bondage. They represented a refusal to submiteither physically or culturally to the brutalizing institution of slavery. Wheninvoking the concept of cimarronaje today, the Afro-Venezuelan refers not merelyto a past history but to a living tradition still determined to resist thedomination of a European ruling class. It recognizes that black Venezuelansremain marginalized, economically oppressed citizens who must find solutionswithin their own community.Conversely, when elements of Afro-Venezuelan culture have already been absorbedinto this centralized system of power, it is claimed that the community mustcimarronear, or \"cimarronize,\" them, which is to say, they must \"re-Africanize\"them, repositioning both their control and meaning within the society from whichthey were generated. This is precisely what the new directors of many of thesefestivals, such as that of San Juan in the community of Curiepe, were trying todo. They were attempting to cimarronize the festivals by showing their directlinks to an ongoing tradition of autonomy and resistance. As much historicalevents as religious ones, these festivals commemorated the gathering of slavesto organize revolts and plan escapes. Saints and cimarrones suddenly becameblurred, with famous escaped slaves being credited with the origin of varioussongs as well as rites. Just as important, the festivals became the occasion forcommunity organizing and education. From simple celebrations of two to threedays, they were converted into entire \"culture weeks,\" during which panels,musicians, theater groups, school pageants, and even films and book parties allsought to recontextualize the meaning of the event. 7 Programs were alsoprinted, not simply to give participants a schedule of events but to provide theentire celebration with a new statement of purpose. What follows is part of onesuch statement, included in the Culture Week Program for Curiepe's 1979 San Juancelebration:4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif]Curiepe's Culture Week will take place on June 16 to 22, with the purpose ofreturning these drum festivals to their true meaning, which is nothing less thana call to arms of our ancestors in order to transform their society, which is tosay slavery. For that reason, this week is the time to discuss the problemsfacing the population of Barlovento today. It will not only be the presentationof cultural groups with simple artistic goals, but rather a tool of solidarityand discussion for the mechanisms of solution.COMRADEWE INVITE YOU TO PARTICIPATEIN A FULL WEEK OF WORK AND RECREATIONJOIN AND STRUGGLE"},{"pageContent":"Page 185By the mid-1980s many of the leaders in this movement to foment a newAfro-Venezuelan consciousness began to feel that their festival-oriented focuswas perhaps too limited. If it was the African origins and meanings maskedwithin these celebrations they were trying to expose, then why not expand thisdiscussion into an ongoing, daily one? To do so, they proposed an ambitiousprogram of investigation, diffusion, and education. In short, they concludedthat the real cultural work to be done was in the schools. That bastion ofnational ideology must now be breached and a curriculum based on the actualAfro-Venezuelan experience offered. It was with these objectives in mind that agroup of organizers from throughout Barlovento joined together in 1984 to foundCIDOCUB, the Centro de Investigación y Documentación de la Cultura Barloventeña.With Curiepe as a base, they built a library and archive and even helped supporta small museum. Seminars with titles like \"Escuela e identidad regionalbarloventeña,\" \"Existe un pensamiento barloventeño,\" \"Barlovento ante suhistoria,\" and ''El cimarronaje histórico y cultural de Barlovento\" were heldthroughout the region. In addition, special courses were offered to grammar andhigh school teachers, presenting them with materials for a new curriculum basedon the history and culture of the students they were teaching. This attempt todecentralize the educational system was a radical, innovative strategy, yet in1989 it began to find additional support from a very unlikely source, the newlyelected government of the state of Miranda. 8Before this time, each of Venezuela's twenty state governors was appointed bythe president and hence directly responsible to him. But in 1988, a new nationallaw gave the people of each state the power to choose their own leaders, and inMiranda, where the region of Barlovento is located, this resulted in theelection of a man named Arnaldo Arocha from the opposition party COPEI. COPEI, aChristian Democratic Party somewhat to the right of the ruling ADECO governmentof Carlos Andrés Pérez, seems to be an unusual partner in the promotion of aregional, Afrocentric culture and education program, but consider its need toexpand on a chronically limited power base.9 As Tomás Ponce, one of the foundersof CIDOCUB, cynically put it, \"The Copeyanos are a small party. This is a goodway for them to gain popular support. And it's very cheap. Popular culture,cultural promotion, hardly costs anything. It's good value.\" And so theCopeyanos, led by an aggressive director of culture named Pilarica Romero,enlisted the members of CIDOCUB and other organizers from around the state inenacting a program entitled \"Historia de nuestra identidad regional.\"In addition to a comprehensive plan of investigation which would eventuallyenable citizens to rewrite the curriculums for the schools in their owncommunities, an ambitious cultural program was also launched. It called for aseries of concerts and festivals, all of which would focus on the local musical"},{"pageContent":"Page 1860186-01.JPG [10ea17229a24d1e25f1445b835509b24.jpg]Figure 1.\"Ocoyta, primer vuelo de libertad,\" slave uprising.

Several of these were to be broadcast after acomplex series of eliminatory competitions had been held throughout the state.Also to be broadcast was an experimental play, an epic on the subject ofcimarronismo to be performed in Mango de Ocoyta, the actual village where theevents had occurred. An open-air production with the actors selected frommembers of the community, the play was to be based on the life of Barlovento'smost famous cimarrón, Guillermo Rivas, and would be called \"Ocoyta, primer vuelode libertad\" [Ocoyta, first flight of liberty].

Jesús García, author of Africa en Venezuela (1990) as well asa founding member of CIDOCUB, decided to break with the group, claiming that thenew program was inviting the type of intervention they had banded together tocombat.

At that time, Rivas wasacknowledged as one of Barlovento's great unsung heroes or, as was claimed, \"aregional symbol of our history.\" Participants asked why a government whichinvested so much money in erecting monuments to the leaders of the War ofIndependence refused to erect even a single monument to one of the manycimarrones who had been fighting for their independence long before.11 GuillermoRivas was a freedom fighter just like Bolívar, Miranda, or Paéz. The slave of apowerful landowner named Marcos Rivas, Guillermo had escaped in 1769,establishing a cumbe deep inside the mountains of central Barlovento. Beforelong, Ocoyta, as the new cumbe was called, began to attract other cimarrones.Yet unlike other cumbes, this one was not content to exist isolated from therest of colonial Venezuela. Instead, Rivas turned his men into a small guerrillaband. Raiding haciendas and villages throughout the area, they liberated slaves,secured supplies, and, whenever warranted, punished overseers and hacendados.For three years they terrorized the coast, until finally, in November 1771, aspecial army raised with funds from the crown destroyed Ocoyta and killedGuillermo Rivas. As a warning to all future rebels, they cut off his head andone hand and hung them over the entrance to the village of Panaquire (AcostaSaignes 1967: 285296). It was this story which the present inhabitants ofOcoyta, with the assistance of the Dirección de Cultura, now prepared to tell.As part of the state's new program, Pilarica Romero, director of culture, hadhired her own director and crew to write a script and prepare the play.12Many of those who arrived on April 30 to see the play had left Caracas at dawn,traveling for hours in chartered buses or old beat-up Chevies. I had come fromCuriepe with Tomás Ponce and his family. We thought we would be late, but themany people already there were still lined up on both sides of the single mainstreet waiting for the play to begin. In fact, the only activity so far was thefrantic movement of Pilarica Romero and her crew, all of whom wore whiteT-shirts with the words \"Ocoyta, primer vuelo de libertad\" written in red on thefront and a message from the governor on the back:\"La Cultura es lo que unea los Pueblos\"Arnaldo Arocha"},{"pageContent":"Page 189Of course, Pilarica was not wearing one of these shirts but rather a flowingwhite cotton top with an enormous pair of matching harem pants.

Suddenly a helicopter appeared,flew down the main street, and vanished. \"The governor,\" said Tomás Ponce with abig smile. \"It must be the governor.\" Sure enough, ten minutes later a LandRover came roaring down the main street and stopped at the very center. The doorswung open and Arnaldo Arocha, silver-haired and in a cream-colored summer suit,stepped out on the running board and with a bull horn began to speak. Hereminded us of the importance of this event, the need to \"recover, revive, andrevalue,'' and of course the fact that it was his government, that of COPEI,which had come to the aid of the community, had come to support its culture andits history. He spoke of the glories of Miranda and Barlovento and the searchfor meaning through cultural identity. Then he uttered his famous phrase, \"Lacultura es lo que une a los pueblos,\" waved farewell, and drove away. 13Now the rebels took over the town, exploding onto the main street dressed inloincloths and painted like Indians. Wild with rage, they pushed through thecrowds and, breaking through the doors of several homes, dragged a group ofhacendados and their wives out into the street. Once bound, the way slaves hadformerly been, they moved their captives off to the town square, the spectatorsclose behind. There, on a specially prepared stage, they conducted a trial,listing all the crimes the slaveowners had committed against their workers. Fromhere the action moved down to the river, where a replica of the original Ocoytacumbe had been set up. With the actors on one side and the audience on theother, the daily rhythms of cimarrón life were shown. Women washed clothes inthe river, singing and telling stories. Men went off to hunt, prepared game, andtalked of rumors and danger. There were ceremonies and dances, a communal meal,and small bands of children playing in the water with canoes and wooden weapons.All the time, the feeling of a cloud rising over this bucolic scene becamegreater and greater until finally the inevitable happened and a group ofsoldiers burst through the woods and began to fire.This was the third act, or, as it said in the program, estación. It was called\"La destrucción de un Cumbe, el nacimiento de muchos.\" It began with confusionand terror, the screams of women and children, the shots and commands of thesoldiers, the resistance of Guillermo Rivas and his men. Then after a long lull,a figure with his head covered by red cloth was seen crawling up the bed of theriver. This was Rivas, who when he finally arrived at the site of the destroyedcumbe died in the arms of his weeping comrades. Lifting him onto theirshoulders, they carried him in a long procession through all the streets of thevillage. By now it was already dusk, and as we followed solemnly"},{"pageContent":"Page 190behind, it was clear to everyone that Rivas was being borne through the streetsexactly as a saint in a religious celebration.When the procession disappeared, there was a long break until finally the actorsreappeared on the plaza stage for the fourth and final station, \"El Mango deOcoyta, fruta sabrosa y amarga, 1990.\" They had changed their clothes and werenow dressed in simple blue jeans and T-shirts. Sitting on folding chairs linedup across the stage, each actor now spoke one after another. They talked oftheir daily lives, of the poverty and difficulty of their existence. They spokeof the marginalization and oppression they felt as black people and ascampesinos, of the problems in health and education, of the high prices for foodand the low prices for their produce. All the time, they emphasized that theywere the cimarrones of today, the forgotten ones, living in the hills and stillresisting the oppression which had not stopped since the days of GuillermoRivas.It was a powerful moment, but the final applause was quickly interrupted byPilarica Romero, who had leapt onto the stage and was now standing with her armsoutstretched, calling for silence. The last words, like the first, would bethose of her party. \"We have shown that the people of Ocoyta can fulfill whatthey set out to do,\" she said. \"They can complete and carry out whatever theywant to. And with our help, they will. And you can continue to count on thesupport of this government. And on me, Pilarica Romero, personally!\" Then therewas music and everyone danced.Two months later \"Ocoyta, primer vuelo de libertad\" was performed a second timeas the opening act in Curiepe's annual San Juan Culture Week. While it has notappeared on television yet, there is talk of another open-air work, this one tobe based on the life of Juan del Rosario Blanco, captain of the Free BlackMilitia and founder of Curiepe. 14 In the meantime, the \"Historia de nuestraidentidad regional\" program continues to move ahead with the same contradictionsbetween national appropriation and a regionally inspired agenda, between thepopulism that Britto García has called \"the language of domination'' and anauthentic Afro-Venezuelan voice (1990). Yet despite the conflicting interests ofeach group, the story which those in Barlovento wish to tell is indeed startingto be heard. The recovery of a past based not in slavery and suffering butrather in resistance and dignity is being realized with each procession andperformance. Figures such as Guillermo Rivas are being integrated into a newpantheon not simply of Afro-Venezuelan but of national heroes. As the members ofCIDOCUB have claimed, it is time to acknowledge that the great contribution ofAfrican peoples to the Americas is the struggle for freedom, beginning in 1514with the very first rebellion in Puerto Rico (García 1990: 51). It is thecimarrón then who must be respected as the real precursor in the fight forliberty.

Born a slave in the southern plains state of Apure, he originally foughton the side of the Spanish. Upon switching to Paéz's Republican forces in 1816,he quickly rose to the rank of lieutenant in the cavalry. The Battle ofCarabobo, in which Camejo was killed, took place on June 24, the Día de SanJuan, 1821, and was the decisive victory in the War of Independence against theSpanish. As such it is annually celebrated as a national holiday. The 1990ceremony observed in Curiepe's Plaza Bolívar has skillfully collapsed severalpowerful events together, therefore. Not only is it the bicentennial of JoséAntonio Paéz's birth but it is also the anniversary of Negro Primero's death,the end of the War of Independence, and the beginning of a holiday dedicated toAfro-Venezuelan liberation.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 2.The literature on what might be called \"the selective uses of the past\" has beengrowing exponentially over the last several years.

Whitten, Jr.In the mid-1970s I argued for a perspective that could encompass processescalled ethnocide and ethnogenesis. These processes were taken to becomplementary features in systems of radical change. My focus was on the CanelosQuichua people of Amazonian Ecuador who were among the first indigenous peoplein the moist tropics of South America to \"accept\" Christianity (Pierre 1983:188) and who today sustain a rich indigenous cosmology and cosmogony (see, e.g.,Whitten 1976, 1985; Whitten and Whitten 1988, 1993; Sullivan 1988). In the latetwentieth century they are also at the forefront of movements of politicalself-assertion as part of an indigenous nation of native Quichua speakers inideological alliance with all other indigenous nations. Between mid-April andMay 12, 1992, the Canelos Quichua people marched from Amazonian Puyo to AndeanQuito to claim legal rights to ancient indigenous territory. I explore theCaminata, as the march was called by indigenous participants, in a larger workwhich is now in preparation. 1This essay continues my interest in ethnogenesis: the public, historicalemergence of culture (Hill, introduction; Whitten 1996). To express this intechnical language, processes of ethnogenesis subsume both the expansion andcondensation of contrast sets among and between human aggregates. Theseprocesses manifest all of the structural properties of symbols, as set forth byVictor Turner (1973, 1974), including multivocality, condensation,"},{"pageContent":"Page 194associational unification, and polarization. Consciousness of an ethnic-blocformation, as manifest in public discourse focused on us/other (or us/them), isfundamental to ethnogenetic processing of aggregate contrast sets intoculturally meaningful systems of social movement.Ethnogenetic processes are profoundly symbolic and value laden; however weconceive of them, we must always bear in mind that these cultural processes movepeople to action. To come to grips with ethnogenesis in the late twentiethcentury, we must strive for a broad frame of reference that includesnation-state nationalist domination and hegemony, ethnic-bloc nationalism as aculturally constitutive process, strife between peoples over ethnic-bloc agencyof development and survival, processes of counterhegemony, and enduringstructures of racism and racialism. The resulting frame of reference thatencompasses these processes should provide a basis for understandingoppositional processing and patterning of discourse formations and socialmovements. The general purpose of this contribution is to work toward such aframework.The specific purpose of this essay is to explore, in a preliminary way,dimensions of ideologies of interethnicity manifest in racialist discourse andin collective action.

Ecuador is"},{"pageContent":"Page 195now, as it has been since at least the early nineteenth century and perhapssince the sixteenth century, in the ongoing process of social reproduction andcultural transformation of strongly represented ethnic categories that signifysegments of its ever-expanding population (e.g., Salomon 1986; Whitten 1976,1981, 1985, 1986 [1974]). To even begin considering these processes, it isnecessary to sketch the well-known, highly dynamized concepts of indio and negroas set against the national hypostasis of supremacy of the blanco andideological redemption of the middle and lower classes and the \"masses\" throughan elitist imagery of mestizaje.Ecuadorian social structure may be considered as a class pyramid within whichthe siphon economy of center-periphery developmentalist capitalism operates. Anoligarchy, known in the upper classes as la sociedad and internally as gente debién (or genre bién, \"good, proper, right kind of\" and, by extension, righteouspeople), constitutes the pinnacle of political power, economic control, andsocial esteem. The sociedad is complemented by what we might call a paralleloligarchy, or genre de bienes, those whose position is a direct result ofaccumulated wealth. All members of these oligarchies self-identify, and areusually identified unconditionally, as blanco. Ecuador has a significant \"middleclass\" of professional, commercial, and service people who also generallyself-identify as blanco. The ways by which they represent other people depend onvaried contexts and situations. It is from the elite that the concept of aunited body of mixed people, el mestizaje, emanates. 2Further down the class hierarchy we find people dependent for their livelihoodon commercial transactions of varying scale, none of whom self-identify asmestizo, except under exceptional circumstances, but who are politely taggedwith various labels meaning \"mixed\" by those above them or with the labels ofthe antipodesindio, negrowhen discourses reflect interaggregate or interpersonalanger signaling open conflict. Sometimes, under conditions of severe stress,those in superordinate positions use common metonymic associations for theethnic antipode terminologysalvaje, \"savage,\" or alzado, \"out of control\"inheated discussion reflecting social conflict. Upward mobility is conceived of bythose in superordinate positions of power and wealth as a process often calledblanqueamiento, ''whitening,\" in Ecuador, as in Colombia and Venezuela. Withinwhat some call the \"masses\" processes of mestizaje are often called by thevulgar term cholificación in Ecuador, as in Peru and Bolivia.At the real antipodes of class-status relationships are those aggregates ofpeople represented by power wielders as negro, on the one side, and indio, onthe other. I have noted elsewhere (e.g., Whitten 1985) that, in power politics,the endeavor is made by indigenous leaders to move a discourse about the indiopotential for revolt directly into the realm of the status-conscious rheto-"},{"pageContent":"Page 196ric of the oligarchies. Spokesmen and spokeswomen of the negro potential forinsurrection aim their discourse of pending disorder at middle levels of theclass and status hierarchy. When discourses of ethnic \"disorder\" or \"revolt\"reach the mass media all subtleties of ethnic categorization are dropped infavor of condensed, multivocalic, polarized, and associationally unifiedrepresentations of human beings. In this process synthetic symbolic units ofracialist ideology that emerged in the Americas soon after its European\"discovery\"blanco, negro, and indiobring forth a predicative link that carriesthe double act of assertion and denial. I explore this proposition below.An Ethnic-Enacted Sociocultural Event of National and Regional SalienceMy wife, Dorothea Scott Whitten, and I arrived in Quito, Ecuador, Sundayevening, May 27, 1990. We had a research grant from the Wenner-Gren Foundationfor Anthropological Research to study the ethnointerpretation of salientfeatures of Canelos Quichua and Achuar Jivaroan culture in the Amazonian region,and we planned to work through materials suggested to us by indigenous peoplefrom Pastaza Province. On the day of our arrival, Quichuaspeaking indigenouspeople from various Andean provinces occupied the Catholic church of SantoDomingo (built between 1581 and 1650) in the colonial part of Quito. Just beforethe occupation the Instituto Nacional de Patrimonio Cultural del Ecuador, whichuntil recently had its offices across the street from the church, announced thatunder the Plaza Santo Domingo was an ancient indigenous burial site of the firsturban Ecuadorians, those who predated the Inca and took the initial steps towardgenuine indigenous Quiteño urbanity.June and July in Andean Ecuador is a period of intense indigenous festivalactivity. A central feature of indigenous ritual during this period is anongoing, highly stylized (but sometimes violent) battle for the sacred urbanspaces of regional administrative centers (Weismantel 1988; Fine 1991).Additionally, national elections for Congress were upcoming in two weeks, andthe indigenous vote was considered to be critical to the fate of contendingparties throughout the Sierra and Upper Amazonia.When the president of the Republic of Ecuador, Dr. Rodrigo Borja Cevallos,refused to enter into a dialogue with those occupying the church or with theirclerical spokesmen, eleven indigenous protesters (three women and eight men)announced on Saturday, June 2, that they would begin a hunger strike in thechurch on Monday.On Sunday, June 3, Ecuador experienced the first nationwide indigenous uprisingin its history. 3 The uprising itself began about 3:00 A.M. in Salasaca (justeast of Ambato) and had spread throughout the Sierra by late Sunday night. ByMonday morning Riobamba and Latacunga were \"occupied\" by"},{"pageContent":"Page 197indigenous people. Ambato was sealed off, and there was no access by major orminor roads between Coast, Sierra, and Upper Amazonia. Word came on the radio at10:00 A.M. that there was a paro (national strike, standstill) and that thepresident of the Republic would not enter into a dialogue with anyone disruptingnational life. By 7:00 P.M. of the same day the nationwide special news network(La Cadena Nacional) of television and radio announced to all Ecuadorians thataccording to the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador(Confederación de Nacionalidades Indígenas del Ecuador, hereafter CONAIE) aLevantamiento Indígena (indigenous uprising) had begun and was taking place on anational scale. The national television and radio network also announced thatthe president of the Republic would be \"dialoguing\" with the leaders ofindigenous organizations as soon as the \"strikers\" allowed traffic to pass onthe major highways (the Panamerican and its branches to Coast and UpperAmazonia) and left the \"Sacred Quiteño Temple\" (as it was now being called) ofSanto Domingo.By Tuesday things were really getting rough: thirty military and police wereheld hostage by indigenous people in Riobamba; one indigenous leader was shotand killed in Riobamba by the military; haciendas were ransacked throughout theSierra and the southwestern coastal region; hacendados were physically abused ina number of ways (one was held without clothes during the subfreezing night).Part of the Ambato market was sacked by indigenous people. In Upper Amazoniaroad-construction machinery was confiscated, and the only plane to fly that daywas also confiscated. The president of the Republic, who had steadfastly refusedto dialogue with indigenous people up to noon Tuesday, suddenly agreed to anational dialogue to address the sixteen points of the Acuerdo de Sarayacu (theSarayacu agreement) presented to him in 1989 by CONAIE as a condition to resumetransformed relationships between indigenous Ecuadorians and other Ecuadorians.The points had been drawn up initially in a confrontational setting in theAmazonian region and the president of the Republic had not acted on them, oreven mentioned them, for slightly more than a year. These points included (amongothers):1. delivery (surrender) without charge of appropriated land to the indigenousnationalities;2. end of property taxes for indigenous people;3. cancellation of all debts owed by indigenous people;4. a constitutional change to designate Ecuador as a multinational, multiethnicstate;5. federal allocation of funds for the indigenous nationalities to allow them todevelop their own priorities and to carry them through by sustained indigenousagency;"},{"pageContent":"Page 1986. tax- and duty-free import and export for indigenous artisans and artists;7. legalization of indigenous medical and curing practices;8. the placing of all archaeological investigations and the wherewithal to carrythem out in the hands of CONAIE and affiliated indigenous organizations;9. expulsion of the Summer Institute of Linguistics;10. recognition of the Acuerdo de Sarayacu and implementation of the points ofthe acuerdo. 4Discourse Structures, Reference Points, and Interethnic SalienceThroughout our three and a half months in Ecuador in 1990, the most salientfeatures of indigenous discourse involved the Levantamiento Indígena,5 whichcame to be called el alzamiento indio by most of the media commentators and bypolitical analysts. The contrast in terminology is instructive. Whereaslevantamiento carries the meanings of conscious raising and sublimity, and evenrebirth, as well as insurrection, alzamiento means unruly behavior, as well asinsurrection. There is no sense of consciousness in the term alzamiento; loss ofcontrol is implied, and the term may be used for animal behavior. Indigenouspeople perceived in their levantamiento (or, in Quichua, jatari, though it wasin Spanish discourse that the macrocategories were utilized and contrasted) araising of culture to a new level; those using the term alzamiento sawindigenous peoples as \"lowering\" their cultural potential to that bordering onanimality, and they saw and described indigenous behavior as \"like sheep.\" Analzamiento implies that, by definition, the indigenous peoples do not have thecultural potential to engage in a levantamiento; therefore, they are fuera de sulugar, \"out of their proper place,\" or indios alzados, ''unruly Indians.\"For indigenous people the fundamental public pronouncement in the Andes andAmazonia was \"¡Después de 500 años de dominación, autodeterminación indígena en1992!\" [After 500 years of domination, indigenous selfdetermination in 1992!].1992 was chosen as the epitomizing symbol of a raising up, in a cultural as wellas political-economic sense, in clear and confrontational opposition to theelitist rhetoric of the quincentennial celebratory activities to be undertakenin that year to commemorate the European \"discovery\" and conquest of ancientindigenous territory and the establishment of hegemony over contemporaryindigenous people. That territory included, according to indigenous discoursereflecting on recent scientific and humanistic pronouncements, the colonialcenter of Quito, which was also taken to be the precolonial and pre-Incaiccenter of indigenous civilization. As the polarities increased betweennonindigenous ideologues in very active and sus-"},{"pageContent":"Page 199tained public discourse (which was reported daily in newspapers, magazines, andtabloids and on radio and television), black spokesmen and spokeswomen ofEsmeraldas and Carchi Provinces also joined the national debate through thecommunicative vehicle of négritud, a concept developed in the FrancophonicCaribbean and recently adopted by some leaders in the Ecuadorian comunidadesnegras directly from Colombian racialist politics. The term mestizo is not onenormally heard in intraindigenous discourse or in indigenous discourse directedto nonindigenous audiences. But during and after the Levantamiento Indígena itwas commonly used by indigenous and black spokespersons to refer to culturalbarriers to ethnic, social, economic, and political advancement.In the rhetoric of the Levantamiento Indígena, including as it did the centralpostulates of autodeterminación indígena and autogestión indígena, and in therhetoric of négritud, liberación de las comunidades negras, and liberación delpueblo negro, discourses that could be described as racialist continued (andcontinue) to swirl and eddy within the Republic of Ecuador. From nonindigenousand nonblack standpoints, the media and political analysts stepped up therhetoric centering on the conjoined concepts of el problema indio and elproblema negro. As such, commentators on both sides of the escalatingconfrontational discourse presented rich racialist imagery in a paradigmaticway: mention in any context of any of the key racialist signifiers such asblanco, negro, indio, mestizo, among others, automatically evoked imagery of theopposites and the syntagmatic associations with these opposites (see also forbackground Whitten 1981, 1985; Fine 1991; Weismantel 1988).The field of racialist discourse in this modern Latin American nation, in otherwords, became central to both nation-state nationalist discourse and ethnic-blocnationalist discourse, just as the denial of such discourse became located inthe same centralities. For example, the president of the Cámara de Agriculturadel Primer Sector, Ignacio Pérez, said that \"los indígenas están cayendo en elnazismo de la raza pura\" [the indigenes are falling into the Nazism of purerace], to which the president of CONAIE, Cristobal Tapuy, responded, \"Quienhabla de racista es el primer racista\" [he who speaks of racism (racist) is theprimary (or first) racist]. 6Let us consider for a moment the concept of el problema as it is used inEcuador. Mary Weismantel (1988) has recently argued that problema in Ecuadorsuggests the concept elaborated upon by Victor Turner as a cultural \"arena,\"\"the concrete settings in which cultural paradigms become transformed intometaphors and symbols with reference to which political power is mobilized [and]in which there is a trial of strength between influential paradigm bearers\"(1974: 16). \"'Social dramas' represent the phased process of theircontestation.\" A social arena has the following explicit characteristics:"},{"pageContent":"Page 200(1) a framework, a \"setting for antagonistic interaction aimed at arriving at apublicly recognized decision\"; (2) \"an explicit frame; nothing is left merelyimplied\" (Turner 1976: 134); (3) \"a scene for the making of adecision . . . There is a moment of truth when a major decision is made, even ifit is the decision to leave things temporarily undecided\" (Turner 1976: 135).An illustration of this problema as arena within a larger setting of chargedsymbolic fields occurred in the Gold Room (Salón Amarillo, also called theReception Hall) of the National Palace on August 22, 1990. There, in thewellappointed room where foreign diplomats are received by the president, thepresident of the Republic of Ecuador received a planteamiento histórico (adocument in the form of a proposal with the implication of history in the making[Quichua, cayamanda]) from the regional indigenous organization of indigenouspeoples of Pastaza (Organización de Pueblos Indígenas de Pastaza, OPIP).Prior to the meeting with indigenous leaders from Sierra and Upper Amazonia, thepresident had met with his unofficial but very prominent advisor on indigenousaffairs, Alfonso Calderón Cevallos, who then left the building. Then PresidentBorja met with the assembled indigenous leaders. There followed a publicconfrontation carried live on all the national news channels (La CadenaNacional). The president was clearly angry and quite authoritative about aserious legal and political breach that he and his technical advisor onindigenous affairs perceived to be caused by the explicit language of thedocument presented to him.The basis of the perceived indigenous breach of national sovereignty wasespecially evident in the third chapter of the report submitted on theterritorial rights of the Quichua, Shuar, Achuar, and Shiwiar people of PastazaProvince. The key terms singled out were autodeterminación, autogestión, andautonomía of the indigenous people of Pastaza Province, together with theproposition of autogobierno and claim to the wealth of their territory,including all rights to the revenues to be reclaimed from the exploitation ofall subsurface deposits, including petroleum.It appeared that the president, on the righteous nation-state nationalist side,and the Amazonian indigenous people, who seemed to call for an ethnicblocnationalist state in Pastaza Province, were not previously aware of each other'spositions. But a little probing reveals that a key role in this confrontationwas played by Alfonso Calderón Cevallos, first cousin of the president (theirmothers are sisters), informal but highly influential technical advisor to thepresident on indigenous affairs and informal technical advisor to OPIP and theConfederation of Indigenous Peoples of Amazonian Ecuador (CONFENAIE) during thewriting of the indigenous proposal."},{"pageContent":"Page 201Much of the \"indigenous rhetoric\" that so infuriated the president was takendirectly from Calderón's own well-known book, Reflexiones en las culturasorales. 7 Moreover, Alfonso Calderón had been at the confrontational meeting in1989 in Upper Amazonia when the controversial Acuerdo de Sarayacu was drawn up,and he had worked with the president of CONFENAIE, Luis Vargas Canelos, on thevery document presented to the president by OPIP.Prior to his election as president of the Republic of Ecuador, Rodrigo BorjaCevallos had stated in public campaign speeches that the nation-state of Ecuadorwas most clearly one of \"multiple nationalities, multiple cultures, and multipleethnic peoples\" (Serrano 1993). The rhetoric of Ecuador as a multinational,multiethnic state emanated directly from the espoused ideology of thethen-aspiring presidential hopeful, Rodrigo Borja Cevallos. One finds the verysame rhetoric in all five editions of the small but influential book of hisfirst cousin, Alfonso Calderón Cevallos.We can conclude from this that elitist rhetoric (as manifested by Borja at thepresidential pinnacle of power of the ethnically entitled white gente de bién)is not transformable or transferable to the indigenous (or black) antipode ofdiscourse of the indigenous social movements. Borja's own rhetoric could not beused, as the elite and wealthy saw the matter, in the polarized arena whereinindigenous discourse appropriated a paradigm of liberation from the chargedfield of nation-state nationalist political ideology. Borja, prior to hiselection, engaged in a persuasive discourse of ethnic gratuities; hisappropriated rhetoric, as part of ethnogenetic processing by indigenous peoplefrom Amazonian Ecuador, was repulsed with a presidential selfrighteous fury bornin and backed by nation-state power, domination, and hegemony.For their part, the indigenous people from Pastaza Province perceived a seriousbreach within the National Palace, a breach of social contract inscribed in theenduring relationships of kinship and bureaucracy. They had worked on thatcritical chapter with future historic implications for more than two years,grounding it in the principles set forth in Reflexiones en las culturas orales.Indeed, sections of this history-making document are taken word for word fromCalderón's book, with only specific geographic locations inserted.This dramaturgical event of the televised confrontation in the presidential GoldRoom, as an Ecuadorian problema, and the terminal incident reflected in thepresident's public negative reaction to chapter 3 of the planteamiento históricobrought negotiations between indigenous people and representatives of thecentral government to an end. This event and public reaction indicate thatEcuador is characterized by a system of vertical articulation of con-"},{"pageContent":"Page 202flict that complements that of horizontal articulation of conflict. By this Imean that schisms at the highest levels of government ramify systemically tograss-roots sociopolitical movements. In the process of downward ramification,the liberal-leftist rhetoric of ethnogratuities confronts, at the grass-rootsand at the ethnic antipodes, the same symbols. But these symbols move people toaction as an ethnogenetic counterrhetoric, thereby feeding the process ofoppositional processing and contributing to the paradigms that becomeincreasingly rigid in the charged field of racialist discourse.When, it seems, the pinnacle spokesman for nationalist pride, propriety, andrighteousness, the president of the republic, encounters in indigenous discoursethe familiar conflict generated in his own discourse (or that of CalderónCevallos, his cousin and advisor on indigenous affairs) about democratic reformand recognition of multiple nationalities within a nation-state, severe conflictbetween his office and that of the indigenous nationalities is again sparked.The charged fields of cultural paradigms electrifying Ecuador in 1990 thatinfluenced the oppositional processing within clear-cut sociopolitical arenas ofconflict were denied to indigenous people. In turn, it was precisely to thosefields of symbolic- and metaphoric-laden discourse that indigenous peopleturned. The replication of a system of oppositions across the antipodes ofethnic and class awareness in Ecuador in 1990, as in previous years (see Whitten1981) and in the present, continues to motivate systems of ethnogenesis just asit motivates increased forms of domination and hegemony.Ideologies of racialism that spawn such vertical articulation force unendingoppositional processing between the white spokesmen for one nation and theindigenous and black spokesmen and spokeswomen for ethnic freedom. Suchideological forces undergird discourses in many Latin American nations. Suchdiscourses have led to hemispherewide paradigmatic imagery focused on the highlycharged and evocative epitomizing symbol of \"14921992\" (e.g., Rivera Cusicanqui1991).Culture and AgencyBetween 1990 and 1991 the symbol of 1992 and the praxis of the LevantamientoIndígena in Ecuador conjoined discourse structures from the highest level ofEcuadorian society to the dynamic antipodes of blackness and indigenousness. Theprocesses this essay has considered, though illustrated by events in Ecuador,should allow us to think more broadly about indigenous and black autogenous\"uprising\" ongoing throughout the Western Hemisphere. Ideologies of racialismthat have framed discourse in many Latin American nations have led tohemispherewide paradigmatic imagery focused, through 1992, on the highly chargedand evocative epitomizing symbol of 1992. What"},{"pageContent":"Page 203is unfolding subsequent to the passing of 1992, and its internationalprolongation during the 1993 International Year of Indigenous People, is beyondthe scope of this essay. The foci in 1993 changed, but the ethnogeneticprocesses discussed are expressed in myriad public performances and in countlessgenres with common paradigmatic underpinnings.What I would like to do now is reflect on culture, ethnicity, race, domination,hegemony, resistance, and related concepts that emerge in considering the highlycharged epochal epitome of the 1992 \"celebration\" of people throughout theAmericas of the \"discovery\" or \"encounter\" of the New World by Cristóbal Colón.Colón, as the \"Bearer of Christ'' and the \"Admiral of the Ocean Sea,\" insistedto his death that he had arrived in India in 1492. The black and indigenousperspectives on 1492 focused on an epochal event nearly 500 years ago when allnative people were tagged with the image indios with lands to be conquered andcommodified and souls to be appropriated and turned into ecclesiasticalcommodities.The commercial conquest of the Americas itself, stemming from this focalideological event, was undertaken by trafficking in negros bozales (blackbondsmen) from the negrería (black land) brought by negreros (slavers in blackpeople) (see Rout 1976; Hyatt and Nettleford 1995; Forbes 1993; Whitten andTorres 1992, in press). As such, the epitomizing symbol of 1992 signaled apublic, transnational cultural contest between the celebration of Europeanhegemony for the blancos and the spontaneity of a rising up of indigenous andblack people and a raising of indigenous and black cultures with a new imagingof a future for a new millennium.Let us turn again to \"Culture,\" not so much for disciplinary reasons but becauseit is a tremendously important concept to indigenous and black people throughoutthe Americas. Clifford Geertz tells us that \"cultural phenomena should betreated as significative systems posing expositive questions\" (1983: 3). To thislet us add the definition recently deployed effectively by Greg Urban: \"cultureis localized in concrete, publicly accessible signs, the most important of whichare actually occurring instances of discourse\" (1991: 1). So let us begin withcultura. In Spanish, the feminine article la, as in la cultura, elevates theconcept to something refined, European, civilized. When one goes to an expensiveopera in Bogotá, Colombia, for example, wearing fine clothes and speaking in arefined manner, one is participating in la cultura and one is muy culto, verycivilized. The genre de bién (or gente bién), Ecuador's old social oligarchy,regard themselves as \"the most civilized.\" Today, in most Latin Americansocieties, to affix cultura to blackness or Indianness without the article la isto demean traditions and lifeways to something vernacular or popular, worthy ofstudy by folklorists but insignificant in the processes leading to higher andhigher levels of Latin American civilization."},{"pageContent":"Page 204Still worse, cultura indígena or una cultura indígena, cultura negra or unacultura negra is something to be viewed as unrefined, inchoate, confused,fragmented, stagnant, and static. One studies una cultura popular or una culturavernacular to find something of antiquity retained and an enormous amount ofculture lost. During the 1990 Levantamiento Indígena in Ecuador indigenouspeople insisted on the concept of las nacionalidades indígenas (the indigenousnationalities) as the appropriate designation of representation for theircollectivity. In each indigenous language the concept of \"our culture\" (e.g.,ñucanchi yachai, ñaupa yachai in Quichua) is embeddedby a juxtaposition ofsignswithin the Spanish concept of la Nación. La Nación implies culture,sovereignty, and viable territoriality. Las nacionalidades is an older term ofrespect for indigenous cultures (\"high civilizations\") of the Americas.Attributes of las nacionalidades included differentiation of humanity accordingto language and territory; shared status in terms of exploitation beginning,ideologically, with the arrival of Cristóbal Colón in 1492; and a continuousstrain toward hemispherewide indigenous cultural advancement truncated bymestizaje thereafter.A hemispherewide black movement, similar to the indigenous one, began in acentralized fashion at the First Congress of Black Culture in the Americas heldin Cali, Colombia, in 1977 (which I attended) and continued through the FourthCongress held in 1991 in Paris. At all four congresses black people, well awareof the power of racist symbols and stereotypes, insisted (and insist) on thearticle la, as la cultura negra, for black cultures: black, sophisticated,existential, experiential, and adaptableentwined processes of tradition,history, and modernity moving toward higher and higher levels of blackcivilization in the Americas.Geertz's concept of cultural phenomena as something to be treated as\"significative systems posing expositive questions\" can be combined with onederived by the historian Daniel J. Boorstin (1983) that resonates well with theinsistence of Latin American indigenous and black spokesmen and spokeswomen forlas nacionalidades indígenas and la cultura negra: \"'Culture' (from Latin cultusfor 'worship') originally meant reverential homage. Then it came to describe thepractices of cultivating the soil, and later it was extended to the cultivatingand refinement of mind and manners. Finally, by the nineteenth century 'culture'had become a name for the intellectual and aesthetic side of civilization\"(Boorstin 1983: 647, emphasis mine).Indigenous and/or black culture, as I am coming to understand the polarizationof the signification of confrontational discourse, is that which is worthy ofreverential homage by indigenous people and by black people within theircommunities, regions, and nation-states; it is also the means by which the"},{"pageContent":"Page 205cultivation and refinement of mind and manners has been nurtured, developed, andadapted in the New World for nearly 500 years. It is an aesthetic side of theraising of civilization which may be found explicitly or implicitly in anydomain or context of social life. Survival itself, as in the cultivation of thesoil, figuratively and literally, is a critical concept contributing to thesense and reference of indigenous culture (undergirding the concept ofnacionalidades indígenas) and black culture (undergirding the concepts ofnégritud and las comunidades negras).Black culture and indigenous culture, as such concepts are manifest in practicaland spiritual conflict, are characterized by reverential webs of significationthat are illuminating to black people and to indigenous people in any given timeand place, and through them to others who will read, reflect, and think aboutethnic-bloc formations and ethnic transformations and reproductions in settingsof white domination. This concept of culture is also reflected in, andcontributes to, subsistence and commercial survival strategies and is adaptiveto a myriad of structures of domination encountered and overcome in theAmericas.In coming to understand racialist rhetoric in Ecuador and elsewhere, one findsthat the same terminology transcends the polarities in the symbolic fields whereparadigms develop and are elaborated. For the moment, I would like to discusssome relatively invariant postulates of racialist discourse in charged politicalsettings, separating the macrosymbols of \"race\" as they seem to emerge innation-state nationalist discourse and in ethnic-bloc nationalist discourse.Nationalism, Ethnic-Bloc Formation, and Ideologies of Racial CulturesLet us begin with the idea of nation-state nationalism. Although clearly rifewith ambiguity, the term refers to the identity of the majority of people withina nation-state with the republic, nation, or national society as the primaryreference group. A nation-state must, above all else, retain all power ofsovereignty and all power of territoriality. Ideologies of nation-statenationalism are located within the cultural space of nation-state control. InLatin America and the Caribbean in the 1990s we find two complementary and onecompeting nationalist ideology of racial culture, often denoted by one of thesesymbols: racial mixture, Indianism, blackness. I present each of them briefly,by reference to the terms in the language with which they are most commonlyassociated (i.e., négritude, in French, which has become a Spanish term,négritud), but always with a focus on the ways by which they are currently usedas signs and symbols in Spanish.Mestizaje, the ideology of racial intermingling, is an explicit master symbol"},{"pageContent":"Page 206in all Latin American countries. Indigenismo is a dual concept reflecting, onthe one hand, a search for the creative dimensions of nationalism through thesymbolism of an indigenous past and, on the other hand, a sociopoliticalliterarysymbol that conveys the mood of remorse over the living conditions ofcontemporary \"acculturated Indians.\" Both of these meanings seem to run throughAmerican Romanticism and American Realism (e.g., Sacoto 1967). The ideology ofmestizaje embraces both senses of indigenismo (e.g., Bourricaud 1962;Pitt-Rivers 1967, 1973). Indeed, indigenismo may be thought of as a key supportfor the exclusion of contemporary native peoples from nationstate affairs. Arelated component of mestizaje (blanqueamiento) is discussed below because it isnot an explicit component of nationalist ideology.Négritude is a concept that denotes the positive features of blackness amongpeople classed as, or self-identifying as, black. This specific term wasintroduced into French literary usage in 1947 by the black Martiniquan poet AiméCésaire (Coulthard 1962: 58; see especially Trouillot 1990: 124136). It providesa single term by which to assert the positive power inherent in, and thepositive aesthetic forces of, \"blackness,\" leaving many avenues open for thedefinition of what and who is, and what and who is not, to be considered black.Within the Americas only Haiti has adopted an explicit nationalist ideology ofnégritude, and the literary and artistic roots of this concept provide the basisfor Césaire's and others' (such as Frantz Fanon) literary and politicalcreativity (Coulthard 1962: 58.Nationalist ideologies develop not only symbols of internal oneness based onconcepts of racial classification but also ideas of oppositions using thecriterion of \"cultural exaggeration\" as discussed by James Boon (1982). It isperhaps the case that, throughout the Americas, the mestizaje/négritude contrastrepresents a symbolic opposition reflecting cultural exaggeration ofideologically conjoined social constructs of race, civilization, nationalistpatrimony, and social movement. There is, perhaps, no room in explicitnationstate nationalist discourse for autodeterminación étnica or forautogestión étnica except as an elitist political ploy.Let us now turn for a moment from nationalist ideologies with key racialistsymbols to ethnic-bloc nationalist formation. The New Nations program at theUniversity of Chicago turned up information that sustained ethnic-blocnationalist formation characterized the consolidation of nation-statenationalism (Geertz 1973: 234310). An ethnic bloc constitutes a consciousreference group for those who share recurrent processes of self-identification.Ethnic-bloc formation is a political-economic manifestation of culturalethnogenesis. Ethnic blocs, and expressions of ethnic-bloc nationalism, may bebased on any criteria such as common residence, language, tradition, and custom.Indeed, the bases for bloc identity may sort of slip and slide around"},{"pageContent":"Page 207the criteria themselves, as the bloc itself becomes increasingly strong. Theconcept \"bloc\" is taken from politics (as in a political bloc); whatever itsbases, power of identity, power of representation, and power of discoursestructuring are crucial. Such powers come into being when ethnic exclusion takesplace, as when indigenous people or black people are ethnically disfranchisedfrom full participation in the dominant society.Such powers within ethnic blocs also derive from a collective, inner sense ofthe oneness of a people, in contradistinction to nation-state racialisthegemony. The two generative power sources are related, but the nature of such adynamic relationship requires careful, empirical study. Ethnic-bloc nationalistformation may be seen as a process of contra-nation-state nationalism, and thesymbolic processes of ethnic-bloc formation seem similar to, or the same as,those identified as fundamental in processes of nation-state nationalistconsolidation. The relationships created by these generative powers permeate thepolitical-economic fabric of any social order. Ethnic-bloc formation, and henceethnogenesis, in other words, is as international in scope as it is local inorigin.One would anticipate that black-based ethnic-bloc formations would use theideology of négritude and, in so doing, be perceived as a threat to nationalistsovereignty and nationalist territoriality. This certainly seems to be the casein Venezuela, Guyana, and Colombia (e.g., Wright 1990; Williams 1993; Friedemannand Arocha 1995; Wade 1993). In the processes of ethnic-bloc nationalistformation in the Americas, three master symbols of racialist ideology emerge,the latter two of which are potentially complementary: phenotypical, cultural,or ethnic lightening (or whitening); black liberation; and indigenousself-determination.Blanqueamiento refers to the processes of becoming increasingly acceptable tothose classified as and/or self-identified as \"white\" or \"light.\" This is anethnic strategy (however unconscious it may be) now coterminous withsocioeconomic advancement governed by the ideology of \"development\" that dependsupon socioeconomic and political assistance and loans from the developed (i.e.,highly industrialized, high-energy-dependent) countries. Blanqueamientoessentially accepts the implicit hegemonic rhetoric of the United States withregard to white supremacy and often blames those classed as black people andindigenous people for the worsening state of the nation.Ethnic or cultural lightening may occur as an ideological feature among peopleself-identifying as black (e.g., Wade 1993; Williams 1993). One example of theformer would be in nineteenth-century Haitian literary circles, wherein thepositive attributes of blackness (via Egypt and the Sudan) were juxtaposed toFrench civilization. Blanqueamiento, an enduring ethnic-bloc complement to thenationalist ideology of mestizaje, is an ephemeral feature"},{"pageContent":"Page 208of enduring négritude. To the extent that people in the Americas accept, howeverimplicitly, standards of whiteness as attached to \"developmental potential,\" thephenomenon of hegemony may be said to exist.Négritude may express the same sets of meanings in ethnic-bloc rhetoric that itdoes in nation-state rhetoric, as discussed above. Indeed, the Haitianethnologist Jean Price-Mars (1928), during the extended U.S. occupation of Haitifrom 1915 to 1934, conscientiously turned to the voices of Haitians for conceptsof blackness, Africanness, and being Haitian. Price-Mars sought to liberatenationalist ideology from its European Francophonic bases in \"whitening,\" wherethe powerful, literate elite of Haiti saw themselves as mulatto (analogous hereto mestizo; for an extended analysis of such terminology see Trouillot 1990;Whitten and Torres in press). Négritude, and its implicit and explicit cognates,from the writing of Price-Mars (1928) onward, must be considered to have twosenses: in its nationalist sense it may or may not reflect a process oflightening, but in its ethnic-bloc sense it is profoundly populist and rejectingof nonblackness as a criterion for sophisticated self-awareness (see especiallyTrouillot 1990: 124136).Autodeterminación indígena is predicated on the assertion that indigenouspeople, who were deposed and disfranchised by the Euramerican conquest of theAmericas, must articulate to New World nation-states in modern, indigenous wayswhich they themselves will determine. It is a proclamation of indigenoussovereignty and territoriality. Autogestión adds indigenous agency as thecentral ethnogenetic dynamic to sovereignty and territoriality. Thismultivocalic, condensed symbol of liberation (self-determination) specificallylooks to contemporary indigenous cultures in multiple communities and societiesacross the Americas. It rejects the literary-based ideological components ofindigenismo, just as early-twentieth-century ethnographers such as Price-Mars inHaiti and Fernando Ortiz in Cuba turned away from elite academician definitionsof national culture and sought out the voices of the culturally rich black poorin both urban and rural areas. Today indigenous self-determination appeals toblack people in many areas. Négritude and autodeterminación indígena arecomplementary constructs of ethnic-bloc ideology, both of which are contrary tomestizaje as nation-state nationalist ideology and ethnic-bloc nationalistideology (see Whitten and Torres in press).To return to nationalism and racialist ideology for a moment, in thenon-Anglophonic world today, Peru-Ecuador-Colombia-Venezuela, on one side, andHaiti, on the other, constitute polar nationalist opposites. In the formernations the colonial dream of overcoming the barriers of facialistclassification linked to economic opportunities became transformed into anationalist, democratic ideology of racial mixture. In the latter, blacknessinundated a formative New World gene pool to create the first self-liberated"},{"pageContent":"Page 209democratic island republic in the Americas with collective, self-conscious rootsin its African and European past.Structures of DominationNationalism represents, for indigenous and black people in nation-statesgoverned by any racialist ideology, a structure of domination (e.g., Dolgin,Kemnitzer, and Schneider 1977). Structures of domination intensify culturally bysimple rhetorical devices. The first of these is simile. When a person says,\"S/he sure doesn't look like a negro\" [El (ella) no parece como negroide(a)] or\"S/he sure doesn't talk like an Indian\" [Seguro que el (ella) no habla comoindio(a)], a powerful statement has been made that some other people will \"looklike\" someone who \"is\" black or \"talk like'' someone who is \"Indian.\" The \"like\"(como), in other words, signals a conscious or unconscious awareness that thereare agreed-upon commonalities or properties that attach symbolically to thesalient cultural representations of indio and negro. Put another way, thesymbolic denial, by simile, of an individual's adherence to dimensions of aputative racial category is a powerful assertion of the enduring existence ofthe synthetic category itself.Metaphor is the second rhetorical strategy, as when someone says, \"S/he isIndian\"; \"S/he is black\"; \"S/he is a\"; \"S/he is a.\" With metaphor the person,class, aggregate, group, community, or region is tagged with the cognitive andsymbolic associations of a nonwhite or culturally \"darkened\" resemblance. Thesesymbolic associations constitute properties of Indianness and blackness thatconvey meaning. Metaphor concretizes properties that are categorical andprovides the rhetorical wherewithal to all people to label other people withsuch properties, as though physical features, genealogy, and heritage have somereal correspondences among people, representations, and categories. People who\"are\" negro or indio, in other words, are signified by qualities andresemblances that belong to signifiers that stem from racialist and racistcultural constructs. These constructs, to repeat, carry the twin predications ofaffirmation and denial in public discourse.Structures of domination are given form, meaning, and power of repression by therhetorical strategy of reification. Reification occurs when people consciouslyread symbolic, religious, moral, or ideological properties into categoricalsocial relationships, as though these properties actually exist. In a chapter on\"Humanity and Animality,\" Edmund Leach put it this way: \"The naming ofrelationships marks the beginnings of moral sanctions\" (1982: 107). This is theprocess of signification wherein meaning is constructed by strengthening therelationship between the signified (individuals, aggregates, groups, orcategories of people) and the signifier (cognitive and symbolic associationsthat constitute the properties of representations and categories)."},{"pageContent":"Page 210When nation-state nationalist ontology and ideology reify racial mixture notonly as an ideal but as a reality, they create objectifications of outsidership(los otros as opposed to nosotros) among indigenous and black populations withinthe nation-state. People in communities and regions so objectified and morallysanctioned by undesirable attributes self-consciously reflect on suchreifications and attempt to overcome the barriers imposed by racialiststructures of domination. This involves symbolic as well as practical dimensionsof actions of moral inversion in society. The result is a reordering of visionsthat people hold of humanity and spirituality in the world perceived and in theworld imagined. When such actions spark social movements of self-liberation andcultural resistance, they may be said to raise the issue of nation-statenationalist domination to one of transcendentalist ethnic-bloc nationalistformation.In the process of formation and strengthening of structures of domination andthe inevitable forces of resistance to them, we must consider the phenomenon ofhypostasis. This concept, which entered the English language in 1529, literallymeans \"that which stands under\"; that is, a support or foundation (for otherconcepts). If we take structure to be a set of relatively invariant referencepoints that remain after a series of transformations has occurred, hypostatizedstructures are those that are taken to be enduring realities. They arestructures with deep historical underpinnings and supports that unite conceptsof humanity and divinity and separate both from animality (see Leach 1982). Inthe ethnic formation of New World structures of European domination, threerelatively invariant reference points were the categories of the white(European) in superior relationship over the black (African) and the native(\"Indian\").When a structure of dominationsuch as a pyramidal class structure of a givennation-state with white people on top, masses of pluralized mestizo, mulatto,and white people in the middle, and poor, pluralized black, mestizo, andindigenous people on the bottomis assumed to be an unchanging, static reality bypeople at the pinnacle and middle of the structure, then the full power ofbureaucracy is wielded to \"solve the black problem,\" find new ways to overcomethe \"Indian problem,\" and accelerate the processes of mestizaje. While suchsolutions to hypostatized problems are being sought, national, regional, andlocal political, social, and economic resources flow to the top, are partiallyredistributed in the middle, and deprive those on the bottom of the class-ethnichierarchy. This is a process of reproduction of underdevelopment of Fourth Worldpeople in underdeveloping Third World nations and the production of increaseddistance between Third World poverty and First World wealth (see Worsley 1984;Comaroff 1985).Processes of ethnogenesis flow from the structures of oppression and also"},{"pageContent":"Page 211subvert such structures. In the processes of downward flow from elite, blancocontrol, through those represented by upper echelons as striving towardwhiteness, and in the processes of populist and ethnic subversion, the paradigmof blanco, negro, indio, and mestizo that emerged 500 years ago in the Americasis strengthened.Within any given structure of domination, we seem to find that those in powerendeavor to maintain hegemony over those immediately below them by blaming thoseon the bottom (especially ethnically distinct indigenous and black people) forthe lowly \"undeveloped\" condition of regions and communities which can be easilydesignated by reified ethnic terminology. The hypostatized \"reality\" is ofteninscribed in developmental reports, plans, and educational materials and inscholarly publications. At the same time, this symbolic but negativelyconcretized \"reality'' is challenged by powerful, dynamic counterideologies andsocial movements that seek to spark recognition of the falsity of the hypostaticideological racialist structures.Ethnic-bloc formation undertaken under the ideological aegis of négritude and/orautodeterminación indígena strongly illustrates the challenges mounted in thelate twentieth century to false yet hypostatized \"reality\" that has been withthe New World since 1492. No wonder, then, that many black people (and mestizopeople) in Latin America joined their indigenous congeners in the cry, \"¡Despuésde 500 años de dominación, autodeterminación en 1992!\"Processes of LiberationThe Levantamiento Indígena that took place in Ecuador in 1990 may be understood,at least in part, as a process of liberation from structures of domination thatare bundled into the epitomizing symbol of 1492. Understanding processes ofliberation involves us with dominance formations that constitute structures ofpower. Structures of domination and the ways by which class, ethnicity, andpolitical blocs coalesce, change, and are expressed, maintained, and transformedare dynamic and volatile. While hegemony may come into being, it is extremelydifficult to maintain, for people are conscious actors attuned to their lifesituations.When discussing structures of domination I introduced the idea that people aresignified by signifiers as they become parts of categorical webs ofsignification in modern nations. Rhetoric attendant on the EcuadorianLevantamiento Indígena, which rapidly reached the national congress and theoffice of the president of the republic, Dr. Rodrigo Borja Cevallos, contained arich embodiment of enlightened and insightful indigenous representation of theentwined histories, presents, and futures of conquest, domination, andself-liberation. It reminds us of Michael Taussig's phrase, \"From therepresented shall come that which overturns the representation\" (1987: 135).This"},{"pageContent":"Page 212statement relates directly to the idea of people remaking the world and being ina world refashioned from the conquered one that the European \"discovery\" or\"encounter\" of 1492 began.In the concept of the unity of las nacionalidades indígenas, within Ecuador andacross the Americas, one finds the embodiment of the transcendental concept ofbeing indigenous as bound to survival for nearly 500 years. The ultimatetranscendence, or transformation, or cultural metamorphasis, is to reproduce, inan entirely new manner, indigenous unity of the coming twenty-first century.In July 1990, while the president of Ecuador was still engaged in public\"dialogue\" with indigenous spokesmen and spokeswomen, a Pan-Indigenous Congresswas held in Quito. The theme of the congress, which had been established a yearbefore in Bogotá, Colombia, was manifest in its title: Primer EncuentroContinental: 500 Años de Resistencia India (First Continental Encounter: 500Years of Indian Resistance). The unity resulting from the sustained resistancewas expressed as a reuniting of the condor and the eagle, symbolizing the unionof the inner essence of Latin American indigenous spirituality, bound toshamanism, with the outer essence of North American indigenous spirituality,bound to public indigenous ceremony. The key to the unity lies in the collectivesense of indigenous healing of foreign-inflicted illness. The identity of thepower to heal serves as one of many reverential symbols worthy ofmacro-indigenous identity. This is an aesthetic quality that peopleself-identifying with human indigenousness find and appreciate across theboundaries of specific communities, regions, nations, and traditions.Blackness at the Primer Congreso de la Cultura Negra de las ricas in Cali in1977, and at the three subsequent congresses of black culture, also referred(and continues to refer) to that epitomizing symbol worthy of a macro-identityto which communities, regions, and even nations could aspire. Such a referent isalso transcendental; it comes from black people in black communities but it isthe polar opposite of popular culture. In the United States, and elsewhere inthe Americas, the epitomizing symbol of blackness in its transcendentalcharacter is expressed as \"soul.\" This is an aesthetic quality that peopleself-identifying with human blackness and/or with black cultures find andappreciate across the boundaries of specific communities, regions, nations, andtraditions (Whitten and Torres in press).14921992 as Epitomizing SymbolThe tripartite ideological structure of white power and moral righteousness, acoverlet of mestizaje to cloak flagrant racism, and the enduring praxis offorced indio/negro subservience to the church, state, and secular holders ofland and people was established in the early sixteenth century in Europe and"},{"pageContent":"Page 213in the Americas. The epitomizing symbol \"1492\" expresses the inherent evil ofthis foreign hegemony to black and indigenous people in the Western Hemisphere.For a while, the symbol \"1992\" represented the movement to counter this evil, toraise blackness and indigenousness to new counterhegemonic levels of civilizeddiscourse in multiple languages within relatively old modern states. Thesenation-states, of which Ecuador is clearly one, are constituted of complementaryand contradictory ideological processes of transformation and reproduction thatreveal, in their sparked interethnic oppositional rhetoric, a concern withemergent and traditional \"culture\" as sets of structures of conjuncture. Theemergence of cultures within and between these sets fits well the definition ofethnogenesis offered by Hill in his introduction to this book. It is my intentto complement his introduction and the other contributions with this extendedset of reflections and provide a comprehensive fresh beginning to understandcultural processes of ethnogenesis that intensify as the year 2000 approaches.Jean Comaroff (1985: 196; following Hebdige 1979: 17) has put forth a persuasiveperspective which strikes me as especially helpful in understanding theseprocesses. This is the sense that we may continue to understand more and moreabout ideological clashes within and between the structures of conjuncture (anddisjuncture) in history and in ethnography, and especially by their combination,by reference to \"an unending struggle for the possession of the sign\" (myemphasis).Much of the public rhetoric of the Levantamiento Indígena in Ecuador in 1990focused on making 1992 the year when the tragedy of Euramerican conquest wouldbecome transformed into a triumph wherein a new nation of indigenous peoples,including all peoples with indigenous backgrounds and all people who identifiedas indigenous, would regain their lost freedom and assert their cultural andpolitical autonomy.From about 1989 through the first half of 1992 the symbolism of \"14921992:500Years of Resistance!\" in indigenous and black discourse in Ecuador was framed bythe cosmogonic polarities that Lawrence Sullivan (1988) calls the \"Primordium\"and the \"Eschaton.\" These concepts pertain to the prebeginning of everything(the Primordium) and the end of everything, with new life occurring out of death(the Eschaton). Midway through 1992 the public rhetoric of ethnic and classschism shifted from millennial to practical, from cosmic-nationalist(hemispherewide) to local and regional.In Ecuador a shift toward local-level violence occurred wherein indigenous andblack people appropriated land by force, pledged alliance to one another'smovements, and became pitted against one another in an arena of increasinglyviolent local-level political-economic maneuvering by power-wielders."},{"pageContent":"Page 214Nationalist rhetoric as manifest by the public statements by the new president,Sixto Durán Ballén, from August 10, 1992, on has vigorously stressed theideology of mestizaje and the black and indigenous \"problems\" that onlygovernmental agencies (often unspecified) can \"solve.\" The major change innational praxis has been the denial of direct access by indigenous people to thepresident of the republic and to his immediate advisors. Indigenous people,under the regime of Durán Ballén, have become increasingly analogous to theirblack congeners.Current ethnic and class clashes in the Americas define a structure ofconjuncture entailing \"unprecedented objectifications of [ethnic] categories\"(Sahlins 1981: 35) cast in increasingly rigid racialist terms (see also Sahlins1993). Ethnogenetic processes and the discourses that emerge from suchconjunctures provide a profound cultural critique on Western thought. Dimensionsof such a critique have been recently set forth with learned elegance by thecomparative religion specialist Lawrence Sullivan (1988) and by theanthropologist Michael Taussig (1987). In this essay I have endeavored to embeda sense of such a cultural critique within my overall specific theme ofinterethnicity manifest in racialist discourse and in collective action.Acknowledgments and Notes as to ContextThis essay draws, in part, from two collaborative projects and reflects ongoingresearch and interpretation of radical change and pluralist cultural endurancein Ecuador. One of these projects, joint with Arlene Torres, focuses onblackness in Latin America and the Caribbean. For a brief statement of the firstphase of this project, see Whitten and Torres (1992); the larger framework isoffered in our introductions to Whitten and Torres (in press).The second project, joint with Dorothea (Sibby) Scott Whitten, focuses on theEcuadorian cultural continuities and radical changes within a research frameworkthat has developed over a number of years. This framework includes intensivework with indigenous people in Puyo, capital of Pastaza Province (see Whittenand Whitten 1993), and informal but intensive communication with friends andcolleagues in Salasaca, Otavalo, and Quito about the meaning of theLevantamiento Indígena of 1990 and other cognate events. Additionally, Sibby andI have collected whatever public-domain information we could from newspapers,magazines, pamphlets, radio, and television focusing on the LevantamientoIndígena, the Caminata de Puyo a Quito (1992), the symbolism of 14921992 inEcuador, and a myriad of related politicaleconomic, socioeconomic, andideological issues.

Myanalysis applies equally to the Caminata. Indeed, the Caminata manifests manyfeatures far more dramatic than anything known to me to have occurred in theLevantamiento Indígena. The materials on these movements will be combined withother illustrations of processes herein sketched in a larger work, now inprogress. There is no room here to discuss many other highly salient features ofthe Levantamiento, most of which are discussed elsewhere (Almeida et al. 1991;Albán 1993; Bolívar Torres 1993; Comisión por la Defensa de los Derechos Humanos1990; Macas 1991; Rosero 1990; Serrano 1993), often in confrontational manners.Such features include:4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] Therole of Catholic liberation theologists in providing and sustaining an economic,social, political and ideological infrastructure for the Levantamiento.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] Therole of foreign governments, especially European, in providing substantialfunding and infrastructural support for the Levantamiento.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] Therole of foreign governments and revolutionary movements in training people forspecialized roles in the Levantamiento.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] Therole of Ecuadorian political parties and other political forces in supportingspecialized activities by participants in the Levantamiento.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 2.See, for example, Whitten (1981, 1985) and Tomoeda and Millones (1992).4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 3.For a history of local-level indigenous uprisings beginning in the sixteenthcentury, see Newson (1995), Albórnez (1976), Garcés (1961), Oberem (1971), andespecially Santos (1993). Segundo Moreno (1976) wrote his doctoral dissertationon the subject of sublevaciones indígenas in Ecuador's history under thedirection of the late Andeanist-Amazonianist ethnohistorian, archaeologist, andethnographer Udo Oberem. Although many social movements by indigenous people(and by black people) have had repercussions throughout the nation (and,previously, colony), there has never been a nationwide uprising before. Indeed,the Levantamiento of 1990 was probably the most organized movement of people tomake policy in a public arena in all of Ecuador's history. No political movementhas been of this magnitude. In reworking his book for popular consumption afterthe Levantamiento, and in subsequent pronouncements, Moreno has changed from thefocus on sublevación (uprising, rebellion, revolution)the most neutral termavailable for an uprisingto alzamiento, which means, in all social contextsdealing with human beings, people out of control. The concept of \"inferiorhuman\" is part of the concept of alzamiento, for blancos cannot, by definition,be alzado; usually, only indios and negros are so represented. Like hiscolleague Alfonso Calderón Cevallos, Dr. Moreno also worked with both thepresident of the republic and indigenous people to further develop theJanus-like system of vertical articulation that has led to increasedmisunderstanding and conflict across the ethnic antipodes of Ecuadorianmodernization and developmentalism."},{"pageContent":"Page 2174171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 4.There are many renditions of all of the points of the Levantamiento. I give herethose that seem most salient in public discourse from 1990 through the present.Often some points are embedded in others, and some points are elaborated toconstitute several points.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 5.By 1992 the most salient discourse focused on the Caminata. Our discussions andstudies of the Caminata have contributed to our understanding of theLevantamiento. In 1994 another \"uprising\" occurred when the president of therepublic, Sixto Durán Ballén, essentially signed into law a new agrarian programthat would plunge rural people back into the system of peonage from which theagrarian programs of the 1960s promised liberation but provided oppression. Withthe legal specter of any \"businesses\" having the right to move onto subsistenceor fallow land, indigenous and nonindigenous people alike went on strikethroughout much of the Andes and Amazonian regions (but not Imbabura-Carchi) andliterally shut the metropoles (Quito, Latacunga, Ambato, Cuenca) down for aminimum of nine days. The most popular word for the 1994 uprising was \"strike\"(paro) and that of the urban critics, indios revolucionando (Indiansrevolutionizing [i.e., in revolt]).4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 6.Vistazo (September 1990): 78, 79.4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif [4171c183f0430af2edd032c8ee0c318e.gif] 7.Alfonso Calderón Cevallos, Reflexiones en las culturas orales, 4th ed., 1987,5th ed., 1992 (Quito: Abya-Yala)."},{"pageContent":"Page 219Notes on ContributorsPatricia C.
