This paper, as well as questionsfrom colleagues and students and a perusal of cross-cultural cases, made mewonder about the role of water at other centers in the southern Maya lowlands,particularly those located in areas with rivers and lakes. I realized that the levelof reliance on and scale of reservoirs had a significant impact on the degree ofrulers’ political power. The more I delved into research on water issues andMaya rulership, however, the more I also realized that water management isinadequate in and of itself to explain completely the ability of a few to exacttribute from the majority. One only has to look around each Maya center to no-tice a missing piece of the puzzle — monumental public architecture and largeplazas. These settings served as competitive arenas to integrate people throughceremonies and feasts, particularly during the dry season. They also served tohighlight the fact that the average commoner was an active participant and hadsome say in the amount of tribute paid as well as to whom. Commoners werewilling to contribute surplus because rulers offset problems that arose as a re-sult of seasonal vagaries — not enough or too much water.Annual water shortages in the tropical jungles of the southern Maya low-lands dramatically affected the livelihood of the Maya like no other natural re-source shortage. Even in areas where water was plentiful, seasonal water issuesimpacted settlement decisions and agricultural practices. By about 1000 bcMaya had relocated to interior areas away from the major rivers and coastal ar-eas. Pioneers found plentiful fertile agricultural land but not much permanentsurface water. The first farmers had a definite advantage over succeeding gen-erations of immigrating families who needed to farm to support themselves.The first settlers or founders — the earliest elites — did not offer the use of theirland for free. In return for homestead privileges, they demanded, and werePreface00A-T3558-FM 12/20/05 4:41 PM Page ix"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"paid, a percentage of the crops; and new arrivals worked elites’ land, built theirhomes, and provided other services (e.g., as craft specialists). Elites soon orga-nized the construction of small public temples and plazas, where they spon-sored ceremonies and feasts to thank ancestors and gods for providing rain andbountiful crops. This scenario occurred throughout the southern lowlands. Insome areas, however, rulers emerged — why in some areas and not in others?The interior can sustain many people with the major staples of maize, beans,and squash. But the annual 4- to 5-month drought posed challenges to theMaya, especially in areas without lakes and rivers. They met this challenge bybuilding water catchment systems to provide water that would last until therains began again. Elites organized the construction and maintenance of wa-ter retention features. At first they were small-scale. Later they became muchmore complex and larger to supply water to increasingly greater numbers ofpeople. Although there always seemed to be an abundance of land, there neverseemed to be enough water in many areas. Families lived in farmsteads dis-persed throughout the jungle; and rulers had to convince them that it was totheir advantage to supply labor, goods, and services. Many farmers did not nec-essarily have to work for a particular ruler, because they could choose to buildtheir own small-scale water systems or contribute to the coffers of other nearbyrulers. Powerful rulers also arose along rivers. People still relied on reservoirsand other water systems in such settings, and rulers provided capital to repairwater or agricultural systems damaged by heavy rainfall and flooding. In timesof shortages (drought, rain damage) rulers also may have supplied food fromtheir fields, located in several areas to spread the risk, and perhaps allocated water.A major means that rulers used to bring together Maya farmers was tradi-tional rituals writ large, including dedication, ancestor veneration and termina-tion rites, prayers for abundant water, and other household and communityrites. Maya kings also created special rites highlighting their divine qualities;some of these were performed in public venues, and others for a private or re-stricted audience. By sponsoring public rituals, rulers demonstrated their closeties to the supernatural world. They showed people that their affiliations andinfluences with ancestors and deities resulted in plentiful rain and crops. If theywere successful, it was only natural that they should receive some form of pay-ment — labor and goods.The more people kings integrated, the more powerful they became, partic-ularly in areas with plentiful agricultural land and noticeable seasonal vagaries.A long-term drought at the end of the Classic period, however, demonstratedthat rulers had lost their ability to intercede with supernatural forces and failedto bring enough rain. Consequently, farmers looked elsewhere for survival anddiscontinued contributing to political coffers.

I attempt to do so us-ing two factors: water and ritual, specifically short-term and long-term seasonalvagaries and traditional rituals writ large. I illustrate this model by examin-ing the emergence and demise of Classic Maya rulers (ca. ad250 – 950) in thesouthern Maya lowlands. My focus is on the way in which Maya kings usedtheir wealth to offset seasonal problems (e.g., provisioning of dry-season watersupplies) and integrated people by sponsoring large-scale traditional rituals.These factors are crucial in revealing not only how political agents appropriatethe surplus of others but also eventually how such a strategy can fail (Lucero2002a, 2003; cf. Tainter 1988 : 31; see Toynbee 1972 : 223). I concentrate on theLate Classic period (ca. ad550 – 850), when the most powerful Maya rulersarose in areas where they could integrate large numbers of farmers and exacttribute — that is, areas with noticeable seasonal water issues and plentiful agri-cultural land. When seasonal vagaries became more drastic and long-term (de-creasing seasonal rainfall), beginning in the late ad700s, commoners no longerwere obligated to pay tribute to kings who clearly had lost the power to propi-tiate the gods and supply water.While each Maya center has its own particular history, long-term climaticchange set in motion a series of varied, sometimes related, events in the Ter-minal Classic (ca. ad850 – 950) and /or exacerbated local problems (e.g., polit-ical competition and warfare). Basically, the most powerful kings lost power;many secondary rulers followed suit, while others (for a brief time) experiencedwhat it was like to be a primary ruler. Climate change, however, was too dras-tic to support a royal lifestyle for long; soon people largely abandoned theirrulers and civic-ceremonial centers — the heart of royal life. A permanent po-litical vacuum resulted, and it is this fact that needs explaining. In the after-math, there was a major restructuring that focused at the community level.INTRODUCTIONThe Rise and Fall of Classic Maya Rulers00B-T3558-INT 12/20/05 4:41 PM Page 1"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"There the Maya continued to conduct the traditional rites that they always hadperformed.I illustrate the process of how the politically ambitious replicate and expandtraditional rituals as a means to attain and maintain political power using ded-ication, ancestor veneration, and termination rituals. These rites concern life,death, and renewal— factors key in the lives of all Maya. Other rites undoubt-edly were just as important in social and political life, such as community, agri-cultural, water, and other domestic and traditional rites. They are more difficultto identify in the archaeological record, however — community rites take placein open areas and plazas; agricultural rites in fields; water rites at the edge ofaguadas(rain-fed natural sinkholes), reservoirs, and rivers; and so on. In con-trast, dedication, ancestor veneration, and termination rites leave clear evidencein the archaeological record, particularly in structures, consisting of caches,burials, and burned surface deposits. Most rituals likely were replicated and ex-panded by elites to allay conflict in the face of wealth differentiation and laterby political leaders to promote political agendas.To document ancient Maya political histories, I detail ritual histories at mi-nor, secondary, and regional centers before, during, and after the appearance of rulers. The Maya case studies, especially Tikal and Altar de Sacrificios, il-lustrate the ritual process of how rulers initially emerge but do not necessarilyrepresent the earliest southern lowland Maya kings, who likely arose in the Mirador Basin in northern Guatemala (Hansen et al. 2002). The minor rivercenter of Saturday Creek (another case study) did not have rulers, but its in-habitants conducted the same rites as did those Maya beholden to rulers; thispattern indicates that appropriated rites have a long history (before rulers) andthat they never left the home (during rulers).Before focusing on the Maya, I begin by presenting a general model that ar-ticulates the critical role of water and ritual in political systems. Political poweris defined here as the ability to exact tribute in the form of surplus goods andlabor. Whatever the route to political complexity, a material basis is required tosupport it, and ritual is key to explaining it. The amount of surplus available toleaders relates to where and how people live. Basically, densely settled peopleare more easily integrated, whereas dispersed people are less so. My intent is toshow the process of how people get other people to contribute to their politicalcoffers, step by step. Rulers need not own critical resources or even control theiraccess per se. What they do need to provide, however, is water during drought,food during famine, and capital to rebuild water or agricultural systems dam-aged, for example, by flooding. They also need to have the wealth or means toperform the necessary rites of continuance and plenty. When agricultural re-gimes yield less food for whatever reasons, people abandon their leaders, whoserituals have failed to bring forth prosperity.2Water and Ritual00B-T3558-INT 12/20/05 4:41 PM Page 2"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Chapter 1 presents the major factors used to distinguish different politicalsystems (community, local polities, and centralized and integrative polities) toprovide a backdrop for the political model with ritual at its core.

Specifically,how do a few people get others to contribute their labor, goods, and serviceswithout compensating them equally? My definition of political power reflectsthe focus on surplus appropriation, and therefore my perspective is necessarilymaterialist. Thus, I view resources as a condition for, not a cause of, politicalcomplexity (cf. Fried 1967 : 111; Russell 1938 : 31) and focus on the way people in-teract with their natural and social surroundings. My approach is not environ-mentally deterministic but acknowledges the key role that resources play in sur-plus production, especially rainfall dependency and the degree to which peoplerely on water or agricultural systems. Long-term climate change (e.g., rainy sea-sons begin later than usual or are shorter than usual, temperatures drop slightly,and so on) has various, and sometimes drastic, impacts on agricultural and po-litical systems (see Fagan 1999, 2004). After all, no matter how unique peopleare in terms of how they think, act, and create, they still need to survive and interact with the material and social world. The way in which surplus is ap-propriated, however, is another matter; and this is where the role of ritual iscrucial.I discuss water (especially seasonal vagaries) and ritual separately, because toappreciate the whole we must first understand its constituent parts. In doing so,individual factors can only appear as static entities. Nevertheless, my goal by theend of this work is to discuss them as an integrated, dialectical, and dynamicsystem. Edmund Leach (1970 [1954] : 63; emphasis in original) said it best when01-T3558 12/20/05 4:41 PM Page 5"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"6Water and Ritualhe explained the challenges of detailing structural change betweengumsaandgumlaoorganization in highland Burma:I assume that the system of variation as we now observe it hasnostabilitythrough time. What can be observed now is just a momentary configuration of a totality existing in a state of flux. Yet I agree that in order to describe thistotality it is necessary to represent the systemas ifit were stable and coherent.This being said, it is important to acknowledge that the model presenteddoes not and cannot account for all the varied political histories; instead, I at-tempt to provide an idealized general organizational framework from which toevaluate under what material and social conditions political leadership developsand fails. The defining traits of each political type are not static and imper-meable; they are fluid and part of a continuum and only a heuristic device. Theuse of types is simply an attempt to separate the constituent parts of complexand dynamic systems (see Klejn 1982 : 17, 52). My goal also is to avoid the bag-gage that usually comes with using traditional terminology that implies stagesthrough which all societies must pass in the drive toward complexity (such astribes, simple chiefdoms, complex chiefdoms, and states). The systems I de-scribe thus can be viewed synchronically (nested hierarchies), diachronically(changing political histories), or as separate entities (autonomous); differentpolitical systems can apply to societies in different times and places or to asingle culture during a specific period. In the Maya case, various southern low-land centers are evaluated either as separate polities or as nested hierarchiesduring the Late Classic period.People interact with natural and social forces in various ways, resulting invaried political histories. Given that there are a limited number of responses(Friedman and Rowlands 1978), however, similar processes must be at work(Earle 1997 : 193). The model thus provides a useful construct to illuminate theinner mechanisms of political systems and how they emerge, expand, and fail.There is no doubt that many types of relations can and do exist within so-cial systems (e.g., kinship, alliance, marriage); here I focus specifically on howseasonal water issues and ritual bear on political systems. Finally, while thecross-cultural case studies that I use to illustrate the varied political systems arewell known, what is different is the way in which I discuss and situate them.In this chapter I introduce the different types of political systems (commu-nity, local, and centralized and integrative polities) and the factors that distin-guish them. I then detail the step-by-step process of how rulers emerge and thecrucial role that ritual plays in their rise, maintenance, and loss of power.

Finally, Idiscuss ritual and collapse and present a scenario illustrating a political history.Political SystemsThe distribution of critical resources affects how people settle across land-scapes, which in turn bears on the ability of aspiring leaders to communicateideas and to conduct large-scale activities (political rallies, feasts, and workparties) (Roscoe 1993). Densely settled areas where people are tied to the landthrough investments in subsistence technology (e.g., plowed fields, canals, dams,agricultural terraces, fish ponds, transportation, storage buildings) facilitate theconsolidation of power (Carneiro 1970; Gilman 1981; Hayden 1995), becausepolitical aspirants can more easily access critical resources and surplus (Earle1997 : 7). Dispersed populations that rely on scattered resources are more diffi-cult to organize, regardless of surplus potential. Aspiring leaders thus need tobring people together physically, and they accomplish this through funding andconducting integrative events and providing some type of material benefit. Po-litical demands (e.g., corvée labor), however, are superimposed onto existingeconomic and social institutions that may or may not be affected by the waxingand waning of political power.Surplus funds the political economy. Without it everyone would be con-cerned only with household and community obligations. This scenario wouldnot leave much time or money for emerging rulers to recruit followers; orga-nize military campaigns; sponsor public works, monumental building projects,and public spectacles such as feasts and ceremonies; support royal family mem-bers, retinues, or administrators; and fund artisans (see Sahlins 1972 : 101; Wolf1966 : 4 – 9). Without surplus production, farmers could not take time off fromworking in their own fields to labor in the fields of their patrons or of the po-litical elite, not to mention provide corvée labor to build the material manifes-tations of political power (e.g., Sahlins 1968 : 92). And even if rulers owned orcontrolled, for example, large plots of agricultural land, they could not benefitfrom the fruits of the land if they could neither afford to pay laborers nor im-plement labor demands on others. Access to labor, thus, is more critical thanresource control— surplus labor, that is (cf. Russell 1938 : 31). The point is this:whatever the source of surplus, it is a must for anything political.For the sake of simplicity, I define four kinds of political systems — com-munity organization, local polity, and centralized and integrative polities.

The length and stability of political systems relate to specificcircumstances and surplus availability. Changing political fortunes typically donot affect daily living (settlement, subsistence practices)— political collapse of-ten results in people abandoning their kings, not their land and homes.In brief, community organizations have several leaders (e.g., lineage heads,village chiefs) who are unable to implement tribute demands but who use theirwealth to distinguish themselves materially. Farmers are extensive and /or in-tensive agriculturalists who rely on seasonal rainfall but do not rely on water/agricultural systems. People honor ancestors through public ceremonies. Localpolities differ from community organizations because they have denser settle-ments, rely on small-scale water/agricultural systems, and have one major in-stitutionalized leader (e.g., a paramount chief ). In exchange for what leadersprovide in times of need, such as providing food during famine and capital torepair water/agricultural systems damaged by heavy rains or flooding, peoplecontribute labor and goods to political coffers. Their power to acquire surplusfrom others is conveyed in public ceremonies which thank chiefly ancestors.Centralized polities represent the pinnacle of political power, and there islittle doubt that rulers’ capital and abilities to reach the supernatural are neces-sary in situations where dense regional populations rely on rainfall, intensiveagriculture, and large-scale water/agricultural systems. Their success is publi-cized in large-scale ceremonies with roots in traditional rites. In integrativepolities, the ruler has a similar role. The distinguishing features are that key re-sources and settlement are more dispersed, two factors that pose a challenge forrulers to integrate people. They succeed in doing so through frequent cere-monies, feasts, and other displays as well as playing a major role in fundinglarge-scale water systems.

How were peopleable to accomplish this feat and in many cases expand the political economy?Clearly, material resources are critical. Just as critical, or even more so, is ritual;simply put, those persons interested in acquiring power use ritual as a means toachieve their ends.Ritual and Political PowerRitual is not in good odour with our intellectuals.... In their eyes only economicinterests can create anything as solid as the state. Yet if they would only look aboutthem they would everywhere see communities banded together by interest in a common ritual; they would even find that ritual enthusiasm builds more solidlythan economic ambitions, because ritual involves a rule of life, whereas economicsare a rule of gain, and so divide rather than unite.hocart (1970 [1936] : 35)This section and the following one address the question of how a few peopleget others to contribute labor and services without compensating them equally.There are many pathways to political power, all of which have several commonelements (see Godelier 1978). For example, Michael Mann (1986) argues thateconomy, ideology, military force, and politics are the four sources of socialpower or the means of social control. Similarly, Timothy Earle (1997) viewseconomy, ideology, and the military as sources for political power or the ex-pansion and domination of the political economy. Richard Blanton (1998) dis-tinguishes two major sources of power: an objective base (material) and a cognitive-symbolic base (shared ideology). While alternative pathways topower exist (e.g., Flannery 1972), more centralized political systems developwhen more sources of power are controlled and integrated (Earle 1997 : 210 –211). Local circumstances (cf. Fried 1967 : 37 –38; Trigger 1991) and how peopleinteract with other people and adapt to their surroundings affect the ulti-mate success and duration of different political strategies, as well as the amountof goods and labor that political leaders can extract from others (e.g., Earle1997 : 15). Further, “these generic sources of power may in fact be universal to thepolitical process in human society, but the outcomes are highly variable” (Earle1997 : 193).A common factor in all political success stories, whatever their origins, is rit-ual. Political aspirants integrate people, promote political agendas, and situatepolitical change within known cultural constructs through the replication and01-T3558 12/20/05 4:41 PM Page 14"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Water and Ritual15expansion of traditional rituals. They incorporate new elements in such a wayas to make them seem as timeless and natural as the original rites. Emergingleaders not only take on the role of ritual specialist but, more significantly, serveas intermediaries between people and gods. Consequently, rituals reflect thisnew role, but in traditional formats.Edmund Leach (1966) notes that ritual pervades all aspects of society andlife, and thus it is not surprising that the politically ambitious transform ritualaction into political fortune (e.g., Bourdieu 1977 : 41). Ritual integrates religious,social, economic, and political life, including, for example, creating and main-taining alliances through marriage and long-distance trade (e.g., Friedman andRowlands 1978), warfare (e.g., Carneiro 1970), and integrative activities such asconstructing public works (e.g., Service 1975 : 96) and sponsoring religious cer-emonies, political rallies (e.g., Kertzer 1988), and feasts (e.g., Hayden 1995;Hayden and Gargett 1990). How these various factors intersect largely deter-mines the pathway to power. Through ritual, political actors involve active par-ticipants in political change rather than passive observers (e.g., Joyce 2004).Leaders, by rights as lineage elders and heads of military societies, kinshipgroups, and religious sodalities, often promote political change through ritual(Kertzer 1988 : 30) in which they show that their success benefits all members ofsociety (Godelier 1977 : 111 – 119). They organize the building and maintenanceof religious structures, subsistence technology including irrigation systems, andcanoes or roads for trade and craft production facilities and lead raiding par-ties — activities that typically involve ritual. Their role presupposes their abili-ties to lead and provides the opportunity for expanding their influence outsidetheir particular group. Often successful aspirants are descendants of foundingfamilies, who have closer ties to original ancestors — another predisposition intheir favor.Each group has special ties to an aspect of the supernatural world, which po-litical aspirants appropriate to highlight their special abilities (Bloch 1986).Emerging political elites claim closer ties to the supernatural world (particularlyancestors), using the same means employed by kinship lineage heads, whothemselves often are politically ambitious (Friedman 1975). As descendants offounding ancestors, they connect with more people (Bloch 1986 : 86). As inter-mediaries, they receive offerings that once were made directly to the ancestors(Friedman 1998; e.g., Friedman and Rowlands 1978; Helms 1998; Joyce 2004;McAnany 1995) and other supernatural forces....this development is an internally determined evolution, the outgrowth ofthe operation of the political economy within a pre-structured kinship system.Thus, the transformation to ranked hierarchy can be explained without anyexternal references.

A headman becomes a chief by taking on some of theproperties formerly possessed only by the deities. (Friedman 1998 : 129)For example, among the Kwakiutl, Eric Wolf (1999 : 103) notes:Since chiefs are represented as “iterations” of the founding ancestor or donor,they are equated with the creators or progenitors of the human groups overwhom they exercise authority. Because the original donor or ancestor firstoccupied the resource area that will subsequently be utilized by his group, the chief is also “owner” or manager of that resource base. Since the originaldonor was endowed with valuables —houses, crests, masks, songs — the chiefalso keeps and wields these prerequisites.Maurice Bloch (1986 : 117 – 119) explicitly details how the circumcision ritualin nineteenth-century Madagascar, in which every Merina male took part, wastransformed into a state ritual using the same rules of descent and authority.“The state took on the appearance of a large descent group, the descent groupstook on aspects of being a constitutive part of a small kingdom. As a result, atthe same time as the child renewed the blessing of the ancestors through cir-cumcision, he also became a subject of the king,” whereby he basically made adeclaration of his allegiance (pp. 117 – 118). The entire kingdom is thus repre-sented as one descent group. The king also takes on the authority structure ofkinship; earlier it was elder to younger; later, and in addition, it became king tosubject, as the king took on the role of elder (p. 192). The Merina king also wasable to keep an accurate count of men for taxation purposes (p. 144): he requireda specific time (every seven years) for the circumcision ritual to take place(p. 126). The ritual itself was performed privately in houses that involved familyand community members (p. 115). Afterward, the king traveled the land, “per-forming rituals at a number of specified sites to which were brought the chil-dren who had been circumcised” (p. 115). The royal circumcision ceremony wasquite spectacular and included an elaborate procession with members of thecourt and army (p. 127).By what means do political aspirants succeed? In a word, surplus. To bemore specific, it takes material capital to support rulers, their families, and theirretinues and to sponsor public works and integrative events (e.g., Hayden 1995;Hayden and Gargett 1990; Trigger 2003 : 375). Consequently, adequate resourcesnecessary to generate a surplus are a must, whatever the reasons for politicalchange (Engels 1964 [1957] : 274 – 275). While material factors have varying rolesin the emergence of rulership, material resources undeniably are required tosupport the political economy. Promoters attract supporters and simultaneously01-T3558 12/20/05 4:41 PM Page 16"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Water and Ritual17create obligations that last beyond the time frame of rituals. This strategy re-sults in long-term material benefits (e.g., debt relations). “A man possesses inorder to give. But he also possesses by giving. A gift that is not returned can be-come a debt, a lasting obligation . . .” (Bourdieu 1990 : 126, 1977 : 191 – 195). Thesepublic events thus promote the production of surplus (Hayden 1995; Haydenand Gargett 1990) and enable political agents to acquire it.As briefly mentioned, the first political agents likely come from foundingfamily stock; their wealth, as descendants of first-comers of any given area andowners of prime land or other resources, allows them to sponsor community orsmall-scale public rites. These actions result in obligations whereby sponsorsmaterially come out ahead. The scale on which rituals can be performed and theamount of surplus acquired vary in any given area.The obligations created are not just unidirectional. With leadership comeduties and responsibilities. Rulers now are obligated to take care of those who,at one level, pay for their services and protection (e.g., Leach 1970 [1954] : 187).They are duty-bound to help clients or subjects in times of trouble and need.Failing to fulfill obligations or violating subjects’ trust can result in the “con-tract” becoming null and void (Scott 1990 : 104). Finally, rulers’ power may belimited or constrained to some degree because of the challenges of living up tothe “idealized presentation of themselves to their subordinates” (p. 54). For ex-ample, regarding the relationship between serfs and their aristocratic masters infeudal Europe, James Scott (1990 : 104; emphasis in original) writes:. . . it would be important to understand how their claim to hereditary author-ity was based on providing physical protection in return for labor, grain, andmilitary service. This “exchange” might be discursively affirmed in an empha-sis on honor, noblesse oblige, bravery, expansive generosity, tournaments andcontests of military prowess, the construction of fortifications, the regalia andceremony of knighthood, sumptuary laws, the assembling of serfs before theirlords, exemplary punishment for insubordination, oaths of fealty, and so forth.The feudal “contract” could bediscursively negatedby any conduct that violatedthese affirmations: for example, cowardice, petty bargaining, stinginess, run-away serfs, failures to physically protect serfs, refusals to be respectful or defer-ential by serfs, and so forth.In this and other cases, problems can arise when nonelites buy into an elite orroyal ideology more than elites or royals themselves do (p. 104).In sum, while various ways of acquiring political power exist, the general pro-cesses of situating change typically do not; and a material foundation (namely,surplus goods and labor) is required. Ritual expansion occurs in tandem withpolitical change, both of which are funded by surplus goods and services.

Ritualthus is not a source of political power in the same manner as the military, econ-omy, and ideology but rather advances political agendas based on these inter-secting sources of power. It allows people to redefine the worldviews and codesof social behavior that explain “why specific rights and obligations exist” (Earle1997 : 8, 143 – 158; see Blanton et al. 1996; Wolf 1999 : 55). After all,...the same rite should seem to produce multiple effects while keeping thesame components and structure. . . . Conversely, just as a single rite can serveseveral ends, several rites can be used interchangeably to bring about the sameend. . . . What matters most is that individuals are assembled and that feelingsin common are expressed through actions in common. But as to the specificnature of these feelings and actions, that is a relatively secondary and contin-gent matter. (Durkheim 1995 [1912] : 390)I have described how the politically ambitious use ritual to serve political ends.But how does this process occur?Ritual and Political ChangeTraditional power has on its side the force of habit; it does not have to justify itselfat every moment, nor to prove continually that no opposition is strong enough tooverthrow it. Moreover, it is almost invariably associated with religious or quasi-religious beliefs purporting to show that resistance is wicked.russell (1938 : 38)Rulers incorporate traditional beliefs and practices into more elaborate forumsto situate political change using culturally familiar means. History has shownthat the most successful rituals derive from the home (e.g., Bloch 1986). Need-less to say, rituals sponsored and performed by rulers serve to integrate largernumbers of people than could ceremonies conducted in the home. However,rulers do not replace or restrict them. Consequently, public ceremony pro-motes solidarity, not to mention political agendas (Kertzer 1988; e.g., Joyce2004). Ritual expansion occurs in tandem with growing political inequality.Rulers eventually link their rule with the continuance of vital elements of lifesuch as fertility and rain (Rappaport 1999 : 281). They are looked to as munifi-cent providers of plenty but are also blamed during periods without plenty(Lincoln 1994 : 207). The obvious, conspicuous displays of “wealth, material re-sources, mass approval or record-high productivity all tangibly testify to thefruitful fit between the particular social leadership and the ways things shouldbe” (Bell 1997 : 129).01-T3558 12/20/05 4:41 PM Page 18"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Water and Ritual19Pierre Bourdieu (e.g., 1977, 1990), Anthony Giddens (e.g., 1979, 1984), andothers emphasize the importance of the dynamic relationship between struc-ture (material and social) and practice. Structure provides choices and con-straints or limits within which individuals practice or act but does not deter-mine behavior. This flexible structure leaves the door open for variability andchange. Hence, different but culturally acceptable behavior feeds back into thestructure, transforming it. Consequently, the process of social change can be,and often is, incremental and typically comes fromwithina social group (Gid-dens 1979 : 223, 1984 : 247). As actions are imitated and reproduced, agents canaffect change. Traditional rituals serve as an ideal forum for emerging rulers toinsert and justify their own political agendas. . . justbecauseof [their] conservative properties. New political systems borrowlegitimacy from the old by nurturing the old ritual forms, redirected to newpurposes. (Kertzer 1988 : 42; emphasis in original)Memories associated with . . . earlier ritual experiences color the experienceof a new enactment of the rites. Rites thus have both a conservative bias andinnovating potential. (Kertzer 1988 : 12)Invoking ties to the past makes new ideas or change appear traditional (Bell1997 : 149); they “contextualize and subordinate the current moment, therebyordering the relations of the past and present and establishing a sense of conti-nuity, security, and direction” (p. 168). Changes thus are “reconciled with tradi-tion” (Pauketat 2000 : 123). These rituals are successful because they incorporatethe same familiar traditional practices into more elaborate and larger settingsto situate the growing political power of particular interest groups (cf. Bourdieu1990 : 109 – 110; Flannery 1972; Weber 1958 [1930] : 55). “[M]any of the origina-tors of the changes in the ritual were conscious of the political implications ofwhat they were doing, and that this motivated what they did” (Bloch 1986 : 162).For example, the Merina circumcision ritual basically remained unchanged(p. 122). There were some new elements, however, that identified it as a stateritual (e.g., a schedule and required fee /tax) (p. 115). A less successful alterna-tive is abrupt or extreme change. Such actions are much less likely to succeedbecause new ideas, beliefs, and practices are too foreign and thus unacceptable.For example, the first emperor of China, Ch’in Shih Hwang Ti,. . . made an abrupt attempt to replace the prevailing Confucianist politicalphilosophy, which emphasized moral precepts as the basis for social tran-quility of the state, with a strongly pragmatic legalist doctrine backed by cen-trally administered, coercive force. . . .

(Webster 1976 : 824)Another well-known example comes from ancient Egypt. For a brief time inthe late Eighteenth Dynastic period, a “heretic” king, Akhenaten, ruled Egypt(1353 – 1335 bc) (Kemp 1991 : 262 – 273). His claim to fame, or infamy, is that heimplemented major religious reform by rejecting the human form of the suncult (Amun or Amun-Ra) and replacing it with the sun disk, the Aten, a “diskfrom which many rays descended, each one ending in a little hand” (p. 262).Images of Amun, as well as other gods from the vast Egyptian pantheon, weredefaced. Akhenaten established a novel temple format with open courtyardsfilled with altars; this contrasted with the traditional temple layout, wherepriests “wrapped the image of god in darkness and secrecy” (p. 262). Akhenatenalso confiscated temple estates, where priests had become increasingly wealthyand powerful (White 1971 [1949] : 246 – 248). Akhenaten and his court left thetraditional religious capital of Thebes to build a new one, Akhetaten or “Hori-zon of the Aten” (known today as El-Amarna) (Kemp 1991 : 266 – 267). Akhe-naten and his wife and consort, Nefertiti, were depicted as gods alongside theAten as sole intermediaries, which further extended the pharaoh’s power (Kemp1991 : 265). However,. . . the Aten robbed Egyptians of a tradition of explaining the phenomena of the universe through an extraordinary rich imagery . . . which managed tocontain the concept that a unity, a oneness, could be found in the multiplicityof divine forms and names. Akhenaten was telling the Egyptians somethingthat they knew already, but in a way that made further speculation pointless. It is easy to understand why the Egyptians rejected the king’s religion after hisdeath. He had tried to kill intellectual life. (p. 264)Soon after Akhenaten’s death during his seventeenth year of rule, his suc-cessor, Tutankhamun, returned to “religious orthodoxy” and reestablished tra-ditional temple cults and estates (e.g., Amun at Karnak) (Kemp 1991 : 267).Egyptians destroyed most of Akhenaten’s monuments and basically erasedmuch evidence of his rule from history; when he was referred to, he was “thatenemy from Akhetaten” (p. 267). Within 100 years, Akhetaten was abandoned(p. 272).In contrast, successful political leaders incorporate existing “principles of legitimation” (Earle 1989) but do notexpropriatethem. For example, T’ang(ad618 – 906) imperial rites in China originated from earlier dynastic ones(e.g., Chou, 1121 – 220 bc) that themselves derived from earlier ancestral cults(McMullen 1987). These Confucian-sanctioned rites were central to the T’ang01-T3558 12/20/05 4:41 PM Page 20"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Water and Ritual21political system for both its origin and continuance, especially in the face of in-creasing royal control over critical resources (cereal and rice fields) and increas-ing taxation. Everyone, though, continued to conduct domestic ancestral ritesprivately. Imperial ancestral ceremonies, however, were conducted publicly ona much grander scale. Chinese emperors replicated and expanded householdrites but did not restrict or replace them. All members of society conductedsimilar ancestral rites — from farmers and local bureaucrats to the emperor —with increasing grandeur and scale. Of course, they added new elements to tra-ditional formats (e.g., the fact that they have the mandate of heaven), whichwere accepted because of the familiar format used.The successful application of acceptable family or domestic rites increasesthe prestige of sponsors and legitimizes political authority, including rulers’ mo-nopolization of large amounts of land and their ability to acquire surplus fromothers (Bourdieu 1977 : 183 – 184, 1990 : 109 – 110; Cohen 1974 : 82; Giddens 1979 :1881 – 1895, 1984 : 257 – 261). Such rituals integrate larger numbers of people thanthe small-scale household or community rites from which they derive. For example, when Enga Big Men of precolonial Papua New Guinea became in-creasingly involved in external exchange networks, the growing wealth differ-ences were situated within traditional ancestor and bachelor cult rituals (Wiess-ner and Tumu 1998 : 369).When rulers sponsor public rites (e.g., feasts and ceremonies), they touchemotions (Bell 1997 : 73 – 74; Rappaport 1999 : 49, 226). Such feelings tend to dis-sipate afterward. Political actors thus use strategies that result in long-termbenefits; key factors are content, repetition, and type of ceremony (Rappaport1999 : 286), as well as the tangible symbols used (Helms 1998 : 166). Rulers typ-ically associate themselves with rituals that revolve around vital elements of lifesuch as rain, agricultural fertility, and ancestor veneration, conducted accord-ing to set schedules (ritual calendars) in special places (Cohen 1974 : 135). By di-rectly associating themselves with natural forces of day-to-day life, rulers ex-tend their influence beyond the duration of centripetal, integrative events.Cross-culturally, rulership is associated with fertility, purification, and asso-ciated rites (Helms 1993 : 78 – 79). People believe rulers to have special powers(Ibn Khaldun 1967 [ca. 1382 – 1404] : 319; Rappaport 1971, 1999 : 281; e.g., Geertz1980 : 129 – 131); they are seen to have exclusive knowledge and skill and are viewedas closer to the supernatural realm (Friedman and Rowlands 1978; Helms1998 : 74) or even as gods themselves. In time, they become directly involved inthe continuity of natural forces (Frazer 1920 [1890] : 51, 245 – 247). For example,after the 1905 revolution in Russia, Tsar Nicholas II discontinued many publicceremonies, including the annual blessing of the waters. The people “believedthat the prayers purified the water. They blamed the outbreak of cholera oc-curring from 1908 to 1910 on the suspension of the ceremony” (Wortman 1985 :01-T3558 12/20/05 4:41 PM Page 21"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"22Water and Ritual263). Similarly, in China the emperor played a major role in the regulation ofthe rivers; “. . . if the rivers broke the dikes, or if rain did not fall despite the sacrifices made, it was evidence — such was expressly taught — that the em-peror did not have the charismatic qualities demanded by Heaven” (Weber 1964[1951] : 31).Participation in public rites does not mean that people are automatons orthat they are being hoodwinked; “acceptance is not belief.... Acceptance... is nota private state, but a public act” (Rappaport 1999 : 119 – 120; emphasis in original).Symbols, rituals, emblems, and names are powerful sources of social integra-tion even if the members of a group do not attach the same meaning, motiva-tion, or interpretation to them. Individuals are united in a community becausethey share signs and rituals, but they may share these things without sharingtheir meanings. (Lee 2000 : 151)Public ceremony promotes solidarity and a sense of community, which iscritical as part of evolving political relationships. How audiences respond toroyal events can determine how successful they are (Inomata and Coben n.d.)and also create a situation where people contribute to their own subordination(e.g., Joyce 2000, 2004). “Performances communicate on multiple sensory lev-els, usually involving highly visual imagery, dramatic sounds... [resulting in asituation where] one is not being told or shown something so much as one isled to experience something” (Bell 1997 : 160). Rulers put on a show when theyperform traditional rites. Commoners thus are not passive witnesses but activeparticipants with a voice (e.g., Bell 1997 : 73; Houston and Taube 2000). Theirgoal is to reach gods and ancestors on behalf of the people to bring forth rain,bountiful crops, and so on. Thus, commoners benefit by attaining access to socially defined value-goods handed out at special events (food, objects, etc.)(Pauketat 2000). In addition, nonparticipation might be perceived as antisocialor noncompliance and result in social sanctions (e.g., ostracism, accusations ofsorcery, and refused access to local resources).Religious nonconformity was an offence against the state; for if sacred tra-dition was tampered with the bases of society were undermined, and thefavour of the gods was forfeited. But so long as the prescribed forms were duly observed, a man was recognised as truly pious, and no one asked how his religion was rooted in his heart or affected his reason.

People all participate in the larger-scale public ceremonies andtheir own small-scale private domestic rituals from which the former derived.Royal rites are superimposed on traditional ones (e.g., Godelier 1977 : 188), withnew elements highlighting the special qualities of rulers (e.g., Chang 1983).The fact that everyone, rich and poor, performs the same rites promotes sol-idarity and a sense of belonging (e.g., Bell 1997 : 123; Kertzer 1988 : 19). For ex-ample, in nineteenth-century Madagascar, all members of Merina society con-ducted new-year renewal ceremonies in which they called upon their ancestorsto bless them (Bloch 1987). The same ritual bath was repeated in every house-hold, from commoner to royal. These rituals, which took place at the beginningof the agricultural season, involved blessings from superior to junior, a featurethat rulers expanded — from master to servant, ancestors to elders to children,father to son, to king to subjects. They not only served to legitimize authoritybut, more significantly, also provided a forum for advancing royal power, par-ticularly after the often violent succession of a new king. In addition, gifts werepresented from junior to senior, resulting in the king’s receiving large amountsof tribute. Palace layout, cardinal directions, sacred places, and objects were alsoco-opted by Merina royals to emphasize their sanctified right to rule and com-mon ties with their subjects (Kus and Raharijaona 1998, 2000).Eventually, these series of events often result in the development of central-ized systems where kinship ties are replaced with nonkin ties that take on theappearance of kinship relations and are later replaced by nonkin ties where pre-tense no longer is required (Cohen 1974 : 24; Earle 1997 : 4 – 6; Godelier 1977 :123), though patrimonial rhetoric can still be used (Blanton et al. 1996). Addi-tionally, once they have a certain degree of power, rulers can create completelynew and different rituals without ties to the past for public as well as private orrestricted consumption. For example, early Frankish kings in the Middle Ageswere anointed with the same oil used to baptize the first Christian Frank, St. Clovis (Giesey 1985). The king’s first entrée into Paris was celebrated by en-actments of the baptism of Clovis along his route. After 1550, however, the con-tent of celebrations in Paris shifted to the king himself from earlier religiousand historical themes. By the eighteenth century the entrée into Paris wasdropped altogether, replaced by another set of rites revolving around the “cultof the Sun King.” In this case, traditional rites were initially replicated, then ex-panded, and later transformed. When French kings acquired enough power(e.g., a standing army), they could replace earlier rites with both public and pri-vate /restricted ones: “When a dynasty is firmly established, it can dispense withgroup feeling” (Ibn Khaldun 1967 [ca. 1382 – 1404] : 314; emphasis in original).However, the French continued to conduct traditional Catholic rites in theirhomes and local churches.What factors set in motion monarchs’ loss of power?

Before ad-dressing this question further, I define political collapse.Demise of Political PowerDynasties have a natural life span like individuals.ibn khaldun (1967 [ca. 1382 – 1404] : 343; emphasis in original)George Cowgill (1988) has defined various types of collapse. In most cases, it involves “political fragmentation” whereby politically unified systems breakdown into their constituent parts (e.g., Mesopotamia, India, Egypt, and theRoman Empire). Great traditions, however, typically persist, as they did forlong periods in Roman territories, Egypt, and Mesopotamia. Replacement alsooccurs, whereby new governments replace previous ones for various reasons, aswas the case in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and France. In rare cases people abandona region, as in some areas of the southern Maya lowlands and likely parts ofsouthern Mesopotamia (Cowgill 1988; Tainter 1988 : 191). It is also rare when apolitical vacuum remains empty, which was the case in the southern Maya low-lands in the Terminal Classic period.Norman Yoffee (1988) calls for a distinction between the collapse of “states”and the disappearance of “civilizations.” In the former case, the political econ-omy fails, resulting in a reversion to prestate organization or the replacement ofone political hierarchy by another. For example, while centralized political sys-tems of Egypt have changed hands for millennia, their subsistence base (theNile and alluvium) has remained stable through present times (Kemp 1991 : 10 –13). In the latter case, it is the disappearance of “great traditions,” includingwriting systems and elite and royal symbols and monumental architecture. Forexample, Yoffee (1988; Baines and Yoffee 1998) details how variously sized po-litical fortunes changed hands several times during the millennia but shows thatthe Mesopotamian “great tradition” persisted long after Mesopotamian politi-cal systems were replaced by foreigners in ca. 539 bc(Cyrus of Persia) until atleast ca. ad75.Joseph Tainter (1988) also notes that collapse is not necessarily catastrophic,especially for the majority of people; usually only people in the upper politicalechelons and administrators are affected by political disintegration. Further-more, collapse can be an adaptive mechanism when, for whatever reasons, thecurrent system no longer works (p. 198).

For example, based on their work at the Zapotec regional center of RíoViejo, Oaxaca, Mexico, Arthur Joyce et al. (2001) posit that nonelite farmers, ifthey did not have a direct role in the demise of the political elite, definitelymade their feelings known after rulers fell from grace at the end of the Classicperiod. They reused royal monuments as building materials and subsistencetools (e.g., metates) and built their homes on the former royal acropolis.For purposes of this study, a collapsed society can be defined as one that is“suddenly smaller, less differentiated and heterogeneous, and characterized byfewer specialized parts; it displays less social differentiation; and it is able toex-ercise less control over the behavior of its members” (Tainter 1988 : 38; emphasisadded). The latter part of this statement is particularly significant — losing ac-cess to the labor of others, the reasons for which become apparent throughoutthis work.Climate, Resources, and Political Histories...a Prince who rests wholly on Fortune is ruined when she changes.machiavelli (1994 [1514] : 81)In a fascinating series of studies, Carole Crumley (1993, 1994, 1995a, 2001) con-vincingly argues that the height of Roman power in Europe was facilitated bya stable climate pattern that favored an urban-rural lifestyle. This climatic pe-riod (ca. 300 bc–ad250), called the Mediterranean climatic regime, consistedof hot and dry summers and rainy winters. Climate prior to this period wascooler and more seasonally unpredictable. Crumley suggests that the unstableclimate episodes required more flexible subsistence, social, and political strate-gies, like those found before 300 bcin Celtic Europe. The Celts practicedagropastoralism, were somewhat mobile, and had a loose social structure. Dur-ing Roman hegemony, also known as the Roman Climatic Optimum (300 bc–ad250), the stable climate “facilitated urbanization [and] the homogenizationof the landscape through the commoditization of rural produce . . .” (Crumley1994 : 198) and sustained relatively “inflexible forms of governance” (p. 192), resulting in what Crumley (1995a:26) refers to as an “ecology of conquest.” Cli-mate change, when more unpredictable and cooler seasons predominated be-ginning in the late second century ad, resulted in consistent crop failures, hail-storm damage, and blight (Crumley 2001). The Roman Empire depended onagricultural surplus to feed the people of Rome and to fund the political econ-omy.

Finally, Celtic peoples, now free from Roman demands, did not andcould not revert to the life they had led before 300 bc; different circumstancesexisted, much history had passed, and much knowledge about the natural land-scape had disappeared, setting the stage for serfdom (Crumley 2003).The period after the fall of the western Roman Empire became known asthe Dark Ages (ad400 – 900) (Gunn 1994), which really meant that there werenot many written records, since the recording of dynasties, royal events, tributelists, and so forth was unnecessary. The Dark Ages were followed by anotherfavorable climatic regime (favorable for surplus production and appropriation,anyway), known as the High Middle Ages (ad90 – 1250). Population “plum-meted” in the Late Middle Ages (ad1250 – 1450) with the “return of cool andmoist summers” (Gunn 1994 : 94). Interestingly, Joel Gunn (1994 : 95) notes thatwhen “Europe is blossoming, the Mayas retire to subsistence agriculture”— atleast in the southern lowlands.While the scenario in Europe might appear to hark back to formulaic cul-tural ecology (warmer, stable climate \u0003inflexible political systems; and cooler,variable climate \u0003flexible political systems), it does make sense in light of theavailable evidence, especially when taking into account historical and social fac-tors. For example, community organizations, with flexible sociopolitical orga-nization and plentiful resources, could more easily adapt in the face of climaticchange. The same could not be said for centralized and integrative polities,which are less politically flexible. Local polities fall somewhere in between;consequently, specific historical circumstances largely determine their fate. Inother words, different trajectories are set in motion by changing climate (e.g.,Fagan 2004). The more powerful and inflexible they are, the harder they fall inthe face of long climatic perturbations. While political systems may fail, frag-ment, or be replaced, average commoners are working to adapt their subsis-tence and settlement practices to changing conditions, a strategy that has beenin place since the dawn of humanity.Climate change also exacerbates other existing problems. For example,...the Sumerian, Akkadian, and subsequent civilizations in the Tigris andEuphrates River Basin in present-day Syria, Iraq, and western Iran, and theIndus, or Harappan, civilization in the Indus River Basin in present-day Paki-stan and western India were all negatively impacted by deforestation, over-grazing, and salinity built up from long-term irrigation. (Hardesty and Fowler2001 : 79)These factors affect surplus production and hence political systems. Farmersin ancient Egypt did not have to face the problem of salinity, because “after the01-T3558 12/20/05 4:41 PM Page 26"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Water and Ritual27harvest in summer, the ground dried and cracked, enabling aeration to takeplace, which prevented water logging and the excessive accumulation of salt”(Kemp 1991 : 10). Since their political foundation was based on surplus fruitsborn of the Nile, however, inadequate flooding during dry years spelled troublefor pharaohs when famine and plagues spread throughout the land. Fekri Has-san (1994) plots the relationship between climate and political history and notesthat periods of political instability largely resulted from low floods and drought.Dynasties weakened or failed altogether. Egyptologists refer to these times asintermediate periods.A well-known biblical story emerged during one such period: the story ofJoseph in the Book of Genesis (41 – 47). Several scholars place the story in theearly part of the Second Intermediate period (1640 – 1540 bc), when Hyksosruled Egypt for a time (Bright 1981 : 87). In the story Joseph, originally broughtinto Egypt as a slave, successfully interprets the pharaoh’s dream signifyingseven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine. Forewarning allowedthe pharaoh to stockpile grain and thus be prepared when annual floods wereinadequate and famine eventually spread throughout the land. In the first yearof famine, people gave “money” and livestock in exchange for food. In the sec-ond and following years, when people’s money and livestock were depleted, thepeople handed over their land and offered their labor in exchange for food andaccess to land they formerly owned. They still farmed the land they once ownedbut now owed a fifth of the crop to the pharaoh. I am sure that if the faminehad lasted longer, eventually even the pharaoh’s stockpile would have dissi-pated. They might have been able to feed their people with food acquired viatrade, but eventually the surplus they needed for exchange would be depleted,as would their political power. Clearly, while climate change can result in po-litical instability, it can also benefit the political savvy under certain conditions.These examples clearly illustrate the critical role that climate patterns andchange played in subsistence and political systems. How do these factors affectdifferent political systems?Communities and local polities are typically more stable and durable thancentralized and integrative polities because they rely less on large-scale subsis-tence technology and rulers’ capital and food stores and make fewer demandson resources. Nonetheless, in all situations there are circumstances that are be-yond their control. The more flexible their social and political system, however,the better people can deal with, for example, changing climate or other drasticchanges.When noticeable change does occur, for whatever reason, it can affect po-litical systems in various ways — they can fragment into their constituent parts,or governments can be replaced from within or with external forces (Cowgill1988).101-T3558 12/20/05 4:41 PM Page 27"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"28Water and RitualRitual and Political CollapseRituals are performed in all societies, whatever the political system. As ArthurHocart (1970 [1936] : 35) aptly notes, rituals existed long before governments. In community organizations elites sponsor feasts, performances, and religiousrites and organize small-scale projects (e.g., building religious structures, ter-races, and canals) to promote solidarity in the face of wealth differences. House-hold rites involve ancestors and fertility, both critical to their survival. In localpolities, chiefs perform rituals in public arenas that involve chiefly ancestors asdescendants of gods, as well as agricultural fertility, rain, and war gods. Allmembers conduct similar rites in the home and community. In centralized andintegrative polities, royal rites revolve around royal ancestors and the fact thatthey have the “mandate of heaven.” Rulers conduct elaborate ceremonies andfeasts in monumental settings including temples, stadiums, and arenas to at-tract and keep followers. Ceremonies also acknowledge the importance of othergods, especially those in the upper echelons of the supernatural hierarchy.Household and community rites continue to revolve around ancestors and tra-ditional deities concerned with rain and crops. They are still quite important,especially since farmers are relatively economically self-sufficient and thus mustrely more on their own ceremonies. Rulers, however, are the major players inreaching the supernatural world and highlight the perception that the contin-uance of their rule results in prosperity for them all.In all political systems, ritual never leaves the home; and when rulers disap-pear or political dynasties are replaced, people continue to conduct the samerites in the same places they had since before the emergence of political lead-ers. Nor is there any doubt that ritual is critical for political power and survival.Rulers who associate their rule with the supernatural are successful in times ofplenty. When food and /or water supplies diminish to the point where peopleare materially affected, however, rulers are the first to be blamed when their cer-emonies fail. Clearly the gods no longer support rulers (Frazer 1920 [1890] : 352;e.g., Helms 1998 : 168; Kaufman 1988). This failure might result in last-ditch ef-forts to reach the gods through even more elaborate rituals, which might actu-ally hurt the system even more if surplus is being used to fund ceremoniesrather than feed people.Political power thus lasts as long as rulers demonstrate that their ceremo-nies successfully propitiate supernatural entities (Hocart 1970 [1936] : 142 – 155).When they cannot, there is no longer any reason for farmers to contribute topolitical coffers:. . . beliefs vindicating the power of rulers also became limits on their power.

Gradually, the doctrines that conferred on them the abilityto elicit obedience came in some cases to justify insubordination and evenrebellion. Indeed, in time, the doctrines not onlypermittedsuch resistance toundeserving rulers; they were sometimes held . . . tomandateit. The securityand power of the inner governing circles were thus weakened by the very prin-ciples that had once blocked challenges to their ascendancy. (Kaufman 1988 :226 – 227; emphasis in original)For example, in China there is evidence as early as the Chou dynasty (1100 –256 bc) of a “heaven’s mandate” that related to whether or not kings were suc-cessful (Chang 1983 : 34). “[P]olitical dynasties fell because the king misbehavedand no longer deserved to rule. . . . The dynastic cycles . . . have nothing to dowith the rise and fall of the civilization; it merely signifies the shifting politicalfortunes of specific social groups whose rulers gain or lose their claim to themoral authority to rule” (Chang 1983 : 35). A similar situation existed in Bali;J. Stephen Lansing (1991 : 109) discusses how temple priests and princes couldlose the mandate of heaven if they were unable to amass the necessary labor andgoods to sponsor large-scale rituals, which they could not do when water sup-plies were low.The point is this: the power of rulers is closely tied to divine support, a rela-tionship maintained through ritual and funded through surplus. When supportis removed, so is their power.In the next section I present a possible scenario as to the process of how po-litical rulers emerge, how the majority of people participate in the creation ofpolitical obligations, and how political power is lost. The following scenariocan (and does) occur at any time and place and serves as the framework for thepresent study.A ScenarioHistory repeats itself.In cases where farmers migrate to previously uninhabited areas (versus the au-tochthonous emergence of a farming lifestyle), first founders eventually distin-guish themselves from newcomers by building larger houses and acquiring ex-otics. Everyone performs the same rites; elites, however, use more expensiveitems as offerings — they can afford to relinquish them forever. Elites compen-sate workers with prestige items, food, and /or access to resources. Workers01-T3558 12/20/05 4:41 PM Page 29"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"30Water and Ritualmust be well paid since they could choose to work for other elite families. Pa-trons sponsor ceremonies and feasts for workers, their families, and the entirecommunity to show their gratitude and to attract more clients. These eventsprovide a break from work, a time to socialize, and opportunities to exchangeinformation and goods. Public ceremonies and feasts also provide elites a chanceto increase their prestige in the eyes of farmers and other elites who competefor labor and prestige. Finally, these events allay conflict in the face of socio-economic differences.This story has been repeated again and again throughout time and space.The question becomes, when and how does equal compensation (choice) trans-form into tribute extraction (little or no choice)? That is, when do wealthy individuals or elites become rulers? When and how do patron-clients becomeruler-subjects? Where necessary material conditions do not exist, of course,these questions are moot. But when they do, and historical circumstances arejust so . . .Initially, extensive farming provides enough food for everyone. Later, asmore and more people move into any given area and population grows, farm-ers start to invest more effort and time in intensive strategies to produce greateryields. Kinship groups no longer can resolve disputes over land and water allo-cation since they often involve nonkin interactions. Nor can farmers protectthemselves from outsiders without organized assistance. A greater reliance ondomesticates makes farmers more vulnerable and dependent on rainfall, espe-cially in the face of seasonal flood damage and drought. Elites with larger land-holdings typically have more stored foods, which they dole out in times of need.Emerging leaders do not provide these services for free. Ambitious people re-alize that they can demand payment for use of their services, above and beyondwhat could be defined as equal compensation. Some acquire large landhold-ings — corporate or otherwise — from hungry or thirsty people who then be-come tenant farmers. They have to be careful, however, not to demand toomuch, or farmers could flee; in other words, farmers do have some leverage.Leaders’ chances are enhanced in areas with noticeable seasonal issues orproblems. The story of Joseph in the book of Genesis illustrates this point quite well; after the seven-year famine, the pharaoh owned many means of pro-duction— in this case, fertile land. And this story is repeated again and againthroughout history. When circumstances become favorable again, it is clearlydue to rulers’ successful supplication of gods and ancestors, which they do inincreasingly grand forums by performing traditional rites and funding grandceremonies and feasts (“bread and circuses”). These events provide a break fromthe hardships of daily survival and opportunities for leaders to illustrate theirsuccess in the eyes of their clients and fellow patrons. If famine lasts too long01-T3558 12/20/05 4:41 PM Page 30"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Water and Ritual31and food stores run out, however, people no longer can rely on rulers’ ability toreach the gods.A leader’s success keeps people paying and keeps attracting others, includ-ing people who are persuaded to leave rival factions. To further increase thenumber of tax-paying members, political leaders use surplus acquired fromothers to support military incursions into neighboring polities; the goal is toconquer for access to more land and labor, not to kill people per se (other thanenemy leaders, of course). More people require more food and water, and con-sequently they further rely on intensive agricultural regimes. While leaders maynot own such systems or organize their actual construction, they do providecapital to rebuild them after damage caused by, for example, flooding. Duringfamine, they also open their storage facilities, filled to the brim with food fromtheir fields or from trade. Again, these services are not provided for free. Lead-ers continue to sponsor integrative events in large arenas to promote solidarityand a sense of belonging. Traditional rites writ large include new elements thathighlight ruler’s ability to reach the gods. Leaders also perform new rites thatrevolve around royal families for both public and private viewing.Eventually, one powerful ruler arises above others in an area where seasonalfluctuations in water and food supplies exist and where people rely heavily onlarge-scale water/agricultural systems — as well as the plentiful agricultural landthat supports their lifestyle and subjects. Farmers by this time do not have manyoptions but to pay taxes. Avoidance and resistance are met with force. Blatantcoercion, however, is unstable and potentially politically dangerous. Rulersmust offset any negative feelings about their power over others by providingprotection, food, and capital and sponsoring grand events. But commonershave to get something in return for their tribute (e.g., protection, capital, ac-knowledgement of social membership, or food and water in times of need).Maintaining a balance is the challenge. If demands are too much, farmers fleeto a rival kingdom or, if possible, flee political demands altogether and live inmore marginal areas. If demands are inadequate, rulers cannot fund the politi-cal economy.Rulers distinguish themselves from others not only through living in palacesand owning a plethora of wealth items but also through having skilled artisanscopy their likenesses onto public and private media — from rollout stamps andcoins to massive and grandiose sculptures and buildings. Often kings make surethey are depicted alongside gods as if they, too, are divine. Everyone partic-ipates in ceremonies that revolve around the royal family to celebrate their divine or special status. Such rites are superimposed on traditional ones thateveryone continues to perform, royal or not. They also integrate a large enoughnumber of followers to require a recording system to keep track.

Rituals no longer work, and rulers fail intheir supplications to supernatural entities. Close ties to the otherworld havepros and cons; pro when rain and food are plentiful, and con when they are not.Of course, farmers blame the ruler. After a king falls from grace, elite and non-elite farmers continue to conduct the same rites they always had before and dur-ing the appearance of rulers, which remained geared to surviving in a changingworld.Concluding RemarksThe approach taken in this work bridges the gap between studies on the emer-gence and demise of rulership by focusing on two factors — water and ritual. Iattempt to show how emerging Maya rulers expanded family-scale rites (espe-cially dedication, ancestor veneration, and termination rituals) into larger com-munal ceremonies as part of the process that drew seasonal labor from farm-steads to centers. This system worked for nearly a millennium. What happenedto cause farmers to abandon their rulers? Why did rulers eventually fail to con-vince farmers to pay homage in the form of surplus goods and labor? The re-mainder of this book seeks to address these questions.01-T3558 12/20/05 4:41 PM Page 32"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2Classic Maya Political HistoriesNo one questions the existence of powerful Classic Maya rulers in the south-ern Maya lowlands of present-day Central America (northeastern Chiapas,eastern Tabasco, southern Campeche and Yucatán of Mexico, north and cen-tral Guatemala, Belize, and western Honduras) (Figure 2.1). To appreciate theiraccomplishments, we need to understand the variety of political systems as wellas the people who supported rulership via surplus goods and labor — common-ers. Farmers provided rulers’ foods, goods, and the labor to work in their fieldsand to build their palaces, temples, and ball courts. Evidence for surplus aboveand beyond household and community needs is quite apparent in the archae-ological record — monumental buildings (temples, palaces, and ball courts),large-scale water systems (e.g., reservoirs), skillfully manufactured and labor-intensive wealth objects and inscribed and carved monuments, and the pres-ence of nonsubsistence producers (e.g., artisans and rulers and their families,retinues, and underlings). Maya kings could not have funded these activitieswithout the support (surplus) of many others. While it is not possible at pres-ent to determine exactly how surplus was organized (equal compensation, cor-vée labor, or combinations of both), there can be little doubt that surplus laborwas available and that kings were able to access it.How did Maya rulers acquire surplus from others? What say did commonerfarmers have? These questions are crucial in view of how the Maya lived on aday-to-day basis and what this meant for rulers who wanted, and needed, to in-teract and communicate with farmers to be able to appropriate surplus laborand goods. They also relate to how powerful Maya rulers became. Simply put,the most complex and powerful polities emerged in areas with the most notice-able seasonal rainfall concerns — not enough or too much — and large amountsof fertile land.

Mayaagriculture was rainfall-dependent, and farmers used various water or agricul-tural systems includingaguadas,artificial reservoirs, raised fields, dams, canals,and terraces (Dunning et al. 1997). The majority of farmers lived in farmsteads(one to five structures facing an open area or patio) dispersed throughout thehinterland, as well as near or in centers, mirroring scattered pockets of fertileland (Dunning et al. 1998; Fedick and Ford 1990; Ford 1986; Rice 1993; Sanders1977). Many farmers also seasonably inhabited field houses away from theirhomes (e.g., Lucero 2001 : 35 –38; Webster et al. 1992). In addition, farmerssearched for new land in the face of population growth and competition overland (Ford 1991a; Tourtellot 1993). Finally, it appears that scattered hinterlandsettlements were largely economically self-sufficient (Lucero 2001). Somethingthen had to bring farmers and other subsistence producers to centers and getthem to pay taxes, so to speak. It was not stored food, since centralized or large-scale storage facilities are unknown in the southern Maya lowlands (Luceron.d.a). The average farmer probably did what the Lacandon of highland Chia-pas do at present; farmers collect corn every few days from their fields as needed(McGee 1990 : 36). They turn the ears of corn downward to prevent damagefrom rain and pests (e.g., birds).Maya political agents were faced with integrating a dispersed, relatively self-sufficient populace, and one that may have been somewhat seasonally mobile.Traditionally, Maya move their families around for several reasons. For ex-ample, during the agricultural season in San José, Lake Petén Itzá, Guatemala,many farmers live in their field houses away from their village homes; the sizeand distance of milpa fields determine whether they stay just during the week(49%,n\u000339) or move their entire families to the field for the duration of thegrowing season (11%,n\u00039) (Reina 1967). This strategy is often necessary dueto the demands of agriculture; for example, in the Lake Petén Itzá area, fieldsare first cleared (cutting can be easier during the rainy season when vegetationis green; Faust 1998 : 153) and then burned at the end of the dry season. TheMaya plant seeds at the beginning of the rainy season, after which the most in-tensive labor is required for daily maintenance (e.g., weeding) when crops aregrowing (Reina 1967; see also Atran 1993).Ruben Reina (1967) also notes that farmers abandon field houses every threeto four years when crop productivity decreases in search of more fertile land.Betty Faust (1998 : 56 –57) describes a similar pattern for the Maya in Pich, inthe southeastern Yucatán; each family group has rights to two or threeranche-rías(field houses). Each field is planted for about two years and left fallow forfifteen to twenty years. Consequently, each household could conceivably build02-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 35"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"36Water and Ritualat least three field houses, if not more, during the course of a generation. Faust(1998 : 82) also found that people migrated in search of water:. . . oral histories collected from 1985 – 1992 indicate that normal yearly fluc-tuations just result in temporary migration to relatives in neighboring villagesthat have more reliable wells. . . . These same oral histories refer to processesof village fission, where groups of young people leave to look for existingponds (which possibly were abandoned reservoirs of former occupied settle-ments) near good soil, where they can begin new hamlets.Seasonal and residential mobility occurred during the Colonial period too(e.g., Farriss 1984 : 199 – 223; Graham 1994 : 325; Tozzer 1941 : 90). Social and po-litical factors also can result in migration; for example, migration was an effec-tive strategy to escape Spanish demands in colonial Mexico (Fox and Cook1996). The point of this brief presentation of historic and ethnographic cases ofseasonal and residential mobility is to highlight the fact that these processesalso likely took place in the more distant past — especially to meet dry-seasonwater needs. Thus, even if the majority of prehispanic Maya farmers were in-volved in intensive agricultural and permanently settled in hinterland areas, theneed for water may have drawn them into centers.Nearly everything in Maya life was rainfall-dependent (e.g., Scarborough2003). The annual dry season, up to six months long, had to be a concern, es-pecially in areas without surface water. While the dry season was an agriculturaldown-time for the most part (usually January through May or June), people stillrequired water for daily drinking needs, not to mention for cooking maize andother food preparation, making plaster and ceramics, bathing, and other activ-ities. When the southern Maya lowlands became a green desert each year, wa-ter was vital and became a key factor in the emergence of political power inmany, if not most, areas (Lucero 1999b). People relied on artificial reservoirs(e.g., Ford 1996). For example, Vernon Scarborough (2003 : 51; Scarborough andGallopin 1991) shows that the water catchment system at Tikal could collectmore than 900,000 m3of water (based on 150 cm of annual rainfall). The cen-tral precinct reservoirs (six) alone could hold from 100,000 to 250,000 m3ofwater. Using the estimate suggested by Patricia McAnany (1990) that each per-son needs 4.8 liters of water daily (which includes water for drinking, washing,making ceramics, cooking, and other daily requirements), we can estimate howmany people Tikal’s reservoirs potentially serviced. There are several estimatesfor Tikal’s population, including the periphery; William Haviland (2003) sug-gests about 45,000 people, while T. Patrick Culbert et al. (1990) suggest up to62,000. Given that 1 m3is equal to 1,000 liters, 45,000 to 62,000 people wouldrequire, for a period of six months, from 38,880,000 to 53,568,000 liters or02-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 36"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Classic Maya Political Histories3738,880 to 53,568 m3of water. These figures do not take into account other typesof reservoirs at Tikal (residential andbajo-margin reservoirs andaguadas) (Scar-borough and Gallopin 1991) or other types of activities that require water (e.g.,agricultural activities and building projects). However, this brief exercise doesillustrate the potential number of people who could have used royal reservoirsat Tikal (and other centers).Hinterland farmers may have had another option than relying on royal res-ervoirs: spring wells. Kevin Johnston (2004b) suggests that some Maya in thePetén dug wells at fault springs, which he found to be the case at Itzán (whichis less than a kilometer from Laguna Itzán), Uaxactún, and Quiriguá. None ofthese sites, however, are regional centers. Adequate dry-season water suppliesmeant that rulers did not have the means to acquire much power. And in con-trast to parts of the northern lowlands, the water table is too low to access watervia wells in the southern Maya lowlands (McAnany 1990), except in a few in-stances (e.g., Quiriguá) (Ashmore 1984).The wet season also brought its own suite of problems, especially floodingand hurricanes. While the prehispanic Maya did not settle directly in areas thatflooded annually on the coast or the lower river terraces, tropical storms causedheavy damage to crops and water/agricultural systems everywhere, as they do atpresent (e.g., Hurricane Katrina). Farmers repaired small-scale systems on theirown. Large-scale ones, however, required organization and capital to repair,something that Maya kings provided (Lucero n.d.b).A final seasonal issue that had an impact on farming schedules is when therainy season actually began. In any given area in the lowlands, the beginning ofthe rainy season could vary by up to five months, and the annual rainfall alsovaried (Gunn et al. 2002). If the rains came later than expected, planted seedsrotted. If they began earlier than usual, seeds did not germinate. And there wasalways the risk that farmers might not burn their milpa fields early enough be-fore the rains began; wet brush does not burn easily, if at all.I contend that Maya kings provided water during annual drought throughmaintaining water systems and /or provided capital when water/agriculturalsystems and crops were lost to storm gods. Rulers brought people together bysponsoring public events that derived from household, agricultural, and waterrituals that highlighted their special abilities in reaching gods and ancestors. Asa result of this strategy, common farmers participated in creating their ownsubordination, not to mention debt relations.02-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 37"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"38Water and RitualHistory of Maya RulershipThe Preclassic (ca. 1200 BC–AD 250)The Middle Preclassic (ca. 1200 – 250 bc) is characterized by the migration ofMaya peoples into formally unoccupied inland areas (e.g., the Petén) fromriverine or coastal areas (Ford 1986 : 59, 80 – 82).1Tikal and its core area, locatedin the deep interior of the Petén, were one of the last regions settled. This areahas some of the richest agricultural soils in the tropical world but has limitedwater sources; some scholars suggest that somebajos(seasonally inundatedswamps) at one time may have been perennial wetlands or even lakes, whichmay have silted up due to erosion by the beginning of the Classic period (e.g.,Culbert 1997; Dunning et al. 1998, 2003, n.d.; Hansen et al. 2002; Pope andDahlin 1989). Either way, as populations grew, water became a concern.The earliest southern lowland Maya elites or wealthy families emerged inthe Middle Preclassic (ca. 900 bc) as first founders. We also see the first ap-pearance of Olmec iconography, which has implications for rulership later on. Everyone, rich and poor, conducted domestic rites (e.g., at Cuello; Ham-mond and Gerhardt 1991; Hammond et al. 1991). And the first lithic “ec-centrics” appear during this period (McAnany 1995 : 46). Eventually elites orga-nized the building of monumental architecture, including small temples, oftenwith masks flanking staircases (e.g., Cerros), ball courts (e.g., Nakbé), and plat-forms (e.g., Cerros, Nakbé, Cuello, Lamanai, El Mirador) (Freidel and Schele1988; Hammond et al. 1991; Hansen 1998; Marcus 2003; Matheny 1987; Pen-dergast 1998).The Maya, however, built water/agricultural systems even before they con-structed monumental architecture (Scarborough 1993). The earliest known wa-ter systems in the southern Maya lowlands (ca. 1000 bc) are found in northernBelize and consist of “shallow ditches draining the margin of swamps” (Evansand Webster 2001 : 354; Scarborough 2003 : 50). Their construction acceleratesafter 1000 bc, when Maya began to migrate into inland areas lacking perma-nent water sources. Water systems include wetland reclamation (e.g., Cerros)and “passive” or concave micro-watershed systems where the Maya took ad-vantage of the natural landscape, particularly depressions (e.g., El Mirador,Petén) (Scarborough 1993). Water symbolism also appears in the Preclassic andis associated with early public monumental architecture (Scarborough 1998).In the Late Preclassic period (ca. 250 bc–ad250), high-ranking lineageswere transformed into royal ones, when rulers may have assumed shamanisticcharacteristics to mediate between people, ancestors, and gods and became rit-ual specialists par excellence (Freidel et al. 1993; cf. Stuart 1995 : 188). VirginiaFields (1989 : 6) has demonstrated that “the thematic content of the primary02-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 38"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Classic Maya Political Histories39symbols of Maya rulership (i.e., royal regalia and titles), whose imagery wasrooted in the natural world, reveals a continuity with more ancient Mesoamer-ican culture [i.e., Olmec].” These include “the depiction of rulers as seated (alsoembodied in the ‘seating’ glyphic expression for accession), the use of jaguarianimagery to express rulership . . . and the ‘maize headband,’ which, as the JesterGod, becomes a primary icon of rulership among the lowland Maya” (p. 98).The use of the headband suggests to Karl Taube (1995) that Maya kings per-formed agricultural and rain-making rites.Centers like El Mirador and Nakbé arose during this time, only to be aban-doned by the end of the Preclassic, perhaps because of failed water-managementsystems as a result of silting-up (Hansen et al. 2002; Scarborough 1993), drought(Gill 2000), or subjugation by more powerful polities (Marcus 2003). If therewere perennial wetlands and /or lakes, they also silted up as a result of erosion(e.g., Hansen et al. 2002). Monumental architecture became more standardized(Hansen 1998). For example, the E-Group assemblage makes its debut (Chaseand Chase 1995). The first elite tombs also appear in the Late Preclassic (Krejciand Culbert 1995). Inscriptions focused on ceremonial events (e.g., accession),which were carved or painted on portable objects rather than on public monu-ments (Mathews 1985; Schele and Miller 1986 : 109). Individuals were not yetdepicted, though the termahaw(lord, ruler) appeared by the first century bc.The first recorded royal dynasties were founded in the first century ad, at leastretrospectively (Grube and Martin 2001).The Early Classic (ca. AD 250–550)The Early Classic is characterized by increasing population shifts (e.g., to cen-ters in some areas and abandonment of others) and growth (Adams 1995; Rice1996). Bruce Dahlin (1983) notes the appearance of defensive works, especiallyin the northeastern lowlands (e.g., Becan; Webster 1977).Water storage, especially artificial reservoirs, became particularly importantin the Early Classic (ca. ad250 –550), when Maya farmers continued to moveinto upland areas with fertile land but with few, if any, permanent water sources(e.g., Tikal). Even people living close to rivers such as Río Copán and Río Azulbegan to build reservoirs and other water systems (Fash and Davis-Salazar n.d.;Harrison 1993).This period witnessed full-blown Maya rulership. Inscriptions shifted froma focus on ceremonial bloodletting to individual rulers (Mathews 1985; Pohl andPohl 1994). Genealogical succession and the role ofahawwere firmly estab-lished. This fact is ornately portrayed on free-standing public monumentalsculpture (stelae and altars), including the first appearance of rulers holding themanikin scepter, a staff symbolizing rulership (Freidel and Schele 1988; Stuart02-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 39"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"40Water and Ritual1996). The Maya built the first royal architectural features (e.g., hieroglyphicstairways and palace complexes) at regional centers, including Copán (Fash1998), Tikal ( Jones 1991), and Palenque (Barnhart 2001). This period “was char-acterized by states with palaces, standardized two-room temples arranged onplatforms in groups of three, royal tombs, and a four-tiered settlement hierar-chy . . .” (Marcus 1998 : 61).The earliest rulers arose at regional centers such as Calakmul and Tikal(Marcus 1993) and later at secondary centers. Kings conflated the traditionalpractice of ancestor veneration with rulership (Gillespie 2000b; McAnany1995 : 227). Early Classic deposits became much more diverse in terms of qual-ity, form, and quantity in elite and royal contexts but remained largely the samefor nonelite deposits. Rulers emphasized the importance of royal ancestors inthe lives of everyone and their close ties to important deities (rain, maize). Theyconducted ceremonies on palace platforms and the top of tall, multitieredtemples overlooking audiences in large plazas. Rulers resolved the increasingnumbers of disputes arising over land and water allotment. Corporate kinshiprelations were no longer adequate to adjudicate disputes involving resources.Kings (for example, at Tikal and Copán) also incorporated foreign themes suchas the central Mexican non-Maya rain god, Tlaloc, and other elements fromTeotihuacan (Fash 1998; Schele and Miller 1986 : 213) that demonstrated theiresoteric ties and knowledge. Inscriptions tell of monumental building dedica-tions (Schele and Freidel 1990). They also mention conquests and the capture ofroyal persons, royal visitations, heir accession, bloodletting, and period-endingrites (e.g.,katunor twenty years at Tikal, Copán, Yaxchilán, Altar de Sacrifi-cios, and Piedras Negras). Competition between centers became more obvious,as reflected in the iconography, where military themes start to appear (Math-ews 1985; Stuart 1993, 1995 : 133).“A political breakdown (known as ‘the hiatus’) characterized some, but notall, Petén sites during the Middle Classic, ad534 –593 . . .” (Marcus 1998 : 61;Pohl and Pohl 1994), which likely indicates fluctuating political histories, notto mention shifting labor pools (Lucero 1999b). Throughout the Early Classic,competition between centers increased for control over labor, exemplified bythe increasingly hostile relations of Tikal, Calakmul, Caracol, and other cen-ters (Chase and Chase 1989).The Late Classic (ca. AD 550–850)The Late Classic is characterized by increasing population (Rice 1996), com-petition, and warfare. Inscriptions leave little doubt as to the prevalence of war-fare throughout the Late Classic (Stuart 1995 : 133, 304), at least in the written02-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 40"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Classic Maya Political Histories41records. Victorious Maya kings won over the labor pools of vanquished rulersbecause of their success on the battlefield.Water management reached its height in sophistication and scale in this pe-riod, epitomized in convex macro-watershed systems where reservoirs, dams,and channels were designed to capture and store water (e.g., Tikal, Caracol)(Scarborough 1993, 2003 : 50 –51; Scarborough and Gallopin 1991). This patternis mirrored in other water/agricultural systems as well (e.g., Harrison and Tur-ner 1978).This period witnessed the florescence of political power and royal public rit-uals, not to mention the continuation of traditional rites in the home. Inscrip-tions include the elevated statusk’ul ahaw(divine or holy lord) (Houston andStuart 1996; Stuart 1995 : 189). Inscriptions and iconography also amply illus-trate that Classic Maya rulers had close connections to important Maya deities(e.g., lightning’s power, ancestral spirits) and to the otherworld (e.g., Marcus1978; Peniche Rivero 1990; Schele and Freidel 1990). Rulers often impersonatedgods (Houston and Stuart 1996), and their names embodied some of their qual-ities — for example, K’inich (Sun god) Balam ( Jaguar) of Palenque. Other in-scriptions tell of “house censing” or “house burning” (Stuart 1998) and illustratethe proliferation of royal or nondomestic rites, in addition to pan-Maya ones,that included ball games, royal marriages, period-ending rites, royal anniver-saries, royal visitations, heir accession, sacrifice of royal captives, bloodletting,and other rites not yet understood (fish-in-hand, flapstaff ) (Gossen and Le-venthal 1993; Schele and Freidel 1990; Schele and Miller 1986). Late Classic ritual deposits demonstrate great diversity in terms of form, quality, and quan-tity — at elite and royal structures at least. The most powerful kings were en-tombed in funerary temples facing large plazas that could hold thousands ofpeople (McAnany 1995 : 51).Scenes on Late Classic polychrome vessels depict royal rites and ritualdances taking place “on the spacious stairs and upper terraces of the palacecomplex” (Reents-Budet 2001 : 202). These buildings faced plazas where largenumbers of people could watch and participate in ceremonial events. Scenes onvessels and other iconography also depict feasts, banquets (Reents-Budet 2001),and tribute payments to rulers (Stuart 1995 : 365). Such payments are “often rep-resented bySpondylusshells attached to heaped mantles” and “quantities of ca-cao beans” as well as “heaps of tamales and bowls of pulque” (Houston and Stu-art 2001 : 69). Rulers were also depicted alongside gods, indicating theirnear-divine status: “These symbols of supernatural identity strongly suggestthat rulers had significant priestly functions in the making and celebrating ofstations of the calendar, a function that was central in defining their ritual re-sponsibilities . . .” (Stuart 1995 : 199).02-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 41"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"42Water and RitualThe Terminal Classic (ca. AD 850–950) and Early Postclassic (ca. AD 950–1200)The Terminal Classic is characterized by “disintegration,” whereby the Mayaabandoned most centers (see Demarest et al. 2004b). At an early stage, how-ever, smaller centers started to build monuments on their own or, more specifi-cally, independent of major centers (Marcus 1976; Pohl and Pohl 1994). For ex-ample, rulers of the small centers of Ixlú and Jimbal, formerly subordinate toTikal, both proclaimed themselves K’ul Mutal Ahaw (in ad879 and ad889, re-spectively), a title once only used by Tikal’s rulers (Valdés and Fahsen 2004).Farmers left centers — more specifically rulers — or migrated out of the south-ern Maya lowlands altogether. In addition, architectural evidence from the Pe-tén lakes region suggests a different type of sociopolitical organization or re-organization (Rice 1986). Access to private royal palaces was no longer restricted;there were no large funerary monuments. The majority of the last-dated mon-umental construction also occurred at this time (e.g., Tikal, ad869; PiedrasNegras, ad810; Bonampak, ad790; Yaxchilán, ca. ad810). And the last knowninscriptions at many centers (e.g., Yaxchilán, Palenque, Piedras Negras, etc.) allinvolve military themes. “At the very moment that cities like Tikal were col-lapsing, others in Belize (such as Lamanai) and in the Puuc region of the Yu-catán Peninsula were ascending to their greatest heights. . . . And when somecities in Belize and in the Puuc began to decline, there was a new surge in stateformation and expansion, particularly in northern Yucatán . . .” (Marcus 1998 :62; e.g., Carmean and Sabloff 1996). Many Terminal Classic inscriptions nolonger incorporated individual rulers or dynasties but instead emphasized dei-ties (e.g., Chichén Itzá) (Wren and Schmidt 1991).In addition to what was happening internally, Terminal Classic ceramics,stelae, and architectural evidence indicate that there was also an intrusion ofsome sort by non-Petén Maya (e.g., perhaps the Chontal Maya), for example,in the Petén lakes region (Rice 1986). Foreign or new/different elements, per-haps from Ucanal in the northeast (Tourtellot and Sabloff 2004), also start toappear in the iconography and architecture at Altar de Sacrificios and Seibal,especially the latter; they include “non-Classic Maya figures, long hair, strangecostumes and regalia. . . . phallic ‘Atlantean’ dwarfs, a ‘Toltec’ prowling jaguar,a circular pyramid, ball courts, radial temples, causeways, a remote stela plat-form . . .” (Tourtellot and González 2004 : 61). David Stuart (1993) suggests,however, that they may represent a new social order where for the first timenonroyal personages were incorporated into monumental or public art, a fur-ther sign of changing times. The appearance of nonroyal personages in the ico-nography also occurred at centers not affected by foreign influences, such asCopán (Fash et al. 2004; Fash and Stuart 1991), which likely was related to the02-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 42"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Classic Maya Political Histories43erosion of both resources and political power. However, there were definitelyoutside influences coming into the Maya lowlands that reflected a political sys-tem more susceptible to external penetration due to the increasing sociopoliti-cal disintegration. Whatever the causes, it should be noted that centers thatshow “foreign” influences, such as Seibal (e.g., last dated monument —ad889),Altar de Sacrificios (last date ad849), and other southern centers, went througha period of florescence (albeit brief ) when other areas in the interior Petén werecrumbling (Culbert 1988; Sabloff 1992; Willey and Shimkin 1973).In sum, the Terminal Classic period can be described as one where the seamsof the political system were coming apart. This system, once supported by alarge labor pool, collapsed without the support of people who now were mi-grating out to other areas or dispersing permanently into the hinterlands. A dif-ferent story unfolds in the northern lowlands, which experienced a florescencefrom ca. ad750 to 1000 (e.g., Carmean et al. 2004; Demarest et al. 2004a).The Early Postclassic period in the southern Maya lowlands is characterizedby smaller settlements; many, if not most, of them are found near permanentwater sources. For example, the Maya continued to live in the Belize River val-ley, although not necessarily in centers (e.g., Ashmore et al. 2004; Lucero et al.2004; Willey et al. 1965 : 292), other Belize valleys (e.g., McAnany et al. 2004),wetland areas in northern Belize (e.g., Andres and Pyburn 2004; Masson andMock 2004; Mock 2004), and near lakes and rivers in the Petén (e.g., Laporte2004; Rice and Rice 2004) and elsewhere (e.g., Fash et al. 2004; Johnston et al.2001). For example, population shifted north to Chichén Itzá (Cobos 2004),likely attracted by better opportunities (e.g., trade) and a new ideology origi-nally from central Mexico centered around Kukulcan, the feathered serpent.Trade became more focused on maritime routes involving both subsistence andexotic or prestige goods (e.g., salt production) (McKillop 1995, 1996).The disintegration of the southern lowland Maya polities, embedded in rit-ual, water, and resources, also was expressed in the changing focus of publiciconography, which is now largely found in the northern lowlands. During theClassic period, there were a number of gods particularly associated with the rul-ing elite, especially K’awil and God D (Itzamna) (Miller and Taube 1993 : 99;Taube 1992 : 31 – 42, 78; Thompson 1970 : 200 – 233). The main focus on Itzamnadramatically lessened with the political collapse, not surprisingly, since this wasa god associated with divination, esoteric knowledge, and writing (Taube 1992 :31 – 40). This deity was also connected to the sun, rain, and maize gods (Thomp-son 1970 : 210) and, significantly, also had an evil side having to do with the de-struction of crops. Thus, what we see in the Early Postclassic period is a differ-ent type of religious focus than the one found in the Classic period, whichmirrored the political system it formerly legitimized — that is, semidivine rulersversus group rulership (popol naor council house) (Pohl and Pohl 1994).02-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 43"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"44Water and RitualTo summarize the major points in Maya prehistory, notable trends includepopulation growth (steady growth over a millennium; Deevey et al. 1979; Rice1996) and shifts, changing political histories and competition, and the presenceof ornate royal paraphernalia. At the household level, however, things prettymuch remained the same, and domestic rites never left the home (e.g., Andresand Pyburn 2004). Political demands and royal rites had been superimposedonto existing systems that in some degree continue to this day. So for the com-mon farmer what changed was the lifting, for a time, of the burden of payingtribute.Water and Late Classic Maya Political SystemsThe scale and degree to which Maya rulers and elites could expand rituals andpolitical power at minor, secondary, and regional centers were largely condi-tioned by the amount and distribution of agricultural land, seasonal water vaga-ries, scale of water/agricultural systems, and settlement patterns (Lucero 1999b,2002a, 2003). In general, kings acquired and maintained varying degrees of po-litical power through their ability to provide water during the annual dry sea-son and capital during the rainy season and to integrate farmers through ritual,especially dedication, ancestor veneration, termination, water, and other tradi-tional rites.Each center type can be viewed as part of a continuum. The model is a heu-ristic device to assess political histories at different Maya centers. The types arenot static and impermeable; they are fluid and are only an attempt to separatethe constituent parts of complex and dynamic systems. Each center has its ownspecific history; even though this is the case, all Maya, elite or not, lived in atropical setting that had an impact on their social, economic, political, and re-ligious lives. Structurally, center types are similar to those briefly presented inChapter 1. The major difference is that in the Maya case we are dealing withone society in one major period. In many cases, centers can be viewed as nestedhierarchies, though clearly the histories of how they relate to one another varyby type and particular circumstances. Consequently, some centers were inde-pendent entities and others were subsumed under larger polities. This beingsaid, minor centers have features similar to those of community organizations,though typically larger-scale; secondary centers are the same as local polities,regional river centers the same as centralized polities, and regional nonriver cen-ters the same as integrative polities. The factors used to define types (which aredetailed in Chapters 4, 5, and 6) are similar to those in Chapter 1 and includeresource distribution, elevation, annual rainfall, seasonal water issues, the pres-02-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 44"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Classic Maya Political Histories45ence of water or agricultural systems, settlement patterns and density, internaldifferentiation, leadership, resource access, territorial extent, external relations,political economy, conflict, interaction sphere, type and scale of monumentalarchitecture, scale of integrative events, public iconography, the presence ofwriting and emblem glyphs, duration, and Terminal Classic events (Table 2.1).While I discuss some factors more than others, I include them all here to pro-vide a more complete backdrop.resource distribution:The location of centers with regard to wa-ter supply and concentrated, dispersed, or extensive agricultural land bears onpopulation size and density, as well as whether or not resources could produceenough surplus to fund the political economy. Agricultural potential of soil isbased on soil fertility, soil parent material, workability, root zone, drainage,slope, and erosion (Fedick 1996).elevation:This factor relates to precipitation, terrain, temperature, andagricultural soil type (Fedick 1996). It may also relate to whether or not wet-lands were perennial or seasonal; for example, Kevin Pope and Bruce Dahlin(1989) note that perennial wetlands are more common in elevations below 80 masl (above sea level).annual rainfall:The amount and timing of seasonal rainfall affectedagricultural schedules and settlement practices, factors that were critical sincethe Maya were rainfall-dependent.2seasonal water issues:Water shortages during annual droughtwere particularly problematic, which the political elite used to their advantage.Flooding, hurricanes, and other rain damage also affected settlement decisions,agricultural practices, and political power.

Estimating population size in thesouthern Maya lowlands is a relatively contentious topic (see Lucero 1999a).For example, due to the high Late Classic population estimates proposed bysome (e.g., Culbert and Rice 1990), Scarborough et al. (2003 : xvi) “suggest thatabsolute village autonomy during the Classic period was not an option.” How-ever, as I have written and summarized elsewhere (Lucero 1999a), evaluatingpopulation size is difficult at best. The lack of refined chronologies (e.g., lessthan fifty years) does not help matters. Further, we need to take into accountthe movement of people through the landscape (e.g., seasonal mobility, migra-tion) and structure function (e.g., percentage of specialized structures vs. domi-ciles such as workshops, religious structures, sweat houses, field houses, stor-ages structures, kitchens, and administrative buildings). In addition, there are“invisible mounds,” which are difficult to identify in the archaeological record( Johnston 2004b; Pyburn 1997). For present purposes, I use structure densities,a relative measure that is easier to compare among sites. Whatever the popula-tion size, there is no doubt that the highest population numbers and densitiesoccurred in the Late Classic period (Rice and Culbert 1990).internal differentiation:This factor distinguishes surplus re-sulting in wealth differences where elites compensated laborers for services ren-dered from surplus politically extracted without equal compensation.leadership:The more surplus one appropriated without equal compen-sation, the more powerful one was.resource access:Monopolizing resources provided the necessarywealth to sponsor ceremonies and feasts and create obligatory relations throughgift-giving (e.g., debt).

The scale and motives of Classic Maya warfare are alsocontentious topics in Maya studies (Webster 1998, 2000). Conditions in thesouthern Maya lowlands jungle — wet and dry seasons, lack of roads, no beastsof burden, no metal armaments, and travel issues — make it difficult to assessthe nature of warfare (Webster 2002 : 223 – 228). Nor is there an obvious wargod, though some gods appear to be associated with violent death and sacrifice(Taube 1992 : 148 – 149). However, Stuart (1995 : 361) notes the clear associationof warfare and tribute in the hieroglyphic record. Some battles may have re-sulted in territorial gain (Culbert 1991; Marcus 2003), especially those foughtbetween centers in close proximity to one another (e.g., in the Petexbatún area;Demarest 1997), but most likely consisted of struggles among elites to gainprestige in the eyes of their supporters (Webster 1998). Maya rulers could notprovide much protection per se; commoners protected themselves by escapingto other areas or into the bush.interaction sphere:Elite interaction is expressed through prestige-goods exchange, whereas royal interaction is expressed through prestige-goodsexchange plus intercenter alliances and marriages and royal dynastic rites.

Kings at secondary centers acquired power by dominatingprestige-goods exchange and nearby agricultural land, but to a lesser extentthan regional kings, because they were unable to access all the dispersed pock-ets of agricultural land, small-scale water/agricultural systems, and scatteredfarmers. Elites at minor centers could not obtain tribute but relied on theirwealth as landowners to procure prestige goods and organize local ceremonies.They did not have much or any political power, because agricultural land wasextensive and plentiful, and elites could only integrate farmers in the immedi-ate vicinity. Nor did farmers rely on water/agricultural systems, since water wasplentiful year-round; instead they relied on the annual flooding and receding ofthe river for agriculture. Whether or not they were beholden to rulers at majorcenters, as members of a larger society, Maya at minor centers interacted andexchanged information and goods with Maya from other areas.02-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 52"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Classic Maya Political Histories53The Classic Maya were similar to other ancient civilizations where waterand seasonal issues played a major role in the underwriting of political powerand where subjects perceived rulers as protectors and providers.

Before discussing the Maya, however, I define ritual— what it is andwhat it is not, and how to identify ritual in the archaeological record. In thefinal section I discuss Maya rituals and present expectations regarding the rela-tionship between traditional rites and the emergence of Maya rulership.The definition of ritual is not agreed upon in anthropology (Richards andThomas 1984), not to mention elsewhere. For example, in the 1993 unabridgedRandom House dictionary, the word “ritual” has twelve definitions. Interest-ingly, but not surprisingly, most definitions have religious connotations (Ran-dom House 1993 : 1661; emphasis in original):CHAPTER 3Maya Rituals: Past and Present03-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 54"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"1. an established or prescribed procedure for a religious or other rite. 2. a sys-tem or collection of religious or other rites. 3. observance of set forms in publicworship. 4. a book of rites or ceremonies. 5. a book containing the offices to beused by priests in administering the sacraments and for visitation of the sick,burial of the dead, etc. 6. a prescribed or established rite, ceremony, proceed-ing, or service:the ritual of the dead.7. prescribed, established, or ceremonialacts or features collectively, as in religious services. 8. any practice or pattern ofbehavior regularly performed in a set manner. 9. a prescribed code of behaviorregulating social conduct, as that exemplified by the raising of one’s hat or theshaking of hands in greeting. 10.Psychiatry.a specific act, as hand-washing,performed repetitively to a psychological degree, occurring as a commonsymptom of obsessive-compulsive neurosis.— adj. 11. of the nature of or practiced as a rite or ritual:a ritual dance.12. of or pertaining to rites or rit-uals:ritual laws.While definitions of ritual vary, anthropologists at least agree that ritual per-vades all aspects of life (Leach 1966), including religious, political, and eco-nomic realms, all of which intersect. Because ritual expression typically involvesthe use of symbols, dancing, singing, oral stories, ceremonies, and feasting, manyof these acts leave telling material evidence due to their “structured nature,”representing repetitive behaviors (Richards and Thomas 1984 : 191; cf. Kertzer1988 : 9). “All acts of ancient worship have a material embodiment, which is notleft to the choice of the worshipers but is limited by fixed roles” (RobertsonSmith 1956 [1894] : 84).The material qualities of ritual make it possible: (1) to identify ritual in thearchaeological record; (2) to illustrate the type and continuity of material ex-pression or ritual through ethnographic research and analogy; and (3) by doingso, to contribute to bringing ancient rites back to life. I wish to expand brieflyon this last point. Archaeologists indeed can reveal ancient ritual activities.With the aid of ethnographic analogy, we can also perhaps identify the type ofritual. But we cannot illuminate the beliefs behind the rituals. For example, Ihave excavated several prehispanic Maya burials in the floors of houses in cen-tral Belize. Based on ethnographic, ethnohistorical, and epigraphic data, I wouldbe comfortable, as are others, in suggesting that burials, based on their locationand grave goods, reflect ancestor veneration. However, it is not sound scholar-ship to attempt to discuss the beliefs behind ancestor veneration, other than stat-ing that ancestors were clearly important to the ancient Maya, as they are at pres-ent. Time and history have passed to the degree that it is not possible to equaterecent beliefs with ancient ones. In addition (and as I illustrate below), differ-ent people often believe different things while participating in the same rite.Maya Rituals5503-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 55"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Ritual Is Action, Not BeliefsReligious phenomena fall into two basic categories: beliefs and rites. The first arestates of opinion and consist of representations; the second are particular modes ofaction. Between these two categories of phenomena lies all that separates thinkingfrom doing.durkheim (1995 [1912] : 34)Scholars tend to conflate ritual and religion, and hence beliefs, because they focus on the religious aspects of ritual rather than on the ritual aspects of reli-gion. And since religious beliefs are “beyond the realms of archaeological in-ference...” (Richards and Thomas 1984:189), presumably so is ritual. Ritual,however, is not epiphenomenal. “Labeling ritual as ideology universally masksthe material qualities of ritual action . . .” (Walker 2002 : 162), and we cannot reduce “actions to beliefs” (Walker 1995 : 67). Of course, most rituals involve religion.That some of these relationships are with beings, forces, or powers having no“rational” or “practical” standing is irrelevant to the study of the manipulationof material culture engendered by those relationships. For archaeology, depos-its and sequences of deposits resulting from such relationships become tan-gible evidence of prehistoric religion. (Walker 2002 : 161)Ancient ritual activities are being revealed worldwide, especially religiousand political ones — and secondarily economic rites (e.g., Bradley 1990; Walker1998, 2002). For example, William Walker (1998), using ethnographic data, ar-tifact context, and depositional histories, argues that the ritual killing of witchesexplains the obvious evidence for violent death in the prehistoric U.S. South-west, rather than just cannibalism and warfare. In another case, Walker (2002)again uses artifact context and depositional histories to illustrate that CasasGrandes in Chihuahua, Mexico, was ritually dismantled and abandoned andnot destroyed during a catastrophic battle as others have claimed.The archaeological record, however, cannot reveal beliefs. Rituals can be ob-served; beliefs cannot. As a matter of fact, participation in the same rituals doesnot entail participants having the same beliefs (Kertzer 1988; Rappaport 1999 :119 – 120; Robertson Smith 1956 [1894] : 16). For example, sociologist Daniel B.Lee has studied religious practices of the Weaverland Conference Old WorldMennonites of New York and Pennsylvania and shows that they did not haveto share common beliefs. “Ritual is socially meaningful as a source of social sol-idarity because it transcends the personal beliefs of individuals” (Lee 2000 : 1).To illustrate this, Lee (pp. 4 –5) discusses the “kiss of peace”; people are sup-56Water and Ritual03-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 56"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"posed to say certain things in greeting (which actually varies). As to the signifi-cance of the kiss of peace, when asked, each person has a different response —for example: “Our ancestors brought the kiss with him or her from Germanyand Switzerland. We want to hold on to those traditions,” or “The kiss was es-tablished by the early leaders of the church,” or “It’s from the Bible. The disci-ples did it,” or “I don’t know why we do it” (p. 5). According to Lee, the im-portant point is to “make it look right” (p. 5). “[A]s long as members follow therules of the church, their personal reasons for doing so are of little social con-sequence” (p. 143).William Robertson Smith (1956 [1894] : 17) noted this fact over a century agoin his treatise on the origins of Semitic religions. As Lee demonstrates, ritualsserve to promote solidarity and a sense of belonging (see Kertzer 1988 : 11, 62).David Kertzer (1988 : 67) labels these integrative events “solidarity without con-sensus.” In other words, different people often explain the same ritual in dif-ferent ways, as the Mennonites do. Rituals (and symbols) can and do have mul-tiple meanings (Cohen 1974 : 29, 36; Durkheim 1995 [1912] : 390). Solidarity,however, is created by people participating together (Kertzer 1988 : 72), “not bypeople thinking together” (p. 76; Lee 2000 : 142). Ritual clearly is an efficientmeans to communicate ideas, worldviews, status, economic, and political differ-ences with the purpose of integrating people (Kertzer 1988 : 30). “Rituals bringpeople together, identifying a common allegiance through these symbols andmaking them feel as one” (p. 64). For example, among the Merina of Madagas-car, Bloch (1986 : 122) notes that the circumcision ritual has basically remainedunchanged from its first known recording in 1800 to a recent recording in 1971,though social, economic, and political histories have changed dramatically.Because of these features of ritual, it can serve as a powerful medium ofchange. “Ritual becomes a mechanism of social and material reproduction, inthat it sanctions the redefinition of people and things” (Richards and Thomas1984 : 190). While we cannot elucidate the multiple meanings or beliefs of ritu-als and their symbols, we can reveal the rituals themselves and their settings(private, restricted, or public) and scale (small or large).Identifying Ancient RitualAs I detail elsewhere (Lucero 2003) and note again, the most promising ar-chaeological evidence of the relationship between ritual and politics is thevari-abilityresulting from the dynamic relationship between structure and practiceand the way in which political aspirants expanded upon that variability (Walkerand Lucero 2000). Variability and expansion leave telling evidence in the ar-chaeological record (Schiffer 1976 : 7), especially ritual, since it has both conser-Maya Rituals5703-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 57"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"vative and innovative properties. For example, Kent Flannery (1976) proposesthat during the more egalitarian period in Oaxaca all members of society prac-ticed bloodletting, using stingray spines. By the Middle Formative, however,“chiefly” individuals appear to have used jade spines, community leaders sting-ray spines, and the rest imitation spines made from mammal bones. Chiefs con-ducted bloodletting rites in public arenas. The temporal variability in artifactsand location may indicate the expansion of traditional rituals for larger-scale religious and presumably political activities. A similar scenario took place inWestern Europe from the Neolithic through the Iron Age. The aquatic loca-tion of ritual offerings does not change through the millennia. The types of ma-terials used and the quality of manufactured goods increased, however, and thefocus changed “. . . so that what started as an informal transaction between theliving and the gods was transformed into one of the central political activitiesin prehistoric society” (Bradley 1990 : 202).The material aspects of rituals, including how they are replicated and ex-panded, leave traces in the archaeological record and include ceremonial andreligious structures, temples, caches of ritual objects, and burials (e.g., Bradley1990 : 10 – 14; DeMarrais et al. 1996). For example, because the Maya performedrituals for nearly every construction phase during the building and rebuildingof houses, palaces, and temples, the life histories of structures reflect suchevents and result in the creation of interconnected sequential deposits, includ-ing fill, artifacts in fill, floor features, and artifacts on floors (Walker and Lu-cero 2000). Ceramic vessels smashed and burned on floors differ ritually fromwhole vessels found in fill under floors. The pots themselves became part of thelife history of the structure (e.g., Gillespie 2001) as their life history changedfrom a domestic vessel to a ritually deposited item, whole or broken (see Thomas1991 : 57, 63; e.g., Kunen et al. 2002). “It is common in the archaeology literaturefor the term ‘ritual’ to be used as a catch-all designation for anything which de-fies a crudely utilitarian explanation” (Richards and Thomas 1984 : 189). “Utili-tarian” versus “nonutilitarian” designations are thus a false dichotomy (Walker1998, 2002). It has to be eradicated if our goal is to recognize “structured de-posits” (Richards and Thomas 1984), created by repetitive, formalized actionsor “purposeful deposition” of items, whether they be pig bones or gold diadems.Repetitive behaviors result in specific sequences in the archaeological recordthat reflect ritual actions. Consequently, the contexts of artifacts are key foridentifying ritual activities (Walker 1995). Domestic objects such as cookingpots can become ritual items if they are taken out of a kitchen and used in a cer-emony or, in the case of the ancient Maya, if a serving dish is taken from ahouse, rendered useless by ceremonially “killing” it, and then offered as a ded-icatory cache. Rather than just evaluating strata in terms of chronology, we canview them as reflecting sequences of (ritual) behaviors — more specifically, rit-58Water and Ritual03-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 58"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"ual replication and expansion— where similar formal ritual activities took placein a variety of architectural contexts, from houses to palaces and temples. Whilethe quality and quantity of goods may have changed from commoner house toelite compound to palace and temple (e.g., from one or two plain vessels to nu-merous labor-intensive polychrome vessels), their context (under or on top ofsurfaces) and ritual significance (e.g., dedication cache or termination deposit)are the same. This behavior resulted in functionally and structurally similar rit-ual deposits in houses, palaces, and temples.For example, the content of Zapotec rituals between 1500 –500 bcincludedancestral spirits andpèe,“the vital force within powerful natural forces of thecosmos” (Marcus 1996 : 286). Figurines dating to ca. 1500 – 850 bcassociatedwith ancestor rites were recovered from residences but not from public areas.Beginning ca. 1150 bc, figurines became more diverse in form and context, sig-nifying increasing status and wealth differences. By 500 bc, however, figurinesseem to disappear from domestic contexts. Marcus suggests that the focusshifted out of domestic contexts to standardized temples where ritual special-ists performed rites to ancestors of elites and royals. This practice expanded;and by Monte Albán II (ca. 100 bc–ad200), Joyce Marcus and Kent Flannery(1996 : 182) suggest that full-time priests “took a great deal of ritual out of thehands of Zapotec laymen.” But they also note that not many commoner houseshave been excavated. Eventually, however, at least in Monte Albán proper,commoners apparently were increasingly excluded from state rites altogether( Joyce et al. 2001).In another example, excavated residences outside of the Aztec capital of Te-nochtitlan (e.g., at Chiconautla, Nonoalco, and Cuexcomate) yielded evidencefor domestic new-fire ceremonies, including ritual dumps of ash and largesherds from vessels of all kinds — utilitarian, incensarios, and figurine frag-ments (Elson and Smith 2001). The Mexica adopted the new-fire ceremonyduring the Postclassic period, a rite conducted every fifty-two years that waswidespread in northern Mesoamerica. Aztec emperors, however, institutednew practices whereby all fires had to be lit by imperial runners once a new firewas lit during the imperial ceremony on Mount Huixachtlan, a sacred moun-tain near Tenochtitlan.These few examples illustrate the material reality of ritual actions. In the fol-lowing section, I detail the long history of Maya rituals. Ethnographic andethnohistoric cases provide the backdrop to examine the role of prehispanicMaya rituals in the rise of rulers.Maya Rituals5903-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 59"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Maya Household Dedication, Ancestor Veneration,and Termination RitualsThe significance and prevalence of Maya rituals are illustrated in the ethno-graphic and ethnohistoric records, including feasts and cave, rain, renewal,household, agricultural, and water ceremonies. I focus on household dedica-tion, ancestor veneration, and termination rites because they have a long tradi-tion and leave clear evidence in the archaeological record. These rites always re-mained in the home and were expanded for community solidarity and later forpolitical purposes. Domestic rituals revolved around life, death, and renewal,aspects that concerned everyone in Maya society. Therefore, they are ideal forpolitical appropriation. My intent is not to deemphasize the significance ofother rituals; this work is only an exercise to illustrate ritual replication and ex-pansion. It does not take away from the significance of other public ceremonies,such as those conducted at the community level. Community rites took placein open areas near water sources, small plazas, and ball courts and leave less ob-vious evidence; further, archaeologists seldom excavate these areas (e.g., Davis-Salazar 2003; Fox 1996; LeCount 1996; Robin 2002). Evidence for dedication,ancestor veneration, and termination rites, however, abounds. And if it can beshown that these rites were replicated and expanded, it follows that other tra-ditional rituals also were, especially water ceremonies.The Ethnographic Record: SyncretismThe material expression of Maya rituals has continued from prehispanic timesto the present (Deal 1988). Beliefs have not. There have been dramatic changesin the last millennium, including the abandonment of Maya centers and partsof the southern Maya lowlands in the ad900s, Spanish conquest in the 1500s,forced settlement nucleation, conversion to Christianity, and depopulation dueto foreign diseases. Today we at least can record people’s beliefs revolvingaround present rites even though they themselves can vary, as Lee (1998, 2000)illustrates in the Mennonite case. For example, in the Lacandon village of Najáin southeastern Chiapas, Mexico, the Maya are still largely non-Christian andpractice the “old” ways (McGee 1990 : 6 – 7); however, on their list of principaldeities (1990 : Table 6.1) is at least one new god, Akyantho, a postconquest ad-dition (p. 22). Akyantho “is the god of foreigners and commerce. . . . he lookslike a light-skinned foreigner wearing a hat and carrying a pistol. . . . He is alsoresponsible for the existence of foreign objects such as medicine, hard liquor,cattle, horses, and disease” (p. 65). Jesus Christ (Hesuklistos) is recognized as a minor, though foreign, deity (p. 70), but not one to be worshiped by the Lacandon (p. 126).60Water and Ritual03-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 60"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Most Maya, however, have converted to one form of Christianity or an-other. Consequently, many of their rituals, while materially the same as thoseof prehispanic ones, serve as the expressive core of a different ideology and re-ligion. For example, in the Yucatán village of Chan Kom, Robert Redfield andAlfonso Villa Rojas (1934 : 83) note that traditional agricultural ceremonies aretied to the religious calendar of the Catholic Church, especially saints’ days.Shamans (h-menob) lead ceremonies and use ritual equipment from the past,including crystals for divination and gourds for drinking a sacred alcoholicdrink (balche) (pp. 74 – 75). They also still believe in “pagan” gods, includingbalams (“guardians of the milpa and village”),chaacs (“gods of rain”), andkuilobkaaxob(“deities of the forest”) (pp. 112 – 113).Shamans are also involved in the “new house” or dedication ceremony (e.g.,Redfield and Villa Rojas 1934 : 146), a practice found throughout the Christianand non-Christian Maya world. Dedication rituals are performed to animatenew houses and other objects. Part of such rituals includes the caching of ob-jects under house floors. For example, Evon Vogt (1993 : 52 –55) describes thetwo stages of the dedication ceremony during and after house construction forthe Catholic Zinacantan Maya of highland Chiapas. During construction,builders bury the heads of sacrificed chickens in the floor with other offerings.Afterward, a shaman performs rites to compensate the Earth Lord for the ma-terials he has provided as well as to “summon the ancestral gods to provide thehouse with an innate soul” (Vogt 1993 : 52). Again, more offerings are buried inthe floor of the new house (Vogt 1970 : 78, 98; see also Wauchope 1938 : 143). Partof the rite includes reciting prayers to the gods, including references to theChristian God, the Virgin Mary, and Jesus Christ (Vogt 1993 : 53 –54).In Chichicastenango of highland Guatemala, Ruth Bunzel (1952) notes similar syncretic practices. The Quiché Maya, while mostly Catholic, also stillconduct “housebuilding” ceremonies (p. 37) led by a shaman (p. 77). They clas-sify power into at least nine realms, which involve both Christian and non-Christian elements (pp. 266 – 267): “The World”; phenomena of nature; saints;“idols” (ancient); “forces of destiny.... The ‘twelve-thirteen moons and stars’(i.e., time and destiny); the 260 days of the sacred... and the life-token ani-mals of individuals”; death bringers —“The Lord of Sickness and Pain”; mas-ters of useful activities, including the patron deities of agriculture, weaving,business, industry, writing, midwifery, medicine, divination, and sorcery; Lordsof Justice (e.g., deceasedalcaldesor leaders); and souls of the dead — the “firstpeople,” the common souls, and one’s own ancestors.The ancestors are the most important supernatural component in the life ofthe Quiché Maya, however, as well as among other Maya groups. “The powerswhose influence on human affairs is continuous and unremitting are the ances-tors, who represent the great moral force” (Bunzel 1952 : 269).

Among the Zi-nacantecos, ancestral gods are even more important than the Earth Lord (Vogt1970 : 6). Ancestor veneration rites are thus performed to honor and thank an-cestors. Part of such rituals involves keeping an ancestor’s remains close tohome and making offerings. Although ancestors live in sacred places such ascaves or mountains, at least through colonial times their physical remains andofferings were kept close to home, buried in the floors of houses, as Bishop deLanda describes for colonial Yucatán (Tozzer 1941 : 130). In the ethnographicpresent, most people are buried in cemeteries or in plots near the home; but asR. Jon McGee (1990 : 117, 1998) describes among the Lacandon, the dead arestill buried with grave goods; “A variety of grave goods including both food andthe deceased’s personal possessions are left at the gravesite” (1990 : 117).Termination rites are part of the renewal ceremony — for the new year, forexample, or after the death of a family member when life must begin anew. Forexample, in the Lacandon village of Najá, if a dead person’s spirit does not leavepeople in peace, the family moves to a new house (McGee 1990 : 115). Termina-tion rituals also are performed to deactivate or deanimate houses or objects,thus releasing their soul before being renewed. Part of such rituals includesbreaking objects, partially destroying houses, and burning incense. For the newyear in colonial Mexico, Bishop de Landa notes, “To celebrate it with more so-lemnity, they renewed on this day all the objects which they made use of, suchas plates, vessels, stools, mats and old clothes and the stuffs with which theywrapped up their idols. They swept out their houses . . .” (Tozzer 1941 : 151) anddeposited old items as contaminated sacred trash outside of town (p. 152). Sim-ilarly, among the Lacandon, a feature of the renewal ceremony is the manufac-ture of new incense-burners, the building of new fires, and the use of new util-itarian goods (Tozzer 1907 : 106). Old incensarios, jars, and other items are“terminated,” taken out of habitation areas to a nearby cliff, and deposited in aspecific place below a ledge, thus signifying the end of the termination /renewalceremonies (Tozzer 1907 : 146 – 147).“Smashing objects [also] constitutes one way of deactivating, or de-animat-ing, them and releasing the soul” (Stross 1998 : 37). For example, throughoutMesoamerica, ritually abandoning a house involves pulling down parts of thehouse (e.g., corner posts, roof ), burning incense, reciting prayers, and makingofferings (Stross 1998). Among the Lacandon of Najá, when god pots — in-cense burners — are replaced with new ensouled /animated /dedicated ones, theold ones are ritually killed and discarded.During the transitional period before new god pots are completed, the oldincense burners, which are about to die, are taken down from their storage62Water and Ritual03-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 62"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"shelf in the god house, placed on a mat of palm leaves facing east, and feddaily offerings.

The old incenseburners, which have sat covered in the corner for the past several days, are care-fully collected and taken to a dry limestone cave about an hour’s walk from thecommunity. There, amid the smoke from burning incense, the god pots arecovered with palm leaves and abandoned. . . . The vessels are left in caves,which are considered sacred and dangerous places because they are passages to the Underworld. (McGee 1998 : 45)Ethnographic and colonial case studies play a key role in revealing past rit-ual actions. The rituals just described clearly have a long history, around whichvaried and changing beliefs have revolved. These examples dramatically illus-trate the central role that ritual plays in creating the material world, a fact alsodemonstrated in the archaeological record. For example, when a Maya templewas ritually destroyed, rulers and elites burned incense and left old brokenitems as offerings, after which a new temple was constructed over the old anddedicated with the caching of new whole objects (Freidel and Schele 1989; Gar-ber 1986, 1989; Schele and Freidel 1990 : 104 – 108). Even though there is ex-treme diversity in structure configuration, size, and function among commonerhouses, elite compounds, and palaces and temples, current evidence indicatesthat they have structurally and functionally similar depositional (ritual) histo-ries (e.g., Becker 1992; Gillespie 2000a; Haviland 1981, 1988; McAnany 1995 : 97;Walker and Lucero 2000; Willey et al. 1965). This can be attributed to com-mon dedication, ancestor veneration, and termination rituals (practices I dem-onstrate in Chapters 4, 5, and 6).Identifying Ancient Maya Rituals: ExpectationsBuilding and destroying houses relates to the life history of ancestors. Thedeath of an important family member often represents the need for a newhouse, which means the old one has to be razed and terminated and a new onebuilt and dedicated. Dedication, ancestor veneration, and termination ritesthus cannot be viewed singly but must be seen as inextricably linked ritualevents; they are a vital component of the construction process. It is impossibleMaya Rituals6303-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 63"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"to separate ritual activities and construction events — they are practically oneand the same. Consequently, the depositional histories of Maya structuresreflect a continuous flow of ritual behaviors. They also reflect how critical theserites were to everyone, high and low — as well as how they were excellently suit-able for political replication and expansion.I posit that political aspirants began to expand traditional rituals during theLate Preclassic (ca. 250 bc–ad250) and continued to do so, culminating inlarge-scale royal rites in the Early Classic (ca. ad250 –550) and a direct associ-ation of royal families with the supernatural or divine forces by the Late Clas-sic (ca. ad550 – 850). Incrementally, Maya rulers conducted rites in progres-sively larger-scale settings (e.g., houses to elite compounds to temples andpalaces), incorporating ever-larger groups of people.If Maya rulers replicated and expanded household rituals, then we shouldfind evidence for such rituals at commoner houses, elite residences, royal pal-aces, and temples beginning in the Late Preclassic. Rituals should be repre-sented in depositional histories that arestructurallyandfunctionallysimilar butincrease in scale.Differences between commoner, elite, and royal ritual depositsconsist of increasing quality, quantity, and diversity of deposited items and set-ting (structure types). For example, all members of Maya society cached exoticobsidian objects (e.g., Olson 1994): commoners cached small blades in houses,elites more and longer blades in larger houses with small public courtyards, androyals more and longer blades as well as skillfully carved objects in palaces andtemples (Krejci and Culbert 1995). Obsidian was used for multiple purposes —as cutting implements, for bloodletting, and perhaps as small versions of “ec-centrics.” Whatever their function, the point is that everyone, rich and poor,relinquished forever — sacrificed — items acquired through long-distance ex-change networks. Before the advent of monarchs, all people in society cachedmore or less the same quantities of similarly shaped obsidian in their houses.During the rise of rulers, one begins to see increasing diversity in form andquantity in commoner, elite, and royal caches. The caching of obsidian neverleft the home but was taken to new levels in conjunction with the rise of rulersin larger public forums (e.g., Hendon 1999; Ringle 1999).Termination deposits and dedication caches are typically found in the cen-ters of rooms (e.g., Garber 1986, 1989). Burials are typically found in the south-east corner of small residences (e.g., Willey et al. 1965) and the eastern struc-tures of elite plazuelas or compounds (e.g., Belize Valley, southeastern Petén)(Garber et al. 1998). Caches, other ritual deposits, and burials in palaces andtemples are often located at the primary axis on top of or under floors and stairs(Ashmore 1991; Loten and Pendergast 1984 : 5; Pendergast 1998).Dedication caches are foundunderfloors and usually consist of burned orunburned whole objects such as jade, obsidian, groundstone fragments, lithic64Water and Ritual03-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 64"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"eccentrics, and ceramic vessels (some lip-to-lip) (Becker 1992; Coe 1959 : 77 – 78,1965a; e.g., Chase and Chase 1998; Garber 1989 : 98; Mock 1998). Major differ-ences among commoner, elite, and royal caches include the quality, quantity,and diversity of offerings and location. For example, I would expect to find shellbeads in houses, jade beads in elite structures, and more diverse forms andquantities of jade objects in public monumental temples and palaces (e.g., Gar-ber 1989 : 67).Evidence for ancestor veneration rites consists of burials and offerings un-der structure floors (e.g., Gillespie 2000a; McAnany 1995 : 535). Again, majordifferences among nonelite, elite, and royal burials include location and thequality, quantity, and diversity of grave goods. Commoner Maya buried theirdead in the floors of their houses. In elite residences, the Maya built shrines to their ancestors, usually the eastern structure of their residential compound.Royals took this practice to new heights and buried their dead in a special place,the royal acropolis. The Maya buried the most powerful royal personages in fu-nerary temples (e.g., Temple of the Inscriptions, Palenque).Termination deposits are foundon top offloors and are typically broken andburned, such as smashed ceramic vessels and burned items (Coe 1965a; Gar-ber 1986, 1989; e.g., Rice 1999). Major differences among commoner, elite, androyal deposits include the quality, quantity, and diversity of offerings and loca-tion. I expect to find a few smashed vessels in commoner houses, greater num-bers and fancier polychrome vessels in elite residences, and more diverse formsand quantities of vessels with incised or painted hieroglyphs from monumentalarchitecture. In addition, termination rituals in monumental public architec-ture are evidenced by the destruction of stone and stuccoed sculpture, the ef-facing of painted and carved portraits of rulers and deities, and the whitewash-ing of painted walls (Becker 1992; Garber 1989 : 9).Concluding RemarksDuring the Postclassic period (ca. ad950 – conquest), after rulers disappearedfrom the southern Maya lowlands, the Maya continued to conduct rituals wherethey originated, in the home. Instead of participating in household, commu-nity, and royal rites as they did beginning in the Late Preclassic through theLate / Terminal Classic periods, Maya farmers now only participated in house-hold and community rites (the latter still funded and organized by wealthylandowners or elites). This pattern is evidenced throughout the postcollapseMaya world (e.g., Lucero and Brown 2002; Lucero, McGahee, and Corral2002; Masson 1997; Willey et al. 1965).In this chapter I have attempted to illustrate the key role of ritual in dailyMaya Rituals6503-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 65"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"life, past and present. The critical importance of ritual lends itself to manipu-lation by ambitious political agents.

This pattern is particularly noticeableat sites with long occupation histories spanning the periods before, during, andafter the advent of rulership, which I illustrate in the following chapters. I alsoincorporate ritual data from other southern lowland centers to examine struc-turally and functionally similar ritual histories.66Water and Ritual03-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 66"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4Community and the Maya:The Ritual History of Saturday CreekIn this chapter I detail the distinguishing features of community organizations(see Table 1.1) and Maya minor centers, which have several factors in common(see Table 2.1). I also present the history of ritual activities at Saturday Creek,a minor river center without rulers or any other royal trappings. My intent is toshow that all Maya conducted the same rites, whether or not they were taxpay-ers, and whether or not they were royal.Community OrganizationIn community organizations, farmers live in villages and practice swidden orsmall-scale intensive agriculture as well as hunt and fish. Relatively low popu-lation densities result in fewer demands on the land. Farmers depend on sea-sonal rainfall and do not rely on water or agricultural systems. Wealth differ-ences exist and are expressed in differential access to resources, exotics, labor,and other goods. Political power typically does not develop, because resourcesare relatively extensive, stable, and plentiful (e.g., Kirch 1994). Consequently,there is no need for capital to maintain water/agricultural systems, though elitescan provide food to people in need from their own stores. Elites typically attaingreater wealth as a result of their being the first settlers and monopolizing thebest resources (e.g., Carmean and Sabloff 1996; Marcus 1983). As a result, theirpower lies in the respect they are shown as founding families, for example, inmaking decisions involving the entire community (e.g., lineage chiefs, villageheadmen). Land is corporately owned, though chiefs /elites may own othermeans of production, such as fishing canoes. Relations are typically heterar-chical, since wealth differences do not translate into a monopoly on politicalpower. “Heterarchy may be defined as the relation of elements of one anotherwhen they are unranked or when they possess the potential for being ranked in04-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 67"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"68Water and Rituala number of different ways” (Crumley 1995b:3). For example, Marajo Island atthe mouth of the Amazon was occupied for approximately a millennium, untilca. ad1100 (Roosevelt 1999 : 23):The general picture from the Marajoara cultural remains . . . is of populous,wealthy, but apparently uncentralized, societies. Their populations lived insometimes sizable, long-term communities atop large-scale earth construc-tions, taking sustenance from fish, horticultural crops, and orchards. They cre-ated highly elaborate and often monumental art, and craft objects that wereavailable to all residential groups, although in somewhat different quality andquantity.A major factor that prevented the development of centralized power is that in-habitants of Marajo Island had the option to flee into uninhabited jungle areas.Elites, as landowners or owners of other critical resources, compensate peoplefor goods and services rendered, including manufacturing prestige goods, work-ing elites’ land, and building their homes, shrines, and community structures(e.g., ritual architecture). Compensation comes in the form of food and accessto resources and /or prestige goods, which the elites obtain as participants in aregional elite interaction sphere (long-distance exchange). Commoners, how-ever, also are involved in the exchange of utilitarian and prestige items withtheir cohorts, typically without elite interference. An element of choice is in-volved since people can choose for whom and when to perform tasks for otherswho can afford to pay. Patron-client relations can fall in this category, eventhough over time clients may have little choice but to work for a patron due todebts owed. Patrons, however, also have obligations to their clients to take careof them in times of trouble or need.A key issue is that there ismore than onewealthy individual or family ratherthan a sole political leader (Fried 1967 : 26 –32; Marcus 1983). To promote soli-darity in the face of wealth differences, however, elites sponsor communityfeasts, performances, and religious rites and organize the building of small-scale public works (e.g., religious structures, terraces, and canals). These activ-ities also serve to increase their prestige as pillars of the community. Householdrites typically involve ancestors and fertility, since they are critical to everyone’ssurvival (Fried 1967 : 138). Ancestors are typically represented in a stylized man-ner in various media, such as body decoration, sacred items, shields, and ban-ners (e.g., clan totems or emblems) (Durkheim 1995 [1912] : 111 – 117). Peoplehave no need of writing or recording systems, because each lineage is respon-sible for maintaining and passing on family oral histories.Communities may or may not interact with a centralized or integrative po-litical system. For example, rulers of the Kedah state in Malaysia (ad700 –04-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 68"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Community and the Maya691500) had peer relations with foreign trade partners (e.g., from China, Viet-nam, Thailand, and India) and equal, heterarchical relations with inhabitantsof the forest far upstream, with whom they exchanged foreign goods for forestproducts (e.g., timber) necessary for trade (Allen 1999). Whether or not theyinteract with larger polities, small-scale raiding for food and land (and somepolitical reasons) is endemic but regulated (Fried 1967 : 178). Feuding is kept incheck by lineage elders, village headmen, and any other person of respect (e.g.,Leach 1970 [1954] : 184 – 185). There are various reasons why elites do not havemuch political power in addition to the material factors mentioned above.David Small (1995) discusses how external trade can prohibit the developmentof hierarchical organization, because opportunities to participate are open toall. For example, the kula ring (interisland trade) of the Trobriand Islands is ac-cessible to all men for trading and creating alliances ( Johnson and Earle 2000 :272). Other social organizations that keep relations nonhierarchical are kinshipsystems, age-sets, and specialists (magicians, sorcerers, rain-makers), as foundamong several precolonial African societies, including Tellensi farmers andNuer and Logoli Bantu cattle herders and farmers (Evans-Pritchard 1940; Fortes1940; Wagner 1940).Communities are stable and have lengthy histories, as long as there areenough resources to sustain people and as long as people can adapt to chang-ing conditions (e.g., long-term climate change). And “because of their broader,grassroots base, heterarchical formations appear to achieve more political sta-bility and cultural longevity than hierarchical systems imposed from above bysmall ruling groups” (Roosevelt 1999 : 14). For example, in the Maya lowlands,many communities continued long after the collapse of the political hierarchy,with little change. At Laguna de On in northern Belize, Marilyn Masson (1997)posits that communities rather than the earlier civic-ceremonial centers becamethe focal point for political, social, and economic organization.I illustrate a community organization through a brief description of the Tro-briand Islanders ( Johnson and Earle 2000 : 267 – 280). The Trobriand Islandsare located north of New Guinea, with unvaried resources. Islanders practiceintensive agriculture (e.g., taro gardens) and fish. However, they do not buildwater/agricultural systems. Important staples are yams, which are stored, andtaro. They are dependent on seasonal rainfall, and periods of drought can re-sult in famine. When this happens, chiefs’ stores of yams become critical. Tro-briand Islanders live in village clusters, and chiefs reside in larger villages. Eachlineage (dala) has a chief, and the lineages are ranked. Chiefly lineages arewealthier than other lineages, indicated by their larger houses and storage fa-cilities. They acquire part of their wealth through dowry, a particularly lucra-tive strategy, as chiefs have several wives — not to mention more alliances andexchange partners. Chiefs also own canoes necessary for fishing but do not own04-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 69"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"70Water and Ritualland. Land is corporately owned by eachdala.Consequently, there are nochiefly territories per se, only alliances and ties with nearby villages. Some menhave the means and connections (alliances) to participate in the kula ring forsubsistence and prestige goods (see Malinowski 1984 [1922]), which they ex-change with people who do not participate in the kula ring. Chiefs, while theydo not necessarily acquire tribute, do demand payment for use of their canoesand for food provided during famine. Raiding can occur during times of fam-ine as well as for “political purposes” ( Johnson and Earle 2000 : 271).Household and village rites revolve around ancestors and clan totems (Ma-linowski 1984 [1922] : 63, 72 – 73). Garden magicians and other ritual specialistsact for the entire community, and each village has one (p. 59). Public rites takeplace in open, ceremonial areas, located in chiefly villages. Ceremonies involvethe ancestral spirits critical to Trobriand life (pp. 421 – 424). Symbols representclam totems, spirits, and witches (e.g., Anderson 1989 [1979] : Figure 5.3).The Trobriand Islanders traditionally live in a relatively stable society be-cause they do not over-use resources and have social mechanisms to offset foodshortages and other seasonal problems (e.g., sharing stored foods).Such societies have several factors in common with the Maya who lived inminor centers during the Late Classic (ca. ad550 – 850), particularly the lack ofpolitical leaders and material conditions that were not conducive for the emer-gence of rulers.The Maya: Minor CentersMinor centers such as Barton Ramie and Saturday Creek are located on the Be-lize River on a relatively broad alluvium (1 – 2+ km wide) on the eastern periph-ery of the southern Maya lowlands (see Figure 2.1). They appear to be some ofthe earliest and longest-occupied settlements (e.g., 900 bc–ad1500), which isnot surprising given their prime location in an area with plentiful water andland. These centers are located in lower elevations (20 – 40\u0004m asl) and havehigher annual rainfall than the majority of regional centers (Figure 4.1) —216 cmat Saturday Creek, similar to that of Barton Ramie, 25 km away. The naturallymoist alluvial soils on the terraces above the river are excellently suited for cashcrops such as cacao and cotton (Gómez-Pompa et al. 1990), not to mentionmaize, beans, and squash. The relatively dispersed settlement suggests that an-cient Maya farmers planted fields interspersed among their houses (Drennan1988; Killion 1990) or that landlords or estate owners living in the center or ab-sentee limited settlement and set or determined planting schedules. Farmersdid not need to use water/agricultural systems, because water was plentiful;04-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 70"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Community and the Maya71Figure 4.1.Elevation and annual rainfall at southern Maya lowland centersfarmers relied on the annual rising and subsiding of rivers for agriculture (re-cession agriculture). Annual inundation of the poorly drained soils of the lowerterraces deterred the Maya from building or planting too close to the river. Forexample, at Saturday Creek occupants lived dispersed on the upper terracesalong the Belize River and avoided the lower, poor-draining terraces that areseasonally inundated (Lucero n.d.b).The Belize valley, due to its location and elevation, also benefited from annual runoff from Guatemala, Mexico, and western Belize, which suppliedenough water for everyone throughout the year. The downside of runoff is thatit often results in flooding and the deposition of clayey soils, which can remainsaturated for most of the year. For example, in 1998 at Saturday Creek the lowerriver terrace was inundated during May and June, the end of the dry season. InMay and June of 1999, however, the lower terrace was completely dry. Thelower terrace was also devoid of prehispanic settlement, suggesting that the ter-race was frequently inundated in the past. The Maya probably planted severalcrops a year as farmers do at present, indicating a lesser need for storage, whichwould explain why we do not find evidence for storage facilities (Lucero n.d.a).04-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 71"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"72Water and RitualThese communities were composed of relatively low densities of dispersedfarmsteads (e.g., 100 – 151 structures /km2; Lucero et al. 2004; Rice and Culbert1990 : Table 1.1; Willey et al. 1965 : 573). A major factor preventing elites from ac-quiring political power was their inability to restrict plentiful water and exten-sive alluvium and integrate dispersed farmers. Further, even if elites owned allthe land, farmers clearly had the option to leave if elite demands became tooonerous. Not relying on water/agricultural systems meant that there was noneed for farmers to rely on the benevolence of political leaders to supply capi-tal to repair damage. Communities, however, may have been subsumed undera regional polity, depending on factors such as distance from major centers and accessibility (e.g., Scarborough et al. 2003). For example, Olivier de Mont-mollin (1989 : 203) suggests that some valley areas around Tenam Rosario in theUsumacinta lowlands might have been elite or royal cotton and cacao estates.This might have been the case in other valley areas. Current evidence does notindicate involvement in warfare; if inhabitants did participate in aggressive actsagainst others, their involvement likely related to whether or not they were in-volved in regional politics.Wealth differences account for various-sized residences and other signs ofwealth rather than political power (e.g., Carmean and Sabloff 1996); elites com-pensated the workers who built their larger homes and worked their fieldsrather than exacted tribute (e.g., with prestige goods and access to land) (e.g.,Potter and King 1995). Elites attained their wealth as a result of being the firstsettlers and owning the best and /or the largest plots of land; they acquired sta-tus as founding families, which was expressed by how members reacted to theircommunity-wide decisions (e.g., Carmean and Sabloff 1996; McAnany 1995 :96 – 97; Tedlock 1985 : 204 – 205; Tozzer 1941 : 25 – 26). Consequently, greaterwealth was not concentrated in the hands of one person or family but dispersedamong several elite families. Elites participated to some degree in the elite inter-action sphere through personal ornamentation, ceremonies, and long-distanceexchange (e.g., exotic goods such as small jade and obsidian items) (Chase andChase 1992).Farmers and elites also traded their produce with Maya living in different ar-eas. For example, in the upper Belize River area, there is evidence that valleyfarmers, who may or may not have been beholden to rulers at the nearest cen-ters of El Pilar or Yalbac, acquired ceramic vessels and chert tools from Mayaliving in the foothills. The foothills have less productive agricultural soils, butplentiful raw materials for ceramic and lithic production (chert outcrops, clays,and tempers) (Ford 1990, 1991a; Lucero 2001 : 65 – 67). This type of exchangetook place without elite interference (e.g., Scarborough et al. 2003). Conse-quently, even if Maya at minor centers were not integrated within a larger po-litical system, they still interacted with their peers in other areas; after all, they04-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 72"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Community and the Maya73were still members of a broader society and so identified themselves by acquir-ing value-laden items recognizable throughout the Maya world.Elites sponsored local small-scale public rituals and feasts at small temples,usually not exceeding 10 m in height and relatively small plazas, and organizedthe construction of public works to promote solidarity in the face of wealth dif-ferences (Arie 2001; Lucero et al. 2004). Maya farmers also conducted rites intheir homes, agricultural fields, and sacred places (e.g., caves and water bodies).There is no obvious public iconographic evidence for water imagery or rulers atsuch centers, which, by contrast, is pervasive on monumental architecture,sculpture, and mobile goods at some secondary and all regional centers. Elitesdid not keep a written record; nor did they have the means, or right, to makeuse of emblem glyphs.Terminal Classic (ca. ad850 – 950) events were pretty much the same as dur-ing the Late Classic. Minor centers were stable and lasted as long as there wereenough resources to sustain people (Lucero 2002a). For example, the Maya oc-cupied Saturday Creek and Barton Ramie long after they deserted secondaryand regional centers, though population size gradually decreased throughoutthe Postclassic (ca. ad950 – 1500) (Conlon and Ehret 2002; Willey et al. 1965).The long occupation histories (ca. 900 bc–ad1500) raise the question as towhy rulers did not emerge, an issue I address in Chapter 7.Ritual History of Saturday CreekSaturday Creek is located along the Belize River on an extensive floodplain(20 m asl) in central Belize on the eastern periphery of the southern Maya low-lands (see Figure 2.1).1Settlement was dispersed (100 – 151 structures /km2; Lu-cero et al. 2004) and consisted of solitary mounds (67%,n\u000353), mound groupsor plazuelas, a ball court, and small temples (up to ca. 10 m tall) (Figure 4.2).The Valley of Peace Archaeology (VOPA) project, which I directed, mapped79 structures within a 0.81 km2area bounded by roads on the north side of theriver. Most of the site is located in a plowed field that is currently intensivelycultivated by Mennonite farmers; they plow it at least twice a year and plantmaize, beans, watermelon, or black-eyed peas. Consequently, mounds in theplowed field have been reduced in height and spread in areal extent. A largeportion of the site (ca. 350 \u0005300 m), including the center core, has not beenplowed. The core area has not been mapped in its entirety due to dense sec-ondary growth (noted in Figure 4.2). Saturday Creek’s former inhabitants in-cluded farmers, part-time specialists (e.g., potters had ample supplies of clayand water), and elite landowners. Elites procured exotics, such as obsidian andjade items, albeit small and simple ones. Commoners also acquired these objects04-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 73"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Figure 4.2.Saturday Creek04-T3558 12/20/05 4:42 PM Page 74"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Community and the Maya75but in even smaller sizes and quantities — either as gifts or compensation fromelites or through exchange with peers in other areas. Elites also organized thebuilding of the ball court and temples.There were no rulers, no tribute payments, no water or agricultural systems,no royal palaces, and no inscriptions; neither did Saturday Creek’s residentscreate public iconography or use emblem glyphs. Saturday Creek was a stableand long-lasting community that was occupied from at least 900 bcthroughad1500 (Conlon and Ehret 2002). The nearest center is Yalbac, a secondarycenter 18 km to the northwest, and inhabitants of Saturday Creek may have hadsome kind of interaction with them. Even if the Maya at Saturday Creek werenot politically incorporated into a larger polity, they were without questionmembers of a larger society and interacted through social and economic ex-changes (e.g., lithic tools from foothill or upland areas). Surface collections andexcavated materials from Saturday Creek residences and from houses up-riverindicate their relative wealth, not to mention long-distance contacts (e.g., Pa-chuca obsidian from central Mexico, polished hematite items, jade, and marineshell) (Lucero 1997, 2002b).To maximize the range of ritual activities, in 2001 we excavated several struc-ture types: two solitary mounds or commoner residences, SC-18 and SC-85; aneastern structure of an elite compound, SC-78; and a temple ball court, SC-3(Lucero 2002b) (see Figure 4.2). In general, at each structure we began by bi-secting the mound with a 2-meter-wide trench. At the two solitary mounds, wethen horizontally exposed several living floors, excavating about 60% of SC-18and 75% of SC-85. The large size of SC-78 only permitted us to bisect its widthwith a 2-meter-wide trench and excavate several 2 \u00052 m test pits placed withinstructure rooms (determined using post-hole testing). This method resulted inour exposing about 20% of the mound. We excavated a 1-meter-wide trench atSC-3, bisecting the temple, platform, and ball-court side wall and alley.We excavated following natural stratigraphy and used the Harris Matrixmethod of recording strata to highlight depositional sequences (see Harris1989). Ceramic analysis was conducted concurrent with excavations resulting in chronologies for each mound in 100- to 200-year increments (Conlon andEhret 2002). Analysis particularly focused on ceramic assemblages and theircontexts because the Maya used them as ritual paraphernalia for dedicatorycaches, grave goods, and termination deposits (Lucero 2003).SC-18 (10 \u00058 m, 1.24 m high) (Figure 4.3) is a commoner residence locatedca. 150 m northwest of the site core on prime alluvium. It has at least six con-struction phases dating from ca. ad400 through 1150 (Lucero and Brown2002). The Maya constructed several thin plaster floors (most with cobble bal-lasts 2 –5 cm thick), one on top of the other. Single or double-course boulderwalls provided the foundation for thatch or wattle-and-daub structures.

We recognized five of the six surfaces by their termination deposits rather than plaster floors; the surrounding clayserode plaster. The Maya occupied SC-85 from at least ca. ad400 through 1150.It is located in an area of secondary growth just east of the plowed Mennonitefields and does not appear to have been plowed.Residents of SC-85 were less wealthy than their counterparts at SC-18, a re-sult of their having lived surrounded by clayey, less productive soils.

Some structures have thick plaster floors,ballasts, and standing walls with cut stone blocks. The Maya also used wattle-and-daub buildings (Lucero, Graebner, and Pugh 2002). It has not been plowed,as far as we know, but was being used as a milpa in 2001. The Maya lived at Sat-urday Creek at least by 600 bcthrough ad1500, though ceramics dating to ca.1000 bcwere found in lower fill contexts. While domestic artifacts were recov-ered from several contexts, their frequency and density are noticeably lowerthan at SC-18 and SC-85. Their relative scarcity might indicate that fewerpeople lived here and /or that some structures had specific functions (e.g., akitchen, storeroom, work area, shrine, or sweat bath).SC-3 (Figure 4.6) is a temple (5 \u00055 m, 2.44 m in height) oriented 10\u0006westof north on top of a stepped platform (48 \u000524 m, 3 m in height). It lies in thesite core surrounded by two plazas and has not been plowed. The last majorconstruction phase of the temple consists of a stone façade with a clay fill; someblocks are shaped, and some surfaces are plastered. We exposed an additionalten strata. A large looter’s trench runs from the far northern edge of the templedown to the southern edge of its substructure or platform, extending about10 m roughly north-south, 1.5 m to 3.5 m wide and from 1 to 2.5 m deep. Thewestern side of the platform contained the eastern half of a ball court ( Jeakle2002; Jeakle et al. 2002).The 1-m-wide excavation trench revealed several major construction phases,including steep, tiered walls and a platform with several construction phasesand plastered steps (Figure 4.7). Due to time constraints, we were not able toreach sterile at SC-3. Excavated material, however, dates from at least ca. 300bcto ad1500, though ceramics dating as early as 600 bcwere found in fill de-posits. We also excavated a 1 \u00051-m test unit on the top center of SC-2 (26\u000517 m, ca. 3 m high), the western half of the ball court, which likely dates to theLate Classic period.Due to the relatively limited extensive excavations undertaken at SaturdayCreek, I use ritual data from other comparable sites (Barton Ramie and Cuello)to illustrate that dedication, ancestor veneration, and termination rites have along history extending from before rulers to after they had long disappeared. Ihave no doubt that further excavations at Saturday Creek would have yieldedritual evidence similar to what I present from other sites.The Preclassic (1200 BC–AD 250)The only clear evidence for dedication rites at Saturday Creek occurs at the elitestructures (Table 4.1), which in all probability began as commoner structures,or at the very least houses not distinguishable from other early residences.

At SC-78,the elite residence, the thick clay construction fill, dating from 300 to 100 bc,yielded a dedication cache that included marine shells, a cut and polishedburned bone, notched and unnotched obsidian blades (Figure 4.8), biface thin-ning flakes, a chert core, tool, and blade, and burned faunal remains (Lucero,Graebner, and Pugh 2002) (see Figure 4.5). In the ball-court alley fill at SC-3we recovered a chert core, a notched obsidian blade, burned bone, and a mo-saic jade piece.No Preclassic burials were recovered at Saturday Creek, but burial data fromthe small secondary center of Cuello provide some of the best evidence avail-able for Preclassic burial patterns. During the Early Middle Preclassic (1200 –700 bc), most burials are located in house floors along with shell, ceramics, andsome jade items (Hammond 1995, 1999). A common grave good consisted ofan inverted bowl placed over the head. In the Late Middle Preclassic (700 –400bc) jade is found only in burials of males. In addition, burials start to appear in ancillary structures and community plazas. Finally, in the Late Pre-classic (400 bc–ad250), a large platform became the major locus for ceremo-nial activities and elite burials, the majority of which are males buried with exotic goods (Hammond et al. 1991; Robin and Hammond 1991). Domesticburials, in contrast, remained similar to those of earlier periods, usually includ-ing inverted vessels over the head as well as more diverse and exotic goods.Barton Ramie, a minor center along the Belize River similar to SaturdayCreek and heavily plowed by Mennonite farmers, also yielded Preclassic eliteburials.

Burial 3 at SC-85 is a bundle burial of an adolescent (ca.10 – 12 years of age) without grave goods (Figure 4.17). The extended and proneadult female at SC-85 (Burial 1) has filed incisors but was not buried with anygrave goods (Piehl 2002) (Figure 4.18).Due to the limited excavations at Saturday Creek elite structures, we did notfind any burials. At Barton Ramie, however, elite burials yielded, in addition tojade beads, at least three jade effigy pendants as well as typically more goods perburial (Willey et al. 1965 : 90, 549 –552). For example, grave goods interred withan adult (Burial 3) at BR-260 (ca. 40 \u000530 m with four mounds up to 2 m high)included three vessels, three obsidian blades, three carved bones, a jaguar-shapedjade pendant, and a polished celt (pp. 267 – 270, 557).We found termination deposits at all four structures, which are similar toearlier periods. They consist of smashed and burned vessels on surfaces. For ex-ample, at SC-18 we recovered three layers of burned and smashed ceramics,mostly body sherds (96%), some of which date to ad400 – 600. They had beendeposited on top of a textile or mat of some sort, which also had been burned(Figure 4.19). In a later termination event at SC-18, the Maya again burned andsmashed three layers of largely rimless ceramic sherds (8 rims or 3%; and266 body sherds or 97%); we also found a complete but broken bowl in the samedeposit, as well as burned bone and marine shells. Similarly, at SC-85, the Mayabroke and burned several items, including daub and ceramics; some sherds con-tain the long bones of a large mammal, likely a deer. They also placed an un-decorated miniature jar on a burned surface at ca. ad600 – 700. In what ap-pears to be a major termination event, the Maya at SC-85 burned and smashedceramics (10 different clusters, some not well-fired, with only a few rims) andoffered a Colha-chert tool, a ceramic bird or fish figurine fragment, an un-notched obsidian blade, marine shell, shaped serpentine, and a metate frag-ment (Figures 4.20 and 4.21).

In manycases, however, the smashed ceramic clusters in both elite and commoner con-texts largely consist of body sherds with few or no rims. The elite structure andtemple yielded, in addition to the above, drum vases, polychrome vessels,molded ceramic pieces, drilled and carved marine shell, powdered marl, burnedplaster fragments, and human bone. For example, sometime during the ninthcentury ad, the Maya at SC-78 burned an entire structure of wattle-and-daub(Figure 4.22). One wall collapsed on a deposit of several burned and smasheddecorated vessels (all body sherds), a human ulna placed on top of a large rim-less plate, an incised drilled marine shell pendant, and a drilled shell (Fig-ure 4.23). On the north edge of the platform at about ad600 – 700, the Mayaplaced a molded-face jar neck sherd and a notched obsidian blade against thelower platform step near a burned patch of plaster floor (Figure 4.24).

AD 950–1500): The Story ContinuesThe Maya continued to conduct the same traditional rites in the home long af-ter royals and upper elites ceased conducting theirs. At Saturday Creek, for ex-ample, the occupants of one of the small houses (SC-18) expanded the structuresouth; within fill dating to ca. ad900 – 1150, we found a notched obsidian blade(Table 4.4). In another expansion episode in the same area and period, theMaya added more fill and another floor, within which they had placed a pol-ished celt and an unnotched obsidian blade (Lucero and Brown 2002). Theother commoner house (SC-85) yielded a Postclassic burial (Burial 10) of aseated individual facing south (Figure 4.26). Time constraints prevented usfrom completely excavating the burial, but we were able to remove the offering,a complete large red dish (Daylight orange) that the Maya had inverted overthe head. We do not know if there were more offerings, since we only exposedthe head and shoulders.Evidence for even later rites comes from the elite compound at SaturdayCreek (SC-78). From a fill deposit dating to ca. ad1150 – 1500 on the far southof the mound, we recovered a chert blade tool and a shaped and polished multi-colored chert flake (Figure 4.27) (Lucero, Graebner, and Pugh 2002). An earlierfill deposit (ad900 – 1150) on the north side of the platform mound yielded apiece of jade. In a final example from Saturday Creek, we recovered cores, ma-rine shell, and notched obsidian from a fill deposit of the platform of the templeball court (SC-3) that dates to ca. ad900 – 1150 ( Jeakle et al. 2002).

BR-1, a mound 2 m in height and 28 m in diameter with 12 occupation phases dat-ing from ca. 100 bcto ad1200 (Willey et al. 1965 : 36), yielded an unbroken se-quence of ritual events.

Neither was buried with grave goods, thoughone of the burials might be that of a male (pp. 551 –552), a pattern that contrastssharply with earlier burial practices at this mound (see Tables 4.1, 4.2, 4.3).This pattern differs from BR-144 (1.5 m high, 35 \u000535 m).

Only two burials, both of fe-male adults (Burials 1 and 5), have grave goods; the former was buried with a“crescent-shaped object of limestone” (p. 553), and the latter with one vessel.While we did not recover obvious Postclassic termination deposits at Satur-day Creek, the Maya likely still performed rites at the end of an object’s life.This pattern continues into the Colonial period and into the present, as illus-trated in Chapter 3. Also, both Barton Ramie and Saturday Creek have beenheavily plowed during the last few decades, which has likely destroyed muchevidence for Postclassic termination and other ritual activities. Postclassic ritu-als are scarce or nonexistent, however, at major centers such as Tikal and Altarde Sacrificios. Their purpose as a place for royal rites decreased in significancewhen rulers lost power and centers were largely abandoned in the ad900s.04-T3558 12/20/05 4:43 PM Page 109"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Figure 4.26.Burial 10, SC-85.04-T3558 12/20/05 4:43 PM Page 110"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Community and the Maya111Summary and DiscussionAt Saturday Creek, ritual deposits at commoner residences SC-18 and SC-85remained basically the same throughout their entire occupation (ca. ad400 –1150). The earliest ritual deposits at the elite structure SC-78 (fill dating to ca.300 – 100 bc) are similar (that is, simpler and smaller in scale) to those found atthe two solitary commoner mounds (SC-18 and SC-85) throughout both com-moner houses’ entire occupation (e.g., marine shell, obsidian blade fragments,and undecorated vessels). This pattern signifies that earlier, commoner ritualdeposits at SC-78 are the same as at the two commoner residences and thatlater, elite buildings have increasingly more diverse goods. As to the signifi-cance of notched obsidian blades, they may have served as smaller or commonerversions of eccentrics. The ceramic clusters with only a relatively few rim sherdsneed explaining; perhaps depositing ceramics without rims was a way to killvessels in both dedication and termination rituals. In addition, the inclusion ofolder vessels as termination offerings might indicate the sacrifice of heirloomobjects (e.g., R. Joyce 2000).Evidence for ancestor veneration rites does not noticeably change at com-moner residences in over 500 years at Saturday Creek and longer elsewhere. Itappears that only select people were buried in houses, particularly adults of bothsexes, but mostly males (Sanchez and Piehl 2002; e.g., Haviland 1997). Thesepractices are similar to those seen at small residences at Cuello, Barton Ramie,Figure 4.27.A polychrome polished chert flake tool from the south side ofSC-78. 1 cm scale.04-T3558 12/20/05 4:43 PM Page 111"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"112Water and RitualAltar de Sacrificios, and Tikal (see Chapters 5 and 6). While the burial patternspresented in this chapter are simple, they actually involve complex ritual be-haviors. For example, when the residents of SC-18 buried the adult of Burial 5,they first dug a pit, which they filled with flakes and burned and broken pot-tery (Lucero and Brown 2002). They placed the antler in the center of the pit,after which they put in fill and the deceased individual. They added more filland then burned and smashed more ceramics. Afterward, they added the manoand metate fragments and more ceramics and placed more fill (dirt). Finally,they burned more items and placed vessels just south of the skull and burnedthe entire deposit again.The Maya conducted small-scale rituals inside the home for family mem-bers. Some rituals were conducted privately in the elite compound, and someprobably involved community members. Its location on a terrace facing a plazaoverlooking the majority of Saturday Creek’s inhabitants provided both privacy(it is not visible from below) and an arena for public participation. The morediverse and exotic offerings also distinguished elites at SC-78. Communal orvoluntary labor likely built the temple ball court. There is evidence (faunal re-mains, decorated serving vessels) of feasting near or in the ball-court alley,which elites sponsored for Saturday Creek’s inhabitants. In her analysis ofSpanish Lookout (ad700 – 900) ceramic forms and faunal remains from theplatform and ball-court alley, Julie Jeakle (2002) found noticeable differencesbetween SC-3 assemblages and those from houses, especially the commonerones. While SC-3 had the lowest ceramic density of the four excavated sites, ityielded a high proportion of large serving vessels. Further, several kinds ofbowls were only found at SC-3 and were probably used during feasts. Finally,Jeakle noted that excavated materials from the ball-court alley yielded the high-est percentage of large mammal remains (e.g., deer) and turtle carapaces. Nofaunal remains were recovered from the temple on top, where Maya elites con-ducted private dedication and termination (and probably ancestor veneration)rituals not visible from the ball-court alley below, at least in the Classic period,when the platform was built up. A similar scenario likely occurred at BartonRamie.With plentiful water and land throughout the year, the Maya at SaturdayCreek lived a comfortable existence without the worry and bother of outside in-terference. The lack of obvious water systems and public imagery does not in-dicate a lesser reliance on gods and ancestors for rain, but rather a lesser needfor assistance from other mortals. As members of a larger society, however, theyparticipated in creating and defining Maya social and cultural worldviews. De-spite the fact that kings did not emerge at Saturday Creek, elites still conductedtraditional rituals at the community level to offset potential conflict in the faceof wealth differences and to promote solidarity.04-T3558 12/20/05 4:43 PM Page 112"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Community and the Maya113In conclusion, we can better understand how the Maya lived at minor cen-ters through knowledge of their community organization. The only noticeabledifference between the general definition of community organization and mi-nor centers is that we do not know about land ownership per se, though it wasprobably both corporate and private. We must assume that, even if the Mayadid not fight as warriors, there was probably some type of conflict (e.g., feud-ing). And while there is no political iconography or obvious decorative elementon monumental architecture, decorations on portable items (e.g., vessels andincised bone) were significant to the Maya and still reflected the critical im-portance of ancestors and the gods.04-T3558 12/20/05 4:43 PM Page 113"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5Local Rulers and the Maya:The Ritual History of Altar de SacrificiosIn this chapter I detail the distinguishing features of local polities (see Table 1.1)and secondary Maya centers, which have several factors in common (see Ta-ble 2.1). I also present a history of ritual activities at Altar de Sacrificios, a sec-ondary Maya center.Local PolityDepending on individual circumstances, a local polity can be viewed as sev-eral politically integrated communities — versus economically integrated ones,which they typically are. Farmers, who live in dispersed but densely settled vil-lages, rely more on intensive agriculture, including small-scale water/agricul-tural systems. They still must deal with the vagaries of annual rainfall, includingperiodic drought, flooding, or rain damage. These polities have both concen-trated (e.g., trade ports) and unrestricted (e.g., dispersed fertile land) resources.Hereditary leaders, whose positions are institutionalized, can acquire sometribute because of their ability to monopolize critical resources, especially whenseasonal food shortages or weather damages occur (Gilman 1981). Their maineconomic role, however, is not so much in ownership of the means of produc-tion but in their abilities to provide food from their own stores or via trade andcapital for the common good. Leaders live in central places such as large vil-lages or towns. Elites and political leaders (e.g., a paramount chief ) participatein the elite interaction sphere and regional politics. If local polities are in thesame area as a regional polity, they may be politically subsumed by the largerentity, though material conditions typically prevent their leaders from becom-ing monarchs of a centralized or integrative polity themselves. Territorial ex-tent includes the immediate area, including farmsteads and communities; and05-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 114"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Local Rulers and the Maya115chiefs sponsor and coordinate warfare for political purposes — to incorporatemore people and labor ( Johnson and Earle 2000 : 249).Political leaders participate in external exchange, particularly since nonlocalgoods, information, and ties play a major role in maintaining political power(Helms 1979). Consequently, such societies typically have trade ports and dif-ferential distribution of exotic goods, most of which are found in trade centersand less so at lower-order settlements. For example, Small (1995) describes howthe Yapese incorporated West Caroline Islands through controlling exchangevia patron-client relationships. Consequently, access to exotics and external tiesdistinguish leaders (Helms 1993). Commoners, however, still participate in theexchange of utilitarian and prestige goods with members of other communitiesand local polities, free from elite interference.Everyone participates in traditional household and community ancestor rites.In addition, chiefs perform rituals in public arenas large enough to hold peoplefrom several villages or communities that usually revolve around chiefly ances-tors as descendants of gods ( Johnson and Earle 2000 : 266), as well as fertility,rain, and war gods, which are depicted in the iconography. Individual people,however, are not portrayed, and writing or recording systems are not used.Internal relations check chiefs’ power and include subjects’ loyalty to theirown descent groups, social mobility, chiefly councils, competing chiefly or noblelineages, magicians, age-sets, warrior and secret societies, and ritual specialists.External relations also often act to curb centralized power; for example, in sev-eral precolonial African societies, subordinate chiefs are physically beyond thereach of paramount chiefs and can break away if tribute demands are too oner-ous or if the paramount chief is unjust (e.g., Zulu, Ngwato, Bemba, Banayan-kole, Kede) (Fortes and Evans-Pritchard 1940). Chiefs lead warfare parties of afew military specialists and part-time soldiers drawn from the ranks of villagesduring agricultural downtime to incorporate more tribute-payers, versus killingpeople and taking their land. Leaders have various kinds of relations with othergroups, both equal and unequal. For example, as mentioned in Chapter 4,rulers of the Kedah state in Malaysia (ad700 – 1500) had peer relations withforeign trade partners and equal, heterarchical relations with inhabitants of theforest far upstream, with whom they exchanged foreign goods for forest prod-ucts (e.g., timber) necessary for trade (Allen 1999). In addition, Kedah rulersalso had hierarchical relations with inland dry-land farming communities andsecondary centers mid-river who owed tribute to Kedah leaders (prestige goodsand rice), who in turn provided them with foreign goods and access to the for-eign market for their rice.In local polities, disruptions in political relations, elite interaction (e.g., di-minishing prestige-goods exchange), climate regimes, and resource availability05-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 115"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"116Water and Ritualreverberate throughout the political system (Flannery 1972), but not necessar-ily the economic system (subsistence practices and wealth differences). For ex-ample, in precontact Hawaii ( Johnson and Earle 2000 : 282 – 294), political in-stability occurred after the death of a paramount chief because succession rulesdid not exist. Consequently, different chiefly lines competed to lay claim towearing the feather cloak of the paramount chief. The subsistence base, how-ever, remained stable. In the Kedah case in Malaysia, though, over-use of non-irrigated farmlands beginning about ad900 resulted in decreasing supplies ofstaple foods necessary to support tribute demands; in addition, silt build-up cutoff coastal ports by ca. ad1200 (Allen 1999).I illustrate a local polity through a brief description of Hawaiian chiefdoms.The Hawaiian Islands consist of seven islands in the Pacific. At the time of con-tact in 1778, there were four competing chiefdoms. The largest of the islands isHawaii, on which I focus. It is environmentally diverse, with three differentzones extending from the coast inland: the “shallow offshore bays,” uplands andalluvium, and forests ( Johnson and Earle 2000 : 287). While overall populationdensity was relatively low, it increased in areas with fertile soils, which are un-evenly distributed across the island. Islanders practiced intensive agriculture,especially taro production, as well as some shifting agriculture and fishing.There is an uneven distribution of rainfall across the island as well as “periodicflooding and tidal wave damage” (p. 289). Subsistence technology was relativelysmall-scale, and much of it was handled at the village level. Hawaiians usedsmall-scale terraces, irrigation, drainage systems, and taro pond fields (Earle1978 : 193). Households were basically self-sufficient, with some intracommu-nity exchange across the different zones, as well as small, nonextensive marketsfor extracommunity exchange. Villages were dispersed and varied in size anddensity. Economic stratification existed, where chiefly lineages were wealthierthan others.The paramount chief (PC), a sacred person, supported military and reli-gious specialists, to whom he allotted lands for services rendered, and lordedover district chiefs, community chiefs, and village land managers. The PC alsoprovided capital to rebuild irrigation systems destroyed by heavy rainfall (Earle1978 : 74). Since mature taro can be stored in the field for up to eighteen months,its continuous supply “largely eliminated the need for storage facilities andminimized the periodicity of labor in agriculture” (p. 118). The PC owned allthe land and seafaring canoes used to obtain maritime resources and for tradeand organized the construction of agricultural systems. He also allotted land tocommunities (p. 157). In exchange for use of the PC’s land, fishponds, and ca-noes, people contributed food, labor, and specialized goods. Paramount chiefsorganized war parties to conquer people, to increase the amount of tribute attheir disposal.05-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 116"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Local Rulers and the Maya117Religious institutions and rituals played a large role in consolidating the PC’scontrol over the region, especially since competition for power was intense. ThePCs, “gods on earth” (Earle 1997 : 169), conducted rites to key gods, includingKu, the god of war, and Lono, the god of “land and fertility” ( Johnson andEarle 2000 : 291), throughout the land on a ceremonial circuit at shrines (stoneenclosures), where representations of gods made of wicker were used (e.g., theMakahiki ceremony) (Earle 1978 : 188; 1997 : 172). Many deities were once chieflyancestors (Kirch 1984 : 66). Communities built smaller shrines at which to wor-ship, and people also had their own house gods (Earle 1997 : 175). “[R]ituals di-rected to ancestors made up a large part of religious practice” (Kirch and Green2001 : 245). Farmers also conducted rituals at every stage of the agricultural pro-cess (Kirch 1984 : 38).The only politically unstable periods were during the transition to a new PC,when the various district chiefs vied for the powerful position, as mentionedabove. The end of the Hawaiian way of chiefly life was due to external causes —their exposure to Western culture and eventual takeover by the United States.Such societies have many factors in common with the Maya who lived insecondary centers during the Late Classic (ca. ad550 – 850), especially the ex-tent of power at a ruler’s disposal— that is, the number of subjects.The Maya: Secondary CentersHistories of secondary centers show great variability, which is to be expectedgiven their secondary status. They differ from minor centers in several ways.For example, Lamanai, Altar de Sacrificios, Yalbac, Seibal, Yaxchilán, El Pilar,Quiriguá, Bonampak, Cuello, Dos Pilas, Piedras Negras, Xunantunich, Ton-iná, and other centers are typically found along or near rivers in hilly areas withlimited or dispersed pockets of agricultural land and may have been subsumedin a regional polity or at least interacted with it (see Table 2.1). A common fac-tor among them is access to rivers or river trade routes. Secondary centers aretypically found in lower elevations than regional centers (70 – 175 m asl). Annualrainfall ranges from over 200 cm to over 280 cm (see Figure 4.1). At most sec-ondary centers, residents lived above rivers on ridges and hills, which meantthat saturated hillsides during the rainy season posed problems and influencedbuilding plans and agricultural schedules (Turner 1974). Many rivers were fastflowing and dangerous during the height of the rainy season and low and diffi-cult to travel during the dry season (Gill 2000 : 254). For example, Wendy Ash-more (1981 : 89) suggests that the Maya at Quiriguá may have built artificial lev-ees and /or canals to control flooding and to offset poor drainage.Because of the dispersed agricultural soils, Maya farmers used scattered05-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 117"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"118Water and Ritualsmall-scale water/agricultural systems, includingaguadas,dams, canals, anddrainage ditches (e.g., Dunning et al. 1997; Fedick 1994). Their scale and scat-tered distribution suggest that they did not have a major role in politics. More-over, even if rulers owned land throughout the area, they could have only keptan eye on things in the immediate vicinity. For land beyond their reach, theycompensated farmers for their labor with prestige items and a portion of thecrop rather than demanded corvée labor as they did near the center (Luceron.d.a). Since warfare was small-scale for the most part, there really was not muchneed for rulers to provide protection from attack, although they sometimes did;other options existed, such as fleeing into the jungle or to other areas.Water may have played a crucial role in access to harbors and the potentialto monopolize the trade of exotics such as obsidian and jade. For example, oc-cupants of Quiriguá, located along the lower Río Motagua, were involved intrading jade and obsidian from highland to lowland areas. Even though Yax-chilán lacks a riverfront (Andrews 1975 : 145), former inhabitants still controlledtrade between the highlands of Guatemala and Chiapas and the lowlands. Al-tar de Sacrificios is located at the confluence of the Pasión and Chixoy Rivers(Usumacinta River), an ideal spot for trade since canoe travel was possible; how-ever, its agricultural fields were subject to flooding (Willey and Smith 1969 : 3,46 – 47). Rulers of Yalbac and El Pilar, located along perennial streams thatdrain into the Belize River, had access to trade items, not to mention good pock-ets of agricultural land nearby (Ford 1990; Lucero 2004; Lucero et al. 2004).Many areas of the Usumacinta Basin, however, have poor passage. At Pie-dras Negras, the current is swift and dangerous, but it is surrounded by ca. 32 haof alluvium as well as dispersed pockets of fertile land (Houston 1998; Houstonet al. 1998, 2003) that provided the means for rulers to expand the politicaleconomy. As of yet, no obvious agricultural systems have been found in the im-mediate vicinity of Piedras Negras (Charles Golden, personal communication,2004).Dos Pilas is located in a politically circumscribed area, Petexbatún. Al-though it is not situated on a river, it has a perennial spring close to the mainplaza. Inhabitants also had access to underground water at caves near El Duende,the major temple (Brady et al. 1997; Demarest 1997), both of which were con-trolled by the political elite. The site itself is located in an area with poor agri-cultural soils, however, although better soils are found within 10 km (O’Man-sky and Dunning 2004). Matt O’Mansky and Nicholas Dunning (2004) positthat rulers monopolized trade along the Pasión River. Whatever the materialbasis for power, specific historic events played a major role in the emergence ofrulership when a branch from the Tikal royal family moved to Dos Pilas andlater allied with Calakmul, a major rival of Tikal. Consequently, the kings of05-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 118"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Local Rulers and the Maya119Dos Pilas were more noticeably involved in long-distance interactions with re-gional rulers than many other secondary kings.At Quiriguá, occupants may have planted cash crops like cacao on the lowerriver terraces, which are devoid of settlement (Ashmore 1981 : 77 – 85). A similarscenario likely existed at Seibal, located on a bluff overlooking the Rio Pasiónwith rich but small pockets of alluvial soils available on the other shore of theriver (Mathews and Willey 1991). At Lamanai, David Pendergast (1981 : 40) sug-gests that inhabitants may have planted crops in the seasonally inundated har-bor area, based on core data “that show corn-pollen frequencies many times nor-mal.” Secondary centers had access to agricultural produce in various amounts,as long as they could find the labor to work their fields; they implemented cor-vée labor demands on commoners in the immediate vicinity of centers andcompensated laborers for their work on plots of land farther away and out oftheir reach.Further, since water/agricultural systems were small-scale there was lessneed for a ruler’s assistance in repairing damage caused by heavy rainfall sinceit was handled at the household or community level. Further,chultuns (storagefacilities dug into the limestone bedrock) are small-scale and cluster at elite andnoble residences (Ford 1991b). Their distribution and size indicate food storesfor household members or perhaps for feasts (Lucero n.d.a). Rulers suppliedwater to people fromaguadasrather than the larger artificial reservoirs near orwithin centers at the height of the dry season. The common farmers had someleverage since they could have lived /survived away from centers or opted to gifttheir surplus goods and labor elsewhere.Settlement is typically dense near centers (e.g., up to 275 structures /km2;Loten 1985; Tourtellot 1990) and less so in hinterland areas due to the scatterednature of agricultural soils (e.g., 145 structures /km2; Ashmore 1990; Rice andCulbert 1990 : Table 1.1). Rulers conducted public ceremonies to acquire whattribute they could from the surrounding populace. For example, the vibrantlypainted murals of Bonampak depict tribute payments (e.g., “five 8,000 beancounts of cacao”; Miller 2001 : 210), as well as ritual dancing that took place “onthe adjacent plaza or possibly a courtyard” (p. 215). The murals also depict otherroyal activities, including a major battle, the sacrifice of captured victims, andan heir designation.When regional rulers temporarily or permanently lost political power, sec-ondary rulers benefited and, for a time, became primary rulers (see Webster1998, 2000). For example, the events at Dos Pilas mentioned above occurredduring a long “hiatus” at Tikal (ca. ad593 – 672), when monumental architec-ture and inscriptions ceased (Mathews and Willey 1991). In another example,Buts’ Tiliw of Quiriguá captured Copán’s ruler Waxaklajuun Ub’aah K’awil in05-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 119"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"120Water and Ritualad738, perhaps with a little help from Calakmul’s king (Looper 1999). Theruler of Toniná witnessed a similar victory when he defeated Palenque’s ruler inthe 700s (Martin and Grube 2000 : 172 – 174, 182). However, these periods ofprimary rulership were relatively brief due to external factors (including com-petition and changing seasonal weather) and internal ones (including inade-quate numbers of tribute-payers to support a primary royal lifestyle).These centers arose as “secondary” polities when local rulers participated inthe royal interaction sphere established by regional rulers through alliances,writing, intercenter marriages, warfare, prestige-goods exchange, and royal dy-nastic rites (cf. Blanton et al. 1996; Iannone 2002; Marcus 2003). This patternis borne out in the inscriptions, where regional dynastic histories begin earlier(ad292 – 435) than secondary ones (ad450 and later) (see Martin and Grube2000). Kings at some secondary centers also adopted emblem glyphs, signify-ing their claim of political supremacy within a specific, more limited, realm.Rulers built ball courts, palaces, temples, and a few funerary temples, some-times emulating the layout of regional centers (e.g., Quiriguá mirroring Copánand Xunantunich mirroring Naranjo) (Ashmore and Sabloff 2002). Public ico-nography is ornate, sometimes even more so than at regional centers, perhapsbecause rulers were in a more precarious political position that required con-tinuous display and public negotiation.Kings also realized that farmers could opt to leave or contribute to otherrulers or even leave the political realm altogether. For example, Anabel Ford(1991a; Fedick and Ford 1990) cites a noticeable increase in Late Classic occu-pation in the foothills of the Belize River area in west-central Belize, an areawith marginal agricultural soils. The foothills also have a relatively low settle-ment density compared to the valley and upland areas, where secondary centersare located, as well as a predominance of solitary structures. Occupants weregenerally less wealthy and pursued more diversified economic activities in ad-dition to farming, including ceramic and stone tool production (Lucero 2001 :65 – 66). The Maya perhaps chose to live in a more marginal area rather thancontribute to political coffers at El Pilar, though they could still have suppliedutilitarian goods to their wealthier neighbors. Admittedly, the Maya may havemoved to the foothills in response to growing population and the need to ex-pand into areas previously unoccupied.Whatever the political relations, commoners exchanged goods with peers inother communities independent of elite control. Crumley (2003 : 141; emphasisin original) states it best: “While the Mayapoliticalsystem was organized ver-tically, theeconomywould appear to have been shaped by environmental con-straints and characterized by fluidly networked interregional exchanges” (e.g.,Kunen and Hughbanks 2003; Lewis 2003).05-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 120"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Local Rulers and the Maya121As is the case elsewhere, farmers also performed traditional rites in thehome, agricultural fields, and sacred places, including caves and water bodies.At some centers rulers and water symbolism (e.g., water lilies) are found onmonumental architecture and stelae as well as portable goods (e.g., ceramicvases) (e.g., Hellmuth 1987; Rands 1953), indicating the important link betweenwater and royal power. When inscriptions are present, they typically highlightties to regional rulers, such as marriages, battles, and royal visits (Schele andMathews 1991).Terminal Classic events varied at secondary centers and were related to thelevel of involvement of secondary rulers with those at larger, regional centers,since nonlocal royal ties played a major role in maintaining political power. Anychange in external relations — such as regional centers’ loss of power, trade dis-ruption, or diminishing prestige-goods exchange — reverberated throughoutthe royal interaction sphere. Local subsistence practices and wealth differenceswere not necessarily affected as long as resources held out. Consequently, therewere varied responses to the collapse of power at regional centers. Many sec-ondary centers where rulers had close ties with regional rulers were largelyabandoned by the ninth or tenth century, but not necessarily their hinterlandareas (e.g., Quiriguá, Yaxchilán, El Pilar, Yalbac, and other centers). Altar deSacrificios was abandoned for good in the ad900s, though its last fifty years ofoccupation (ca. ad900 – 950) may have been by non-Petén Maya (Adams 1971,1973; Mathews and Willey 1991; Willey and Shimkin 1973). Recently, however,Gair Tourtellot and Jeremy Sabloff (2004) have suggested that outsiders camefrom Ucanal (southeastern Petén) and occupied Seibal and surrounding areasca. ad830, perhaps in an effort to revitalize trade.As a result of weakening power at regional centers at the end of the LateClassic, several secondary rulers claimed independence. For example, Quiriguábecame independent from Copán, and Yaxchilán broke from Palenque and Ti-kal (Ashmore 1984; Mathews and Willey 1991). In such cases, rulers did not im-mediately lose power, so neither their centers nor surrounding hinterlands wereabandoned. Clearly, several means underwrote political systems, such as themonopolization of nearby agricultural land, trade in nonexotics, and the use of alternative trade routes and partners. Kings at some secondary centers evenprospered. For example, rulers at Seibal and Xunantunich witnessed a brief flo-rescence — ca. ad830 – 890 for Seibal and ca. ad780 – 890 for Xunantunich(LeCount et al. 2002; Mathews and Willey 1991; Tourtellot and González2004). Farmers who did not emigrate continued to live near, or even at, centersbut without any royal demands to worry about. Petexbatún centers, such as DosPilas and Aguateca, were abandoned in the latter part of the eighth century andearly part of the ninth century as a result of political conflict in the densely05-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 121"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Figure 5.1.Altar deSacrificios.

But why did the political vacuum remain in the southern Mayalowlands? I address this question in Chapter 7.Ritual History of Altar de SacrificiosAltar de Sacrificios is located on high ground in a semi-swampland at the con-fluence of the Pasión and Chixoy Rivers (Usumacinta River) in Guatemala atabout an elevation of 100 m asl (Willey and Smith 1969 : 3) (see Figure 2.1).While the site was an ideal trade port due to its location and the relative easeof canoe travel, it was subject to flooding, especially in its agricultural fields aswell as at the site core (Smith 1972 : 5; Willey and Smith 1969 : 3, 46 – 47). Tour-tellot and Sabloff (2004) suggest that inhabitants may have traded in locallymanufactured pottery and perishables such as quetzal feathers and salt. Becauseof its location at the confluence of two rivers, the site is restricted in extent (ca.1.1 \u0005.8 km) and has a density of ca. 90 structures per sq. km (Figure 5.1). Thecore area, consisting of about thirty structures, includes temples (the tallest be-ing 13 m high), a ball court, and palace complexes (Strs. B-IV and A-I).Seasonal flooding and poor drainage resulted in a problem with leached soils(Willey and Smith 1969 : 39). Annual rainfall is about 176 cm but can rangedramatically from year to year. For example, from 1924 to 1934, average annualrainfall ranged from 99 to 237 cm (p. 40). Nor is there a noticeable dry season,though it does rain less at times. “There are also suggestions of rainfall ‘cycles,’with three or four wet years being followed by the same number of dry ones”(p. 40). There is no obvious evidence for terraces or raised fields in the Pasiónregion (Dunning 1996). When writing about the Pasión region in general, Ste-phen Houston (1993) notes that soils in the immediate vicinity of the river are“suitable for non-intensive agriculture without the addition of substantial quan-tities of fertilizer” (p. 11) and that soil farther upland is even less fertile; centersare typically fund on the boundary of these two soil zones (p. 72).Altar de Sacrificios had kings until at least ad662 (Culbert 1991), an emblemglyph, and carved and inscribed monuments (stelae, altars, censer altars, andarchitectural panels) (Graham 1972 : 86 – 88). It “has the longest monument se-quence of any site in the Pasion region . . .” (Mathews and Willey 1991 : 42) andthe earliest (Graham 1972 : 119)— from ad455 to ad849. The Maya lived at Al-tar de Sacrificios from ca. 900 bcthrough ad950. While it is near Dos Pilas(see Figure 2.1) and has inscriptions that include emblem glyphs from Yaxchilánand Dos Pilas or Tikal probably representing royal visits (Marcus 1976 : 93;Schele and Mathews 1991), it appears to have been an independent polity nevercompletely subsumed by a regional center. Thus, inhabitants were less involvedin warfare. Rulers and elites acquired exotics such as jade, obsidian, and marine05-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 123"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"124Water and Ritualshell items, as did everyone else to a lesser extent. Commoners acquired pres-tige goods as compensation for work or gifts from elites and obtained utilitar-ian and some prestige items through exchange with Maya in other areas. Kingsare depicted in the iconography, and gods are included in the inscriptions (e.g.,sun god, Stela 4), as well as Cauac symbols (e.g., Stelae 1 and 5) (Graham 1972 :13, 18, 20).Altar de Sacrificios began to use “foreign” ceramic designs between ca.ad850 – 909, after which the Maya apparently abandoned the site (Mathewsand Willey 1991) for a short time. It was briefly reoccupied, perhaps by a dif-ferent Maya group, based on the presence of different ceramics at ca. ad909 –948, who built small structures on monumental platforms with thatch andreused redstone and limestone blocks (Smith 1972 : 6).Group B is the earliest monumental complex built, dating to ca. 600 bc; theMaya continued to enlarge and rebuild it until ad524 (the last dated monu-ment) but likely used it long afterward (Smith 1972 : 72 – 73). Its façade consistsof redstone quarried from ca. 9 km away (p. 6). Str. B-I is the tallest temple andstructure at Altar de Sacrificios (13 m). Monumental construction shifted toGroup A in the Early Classic and continued through the Late Classic but wasused long after the last stone was placed (Willey and Smith 1969 : 26). It con-sists of two large plazas (north and south) surrounded by range structures,temples, and an acropolis, much of which has eroded into the Pasión River.The plazas are separated by the only ball court at Altar de Sacrificios. Exten-sive excavations by the Harvard crew revealed much about monumental con-struction histories and ritual activities.A. Ledyard Smith and his team also tested nearby and surrounding settle-ments, consisting of solitary mounds and plazuela groups (numbered 1 – 40) orcommoner and elite residences. Excavation units typically were placed on thetop center of mounds. This strategy revealed much evidence about ritual activ-ities. Here I focus discussion on ritual activities in Groups A and B and the elitecompounds and commoner mounds located in the immediate vicinity.The Preclassic (ca. 900 BC–AD 250)Much Preclassic ritual evidence was recovered at Altar de Sacrificios, especiallyat structures near and in the core (Table 5.1).

Caches from monumentalarchitecture have more diverse and better-made items. A vessel containing fourobsidian blades was found under a plaza B floor that dates to somewhere be-tween 300 bcand ad150 (p. 242). Some of the earliest construction events atAltar de Sacrificios occur at Str. B-I, a temple eventually reaching 13 m inheight and 40 \u000538 m in size; the Maya cached six red-slipped bowls, a cylin-der vase, and a jade bead (pp. 73, 238). Other Str. B-I caches more firmly datedto ca. bc/ad–ad150 yielded an incised red-slipped plate (p. 240), a jade beadwithin a plain vessel over which four red-slipped vessels had been inverted(pp. 239 – 240), and three bowls, two of which were lip-to-lip and containedocelot bones, two canines, and other faunal remains (p. 239). Other caches inGroup B are similar.There is even earlier evidence for ancestor veneration, especially in elite con-texts. At mound 7, for example, an adult male with cranial deformation was in-terred (Burial 131) ca. 600 – 450 bcwith a jade effigy pendant in his mouth anda miniature bowl inverted over his skull (p. 268). Str. B-II, a small temple (6 mhigh, 22 \u000520 m) on the west side of Group B, yielded three Middle Preclassicburials that deserve mention. Burial 129, an adult male with cranial deforma-tion and some teeth stained greenish, was buried sometime between 600 and300 bcwith a large red-slipped bowl inverted over the skull as well as a deerantler fragment, a celt, and a purple substance underneath a sherd (p. 268).From the same period, an adult female (Burial 124), whose bones the Mayastained red, was interred with a jar partially inverted over the skull (pp. 265 –266). Adults were not the only ones privileged with such burials. Burial 125(450 –300 bc) consisted of an infant /child buried with armadillo armor plates,fish teeth, and jar fragments placed over the remains (p. 265). Burial 127 at Str. B-I included three infants /children with their teeth stained green (p. 266).Red-slipped bowls were inverted over two of the skulls and a sherd over theother, under which a chert core had been placed. The final grave object was ablack bowl.The earliest obvious commoner burials at Altar de Sacrificios date to ca.bc/ad–ad150. Excavations at mound 10 (4.7 m high, 24 \u000518) revealed an ado-lescent (Burial 130) without any grave goods (pp. 176, 268). Burial 97 frommound 26 (2 m high, 30 \u000524 m) consists of an adult male and child buried witha red-slipped bowl and a bone tube (pp. 147, 259).There are several elite burials. For example, mound 2 yielded two burialsfrom the same period (ca. 300 bc–bc/ad), one (Burial 31) consisting of an adultfemale buried with a chert biface (p. 248) and the other (Burial 8) of an adultwith notched upper incisors buried with a red-slipped bowl (p. 244). Other eliteburials from the same period were more ornate and included more vessels (e.g.,05-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 129"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"130Water and RitualBurials 135, 104, and 41) (pp. 250, 260 – 261, 269), jade (e.g., Burials 107 and 41)(pp. 250, 262), and other items such as quartzite (e.g., Burial 104). The scale in-creases further in monumental contexts. For example, Burial 119, a redstone cisttomb in Str. B-II (ca. 300 bc–ad150), enshrined an adult male buried with alarge red vase containing his skull, a red bowl inverted over the chest, anotherover the pelvis, and a jade tubular bead in the mouth (pp. 264 – 265). In a red-stone corbel arch crypt in Str. B-III (a temple 5 m high, 23 \u000523 m in size) dat-ing to the same period, another male adult (Burial 105) with green-stained teethand bones covered in a red pigment was buried, this time with a piece of copalin his mouth, a jade tubular bead at his throat, and two red bowls (pp. 93, 261).Interestingly, there are also simple burials with few or no grave goods in mon-umental contexts, usually under floors (e.g., Burial 108, Str. B-II, and Burial 65,Str. B-I, both dating to ca. 300 bc–bc/ad) (pp. 253, 262) or walls (e.g., Burial53, Str. B-I, dating to ca. bc/ad–ad150) (p. 251). They may have been sacrificialvictims (e.g., Burial 108 was missing most of its skull).There is also evidence for Middle Preclassic termination rites at Altar deSacrificios. In a pit dating to ca. 900 – 600 bc, the Maya burned something andbuilt over it at mound 25 (2.3 m high, 22 \u000520 m) (p. 142). Other early depositsare found in elite and monumental contexts. For example, mound 7 has a lensof burned earth dating to 600 – 450 bcwith a Xe (900 – 600 bc) figurine frag-ment (p. 179). There is also extensive burning at Str. B-III dating between 600and 300 bc, consisting of layers of ash and “refuse” or broken items (pp. 93, 97).For example, at the bottom of a shaft in Str. B-III excavators found a layer ofash, carbon, chert pieces, burned bone, and charred beans (p. 97). This patterncontinues into the Late Preclassic; at a commoner house, mound 26 (2 m high,30 \u00054 m), there were two pits dating between 300 bcand ad150, one withlimestone blocks in a line, and the other with pots, flakes, bone fragments, anda “calcified deposit”; finally, “[t]hree beds of charcoal and fired soil cross the pitat intervals” (p. 147). And sometime between 300 bcand bc/ad, at the eliteplatform structure 40 (1.7 m high, 32 \u000520 m located in the core), “occupationmay have been terminated by fairly extensive burning,” including charred seeds(p. 184). There are also termination events directly related to ancestor venera-tion. For example, there is a layer of ash, carbon, and burned earth over Burial105, the crypt burial mentioned above (pp. 98 – 99, 261).The Early Classic (ca. AD 250–550)Early Classic dedication caches at Altar de Sacrificios are similar to Preclassicones but increase in scale, especially in monumental contexts (Table 5.2). Com-moner deposits more or less remain similar to those of earlier periods.

For example, mound 31 (2.6 mhigh, 22 \u000520 m), associated with a large platform structure (no. 33), yielded aninverted white bowl, a complete but broken orange bowl, a modeled black ef-figy vessel, and a resist-painted effigy vessel, all dating to ca.ad450 –534 (p. 151).Str. B-I yielded a cache dating to ca. ad150 – 450 that included heirloom Usu-lután sherds (ca. bc/ad–ad150) and 28 sherd discs, some burned and with sur-face carbon (p. 239). In a later deposit (ca. ad300 – 450) at Str. B-I stairway 1,46 red-slipped or plain bowls were recovered, most lip-to-lip (p. 237). Excava-tions below a wall at Str. B-II revealed a cache consisting of a red-slipped bowlcontaining fish bones, turtle carapaces, carbon, and a small stone ball (p. 241).Ancestor veneration rites also continue and expand in scale, though less so05-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 133"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"134Water and Ritualin commoner contexts. For example, Burial 117 (ca. ad500 –573), an adult maleburied at mound 37 (3.3 m high, 22 \u000520 m), did not have any grave goods(pp. 170, 264). Many commoner burials, however, have grave goods. For ex-ample, Burial 118 (ca. ad350 –500) from mound 36 (\u00071 m high, 16 \u000520 m), anadult male, was buried with an orange bowl inverted over his skull (pp. 169,264). At the same mound but dating slightly later (ca. ad500 –554), the Mayaburied an adult male (Burial 115) with a polychrome bowl with a kill hole in-verted over the skull, a tripod cylinder vase with slab feet and a lid, an orangebowl containing a miniature redstone censer altar, obsidian blades, two musselshells with traces of red paint, a shell adorno (ornament) with jade inlays, anda shell adorno with a jade and shell mosaic of a human face (pp. 263 – 264). Ina later burial (Burial 114) at the same mound (no. 36, ca. ad554 –573), a largepolychrome plate had been inverted over the skull of an adult (p. 264). Othergrave goods included an incised bowl, an orange bowl, and two jade beads.These commoner burials are similar to elite ones. For example, Burial 106 atmound 20 (4 m high, 36 \u000532 m), associated with mound 19, included an adultwith a red bowl inverted over the skull (pp. 159, 262). Burial 103 at mound 18(2.4 m high, 25 \u000517 m), the western structure of an elite compound, consistedof an adult buried with a plain bowl. Other elite burials, however, differ fromcommoner ones. For example, mound 2 yielded an Early Classic (ca. ad500 –554) burial (Burial 7) of an adult with notched upper incisors, a polychrome bowlinverted over the skull, a black bowl, a jade bead, and a blackstone bead (p. 244).Early Classic burials in monumental architecture are also diverse. For ex-ample, from a shaft burial (Burial 99) in Str. B-III dating to ca. ad150 – 450, anadult male with cranial deformation was placed with what looks like wood overthe torso and upper legs, a drilledSpondylusshell covering the neck and mouth,a stingray spine, a shell adorno with iron pyrite, a jade tubular flaring bead, apiece of raw jade, and a bone bead (pp. 259 – 260). Also noticeable are the childburials; they represent either human sacrifices or special posthumous treatmentfor royal family members. For example, from below a floor dating to ca. ad554 –573 of Str. A-I, an acropolis 8 m in height and more than 80 (eroded by theriver) \u000536 m in size, Burial 100 was found, consisting of an infant /child witha polychrome bowl inverted over the remains, as well as a possible heirloombowl (pp. 12, 260).Termination rites at Altar de Sacrificios also continue through the EarlyClassic, mostly consisting of carbon and ash lenses and broken items. They arealso associated with burial rites (e.g., commoner Burials 118 and 117) (pp. 169,264). Monumental architecture yielded the most ornate evidence. Constructionceased at Group B in the Early Classic (ca. ad500) (Smith 1972 : 6) and was ter-minated with parts of destroyed stelae. For example, butts of stelae 10 (datedad455) and 11 (dated ad475) were found in the construction fill of Str. B-I, as05-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 134"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Local Rulers and the Maya135well as chert pieces in groups of nine and 13 (p. 82, Table 2). The butt of stela13 (dated to ad495; Table 2) was placed at the edge of stairway 1 of temple Str. B-I (p. 81). On top of the terrace wall and platform of Str. B-III, the Mayaplaced fragments of a redstone altar, as well as incensario sherd clusters in frontof the wall and platform (pp. 99 – 100). These deposits likely represent the ter-mination of the stelae and altars and the dedication of the last constructionevent.The Late Classic (ca. AD 550–850)Late Classic dedication deposits at Altar de Sacrificios are similar to those ofearlier periods, though monumental architecture has more diverse and ornateritual deposits (Table 5.3). Commoner structures continue to house the simplestcaches. For example, mound 19 (2 m high, 22 \u000518 m), associated with a muchlarger structure (no. 20), yielded a small carved sandstone incensario and amano fragment dating to ca. ad554 – 613 (Smith 1972 : 163). Mound 36, anothercommoner house, had a cache dating to ca. ad573 – 613, with two polychromebowls (p. 241). From a deposit dating to the same period at mound 38, an elitestructure, archaeologists recovered “alligator” bones (actually crocodile or cai-man) and mano fragments (pp. 164 – 165). Dedication caches become more or-nate in monumental contexts. For example, in the central axis of stairway 1 fillof Str. A-I at ca. ad613 – 671 the Maya cached nine chert eccentrics (one withtraces of red pigment), twoSpondylusshells with traces of red pigment, twostingray spine fragments, and six pieces of jade (p. 238). A cache in the fill overBurial 128 (see below) in Str. A-III (a temple platform 10 m high and 100 \u000530 m in size), dating to ca. ad700 – 771, consists of a jade bead, five stingrayspines, seven shells, twenty-seven small pieces of jade, fish vertebrae, bones oftwo different bird species, and one crab claw (pp. 56, 242). Smith starts to dis-tinguish “nicked” and notched obsidian pieces in caches (e.g., Caches 50 and 47,Str. A-III, ca. ad771 – 948) (pp. 240 – 241).Ancestor veneration increases in scale, especially in Group A structures.Elite and /or royal rites shifted to Group A in the Early Classic from Group B,where construction ceased. As Table 5.3 illustrates, Late Classic commoner andelite burials are similar in scale to earlier ones. There are also indications of hu-man sacrifice in Group A, based on the presence of skulls (or remains withoutskulls). For example, under a floor at Str. A-I in a deposit dating to ca. ad573 –613, the skull of an adult male (Burial 6) with notched upper incisors was re-covered (p. 247). Two other skulls (adult males) with notched upper incisors(Burials 35 and 49) were recovered under floors or walls in Str. A-II dating toca. ad700 – 771 (pp. 251, 256 – 257).

For example, sometimebetween ca. ad700 and 771, in Str.

Rites at monumental architecture, however,are quite different; they are more expensive and diverse. Temple rituals likelywere conducted for audiences from all walks of life, whereas some ceremoniesconducted in the acropolis were more restricted, for just a few people — royalsand their elite underlings. But there is clear evidence that everyone practicedthe same rites, which came from a long-standing tradition.Seasonal rainfall vagaries likely meant that inhabitants of Altar de Sacrificiosprayed and made offerings to gods and ancestors for rain. We begin to see thereplication and expansion of traditional domestic rituals in more ornate set-tings, using more fancy and expensive items; at the same time we begin to seeclear evidence for the appearance of the first kings in the area in the latter halfof the Early Classic period. While monumental architecture appears much ear-lier, evidence for royal life (as at other secondary centers) occurs after the emer-gence of rulers at regional centers.In addition to surplus acquired from agriculture, rulers and elites also reliedon trade and participation in the elite /royal interaction sphere. Disruptions oc-curring elsewhere in the southern lowlands were eventually felt by kings of Al-tar de Sacrificios, resulting in their loss of material wealth and prestige in theeyes of surrounding farmers (not to mention the gods).

The only differences relate tothe fact that Maya at secondary centers were members of a larger social and po-litical society. Key factors, however, are quite similar, particularly how localmaterial conditions impacted social, political, economic, and religious life.05-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 144"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"In this chapter I describe centralized and integrative polities (see Table 1.1) andriver and nonriver major Maya centers, which have several factors in common(see Table 2.1). I also present a history of ritual activities at Tikal, home to someof the most powerful Maya kings.Centralized PolityWhen Anu and Enlil [major gods] gave me the lands of Sumer and Akkad to rule,and entrusted their sceptre to me, I dug the canalHammurabi-the-abundance-of-the-peoplewhich bringeth water for the lands of Sumer and Akkad. The scat-tered people of Sumer and Akkad I gathered, with pasturage and watering I pro-vided them; I pastured them with plenty and abundance, and settled them inpeaceful dwellings.hammurabi (ca. 1792 – 1750 bc), translated in russell (1938 : 77)A centralized polity is politically centralized, integrating several local politiesand communities. It is largely based on a ruler’s access to concentrated critical re-sources and concomitant nucleated, dense settlements (e.g., river valleys) (Car-neiro 1970; Earle 1997; Friedman and Rowlands 1978; Gilman 1981). Examplesinclude several ancient complex polities that arose along rivers, where leadersmore easily controlled access to waterways and /or concentrated alluvium, aswell as the labor of surrounding farmers who lived in farmsteads, communities,villages, or towns (e.g., China, Egypt, Mesopotamia, parts of Mesoamerica,and coastal Andean South America). Political demands are superimposed ontoexisting economic and social institutions. Centralized polities are what anthro-pologists have traditionally defined as archaic states (e.g., Marcus 1998). TheyCHAPTER 6Regional Rulers and the Maya:The Ritual History of Tikal06-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 145"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"have dense populations (e.g., urbanization), institutionalized rulership withpower over life and death of subjects, the ability to collect tribute and raise anarmy, centralized storage and /or stores of capital, socioeconomic stratification,occupational specialization, specialized personnel (military, religious, and ad-ministrative personnel or bureaucrats), interdependency (e.g., protection, re-liance on large-scale water/agricultural systems), and, secondarily, writing orrecording and codified laws (Adams 1966; Carneiro 1970; Childe 1951 [1936] :114 – 120; Engels 1978 [1884]; Fried 1967 : 229 – 240; Marx and Engels 1977 [1932];Service 1962 : 180; Steward 1972 [1955] : 191 – 196; White 1959 : 141 – 147).Lineages, clans, or comparable groups corporately own land (Trigger 2003 :320). The largest landholders, however, are monarchs, temple estates, and aris-tocratic families (p. 333). While farmers typically are largely economically self-sufficient (pp. 112, 402), they — along with urban dwellers — face periodicdrought, famine, and damaged crops and water/agricultural systems resultingfrom heavy rains. Rulers provide food from their granaries or via trade and cap-ital to rebuild water/agricultural systems (cf. Trigger 2003 : 387). They also allo-cate water and /or resolve disputes involving water rights and protect subjectsand their property from raids and invasions.Sociopolitical relations are hierarchical and unequal, though kings have totake care not to over-exploit their subjects. Inequality results from rulers’ beingable to exact tribute without any obligation to compensate subjects equally.Military support is for protection from foreign threats, but, more importantly,to conquer land and incorporate more people. The presence of an army indi-cates that rulers could coerce compliance from farmers to pay their share inmaintaining the political economy. In other words, farmers had less choice andfewer options but still resisted when they could, usually in subtle ways, withwhat Scott (1990) labels “hidden transcripts.” For example, taxpayers expressdiscontent and resistance through jokes, folktales, songs (p. 19), role-reversals(e.g., Carnival) (pp. 80, 173), and poaching (p. 190) and stealing from royal orelite lands.Monarchs participate in the royal interaction sphere, including alliances,marriages, and prestige-goods exchange. Large-scale integrative events (e.g.,trickle-down of exotics, ceremonies, and feasts) are necessary to legitimizerulership and promote solidarity. Corvée labor is used to build both public (e.g.,stadiums) and private /restricted buildings (e.g., palaces). All members of soci-ety participate in trade independent of elite interference, either between indi-viduals or in markets.Regal rites revolve around royal ancestors to illustrate that they have the“mandate of heaven” (Fried 1967 : 238; Helms 1998). Ceremonies also acknowl-edge the importance of other gods, especially those in the upper echelons of thesupernatural hierarchy. Rulers, because of their role in the continuance of life146Water and Ritual06-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 146"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"and society, are depicted in public iconography, often alongside powerful gods(e.g., sun and water deities), on various media from small objects (e.g., coins)to large public buildings (e.g., temples) (for example, Durkheim 1995 [1912] :64). Everyone conducts household and community rites, which revolve aroundancestors and fertility. Writing or recording systems typically emerge to recordimportant information, including economic transactions, dynastic histories, re-ligious rites, and myths (Postgate et al. 1995).Centralized polities last as long as resources hold out and seasonal regimesdo not change drastically for long periods. Demand for surplus production in-stituted by monarchs may contribute to the over-exploitation of resources, acondition that can be exacerbated by changing climate patterns. “Evidence ofresource degradation is more common in periods when hierarchical, centralizedpolities held sway, even when overall population density in the polities was notmuch greater than in periods when non-centralized societies were in charge”(Roosevelt 1999 : 14). For example, the increased salinization of irrigated land in southern Mesopotamia likely contributed to the loss of political power, crit-ical resources, and people in and around urban areas in the eighteenth to sev-enteenth centuries bc( Jacobsen and Adams 1958; Postgate 1992 : 181; Yoffee1988). However, as mentioned, it is a rare occurrence when regions are largelyabandoned.I illustrate a centralized polity through a brief description of one of the“largest desert areas in the world” (Kemp 1991 : 8), Egypt during the New King-dom (1540 – 1070 bc). Egyptians lived along the Nile River, a rich, fertile areareplenished each year during annual flooding. Intensive agriculture, as well asthe herding of cattle (and sheep and goats) and the capture of riverine life (fishand fowl), supported densely settled villages, towns, and cities (including templetowns) (Baines and Yoffee 1998). Since farmers depended on the annual risingand subsiding of the Nile for their livelihood, famine was always a concern,caused either by drought or by flood damage (Hassan 1994). Canals and earthenembankments (dikes) diverted water to fields, which were built under both lo-cal and government supervision. By the New Kingdom, theshadufwas intro-duced, a water-lifting device that expanded available farmland. Potential foodshortages were mitigated by the use of granaries, which pharaohs, temple es-tates, and wealthy individuals built and stocked (Kemp 1991 : 296). In addition,many residential compounds had wells.Stratification was undeniable, in terms of both wealth (palace, temple, andnoble estates) and political power, with the pharaoh ruling from the top andwith various high officials and temples priests vying for wealth and power. The pharaoh owned large amounts of land, as did temple priests, officials, andwealthy families. Elites also owned the ships vital for trade. However, everyoneowed tribute to the pharaoh. In addition, the royal household controlled theRegional Rulers and the Maya14706-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 147"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"vast wealth from conquered lands, including, for example, gold from Nubia.Pharaohs supported a standing army as well as foreign mercenaries to conquerrich areas and to protect their people and territory from invasion (Kemp 1991 :228). Egyptians had access to trade and other goods in the markets as well asthrough local exchange independent of royal supervision (p. 259).Monumental architecture was closely tied to religious and political venues,including temples that housed divine images and royal tombs that served asroyal ancestral cults (Kemp 1991 : 21, 53), both of which collected tribute (p. 235).In addition, each deity had its own temple and priests, all of whom vied for ma-terial support. At the household and community level, rites revolved aroundancestors at family tombs and various deities from the vast pantheon of Egyp-tian gods. Villages also commemorated “the gods they favoured” (p. 304) (e.g.,Amun, Amun-Ra). If able, elites built small shrines in their garden in honor ofthe royal family (p. 301). Royal and religious rites were grand public affairs tocelebrate and honor gods as well as the divine ruler. The importance of godsand the pharaoh is also reflected in public iconography, which is dominated bythe inscribed life stories of gods and rulers, conquests, and festivals, not to men-tion the annual height of the Nile flood (Kemp 1991 : 23). The relationship be-tween king and deities and the cosmos was also detailed in the written record.Political power has changed hands numerous times throughout Egypt’s longhistory, but it has always been densely settled and is still going strong today.Integrative PolityTo be a god does not necessarily mean to have more license, but rather to have moreduties:divinité oblige.hocart (1970 [1936] : 151 – 152)A major difference between centralized and integrative polities is that the for-mer exhibit greater centralized and hierarchical power structures, whether theyare city-states (e.g., Mesopotamia), territorial states (e.g., Egypt), or empires(e.g., Inka). One system gives the appearance of a unified front through highculture (i.e., civilization) (Baines and Yoffee 1998), and the other actually ismore politically unified. The confusion has arisen when scholars conflate civi-lization and the state (Yoffee 1988). A civilization shares a “great tradition” oran elite and royal culture. Centralized polities have one primary ruler, whereasintegrative ones have several relatively autonomous ones. In integrative polities,periods of centralization, if any, are brief; but they have a common political ide-ology expressed via monumental iconography, writing, and royal public rites.Marcus (1998) mentions some of these factors in her dynamic model. While she148Water and Ritual06-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 148"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"argues that most archaic states go through cycles of centralization and decen-tralization, I argue that in many instances periods of decentralization are anormal state of affairs for integrative polities (cf. Demarest 1992; Feinman1998). In some cases “success” (centralization) is achieved, but usually onlybriefly or not at all (e.g., Angkor and the Classic Maya).Another major difference between centralized and integrative polities has todo with the material basis for political power (see Table 1.1). Unlike in a cen-tralized polity, it is more challenging for kings of integrative polities to accesscompletely the dispersed critical resources, resulting in a decentralized subsis-tence economy (e.g., Fox 1977 : 54; de Montmollin 1989 : 17 – 19; Kunen n.d.). Asa result, farmers live in farmsteads or villages scattered throughout the land-scape, making it difficult for leaders to bring people together to organize workparties, feasts, and ceremonial events (e.g., Java; Miksic 1999). Integrative poli-ties also lack large-scale and centralized storage facilities — for food, at least;water storage and allocation is another matter. Without centralized storage,rulers cannot assist their subjects in times of need, unless they have the meansto import food. Hereditary rulers, however, still involve themselves in support-ing large-scale water/agricultural systems, which are critical in the face of sea-sonal concerns such as drought, floods, and water allocation. Other economicsystems, such as trade, also can be garnered to support rulership. But monarchsbring people together, for example, in regal-ritual centers (Fox 1977) by spon-soring elaborate ceremonies and feasts at monumental temples, temple-palacecomplexes, stadiums, and arenas. The goal is to create obligatory relationshipsand impose taxation on those who congregate at royal centers.The population of the city consists of those bound to the court by kinship,official duties, or craft specializations. . . . The life-style is defined by thecalendrical round of state rituals, kingly ceremonies, coronations, funerals,preparations for war, royal feasts, and divine sacrifices, rather than by indi-vidualism and secularism. (Fox 1977 : 53)Consequently, competition exists among rulers toattractand keep follow-ers. Of course, everyone still performs household and community rites. Rulers,however, are better able to communicate with the supernatural world and high-light their contention that the continuance of their rule benefits everyone.Kings are depicted in the iconography to emphasize their ties to gods, espe-cially sun and rain or water deities. This relationship is often recorded viacarved inscriptions for all to see but not usually to read and comprehend. Writ-ing systems do not record economic transactions as much as they do royal andsupernatural events (cf. Postgate et al. 1995). Rulers still need funding, however,to support the political system.

Warfare typically thus issmall-scale and ceremonial in nature, often related to status rivalry (Webster1998; e.g., Geertz 1980 : 252). Nor do they have much of a bureaucracy, if at all(e.g., Geertz 1980 : 132). Rulers are heavily involved in a far-flung royal interac-tion sphere to bolster their rights of power over others (e.g., Helms 1993). Inaddition, while they cannot force compliance, people often listen to their ad-vice because of what leaders provide in return. For example, when corporate kingroups no longer can resolve disputes involving nonkin members, rulers can adjudicate intergroup problems (e.g., water and land disputes) (Hocart 1970[1936] : 133). The king thus is a lineage elder writ large.“Galactic polities” of Southeast Asia (Tambiah 1977) exemplify such a sys-tem, the traits of which are summarized by Arthur Demarest (1992 : 150):The most salient characteristic . . . is the great importance of ritual perfor-mances in their ceremonial centers and the awe (and authority) that these dis-plays generated. . . . Other important features include (1) the organization ofhegemonies into capital centers loosely controlling a cluster or galaxy of subor-dinate centers; (2) a redundancy of structure and functions between the capitalcenter and dependencies; (3) an emphasis on control over labor and allegiancerather than territory; (4) little direct control by the rulers over local economicinfrastructure; (5) an extreme dependency on the personal performance of theruler in warfare, marriage alliances, and above all, ritual; and (6) the tendencyof these states to expand and contract in territory, reflecting the dynamicsresulting from all of these features, as dependencies struggle against authorityor shift allegiances or as expanding capitals impose short-lived attempts atcentralization.Another noticeable feature of integrative polities is the degree of leveragethat farmers have over ruling elites, which is more than in centralized polities.Michael Adas (1981 : 218), based on his research on precolonial and colonialSoutheast Asia polities, argues that political power actually. . . is in reality severely restricted by rival power centers . . . by weaknesses inadministrative organization and institutional commitment on the part of stateofficials, by poor communications, and by a low population-to-land ratio thatplaces a premium on manpower retention and regulation.In precolonial times, rivalries existed among elites for labor control as wellas the rivalry between rulers and regional lords. Marriage alliances served to ce-ment ties between elite /royal families and benefited both sides. Further, since150Water and Ritual06-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 150"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"administrators “at all levels” kept a portion of taxes collected rather than beingpaid a salary per se, institutionalized corruption was rampant. Monarchs alsofound it difficult to control much beyond the capital city and hinterlands, es-pecially at the village level. They found it challenging to compete with villageheadmen. Village headmen in Java and Burma, for example, generally camefrom local elite landholding families, who usually claimed to be descended fromfounding families:Their control over local affairs rested on the extent of their holdings, the number of laborers and artisans dependent on the use of their land and theirpatronage, the wisdom they demonstrated in village councils, and their abilityto defend the interests of their communities in dealings with supravillage offi-cials and their agents. (p. 222)In Java:Most of the remaining families in the village were attached as clients, withvarying degrees of dependence, to one of the [elite] households. The clients. . . worked the [elites’] fields for a customary share of the harvest yield, per-formed domestic and artisanal services, and in some cases actually lived indwellings provided by their patron. (p. 226)Kings could not do much about this situation because of the lack of a mili-tary force powerful enough to guarantee compliance. Elite officers commandedtroops of poorly trained and equipped conscripted peasants. It was also difficultto control regional lords and collect taxes, not to mention organize large-scalelabor-intensive projects.Thus, precolonial rulers were compelled to rely mainly upon adherence to state cults centering on the ruler’s powers to protect and to grant fertility, onchains of patron-client clusters extending from the court to local notables, andon the cooperation of village leaders, rather than on military clout, to ensurethat taxes were collected and order maintained. (p. 223)These conditions in precolonial Southeast Asia, in turn, provided the meansfor farmers to avoid excessive demands through several strategies, which rarelyincluded outright revolt and violence. It was not usually necessary in the face of other options farmers had. They migrated, chose other patrons, or fled totemple estates /monastic orders or to rival kingdoms. Farmers could always re-turn if rulers or patrons lessened their tribute demands.

Patrons thushad to demand enough taxes and labor to demonstrate their success withoutmaking the demands too onerous. Clearly, farmers had leverage, since the lossof labor was detrimental to royal and noble power and prestige. Consequently,competition for their loyalty and labor was intense. “The flight of the peasantrycame to be seen in most African and Asian cultures as a sign of dynastic weak-ness and socioeconomic decline” (Adas 1981 : 234). Monarchs traveled through-out their domain to interact ritually with their subjects.An integrative polity is thus less politically integrated than centralized poli-ties because material wealth is inadequate in and of itself to support the politi-cal system, as are integrative events. Consequently, rulers must continually main-tain their power through feasts, ceremonies, and elaborate displays. This systemconsequently is more susceptible to any type of fluctuation— climatic, eco-nomic, political, or social. As long as resources and climate regimes are stable,however, the economic system is relatively stable or unaffected by cyclical orchanging political histories.I illustrate an integrative polity through a brief description of nineteenth-century Balinese kingdoms. Wet rice intensive agriculture supported the entirepopulation but not political power per se, since individual “irrigation societies”(subaks, consisting of up to 100 farmers) were economically independent andself-sufficient and crosscut dispersed hamlets or residential units (Geertz 1980 :50; Lansing 1991 : 4). The island of Bali is covered with rivers, streams, springs,and rich agricultural land but has no urban centers. Water is scarcer in the northpart of the island (Hauser-Schäublin 2003). Water allotment was crucial, sincefarmers relied on the “seasonal flow of rivers and springs” (Lansing 1991 : 38)during the five-month rainy season. Priests at water temples found throughoutBali allocated water, which was staggered and couched in ceremonial proceed-ings (Geertz 1980 : 82; Lansing 1991 : 117 – 118). This system was critical, since upto 100subaks relied on the same river (Lansing 1991 : 4). Husked rice was storedin storehouses built bysubakmembers (Hauser-Schäublin 2003). Various formsof clientship existed: between higher and lower ruling lineages, between rulingand priestly lineages, and between ruling lineages and communities (Geertz1980 : 34, 37 –38). The irrigation systems, consisting of dams, canals, dikes, divid-ers, tunnels, aqueducts, reservoirs, and terraces, were owned bysubaks (Geertz1980 : 69), though the land was owned by the gods (p. 128); and “the king wasrepresented as the prime ‘guardian,’ ‘custodian,’ or ‘protector,’ngurah,of theland and its life . . .” (p. 129). While there was no bureaucracy per se, there wasan official (perbekel) who served to link hamlets to kings (Geertz 1980 : 54).Several kingdoms competed for tribute. For example, in the nineteenth cen-tury the Dutch recognized eight kingdoms (Lansing 1991 : 17). The Balinese152Water and Ritual06-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 152"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"participated in foreign trade with other Southeast Asian countries to acquireexotics. People also acquired goods at local, regional, and large rotating mar-kets (Hauser-Schäublin 2003). Kingdoms were funded by clients, rent, trade,and taxation, in exchange for which farmers could use agricultural land (Lan-sing 1991 : 31, 103). Labor obligations also were owed to the king (p. 27). In ad-dition, each temple implemented tribute demands in exchange for their ser-vices in keeping the water flowing (p. 107). Politics particularly came into playwhen temples competed for tribute, especially during the dry season and /orduring drought, when temples were not “working” and rival temples claimedthat they could provide the needed water (pp. 107 – 108). Competition also ex-isted between temple priests and “princes” (p. 90). Sometimes competition es-calated to war, which, according to Clifford Geertz (1980 : 256), consisted of a“series of brief lance and dagger skirmishes” with few casualties. Warfare clearlyhad a ritual aspect to it.Bali had six great (regional) water temples (Geertz 1980 : 40; Lansing 1991 :44); in addition, eachsubakmaintained a water temple (Lansing 1991 : 81). Andof course each palace had a temple (p. 109). Each temple had a god, and thesegods controlled water and irrigation (Lansing 1991 : 53). Water and fertility ritestook place at all temples, with increasing grandeur and scale (Geertz 1980 : 40).“[A]ll traditional Balinese social units, from households to kingdoms, possesstheir own altars or temples, where regular offerings are made to the gods con-cerned with their affairs . . .” (Lansing 1991 : 50). “Ancestor shrines for com-moners may have from one to threemeruroofs, high-caste aristocrats, five ormore, with the highest rank of eleven roofs reserved for consecrated kings”(Lansing 1991 : 71). Royal ancestors were important in the lives of all Balineseand were acknowledged in various rites (Hauser-Schäublin 2003). The impor-tance of gods was reflected in the iconography, where major Indic (Hindu-Buddhist) gods (e.g., the supreme god, Siva, or the sun god, Surya), as well astraditional gods, were represented (Geertz 1980 : 105; Lansing 1991 : 63). Kingswere also represented in the iconography, and they left inscribed edicts through-out the land detailing settlement and temple borders, royal regulations, and re-quired offerings for particular shrines and temples (Hauser-Schäublin 2003).The king himself was a “ritual object” (Geertz 1980 : 131). “The extravaganceof state rituals was not just the measure of the king’s divinity . . . it was also themeasure of the realm’s well-being. More important, it was a demonstration thatthey were the same thing” (Geertz 1980 : 129). This fact, however, could notprevent their conquest by the Dutch in the mid-nineteenth century when thetraditional Balinese royal system collapsed (Lansing 1991 : 19). Ironically, thedisastrous consequences of the 1970s Green Revolution (use of modern tech-nology and fertilizers and planting crops at the same time) demonstrated theRegional Rulers and the Maya15306-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 153"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"critical importance of water temples, priests, and rituals (and formerly kings) in the allocation of water to prevent the spread of disease and pests (Lansing1991 : 111 – 126).In sum, centralized and integrative political systems differ from one anotherin the way in which the distribution of resources affects how people settle andsubsist, which in turn relates to political organization. Resources that are moreeasily accessed and where people are tied to the land facilitate the developmentof more centralized hierarchical political systems, whereas dispersed and di-verse resources typically do not. Another crucial element is seasonal rainfall—too much or too little. All systems, however, are similar in that rulers often pro-vide capital and sustenance (food and /or water) during times of need as well asallocate water and provide protection when necessary. Finally, political de-mands are superimposed on existing social and economic institutions that con-sequently are less affected by cyclical political histories. A greater reliance onlarge-scale water/agricultural systems in the face of seasonal vagaries and an ill-adaptive government can also be a formula for disaster.Late Classic (ca. ad550 – 850) river and nonriver major Maya centers haveseveral factors in common with centralized and integrative polities, as I detailbelow.The Maya: Regional CentersRiver CentersRegional centers, such as Palenque and Copán, are located along or near riverswith concentrated alluvium, more in line with archaic states found in temper-ate zones (see Figure 2.1) (e.g., Mesopotamian city-states, China, Egypt, andcoastal Andean South America). The major difference between regional andother centers is that they incorporate more people and have greater power. Atpresent I assign only two centers to this category, though others might be addedin the future (e.g., possibly Yaxchilán and Piedras Negras). The elevation ofPalenque and Copán is higher than that of minor and most secondary centersand similar to that of nonriver centers, from 200 to 550 m asl. Both are locatedon the edges of the Maya lowlands: Palenque to the northwest and Copán tothe southeast. Annual rainfall is both above and below that found at nonrivercenters; 130 cm at Copán and 370 cm at Palenque (see Figure 4.1). Alluvial soilssurrounding Copán are concentrated within a 24 sq km area (Webster 1999).Rulers also probably monopolized trade with highland areas for jade and ob-sidian (e.g., Fash 1991), especially utilitarian obsidian blades (Aoyama 2001).154Water and Ritual06-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 154"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Copán’s kings initially had the support of Tikal’s royal family to bolster theirclaims over others, since the founding ruler of Copán (ca. ad426 – 427), K’inichYax K’uk Mo’, may have been an “elite warrior” from Tikal (Sharer 2003).Copán’s occupants also built large reservoirs, which may have been managedand controlled by the political elite, based on their distribution and analysis ofwater symbolism (Fash 2005). Additionally, while the presence of ruralaguadassignifies some degree of self-reliance on the part of noncenter farmers, rela-tively low annual rainfall and undrinkable river water during the height of thedry season meant that local farmers relied on water management systems partof the year or even perhaps during the height of the rainy season, when heavyrains churned up sediment in the river (Davis-Salazar 2003; Fash and Davis-Salazar n.d.). As a consequence, people had fewer options and had to acquiesce to tribute demands. And since the surrounding hillsides are more difficult toplant — not to mention dealing with problems that result from heavy rainfalland erosion — farmers were more tied to the concentrated alluvium and centerand hence more susceptible to political machinations. They still, however, par-ticipated in exchange with Maya in other areas independent of elite or royal su-pervision (e.g., Webster and Gonlin 1988). Commoners thus had some lever-age, since they could either move far from the center or opt to gift their surplusto another ruler (e.g., Quiriguá).A similar situation existed at Palenque. Palenque overlooks a fertile valley(de la Garza 1992 : 51 –52). It sits “on a 2 \u0005 1 sq. km plateau 100 meters above theseasonally inundated plains to the north” (Barnhart 2001 : 70). A sharp escarp-ment lies to the south, and to the east and west “the mountainside becomesmore karstic and areas of habitable land appear only in isolated pockets” (p. 71).Within Palenque are over fifty streams and springs; inhabitants built aqueductsand canals to drain water away from the center — not too surprisingly, giventhat annual rainfall exceeds 360 cm (French 2002; French et al. n.d.). In addi-tion, people may have constructed irrigation canals on the plains below (Barn-hart 2001 : 101). The prevalence of water is also illustrated in the Maya name forPalenque, Lakam Ha or Big Waters (p. 100). Surrounding farmers relied on theplentiful water sources at Palenque, especially during the nonagricultural dryseason.Kings provided capital to maintain and repair water systems, especially sincethey were often damaged during heavy rainfall. They also handled water allo-cation issues or disputes. Finally, while there is little evidence for storage fa-cilities, rulers probably supplied food from their presumed extensive fields intimes of need (Lucero n.d.a).Settlement is typically dense around centers. For example, there are 1,449structures /km2within Copán’s core (0.6 km2) (Rice and Culbert 1990 : Ta-Regional Rulers and the Maya15506-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 155"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"ble 1.1; Webster and Freter 1990), and noticeably fewer structures in areas be-yond the alluvium (e.g., 28 – 99 structures /km2in rural Copán). Palenque’s sitecore (2.2 km2) has 643 structures /km2(Barnhart 2001 : Table 3.1).Rulers collected tribute from densely settled farmers because of their abilityto access concentrated resources, provide water and capital, sponsor integrativeevents, and incorporate lower-order centers and communities in the vicinity.As in secondary centers,chultuns for storage are small-scale and cluster aroundelite and royal residences, indicating their insignificant role in politics (Luceron.d.a). Texts do not mention a bureaucracy or administrators, a standing army,or a formal code of laws (Fox et al. 1996). Kings, though, probably providedsome degree of protection, especially to those farmers more tied to the land inthe immediate vicinity; however, commoners still had the option to flee else-where in the face of conflict. Kings could at least protect large-scale water sys-tems in the site core. While rulers did not have a standing army, they still couldmuster enough men to capture the rulers of other centers, especially secondaryones. Victory demonstrated to subjects of the vanquished rulers that it was bet-ter to support the victor. Corvée labor built large ball courts, private palaces,temples, and funerary temples. While rulers could easily access densely settledpeople, they still needed to integrate them, justify their rights to demand trib-ute, and promote solidarity in the face of political and economic inequality,which they did via public ritual events. For example, up to 3,000 observerscould have watched ball games at Copán and viewed other events from theGreat Plaza steps (Fash 1998). Maya farmers, however, still continued to con-duct traditional rites in their homes and communities.Kings are depicted in the iconography, as is water imagery (e.g., Fash 2005;Fash and Davis-Salazar n.d.; French 2002; French et al. n.d.; Scarborough1998). It is interesting to note that while water lilies cannot grow in Palenque’ssprings and flowing streams, their obvious ubiquity in the iconography in-dicates the importance of water symbolism in political ideology and ritualsthroughout the Maya region (see below). However, Edwin Barnhart (personalcommunication, 2002) suggests that some of the artificial pools could have sup-ported water lilies. For example, he notes that an artificial pool off an aqueductin the possible early central precinct Picota Plaza may have had water lilies,since water plants are present today, and it never dries up. Inscriptions alsohighlight the importance of kings and their relationship to the supernatural,watery world (Schele and Freidel 1990). Emblem glyphs of Copán and Palen-que are some of the most often mentioned outside their respective centers,probably indicating their greater power compared to other center rulers (Mar-cus 1976).Rulers of both river centers are some of the first kings to lose political powerin the Terminal Classic. Demand for surplus production instituted by rulers156Water and Ritual06-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 156"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"may have contributed to the over-exploitation of resources. For example, Co-pán’s farmers started to plant on the less-productive hillsides at the end of theLate Classic due to either competition or resource degradation (Wingard1996). Any decrease in surplus undermined the political system, whether it wascaused by resource degradation, decreasing water supplies, or both. Kings hadno choice but to abandon the trappings of what formerly defined Classic Mayapolitical life — palaces, temples, inscribed sculpture, and dynastic rites. A dis-ruption in the trade of exotics also would have lowered the prestige of rulers inthe eyes of their subjects (e.g., Demarest 2004; Hosler et al. 1977). Conse-quently, Copán and Palenque, but not necessarily their hinterlands, were largelyabandoned during the ninth century. While archaeologists do not agree on theoccupation history of Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic Copán and itshinterlands (Fash et al. 2004; Webster et al. 2004), there is no doubt that its rulers disappeared forever. And because of their close ties, the decline of regional rulers also contributed to the disruption of royal power at secondarycenters.Nonriver CentersNonriver centers such as Tikal, Calakmul, and Caracol are similar to river cen-ters except for several factors (see Table 2.1). They are located in upland areaswith large pockets of dispersed fertile land without permanent water sourcesbut with large artificial reservoirs located next to temples and palaces (see Fig-ure 2.1). Centers are located at higher elevations than minor or secondary cen-ters (over 245 m asl). The need for an adequate water supply is related to annualrainfall; it was typically less than at secondary and regional river centers (seeFigure 4.1). For example, annual rainfall at secondary centers ranges from over200 to over 280 cm; at Tikal it was just under 190 cm, at Calakmul just under170, and at Caracol 210 (Neiman 1997 : Table 15.1).Regional rulers collected tribute in return for providing drinking water dur-ing the dry season, particularly from January through April or May, when forall intents and purposes rainfall was nonexistent and the jungle became a greendesert (e.g., Folan et al. 1995; Ford 1996; Lucero 1999b; Scarborough 1991, 1993,1996; Scarborough and Gallopin 1991). At Tikal, for example, there are at leastsix major reservoirs, all located in the site core next to palaces and temples(Scarborough and Gallopin 1991).Peter Harrison (1993) correlates reservoir building with the accelerated con-struction of monumental architecture in Tikal’s core, especially beginning inthe Early Classic. Quarrying of reservoirs provided building materials for mon-umental construction projects, including limestone fill, wall facing, and plaster(Scarborough 1993). At Calakmul, which is surrounded bybajos(low-lying sea-Regional Rulers and the Maya15706-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 157"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"sonal swamps), there are extensive canal systems as well as thirteen reservoirsandaguadas(Braswell et al. 2004; Folan et al. 1995). Caracol has at least twomajor reservoirs next to temples and is literally surrounded by terraced hillsidesfor agriculture as well as water control (Chase and Chase 1996, 2001; Healyet al. 1983). Even if somebajosturn out to have been perennial wetlands or lakes(e.g., Culbert 1997; Dunning et al. 1998, n.d.; Hansen et al. 2002), their loca-tion at or near major centers would have provided rulers with even more waterand agricultural surplus at their disposal. This may have been more noticeablein higher elevations; Pope and Dahlin (1989) note that perennial wetlands aremore common in areas below 80 m asl. Until we have better information aboutbajos,however, I take a conservative approach and treat them all the same atpresent (i.e., as seasonal swamps).A challenge the Maya did face, however, was keeping standing water cleanduring the dry season. Standing water quickly becomes stagnant and providesprime conditions for insects and parasites to proliferate and, more significantly,can result in the build-up of noxious chemicals (e.g., nitrogen) (Burton et al.1979; e.g., Hansen et al. 2002). The natural wetland biosphere acts to sustainclean water if a balance of hydrophytic and aquatic plants is maintained (Ham-mer and Kadlec 1980; Nelson et al. 1980). Maya kings organized the mainte-nance of reservoirs during the dry season (Ford 1996) and performed importantrites to keep water clean (Fash 2005; Lucero 1999b; Scarborough 1998). In fact,Maya rulers appropriated traditional water rites and conducted them in grandsettings to demonstrate their success in propitiating the gods (Scarborough1998). Rulers conducted water rites at the sources themselves — reservoirs nextto temples.Settlement is dense around centers (e.g., 235 –557 structures /km2; Culbertet al. 1990) and in hinterland areas (e.g., up to 313 structures /km2; Folan et al.1995). People lived in farmsteads scattered throughout the landscape, mirroringthe distribution of good land, which made it challenging for rulers to bringpeople together to organize work parties, feasts, and ceremonies, not to men-tion to extract surplus. This fact did not prevent commoners from exchanginggoods with one another outside of elite or royal interference (e.g., Ford 1986).Similar to the situation at secondary centers, corvée labor probably only workedthe royal plots of land in the immediate vicinity of centers. Beyond this, kingshad to compensate laborers with exotics and a portion of the crop. Rulers, how-ever, funded large-scale public rituals in plazas at the foot of temples toattractand integrate farmers, especially during annual drought when water shortageswould have been a problem. In exchange, rulers received tribute in the form ofsurplus labor, goods, and food from farmers and people from lower-order cen-ters and communities in the vicinity (Lucero 1999b). Despite participating inroyal rites, Maya commoners conducted similar rites in the home on a much158Water and Ritual06-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 158"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"smaller and private scale. Again, small-scale storage facilities precluded theirrole in political life (Lucero n.d.a).Rulers interacted on an equal footing with other primary rulers through al-liances, marriages, and warfare and incorporated nearby secondary and minorcenters. Warfare was conducted to capture fellow royals, increase their prestigein the eyes of contributors, and attract more members into their political fold.For example, after kings from Caracol defeated those of Tikal twice in the lat-ter half of the sixth century (ad556 and 562), possibly with a little help fromtheir allies at Calakmul (Braswell et al. 2004; Chase and Chase 1989), manyfarmers appeared to have left the losing polity to join the successful one. Be-cause of their victory, Caracol’s kings were able to attract or persuade many ofthe Tikal’s former supporters to nucleate around Caracol (and perhaps Calak-mul; Marcus 2003) instead of Tikal. As a result of this population shift Cara-col’s kings had access to a dramatically larger labor pool, since it was obviousthat Caracol’s rulers had better supernatural connections than those at Tikal.Evidence for migration to Caracol includes a noticeable increase in settlementdensity in and near Caracol (Chase and Chase 1996), the large number of ter-races that appeared relatively quickly, and an increase in inscriptions and mon-umental building in the site core (Chase and Chase 1989). Arlen Chase and Di-ane Chase (1996) estimate that population increased 325 percent over the next130 years. Further, there are the indications that population growth slowed atTikal (27.5% for central Tikal and 15% for its hinterlands) (Haviland 1970).Commoners moved to Caracol’s realm to access the victor’s better supernaturalconnections.Thus, during the Classic period, “hiatus” (ad534 –593 and as late as 692 atTikal) — defined as a lessening or a cessation of stela erection and monumen-tal construction— probably represented labor and power shifts (e.g., Fry 1990).In other words, kings who did not have the means to attract the necessary la-bor could not afford to build monumental structures. Caracol’s rulers, however,were not the only ones competing for labor, as recorded in the inscriptions atLate Classic centers with the increasing mention of battles, intercenter ballgames, and the sacrifice of captives.Kings distributed exotics to lower-level elites and some commoners. Theyalso organized the construction of public works, ball courts, large administra-tive and private palaces, and funerary temples as well as utilized carved textsand emblem glyphs. Other than Caracol, nonriver center emblem glyphs arethe most frequently mentioned at other centers (Marcus 1976; Martin 2001). Inaddition, E-Group and Twin-Pyramid complexes are typically found only atnonriver centers (Arie 2001 : 49).Kings and water imagery were prevalent in the iconography and are visibleindicators of the relationship between water and political power, especiallyRegional Rulers and the Maya15906-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 159"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"their performance of water rituals and providing clean water (Lucero 1999b). Avisible sign of clean water is water lilies. Water lilies (Nymphaea ampla) are sen-sitive hydrophytic plants that can only grow in shallow (1 – 3 meter), clean, stillwater that is not too acidic and does not have too many algae or too much cal-cium (Conrad 1905 : 116; Lundell 1937 : 18, 26). Thus, the presence of water lilieson the surface ofaguadasand reservoirs is a visible indicator of clean water. Amajor symbol of royalty in Classic Maya society is the water lily and associatedelements (e.g., water lily pads, the water lily monster, etc.), which are found de-picted on stelae, monumental architecture, murals, and mobile wealth goodssuch as polychrome ceramic vessels (e.g., Fash 2005; Fash and Davis-Salazarn.d.; Hellmuth 1987; Puleston 1977; Rands 1953; Scarborough 1998). Ford (1996 :303) notes that Nab Winik Makna (Water Lily Lords) refers to Classic Mayakings. Water lilies often make up part of royal headdresses as well (Fash andDavis-Salazar n.d.). Often rulers have names that include “water” (e.g., WaterLily Lord of Tikal and Lord Water of Caracol). Further, kings impersonatedsun, maize, and other gods through the wearing of masks and costumes; “An-other deity impersonated by Maya lords . . . seems to be aquatic represented asa serpent with a water-lily bound to its head” (“water serpent”; Houston andStuart 1996 : 299).The continued supply of clean water meant that rulers were successful insupplicating gods and ancestors and that rulers had special ties to the super-natural world that benefited everyone — for a price, of course. Inscriptions andiconography amply illustrate that Classic Maya rulers had closer ties to impor-tant Maya deities, ancestors, and the supernatural world than the rest of Mayasociety (e.g., Houston and Stuart 1996; Marcus 1978; McAnany 1995; Scheleand Freidel 1990; Schele and Miller 1986).Farmers in hinterland areas without permanent water sources could notamass enough labor to build their own water catchment systems, since theylived dispersed throughout the hinterlands (e.g., Scarborough 2003 : 93). Dur-ing the rainy season, it would have been easy to store water in jars or other con-tainers, since supplies were replenished daily. They also relied onaguadas,buttheir small size would not have supported large numbers of people throughoutthe year. In addition, during the dry season water eventually evaporated insmalleraguadas(Scarborough 1996). Estella Weiss-Krejci and Thomas Sabbas(2002), however, suggest that archaeologists need to take into account small(7 – 722 m2, 0.4 – 1.0 m deep) natural and artificial depressions as possible year-round household water storage systems based on their work in northwesternBelize. But only four (25%) of the sixteen depressions they excavated were“good” candidates for water storage. They suggest that the Maya may have re-lied on the water stored in these depressions throughout the year and perhapsprevented evaporation by using covers, for example. Weiss-Krejci and Sabbas160Water and Ritual06-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 160"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"also note that in times of particularly bad dry spells that stored water would nothave lasted the entire dry season. Taken together, these factors suggest that atleast during the dry season many farmers had little choice but to rely on royalreservoirs, though perhaps a few family members stayed behind. Farmers didhave options as to which royal reservoir people paid to quench their thirst (e.g.,the Tikal /Caracol labor shifts discussed above).The Terminal Classic period (ca. ad850 – 950) witnessed the loss of politi-cal power. As long as the water supply was adequate, rulership lasted. For ex-ample, Tikal has one of the longest political histories in the entire southernMaya lowlands (inscriptions date from ad292 to 869). Clearly rulers were suc-cessful in expanding and maintaining their political base through providingwater and sponsoring integrative events. Their source of power, however, wassusceptible to fluctuations, especially in the water supply. This accounts for theabandonment of Maya royal centers by the ninth or tenth century (e.g., Bras-well et al. 2004; Valdés and Fahsen 2004). For example, Arlen Chase and Di-ane Chase (2004) demonstrate that the Maya at Caracol continued to buildmonumental architecture until after ca. ad800 and that nonroyal elites con-tinued to live in the epicenter until ca. ad895. They also note that when peopledid abandon Caracol, by ca. ad900, they did it relatively rapidly. As long assubsistence resources were available, however, farmers did not necessarily aban-don hinterland areas, since political events taking place at royal centers did notalways affect them. They continued to farm in small communities, participatein local and household ceremonies, and maintain small-scale water systems (e.g.,aguadas).In sum, we can better understand how the Maya lived at regional centersthrough what we know about centralized and integrative polities. The majordifference between centralized polities /river centers and integrative polities /nonriver centers is that in the former case most of the agricultural land is con-centrated along rivers rather than being dispersed in areas without surface wa-ter. As a consequence, there were different settlement patterns; farmers livednear where the land is fertile. Where farmers are more dispersed, rulers contin-ually had to maintain their ties with subjects through frequent feasts, ceremo-nies, and games. The nature of Maya warfare was different as well and relatedmore to status rivalry (Webster 1998) rather than conquest for labor per se. I am sure, however, that victorious kings benefited from access to greater laborpools — not by forcibly incorporating people but by attracting them due to theirsuccess as warriors and as intermediaries with gods and ancestors. Another dis-tinctive aspect of the Maya is the apparent lack of large-scale storage facilities.Combined factors of humidity, heat, and farming practices did not make theconstruction of large-scale storage facilities practical or feasible. A final differ-ence from most other ancient societies is the lack of clear evidence for markets,Regional Rulers and the Maya16106-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 161"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"though some Mayanists suggest plazas could have served as markets (e.g., Jones1991; Scarborough et al. 2003). The nature of subsistence practices — relativelyself-sufficient — and the archeological record indicate a royal and elite concernwith the long-distance exchange of prestige goods rather than utilitarian ones.Since there are many similarities between river and nonriver regional cen-ters, especially the degree of political power that rulers had, I only detail the rit-ual history at one such center, Tikal.Ritual History of TikalTikal is located in the Petén district, Guatemala, on top of an escarpment(250 m asl) surrounded by swampy areas to the west and east, earthworks to thenorth and south ( Jones et al. 1981), and large tracts of fertile land (Fedick andFord 1990).1It is one of the best-known and largest Maya centers (Figure 6.1).Since it is not near lakes or rivers, its inhabitants relied on several complex res-ervoir systems to offset seasonal water shortages (Scarborough and Gallopin1991), which are found next to temples and royal palaces. The central core(9 km2) consists of a densely built landscape of public and private monumentaland nonmonumental architecture (ca. 235 structures /km2) (Culbert and Rice1990 : Table 1). Annual rainfall is less than at secondary centers and Palenque,but more than at Copán (ca. 190 cm) (see Figure 4.1).Commoners were densely settled immediately around Tikal— for example,181 to 307 structures /km2in the 7 km2area immediately surrounding the coreand 112 to 198 structures /km2beyond that (Culbert and Rice 1990 : Table 1).They acquired goods through exchange with other commoners elsewhere, es-pecially for utilitarian goods, as well as prestige items (e.g., Haviland 1985). Thenearest known obvious agricultural systems (terraces) are ca. 28 km away (Har-rison 1993), though some of thebajosmight have supported two or three cropsper year (Scarborough 1993; e.g., Hansen et al. 2002).Chultuns, as is the case atother Maya centers, cluster at elite residences (see Puleston 1983 survey maps).Tikal was ruled by a “holy” or “divine” king (k’ul ahaw), who implementedtribute demands. Tikal has inscriptions, its own emblem glyph, water symbol-ism, palaces, royal funerary temples, large ball courts, and tall temples facinglarge and open plazas (e.g., Temple IV is 65 m tall). Its monumental complexesare connected viasacbeob(causeways). The earliest inscribed stela in the south-ern Maya lowlands (Stela 29, ad292) is found at Tikal, and it has one of thelongest dynastic histories in the Maya area (last known inscribed date: ad869).Rulers early on absorbed surrounding centers (e.g., Uaxactún).

Ilargely focus on the ritual history of the North Acropolis because of the exten-sive excavations conducted there by the University of Pennsylvania team andlater by Guatemalan archaeologists.The Maya began to build the North Acropolis sometime after 600 bcbydigging several pits, within which they placed a human skull and Preclassic ce-ramics. The earliest substantial architecture (300 – 200 bc) includes three suc-cessive platforms (5D-Sub.14-3rd, -2nd, -1st), each comparable in size to a largethatched house on a platform, approximately 6 \u00056 m, similar in size to SC-18and SC-85 at Saturday Creek. William Coe (1965c:12 – 13) describes the last ofthese three temples (5D-Sub.14-1st) as follows:The roof was probably of thatch with poles at the corners. . . .

Pits in bedrock in front of theseplatforms yielded other insights. One contained a young adult . . . with anecklace of shell pendants and imported jade and shell beads. . . . The otherpit contained the incomplete disarticulated remains of an adult accompa-nied by fragments of one or more stingray spines [used for ceremonial bloodletting].This pattern of burning and destroying — terminating — earlier architecturalfeatures continues throughout the building of the North Acropolis (Coe1990 : 506).The Maya also dedicated each construction event. As early as ca. ad1 –50, alidded jar with shell and jade beads was found on top of one of the platformstairways associated with Str. 5D-Sub.1-1st (Table 6.1). At a contemporarytemple with four stairways (Str. 5C-54) beneath the base of the east stairway the Maya had placed a large lidded red vessel containing a carved jade pen-dant depicting a bearded man (Coe 1965c). In the wall core of an early templedating to ad1 – 150, Str. 5D-26-5th, the Maya deposited two perforated clamshells, two obsidian blade fragments, two chert flakes, and four bone fragments(Coe 1990 : 275). In the next phase (5D-26-4th), dating to ad100 – 175, the Mayadug a small pit in which they placed the sherds of a large polychrome bowl(pp. 279 – 280).The earliest clearly elite or royal burial at the North Acropolis is associatedwith Platform 5D-Sub-10 (Burial 166), dating to ca. 50 bc. The Maya en-tombed two females in a corbel-vaulted chamber with painted designs on red-plastered walls along with twenty vessels, some with powdered cinnabar, jadeand shell beads, stingray spines, and a carved shell pendant (Coe 1965c). An-other elite burial located within Platform 5D-4-7th (No. 85, dating to ad1 – 150)consisted of a simple chamber with small slabs as a roof, within which a bun-dled male was buried with his legs severed and without a skull. Twenty-six ves-sels were also interred, as well as a cylindrical jade bead, a greenstone mask withshell eye and dental inlays, a perforated marine shell, a stingray spine, an ob-sidian blade, a stuccoed wood bowl, possible cinnabar dust (perhaps all that re-mains of a red-painted textile or mat), and other objects (Coe 1990 : 217 – 219).Burial 85 actually might contain the remains of the first acknowledged ruler ofTikal, Yax Ehb’ Yook (?) (Martin 2003). Whether burials were public or privateevents, the fact that these burials were found in monumental buildings distin-guishes them from residential burials.Commoner Maya practiced similar, though simpler, rites, as did their peersat Saturday Creek, Altar de Sacrificios, and other Maya centers.166Water and Ritual06-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 166"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Table 6.1.

Within Str. 5D-26-1st, in the floor of one of the tworooms (Room 2), archaeologists found incised obsidian, obsidian blades, cherteccentrics, a mano fragment, large faunal remains, twenty-two sawfish spikes,marine shell, twenty-seven porcupine fish dermal spines, part of a tripod bowl,a censer ladle encrusted with soot, and a figurine head fragment (Coe 1990 :302). They recovered similar items in the floor of Room 1A, as well as jade mo-saic pieces, a miniature clay head, three sharpened bone fragments, soft sponge,and cinnabar-coated stingray spines (Coe 1990 : 304 –305). These caches con-trast with those found in residences about 1 km to the northeast, which consistof single sets of lip-to-lip vessels (Haviland 1985 : 155 – 156).Elite Maya distinguished their ancestors from common ones by buryingtheir dead in eastern shrines, which first appear in the Early Classic (Becker1999 : 144). For example, Burial 84 in Str. 4G-9-B, dating to ca. ad250 –550,consists of a crypt dug into bedrock sealed with stone slabs (p. 13). An adult wasinterred with a basal flange bowl, a fire-clouded bowl, jade beads (including aspherical one), andSpondylusvalves (pp. 13 – 14). Commoner residential burialsat Tikal are similar to those at Saturday Creek and Altar de Sacrificios. For ex-ample, Burial 33, just south of Str. 4F-7, includes an adult male with an in-complete vessel (Haviland 1985 : 134). In contrast, Burial 48, associated withtemple 5D-33-1st of the North Acropolis, consisted of a chamber with a domedceiling and walls painted with hieroglyphs (Coe 1990 : 118 – 119; Harrison 1999 :89 – 90) that contained three individuals (possibly including the ruler SiyahChan K’awil and sacrificial victims), one with a severed head, placed on matsor skins, along with 30 vessels, over 400 jade beads, a metate and mano, hema-tite items, obsidian blades, quartzite pebbles, an alabaster vessel, about 30 dif-ferent species of marine shell, and nearly 700 jade pieces (perhaps part of a mo-saic) (Coe 1990 : 120 – 122). Its location at the foot of an imposing temple facinga plaza may indicate a public ceremony venerating a royal ancestor.Termination rituals are indicated by burned floors at every residence (Hav-iland 1985) as well as burned and smashed items such as ceramics.

One of the most imposingtemples at Tikal, Temple I, served as the funerary temple of Tikal’s most pow-erful ruler, Hasaw Chan K’awil (Heavenly Standard Bearer), who ruled fromad682 until about ad734 (Burial 116) (Harrison 1999 : 143 – 145). It overlooks alarge plaza where subjects likely witnessed the interment of their deceased king.With him were entombed over twenty vessels, slate plaques, alabaster dishes,carved and incised bone, and more than sixteen pounds of jade items, includ-ing a mosaic-lidded vase. His family members and priests laid him to rest on ajaguar pelt, the major symbol of Maya kingship. In contrast, Late Classic buri-als found beneath the floors of one of the five structures of Group 2G-1, a non-royal Tikal residence less than 2 km northeast of the North Acropolis, werequite simple and involved family members only. Burial 57 consisted of a maleplaced in a “bedrock grave containing three vessels”; another male (Burial 54)was buried with only “a single broken vessel and a clay bead” (Haviland 1988 :125). A similar pattern is found at residences located less than 1 km northeast ofthe North Acropolis. For example, Groups 4F-1 and 4F-2 burials yielded poly-chrome bowls and some small jade pieces (Haviland 1985).Commoner and elite burials are similar to those described for SaturdayCreek and Altar de Sacrificios. In the summit of Str. 4G-9 of Group 4G-1, the eastern structure (shrine) of an elite residence, archaeologists came upon amasonry-block “box-like” crypt sealed with slabs (Burial 81) (Becker 1999 : 12).It consists of a long bone fragment, four Ik vessels, a “smashed and incompleteKau Incised cylinder bearing on its exterior a now-famous bird-with-fish mo-tif and inscriptions” (p. 12), an unworkedSpondylusvalve, and other shell frag-ments. At another elite burial (Burial 89), dating to ca. ad700 – 850 in the fillof Str. 4H-4-2nd of Group 4H-1, the Maya interred an adult male who hadcorner-notched incisors, with three vessels, an inverted and killed bowl under-neath the skull, a bowl, and a polychrome cylinder with a “four-vent rattle basecontaining 56 clay pellets” (Becker 1999 : 24).Termination rites at Tikal, especially indicated by burned plaster floors andbroken items, are evidenced throughout small houses and monumental build-ings. For example, tripod sherds and a chert biface were found on a burned floorof Str. 4F-4, a commoner residence (Haviland 1985 : 155). A residential platform(4F-8) contained a pit with burning on the inside and half a burned jar (p. 83).At the North Acropolis, Coe (1990 : 525) writes, “Fire and presumably incenseappear to have been a functional constant.” The Maya burned copal in censersand then broke them (e.g., Temple 5D-22-1st, Platform 5D-4-1st).Regional Rulers and the Maya17306-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 173"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Summary and DiscussionSite formation processes similar to those at Saturday Creek and Altar de Sacri-ficios shaped small and monumental structures at Tikal. In “almost constantrenovation, razing, and renewed construction” (Coe 1965c:13), ever-larger templecomplexes grew over these early deposits. This process clearly resembles house-hold rituals, albeit on an increasingly grand and public scale. Caches, burials,burned deposits, and destroyed objects are found throughout the depositionalhistory of the North Acropolis and other monumental architecture. Throughtime in elite and later royal contexts, ritual activities became more labor inten-sive, exotic, political, and public but materially remained tied to traditions, in-cluding those supplicating gods and ancestors for water and other critical ele-ments in life.Rulers of Tikal conducted the same rituals as elsewhere but on a much largerand public scale. The life histories of monumental public buildings demon-strate ritual replication and expansion of dedication, ancestor veneration, andtermination rites. These buildings face large plazas in which hundreds, if notthousands, of people witnessed and participated in ritual events. Further, be-cause of their location these public arenas function as acoustic marvels. One canstand on top of Temple II, for example, speak, and be heard by all below. Aptly,the titleahawcan be translated as “he who shouts” (Houston and Stuart 2001),which would go well with the idea of the king performing, communicating im-portant information, and conducting rites for the people below. Elite and com-moner residences show the same depositional histories but on a smaller scale,more in line with those seen at Saturday Creek, Barton Ramie, Altar de Sacri-ficios, and Cuello. The goods that elites and commoners interred or destroyedas offerings, however, were not as ornate as the items found in royal contexts.Kings at Tikal and comparable nonriver and river centers were vulnerable tochanging material conditions because of seasonal water fluctuations and reli-ance on large-scale water/agricultural systems. Ritual can only go so far in bring-ing people into the political system. Kings need to feed and entertain farmersas well as provide water during seasonal drought and /or capital to repair wa-ter/agricultural systems damaged by heavy rains. When they could no longer doso, they lost their major means of extracting food and services from subjects.People voted with their feet and withdrew their support of Classic Maya kings.A few hardy souls reoccupied royal homes (“squatters”) or remained in hinter-land areas; they all continued to conduct traditional rites, at least through ca.ad1000 (e.g., at Temples I, II, and III and other buildings) (Valdés and Fah-sen 2004).174Water and Ritual06-T3558 12/20/05 4:44 PM Page 174"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"The main question I have attempted to address in this book is how a few peopleget others to contribute labor and services without compensating them equally.In Chapter 1, I have presented a model of how emerging rulers use several typesof traditional rituals in various settings to acquire and maintain political power,as well as how such power eventually can be lost. In brief, while the means ofacquiring political power vary, the general processes of situating political changetypically do not, and material support is a must — namely, surplus goods and la-bor. Ritual expansion occurs in tandem with political change and expresses andexplains it within familiar cultural constructs. Ritual thus advances politicalagendas through presenting the new mixed in with the old. When surplus andlabor are no longer available, political power is lost. In times of trouble, no mat-ter how many ornate rituals rulers perform, they clearly no longer have specialties to the supernatural world. Indeed, rituals without results only highlightroyal failures (e.g., Weber 1964 [1951]; Wortman 1985).Maya rituals have a long history. The beliefs surrounding them, of course,no doubt varied at any given time as well as changed through time. There islittle doubt that ritual scale and settings transformed as well. What did notchange, however, is the fact that everyone performed traditional rites in thehome as well as community, elite, and, in some cases, royal ones. The only dif-ference is that the Maya conducted rites in the home and community before,during, and after the appearance and disappearance of kingship.In this chapter, I document the rise and fall of Maya kings by integrating thehistory of Maya rulership (Chapter 2) and ritual (Chapters 4, 5, and 6). I detailthe Maya collapse and conclude with a brief discussion of the aftermath and apossible scenario for the emergence and demise of Classic Maya rulers.CHAPTER 7The Rise and Fall of Classic Maya Rulers07-T3558 12/20/05 4:45 PM Page 175"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Water and Ritual: The Emergence of Maya RulersThe archaeological evidence presented in the previous chapters indicates that(1) small and large Maya structures have structurally and functionally similardepositional histories consisting of caches under floors, burials with gravegoods, and burned and broken objects on floors; (2) there is a gradual and in-cremental increase in scale of ritual activities through time, particularly at cen-tral, monumental public buildings; and (3) rituals never left the home. Com-moners, elites, and royals conducted the “same” rites, albeit at an increasinglygrand and public scale spatially (from house to elite compound to palace andtemple) and chronologically, from the Late Preclassic through Classic periods.These rites were particularly suited for political appropriation because theyconcern life, death, and renewal, elements important in the lives of all Maya.Emerging Maya leaders replicated and expanded rituals and other traditionalrites, including water ceremonies and those revolving around other crucial ele-ments in life.Maya elites and royals used more expensive and exotic ritual items as well ascontinued to use the same (or similar) objects as commoners did. For example,sherds with a molded face design found at Saturday Creek and small residencesat Altar de Sacrificios transformed into pottery masks and shell or jade mosaicmasks in royal contexts at Altar de Sacrificios and Tikal. Notched obsidian andchert flakes and tools were elaborated into beautifully chipped eccentrics. AllMaya deposited human finger bones and fauna phalanges and other bones; theonly difference is the container in which the Maya placed bones — sherds, lip-to-lip vessels, or royal tombs. A similar pattern of elaboration is seen in jadebeads (from small spherical jade beads to large multishaped ones and mosaicobjects), fragments of decorated items (small figurines to pieces of monumen-tal architectural features, stelae, and altars), sherd clusters (undecorated to fancydecorated smashed vessels), killed ceramics (rimless vessels to those with killholes), and other objects (e.g., ceramic and stone discs, stone balls, mica, andminiature vessels).One type of artifact used for ritual purposes by all Maya is metates and ma-nos. They are found fragmented or whole in commoner, elite, and royal con-texts. The Maya sacrificed tools critical in everyone’s life, which represent thenever-ending importance of maize in daily life — economically, socially, politi-cally, and religiously. Elites and royals also found ways to distinguish them-selves physically from the majority, especially in their own person and in death.Cranial deformation and inlaid teeth were common means, though some com-moners filed their teeth, and a few even had inlaid teeth. Distinctions weremaintained after death; commoners were buried in house floors, elites interredin shrines, and royals entombed in burial crypts and tombs.

Membership was based on Maya participa-tion in events that benefited them all— propitiating the gods, not to mentionforging a link between Maya farmers and political agents through debt rela-tions and obligations. Commoners participated and contributed to their ownpolitical domination— as long as kings met their side of the bargain. This wasmade possible in part by royal persons’ advancing and situating political changein traditional formats. Such events increasingly solidified and institutionalizeda ruler’s ability to acquire surplus through the creation of long-term obligations.While it is not possible to assess whether or not the earliest political rites werea conscious effort on the part of elites, I am certain that they soon realized thepolitical benefits of successfully reaching the gods.Pathways to political power in the southern Maya lowlands were similar.The scale on which rulers conducted rituals, however, the number of peoplethey integrated, and the amount of surplus they acquired varied and were influ-enced by material factors and historical circumstances. Material factors includeseasonal vagaries and the amount of surplus at hand; historical factors includethe density of centers and rulers in any given area. While the variable distribu-tion of land, water, and people presented a challenge to those seeking power,the strategies used by rulers to situate and advance political power were thesame, entailing the replication and expansion of traditional rituals. These ma-terial factors and social strategies worked as long as there was enough water andfood. When there was not, farmers blamed rulers, who had in the past claimedintimacy with supernatural forces.For Saturday Creek and Barton Ramie — located on broad alluvial soils —community leaders sponsored local ceremonies, and occupants may or may nothave been beholden to rulers at secondary or regional centers. Elites could notdemand surplus labor and goods from community members because resourcesand water were plentiful year-round and accessible to all. Farmers thus weremore self-sufficient and did not have to rely on royal or elite capital, food, orwater systems. Consequently, elites did not have the means to exact tribute. Asmembers of a larger society, however, residents interacted with their counter-parts elsewhere socially (e.g., marriage) and economically (e.g., exchange). Elitessponsored traditional ceremonies at small temples to allay conflict in the face ofwealth differences, to increase their prestige, and to promote solidarity.It is almost counterintuitive that rulers did not emerge in areas with suchplentiful, year-round resources (e.g., Kirch 1994). In addition to the reasonscited above, specific historic circumstances might account for the lack of rulersThe Rise and Fall of Classic Maya Rulers17707-T3558 12/20/05 4:45 PM Page 177"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"at minor centers; for example, their peripheral location on the eastern frontierof the southern Maya lowlands made it more difficult to interact with centraland western polities. In essence, elites interested in becoming kings could notoffer anything that people could not attain themselves. In other words, therewere no obvious inducements for commoners to gift their valuable surplus topolitical leaders. Group effort, not corvée labor, thus built small temples andball courts.Rulers with varying amounts of power, however, arose at secondary centers.The major material difference between minor and secondary centers was thatoccupants of the latter had more noticeable seasonal issues with which to con-tend, a patchy distribution of agricultural soils, and a greater reliance on small-scale water/agricultural systems, which were also scattered. At Altar de Sacri-ficios, kings owned or controlled land in the immediate vicinity, from whichthey generated enough wealth to maintain a royal lifestyle. Farmers near thecenter probably worked royal lands in exchange for a portion of the crop. Rulersalso acquired power and prestige through their participation in the royal inter-action sphere (e.g., marriage and prestige-goods exchange). They did not ac-quire the degree of power held by kings at regional centers because they did nothave the means to attract farmers from beyond the site core and immediate en-virons; basically, kings did not have much of a role in assisting commoners inmaintaining water/agricultural systems, which did not bode well for the sup-port of primary rulers. The situation was similar at other secondary centers.Farmers did not have to rely as much on capital provided by rulers, since waterand agricultural systems were repaired and maintained at the household andcommunity levels. Kings thus invested much wealth in public ceremonies andfeasts to attract as many farmers as they could, as reflected in their ornate pub-lic iconography and buildings. Integrative events also served to define socialmembership in a larger community and provided the opportunity to exchangegoods, visit friends and family, participate in ceremonies, games, and feasts, andlook for potential mates.A major difference between secondary and primary rulers was that the lat-ter were involved in the building and maintenance of large-scale water systems(most of which are found next to royal architecture), on which many common-ers relied during annual drought. The main difference between nonriver andriver regional centers, other than location, is the distribution of agriculturalland (concentrated alluvium or large dispersed plots). At Tikal and other non-river centers, rulers replicated and expanded traditional rituals on an increas-ingly grand scale in public forums to attract and integrate dispersed farmers, topromote solidarity, situate political change, and legitimate their rights to exacttribute. Through ceremonies, kings demonstrated their close ties with impor-tant deities and ancestors and their involvement in the continuity of vital ele-178Water and Ritual07-T3558 12/20/05 4:45 PM Page 178"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"ments of life such as rain and fertility. Consequently, their power extended be-yond the duration of ceremonies and ultimately sanctified tribute obligations.At river centers such as Copán, rulers relied on water management as a meansto appropriate surplus, and they also had access to nearby densely settled farm-ers. Inadequate water supply was less of an issue for Palenque’s kings; their con-cern was to divert and control water to prevent overflow and flooding. Waterwas plentiful for surrounding farmers in the dry season. Palenque’s kings con-ducted large-scale rituals to integrate people, justify their rights to demandtribute, and promote solidarity in the face of political and economic inequal-ity. Rulers of Copán and Palenque also provided capital to repair water/agri-cultural systems during and after each rainy season and dealt with water alloca-tion issues.A History of Maya Ritual and RulershipIn Chapter 2, I have detailed the history of Maya rulership. In this section I present highlights of this history and tie them into ritual replication and expansion.In the Late Preclassic period (ca. 250 bc–ad250), high-ranking lineageswere transformed into royal ones. Elites and the earliest kings began to repli-cate and expand traditional rites in relatively grand settings. Elite tombs andexpensive items distinguish offerings of emerging political leaders from the restof the Maya, who continued to conduct the same rites in the home in a moreprivate and simpler manner. Monumental architecture served as arenas for pub-lic ceremonies and feasts. Inscriptions also focused on ceremonial events, noton individuals. However, early kings were distinguished with the title ofahawas well as their use of Olmec royal iconography.Minor centers were well established, while regional ones were just emerg-ing. Not all nonriver elites and kings succeeded politically, for various mate-rial and historical reasons. For example, nascent rulers at Uaxactún, Nakbé, ElMirador, and other centers were subsumed into political systems of powerfulneighbors at an early stage, for various reasons —Uaxactún to Tikal and Nakbéand El Mirador to Calakmul. In some cases, lack of agricultural land preventedlarge groups of people from settling in areas (e.g., Fedick and Ford 1990; Ford1991b). El Mirador, with the largest and earliest Preclassic temple (El Tigre),lost most of its inhabitants at the end of the Late Preclassic (ca. ad250) (Ma-theny 1987), perhaps due to problems with reservoirs silting up (Hansen et al.2002; Scarborough 1993), drought (Dahlin 1983), or political subjugation (Mar-cus 2003). If the first kings could have dealt with the reservoir and other prob-lems at El Mirador, they no doubt would have become some of the most pow-erful rulers in the southern Maya lowlands.The Rise and Fall of Classic Maya Rulers17907-T3558 12/20/05 4:45 PM Page 179"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"The Early Classic period (ca. ad250 –550) witnessed full-blown Maya ruler-ship and the continued importance of domestic rituals conducted at home,within the community, and in public political forums. Inscriptions detailed thelives of kings, especially their esoteric knowledge and ties to the supernaturalrealm and distant places such as Teotihuacan. Royal dynasties represented them-selves as descent groups writ large, as visibly depicted on public monumentalstelae as well as on royal architecture. Rulers emphasized the importance ofroyal ancestors in the lives of all through large public ceremonies with large au-diences and their closer ties to major deities such as Chac and the maize god.Inscriptions indicate the dedication of monumental buildings as well as newfeatures, including conquests and capture of royal persons, royal visitations,heir accession, and bloodletting and period-ending rites.The power of rulers at regional centers grew. Secondary rulers emerged, of-ten with the help of powerful neighbors and allies, typically through marriagealliances. Maya at minor centers continued essentially the same, other than deal-ing with the natural progression of things, including the growing number offarmers. Wealthy individuals increasingly participated in the elite interactionsphere.The Late Classic period (ca. ad550 – 850) witnessed the pinnacle of royalpublic rituals, not to mention the continuation of traditional rites in the homeand community. Kings expanded traditional rites to their greatest extent andperformed ornate royal rituals to highlight their ties to Maya deities and to theotherworld. Rulers also reached heights of power never before witnessed, as ev-idenced by the titlek’ul ahaw.Persons of royal blood were entombed in funer-ary temples that faced large and open plazas. Inscriptions and iconography il-lustrate the proliferation of both private and public royal or nondomestic ritesin addition to pan-Maya ones, including ball games, royal marriages, deity im-personations, period-ending rites, royal anniversaries, royal visitations, heir ac-cession, sacrifice of royal captives, bloodletting, and other rites.Regional powerhouses jockeyed for more power, especially Tikal and Ca-lakmul and their respective allies. Battles and the capture of enemy kings wereincreasingly common themes in the iconographic and written records. If cir-cumstances allowed, secondary rulers took advantage of competition amongprimary rulers to expand their political horizons (e.g., Quiriguá).Throughout the Terminal Classic period (ca. ad850 – 950), Maya kings lostpolitical power. Clearly, royal rituals no longer benefited people, who thus wereno longer obligated to pay taxes. Several secondary rulers built monuments ontheir own, independent of major centers, and some experienced a brief flo-rescence. Farmers abandoned regional centers and either lived permanently inhinterland areas or left the southern Maya lowlands altogether. They still con-tinued to perform domestic and community rites, however. The last known in-180Water and Ritual07-T3558 12/20/05 4:45 PM Page 180"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"scriptions at many centers mention warfare, which probably resulted fromproblems that rulers no longer could solve. Many later Terminal Classic in-scriptions no longer incorporate rulers or dynasties but instead emphasize dei-ties, such as those witnessed at Chichén Itzá. Newcomers to the southern low-lands, perhaps attracted to weakening polities, came for a time, only to leavedue to the same reason that caused indigenous kings to lose power — inade-quate water supplies.DiscussionAdopting and expanding familiar traditional rites allowed Maya kings to buildand maintain an unequal relationship of sanctified rights and obligations thatprimarily benefited the sponsor. Emphasizing the positive aspects of unequalrelations through ritual (being better able to propitiate and communicate withancestors, rain deities, and other supernatural forces) was not so much manip-ulative as it was integrative. The Maya were not being led blindly — they hadchoices. For example, some dispersed into the hinterlands or contributed toother kings. Many farmers, though, participated in redefining their rights andobligations only because kings demonstrated their success in acquiring wealth,funding larger ceremonies, and contacting the supernatural realm to bring forthrain and bountiful crops.Maya kings undoubtedly instituted new practices, such as the use of hiero-glyphic writing to record dynastic histories, ritual warfare, human sacrifice, thedeification of royal ancestors, the dedication of stelae (caching beneath themand the caching of stelae themselves), the use of Olmec and Teotihuacan im-agery to bolster rulers’ claims of special knowledge and skill, the use of specialbuildings as astronomical observatories, and the wearing of special costumesthat allowed them to personify deities and demonstrate their closer ties to thegods as living ancestors of apotheosized kings (Houston and Stuart 1996). Itwas all about display and interacting — political theater (Demarest 1992; Ino-mata 2001a). Sponsoring traditional rites promoted solidarity, since rulers andsubjects performed the same rituals. New rites, in contrast, distinguished royalpersons from others. As long as these rites served to show the powers of kings,they still promoted integration and political agendas.At the height of their power, regional kings conducted restricted rites for aselect few in their palaces and public rites on top of temples and on lower pal-ace platforms. New and restricted royal rites typically were performed in thesmall rooms on top of temples, not visible to the Maya below. But the peoplebelow knew that rulers conducted these secretive rites, after which they wouldemerge and perform rites more suitable for public consumption and participa-tion. Most restricted royal rites, however, were limited to small-scale activitiesThe Rise and Fall of Classic Maya Rulers18107-T3558 12/20/05 4:45 PM Page 181"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"not necessarily appropriate for nonroyal viewing or participation. For example,many of the Late Classic painted vessels depict private royal activities that tookplace inside palaces, probably for court members and a few invited guests (e.g.,Inomata 2001b), and include eating, drinking a ritual cacao beverage, making of-ferings, and greeting royal personages from other centers (Reents-Budet 1994 :84 – 99). Other events recorded on vessels include tribute payments, hunts, ballgames, auto-sacrifice, and the sacrifice of captives (Reents-Budet 1994 : 262 –264). Kings also performed and recorded events more conducive to public dis-play, including human sacrifice carried out on the top of temples and recordedon stelae and ball games played in the ball courts (Freidel et al. 1993 : 259, 355).Most monumental architecture reflects the importance of royal and nonroyalinteraction, usually fronting large plazas for feasts, festivals, performances, cer-emonies, social gatherings, alliance building, and exchange. There were alsoball courts for reenactments of the origin myth, intercenter ball games, localball games, and feasts (e.g., Fox 1996).Some kings may have been so powerful that they did not have to performtraditional rites, though they still performed public royal ones. For example,Chase and Chase (1998) note that not all Late Classic palace deposits at Cara-col have ritual caches, particularly Ca’ana, one of the most restricted Mayatemple-palace complexes, especially the upper platforms (Chase and Chase2001). Instead, caches are typically found in front of structures in plazas. Thelack of palace caches may indicate that rulers no longer had to perform publicdedication ceremonies for palaces but instead performed public rituals in pla-zas. Or perhaps the massive size of Ca’ana prevented audiences below from be-ing able to see royal performances, and thus kings had to move the show downto the plaza level. In another possible example, William Fash (1998 : 261) notesthat while center layout varies from site to site, later construction styles moreor less mirror earlier ones; and a consistent pattern exists throughout ClassicMaya royal architecture, having to do with the “renewal of tried and trusted re-ligious themes.” Consequently, anything that varies from this pattern signifiesa different message. “This makes the massive redesign of the Copan Acropolisby Waterlily Jaguar [early sixth century ad] . . . and the shifting of the triadicplan from the North Acropolis to the Great Plaza by Ruler A [Hasaw ChanK’awil] of Tikal . . . stand out as the daring work of visionaries” (Fash 1998 : 259 –260). Change may also indicate, as in the Caracol case, a lessening need forkings to follow the status quo and explore new — nontraditional— ideas andstyles in light of their ability to do so.Traditional public rites conducted by royals were not exclusive but weresuperimposed on domestic and community ones. Consequently, they were notunder royal or central authority: everyone could and did perform them in thehome and community. The core royal rituals focused on the same issues of daily182Water and Ritual07-T3558 12/20/05 4:45 PM Page 182"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"survival— fertility, rain, and ancestors —but according to a ritual calendar.Hinterland and commoner Maya conducted traditional rites in their homes inaccordance with their own needs and schedules and also participated in elitecommunity and royal ceremonies at set times in public arenas. Even though allMaya conducted the same traditional rites, this does not mean that traditionalrituals did not change or that new ones were not added in response to political,social, or economic changes (Gossen and Leventhal 1993; Ringle 1999). Ritu-als, however, are more conservative than the beliefs that revolve around them(see Robertson Smith 1956 [1894] : 18).In sum, Maya kings demonstrated that they had special ties to the super-natural world that benefited everyone, and this enabled them to appropriate thesurplus of others. As long as benefits continued, all was well. If farmers per-ceived that rulers were not keeping their side of the bargain, however, there wasno longer any reason for them to participate in royal events and, more signifi-cantly, to contribute labor and goods.Water and Ritual: The Political CollapseAs mentioned in Chapter 1, a collapsed society can be defined as one that is“suddenly smaller, less differentiated and heterogeneous, and characterized byfewer specialized parts; it displays less social differentiation; and it is able to ex-ercise less control over the behavior of its members” (Tainter 1988 : 38). There islittle doubt that this is what happened in the southern Maya lowlands, espe-cially in regard to the loss of control over others. As briefly mentioned earlier,cases where a political vacuum remains are rare. What happened to cause sucha drastic response, where centers were abandoned and some hinterland areaswere for all intents and purposes largely deserted?Before addressing this question, it is important to define the term “collapse.”To begin with, not everyone defines Terminal Classic events as a collapse. Forexample, Sabloff (1992) suggests that better economic opportunities, such assalt trade, attracted people to the northern Yucatán lowlands. Marcus (1993,1998), using ethnohistoric accounts of Postclassic and colonial Maya politicalhistories, proposes that there were neither “golden ages” nor “collapses,” butrather cycles of “peaks” and “troughs.” Peaks were periods when regional cen-ters politically incorporated a number of secondary centers. Troughs were pe-riods when secondary rulers “broke away” from regional centers because theywere able to attract more supporters. There is no doubt that cycles occurred, asMarcus details. However, the Terminal Classic “trough” resulted in the aban-donment of large parts of the southern Maya lowlands and did not just reflecta period of decentralization. Indeed, earlier periods did witness cycles of someThe Rise and Fall of Classic Maya Rulers18307-T3558 12/20/05 4:45 PM Page 183"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"degree of centralization and fragmentation. The major difference is that thiscycle or process took place in the southern Maya lowlands; in contrast, Termi-nal Classic political centralization occurred in an entirely new area — the north-ern lowlands — and consisted of joint rule, and the Classic period powerhousesof the southern lowlands were no longer part of the political landscape. In otherwords, peaks and troughs do happen, but usually within the same general area.When the entire cycle fails altogether, however, this needs explaining, espe-cially since it is a rare occurrence.I define “collapse” in political terms: societies do not fail; political institu-tions do. In the case of the Maya, kings disappeared; people did not. Basically,rulers lost their means of support, which resulted in their being unable to main-tain a royal lifestyle. Elites and commoners were affected to various degrees.Events occurring during the Terminal Classic period at regional centers hadvarious effects or no effect at all on lower-order centers: some were abandoned,some became independent, some experienced a brief spurt of power, and somecontinued as they had (Marcus 1976 : 186 – 190, 1994; Webster 2002 : 212 – 214).After the Terminal Classic, traditional ceremonies continued; rituals vital indefining Classic Maya rulership, however, disappeared in the southern low-lands, along with the power that had allowed kings to maintain such a rich rit-ual and political lifestyle.What set in motion the erosion of Classic Maya rulership in the TerminalClassic (ca. ad850 – 950)? Numerous explanations have been suggested, whichI have also listed elsewhere (Lucero 2002a). These include climate change ordrought (Brenner et al. 2002; Curtis et al. 1996; Dahlin 1983; Folan et al. 1983;Gill 2000; Gunn et al. 1995; Hodell et al. 1995, 2001; Lowe 1985); increasedmono-cropping (Atran 1993); environmental and ecological degradation in theface of increasing population (Abrams and Rue 1988; Culbert 1977; Hosler et al.1977; Sabloff and Willey 1967; Santley et al. 1986); foreign intrusion (Cowgill1964); internal warfare (Demarest 1997); increasing competition (Bove 1981;Cowgill 1979); peasant revolt (Hamblin and Pitcher 1980; Thompson 1966);failures in management (Willey and Shimkin 1973), trade (Rathje 1973; Webb1973), and subsistence (Culbert 1988; Turner 1974); yellow fever (Wilkinson1995); and diminishing subsistence returns (Tainter 1988). Recently, DavidWebster (2002 : 327 –328) has combined some of these explanations and arguesthat the collapse. . . was fundamentally triggered by three interrelated and dynamic factors, in the following order of importance: one, a worsening relationship of Mayapopulations to their agricultural and other resources; two, the destabilizingeffects of warfare and competition, and three, the rejection of the ideology and institution of kingship. These in turn created or exacerbated a series of184Water and Ritual07-T3558 12/20/05 4:45 PM Page 184"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"secondary stresses, including increased vulnerability to drought, peasantunrest, and disease.Increasingly, however, studies show that climate change occurred at the endof the Classic period, beginning in the late ad700s (e.g., Curtis and Hodell1993; Curtis et al. 1996; Dahlin 1983; Folan et al. 1983; Gill 2000; Gunn et al.1995; Haug et al. 2003; Hodell et al. 1995; Leyden et al. 1996; Messenger 1990).I have argued elsewhere that this may have set in motion several of the “causes”mentioned above or exacerbated existing local problems (Lucero 2002a), suchas environmental degradation (e.g., Copán area) and /or political competition(e.g., Petexbatún area).While local climate patterns varied, evidence indicates that long-term cli-mate change affected the entire Maya lowlands, especially the southern low-lands (Brenner et al. 2002). For example, based on current global climate pat-terns, Joel Gunn, William Folan, and Hubert Robichaux (1995) propose a modelin which periods of florescence in Maya history are related to periods whenthere was an optimal balance between wet and dry seasons. The Maya collapsetherefore occurred in a period when animbalanceexisted between wet and dryseasons that adversely impacted agricultural schedules. Pollen data from thelakes region in the Petén suggest that deforestation was already in place by theEarly Classic, which may further have added to the burden of unstable seasonalpatterns, not to mention a steadily increasing population (Deevey et al. 1979;Rice 1993, 1996). David Hodell, Jason Curtis, and Mark Brenner (1995; see alsoCurtis et al. 1996), using lake core date from Lake Chichancanab and PuntaLaguna in the Yucatán to assess temporal changes in oxygen isotopes and sed-iment composition, argue for an arid period beginning ca. ad750 and lastingthrough ca. ad1000, perhaps due to periodic episodes of increased solar activ-ity that occurred about every 200 years (Hodell et al. 2001).In a recent study in the Cariaco Basin of northern Venezuela, Gerald Haugand others (2003 : 1732) use results from measuring bulk sediment chemistry toexplore the relationship between rainfall and riverine detrital, one that is re-corded in “annually laminated sediments.” They argue that they have been ableto refine the time-line of Maya droughts. Their results show a gradual dryingtrend interspersed with short periods of intense drought at about ad760, 810,860, and 910. How do these dates correspond to events recorded in the south-ern Maya lowlands? The last-known inscriptions from nonriver centers datefrom ad810 to 869 (a 59-year time span), river centers from ad799 to 822 (a 23-year time span), and secondary centers from ad742 to 909 (a 167-year timespan). Not surprisingly, given their particular histories, secondary centers showthe longest time span. River centers, even if one includes Piedras Negras (lastdate: ad810) and Yaxchilán (last date: ad808) as regional centers, clusterThe Rise and Fall of Classic Maya Rulers18507-T3558 12/20/05 4:45 PM Page 185"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"within a relatively short time span, perhaps reflecting a greater reliance on theannual rising and subsiding of the river. Archaeological evidence, however, in-dicates that the majority of centers were abandoned by the ad900s.Richardson Gill (2000 : 325) also breaks down the last inscribed dates, but bydate and area: “Most of the 760 – 810 sites are grouped together in the west andsouthwest. The 811 – 860 sites are in the southeast and the 861 – 910 sites are con-centrated in the core and in the north.” When one looks closely at the distri-bution of sites and their last inscribed date, however, this relationship is not soobvious. I suspect that historical circumstances came into play more often thannot in regard to the last known dates at several centers (e.g., Seibal, Dos Pilas,Toniná, and Palenque).In a recent edited volume on the Terminal Classic in the Maya lowlands,Demarest and others (2004a) argue against any global, single cause such asdrought, especially since some centers were abandoned before evidence of a drought exists, which suggests that warfare led to the political collapse —not drought (though some climate specialists place the drought beginning at ca. ad750 – 760; Haug et al. 2003; Hodell et al. 1995). For example, Demarest(2004) shows that western centers in the Petexbatún and Pasión region weresome of the first centers to show clear evidence for loss of political power, whichhe argues was due to political competition and warfare, not drought. As a con-sequence, trade patterns were disrupted, particularly trade involving exotic andwealth items that were critical in definingk’ul ahawrulership. The effects ofthis disruption and the migration of people out of western kingdoms north,east, and elsewhere had major repercussions and eventually brought down otherpowerhouses. Demarest (2004) argues that population displacement resulted inthe over-use of resources in areas with recent immigrants; and Tourtellot andSabloff (2004) suggest that brigandry became a problem. There is no doubtthat the Petexbatún area witnessed conflict (e.g., evidence for defensive worksand violent death). Dos Pilas is a case in point; its last king, currently known asRuler 4, was defeated in ad761 by a ruler from Tamarandito (Demarest 1997,2004). Afterward, the Maya attempted to defend their capital by strippingtemples and palaces of stone façades and building walls around the epicenter ina failed attempt to keep their enemies at bay. Defensive works, violence, anddestruction are seen elsewhere in the region as well (e.g., Aguateca, Punto deChimino, and other centers).It is possible, however, that changing seasonal patterns set in motion a se-ries of events, including conflict over water, or exacerbated existing problemsthat eventually resulted in the demise of rulership. Thus it is not surprising thatthere was a “mosaic” pattern of political failure during the Terminal Classic(Demarest et al. 2004a). A crucial question that needs to be addressed, though,iswhythe political vacuum remained. As mentioned in Chapter 1, political186Water and Ritual07-T3558 12/20/05 4:45 PM Page 186"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"fragmentation or replacement is the norm in the aftermath of political collapse;the utter and complete disappearance of political systems is rare. Long-termclimate change, such as increasing drought in the form of shorter rainy seasons,explains why rulership did not emerge again in the southern Maya lowlands.Another fact worth noting is that the most powerful kings at regional centers,river and nonriver, lasted 40 to 100 years after the capture of Ruler 4 at Dos Pi-las in ad761; warfare and disrupted trade had no impact on these centers. Fi-nally, the reasons why warfare was so widespread in the Petexbatún need to beaddressed; O’Mansky and Dunning (2004) find no obvious evidence for envi-ronmental degradation; nor is there evidence for declining health (Wright 1997).If material conditions were changing, however — such as decreasing annualrainfall or a change in the timing of the rainy season enough to interfere withsurplus production— that could have been just the catalyst to set in motioncompetition over water rights. People fought over water, but victory was short-lived since water supplies were inadequate to support anything of a royal na-ture. Prudence Rice and others (2004 : 10) state that the evidence “largely arguesagainst the concept of a uniform, chronologically aligned collapse or catastro-phe in all regions of the lowlands or even a uniform ‘decline’ in population ofpolitical institutions.” I agree that it is neither uniform nor catastrophic in thesense that only kings vanished, not people, and that they disappeared at differ-ent times.Decreasing rainfall undermined the institution of rulership when existingceremonies and water systems failed to provide sufficient water. Even a slightdecrease in annual rainfall could have a dramatic impact on water levels, asBrian Fagan (2004) shows in cases throughout the globe. Farmers blamed de-creasing food and water on kings, who had previously claimed a close intimacywith supernatural powers associated with rain, crops, and fertility. Lesseningrainfall and its probable effects, such as increased disease and decreasing health,set in motion the erosion of political power, as Webster has noted (2002 : 327 –328). As a result, the foundation of political power dissipated, with the finaloutcome of farmers emigrating from the interior or permanently living in hin-terland areas; there might also have been some population loss due to decreas-ing health and fertility (Culbert 1977, 1988; Lowe 1985 : 62; Santley et al. 1986;Willey and Shimkin 1973). Maya kings could not reach and politically integratefarmers who permanently dispersed into hinterland areas (e.g., hinterland Co-pán; Freter 1994; Webster and Gonlin 1988) or migrated to the Yucatán, south-eastern Petén, east to Belize, or west and south to the highlands (e.g., Culbert1977; Laporte 2004; Lowe 1985 : 208; McAnany et al. 2004; Mock 2004; Santleyet al. 1986; Willey and Shimkin 1973).Drier conditions particularly affected areas lacking rivers and lakes and thosein higher elevations with relatively low annual rainfall (see Figure 4.1). MinorThe Rise and Fall of Classic Maya Rulers18707-T3558 12/20/05 4:45 PM Page 187"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"and secondary centers show a gradual trend from lower to higher elevations andless so for annual rainfall, whereas regional centers represent the extremes inrainfall (the highest or lowest annual amounts, but typically the lowest) and el-evation (highest). These patterns indicate that rainfall and elevation both influ-enced agricultural regimes (e.g., different temperatures) (see Akin 1991 : 47).Kings’ loss of power at regional centers had various impacts on smaller cen-ters. Some secondary rulers began to build monuments on their own, indepen-dent of their previous overlords (Marcus 1976; Pohl and Pohl 1994); rulers notheavily dependent on water systems survived the drought, at least for a brieftime. In addition, political fallout for secondary kings varied and was related totheir level of involvement with regional rulers. The Maya at minor centerswithout water systems continued performing daily activities, largely unaffectedby what was happening elsewhere.Nonriver CentersIn areas without lakes or rivers, artificial reservoirs no longer adequately ful-filled daily water needs. As a result, commoners stopped congregating at cen-ter reservoirs and paying to get in. Eventually, Tikal’s core was largely aban-doned in the 900s, as was Calakmul’s (Marcus 1998; Pinceman et al. 1998).Calakmul’s abandonment was associated not only with drought but possiblywith incursions from the Putún Maya from the Gulf Coast of Tabasco, Mex-ico, taking advantage of a weakened rulership. After ca. ad790 Caracol wasstill occupied by “elite” Maya until ca. ad895 (A. Chase and D. Chase 2004).Caracol’s epicenter was abruptly abandoned by ca.ad890 and burned, though aremnant population remained another 200 years or so (A. Chase and D. Chase1996, 2001; D. Chase and A. Chase 2000). Exacerbating rulers’ problems wasthe lack of stored goods that could have been used to allay famine and garnercontinued support for rulership.River CentersConcentrated alluvium clearly was not enough to prevent many farmers of Co-pán and Palenque from abandoning their kings to search for better areas to live.As was the case with similarly organized archaic states elsewhere, over-use ofresources also contributed to problems caused by drought. There are indica-tions that decreasing subsistence resources played a role in the disintegration ofpower, as indicated at Copán, where leaders were faced not only with deplet-ing resources (Davis-Salazar 2003; Fash 1991 : 170 – 183; Paine and Freter 1996;Webster 1999; Wingard 1996) but also with competition between elite and royallineages (Fash 1998; Fash et al. 2004; Fash and Stuart 1991; Freter 1994). These188Water and Ritual07-T3558 12/20/05 4:45 PM Page 188"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"factors might explain why their last inscribed date (ad822) is noticeably earlierthan Tikal’s (ad869) and Caracol’s (ad859). Stelae were no longer carved inthese times of trouble; instead, inscriptions were carved and painted on por-table items (Fash 1998), similar to the Late Preclassic period. Another factor affecting Copán more than other river centers was similar to the situation atnonriver regional centers: changing rainfall patterns. Copán’s annual rainfall issignificantly less than at most other major centers, just over 130 cm, indicatingthat reservoirs probably dried up as well. Copán’s hinterland population, how-ever, while decreasing in number, did not completely abandon the region (Web-ster 2002 : 310).While annual rainfall at Palenque is over 360 cm (one of the highest), kingsstill lost power when changing conditions exacerbated internal political insta-bility as a result of their defeat twice in the 700s at the hands of rulers fromToniná, a secondary center 65 km to the south (Martin and Grube 2000 : 172 –174, 182). These losses may also explain why Palenque had one of the earliestlast-known inscribed dates in the southern lowlands (ad799), much earlierthan Toniná, which has the latest last-known inscribed date in the southernMaya lowlands (ad909). And even if kings provided drinking water, rainfall-dependent farming practices in surrounding areas did not produce enoughfood, storage or not.Secondary CentersThe disruption in the royal interaction sphere variously affected secondary cen-ters but eventually resulted in the disappearance of royal hallmarks, includingmonumental architecture, inscriptions, and royal iconography. Small-scale wa-ter/agricultural systems and scattered resources did not provide kings with thesame means to acquire political power as at regional centers. As a result of in-creasing drought, Maya kings lost what power they had. At centers with higherannual rainfall and small-scale water/agricultural systems, the disruption feltelsewhere did not automatically result in dramatic change; instead restructur-ing may have taken place, and in some cases a florescence.Lamanai’s location on a lagoon with fertile land coupled with trade with theYucatán Maya provided its inhabitants with the means to outlast the politicaldisintegration through the seventeenth century (Loten 1985; Pendergast 1986);kings, though, did not survive. Lamanai’s inhabitants also benefited from run-off, as one of the eastern-most major centers in the southern Maya lowlands.The Maya continued to live for a time at Quiriguá, perhaps due to “its appar-ent isolation, its self sufficiency within the rich lower Motagua Valley, and acontinued control over the lucrative highland-Caribbean trade route” (Sharer1978 : 69). Kings of Seibal and Xunantunich witnessed a brief florescence.

For ex-ample, the last-known dated inscriptions at Xunantunich date to ad849 and atSeibal to ad889, some of the latest. Altar de Sacrificios, with its last inscribeddate of ad849, was abandoned for a short time in the early ad900s (Mathewsand Willey 1991); was briefly reoccupied, perhaps by a different Maya or foreigngroup ca. A.D. 909 – 948; and was abandoned for good after ad950 (Adams1973; Smith 1972 : 6).Even though Dos Pilas is in a resource-rich zone, historic circumstances(specifically, its location in a region with several competing kingdoms) resultedin its eventual abandonment after Ruler 4 was defeated in ad761 by a neigh-boring king from Tamarandito (Demarest 1997). Recent paleoecological re-search on landscape changes conducted by Kevin Johnston, Andrew Brecken-ridge, and Barbara Hansen (2001), however, indicates that Laguna Las Pozasin the Pasión drainage of Guatemala was occupied in the Early Postclassic (ca.ad900 – 1200), after nearby centers including Dos Pilas and Aguateca wereabandoned (see also Palka 1997).Classic political life eventually ceased at most secondary river centers due tothe disruption in the royal interaction sphere and decreasing surplus.Minor CentersIn areas with plentiful land and water where farmers did not rely on water sys-tems or kings, the drought’s impact was different than elsewhere. Of course theMaya, as members of a larger society, knew of events taking place in otherplaces. On a day-to-day basis, however, not much necessarily changed. TheMaya who lived at minor centers were the least affected by the dramatic eventstaking place at larger, more politically integrated centers. For example, theMaya who lived at Saturday Creek until at least ad1500 (Conlon and Ehret2002) did not have to face failing water/agricultural systems. A similar scenariotook place at Barton Ramie, which was also occupied into the Postclassic untilat least ca. ad1200 and likely longer (Willey et al. 1965). Their location alonga major river with runoff from the west and plentiful alluvium provided themeans to weather changing climate and to continue with community life.1Lo-cal elites indeed had less access to exotic goods, since the interaction sphere wasdisrupted, but they soon obtained long-distance wares through different routes,particularly sea trade from the north and east. Political shifts occurring else-where in the southern Maya lowlands had little impact on a community thatwas not much involved in Classic Maya politics to begin with.190Water and Ritual07-T3558 12/20/05 4:45 PM Page 190"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Summary RemarksHaving access to wealth or capital and critical resources in conjunction with theuse of integrative strategies such as ceremonies provided a powerful centripetalpolitical tool for Maya rulers. Climatic changes had a major impact on centerslacking permanent or adequate water sources in higher elevations with rela-tively low rainfall, where water systems and ritual were vital to political life. Asdrier conditions became more common, water and agricultural systems andcrops failed, as did ceremonies that previously had resulted in bountiful rainand food. Combined with increasing soil depletion and deforestation, thesefactors resulted in the migration and dispersal of Maya farmers who once nu-cleated around centers. In the end, people blamed kings for all the mishaps oc-curring as a result of climate change.The majority of Maya did not disappear or die off after the political collapse;they only permanently left the fold of the royal tribute system, since rulers nolonger provided them with a strong inducement to remain. Postcollapse reor-ganization in the interior is thus best understood as a process unfolding at thecommunity level. In the southern Maya lowlands after the Terminal Classic,former subjects no longer had to supply tribute to a ruling class; they only hadto work for their families and the community to which they belonged, includ-ing local elites. After rulers lost power, farmers and elites continued to conducttraditional rites where they began, in the home and community, as TerminalClassic (ca. ad850 – 950) and Early Postclassic (ca. ad950 – 1200) residentialdeposits throughout the Maya lowlands illustrate (e.g., D. Chase and A. Chase2004; Lucero 2003).The AftermathWhat happened to former royal subjects? Some or even many farmers remainedin the southern Maya lowlands. At first glance it may seem that there was mas-sive population loss during and after the collapse. But increasing evidence fromhinterland studies suggests that what might have happened instead was bothmigration out of these areasanda reversion to nonplatform houses constructedof thatch and /or wattle-and-daub, resulting in the “invisible” mounds of the ar-chaeological record (e.g., Johnston 2004a, 2004b; Rice 1996; Webster 2002 :215). The collapse of Classic Maya political systems resulted in people organiz-ing at the community level in some areas, especially near permanent watersources (e.g., Johnston et al. 2001; Masson 1997; Masson and Mock 2004). Forexample, the Maya inhabited the Petén Itzá lakes region until the conquest(Rice 1996; Rice and Rice 2004).

Juan AntonioLaporte (2004) has noted a noticeable increase in population in the southeast-ern Petén, beginning in the Terminal Classic and decreasing somewhat in thePostclassic. McAnany and others (2004) note the same for the Sibun Valley ineast-central Belize.Another hallmark often used as a gauge of the abandonment of the south-ern lowlands is the noticeable decrease in ceramics. It is possible that the Mayabegan using more decorated gourds rather than ceramics (Hayden 1994), as do several Postclassic and modern Maya groups (e.g., Bunzel 1952 : 42; Haydenand Cannon 1984 : 172; Redfield and Villa Rojas 1934 : 75, 128; Tozzer 1907 : 122,1941 : 90; Vogt 1970 : 54). Prudence Rice and Donald Forsyth (2004) also notethat polychrome ceramics decrease in number and vessels become smaller andsimpler in design and form. The lack of polychromes would make distinguish-ing plain vessels from different periods difficult. In sum, different building pat-terns and the increasing use of perishable goods and monochrome or unslippedceramics all would have left less telling evidence in the archaeological record,which would appear to represent population loss and migration rather thanpopulation dispersal and migration.Some of the Maya who migrated went north, attracted by a new religion re-volving around Kukulcan and trade centered at Chichén Itzá;2others headedto Belize and to the highlands of Chiapas. Coastal areas provided marine re-sources, and shallow lakes the means for wetland agriculture — two types of re-sources less dependent upon rainfall. For the Yucatán, archaeologists have pro-posed an outmigration at the end of the Late Preclassic due to drier climate andlater due to flooding salt pans (Santley et al. 1986); the area was not to see in-creased settlement until later in the Classic period at centers such as ChichénItzá and Dzibilchaltún (Cobos 2004), when both climate change and loweringsea levels provided inducements to return. The Puuc area witnessed a peak inpopulation in the Terminal Classic (Carmean et al. 2004). Other areas of theYucatán peninsula, such as the southern areas of Quintana Roo, incorporatedthe use of canals to support the growing immigrant populations. As mentionedearlier, the Maya may have been attracted to the northern lowlands not onlydue to better economic opportunities but also because of a new religion cen-tered on Kukulcan, the feathered serpent, as well as traditional Maya deities.They may have looked to new gods, since some of the traditional ones failedthem, especially those associated with Classic Maya rulership (e.g., K’awil),which largely disappeared in Postclassic rites and iconography. In parts of the northern lowlands that experienced a florescence from ca. ad750 to 1000(Demarest et al. 2004a), however, the Maya still continued performing tradi-tional rites, a practice which has persisted to the present.192Water and Ritual07-T3558 12/20/05 4:45 PM Page 192"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"To conclude, southern lowland Maya kings were around for nearly a mil-lennium, a testament to their skills in integrating people. Their history, as theywrote it themselves, involved almost daily supplications to gods and ancestors,especially royal ones. It also records battles, the sacrifice of vanquished and cap-tured rulers, accession rites, marriage alliances, bloodletting, and several otherroyal events and rites. What it does not mention is the nonreligious and non-ritual means of power. I have attempted to fill this gap. The following sectionpresents a possible scenario of how Maya kings acquired political power, as wellas how they eventually lost it.A Scenario: The Ancient MayaIn the Middle Preclassic period the Maya began more and more to move awayfrom coasts, rivers, and lakes into interior areas with plentiful land that may ormay not have had permanent water sources. First settlers or founders were alsofirst served; the implications of this were not obvious until increasingly morepeople moved into these areas. Everyone conducted rituals in the home, whichcame from a long-standing tradition.In the Late Preclassic first founders started to distinguish themselves fromothers by building larger houses and small public temples and acquiring exotics.Elites continued to practice the same rites as everyone else but began to usemore expensive items as offerings — they could afford to relinquish them for-ever. They compensated laborers with food, exotics, and /or access to resources.Elites had to pay their workers well, since the latter could choose to work forother families who could afford to pay. To show their gratitude, patrons spon-sored traditional rites and feasts for workers and their families and invited theentire community to attend and participate. Such events offered a break fromwork and a time to socialize, not to mention the opportunity to increase theprestige of elites in the eyes of farmers and to compete with other elites forprestige and labor.This scenario was repeated again and again throughout the southern Mayalowlands. Why did the Maya no longer have a choice but to acquiesce to trib-ute demands instituted by rulers? Why and how did Maya elites transform intorulers? What circumstances, which should come as no surprise at this point, al-lowed rulers to emerge in some areas but not in others?Even ifbajoshad once been wetlands or lakes, by the beginning of the Clas-sic period they had transformed into seasonal swamps. In areas without surfacewater, initiallyaguadasprovided enough water for the earliest settlers. Later,especially beginning in the Early Classic, large artificial reservoirs became crit-ical; quarrying provided the construction materials to build temples and palacesThe Rise and Fall of Classic Maya Rulers19307-T3558 12/20/05 4:45 PM Page 193"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"next to reservoirs. Along or near rivers in Mexico, Guatemala, and westernHonduras, growing numbers of people still needed access to potable water, es-pecially at the height of the dry season, when rivers were low, murky, and dis-ease-ridden. Rulers, when necessary, provided capital to repair water or agri-cultural systems damaged during the rainy season. Providers did not performthese services for free. Maya leaders, who emerged from wealthy founding lin-eages, realized that they could demand payment above and beyond equal com-pensation. Maya rulers could not demand too much from farmers because theycould flee into the jungle or to other realms. Consequently, the average Mayawas not powerless but had some leverage.Areas with noticeable seasonal issues or problems provided the ideal cir-cumstances for rulers to emerge. Many farmers relied on reservoirs — and onthe rulers who built them and who lived and worshiped next to them. Andwhen the rainy season began each year, it was clearly due to successful suppli-cation of gods and ancestors by everyone, especially kings. Thirsty farmers thushad a stake in constructing and maintaining increasingly larger and sophisti-cated reservoirs. The continually growing numbers of farmers attracted to fer-tile areas were incorporated into the political system because of their need forwater and because of a ruler’s ability to secure enough water for everyone throughsupernatural connections.Consequently, the most powerful kings arose in areas where people reliedthe most on large-scale water/agricultural systems — as well as on the plenti-ful agricultural land that yielded enough food to maintain royals and their sub-jects. Rulers used their wealth to maintain reservoirs and agricultural systemsthroughout the year. In areas without rulers (for example, along the BelizeRiver), the availability of ample land and water (even in the dry season, due torunoff from Guatemala and Mexico) prevented elites from attracting lots ofpeople and exacting tribute. Elites, however, sponsored community-wide cer-emonies to offset potential conflict in the face of wealth differences. Kings atsecondary centers could have built large-scale water/agricultural systems as wellif their agricultural land had not been dispersed in relatively small pockets.These lands could not support large enough numbers of people to maintain aprimary royal lifestyle, which they were able to witness on their visits to re-gional centers as subordinates or independent secondary kings. Further, whensmall-scale agricultural and /or water systems were damaged by heavy rainfall,farmers and communities repaired them without royal assistance.Rulers realized that since most people lived dispersed throughout the hin-terlands, they could choose to whom and at which center they contributed sur-plus goods and labor in exchange for access to water and capital. Consequently,political aspirants needed to fulfill more than just material needs. They re-sponded through replicating and expanding traditional rites in plazas facing194Water and Ritual07-T3558 12/20/05 4:45 PM Page 194"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"large temples and ball courts. The strategy of “bread and circuses” was not usedonly by Roman emperors. The rulers’ success as landowners and providers ofwater and capital demonstrated to on-the-fence farmers that their special tiesto gods and ancestors benefited them all. And since farmers had to pay anyway,why not pay successful aspirants? Why not contribute surplus goods and laborto kings who sponsored impressive ceremonies and feasts? Why not pay hom-age to rulers who captured and sacrificed fellow kings? Those who were un-willing to pay could flee to marginal areas that yielded little surplus and werethus of no interest to rulers.Political domains expanded throughout the Late Classic, when Maya kingsreached their apogee of power. And the system worked for nearly a millennium.But all things come to an end. The more Maya rulers depended on large-scalewater systems to support their royal lifestyle, the more vulnerable they were tochanging rainfall patterns. While political systems were somewhat fluid andflexible, one aspect of the subsistence system was not: their rainfall dependencyand reliance on water/agricultural systems. Rituals no longer worked in the faceof changing material conditions — namely, a long-term drought. Kings failedin their supplications to supernatural entities. Close ties to the otherworldbrought both benefits and risks. When water was plentiful, rulers benefited;when it was not, rulers lost their edge — and power. They no longer paid intoa system that did not work. Commoners either made their way out of centersinto hinterland areas or left the region altogether in search of wetter pastures.The Rise and Fall of Classic Maya Rulers19507-T3558 12/20/05 4:45 PM Page 195"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":". . . since Fortune changes and men stand fixed in their old ways, they are prosperousso long as there is congruity between them, and the reverse when there is not.machiavelli (1994 [1514] : 82)In Chapter 1, I have presented a scenario on the emergence of rulers. My goalthroughout this book has been to address a key question—how do a few peopleget others to contribute labor and goods without compensating them equally?To appreciate how political leaders emerge, it is first critical to understand — inaddition to social and historical circumstances — material issues, namely, theamount and distribution of agricultural land, seasonal water issues, and wherepeople live and work across the landscape. Together they influence the amountof available surplus in any given area. Uniting political power and the materialworld is ritual. As long as there is a balance among these features, all is well (po-litically anyway). When conditions change, so do political fortunes, for betteror worse. And as I have attempted to demonstrate in this work, these processesoccur cross-culturally. Surplus and ritual both are vital for political survival.The replication and the expansion of familiar traditional rites allow rulers tobring people together to demonstrate their abilities in propitiating and com-municating with ancestors and gods. The ultimate practical goal is to provideprotection and capital, water, and food when necessary in exchange for surpluslabor and goods. Subjects thus benefit materially (e.g., Service 1975 : 8); rulers’ability to fulfill material obligations only highlights their closer ties to super-natural entities. People also have options; they can contribute to another leaderor in some cases leave political realms altogether and live in marginal areas un-suitable for surplus extraction. People participate in redefining their rights andobligationsbecauserulers demonstrate their success in the material and spiritualrealms.The fact that rituals alone do not support political leaders goes a long wayCHAPTER 8Water, Ritual, and Politics in Ancient Complex Societies08-T3558 12/20/05 4:45 PM Page 196"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"in explaining the different types of political systems as well as demonstratingthe relatively limited number of responses to varied material and social condi-tions. Community organizations have several leaders (e.g., lineage heads, vil-lage chiefs, or elite Maya lineage heads) who cannot demand tribute but whouse their wealth to distinguish themselves materially and to sponsor local inte-grative events. Farmers are extensive and /or intensive agriculturalists who rely onseasonal rainfall but do not rely on water/agricultural systems. Consequently,people are better able to deal with changing conditions and thus have long andrelatively stable histories. Further, plentiful resources available year-round arenot conducive to expanding the political economy. Household and public ritestake place to honor ancestors, not the living.The main differences between community organizations and local politiesare that the latter include denser settlements, a greater reliance on water/agri-cultural systems, and the presence of one major institutionalized leader (e.g., aparamount chief or secondary Maya king). Political leaders acquire surplus la-bor and goods from people in return for what they provide in services — cen-tripetal events such as feasts and ceremonies (e.g., Maya kings) and /or foodduring famine or capital to repair small-scale water/agricultural systems dam-aged during the rainy season (e.g., Hawaiian paramount chiefs). Political poweroften is linked to external ties (e.g., trade, esoteric information, and the elite /royal interaction sphere), whose duration is quite varied, while the subsistenceeconomy largely is stable. In cases where external ties are not as significant (e.g.,Hawaii), other factors (e.g., island setting and population size) can limit extentand affect duration. The greater importance of leaders in the lives of all is ex-pressed in public rites that include thanking chiefly or royal ancestors. Peopleperform rites in the home to honor their own ancestors.The height of political power is achieved in centralized polities, where thereis little doubt that royal intercession with supernatural entities is critical, be-cause densely settled people rely on seasonal rainfall, intensive agriculture, and /or large-scale water or agricultural systems (e.g., Maya river regional centers,Egypt, and Mesopotamian city-states). Royal success — for example, in ensur-ing adequate river flooding for agriculture (e.g., Egypt and China) — is pub-licized in large-scale ceremonies with roots in traditional rites. Everyone worships ancestors and gods in the home and community as well. As long assurplus is stable, so are political systems (though the political system maychange hands, as it did several times in Egypt). In integrative polities, the pri-mary ruler has a similar role. The distinguishing feature is that key resourcesand settlement are more dispersed, which adds an additional challenge for rul-ers to reach people, not to mention their surplus (e.g., Maya nonriver regionalcenters and precolonial Balinese kingdoms). Rulers reach people, and their surplus, through sponsoring frequent ceremonies, feasts, and other integrativeWater, Ritual, and Politics19708-T3558 12/20/05 4:45 PM Page 197"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"events and displays. Kings also play a large role in providing water throughfunding the building of large reservoirs and performing water rites. Seasonalfluctuations are always a concern in centralized and integrative polities, so long-term seasonal changes can and do bring down royal dynasties temporarily (e.g.,precolonial Bali and Egypt) or permanently (e.g., southern Maya lowlands andsouthern Mesopotamia).Another crucial issue that I have attempted to address is the types of changesthat can cause rulers to lose their right to exact tribute. Seasonal vagaries arechallenges enough to deal with — providing water during annual drought, allo-cating water, repairing water/agricultural systems damaged by flooding, andsupplying food in times of scarcity. Climate change lasting more than a few sea-sons is another matter entirely. InFloods, Famines, and Emperors: El Niño andthe Fate of Civilizations,Brian Fagan (1999) details how climate change has af-fected political histories throughout the world. For example, in the Moche casein Peru (pp. 119 – 138), he notes that an inflexible government and subsistencetechnology (“elaborate irrigations systems”; p. 138) lessened farmers’ ability tosurvive long-term droughts and torrential rains and destructive floods causedby El Niño events. A series of several El Niño events damaged the large-scaleirrigation systems repeatedly in the late ad600s, eventually resulting in the de-mise of Moche political power. He presents several other instances where cli-mate change had a dramatic impact on social, political, and economic institu-tions (e.g., Egypt and Europe and the “Little Ice Age”). While he does notdiscuss ritual, it is obvious that royal ceremonies failed. Fagan concludes hisbook by highlighting recent instances where the lack of foresight and articula-tion of institutions, resources, and changing rainfall patterns have had devas-tating results, as witnessed at present in parched east Africa.Crumley (see Chapter 1) provides a more in-depth account of one particu-lar area, western Europe, showing how certain climate regimes suited Romanexpansion; centuries of success resulted in tried-and-true subsistence and po-litical institutions that eventually were unable to cope with long-term climatechange. Fagan (2004) further details the effects of climate change on societiesinThe Long Summer: How Climate Changed Civilization.In this work, he high-lights how short-term or immediate responses (e.g., spending more resourcesto propitiate the gods) to changing climate can make societies more vulnerablein the long run— a lesson we are increasingly learning at present.The point is that not being able to respond efficiently to climate changeeventually can have drastic and unforeseen consequences, especially in situa-tions where political and subsistence systems are not flexible enough to adjustto changing conditions. Short-term responses — including, for example, theelaboration of rituals in a last-ditch effort to appease the gods or using up storesof food and grain without taking into consideration future needs such as con-198Water and Ritual08-T3558 12/20/05 4:45 PM Page 198"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"tinuing famine and the need of seeds for planting —have long-lasting impacts,not usually beneficial (e.g., Hosler et al. 1977). More often than not, the re-sponse was to reorganize or adapt. The Roman Empire, for example, brokeapart; “emperors” began relying on new rituals and gods, since the old ones hadfailed them. Many of the traditional Roman deities concerned crops and fer-tility (e.g., Juno and Diana), “weather and elements,” and war (Minerva andJupiter) (Crumley 2001). Roman emperors were closely tied to ritual and cere-mony involving these deities, as was everyone else. Climate change changed allthis and. . . challenged sacred imperial authority. To account for widespread economicfailures, Roman emperors were forced to reinterpret traditional religion or to embrace the mystical religious traditions of the eastern Mediterranean.Beginning with Aurelian (ad215 – 275), who imported Persian worship of theUnconquered Sun, the search culminated with Constantine’s (ad285 –337)conversion to Christianity. (Crumley 2001 : 31)If responses are inadequate, people are more susceptible to foreign inva-sions, for example, or at least a new regime. Political institutions can also frag-ment into their constituent autonomous parts and later regenerate (e.g., Egypt,China, and Mesopotamia) (Cowgill 1988). Rarely does everyone abandon anarea altogether;1people leave the only life they know when they have no otherchoice. If people previously have been willing to contribute to political coffersrather than leave, whatever makes them abandon their rulers, homes, and landmust be extreme.In the Maya area, kings rose and fell in areas with plentiful farming land andnoticeable seasonal vagaries. Replicating and expanding traditional ritualsbrought people together and provided the arena for rulers to show off their var-ious powers. Audience members had a say in their success, because kings knewthat people could choose to whom to gift their tribute. In some cases farmersleft kingdoms and settled in marginal areas where surplus was inadequate forpolitical purposes. In many cases, however, this option was not available be-cause of farmers’ need for capital, water, or food in times of need. The averageMaya commoner in the Classic period thus had little choice but to acquiesce totribute demands but likely could choose which ruler to pay, as reflected in theprevalent and public monumental architecture that served as a backdrop forrulers to attract and entertain supporters and collect tribute.The Maya political system worked for nearly a millennium, an amazing feat.It would take something drastic to bring it down. And something drastic in-deed happened. Long-term climate change played a large part in bringing anend to Classic Mayaroyallife.

Rituals that once highlightedtheir successes now only emphasized their failures, since they could not bringforth enough water for daily needs and agricultural fields. Commoners re-sponded by abandoning rulers and centers. Some permanently remained in thehinterlands or noncenter areas, where they could subsist in small family groupsand communities; others fled the southern lowlands in all four directions. Thesituation was extreme enough to prevent the replacement of Maya kingshipwith a comparable political system.The Maya reoccupied some centers, but in small numbers. And none oftheir members became kings. Rulers were gone forever in the southern Mayalowlands, not to mention much of their “great tradition” (the northern Mayalowlands are another story). Elites and commoners remained and continued toperform the daily social, religious, and economic tasks that they had always per-formed before and during the time of rulership.Concluding RemarksThe goal of this book has been to explain the emergence and demise of politi-cal leadership in terms of the same two factors — water and ritual. While thesetopics are often discussed on their own, there can be little doubt that they areinextricably and dialectically linked. It is their articulation that plays a key rolein the creation and dissolution of political power. Plentiful rain at the righttime, which results in bountiful crops that feed everyone, is the direct result ofkings’ successful propitiation of gods and ancestors through traditional ritualswrit large. Water and surplus sustain the body and rituals; rituals sustain themind and spirit. Water and surplus provide the means to fund political systems,and rituals the arena to promote solidarity and political agendas. Participantsor audience members have a voice in who becomes a leader and who does not.People also express disapproval when rulers fail in providing material necessi-ties and vote with their feet and pocketbooks. Rulers cannot curtail the loss oftribute-payers in the face of their rituals failing.Simply stated, water and ritual are crucial in the development and demise ofpolitical power.200Water and Ritual08-T3558 12/20/05 4:45 PM Page 200"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Chapter 11.
