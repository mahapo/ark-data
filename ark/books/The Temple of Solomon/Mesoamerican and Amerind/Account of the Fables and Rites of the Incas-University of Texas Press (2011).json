Th e only remaining copy is held in the National Library in Madrid (Manu-script 3169, fols. 2–36). Th e document is not dated, but the hand-writing appears to be from the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century (Porras Barrenechea 1986: 353). It is the fi rst of six critically important early colonial works on the Incas that have been bound together with vellum into a single volume (Duviols and Itier 1993: 15). Th is collection comes from the personal library of Francisco de Ávila (ca. 1573–1647), a Jesuit who led a series of brutal anti-idolatry campaigns in the Andes a generation aft er Molina. Ávila was also a great collector of books and manuscripts, accruing what then was the largest library in Peru (Salomon 2008; Hampe Martínez 1996). Th e other documents included in the volume are: Joan de Santa Cruz Pachacuti Yamqui Salcamaygua’s Relación de antigüedades deste reyno del Pirú (ca. 1613), Polo de Ondegardo’s Traslado de un carta-pacio a manera de borrador (ca. 1572), Francisco de Ávila’s Tratado y relación de los errores, falsos dioses y otras supersticiones (ca. 1608), the anonymous Huarochirí Manuscript (ca. 1608), as well as a summary of Garcilaso de la Vega’s Comentarios reales de los incas (1609). Th is famous collection of documents was fi rst identifi ed by Pascual de Gayangos, who sent a copy to Clements R . Markham (1873: vii). Although we have tried to remain true to Molina throughout this translation, we have made some changes to make his document more accessible to a wide readership. For example, we have divided Translators’ NotesPreface"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"viii ] Account of the Fables and Rites of the incasmany of his excessively long sentences into shorter, more compre-hensible lengths, and we have added punctuation where it lends clarity to the text. We have also followed English rules of capital-ization; spelled out abbreviations included in the manuscript; and added chapter breaks, chapter titles, and subheads that are not pres-ent in the original. In some sentences, we have made minor gram-matical changes such as correcting tenses and plurals. Furthermore, we have simplifi ed some of the repetitive phrases Molina uses; for example, “el dicho” (the said) is generally translated as “that.” In far fewer places, we have added a word or two or a proper name to rectify an ambiguous sentence or to clarify confusing pronouns. Th e added words are marked with square brackets. Finally, we have also simplifi ed some of his sentences by adding commas to separate items in a series and reducing the number of articles. Some information was noted in the margins of the manuscript. Th e paragraph breaks were marked with a “v,” and various lines of text that contain blank spaces were marked with an “o.” Th ese mark-ings have not been reproduced in this translation. However, the other annotative information included in the margins of the docu-ment is provided in the footnotes of this translation.1 Finally, in a few places, words were crossed out and replaced with corrections, and in other passages one or two words were erroneously copied twice. We have reproduced these elements of the text within our translation.Quechua WordsMolina’s frequent use of Quechua words and his inclusion of nu-merous Quechua prayers off er great challenges to any publication of his work. Th e fact that the original document has been lost, and the oldest remaining example of the document is a copy, adds com-plexities to understanding the Quechua words included within the text. Additional diffi culties are introduced when the same Quechua words are spelled in diff erent ways within the manuscript.2 As our English translation is intended for a general readership, we have"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"translators’ notes [ ixstandardized the most common toponyms and the names of Inca lords to match the generalized Hispanic spelling as found in other Spanish chronicles and on modern maps. For example, we use Ca-jamarca not Caxamarca, Huanacauri not Guanacauri or Yanacauri, Vilcabamba not Uiscabamba, Haucaypata not Aucaypata, Inca not Inga, and Manco Capac not Mango Capac.3 We have, however, fol-lowed Molina’s spelling for the more obscure terms, places, and names, and we have not att empted to edit his Quechua prayers. Initially we made our own transcriptions of Molina’s Quechua words based on our readings of the Madrid document. We were, however, uneasy with the results of our work, since we are not lin-guists nor are we Quechua speakers. Fortunately, as we entered into the fi nal stages of our translation work, Julio Calvo Pérez and Henrique Urbano (2008) published a comprehensive paleographic edition of Molina’s document. Respecting their fi ne scholarship, we defer in most cases to their paleographic reading of the document. Aft er much debate, we have also decided to provide a transla-tion of most Quechua words when they appear in the text. Again, we were hesitant to do this because of our limited Quechua skills, but in the end we believe that in-text translations will help general readers bett er understand the document. However, to avoid clut-ter, we translate frequently used words, such as ayllo [kin group], chicha [an alcoholic drink made from maize], huaca [shrine], miti-mas [colonists], mullu [Spondylus shells], taqui [dance], tarpuntaes [priests of the Sun], only on their fi rst use. A general glossary is also provided to help readers understand the many Quechua terms and the wide range of spellings found in the manuscript. Readers who are interested in learning more about the use of Quechua in Mo-lina’s work should see Calvo Pérez and Urbano (2008) and other earlier editions of the document."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"x AcknowledgmentsWe thank the Offi ce of the Dean (College of Liberal Arts and Sciences) as well as the Department of Anthropol-ogy at the University of Illinois at Chicago for providing fi nancial support for this work.

Writt en around 1575 at the re-quest of the third bishop of Cuzco, Sebastián de Lartaún, the report describes various rituals that were conducted in Cuzco during the last years of the Inca Empire. Molina was a priest of the Hospital for the Natives of Our Lady of Succor in Cuzco and he served for nearly twenty years as the preacher general (predicador general) of the city. Molina was also an outstanding Quechua speaker, and his advanced language skills allowed him to record both the prayers and the reli-gious celebrations of the Incas in unprecedented detail. Molina’s account was writt en during a period of growing Span-ish domination and accelerated violence against the so-called idola-trous religions of the Andean peoples. Soon aft er the Spaniards took control of the imperial city of Cuzco (1534), they began to discour-age the ritual activities of the Incas. Over the next several decades, as the Europeans gradually increased their power in the Andes, they pressured the indigenous peoples to stop practicing their re-ligious activities. Polo de Ondegardo (1916: 31) indicates that only a few vestiges of the most important Inca celebrations remained in the city during his fi rst term as chief magistrate (1558–1560), and many of those were being practiced in secret. By the mid-1570s, in-digenous ceremonies had all but disappeared in the former capital. Within this context of rapidly changing cultural practices, Molina’s Account of the Fables and Rites of the Incas is exceptionally important. Brian S. Bauer"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"introduction [ xvIt is based on the testimonies of the older indigenous men of Cuzco who were among the last surviving eyewitnesses of the rituals con-ducted at the height of Inca rule. Molina begins his work, aft er a brief introduction, by recording various Andean myths. Th ese are followed by short discussions of quipus, the knott ed recording devices of the Incas, and the early life of Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui, the ninth ruler of Cuzco. Information is also provided on the major gods and shrines (huacas) of the Incas, as well as on diff erent classes of sorcerers, healers, and fortune-tellers. He then discusses the major rituals that occurred in Cuzco dur-ing each month of the year. Th ese accounts are perhaps the great-est of Molina’s contributions, as he off ers many details that are not provided by other writers. Most importantly, he provides rich de-scriptions of the Cuzco solstice celebrations as well as the Citua celebration, during which the city was ritually cleansed, and the an-nual male initiation ritual. Readers of Molina’s work must, however, be careful as they compare his ritual accounts to those off ered by other early colonial authors, because all of Molina’s ritual descrip-tions are off by one month. For example, those rituals that are gen-erally thought to have occurred in June, are listed by Molina under the heading of May, and those celebrations that are thought to have occurred in December are listed in his description for November. Once this adjustment is made, comparisons between Molina and other sources can confi dently be made. Aft er describing the ritual calendar, Molina off ers shorter de-scriptions of several Inca rites that were not tied to a specifi c month (e.g., birth rituals, fi rst hair-cutt ing celebrations, female initiation rites, and marriages). Th e manuscript ends with concise descrip-tions of the Capacocha ritual, in which all the shrines of the empire were off ered sacrifi ces, as well as the Taqui Onqoy movement, a re-ligious cult that spread across the Andes during the late 1560s–early 1570s. Th roughout the manuscript, Molina also provides transcrip-tions of various Quechua prayers.1 Th e manuscript is not dated, and it is not known for certain when the Account of the Fables and Rites of the Incas was completed."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"xvi ] Account of the Fables and Rites of the incasNevertheless, most researchers who have worked with the docu-ment believe it was writt en between 1573 and 1575 (e.g., Romero 1943; Porras Barrenechea 1986; Urbano 2008a, 2008b). Since the text refers to the fall of Vilcabamba and the death of the last Inca, it is certain that the manuscript was writt en aft er 1572. However, the earliest date for the document is more precisely set by Lartaún’s as-cension to the Cuzco bishopric. Lartaún was appointed as the third bishop of Cuzco in 1570, yet he did not arrive in the city until 28 June 1573, and he formally entered the offi ce the following week on 4 July 1573 (Esquivel y Navia 1980: 232, 246; Vasco de Contreras y Valverde 1982: 96). Since Molina indicates in the opening sentence of the Account of the Fables and Rites of the Incas that the report was writt en at the request of Bishop Lartaún, the document must have been composed aft er early July 1573. Th e latest date for the manu-script is suggested by a lett er writt en by Francisco de Toledo (1943: xxiii) on 4 November 1575, in which the viceroy notes that Molina had already “busied himself learning and understanding the ancient rites and ceremonies that those Indians had.”An Overview of the Life of Cristóbal de MolinaTh e basic known facts of Cristóbal de Molina’s life are few, and most have already been reviewed by other authors (Markham 1873; Th a-yer Ojeda 1920; Loayza 1943; Porras Barrenechea 1986; Urbano and Duviols 1989; Calvo Pérez and Urbano 2008; Urbano 2008a, 2008b, 2008c).2 From Molina’s own statements, we know that he was born in Baeza, Spain, sometime before 1530,3 but there is no other infor-mation concerning his life before he arrived in Cuzco in 1556 at the age of about 27 (see “Th e Life and Times of Cristóbal de Molina”). Cuzco remained Molina’s primary residence until his death on 29 May 1585, although he was called upon during his lifetime to make various trips into the surrounding provinces (Porras Barrenechea 1986: 352; Millones 1990: 224–225). Perhaps because of his linguistic abilities, Molina was appointed as the priest of the Hospital for the Natives of Our Lady of Succor"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"introduction [ xviiin Cuzco in 1565 (Porras Barrenechea 1986: 350).4 Th e following de-cade was a time of great social upheaval in the central Andes marked by a resurgence of indigenous ritual practices, against which the Spaniards launched a series of repressive anti–idolatry campaigns. It was also a time of great political change, during which the last in-dependent royal Inca, Tupac Amaru, was captured and killed. Dur-ing this turbulent era, Molina’s responsibilities grew as he became the preacher general of the Cuzco parishes. He was also appointed as an inspector general (visitador general) by the ecclesiastical coun-cil of Cuzco and asked to visit various territories for evidence of idolatry.5 Around 1572 Molina authored a work on the history of the Incas. Although this manuscript is now lost, we know that he gave a copy to Lartaún. Molina’s history must have impressed the bishop, as Lartaún then requested that Molina write a second report focusing on the myths and rituals of the Incas. Although Lartaún instituted a series of rigorous reforms in the Cuzco region while he was bishop (Vasco de Contreras y Valverde 1982: 96), Molina won Lartaún’s fa-vor and was asked to continue in his positions as priest of the Hos-pital of the Indians and preacher general of the city. Like several other Spaniards who conducted interviews in Cuzco during the early Colonial Period (e.g., Ruiz de Navamuel 1882, 1940a, 1940b; Sarmiento de Gamboa 2007), Molina sought out the older indigenous men who had lived in the city during the fi nal years of the Inca Empire. He specifi cally mentions having in-terviewed men who participated in state rituals during the lives of the last three indigenous rulers of Cuzco, writing: “To this end, I ordered to assemble a number of very elderly men who witnessed and performed those ceremonies and rituals during [the] time of Huayna Capac, Huascar Inca, and Manco Inca, and some leaders and priests who were of those times.” However, unlike most of his contemporaries working in Cuzco, Molina was well qualifi ed to conduct these interviews in Quechua. One of the most important ecclesiastical events of the early Co-lonial Period was the Th ird Lima Provincial Council (1582–1583)."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"xviii ] Account of the Fables and Rites of the incasTh e provincial councils were held periodically to sett le issues of church hierarchy and to provide support for the evangelistic ac-tivities of the Church (Oré 1982; Timberlake 2008: 97). Th e third council was especially critical for Lartaún, as some twenty-three charges had been fi led against him from diff erent offi cials in Cuz-co (Millones 2008: 21). Since Lartaún died in Lima on 9 October 1583, before the council concluded, many of the charges were never resolved. Molina also traveled to Lima to att end the council. As he left the Cuzco region, Molina carried a lett er, dated 6 June 1582, from the leaders (caciques principales) of the eight parishes of the city, who were requesting that Viceroy Martín Enríquez (1581–1583) confer tax-exempt status on them (Porras Barrenechea 1986: 353; Urbano 1990: 276–277). Several of these men are also mentioned in Sar-miento de Gamboa’s (2007) History of the Incas, and they may have served as informants for both Molina and Sarmiento de Gamboa. Molina’s language skills were no doubt welcomed by the council as it toiled with one of its central tasks: the production of three trilin-gual (Spanish, Quechua, and Aymara) religious works to aid in the teaching of the Christian doctrine. However, while in Lima, Molina became sick and left the city before the council ended, so it is not known how much he actually helped the council with the publica-tions (Millones 1990: 227). It is also worth noting that Molina testifi ed two times in Cuzco, once before and once aft er the Th ird Lima Provincial Council, at inquiries into the services and anti-idolatry campaigns of Cristóbal de Albornoz.6 Th e fi rst took place in Cuzco on 14 January 1577 (Mi-llones 1990: 181–182). In his statement, Molina, who is simply in-troduced as a cleric priest (clérigo presbítero), indicated that he had known Albornoz for more than ten years and that Albornoz had successfully completed anti-idolatry campaigns in the area of Are-quipa and Huamanga (modern Ayacucho). Molina was called again to give testimony some seven years later, on 28 March 1584, on the services of Albornoz (Millones 1990: 223–228). Th is time Molina is introduced into the record in far more elaborate terms as “the il-"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"introduction [ xixlustrious Cristóbal de Molina, cleric priest, preacher general of the natives of this city, who was also inspector general of this bishop-ric.” Th is 1584 testimony is the last substantial document we have on Molina. He died in Cuzco a year and a half later at the approximate age of fi ft y-six.The History of the Incas and other works by Cristóbal de MolinaMolina wrote at least two reports on the Incas. Although no copy of Molina’s fi rst report, commonly referred to as the History of the Incas, has survived, we know that it existed because Molina records giving a copy of it to Bishop Lartaún. Th is is noted in the open-ing statement of Molina’s Account of the Fables and Rites of the Incas, where he also provides a brief summary of his earlier report.Th e account that I gave to Your Most Illustrious Lordship [described] the dealings, origin, lives, and customs of the In-cas who were the lords of this land; how many there were, who their wives were, and the laws they made, [the] wars they waged, and [the] people and nations they conquered. Because in some parts of that account I discussed the ceremonies and rituals they established, although not in much detail, I thought it was proper now, principally because Your Most Reverend Lordship has requested it of me, to expend additional eff ort so that Your Most Reverend Lordship [can] learn about the cer-emonies, rituals, and idolatries that these Indians had.Molina also refers to his fi rst report several times within the text of his Account on the Fables and Rites of the Incas. For example, Mo-lina specifi cally notes that his history contained a retelling of the Pacaritambo origin myth. In this myth, the fi rst Inca, Manco Capac, along with his brothers and sisters, emerged from a cave called Tam-botoco in the area of Pacaritambo (Bauer 1991). As they traveled to Cuzco, one of Manco Capac’s brothers, Ayarcache, was turned into"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"xx ] Account of the Fables and Rites of the incasstone at the summit of Huanacauri, becoming an important shrine of the Cuzco region. Molina refers to the creation of this shrine in the following: “[Huanacauri was] their principal huaca, which they said was the brother of Manco Capac, from whom they say they de-scended. So as to not make [this report] lengthy, I will not discuss the fable of this huaca here, having [already] made reference to it in the History of the Incas that I have done.” Molina also indicates that his telling of the myth appeared near the beginning of his earlier work, writing, “Because this [conversion of Ayarcache into stone] was included and discussed at length in the fable at the beginning of the History [of the Incas], which Your Most Illustrious Majesty has, I do not discuss it here. Your Most Illustrious Lordship can read it there.” We also know that Molina’s History of the Incas con-tained a description of the life of Inca Yupanqui, since Molina notes, “Th roughout his life, as is discussed in the account that Your Lord-ship has, everything [Inca Yupanqui] conquered and subjected was in the name of the Sun, his father, and of the Creator.” Furthermore, within Molina’s account of Inca Yupanqui’s life there appears to have been a section dedicated to the laws and sayings of this Inca king, since Molina notes the following in his religious report: “Con-cerning the laws and customs [that] he decreed, I stand by [the in-formation in] the account.” Since Inca Yupanqui7 was among the most important rulers of Cuzco, it is not surprising that his life was described in Molina’s History of the Incas.8 Researchers have long suggested that parts of Molina’s History of the Incas may be preserved within Miguel Cabello Valboa’s Mis-celánea antártica (1586), as this author notes that he used the work of the “venerable Father Cristóbal de Molina,” along with those of several other writers, to research the origins of the Inca kings (Markham 1873: viii-ix; Cabello Valboa 1951: 259–260). Both Cabe-llo Valboa and Molina were in Lima for the Th ird Lima Provincial Council, and perhaps this is when Cabello Valboa gained access to Molina’s manuscript (Núñez-Carvallo 2008: 91).9 A copy of Molina’s History of the Incas must also have been ar-chived somewhere in Cuzco. Dean Vasco de Contreras y Valverde,"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"introduction [ xxiwriting in Cuzco in 1649, specifi cally mentions it as an important source for his overview on the history of the city:Th ey give the same origin of the city’s foundation as they att ri-bute to the descent and royal blood of the Incas. I have found another version that mentions it, and in some length, in a man-uscript that, by command of Viceroy Don Francisco de Toledo, was writt en by Father Cristóbal de Molina. [He was an] ancient priest [and] scrutinizer of the intricate quipu annals of those times or, bett er said, labyrinths where the Indians would bar-barically imprison the memoirs of their ancient past. (Vasco de Contreras y Valverde 1982: 43 [1649]; my translation)It is widely assumed, based on the opening line of the Account of the Fables and Rites of the Incas, that Molina wrote his History of the Incas at the request of Lartaún on the bishop’s arrival in Cuzco (Urbano and Duviols 1989; Calvo Pérez and Urbano 2008; Urbano 2008b, 2008c). Yet it should be noted that Molina only indicates that he had given a copy of his history to Lartaún and that the bishop had then requested that a second study be made on the rituals of the Incas. Vasco de Contreras y Valverde’s reference to Molina’s History of the Incas, provided above, yields additional information on the social contexts as well as the creation data of the manuscript. He specifi cally states that Molina’s history was writt en at the request of Viceroy Toledo and that it was based on readings of quipus (knott ed cords used by the Incas to encode numbers and other information). Th e request would have been made during Toledo’s relatively brief stay in Cuzco (ca. February 1571–October 1572). Th e request would also have been among several others that Toledo made to various Spaniards, including Sarmiento de Gamboa (2007) and Ruiz de Na-vamuel (1882, 1940a, 1940b), to research the history of the Incas. Th ere was a third document that Molina also sent to Bishop Lartaún; however, it is unclear if Molina was the actual author of the manuscript or if he was only passing along information collect-ed by someone else. While describing the shrines (huacas) of the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"xxii ] Account of the Fables and Rites of the incasCuzco region, Molina writes: “Th ere were so many places in Cuzco that were dedicated for sacrifi ces that it would be very tedious if I describe them here. And because all the ways they sacrifi ced [at them] are included in the Account of the Huacas that I gave to Your Most Illustrious Majesty, I will not include this [information] here.” Bernabé Cobo (1990) is known to have copied a large document, now lost, by an unknown writer into his chronicle that included a detailed description of the shrines of the Cuzco region. Th e above passage by Molina has led some researchers to suggest that Molina may have been the author of this shrine document (Rowe 1946: 300; Zuidema 1964; Porras Barrenechea 1986). John Rowe (1980: 7), however, has pointed out that Molina does not specifi cally claim authorship of the shrine document but simply states that he gave the bishop a copy. Compelling evidence now suggests that Molina did indeed only provide a shrine document to the bishop and that the original author of this document, which Cobo later copied into his work, was Polo de Ondegardo. Th e shrine document was most likely writt en around 1559 during Polo de Ondegardo’s fi rst term as the chief magistrate of Cuzco (Bauer 1998: 13–22; 1999).Cristóbal de Albornoz and Cristóbal de MolinaCristóbal de Albornoz was one of the principal leaders in the Church’s struggle against the autochthonous religions of the Andes in the im-mediate postconquest era. From 1568 until his death in the early 1600s, Albornoz led a series of campaigns in the Peruvian highlands to identify and destroy native shrines and to punish the individuals and communities who worshipped them (Millones 2008). He was fi rst assigned the position of inspector general [visitador general] in the area of Arequipa (1568) and was then sent on a longer assign-ment (1569–1571) to Huamanga at the request of the ecclesiastical council of Cuzco and the governor of Peru, Lope García de Castro (Albornoz 1984: 215). It was during this period that a young indig-enous man named Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala, who would later become a writer, came into contact with Albornoz (Figure 1.1)."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"introduction [ xxiiiFigure 1.1Guaman Poma de Ayala (1980 [ca. 1615]: 675 [689]) illustrated Cristóbal de Albornoz and his assistant, Juan Cocha Quispe, during an anti-idolatry campaign against the Taqui Onqoy movement (ca. 1564–1572).

Toledo reconfi rmed Albornoz’s author-ity and gave him the title of Inspector General [visitador general] of Chinchaysuyo (Millones 1990: 179, 181–182; 2008). Albornoz’s anti-idolatry campaigns were largely focused on crushing the newly dis-covered Taqui Onqoy movement (ca. 1564–1572). During his many campaigns, Albornoz was personally responsible for the destruc-tion of thousands of huacas and the persecution of a vast number of individuals.10 His activities in the provinces of Soras, Apcaras, and Lucanas are especially well documented (Millones 1990). Molina and Albornoz interacted for several decades. Molina fi rst met Albornoz soon aft er the latt er’s arrival in Cuzco (1568), and they both spent the rest of their lives in the city, working under vari-ous bishops (Millones 2008). Th ey were also both very active in the anti-idolatry movements of their times. For example, while Albor-noz was inspecting Arequipa and Huamanga, it seems that Molina was working as an inspector in the Cuzco parishes (Millones 1990: 224). Th ey also held each other in great esteem. Albornoz was es-pecially impressed with Molina’s language abilities, and Molina admired Albornoz for the completeness and eff ectiveness of his inspections. As part of Molina’s work for the bishopric of Cuzco, he visited both Arequipa and Huamanga aft er Albornoz had con-ducted operations in these regions. As noted above, Molina testi-fi ed twice (1577 and 1584) on Albornoz’s success in destroying local shrines and punishing the local practitioners of idolatry. Molina and Albornoz were also in close contact while in Cuzco and appear to have worked together on certain occasions. At one such event, Molina preached to a large crowd on the day that two leaders of the Taqui Onqoy movement, who had been brought to Cuzco by Albornoz, were publicly punished (Millones 1990: 181, 225). Molina was also approached by Albornoz with the suggestion that they should join together “to cast a sweeping net so that no sorcery or idolatry would be left without being destroyed” (Mil-lones 1990: 227). Th ey also both att ended the Th ird Lima Provin-"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"introduction [ xxvcial Council (1582–1583), although they did not meet in the city but encountered each other somewhere outside of Lima, while Molina was on his journey back to Cuzco and Albornoz was arriving (Mi-llones 1990: 227).Viceroy Francisco Toledo and Cristóbal de MolinaFrancisco de Toledo was appointed to the viceroyalty of Peru (1569–1581) with unprecedented powers to calm growing disorder in the Spanish colony. Soon aft er arriving in Lima, he set out on an inspection of the Andes that was to last four years. Toledo reached the Cuzco region in late February of 1571 and departed for the Lake Titicaca region more than a year and a half later in October of 1572. During the course of his travels, Toledo collected information con-cerning the history of the Incas, and this research continued while he was in the imperial heartland. While in Cuzco, Toledo asked Molina to interview various offi cial quipu keepers to learn more about the history of the Incas. Similarly, on orders of Toledo, Ga-briel de Loarte and Álvaro Ruiz de Navamuel conducted a series of interviews in the Cuzco region on the history of the Incas (Levi-llier 1940). Finally, Sarmiento de Gamboa (2007), who was then the royal cosmographer traveling with Toledo, researched and wrote a History of the Incas, which was publicly read to the leaders of the dif-ferent kin groups of the city on 29 February and 1 March 1572 before being sent to Spain. Sarmiento’s manuscript is of special interest to this study, since it begins with a retelling of several Andean myths, including Vira-cocha’s creation of the world, Viracocha’s activities at Tiahuanaco, and the Cañari origin myth. Th ese same myths are also found in Molina’s Account of the Fables and Rites of the Incas. Although the two texts contain the same myths, each version gives unique details, making it clear that Molina did not copy Sarmiento’s work. Com-pare, for example, Molina’s and Sarmiento de Gamboa’s introduc-tions to the Cañari origin myth:"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"xxvi ] Account of the Fables and Rites of the incasIn the province of Quito there is a province called Cañariban-ba, and so the Indians who live there are called Cañaris aft er the name of the province. Th ey say that at the time of the Flood, two brothers escaped to a very high hill called Huacayñan that is in that province. Th ey say in the fable that as the waters were rising, the hill [also] did; hence the water was not able to reach them. (Molina)Th ey say that in the time of the unu pachacuti fl ood there was a hill called Huasano in a town called Tomebamba in the prov-ince of Quito. Today the natives of that land [still] point it out. Two Cañari men climbed this hill; one of them was named Ataorupagui and the other Cusicayo. As the waters kept rising, the mountain swam and fl oated in such a way that it was never covered by the fl oodwaters. Th us the two Cañaris escaped. (Sarmiento de Gamboa 2007: 46 [1572: Ch. 6])Although the two narratives are distinct, their similarities do imply that the authors shared some of the same informants.11 Since it is known that both Molina and Sarmiento de Gamboa were asked by Viceroy Toledo to write histories of the Incas in 1571–1572, and they both did so by interviewing the oldest surviving indigenous leaders of Cuzco, it is not surprising that they shared informants, or perhaps even att ended the same interviews. One of the most important events to occur during Toledo’s time in Cuzco was the capture of Tupac Amaru, the last indepen-dent Inca, in the remote region of Vilcabamba. A faction of the Inca nobility had retreated into the mountains of Vilcabamba in 1537 and had inspired a long-running guerrilla war against the Spaniards. To-ledo ordered a large-scale raid on Vilcabamba in June of 1572 to end this resistance. During the raid, Tupac Amaru was captured, and he arrived in chains in Cuzco on 21 September. Th ree days later, aft er a hastily arranged trial, Tupac Amaru was beheaded. During his brief time in Cuzco, Tupac Amaru was not only being judged but was also being converted to Christianity. Although a number of leading cler-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"introduction [ xxviigymen questioned the charges brought against Tupac Amaru and begged for mercy, Toledo was relentless in his zeal to kill the Inca and thus fatally weaken the long-standing indigenous resistance to Spanish rule. Antonio de la Calancha (1981: 1883) and Baltazar de Ocampo (1923: 172) both note that Molina was with Tupac Amaru on the day of his execution. Ocampo, having been an actual eyewit-ness to the event, provides the most detailed description:[Tupac Amaru] was accompanied on either side by the two mentioned friars and by Father Alonso de Barzana, of the Com-pany of Jesus, and Father Molina, cleric preacher of the Our Lady of Succor of the Hospital Parish, who went teaching and saying things of great consolation to his soul. Th ey brought him to a scaff old that was built on high in the center of the plaza, beside the cathedral. Th ey led him up there, and those fathers preached to him and conformed his soul with sacred prepara-tions. (Ocampo 1923: 172 [1610]; my translation)Although Molina was on the scaff old with Tupac Amaru when he was killed, he may not have been one of the religious leaders of Cuz-co who had asked for leniency. Th is is suggested by the fact that in his Account of the Fables and Rites of the Incas, Molina not only con-demns the Inca’s activities in the Vilcabamba region, calling it a den of thieves, but also praises Toledo’s defeat of the independent In-cas, writing that “Lord Viceroy Don Francisco de Toledo defeated and expelled them from there, through which God Our Lord was greatly served.” Whatever Molina’s views toward Tupac Amaru, it is clear that the priest impressed Viceroy Toledo. Some three years later, on 4 November 1575, while Toledo was in Arequipa, the viceroy wrote a lett er to the authorities in Cuzco praising Molina’s language abilities and his extensive religious work within the Cuzco parishes. In the lett er, Toledo (1943: xxiv) orders an adjustment of Molina’s annual salary on the condition that he continue to preach to the Indians of all the Cuzco parishes, including “each Sunday, and on all important"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"xxviii ] Account of the Fables and Rites of the incasreligious days of the year, in the central plaza beside the city’s main church.” It is clear that Molina retained this position until close to his death, since in 1584 he is still being introduced as the preacher general of Cuzco. Most signifi cantly for this study, Toledo’s lett er indicates that Molina had, by 1575, already collected information “on the ancient rites and ceremonies” of the Incas, a clear refer-ence to the materials included in Molina’s second report to Bishop Lartaún.Cristóbal de Molina, Luis de Olivera, and the Taqui Onqoy MovementIn 1564, while serving as a priest in the relatively remote province of Parinacocha, Luis de Olivera noted that previous missionary activi-ties had largely failed and that there was a resurgence—or perhaps simply the strong persistence—of native religious beliefs. On fur-ther investigation, he found that a growing social movement was turning indigenous peoples away from the teachings of the Church and encouraging them to return to worshipping local shrines. Th is movement was active not only in his parish but also in the nearby area of Acarí and various other regions of the Andes, including the largest cities. Olivera att empted to root out this “heresy” in the area of Parinacocha, and he denounced the movement to other Church offi cials, including the archbishop of Lima and the bishops of Cuz-co and Charcas.12 In the fi nal pages of his Account of the Fables and Rites of the Incas, Molina turns his att ention to the events fi rst recorded by Olivera in Parinacocha and later witnessed by other Spaniards across the cen-tral Andes. Basing his information on the (now-lost) report writt en by Olivera, Molina writes the following introduction:About ten years ago, more or less, a disaff ection began to spread among the Indians of this land, during which they performed a type of song that they called taqui onqoy. Because Luis de Olivera, a lay cleric in Parinacocha Province, which is in the"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"introduction [ xxixbishopric of Cuzco, was the fi rst to witness this disaff ection or idolatry while he was [the] priest of that territory, he explains here about the manner in which they carried it out and why.Th e discovery of this sect, now referred to as the Taqui Onqoy (taqui = to dance; onqoy = to fall ill)13 movement, provided the impetus for a series of massive campaigns aimed at destroying the indigenous religions of the Andes.14 Olivera, Molina, and Albornoz were active participants in those campaigns, and their anti-idolatry activities brought them into close contact with each other. For ex-ample, aft er Olivera had returned from the countryside to work in Cuzco, Albornoz conducted an offi cial inspection of Olivera’s for-mer Parinacocha parish, where he found that the cult had contin-ued to grow.15 Later, Albornoz also captured several leaders of the movement, and he brought them to Cuzco to be publicly punished. At the time, Olivera was working as the secretary of the ecclesias-tical council of Cuzco, and he heard the sermon that Molina, as preacher general of the city, delivered to the natives on the day that the indigenous leaders were punished. Following this event, Molina visited the Ayacucho region to confi rm that the heresy had been ex-tinguished (Millones 1990: 176–182). Later still, in 1577, Olivera and Molina provided sequential testimonies in support of Albornoz’s many years of work for the Church.16 Th e Taqui Onqoy movement was spread by native men and women who believed that they had become possessed by local deities. Th ese “preachers” visited various communities proclaim-ing that the time of the huacas was at hand. Th ey suggested that al-though the gods of the Andes had been defeated with the arrival of Pizarro, the huacas were rising again and would soon defeat the Spaniards, at which time control of the Andean world would be re-turned to its indigenous people. Molina writes the following:. . . they believed that all the huacas of the kingdom that the Christians had demolished and burned had come back to life, and had formed themselves into two sides: some had joined"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"xxx ] Account of the Fables and Rites of the incaswith the huaca of Pachacama[c] and the others with the huaca Titica[ca]. [Th ey said] that all of them were fl ying around in the air, ordering [the people] to give batt le to God and defeat Him. [And] they [claimed] that they were already defeating Him. And that when the Marquis [i.e., Pizarro] entered this land, God had defeated the huacas, and the Spaniards [had defeated] the Indians. But now, the world had turned around, [so] God and the Spaniards would be defeated this time, and all the Spaniards [would] die, their cities would be fl ooded, and the sea would rise and drown them so that no memory would be left of them.Th is reversal of fortune was to come about through the supernatu-ral intervention of the local shrines, and those natives who wanted to be saved from the coming apocalypse needed to renege their Catholic faith and reject all things Spanish. Th ey also needed to re-turn to their native religious teachings and worship the traditional huacas of the Andes. In short, it was believed that with the rise of the autochthonous gods, the period of Spanish rule over the Andes was coming to an end. Molina, using information provided by Olivera, provides a summary of the movement:Within this apostasy, they believed that God, Our Lord, had made the Spaniards, Castile, and the animals and supplies of Castile, but that the huacas had made the Indians, this land, and the supplies that the Indians had before [the arrival of the Spaniards]. . . . Th ey went about preaching this resurrection of the huacas, saying that the huacas now were fl ying through the air, dried out and dying of hunger, because the Indians no longer made sacrifi ces nor poured chicha to them. [Th e Indians said] that they had planted many chacras with worms to sow them in the hearts of the Spaniards, [in the] livestock of Cas-tile and [in the] horses, and also in the hearts of the Indians who remained Christians. [Th ey said] that [the huacas] were angry with all of the [Christian Indians] because they had been baptized and that [the huacas] would kill them all if they did"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"introduction [ xxxinot return to them, reneging on the Catholic faith. Th ose who wanted the friendship and grace [of the huacas] would live in prosperity, grace, and health. In order to return to [the huacas], they were to fast some days, not eat salt or chili, nor have sexual relations, nor eat colored maize, nor eat things of Castile, nor use them in food or in clothing, nor enter the churches, nor pray, nor respond to the calls of the priests, nor call themselves by Christian names. [Th ey said] that in this way, they would return to the love of the huacas and they would not be killed. Th ey also [preached] that the time of the Incas was returning and that the huacas [were] no longer entering stones, clouds, or springs to speak, but [they were] now themselves entering the Indians and making them speak.Th e Taqui Onqoy gained its name through the trancelike state that members of this movement experienced. Once possessed, individ-uals would speak on behalf of the huacas and instruct the villagers on how they should react to the coming cataclysm. Th e Spaniards were both surprised by the development of this movement and mystifi ed by the peculiar form in which it was mani-fested. Molina and others linked the Taqui Onqoy movement with the independent Incas entrenched in the Vilcabamba region.17 Al-though the continued resistance to Spanish rule by Manco Inca and his sons may have served as an inspiration to many natives, it was not the source of the Taqui Onqoy movement. Instead, it appears that the movement drew its origins from the nearly incomprehensible loss of control and the dramatic cultural transformations that were occurring across the Andes. Within just a few decades, the peoples of the Andes had seen the collapse of the Inca Empire, the decima-tion of their populations by unknown diseases, and their practical enslavement by strangers who looked and acted unlike any humans they had ever seen before. Although Lope García de Castro, who was then interim gover-nor of Peru (1564–1569), as well as church offi cials such as Molina, Olivera, and Albornoz, may have been puzzled by the appearance"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"xxxii ] Account of the Fables and Rites of the incasof the Taqui Onqoy movement and its profoundly religious dimen-sions, modern scholars are not. It is now widely accepted that the Taqui Onqoy movement falls within a broad class of social actions frequently termed “millenarian movements” (Millones 1964; Ossio 1973; Wachtel 1977; Stern 1982a, 1982b; MacCormack 1991; Mum-ford 1998).18 Th ese movements represent innovative religious re-sponses that off er hope to disadvantaged portions of a population. Numerous millenarian movements have been recorded throughout history, and they frequently occur in the wake of colonialism, such as the North American Ghost Dance of the 1890s and the South Pacifi c Cargo Cults of the 1940s. Th ese movements tend to call for a return to traditional customs and a rejection of the newly dominant social order. Th ey also include predictions that the current social conditions will be overturned by supernatural forces. Most of these movements are peaceful, but colonial powers oft en see them as a threat to their control over the civil population and go to great ef-forts to extinguish them. Indigenous resistance against the culture and power of Spain was widespread and took many forms over the next century, yet the specifi c Taqui Onqoy movement of the central Andes was relatively short-lived. It was fi rst noted by Olivera around 1564, and Molina reports that it lasted about seven years. Th e end of the movement, ca. 1571, coincides with Albornoz’s prolonged anti-idolatry activi-ties in the Ayacucho region, where he is credited with “pulling the movement out by its roots” (Millones 1990: 64) and punishing sev-eral of its leaders in Cuzco. As Molina introduces the Taqui Onqoy movement, he also provides information about what appears to have been another set of native beliefs. He suggests that some of the natives of Peru had come to fear contact with the Spaniards, thinking that they were able to extract a curative “ointment” from the indigenous people. Molina writes:[In] the year of [15]70, and not before, the Indians held and believed that [people] had been sent from Spain to this king-"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"introduction [ xxxiiidom [to search] for an ointment of the Indians to cure a certain illness for which no medicine was known except for that oint-ment. In those times [and] for this reason, the Indians went about very secretively, and [they] distanced themselves from the Spaniards to such a degree that no [Indian] wanted to take fi rewood, herb[s], or other things to a Spaniard’s house. Th ey say that [in this way, the Indian] would not be killed inside by having the ointment extracted from him.Th is fear is not specifi cally mentioned in any other colonial account, yet it appears to have developed from the same dismal social condi-tions that fostered widespread beliefs in the Taqui Onqoy millenar-ian movement (Wachtel 1977). In the above passage, Molina docu-ments that certain indigenous people believed that an ointment, most certainly fat, was being extracted by the Spaniards to cure a Eu-ropean disease.19 By the 1570s, an enormous number of native people had died as a result of the European infectious diseases (including smallpox, typhus, measles, and infl uenza) that had swept through the Andes aft er contact (Cook 1981, 1998). Native-born people were far more likely to die in these catastrophic epidemics, since they had no natural resistance to the newly introduced microbes. Th e belief in the ointment-taking abilities of the Spaniards appears to be an in-digenous explanation for the prevalent, and disproportional, death of native peoples aft er the arrival of European diseases. Within this context, the Europeans seemed to have had the ability to extract health from the native populations to save themselves. Th e belief was factually incorrect, but it provides a powerful metaphor for the social conditions that existed throughout the Colonial Period.Bernabé Cobo and Cristóbal de MolinaIn 1653, the Jesuit priest Bernabé Cobo completed his great work Historia del Nuevo Mundo (History of the New World), which in-cluded an overview of the history of the Incas and a summary of their myths and rituals. Cobo extracted much of his information on"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"xxxiv ] Account of the Fables and Rites of the incasthe history and religious practices of the Incas from earlier docu-ments stored in diff erent secular and ecclesiastical archives across Peru, but like most writers of his time, he was inconsistent in ac-knowledging his sources. Furthermore, in some sections he inter-wove passages from diff erent sources, and in other places he repro-duced entire blocks of information (Rowe 1980: 2). Nevertheless, it is clear that Cobo had a copy of Molina’s Account of the Fables and Rites of the Incas and that he relied on it heavily. Molina’s manuscript is specifi cally mentioned in the History of the New World, as Cobo discusses the major sources he used to research the Incas. Aft er dis-cussing Polo de Ondegardo’s famed 1559 document outlining the history of the Incas, as well as a second, lesser-known work that was produced during Viceroy Toledo’s stay in Cuzco, Cobo describes Molina’s work:And a litt le later, another general meeting of all the old Indians that had lived during the reign of the Inca Guayna Capac was held in the city of Cuzco itself by Cristobal de Molina, a par-ish priest at the hospital of the natives in the Parish of Nuestra Señora de los Remedios; this meeting was ordered by Bishop Sebastian de Lartaun and confi rmed the same things as the pre-vious meetings; the result was a copious account of the rites and fables that the Peruvian Indians practiced in pagan times. Th is information is substantially the same as that of Licentiate Polo and that of the report that was made by order of Francisco de Toledo. Both Toledo’s report and the account by Molina have come into my possession. (Cobo 1979: 100 [1653: Bk. 12, Ch. 2])Cobo reproduced many large blocks of text directly from Molina and lightly paraphrased others.20 We have marked the major sec-tions of Molina that were copied by Cobo in the footnotes of our English translation."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"introduction [ xxxvSummaryTh e Account of the Fables and Rites of the Incas remains an invaluable source of information about the Incas of Peru.

It was during the life of Manco Capac, who was the fi rst Inca, that they began to claim and call themselves “children of the Sun” and when the Sun worship and idolatry started. [During this time,] they heard important news about the Flood. Th ey say that all the [di ff erent] people and everything that had been created perished during it. So [it happened that] the waters rose over the highest hills that existed in the world, and hence nothing survived except a man and a woman, who remained in a drum box.

Th e reason for all this, besides the main fact that they did not know God and they gave themselves over to vices and idolatries, is [that] they were not people who use writing. Because if they [had] used [writing], they would not have [had] such blind and obtuse and foolish errors and fables.

Even though before the rule [of the Incas], their an-cestors did [track the] months and years on their quipus, they were not as well organized as when he was Lord, since they were only regulated by the winters and the summers. Th is [Lord] was so wise that he started pondering upon the re-spect and reverence that his ancestors have had for the Sun, not-ing that they worshipped him as a god who never stopped or rested and who traveled every day around the world. Th is [Lord] spoke and discussed with those of his council that it was not possible for the Sun to be the god who created everything, because if he were, a small cloud would not be able to pass in front of him and obscure his resplendence so he could not shine.

With regard to this, once [Inca Yupanqui] was Lord and was able to, he ordered a statue in the form of the Sun, which looked precise-ly like the one that he had seen in the mirror.

Th e Yauira huaca consisted of two stone hawks placed on an altar on top of the hill. Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui established this huaca so that [the warriors] would go there to receive their short trousers or loincloths, which they call guara. Th is huaca belonged originally to the Maras Indians, and Huascar Inca ordered the hawks to be placed [at] the huaca to embellish [it]. Th e sacrifi ce that was made to it was the burning of fi ve lambs and the pouring of chicha, [while] plead-ing with the Creator, Sun, Th under, and Moon to make those who were being armed as warriors valiant and fortunate fi ghters, to grant them good fortune in all that they did, and for [them] [to] never be defeated. Th e sacrifi ce was off ered by the priest of the Yauira huaca, pleading with the huaca to give the youths good fortune. And once the sacrifi ce was burned, the huaca[ca]mayo [shrine specialist], who was the priest, would give each of the youths loincloths that they call guara and red tunics with white stripes. Th is clothing was brought by order of the Inca from the tribute that was made across the land for this purpose. He would [also] give them gold earplugs, which they would fasten there in their ears; diadems of feathers that they call pilco cassa [pilco feather diadem]; and medallions of silver and others of gold, similar to and of the size of plates, which were hung from the neck to embellish them.15 8 Once they received these, they would eat and then perform the taqui called guari, which lasted for the space of one hour. Th at fi nished, the uncles and relatives again fl ogged the armed warriors, saying to them the mentioned prayers and telling them to emulate their ancestors, to be valiant warriors, [and] to never retreat.159 Th ey say that this taqui, which they repeated so many times in this festival, was given by the Creator at the time when Manco Ca-pac, their fi rst Inca [and the one] from whom everyone descends, emerged from the cave of Tambo[toco], so that they would sing it in this festival and in no other.

To perform this festival, they would bring to the plaza all the mentioned huacas and the bodies of the deceased Inca kings and queens to drink with them, placing those who had been lords of [H]anan Cuzco within that group and those of Hurin Cuzco within their group. Th ey brought food and drink to the dead as if they were alive, saying: “When you were alive, you used to eat and drink this.

Th e Inca would [then] arrive to take his [place], because [this] was next to the Sun. By this time, everyone else had gone to a house that they called Moro Vrco, which was next to the Houses of the Sun, to take out a very long rope that they kept there. [It was] made of four colors: black, white, red, and tan.18 0 At the beginning of [the rope], it had a ball of thick red wool. Th ey would all take hold of it with both hands, the men on one part and the women on another, performing the taqui called yaguayra.

Th ey circled around the entire plaza and once the extremes [of the rope] were joined, the beginning with the end, they performed their taqui in their order in such a way that, when they fi nished, [the rope] looked like a snail.

Th ey performed these celebrations with clothes that they call pucay onco, which were black shirts with a white band along the bott om, white fringes on its edges, and the feathers were white from some birds called tocto.

In all the celebra-tions, the drinking with the huacas was [done] in the same way. And as I say, half an hour before sunset, they would take the huacas to their houses and the Inca would go to his own. Performing this taqui, sacrifi ce, and drinking would last for two days. On the eighteenth day of the month, they arrived at the plaza dressed in very elegant clothes called angas onco [blue tunic], qui-lapi onco [silvery tunic], and small mantles, and on their heads [they wore] feathers called cupa ticas [tail feathers], which are from [the] tails of guacamayas [macaws] and pilco[s].

Th ey saved the charcoal and ashes from this sacrifi ce, as well as those from all the others that they made during the year, to throw them into the river the following day, as will be described.

Even though it was winter, they would build some rows of dams [in the river] to collect water so that the off er-ings that were to be thrown into it could be carried off with greater force. For this day they would have prepared all kinds and sorts of food that they used: all the types of chilies, a large number of coca baskets, all the [diff erent] kinds of colored clothes that they wore and [the] shoes that they used; [the] llautos [headbands] and feath-ers that they placed on their head, [as well as] livestock, fl owers, gold, silver, and everything that they used; also everything else and the charcoals that they had saved from the sacrifi ces that they had performed during the entire year. Th ey would throw all of this into the river and on breaking the fi rst dam, the [water] would cascade down with such force that it would break the other [dams] and car-ry the sacrifi ces away. [On] this day a lamb was burned in sacrifi ce, throwing its ashes and the charcoal, along with everything else, into the river (Map 5.4). Many people would stand on either side [of the river] at the outskirts of the city of Cuzco in a place that they call Pomapi Chu-pa,18 4 where they used to cast all those sacrifi ces. Th ey would throw them in a litt le less than an hour before the sun set. Th e Lord Inca, who was present, would order the Indians who were on either side of the river throwing the sacrifi ces into the river to follow the sacri-fi ce to Ollantaytambo, which, with the detour that they took, might be ten leagues from Cuzco. All the way to that town [alongside the river] were Indians from the towns through which [the sacrifi ce] had to pass, stationed in places with straw torches in order to burn during the night, making sure that nothing of the sacrifi ce was left in the river [and] giving light to those who were following [the off er-ings]. Once the sacrifi ces reached the Ollantaytambo bridge, which is a large river that goes to the Northern Sea,18 5 they would throw from the bridge two baskets of coca, called pilco longo [and] paucar ongo [pilco basket and multicolored basket]. And with this, they al-lowed the sacrifi ces to go on their own.

And because all the ways they sacrifi ced [at them] are included in the Account of the Huacas that I gave to Your Most Illustrious Majesty, I will not include this [infor-mation] here.15 Having fi nished with what was to be sacrifi ced in Cuzco, the priests brought out the sacrifi ces that were to be taken [to other re-gions], as has already been mentioned.16 Th e way they approached [the huacas] with the sacrifi ces was [the following]: All the people that [went] with the Capacocha, which by another name is called Cachaguaes,17 went grouped in bands, somewhat separated from one another. [Th ey] did not go directly by the royal road, but [in contrast, they would go] without turning anywhere,18 traversing the gorges and mountains that they found before them, until each one reached the part and place that [blank place] were waiting to receive the aforementioned sacrifi ces. Th ey would walk [and,] at intervals, led by one Indian who had been especially chosen and taught for this purpose, they would raise their voices and shout.

And thus, once they reached each part and place, those who were to perform the sacrifi ces, the huacacamayos [shrine special-ists], which means “guardian of the huacas,” and who were in charge of them, each received the sacrifi ce that corresponded to their hua-ca. Th ey would sacrifi ce and off er [those items], burying the gold, silver, mullu sacrifi ces, and other things that they used. Th e infants"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"82 ] Account of the Fables and Rites of the incaswho were assigned to [each] huaca were suff ocated fi rst. Th ey [also] burned the rams, lambs, and clothes assigned to them. It should be noted that they did not sacrifi ce infants to all the huacas, but only to the main huacas held by the provinces or lineages. Like this, they would continue walking across each of the four regions of the land that the Inca had conquered, making those sac-rifi ces until each had arrived, following the route they were going, to the farthest borders and boundary markers that the Inca had es-tablished.19 Th ey had such [accurate] accounting and calculations about this [celebration], and [since] what was to be sacrifi ced in each area and place left Cuzco so well allott ed, that although the sacrifi ce made was enormous and the places where it was to be done [were] innumerable, there was never an error nor did they mistake one place with another. For this purpose, the Inca had Indians from the four suyos or regions in Cuzco; each one [of them] had accounts and calculations of all the huacas of that region in which he was a quipucamaio, or record keeper, no matt er how small [the huaca] might be. Th ey called them vilcacamaio [shrine specialists], and [each] Indian was in charge of almost fi ve hundred leagues of land. Th ese had the accounts and calculations of the things that were to be sacrifi ced to each huaca, and so those who were to leave Cuzco took [the accounts] from the [vilcacamayo]. Th ey would subsequently give the calculations and accounts to the ones who would deliver the off erings from one to another. Nevertheless, in the capitals of the provinces, there were also Indians delegated for this purpose, who had accounts and calculations of the sacrifi ces that were to re-main in each province. But because they sometimes increased or reduced those sacrifi ces, according to the will of the Inca, they took from Cuzco the account of what was to be done in every part and place. Th ey held this sacrifi ce, called Capacocha or Cacha Guaco, in such veneration that if they were walking across an uninhabited [place], or anywhere, [and] they met some people, those who came upon the sacrifi ce [bearers] did not dare to raise [their] eyes and look at it.20 Instead they prostrated [themselves] upon the ground"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"the capacocha [ 83until they passed.

Th ey also believed that if something excelled among all the oth-ers of its kind, because it was more beautiful, then they [should] worship it and make it a huaca and shrine.

In the province of Parinacocha of the bishopric of Cuzco, the said Luis de Olivera, the vicar of that province, came to know that not only in that province, but in all the other provinces and cities of Chuquicaca, La Paz, Cuzco, La Paz, Cuzco [sic], Huamanga, and even Lima and Arequipa, most of the [people] had fallen into great apostasies. [Th ey were] departing from the Catholic faith that they had received and returning to the idolatry that they practiced in [the] time of their infi delity. It could not be learned who could have started this business, except it was suspected and discussed that it was an invention of the sorcerers whom the Incas kept in Vilca-bamba, where [the Incas] were uprising.4 Because this is what was believed to have occurred in this kingdom [blank space]. [In] the year of [15]70, and not before, the Indians held and be-lieved that [people] had been sent from Spain to this kingdom [to search] for an ointment of the Indians to cure a certain illness for which no medicine was known except for that ointment.5 In those times [and] for this reason, the Indians went about very secretive-Chapter 8"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"taqui onqoy [ 85ly, and [they] distanced themselves from the Spaniards to such a degree that no [Indian] wanted to take fi rewood, herb[s], or other things to a Spaniard’s house. Th ey say that [in this way, the Indian] would not be killed inside by having the ointment extracted from him.6 All of this was believed to have originated in that robber’s den [of Vilcabamba] to create enmity between the Indians and Span-iards.7 As the Indians of this land held everything of the Inca in such high regard, and [as they] claimed that the [belief ] originated there [in Vilcabamba], they were convinced very quickly in any [blank space] until the Lord Viceroy Don Francisco de Toledo defeated and expelled them from there, through which God Our Lord was greatly served.8 And returning to the resourcefulness of the devil in diverting these poor [souls],9 [it happened] that they believed that all the hua-cas of the kingdom that the Christians had demolished and burned had come back to life, and had formed themselves into two sides: some had joined with the huaca of Pachacama[c] and the others with the huaca Titica[ca].10 [Th ey said] that all of them were fl ying around in the air, ordering [the people] to give batt le to God and de-feat Him. And [they claimed] that they were already defeating Him. [Th ey said] that when the Marquis11 entered this land, God had defeated the huacas and the Spaniards [had defeated] the Indians. But now, the world had turned around, [so] God and the Spaniards would be defeated this time, and all the Spaniards [would] die, their cities would be fl ooded, and the sea would rise and drown them so that no memory would be left of them. Within this apostasy, they believed that God, Our Lord, had made the Spaniards, Castile, and the animals and supplies of Castile, but that the huacas had made the Indians, this land, and the supplies that the Indians had before [the arrival of the Spaniards]. In this way, they were stripping Our Lord of his omnipotence. Many preachers appeared from among the Indians, who preached both in the punas [high, remote grasslands] as well as in the sett lements.

[Th e Indians said] that they had planted many chacras with worms to sow them in the hearts of the Spaniards, [in the] livestock of Castile and [in the] horses, and also in the hearts of the Indians who remained Christians. [Th ey said] that [the huacas] were angry with all of the [Christian Indians] be-cause they had been baptized and that [the huacas] would kill them all if they did not return to them, reneging on their Catholic faith. Th ose who wanted the friendship and grace [of the huacas] would live in prosperity, grace, and health.

Th ey also [preached] that the time of the Incas was returning and that the huacas [were] no longer entering stones, clouds, or springs to speak, but [they were] now themselves entering the Indians and making them speak. And that they should have their houses swept and prepared in case any huaca wanted to lodge there. Accordingly, there were many Indians who trembled and threw themselves on the ground. Others threw stones as if possessed, gri-macing, and then they rested. People would fearfully approach [the possessed person] and ask him what was happening and [what] he [was] experiencing, and he would answer that a certain huaca had entered his body. Th ey would then take him in their arms and carry him to a special place, and there they would make a room with straw and blankets for him. Later, they would paint him in red12 and the Indians would come in to worship him with rams, colle [dark purple] chicha, llipta [an ash mixture], mullu, and other things.

Return it to its place, where it was during the time of the Incas.” And thus the sorcerers who were secluded and punished in that [town] would carry this out with many sacrifi ces [blank space]. Th ey freely used their ministries, returning to them, remaining be-side the Indians that had become huacas and receiving the rams and coies [guinea pigs] for the sacrifi ces. Th is evil was so widely believed and commonly celebrated that not only the Indians in the provinces14 but [also] those who lived in the cities among Spaniards followed and believed in this wretched-ness, fasting and corrupting [others].

In all, it lasted more than seven years. [Th e Indians] followed this apostasy [blank space] because they believed that God and the Spaniards were being defeated, [and] they tried to lead a revolt, as it was widely known in the year of [15]75 [sic].15 [Th is was] when Licenciado Castro was the governor"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"88 ] Account of the Fables and Rites of the incasof these kingdoms.16 He was informed of this from the chief mag-istrates of Cuzco, Huamanga,17 and Huánuco [blank space] [that] these cities had taken up arms.18 During this time, there were diff erent types of apostasies in dif-ferent provinces. Some [Indians] danced, suggesting that the huaca was in their body. Others trembled for the same reason, suggesting that it was in them too. Others shut themselves up in their hous-es and shrieked. Others mutilated themselves, had fi ts, and killed [themselves]. Others jumped into rivers, off ering themselves to the huacas. [Th is happened] until Our Lord was moved by his mercy to enlighten these miserable people. And those who continued [be-lieving in the huacas], on seeing the Inca dead and Vilcabamba [in the hands] of Christians, now have realized the trickery that they believed and was preached to them. [Th ese now believe] nothing of what occurred before, but [rather] the complete opposite.19 As a result of these demonic teachings, there are still some male and female Indian sorcerers, although not very many.20 So when some male or female Indian is ill, they call the [sorcerer] to cure them and to tell them if the person will live or die. Having evaluated the situation, they order to be brought for the affl icted white maize, which they call paracay cara [white maize]; black21 maize, which they call colli cara [dark purple maize]; mixed red and yellow maize, which they call cuma cara; [blank space] yellow [maize], which they call paro çara [dark yellow maize]; and other seashells that they call mullu mullu [many Spondylus shells], of every color there is, which they call ymaymana mullu [all kinds of Spondylus shells].22 Having all this collected, the sorcerer requests [that] the maize and the mullu be ground together. Once [it is] ground, he places it in the affl icted hand so that he can blow it, off ering it to the huacas and uilcas [holy places] of this land, saying these words:To all the huacas and uilcas of the four regions of this land, my grandfathers and ancestors, receive this sacrifi ce wherever you may be, and give me health."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"taqui onqoy [ 89Th ey also make him blow a bit of coca to the Sun, off ering it to him and asking him [for] good health.

Th e margin notes found on Molina’s document are very similar to some re-corded on Joan de Santa Cruz Pachacuti Yamqui Salcamaygua’s Relación de an-tigüedades deste reyno del Pirú (ca. 1613), which is contained in the same volume (see Duviols and Itier 1993), and may refl ect the same hand. 2. Th ese inconsistencies most certainly refl ect the insecurity of the copyist and not the linguistic skills of Molina (Porras Barrenechea 1986). 3. We have also standardized the spelling of ayllo, cacique, chacra, Citua, huaca, inti, mitimas, mullu, Onqoy, quipu, raymi, sanco, and taqui.Introduction1. Very few Quechua prayers were recorded in the early Colonial Period. Consequently, the prayers off ered by Molina have been the subject of inten-sive study by various scholars, including Castro (1921); Rojas (1937); Farfán Ayerbe and Benigno (1945); Rowe (1953, 1970); Meneses (1965); Beyersdorff (1992); and Calvo Pérez and Urbano (2008). 2. Th ere is some confusion in the identifi cation of the Cuzqueño priest Cristóbal de Molina in early documents, since there were a number of other individuals with the same name living during the early Colonial Period (Rive-ra Serna 1949). Several of these individuals lived in the city of Cuzco and were close relatives of Cristóbal de Molina (ca. 1529–1586). Most recently, Urbano (1990) has published a series of archival records from Cuzco that have added to our general understanding of Molina’s life and those of his relatives who shared similar names. 3. Molina gives various estimates of his age in diff erent documents (Porras Barrenechea 1986: 350; also see Millones 1990: 180, 224)."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"94 ] notes to pages xvii–xxxiii 4. Molina’s skills in Quechua were such that the fi rst modern research-ers investigating his life suggested that Molina might have been of European-Andean descent. Subsequent documents have revealed that this was not the case. 5. Rivera Serna (1949: 592) states that Molina fi nished a second visitation of the Cuzco region on 6 August 1576. 6. Molina was also interviewed briefl y concerning the laws of the Incas on 2 April 1582 (Córdoba Mexía 1925: 279–281). 7. Also known as Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui. 8. Lists of sayings may have been a common part of Inca oral history, as Garcilaso de la Vega (1966: 396–397), copying from Blas Valera, also provides a list of sayings from Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui. 9. Various researchers have also suggested that Molina’s History of the Incas may have been a source used by Martín de Murúa. However, since Murúa used Cabello Valboa, as well as a host of other chroniclers, the exact role that Mo-lina’s History of the Incas played in Murúa’s writing is not clear. For a detailed discussion on Murúa and his sources, see Adorno (2008) and Ossio (2008). 10. During his anti-idolatry work in the Ayacucho region (1569–1571), Al-bornoz charged more than eight thousand natives of being involved with the Taqui Onqoy movement (Millones 1990: 64). 11. Molina also appears to have shared an informant with Juan de Betan-zos (1996). Overlapping details are especially clear in their descriptions of the male initiation rite of the Incas. 12. All copies of Olivera’s report are now lost. Th ere was certainly a copy in Lima in 1570 (Millones 1990: 63), and another was used by Olivera and Molina in Cuzco in 1577 (Millones 1990: 175-182). 13. At the time of its discovery, the movement was also called Aira (Mi-llones 1990: 63). 14. See MacCormack (1991) for a detailed overview of Andean religious practices at the time of Spanish contact. 15. Th is inspection of Parinacocha most likely occurred in 1568 while Al-bornoz was the inspector general of Arequipa. 16. Olivera was the last person to testify on 12 January 1577. Th e testimo-nies continued two days later, on 14 January 1577, with a statement by Molina. 17. Spanish fears of indigenous rebellions increased following a failed na-tive uprising in the Jauja region in 1564 (Hemming 1970). 18.

He was installed on 4 July 1573 (Esquivel y Navia 1980: 221, 232; Vasco de Contreras y Valverde 1982: 96). Lartaún died in Lima on 9 October 1583 while att ending the Th ird Lima Provincial Council (1582–1583). 2. Molina indicates that his Account of the Fables and Rites of the Incas is the second of two reports that he gave to Bishop Lartaún. No copy of the fi rst report has survived, but it is generally referred to as the History of the Incas, be-cause it described the lives of the Inca kings. Since both Miguel Cabello Valboa (1951: 258) and Dean Vasco de Contreras y Valverde (1982: 96) note that they used information from Molina’s History of the Incas while writing their own chronicles, sections of Molina’s lost manuscript may be preserved within the folios of these authors’ works. 3. Huayna Capac was the last king to rule a united Inca Empire. Aft er his death (ca. 1526), which may have been caused by a European-introduced dis-ease (Cook 1981), a civil war broke out between his two eldest surviving sons, Atahualpa and Huascar. Th e civil war ended in 1532 with Atahualpa’s execu-tion of Huascar, which was followed by Francisco Pizarro’s execution of Ata-hualpa. Th e following year, Pizarro had Manco Inca, another son of Huayna Capac, coroneted as Inca when the Spaniards entered Cuzco. Manco Inca broke from the Spaniards in 1536, and aft er a failed att empt to regain control of Cuzco, he retreated into the Vilcabamba region. Manco Inca was murdered in Vilcabamba by Spaniards to whom he had given sanctuary in 1544, but his sons continued to resist Spanish rule until 1572 when Tupac Amaru, Manco Inca’s youngest son, was captured and executed by Viceroy Toledo (Hemming 1970).Chapter Two1. While discussing the shrines of Cuzco, Cobo (1990: 82) also notes the exis-tence of this temple. It was located southwest of Cuzco in an area that is still called Puquin. House-construction activities in the late 1980s uncovered a large number of cut stone blocks in this area that may have been part of the temple (Bauer 1998: 129–130). 2.

For example, those rituals that are generally thought to have occurred in June are listed by Molina under May, and those celebrations that are thought to have occurred in De-cember are listed in November. 2. Molina describes the year as beginning with a new moon within a few days of mid-May. Because his months are off by one month, we should read this as the year beginning around mid-June. Th is seems to be a general reference to the time of the 21 June solstice (near 25 June in the Gregorian calendar). 3. Th e Inti Raymi celebration took place around the time of the June solstice. 4.

Th ese were called pancuncu, and took a long time to burn. Each was fastened to a cord a fathom in length, and they used to run through all the streets trailing the torches till they were outside the city, as if the torches removed the evils by night as the spears did by day.

Cieza de León provides a similar account when describing the Capacocha:Th us they say that it was the custom of the Incas of Cuzco to have all the statues and fi gures of the idols in the huacas, which were the temples where they worshipped, brought into that city each year. Th ey were transported with great veneration by the priests and camajocs, which is the name of the guardians. When they entered the city, they were received with great feasts and processions and lodged in places set aside and appointed for that purpose. And the people having assembled from all parts of the city and even from most of the provinces, men and women, the reigning mon-arch, accompanied by all the Incas and orejones, courtiers and important men of the city, provided great festivals and taquis.

Cobo (1990: 149) uses parts of this paragraph in his description of the month of Ayarmaca. 131. Cobo (1990: 126–134) incorporates most of Molina’s discussion of November in his account of the Capac Raymi ritual. For another detailed de-scription of Capac Raymi and the male initiation rite, see Cieza de León (1976: 35–37). 132. Th e male initiation rite continued to be held aft er the Spaniards took control of Cuzco. Betanzos, who provides his own detailed description of this ritual, writes:. . . they continued doing it that way up to this present year we are in, which is 1551. Th ough att empts have been made to suppress them in this city of Cuzco, the people go out and secretly perform this fi esta and the others that this lord [Inca Yupanqui] established in the small towns sur-rounding this city of Cuzco. (Betanzos 1996: 64 [1557: Pt. 1, Ch. 61])Th e continuation of the Capac Raymi rituals is also noted by Polo de Onde-gardo, who writes:During these celebrations the Inca youths were dedicated and were given the huaras, or breechcloths, their ears were pierced, they were whipped with nett les by the elders, and their faces were completely smeared with blood as a sign that they were to be loyal knights of the Inca. No stranger was permitt ed in Cuzco during this month and celebration, and at the end of the festivities all those from the outside came in and were given certain cakes of maize with blood of sacrifi ces, which they eat as a sign of alliance with the Inca. Various ceremonies were carried out, which, since it is believed that they are no longer performed, will not be described. It will merely be noted that the donning of the huaras, or breechcloths, by the youths, who are 12 to 15 years old, is still done today and is widespread among the Indians.

Molina mentions these sandals various times during his description of the Capac Raymi celebration. Betanzos provides additional information on them, telling the reader why this footwear held such an important role in the initiation ritual of young men:. . . they dress him in that tunic of black wool that those women made him and put on him the shoes made of straw, which the young man will have made while fasting so that they would know that if the young man were in a war and needed shoes he would know how to make them of straw and pursue the enemy with those shoes on. (Betanzos 1996: 61 [1557: Pt. 1, Ch. 61]) 134. Betanzos also describes these scarves and headbands, writing:Aft er he has the shoes on, they will put a black band around his head. On top of this band they will put a white sling. Around his neck they will tie a white cloak that hangs over his back. Th e cloak will be narrow, two spans wide, and hang from his head to his feet.

Cobo describes in detail such an act of reverence:Facing their gods or their temples and guacas, they lowered their heads and their bodies in a profound show of humility, and they would stretch their arms out in front of themselves, keeping them parallel to each other from the beginning to the end, and with the hands open and the palms out, a litt le above the level of their heads.

Cobo (1990: 29) used this description of the Moon idol in his chronicle. 138. According to Inca mythology, several important events occurred at Matahua during the lives of Manco Inca and his son Cinchi Roca (Cabello Balboa 1951: 263, 264, 268; Cobo 1979: 109). It was located near the base of Huanacauri; see Bauer (1998: 110–112). 139. Betanzos provides a more complete description of these “bunches of straw,” writing:Aft er this, they will give him a handful of straw as big around as a wrist. Th e tips of the straw should be pointing up just as it grows. To the other end of this straw, there will be hung a small bunch of long wool, which looks almost like a small amount of long, white hemp. (Betanzos 1996: 61 [1557: Pt. 1, Ch. 61]) 140. Th is is a reference to the Pacaritambo origin myth of the Incas. 141. Location unknown. 142. Flogging and whipping continue to be part of many ritual dances in the Cuzco region. 143. Th e use of seashells as musical and ritual instruments is still common in the Andes. 144. Detailed descriptions of Inca rituals are extremely rare. Ramos Gavi-lán does, however, provide a description of the Inca male initiation ritual oc-curring in the town of Copacabana on the shore of Lake Titicaca. Th ere are clear parallels between the Copacabana ceremony and that conducted in Cuzco:At some solemn and joyful celebrations, every group, neighborhood, or ayllo would bring their boys, up to thirteen or fourteen years old, more or less, and they would gather them in a public place, where the [children] could be seen by everybody. Th ere they were beaten with certain slings made of animal skins on their feet, arms, and hands, until they shed some blood. Aft erward, the principal of that group would scold those beaten [boys], giving them good advice, telling them that they were no longer to live as boys, since they had reached the age at which, as men, they had to concern themselves with things related to the service of their commu-nity and of the Inca, their Lord.

Th e hill still retains the name Llallinaco (since the Olympic games were performed there). To motivate and challenge the boys in running, those who arrived fi rst to the top, at the end of the race, were rewarded. Th ey were given certain silver discs that the Indians used in their llautos (that are like their hats), and those discs are called canipos; or they were given certain chuspas (that are hanging bags, like tahelíes [Islamic signs of faith] that cross the chest), which they still use to put coca in. Th ese [chuspas] that were given as re-wards were extremely curious because they were [made] of cumbi and only the principal people were allowed to use them. Th ose who compete in these Olympic Games were nobles, because the Inca always liked to have himself served by people who were [nobles].

[He did so] because the Inca considered them brave [and held them] in high respect, since they had proven themselves. As a sign that he had installed them as nobles, and so that they could be known as such, he had their ears pierced, which was the insignia of nobles and braves.

Betanzos also describes this special clothing:Once he is in the city, they will dress the neophyte in a red tunic with a white stripe across the middle from bott om to the top of the tunic with a certain blue border at the bott om of the tunic. Th ey will put a red band on his head. (Betanzos 1996: 61 [1557: Pt. 1, Ch. 61]) 146. Betanzos also mentions the importance that halberds played in this ritual:When they are there, the relatives of this neophyte, who are almost like godfathers, will carry some long halberds of gold and silver.

Several other early colonial writers mention this place (also spelled Yauraba, Auraba, and Rauaraya) in relation to the initiation rites of young men; see Bauer (1998: 124). 148. Th e important role that young women played in this ritual is con-fi rmed by Betanzos, who writes:One month aft er the beginning of this fast, his relatives should bring him a young maiden who has never known a man. While also on a fast, this maiden will make a certain jug of chicha, which will be called caliz. Th e maiden will always walk along with the young man during the sacrifi ces and fasts. She will serve him as long as the fi esta lasts. Th e relatives of the neophyte accompany him and the maiden carrying the litt le jug of chicha called caliz. . . . As the young man arrives this way where the guaca is, with the maiden carrying that litt le caliz jug, she will fi ll two small tumblers of chicha and give them to the neophyte. He will drink one of the tumblers and give the other to the idol by pouring the chicha out in front of it. (Be-tanzos 1996: 61 [1557: Pt. 1, Ch. 61]) 149. Location unknown. 150. Th e mountain of Anaguarque is located between Huanacauri and Cuzco. Th ere is a small plain on the mountain summit with a clear view of Cuzco.

Th is run will be from the guaca to a hill where this city comes into view. Certain Indians will wait in this place so that they will see how these neophyte warriors arrive running and who arrives fi rst. Th e winner will be honored by all his people.

Th is hill, writt en as Rauaraya, is also mentioned as part of the ceque system by Cobo (1990: 79 [1653: Bk. 13, Ch. 16]), who writes, “Th e fourth was called Rauaraya. It is a small hill where the Indians fi nished running on the feast of the Raymi, and here a certain punishment was given to those who had not run well.” 156. Sarmiento de Gamboa (2007: 123) also mentions a Guamancancha. Its exact location is not known; Cobo (1990: 56) suggests that it was near Sac-sahuaman, whereas Albornoz (1984: 204) places it above the nearby Cuzco suburb of Carmenca. 157. Th is shrine was also included within the sacred places of the Cuzco ceque system (Bauer 1998: 70). Cobo (1990: 61) notes that this shrine (Apu Yauira) was located on the hill of Piccho, which is immediately to the west of Cuzco, and that people went to it during the festival of Capac Raymi. Th e shrine is also mentioned by Cieza de León (1976: 35) and Albornoz (1984: 204), both of whom indicate that youths participating in the initiation rites gathered at it several days aft er their ascents of Huanacauri and Anaguarque. Betanzos provides the following description of the ritual activities that took place at the huaca during the male initiation rites:Th e next day they will leave the city for a place where I will point out another guaca tomorrow. It will be called Yavira and will be the idol of the favors. When they are there they will have a big fi re built and off er to the guaca and to the Sun sheep and lambs, beheading them fi rst. With the blood of these animals they will draw a line with much reverence across their faces, from ear to ear. Th ey will also sacrifi ce in this fi re much maize and coca. All of this will be done with great reverence and obeisance in making the off ering to the Sun. (Betanzos 1996: 62 [1557: Pt. 1, Ch. 14]) 158. Betanzos also describes this special clothing:Next right there they will put a very colorful tunic on the neophyte and a very colorful cloak on top of everything. Th ese will be very fi ne garments. Th ey will put on his ears some large gold earplugs, fastened with red thread. Th ey will place a large gold scallop shell on his chest and put straw shoes on him.

Polo de Ondegardo’s information is later copied by Acosta (2002: 316) as well as by Ramos Gavilán (1967: 153). 163. Betanzos also describes the puma-skin costumes and the drums used in this ritual:Th ere they will fi nd all the lords of Cuzco dressed in long red tunics that come down to their feet. Th ey will have tanned lion skins on their backs, the heads of the lions over their own heads and the faces of the lions in front of their faces. Th ese lion heads will have gold ear ornaments.

Calispuquio was an important spring behind the fort of Sacsayhua-man that is mentioned by various early colonial writers as well as in archival documents (Bauer 1998: 55). Most importantly, Betanzos also describes the young male initiates visiting the spring, writing:Th e Inca ordered that aft er the thirty days had elapsed the relatives of these neophytes should assemble there in the square and bring the neo-phytes with them. Aft er thrusting the halberd into the ground, the neo-phytes remain standing, hold the halberd in their hands, and extend their arms; their relatives will then beat them with slings on their arms so that they will remember this fi esta.

Th ese are the cactus fruit commonly called tunas (prickly pears, Opuntia fi cus-indica). Several other writers describe this ritual batt le between Hanan and Hurin Cuzco. For example, Betanzos writes:Th e next morning all of the neophytes will go out into the square in mili-tary formation as if they were going into batt le with their slings in their hands. Around their necks they will carry net bags full of tunas. Th e same number will be placed on either side of the square as they start their batt le or fi ght.

Th ey say it was 150 fathoms long, more or less. It was used in their public festivities, of which there were four principal ones a year . . . In these festivities, they would take the rope from the House or storehouse of the Sun, and all the principal Indians, splendidly dressed, would take hold of it in [hierarchi-cal] order.

Cobo explains:In order to celebrate on the day of his birth, his father Guayna Capac had a golden chain made very thick and so long that the Indians could dance while holding on to it, instead of holding hands; and there was enough room for two hundred persons to dance with it, spread out like a wing.

Evidence of Capacocha off erings has been recovered at the summits of various mountains (Reinhard 1983, 1985; Ceruti 2004). 3. Th is same location is mentioned in Molina’s description of the Citua celebration, there spelled Satpina. 4. Here Molina uses the Quechua verb to adore (muchoy) with the Spanish location indicator (adero) to write “mochadero” or “place of worship.” 5. Cobo (1990: 112–113, 155) copies much of this information into his work. 6. Here Molina uses the Quechua word for shrine (huaca) with the Span-ish diminutive (illos), to write “huaquillos,” or “litt le shrines.” 7. Cobo (1990: 155–156) incorporates much of this paragraph into his own work. 8. Very few other early colonial writers support the suggestion that the Incas cut the hearts out of their sacrifi cial victims, and no archaeological evi-dence has been found to support this statement. Th e description may have been infl uenced by accounts of Aztec off erings. 9. Th e smearing of blood from ear to ear is mentioned by various writers; see Cornejo (2002).118 ] notes to pages 72–79"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" 10. Chuquicancha is most likely the ruins that are now called Rumi Huasi Bajo and Rumi Huasi Alto. Th ey are located on a hill above the town of San Sebastián (Bauer 1998: 87–89). 11. Parts of this paragraph were copied by Cobo (1990: 112). 12. Molina provides another transcription of this same prayer earlier in his manuscript. 13. Earlier in his manuscript Molina indicates that this shrine “was shaped like a person, although its face could not be seen.” 14. According to Inca origin myths, the very fi rst Incas were four brothers and four sisters who emerged from the cave of Tambotoco at a place called Pa-caritambo. One of these mythical brothers was named Ayarcache. Th is myth is told by many early colonial writers, and it would have been included in the fi rst few chapters of Molina’s History of the Incas. Cabello Valboa (1951: 256–264) provides an especially long description of the myth as well as Ayarcache’s con-version into stone at the top of Huanacauri, which may be based on Molina’s earlier account. 15. Here Molina refers to an earlier document concerning the shrines of the Cuzco region that he gave to Bishop Lartaún. 16. Cobo (1990: 156) copies much of this information into his work. 17. Albornoz (1984: 218) also used this term, writing Cachauis. 18. In other words, the priests traveled in straight lines. 19. Cobo (1990: 155–157) copies much of this information into his work. 20. Cobo (1990: 156–157) copies much of this information into his work. 21. Th is is most likely a transcription error for the word apachitas. Apachi-tas are piles of stone made by travelers next to roads on mountain passes.Chapter Eight1. At this point there is an abrupt change in the narration of the document. Molina shift s from describing the rites and rituals of the Incas to discussing a religiously inspired cult, now referred to as the Taqui Onqoy movement, which had recently arisen in the Andes. His major source of information on this subject was a document writt en by Luis de Olivera, perhaps in 1565, which Molina summarized for Bishop Lartaún. 2. Th e text contains the word yronía (irony). Following Mumford (1998: 151), we have elected to translate it as disaff ection (ironía). 3. Many works have been writt en concerning this indigenous movement (for example, see Millones 1964, 1990; Ossio 1973; Wachtel 1977; Stern 1982a, 1982b; MacCormack 1991; Mumford 1998). 4. Here Molina refers to Manco Inca and his sons, who had retreated from notes to pages 79–84 [ 119"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Cuzco to the Vilcabamba region in 1537 and who led a forty-year war of resis-tance against Spanish rule in the Andes. 5. It appears that aft er mentioning Vilcabamba, Molina became sidetracked from summarizing Olivera’s report and mentions an unusual belief that he had seen among the natives and that he also believed originated with the Incas in Vilcabamba. 6. In this passage, Molina documents that the indigenous people of the Andes believed that an ointment, most likely fat, was being extracted by the Spaniards to cure a European disease. Th is may have been an indigenous reac-tion to the numerous European diseases that were affl icting the Andean popu-lations in disproportional numbers and severity. 7. Th ere is no support for the claim that the Incas in Vilcabamba were be-hind any such movement. For much of their time in Vilcabamba, the Incas were in contact with the Spaniards in Cuzco and were involved in extensive negotiations for the end of hostilities. 8. Th e fi nal Spanish raid into Vilcabamba took place under Viceroy To-ledo’s orders in 1572. Th e raid resulted in the capture of Tupac Amaru. 9. Here Molina returns to his summary of Olivera’s report on the Taqui Onqoy. 10. Th e shrine of Pachacamac was located on the coast of Peru just south of modern-day Lima, and the shrine of Titicaca was located on the Island of the Sun in Lake Titicaca (Bauer and Stanish 2001). Th ese were two of the most important shrines in the pre-Hispanic Andes. 11. In this case, the Marquis was Francisco Pizarro. 12. Molina uses the word “enbixauan,” the root of which comes from the plant “Bija” (Bixa orellana) from which a red paint (achiote) is made. Also see Barcena (1988). 13. Lusate is an unknown term. Calvo Pérez and Urbano (2008: 130–131) suggest that it could be Portugal (i.e., Lusitania). 14. We have elected to translate repartimientos as “provinces.” 15. Th e date [15]75 is a copyist error; the date should be [15]65. 16. Lope García de Castro was the interim governor of Peru from 1564 to 1569. He was responsible for sending Albornoz to Arequipa in 1568 and to Hua-manga in 1569–1571 to rid these territories of the Taqui Onqoy. 17. Modern Ayacucho. 18. Only a few months aft er Lope García de Castro arrived in Lima as the new president of the Audiencia (September 1564), plots for an armed re-volt were discovered in Jauja and elsewhere in the highlands; see Hemming (1970). 19.

Here Molina returns to the central thesis of his manuscript, describing the rites and rituals of the Incas. 21. Th is should read “purple maize.” 22.
