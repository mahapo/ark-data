If errors remain in the Mayan text, they are certainly not her fault, and any errors in the interpretation of it are far more likely to be mine. I shall always be grateful for her attitude of generous collegiality and for a collaboration which in this instance verges at times on coauthorship. The anonymous readers of the manuscript for the University of Texas Press have also been more than ordinarily helpful, and I have tried hard to pay proper attention to their suggestions. If I have failed in that attempt, both the fault and the loss are mine. I am grateful to Tulane University for my sabbatical leave in 1980, and to the National Endowment for the Humanities I owe additional thanks for making it a full year and enabling me to get a lot more done—faster. This was my first leave of absence from teaching after thirty years, and I can readily understand now how sabbaticals could become habit-forming. I am deeply indebted to the late Roger T. and to Doris Z. Stone for provid-ing me with a pied-à-terre outside New Orleans and for their friendship and encouragement before, during, and after my sabbatical year.

Conventionally, they are mainly named after the towns in which they were found, and fourteen Books have been so titled, even though only five contain the defining sermons (chapters 7, 9, 10, 13, and 21 of the present volume). These are the Chu-mayel, Tizimin, Mani, Chan Cah, and Kaua. A sixth, the Tusik, contains \"The Language of Zuyua\" (chapters 30 and 31) and is therefore germane to this volume. The others are not: the Ixil because it is medicinal in charac-ter, the Tekax and Nah (of Teabo) because they are calendrical, and the Hocaba, Nabula, Telchac, Tihosuco, and Tixkokob because they are lost. Three other documents have sometimes been classified as Books of Chilam Balam but should not be: the Cuaderno de Teabo, a medical text, and the Crónica de Oxkutzcab (or Crónica de los Xiu) and Crónica de Calkini, purely historical works. These are certainly useful parts of gen-eral Mayan literature, as are the Ritual of the Bacabs and the Títulos de Ebtun, but they have nothing to do with the Spokesman of the Jaguar. I accept Barrera Vásquez' argument (1948: 39) that the Teabo is merely an-other name for the Tekax, and I accept as well his reclassification of the Oxkutzcab. In addition to the sermons already mentioned, the four central Books of the Chilam Balam tradition—the Chumayel, Mani, Tizimin, and Kaua— share a series of katun histories, and the first three of them have some chronicles in common. Thanks to the translation of Roys (1967) in En-glish (first edition, 1933) and those of Mediz Bolio (1930) and Barrera (1948) in Spanish, the Chumayel has come to be the best known of all the Books, but sections of the texts (especially the chronicles) have been translated by a number of others. A concordance of the various manu-scripts and translations will be found in appendix A. The history of the manuscripts is ably summarized by Barrera (1948: 17ff.), updating previous treatments by Tozzer (1921) and Roys (1933). I do not agree with Barrera and Roys that the manuscript of the Chumayel was compiled as it stands by Juan Josef Hoil in 1782. It shares with the Ti-zimin and the Mani the tale of Antonio Martinez (chapter 46), which"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION clearly dates itself to 11 Ahau (1824-1848), and the Mani version of the same text was copied by Juan Pío Pérez at Mani in 1837. The Chumayel must therefore have been written between 1824 and 1837. The original was in the hands of Audumaro Molina and then in those of the bishop of Yucatan, Crescencio Carrillo y Ancona, by 1868. It was in Philadelphia in 1913, in Merida in 1916, in Boston in 1938, and in Durham, N.H., in 1945, was lost when Barrera wrote in 1948, and has only recently resur-faced in the Princeton University Library (Edmonson 1970). Unless otherwise noted, the documentation for the following assertions is to be found in the present volume or in its predecessor, cited as the Tizimin (Edmonson 1982). References to both works are cited by line or note number, and both books are copiously indexed. On calendrical mat-ters, see also Edmonson 1976. Language The language of the Chumayel is Yucatecan Maya, which, as the early Franciscans noted with great relief, was and is a widespread and homoge-neous tongue spoken in the Mexican states of Yucatan, Campeche, Quin-tana Roo, and Chiapas, in the Guatemalan department of Peten, and in Belize (formerly British Honduras). Even the most deviant dialects (the Lacandon of Chiapas and the Mopan and Itza of Belize and Guatemala) offer only minor obstacles to intelligibility. In the peninsula of Yucatan it is possible to differentiate between an eastern and a western dialect, the former being identifiable with the Itza of Chichen (as opposed to those of Peten), the latter with the Toltec Xiu. Following the usage in the Chumayel, I have used Itza throughout to mean the Itza of Chichen un-less otherwise specified. The Chichen Itza and the Toltec Xiu were the two principal groups of elite lineages in post-Classic and colonial Yucatan. The town of Chumayel is close to the political and linguistic boundary between the Itza and the Xiu, but its affiliations are clearly with the lat-ter, and it identifies the Xiu and their language simply as Maya 'people of the cycle'. The Tizimin, which comes from Itza territory, uses the term Itza 'water witches' in a similar fashion and refers tothe western Yuca-tecans as Tutul Xiu (Náhuatl 'Toltec grasses'). To the south of the Chichen Itza were the provinces of Uaymil and Chetumal. It is my guess that they and Belize constituted a dialect area ancestral to Mopan, but the conquest decimated their population, and the original inhabitants were swamped by immigrants from eastern and west-ern Yucatan. To the southwest of Champoton, in the ancient provinces of Tixchel and Acalan, lay the territory of the Chontal, but, while the ancestors of both the Itza and the Xiu entered Yucatan from that direction, I find no reason to believe that the Chontal had any particular cultural or linguistic influence on either of them, Thompson (1970) notwithstanding. Still far-ther to the west, in southern Veracruz, was Nahuat country, speaking the southern dialect of Náhuatl, and there is clear evidence of Nahuat influ-"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 3n of the lumayel original bishop of idelphia in H., in ly resur-; assertions as the y line or rical mat-e early homoge-che, Quin-andin cts (the :emala) Yucatan it ilect, the o those of e .hen un-'ere the al boundary i the lat-'people of the term n Yuca-iland ect area n, and the and west-Tixchel ïstors of ! find no r linguistic .

Many Xiu had Nahuat names, and there is a thin scattering of Nahuat place-names: May-apan, Zaciapan, Tzimentan, Zuyua, Pax Ueuet, P'en Cuyut, and Yucatan itself. It is perhaps surprising that there are not more, as there are in Chiapas and Guatemala. The Xiu were fond of characterizing the Itza as stupid, stuttering foreigners, but this is a political slur rather than a lin-guistic allegation, and it is clear that the Xiu were the more foreign (that is, Mexicanized) of the two. The influence of Spanish on the language of the Chumayel is far greater than that of Nahuat. (And there are nearly three times as many Hispani-cisms as in the Tizimin.) This corresponds to the fact that the Spanish penetration into Yucatan, like the Nahuat incursion, was primarily from the west, and the initial conversion and the linguistic as well as religious instruction occurred earlier and were more intensive at Merida and Mani than in the Itza towns. Furthermore, the Xiu saw prompt conversion as a way of making the Spanish their allies against the still pagan Itza, and the Xiu texts constantly exhort the stupid, stuttering Itza to convert and ac-cept \"our older brothers\" the Spaniards. It is congruent with this picture that the Chumayel contains a notable infusion of Latin, while the Tizimin contains none at all. To be sure, it isn't very good Latin, but it is clearly identifiable, even if not always easily deciphered. Much of the Latin appears in eighteenth-century texts, but nonetheless it seems to represent a survival of the effects of the inten-sive Franciscan missionary effort of the sixteenth century, especially at Merida, Mani, and Izamal. Nearly half of the text of the Chumayel may be considered to be com-posed in Classical Yucatec (McQuown 1967). The latter half has under-gone various degrees of modernization, but even the latest segments differ substantially from modern spoken Yucatec, and all of it presents prob-lems of phonology, syntax, and vocabulary. The orthography of the text is generally clear, but it is flawed at a num-ber of points. The globalized consonants (written pp, th, o, ch, and k) are not always reliably copied, and the glottal stop is not written at all. Vowel length is phonemic in Yucatec but is not always indicated. Vowel tone is also phonemic but is not marked at all. I have transcribed the text as it is written, except for changing o to tz', ch to ch', pp to p', and the abbrevia-tion y to y etel ('and, together with'). Many of the long-standing problems of Mayan lexicography have been solved by the publication of the Diccionario Maya Cordemex, under the direction of Alfredo Barrera Vásquez (1980). Unfortunately, the present translation was completed before this invaluable resource became avail-able. I prepared my own card file dictionary, incorporating Brasseur 1872; Pío Pérez 1866-67; Solís Alcalá 1949; Swadesh, Alvarez, and Bastarrachea 1970; Roys 1931; Blair and Vermont-Salas 1965-67; approximately one-third of the Motul dictionary (Ciudad Real 1600); and my own notes from work with informants, principally Eleuterio Poot Yah of Hocaba and Me-rida. This general dictionary contained some thirty to forty thousand cards and several times that many entries. I then condensed this into a"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION root dictionary of about four thousand entries. I have translated primarily from these two instruments, consulting other dictionaries when neces-sary (see the bibliography in Barrera 1980). The lexical problems of the Books of Chilam Balam are severe, and it would be foolhardy to claim to have solved them all. I am satisfied that I have solved some of them, and I believe that some of these solutions are consequential beyond the minutiae of specific etymologies. Four ex-amples will illustrate this point. 1. Ix. In my notes this can be a particle meaning 'she who, little, too, shoo!'; a noun for 'scales', the day name 'jaguar', or something to do with 'chalk'; or a verb for 'spoil' or something like 'lie in'. Previous transla-tors have opted for the first two alternatives, preferring to read ix as a feminine marker or, failing that, as a diminutive. I find that the form can much more frequently be sensibly read as 'and'. In the nineteenth-century dictionaries (e.g., Brasseur 1872), it is frequently reduced to x and often appears in compounds with sentence-initial elements [baalx, macx, hex, etc.). I read these as 'and what', 'and who', 'and that'. This form first occurs in the Chumayel text in \"The Third Chronicle\" (tenth century): la ix u katunil cime i 'and that was the katun count of the death' (lines 295-296). Then we read yx ma pic tz'ul u kaba 'and For-eigners without Skirts was their name' (line 309). Or again: buluc ahau u katunil ti ix hop'i xpnoil lae '11 Ahau was also the katun period that be-gan Christianity' (lines 360-362). Ix is frequently encountered as an element in place-names, earliest (and still preconquest) at t ix meuac (line 910). I assume that the implication here is diminutive: no important town or city is so named. It may or may not be significant that it is not until after the conquest that we encounter an ix that might mean 'she', and even then the usage is extremely rare. Of the seventeen goddesses listed by Barrera (1948: 83), I am prepared to concede one: Ix Tab, goddess of the hanged. I believe all the others to be phrases introduced by 'and'. I am also willing to grant the plausibility of Ix Chel, goddess of the rainbow, who didn't make Barrera's list for some reason, and there can be no doubt about the acceptability of ix mehen 'daughter' or ix ahau 'queen'. 2. May. This is an even more consequential lexical problem, since it goes to the heart of the whole organization and meaning of the Books of Chilam Balam. This noun may signify 'dust, hoof, mild, example, wink', but by far the most frequent implication is 'cycle', specifically the cycle of thirteen katuns. Previous translators have passed over the term because it does not seem to have made the dictionaries, but from the contexts in which it appears I believe its meaning to be unmistakable (Chumayel, line 5315; Tizimin, lines 2121, 2914, 2942, 4879, 5067). Thus at differing dates Mayapan, Merida, Valladolid, and other cities are referred to as may cu 'seat of the cycle'. Landa (Tozzer 1941: 27) acknowl-edges the titles ahau can may 'rattlesnake of the cycle' and ah kin may 'sun priest of the cycle' as references to the highest priesthood in Yucatan but without understanding their significance.

He was expected to hold office for a full katun, and it was competition for this position of power, prestige, and profit that the katun histories are all about. It is the Spokesman [chilam) of this priest who provides the name to the Books of Chilam Balam. The importance of the seat of the cycle is underlined by a number of related usages. The city that had this honor was held to be sacred: born of heaven, ziyan caan, or, in the case of Merida, caan zih. It was regarded as the capital ( tan cah 'front city' or tan tun 'front stone'), and its plaza was the Plaza [zac lac tun 'white flat stone'; see Tozzer 1941: 230) and the re-ligious center of the country, along with its ceiba tree (yax che 'green or first tree' but by color symbolism 'center tree') and its cenote [ch'een). It is this last feature which explains the name Mayapan 'cycle water place', which would translate back into Maya as Chi Ch'een Maya 'well mouth of the (people of the) cycle'. When Valladolid became the seat of the cycle in 1752, it was called both Mayapan and Zaciapan 'well mouth of the white sparrow hawk' as well as 'heaven born'. The Maya were clearly the people of the cycle in post-Classic and co-lonial times and had been for a very long time (Edmonson 1979). The 13-katun cycle based on the 360-day tun, the central and unique feature of the Mayan calendar, appears to have been the basis for dynastic politics in the Classic period. Mayanists have been accustomed to referring to this cycle as u kahlay katunob 'the account of the katuns', a barbarism popu-larized by Morley (1946), but that expression properly refers to the katun histories. The cycle itself was called the may, and it was still going strong in the nineteenth century. 3. Cangel. Previous translators have not really known what to do with this expression, and it is curious. It is also spelled canhel and in one case congel; see also the unusual rebus spelling 2n hel, line 1366. The use of the letter g, which does not occur in Maya, strongly suggests a conscious syncretistic pun. The clear meaning of can hel is 'four changers', and the reference is to the yearbearers, both as gods and as priests. But c angel in colonial Maya could also mean 'our angels' and probably did mean that to the nativistic sun priests, who were trying to preserve the Mayan religion against the onslaught of.\"tbeir\"angels. The yearbearers were the 4 days out of the sacred 20 that could begin the 365-day year (the hab). As directional gods and priests they were known collectively as can tzicnal 'the four honored ones' [pace Landa, who rarely gets his Maya altogether straight and offers this as the name of a single divinity). In the period from 1539 on, these days were Kan, Muluc, Ix, and Cauac in that order, Kan being the senior member of the four. Their directional associations rotated counterclockwise annually, beginning with Kan in the east and repeating after four years. The days took numeral prefixes from 1 to 13 successively, so the calen-dar round cycle that began on 1 Kan repeated after 4 times 13 or 52 years. Such a cycle began in 1581.1 believe this is the reference of the expres-sion kin tun y abil 'day stone year period', which is paired in the Chu-mayel and Tizimin with ma ya cimlal 'no pain death'. Roys (1967: 138) JL"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION and Barrera (1948: 65) interpret these expressions as referring to diseases, but from the contexts in which they occur I am convinced that they al-lude to the calendar round and its sacrifices (see below). As gods, but again also as priests, the yearbearers are identified as Fa-thers of the Land [ba cabob) and as rain gods [chacob], and they may also be identical with the four Stone Giants [pauah tun), the four winds [ikil), and the four death gods [tenel ahau). They are also closely associated with the four Burners [ah toe). All these sets of deities, then, are in charge of time, rain, death, the sky, and fire, and they are conceived in various connections as bearing the burden of the sun and holding up the four cor-ners of the sky. Because of their directional associations, the yearbearer priests also ap-pear to be given color titles: red, white, black, and yellow for east, north, west, and south, respectively. They may all be referred to by the suffixed title chac 'rain priest', but the prefixed title chac 'red' refers to the East priest. | Chac may also mean 'boil, fuzz, appear, trample, big' and is the name of a lineage and a village as well, so it is not always easy to deter-mine which meaning is intended.) In some contexts a fifth priest is added to the basic four, identified with the color yax 'blue/green' and the direc-tion of the center. Unlike Roys (1967: 139, notes), I regard this usage as a Mexican aberration. The rain priests, who apparently wore ceremonial necklaces, are re-ferred to as necklaced rain priests [yuuan chac). They were also identified by honorific kinship terms (father, mother's mother, and younger brother rain priest). The yearbearer ceremonies of 11 Ahau are described in detail in chapter 15. 4.

These two expressions have commonly been inter-preted on the basis of colonial dictionaries as 'drought' and 'pestilence', respectively. I believe that this interpretation is usually (though perhaps not always) wrong as a reading oí the Chumayel text. The phrases occur as a couplet in lines 5039-5040 (and in the Tizimin, lines 319-320, 2615-2616). Kin tun y abil occurs alone in lines 1247, 5158, 5224, and 6178; and ma y a cimlal occurs in lines 112, 338, 2643, 4922, 5325, and 6283 (also in the Tizimin, lines 675, 722, 2770, 2920, 3646, 3932, 4090, 4537, 4637, 4771, and 5269). I read them as 'calendar round' and 'no pain death', respectively, and I consider the latter expression as a euphemism for sacrifice, perhaps specifically for calendar round sacrifices. If the calendar round in the Mayapan calendar (see below) began on 1 Kan, as I believe it did, there are eight such beginnings in the twenty katuns between 1441 and 1848. If the calendar round began on 1 Ik, as I believe it did in the Tikal calendar (see below), there are eight such begin-nings in the same time span, but they land in different katuns. Four ka-tuns oí the twenty do not correspond to the beginning of a calendar round in either system. Six of the eight calendar round beginnings in the Tikal calendar corre-spond to katuns in which either kin tun y abil or ma ya cimlal or both are mentioned in the Chumayel or the Tizimin.

The calendar rounds beginning in 1477 and 1581 are missed. The texts for the remaining four katuns (those without calendar round beginnings in either system) include mention of ma ya cimlal once in each book (Chumayel, line 4922 and Tizimin, line 3932), both in relation to the same katun (beginning in 1638). There are twenty-four occurrences of one or the other of the two expres-sions, separately or together, in the two Books, thirteen in the Tizimin and eleven in the Chumayel. In sixteen of the twenty-four cases the con-texts are clearly calendrical; in the remaining cases they concern illness, famine, or warfare. I conclude that it is likely that the colonial Maya cal-culated the calendar round in both the Mayapan and the Tikal calendars and that they used the two expressions under discussion to refer both to the calendar round and its sacrifices and to drought and plague. But the commoner usage seems to have been the former. Science Mayan science was highly but differentially developed, and scientific as-pects of Mayan culture receive distinctive treatment in the Chumayel. References to biology are numerous (agriculture, animals, plants, food, medicine; see the index), though less full than in other sources, such as the Kaua or the Ritual of the Bacabs (Roys 1965). The physical sciences receive very short shrift. Chemistry is largely a matter of cuisine. Physics and geology scarcely appear. Geography is largely ritual, focusing upon meteorology and ceremonially important places (caves, cenotes, the sea, the directions, wells, roads, cities, towns, villages, ports, and Yucatan's meager hills; see the index and appendix B). Psychology is implied here and there by assumptions about perception and motivation. But the highest development of Mayan science occurred in mathematics and astronomy, and both are correspondingly prominent in the Chumayel, two chapters of which (32 and 39) are entirely concerned with calendrical and astronomical matter». The Maya were extraordinarily fond of measur-ing and counting things. This is reflected in the language itself, which has several hundred numeral classifiers. They counted things by the pack, by the pile, by the stack, by the mound, heap, bend, pinch, fragment, fold, bunch, bundle, piece, cup, cask, bowl, plate, fistful, handful, armload, net-load, and so on and on. They found out that there were 11,200 Itza and 6,050 pyramids in Yucatan. They measured value in cacao beans and quetzal feathers. They measured linear distance by the thumb joint, the thumb, the palm, the span, the foot, the forearm, the pace, the armspan, a man's length, the shot (the distance a man can shoot an arrow, perhaps a hundred meters), the shout (the distance a man's voice carries, perhaps a kilometer), the rest or stop (the distance a man can carry a load before resting, perhaps four kilometers), and the sleep (a day's travel). They used a measuring stick [p'iz te) to survey land in \"paces\" analogous to the A*>-."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION Spanish vara (but presumably shorter, as the Maya themselves are). And above all they measured time. Not all the above units appear in the Chumayel, but a number of them are used metaphorically in relation to the calendar (particularly the fold, cup, bowl, plate, cask, foot, pace, shot, shout, and rest), and all these are frequently mentioned. The fundamental units in the counting of time were the kin 'days, suns'. The Maya had no clocks, and their conceptions of the divisions of day and night were gestural indications of the movements of the sun and stars. They were correspondingly imprecise—nothing like Greek geometry de-veloped in Mayan mathematics. But Mayan arithmetic was sophisticated and precise, and the Mayan calendar was a marvel of both mathematical and astronomical accuracy. The number series is named in Maya in decimal fashion, with separate roots for each numeral from 1 through 10 and compounds for the nu-merals from 11 through 19. However, the word for '20' is simply the word for 'man' {uinic), and most higher numbers are counted vigesimally in units metaphorically equated with 20 and its multiples {kal 'armload' = 20, bak 'coil' = 400, pic '?knuckle' = 8,000, and chil ^occasions''='\"\" 3,200,000). Linguistically it was a decimal system, but conceptually it was a vigesimal one. The Tzol Kin. • The basic unit of the calendar was a period of 20 named days, the uinal (see appendix C). The names of the days are evocative, ar-chaic, and broadly similar in meaning in the various calendar systems of nuclear Middle America, though many of them cannot be clearly trans-lated, particularly not in Yucatec. The myth of the origin of the uinal is given in chapter 20 together with folk etymologies for the meanings of the day names. They are almost always puns. In effect, the uinal is a sec-ond and sacred number system, and it is entirely vigesimal. Along with the cycle of the day names was the cycle of the 13 sacred day numbers, the xoc kin. These were counted permutadvely and concur-rently with the day names: 1 Imix, 2 Ik, 3 Akbal, 4 Kan, 5 Chicchan, etc. The number count from 1 to 13 and then from 1 to 7 completes the uinal, which the Maya noted tersely: \"13 and 7 make 1.\" Thus the numerals 1 and 7 came to represent the concepts of alpha and omega, the beginning and the end, and the unity of the divine. If a given uinal begins with 1, its successors will follow a 13-uinal se-quence running 1, 8, 2, 9,3, 10, 4, 11, 5, 12, 6, 13, 7. It then starts over. Thus in this cycle, too, 1 is the beginning and 7 is the end. The com-pleted cycle of 13 uinals constitutes a tzol kin or 'count of days'. This cycle of 260 days was the intertribal calendar of Middle America from Costa Rica to Michoacan. Because 20 has the factors 4 and 5, the Maya were impressed with the one-fifth tzol kin (4 x 13 = 52 x 5 = 260 days) and the one-quarter tzol kin (5 x 13 = 65 x 4 = 260 days) and used those cycles in ritual and divination along with the complete tzol kin of 260 days. The Tun. Because the Maya counted vigesimally, it is likely that they originally counted uinals by twenties as well as by thirteens (as the Cak-chiquel days.

However, they became persuaded at an early date that a cycle which more closely approximated the solar year would be more convenient, and they settled on a cycle of 18 uinals, or 360 days, which they called the tun 'stone'. All the uinals of the tun began with the day Imix and ended with the day Ahau, and their numeral coefficients followed the same se-quence as the tzol kin: 1, 8, 2, 9, 3, 10, etc. This cycle is neither named nor exploited in any other Middle American calendar, though it is impli-cit in the cycle of the 365-day year. From long before the birth of Christ down to the middle of the eigh-teenth century, the Maya counted time in tuns. As with the uinals, they counted them by both thirteens and twenties. The 13-£un cycle simply started over, and it seems to have remained unnamed, but the 20-tun cycle was numerologically more interesting. Called the katun 'pile of stones', it became the basis of the Long Count Mayan calendar. As in the tun, all uinals within the katun began with the day Imix and ended with the day Ahau, at least before 1539—after 1539 they began with Ahau. Whether they are last or first, the numerical coefficients of these Ahau days yield a cycle of 260 tuns or 13 katuns. The period of the katun (7,200 days) divided by 13 gives 553 cycles of 13 and a remainder of 11. Thus the sequence of the coefficients of the Ahau days that ended (or, later, began) the katun followed the order 13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2. This cycle of 13 katuns was called the may, a cycle of 260 years minus 1,300 days, 160 days short of 256 years of 365 days each. It was the basis of the longest calendar count in general use in post-Classic and colonial times, and it is fundamental to the reli-gion and politics of the Chumayel. There was continuing disagreement over the correct counting of this cycle. The Xiu and the Peten Itza followed the Classic Mayan cycle and counted the may as beginning with 6 Ahau and ending on 8 Ahau. The Chichen Itza counted it as beginning with 11 Ahau and ending on 13 Ahau. (Aberrant cycles beginning with 1, 4, 5, and 13 Ahau also appear to be alluded to in the Chumayel, though these may be late or even non-Mayan speculations.) It is convenient to identify the 6 to 8 cycle as Xiu and the 11 to 13 cycle as (Chichen) Itza. - --Like uinals and tuns, katuns were counted by twenties as well as by thirteens, 20 katuns making up a baktun '400 stones'. The Maya wrote Long Count dates on their Classic monuments and in their books using this unit and a convention of place value enumeration. A bar was 5, a dot was 1, and the symbol for zero was ^^. There were glyphs for the bak-tun, katun, tun, uinal, and kin. Thus a typical Long Count date may be transcribed as 11.17.0.0.0 (11 baktuns, 17 katuns, no tuns, no uinals, no kins). All these units were counted vigesimally from 0 to 19 except for the uinals, which were counted from 0 to 17, thus totaling 18. (Zero in Maya is m ix baal 'no little thing' or ma nun 'not one'.) The Maya stopped carving Long Count dates on their monuments in the katun end-ing 10.6.0.0.0 (948), but they did not stop using them. Contrary to what has usually been supposed, Long Count dates are explicitly mentioned in"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"IO INTRODUCTION the Chumayel; the latest one known is the one cited above, 11.17.0.0.0, corresponding to 1559, the beginning of katun 9 Ahau. There is clear evi-dence that the Maya were still counting them at 12.0.0.0.0 (1618). The Hab. The use of the tun, katun, and baktun was unique to the Yucatecan Maya, but they shared with the other cultures of nuclear Mid-dle America the 260-day tzol kin and the 365-day hab or \"vague year.\" They reached this cycle by counting 18 uinals of 20 days each and adding another uinal of 5 days. The uinals of the hab are different from those of the tun because of these extra 5 days, so they were distinguished by being given names, and their days were numbered serially from 0 to 19 (or, in the last uinal, from 0 to 4; see appendix C). Also because of the extra 5 days, the tzol kin count operated differently within the hab from the way it worked in the tun. The first day of the year advanced by 5 day names each year, and, since 5 goes into 20 4 times, only 4 of the 20 sacred days (every fifth one) could begin the year. These were the yearbearers [ah cuch hab) or the four changers [can hel). The yearbearer that began the first uinal of a given year also began all the others. Different calendars used different yearbearers. The Olmecs, for example, used their equivalents of Type I (Imix, Cimi, Chuen, Cib). The Quiche, Cakchiquel, Ixil, and Classic Maya used Type II (Ik, Manik, Eb, Caban). The Aztecs, Tzotzil, and Tzeltal used Type III (Akbal, Lamat, Ben, Etz'nab). The colonial Maya used Type IV (Kan, Muluc, Ix, Cauac). The Type V set (Chicchan, Oc, Men, Ahau) is the focus of the Yucatecan Burner cycle of fire ceremonies, which is completed once in each quarter tzol kin (65 days). Each of the yearbearer sets is ranked; Kan, for example, is the senior yearbearer in the colonial Mayan system (see appendix C). Since 13 goes into 365 28 times with a remainder of 1, the numeral co-efficient of the first day of the year advanced by 1 each year, thus produc-ing a cycle of 13 years, each such cycle being associated with a direction. The cycle beginning with 1 Kan was east, 1 Muluc was north, 1 Ix west, and 1 Cauac south. The same day appeared with the same coefficient only after all four cycles had been completed, producing the kin tun y abil or calendar round of 52 years. In the colonial calendar, the calendar round began on 1 Kan in 1581, for example. The yearbearer for each year was also associated with a direction, the yearbearer for the current year always being seated in the east. At the be-ginning of the 5 dreaded days of the final uinal, Uayeb 'specter steps', the year's end ceremonies were initiated. These 5 were called nameless days [x ma kaba kin), although they were numbered and named normally both in the tzol kin count and in the hab count. The yearbearers were then ro-tated counterclockwise and the new year ceremonies were held, the year-bearer for the new year taking his seat in the east. The general relationship among these various cycles was well under-stood by the Maya. They realized that 73 tzol kins equaled 52 habs (52 x 365 = 73 x 260). They knew that 72 habs equaled 73 tuns (72 x 365 = 73 x 360). And they calculated that 9 x 65 = 13 x 45 = 585, just a day more than the Venus year of 584 days!

On the Classic Mayan monuments, formal dates are recorded in all three of the major cycles that have been described. Such a date is preceded by an initial series glyph to warn of its coming. Then follow the Long Count, tzol kin, and hab dates, for example, 11.16.0.0.0 13 Ahau 8 Xul, which was November 13, 1539 (Gregorian). Thiswas the last day of the Tikal calendar. The Tikal Calendar. From the earliest known dates of cycle 7 (353 B.C.) to 1539, the Maya used the classical calendar, first identified at Tikal. From 1539 to 1752 they used the colonial calendar, inaugurated at May-apan, and from 1752 to 1848 (and perhaps later), they used a second colo-nial calendar inaugurated at Valladolid. Certain aberrant inscriptions sug-gest a fourth calendar, largely found in the Usumacinta Valley, but that does not affect the dating of the Chumayel (Edmonson 1976). The Tikal calendar used Type II yearbearers, numbered the days of the uinals of the hab from 0 to 19, and counted katuns terminally. It used the Xiu cycle (the may), ending in 8 Ahau. Its last katun, 13 Ahau, ended on 11.16.0.0.0(1539). The Mayapan Calendar. In or shortly before 1539, a calendrical congress was held to resolve the Xiu-Itza dispute over the cycle. This resulted in the promulgation of a new calendar which both groups accepted, inaugu-rated first by the Itza in 1539 at Mayapan and then slightly later in the year at Merida by the Xiu. The Xiu compromised by accepting 11 Ahau as the beginning of a new cycle. The Itza compromised by accepting initial dating of the katun. They both compromised by agreeing to disagree: the Itza seated the new cycle at Mayapan, the Xiu at Merida. The date chosen was dictated by calendrical considerations—the conjunction of the cycles was unusually favorable to the change contemplated. The Mayapan calendar was inaugurated by the Itza on 11 Ahau, 80 days before the end of katun 13 Ahau on 11.16.0.0.0. It differed from the calen-dar of Tikal by adopting Type IV yearbearers, numbering the days of the uinal from 1 to 20, and naming the katuns from their initial days rather than their final ones. It did not alter the Long Count. The change was lit-erally epochal. As with B.C. and A.D. centuries, Mayan dates for the may and the katun before 1539 are counted backward from their endings, and those afterward are counted forward from their beginnings. The Valladolid Calendar. As dated in the Mayapan calendar, katun 4 Ahau began in 1737. Five years before it ended, a new calendar was pro-mulgated at Valladolid. By calendrical coincidence, in 1752 the name day of the katun (4 Ahau) fell on the second day of the Mayan year. The Itza sun priests, who were due to be obsolete in 1797 (the end of 13 Ahau), figured out that by redesigning the katun as a period of 24 habs instead of 20 tuns the initiation of future katuns would always fall on the second day of the year. But, if they also converted the may into a cycle of 24 new \"katuns\" of 24 years each, they (or their descendants) could remain in office until 2088! They therefore inaugurated katun 4 Ahau in Valladolid on the 24-hab basis, ending it in 1776. All dates in the Tizimin and Chumayel subsequent to 1752 are given"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"12 INTRODUCTION in the Valladolid calendar. In the Chumayel, however, it occurred to some clever and overzealous copyist to apply the system retroactively, thus making rather a hash of various post-Classic and early colonial dates. Fortunately, it is a hash that can be unscrambled. During the relevant period, the discrepancies between the Valladolid (V) and Mayapan (M) calendars were as follows. V M Difference 49 years 45 years 40 years 36 years 32 years 27 years 23 years 8 Ahau began 6 Ahau began 4 Ahau began 2 Ahau began 13 Ahau began 11 Ahau began 9 Ahau began 1392 1416 1440 1464 1488 1512 1536 1441 1461 1480 1500 1520 1539 1559 Thus our scribe refers to 8 Ahau as beginning 151 years before 1543 (line 2722: 49 years off); he dates Francisco de Montejo's landing at Ecab in 1526 to 11 Ahau (line 2676: 32 years off) and Montejo the Nephew's land-ing at Campeche in 1540 to 1513 (line 2705: 27 years off); and he places the coming of Christianity in 1546 at 1519 (lines 365, 2722: 27 years off). Even his mistakes are systematic. Somehow getting the impression that he was in 9 Ahau and expressing the correct Mayapan date of 1518, he ap-plies the 23-year correction for 9 Ahau but applies it backward—landing 23 years off in 1541 (line 2743)! Well, nobody's perfect. The Año. The Maya thought it very clever of the Spanish to have their own year. They learned it rapidly and found it child's play. By the time Landa got around to asking them (in 1553) when their year began, they were able to give him a deceptively simple but absolutely correct an-swer: Sunday, July 16. The 365-day cycle was nothing new to them, of course, and they figured out how to handle leap years by reckoning them separately. Every Christian leap year day fell in a Mayan year with the yearbearer Ix, and the day 1 Ix initiated the second half of the calendar round in 1555. In the only really direct correlational statement in the Chumayel, written in 1556, it is clear that the July 16 date is pegged to the year 10 Ix, 1551. The true Christian date for any one particular year can thus be reached by adding to July 16 one day for each of the intervening Ix years for dates before 1551 or subtracting them for dates thereafter. The Maya did that in their heads, but they simplified matters by clinging perma-nently to the July 16 correlation of 1551. It was not until the present century that the Europeans generally accepted the Goodman-Martinez-Thompson (GMT) correlation and acknowledged that the Maya were correct (Edmonson 1976). The only direct correlational statement in the Tizimin, in a text writ-ten around 1618 to 1623, also dates the beginning of the Mayan year to July 16 but pegs this not to 1 Ix, the middle of the calendar round, but to 1 Kan, its beginning. This was 1581. But the priest who wrote this must surely have been aware that the true correlational date was half a calendar round (26 years) earlier, including 7 Ix years (from 1 Ix in 1555 to 12 Ix in"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 13 d to some , thus dates. ladolid (V) 1543 (line cab in îw's land-e places years off), ion that 18, he ap--landing ive their etime n, they :t an-;m, of ing them arbearer id in umayel, year 10 Ix, us be ; Ix years he Maya perma-esent artinez-were :xt writ-year to id, but to lis must a calendar :o 12 Ix in 1579 inclusive). All references to the Christian year in the Books are tied to the July 16 date for 1 Pop, the first day of the colonial Mayan year. And that was true only for 1548 to 1551. The sophistication of Mayan chronology and the reliability of their his-tories can be appraised by a parallel sequence of events, reported by the Chumayel and by Landa (Tozzer 1941: 42) as follows. Chumayel Landa 1. 1441 Beginning of 8 Ahau 2. 1451 Fall of Mayapan (Mani) 3. 1484 Sacrifices 4. 1500 Fire 5. 1516 Plague 6. 1536 Murder of Pot Xiu 1. 1441 Fall of Mayapan 2. 1464 Hurricane and fire 3. 1480 Plague 4. 1496 War 5. 1516 Plague 6. 1566 Landa's Relación Mai The Chumayel dates events 3, 4, and 5 only to the nearest katun, though it dates event 6 to the day. Landa dates backward from the year in which he was writing—in Spain in 1566. Thus he estimates event 5 at 50 years earlier than 6, 4 at 20 years before that, 3 another 16, 2 yet another 16, and 1 another 23 years before, totaling 125 years. Accepting Landa's estimate that a plague occurred 50 years before he wrote, we find confirmation in the Chumayel: there was a plague in 1516 or, at least, in 2 Ahau. Landa's second plague, his event 5, is simply an illusion. The 20-year interval between the 1516 plague and war in 1536 is confirmed by Chumayel event 6, as is the fire 16 years before the plague there, which could have occurred in 1500, the first year of 2 Ahau. The Chumayel doesn't mention the hurricane. Chumayel event 3 has been in-cluded because other translators have considered ma ya cimlal to be a plague. I don't think so [vide supra), and in any case it is out of order. The exact year of Chumayel event 2 actually comes from the Mani. Landa's event 1 can only be construed as an estimate of the beginning of 8 Ahau: right katun, wrong year for the fall of Mayapan. Landa's total of 125 years is fundamentally correct, and so are most of his intervals, but I conclude that, while Mayan sources are sometimes less precise, they are more credible. The Julian Calendar. All the European dates in the Chumayel are in the Julian calendar. Despite the promulgation of the Gregorian calendar by the pope in 1582, the Maya clung to the Julian one throughout. In the six-teenth and seventeenth centuries, the Gregorian calendar added 10 days to Julian dates (in the eighteenth it added 11, and in the twentieth 12). It was only in some late marginal notes of the middle nineteenth century that the Maya began using Gregorian dates. Since the Gregorian reform was accepted immediately in the Spanish world (as opposed to the later eighteenth century in the English one), this is an interesting documenta-tion of the autonomy of Mayan calendrical thought. The Semana. The Mayan reaction to the 7-day week merits special com-ment. They realized promptly that the days of the Spanish week acted as yearbearers, constituting (leap years ignored) a 7-year cycle. (That is, the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"14 INTRODUCTION 365-day year contains 52 weeks plus 1 day.) Eventually they figured out that because of leap year these Christian \"yearbearers\" occur in cycles of 4, and it takes 28 years before any particular 4-year set will be repeated. The numbers 4 and 7 were already important in Mayan numerology, so they comfortably added the weekdays and their planetary associations to the native cosmology and used them for divination. The Arts The Chumayel contains numerous direct allusions to dance, music, and architecture (see the index) and indirect references to painting and sculp-ture. Sometimes these allusions are quite graphic—particular artifacts are named; colors are specified; everyday objects are given metaphorical sig-nificance, (loincloths, drums, lances, plates, ropes, et al.). While the pri-mary emphasis is placed on literature, philosophy, and history, which are closely tied to religion, all the Mayan arts are intimately related to the calendar, from poetry to dress and from ideology to cuisine. Cuisine. Let us begin with the least verbal of the arts: cookery. Modern Yucatecan cuisine is regionally distinctive and delicious. It appears to have been no less so in the seventeenth century. Poultry (turkey, curassow, quail) was baked, steamed, roasted, broiled, and stewed. Various saltwater and freshwater fish, crab, conch, and turtle were cooked. There was plenty of game (deer, agouti, armadillo, peccary, paca, iguana), and it too was well prepared. (Scent glands were a problem with paca, armadillo, and agouti, but properly treated they are delicious fare, and roasted iguana tail was a delicacy.) Sauces, colorful and savory, were oriented to the four directions: red (add red chile or achiote), white (how about pollo en atole7.), black (stew it with ground charred chile—an acquired taste), yellow (you can do marvelous things with fresh corn, which itself came in several colors), or even green (\"greens\" attained ceremonial significance on the basis of fresh green chiles and a number of local leafy vegetables). The Mayan dedica-tion to bees and their honey led to a number of sweet sauces. They made underground ovens [pib] for true barbecuing, and polio pibil is a standard modern result in the regional restaurants. Mayan vegetables were a national treasure rather than a mere resource. Honeyed baked yams? Stuffed cabbage? Lima bean soup? Cassava? How do you want your squash—baked, stewed, roasted—or would you prefer fried squash flowers? Or (again this is on modern menus) how about huevos motuleños—a tortilla with tomatoes, cooked vegetables, refried beans, cheese, and a fried egg on top? Or papadzules—a hard-boiled egg wrapped in a soft tortilla with a delicate tomato sauce flavored with ground amaranth and pumpkin seeds? Baked fresh corn? Bean soup? Stewed pumpkin? And, if you are Aztec enough to want your food spic-ier, try x ni pek 'dog's nose', hot chiles in a fresh tomato sauce. A variety of native fruits added to the menu: mamey, fig, nance, custard apple, melon. Well, have a cigar and another cup of mead or a gourd of chocolate. Most of these foodstuffs are referred to in the Chumayel, par-ticularly in relation to the ceremonial examination of the lords, which 1."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 15 red out cycles of ipeated. ogy, so lations isic, and ad sculp-tifacts are rical sig-the pri-vhich are to the .

In the welter of titles, gods, metaphors, personal names, puns, riddles, kennings, and ritual in the Chumayel, it is important to be able to identify a real place-name when one occurs. Many of the glamour names that color Mayan religion and literature also adorn the landscape of Yucatan. As in most systems of toponymy, Mayan place-names make use of a number of classifiers emphasizing location and the kinds of locations that are of particular interest. These include at {chi, ti), in (ich), front (tan), back (pach), right [noh), left [tz'ic), between [xol), inside [tu y ol), below [horn), above [ok), near (nak), east [lakin), north [xaman), west [chikin), south (nohol), and country (peten). Among the natural features that are emphasized are water (a, ha), land (luum), hole [hoi], hill (uitz, puuc), island (oy), cenote (tz'onot, ch'een), cave (kop), forest (kax), shore (pay), sea (kaknab), sand (zuz), swamp (putun), tree (che), stone (tun), spring (ak, zayab), and the names of an al-most indefinite number of plants (e.g., nicte 'flower') and animals (e.g., balam 'jaguar'), as well as features of human origin: pyramid (eb), house (na), mound (mul), mask (koh), field (col), oven (pib), painting or writing (tz'ib, bon), settlement (cah), gate (hoi tun), and wall (paa, tulum). A more problematic usage in Yucatec is the incorporation of numerals into place-names: Hunuc Ma, Caucel, Ox Cum, Can Ul, Ti Ho, Uuc y Ab Nal, Uaxac Tun, Bolon Te Uitz, Lahun Chable, Oxlahun Zuyua. This usage seems to be confined to the first thirteen numerals and presumably had calendrical significance, but I don't know what it was. Larger nu-merals were occasionally used in place-names, apparently as metaphoric status claims (kal, pic, bak). A number of special usages distinguished the rank of cities of real importance, rather in the manner of the Spanish hier-archy (rancho, ranchería, cantón, paraje, congregación, pueblo, villa, villa real, ciudad, capital, metrópoli, etc.). The Spanish carried this sort of thing pretty far—and so did the Maya. Compare Nuestra muy Noble y muy Leal Ciudad de Santiago de los Caballeros de Antigua de Guatemala and Tan Tun, Tan Cah, ich Caan Ziy Ho, u Hetz' Katun, May Cu, May-apan, Yax Che, Zac Lac Tun 'the first stone, the first town, in heaven born Five, seat of the katun, seat of the cycle, rthe cycle well, the first tree, the Plaza', which was Merida in Maya, at least for a time. Names of small villages are commonly introduced by ix 'little', and sometimes a certain wry humor surfaces, as in Muxu P'ip' 'bursting at the seams', Zahab Balam 'spooked jaguar', or Tz'ooc 'the end'. There is a gen-eral preoccupation with water (a, ha, ch'en, tz'onot, ak, zayab) in the place-names, understandable enough in view of Yucatan's total lack of streams and the natural beauty of its underground water sources. The towns and villages are referred to poetically through their water sources as \"the wells and springs,\" which were considered sacred. Only rarely and coincidentally are calendrical names applied to places. Time was of course on the roads, and places were merely way stations on the journey of the sun. Yucatan was divided into eighteen provinces at the time of the Spanish"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"î6 INTRODUCTION conquest, though only some of them are mentioned in the Chumayel: Chakan, Chikin Ch'el, Cozumel, Ecab, Uaymil, Tutul Xiu, and Chable. It can hardly be coincidental that the number of provinces matches the number of uinals in the tun, but this fact does not appear to be particu-larly stressed. The Maya called Yucatan the Ordered Country, the Land of the Ceiba, or the Four-Part Country (the fifth part was the center). The ex-pression Cycle Country [mayab], which occurs elsewhere, does not ap-pear in the Books, nor does the expression Land of the Deer and Pheasant. If my surmise that there were 13 numeral prefixes for cities is correct, all the major cycles of the calendar (4, 5, 13, and 18) may have been projected onto Mayan geography. It is not clear how 7, 9, and 20 figured in, but they must have been involved somehow terrestrially as they were cosmologi-cally. After all, Yucatan was the Ordered Country [tzol peten). The place-names mentioned in the Chumayel are listed in the index, and a ritual gazetteer of 171 of them will be found in chapter 12 and appendix B. Onomastics. The Yucatecans do not appear to have used the naming system, based on the uinal, that was employed throughout Middle Amer-ica to name individuals. They knew about it, of course, but the only example in the Chumayel is Nahuat: Five Flower. This appears in both Nahuat and Maya (Macuilxuchit, Ho Nicte), but Flower is not a day name in Maya. The naming of persons in Yucatan was almost entirely a matter of lineage. A proper name in Maya was always binary: it was composed of a ma-ternal patronymic and a paternal one, in that order. Thus Yax Chuen's mother's father was a Yax and his father was a Chuen. Patrilineages were the basic units of Mayan society, and they were rigidly exogamous. If Yax Chuen's wife were Ek Balam, their children would be named Balam Chuen. They would be eligible to marry someone named Yax Ek or Ek Yax, in-cluding their first cross-cousins, but they could not marry a Chuen or a Balam. Sometimes the name was preceded by the word Na 'mother', as in Na Tzin Yabun, but that was not mandatory. It may indicate cases in which the maternal patrilineage had higher status. Having all one's siblings running around with the same name presented obvious problems. These were solved by adding titles, usually prefixed, and nicknames, usually suffixed, as in Ah Kin Na Ahau Pech Chan 'the sun priest (mother) lord tick the younger' (the example is a hypothetical composite) or Uayom Ch'ich' Chich 'sleeping bird the strong' (lines 695-696). Sometimes the order of elements was inverted, as in Kin Ich Kak Mo 'sun face fire macaw' or Kukul Can Ah Nacxit 'quetzal snake priest of Four Leg'. Proper names were sometimes inflected, particularly the mater-nal patronymic, taking the suffix -VI or -il, as in Yaxal Chac, Kukul Can, or Ulil Ahau. This may have been primarily for euphony and clarity of enunciation. A number of the 150 to 200 recorded lineage names were common to the Xiu and the Itza: Ahau, Amayte, Ay, Chac, Coc, Itzam, Kak, Kau, Mo, Puc, Zac. Others were not. The Xiu frequently had Nahuat names:"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"w^ INTRODUCTION 17 nayel: Chable. hes the particu-le Land of ;r).

The Itza did not. A number of the lin-eage names were calendrical—general: Ahau, Yax, Zac; Itza: Balam, Can, Ceh, Chuen, Hun, Ik, Kin, Lahun, Mac, Tun, Uac, Uuc, Zip; Xiu: Acat, Callan, Cuat, Ho, Itzti, Thul, Xuchit. Animals and plants figure promi-nently. In addition to those already named, we find Buzzard [kuch], Puma [cob], Quetzal [kuk], Squirrel [cue], Possum [och], Snail (ul), Corn Ear (nal), Yam (iz), Annona [op], Bird [ch'ich'], and many others. Body parts also occur: Ich 'eye', Chi 'mouth', Ol 'heart', Mex 'whisker', Chan 'molar'. With the Spanish conquest the baptized Indians received Christian names: Antonio, Lorenzo, Martin, etc. Few of these are cited in the Chu-mayel, which is after all dedicated to the preservation of the Mayan tra-dition. By the early eighteenth century, the naming system and the asso-ciated matrimonial rules of the preconquest Maya had become more or less dead letters. But many, perhaps even most, of the traditional lineage names have survived into modern times. It is of interest to note that the Maya did not apply their own naming system to the gods. A few gods received binary names—Muzen Cab, Kak Mo, and Itzam Na, and perhaps Tenel Ahau, Kukul Can, Cab Ain, and Ahau Can, and just maybe Ix Chel, Ix Tab, and Ah Puch'. The Maya may have been skeptical about the gods' ability to abide by the rules of ex-ogamy, or they may have had other reasons, but they do not appear to have worked out the genealogy of the gods. They knew where they and the gods were in time, and that was enough. The Maya identified themselves the way they identified everything else: in couplets. A profound dualism is intrinsic to Mayan discourse, both formal and informal, but it becomes coercive in formal speech. A Mayan noble \"born and engendered\" who knew his ancestry on both sides of the family was eligible to become ahal ach uinic, a 'true virile man', a ruler. There is a dialectic to procreation. The Maya felt it keenly, and they expressed this awareness not only in their identification of themselves but in the poetry of their formal speech and writing. Like all other expres-sions of the Mayan soul, the Chumayel is entirely composed in couplets. Poetry. The couplets of Mayan formal discourse and poetry are primarily semantic. In some cases they are emphasized by syntactic parallelism. A - • frequently repeated couplet is: Hulom kuk Ulom yaxum Come is the quetzal; Come is the blue bird, (lines 425-426) Here the root verbs huul and ul are synonyms for 'arrive', identically in-flected and followed by two nouns of closely similar meaning. This is not, however, a poetic rule: Ci uinal Çihci kin u kaba The month was born And the day name was born, (lines 2041-2042) JL"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"i8 INTRODUCTION A perfectly strong couplet may be made without any syntactic parallelism: Yax coc ay mut U u ich ti y ahaulil The center priest Coc Ay the Crier Was the face in the lordship, (lines 1769-1770) Often the scansion of a weak couplet appears to be coerced by surround-ing strong ones: T u nohochil  For the great, T u chanchanil  For the very small. Minan to nohoch can  There may be no great teacher Ti u hach çatal  Who can really forgive Caan   Heaven   Y etel luum ti ob i  And earth for them, (lines 2541-2546) As in the last line here, the deictic particles e and i are phrase or sentence terminals and are often helpful in tracing syntax and hence scansion. That the problematic middle couplet in this passage is correctly scanned is confirmed by the parallelism of nohoch 'great' and hach 'really, very' (both nouns in Maya), and it may be that there is more of a relationship between 'teach' and 'forgive' than my translation suggests. The opening lines of \"The First Chronicle\" present a similar case: Ukahlay U xocan katunob uchc i U chictahal u chi ch'een ytza U chi lae The account Of the counted katuns Of the appearance of the Chichen Itza Says this, (lines 1-4) The first couplet is strong and obvious. The second is something of a pun on chi 'mouth', which is poetically related to 'face' and hence to appear-ance. It is thus both formally linked to the 'mouth of the well of the Itza' and semantically aligned with the preceding verb. There are strong couplets and weak couplets, but I do not believe that any part of the Chumayel is composed in \"prose.\" Scansion problems are often produced by copyists' errors and omissions. I have tried to indicate these and, sometimes, to supply the latter. I remain uncertain about the proper scansion of vocatives (\"O Fathers\") or direct discourse (\"he said\"), and I have tried to fit my treatment of them to the context, with resulting inconsistencies. Note also the problem of \"Zuyua\" in chapter 30. Scansion of Mayan poetry is totally dependent upon semantics, and, while other linguistic clues may be provided, they do not have to be (see Burns 1980). The linkage between the lines is dependent upon a degree of synonymy or antinomy between two or more key words, but they may even be different parts of speech, provided that they are linked by meaning:"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"tpï*-/ the Crier dship. urround-acher mes r sentence sion.

(lines 29-30) 19 Here a locational verb is keyed to a locational noun. Or again: They were removed there At Babylonia, (lines 1417-1418) The keys are a locational particle and a locational noun. When the key to a couplet is a pun, it obviously cannot be translated satisfactorily. Couplets of this sort are explained in the notes when I un-derstood them. A similar problem is presented by kennings, more or less esoteric symbolic meanings superimposed on everyday words. A number of these are explained in the two chapters on riddles (30 and 31). Many more can be decoded by context. I have largely kept to a literal transla-tion, so the reader will just have to learn that sun means beginning and moon means end, that monkeys : peasants, older brothers : nobles or Spaniards depending on the context, sprinkle. : baptize, stalk : lineage, mat : authority, red : east, green : center, and the bearer of land : its owner. A partial dictionary is provided in the index under \"kennings.\" Key words of the couplets are frequently kennings, and thus when com-bined they may imply a third meaning quite different from the literal meaning of the elements. Thus wells and springs means settlements, sticks and stones or rope and cord : war, born and engendered : noble, fa-therless and motherless : poor peasants, older and younger brothers : everybody, gourdroot and breadnut : famine, food and water : fate, shot and shout : soon, pants and sandals : religion. A partial list of these is also provided in the index under \"couplets.\" The Chumayel makes extensive use of all manner of poetical and rhe-torical devices, from the metaphor conceiving Yucatan as a bird with one wingtip in Campeche and the other in Valladolid to the humorous riddle likening the church to a leaky cenote because it's always dripping on people. It makes extensive use of puns and riddles (see \"pun,\" \"riddle,\" \"metaphor\" in the index). It is fond of euphemisms, referring to sacrifice as \"painless death\" and to Spaniards by a whole series of circumlocutory expressions: foreigners, bearded ones, conquerors, annona simpers, older brothers, oppressors, people of the eastern land, sons of the sun, white • people, red beards. The Chumayel uses hyperbole: \"Indeed the Itza could come here three times over for one occurrence of (Spaniards)\" (lines 2899-2900). And it is capable of ironic meiosis, referring to the climactic katun 8 Ahau as \"tiny little 8 Ahau\" (line 1234). Our text asks rhetorical questions: \"Who will be the prophet, who will be the sun priest who will correctly interpret the word of these glyphs?\" (lines 625-628; the clearly implied answer is, \"I shall\"). It uses personifi-cation: \"Here I am, I, katun 3 Ahau, who have seated my city, Heaven Born Merida!\" (lines 2951-2954). Many of the tropes are standardized, and some of them descend to being clichés, as in the obligatory reference to \"the lying earth,\" at least in Christianized contexts. Lies and insanity are a standard accusation against enemies. 1^"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"20 INTRODUCTION There is a strong polarization by rank and favor in these texts. Insults abound—since the text is Xiu, the Itza are often characterized as lying, stupid, stuttering orphans and insane fly-by-night (two-day and three-day] lords, drunken buzzards, monkeys and dogs, oversexed, lustful, and ad-dicted to sodomy. The Itza of course reciprocate in kind. When they are really aroused, the Maya produce slang curses that sound almost like GI Joe: \"This asshole boils war!\" Correspondingly, the language of deference is considerably elaborated, and there are many standard honorifics: father, older brother, honorable, remote or holy, heaven born, glorious (sun face), great (seventh, ninth, thirteenth), or tremendous [chac). Even more poetic effects are found occasionally, as in the anaphoric rep-etition and climax of the following: There appeared the moon; The moon left. It returned, And the moon of the moon occurred, (lines 669-672) There is sometimes a deft use of chiasmus: Shaped by the juice of heaven: By dew of heaven shaped, (lines 1703-1704) Allegory is also to be found, as in the myth of the origin of the Xiu as a consequence of Hummingbird's sipping the nectar of the flowers, alluded to following line 3324. Although the entire text of the Chumayel is poetic, it appears to be spe-cifically lyric in only a few passages: \"The Song of the Itza\" in chapter 42 and the elegant introit to \"The Count of the Katuns\" in chapter 17. Sec-tions of the myth \"The Birth of the Uinal\" in chapter 20 attain a similar lyricism. At least the first two of these fully qualify as poems. Drama. Drama is fundamental to our text. There is a great deal of pre-occupation with ritual throughout the work—with the Christian sacra-ments (baptism, marriage, burial) and rites (absolution, benediction, kneel-ing, repentance, mourning, sermons, prayer, praise, anointing with oil, the sign of the cross) as well as Mayan ceremonials (of the uinal, the tzol kin, the tun, the hah, the katun, the may, the baktun) and ceremonies (sacrifice, divination, curing, examination, request, pacing and seating of land, commemoration). It is curious that there is no specific reference to the eucharist among the Christian rites or to confession, which is promi-nent in both Catholic and Mayan religions. Perhaps the emphasis on the rite of forgiveness is intended to refer to the latter. The ceremonials of the Maya are largely tied to the cycles of the calen-dar. The principal tzol kin ceremonies were those of the Burner [ah toe) cycle of the quarter tzol kin. These were held on certain occurrences of the days Chicchan, Oc, Men, and Ahau, and they survive as the tup' kak 'quenching fire' ceremonies described by Villa Rojas (1945: 79, 116). In each quarter tzo7 kin there was a cycle of fire ceremonies; thus on 3 Chic-chan the Burner \"took his fire,\" on 10 Chicchan he lit it, on 4 Chicchan his fire \"dawned,\" and on 11 Chicchan it was extinguished.

In ; on 3 Chic-¿3tiechan e cycle was then repeated for the other Burner days. The Tizimin account is fuller than that of the Chumayel, but neither describes the actual ritual. Since they are pegged to the tzol kin, these ceremonies are movable feasts in re-lation to those of the hab. Uinal ceremonies are not described in the Chumayel, though there are scattered references to the major gods in whose honor such ceremonies were held. By implication, these allusions fairly well blanket the eighteen uinals of the tun (see table 3 below). Tun ceremonies are primarily linked to those of the katun. They are not described in the Chumayel either, though there are some references to them, particularly to the ho tun (quarter katun), lahun tun (half katun), and ho lahun tun (three-quarter katun) ceremonies. The half katun is particularly emphasized. It is identified with 11 Ch'ab Tan, the installa-tion of the Jaguar designate, and the notion of the \"remainder\" of the katun. All ritual has some elements of the dramatic, but the complex rituals of the katun, the may,.and the baktun incorporated numerologically sig-nificant ceremonies (thirteen for the katun and the may, twenty for the baktun), and some of these escape the confines of ritual to become true drama. All the katun histories (chapters 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 16, 18, 19, 22, 25, 26, 28, 33, 35, 36, 38, 40, 45) contain allusions to the katun ritual, and, despite the fact that their content is historical, the references to music, incense, ceremonial insignia, fire, riddling, penance, masks, costume, and the like make it clear that this is ritual drama. Four of the chapters of the Chumayel give more or less detailed descrip-tions of major Mayan ceremonials: the ceremonial of the may (chapters 12 and 46), the ceremonial of the baktun (chapter 29), and the ceremonial of the hab (chapter 15). That these are in fact ceremonials and in spots ceremonial drama is demonstrated by the distinction drawn between the characters portrayed and the actors portraying them (e.g., line 3389), by stage directions and explanations of symbolism (e.g., lines 3120-3121), by details of costuming, paraphernalia, props, masks, music, and some-times directly quoted dialogue (lines 6391 ff.). There is reference to the impersonation of the gods (line 3150) as well as of historical figures (lines 1179-1180). The choice of historical and mythological elements was no doubt dic-tated at least in part by calendrical considerations, but the fact that there was a choice separates many of the Mayan ceremonies from the mechan-ical repetition of ritual acts. Historical and mythological events were reenacted and comedies were performed. The ceremonial of the katun is mentioned frequently but is nowhere directly described. It appears to have been patterned rather strictly on the ceremonial of the may (chapter 12), a drama in thirteen acts, and all of the eighteen katun histories refer to anywhere from two to twelve of these acts in more or less recognizable form and always in the same order. For reasons that will become clear below, I prefer to number the acts from 8 to 20 rather than from 1 to 13. They may be reconstructed as follows. Act 8. Ceremonial Circuit. This seems to be implied in various other JL-"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"22 INTRODUCTION passages but is not mentioned in the katun histories. It may have ended in a balche ceremony. Act 9. Seating of the Katun. This is the main point of the ritual. The new Jaguar Priest, dressed in robes of jaguar and rattlesnake skin and with his face tied (i.e., masked), having been ceremonially designated ten years before, took his place on the throne and mat of the katun in the cycle seat (Merida for the Xiu, Mayapan for the Itza). Act 10. Seating of the Yearbearers. These were local priests; each city had its own set of four, each identified with and by a direction color. They were probably thought to represent not only the years but also the gods of death, wind, sun, rain, and fire. The \"high fan\" may have been part of their paraphernalia. Act 11. Pacing of the Katun. This was a ceremonial procession of seven priests, the Pacers (uuc taz cab), with a surveying stick [p'iz te), who ritu-ally confirmed land-titles. The corresponding references in the katun his-tories are to settling, tying, bearing, dividing, and measuring the land, as well as to payment of tribute. Act 12. Dawn. This was the moment for the counting (ranking) of the mats (of the lords) and for accepting \"requests,\" that is, applications for future offices. This was in many respects the most political moment of the drama, since what was at stake were not only the priesthoods but also the positions of governor (hal ach uinic) and \"fathers of the rope\" [ba tabob) of the subject towns and cities. A declaration of candidacy in this ceremonial context was like the ritual of nomination at a national con-vention in the United States, and the ceremonial recognition mattered. Act 13. Sacrifice. In the katun histories the references to sacrifice are euphemistic and elliptical. They are a little more explicit elsewhere. The heart sacrifice (\"painless death\"), the arrow sacrifice, hanging, burning, and drowning were the principal forms, but often the only reference is to the accompanying music: the drum and rattle of the katun. Act 14. Examination. The examination ceremony was always accompa-nied by a feast at which aspirants to lordship were tested by ritual riddles (chapters 30 and 31). Naturally most of these concerned food, but exami-nations are also referred to in the katun histories in more or less riddle form: the food and water of the katun, its speech, judgment, and \"face.\" Act 15. The Word. The general character and fate of the katun are al-ways given in the katun histories, usually in a terse riddle, metaphor, kenning, or keyed couplet: shield and arrow, lying and crazy, quetzal and blue bird, gods, sticks and stones, hanging, church, war, full swollen, lo-cust, cord and rope, feast and famine. This was presumably announced by the new Spokesman of the Jaguar. Act 16. Penance. References in the katun prophecies to work, hunger, poverty, sins, burning, need, and lamentation normally follow the imagery of act 15. There is also reference to the gourd, bowl, and cup of the katun. I believe that all this refers to the continence, fasting, and bloodletting ex-pected of the lords and that this was the point at which they collected their own blood in bowls and offered it to the gods.

Act 17. Commemoration (natabal). In Classic times this was certainly the moment for the erection and/or unveiling of a carved stone monu-ment. There are fleeting suggestions that a wooden pole may have been substituted in post-Classic and colonial times. Eventually the substitute was the cross. In the ritual drama, a substantive bit of history was intro-duced, evoking calendrically significant bits of past history. There are ref-erences in the katun histories to writing, dating stones, and origin myths at this point. Act 18. Counting. All the katun histories down to 12 Ahau (1658) refer explicitly to the counting of the katun. Only two put this reference into what appears to be the correct order of the katun ceremony. The others mention it at the outset. Act 19. Farce. Comic relief was offered in the penultimate act of the cer-emonial. This took the form of a morality play focused upon such charac-ters as Desire and Suffering, Thief and Official, Sin and Blame, Lust, or even contemporary characters like those representing the military orders (Fox and Earth Lion). The suggestion is strong from other passages that the humor of these farces was broad. The characters were deformed, with \"bent necks\"; they drooled; they burlesqued the sins they represented. Act 20. Sermon. The sermon of the katun was normally delivered by a prophet [ah bobat), but the official prophet of the katun was the Spokes-man of the Jaguar. Sermons of the katun constitute chapters 7, 9, 10, 13, 21, 34, and 46, and two more are incorporated into chapters 19 and 29. All the katun histories from 8 Ahau to 10 Ahau (1441-1677) include at least references to the content of the sermon: war, Christianity, God, etc. It appears that the acts of the ceremonial of the katun did not have equal weight to the Maya and that the most important were act 9 (seat-ing), act 15 (the word), and act 20 (the sermon). The ceremonial of the hab, a ten-day program of activities that began on the first day of Uayeb and extended five days into the new year, is the subject of chapter 15. This is an interesting ritual text clearly organized around the four directions, though it appears to be somewhat garbled here and there. It lists the circuit of the directions counterclockwise six times, associating'the directions with (1) a lineage and a lineage head, (2) ten kinds of ritual insignia, (3) a stopping place, (4) four counselors, (5) three more insignia, and (6) a katun keeper. Each direction is also associated with a color. The structure of the ritual is given in table 1. It is of interest to note that the items of insignia total thirteen and that the total number of associations is eighteen. Various symbolic substitu-tions in them are reminiscent of the ritual riddles. The lists of insignia are apparently both incomplete and out of order, as though this text were being dictated or composed by memory from oral tradition. The whole passage is explicitly dated to 11 Ahau (1539). The ceremonial of the kin tun y abil was held at fifty-two-year, intervals to mark the completion and reinauguration of the calendar round.

As with the ceremonial of the katun, which appears to have been modeled on that of the may, the Oc Na was probably an expanded version of the annual ceremonial of the hab. Landa (Tozzer 1941: 161) says in fact that it was held annually but I believe that to be a mistake. (A half-calendar round ceremony was due in 1555.) In its full form it was supposed to involve the rebuilding of the temple in which it was held, and it is always mentioned in connection with sacrifices. We have no explicit description of it. It would be logical to present the ceremonial of the may next. As a matter of exposition, however, I believe I can make the matter clearer if I move on to the ceremonial of the baktun and then return to the may. The ceremonial of the baktun, chapter 29 of the Chumayel, is a de-tailed description of the katun ceremonies at Merida at the beginning of 3 Ahau in 1618. But, because eighty days after the beginning of this katun was the end of an even baktun, 12.0.0.0.0 (the end of 5 Ahau in the Tikal calendar), the occasion was celebrated with a ritual extravaganza: a cere-monial drama in twenty acts.

The previ-f ore that INTRODUCTION 25 was in 830; the next one is not scheduled until the twenty-first century. The occasion provides us with a kind of ritual key to the whole meaning of the Books of Chilam Balam and to the theology and mysticism they reflect and reproduce. The component ceremonies were as follows. Act 1. Mead. The balche ceremony, involving at least three days for the preparation of the mead, made from cooked and fermented honey and the bark of the balche tree, has been described by Redfield and Villa Rojas (1934) and by Tozzer (1907) among the Lacandon. Act 2. Tying. The bee god ties the faces of (i.e., masks) the 13 gods. The identity of the impersonators of these gods was supposed to be secret, so this may have been done in private. According to the Tizimin they were named Puzlum Pach 'hunchback', Thuchlum Ich 'squatface', Naclah Muyal 'rising storm', Naclah Uitz 'rising mountain', Chuclum Tz'iitz' 'sooty hoof, HubuLHub isinking snail', Cotz' y Ol Ch'elem 'rolling agave heart', Etz'el Etz*-'placing fakes', Ox Tz'alab u Nak Yax Che 'three squeezed in the belly of the ceiba', Cuchlahom y Al Max 'carrying baby monkey', Ox Ch'uilah Xotem 'thrice hanged', Pan Tzintzin 'old bugger', and Ban Hob 'many guts'. Act 3. Cycle Ending. The 9 Gods fight with, conquer, and sacrifice the 13 Gods, thus symbolizing the end of the thirteen-katun cycle: night con-quers day. The Tizimin gives the names of the 9 Gods: Hau Nab 'slice point', Hutz' Nab 'split point', Kuk Nab 'quetzal point', Oyal Nicte 'is-land flower', Ninich Cacau 'wormy cacao', Chabi Tok 'digging knife', Ma-cuilxochit 'five flower', Hobon y Ol Nicte 'colored flower heart', and Kouol y Ol Nicte 'pouched flower heart'. The Chumayel lists the 9 Gods among the 18 Flower lords under slightly different names. Act 4. Yearbearer. The 4 Yearbearers appear in the guise of the 4 Burners soot heads'. Some kind of fire ritual may be implied. Act 5. Bird. Quetzal and Hummingbird appear, representing the ances-try of the Itza and the Xiu, respectively. They bring offerings. Act 6. Heart. There is a procession, followed by the heart sacrifice on the pyramid. In this instance the sacrifice is symbolic: hearts of plants are substituted for human ones. Act 7. Rain. The 4 Yearbearers reappear, this time with, or in the guise of, the 4 Chacs. (They are also called Ba Cabs here.) They produce a rain-storm. There may be an implication that this symbolizes baptism, which has conquered the country and is the path of the future. Act 8. Circuit. There is then a ritual circuit to the four directions, each of the yearbearers carrying an alligator (Imix) tree of the appropriate direc-tional color. This procession is said to symbolize the subjugation of the lands in all directions. A fifth priest, presumably the Center priest, carries his green tree to the center of the plaza. The procession was probably more complex than advertised. It almost certainly included the retiring Jaguar Priest and his Spokesman, the Jaguar designate and his Spokesman, the previously mentioned characters of the drama (the bee god, the 9 Gods, Quetzal, and Hummingbird), and probably other important lords, priests, and officials. Act 9. Seating of the Katun. The retiring Jaguar now divests himself of"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"26 INTRODUCTION !«-his regalia—his mask, robe, staff, crown, fan, cask, cup, bowl, plate, bur-den, and probably other paraphernalia as well—and the new Jaguar is seated, suitably accoutred, on his mat and throne. (The throne must cer-tainly have been a stone bench, and the mat on it was a necessity for com-fort. Quiche lords got pillows, too.) Presumably the Jaguar's Spokesman was similarly invested, but nowhere is there any indication of how he was dressed or equipped. Act 10. Yearbearer Seating. Since this ceremony was held in 1618, the senior yearbearer was 11 Kan, here identified with the Red Noble. The East and North priests were \"leaders of the foot\"; those of the west and south were \"leaders of the hand,\" a detail not mentioned elsewhere. The yearbearer-seating ceremony is said to \"establish the town,\" and presum-ably everybody else could now sit down, but in the strictest order of rank. Act 11. Pacing. The 7 Pacers [uuc taz cab) now parade, theirsurveying stick [p'iz te) borne on the back of the alligator god. The pacers are else-where identified as the Surveyor [ah p'iz te), the Marker [ah lub te), the Scrubber [ah xuk, who was the Jaguar himself), the Sweeper [ah miz), the Remover [cit ahau), the Wakener [ahel cab), and the Renewer ( tumte ahau). At the end of a katun, all titles to lands and offices weie canceled and renewed. This is the ceremony that did it. The ex officio participation of the Jaguar is thus highly significant. The alligator god, who has the power to destroy the world by earthquakes, demonstrated his beneficence by bringing light, in what must have been an impressive candlelight pro-cession. (Yucatan is outside the earthquake zone in any case.) Act 12. Dawn. The 9 Gods sacrifice the 7 Pacers and count (and rank) the mats. This had the same significance for titles to office that the pre-ceding act had for titles to land. What was involved was an initial (cere-monial) lineup of the candidates for investiture for the coming katun, subject to their satisfactory (ceremonial) demonstration of legitimacy in act 14. No wonder this taxing job was delegated to the impersonators of the gods of the underworld. No wonder either that haggling and trading and envy were involved. Act 13. Sacrifice. The 4 Yearbearers reappear, this time in the guise of the four death gods. Some (symbolic?) sacrifice was doubtless made, but it is discreetly omitted from the text. Human sacrifice was still going on in Yucatan at this date, but in Merida!? Act 14. Examination. The examination ceremony was always accom-panied by a feast. Chapters 30 and 31 provide a pony for the questions and answers expected in \"The Language of.Zuyua.\" Itza or Xiu, every aspirant to nobility had to know the right answers, whatever scandal may have surrounded his birth. The ritual riddles largely concern the feast—and one may well imagine that it was usually memorable, even apart from the spice added by the examination, which must in any case have been largely pro forma. Act 15. The Word. This is also referred to as the news [mut] of the katun. The 9 Gods announce the fate of the katun, phrased as a matter of its food. As usual, the news in this case was bad.

Penance. The yearbearers then perform the bloodletting rite, drawing blood from their tongues, earlobes, or penises. Perhaps other lords did so too, but the text doesn't say so. Act 17. Commemoration (natabal). This is the point at which in former times a katun monument would have been erected or unveiled as a me-morial to the ancestors. Elsewhere there are suggestions of the possible erection of wooden poles or crosses, as seems to be suggested here. This was accompanied by a play within a play, a dramatization of mythology or history or both. In this instance the performance was \"The Birth of the Flowers,\" a reenactment of the origin myth of the Xiu (Flower) lineages. The characters include the 4 Yearbearers (here for some reason called the hoch kom 'empty pits'), the 13 Gods, and Flower (nicte), the mother of the Flowers. Together these make up the 18 Flowers, symbolizing the uinals of the tun. The nineteenth-character is Hummingbird [tz'unun), who is thus in the structural position of Uayeb. This completes the sym-bolization of the year and the calendar round (4 x 13 x 365) as well as the tun. At the same time, the drama reenacts the myth in which Humming-bird engenders the Xiu by descending to suck the nectar of the Flowers. The 9 Gods made up half the Flowers and, together with the 4 Yearbearers, symbolized the 13 Gods. Act 18. Counting. Flower is then seated and, in the counting ceremony, explicates the calendrical structure just described. Act 19. Farce. Another play within a play was performed at this junc-ture, a morality play concerning envy and spite. Lahun Chan acts the part of Envy's wife, and the whole play is one of comic relief: they act crazy, dizzy, furtive, bad, and ignorant. The 9 Gods are also involved. Act 20. Sermon. The lordship has been passed, and what follows is a sermon by the Spokesman of the Jaguar, prophesying the fate of 3 Ahau. It accuses the Itza of being commoners and predicts that one of these tuns they will see the light. God will triumph and, by flood and storm, will bring about redemption through Jesus Christ for all, even the stupid Itza. The ceremonial of the may held in Merida in 1539 is the subject of chapter 12, celebrating the beginning of 11 Ahau. The ritual structure of the ceremonial is entirely parallel in detail to that of the baktun drama, except that the first seven acts are omitted. The 9 Gods, the 13 Gods, and the 18 Flowers are missing, but the 4 Yearbearers are here together with the 7 Pacers, the Jaguars and their Spokesmen, and eighteen characters of the time-of \"The Fall of Mayapan,\" the historical drama which appears in act 17 in place of \"The Birth of the Flowers.\" Chapter 12 begins, in fact, with a synopsis of this drama. Then follow the thirteen acts of the cere-monial of the may. Act 8. Circuit. The text outlines a double counterclockwise circuit of the geography of Yucatan, listing 171 cities, towns, and villages, starting from P'ool on the east coast and winding up in Merida. If, as I suspect, representatives of a substantial number of these were on hand for the fold-ing of the cycle in 11 Ahau, the seating arrangements must have been a pain even for the rank-happy Maya. .**'"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"28 INTRODUCTION Act 9. Seating of the Katun. It appears that seven lords may have been seated: Mutecpul (as Jaguar), Can Ul, Uayom Ch'ich', Nunil, Chable, Hoi Tun Balam, and Yaxum. (At least three of these are characters in \"The Fall of Mayapan\": Can Ul, Uayom Ch'ich', and Chable.) Act 10. Seating the Yearbearers. Five lords are named: Hoi Tun Ake, Zabac Na, Hoi Tun Balam, Pochek Ix Tz'oy (a Xiu from Copo, presumably the Spokesman), and Chac Te. If Pochek Ix Tz'oy was the Spokesman, the other four were presumably the Ba Cabs. Act 11. Pacing. The 7 Pacers appear and survey and seat the lands. Act 12. Dawn. The text doesn't say so, but presumably the mats (lord-ships) were counted; then tribute was collected. Act 13. Sacrifice. This is acted out as a scene from \"The Fall of May-apan,\" the victim being cast as Mex Cue, who was thrown into the cenote of Chichen Itza by Hunac Ceel in 8 Ahau (1451). Cau Ich apparently re-placed Mex Cue as governor of Mayapan at that time. Act 14. Examination. No feast is mentioned but presumably there was one. The examination is rather obliquely referred to, and there is reference to another scene from \"The Fall of Mayapan,\" apparently relating to the birth of Mex Cue. Act 15. The Word. The word of the katun is announced by the imper-sonator of Mex Cue, presumably as a Jaguar of 8 Ahau. Act 16. Penance. There is only a fleeting allusion to suffering, but it comes at the right point and presumably represents the penance of the yearbearers, here played as Mex Cue, Cau Ich, Hunac Ceel, and the sun priest of Coba, all of them real people of 8 Ahau. Act 17. Commemoration. What are commemorated are not only the fall of Mayapan but also the beginning of the calendar round in 1529 (which would have been the time for the induction of the Jaguar designate for the 1539 ceremonial being described here) and an eclipse. Act 18. Counting. The text alludes briefly to the writing of the katun history for 13 Ahau, now ended. Act 19. Farce. In this case the farce is called \"Centipedes and Gnats,\" presumably a burlesque of the pesky military orders. Act 20. Sermon. The text peters out in the midst of dire predictions of war and bloodshed. The ceremonial of the may in chapter 12 is that for 11 Ahau in 1539. Another version is given in more fragmentary form in chapter 46 for the 11 Ahau of 1824. Five of the thirteen acts are-omitted. The circuit (act 8) is probably taken for granted. The seating of the yearbearers (act 10) may be omitted in honor of the impending calendar round celebration, which fell in 1841, later in the same katun. (This is referred to in line 6284.) The pacing (act 11) may have been deferred because land titles were still under negotiation (line 6462). The counting (act 18), like the circuit, is often taken for granted. It is possible that the farce (act 19) is referred to, but out of order (line 6287). The remaining eight acts are alluded to in order as indicated in the translation. The commemoration (act 17) enacts the story of Antonio Martinez, a latter-day prophet who identifies himself"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"1 w^ INTRODUCTION 29 lave been hable, Hoi n \"The Fall n Ake, >resumably ;sman, the ands. ats (lord-of May-the cenote ently re-:here was is reference lg to the e imper-, but it ; of the the sun nly the fall 9 (which ate for the íe katun Gnats/' ctions of in 1539. 6 for the uit(act 8) 110) may •n, which 6284.) The still under s often to, but in order *cts the limself with Jesus Christ and promises the defeat of the French and the king of Havana and the suspension of tribute payments, all this to be achieved in a great sea battle. Aside from the Chumayel, Tizimin, and Mani, Martinez is unknown to history. There are anachronistic references to him in the katun histories for 1 Ahau (1638), and his prophecies seem to be based on even Christian centuries rather than on even cycles of Mayan time. The thirteen-act ceremonials of the may and the katun seem to provide the model for such fragments of Mayan ritual as have survived into the twentieth century (table 3). These include (8) the balche 'mead' ceremony (Redfield and Villa Rojas 1934: 129), (9) the hetz' mek 'seated embrace' ceremony (Redfield and Villa 1934: 188), (10) the cuch 'burden' ceremony (Redfield and Villa 1934: 154), (11) the uklic (or hanlil) col 'dinner of the cornfield' ceremony (Redfield and Villa 1934: 134), (12) the kaan 'ham-mock' ceremony against the winds (informant), ( 13) the cub p'ol 'seating the head' ceremony (Redfield and Villa 1934: 157), (14) the hoi che 'finish the young' firstfruits ceremony (Redfield and Villa 1934: 143), (15) the tup' kak 'quenching fire' ceremony (Villa 1945: 79, 116), (16) the x pa' pul 'little breaking divination' ceremony (informant), (17) the zip 'deer' demon (Redfield and Villa 1934: 117), (18) the xtabay 'hanging woman' demon (Redfield and Villa 1934: 122), (19) the ch'a chaac 'bring rain' cere-mony (Redfield and Villa 1934: 138; Andrews 1961: 79-164), and (20) the ch'uyenil na 'hanging the house' ceremony (Redfield and Villa 1934: 146). A number of the modern Catholic rituals parallel the Mayan structure in a somewhat overlapping fashion. These analogies may be suggested: (8) procesión, (9) novena, (10) día del santo, (11) candelaria, (12) velorio, (13) viernes santo, (14) bautizo, (15) amonestaciones, (16) cuaresma, (17) todos santos, (18) navidad, (19) carnaval, and (20) cruz. It is clear that the ceremonial of the katun and that of the may are ab-breviated thirteen-act versions of the twenty-act ceremonial of the bak-tun. But it is not quite accurate to say that the former simply omit the first seven acts of the latter. It is more likely that the first seven were as-similated into the next seven. Thus the balche ceremony crops up in the circuit (line 803), the tying of masks was presumably incorporated into the /catufl-seating ceremony, cycle ending was probably symbolized in some way in conjunction with the seating of the yearbearers. The offer-ings of act 4 could be moved to act 11 (line 2946), those of act 5 to act 12 (line 426), those of act 6 to act 13, and those of act 7 to act 14 (line 2254). In the reconstructed katun ceremonial there is more than a suggestion that this is in fact what happened. Narrative. The Chumayel contains no narrative tales comparable to \"The Maiden Theodora\" of the Kaua and the Mani. Its narrative is there-fore confined to myth and history. Two of the chapters are myths (chap-ters 20 and 41). Seven are chronicles (1, 2, 3, 14, 24, 27, and 37). One is a collection of brief annalistic notes (44). Eighteen are katun histories (4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 16, 18, 19, 22, 25, 26, 28, 33, 35, 36, 38, 40, and 45). It is a mis-take to call these prophecies (as I have occasionally done myself). They are called kahlay 'account, relation' in Maya and historia in Spanish, and"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"30 INTRODUCTION that is what they are. All these materials are profoundly interwoven with the mystique and ritual of the calendar. They are dated by katuns and are preoccupied with katun ritual, referring frequently to the various acts of the katun cere-monial drama as outlined above. All the katun histories, for example, mention seating (act 9) and the word of the katun (act 15), and most of them give at least a précis of the sermon (act 20). All the earlier katun histories refer to at least four and as many as eight of the thirteen acts of the ceremonial of the katun. This structure disappears rapidly after 1677. None of the histories appears to refer to the first seven acts of the baktun ceremonial. In almost all cases, allusions to the ritual follow the order of the acts in the original may ceremonial of 11 Ahau in 1539. The katun histories may be precisely characterized, then, as ritual his-tory. They are considerably constrained by the expectation that they will convert the real history of each twenty-year period into the language and ritual order of the katun ceremonial. And that they do—often with re-markable economy and elegance. By the same token, this is intentionally esoteric history, and, while the Mayan sun priests had an intensive educa-tion in it, we latter-day scribes are forced to educate ourselves, inevitably somewhat imperfectly. Like our Mayan forebears, we worry a lot about philosophy, specifically about the cosmology and theology that shaped, and were shaped by, the mystique of the katun, the may, and the baktun. Myth. Mayan cosmology formally begins with a characteristic ending: 13.0.0.0.0 4 Ahau 8 Cumku (August 15, 3115 B.C.). The morning after that date was the beginning of the pseudohistorical Mayan calendar. It was also zero. Nothing existed—not even God, according to some ac-counts. There is reason to suppose that this date was the end of the third or possibly even the fourth baktun cycle of 5,200 tuns, implying an even earlier starting date around 20,000 B.C., but even that was merely a mo-ment in a cycle that is bound to repeat itself. The first beginning of every-thing was time itself. This mystery is beautifully expressed in the creation myth \"The Birth of the Uinal,\" which constitutes chapter 20 of the Chumayel. This deli-cate allegory likens the birth of time to the origin of man, a man travel-ing like the heavenly bodies on the road of days, time, sun, and fate [kin), carrying his burden of sin and shame to its inevitable and self-regenerative end. Did man come before woman? No, it was four female relatives of his who discovered time. So much for the rib of Adam. This may be an ex-quisite recognition that women counted time more precisely by the moon (u), as most American Indians did, for a long time before it could be paced (oc) by the sun priest. And for very good reasons: women were naturally more concerned with the approximately lunar cycle of menstruation and with the period of gestation, which seems to have given rise to the (again approximate) cycle of the 260-day tzol kin. What the women discovered in the footprints of Time was sex: the footprint of lah caoc'll Oc, twelve foot, or all of two feet'. After that, men and women traveled together.

No wonder the cycles were self-regenerative. From 12 Oc we move by an impossible calendrical leap to 13 Oc, but Time and his four forbidden female relatives matched their footsteps and traveled together, and \"the month was born and the day name was born, and the sky was born and the earth, the pyramid of water and land, stone and tree.\" This act of generation was incestuous but effective. It produced and named the twenty sacred days of the uinal and the thirteen sacred numbers to count them with, and on the thirteenth day, 13 Night (Akbal) \"took water and moistened the earth and shaped it and made man.\" The world pyramid of the Mayan universe had thirteen levels of heaven • and nine levels of the underworld. The upper world had six levels going up and six coming down, so the seventh level was the highest. The under-world had four steps going down and four coming back up, so the fifth level was the lowest. After counting thirteen days, our father who is God counted the remaining seven and announced, \"13 heaps and 7 heaps make 1.\" One uinal or one uinic {'man, twenty'), it comes to the same thing. As in the Popol Vuh and the Bible, the mechanism of creation was the Word. \"Everything there was not was then spoken in heaven.\" And, having invented speech, God endowed man with it. And men took each other by the hand and stood in the middle of the country and divided it into four parts, designating a god for each. And (line 180) Four-Part Country (can tzucul cab) was what they named it. The God of this creation was our father Dios citbil, God the remote, the holy. He is clearly here (and is elsewhere called) the creator (ah ch'ab). He appears anachronistically under his Spanish name in a number of pas-sages that otherwise seem to antedate the Spanish conquest, so his ap-pearance here in a text that almost surely dates to 9 Ahau ( 1559) is not surprising. Like the triune god of the Spaniards, he unites all other gods in his person, and hence he is referred to as hunab ku 'the unified god'. Religious controversy led to his being called also the True God (habal ku), irrespective of the fact that conceptions of his divinity (diosil, kuil) are subject to variation even when he is being called true. The Mayan concept of divinity was clearly plural as well as singular, and one finds explicit references to kuob 'gods'. Even in reference to the 13 Gods of heaven and the 9 Gods of the underworld, however, a certain linguistic ambiguity is maintained: oxlahun ti ku is literally 'the 13 who are god'. The basic set of Mayan gods was a set of twenty associated with the twenty days of the uinal and seemingly, like them, thought of in year-bearer sets (table 2). One of the gods in each yearbearer set was thought of as quadripartite. These are italicized in the table. Some of the implied associations of the gods with the days are reasonably clear and explicit. Others are pure guesswork. The matter is complicated by the existence of more than one name for a particular god and more than one way of fitting him into the sacred numerology. All the gods listed in the table are at least mentioned in the Chumayel, with the exception of the corn god and Hummingbird."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"32 INTRODUCTION Table 2. Gods of the Uinal Alligator Wind Sun Rattlesnake Fire Death Deer Rope (Hummingbird) Dog Monkey Bee (Corn) [aguar Bird Rainbow Buzzard Flower Rain Lord 1. The alligator god is Itzam Cab Ain, clearly associated with the day Imix and thought of as living in the underworld in the water and causing earthquakes. 2. There were four wind gods, Ikil, clearly associated with the day Ik, with the Type II yearbearers, and with the four directions. This is Kukul Can as Ehecatl. 3. There were four Sun Giants, Pauah Tun, who were thought to hold up the corners of the sky, and there was a sun god, Ku Kin. My relating them to Akbal is a guess, which would associate them with the Type III yearbearers. I believe this is also Kukul Can as Venus. 4. The rattlesnake god, Ahau Can, should perhaps be associated with Chicchan, but I think he got displaced by the fire gods and by his associa-tion with rain (Kukul Can as Tlaloc, Mayan Chac). There were four rain gods, Chacob, who were also the yearbearers after 1539,- the senior one is identified with the day Kan. 5. There were four fire gods called the Burners, Ah Toe, who were asso-ciated with the Type V yearbearers, of which Chicchan is the senior mem-ber. The god of this day is Kak Mo 'fire macaw'. 6. The death god, Ah Puch', is mentioned in the Tizimin and is clearly associated with the day Cimi. This is Kukul Can as Mictlantecuhtli. In the Chumayel there are four death gods, Tenel Ahau, associated with the four directions and with Type I yearbearers. 7. The deer god, Zuhuy Zip, was probably associated with the day Manik, which corresponds to 'deer' in Náhuatl and Quiche. He was also associated with the third uinal of the year, which is also Zip. In modern times he has become a plural set of spirits of the forest, but he is not quadripartite. 8. The rope goddess, Ix Tab, was seemingly the goddess of the hanged. Her association with Lamat is a guess. The similar goddess Ix Q'anil fits here in the Quiche calendar. 9.1 do not find a deity for Muluc, but the ceremonial of the may clearly places Hummingbird, Tz'unun, here. He is mentioned in the Chumayel only by euphemisms, as Yax Um. Instead of being multiplied by four, he is multiplied by nine to become the 9 Gods of the underworld. 10. The dog god, Pek, was probably associated with Oc, which corre-sponds to the day 'dog' in Náhuatl and Quiche, but so is Nacxit 'four leg', the fire guise of Kukul Can. 11. The monkey god, Maax, is clearly associated with the day Chuen. 12. The bee god, Muzen Cab, is associated with Eb only by guess. 13.

She is also called Ix Kalem 'brilliant lady' in the Tizimin. 17. The buzzard god, Ah Kuch, may be associated with Caban, which corresponds to the day 'buzzard' in Náhuatl and 'owl' in Quiche. 18. The Flower goddess, Nicte, Xuchit, may belong with Etz'nab despite her association with the twentieth day in Náhuatl. 19. There was a rain god, Chac, and four rain gods (see number 4). The association with Cauac and with Type IV yearbearers is clear. 20. There was one lord god, the father of the gods, Itzam Na, associated with the day Ahau. Twenty gods are a satisfactory roster for a cycle of four hundred days, but, when the tun was invented, the twenty gods had to be squeezed somehow into eighteen uinals. The Náhuatl solution was to assign two of the uinals two gods each. Another solution appears to have been to multi-ply the Flower goddess by eighteen, producing eighteen Flower gods. Yet another may be to omit two gods, as the Chumayel appears to have done with the hummingbird god and the corn god. The Tizimin lists the names of the 13 Gods and the 9 Gods, and the Chumayel lists the names for the 7 Gods who are known collectively as the pacers. As has been mentioned, there are five sets of four gods each who are closely related to each other and to the direction gods [ba cabob). Finally, there are the 2 Gods. The Yucatecans do not emphasize Mother and Father or Grandmother and Grandfather, nor do they double up the gods of the underworld as the Quiche and Nahua do. Dualism is repre-sented rather by Quetzal and Hummingbird, associated respectively with the Itza and the Xiu and obviously cousins of the Mexican Quetzalcoatl and Huitzilopochtli. They probably also represent the morning and eve-ning stars, and that brings us back tp the unity of hunab ku and the Ordered Country. The unity in diversity of the Mayan pantheon is governed, then, by the unity of the calendar. It is obscured by the welter of synonyms for partic-ular deities, but, like the myriad names of the Virgin Mary, these may be regarded as merely aspects of divinity leading back to unity. The blue-green bird, an image which unifies the quetzal and the hummingbird, also refers to the fifth direction: the center, the crossroads of the other four, spatially symbolizing the unity of god. Whether Hummingbird or Quetzal is intended, it would appear that this conception may also have included a five-fold subdivision of Quetzalcoatl: as death god, as wind, as Venus (sun), as rain, and as fire (Nacxit), thus further unifying the five sets of directional gods, the Ba Cabs or Fathers of the Land. We are now in a position to summarize and synthesize the calendrical, theological, and ceremonial aspects of Mayan religion as the Chumayel describes it during the first century after the Spanish conquest.

Finally, there are the eighteen gods of the tun (plus two to make twenty). Mayan ceremo-nies and beliefs that survived into the twentieth century are added in the last column. They appear to be aligned with the katun. Interwoven in the table are the significant cycles of 4, 5, 7, 9, 13, 18, 19, and 20 that are fundamental to Mayan numerology. Note, for example, that the \"month\" Kankin 'yellow sun' follows Yaxkin 'green sun' by ex-actly seven months. Note that five of the gods are quadripartite and that thirteen are not. Remember that religiously 13 and 7 make 1, that 18 is construed as 5 and 13, 13 as 6 and 7, and 9 as 4 and 5, and that 19 appears only through mention of the unmentionable Uayeb. Note too that the ninth god is multiplied by nine and the thirteenth god by thirteen. The table is intended to suggest something of the richness and complexity of Mayan religious metaphor. And the associations and interassociations among the categories are ultimately metaphorical, not numerological or calendric. The preceding synopsis comes about as close as the Chumayel itself to describing the theogony of the period of 9 Ahau (1559), when the myth \"The Birth of the Uinal\" was composed. It was obviously somewhat Spanish-influenced already, but only to a highly limited degree. A number of other Mayan myths are referred to in the text, but without much expo-sition: \"The Birth of the Flowers\" and the origin of the Itza as descen-dants of Itzam Na. A sermon of 11 Ahau (chapter 19] presents a memor-able picture of the coming of Jesus to Yucatan: The man of the cycle city, Engendering himself all alone, Is tried And put in irons. He is tied up. When he is tied Then he is beaten. Then next he is seated. Then he speaks To the ear of his son. He has his hat on his head And his sandals on his feet. He has his sash tied around his waist, And thus perhaps is his coming, (lines 1977-1990) Obviously he will have to do better than that to best the blue-green bird. Eventually he did, and the Chumayel includes a highly syncretistic creation myth, \"The Sevenfold Creation\" of chapter 41, dating to 2 Ahau (1776). Composed in seven cycles of sevens, this mystical text mingles Mayan cosmology with biblical citations; Spanish and frequently mangled Latin are added to provide the right implication of secret knowledge. The seven cycles of the myth are (I) 7 Creations, (II) 7 Angels, (III) 7 Winds, (IV) 7 Graces, (V) 7 Layers of Heaven, (VI) 7 Saints, and (VII) 7 Names of God. These are indicated by roman numerals in the translation. Furthermore,"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"36 INTRODUCTION there are seven other names of God scattered through the text, and there are at least two cycles of seven names for Christ. I and II. The 7 Creations and the 7 Angels. We begin with the first age, \"the first katun,\" the first creation. Each creation is enumerated and pro-vided with an angel: (1) Dominus, (2) Woman Born Baby, (3) Dawn of the Four Changers, (4) Child Two Knowing, (5) the Egyptian, (6) Child of a Thousand, and (7) Sustaining Grace. III. The 7 Winds: (1) 'Rolling Moon, (2) Thomas Doubted, (3) Archangel, (4) Herodias, (5) Stained Wrap in Front, (6) Virtue, and (7) Jeremiah. IV. The 7 Graces: (1) Jerome, (2) Bol Ay, (3) Jesus. The name Jesus does not occur in this text. In this cycle he is called by seven other names: Man [xib), Complete the Sky, Great Deeds, Hebron, Medicine Water, Bril-liance of Heaven, and Child of Fruit Offering. The cycle of the Graces is then completed by the addition of the four winds, who are equated with the direction's, the yearbearers, and the rain giants, thus covering three of the five manifestations of the Ba Cabs. There is also a somewhat confused effort to name them: (4) Corpinus, (5) Orale, (6) ?Trinity; and (7) ?Unity. This 3 plus 4 approach to making 7 is repeated in cycle VII. V. The 7 Layers of Heaven: (1) Sirius, (2) Thou Wast Buried, (3) Praise Be to God, (4) Bol Ay, (5) Jaguar Cacao, (6) Exhale, and (7) Inhale. VI. The 7 Saints: (1) Spirit [Espíritu], (2) Saint Edendeus, (3) Saint Elisha, (4) Enos, (5) Joseph, (6) Infinite, and (7) Thrice Tripled. VII. The 7 Names of God: (1) Holy God (Dios citbil), (2) Joshua, (3) Jesus. This time he is called Master, Dei, Messiah, Christ, Immanuel, and Jeremiah, and he may also be called Jupiter (perhaps in confusion with Lucifer, whose fall is alluded to). Again the four winds are added. Their associations are (4) red, Saturn, (5) white, Jupiter, (6) black, Mars, and (7) yellow, Venus, Moses. Running through the whole text is another set of seven names of God. In the order in which they appear, they are (1) Lord [dominus], (2) God [ku], (3) Sustaining Grace [sustinal gracia], (4) Holy God [Dios citbil], (5) Unity [unidad], [6] God Made Son [Dios mehenbil], and (7) God the Holy Ghost [Dios Espíritu Santo]. He is also referred to as a father [yum], but he is not named that in this text, as in God the Father [Dios yumbil]. The author has achieved a quite remarkable synthesis of Mayan and Christian religion, incorporating the Trinity and the yearbearers, cosmo-logical space and time, saints, angels, and Mayan (wind) spirits into a single numerologically elegant scheme, focusing on the number that sym-bolizes the highest level of the Mayan heaven. If his command of Latin and Spanish leaves much to be desired, there is nothing wrong with his mathematics. And you cannot avoid thinking that he had been exposed to Saint John's dream of the seven angels and seven plagues that end the world (Revelation 15). Between the composition of the myths \"The Birth of the Uinal\" in 1559 and \"The Sevenfold Creation\" in 1776, there is a gradual accretion of Christian imagery and mythology: the Virgin of Izamal, patron saint of Yucatan, the concepts of the catechism, the commandments of God and the church.

Dualism is underlined by the im-ages of Adam and Eve and the opposition of God and the devil, Kizin 'the Old Fart'. The number 3 attains special status through the introduction of the Trinity. But the seven-day week and other emphases on seven in Christianity had a special appeal to the Maya. It remains possible that the emphasis on seven in \"The Sevenfold Crea-tion\" is intended as a reference to the first seven baktuns of the Mayan era. The earliest date referred to in the Chumayel is in any case the fol-lowing baktun, 8.0.0.0.0, which is cited as a more or less mythical refer-ence date for the beginning of the building of the pyramids. This was A.D. 41. The next date given is 9.13.0.0.0 (8 Ahau), and it is specified that in a year 4 Muluc (674) Chichen Itza was destroyed. It must be significant that this katun brackets the starting date of the Aztec calendar in 682 (Grau-lich 1981). In the following katun (6 Ahau or 711), the Chichen Itza appeared, claiming to be the divine descendants of the father of the gods, Itzam Na, and of Quetzalcoatl as well. Then 4 Ahau (731) is given as the date of the equally mythical birth of the Sun Giants [pauah tun). True to their view of the dating of the may, the Itza \"ordered the mat\" at the end of their thirteenth katun in 13 Ahau (771), and at the following 8 Ahau (948) Chichen Itza is said to have been destroyed again. The arrival of the Xiu is not dated in the Chumayel, but the Tizimin puts it in the last year of 13 Ahau (770). The Mani places it at the end of 8 Ahau (692). They were, or claimed to be, Toltecs ( tutul xiu) from Tula, the direct descendants of Hummingbird {tz'unun, uitzitzillin) and his consort Flower [nicte, xuchit). On the other hand, it is not clear just where they arrived at that date. Their chief was the East priest Bi Ton, but it is pos-sible to construe this phrase [chacnabiton) in Nahuat as chicnahuitan 'nine country'; if so, their place of entry was probably outside of Yucatan altogether. History Tenth Century. Something like real history begins to emerge in the tenth century. After the destruction of Chichen Itza in 948, the \"Chon-tal\" took Champoton (in 987), and in 1059 Chichen is reported to have been destroyed again. Were these \"Chontal\" actually Xiu, who had merely come from Chontal country? In any case, the Itza seized Champoton in 948 and held it off and on against stiff opposition from somebody until 1204. Thirteenth Century. A restless period followed. Conil is reported de-stroyed in the extreme northeast of Yucatan in 1224, and there appears to have been a Xiu incursion at Chichen in 1244. The Xiu established them-selves at Uxmal in 1264 and thus became identified as Hill Lords [uitzil) as well as Flowers. Fourteenth Century. It was 11.3.0.0.0 13 Ahau (1283) when the Xiu and the Itza settled their differences and established the League of May-apan, which therefore was programmed to last until 1539. There was an"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"38 INTRODUCTION incursion of naked cannibals (Caribs or Miskitos?) in 1362, and Izamal was reported destroyed, probably by Xiu. Chichen was destroyed again in 1382, Uxmalin 1401. Fifteenth Century. The League of Mayapan presupposed a Xiu hegemony in western Yucatan, centered at Uxmal, an Itza preeminence in the east, centered at Chichen, and joint rule in the walled city of Mayapan in the center, the seat of the cycle. As the terminal katun of the Xiu cycle ap-proached (8 Ahau), tensions mounted. Otzmal had seated the katun in 12 Ahau (1401)—in Itza territory. (From this date until 1848, the Books chronicle the lordship of the katuns. A synopsis of the cities, Jaguars, and Spokesmen is given in appendix D.) Zizal and Coba disputed the seating of the katun in 10 Ahau—both also in Itza country. When Kan Cab A and Izamal (also Itza) claimed 8 Ahau (1441-1461), things were ripe for an explosion. The Peten Itza (who then called themselves the Xuluc 'the remnant of the Itza') saw the handwriting on the wall, and in 1448 they migrated south to the heart of the Guatemalan Peten and seated a new cycle and katun at Tan Xuluc Mul. They seem to have lived in and near Mayapan and were particularly exposed to the coming storm, which hit in 1451.    \"    The Itza governor of Mayapan at the beginning of 8 Ahau was appar-ently Mex Cue. The governor of Uxmal was probably Hunac Ceel. The governor of Izamal was Ul Ahau, the governor of Merida was Tzim Thul, and the governor of Chichen Itza was Xib Chac. Izamal was the primary seat of the katun, and the Jaguar of Izamal was ailing. A plot was hatched which involved the dynastic politics of Izamal and a number of other cities, including Champoton, whose governor may have been Kak Mo, closely linked to Izamal, and Chichen, whose Can lineage was also related to the Izamal dynasty. 8 Ahau was the terminal katun of the Xiu may. In anticipation of the start of a new cycle in 6 Ahau, new officials were supposed to be named at the mid-katun ceremonies of 8 Ahau in 1451. Merida got into the act by naming Tzim Thul as Jaguar and Uayom Ch'ich' the Strong as Spokes-man, at the same time designating Merida as the new seat of the cycle as well as the katun. Can Ul was named counselor to the Jaguar, thus giving Xiu ceremonial backing to his claim to the governorship of Izamal. When Ul Ahau died, his heirs in Izamal included Ahau Can, Hapay Can, Itzam Can, and Can Ul, all of them relatives of Kukul Can at Chi-chen, priest of Quetzalcoatl and next in line to the governorship of that city. Ahau Can had the best claim, and the Itza of Chichen were deter-mined to support him. Before they could act, however, Hunac Ceel de-posed the Itza governor of Mayapan, replacing him with Cau Ich, naming Chab Le as the Spokesman, and throwing Mex Cue into the cenote at Chichen. To counter or perhaps to forestall these moves (the dating of the events is uncertain), the Itza of Chichen sent an embassy to Izamal. It was made up of three of the four Ba Cabs of Chichen Itza: the East priest Xib Chac, the North priest Xib Chac, and the South priest Uoh Puc.

Apparently at the instiga-tion of Hunac Ceel and Can Ul, the delegation was seized at Izamal and sacrificed. This appears to have been more or less simultaneous with the seizure of the walls of Mayapan and the expulsion of the Itza from there. The Chumayel lists the Ba Cabs of Mayapan as Co Uoh, Ah Ek, Zulim Chan, and Nahuat (reading from east to south). Presumably they were all Xiu. The decision on the Izamal succession then went to Hapay Can, appar-ently a compromise candidate, but there was a considerable amount of confusion and local opposition. Finally, in 1458, Hapay Can was deposed by Can Ul, whose claim to the lordship of Izamal was almost certainly based on an incestuous union (see the Tizimin) but who was an ally of Hunac Ceel. Hapay Can was sent to Chem Chan, a village dependent on Uxmal, where he was sacrificed. Kukul Can became governor of Chichen Itza, Can Ul became governor of Izamal, and apparently both claimed the Jaguar priesthood. Cau Ich continued as governor of Mayapan, Uxmal Chac (another name for Hunac Ceel?) of Uxmal, Kak Mo of Champoton, and Tzim Thul of Merida, and apparently all of them claimed to seat the katun. The fall of Mayapan definitively ended the religious and political unity of Yucatan. Subsequent prophets from the fifteenth to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries pled for unity, but the basis for it—agreement on the calendar—had been destroyed. Underlying personalities and the calcula-tion of personal advantage was the argument between the Xiu and the Itza about the dating of the may. Mayapan fell on Xiu time (8 Ahau rather than 13 Ahau), and the Itza could neither forgive nor forget that fact. The interlude between the two dates, 1461 and 1539, was marked by increas-ing turmoil and disunion. The victors of the conspiracy of Mayapan (Can Ul, Hunac Ceel, Cau Ich, and Kak Mo) were not victorious for long: they all disappeared from history in the following katun. Hunac Ceel claimed the right to seat 6 Ahau at Uxmal, but the katun was also claimed by Hunac Thi and Teabo and just about everybody else. Champoton was put out of business by Izamal. The Chumayel notes that the last (major?) pyramid was built in 1467. It does not say where. The nobles were having plenty of trouble with each other. There were no less than seven claimants to the seating of 4 Ahau. But by that time they were having trouble with the peasants as well. A resurgent Kukul Can seated the katun at Chichen Itza and attacked the Xiu. There were plagues. And the peasantry took to the woods and formed guerrilla bands to defend themselves from the tribute and captive raids of the marauding nobles. Modeled after the military orders of the nobility, these companies were a prominent feature of the disturbances of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. They are first mentioned in the prophecy of Ahau Pech in 4 Ahau: Ants, Many Skunks, Hanging Rabbits, Cowbirds, Mag-pies, Blackbirds, and Mice. As sun priest and Spokesman, apparently at Teabo, Ahau Pech predicted the demise of these orders in 4 Ahau, but he must have got his glyphs"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"40 INTRODUCTION shuffled. Atikuhe also seated this katun, and heart sacrifices are men-tioned for 1485 in connection with the calendar round ceremonies (Oc Na) at Mayapan. Although Mayapan had already fallen, it was not until this katun that it was destroyed, according to the Tizimin. Sixteenth Century. Katun 2 Ahau opened in 1500 with a great hurricane and fire, and in 1516 there was a plague. The latter, tersely described as a fever [kakil), may have been a consequence of the first contacts with the Spaniards. The celebrated encounter between Columbus and a boatload of Maya on the high seas in the preceding katun is not mentioned in any of the Books. But Spanish entradas began in earnest in 2 Ahau: Aguilar in 1507, Valdivia in 1511, Ponce de León in 1513, Córdoba in 1517, Grijalva in 1518, and Cortés in 1519. The arrival of Ponce de León appears to be recognized and correctly dated in line 140. Other apparent references to dates in this katun are, however, erroneous because they are stated in the Valladolid calendar: when corrected they prove to be later. The katun was seated at Chacal Na and also at Cozumel. The sermon of the katun by its Spokesman, Puc Tun, is brief and vague, but dire. The final katun in the Itza may, 13 Ahau, was a turbulent and eventful period. At least four towns (Cozumel, Kin Colah Peten, Euan, and Coba) tried to seat the katun, clear enough evidence of the continuing chaos left by the fall of Mayapan. The sermon of the Spokesman, Xopan Nahuat, predicts the imminent arrival of the Spaniards (no great trick, as they had already arrived) and attempts to relate it to the origin myth of the Xiu, \"The Birth of the Flowers.\" In 1526 Francisco de Montejo landed on the east coast with the intent of initiating the long, hard conquest of Yucatan. Three years later a new calendar round began, coinciding with the mid-katun ceremonies and fur-ther exacerbating the political troubles, since this was the moment for designating the Jaguar for the next katun. Matters came to a head in 1536. Because of a drought in the province of Tutul Xiu (according to the Mani), the governor of Mani, Pot Xiu, decided to lead a water pilgrimage to Chichen Itza. He was accompanied by his lieutenant, Kin Chi, and eleven other lords from adjacent towns: Iban Can of Telcit, Pa Cab of Oxkutzcab, Kan Caba of Panabchen, Ku Pul of Sacalum, Nahuat of Teabo, Ul Uac Chan of Cauich, Zon Ceh of P'en Cuyut, Ahau Tuyu of Muna, Xulcum Che of Tipikal, Tu Cuch of Mama, and Zit Couat of Chumayel. As a water priest {pul ha) and as a pilgrim, Pot Xiu (and his companions) should have been secure enough, and he had been assured of a safe-conduct by Chi Cocom, governor of Otzmal. How-ever, when they reached Otzmal, the whole party was seized and mur-dered. This was on February 2, 1536 (Craine and Reindorp 1979: 77, note 60). The Mayan date was a calculated insult. It fell on 9 Imix, the day after 8 Ahau, the traditional end of the Xiu cycle, and hence it was a di-rect assertion of the Itza intention of seating their own cycle, which they did, three years later. It must be remembered too that the Spanish had reached Campeche the year before and that Pot Xiu's father, Tutul Xiu, was their first important convert.

Mani was all the more incensed at the governor's murder. On August 27, 1537, another thirteen lords of Mani got together to plan their revenge. According to the Chumayel, they were Ah Mo, Chan Xiu, Ahau Ez, Ah Tz'iu of Chi Nab, Pot Cupul, Pot Che, Batun Itza, E Uan of Cocel, Chan Uc of Tz'ibil Kak, U Can of Ekob, Chi Uc of Kul Koh, Chan Motul, and Ahau Coy. Whether anything came of this planning does not appear, but the battle between the Xiu and the Itza was clearly joined, the Xiu siding with the Spanish against the pagan Itza. The Xiu were sufficiently moved by the murder of Pot Xiu and his com-panions that they made heroes of all of them, using their portraits and names as the lords of the thirteen katuns in the Mani and Kaua (Craine and Reindorp 1979: 77 ff.). But the most important event of 13 Ahau was its ending. This was scheduled to fall on 11.16.0.0.0 13 Ahau 8 Xul, November 3, 1539 (Julian), in the Tikal calendar. The Mayan year began on 11 Ix 1 Pop (July 21) in the new Mayapan calendar, which was formally inaugurated by the Itza at Mayapan on 11 Ahau 7 Uo (August 16). The Xiu started their ceremonies à month later in Merida on 3 Oc 17 Tzec (September 15), focusing on the terminal date of the old katun. In the new calendar this was 13 Ahau 8 Xul (November 3). Their ceremonial program went on until 1 Cimi 13 Ch'en (January 9, 1540), according to the Tizimin. The Xiu ceremonial of the may for the inauguration of 11 Ahau has already been described. It included the historical drama \"The Fall of Mayapan.\" We do not possess a description of the Itza ceremonial. The conquest of the Maya took a long time. In a sense it is still going on. But katun 11 Ahau was the katun of the conquest par excellence. It was nicknamed the Flower katun as a euphemism for the fact that it was a period of war. The Spanish reached Heaven Born Merida (which was now the seat of the may as well as of the katun) in 1540 and \"founded\" it as a Spanish city the following year. The founding of the cathedral in Merida is duly noted. Yax Chac was Jaguar at Merida, but Zulim Chan was the Itza Jaguar at Emal, and Colox Peten (Kin Colah Peten?) also claimed to seat the katun. The Spokesman at Merida at the beginning of 11 Ahau was Tzin Yabun the Younger, and his sermon (which is garbled arid fragmentary in chapter 12) is given clearly in chapter 13: it is ro-tundly pro-Christian and antipagan. According to the Chumayel, tribute and forced labor were established and the province of Chikin Ch'el was subdued in 1542, and this was con-firmed in a treaty [concierto) of 1543. Baptisms began in 1544. What the Spanish perceived as the Great Mayan Revolt of 1545 to 1546 passes un-noticed in the Chumayel. Reference is made to the devastating conquest of Uaymil and Chetumal in 1546 and 1547 (line 2431). The coming of the missionaries (the fathers of our souls) was correctly perceived by the Maya as an important event. The \"arrival of Christianity\" is usually placed in 1546, the date the Franciscans reached Campeche. They got to Mani in 1548, to Merida, Conkal, and Izamal in 1549 (line 2347), and to Valladolid in 1552. At least in Merida and Mani, the fathers"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"42 INTRODUCTION almost immediately began to instruct the Maya in Spanish, Latin, and al-phabetic literacy and before the end of the katun (by 1556 in fact) their students were producing Mayan chronicles in Latin letters (see chapter 14). There can be no question but that hieroglyphic literacy and Long Count dating were still intact as the katun ended on 11.17.0.0.0: the text says so (line 2496). Although the Maya recorded (if incompletely) their early brushes with the Christians in 2 Ahau, the genesis of pro- and anti-Christian polariza-tion in 13 Ahau, and their first encounters with missionaries in 11 Ahau, they generally regarded 9 Ahau as the period of the \"coming of Christian-ity.\" The katun was seated at Merida and Teabo in 1559. The Jaguar at Merida is named as Ul Uac in the Kaua and as Uac Nal in the Tizimin; his Spokesman was Kauil Ch'el, whose sermon (chapter 21) is a lament over Itza factionalism. The Chumayel references are oblique, but they are almost certainly al-lusions to the actions of Diego de Landa, whose auto-da-fé in Mani in 1562 (the famous \"Burning of the Books\") appears to have made a deep impression on the Maya, even though it is not directly described in the Chumayel. The period is remembered as one of sprinklings and hangings (baptisms and inquisitional tortures: the victims were suspended by their armpits or feet to encourage confessions of heresy). When Francisco de Toral arrived as bishop of Yucatan in 1564 and suspended Landa's Inquisi-tion, the Maya had good reason to remember him—and did so. The coming of the Virgin of Izamal is recorded as July 11, 1568, in the middle of this katun. By that time, Landa was back in Spain writing his Relación and defending himself from charges of having exceeded his au-thority. He was exonerated and returned to Yucatan as bishop in 1573. The Chumayel does not record any of this, though it does note his death at the beginning of the following katun. An extremely important conse-quence of Landa's trial was the removal of the Indians from the jurisdic-tion of the Holy Inquisition. Yax Chac of Merida seated 7 Ahau for the Xiu, and Chu Uah seated it at Mayapan for the Itza. The calendar round of 1581 passes unremarked. The katun was distinguished by the outbreak of the Bech' Kab war, a bitter civil struggle that seems to have dominated the period. No details are given. At some point during the katun, Yax Chac was replaced by Amayte Kauil. The peasant military companies were again active, particularly the Strong Skunks, Jaguar Possums, Jaguar Foxes, Deer, and Rabbits, accord-ing to the Tizimin. A congress of sages was held in Merida under Amayte Uitz. It was attended by both Xiu and Itza, but it appears to have been un-able to bring peace (see the Tizimin). 5 Ahau was seated at Merida January 1, 1599 (Gregorian). Amayte Kauil continued as Jaguar. The Itza seated Puz Horn at Zotz'il, east of Tizimin. (He was later replaced by Kaua Horn.) And the war went on. The military companies (Possums, Foxes, Bedbugs, Suckers, Earth Lions) were active in both eastern and western Yucatan, as peasants and merchants united in their opposition to paying double tribute—to the Spanish and to the Mayan lords.

The Spanish are blamed for tribute, hangings, plague, and the destruction of 13 cities— Valladolid, Coba, Chichen Itza, Uxmal, Cib, Kabah, Zayi, Pakam, Horn Tun, Ake, Ake Gate, Emal, and Izamal. The Itza are blamed for continuing to oppose Christianity, thus giving the Spanish a pretext for continuing to punish the innocent Xiu along with the guilty Itza. But, if the Itza are bad, the Spanish are worse: \"Indeed the Itza could come here three times over for one occurrence of aliens\" (lines 2899-2900). Seventeenth Century. Toward the end of the katun the military com-panies appear to have been brought under control, possibly by calling in assistance from Uaymil. Hoi Och and Xaclam Pat and perhaps other lead-ers were captured, and there are references to sacrifice. They may actually have been sacrificed: the end of 5 Ahau was a splendid occasion. The dawn of 3 Ahau in 1618 coincided with an even baktun: 12.0.0.0.0. It was therefore ushered in at Merida by the twenty-act ceremonial of the baktun, which is described in detail in chapter 29 (and has been summa-rized above). Competent hieroglyphic writing probably lasted this long (see line 5289), and the Long Count calendar certainly did. Coc Ay was seated as the Xiu Jaguar in Merida, and another Coc Ay was the Itza Jaguar at Zuyua. The Xiu sermon of the katun predicts a flood and the conversion of the Itza, even though the Spokesman who presum-ably delivered it is identified as an Antichrist. The military companies were still active enough that the leaders of three of them (the Ants, Jaguars, and Locusts) were captured and sacrificed by nine rain priests—identified as Bol Ay, Pat Ay, Thul Caan, Bohol Caan, Ch'uhum Caan, Caan II, Kuch Caan, Thel En, and Ceh II—presumably impersonating the 9 Gods. The new calendar round began in 1633 (line 1247), overshadowed perhaps by the baktun ceremonial that began the katun. Toward the end of the katun (or perhaps at the mid-katun ceremonies, as would have been more proper), a colorful character named Caesar Augustus registered his \"request,\" his claim to the Jaguar priesthood of Merida in 1 Ahau, and Ol Zip of Emal announced the same intention for the Itza priesthood. Both encountered opposition. 1 Ahau was seated in 1638 at Merida by Amayte Kauil, according to the Mani, and by Puc Ol at Emal, according to the Chumayel. The Spokesman at Emal was Ual Ac (or Ual Icim in the Tizimin). Later, however, Ol Zip succeeded in becoming Jaguar at Emal—a politically significant develop-ment, as he had converted to Christianity in 1611. His Spokesman was ap-parently Ol Ha. It was a disturbed katun, marked by war, plague (1652), and famine (1654-1658). Early in the period (1644?), Ol Zip was overthrown by Hun Pic, who in turn was replaced (1651?) by Can Ul. The military companies were on the move again (Many Skunks, Hanging Rabbits, Foxes, and Flags), and, again early in the katun, Caesar Augustus added to the confu-sion by seizing the priesthood at Merida and heading what sounds like a"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"rida in lapter 27) m end to îish are cities— n, Horn continuing itinuing to tza are ree times y com-alling in rther lead-îy actually 12.0.0.0.0. nial of the i summa-lis long Doc Ay was a flood ) presum-apanies ts, Jaguars, dentified n II, Kuch ods.

The curious and anachronistic sermon of the katun (chapter 34) brings in the shadowy figures of Antonio Martinez and Saúl (who really belong in the nineteenth century, along with their frigates and the War of Havana that are also mentioned), but its content suggests the message of Caesar Augustus: an all-out drive to Christianize the Itza. Chichen Itza and Zuyua are specifically mentioned. The pressure produced by this move-ment spurred a counterreaction, apparently begun at Tihosuco, which was called the Chan War and had as its objective the recapture of Valladolid, Emal, and Uaymil from the Christian party. In this it was successful, and the anti-Christians seated the following katun at Valladolid. The career of Caesar Augustus marks the last gasp of the mystique of the katun in Merida, and 1 Ahau was the last katun that it claimed to seat. However, even though they were slowly being Christianized, the Itza continued the katun system for another two hundred years. Yax Chuen was seated as Jaguar of 12 Ahau at Valladolid in 1658. This is the only katun in the history of Yucatan which is frankly admitted to be \"good.\" The military companies were finally brought under control and disappeared from history. (The Foxes, Earth Lions, Hanging Rabbits, Flags, Lions, Weasels, and Turtles are all mentioned as being finished off, either in the Chumayel or in the Tizimin.) There is some indication that Yax Chuen achieved all this through a policy of democratization: the lords and priests made common cause with the curers and other commoners, putting an end to the class warfare that had previously precluded unity. Yax Chuen also sounded a note which will be heard increasingly in the future—to the effect that the Itza are the real Christians. Temporarily the war was over. Uuc Uitz and Chac Ek were designated as Jaguar and Spokes-man of the next katun, but there is no evidence that they ever took office. A hurricane of 1665 is said to have killed Father Agustín Gómez. It is not clear where. Mayan nativism, as represented by the tradition of the Itza, moved in-creasingly eastward, became increasingly Christian, but clung doggedly to the traditional calendar and its rites. Katun 10 Ahau was seated in 1677 at Chable (which I believe to have been at or near Felipe Canillo Puerto), with Uat Horn as Jaguar, according to the Chumayel. (The other Books say it was Lahun Chan, presumably an heir of the Chan War of forty years earlier.) Eight years iater the calendar round began, and there are sugges-tions that sacrifices were held, possibly of animals. Eighteenth Century. 8 Ahau was reseated at Chable in 1697. Amayte Kauil was installed as Jaguar. A plague described as fever rash [zan kak) occurred in 1709. The Chumayel contains no katun history for this pe-riod or for the one that followed. (6 Ahau was seated by Kak Mo at Teabo in 1717, according to the Tizimin.) Sometime during 8 Ahau another summary chronicle was composed (chapter 37), apparently at Tixkokob. It is confused by an anachronistic use of the Valladolid calendar attributable to some later eighteenth-century copyist, who may also have been respon-sible for copying chapter 27. Indeed, chapter 37 could be regarded as simply an updating of chapter 27."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"46 INTRODUCTION The longest katun in Mayan history was 4 Ahau, seated at Teabo in 1737 and not ended until 1776. The Tizimin tells us that Mac Chahom was seated as Jaguar. The katun was also seated at Bacalar in the south and Tan Horn in the west. A courier was sent out from Merida to order the suspension of the Itza tribute collected in the name of Chichen Itza, and things looked bleak for the Itza: it was only two katuns to the end of the Itza may. A solution was found: change the calendar! The result was the Valladolid calendar, inaugurated in 1752, five years before 4 Ahau was due to end, but apparently decided upon at the mid-katun ceremonies five years be-fore that (line 5330). The beginning of 4 Ahau coincided with the begin-ning of the calendar round in 1737. That was enough in itself to make this a portentous katun, and it is likely that heart sacrifices were made at the ceremonies inaugurating the katun (line 5326). Proposed or at least backed by Pat Ay, the new calendar set up a may of twenty-four katuns of twenty-four habs each, thus putting a definitive end to the Long Count (baktun) dating system but also bringing the Mayan calendar into a much closer and equally permanent relationship to the Christian one. Henceforth the Mayan katun would always begin (as it did \"accidentally\" in 1752) on the second day of the Mayan year and (barring leap years) on the same European date. (This is also the last katun that gives evidence of glyphic writing.) So it was ordained that Op Ik would be designated Jaguar at Valladolid for 2 Ahau at the mid-katun ceremonies of 1747 (at Teabo?) and that katun 4 Ahau would be reinaugurated at the three-quarter katun ceremonies of 1752. We know nothing of the later history of this katun, but the promi-nence of this calendar in the Chumayel implies its acceptance by the Xiu. (The noteworthy nativistic movement of Jacinto Canek at Cisteil in 1761 is not registered in any of the Books.) As scheduled, 2 Ahau was seated by Op Ik at Valladolid in 1776, and Valladolid became the seat of the may as well as of the katun. To under-line the importance of the occasion, the Chumayel records the highly syn-cretistic myth \"The Sevenfold Creation\" (chapter 41), which is relatively traditionalistic, but then counters this with a final attack on the sins of the Itza (chapter 42) and a completely orthodox (and probably non-Indian) sermon on the Last Judgment (chapter 43). In chapter 44 there is a note of a hurricane on August 18, 1766 (line 6152), and a plague at Chumayel on January 20, 1782 (line 6160). Nineteenth Century. Chapter 45 provides a katun history of 13 Ahau (1800-1824). It is almost entirely pro forma, seating the katun at Coba under Kin Chil, just as in the preceding 13 Ahau, and referring to Yax Chac, the Jaguar of 11 Ahau (1539), as well as to Itzam Na and Itzam Tzab. Presumably this was the occasion for the last performance of the cere-monial of the may, and the anachronistic references may be to that per-formance. There is insistent reference to a solar eclipse—in 1834, ac-cording to the Tizimin, and indeed a partial eclipse would perhaps have been visible in Yucatan on November 30 of that year (see Oppolzer 1887: remain"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 47 ;abo in Chahom îe south to order :hen Itza, the end of Valladolid : to end, years be-le begin-) make this ade at the p a may of ;finitive the Mayan p to the Ji (as it did id (barring m that alladolid hat katun nonies of îe promi->y the Xiu. il in 1761 76, and b under-lighly syn-elatively e sins of Dn-Indian) s a note of tnayel on 292-293). The word of the katun is a fifty-year famine, which would have covered the first half of the nineteenth century. Perhaps it did. The sketchy ritual references of chapter 45 do not match the fuller ones of chapter 46, which reports the seating of Onetzihuitl as Jaguar, ostensi-bly at Tizimin. Possibly two different performances of the ceremonial of the may come into play. Eight of the thirteen acts are described, and act 17 gives the historical and commemorative drama of Antonio Martinez in some detail, including dialogue. Unlike the other historical dramas in the Chumayel, this one cannot be pinned down in time—Antonio Martinez remains unidentified. Many of the details, in fact, appear to be entirely contemporary, belonging to katun 11 Ahau (1824-1848) and not \"his-torical\" at all. The prophet Antonio Martinez identifies himself as Jesus Christ and offers to lead a fleet of frigates against the French and the king of Havana in order to guarantee the Christianization of the Itza and the acceptance of the \"six-part bull,\" suspending tribute in accordance with the treaty of 1543 (in the previous 11 Ahau, three hundred years earlier). His arrival is predicted for 1838 and the suspension of tribute for 1843, which can hardly be accidental. The chronology of the passage is further confused by the retroactive in-sertion of Antonio Martínez, Saúl, their frigates, and the War of Havana into the katun history for 1 Ahau (1638), exactly two hundred years ear-lier. The tale of Antonio Martinez must belong to the earlier part of 11 Ahau, since Pío Pérez transcribed it from the Mani in 1837. The bull sus-pending tribute may be anything from the Cortes of Cadiz in 1806 to the Revolution for Independence, which ended the may as 11 Ahau began in 1824. The last katun mentioned in the Chumayel is 9 Ahau, which began in 1848. Again, it can hardly be coincidence that this marks the outbreak of the Caste War at Tihosuco, Ichmul, Valladolid, and Tizimin—all late Itza centers (Reed 1964). The word katun not only meant 'two dozen years/ it also meant 'war'. And there are Maya who are still aware that 1980 was the twelfth year of 12 Ahau. At Xcacal the Books of Chilam Balam are still read publicly each year (Burns 1980: 6). It is ominous that both the year 2000 and the next baktun and calendar round endings fall in the coming katun 8 Ahau. 3 Ahau at Coba o Yax am Tzab. e cere-hat per-4, ac-ps have zer 1887: jjf Yt^i"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"HEAVEN BORN MERIDA AND ITS DESTINY"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Q.: What is a man on a road?

The Mayan text gives the coefficients of the katuns in roman numerals. Note the archaic listing of IIII for IV in line 15. 14. Roys 1967: 135 translates chictahal as 'discovery'. The form is causative from the root chic 'appear', hence the sense is 'the causing to appear'. The chronology of this chapter has been subject to various interpretations, thus displacing the sketchily related events over many centuries of European time. Because the Maya believed that each katun cycle predicted all the others, they often repeated the same cycle with slightly varying details. The present chronicle contains one such repetition (see note 103). Taking this into account, the first date mentioned would be katun 6 Ahau ending on 9.14.0.0.0 (711 J. Even so, I doubt that any of the events chronicled can be accepted as actually historical before the tenth-century katun 8 Ahau ending on 10.6.0.0.0 (948).

Roys 1967: 138 and Barrera 1948: 65 have 'the vultures entered the houses' and Roys comments that Mayapan was already destroyed. The Tizimin agrees that Mayapan fell in 8 Ahau but asserts that its destruction was not complete until 4 Ahau. Oc Na 'entering the house' was the name of the calendar round ceremony (Tozzer 1941: 161) and kuchil means 'appearance' as well as 'buzzard-kind'. 116. Roys 1967: 138 interprets this as smallpox, which is possible at this date. I think kakil may reasonably be read either as 'fever' or as 'conflagration'.

Consequently it was a very bad Year of war, And 15 Zip Was nearly the third. 9 Imix in fact Was the time he died, The water priest Pot Xiu, In the year period of our lord Of the year 158. 11 Ahau there arrived The god people from the east. Those who came And arrived Were the first founders Of these lands Of us Mayan people In the year of our lord 1513. 120. This correctly identifies the date of the end of katun 13 Ahau in the year 11 Ix (1539), six years before the year 4 Kan (1545). The exact date of the water priest's death is given in line 125, and it is within 13 Ahau. The manner of expressing this date merits comment. Before 1539 the Maya were using the classical Tikal calendar (Edmonson 1976). After 1539 they used the colonial Mayapan calendar, which changed the ycarbearers by two days. To facili-tate calculating in the latter calendar, the author advances six years to a conve-nient Kan year (the senior yearbearer in the new system) and calculates backward. This led him (I can't follow quite how or why) to 9 Imix 3 Ceh, February 2, 1536. Because the Mayapan calendar numbers the days of the uinal from 1 through 20 while the Tikal calendar numbers them from 0 through 19 (and uses different yearbearers), the same date would have been 9 Imix 4 Ceh in the Tikal system. But it is explicit that the Mayapan calendar is intended because of the use of the colo-nial yearbearers. The Tikal yearbearers do not appear as such in any of the Books. 121. Roys omits this and the following line from his translation, though he quotes Martínez: cesó de ¡levarse la cuenta del katun de los años (Roys 1967: 138, note 3). I don't see how Martinez derived this from the text, though katun may refer either to twenty ttins or to war. Barrera 1948: 65 has he aqui que yo hago la correlación precisa de los años del katun. 123. Why he chooses 15 Zip is not clear to me. In 1545 that would be 6 Etz'nab, which is followed by 7 Cauac, 8 Ahau, and 9 Imix. He may have had some mnemonic for going from this to the 1536 yearbearer 8 Cauac and for locating 9 Imix in that year. If so, it is not the same as mine. 132. Roys 1967: 138 has 'mighty men'. 133.

The \"remainder\" of the Itza appear to have been the Peten Itza, who were at odds with both the Itza of Chichen and the western Xiu. 294. This appears to date the founding of Tan Xuluc Mul as cycle seat of the Peten Itza in 1448, three years before the conspiracy of Mayapan came to a head. Zac Lac Tun 'white flat stone' was an honorific title of cycle seats, presumably referring to their plazas. (Compare Gaspar Antonio Chi, quoted in Tozzer 1941: 230: \"Report of some of the customs... (of the people of the) province of Yuca-tan, Saclac(tun Mayapan). . ..\") It is elsewhere applied to Mayapan, Valladolid, and Bacalar. Mayapan 'place of the well of the cycle' is similarly used, as are Ziyan Caan (Caan Zih) 'heaven born', Tan Cah 'front town', and Tan Tun 'front stone'. I believe the reference here is to Tan Xuluc Mul throughout, and not to the site we know as Mayapan. (See, however, Barrera 1948:62, note 10.) 299. Kak u Pacal 'fire his glance' and Tecuilo (Nah. tecuilonti 'sodomist') are usually treated as two lords associated with Mayapan and said to be the con-querors of Izamal and Motul as well as Champoton (Roys 1967: 141, note 4). The Nahuat name makes it unlikely that they were Itza as the Relaciones de Yucatán would have it. I know of no instance of an Itza with a Nahuat name, even an in-sulting one.

Eleven of these are Ahau signs and the remaining two may be shield-arrow and flint-knife. The Itza contention that the cycle ended at the end of katun 13 Ahau and the beginning of katun 11 Ahau is significantly related to the often quoted statement by Landa that the Mayan year began on 1 Imix, which is the day following 13 Ahau.

Roys 1967: 133, note 11 suggests that 'blood vomit' is yellow fever while acknowledging that there is some doubt that yellow fever occurred in America be-fore the conquest. 429. Kukul Can is the Náhuatl Quetzalcoatl 'quetzal serpent'. In this case I be-lieve it to be a personal name: both Kuk and Can are frequent lineage names. The suffixes -VI and -il appear to me to be merely euphonic in this connection (cf. Ulil Ahau, Yaxal Chuen). Kukul Can was a prominent lord at Chichen Itza toward the end of katun 8 Ahau, and I believe this to be the same man, claiming the Jaguar priesthood for the second time some twenty years later. (The Tizimin makes this his fourth term, implying perhaps that he was active twice during the intervening katun but that Chumayel didn't know about it.)"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"T low death; >nd time. \" *& X i »U-*6 .r: u Cajist.i <f ulo>rtvas' **. tí t£tt •* ?•• uâévf-~z rifnmlc 'h'ya Be\"-mslation is possibility. ;ever while America be->is case I be-ïames.

Destroyed is the moon of the Ant people. 433. N(a) Ahau Pech 'lord tick', a prophet of the end of the fifteenth century. The sermon is the earliest one we have, dating to the end of 4 Ahau, 11.14.0.0.0 (1500). For some reason the manuscript numbers the nine lines of text in arabic numerals (as indicated by lowercase roman numerals in the Mayan text). The line breaks do not appear to be natural or significant, sometimes falling in the middle of a word. 438. Most translators have interpreted ok as 'weep'; I read it as 'above, raise'. Either is possible. 440. That is, the prophet predicts correctly that Christianity will arrive in four katuns (or 9 Ahau, which began in 1559). 442. As a sun priest, Ahau Pech claims to be the vessel and true child of the sun god. Surprisingly, this is the only mention of such a deity in these Books. 458. Bricker reads uil as 'hunger' in this and the following lines."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"70 THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY Bin y anac t u pach uijl T u men u bobo(vi/7)chil uijl* 460 U chuyum thulil uijl Sinic Tzïu (ix) Kan Pich   465   X pucil.* It is to be after the moon, Because of the Many Skunks' moon, The Hanging Rabbits' moon, The Ants, Cowbirds, Magpies, Blackbirds, And Mice. 460. Roys 1967: 166 reads bob as 'a mysterious animal' and och as 'possum', but I believe the word is a reduplicative form of boch 'skunk'. 466. The Chumayel version of this prophecy is both the fullest and the most coherent we have. The Mani (Craine and Reindorp 1979: 73-74) has: When the time is known in which the lord takes pity (has compassion), four Katuns will have passed and the bearer of the True God will arrive. Weep when you remember what I say. Oh Itzá, lords of the land, when your guests arrive receive them with pleasure. Nahau Pech, priest in the days of the Katun 4 Ahau, tells you this at the end of the Katún. The Tizimin (Edmonson 1982: lines 401-432) has: The prophecy Of Ahau Pech On the sun And moon, Of the day of remembrance Of the fathers Which removes the face Of the returned ruler. Four parts of the katun cycle are done And returned. The true cast On the day of the god Is removed And stands up. Let me be seated then, Fathers, Whom you saw On the road.

The Word of God Is this: 475 Half down is his temple Who is their lordship. The end of the Word of God Is this. 467. The suffix -il appears to be added to numerals somewhat capriciously as a matter of euphony, especially when counting day names. The illustration accompanying this text (see p. 68) shows the lord of the katun with a crown and cross over a platform (a pyramid?). It is accompanied by a glyph which might be read as a crescent moon, half black and half striped, possibly re-ferring to the approaching end (moon) of the katun cycle and to the half-and-half nature of the katun. The glyph is surmounted by an eyelike element. Late mar-ginal notations include the numerals 12 and 1760. Segundo implies a katun cycle beginning with 4 Ahau. Ttàsis íHe cycle employed by \"The Second Chronicle\" (chapter 2). 469. Mayauaz is hard to fathom and does not occur elsewhere. On the model of Mayapan one might suggest that it is composed of the Mayan root may 'cycle' and the Náhuatl uatza 'run out of/use up'. But whereas -apan is a properly formed Náhuatl locative suffix, -ua(t)z(a) is not. I believe the composer of this text was playing word games, in that the whole phrase could be translated as 'the cycle water is used up (at) the seat of expense' or 'Mayauaz Cuzamil'. . . was the seat of the katun. Cuzamil as a place-name is usually glossed as 'swallows'. I have opted to treat the whole thing as a place-name here, but I think it originally meant more. Running out of food and water is a frequent metaphor for approaching the end of a katun, why not of a cycle? 471. Roys 1967: 162 omits here and in lines 472 and 475 the fact that either tan or tan coch may mean 'half and that coch and horn mean both 'clear' and 'deep'. The author appears to have been punning. 475. The use of the Spanish templo is noteworthy."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"72 THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY 9.

Burned on the earth, Burned the hoof of the katun period, His tobacco That is to come. His spirit will be seen; His word will be spoken. He may cause lamentation For the sufferings that have occurred. 479. The dating of this prophecy is frankly impressionistic. Aside from the first four lines, which constitute a sort of title and are possibly a late addition, the brief text seems to me to be non-Christian and orthodoxly Mayan. It expresses forebodings but no specific anticipation of the Spanish conquest. And it may have some archaic and glyphic elements. Customary scholarly caution induces me to place it as late as is credible, and that lands me in 2 Ahau. It is more likely to be earlier than later. 485. Roys 1967: 165, note 5 comments that Kauil is a god name, a lineage name, and an obsolete word for 'food'. I believe it is an obsolete word for 'god' too, related to the development of the more current form kuil (cf. Quiche qav). 486. Roys 1967: 165 and Barrera 1948: 195 read uchamal 'in time to come' here and in line 489.1 believe that if it were that form it would be uchmal, as in line 494, and even then I don't see that it expresses the future. A literal rendering of line 494 would be something like 'its pain, suffering fulfillment'. I believe the god's smoking is intended to explain why the earth is burning. It may also imply that this was nicknamed \"the tobacco katun\" (see Tizimin, note 1860). 488. The hoof may be a glyphic pun. Tz'itz' 'hoof is a synonym for may 'hoof, cycle'. 10.

They will stop sprinkling the water Of the twice-born, 680 The Holy Spirit. They received holy oil Without pressing to return And come to God.

Roys 1967: 162-163 apparently reads octob for oktob and interprets tac as 'so' rather than 'impede'. 688. The Itza Jaguars, priests of the katun, remained staunchly pagan until the end of the sixteenth century. The Xiu Jaguar |Tutul Xiu) was converted to Chris-tianity at the time of the invasion of Campeche. 690. The text breaks off incomplete.

They did not write down the leap year correlation because it could easily be computed mentally. The reference to December 9 is the date of the winter solstice. In 1541 this would have had to be corrected by adding 3 Ix (leap) year days, thus giving the correct Julian date, De-cember 12. The whole assertion here is simply that the middle of the Christian year is analogous to the winter solstice, the middle of the Mayan one. The year 1541 is selected for comment because that was the date of the Spanish founding of Merida. There arc three rebus elements in the text: i. (Sp. le] for Mayan ti 'at',- 5, Mayan ho 'five' (hence Ti Ho 'Merida'); and 2, Mayan ca 'two', which thus initiates the expression can hel 'four changers', the usual expression for 'ycarhcarcrs', who here personify the Mayan year count. 1370. Three score katuns would be three baktuns. I believe the assertion here is that the Maya began building the pyramids in 8.0.0.0.0 (46) and finished seventy-five katuns later in 11.15.0.0.0(1520). A more precise date is given later. 1374. Cartabona appears to me to be a garbled reference to Constantinople. It is certainly a foreign word (Maya has no r). 1379. Roys 1967: 80, note 2 says, \"Possibly a reference to the battle on the day of San Bernabé at Merida.\" Saint Barnaby became Mcnda's patron saint. 1386. It is not clear what burden changed. This would be the seventeenth year {note continued on following page)"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"I02 THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY 9: Hel e t in tz'ibtah uchc i Y utzcin ( 16) nabal nucuch muullob T u men ch'iballob Y etel he c en baal u mentah 1390 ahauuob He x lie u mentic ob mull e Ox lahun te katun 11.13.6.0.0 Ca tac uac p'el haab i* Lie y uczcinnic ob cuch i He ix u chun mul  1395  Y utzcinnah ob e Holhun baak u kaalal u mullil Ca tac lahu y ox kal u much' cuentail mul* Y utzcinnah ob T u yuklah  i400  Cabil Peten Bay ti kaknab ' Tac t u chun cab U patah   1405   Ix u kaba ob xan Y etel u ch'eenil Ca tun utzcinnab i Mactzil ti ob T u men Dios lae uio Caa el ob T u men kak T u cahal ysrael Y etel bobil lay a U kaahlay katunob  1415  Y etel haabob In return I have had written The completion of the great mounds By the lineages, And that was something the lords had done. Hence in fact they built these mounds In thirteen katuns And just about six years. Then they finished the job. Thus then was the origin of the mounds They completed. Some six thousand pyramids were walled, And nearly fifty more made the total count of the mounds. They finished them And they spread all over The land And the country. Thus it was from the sea Nearly to the base of the land. They labeled And also named them, Together with the wells. And then was performed A miracle for them By God there. And they were burned By fire In the town of Israel, Together with the stalks there. This is the count of the katuns And years [note continued from preceding page] of katun 11 ^hau, or 1556, and the fifteenth after the Spanish reached Merida. Although early, it is a plausible date for the composition of this text. As noted above (note 1366), the preceding year was 1 Ix, initiating the second half of the calendar round. 1393.1 believe this is intended as a refinement of the vague date 11.15.0.0.0 cited earlier, hence 11.13.6.0.0 (1467), or shortly after the fall of Mayapan. It is quite possible that major monumental construction was indeed suspended at about that time. 1398.1 don't know of anyone who has tried to count the pyramids of Yucatan in modern times, and 6,050 seems like a lot of pyramids. Depending on the area included, it could come to something like five to six pyramids per square mile, or one pyramid for every one hundred or so people. But if small \"mounds\" are in-cluded, the figure might be credible, and it would be just like the Maya to have counted them. Lukci te Viroa* Chac u nes U ch'ibal 1418. Vi. suppose it t 15.

To the south here In 3 Ahau: At Zuyua Was the seat of the katun 1765 In the 3 Ahau Katun. 1739. The katuns are numbered clockwise and the directions counterclockwise on this katun wheel. The premise seems to have been that the direction points remain fixed while the wheel is rotated counterclockwise, thus bringing each katun in turn to its seating in the east, beginning with 11 Ahau. Roys 1967: 132, note 1 assumes that the katuns are named by ending date, which was true in the Tikal calendar (before 1539). In the colonial Mayapan calendar they were named by initial date (Edmonson 1976). The list of katun seats that follows is a later in-terpolation, possibly belonging to 6 Ahau (1717). The last three seatings disagree with those on other lists. Since I cannot date the passage firmly, I have left it here.

Thus was the burden of the younger brothers: To come in In the 7 Ahau 1900 Katun, Bringing back pain, Bringing back suffering, J 1897. \"Younger brothers\" is a metaphor for Maya as opposed to Spaniards, but also for peasants as opposed to nobles. The decision of the Itza to declare Chichen Itza a capital (tan cah) and collect tribute in its name produced immediate resis-tance from the Spanish and the Mayan nobles of the west and the peasantry every-where. It docs not appear that this move was justified calendrically or mytho-logically, nor is it clear how the accommodation between the Spanish and the Xiu nobility worked. \"Chichen Itza\" continued to collect tribute (or tried to) until late in the eighteenth century."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"^F II8 THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY T u patán tac yax cul He x tac pul ex y alan patán Carnal cabehe Ti tali Mehen ex e Ch'a a ba ex A manç ex u cuch num ya Lie u talel yam a canal ex e He ix katun Ti culhi lae U (. . .)

This is the Xiu counterattack against the Itza: convert to Christianity and accept Spanish rule, a proposal which must therefore have been reasonably ad-vantageous from the Xiu point of view. 1926. Here the older brothers arc the Spanish, but the reference to the capital is a scarcely veiled attempt to make the Xiu nobility senior to the Itza.

Melchisedek is identified as a Christian priest and Puc Tun as a Mayan one, the implication being that what follows is universally accepted truth. 1997. Kay is 'song'; kaay is 'sermon'. 1998. The uinal is the sacred cycle of twenty named days that form the base of all the larger cycles of the Mayan calendar. Its birth is the birth of time itself. 2003. Personification and deification of the world, mundo in Spanish, is a wide-spread conception among the colonial Maya. It is not clear why these particular relatives are singled out. They are all women, of course, searching for a male god. 3 Ü Cay alah Cay a!; Bal bin c : Ca bin C u than» Tamuk Minan uini Ca tun Te Ti likin Ca hop'i y Mac ti i Uay Lae He y ocot Lae P'iz t a u < Ci bin i Ca bin u p TiD*. c Lay u chun Xoc lah Lae Lah ca< Lay tzolan Tu mer 2006.

And then they arrived There At the east. 2015 And they began to say, \"Who is it that passed By here, Now? Here are his tracks, 2020 Right here. Measure them with your foot According to the word of the planter of the world.\" Then they were to measure the footprint of our Father Who is the holy God. 2025 This was the beginning of saying The count of the world by footsteps. This was 12 Oc. This is the account of his birth. 2030 For 13 Oc occurred, 2006. Mu is 'sibling's spouse' but here it would appear to refer specifically to '(?older) brother's wife', possibly reflecting the levirate. The term may also have applied to father's sister, as the scansion suggests. 2008. The answer to all questions is the riddle of the Word, in this instance the word 'man' (uinic), which also means 'twenty' and shares its root with uinal. The root uin by itself means 'model, being'. The road is important too, as the Maya conceived time as a road on which the gods traveled endlessly, carrying by turns the burden of 'fate, time, and the sun'—all of which are meanings of the word kin. 2014. All things begin in the east with the rising sun and proceed counterclockwise. 2021. The day name 'foot' (Oc) provides a punning rationale for the 'measure-ment' (elsewhere 'pacing') of time. It may also have been selected because it is a member of a set of potential yearbearers (Chicchan, Oc, Men, Ahau) who are the focus of the still extant cult of the Burners. See lines 2161 ff. Perhaps they were the yearbearers in some ancient version of the Mayan calendar. 2022. Roys has 'the mistress of the world'. Col is both 'wife' and 'plant'. 2024. This is the Christian god, Sp. Dios. 2026. Another pun: xoc lahcab oc is 'count 12 Oc'; xoc lah cab oc is 'count the whole world (by) paces', as Roys 1967: 116, note 11 points out. 2030. The days 12 Oc and 13 Oc are 40 days apart in the tzol kin, or 40 years apart in the calendar round. They would be 120 tuns apart in a hypothetical katun cycle based on Oc, but there is no evidence that such a cycle ever existed."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"122 THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY U nup tan ba y oc Likci ob Te Ti likin e Ca y alah u kaba Ti minan u kaba kin cuchi e Ximbalnahci y etel u chich Y etel u tz'e naa Y etel u mim Y etei u muu Ci uinal Çihci kin u kaba Çihci caan Y etel luum Eb haa Luum* Tunich Cihci u bal kaknab Y etel luum Hun Chuen u hokçici u ba* T u kuil U mentci caan Y etel luum CaEb* U mentci yax eb Emci Likul Tan y ol caan Tan y ol haa Minaan Luum Y etel tunich Y etel che Ox Men* U mentci t u lacal bal Hi ba hun bal U bal caanob Y etel u bal kaknab Y etel u bal luum And they matched each other's paces And arrived There At the east. 2035 They said his name, Since the days had no name then, And he traveled on with his mother's mother, And his mother's sister, And his father's mother, 2040 And his sister-in-law.

Chuclum Tz'itz' is the fifth of the 13 Gods (Tizimin, line 585), perhaps lending his name to the katun in honor of Merida's seating it (Ti Ho 'at five'). Roys 1967: 147 construes this whole passage quite differently. Beginning with line 2477, he omits che ychil, apparently considering it a copyist's error, then reads: 'Behold, within seven score years Christianity will be introduced amid the clamor of the rulers, those who violently seize land (during) the katun. Then suddenly ap-pears the wise man; then there is the examination of the katun'. The passage is a difficult one, but Roys and I agree that what is involved is the confrontation of the Mayan test of orthodoxy—the examination system—and the Holy Inquisition. Chuen Coy apparently flunked the Mayan exam. I have no idea who the 21 lords were, but I don't think Roys is justified in converting them into a verb. 2496.1 believe this to be a direct reference to the Long Count date 11.17.0.0.0 11 Ahau.

On the other hand On the 20th of August In the year 1541 V( 1564 M), I have made a demonstration Of the names of the years, And there began Christianity here, In 1519 V (1546 M), It came to the sixth roll of years And approached The eleven count of years. There was an agreement with the aliens. This was so as to pay for the waging of the war of the aliens And for the residence of people Here in the villages. Thus the captaincy of the villages occurred then: It was so as to pay this back. Again As I have written In the year 1541 V (1513 M) There first arrived the aliens in the east At Ecab by name.

At the first beginning Of the time Of the years Of the katun period Of katun 11 Ahau V( 13 Ahau M). When they destroyed the Itzas, It was three hundred years before The coming And arrival of the aliens. Destroyed was the town of the Plaza; Destroyed was the town of Kin Chil, Coba; Destroyed was the town at Chichen Itza; Destroyed was the town at outer Uxmal, And to the south the towns of Uxmal: Cib, as they were called, and Kabah. Destroyed was the town of Zayi, And Pakam, And Horn Tun, Which is a town of Tixcalomkin, And Ake And Ake Gate. Destroyed was the town of Emal the Great, And Izamal, Where there descended The daughter Of the True God, The Father of heaven: The Queen, The Virgin, 2751. Roys 1967: 81 suggests zacal actun 'white cave/white building'; I think it is zac lac tun 'white flat stone' and believe it refers to the Plaza of the cycle seat, in this case probably Mayapan. Elsewhere it is associated with Merida and Valladolid. 2752. Unlike Roys 1967: 81, note 9,1 believe Kin Chil 'sun face' is a personal name of a ruler of Coba who was Jaguar in 2 Ahau. 2755. Cib, Kabah, Zayi, and Xcalumkin are all south of Uxmal. 2758. Roys 1967: 82, note 4 identifies this with Tepakam, northwest of Izamal. 2770.

Then came the great ones, 2790 The Itzas here. 5,200 Was the number of their thousands, And nearly 6,000 The number of their hundreds, 2795 The great actors and heretics, The Itzas. So thus sickness was to come to their breasts, And likewise suffering came To their backs 2800 And breasts then. Thirteen measures of corn per head Was their bill, And then nine almuds, And then three feet of their corn. 2805 Many village girls Became prostitutes 2776. Kak Mo was an 8 Ahau lord associated with Izamal, Uxmal, and Champoton. 2788. The previous passage syncretizes several time periods: a legendary de-struction of cities in 4 Ahau, the appearance of the Virgin of Izamal and the teach-ing of Christianity in 9 Ahau, and the prestige figure of Kak Mo from 8 Ahau, all in order to magnify the opposition to the Itza seating of Emal, which took place in 5 Ahau (1599). The reference to Emal is a further confirmation of the date of com-position of this text. 2794. 11,200 Itza is a lot of Itza, but then they constituted the aristocracy of thirteen out of the eighteen Mayan provinces.

Sixteen hundred years Is the end of their lives, 2820 And three hundred years Follow.

It now shifts to the north (always counterclockwise). You can get to the sea from Merida in any of three cardinal directions, but north is the closest. The general public—orphans, the poor, widows, even witches—is sum-moned and a deluge of water is released. This symbolizes both the power of the rain gods, who are equated with the yearbearers, and the power of baptism. The yearbearers announce that baptism will subjugate Yucatan and justify the cal-endrical mystique. 3101. It is time for another procession. It begins in the north, confirming the implication in the preceding note, and moves to the west and south and back to the center. The South priest Xib Yuy (personal name) carries the sacred tree to the north, west, and south. The latter two are symbolized by appropriately colored birds.

Correct calendrical order would have required these lines after line 3212, but the order already given (lines 3201 ff.) is the same. Perhaps the death gods were expected to be aberrant. 3219. A ritual banquet ensues that symbolizes the food and drink (i.e., the fate) of katun 3 Ahau and commemorates (line 3284) the inauguration of 11 Ahau.

'bloody water'} is another name for Tula. It is used here to draw the mantle of the Toltecs over the ritual language of the Mayan examination system. Perhaps a better analogy than examination would be the secret ritual of the Masonic order and other kindred groups. A Mayan priest aspiring to high office was supposed to be noble on both sides of his family and also well educated, particularly in genealogy and religion. The riddles of Zuyua were a ritual test of this. Presumably they were not taught to the plebs, or \"younger brothers,\" as the Maya would put it. They were a standard part of the ceremonies inaugurating a katun. The riddles of this and the following chapter have been numbered in the translation for easy reference. There are 77.

On high four paces had gone by, Nine paces were then the burden to come on high, 4395 And that is the two-by-two pacing Rising from the face of the earth: Four paces Then branch off from the face of the earth. 4383. The pattern of dates that follows does not have a definitive solution and appears to contain at least two errors. The day Eb can never fall on a day 13 Ch'en (line 4385). And I believe line 4392 should read ox lahun '13' rather than lahun '10'. Even without this second correction, however, lines 4393 and 4394 clearly place us in katun 3 Ahau (1618). I have searched in that katun for a point at which these dates might make some sense. I find it in 1620. In that year 13 Etz'nab 5 Uayeb was the day before the beginning of the Mayan year on 1 Cauac 1 Pop. The first occurrence of a day Eb would be thirteen days after that, on 1 Eb 14 Pop. The only occurrence of the day Eb in the month of Ch'en would be on 5 Eb 14 Ch'en and the next day would be 6 Ben 15 Ch'en. Perhaps this is the date in-tended in line 4385, but its significance is not obvious. The Julian date would be December 21','which was considered the midpoint of the Mayan year.(see line 1365). Thus the dates 13 Etz'nab and 13 Ch'en may refer to the beginning and the middle of the year 1620. (Parenthetically it may be noted that if we correct this date to the Gregorian calendar we reach December 31. There is no evidence that the Maya used the Gregorian count before the nineteenth century.) A final consid-eration relates to the assertion that the seating of the land occurred on 13 Etz'nab. It should have occurred at the seating of the katun in 1618. It may be significant that Akbal is the fourth day after the beginning of the months in 1620, while Eb is nine days after that. However, the only occurrence of 4 Akbal in that Mayan year falls on 4 Akbal 5 Ceh, or January 22, 1621, the eve of Candlemas. This text is identified in line 4547 as having been composed in Mani. It may indicate that the Mani sun priests of the 1620s were not what they had been. 4394.1 read this as a katun date: 3 Ahau was the fourth katun in the cycle that began with 11 Ahau, leaving nine katuns to go to complete the cycle. 4398.1 believe the two-by-two pacing refers to the seating of the direction priests, two of the foot and two of the hand (note 3127)."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"' • red e occurred church aven. paces, one by, the burden to vo pacing f the earth: the face of the lution a day 13 her than id 4394 for a point /ear 13 i 1 Cauac 1 onl Eb 14 : on 5 Eb date in-would be ce line ng and the rect this ence that nal consid-13 Etz'nab. ignificant while Eb is ayan year i.

The association of this katun with Kin Chil and with Coba is pure con-vention (see line 631). 6189. Identifying Coba as the seat of the cycle as well as of the katun implies the collapse of die whole cycle system, an appropriate event for this final katun of the cycle and of Mayan history. While the Maya continued to count katuns and to write history, they wrote no more katun prophecies. 6192. Roys 1967:134, note 7 implies that these are god names. I believe the Jaguar and his Spokesman either had or took on high prestige names to bolster their faltering claims to authority. 6198. The implication is a fifty-year famine. 6201.1 believe the assertion is that Yax Chac was to seat the following katun.

Much of the structure of this text appears to repeat the prophecy not only of 11 Ahau, thirteen katuns earlier, but also of 1 Ahau, eight katuns earlier. The reason may be that the author may have been reckoning as much in calendar rounds or Christian centuries as in katuns. There was a calendar round beginning in 10 Ahau in 1685, which is referred to in the 1 Ahau prophecy (line 5060). Three calendar rounds later we come to another in 11 Ahau in 1841, which may be al-luded to in the present text (line 6483). Whatever the reason, the 1 Ahau prophecy refers (1) to a certain Saúl (2) who aided the bishop in imposing the Inquisition (line 4937) and who was joined by (3) Don Antonio Maninez (line 5064) to support the rights of the Christianized nobility in 1 Ahau (1638). This was the katun of the Chan War of Tihosuco (line 4944), but there is also mention of (4) the War of Havana and (5) thirteen-sail ships (line 4990). All of the numbered details are re-peated in the present text, except that here the bishop becomes the archbishop. It is asserted that the rigors of the Inquisition are not to be repeated. People are ad-vised to retreat to the woods to avoid the archbishop but to remain Christian."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"itry. the word ender your ito the wild, urrender, cd. id die /er, rmr he awareness )e said. :xpect it soon, ie gods have y of the gods leone who is a ; wild îecy not tuns earlier, in calendar id beginning 5060).

Truly! After fourteen years Of his office, There will be a god 6350 To arrive as Son. That is Don Antonio Martinez And Saúl. These were his names when he departed From heaven. 6355 And it was he Who came To Tizimin. He was in Tizimin, And it was he 6360 Who asked a queen to marry him. And it was the seventh: That was the year That he seized the marriage registry. Then he opened 6365 The money doors In the four-room house. It was shown to him, And then he set out to build Ships 6370 Of thirteen sails. And then he raised a war With the land of Havana. 6347. The date implied is 1838. Martinez' story is strongly reminiscent of that of Santiago Iman, who was imprisoned in Tizimin in 1838 (Reed 1964). 6352. Nothing is known of Antonio Martinez or Saúl from Spanish sources. 6357. As with all other Nahuatlisms in these Books, it is the southern dialect, Nahuat, that is employed, hence -tan for -tlan. Now the second largest city of Yucatan, Tizimin is not mentioned in the Books before the nineteenth century, when it became important as a livestock center. I derive the name from ti 'at' tzimin 'horse' and Nahuat -tan 'place'. 6360.1 believe the date 1831 is implied. The queen is a picturesque and totally obscure touch. 6370. Ships have slowly added sails throughout history, but it is not until the frigates of the late eighteenth century that they attain thirteen or more. The clip-pers of the early nineteenth century had three times that number or more. Even British ships-of-the-line in the Napoleonic Wars had fewer than thirteen sails (Ward 1973). 6372. The Havana connection and the French connection (line 6426) are diffi-cult to explain, the more so since the former is explicitly mentioned in a text of two centuries earlier (note 6323).

He was ordered seized, Just as he arrived At Tizimin.

Cuba was a hotbed of Yucatecan politics during and after the Revolution for Independence (1821) and at least one episode involved Tizimin at about the right date (ending in 1838; see note 6347). In an uncanny way, Martinez' prophecy (below) also foreshadows the outbreak of the War of the Castes at the end of this katun (1848) and that, too, involved Tizimin (Reed 1964). 6391. The rest of the text is hard to follow because it starts out in third-person narrative quoting a conversation between Martinez and his jailors—two cap-tains—whom he enlists in his cause. At line 6425, however, it shifts to first per-son and Martinez himself is speaking, quoting a conversation between himself and the \"king\" and giving his prophecy for the coming battle and for the katun. To clarify the matter I have added indications of who is speaking. The king is identi-fied as rey in the Chumayel but as nacom 'captain' in the Tizimin. The latter makes more sense. No doubt he was a \"king's man,\" since he was Martinez' jailor at the outset, but he underwent a change of heart and turned over the town to Martinez. Direct discourse ends at line 6466, and Martinez continues with his ser-mon, addressing the reader and the general public."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"•vord 'ana. the ears is word. of the • nandant of the seized too. :nt there, ed. his captors left. zed, \"Go on, man,\" nee I arrived,\" nee you left, on ee months since n irons. poleonic Wars •olitics during •isode involved in uncanny he War of the in (Reed 1964). n third-person -two cap-is to first pcr-:en himself r the katun.

A Ceremonial Circuit ¡75 17 .63 .03 ¡17 85 86 i61 55 86 65 ibrary. An :ic Collection ie by The-esent where-in Spanish English 1882; Mar->hed by Ste-1882; Escalona iton 1882; /lediz Bolio 133,1893; i; Carrillo 75, 1904, Lines 771 through 1080 in chapter 12 (one of the longest texts in the Chumayel) record a ceremonial circuit of katun 11 Ahau (1539). The cir-cuit is generally counterclockwise and except for its starting point at P'ool on the east coast it is confined to the area of the modern state of Yucatan, moving along the north coast past Merida, then making a south-ern sweep through Uxmal to Valladolid. The circuit then ceases to be a ritual counterclockwise definition of boundaries. It wanders through Izamal and vicinity, then heads south to Mani, north to Merida, south again to Mayapan, and back to Merida. Of the 171 place-names men-tioned, about half can be located (see figure 44). The remainder, being named in approximate geographical order, may be located more or less ac-curately by the use of the accompanying map and the index. The reference numbers give the order of appearance of each place in the text. It is rea-sonable to suppose, for example, that Tah Aac (number 19) was located someplace between Tz'ul A (number 17) and Coohjnumber 20), perhaps closer to the latter, while Pib Haal Tz'onot (number 18) may be closer to the former (see lines 822-825). Approximately forty-one of the places named lie within twenty miles of Merida and about thirty within an equal distance of Mayapan, whereas only eighteen are that close to Izamal and only fifteen to Valladolid. The western bias of the text (which almost certainly comes from Merida) seems obvious. A confirming datum is the surprising omission of Chichen Itza from the list, since Mayapan and Uxmal are included and Chichen Itza is mentioned elsewhere in the text. It is significant that the Xiu identify themselves with an eastern origin point when the Itza don't. The Xiu allied themselves with the Spaniards (who came from the east), something the Itza refused to do. Acan Ceh, 162 Ake, 2, 116. See also Hoi Tun Ake A1A,3 Bac A, 31 Bal Che.
