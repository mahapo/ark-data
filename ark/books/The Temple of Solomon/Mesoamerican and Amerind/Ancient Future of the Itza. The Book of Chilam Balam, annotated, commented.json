The first is to the U.S. Postal Service for having lost my Roys Chumayel in the mail. Without that, my collaboration with Victoria R. Bricker might have been less close and less productive. She can now have her Roys back together with my gratitude for her tact and energy as critic, adviser, and colleague. I am also returning Harvey M. Bricker's pocket calculator with equal gratitude for his getting hooked, however briefly, on the Mayan correlation problem. For help with the Mayan language I am indebted to Eleuterio Poot Yah of Hocaba and Merida, Moises Romero Castillo, Marshall Durbin, Fran­cesca Merlan, and the late Robert Wauchope, who, as director of the Middle American Research Institute of Tulane, provided funds from a Ford Foundation grant to help with the formation of a working dictionary. Thanks go also to the students who worked on that project-Thomas Langdon, Robert Moore, Maurice Onwood, and James H. Rauh---'and to a number of other stimulating students, particularly Marla Hires, whose interest got me started on the Tizimin, as well as Malcolm Shuman, Philip Thompson, and Marcia Jordan Thompson, whose research in Yuca­tan has provided me with a form of vicarious fieldwork. I am grateful to Tulane Ui1iversity and the National Endowment for the Humanities for a summer grant that enabled me to complete the transla­tion and to Arthur Welden for including me in the Tulane Yucatan Collo­quium that got me to parts of the peninsula I had never visited. The generosity, hospitality, and assistance of Alfredo Barrera Vasquez and Joann M. Andrews during my visits to Yucatan are profoundly appreci­ated. The helpful and creative labor of the late Marjorie LeDoux, director of the Latin American Library at Tulane, has been invaluable to me over many years, specifically so on this project. Finally, I should like to thank my wife, Barbara Edmonson, for letting me make free of her time and intelligence over many years, with the promise that I'll get back to cutting the hedge (and she can get back to her own research) before another uinal goes by. ix"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"GULF OF MEXICO : AHKINCHEL CEHPECH \\ ., , I� Zuyu'tt •Tz'itz'omtun � �� 1\\). : \\ ;Jxil X I Mo�l ,••'\"' ' \"' I ' I a al • Meriqa (::) ... ,,, : z I? : : ht*�>n � u\\ 0 f�Tfcoh '* '�� e 11., .,�.,, t '.,, CHIKINCHEL : ,.,{' ; Tizimin X 6zhtz'il ; : .,�<Ht�$ctt��t Chanceno& 41 TASES ' ����,.� .. �� ..

They are exasperatingly difficult to translate and interpret for a number of reasons. They are largely composed in archaic and elliptical language. Their chronology is obscured by esoteric numerological, astrological, and religious assumptions. The orthography of the surviving texts leaves a great deal to be desired. But most of all the Books reflect a world view and a sense of history that are distinctively Mayan. An additional complication to the comprehension of these Books is the fact that they are by no means pu!ely Mayan. They have been shaped by almost a thousand years of cultural confrontation-five centuries and more of ideological friction between the Yucatecan heirs to the Classic Mayan civilization and the invading groups of Nahuatl speakers from Central Mexico, followed by an almost equal period of conflict and ac­commodation between the Mexica-Mayan cultures and the European civilizations of Spain and Republican Mexico. The resulting history is dramatic and dynamic and reflects the influence of at least three thor­oughly different cultures. Among the twelve surviving Books, the Book of Chilam Balam of Tizimin is the most historical. Others come from Mani, Calkini, Ixil, Chumayel, Kaua, Teabo (three of them), Tekax, Oxkutzcab, and Tusik. The Tizimin was collected by the parish priest of Tizimin, Manuel Lu­ciano Perez, who sent it to his bishop in Merida in 18 70 with the remark that it had been in his possession for a number of years (muy buenos anos) (Barrera 1948: 291). The original is now in the Museo Nacional de Antropologia in Mexico City. I have worked from a photostatic copy in the Latin American Library at Tulane University. All of the forty-two texts of the Tizimin except chapters 9 and 22 to 25 are parallel to pas­sages in one or more of the other Books-those of Mani, Chumayel, or Kaua, all of which include additional materials of a less historical order: medical, exegetical, astronomical, liturgical, or literary. Taken by itself, however, the Bool< of Tizimin constitutes an outline history of Yucatan from the seventh century to the nineteenth, with explicit coverage of each lz atun (approximately twenty years) from 1441 to 1848. This is history in the Mayan manner. It is dominated by a sense of cyclical repetition and by a profound faith that correct calf1drical calcula­tion will enable the priests to predict the fate of the next cycle. In most instances the cycle in question is that of the katun, a period of 7,200 days xi"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"xii INTRODUCTION (or twenty tuns of 360 days each). It was to be expected that each katun would repeat the fate of the preceding such period with the same numeral coefficient, there being thirteen sacred numerals to the count (see the appendix). The Tizimin itself makes it clear that the priests were ex­pected both to predict and to record the events of each lz atun. The predic­tions (chapters 6, 9, 14, and 15) were taken seriously as guides to policy, and the recordings of recent events were taken seriously as guides to further predictions. The predictions, customarily drawn up five years be­fore the beginning of the lzatun, were announced at his inauguration by the Jaguar (Balam)-its ruling lord. But it was also his duty (or that of his Spokesman-Cbilam) to write the history of the katun five years after leaving office, as a basis for future prophecy. The burden of the Boolz of Tizimin may thus be accurately described as prophetic history-as the ancient past and the ineluctable future of the Mayan people. Given these highly Mayan assumptions, the history of any one lz atun may be taken as equivalent to that of any other with the same number. There is no linear order to prophetic history. Nonetheless, I have found it possible to identify the primary reference of each passage of the Tizimin in European linear time, at least to the nearest twenty years, and I have therefore rearranged the passages in at least approximate historical order. A reader who wishes to follow the order of the original manuscript may do so by reading my chapters in the sequence listed in the table. Folio numbers are indicated together with corresponding passages in Barrera 1948 and Roys 1967, and folios are also indicated in the Mayan text of the present edition. There is usually, however, no way of judging the priority of several texts relating to the same katun. The plausibility of this reor­dering is indicated in the figure, which demonstrates that the incidence of Nahuatlisms (see \"Nahuatl\" in the index) appears to be roughly constant through (linear) time, while the incidence of Hispanicisms (see \"Spanish\" in the index) increases exponentially throughout the reordered text. Those texts I have placed as preconquest may have been preserved in oral or hieroglyphic form, and it is my belief that none of them was written in Latin letters before lzatun 9 Ahau (1559-1579). Immediately after the Spanish conquest (that is, around 1548), the Fran­ciscan missionaries to Yucatan, like those in the Valley of Mexico some­what earlier, began instructing the children of the nobility in Spanish, Latin, and Mayall:, and the Mayas promptly became literate in European alphabetic writing. The earliest surviving text known to me is a passage of the Chumayel written in 1556 (Edmonson 1976), but sections of the Tizimin were not written much later. The extant manuscripts of the Boolzs are, however, later copies, and internal evidence (see note 5155) places the final composition of the Mani, Tizimin, and Chumayel manu­scripts around 1824 to 1837. •Various parts of the manuscripts are included in these extant versions in different orders, and some may have circulated independently for a time in oral, glyphic, or alphabetic form. There are • consequently lexical, orthographic, semantic, and syntactic discrepancies among the texts that are suggestive of their varying histories. Thus, where the Tizimin has aJwu (line 5368), the Chumayel has rey, a lexical substitution. Where the Tizimin has Hauana (line 5366), the Chumayel has Havana, an orthographic one. Where the Tizimin has hum pis lz atun (line 5202), the Chumayel has lahun piz lcatun, a semantic change (from"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"8 7 <rJ QJ .s 6 t-l \"0 QJ � 5 � [l 4 � <rJ \"0 '\"' � 3 5=(1 ..... 2 QJ '\"' 0 j;l.; 1 \\ INTRODUCTION 8Ahau SPANISH NAHUATL 4Ahau 11 Ahau 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 European Dates in Hundreds of Years 'one l<atun' to 'ten l<atuns'). And, where the Tizimin has conolbil (line 5304L the Chumayel has conbil, a syntactic variation (implying some­thing like 'marketing places' rather than 'marketplaces'). Obviously a close comparative study of these texts would be most rewarding, but such a study has not been undertaken here. The Translation With minor exceptions, the orthography of the Mayan text is that of the original manuscript. To facilitate typesetting I have changed ctJ. to ch ', a to tz', and Jl to y etel. With the exception of some marginal notes (see chapter 24) apparently added in the mid nineteenth century, the Tizimin appears to have been recopied in a single hand, probably between 1824 and 183 7 and probably in or near Tizimin itself. Word divisions are not standardized in the manuscript and I have made my own, but in no case have I altered the original order of the letters. xiii Some of the late texts (chapters 24, 25, 39, 40, and 41) are written in a relatively straightforward style. But all of them are in the poetic form of couplet parallelism that is customary in formal Mayan discourse (Edmon­son 1971). They have been so transcribed and translated. Except in the chapters just cited, there is an additional poetic element: the extensive use of kennings or difracismos (Garibay 1953). Each particular couplet has both an obvious and a synthetic or esoteric meaning, which some­times applies to many couplets at a time. Examples are listed in the index under \"kennings.\" Hence I have found it necessary to prepare an inter­pretative prose translation, which is presented first and w]lich is keyed to the corresponding numbered lines of the literal translation and the Mayan text and to the notes that follow.

I do not pretend to understand them all, but perhaps this mode of presenta­tion will enable others to understand the basis of my judgments and to push on to further clarifications. The scansion of Mayan poetry is complex because the principle is se­mantic. When it waxes lyrical, as in prayers and dramas, the couplet structure may be tightly signaled by a strict parallelism of syntactic form, with analogous or identical noun and verb inflections in the paired phrases. In other cases the structure may become quite loose. For exam­ple, a locative adverb like te 'there' may be paired with a locative noun phrase like ti ho 'at Merida'. Since one cannot scan it until the meaning is clear, scansion and translation form a kind of dialectic. If one of them becomes derailed, the other is bound to. I am aware that I have achieved neither perfect scansion nor perfect translation, and there are cases in which I have been poetically inconsistent. I remain uncertain, for in­stance, whether direct discourse falls inside or outside of the couplet structure, and I have sometimes made two lines in one context of an expression which appears as one line elsewhere. I remain persuaded that Mayan formal discourse tends strongly to couplets, whether or not they are syntactically marked. There are good and bad couplets, but I believe searching for them is in either case a significant aid to translation and an important aspect of the translator's task. The Bool<. of Tizimin has not been adequately translated before. The only other complete translation (Makemson 1951) is so seriously flawed that I have not tried to use it (see note 1570 and the review in Thompson · 1951). Barrera Vasquez has a draft translation which I have not seen. I have consulted a transcription and a partial translation and notes by Roys (n.d. ). The most relevant published works are Barrera's 1948 translation of the reconstructed text, based on the Tizimin, Chumayel, Mani, and Kaua versions, and Roys' 1967 translation of the Chumayel. In addition, the First Chronicle (chapter 1) has been translated and published by Brinton (1882) and Martinez Hernandez (1940). I have commented on these trans­lations where relevant in the notes. Students of the Books of Chilam Balam will have noted the really extraordinary discrepancies between one translator and the next (see notes 5 79, 1239, and 15 70). I cannot but agree with Barrera that these are texts of quite unusual difficulty. The Papal Vuh is a model of explicitness and clarity by comparison. All scholars who wrestle with colonial texts in the Indian languages of Middle America must cope with archaism and homonymy-multiplied by textual, orthographic, and lexicographic in­adequacies. But these texts are purposely obscure. They are not intended to make sense to outsiders-and they don't. I have the highest regard for the previous scholarship in this field, \" particularly for the contributions of Barrera and Roys. It is with diffidence that I dare to disagree with them. But it may be that many of the dis­crepancies are a consequence of method. I have chosen to translate the Tizimin blind, without prior consultation of the previous attempts or prior knowledge of the detailed parallel Spanish history of Yucatan. My endeavor was to gain an unbiased and presumably Mayan-or at least"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"I INTRODUCTION endogenous-view of the work. I believe I have done that. While my confidence has been shaken or my interpretation changed by some items of subsequent reading, others have encouraged me to stick to my guns. In learning Yucatecan Maya, I depended first on the production of a general dictio:t;J.ary incorporating all entries in Brasseur 18 72, Pia Perez 1866-67, Swadesh, Alvarez, and Bastarrachea 1970, Blair and Vermont· Salas 1965, and Solis Alcala 1949, plus additional vocabulary from Roys 1931 and 1967, Redfield 1941, Tozzer 1941, and a substantial part of the Motul dictionary. I then prepared a root dictionary of my own (Edmonson n.d.b). I have also consulted Martinez Hernandez 1929, Pacheco Cruz 1969, and Pia Perez 1898. I lay no claim to speaking the language, but the language of the Tizimin is no longer spoken in any case. Besides the problems presented by the copyist's errors, the manuscript gives no reliable indication of vowel length and no real phrase or sentence punctuation or word division. Furthermore, the language is archaic. Even the latest passages are about 150 years old, and the earliest ones may go back 500 years or even more. In the First Chronicle, for example, we read: uac Ahau chuc cu lumil Chakan Putun (lines 49-52). If my translation is correct, this would be expressed in modern Maya something like: tz'oc u cubsic ulumil Chakan Putun e le uac Ahau i 'six Ahau finished the seating of the lands of Champoton'. The form le 'the', which is ubiq· uitous in modern Maya, does not occur at all in the Tizimin. The rare verb chuc strikes me as archaic in comparison with tz'oc 'finish'. Modern Maya would almost certainly use some form of cub, cui, or cut for 'sit, seat' rather than cu, which is also an archaism, and it would make freer use of pronouns (u) and demonstratives (e, i). While the verb-object· subject ordering of noun phrases is not compulsory in modern Maya, it is much the commonest. Verbs with aspect markers ( c, h, t ), which I believe to be the only true verbs in Maya, together with fully expressed pronominal subjects and objects, are the exception rather than the rule in the Tizimin. There is instead a marked addiction to participial and substantival constructions depending for their verbal force upon the Mayan lack of the verb 'to be'. Thus (lines 170-175): ox lahun tun man i tz'ulob u yax ilc ob u lumil Yucatan 'thirteen (Ahau) then (was) the passing (of) the foreigners; (it was) their first sighting of the lands of Yucatan'. The style of the older texts particularly is terse but elegant. They are meant to be read and pondered rather than skimmed over or recited. I have tried to translate as literally as possible, representing every linguistic element of the Mayan text in English to the degree I could. Although indications of subject and object are often delayed for several phrases or clauses, leaving a literal translation quite stilted in English, I have none· theless followed the Mayan order of things in order to preserve the coup· let structure of the original. Every couplet in turn is represented in my interpretative translation, also in order, although I have felt free to alter the syntax to render more clearly what I think the text means. I have not changed the order of the ideas, but I have changed passive and participial to active constructions, broken the sentences at different points, and in· traduced my own paragraphing. Not all details are preservfd in the inter­pretation, but they will be found in the literal translation, the Mayan text, and the index. XV"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xvi INTRODUCTION The Itza What follows is a summary of the substantive content of the Book of Tizimin. It is not footnoted because the Book itself is the documentation for the assertions made. Specific points may be tracked down in the index, and additional references are provided in the notes to particular passages. If aspects of this treatment sound unfamiliar to Mayanists, that is because I find reason to disagree with a number of traditionally ac· cepted viewpoints. Specifically, these include the interpretation of the colonial calendars, the nature of the post-Classic and colonial political and religious systems, and the relationship between the Xiu and the Itza. The Boolzs differentiate clearly between the Chichen Itzas and the Peten Itzas, but they call them both Itzas. The story of the Tizimin is the story of the Itza or Water Witches, a group of elite lineages who dominated the eastern half of the Yucatan Peninsula in the post-Classic and colonial periods. It is also the story of the katun, since the Itza claim to have established Chichen Itza as the seat of the thirteen-lwtun cycle (may) in l<atun 8 Ahau (672-692). Ac· cording to the Tizimin, the Itza were joined a century later by the Toltec Xiu, a grouping of similarly elite lineages who dominated western Yucatan and Campeche until the seventeenth century and who claimed an ancestral seat at Tula itself. I believe these traditions to be essentially mythological as they relate to the Classic period butfind no reason to mistrust the account from the tenth century on. The Itza and the Xiu agreed that the right to seat the cycle conferred upon the city that did it dynastic and religious primacy over the whole country for 260 tuns (approximately 256 years). At the end of that time 'the primate city and its road and idols were ritually destroyed, and a new cycle seat was established. The Itza and Xiu disagreed, however, on the correct timing of the cycle, the Itza maintaining that it ran from 11 Ahau to 13 Ahau and the Xiu insisting that it went from 6 Ahau to 8 Ahau (see the appendix and the index under \"calendar\" and \"cycle\"). In 6 Ahau (948-968L the Itza seated the cycle in Champoton, where they ruled until the following 8 Ahau (1185-1204). Presumably under Xiu pressure, they destroyed Champoton and spent forty years wandering in the wilderness, finally settling at Chichen Itza. In 2 Ahau (1244-1263 L the Xiu of Uxmal and the Itza of Chichen Itza compromised and agreed to seat the cycle at Mayapan, which was centrally located and was to be ruled jointly. This alliance, known as the League of Mayapan, lasted until 1451. When the fateful katun 8 Ahau came around again (1441-146lL the Xiu governor of Mayapan, Hunac Ceel, entered into a conspiracy with the illegitimate Itza lord of Izamal, Can Ul, overthrowing and sacrificing the Itza rain priest of Chichen Itza, Xib Chac, and capturing and destroying . Mayapan in 1451. The Tizimin gives a katun by katun account of Mayan \" history from this time down to the lzatun before the Caste War of the middle nineteenth century. In addition to the mystique of the l<atun cycle, the l<atuns themselves were religiously and politically important. The seat of the cycle enjoyed an overall preeminence, but the actual rule of the country was vested in the lord of the l<atun, the Jaguar (Balam) and his Spokesman ( Chilam ),"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"I INTRODUCTION xvii and was supposed to rotate among the subsidiary cities. Commonly more than one city claimed the honor, which conferred tribute rights, control of land titles, and appointments to public office. Even the ruined cities lent their prestigious names to the seating of the l<atun, and at various dates between 1461 and 1539 the privilege was claimed by Chichen ltza, Izamal, Uxmal, Tihosuco, Coba, and Emal. Early in the sixteenth century, the war of the katuns-or l<atun of the wars ( u l<atun katunob )-between the Xiu and the Itza was exacerbated by the arrival of the Spanish. The result was a formal bifurcation of the politico-religious system and, coincidentally, a major calendrical reform, which was promulgated at the beginning of 11 Ahau: 11.16.0.0.0 (1539). The ltza continued to consider Mayapan to be the seat of the cycle, and they seated the katun at Emal. The Xiu established Merida as the seat of both the cycle and the katun. In effect, the peninsula was divided into eastern and western jurisdictions along a north-south line running right through Mayapan. A new calendar was announced at Mayapan, with new yearbearers, a new count of the twenty-day uinals (from 1-20 instead of 0-19), and a count of the l<atuns by initial date rather than by terminal date (see the appendix). This calendar, universally used by the colonial Yucatecans from 1539 to 1752, is in agreement with Landa's statement that the Mayan new year fell on Sunday, July 16, 1553 (see Edmonson 1976). The Flower l<atun 11 Ahau thus initiated a new Itza cycle, which was also the cycle of the Spanish Empire and ended very nearly with the empire in 1824, at the end of 13 Ahau. The ltza of the sixteenth century found themselves embattled on several fronts, being opposed by the Span­ish secular and religious authorities, the Xiu nobility, who found it conve­nient to become Christians, and the merchants and peasants of both the east and the west (often also Christianized), who objected to paying trib­ute to the Itza as well as taxes to the Spanish. Lowborn claimants to the lordship of the katun sprang up everywhere, supported by rebellious guer­rilla companies in the woods who made it dangerous and eventually impossible for the legitimate lords to complete their ceremonial visits to collect tribute and confirm titles. Few lords of the katun completed their terms of office. The military companies were not brought under control until the middle of the seventeenth century, and peasant rebellions con­tinued long after that. The Xiu had a long-standing tradition of accommodating foreign cul­ture. They were considerably more Mexicanized than the Itza even in the post-Classic period. After the conquest they accommodated similarly to Christianity and attempted to justify· their stance in terms of Mayan prophecy. By the early seventeenth century, they apparently had lost in­terest in the Mayan political game and did not claim to seat the katun after 1 Ahau (1638-1658). Merida had become the Spaniards' city. The Itza were more resistant. From the outset of the Spanish conquest they were troubled by the possible implications of the European calendar, particularly by the seven-day week, which (leap years being ignored) ap­peared to represent a new class of yearbearer that the Maya hadn't thought of. While the Xiu tried to accommodate the Mexican fifty-two year divinatory cycle and the Christian year by inventinla twenty-year (rather than twenty-tun) \"katun\" (see chapter 22), the Itza clung to the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"xviii Pencil drawing of restored structmes at Mayapan, Yucatan, by Ta ti ana Proskouriakoff.

Even the ltza had to give way, however, and in 1611 the Itza lord of the l<atun, 01 Zip of Emal, converted to Christianity. This was in the fourth l<atun after the corresponding conversion of the Tutul Xiu of Mani, but the Xiu and the ltza had always been four l<atuns apart. By 3 Ahau (1618-1638), the ltza had managed to incorporate the Chris­tian week into their cosmology, and the Tizimin gives the auguries of the days and the detailed divinatory significance of each day as a yearbearer • (see chapter 25). While the Xiu were being assimilated as a peasant pro· letariat in and around Merida, the Itza lords were becoming independent peasant farmers in the eastern areas, increasingly preoccupied with weather, harvests, and the agricultural calendar. Nonetheless, they re­tained a lively interest in theology and in the traditionall<atun calendar, and they continued to read and ponder their prophetic histories."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"I INTRODUCTION The Itza took their prophecies very seriously indeed. One group which had fled south after the fall of Mayapan and resettled at Tayasal on Lake Peten rejected as calendrically premature the efforts of Cortes in 13 Ahau (1539) and of Fuensalida and Orbita in 3 Ahau (1618) to Christianize them. But when the appropriate lzatun 8 Ahau approached (1697 -1717) they knew the time was right, and in 1695 they sent an embassy to Merida to ask the governor to convert them. Obliging with their usual obtuse alac­rity, the Spaniards arrived before 8 Ahau began and forced the Indians into armed opposition. But true to the prophecy it was in 8 Ahau that Tayasal was conquered. (For a detailed documentation of this event, see Bricker 1981.) In 1752, five years before the end of katun 4 Ahau, the Itza resolved upon another calendrical revision. It happened that in that year the name day of the katun fell on the second day of the Mayan year. Furthermore, the Itza cycle was due to end two katuns later, in 13 Ahau, with apoc­alyptic implications. The priests calculated that, if they redefined the katun as a period of twenty-four years instead of twenty tuns, they could always celebrate the seating of the lz atun on its eve, on the Mayan new year. If they further redefined the cycle (may) as twenty-four such lz atuns beginning from the 11 Ahau of the conquest, it would not end until 2088, a distinct advantage over surrendering legitimacy in 177 6. Katun 4 Ahau was therefore reseated in 1752, hence lasting for thirty-nine years, and Valladolid (Zaciapan) was made the seat of the new cycle and also the seat of lzatun 2 Ahau (1776-1800). Just as the Mayapan calendar of 1539 ad­justed Mayan terminal dating to Mexican initial dating, the Valladolid calendar of 1752 adjusted the Mayan calendar to the Julian one. The cost was the final abandonment of the true katun and hence of the Classic Mayan Long Count dating (see the appendix). Despite the brilliance of the Valladolid calendar, there may well have been Mayas, including Itzas, who remained uneasy about 13 Ahau, the traditional end of the Itza cycle. One such may be responsible for the aberrant fifty-two-year calendar of chapter 41, which appears to have been designed in 1758 and may be identified with Coba. It retains the year­bearers of the Mayapan calendar but alters their numeral coefficients by twenty-one years (presumably the twenty-one years between the begin­ning of 4 Ahau in 1737 and the writing of chapter 41 in 1758). There is no evidence that this calendar was adopted by anyone but its author. Other similar experiments occurred sporadically in Mayan history: see the twenty-eight-year cycle of the early seventeenth century (lines 3531 ££.). A further experiment of this type may be implied by the marginal notes to chapter 24, probably added in 9 Ahau (1848-1872), which give Type I yearbearers and an ecclesiastical calendar attuned to the Gregorian one (see the appendix and Satterthwaite 1965). The final chapter of the Tizimin continues to identify itself as Itza in the very last line. But this is a new Itza cycle that is initiated in 1824-or so its author appears to believe. It claims the mantle of all the gods, the privilege of prophetic vision, the tradition of the Spokesmen of the Jaguar Priest of the katun, and the aegis of the 4 Gods, yearbearers and rain giants of the four directions. It honors Mayapan and Chrfstianity. And it predicts and records the ending of tribute to the Spaniards as well as the Caste War. xix"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"XX INTRODUCTION Perhaps the most startling aspect of the Boolz of Tizimin when it is viewed historically is the autistic disjunction between Mayan and Span­ish views of the same broad epoch. There are consistent correspondences on numerous points, but the focus of attention is totally different. The Spaniards chronicled their entradas, the sequences of their officials, their laws, discoveries, and conquests. They themselves appear in Itza history, however, as an annoying but shadowy and largely irrelevant presence, alluded to by nicknames. Their tribute was regarded as a temporary bur­den, destined to be returned at the appropriate time. The thrust of Mayan history is a concern with Indian lords ai1d priests, with the cosmology that justified their rule, and with the Indian civil war that was perceived as the real dimension of colonial history. In effect, this is a secret history. Certainly the Spaniards remained largely oblivious to the continued existence of a traditional Mayan gov­ernment in Yucatan and ignorant of the ideology that supported it. It is astonishing to learn from the Tizimin that the ancient Mayan cities­Mayapan, Uxmal, Chichen Itza, Coba, even Merida itself-continued to serve as symbolic reference points for a lively and indigenous religious and political life centuries after their pyramids had fallen into ruins. It is startling to find Chichen Itza still collecting tribute in the middle eigh-teenth century! · Even though these pages depict its decline, Mayan civilization here presents us with a strong sense of continuity, sophistication, and vitality. While we cannot read Itza history as a direct guide to events of the Classic period, the ideology of cyclic history doubtless both preceded and followed the period that is here described. And the end of the cycle is not yet."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THE SEVENTH CEN TURY \\"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"From the end of the Xiu cycle in 692 to 751, and then came the end of the Itza cycle in 771. {10) / 8Ahau 1.

This text, together with the two other early chronicles in the Mani and the Chumayel (Barrera 1948: 68 ff.; Rays 1967: 139 ££.), is unquestionably the oldest sketch of Mayan history we have. While the Chumayel contains one text that can be dated to 1556 (Edmonson 1976), it is likely that nothing in the Tizimin was transcribed from glyphs before 9 Ahau (1559). A glyphic version of this chronicle could have been composed in 13 Ahau (1539) but could also have drawn on glyphic predecessors. I consider the claim of the Itza to have ruled Chichen Itza (and that of the Xiu to have come from Tula) in 8 Ahau (692) to be legend or myth, but the tale seems to be substantially historical from the following 8 Ahau (948) on. See the appendix on chronology. All the earliest chronicles are preoccupied with the sequence and dates at which various cities became the seats of the cycle. Taken together, the sources provide us with the following outline.

Chac Na Bi Ton: the East priest (Chac) and chief of the Toltec Xiu. The prefix Na 'mother' commonly introduces the matronymic, in this case Bi 'roll', and the patronymic comes last: Ton 'lame'. Barrera 1948: 59 and Brinton 1882: 144 consider this a place-name. The place-names of Yucatan are difficult to identify and often difficult to locate (sec Roys 1935). Frequently they are introduced by the locative ti 'at', and the names of many of the smaller towns follow this with Ix 'little'. A few towns have monosyllabic names; more commonly the name is inflected or compounded, and names of four or more elements are not unknown ( ti Ix Pet on Cab, ti Ix Kil ltzam Pech). Numeral prefixes of unknown significance occur occasionally: Hun Uc Ma, Cabil Neb A, Ox Cum, Can Uat Hom, Ho Tzuc Chakan, Uuc y Ab Nal, Uaxac Tun, Bolon Ch'och', Lahun Chab Le, and Ox Lahun Zuyua. Numbers above 13 do not seem to occur. Otherwise, since there appear to have been eighteen provinces (see note 777), I would be tempted to guess that they were numbered in relation to the uinals. The numeral prefix is invariant over time for any one town. Classificatory elements are common in place-names: A or Ha 'water', Cab or Luum 'lands', Hol Tun 'water hole', Tun 'rock', Cab 'town', Ch'een 'well', Puc 'hill', and Tz'onot 'cenote'. Animal and plant names are frequent descriptive elements: snail, deer, turkey, iguana, alligator, puma, squirrel, bat, rabbit, dove, and skunk in the first category, gourdroot, balche, guano palm, caoba, custard apple, banana, chile, nance, corn, and ceiba in the second. Construction features occur occasionally: mounds, walls, ovens, and plazas. Color names with direc­tional associations are frequent. There is a surprising dearth of Nahuatl place­names. I have found only five: Tizimin ( Tzimen tlan), Mayapan, Yucatan ( Yuca­tlan), Valladolid (Zaciapan ), and Zuyua. The interpretation of personal names presents several difficulties (Roys 1940). While it seems likely that calendrical names were used even after the conquest, they are extremely rare. Examples are 7 Eb and 5 Xochitl. Numeral elements are sometimes prefixed to surnames without any accompanying day name, as in 8 01 Kauil, 11 Ch'ab Tan, or 7 Sat Ay. I believe these to be priestly titles. Occasionally a numeral appears to be used as a surname, as in Lahun Chan, Cab Bech', or Hun Pic. The typical naming system is binomial, and most commonly both names are monosyllabic, the first being a matronym and the second a patronym, as in Yax Cutz, Can Ul, Kak Mo, or Can Ek. Often the matronym is preceded by Na-Na Pot Xiu, Na Ahau Pech, or Na Puc Tun-but this appears to be optional. Some­times the name is preceded by Ah, as in Ah Muzen Cab or Ah Kin Chil, implying .priesthood or a collective: the man and his family. Women's names may very \" occasionally be identified by the prefix Ix, as in Ix Tab or Ix Kalem, but I believe that this element is far more commonly the simple conjunction 'and'. Both Roys and Barrera have in my opinion provided us with an entirely excessive list of goddesses. Very commonly either surname may take the suffix -il or -Vl, an abstractive, again with collective meaning, but this is also optional: Chac Hub, Chac Hubil or Ul Ahau, Ulil Ahau. Additional elements may precede or follow the name, appar­ently for differentiating people of similar names.

Again, higher numerals do not appear. Following the patronym, additional elements of a similar kind may be ap­pended, as in Na Tzin Yabun Chan: Tzin Yabun the Younger, or Hun Pic ti Ax: Hun Pic from Ax. A considerable ambiguity is created by the overlapping of categories of personal names, titles, place-names, day names, and colors. Thus Chac is a lineage name, a title (rain priest), a color (red), a place, a god, and an epithet (strong). Many of the traditional surnames have been continued into mod­ern times, which is sometimes helpful in identifying them: Xiu, Ay, Pot, Bak, Pat, Puc, etc. The commonest lineage names in the Tizimin are Can, Ku, Ay, Ahau, Hun, Tun, and Chan in that order. The runners-up are Chac, Hub, 01, Nab, Pat, Puc, Ul, Tz'itz', and Yan. 17. Mekat 'chief' from Nahuatl mecatl'tumpline', implying a cargo bearer or bearer of the burden of the lw tun. The title appears to be restricted to the Xiu, but the concept is Mayan as well: public office is a 'burden' (cuch). 18. Tutul Xiu 'Toltecs', traditionally the rulers of Uxmal'windfall'. The name is significantly bilingual: Nahuatl totollin 'many reeds', with the Mayanized Nahuatl explanation xiu 'grasses'. It identifies an elite ethnic group rather than a lineage or a person. The Xiu were the nobility of the western half of the Yucatan Peninsula and were more influenced by Nahua and Spanish ideology than were the eastern Itza. They claimed identification with Nonohualco, Zuyua, Chico­nauhtla, and \"the great city of Tula\" (Barrera 1948: 57-58). 20. That is, Bi Ton arrived in Yucatan one year before the end of 13 Ahau (771). Barrera 1948: 59 adds these ninety-nine years to 2 Ahau to arrive at 5 Ahau (1106). 21. We return to the starting date for the second time: 692. 23. Chi Ch'en Itza 'mouth of the well of the witches of water', the best known of the Mayan cities and the traditional seat of the Itza.

Tzucub Te 'grove of trees', a sacred grove, the most famous of which was always at the cycle seat, in this case Chichen Itza. 26.

This occurred at the end of 8 Ahau or the beginning of 6 Ahau (ca. 948). A period of 40 years in the wilderness may have intervened. Being the seat of the cycle (may cu), as opposed to the seat (hetz') of the katun, theoretically established dynastic preeminence for a period of 260 tuns (ca. 256 years). The Chumayel gives Chichen Itza the full 260 tuns; the Tizimin awards it 200; the Mani strips it to 120. Doubtless, political differences are in­volved, but the terminal date is not affected. Chakan Putun 'meadow swamp' is the modern Champoton. Barrera 1948: 140 translates the name as 'plain of putun \" 'chiles'. Putun also means 'Chantal' (Rays 1935: 4). 46. Otoch 'home' contrasts with na 'house' as a dwelling place as opposed to a residence. On\\0 implication may be that the Itza formerly lived in Champoton. 48.

If preferential cross-cousin marriage obtained (Eggan 1934), Can Ul's mother's brother might have married his father's sister, producing a relationship through his father, as the text claims, to Ul Ahau (2). Such a relationship would be either too close (incestuous) or too distant to war­rant succession: Can Ul's father and his father's sister would have to be Ul Uls. As the retiring lord was presumably, older, it is also possible that Ul Ahau (3) was the brother of Can Ul's paternal grandmother who married incestuously.

The \"first wheel\" is Itza and goes from 1539 to 1824. The \"second wheel\" is Xiu. It goes from 1539 to 1677 and then adds the prophecies for the preceding cycle, 1441 to 1539. The Itza cycle corresponds to my chapters 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 16, 18, 21, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 39, and 41; the Xiu cycle comprises chapters 11, 13, 17, 19, 20, and 23. The first eight katuns in both cycles correspond chronologically and depict the Xiu devotion to Merida and the Itza devotion to Mayapan as seats of the cycle. In the first seven of these katuns, Merida claimed to seat the katun as well and was opposed by one or another Itza center. When 8 Ahau was reached, the Xiu priests returned to the preceding katun of that name and gave us the text before us. There is no reason to suppose that it is not a transcription of a preconquest glyphic prophecy, probably made in 9 Ahau (1559). 352. Can Ul of Izamal succeeded Kukul Can as lord of the katun and Ul Ahau as governor of Izamallate in 8 Ahau (1461). His lordship did not last long, and the following katun was seated at Uxmal.

An interesting prophecy which seemingly tries to mediate between the Xiu and Itza cycles by setting up one that is halfway between them.

Na (A)hau Pech 1lord tick' was an Itza prophet, a sun priest1 and1 according to the Mani1 gran sacerdote of the late fifteenth century at Chichen Itza. See also Tozzer 1941: 42. The Ahau lineage was prominent there and at Izamal1 and the Pech lineage is notable slightly later at Merida. 408. The time of remembrance of ancestors is the end of one katun and the beginning of the next. Katun -ending monuments were regarded as ancestral commemorations (natabal). 410.

Sun priests were nobles in both lines: al mehenob, women's children and men's children of known lineage. They also underwent extensive training and were ranked by achievement as well as birth. The less distinguished were rele­gated to the practice of medicine, sorcery, and consultative divination. Those of higher rank became lords (ahauob) and took on the burden of public office. The highest-ranking priesthood was that of the Jaguar (Balam), who governed the entire country for one katun as the representative of the Sole God (Hunab Ku). Landa 1929: 1: 72 calls him the sun priest of the cycle (ah l<in may). He was seconded by his Spokesman ( Chilam), and together they manifested the comple­mentarity (and friction) of variously named dualistic gods. On a different time scale were the rain priests of the four (or sometimes five) directions, who repre­sented the yearbearers or Fathers of the Land (Ba Cabob), also identified with the rain gods ( Chacob). Each city had its own directional priesthoods. More obscure are the priesthoods associated with the 9 Gods of the underworld and the 13 Gods of heaven, but these too were local, as were the priesthoods of the high gods who were patrons of the twenty sacred days. Few of these gods or priesthoods are clearly specified in the Tizimin, nor is their rank explicated, though they were almost certainly ranked. They included the priests of Itzam Na, Quetzalcoatl, Ah Puch', Ix Tab, Uayab Zotz', Itzam Cab Ain, Ix Ch'el, and Muzen Cab, all of whom are mentioned, and there may be a number of others whom I have failed to recognize. These various priesthoods were no doubt subject to considerable local variation in iconography; rank, and calendrical association. Some of the gods, for example, were also considered tute­lary, as Itzam Na was for Izamal, Quetzalcoatl for Chichen Itza, and Muzen Cab for Coba. Additional confusion is introduced by the strong Mexican influence, particularly in the west. 432.

The text alleges that Xupan Nauat (Nahuatl xopan nahuatl 'summer speaker') produced this prophecy in 1527, predicting the arrival of the Spanish in 1530. Perhaps he did, but certainly not in this form: it is very much influenced by knowledge of the Spanish invasion, even though it uses no Spanish words to describe it (except profeta in line 480). It was very likely written early in the following katun, though Xopan Nahuatl may have used some of the prescient expressions ascribed to him (e.g., line 489). From his Nahuatl name, one suspects Xopan Nahuatl of being a Xiu from Merida or Mani. Neither lineage name occurs elsewhere in the Tizimin. Tozzer 1941: 36 has further details. 483. Chilam Balam 'spokesman of the jaguar' was the speaker or \"talking chief\" under the lord of the katun, who was called the Jaguar because he wore a jaguar skin. Like other high officials-the Jaguar himself, the governors of the cities, the chiefs of the towns, and the occupants of all priesthoods-the Spokes­man was always a trained sun priest (ah ldn). He was also not only a prophet (ah bobat) but the official Prophet for a particular katun . Finally, he was expected to have the highest degree of training and expertise in religious and calendrical matters: he was supposed to be a sage (ah miatz). When disagreement arose over the prophecies, it was up to the Spokesman to resolve it. Failing that, a con­vocation of sages could be called. The authority of such a meeting appears to have exceeded that of the lord of the lw tun himself, and, though it was largely confined to the religious sphere, its ability to concert calendrical changes had a sweeping impact on political and economic affairs.

Eleven is important because it symbolizes the inauguration of the second half of the katun . Seven is a problem.

Katun 1 Ahau ends the half cycle of the seven odd-numbered lw tuns, and Emal served as the seat of at least three of these (11 Ahau, 5 Ahau, and 1 Ahau).

The administrative organization reflected in the Tizimin vested a loose hegemony over the entire Mayan country in periodic councils of sages (ah miatzob). After 1539 there were two seats of the cycle, Mayapan and Merida, and consequently two councils, dividing the country along a north-south line running through Mayapan. The highest official in each area was the Jaguar or lord of the katun, sometimes also called the Rattlesnake (Ahau Can), who controlled public offices, land titles, and tribute rights within his half of the country. Theoretically the two Jaguars (Xiu and Itza) between them ruled over the modern territory of Yucatan, Campeche, and Quintana Roo. The Jaguar and his Spokesman were the only really general authorities, and the latter was ex officio the registrar of lands (ah p'iz te) and the Great Sun Priest (ah nob ldn), in charge of the examination of public officials. Each major city was the center of a province, ruled by a governor (hal ach uinic). There appear to have been eighteen provinces.

Province boundaries fluctuated over time, so I am assuming that the boundaries were different when Chichen Itza ruled Sotuta, Mayapan ruled Hocaba, Zotz'il ruled Tases, and Uxmal ruled Canpech. Rays does not provide a capital for Ahcanul and doesn't identify Chab Le or Bahia de la Ascension as provinces. Tixchel and the Peten were not part of the Yucatecan system. Smaller towns and villages were ruled by headmen or chiefs ( ba tabob) and their assistants ( ah kulelob), and wards of the cities were ruled by counselors ( ah cuch cabob), according to Rays. All officials were supposed to be sun priests (ah kin), and they were presum­ably closely linked to the local levels of religious organization, headed by the directional priesthoods of the Ba Cabs, who seem to have been ex officio captains (nacom) for military and sacrificial purposes. The Ba Cabs of the lw tun seat thus served as Captains of the Jaguar. The local organization imposed by the Spanish is nowhere mentioned in the Tizimin either for the town ( cabildos, alcaldias, regidores ) or for the parish (co­fradias, maestros, sacristanes ). 782. Both Zulim Chan of Emal and Yaxal Chac 'green rain' of Merida claimed to seat katun 11 Ahau. The traditional opposition of east and west, Itza and Xiu, was compounded by the Mayapan calendar reform in 1539 and by the arrival of the Spaniards in Merida in 1541, as the texts of this period document. A new Itza lz atun cycle began, scheduled to span the colonial period ( 1539 to 1796, but later revised to run to 1824) and theoretically seated at Mayapan. The Xiu cycle was already underway ( 1461 to 1718), and an effort was made to seat it at Merida, which also claimed to seat the lw tun for the hundred years from 1539 to 1638. 787.

The ninth katun in the Itza cycle was the thirteenth in the Xiu count and vice versa. Each was thus in a position to claim identification with heaven and relegate the other to hell. Compare line 1094, in which the seven demons symbolize the Christian cycle. An additional significance to the preoccupation with cycles of nine and thir­teen is their relationship to the Venus year: 9 x 65 = 13 x 45 = 585, just one day more than the approximate Venus cycle of 584 days. Hence, in either series, the coefficient of the day that ends the Venus year progresses backward by 1 each time it occurs. This kind of mathematics corresponds to other similar equations discovered by the Maya: 52 x 365 = 73 x 260 (52 years equals 73 tzol kins), 72 x 365 = 73 X 360 (72 years equals 73 tuns), and 8 x 365 = 5 x 584 (8 years equals 5 Venus years).

The sense is that even widows and children of families of no account were carried off to be sacri­ficed at Emal. Doubtless it was difficult for the Itza to assault the Xiu strongholds at Merida and Mani after the Spanish were in residence there, so they turned their attention to the Xiu villages, consequently capturing few important nobles. 910. The reference is probably to Emal, which claimed to be the seat of lw tun 11 Ahau; see also lines 661-662. The counterclaimant was Merida (lines 778, 1171), but the present passage suggests the possibility that Izamal was also com­peting for the privilege. 922. The Xiu inaugurated the new katun in 1539 in their own way. The year began on 11 Ix 1 Pop (July 21). The Xiu ignored the Itza inauguration of the new katun on 11 Ahau 7 Uo (August 16) and initiated their own ceremonies on 3 Oc 17 Tzec (September 15), centering them on the terminal date of the old katun : 13 Ahau 7 Xul (November 4) and completing them on l Cimi 13J=h'en (January 9, 1540).

Ba Cab 'father of the land': the gods and priests of the four directions, identified also with the Chacs and the yearbearers. 927. What follows is one of many elliptical descriptions of ritual in the Tizimin. The ceremonial cycle was certainly both rich and varied, and like most of the rest of Mayan life it was calendrically organized. Some rituals were pegged to the life cycle, including naming, courtship, marriage, illness, induction into office, retirement, and burial. As time went on, much ritual was adjusted to the church calendar. At the outset, however, we may distinguish three primary ritual cycles: the tzol kin, the tun, and the hab. The tzol kin rituals emphasized in the Tizimin are the fire ceremonies of the Burners (ah toe), operating on a sixty-five­day cycle. The ceremonies governed by the tun are those that punctuate the lordship of the katun, mainly at five-year intervals: requesting office, taking the plate, making the ceremonial circuit, declaring the word of the katun, naming the remainder, suspending titles, and folding the mat (together with the ceremonial commemoration of ancestors). The rituals of the hab began with the new year and included at least one major ritual in each uinal, thus centering on a twenty-day cycle within the 365-day year. The most important ceremonies of all were the lz atun transitions every twenty tuns and the calendar round (kin tun y abil) transitions every fifty-two years. There is a continual play in the Tizimin between the Itza emphasis on tun and katun rituals and the Xiu emphasis on yearbearers and the calendar round. · 930. There follows a counterclockwise ceremonial circuit to \"flatten\" (i.e., subdue) the land-by confirming titles (see also note 216). Each direction is iden­tified by color and provided with an Imix tree, thought to symbolize cataclysm or destruction (Solis Alcala 1949: 57), from the east (red) to the north (white) to the west (black) to the south (yellow) to the center (green blue). 938. Kan Xib Yuy 'yellow male matasano tree' appears to be a mistake for Chac Xib Yuy, presumptively the priest of the Ba Cab of the east. The matasano tree is the Casimiroa. 942.

It is thoroughly obscure but seems to involve a directional circuit of four (E-N-W-S) plus five (E-N-W-S­Center), which then repeats.

Despite the eastern origin of the text and the uniqueness of its inclusion in the Tizimin, Kauil Ch'el was a Xiu, identifying himself with Xopan Nahuatl and Puc Tun as an adviser to the lord of Uxmal, Hun Uitzil. He is simply borrowing the identity of an earlier prophet of 9 Ahau, although we can't rule out the possibility that he moved to Bacalar in his old age. Kauil Ch'el's calendrical and divinatory theory is, from the Itza point of view, woefully primitive, and he doesn't understand the lw tun at all. He presents in­stead a year-by-year and calendar round (i.e., totally Nahua) view of the events he chronicles, using tun (360 days) for hab (365 days) and misdating the lw tun by five years. Nonetheless, his Mexican view of Mayan politics in this troubled katun appears to be well informed, and his comprehension of the Mexican calen­dar is excellent. See Edmonson 1976. 1550. 13 Kan is a year bearer in the Mayapan calendar in use in Yucatan from 1539 to 1752. The date 13 Kan 1 Pop (July 20, 1541, or July 7, 1593) is the date intended. Without the particle te, a date of 13 Kan 0 Pop would be implied. This is the twelfth year of a fifty-two-year cycle that began on 1 Kan 1 Pop in 1581. The first thirteen of these years are associated with the east and the color red. 1551. 'Taking the plate of the katun' is the preliminary initiation of the priest who will serve in the following katun, a ceremony normally to be expected five years before the l< atun is to begin-in 1598. 1552. Katun 5 Ahau in the Tikal calendar ended on 12.0.0.0.0 5 Ahau 13 Zotz', September 20, 1618. In the Mayapan calendar it would have been counted from its beginning, eighty days before the end of the classical katun 7 Ahau on 11.19.0.0.0 7 Ahau 13 Ch'en, January 3, 1599. Thus the author expected that katun 5 Ahau would begin on October 15, 1598, a correct five years after the 'taking of the plate'. 1553. The correlation is correct: 1593 indeed marks the initiation of a year 13 Kan and should have been the date for the anticipatory ceremony of the 'taking of the plate'. 1554. This final dating assertion is complex. It refers to a date of 4 Cauac 15 Tzec, ninety-five days after the Mayan new year on 13 Kan 0 Pop. This was the day of the \"dawn\" of the plate ceremony, that is, the eve of the ceremony itself, which took place on 5 Ahau 16 Tzec. This is an anticipation of the calendar reform of Valladolid: celebrating the eve was already customary. Note that these dates do not make sense unless the writer is beginning the year on 0 Pop. He is counting \"old-style.\" The cue that he is doing so is the absence of the particle te 'round' (cf. hun te Pop and line 29 77). The classifier p'iz has the same effect. The equivalent dates in the Mayapan calendar would be 4 Cauac 16 Tzec (uac lahun te Tz ec) and 5 Ahau 17 Tzec. Having put both counts into play the author proceeds to specify that he will use the Mayapan calendar (see note 1560). 1558. Sun time (kinil) and moon time ( uil) are constantly paired poetically in the Tizimin. In the present context, their normal order is inverted (see lines 1567 -1568). In the other contexts the sun begins what the moon ends; hence I believe the metaphoric assertion here is that the end (of the katun) was at the beginning.

The author is specifying which calendar he wants to use: that of Mayapan. 1563. In the sun: at the beginning. 1566. In a number of other passages the quetzal and the blue bird are paired, commonly as a poetic reference to the Itza and the Xiu. The allusion is to the Toltec traditions of Quetzalcoatl and Huitzilopochtli respectively. Other passages of the Tizimin make it clear that the eastern Maya objected to the western emphasis on the female line, presumptively a consequence of the stronger sur­vival of Mayan patriliny in the east. Accusing the westerners of matriliny, rather than merely of bilaterality, was an insult, but it was also a way of questioning their legitimacy. The Tizimin presents the eastern (Itza) viewpoint throughout. 1568. The normal sequence of sun and moon, like alpha and omega, implies eternity-all of time. Compare Quiche u be q'ih, u be zaq 'on the road of the sun, on the road of light'. 15 70.

The implication seems to be that an important lineage abandoned Akab P'ix to move to the north coast for the next thirteen-year period, initiated by the year 1 Muluc, which has the associations of white and north. From Chichen Itza the most likely place to describe in this way would be Emal. 1580. The reference is to the establishment of a new ceremonial cycle. The rain gods and the yearbearers were more or less equated. 1582. Uaan 'erected' could be a reference to stelae. 1584. That is, what had been written is now accomplished. 1586. The Flower time or Flower lw tun is 11 Ahau (1539), the period of the founding of Merida, the arrival of the missionaries, and the war of the katuns ( u lz atun lz atunob). It suggests the flower wars of central Mexico, and indeed the battles between the lords and the military orders in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries have very much that flavor. It also refers to the Mexican lords, the Xiu, since this katun marked the final triumph of the Central Mexican calendar and its initial counting over the end-dated Mayan katun. From the \"middle\" to the \"moon\" of this katun is a chronological reference to the decade 1549 to 1559. 1590. The \"word\" of Christianity will be actualized. Such an expectation of the efficacy of the Word is Mayan as well as Greek and Hebrew (see Edmonson 1971: line 2277) and is entirely consonant with the intention of the present document, which is to prewrite history. I read this line as repeating the chaan te of the preceding line. The image of the cross as the little tree or the high tree is frequent in the Tizimin. The eye (or face) of the sun is a pre-Columbian expression for the high god. 1592. While there are Mayan antecedents, the reference to the resurrection of Christ seems clear.

The return of the weekday two tuns later is obscure but is consistent with the prophetic text. See also line 1668. 1606. Clothes are a recurrent reference to Spanish conquest, presumably allud­ing to later Spanish sumptuary laws dictating the white blouse and pants for Indian men. 1608. This couplet is of interest as defining Spanish bilateral descent with patrilineal emphasis in the same terms used for the apparently similar rules of the eastern Maya.

It is relevant to note that the preceding expression Jdn tun y abil could be rendered 'sun stone sickness', a pun which cannot be ruled out.

It is very frequently, but not always, associ­ated with the year or the calendar round. Aside from this expression, the word \"Maya\" does not occur in the Tizimin until the eighteenth century. 2626.

Mayan ideas of measurement are closely linked to the use of numeral classi­fiers, of which the language provides an almost indefinite number. The generic units are a measure (p'iz) or a count (ocb, tzol, xoc). Linear distance is measured by the knuckle (p'uc, pic), palm (nab), span from thumb to forefinger (mab), foot (oc), forearm (lwk), waist (xoc), pace (cbek), arm span (zap), and man's length (ualah). Larger units are the mac of about 24 meters, blowgun shot ( tz'on), shout ( auat), post or rest (lub), and sleep ( uay). Horizontal distances are conceived of in length ( uat, uac) and width (hat); vertical distance, conceived of as a matter of levels (kaz, xay), is measured by the rise or step ( eb, tem) or fall (hom). Area concepts include the square (am) and circle (pet). Agricultural land is measured by the rope or cuerda (about 437 square meters) or by the day's labor (kin). Volume measures are the pinch of two fingers (nip') and three fingers (thuth), fistful (lap '), handful (kab), fold ( uutz') of about seven liters, armload (kal), and backload (cucb, patan ). Particular substances are counted by the containers in which they were typically carried, but these do not appear to,.be standardized. Weight and force are only vaguely specified.

In preceding passages (see line 2643) the author makes it clear that he is reading from a hieroglyphic manuscript, presumably a prophetic one covering the pseudo-katun from 1541 to 1561. It is not possible that this glyphic document was transcribed as early as 1544, as is implied below. Here, however, I think the assertion to be that he completed translating the glyphic prophecy on the date given but in 1596. 2980. 11 Chuen18 Zac (February 21, 1544, or February 8, 1596). The date cited is incorrect because it suppresses the leap year correction, choosing to relate the correlation to a base year 1 Kan 1 Pop, July 16, 1581. The author is aware that there is a seven-day error (the difference between this base and the true base year of 1 Ix 1 Pop, July 16, 1555 ), but he doesn't bother to note it. The correct interpretation of the date for the composition of the manuscript is therefore 11 Chuen 18 Zac, February 8, 1596. He writes the year 1544 to emphasize that he is basing his prophecy on the fifty-two-year cycle-but he is also aware that this involves a thirteen-day leap year correlation, which he also doesn't bother to enter. See also note 2410. I believe both dates, and the claimed authorship of this document, to be fic­tional. If there were a glyphic document for the pseudo-katun 1541 to 1561, it would presumably have been written around 1566. If the second document were the 'finished' word for the pseudo-katun 5 Ahau it purports to describe, it would probably date to around 1618 to 1623. Since it seems to reflect actual history in both katuns, I incline to the latter supposition. Kauil Ch'el, Xopan Nahuatl, and Puc Tun were already named in a prophecy for 13 Ahau (1539); see lines 562 ff., which, however, may have been put into present form as much as two katuns later: 9 Ahau (1559). Kauil Ch'el may well have been Spokesman of the Jaguar at the beginning of 9 Ahau (1559)-see note 1239-but I don't believe he prepared the present text in 1596, let alone in 1618.

He then goes back to 1533 (which began on 5 Kan 1 Pop) and adds three years, bringing him to 1536 (which began on 8 Cauac 1 Pop), then adds the two days to get to Imix. That lands him on 10 Imix 3 Pop, and he can then figure (though he does not say so) that Pul Ha died on 9 Imix 3 Ceh.

Both the dating and the interpretation of this text present problems. It is one of the earlier texts in the Mani, Chumayel, and Tizimin manuscripts and hence must antedate 1837, when Juan Pia Perez copied the Mani. The references to the French would appear to place it after the Napoleonic invasion of Spain, and the reference to the King of Havana as an enemy implies a date after the Revolu­tion of Independence in 1821. The text itself claims to come at the end of fourteen lz atuns of Spanish rule, which would bring us to 1848. I believe therefore that it was written early in katun 11 Ahau (1824-1848) and that our extant copies of the Mani, Chumayel, and Tizimin were written slightly later but in any case fall between 1824 and 1837. ,, 5159.

The tuns were counted by twenties, 20 tuns being a katun. Larger intervals of time were counted in two systems: by twenties (20 katuns being a baktun) and by thirteens (13 katuns being a may). The bal<tun or Long Count dating system does not appear directly in the Tizimin (though it does in the Chumayel); the may is featured prominently. The Tzol Kin . The numerological interaction of these cycles is com­plex, and the Mayan comprehension of it was masterly. The numerology of the tzol kin automatically produces cycles of 13 and 20-days. Among the permutations of the factors of these, the Maya were particularly im­pressed by cycles of 4 x 13, or 52, and 5 x 13, or 65, and they used those cycles (a fifth and a quarter of the tzol kin respectively) in divination and ritual. The tzol kin traditionally begins on 1 Imix, and it works out that Imix will recur 13 times within this cycle, or every 20 days. Because the count runs 1 to 13, then 1 to 7 (for a total of 20), Imix' second occurrence will have the coefficient 8, leading to the sequence 1, 8, 2, 9, 3, 10,4, 11, 5, 12, 6, 13, 7 as the coefficients of any particular day. Thus the numerals 1 and 7 come to represent alpha and omega to the Maya. The same sequence applies to the uinal and the tun for the same reason, as both are based on 20-day counts. The Hab. Because 20 goes into 365 18 times with 5 days left over, the first day of the year advanced by 5 days each year, and only 4 of the 20 days could begin the year (20 + 5 = 4). These were the yearbearers (ah cuch hab) or the four changers (can hel). The yearbearer that began the first month, or 20-day uinal, also started all the others. Different calendars used different yearbearers. The Zapotecs, for exam­ple, used their equivalents of Imix ( + 5 days later), Cimi ( + 5 days later), Chuen ( + 5 days later), Cib, or Type I year bearers (in Zapotec Chilla, Lana, Goloo, Loo). The Quiche and the Classic Maya used Type II (Ik, Manik, Eb, Caban; or Ik, Ceh, E, Noh in Quiche). The Aztecs used their equivalents of Type III (Akbal, Lamat, Ben, Etz'nab; or Calli, Tochtli, Acatl, Tecpatl in Nahuatl). The colonial Maya used Type IV (Kan, Muluc, Ix, Cauac). And the Type V set (Chicchan, Oc, Men, Ahau) is the focus of the Yucatecan Burner cyole of fire ceremonies, which fall automatically one day later than the colonial yearbearers. l Since 13 goes irrto 365 28 times with a remainder of 1, the numeral coefficient of the first day of the year advanced by one each year, thus I9S"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"APPENDIX producing a cycle of 13 years, and the same day appeared with the same coefficient only after four such cycles, producing the 52-year ldn tun y abil, or calendar round. In the colonial calendar used in the Tizimin, the calendar round began on 1 Kan in 1581, for example. The Mayan hab of 365 days, sometimes called a vague year, had 18 uinals of 20 days each and 1 uinal of 5 days, the dreaded Uayeb (?'specter steps'). These 5 were called nameless days (x ma kaba l<.in), although they were numbered and named normally in the tzol l<in count and in the hab count. This was the period of the year's end ceremonies, to be followed by those of the new year. The Tun. The tun, a period of 360 days, was divided into 18 periods of 20 days each and always began on a day Imix. Consequently, it also ended on a day Ahau. The numeral coefficients of these days followed the same sequence as in the tzol kin (1, 8, 2, 9, 3, 10, etc.), repeating after 13 tuns. The Katun. Tuns, however, were normally counted by twenties, and 20 tuns constituted a katun. Before 1539 the lzatuns always began on a day Imix and ended on a day Ahau, but in 1539 the system was changed so that they always began on a day Ahau and ended on a day Imix. In either case, the numeral coefficients of the Ahau days yield a cycle of 260 tuns or 13 katuns. The period of the katun (7,200 days) divided by 13 gives 553 cycles of 13 with a remainder of 11. Thus the sequence of the numeral coefficients of the lzatuns runs 13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2. The period of the half katun of 10 tuns (lahun tun), which was also cere­monially significant and which ran to 3,600 days, when divided by 13 gives 276 cycles of 13 with a remainder of 12. Thus if we count by half katuns we get a sequence of 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. The Baktun. The Long Count dating system of the Classic Maya was based on periods of 20 katuns, each of which equals 1 balztun. A typical Long Count date might be transcribed as 11.16.0.0.0, meaning 11 baktuns, 16 l<atuns, no tuns, no uinals, no days. (All these units were counted vigesimally from 0 to 19 except for the tuns, which were counted from 0 to 17, thus totaling 18.) Not content with this rather elegant and precise dating system, the Classic Maya usually recorded important dates in \"ini­tial series\" dating, giving the Long Count date, the tzol kin date, and the hab date, thus using all three of the basic cycles that have been described. The May. For most purposes this elaboration was not required, and the Maya were content to count lzatuns by thirteens rather than by twenties. This gives us a period of 260 tuns (or 260 years minus 1,300 days, 160 days short of 256 years). This cycle was called the may, or the lzahlay katunob 'account of the l<atuns'. The Maya stopped carving Long Count (balztun) dates on their monuments in 10.6.0.0.0 (948). What survived into colonial times was the may. A great deal of debate has gone into resolv­ing the correspondence between the may dating and the bal<tun dates, an essential step in correlating the Mayan and Christian calendars, with a pptential discrepancy of nearly 256 years always hanging in the balance. • 'The general relationship among these various cycles was well under­stood by the Maya. They realized that 73 tzol ldns equaled 52 habs (52 x 365 = 73 X 260). They knew that 72 habs equaled 73 tuns (72 x 365 = 73 x 360). And they calculated that 9 x 65 = 13 x 45 = 585, just one day more than the Venus year of 584 days! They concluded that they were right in thinking 9 and 13 to be important."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"THE MAYAN CALENDAR The Tikal Calendar. During the period represented by the Books of Chilam Balam, three different Mayan calendars were in use at different dates: the classical Tikal calendar from 692 to 1539, the Mayapan calen­dar from 1539 to 1752, and the Valladolid calendar from 1752 to 1848. Other calendrical proposals were made from time to time, but none seems to have caught on. The naming of these calendars is my own (Edmonson 1976), based on where they were first found or where they were inaugurated. The Tikal calendar appears to have been used throughout Mayan coun­try until1539 except for certain aberrant inscriptions, largely in the Usu­macinta Valley. It used Type II yearbearers, numbered the days of the uinal from 0 to 19, and counted katuns terminally. Its last lz atun, 13 Ahau, ended in 11.16.0.0.0 (1539). The Mayapan Calendar. The Xiu and the Itza, both Mexicanized groups of elite lineages among the post-Classic and colonial Maya, disputed the proper use of the may, a cycle which they believed legitimized political power. The Xiu wanted to end the may in 8 Ahau, which appears to have been the Classic Mayan view; the Itza wanted to end it in 13 Ahau. In or shortly before 1539, there was a calendrical congress to resolve this issue, which resulted in the promulgation of a new calendar, initiated in 1539. The Xiu compromised by accepting 11 Ahau as the beginning of a new cycle. The Itza compromised by accepting initial dating of the katun. The date was dictated by calendrical considerations: the conjunction of the cycles was unusually favorable to the change contemplated. The result was that, 80 days before the end of 13 Ahau in 11.16.0.0.0, the Itza inaugu­rated a new (colonial) calendar at Mayapan. It differed from that ofTikal in adopting Type IV yearbearers, numbering the days of the uinal from 1 to 20, and naming the katuns from their initial days rather than from their final ones. The Xiu initiated the same system at their own date in Merida. The result of this change was literally epochal. As in the case of the birth of Christ, Mayan dates before 1539 are counted backward from their endings, and those after 1539 are counted forward from their beginnings. The Valladolid Calendar. As dated in the Mayapan calendar, katun 4 Ahau began in 173 7. Five years before it ended, a new calendar was pro­mulgated, apparently at Valladolid. By calendrical coincidence, in 1752 the name day of the katun (4 Ahau) fell on the second day of the Mayan year. The Itza sun priests, who were due to be obsolete in 1776, figured out that by redesigning the katun as a period of 24 habs instead of 20 tuns they could fix it so that the initiation of future katuns would always fall on the second day of the year. Tidy enough. But, if they also converted the 260-tun cycle (the may) into a 11katun\" cycle of 24 katuns of 24 years each, they (or their descendants) could remain in office until2088! They therefore reinaugurated katun 4 Ahau on the 24-hab basis, ending it in 1776. In the Tizimin this system is used only in dates after 1752; in the Chumayel it was sometimes used retroactively, with disastrous (but trace­able) effects on some of the dates. The Arlo. The Maya thought it very clever of the Spanish to have a year of their own-they learned it rapidly and found it child's plRty. By the time Landa got around to asking them (in 1553) when their year began, they were able to give him a deceptively simple but correct answer: 197"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"APPENDIX Sunday, July 16. The 365-day cycle was nothing new to them, of course, and they had figured out how to handle leap years by reckoning them separately. Every Christian leap year day fell in a Mayan year with the yearbearer Ix, and the day 1 Ix initiated the second half of the calendar round in 1555. In the only really direct correlational statement in the Chumayel, written in 1556, it is clear that the July 16 correlation is pegged to the year 1 Ix, 1555 (Edmonson1976). The true Christian date can thus be reached by adding the number of Ix years for dates before 1555 or subtracting them for dates thereafter. The Maya did that in their heads but simplified matters by clinging to the July 16 correlation. It was not until the present century that the Europeans generally accepted the Goodman-Martinez­Thompson (GMT) correlation and acknowledged that the Maya were cor­rect (Edmonson 1976). The only direct correlational statement in the Tizimin, in a text writ­ten around 1618 to 1623, also dates the beginning of the Mayan year to July 16 but pegs this not to 1 Ix, the middle of the calendar round, but to 1 Kan, the beginning of it. This was 1581. But the priest who wrote this must surely have been aware that the true correlational date was half a calendar round (26 years) earlier (including 6 Ix years). All references to the Christian year in the Books are tied to the July 16 date for 1 Pop) the first day of the Mayan year. And that was true only for 1552 to 1555. The Julian Calendar. All the European dates are in the Julian calendar. Despite the promulgation of the Gregorian calendar by the pope in 1582, the Maya clung to the Julian one throughout. It is only in some late marginal notes of the nineteenth century that they began using Gregorian dates, which add ten days to the Julian ones. Since the Gregorian reform was accepted promptly in the Spanish world, this is an interesting docu­mentation of the autonomy of Mayan calendrical thought. The Week. The Mayan reaction to the 7-day week merits special com­ment. They realized promptly that the days of the week acted as year­bearers, constituting (leap years ignored) a 7-year cycle. (That is, the 365-day year contains 52 weeks plus 1 day.) Eventually they figured out that because of leap year these Christian \"yearbearers\" occur in cycles of four, and it takes 28 years before any particular 4-year set will be repeated. The number 7 was already important in Mayan numerology, so they comfort­ably added the weekdays and their planetary associations to the native astrology and used them for divination.
