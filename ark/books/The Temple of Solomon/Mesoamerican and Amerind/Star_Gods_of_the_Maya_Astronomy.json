In Precolumbian times, astronomy played a central role in calendarsand religious imagery. Art images and companion texts provide keys to understand-ing the thought processes of the ancient Maya. Rather than focusing on scientificaccuracy, many of the best documented astronomical images seem primarily con-cerned with divination. Maya astronomy is really astrology (Thompson 1972 : 77),but not in the sense of personal horoscopes. The astrological texts in the codicesoften deal with cycles of illness, the fate of crops, and weather. We may dismiss themas fanciful, but there is a similar folk tradition in ourOld Farmer’s Almanac.People today often cannot appreciate why astronomy played such an importantrole in ancient civilizations. For many of us, supplying our own food means cashinga paycheck and going to the grocery store. Our indoor environments insulate usfrom the more profound effects of the seasonal cycle. Our calendars tell us when theseasons will change, and we feel no need to watch the sun and stars as they followtheir seasonal course. Indeed, it is often difficult to see the night sky. Light pollutionfollows electricity, dimming the spectacular beauty of the stars.Astronomical gods form the core of the Precolumbian Maya pantheon. In thepast, some Mayanists have suggested that the Maya did not worship gods; ratherthey believed in spiritual forces. Karl Taube (1992b : 7 – 8) refutes this position in hisstudy of the Maya pantheon. Stephen Houston and David Stuart (1996 : 295) pointout that Classic period Maya rulers claimed divine status by using the names of godsas their personal names. And Patricia McAnany (1995a) shows that posthumousroyal portraits depict rulers merged with gods.As the most highly developed ancient civilization in all of the Americas, the Mayahad a sophisticated astronomy that was integrated with their religion. Like the an-cient Greeks, Romans, Hindus, Chinese, Mesopotamians, and Egyptians, the Mayabelieved that the celestial luminaries were gods who influenced human destiny andcontrolled events on earth. Whether Maya artworks show rulers dressed up as godsor the gods themselves is sometimes debatable, but there is no question that the stargods were invoked in Maya art for more than a thousand years. Precolumbian art,calendric cycles, and modern folklore can be integrated to tell the story of Mayaastronomy, placing the Maya in their proper position as one of the great civilizationsof antiquity.The Maya live in an area bounded by the Yucata ́ n Peninsula to the north, the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The 260-day calendar was used to prognosticate hu-man destiny according to the day of birth and to pre-dict the appropriate days for the planting cycle. Thisritual calendar survives today among the Quiche ́ofGuatemala, and the daykeepers still use the calen-dar to prognosticate future events (Tedlock 1992b).They explain that the calendar corresponds to thehuman gestation period of nine lunar months (Earleand Snow 1985). In fact, the interval is very close tothe length of the human gestation period, which bi-ologists estimate to be between 255 and 266 days(Aveni 1992b : 79). The 260-day period also approxi-mates the length of the agricultural calendar in coreareas of Mesoamerica (Chapter 1). Indeed, it is pos-sible that the 260-day agricultural cycle and the cycleof human gestation were linked together at an earliertime, and that the two cycles were used to developthe unique 260-day calendar.Over time, Mesoamerican cultures incorporatedother natural cycles in the 260-day calendar. DanielFlores (1989) notes that the 260-day calendar is wellsuited to recording observations of Venus. Indeed,the people of Precolumbian Mesoamerica observedboth Venus and the Moon in relation to the 260-daycalendar (Aveni 1992a). The cycles of Mars and otherplanets were also important in this calendar, becausethe 260-day period holds the key to correlating anumber of different planetary cycles (Justeson 1989 :82). Around 1650, Jacinto de la Serna described the260-day calendar of the Aztec as the ‘‘count of theplanets,’’ apparently referring to the seven classicalplanets, among which we find the Sun, the Moon,and Venus (Aveni 1991 : 310). Unfortunately, we donot have such direct references to astronomy in his-torical descriptions of the Maya 260-day calendar.Indeed, we do not even know the real name of thiscalendar. Although it is usually referred to as theTzolkin (count of days), this term may be moreproperly applied to the almanacs used for prognos-tications (Justeson 1989 : 76).Like other people of Mesoamerica, the Maya hada 52-year calendar called the Calendar Round. TheCalendar Round was formed by an interlocking cycleof the 260-day ritual calendar and a 365-day year(the ‘‘vague’’ year), divided into 18 ‘‘months’’ ofstate of Chiapas to the west, and the area borderingEl Salvador and Honduras to the southeast (Pl. 1).Numerous Maya language groups exist today, as intimes past. Yucatec, the dominant Maya languagein Mexico, is spoken in the Yucata ́ n Peninsula.The Kekchı ́ language is found over the largest geo-graphic area in Guatemala, but there are actuallymore Quiche ́ speakers. (For an overview of theMaya, see Michael Coe’sThe Mayaand RobertSharer’sThe Ancient Maya,which both provide de-tails about contemporary language groups, the cal-endar, and the geographic and chronological rangeof the Precolumbian Maya.)The Maya live in the greater Mesoamerican area,a large geographical region with its northern limitat the tropic of Cancer (231⁄27N latitude) in centralMexico and its southern limit in western El Salvador(147N latitude). Because the 260-day calendar wasonce found throughout the Mesoamerican area,there are many cognitive parallels between the Mayaand other areas of Mesoamerica, especially centralMexico. The central Mexican area, where Na ́ huatl,Otomı ́, and Totonac are spoken, spans the CentralHighlands and the mountains to the east, as well asthe adjoining coastal plain, and has its southern lim-its in the Balsas Basin (Carrasco 1969). The mostprominent Precolumbian cultures in central Mexicoare those of the Valley of Mexico, especially Classicperiod Teotihuaca ́ n and the Late Postclassic Mexica,the political group that dominated Aztec society atthe time of the European conquest in 1521. Thesoutheastern section of central Mexico, the Puebla-Tlaxcala area, seems to be the site of contact with theMaya during the Classic period. This region alsoproduced one of the greatest masterpieces of Post-classic art, the Codex Borgia, which records a core ofideas from central Mexico that may have influencedPostclassic Maya cultures to the east.THE MESOAMERICAN CALENDARIn Precolumbian times, the Mesoamerican areashared a 260-day calendar that was based on a re-peating cycle of 260 days. The origins of the 260-daycalendar can be traced back to circa 900 –500b.c.2INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"20 days each, plus an added five-day period. Thevague year only approximates the true length of thesolar year (365.2422 days). The interlocking cycle ofthe Calendar Round repeats in the same sequenceevery 52 years, because the least common multiple of260 and 365 is 18,980 days, or 52 vague years. Bothforms of calendar were present by around 500b.c.in Oaxaca and probably also appeared relatively earlyamong the Maya, although actual documentationexists only as early as 100b.c.(Justeson 1989 : 78 –79). The Calendar Round may have survived intomodern times, judging from a contemporary Cholterm (solq’uin) that refers to a cycle of 52 years re-lated to the sun (Aulie and Aulie 1978 : 106). NoMayan word for the Calendar Round is known, al-though Munro Edmonson (1988 : 14) suggests thatthe Precolumbian Mayan name for the CalendarRound ishunab.Mayanists tend to follow the convention of usingHaab for the 365-day vague solar year and Tun forthe 360-day civil year of the Long Count, but JohnJusteson (1989 : 77) cautions that the Tun in lowlandMaya probably refers to the end of a year of either360 or 365 days. The Maya 360-day Tun was an in-tegral part of the Long Count, a method of record-ing dates that allows dates to be precisely fixed intime from a starting point around 3000b.c.Al-though records of contemporaneous Long Countdates begin arounda.d.250 in the lowland Mayaarea, the Classic Maya clearly had a sense of mytho-logical history, for some Long Count dates on stonestelae of the Classic period refer back to events pre-ceding the recorded epoch of the creation around3000b.c.The oldest known Long Count inscription, datingto 31b.c.at Tres Zapotes in Veracruz, is actuallyfound outside the Maya lowlands. It belongs to theLate Preclassic period (400b.c. –a.d.100), when theOlmec civilization of the heartland in Veracruz andTabasco was in decline (Milbrath 1979). At this time,early Maya centers began to flourish. On the PacificSlope of Guatemala, dates as old as the 7th Baktun(Cycle 7) are known from Abaj Takalik and from ElBau ́ l, where Stela 1 bears a date of 7.19.15.7.12 cor-relating witha.d.36 (Graham et al. 1978; Sharer1994 : 102). Elaborate glyphic writing developed be-yond the Maya area during the Protoclassic period(a.d.100 – 250), as seen on the La Mojarra Stelafrom Veracruz, which bears Mixe-Zoquean writingand Long Count dates ofa.d.143 and 156 (Justesonand Kaufman 1993; Sharer 1994, fig. 3.6).Despite the early examples of glyphic writing out-side the Maya area, the Long Count calendar saw itsgreatest development in the Maya lowlands, wheremore and more interlocking cycles were added to thecalendar over time. Traditionally, the Classic Mayaperiod (circaa.d.250 – 900) is defined as the timewhen Long Count inscriptions were recorded inmonumental art in the Maya lowlands. By arounda.d.350, the Long Count inscriptions were accom-panied by lunar data of the Lunar Series (Chapter 4).Somewhat later other cycles such as the seven-daycycle and the nine-day cycle were added.The Long Count inscriptions are invaluable instudying the chronology of sculptures, and the pat-terning of dates has led to major breakthroughs inour understanding of historical events (Proskouriak-off 1993). Prior to the 1960s it was believed thatmany of the dates had a calendric function relatedprimarily to astronomical cycles and to a generalfascination with recording long cycles of time. Thehistorical perspective has revolutionized our under-standing of the Classic Maya. Nevertheless, scholarsrecognize that astronomy remains important in theinscriptions, for Maya rulers were fascinated by as-trology. As in the Old World, astrologer-priests cor-related events in the lives of rulers with celestialevents (Chapters 5 and 6).Classic Maya Calendar Round dates apparently in-volve no intercalation, and they are so closely keyedto the associated Long Count inscriptions that schol-ars feel confident in reconstructing Long Count datesin inscriptions that include only Calendar Rounddates. Such reconstructed Long Count dates are usu-ally determined by linking the Calendar Round datesto the reign of a specific ruler. This would seem tobe fairly clear-cut; any monument referring to theruler must be dated to the 52-year Calendar Roundthat falls during the ruler’s lifetime. But the situationbecomes more uncertain if his death date is notTHE MESOAMERICAN CALENDAR3"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"that can be distinguished from dates by the fact thatthey are given in ascending order beginning with theKins (Sharer 1994 : 570 –571).Most often the Classic Maya wrote dates in pairedvertical columns, beginning with the Baktuns on thetop, but scholars transcribe the dates horizontallywith the Baktuns on the far left. A date such as9.9.0.0.0 marks the end of a Katun, meaning all thesmaller periods have flipped over on the chronologi-cal odometer so that 9 full Katuns of 203360 dayshave been completed. This is called a period-endingdate. With 9 Baktuns and 9 Katuns completed, thedate corresponds to the beginning of the Late ClassicMaya period (a.d.600 – 800), or more precisely, toMay 7, 613, in the Julian calendar (O.S. [Old Style]),or May 10, 613, in the Gregorian calendar (N.S.[New Style]) adopted by Pope Gregory in 1582 tocorrect for a slow slippage in the Julian calendar inuse from classical antiquity. All dates given in thisbook are in the Julian, or O.S., calendar unless oth-erwise noted.To better understand the format of the inscrip-tions, let us look at the Initial Series date on the Ley-den Plaque, transcribed as 8.14.3.1.12 1 Eb 0 Yaxkin.It is designated with a vertical column of bar anddot numbers paired with glyphs telling the type ofperiod (Pl. 2). The bars stand for five and the dotsfor one, with the largest number on the top, herereferring to eight Baktuns (83203203360 days),followed in descending order by 14, 3, 1, and 12,each with a zoomorphic glyph representing theassociated time period, progressing from Katunsdown to Kins or days. There follows the Tzolkin date1 Eb (a dot with a skeletal jaw) and, three rows fromthe bottom, the month Yaxkin, with an implied co-efficient of 0, here shown as a small torso of a seatedfigure representing the seating of the month in theannual cycle of 18 months, which were numbered0 to 19. Using the 584,283 correlation, the date8.14.3.1.12 1 Eb 0 Yaxkin is equivalent to Septem-ber 14,a.d.320 (O.S.), or September 15, 320 (N.S.),the difference between the Julian and Gregorian cal-endars being minimal nearer to the time the Juliancalendar was introduced in Rome in 46b.c.The Maya calendar was by no means static, norwas it uniform throughout the lowland Maya area,secure, or if his life spanned more than one CalendarRound, as in the case of Pacal II of Palenque andShield Jaguar I of Yaxchila ́ n. Thus a certain amountof caution must be exercised when using dates de-rived from Calendar Round inscriptions.Although the Maya Long Count dates indicatethat there was no intercalation to keep the 365-daycalendar in accord with the seasonal events duringthe Classic period, there does seem to be an interestin the seasonal round, for a number of scholars havedetected sets of Calendar Round dates that focus onspecific solar events (Chapter 3). Furthermore, theLong Count seems to be keyed to an ‘‘end’’ date(13.0.0.0.0 4 Ahau 3 Kankin) on the winter solstice,December 21, 2012a.d.,when the ‘‘odometer’’ turnsover and a new cycle begins (Edmonson 1988 : 119).The Long Count records dates that involve setsof days: the most basic unit being individual days(Kins), followed by 20-day periods (Uinals), 360-dayperiods (Tuns), Katuns (203360 days), and Bak-tuns (203203360 days), a single Baktun referringto a period less than 400 years (400 years minus 2100days [2032035.25 days]). Some inscriptions areto be read in simple vertical columns from top tobottom (Pl. 2); others are written in two columns tobe read from left to right before moving down a row.Occasionally, inscriptions are read from left to rightacross horizontal rows, or more rarely from right toleft in a form of ‘‘mirror writing.’’ Usually the typeof reading order can be deduced from the calendardates.When Long Count dates appear with an intro-ducing element at the beginning of a text, they areknown as Initial Series dates (Pl. 2). On monumentswith multiple dates, the first date is usually an InitialSeries inscription. Such monuments usually includea dedicatory date, often coinciding with a Katunending or subdivision of the Katun (Satterthwaite1965 : 617). With the initial dedicatory date writtenout in full, fixed as a ‘‘base date,’’ the Maya used dis-tance numbers to count forward and backward toother dates, often given as Calendar Round dates. Thedistance numbers formerly were thought to be theproduct of a calendar correction formula more ac-curate than our leap years (the determinant theory),but these numbers are now known to be intervals4INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"although there were times during the Classic periodwhen there was a higher degree of uniformity (Jus-teson 1989 : 87 – 88). During Early Classic times (a.d.250 – 600), the solar year may have been especiallyimportant in calendar rituals, but by the Late Classicperiod, rituals began to revolve around the Katuncycle, especially at Tikal (Coggins 1980 : 736 –737).The Long Count coexisted for a time with theShort Count, which appears as early as 9.3.0.0.0 atCaracol (Satterthwaite 1965 : 626). The Short Countis not anchored to a base point, but repeats over andover, as if we noted our years in an abbreviated fash-ion, such as ’96, without clarifying whether it is 1896or 1996. The Short Count year was designated by theTzolkin date on which the Katun ended, and the Ka-tuns always ended on a day named Ahau, because ofthe mathematical relationship between the 20-dayUinal and the Katun of 7,200 days. Each Katun bearsan Ahau date numbered two less than the preced-ing Katun, thus the Katun 13 Ahau is followed by11 Ahau, and so on over the course of 256 years(1337,200 days or 256.26 years).Betweena.d.800 and 900, a number of sitesstopped recording Long Count inscriptions on mon-uments, one symptom of the ‘‘Maya collapse,’’ arather sudden decline of political stability in thesouthern Maya lowlands brought on by a varietyof factors. Endemic warfare seems to be evidentthroughout the Maya area during this period (De-marest 1997; Sharer 1994 : 346 – 347). Political in-stability and warfare may have been triggered by anextended drought (Hodell et al. 1995).The last Long Count inscriptions were recordedon public monuments during the Terminal Classicperiod (a.d.800 –1000; Sharer 1994 : 48). In thesouthern Maya lowlands, monuments recordingdates in the Long Count notation are found at rela-tively few sites during the span froma.d.830 to909 (10.0.0.0.0 to 10.4.0.0.0; Proskouriakoff 1993).Arounda.d.900, there is evidence of a shift towardinterest in year-ending ceremonies of the Postclassictype (Justeson 1989 : 113 –114). For example, atMachaquila and at Jimbal dates in the last monthof the vague year are designated as ending the year,indicating the 365-day year was becoming moreimportant.By the Early Postclassic period (a.d.900/1000 –1250), the intellectual center of Maya culture hadshifted from the southern lowlands to the northernarea of Yucata ́ n. Rather than being a period of intel-lectual decline, the Postclassic was a time when po-litical and social changes brought calendar reform.In the Terminal Classic period, an expanded type ofShort Count was introduced; the Calendar Rounddate was noted, as in the past, but the inscriptionsadded the number of the Katun and the Ahau dateon which a current Katun would end (Thompson1960 : 197 – 200, fig. 38, nos. 1– 3; 1965 : 650). Thesedates lack Initial Series inscriptions, period-endingdesignations, and distance numbers. This type ofdating is seen at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ in inscriptions datingbetweena.d.860 and 900, but this type of inscrip-tion apparently disappeared by the time Chiche ́nItza ́ was abandoned near the end of the Early Post-classic period.During the Early Postclassic period, the Maya stillused Long Count dates to note dates of astronomicalsignificance, but they no longer recorded historicalevents involving Maya rulers and city-states. TheLong Count base dates in the Dresden Codex, oneof the few surviving painted books from the Mayaarea, serve as historical reference points for astro-nomical cycles. The earliest recorded date isa.d.623(9.9.9.16.0) and the latest isa.d.1210 (10.19.6.1.8),a date presumed to be roughly contemporary withwhen the codex was painted (Thompson 1972 :21– 22). In Long Count inscriptions of the DresdenCodex, the month glyph often appears in a separatecolumn from the Long Count notation. Of thetwenty-seven Long Count inscriptions recorded inthe codex, only five appear to record the monthsaccurately. Four appear to have mistakes in themonth position, and eighteen lack references to themonths entirely. It seems that the close link betweenthe Long Count and the Calendar Round dissolvesduring the Early Postclassic period.The Dresden Codex has a number of CalendarRound dates that presumably followed a pattern likethat of the Classic period. The Venus pages of theDresden Codex use Calendar Round dates to accu-rately note Venus events betweena.d.1100 and 1250(Chapter 5). Apparently at this time the months stillTHE MESOAMERICAN CALENDAR5"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"classic period, when the Maya recorded historicalevents in the Short Count. They referred to a spe-cific Katun by noting the Ahau date that marked theKatun end in the cycle of 13 Katuns (approximately256 years). Such inscriptions are seen in the Postclas-sic Paris Codex and in the Colonial period (1550 –1821). The Chilam Balam books of the Colonial ep-och place the events within a twenty-year period, butthey usually do not furnish enough information togive precise dates, naming only the Tun in a specificKatun. These books indicate the Katun cycle was alsoused in prophetic history, for the texts imply thatsimilar events would repeat in Katuns of the samename (Coe 1999 : 121). For example, the historiesspeak of the Itza ́ being driven from their homes re-peatedly in Katuns bearing the name 8 Ahau (Roys1967 : 136 n. 3).The codices express the same interest in past,present, and future events seen in the Colonial pe-riod Chilam Balam books, but while astronomy ismentioned only obliquely in the Colonial periodbooks, the Postclassic codices include many astro-nomical cycles. The codices seem to date to differ-ent periods, and they each show somewhat differentforms of recording astronomical events. The Gro-lier Codex is a fragment that incorporates recordsof Venus that are quite different from those in theDresden Codex. The Grolier Codex is probably thelatest of the manuscripts, and may be Postconquestin date. It is not analyzed in this book, as it will bethe subject of a separate study in the future. Theopening pages of the Paris Codex, depicting the Ka-tun cycles, pair month glyphs with Katun notations.This suggests a specific record of time that requiresstudy in the future. As will be seen, the intervalsof approximately twenty years expressed by individ-ual Katuns may relate to astronomical events (Chap-ter 6). The Paris Codex apparently dates arounda.d.1450 (Love 1994 : 13). The Madrid Codex is slightlyearlier, painted betweena.d.1350 and 1450 (Chap-ter 4). The Dresden Codex was probably painted be-tweena.d.1200 and 1250 (Chapters 4 and 5). Thereseems to have been a dramatic change in the calen-dar from the time when the Dresden Codex waspainted to when the Madrid Codex was painted, forby the time the Madrid Codex was painted in theshifted through the solar year. After the epoch of theDresden Codex, however, we cannot be sure that theCalendar Round continued in the same fashion.In the Late Postclassic period (a.d.1250 –1550),the Yucatec Maya festival calendar may have hadsome form of intercalation to keep it in correspon-dence with the seasons. At this time, the YucatecMaya calendar revolved around a festival cycle likethat recorded by Friar Diego de Landa around 1553(Tozzer 1941: vii, 151–167). Possibly this calendarinvolved an intercalation that was introduced intothe area as a result of contact with central Mexico.By the time the Aztecs founded their capital ina.d.1325 at Tenochtitlan, the festival calendar prob-ably was locked in with the cycle of the seasons. Thiscalendar was widespread in the Valley of Mexico andextended beyond the Aztec realm to Tlaxcala in theeast (Milbrath 1989). The monthly festivals in theValley of Mexico described at the time of the conquestincorporate a number of seasonal events, and the fes-tival names themselves sometimes reflect seasonal ac-tivities (Aguilera 1989; Broda 1982; Milbrath 1980a;Tena 1987 : 68 – 69). The months were not part of cal-endar dates inscribed on Postclassic Aztec monu-ments because these do not record true CalendarRound dates. Instead, Aztec inscriptions incorporatedays from the 260-day calendar (Tonalpohualli) andyear-bearer dates that show a specific position in thecycle of fifty-two years known as the Xiuhmolpilli(year bundle). Since the festivals (20-day ‘‘months’’)were not locked into these calendar dates, they couldhave been adjusted when they began to shift too farfrom the associated solar event. Indeed, the chron-icles say that certain astronomical rituals could takeplace in one month or the next, indicating a flexibilitythat allowed them to shift within a 40-day periodcomprising two ‘‘months’’ or festivals. Such flexibilityis also evident in the fact that specific activities fromone festival often extended into the next month, anda number of festivals were paired by a specific patternof naming, such as Tecuilhuitontli (small feast of thelords) followed by Hueytecuihuitl (great feast day ofthe lords), and Miccailhuitontli (small feast day of thedead) and Hueymiccailhuitl (great feast day of thedead; Milbrath 1997 : 196; Nicholson 1971).The Long Count was not used in the Late Post-6INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Late Postclassic period, the Long Count was nolonger used.The latest known Long Count dates, all before thebeginning of the 11th Baktun ina.d.1225, are foundin the Dresden Codex eclipse table. Presumablythese dates are roughly contemporary with when thecodex was painted (Chapter 4). The astronomicaltables also record Long Count dates referring toevents hundreds of years in the past, as well asto contemporary events. They also incorporate Cal-endar Round dates that follow the pattern seen in theClassic period, when there was clearly no attempt tointercalate the cycle of months to keep them in thesame seasonal position, for the months were subor-dinate to the Long Count, a more precise form ofrecording dates.It would seem that the Maya Long Count calendarprovides an easy tool to search for astronomicaldates of importance, but it is all too easy to findsuch astronomical events. Eric Thompson (1974 : 90)warns that ‘‘anyone can get plenty of planetary dataif one allows oneself sufficient latitude in decidingwhat length the Maya accepted for the synodic revo-lution of a planet.’’ Furthermore, because there arehuge quantities of numbers to ‘‘play with’’ on ClassicMaya monuments, the chance for coincidence is avery serious problem for those interpreting dates inrelation to astronomical events (Thompson 1974 :96). This was a problem especially in the 1930sthrough the 1960s when astronomers made inter-pretations based on dates alone, often adjusting thecorrelation factor to make the dates fit the astro-nomical events they considered significant, withlittle or no knowledge of the glyphs and iconographyon the monuments. Today astronomical interpretations are enhanced by other lines of evidence, butstill the caution must remain. If one proposes aconnection between a date, an astronomical event,and specific images or glyphs, the best approach isone that investigates the calendric cycles associatedwith all known examples of that image or glyph.Even though studying the patterning of astronomicalevents in relation to dates, glyphs, and iconographyprovides a fruitful line of research, we must recog-nize that some astronomical images emphasize em-blematic symbolism rather than actual astronomicalevents. We cannot expect that dates on the monu-ments will always be useful in testing an associationwith a specific astronomical event, but general pat-terns can serve as a guide to our interpretations.The lack of agreement on the appropriate Mayacalendar correlation has been a long-standing prob-lem in the study of calendric events. Today, the gen-erally preferred correlation involves adding 584,283or 584,285 days to the total number of days indicatedby a Long Count inscription in order to arrive at theappropriate Julian day number in our astronomicalcalendar, which is then translated into a date in theGregorian or Julian calendar. Various authors havereviewed the complex issues involved (Aveni 1980 :204 – 210; Satterthwaite 1965 : 627 – 630; Thompson1960 : 303 – 310). Anthony Aveni and Lorren Hotal-ing (1994 : S25) are convinced that the 584,283 cor-relation is the correct one. This is the Goodman,Martı ́nez, Thompson correlation (GMT2), the onepreferred by Thompson (1960; 1974 : 85) in his laterwork, and endorsed by Linton Satterthwaite (1965 :631) and more recently by Sharer (1994). On theother hand, Justeson (1989 : 120) says that the issueremains debatable, citing David Kelley’s (1983) cri-tique of current correlations. Beth Collea (1982) cau-tions that there may have been different correlationsat different sites, or there may have been a breakpoint between the Classic period calendar and theColonial period records used to reconstruct the cor-relation point. More recently, Kelley (1989) notesthat only discovery of new historical documents or abetter understanding of Mesoamerican astronomywill resolve the correlation question.I use the GMT2 (584,283) correlation through-out, but in the Classic period there are some cases inwhich a correlation factor placing the events two orthree days later seems to work better, particularly inthe case of Classic period eclipses. Except in the caseof events involving the moon, shifting the recordedevent by a few days will not substantially alter theinterpretations. Moreover, local conditions could af-fect the day an event was observed. For example,the day Venus first became visible after a period ofinvisibility in conjunction with the Sun may havebeen recorded a few days later due to local weatherconditions.THE MESOAMERICAN CALENDAR7"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"foruin situations where the sound mimics Englishw.The modern Yucatec dictionary compiled byAlfredo Barrera Va ́ squez (1980) follows a similarorthographic system.

In thelast thirty years, archaeoastronomy and ethnoastron-omy have developed as interdisciplinary fields. As-tronomers are learning about anthropology, and an-thropologists are learning about astronomy. Over thelast twenty-five years, Anthony Aveni, an astrono-mer-turned-anthropologist, has led the way for an-thropologists to understand the significance of as-tronomy in the patterning of culture. Calendars andarchitectural orientations remain central to the studyof archaeoastronomy, but scholars are expandingtheir studies to link astronomy with the political andreligious imagery, especially in studies of the Preco-lumbian Maya. Art historians and epigraphers are in-creasingly involved in such research. In a 1975 articlehighlighting the role of astronomy in ancient Me-soamerican cultures, Michael Coe called for ethnog-raphers to go to the field and gather information oncurrent beliefs about astronomy, noting that someimportant keys to the past are still preserved in thepresent. Over the last decades, ethnographers haverecorded astronomical beliefs that indicate astron-omy still guides the more conservative Maya com-munities (Tedlock 1992a, 1992b). Such fieldwork hasgreatly increased our understanding of contempo-rary Maya astronomy and has provided importantclues about Precolumbian Maya astronomy.DECIPHERMENT OF MAYA GLYPHSMaya dates most often appear embedded in glyphictexts that can now be read with varying degrees ofaccuracy. It is hoped that future study of the texts canserve as an independent test of the interpretationspresented here; however, we should bear in mindthat even though the text and image are complemen-tary, they need not be identical in content.Michael Coe’sBreaking the Maya Code(1992)provides a good synthesis of the current state ofknowledge about Maya hieroglyphic writing. Afterthe initial phase of cataloguing the glyphs and study-ing the context (Thompson 1962), the first majorbreakthrough in Maya writing came from recogniz-ing a relationship between text and image, most no-tably expressed in Tatiana Proskouriakoff ’s (1960)landmark study that revealed essential componentsof Classic Maya dynastic history. More recently,Maya glyphic workshops have sprung up across thecountry, modeled after one founded by Linda Scheleat the University of Texas. A number of scholars to-day pursue decipherment using a phonetic interpre-tation based on work developed by Yurii Knorozov(1982). All agree that the writing system is basi-cally logosyllabic (logograms and syllabic signs), andgreat progress has been made in developing a sylla-bary. Nonetheless, some of the readings currently ac-cepted are bound to be revised. Indeed, HeinrichBerlin (1977 : 24 – 28) cautions that because a readingis generally accepted by a group of scholars does notmean that it is a correct reading.The varying orthographic systems used by dif-ferent scholars to transcribe Mayan languages alsopresent a problem. Up until around 1992, manyscholars followed the orthography used in Thomp-son’s extensive publications, which was derived fromColonial Yucatec. Recently, there has been a moveto revise the orthography, based on a system devel-oped in 1989 by the Maya in Guatemala (Freidelet al. 1993 : 17), which is closely akin to the one de-veloped by the linguists Robert Blair and RefugioVermont-Salas (1965).

In 1979, I was awarded a Tinker Postdoc-toral Fellowship to conduct research on astronomi-cal symbols in the Aztec festival calendar. At YaleUniversity, Michael Coe gave me access to his ex-tensive library. Anthony Aveni at Colgate Universityserved as my mentor. Over the course of the fellow-ship, I became interested in comparative data fromthe Maya area, and I began to explore the role ofastronomy in the Postclassic Maya calendar and incalendars preserved among the Maya today.My scope broadened considerably in 1980, whenAnna Roosevelt, then curator of the Precolumbiancollections at the Museum of the American Indian(now part of the Smithsonian Institution), offeredme the opportunity to curate a traveling exhibit fo-cusing on New World archaeoastronomy and eth-noastronomy. With funding we secured from theNational Endowment for the Humanities, the ex-hibit opened at the American Museum of NaturalHistory in 1982 and toured nationally through 1984.Star Gods of the Ancient Americashighlighted thecelestial luminaries cross-culturally, comparing im-agery of the sun, moon, stars, and planets in theAmericas over many centuries. In addition, four sec-tions of the exhibit synthesized the astronomical im-agery of different areas: the U.S. Great Plains and theSouthwest, the Maya area, and the Valley of Mexico,home to the Aztecs. The approach taken in theStarGodsexhibit has helped shape this book, but hereI have the opportunity to fill out what could only bepresented in fragmentary form in the exhibit. By fo-cusing on one culture area, I am able to bring outmany more patterns, and provide a more completepicture of how archaeoastronomy and ethnoastron-omy can help to enhance our understanding of an-cient New World cultures.This book has also been shaped by the input frommany scholars, both in published works and unpub-lished studies. In addition, I have benefited fromdiscussions with Anthony Aveni, Harvey Bricker,John Carlson, Michael Coe, Clemency Coggins, Es-ther Pasztory, Weldon Lamb, Edward Krupp, andAndrea Stone. The time these individuals have takento help me improve the work is greatly appreciated.I would also like to thank Regina Cheong, Ule Cris-man, and Kathryn Reed, who created the figures, andCarl Henriksen, who compiled the appendices.OVERVIEW OF CONTENTSWhen I first began this book in 1991, I intended toinclude comparative chapters on central Mexico, butI was not prepared for the overwhelming amount ofliterature on Maya astronomy generated in the lastfew years. Add to this the fast-breaking news fromMaya epigraphers, and I began to see myself as areporter latching on to the latest story. Furthermore,I am not sufficiently well versed in Maya writing tojudge the relative merits of different readings pro-posed for the texts. For this reason, I have chosento emphasize the relationship between astronomy,calendar dates, and Maya imagery. I also include acomparative study of astronomical images from Pre-columbian central Mexico to strengthen the icono-graphic analysis. I often refer to my previouslypublished studies on central Mexican astronomicalimagery by way of comparison. The reader is alsodirected toEl culto a los astros entre los Mexicas(1975), by Yo ́ lotl Gonza ́ lez Torres, an excellent over-view of Postclassic central Mexican astronomy.By synthesizing the literature on Maya astronomy,I present an overview to set the stage for presentingnew interpretations. Following the trend of my pastresearch, I link astronomical images and calendarcycles to show how the seasonal round is representedin art. In addition, I explore the astronomical attri-butes of Maya deities and the astronomical regaliaassociated with Maya rulers. Appendix 1 gives anoverview of the suggested astronomical identities fordifferent gods. Appendix 2 summarizes the ClassicMaya dates and the associated astronomical eventsdiscussed in the text. Appendix 3 allows the readerto calculate intervals between Tzolkin dates.In light of my belief that the modern Maya stillhold the keys to our understanding of ancient as-tronomical imagery, I begin the book with what thecontemporary Maya say about astronomy and theastronomical gods. In subsequent chapters, I oftenrefer back to Chapter 1 as a touchstone to emphasizethat the Maya today have provided important in-OVERVIEW OF CONTENTS9"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"an aspect of the Morning Star linked with August;the howler monkey is the Morning Star of April; thecentral Mexican Fire God represents the MorningStar in November at the onset of the dry season; anda blindfolded god from central Mexico representsthe Morning Star in June.

Both may be related to Venus,sharing the patterning in sets of five reflecting theVenus Almanac.Chapter 6 explores what little we know aboutplanetary gods, proposing that God K, one of theTriad at Palenque, represents the planet Jupiter. TheMars Beast seems specifically associated with Mars.Another planetary god is a monkey, possibly relatedto the Postclassic God C. Images depicting an assem-bly or group of gods may represent the sun, moon,and five planets.The final chapter deals with stars, the Milky Way,and other astronomical phenomena, such as cometsand meteors. A zodiac-like sequence from Yucata ́nreveals specific animal constellations recognized inthe Postclassic period. The constellations on the skyband are linked specifically with imagery of theecliptic crossing the Milky Way. In the Classic pe-riod, the Milky Way is depicted by the Cosmic Mon-ster, with his two heads symbolizing the crossingpoints of the ecliptic. Another Milky Way image isseen in Itzamna, a god with a quadripartite nature.His four different-colored bodies find their counter-part in the Popol Vuh, a creation legend describingfour different-colored roads that apparently repre-sent two sides of the Milky Way and the two sides ofthe ecliptic.Chapters 3 –7 present a number of new interpre-tations and identifications, many of which requirefurther testing in the future. My method has been toexplore the ideas in a variety of ways, usually begin-ning with the sixteenth-century Colonial period. Iwork backward through time to trace the history ofthe astronomical images in the Classic period. Dateson Classic period monuments provide data for test-ing the interpretations. Using the historical data de-veloped by scholars in the last decades, a new picturesights into the past through a core of knowledge pre-served from Precolumbian times.The second chapter focuses on what ancient as-tronomers could see with the naked eye, emphasiz-ing what one actually sees in the sky. When readingthis chapter, those unfamiliar with astronomy maywant to consult H. A. Rey’sThe Stars: A New Way toSee Them,an introductory book focusing on naked-eye astronomy, as well as Edward C. Krupp’sEchoesof the Ancient Skies.Anthony Aveni’sSkywatchersof Ancient MexicoandConversing with the Planetsshould be companion texts for Chapter 2 and sub-sequent chapters, for they contain a great deal ofinformation on the Maya calendar, architectural ori-entations, and the codices.The third chapter focuses on solar themes, in-cluding the solar calendar and orientations in archi-tecture that reflect the seasonal position of the sun.This chapter also explores how imagery of the SunGod evolved over time. It examines solar gods thatexpress different relationships with the sun, includ-ing underworld aspects of the sun and animal deitiesconnected with the sun, such as the macaw.The fourth chapter investigates lunar imagery, in-cluding eclipse representations that involve death as-pects of the sun and moon, and images that pair thesun and moon, such as the Paddler Twins. Animalimages of the moon include the rabbit on the moon,apparently the counterpart for our ‘‘man on themoon.’’ Other animals may embody the moon atdifferent times of year, such as the Water-lily Jaguarassociated with the rainy season and the Jaguar WarGod linked with the dry season. Another complex ofimages reflects the lunar phases, with the waxingmoon represented by a youthful female and the wan-ing moon by an aged goddess who can transforminto a crone threatening the sun with solar eclipseat the time of the new moon.

We are fortunate that many Maya groups remained isolated from the Euro-pean colonists and still retain a measure of isolation today. They are able to passdown their knowledge to new generations and to scholars who find this informationinvaluable in the study of ancient traditions. Certainly there have been great changesin the religious system over the past five hundred years as a result of Europeancontact, but those beliefs linked to seasonal cycles and agriculture most probablyreflect ancient concepts useful in interpreting Precolumbian astronomy. Scholarsstudying ancient Mesoamerica see a striking continuity from the Colonial period upthrough modern times, especially with respect to beliefs about geography, climate,astronomy, agricultural activities, and curing practices (Broda 1989 : 145). Indeed,religious symbols seem to have an enduring relationship to the natural environment(Stone 1995b : 12). Despite more than twenty-five different languages in the Mayanlanguage family (Pl. 1), there is a widely shared notion that the sun and the mooncontrol agriculture.THE SEASONAL CYCLEAgricultural events are a main focus of the seasonal solar calendar today, as theywere at the time of the conquest in the sixteenth century. Many Maya Indians followthe practices of their ancestors, clearing the fields before the rainy season and usinga digging stick to plant maize (corn), an important part of their diet. The first maizecrop, considered to be the principal crop, matures at the height of the rainy season.At this time the ears are bent, which not only allows the maize to dry out, but alsohastens maturity and minimizes damage from insects, fungus, and animals (Salva-dor 1998). The bent ears may be left in the field for harvest with the second crop atthe onset of the dry season. Frequently a second maize planting takes place, inter-spersed with squash or beans, during the brief dry spell in late July and early August.The new tender kernels (elotes) appear around twelve weeks later, and the maturemaize is ready to harvest around the onset of the dry season. Variations in practicerelate primarily to the altitude and latitude of the fields. Although the annual rainfallvaries across the Maya area, there is a rather uniform division of the year into a rainy"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"season beginning in April or May and a dry seasonbeginning in late November (Aveni and Hotaling1996, fig. 1; Malmstro ̈ m 1997, figs. 2, 17, 32 – 34). InMesoamerica, March is usually the month of leastrain and September is the most rainy month (Vivo ́1964 : 201).It is common practice among the Maya to fixdates for sowing and harvesting by observing the twoannual zenith passages of the sun (B. Tedlock 1992b :173, 189). They use a gnomon, a vertical staff orpole, or even their own bodies to determine the solarzenith by watching for the day that the sun casts noshadow at noon (Girard 1962 : 147). The first solarzenith in May is very important among a number ofMaya groups because it coincides with the onset ofthe rains, when the primary maize crop is planted inthe lowlands. The date of the first solar zenith is de-pendent on latitude, but occurs sometime in Maythroughout much of the Maya area (Pl. 1; Isbell1982, fig. 1). There may be a second planting at thesecond solar zenith, ranging in date from late Julyin Yucata ́ n to mid August in the southernmost Mayaarea in western El Salvador. In some highland areas,the harvesting of valley maize begins shortly afterthe second solar zenith in August (B. Tedlock1992b : 189).The Yucatec Maya, living in the northern Mayaarea, clear the new milpas of brush at least threemonths before the ‘‘burn,’’ when the fields are set onfire to clear them and to provide fertilizing ash. Theburn usually begins in March and runs through thefirst part of May. The date of the burn is determinedby a form of divination known asxoc kin(Redfieldand Villa Rojas 1962 : 44 n. 1). This usually begins inlate May just before the rains or in early June justafter the onset of the rains (Pe ́ rez 1942 : 17; 1946).They weed the fields once before the ears ripen. Theearly maize (x-thup-nal) ripens in ten to fifteenweeks, whereas late corn (u-nuc-nal) takes four anda half months. The ears dry on the stalks, and theharvest begins in November at the beginning of thedry season and continues through the followingmonths. By March they finish gathering late maizebefore clearing the fields.The agricultural calendar of the Kekchı ́ in Belizebegins in January when each man selects his milpa,and the milpa is consecrated with religious ceremo-nies (Schackt 1986 : 35 – 36). They clear the fieldsduring February and March and set fire to the un-derbrush a few days before sowing. The green cornis harvested around the beginning of August; themain harvest begins in late September and laststhroughout much of October.The Quiche ́ of Momostenango in the departmentof Totonicapa ́ n, Guatemala, plant both the moun-tain maize and the valley maize according to a cal-endar that combines solar and lunar observations(B. Tedlock 1992b). The crops grow during the warm,wet season, which runs from late April or early Maythrough October. The solar events seem to be moreimportant in the valley, where planting is begunshortly after the first solar zenith on May 1 or 2 andharvesting is begun after the second solar zenith onAugust 11 or 12. At higher altitudes, they plant maizeand beans in March and harvest 260 days later inDecember.Among the Mam-speaking Maya of Santiago Chi-maltenango in the highlands of Guatemala, the ag-ricultural cycle begins in February, and the fieldsare planted in March, long before the rainy season,because the corn grows more slowly at these high al-titudes (Watanabe 1992 : 37 – 41). They plant theirmain crop in the more temperate valley slopes belowthe village, where the fields are cleared in April inanticipation of rains in May. They plant beans andsquash alongside the young stalks of corn duringJuly, the time of a brief dry spell calledcanicula,aterm derived from Latin that refers to the dog star,Sirius, prominent at this time of year. After caniculathe rains resume, reaching their peak in September.The newly ripened corn can be picked as early asSeptember, but the main harvest takes place in Janu-ary after the corn dries on the stalk.In 1943 –1944, Miguel Leo ́ n-Portilla (1988 : 145 –148) recorded a Tzeltal solar calendar at Oxchuc inhighland Chiapas. The calendar of eighteen twenty-day months plus five nameless days (Haab) shows afixed relationship to the solar year and associatedagricultural activities. The Haab began in Batzul(December 26 –January 14) with light agriculturalTHE SEASONAL CYCLE13"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"places the transition points at the equinoxes, eventhough the seasonal transition actually occurs some-what later.A seasonal duality is also apparent in divisions ofthe year among the Chortı ́ of Guatemala. This is ex-pressed in a fixed 360-day cycle that is divided intotwo halves (Girard 1962 : 79 – 80). The first solar ze-nith on April 25 divides the year into a light half anda dark half. The dark half is associated with the rainyseason, the light half with the dry season. This divi-sion of the year forms two 180-day sets that can bedivided further into periods of 9 days or 20 days, in-tervals that echo subdivisions in the PrecolumbianMaya calendar.The solar zenith has a complementary solar eventknown as the solar nadir, spaced six months fromthe solar zenith. The November solar nadir marksthe beginning of the dry season. Barbara Tedlock’s(1992b : 189) work with the Quiche ́ of Momosten-ango (at 157048N) indicates that the full moon pass-ing overhead at midnight shows the approximatetime of the two annual nadirs of the sun (early No-vember and early February).The Maya designate the changing length of thedays and the associated seasonal changes with differ-ent terms. For example, the Tzotzil of Zinacanta ́nsay that months from January to June are called‘‘long days,’’ whereas the months from July to De-cember are referred to as ‘‘short days’’ (Laughlin1975 : 177, 249, 500). Similarly, the sharp division inthe year between the rainy season and the dry isdesignated with appropriate seasonal names. TheTzotzil refer to the dry-season sun ask’ak’al ’osil(fireor sun sky) andk’inal k’ak’al(fire or sun days),whereas they say that the rainy season isjo’tik,mean-ing ‘‘expanse of water’’ or ‘‘expanse of rain’’ (Laugh-lin, personal communication 1988). The day itself isk’ak’al,meaning ‘‘sun or heat’’ (Vogt and Vogt 1980 :503). The seasonal cycle of the Tzotzil solar calendaris integrated with the four directions (Gossen 1974b :33 – 35, fig. 2). The east is associated with the periodbetween the winter solstice and the vernal equinox,when the days begin to grow longer. The directionof ‘‘up,’’ rising heat, and the masculine principle areascendant at the spring equinox. The time from thevernal equinox to the summer solstice is linked withactivities, such as clearing the brush. By Mac (Feb-ruary 24 –March 15), the sowing began in the colduplands. The native religious leaders were respon-sible for this calendar and the church fiestas, indicat-ing the two were linked together.The Tzotzil of Zinacanta ́ n, Chiapas, plant high-land maize in March, but in the lowlands, where thetemperatures are higher, they wait until the rains be-gin in May (Vogt 1990 : 69 –70). Weeding takes placein June and July. The highland harvest takes place inOctober. Harvesting in the lowlands begins in No-vember and continues into December and January.Among the Tzotzil of Chenalho ́ in Chiapas, theagricultural year runs from February to Novem-ber (Guiteras Holmes 1961 : 32 – 35, 44 – 45). Theagricultural cycle follows the seasonal pattern, withplanting beginning around the onset of the rainyseason in late May; the rains reach their first maxi-mum in June, followed by a dry spell (canicula) inthe last two weeks of July and the first week in Au-gust, then the rains resume until the next dry seasonbegins in November (Guiteras Holmes 1961 : 7, 34).In September, they bend the stems of the maize ears,leaving them on the stalk; by the end of October themaize is ready for harvesting. Not all the maize isbrought in at once; rather, some is left to dry so thatit will not rot when it is stored. Their agriculturalyear is guided by the 365-day calendar and by a fixed260-day ritual year equivalent to thirteen monthsbeginning in Sisak and ending in Pom. In two sepa-rate field seasons in 1944 and 1955, Sisak began onFebruary 5 and Pom ended on November 16, whichsuggests that the 365-day calendar remains fixed inthe year. The tenth of Sisak marks the beginning ofthe 260-day ritual year and the agricultural cycle.Following Sisak, there are five days of carnival, thefivech’aik’in(uncounted days) that round out the365-day calendar. This may be when the calendar isadjusted for leap year, for there is only a one- or two-day difference when comparing the modern calendarto a Tzotzil calendar recorded in 1688 (Berlin 1967).The Tzotzil of Chamula in highland Chiapas di-vide the year into two halves, with the ‘‘right hand’’direction symbolizing the rainy season and day sky,and the ‘‘left hand’’ direction representing the dryseason and the night.

The autumn equinox symbol-izes waning heat, the female principle, the west, andincipient death. The shorter days between the au-tumnal equinox and the winter solstice represent theend of the growing season and the south, associ-ated with the concept of the nadir and the sun atmidnight.Often, the solstices seem to be regarded as transi-tion points in the sun’s path. The Tzotzil of Chenalho ́say that the sun changes its path twice a year, and atthe transition points the old men stand at dawn andcommand the sun ‘‘to take its proper place.’’ On thefirst of Batzul (January 16), the sun moves north andthe days become longer, and on the first day of ’Elech(June 30) the sun moves south and the days becomeshorter (Guiteras Holmes 1961 : 32, 36). The Quiche ́also refer to the winter and summer solstices as‘‘change of path’’; the most important change in di-rection takes place at the winter solstice when thehigh-altitude corn is harvested (B. Tedlock 1992b :180). The summer solstice is more important thanthe winter solstice among the Chortı ́, but both sol-stices play a pivotal role as the corners in the cosmicdiagram embodying the yearly cycle (Girard 1962 :245, 247, 297). Nonetheless, the Chortı ́ say that thesun changes its path in April and May, a time linkedwith the first solar zenith falling on April 30 or May 1in the Chortı ́ area (Fought 1972 : 386; Girard 1962 :79, 244, 251). This is the time when the rainy seasonbegins, the half of the year ruled by the weather godSantiago. The dry half of the year, on the other hand,is ruled by the Sun God.A number of Maya people have a fixed 260-dayagricultural calendar. The Chortı ́ have a fixed cycleof 260 days in their agricultural calendar runningfrom February 8 to October 24, but they apparentlyshift the beginning of the agricultural year to co-incide with the first crescent moon (Girard 1962 :328 – 342). Eric Thompson (1930 : 41) records thatthe Mopan Maya of San Antonio in Belize also be-gin their agricultural year on February 8; this sug-gests that they also have a fixed agricultural cycle of260 days. Barbara Tedlock (1992b : 190) suggests thatthe nine-month growing period of mountain maize,approximating the length of the human gestationperiod, helps account for the 260-day length of thesacred almanac.The balance of nature depends on the sun follow-ing its course, both in the daily cycle and in the an-nual agricultural calendar. Today its seasonal courseis reinforced by rituals and offerings, as it was in thepast. The Maya people are anxious for the sun totake its proper place in the sky to open the agricul-tural season, but they are also concerned that therebe the correct balance of sun and rain. Too much sunis most damaging to the crops, for it brings droughtand then famine. The codices show us that the bal-ance of sun and rain was also very important in Pre-columbian times (Chapter 3). Similarly, there is evi-dence in the codices of a fixed 260-day agriculturalcycle running from February to November, with spe-cial rituals relating to planting in May (Chapter 3).THE SOLAR CALENDARThe solar calendar used by the Maya today interfaceswith the seasonal cycles. Many Maya people share a365-day solar calendar of eighteen months of twentydays that ends with a short period of five days, acalendar derived from Precolumbian times that isknown as the Haab. Although the Haab is foundtoday in a number of communities throughoutChiapas and Guatemala (but not in Yucata ́ n), onlyaround thirty-four communities in northwesternGuatemala preserve both the Haab and the Tzolkin(Bricker 1981 : 8). These two calendars together forma cycle that repeats every fifty-two years. A name forthe fifty-two-year cycle,solq’uin,is preserved amongthe Chol (Aulie and Aulie 1978 : 106).The 365-day year operates separately from the260-day divination calendar, but there is a certaincoordination because only four days of the 260-daycalendar fall in a position that makes them year-bearers, meaning that they are days that can beginthe year. As noted in the introduction, the interlock-ing cycles of 365 days and 260 days forming the Cal-endar Round would not seem to allow for any formof intercalation. Nevertheless, in certain communi-ties it is clear that some sort of adjustment is madeto keep the festivals in accord with the seasons.THE SOLAR CALENDAR15"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"in a system that is essentially the same as that of theQuiche ́ (Aveni 1980 : 43; Lincoln 1942). The newyear in their solar calendar is not intercalated, butprior to the early eighteenth century, there may havebeen some form of correction because the monthnames incorporate seasonal and agricultural activi-ties (Colby and Colby 1981 : 47).Knowledge of the solar calendar is widespreadamong the Tzotzil of Chamula (Gossen 1974a : 246;1974b : 27). The first month of the calendar usuallybegins in late December around the winter solstice.The people of Chamula link the seasonal cycle tothe traditional Mesoamerican calendar of 365 days.However, Gossen notes that they do not allow for aleap year in their calculations. Apparently, they co-ordinate their festivals with the Catholic festival cal-endar. Ceremonies dedicated to the Sun God aresometimes fused with the Catholic festival calendarat Chamula. Christ’s birthday is celebrated as the re-birth of the sun on the winter solstice, the longestnight of the year (Gossen 1974b : 39). Synchronizingthe solar and lunar calendars also appears to be im-portant in the Festival of Games at Chamula. Herethe sun and Christ are equated with the bull killedjust prior to Easter (Gossen 1986 : 241).The Tzotzil of Zinacanta ́ n honor their patronsaint, San Lorenzo, in a festival between August 7and 11 (Vogt and Vogt 1980 : 516). This period in-corporates the date of the second solar zenith at thislatitude of 167N (pl. 1). Eva Hunt (1977 : 226 – 227)notes that the Festival of San Lorenzo coincideswith the position of the sun straight overhead atthe latitude of Zinacanta ́ n, and she equates the saintwith the summer solstice and the solar zenith, eventhough these two events are separated by more thana month. At the other end of the year, the Festival ofSan Sebastia ́ n embodies the winter solstice sun, ac-cording to Hunt (1977 : 226 – 228).The saints’ days are often used as guides for plant-ing. The ‘‘dı ́a de San Marcos’’ (April 25), involvingan eight-day ceremony ending on May 2, is impor-tant for timing the Chortı ́ planting cycle (Wisdom1940 : 462 – 463). The Day of the Holy Cross onMay 3 is a rain-making ceremony that is expected tobring the first rains on the first day of the plantingfestival. The Chortı ́ link this festival to the positionHeinrich Berlin (1967) analyzed the 365-day fes-tival calendar preserved today among a number ofdifferent Tzotzil communities, comparing it with anearly version of the Tzotzil calendar recorded byFriar Juan de Rodaz in 1688. Today, as in the past,the year begins in Batzul in early January. Berlinnotes that since 1688 there has been a total shift inthe Tzotzil festival calendar of only two days, and hebelieves this indicates that a calendar correction toaccount for leap years has been made, though hecould not ascertain how this was done. Calixta Gui-teras Holmes (1961 : 153) was also unable to find outhow the calendar was adjusted among the Tzotzil ofChenalho ́ , but it clearly follows the seasons. It islikely that the Maya today link the festivals to Catho-lic saints’ days to keep in time with the seasons (EvonVogt, personal communication 1997).The Tzutujil Maya of Guatemala say that the sundies each year (Tarn and Prechtel 1986 : 174 –178).They conduct ceremonies to bury the old yeararound the time of Carnival before Lent or HolyWeek (the week before Easter). In preparation forthe New Year ceremonies, they bury an effigy of theMam representing the old year (Taube 1989b : 375;Thompson 1970a : 472). This synchronization withthe Catholic calendar suggests the Tzutujil may usea combination of solar and lunar observations, forthe year end must precede Easter, which occurs onthe first Sunday after the full moon falling on orafter the spring equinox.The Quiche ́ name their solar year with the dayname and number combination that begins the year,known as the year-bearer (B. Tedlock 1992b : 35, 91,99 –104). The new year gradually shifts in the calen-dar, for there is no apparent adjustment to make thenew year fall at a specific time of year. Only four ofthe twenty day names can act as year-bearers (knownas Mam), with Quej being considered the first andmost important. Each of the four Mam is associatedwith a different mountain, and they are greeted atthe beginning of the year at their respective moun-tain shrines at Quilaja, Tamancu, Socop, and Pipil.The five days at year end, associated with the oldMam, are considered very dangerous.The Ixil Maya also combine the 260-day calendarand the 365-day calendar to name the year-bearers16CONTEMPORARY MAYA IMAGES OF THE HEAVENS"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"of the zenith sun at the center of a cosmological crossmarking the intersection point of the Milky Way andthe ecliptic (Girard 1949 : 456; Milbrath 1980a : 291).The ‘‘dı ́a de Santiago’’ (July 25) marks a temporarysuspension of the rains (canicula) when the Chortı ́prepare the fields for a second planting (Girard1962 : 251– 252, table facing page 328).Robert Redfield and Alfonso Villa Rojas (1962 :82 – 83) point out that the agricultural year underliesand controls aspects of the church calendar amongthe Yucatec Maya of Chan Kom. For example, thegreat emphasis placed on festival activities on theDay of the Cross in early May relates to a lull in ag-ricultural activities at this time.In some cases the Catholic festivals have beenchanged to accommodate Precolumbian Maya be-liefs. In the department of Suchitepe ́ quez, Guate-mala, the Maya of San Bernardino celebrate CorpusChristi Day in July, rather than the traditional Catho-lic day in springtime. Jeanne Pieper (1988 : 28 – 30)points out that these festivals are thinly disguisedNew Year festivals similar to Precolumbian dancesthat took place in July in Yucata ́ n. The CorpusChristi dance is called the Dance of the Tun. Thedance maestro carries a wooden deer head, symbol-izing a sacrificed deer, at the beginning of a disor-derly dance on Saturday, which is followed on Sun-day by a procession to the church with stops at foursmall chapels decorated with mirrors, colored paper,and a statue of a saint.The Maya festival cycle links the Catholic saints’days with ancient solar rituals in a way that mayseem surprising. This syncretism is just one moreway the Maya have maintained core beliefs in theface of rapid change. Such syncretism is facilitated bythe fact that the Catholic festivals are timed by sea-sonal positions of the sun and phases of the moon,the same bodies observed by the Maya in their festi-vals and planting cycles.MODERN MAYA COSMIC DIAGRAMSThe cosmic directions may be associated with differ-ent colors, as among the Tzotzil of Zinacanta ́ n, wholink east with red and the ‘‘upward’’ direction, andwest with black and the ‘‘downward’’ direction (Vogtand Vogt 1980 : 504 –506). At San Andre ́ s Larraı ́nzar,the colors of the cardinal directions are associatedwith different Tzotzil gods (Holland 1964 : 16). Theeast is white and is linked to the god of rain; thenorth is also white but is associated with the god ofmaize; the west is black, linked with the god of death;and the south is red, where the god of wind resides.The four corners of the heavens are intercardinal di-rections where thecargadores(bearers) reside. TheTzotzil at Chenalho ́ relate the north to the colorwhite, the west to black, the south to yellow, and theeast to red (Guiteras Holmes 1961 : 287). They linkthree of the colors to scarcity of maize (famine);black represents famine related to women, red fam-ine to men, and white famine to children; but yellowis a color associated with an abundance of maize.During the Colonial period, Friar Diego de Landarecorded similar color directions associated withvarying fates of maize in the four-year cycle of theyear-bearers; for example, Cauac years, linked withthe west and the color black, were characterized bya hot sun that would destroy the fields of maize(Tozzer 1941 : 148).Just as all roads led to Rome in classical antiquity,all directions lead to the sun in Maya cosmology. AYucatec prayer recorded in the nineteenth centuryrefers to the sun as the ‘‘master of the east’’ who car-ries prayers to the four extremes of the sky and thefour extremes of the earth (Villa Rojas 1969 : 272).The Maya cosmos is delimited by the sun’s apparentmotion. The east and west are often defined as entryand exit points for the sun (B. Tedlock 1992a : 22;1992b : 173 –177). Many Mayan languages reflectconcepts of time and space based on the daily andannual movements of the sun (Watanabe 1983).A quadripartite arrangement also refers to thedaily course of the sun in some contexts. A Tzotzilcosmic diagram marks four principal positions ofthe sun in its daily course (Fig. 1.1a). At the Festivalof Games in February in Chamula, the head of Sun /Christ is represented by four metal flagpole tips at-tached to poles (the skeletons of Sun /Christ) andbanners (the body of Sun /Christ), which symbolizethe four positions of Sun /Christ: rising, zenith,setting, and nadir (Gossen 1986 : 232). Analysis ofChamula astronomical concepts indicates that theMODERN MAYA COSMIC DIAGRAMS17"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"primary axis is an east-west direction based on thesun’s daily path (Sosa 1986 : 196, table 1). Eventhough they recognize that the zenith position isoverhead, the east is visualized as the ‘‘up’’ directionand the west as ‘‘down.’’East and west indicate the directions where thesun rises and sets in Mayan languages, but the twoother directions are not recorded in many dictionar-ies. When north and south are named, they are vari-ously linked with the right and left hand of the SunGod, the direction of prevailing winds that bringrain, the topographical distinctions between high-land and lowland, and the notion of above and be-low or zenith and nadir (B. Tedlock 1992b : 176 –178). Barbara Tedlock interprets the basic structureof Mayan directional symbolism as a reflection of thedaily path of the sun, with north and south repre-senting the noon and midnight positions of the sun,loosely linked with zenith and nadir. However, herdata from the Quiche ́ also suggest that north andsouth are the sides of heaven, with south corre-sponding to the left hand of the rising sun and northto the right hand, whereas east is ‘‘the sun’s risingplace’’ and west is ‘‘the sun’s falling place’’ (Tedlock1992a : 23). Similar notions occur among the Tzotziland Lacando ́ n Maya, who say that north and southare sides of heaven (Ko ̈ hler 1980 : 586).When speaking of the cosmic directions, there isdisagreement as to the location of the ‘‘corners’’ ofthe cosmos. Ulrich Ko ̈ hler (1980 : 585 –586) notesthat among the Tzotzil, Lacando ́ n, and Quiche ́ , thesky-bearers hold up the heavens at the four intercar-dinal directions associated with the year-bearer days,which he links with the sun’s solstice extremes. InQuintana Roo, the Yucatec Maya of X-Cacal placethe great Chacs at the corners of the world associatedwith true cardinal directions, but an informant fromthe village of Tusik describes the corners of the skyas being located at the intercardinal points (Villa Ro-jas 1945 : 102 n. 12). The Maya of Yalcoba ́ , Yucata ́n,say that the corners of the cosmos are located at theintercardinal directions, whereas the cardinal direc-tions refer to the sides of heaven (Sosa 1985 : 419 –420, Fig. 10; 1989 : 132 –137, Fig. 9.2). Thehme`en(native priest /shaman) says that the sun reaches thecorner oflak’in saman(our northeast) in June, andit moves tolak’in nohol(our southeast) by De-cember. The beginning direction is east (lak’in), the‘‘up’’ direction positioned between two of the cor-ners of a quadrilateral cosmos defined by the annualand daily solar motion. In a like fashion, Colonialperiod Yucatec maps place the eastern direction atthe top, indicating the ‘‘up’’ direction (Marcus 1992,fig. 6.16).In some accounts, the corners of the universe areintercardinal points identified with the extreme ho-rizon positions of the sun at the solstices (Girard1962 : 40, 45, 247; Gossen 1982, fig. 2; Villa Rojas1988 : 128 –131). Girard points out that the cosmiccross of the Maya is often mistakenly referred to as arepresentation of the cardinal directions, when infact the Chortı ́ indicate that it marks the intercardi-nal horizon positions of the sun at the solstices. Anidealized diagram of the Maya cosmos traces out aquincunx of five points, with the four corner pointslinked to the solstices, and the center point mark-ing the equinoctial line (Villa Rojas 1988, fig. 2). Inother cosmograms, the center point can be the noonposition of the sun. The Yucatec Maya of Yalcoba ́say that theu hol gloryah(the hole in the middle ofthe sky) corresponds to the noon position of the sun,when there is a cosmological conduit to the sun(Sosa 1985 : 315, 346, 368 – 369, 393 – 395, 435; 1989 :139). There is a complementary hole in the earthmarking the underworld position of the sun aroundmidnight.Evon Vogt (1964 : 198) reports significant varia-tion in the cosmological worldview from one Tzotziltown ormunicipioto the next, and even internalvariations withinmunicipios.In Zinacanta ́ n, theFIG. 1.1.a:Contemporary Tzotzil conception of universe(after Vogt 1969, fig. 192).b:Contemporary Lacando ́ n conception of universe (af-ter Ra ̈tsch and Ma’ax 1984 : 44 – 46).

Another Lacando ́ n ac-count, recorded by Christian Ra ̈tsch and K’ayumMa’ax (1984 : 44 – 46), has seven layers, each formedby a round disk (Fig. 1.1b). The layers, numberedfrom top to bottom, place thechembel k’uho’,or‘‘Wandering Gods’’ (the planets), in the highestheaven. The second layer is the abode of Kak’och,also called ‘‘two-monkey.’’ Here is where Hacha ̈k-yum placed the sun, but this layer already containeda sun made by Kak’och to shine for Hacha ̈kyum andthe two suns together were too bright, so the sun thatilluminates the earth is now in a separate layer. Thethird layer, suspended from the layer above, is theheaven of T’uup (the Little One), a spider monkeywho is said to be lord of the sun. The fifth layer, theheaven of the vultures, hangs in a similar fashionfrom the fourth layer, the heaven of Hacha ̈kyum.The sixth layer is formed by the earth, and the sev-enth layer, the underworld of Sukunkyum, hangsfrom stone columns attached to the earth.In sum, the sun’s motion defines the diagram ofcosmic space. The earth often takes a quadrilateralform because its horizon is circumscribed by themotion of the sun forming an intercardinal cosmicdiagram at the horizon extremes of the solstices. An-other cosmic diagram marks the rising and settingpoints to the east and west, and the north and southare true cardinal directions apparently equated withthe north and south side of the heavens or, alterna-tively, the above and below positions relating to thedaily course of the sun. The noon sun can defineboth the overhead and central position, especially inconstructs linking above and below with a centralvertical axis. Although the noon sun is overhead, the‘‘up position’’ is sometimes linked with the risingsun in the east. The cosmos may also be divided ver-tically by the sun’s path along steps to the noon po-sition. Another construct divides vertical space inlayers. The highest layer is reserved for the planets insome accounts, but when few layers are mentioned,the sun is usually in the highest of the layers.earth is a cube, and men live on top of the cube; atthe lower corners of the cube are four pillars of theworld, conceived of as animals or gods (Vashakmen)holding up the earth (Vogt 1969 : 297 – 298).

The huts at Zinacanta ́ n have threeroof joists to mirror the three-layered heavens, col-lectively known as Vinahel, meaning ‘‘sky’’ or ‘‘heav-ens’’ (Vogt 1976 : 58). On the other hand, the Tzotzilof San Andre ́ s Larraı ́nzar say that the sky is a pyra-mid supported by a giant ceiba, and the sun rises bysix steps to the top and descends in six steps to markthe thirteen hours of daylight (Fig. 1.1a; Holland1964 : 14 –15; Laughlin 1969 : 175). The stepped as-pect of the sun’s course seems to have more to dowith a count of hours in the day; however, the thir-teenth hour is not at sunset, but instead is at noon,being equated with the thirteenth step overhead atthe ‘‘heart of the sky’’ (Holland 1964 : 14 –15, 17).The sun, the moon, and the Catholic saints are po-sitioned in the thirteen levels of the sky.Maya cosmologies report layered heavens rangingfrom three to fifteen. A Tzotzil cosmic model re-corded in Zinacanta ́ n places the moon in the lowestlayer, the stars in the middle layer, and the sun in theupper layer (Vogt 1976 : 58). The Maya of Chamulaalso visualize a three-layered heaven, with the sunmoving in the highest layer. The first layer is thevisible sky, the second is where the stars and moonare located, and the third is where the sun (Christ),the bright constellations, and St. Jerome are located(Gossen 1974b : 21, Fig. 1). Data collected in theYucatec Maya settlement of X-Cacal indicate that theuniverse has fifteen layers, seven above the earth andseven below, with a giant ceiba linking the layers to-gether through its roots, trunk, and branches; simi-lar traditions are known from the region of Vallado-lid (Roys 1972 : 73; Villa Rojas 1945 : 154; 1969 : 275).Five layers are found in the Lacando ́ n universe,according to Jon McGee (1990 : 61, 107 –108).

The Maya use dif-ferent names for the changing positions of the sun,and they visualize the sun taking a journey or trans-forming over the course of the days and nights ofthe year.The daily movements of the sun are noted withdifferent terms. According to the Quiche ́ , the sunbears different names in the morning, at noon, andin the afternoon, with the noon sun identified as atwo-faced god called Jakawitz (sometimes given asCawach, Cakwitz, or Caguach; Carmack 1981 : 275;Leo ́ n 1945 : 45). Another source notes that theQuiche ́ say that the sun has four faces, but it is notclear whether these express different times of day(Alvarado 1975 : 51). In Lacando ́ n terms definingtime, ‘‘fire base sun’’ describes noon, ‘‘half base sun’’refers to one – two hours after sunrise, ‘‘nose basesun’’ to midmorning and midafternoon, and ‘‘nosun’’ to sunset (McGee 1990 : 54, table 5.4).In the nineteenth century, Pı ́o Pe ́ rez recordednames for the time of day in Yucatec Mayan, notingthat the name for the time around midday was acontraction ofchumuc-Kin,or ‘‘center of the day’’(Sosa 1986 : 196). Similarly, the Tzotzil of Zinacanta ́nsay that the noon sun is the ‘‘center,’’ ‘‘middle’’ or‘‘halfway sun’’ (Laughlin 1975 : 64).Apparently the sun ages over the course of theday, a notion in keeping with a time-space con-tinuum in which celestial positioning equates withpassage of time. The Tzotzil call the noon positionthe sun’s maturity or aging (syijil k’ak’al;Laughlin1975 : 385). Some names for the afternoon sun andthe sun at sunset imply that the sun is old; othersindicate that the sun dies after sunset (Lamb n.d.b).The aged sun evokes Precolumbian images of theaged Sun God (Chapter 3). Names for the solar de-signs on men’s trousers among the Quiche ́ indicatethat the sun ages like a human being, for the infantsun represents the child; the young sun symbolizesthe young man; and grandfather sun represents theelderly (Girard 1979 : 299).The sun’s nightly passage through the underworldis certainly an important event to the Maya, butthere seem to be many different views on what hap-pens to the sun at night. Some accounts involvedeath and rebirth, as among the Chortı ́, who say thatthe sun dies at sunset and is reborn every day at dawn(Girard 1962 : 723). On the other hand, the Chol saythat the sun goes inside his house at night (Josser-and, cited in Bassie-Sweet 1992 : 172). A Tzeltal termfor the west is ‘‘the sleeping place of the sun,’’ imply-ing that the sun goes to sleep at night (B. Tedlock1992b : 176 –177).A Lacando ́ n source says that an underworld Venusgod, known as Sucunyum (Sukunkyum, or Lord El-der Brother), carries the sun on his shoulders in hisjourney through the underworld (Fig. 1.1b; Ra ̈tschand Ma’ax 1984 : 45; Thompson 1970b : 240, 303).Each day the sun grows tired; he is transformed intoa skeletal form at night and at dawn he is resurrected(McGee 1990 : 62 – 65, 116). Thus the night sun is in-volved in both transformation and a journey to theunderworld. Another Lacando ́ n account says thatthe sun enters the underworld each night by climb-ing down the trunks of trees and through the roots(Thompson 1960 : 71). This echoes Precolumbianimagery showing the Sun God climbing up a treeemerging from the underworld (Fig. 3.4c).A translation forchik’in,meaning ‘‘west’’ in Yuca-tec, is ‘‘eaten sun,’’ which implies that the sun is de-voured at night. Who does the devouring is not clear,but it could be the Earth Monster with a gaping cavemouth. The Yucatec Maya of Yalcoba ́ say that the sungoes into a cave at night (Sosa 1985 : 423, 446 – 447).This image may involve water, because caves areassociated with underground rivers. Yucatec termsnote that the sun is diving toward water in the after-noon (Sosa 1985 : 426 – 427). A Yucatec term used forthe setting sun ist’ubul,meaning ‘‘to sink or be sub-merged in water or a hollow object’’ (Barrera Va ́s-quez 1980). The Chamula Maya say that the suntravels in a wide-mouthed gourd when it sets intothe ocean at night (Gossen 1974b : 264).

To impress the Moon Goddess, XT’actani, thesun carries a stuffed deerskin, pretending he has justkilled the deer. The skin bursts open and XT’actanilaughs at him, so he changes himself into a hum-mingbird and continues to court her until he con-vinces her to elope (Thompson 1967 : 31– 32; 1970b :363 – 364).Similarly, in a Cakchiquel tale, the sun comes towoo his lunar lover in the form of a hummingbird(Thompson 1970b : 365 – 366). Another legend, re-corded by Wirsing among the Kekchı ́, has the youngMoon Goddess weaving when the sun visits her inthe guise of a hummingbird (Thompson 1970b : 370).The sun’s aspect as a bird provides a natural expla-nation for how the sun moves through the sky.The hummingbird’s taste for flower nectar, es-pecially from red-colored flowers, may be anotherreason for the connection with the sun, for flowersthemselves symbolize the sun among the Tzotzil(Vogt 1976 : 128). Because hummingbirds are be-lieved to hibernate during the dry season, the hum-mingbird’s return is a seasonal metaphor for thereturn of the sun in spring in Tzotzil folklore (Hunt1977 : 61– 62, 68, 254). Hunt notes that the hum-mingbirds are not merely like the sun, theyarethesun. As we shall see, the Precolumbian Maya also vi-sualized the sun as a hummingbird (Chapter 3).Occasionally, the solar bird is an eagle, a birdnoted for its pattern of flight circling the sky and itsability to look directly at the sun. The Lacando ́ n saythat Hacha ̈kyum created the sun out of limestoneand painted a brilliant harpy eagle on his clothes,and this is why the sun is so bright (Ra ̈tsch andMa’ax 1984 : 42).Birds are not the only animal transformationssymbolizing the sun flying across the sky. A butterflyin a diamond design represents the sun and the cen-ter of the cosmos for Tzotzil weavers of Magdalenasin highland Chiapas (Morris 1986 : 57; Morris andFoxx 1987 : 110).Whereas the sun itself flies across the sky as awinged creature or is carried by an animal or athe ocean, again indicating that the sun passes intothe waters of the underworld (Gossen 1980 : 144).In some Tzotzil accounts, the sun passes throughan underworld inhabited by small people. Becausethe sun passes so close to them, these dwarfs mustwear mud hats to protect themselves from the heat,according to Zinacanta ́ n cosmology (Vogt 1969 :298). The accounts of Chenalho ́ say that the helpersof the sun kneel to hand over the sun to small peoplewaiting in the underworld to carry the sun throughthe underworld (Guiteras Holmes 1961 : 152 –153,268). The sun dries up the ocean where it enters theunderworld, but the rivers replenish the waters.When moving across the sky overhead, the sunundergoes a variety of transformations and usesmany different modes of transport. The Ixil in Gua-temala believe that the Sun God (Kub’aal q’ii) hastwenty different manifestations and that he movesacross the sky seated in a chair carried by four bear-ers; two other bearers carry his large headdress(Colby and Colby 1981 : 38). The Tzeltal of Chiapassay that the sun walks across the sky (Nash 1970 :311). On the other hand, the Quiche ́ note that thesun is a young traveler who cannot walk in space, soan immense feathered snake known as K’ucumatzcarries the sun up to its noon position (Carmack1981 : 275). This same serpent also carries the sunover the ocean (Leo ́ n 1945 : 45 – 46). The serpent’sname, K’ucumatz, may embody the two seasons ofthe solar year, for the dry season is identified withthe serpent (cumatz) and the wet season with thequetzal bird (k’uk’;Carmack 1981 : 356).The Tzotzil of Chamula say that the sun rides in achariot or a two-wheeled cart, clearly reflecting a Eu-ropean mode of transport (Gossen 1974b : 263 –264). Another Chamula account notes that when thedays are short, the sun goes in a truck so he can moverapidly across the sky, whereas when days are long,he rides a burro and moves slowly across the sky.A more ancient Maya tradition found among theCakchiquel says that a swift-moving deer drawsthe sun across the sky on the short days around thewinter solstice, whereas two collared peccaries(jabalı ́) convey the sun more slowly on the long daysaround the summer solstice (Thompson 1967 : 38).These images all seem to have their counterparts in22CONTEMPORARY MAYA IMAGES OF THE HEAVENS"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"wheeled vehicle, sun beams are shot to earth as pro-jectiles. The rays of the Lacando ́ n solar god A ̈kTet(our father) are sun arrows with flint tips (Ra ̈tschand Ma’ax 1984 : 42). The Chol call the solar rays‘‘arrowshafts of the sun’’ (Thompson 1960 : 142).The Tzotzil compare a sunbeam to a shaft, a bodkin,or a needle (Lamb n.d.b). In Mopan folklore, thesun shoots an arrow, killing his grandmother, Xkitza(Thompson 1967 : 23). The Sun God or a ruler im-personating the sun carries darts in PrecolumbianMaya imagery (Fig. 3.5g).In sum, an animal or a vehicle carries the sun,or the sun itself is a winged creature that can fly.Dwarfs convey the sun through the underworld insome accounts. In others, the sun travels throughwater or down a sacred tree. Although most of thecontemporary Maya cultures have been influencedby Catholicism to varying degrees, there seem to bea number of core beliefs that reflect Precolumbianconcepts, such as the sun’s rays as arrows. The notionthat animals carry the sun or that the sun transformsinto an animal seems to have counterparts in Pre-columbian times. Similarly, the sun’s descent intothe underworld on a tree seems to be reflected inPrecolumbian imagery.THE SUN GODThe sun rules the cosmos for most Mayan speakers,who describe the sun as a human or godlike figurewith a brilliant round face (B. Tedlock 1992b : 173,178). Generally the sun is male, but there are someinstances of a female sun, as among the Chol (Iwan-iszewski 1992 : 133). When the sun is male, he is usu-ally identified with God or Jesus Christ in the indige-nous form of Catholicism.There is considerable variety in how the sun re-lates to the higher powers. A generalized link withGod the Father may be expressed in the name ‘‘fathersun’’ used by the Yucatec Maya of Quintana Roo(Villa Rojas 1969 : 272). Among the Tzotzil, the sunis variously identified as Our Lord Sun, Jesus Christ,the Child Jesus, God, or God the Father (Gossen1982 : 29, Fig. 1; Guiteras Holmes 1961 : 152, 186,313; Holland 1964 : 15). The Tzotzil of Chamula saythat the sun is Christ, ‘‘our honorable father,’’ wholives with his father, San Jose ́ , and carries a candlerepresenting the Morning Star (Gossen 1974b : 21,23, Fig. 1; 1982 : 29, Fig. 1). The Tzotzil of San An-dre ́ s Larraı ́nzar associate the sun with both JesusChrist and San Salvador (Laughlin 1969 : 175). ThePokomchı ́ say the Sun God admits them into thepresence of God, like the saints who are also advo-cates with God (Mayers 1958 : 16). Apparently herethe Sun God is not identified with God, but his roleas a mediator between man and God suggests he isidentified with Jesus.In Zinacanta ́ n, the Tzotzil identify the sun withSen ̃or Esquipulas, representing Christ on the cross;however the sun is not directly identified with JesusChrist (Vogt 1969 : 360 – 361, 367 – 368). Ornamentalreflecting mirrors hung on Sen ̃or Esquipulas maydenote the ancient link between the sun and mirrors(Chapter 3). His image is positioned in the east ofthe chapel in accord with the position of the risingsun. In the year renewal rites, three silver necklacesare placed around his neck during the daylight hours,apparently to evoke sunrise (Vogt 1976 : 128).Maya metaphors link the sun or Sun God withfire. The Tzeltal say that the sun carries fire from hismilpa around the sky (Nash 1970 : 311). The Tzotzilof Chenalho ́ say that the sun is fire and light (Guite-ras Holmes 1961 : 152, 292). Chamula names de-scribing the Sun God relate him to heat and fire, andone of his names is Our Father Heat (Gossen 1974b :31). On the fourth day of the five-day Festival ofGames in February, Chamula’s Carnival officials runback and forth along a path of burning thatch in afire walk that dramatizes the first ascent of the Sun /Christ into heaven (Gossen 1986 : 229 – 230, 246 –247, figs. 1– 2). Solar heat naturally evokes an imageof solar fire, a metaphorical link also seen in Preco-lumbian times (Chapter 3).Under certain conditions, the sun is associatedwith death. Winahel, located in the sun, is the abodeof young children when they die, and of peoplestruck by lightning or drowned as well as of womenwho die in childbirth, according to the Tzotzil ofChenalho ́ (Guiteras Holmes 1961 : 143, 258). Simi-larly, Aztec accounts record that women who died inchildbirth are the companions of the sun until itreaches the western horizon.THE SUN GOD23"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"the Virgin, is the moon. Tired of his two older broth-ers teasing him, he transforms them into pigs (Gui-teras Holmes 1961 : 183 –186). A Chol tale identifiesthe moon as the mother of three boys, and the sunis the youngest of the brothers, as in the Tzotzil leg-end (Whittaker and Warkentin 1965 : 35 – 42). Herethe sun’s older brothers are maize farmers. Becausethey mistreat him, the future sun kills his elderbrothers, so he has to learn how to plant maize froman old man. The sun clears his field during the day,but finds that each night the brush has grown back.By staying up all night he finds out that a rabbit iscausing the plants to grow back, so he captures therabbit and gives it to his lunar mother. But he getstired of planting and decides to climb up the beamof the house to the sky. He carries a chicken withhim, and his mother follows him carrying her rabbit;then they become the sun and the moon. Here thesolar bird is a domesticated one introduced from Eu-rope, but more commonly the avian transformationof the sun is a hummingbird, a solar image that canbe traced back to Precolumbian times (Chapter 3).In a tale of three brothers from the Cakchiquel ofSan Antonio, the sun and the moon are elder broth-ers who are farmers (Thompson 1970b : 357). Theyturn their younger brother into a monkey when hetells their grandmother they are using magical hoesto do the work. Then they kill their grandmother bythrowing her into a sweat bath and then into a fire.A Mopan tale from Belize makes the three broth-ers blowgun hunters who provide their grandmotherwith meat (Thompson 1970b : 355 – 356). When shedoes not share it with them, they kill her, after turn-ing their younger brother into a monkey because herefuses to go along with the scheme. In Thompson’s(1930 : 60 – 63, 120 –125) earlier versions of the tale,the eldest brother is Lord Xulab, or Nohoch Ich (BigEye), identified as both the planet Venus and theMorning Star; the middle child is the Sun (LordKin), and the youngest brother is T’up, who was tobecome Mars or Jupiter. The three hunt with theirblowguns, bringing the dead birds to their grand-mother (the aged moon?), who gives the meat toher tapir lover. The elder brothers (Venus and theSun) plot to kill her, because she gives them nothingto eat. In another Mopan account, the elder andThe Sun God also influences human health. TheTzotzil pray to the sun at sunrise and sunset for goodhealth (Thompson 1970b : 238). The Yucatec Mayaof Yalcoba ́ say that when the sun is rising or at anoverhead position at noon, it can send disease; thehme`endisposes of illness by sweeping it into a caveon the western horizon so that the sun will carry itoff to the underworld at sunset (Sosa 1985 : 447). TheYucatec Maya of Maxcanu ́ say that the spirits linkedwith death and sickness come out at noon. When thesun reaches its midnight position, it is ‘‘in the earth’’and the danger of the night has passed away as thesun moves toward sunrise (Armador 1995 : 313). Aswe will see, a similar belief is recorded in Yucatecsources from the Colonial period, for in times ofpestilence people made offerings to the sun at noonto prevent illness (Chapter 3). The noon sun may beconnected with illness because the sun’s rays are dan-gerously strong at this time.Originally, the sun made by Kak’och only illu-minated the upper heavens, but then the creatorgod made the sun A ̈k Tet to bring light to the earth(Bruce 1976 : 77). Another Lacando ́ n solar god,A ̈k’inchob (cross-eyed lord), is the husband of themoon and the god of the milpa. A Tzotzil accountfrom Chamula says that the sun gave mankind maizefrom his body as a hot food that came from his groin(Gossen 1974b : 40). The Sun God is frequently men-tioned in relation to Maya agriculture, reflecting theessential link between the sun and maize.A Chol tale says that the moon had two children,and the younger one became the sun of our world(Cruz Guzma ́ n 1994). Before he was transformedinto the sun, the younger brother was a hunterwhose older brother was lazy and jealous. He lay inhis hammock when the younger brother went out tohunt birds. While hunting, the future sun found atree filled with honey, which led to discord betweenthe brothers. As a result, the world order waschanged. The younger brother was transformed intothe sun, and the world became what it is today. Atthis point, the sun introduced maize agriculture.In most Maya tales that involve three brothers, thesun’s relationship with one or both of his siblings isnot harmonious. A Tzotzil tale from Chenalho ́ hasJesus Christ in the role of the sun, and his mother,24CONTEMPORARY MAYA IMAGES OF THE HEAVENS"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"younger brother of the Sun are both aspects of Ve-nus, representing the Morning Star and the EveningStar (Thompson 1970b : 343). The tale of a celestialfamily with Sun as the middle brother is also seen inPrecolumbian times (Chapter 3).A Chol tale is very similar, but there are someinteresting substitutions (Thompson 1967 : 30 – 31).The moon had seven children by a father who died.The widowed mother sends her children to work inthe milpa so that she and the sun can have inter-course. She becomes pregnant, and the son of the sunis born wearing a small red hat and red trousers, car-rying a machete in hand. His jealous half-brotherskill him, but he revives and returns home carrying apeccary. The same thing repeats the next day. On thethird day they take him to the forest, where Son ofthe Sun asks his brothers to climb up and fetch somehoney from the tree, but they throw down only wax.Angered, he gets the moles to eat the tree roots, fell-ing the tree and smashing the brothers. Later thedead brothers are converted into animals.A Tzeltal astronomical tale describes how YaxKahkal (Green or First Sun) chops up his brother,the youngest in the family (Thompson 1967 : 28 –30 n. 7). Marianna Slocum (1965a) records a similaraccount, translating the older brother’s name as BlueSun. The wasps and bees collect the pieces, restoringthe younger brother to life. The younger brother asksBlue Sun to climb a tree and throw down somehoney, but he only throws down wax. Angered, theyounger brother cuts down a tree, and Blue Sun issmashed to pieces that become the animals of theforest. The grandmother tried to seize the animals,but was only able to capture the rabbit, so that iswhat you see today on the face of the moon.Another Tzeltal version of the tale makes Grand-mother Moon the mother of three boys. Here it isthe two elder brothers who climb the tree, angeringtheir younger brother (the future sun) because theythrow down only wax, which in Tzeltal is the sameas the word for excrement (Nash 1970 : 198 – 201).The tree falls and the elder brother turns into a pig;the second brother is transformed into a wild boar(peccary). The youngest brother becomes the sunwhen he picks up the fire from his milpa and goesup into the sky to walk around; the moon followshim, which is why the day walks in front and thenight walks behind. This is when time began.The sun brings order and continuity to the world.Among contemporary Yucatec Maya, each dramaticbreak in history is a ‘‘new sun,’’ the current sun orworld age being that initiated by the Spanish con-quest (Armador 1995 : 316). Similarly, the Tzotzil saythat the fourth creation took place about four hun-dred years ago (Gossen 1974a : 221).We can conclude that in many tales the sun is aculture hero who is accorded great respect, some-times even assigned the role of the supreme deity.The Sun God brings maize agriculture to the worldor he produces maize in a more conventional fash-ion. The sun is hardworking and possesses manyother personality traits considered to be positive.Occasionally, the sun has negative qualities, as whenit sends disease at noon, an image that warns peopleabout the dangerous rays of the noonday sun. Sometales say that the sun kills his brothers. Sibling rivalrytranslates into astronomical imagery that pairs thesun with an elder brother embodying the moon orthe Morning Star, rivals of a younger brother repre-senting another planet or the Evening Star.IMAGES OF ECLIPSESThe dependence the Maya feel on the sun is reflectedin their great fear of solar eclipses. The sun is thelifeblood of the people, and even a temporary loss oflight is threatening. In traditional Maya communi-ties, the people make as much noise as possible toavert calamity during an eclipse (Redfield and VillaRojas 1962 : 206 – 207; B. Tedlock 1992b : 184). Thenoise scares off the agent of the eclipse, usually iden-tified as some sort of animal monster devouring thesun. People abstain from all normal activity during asolar eclipse. For example, in the Yucatec commu-nity of Maxcanu ́ , women will not make tortillas andmen will not farm or hunt; the animals may changetheir character during an eclipse, and the imple-ments of work (digging sticks, knives, machetes) cancome to life and attack their owners unless they aremarked with a cross (Armador 1995 : 314).The Maya believe that solar eclipses are more dan-gerous than lunar eclipses (Ilı ́a Na ́ jera 1995; Rem-IMAGES OF ECLIPSES25"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"chael Closs (1989) concludes that Venus is an eclipseagent among the Maya today, as in Precolumbiantimes. The Lacando ́ n accounts say that the creatorgod, Hacha ̈kyum, attacks the moon, causing a lunareclipse; the moon defends herself with her loom, buther strength is not sufficient, and she is finally cov-ered (Ra ̈tsch and Ma’ax 1984 : 43).Terms for eclipses in Yucatec Mayan reveal spe-cific symbolism (Barrera Va ́ squez 1980; Ilı ́a Na ́ jera1995). The termchi’bil(bite) is apparently used forpartial eclipses, an expression that makes sense inlight of what one sees during a partial solar eclipse.For total solar eclipses the Yucatec Maya saytupa’an(put out the flame) andtupa’an u wich k’inortupulu wich k’in,meaning to ‘‘blind or erase the sun.’’ Thetermtupul u wich u’is used for a lunar eclipse, evok-ing parallels with Precolumbian imagery of lunareclipses showing the Moon Goddess with her eyesshut (Chapter 4). The Tojolabal Maya of Chiapas de-scribe a solar eclipse with the termcha’ k’ab’u,refer-ring to the end of the sun, implying that the sun dies(Ilı ́a Na ́ jera 1995 : 323).Thompson (1960 : 11, 231) notes that the wide-spread Mesoamerican belief that eclipses are fightsbetween the sun and the moon is not shared by theMaya; nevertheless, a number of Maya accounts usethis explanation for eclipses. The Tzeltal, Tzutujil,and the Pokomchı ́ believe that eclipses are caused byfights between the sun and the moon. PrecolumbianAztec images suggest that the sun and the moon arefighting during eclipses (Milbrath 1995b, 1997). Im-ages that account for eclipses as fights suggest an un-derstanding that the relative position of the sun andthe moon causes eclipses.Some Tojolabal accounts say that the sun and themoon come together in a sexual union at the time ofan eclipse (Ba ́ ez-Jorge 1988 : 244). Others say that themoon is furious and bites the sun during a solareclipse, but they attribute lunar eclipses to an attackby black ants (Ilı ́a Na ́ jera 1995 : 323). Such a distinc-tion between the causes of lunar and solar eclipsessuggests observations made of the relative positionsof the sun and the moon, for the new moon passingin front of the sun makes it look as if the moon takesa bite out of the sun; but because lunar eclipses occurwhen the sun and the moon are at opposite sides ofington 1977 : 79). Some say that the world will cometo an end during a solar eclipse. According to theChortı ́, an eclipse of the sun that lasts more than aday will bring the end of the world, and the spirits ofthe dead will come to life and eat those on earth(Fought 1972 : 428 – 429). The Yucatec of X-Cacalsay that Don Juan Tutul Xiu will destroy the earth onthe day that the sun is covered by a black curtain(eclipsed) if the Maya do not maintain their inde-pendence from the conquerors (Villa Rojas 1945 :154). The Lacando ́ n believe that the destructions ofthe world in previous eras all began with an eclipse,and a total eclipse will precede the end of this world(Closs 1989 : 393). They say an earthquake will comewith an eclipse at the end of the world, and Kisin willawake and kick the pillars of the earth, splitting theearth so that the jaguars come out and eat most ofthe people (Perera and Bruce 1982 : 114 –115). Themoon is also threatened, and she carries loom sticksto protect herself against the jaguars that will be letloose from the underworld when this world comesto an end (Thompson 1970b : 246).The most common explanation for eclipses amongthe Maya is that there is an animal devouring the sunor moon. Michael Closs (1989 : 390 – 398) notes thatthe agent of solar and lunar eclipses is the same inmost cases. Sometimes the animal is a jaguar or atigre,but more often it is an ant. Precolumbian Mayaimages show animals biting the symbol for solareclipse; however, none represent ants (Chapter 4).Accounts of lunar eclipses frequently mention afeline. The Chol describe a lunar eclipse as ‘‘redmoon,’’ when atigreseizes the moon (Iwaniszewski1992 : 131). The Chontal Maya say that a jaguar de-vours the moon during an eclipse (Villa Rojas 1969 :236). The Tzotzil of Chenalho ́ say that Poslob eatsthe sun or the moon during an eclipse; he is a jaguarwho appears as balls of fire (Guiteras Holmes 1961 :152, 227, 292). The Yucatec Maya say that lunareclipses are caused by a jaguar or an ant called Xulab,a name for Venus in some Maya folktales (Redfieldand Villa Rojas 1962 : 206; Thompson 1970b : 235).Xulab can be translated as ‘‘to cut,’’ suggesting theleafcutter ant and the semicircular bite they takeout of leaves, apparently evoking the image of aneclipse (Lamb, personal communication 1996). Mi-26CONTEMPORARY MAYA IMAGES OF THE HEAVENS"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"the sky at the full moon, the Tojolabal invoke a thirdparty as the cause of lunar eclipse.A number of Maya communities say that theeclipsed body is ill in some respect, considerablyweakened or dying. The Cakchiquel believe that thesun and the moon die during an eclipse (Remington1977 : 79). The Tzotzil Maya of Zinacanta ́ n say thatthe moon blackens or dies during an eclipse, andsimilar descriptions are applied to the sun duringa solar eclipse (Laughlin 1988 : 388). A related be-lief about the moon is recorded among the Tzotzilof Chenalho ́ (Guiteras Holmes 1961 : 152). On theother hand, the Chortı ́ say that the Moon Goddessloses her powers of fecundity during a lunar eclipse(Wisdom 1940 : 400).Throughout the Maya area, eclipses are believedto cause illness and death and to be particularly dan-gerous to pregnant women (Ilı ́a Na ́ jera 1995 : 325).The Tzotzil of Chenalho ́ ascribe different kinds ofillness to eclipses associated with different directionsand colors (Guiteras Holmes 1961 : 36). In Zinacan-ta ́ n, eclipses forecast famine and death and occurwhen the souls of evil people try to kill the sun orthe moon (Laughlin 1975 : 58). The Lacando ́ n saythat if there is a solar eclipse, a man will die; if thereis a lunar eclipse, a woman will die (Bruce 1979 :181). Lunar eclipses are also linked with the deathof Tzotzil women at San Pedro Chenalho ́ (GuiterasHolmes 1961 : 152, 292). People of this village saythat great birds of prey can come down and take outyour eyes during a solar eclipse (Guiteras Holmes1961 : 153). This metaphor expresses the belief thatsolar eclipses cause blindness, no doubt a warningabout the real dangers of watching a solar eclipse.Despite fears that eclipses bring famine, illness,and death, the Lacando ́ n and Quiche ́ watch the reflec-tion of eclipse events in containers of water (B. Ted-lock 1992b : 184). During a lunar eclipse, the Tzotzilof Zinacanta ́ n place a bowl of water outside so thatthe moon can ‘‘wash her face.’’ In Precolumbiantimes, eclipses were probably also observed in stonebasins and bowls of water, and in mirrors made ofreflective stones.The Maya fear eclipses because they are irregularevents that are often linked with predictions aboutthe end of the world. Eclipse events cannot be pre-dicted without access to sophisticated tables un-known to traditional Maya communities. The eclipseagent is an animal, sometimes the same one that willdevour people at the end of the world. In some cases,fights between the sun and the moon cause eclipses,an explanation that apparently recognizes that therelative position of the sun and the moon causeseclipses. Accounts that make an ant the cause ofeclipses seem to refer to Venus as the third party re-sponsible for eclipses (see below).THE LUNAR RHYTHMSThere are a number of different explanations forwhy the moon disappears during conjunction (newmoon). The Chortı ́ believe that the new moon is vis-iting the land of the dead (Girard 1949 : 467 – 468).The Tzotzil of Chenalho ́ say that the new moon isdead, and evil is rampant because the protectinglight of the moon is lacking (Guiteras Holmes 1961 :35). Thompson (1960 : 111, 238) concludes that theYucatec Maya, past and present, share the belief thatwhen the moon disappears in conjunction, she goesto the land of rain, the abode of the Chacs, or shegoes to a lake, a well, or a cenote.Although the Quiche ́ of Momostenango count thelunar month from the first appearance of the cres-cent after conjunction, farmers and midwives preferto count the months from full moon to full moonbecause of the difficulty of sighting the first cres-cent (B. Tedlock 1992b : 182 –183). Ko ̈ hler (1980 :593) maintains that among contemporary Maya themonth is usually counted from first visibility. How-ever, Thompson (1960 : 236) notes that some Tzeltal,Chol, and Tzotzil villages of Chiapas begin the monthwhen the moon disappears in conjunction.One persistent problem is that Maya terms for thefirst visible crescent seem to be counterparts for ourtermnew moon,referring to the invisible moon dur-ing conjunction. This terminology has led to con-fusion in the literature with the English termnewmoon.For example, the Tzotzil of San Andre ́ s La-rraı ́nzar use the term’ach’ hme’tik(new our mother)to refer to the first visible crescent. Similarly, an EarlyColonial period dictionary of the Tzotzil of Zinacan-ta ́ n refers to first visibility with the phrases’ach ’uTHE LUNAR RHYTHMS27"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"months into three seasons: the months with cold (De-cember –February), the months with wind and rain(June – October), and the months with heat (March –May; Ba ́ ez-Jorge 1983 : 388 – 389, 1988 : 247).(new moon) andnach’ ’u(have new moon appear;Ko ̈ hler 1991a : 319 – 320).The Quiche ́ namenic’aj ic’(half moon) applies tothe phase we call the first quarter, which seems ap-propriate because the moon is half illuminated at thistime (B. Tedlock 1992b : 183). The waxing gibbousmoon ischak’ajic(maturing or ripening). Accord-ing to Guillermo Sedat (1955), the waxing moon inQuiche ́issa’xca xq’uic,a name that alludes to thegoddess Blood Woman. The term for the full moonisxoroc li po,meaning ‘‘to make the moon round.’’The Quiche ́ also say that the full moon is masculine,identifying it as the nocturnal equivalent of the sun,because its movements at this time resemble those ofthe sun (B. Tedlock 1992b : 183).Maya descriptions of lunar phases often implythat the moon ages over the course of the month,and the Maya sometimes refer to the first visiblecrescent as a baby or child. The Tzotzil of Zinacan-ta ́ n compare the full moon to an old person or oldcorn (yih;Laughlin 1975 : 74, 385). The Quiche ́saythat the waxing moon is ‘‘our mother,’’ and thewaning moon is an old woman called ‘‘our grand-mother’’ (B. Tedlock 1992a : 31; 1992b : 183 –184).The Zoques, living just beyond the Maya area inChiapas, assign age grades to the lunar phases, forthey relate the new moon to people who are threeyears or under, whereas the waning moon is relatedto people who are sixty-five years or older (Ba ́ ez-Jorge 1988 : 247). In a similar fashion, the Preco-lumbian Maya Moon Goddess has both a youthfuland aged aspect, apparently related to lunar phases(Chapter 4).Among the Tzutujil, the lunar months are linkedwith the Marı ́as and Martı ́ns, representing a female-male dichotomy with twelve females or twelve males,or six females and six males (Tarn and Prechtel 1986 :175 –176, 180 –181). The festivals of female saints(Marı ́as) dominate the dry season, whereas the Mar-tı ́ns are associated with the wet season. The thir-teenth month is the intercalary month identifiedwith the demonic Francisca Batz’bal.Although the Zoques of Chiapas are not Maya,their proximity to the Maya area provides an interest-ing comparative dimension. They divide the lunar28CONTEMPORARY MAYA IMAGES OF THE HEAVENSDuring the waxing moon, animals, plants, trees,and people are considered to be tender, thus theQuiche ́ avoid butchering, harvesting, woodcutting,and sexual relations. During the waning moon, how-ever, these activities become propitious (Tedlock1983 : 66 – 67). This is the time that the moon is ma-ture or hard, and she remains that way until she is‘‘buried’’ (conjunction).Cycles of illness are connected with the changinglunar phases. For example, the Tzotzil say that bro-ken bones become painful during the waning moon(Laughlin 1975 : 74). In Quintana Roo, the YucatecMaya say that the full moon induces epileptic fitsand the waning moon is dangerous to those whoare gravely ill (Ba ́ ez-Jorge 1988 : 256). They say thatin life-threatening disease, if the patient makes itthrough the period of the waning moon, there willbe improvement during the waxing moon (VillaRojas 1945 : 136; 1969 : 275). On the other hand, tu-mors and pustules grow larger as the moon waxes,according to the Yucatec Maya of Dzitas (Thompson1972 : 50). The Tojolabal say that the waxing mooninfects wounds, whereas the waning moon cureswounds (Ba ́ ez-Jorge 1988 : 248 – 249). For this rea-son, the Moon Goddess is the patroness of medicineor disease among a number of Maya cultures, suchas the Cakchiquel and Kekchı ́ (Thompson 1970b :243; 1972 : 50 –51). It comes as no surprise, there-fore, that the Moon Goddess appears in a number ofPrecolumbian Maya medical almanacs (Chapter 4).The relationship between the moon and eventson earth can be seen in tides that affect fishing andsalt harvesting. Even in highland communities farfrom the coast, there seems to be a connection be-tween the moon and salt, as among the Tzotzil,who call the Virgin (the moon) ‘‘our lady of the salt’’(Laughlin and Karasik 1988 : 205).It is noteworthy that the Maya believe a numberof different cycles in nature respond to the lunarphases. The strongest relationship can be noted inthe cycles of plants, discussed at length in the section"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"on lunar agriculture (see below). Other importantlunar cycles are noted in beekeeping. For example,the Tojolabal say that the waning moon ‘‘conserveshoney and wax,’’ hence they extract honey at thistime (Ba ́ ez-Jorge 1988 : 248 – 249).Many agree that the moon is linked with rain, al-though the phase associated with rainfall differs fromgroup to group. The Tojolabal Maya say that the newmoon ‘‘brings water,’’ whereas at the time of the fullmoon ‘‘rain goes away’’ (Ba ́ ez-Jorge 1988 : 248). TheChortı ́ Maya explain that the waning quarter moonis a pot tipped over that allows water to spill out,whereas the full moon is a full pot that retains wa-ter, except that aredfull moon brings rain (Fought1972 : 387; Girard 1949 : 466, 1962 : 134). Similarly,the Yucatec Maya call the full moon ‘‘full pot moon’’(Redfield and Villa Rojas 1962 : 205). The Quiche ́and Cakchiquel say that the rains are most abundantduring the new moon and full moon (Remington1977 : 80 – 81). These beliefs may be based on obser-vations of nature, for scientific evidence also suggestsa link between the lunar phases and variations inrainfall. One study published inSciencenoted a peakin rainfall near the middle of the first and thirdweeks of the synodical month, especially on the thirdto fifth days after the new moon and full moon(Bradley et al. 1962).Color is another aspect of the moon that the Mayawatch with great interest. Generally, the moon is vi-sualized as white, but changes in color are deemedsignificant. The Chol of Buena Vista say that therains come when there is a ‘‘red moon,’’ and theybelieve a ‘‘blackened moon’’ will also bring rain(Iwaniszewski 1992 : 131).A number of Maya groups link changes in the po-sition of the crescent moon to variations in rainfall.The Achı ́ of Cubulco, who speak a Quiche ́ dialect,describe the lunar position in different seasons byusing hand gestures. They say that the moon is ‘‘up-right’’ during the dry season, with the crescent formturned in such a way that the water is unable to getout. When it is rainy, the moon is ‘‘lying on its side’’with the crescent turned sideways so the water canspill out, which they show by using their hands toimitate the crescent moon tipping over to pour water(Neuenswander 1981). Hand gestures are also partof the terminology for phases of the moon amongthe Tzotzil (Ko ̈ hler 1991b : 238). They say that whenthe crescent moon is horizontal, it does not have wa-ter, but when it shifts to the right it carries water. Thetipped orientation certainly indicates a rainy sea-sonal position. The Tzutujil say that the moon holdsrainwater and slowly turns sideways as the rainy sea-son approaches until the water spills out in the formof rain (Tarn and Prechtel 1986 : 176). The positionof the newly emerged crescent moon is directly re-lated to the seasons. In fact, modern astronomicalcharts show that the first visible crescent moon is‘‘tipped’’ over from June to November, which cor-responds roughly to the Mesoamerican rainy season(Ottewell 1990).Contemporary Maya people observe the moon inrelation to the solar seasons. The Achı ́ of Cubulco inAlta Verapaz divide the year into two seasons, andthey say that in the rainy season, the moon is full ofwater (Neuenswander 1981). They believe that themoon’s water content determines the beginning andend of the rainy season.The Quiche ́ track the sidereal cycle of the moonthrough the background of stars, noting the moon’spositions in relation to the day names of the 260-daycalendar (B. Tedlock 1992b : 191–196, fig. 37). Theycount off a triple set of sidereal lunar months (3327.32167 days581.96501 days), reckoning this fig-ure as 82 days. They visit different mountain shrinesin accord with this period and a 65-day count thatruns simultaneously. During these visits, they look atboth the phase and sidereal position of the moon.Our month tracks the moon’s changing phases,but the Maya recognize many other lunar rhythms.They observe the position of the crescent and thecolor of the moon as well as the lunar phases topredict rainfall. The lunar cycles are linked to therhythms of the seasons, especially in relation to thechanging position of the first crescent moon. Lunarphases are also believed to influence cycles of illness.There is a widespread belief that the phase of lunarconjunction (new moon) involves a visit to the un-derworld, often linked with a watery place, such as acave or a well. Other lunar rhythms are built intoTHE LUNAR RHYTHMS29"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"been ‘‘buried’’ (the waxing crescent; Redfield andVilla Rojas 1962 : 205 – 206). Another account saysroot crops are best planted three days after full moon(Sosa 1985 : 456). One Yucatec Maya lunar calendarcalls for maize, beans, and squash to be planted onthe full moon of May or June, but all other activitiesthat involve the crops are to take place during thewaning moon (Pe ́ rez 1946 : 204).The Tzotzil of Chenalho ́ say that seeds will notsprout if planted during the new moon, for whenthe moon is dead and she is walking with her son(the sun), the seed will never be returned (GuiterasHolmes 1961 : 35, 41, 45). They prefer to plant maizearound the full moon, at the time of the ‘‘maturemoon’’ (which lasts three days). This is also the timeto plant squash and beans. The mature-moon phasecan be extended to include both the waxing and wan-ing gibbous moon, allowing for nine days of agricul-tural activity. The mature moon is also the preferredtime for felling trees and for bending the maize stalks,although there seems to be a tendency to bend themaize stalks during the waxing phase (GuiterasHolmes 1961 : 35, 153). On the other hand, a Tzotziltext from Chamula recorded in 1968 notes that theywait until the full moon to double over the corn as thefirst phase of the harvest (Gossen 1974a :252). Simi-larly, the Tzotzil of Zinacanta ́ n say that harvesting ofthe maize must be done only when the moon is full,which is also the time to fell trees so that the wood willnot be attacked by insects (Vogt 1997).Other Maya groups show similar variations in theirbeliefs about lunar agriculture. Some of the Chortı ́say that the best time for planting is four days beforelunar conjunction; others say the four days after thefirst appearance of the moon are the best, or theyrecommend planting during the waxing moon sothat the seed will have the best chance of germina-tion (Girard 1949 : 466; Wisdom 1940 : 400). A con-trary notion is expressed by the Tojolabal Maya, whosay that the waxing moon ruins the seeds, whereasplants grow rapidly during the waning moon, thepreferred time to plant maize and beans (Ba ́ ez-Jorge1988 : 248 – 249). The Pokomchı ́ say that maguey andyucca and all sorts of plants are best planted by thefull moon, which is also the best time to cut poles forthe houses (Mayers 1958 : 38 – 39). The waning moonimagery of the Moon Goddess, who ages over thecourse of the month.LUNAR AGRICULTUREThe moon’s role in the agricultural cycle may be onereason it has such a great importance among theMaya today. Quiche ́ farmers count from full moonto full moon (B. Tedlock 1985 : 84 – 85, 87; 1992a : 30;1992b : 183, 185, 189 –190). The calendar begins withclearing the fields around the full moon in February.The maize crop is named for the calendar day in the260-day count that corresponds to the full moon inMarch, when sowing must be complete. They deter-mine the date of the maize harvest by a calendarcount from the full moon that follows planting. Thefirst and second weeding must be performed at thetime of the full moon. They harvest black beans andthe first ears of corn at the time of the full moon.The waxing moon, when the moon is female, is theappropriate time for the annual planting of driedmaize kernels and black beans (B. Tedlock 1992b :185). The fact that most aspects of the Quiche ́ maizecycle are timed by the full moon, which is male, mayaccount for the imagery of the moon merged withthe Maize God in Classic Maya iconography (Chap-ter 4).The nine-month growing period of mountainmaize among the Quiche ́ parallels the nine-monthperiod for human gestation (B. Tedlock 1992b :190). Ideally, the crops will come to fruition on thesame day number and name in the 260-day calendaras when they were sown. The Quiche ́ identify the260-day cycle as the lunar agrarian year (Alvarado1975 : 76; Leo ́ n 1954 : 38). This may be linked withthe fixed 260-day agricultural calendar found in anumber of Maya cultures.There is considerable variety in the beliefs aboutlunar agriculture among the Yucatec Maya. The fullmoon after the first rains is the optimum plantingtime for maize, according to some accounts (Pe ́ rez1942 : 17 –18). The people of Chan Kom say thatmaize can be planted during any lunar phase; vinesshould be planted at the new moon, and the besttime for planting fruit trees and root crops is whenthe moon is full or three days after the moon has30CONTEMPORARY MAYA IMAGES OF THE HEAVENS"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"is not good for cutting wood or planting because theproduce will be wormy. On the other hand, the Cholof Buena Vista say that planting and woodcuttingshould be avoided during the waxing moon, and thefull moon is appropriate for planting tomatoes, butmost other crops do better planted during the wan-ing moon, except for maize, which can be plantedin any phase of the moon (Iwaniszewski 1992 :131–132).We can conclude that the lunar phases best suitedfor different activities clearly vary from group togroup. Nevertheless, all seem to share a belief thatthe moon and agriculture are closely linked, andobservation of the phases of the moon are espe-cially important in timing agricultural activities. Themost commonly preferred time for planting maize isaround the full moon, and a number of other eventsin the maize cycle are timed by the full moon.THE CELESTIAL PAIRThe sun and the moon, being very close in size at thetime of the full moon, form a natural sky pair. Mayalegends underscore a close relationship between thesun and the moon, with the sun ruling day and themoon ruling night. The notion of a day mirror anda night mirror representing the sun and the moonrespectively is seen in a Kekchı ́ Maya tale from Be-lize. The legend tells us that long ago the sun placeda mirror in the center of the sky. Each day the SunGod traveled from the east to the center and retracedhis path back to the east, but the mirror made it seemthat he continued to the west; at night the mirrorimage of the moon traveled across the sky in thesame manner (Thompson 1930 : 132). The Kekchı ́tale goes on to explain that the moon’s light was toobright for people to sleep, so Lord Kin gouged outone of the moon’s eyes. Similarly, a Mopan legendfrom Belize recounts that when the sun and themoon ascended into heaven to take up their duties,they were equally bright, but people complainedthey could not sleep, so Sun took out one of Moon’seyes so she would not shine too brightly at night(Thompson 1967 : 35). These legends pair the sunand the full moon, but indicate that the moon is notas bright because it has only one eye.Other sets of oppositions involve the sun and themoon. They are often paired as husband and wifein Maya folklore; indeed, when they are marriedthey can share the same Ahau title in some high-land cultures. The moon and the sun as mother andson is another common pairing of opposite genders(Thompson 1967). An opposition of genders andqualities of temperature is seen in a Tzotzil accountthat says the male sun created maize, which has thequality of being hot; the female moon producedbeans, which are cold (Lo ́ pez-Austin 1994 : 108). Thesun gave humankind maize from his groin, whereasthe moon gave potatoes (her breast milk) and beans(her necklace).Many accounts indicate that the moon existed be-fore the sun. Often the female moon is older thanthe sun, as indicated by the moon’s role as motherof the sun and the common titles Father Sun andGrandmother Moon. Even when the pair are hus-band and wife, the moon seems to have priority,for the marriage of the Moon Goddess takes placein darkness before the sun and the moon take uptheir celestial duties (Thompson 1960 : 230; Watan-abe 1983 : 724 –725).The Quiche ́ and Cakchiquel traditions involvebrothers who are the sun and the moon, apparentlyan ancient tradition that can be traced back to thePopol Vuh, a narrative recorded in Quiche ́ some-time after the conquest and translated into Spanisharound 1701 (D. Tedlock 1985 : 28; Thompson 1967 :22). In the Popol Vuh, the sun and the moon aretwin brothers, which indicates a pairing of like be-ings rather than paired opposites. In this case, thelunar twin may represent the full moon (Chapter 4).We can see that when the moon and the sun arepaired together in primordial times, something usu-ally happens to the moon to darken it. The sun-moon pair establishes a series of oppositions: day-night, young-old, male-female, light-dark, and evenhot-cold.THE MOON GODDESSThe moon is often associated with motherhood,sometimes playing the role of the mother of the Mayapeople, as among the Chortı ́, who refer to the moonTHE MOON GODDESS31"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"the mother of the male moon, but the moon takeson a feminine quality when identified with the Vir-gin (Iwaniszewski 1992 : 133). This gender shift is ex-plained by beliefs that the moon’s waxing period isfemale and its waning is male. Gender ambiguity isalso a characteristic of the moon in Precolumbiantimes (Chapter 4).Jaguars may be connected with the moon amongthe Quiche ́ , especially the full moon (D. Tedlock1985 : 368 – 369). The jaguar may also be a lunar im-age among the Tzotzil. The Sun God and his jaguarcompanion are lifted up toward heaven to symbol-ize resurrection in the Carnival festival of Chamula(Gossen 1986 : 244). The timing of Carnival, basedon both lunar and solar observations linked withEaster, may encode a relationship between the sunand the jaguar as a representative of the moon. Ina like fashion, there seems to be a link betweenthe moon and jaguars in Precolumbian times (Chap-ter 4).Often the Moon Goddess has a rabbit, or the rab-bit itself is seen on the moon. A number of tales ex-plain how the Moon Goddess acquired her rabbit.The Chol say that the sun gave the rabbit to his lunarmother when he found the rabbit making the weedsgrow in his garden at night (Whittaker and Warken-tin 1965 : 35 – 42). They note that even when themoon is invisible, the rabbit remains in the sky(Iwaniszewski 1992 : 133). The Lacando ́ n say thatthe creator god Hacha ̈kyum made A ̈kna’ (the MoonGoddess), giving her a rabbit as a house pet andpainting a rabbit on her clothes. Precolumbian Mayaart often shows the moon deity with a rabbit.According to the Lacando ́n, A ̈kna’ has a weavingloom that is very bright: the loom is her light andher fire, but her fire is very cold (Ra ̈tsch and Ma’ax1984 : 43). Another lunar goddess, Ixchel, is thedaughter of Hacha ̈kyum (the creator god) and thewife of the ‘‘squint-eyed lord’’ (the sun); she is alsothe goddess of childbirth, weaving, and the moon(McGee 1990 : 65 – 66). Although nowhere is this ex-plicitly stated, A ̈kna’ and Ixchel may represent differ-ent lunar phases because the termt’a ̈la ̈kbal a ̈kna’re-fers specifically to the full moon (Bruce 1979 : 228).Other ethnographic accounts from the Maya arealink the moon with weaving. The Quiche ́ goddess ofas ‘‘our mother’’ (ka tu’;Wisdom 1940 : 400 n. 30).More often the moon is the sun’s mother, and some-times her duties as a mother are specified, as seen in atale from Chamula recounting that the moon is re-sponsible for feeding the sun maize gruel each morn-ing on the eastern horizon (Gossen 1974b : 40).Sometimes the moon is linked with the VirginMary, the archetypal mother. The Virgin has multi-ple aspects in Maya Catholicism ideally suited to avariety of lunar images. Seasonal festivals dedicatedto the Virgin may honor the moon at different timesof year. The seasonal cycle of the Virgin in Maya fes-tivals has yet to be explored in relation to lunarimagery.The Moon Goddess influences the female body aspatroness of fertility, pregnancy, and childbirth. TheTzotzil pray to the moon, the ‘‘Holy Mother,’’ forfertility, and they believe that a woman is most fertileat the full moon. Tzotzil women note the lunar phasewhen they miss their period, because they will givebirth after nine lunar months (Ko ̈ hler 1991b : 241).According to the Quiche ́ , the feminine moon rulesover birth; it gives women their menstrual cycle andstops the flow of blood during the nine lunationsof pregnancy (Earle and Snow 1985 : 243 – 244).Among the Quiche ́ Maya, menstruation is ‘‘theblood that stems from the moon’’ (Furst 1986 : 72).And the Itzaj Maya say ‘‘her moon lowered’’ when awoman menstruates (Hofling, personal communi-cation 1995). The Tzotzil say the moon menstruatesat the new moon (Lo ́ pez-Austin 1994 : 111). Those ofChenalho ́ say the moon and menstruation are re-lated (Guiteras Holmes 1961 : 106). The Maya wordu ́means ‘‘moon’’ and ‘‘menstruation’’ (Barrera Va ́s-quez 1980).Although the moon is predominantly female,there are some instances of gender transforma-tion. Data collected among the Quiche ́ show that themoon is generally female, but it becomes male atthe time of the full moon (B. Tedlock 1992b : 183).Some images suggest that the moon is a female ver-sion of the sun, as among the Lacando ́ n, who de-scribe the moon as a howler monkey, specifically afemale howler monkey known as ‘‘mother-sun’’ or‘‘lady-sun’’ (na’-k’in;Bruce 1979 : 141). Among theChol from Buena Vista in Chiapas, the female sun is32CONTEMPORARY MAYA IMAGES OF THE HEAVENS"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"embroidery is Ixchel; they say that she inspires de-signs in weaving that represent astronomical sym-bols (Leo ́ n 1945 : 43). The Tzotzil recount that themoon, the mother of the sun, is a poor woman whospins and weaves in exchange for corn (Ba ́ ez-Jorge1988 : 243). To revive the weaving tradition, theTzotzil weavers in Magdalenas prayed to the lunarVirgin to teach them to weave (Morris and Foxx1987 : 113). A legend recorded among the Kekchı ́inthe Mopan area says that the young moon was weav-ing when the sun visited her in the guise of a hum-mingbird, inspiring her to brocade this bird on thecloth (Thompson 1970b : 370). Among the Tzutujil,all things connected with weaving are female and arelinked to Grandmother Moon (Prechtel and Carlsen1988 : 123, 131). The thirteenth month representsFrancisca Batz’bal, the grandmother, the threadmaker, and the spindle itself. Twelve females namedMarı ́a, like the Virgin, represent the lunar monthsand the parts of the loom (Tarn and Prechtel 1986 :176 –178). In a similar fashion, Precolumbian Mayaimagery links the Moon Goddess with weaving(Chapter 4).The Moon Goddess is widely connected with wa-ter, including rainfall and water stored in jars tradi-tionally carried by Maya women. The Lacando ́ n referto September, the most rainy month, as ‘‘much rainsour Lady moon’’ (hahakna’;Bruce 1979 : 154). TheTzutujil say that the moon contains water that be-comes rain; the moon is the ‘‘lady of the stored wa-ter,’’ meaning the water jar, and she picks up waterand pours it over her body when it rains (Tarn andPrechtel 1986 : 174 –176). They note that the MoonGoddess wears a serpent rainbow on her head whenthere will be rain. Their beliefs are confirmed by me-teorologists, who note that a halo around the moonis a sign of rain (Hazen 1900).In addition to rainfall, the moon is also closelylinked with bodies of water. The Tzutujil say thatLake Amatitla ́ n was formed when some boys brokethe water jars belonging to the twelve Marı ́as, whorepresent the lunar months born out of the moon(Orellana 1977 : 194 –195; Tarn and Prechtel 1986 :174 –176). The people of the Tzotzil community ofChenalho ́ say that the moon is in some way related toall lakes, and they throw clothing into the lake as anoffering to the Virgin (Guiteras Holmes 1961 :203,292). The Cakchiquel say that the Moon Goddessowns Lake Amatitla ́ n (Thompson 1960 : 238). At theend of the dry season, the Pokomam Maya pray atLake Amatitla ́ n for the Virgin Mary (the Moon God-dess) to bring rain (Berlo 1984 : 181). For people liv-ing in Yucata ́ n, the Moon Goddess is connected withboth the cenote (well) and the sea, associations alsorecorded in Colonial period documents. For ex-ample, the eighteenth-centuryRitual of the Bacabsre-fers to the moon as ‘‘she in the middle of the cenote’’and ‘‘lady of the sea’’ (Thompson 1970b : 244 – 245).There is also a relationship between rainfall andthe Virgin in her aspect as the moon. Among theYucatec Maya, when thehme`enprays to the Chacsfor rain, he invokes the Moon Goddess in her guiseas the Virgin Mary (D. Thompson 1954 : 28). TheMaya of Quintana Roo say that she rides forth onhorseback as one of the Chacs.The moon’s monthly union with the sun is oftenvisualized as a marriage, but despite her condition asa married woman, the moon has a licentious naturein Maya folklore (Thompson 1970b : 243). In a Mo-pan tale from Belize, the sun suspects his wife is hav-ing an affair with his elder brother, Xulab (the futureMorning Star), and to punish the couple he feedsthem a tamale filled with a mixture that makes themvomit (Thompson 1967 : 34 – 35).A number of tales involve the sun’s longing for themoon, imagery that evokes the union of the sun andthe moon during conjunction. There are a variety oftales among the Kekchı ́, Mopan, and Cakchiquelthat tell about the lovesick sun capturing the moon(Preuss 1995; Thompson 1970b : 365). In a Mopantale, the sun transforms into a hummingbird tocourt the Moon Goddess (XT’actani), but after he isfelled by her grandfather’s blowgun, he resumes hishuman form and persuades her to elope with him ina canoe during the night (Thompson 1967 : 31– 32;1970b : 363 – 364). To escape, the sun hides the crystalor jade (thesastun) that allows the grandfather tosees everything and everywhere, but the old man en-lists the aid of one of the Chacs, who hurls a thun-derbolt at the couple. At that moment, the sun turnshimself into a turtle and the moon into a crab. Thesun escapes injury, but the moon is killed. She isTHE MOON GODDESS33"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"1960 : 218). The Chol name for Venus in both morn-ing and evening aspects islucero(luminary one),which can be applied to other planets if Venus is ab-sent from the sky (Iwaniszewski 1992 : 132).Catholic saints can also be connected with Venus.Santiago, a native war chief who speaks only Quiche ́,is the ‘‘great star’’ (nima chumil;Cook 1986 : 149).This is intriguing because among the Chortı ́, Santi-ago is the god of thunder and lightning who hasflames and fire as a war shield (Girard 1962 : 251).Precolumbian images also link Venus with a cult ofwarfare associated with Tlaloc (Chapter 5).Venus is also linked with the scorpion in Lacan-do ́ n names recorded by Blom and La Farge (1926 –1927, 2 : 469, 472; Carlson 1991). Another variant ofthe insect theme is seen in the Yucatec Maya namefor Venus,xux ek’,or ‘‘wasp star,’’ used for both theMorning Star and the Evening Star (Barrera Va ́ squez1980). Colonial period accounts from Yucata ́ n men-tion Venus as the ‘‘wasp star’’ (Roys 1972 : 96). Venusis ‘‘the great destroyer’’ (nah xulaab), a species ofant, among the Lacando ́ n (Bruce 1979 : 247; Bruceet al. 1971 : 15). Yucatec Maya accounts say that evil-smelling red ants or the king of leaf-cutting ants isan eclipse agent (Closs 1989 : 391, 398).In a Mopan tale already discussed, Lord Xulab, orNohoch Ich (Big Eye), is a bearded god who is theeldest of three brothers (Thompson 1930 : 60 – 63,120 –125, 129; 1970b : 250, 355 – 356). Venus as theelder brother of the sun represents a direct link be-tween the sun and Venus through kinship. LordXulab is the rival of the sun for the affections of theMoon Goddess. The Morning Star is a sort of ‘‘mas-ter of the animals’’ among the Kekchı ́ and Mopan.Thompson (1970b : 250) suggests that Xulab is the‘‘keeper of wild animals,’’ and that he is a god ofhunting linked to dawn because that is the besthunting time. Everything connected with huntingand fishing is under the care of Xulab (Villa Rojas1969 : 272).Venus is usually assigned the role of elder brother,which presumably would give the planet a positionof honor, but he is neither a model of good behaviornor of physical perfection (Thompson 1930 : 119 –140; 1960 : 218; Villa Rojas 1969 : 272). A number offolktales describe Venus as ugly or lazy. A Chol talerestored to life in thirteen days after dragonflies col-lect her flesh and blood in thirteen hollow logs.When she comes to life again, she has no vagina, soLord Kin calls on the deer to step on her to make animprint that forms her vagina (Thompson 1930 :126 –129). But this was not such a good idea becauseshortly thereafter she had an affair with his brother,the Venus god Lord Xulab!We can conclude that the Maya believe that themoon controls fertility in plants and people, cyclesof agriculture, disease, menstruation, and all formsof water, including rainfall. The Moon Goddess isoften connected with water-carrying, motherhood,and weaving — female activities appropriate to themoon’s female gender. The moon is predominantlyfemale, but it can change gender, especially at thetime of the full moon. Although the moon has affairswith other planets, her monthly union with the sunis often visualized as a form of marriage.VENUS AMONG THECONTEMPORARY MAYAWhen we look at contemporary Maya terms for Ve-nus we cannot help but be impressed by how manyvariants there are. No doubt these names reflectsubtle differences in various aspects of the planet.For example, the Lacando ́ n say that the MorningStar is ‘‘white earth’’ and the Evening Star is ‘‘whitesun,’’ located in the center of the earth (Ra ̈tsch1985 : 37 – 38). Alternate translations for the Morn-ing Star’s name include ‘‘white lord of the earth’’ or‘‘false lord of the earth’’ (a ̈h sa ̈h kab;Bruce et al.1971 : 15; McGee 1990 : 54 –55). Thompson (1970b :250) notes that the Morning Star is Ah Ahzah Cab(awakener) in both Lacando ́ n and Yucatec. The Eve-ning Star is ‘‘false sun’’ (a ̈h sa ̈h k’in;Bruce et al. 1971 :15) andah ocsah kin,a Yucatec expression for ‘‘hewho makes the sun enter,’’ implying that the Eve-ning Star is responsible for the setting sun (Stone1983 : 232).Names for Venus often refer to its large size orbrilliance. Among the Quiche ́ of Rabinal, Venus is‘‘great star,’’ and a similar meaning is conveyed bythe terms for Venus among the Manche Chol, Chuh,Tojolabal (Chaneabal), Mam, and Ixil (Thompson34CONTEMPORARY MAYA IMAGES OF THE HEAVENS"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"recounts that Venus, the elder brother of the Sun,is jealous and so aggressive that his mother (theMoon) has to protect the young Sun from him(Guzma ́ n et al. 1986). Venus is also lazy, and he liesin his hammock all day while his younger brothergoes hunting. This image probably reflects observa-tions that the Morning Star is ‘‘up’’ (visible) for onlya few hours in the morning, while the Sun workshard all day.Among the Kekchı ́, the Morning Star (KaacwaCakchahim) is not lazy, but he is ugly (Schackt 1986 :59, 176 –178). The Morning Star was originally the‘‘owner’’ of all wild animals. Also known as Sen ̃orLucero, the Morning Star was a very good hunterwho went out every morning and did not return un-til late at night. Because of the hours he kept, his wifedid not know how ugly he was. His face was coveredwith warts, and his hands and clothes were coveredwith blood from all the animals he hunted. He gotangry when she tried to see him at night, and hethrew all the animals away, and cursed women sothat they could eat only chili peppers.A number of Venus images express a relationshipwith the sun. The Kekchı ́ refer to the Morning Staras a dog running ahead of the sun (Thompson1970b : 250). The Quiche ́ say that Venus as the Morn-ing Star is the ‘‘carrier of the day’’ or the ‘‘carrier ofthe sun,’’ and Venus is the ‘‘sun passer’’ in the an-cient Quiche ́ tale of the Popol Vuh (Edmonson 1971 :170; D. Tedlock 1991). The Tzotzil Maya of Cha-mula describe Venus as ‘‘our lord sun /Christ’scandle’’ (Gossen 1982 : 29, Fig. 1). The role as acandle of the sun suggests an image of Venus, for thisplanet never strays far from the sun (Chapter 2).Some Maya accounts incorporate Venus as aCatholic saint or, more often, as the fallen angel, Lu-cifer. Various Tzotzil communities link Venus withSaint Thomas (Ko ̈ hler 1991c:252). Venus takes therole of Lucifer, or the ‘‘devil,’’ in a number of ac-counts (Closs 1989; Preuss 1995). At San Pedro Che-nalho ́ , a Tzotzil village, Lusibel (Lucifer) seems to berelated to Venus (Lamb 1995 : 275). He had been oneof two suns a long time ago, but was replaced by theChrist child (kox) because he did not give sufficientheat (Guiteras Holmes 1961 : 186). The notion ofVenus as a ‘‘sun’’ in a previous world age evokes alink with the central Mexican image of Quetzalcoatl(quetzal-serpent), the Venus god who was the sun ofa previous epoch (Codex Rı ́os, folio 6r).The Tzotzil of Zinacanta ́ n visualize the MorningStar as having both female and male aspects (Laugh-lin 1977 : 253 – 254; Laughlin and Karasik 1988 : 249;Vogt 1969 : 316 – 318). They say that Venus is ‘‘hewho eats the river snail,’’ indicating a masculinegender and possibly a specific seasonal aspect. Vogt(1997) notes that they refer to Venus as ‘‘eats snails’’during Lent. The Morning Star is also an ugly girlwho is the ‘‘elder sister.’’ Vogt (1969 : 316 – 317) alsoobserves that another name for the Morning Star isthe ‘‘sweeper of the path,’’ who prepares the way forthe rising sun. Although the star appears to be red, itis really a black Chamulan girl. Perhaps the gendershift has to do with comparing Venus to a womanin the role of the household sweeper. The imageryalso evokes comparisons with the Venus god of theAztecs, Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl, who wears black bodypaint and is described as the ‘‘sweeper of the path ofthe sun’’ (Sahagu ́ n 1950 –1982, 7 : 8). At Zinacanta ́n,Ehecatl appears in the Festival of St. Sebastian, whichtakes place at the end of January, about one monthbefore Carnival (Bricker 1981 : 138, 140, Fig. 21). Heis represented with a maize cob in his beak, and de-tails of the imagery suggest a quetzal bird, perhapsan embodiment of the fertility aspect of Venus asso-ciated with maize.A serpent aspect of Venus is known in Chiapas.One Tzotzil source identifies a Venus serpent knownasmukta ch’on(big serpent; Holland 1964 : 14 –15).Nonetheless, Robert Laughlin (personal communi-cation 1995) notes that in Tzotzil the plumed serpentisk’uk’ul ch’onand Venus ismuk’ta k’analor ‘‘great(big) star,’’ and there is no apparent connection be-tween the two. Generally, the Tzotzil seem to distin-guish Venus from the feathered serpent, a counter-part for Venus in central Mexico.Another serpent form of Venus is known fromYucata ́ n. The term for Venus,kan ek’,has a doublemeaning.Ek’signifies both ‘‘star’’ and ‘‘black,’’andkanmeans both ‘‘snake’’ and ‘‘four’’ (BarreraVa ́ squez 1980). This suggests a quadripartite na-ture, perhaps linked with the four phases of Ve-nus (Chapter 2). The name could also mean ‘‘starVENUS AMONG THE CONTEMPORARY MAYA35"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"of Hacha ̈kyum (McGee 1990 : 63). Although notexplicitly connected with Venus in modern lore, itseems that the feathered serpent in Lacando ́ n andYucatec lore is the counterpart of Kukulcan, a Pre-columbian Venus deity (Chapter 5).The Maya sometimes refer to the dual nature ofVenus, assigning different roles depending on thetime of visibility. The Morning Star is mentionedmore often than the Evening Star. Usually Venus isugly, stupid, or lazy. Sometimes he has a heavy beard,a trait that is not typical of the Maya. OccasionallyVenus is adulterous, a sin not to be taken lightly,given that the ancient punishment for adultery inYucata ́ n was disembowelment (Tozzer 1941 : 32).Animals associated with Venus include a dog, an ant,and a serpent. Venus is also often closely linked withthe sun, a natural image based on the fact that Venusalways is seen relatively close to the sun. The greatvariety of names applied to Venus reflect the planet’smultiple aspects. As we shall see, in Precolumbiantimes Venus had multiple personalities related to dif-ferent seasonal cycles (Chapter 5).THE PLANETS AMONGTHE CONTEMPORARY MAYAWe would expect that the planets would play a majorrole in the Maya legends and folk astronomy, butapart from Venus, very little is mentioned about theplanets. Mercury, the planet closest to the sun, seemsnot to be named in ethnographic accounts, andnames for Saturn also seem to be lacking. Informa-tion on Mars, the red planet, is surprisingly scanty.Mars is a blood-red star that moves in the sky andsends eye diseases, according to the Tzotzil (Hunt1977 : 144). Only a few names are known for Jupiter.In some cases, it may be too late to collect the infor-mation, because as far back as 1930 Thompson haddifficulty getting any information on the superiorplanets, those in outer orbits beyond Earth’s orbit.There are some tantalizing fragments of infor-mation about Jupiter. Some of the Tzotzil of SanPablo Chalchihuita ́ n identify theestrellaDomingo(St. Dominic?) with a large planet (rominko k’anal),possibly Jupiter (Ko ̈ hler 1991c : 253; Lamb 1995 :271, 276). In Zinacanta ́ n, Jupiter is known as ‘‘el-snake.’’ The Precolumbian serpent aspect of Venusin Yucata ́ n is well known as the feathered serpent,Kukulcan.Another possible serpent image of Venus is seenin the Chortı ́ Chicchan serpent, which is half-feath-ered and half-human, and sometimes wears fourhorns. Charles Wisdom (1940 : 393 – 397, 410 – 411)suggests that the Chicchan serpent is equivalent tothe ancient Maya feathered serpent. There are foursky Chicchans that produce most of the sky phe-nomena; each lives in one of the four world direc-tions at the bottom of a large lake. Some say theChicchans are actually pairs, and that at the norththere is a fifth pair, the most important of the Chic-chans. The northern Chicchan draws up the rains atthe time of the first solar zenith (May 1 in the Chortı ́area), a date closely linked with the Day of the Cross,celebrated on May 3 (Girard 1949 : 422, 456; Mil-brath 1980a : 291). Similarly, Tzotzil accounts of thehorned serpent link it with water and the Day of theCross in early May (Laughlin and Karasik 1988).These serpents could refer to Venus in a guise similarto Kukulcan.A modern Yucatec tale describes a snake boy whogrew up to become Kukulcan, a feathered snake witha (rattle?) tail. Colas is a boy who was born as asnake. He kept growing larger and larger, until itbecame apparent that he was the feathered serpentknown as Kukulcan (Burns 1983 : 246). Like thehorned serpent of the Tzotzil, Colas causes earth-quakes. Every year the snake flies out of its cave tocause an earthquake in the middle of July. Althoughnot stated in the tale, Colas means ‘‘tails’’ in Spanish,and one wonders whether this plural form refers tothe multiple rattles on the feathered serpent’s tailseen in Precolumbian imagery. As will be seen inChapters 5 and 7, the ancient feathered serpent is Ve-nus, and his rattle tail seems to be the Pleiades, aconstellation still known as the ‘‘rattlesnake’s rattle’’in Yucata ́ n. The Pleiades disappears from the sky inMay during conjunction and can be seen at dawn inJune. By July the constellation is well above the ho-rizon, at the time Colas (the Pleiades tail of theFeathered Serpent?) emerges from the cave.Among the Lacando ́ n, K’uk’ulcan, the featheredserpent, is a giant malevolent serpent who is the pet36CONTEMPORARY MAYA IMAGES OF THE HEAVENS"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"der brother star’’ or ‘‘senior star’’ (Laughlin 1975 :79, 458).A monkey appears prominently in a planetarytale. Apparently, the arboreal nature of monkeysevokes the connection with planets seen overhead.The sun’s younger brother is transformed into amonkey representing a planet, identified in one Mo-pan account as Mars or Jupiter, but in another he isthe Evening Star (Thompson 1930 : 120 –123, 138).The youngest brother (T’up) is made to climb a treewearing a blanket hanging down like a tail. He is toldto imitate the sounds of a spider monkey, and he istransformed into a monkey who is the ancestor of allthe monkeys. His name evokes a connection withT’uup, the Lacando ́ n spider monkey who is lordof the sun (Bruce 1979 : 203 – 204). T’uup resides inthe third tier of the layered cosmos described earlier(Fig. 1.1b).Sometimes general terminology links the differ-ent planets. Among the modern Quiche ́ , Venus orany other planet appearing as a bright star in theeast before dawn is called the ‘‘sun carrier,’’ andwhen any planet takes the role of Evening Star, it iscalledrask’a ̈k,meaning ‘‘of the night’’ (B. Tedlock1992b : 180).General terms can also refer to stars and planets.The Quiche ́ refer to the planets ascak ch’umil,mean-ing ‘‘red stars’’ (B. Tedlock 1992b : 180). The Tzotzilof Zinacanta ́ n use one term,k’anal(yellowish one),to refer to stars, planets, and constellations (Vogt1997 : 112 –113). They modify the term to refer tospecific planets, calling Venus ‘‘elder yellowish one,’’while ‘‘red star’’ (tsahal k’anal) can refer to Mars orthe star Arcturus in Bootes.Other terms seem to distinguish the ‘‘wander-ing’’ planets from the fixed stars. The contemporaryChortı ́ say that the planets are ‘‘watchers over theearth’’ that travel, whereas the fixed stars are firesthat are not seen traveling (Fought 1972 : 428). Thehighest heaven of the Lacando ́ n is reserved for theplanets, the ‘‘wandering gods’’ (Fig. 1.1b). A similarnotion is seen in a 1698 Quiche ́ dictionary by Do-mingo Basseta, which includes a term that may referto a planet ascabauil ichabera,glossed as ‘‘wanderingstar’’ (estrella vaga;Basseta 1698 : 71v).It is clear that the Maya recognize planets as beingdifferent from fixed stars. Nevertheless, planetary in-formation is scarce in published ethnographies. Thisleads one to suppose that the planets are not of in-terest, but this may be a misconception. More likely,information about planets is specialized knowledgethat is still useful to religious specialists such asshamans, but it is not commonly passed downamong the general populace. Modern folk tales in-volve planets, but the identities of specific planetshave been lost. This is seen in the case of the monkeycharacter who takes a similar role in a number oftales, but his planetary identity is given as Jupiter orMars, or even in one case as the Evening Star.STARS AND CONSTELLATIONSMaya accounts link stars to lights in the night. TheChortı ́ say ‘‘those [stars] which we do not see trav-eling are said to be fires, so that it does not becomecompletely dark on earth’’ (Fought 1972 : 428). ThePokomchı ́ say that the stars serve as aids to the trav-elers, for they light up the trail (Mayers 1958 : 42).To the Lacando ́ n, stars symbolize funerary candles;therefore, to dream of stars prophesies death (Bruce1979 : 149; McGee 1990 : 117). The Yucatec Maya ofYalcoba ́ say that a number of constellations have‘‘their fire,’’ representing a bright or large star thatdefines their arrangement in the night sky (Sosa1985 : 431).When referring generally to stars, the Tzotzil usethe term ‘‘the yellow ones’’ (k’analetik) and describethem as being located in a layer of the sky above theclouds but below the paths of the sun and the moon(Vogt and Vogt 1980 : 506). Their knowledge of ris-ing stars and constellations is derived from predawnobservations rather than the dusk observations com-mon in Western astronomy (that is, derived from theGreco-Roman tradition brought over from Europe)(Vogt 1997 : 114).Watching the stars is important in contemporaryMaya timekeeping. Among the Quiche ́ , differentconstellations take the role of ‘‘sign of the night’’as they move into a position opposite to the sunand become visible for the longest period of time(B. Tedlock 1985 : 84). During the dry season, thesign of the night in December is Orion.

Theyare said to rise at dawn on June 13, at the time theheavy rains begin (Redfield and Villa Rojas 1962 :206; Sosa 1985 : 431, 454). A similar name is re-corded among the Lacando ́ n and the Manche Chol(Bruce et al. 1971 : 15; Thompson 1974 : 93). TheQuiche ́ call both the Pleiades and the Hyades ‘‘hand-ful’’ (motsormotz); the Pleiades represent a handfulof maize kernels and the Hyades a handful of beans,and their setting corresponds to the time when theseplants are sown (Alvarado 1975 : 62; B. Tedlock 1985;1992b : 181). The Tzotzil of Zinacanta ́ n describe thePleiades aschak shonob,literally ‘‘high-backed cere-monial sandals’’ (Vogt 1997 : 112). A number ofTzotzil groups refer to the Pleiades as a sandal(sonom’;Ko ̈ hler 1991c:252), as do the Chol and theTzeltal.Few terms are recorded for the Little Dipper inUrsa Minor or its North Star (Polaris), the first starin the handle of the Little Dipper. Polaris is a largecelestial candle, according to the Tzotzil of Chamula(Sosa 1986 : 189). However, Polaris is apparently notrecognized among the Tzotzil of Zinacanta ́ n, andthey simply refer to it as one of many stars inan amorphous mass of stars called’epal k’analetik,meaning ‘‘many stars’’ (Vogt 1997 : 112 –113). Po-laris is the ‘‘corner star’’ to the Quiche ́ (B. Tedlock1985 : 86; 1992b : 181). The Lacando ́ n say that Polarisis ‘‘the north star’’ (xa ̈ma ̈n ek’) and the Little Dipperis ‘‘the crocodile’’ (el lagarto;Bruce et al. 1971 : 15).The Maya link the number seven with the BigDipper (in Ursa Major) because of its seven brightstars. This number does not seem to be a resultof European influence, but instead reflects a cleargrouping of seven stars. The Yucatec Maya call theBig Dipper the ‘‘seven sacraments,’’ and they warnthat counting them will result in the death of one’sspouse. The Tzotzil of Zinacanta ́ n recognize a turtleconstellation that includes stars in Ursa Major,Bootes, and Leo, calledvuku-pat,referring to thebent back of a turtle or a bent-over old man (Vogt1997 : 112).The Quiche ́ link the Big Dipper, or Ursa Major,to a bird whose name incorporates the numberseven, but the Big Dipper is also a cupped hand or aspoon (B. Tedlock 1983 : 65; 1992b : 181; D. Tedlockis associated with Gemini, late February with Regu-lus, mid-March with the Big Dipper, and early Aprilwith Acrux of the Southern Cross (B. Tedlock1992b : 182).Regulus in Leo is quite important in the Quiche ́agricultural calendar. If the field is to be newlyplanted, men go out and fell the trees, burn the un-dergrowth, and begin turning the soil in Februarywhen Regulus is the sign of the night (crossing themeridian at midnight). Sowing of the mountaincorn, which requires a longer season, begins inMarch, at the time when the waxing moon passesRegulus, then near its zenith (B. Tedlock 1985 : 85).The Quiche ́ visualize the classical constellationAquila (the eagle) as a hawk (xic;B. Tedlock 1985;1992b : 187 –189). They link the southward migra-tion of the Swainson’s hawk with the movements ofAquila. Near the onset of the dry season the hawksare seen in great flocks of more than two thousandbirds heading south to the pampas of Argentina. Inthe fall, Aquila drops the ‘‘dry-season cross’’ (Sagit-tarius) into the sea, reflecting the fact that Sagittariussets some two hours before Aquila. Near the begin-ning of the rainy season, the hawks migrate northover Momostenango en route to Canada, appearingjust around the time of the first thunderstorms. Atthis time, the hawks are said to lift the ‘‘wet-seasoncross’’ (Southern Cross) out of the sea.Maya people observe the Pleiades to regulate theiragricultural calendars. The Lacando ́ n burn the corn-fields in preparation for planting when the Pleiadeshave reached treetop level at dawn (Thompson 1974 :93). The Chortı ́ observe the Pleiades to predict theSun’s passage over zenith around planting time (Gi-rard 1949 : 453; 1962 : 78). Among the Quiche ́ , theplanting season for high-altitude maize is timedby observing the evening setting of the Pleiades inMarch, whereas planting of the low-altitude maize istimed by the conjunction of the Pleiades with theSun in May (D. Tedlock 1985 : 343). In a new field,they burn the undergrowth and turn the soil in Feb-ruary when the Pleiades reach the meridian shortlyafter sunset, and their conjunction with the Sun co-incides with the zenith passage of the Sun and theonset of the rains (B. Tedlock 1992b : 185, 189).In Yucata ́ n, the Pleiades (tzab) are the ‘‘rattle-38CONTEMPORARY MAYA IMAGES OF THE HEAVENS"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"1985 : 360). They watch for the rising and setting ofthe bowl of the Big Dipper. The descending positionof the Big Dipper is important in timing the hurri-cane season from June through October (D. Tedlock1991 : 169 –170).The scorpion constellation appears to have anumber of different astronomical identifications inthe ethnographic literature. Among the Tzotzil ofZinacanta ́ n, Scorpius istsek k’anal(scorpion con-stellation), and the brightest star, Antares, is the‘‘heart of the scorpion’’ (Vogt 1997 : 112 –113). InYucata ́ n and Quintana Roo, Scorpius is also a scor-pion constellation (Grube, cited in Love 1994 : 97;Redfield and Villa Rojas 1962 : 206). On the otherhand, John Sosa (1985 : 431) records an accountidentifying the Yucatec Maya termsina’an e ́ek(scor-pion star) as a large constellation composed of starsfrom Orion to Sirius. The scorpion (tzecandxok)isUrsa Major among the Tojolabal (Chaneabal) andKekchı ́ (Girard 1949 : 456; Thompson 1974 : 93).Lacando ́ n folklore mentions Orion, noting thename for a number of individual stars (Bruce et al.1971 : 15; Ra ̈tsch 1985 : 37 – 38). The peccary (puercode la montan ̃aorkitam) is linked with three brightstars in Orion. However, the configuration does notseem to include the first-magnitude stars, for Rigel isthe ‘‘little woodpecker’’ (tunsel), and Betelgeuse, ared star, is the ‘‘red dragonfly’’ (cha ̈k tulix). Threeother stars of lesser magnitude are the peccary’s pig-lets, probably positioned close to their mother. Siriusrepresents the ‘‘big woodpecker’’ (a ̈h ch’uhum), ap-parently the companion of the ‘‘little woodpecker’’nearby.Not surprisingly, Orion is commonly connectedwith the number three, because the three bright starsin Orion’s Belt are easily seen, even with the fullmoon nearby. The Tzeltal refer to Orion’s Belt as‘‘three king[s]’’ (oktu rey), and they say Orion isthe ‘‘cross star’’ (Slocum 1965b : 169). The Tzeltal‘‘three-star’’ (oxkot-ek) constellation may refer toOrion’s Belt (Villa Rojas 1990 : 746). The Chortı ́saythat the belt of Orion is formed by the ‘‘three Ma-rı ́as’’ joining with Orion’s sword to form the ‘‘sevenMarı ́as.’’ The Tzotzil of Zinacanta ́ n identify the threestars in Orion’s Belt (Delta, Epsilon, and Xi) as ‘‘thetrio,’’ or the ‘‘three Marı ́as,’’ whereas the sword isa ‘‘trio of robbers’’ or a ‘‘group of eavesdroppers’’(Laughlin 1975 : 70; 1980 : 139 n. 35). Vogt (1997 :112) records that Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka, thethree stars in the belt of Orion, are called’osh-lot(three together). Among the Quiche ́ , Orion is called‘‘dispersed fire,’’ and Orion’s Belt is the ‘‘tail of thethree fire lords,’’ serving as the sign of the night inDecember (B. Tedlock 1985 : 86; 1992b : 181; D. Ted-lock 1985 : 261). Alnitak in Orion’s Belt is alsogrouped with Rigel and Saiph to form a sort of celes-tial triangle in Orion called the ‘‘three hearthstones.’’Castor and Pollux in Gemini are ‘‘two stars thatgo together’’ to the Quiche ́ , who say that they are thesign for January when they rise at sunset (Remington1977 : 84). They are also the ‘‘two sparks’’ or ‘‘twoshiny ones’’ (B. Tedlock 1985 : 84; 1992b : 181, 189).They mark the northern horizon extreme of the Sunat the summer solstice, the time of the heaviest rains.Gemini is the ‘‘turtle’’ and the three stars lying ina straight line in the middle are its intestines, accord-ing to the Yucatec Maya of Chan Kom (Redfield andVilla Rojas 1962 : 206). The Lacando ́ n also identifyGemini as a turtle (Baer and Baer n.d.). However,Thompson (1960 : 111, 116) notes that one YucatecMaya account identifies the square of Orion as aturtle constellation calledac.Trees also represent constellations in the sky. Sosa(1985 : 432) records a Yucatec prayer that refers to agreatrobleor oak tree (ti noh be`ek) on the white road(sak beh) in the sky, probably referring to a constel-lation representing a tree on the Milky Way. The La-cando ́ n Maya identify the Southern Cross, at thesouthern end of the Milky Way, as a ceiba or corktree (Ochromoa lagopus;Bruce 1979 : 155).The distinctive crosslike form of the SouthernCross is expressed in a number of different names.The Yucatec of Quintana Roo say that it is the ‘‘crossstar,’’ the ‘‘cross which tops the tower of Jerusalem,’’or the ‘‘cross rising over Jerusalem’’ (Redfield andVilla Rojas 1962 : 206; Villa Rojas 1945 : 156). Amongthe Tzotzil of Chamula, the Southern Cross is the‘‘Jewish cross’’ associated with evil (Gossen 1974b :156 –158).The Chortı ́ call the Southern Cross the ‘‘cross ofMay.’’ They say that it signals the first solar zenith,the time for planting in May, when the intersectionSTARS AND CONSTELLATIONS39"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The souls are transformed into stars in heaven,according to a number of contemporary Maya ac-counts (Thompson 1960 : 85).

Perhaps the souls of the deadamong the Lacando ́ n ascend to heaven climbing thebranches of a stellar ceiba representing the SouthernCross.In sum, the seasonal positions of certain brightconstellations help to regulate the cycle of the sea-sons in star calendars evident among a number ofMaya communities. Names for the constellationsvary considerably from region to region, but thereseem to be some groupings of stars that bear namesimplying similar concepts, such as the SouthernCross being recognized as either a sacred tree or across constellation. Maya people often see the starsas fires in the night, and frequently they link con-stellations to animals. They also recognize individualstars as animals.THE MILKY WAYSome Maya people see a snake in the band of starsacross the sky that we know as the Milky Way. TheYucatec Maya identify the Milky Way as the deadlyfer-de-lance,tamacaz(Coe 1975 : 27). The Chortı ́saythat the Milky Way is a white serpent with its mouthto the south and its tail to the north (Girard 1948 :76; 1949 : 458, 461). They seem to visualize the MilkyWay as a path or axis intersecting with the ecliptic,the path of the Sun. Raphael Girard (1948 : 75) alsoidentifies the Milky Way with a cord, because he sayscords and serpents are connected among the Maya,although this is apparently an interpretation on hispart rather than a Chortı ́ account of the Milky Way.The notion of the Milky Way as a road is quitewidespread. Tzotzil terms to describe the Milky Wayinclude ‘‘road of ice,’’ ‘‘road of water or rain,’’ and‘‘mother of water or rain’’ (Ko ̈ hler 1991c : 253). The‘‘road of water’’ refers to the Milky Way in the sum-mer rainy season, whereas the ‘‘road of frost’’ is itsname during the dry season. The section of theof the Milky Way and the ecliptic, a cosmic cross-roads in the sky, is positioned overhead (Girard1949 : 456 – 459). The feast of the Day of the Cross(May 3) may be linked to the Southern Cross cross-ing the meridian in the southern sky on the eveningof the festival (between 9 and 11p.m.).The Southern Cross, not seen in latitudes north ofMesoamerica, is visible just prior to the onset of therains, which may be one reason it is so important tothe contemporary Maya. Evon Vogt’s (1997 : 112 –113) recent research at Zinacanta ́ n indicates that theSouthern Cross iskrus k’anal(cross stars). Theycompare this cross to Christ’s cross and they identifytwo star crosses on either side as ‘‘thieves’ crosses,’’constituting the three crosses of Calvary. One ofthese is made up of stars in Lupus, and the otherincludes stars in Vela and Carina, apparently thecounterpart for a star grouping known as the ‘‘falsecross’’ in Western astronomy, frequently mistakenfor the Southern Cross.Judith Remington (1977 : 85 – 87) found evidencefor three ‘‘thieves’ crosses’’ among the Quiche ́ in thedepartment of Quetzaltenango and among the Cak-chiquel in the department of Guatemala. One is theSouthern Cross, and the second is a cross in Sagit-tarius with delta at its center. Remington was un-certain about the identification of the third cross.Except for the Southern Cross, the three crosses inthis system seem to be different from the three starcrosses recorded by Vogt (1997) at Zinacanta ́n.The Southern Cross is one of two Quiche ́ con-stellations identified with the name ‘‘thieves’ cross’’(B. Tedlock 1985 : 83; 1992a : 29, 38 n. 2). The Quiche ́refer to the Southern Cross, visible primarily duringthe rainy season, as the ‘‘rainy-season thieves’ cross.’’The ‘‘dry-season thieves’ cross’’ is a seven-star aster-ism in Sagittarius, with delta at its center. This is abent cross that the Maya relate to a stalk with bentmaize ears, signaling the maize is ready to harvest.Sagittarius may be a portal to the underworld, be-cause it is located in the rift section of the Milky Way(xibalba be) that the Quiche ́ identify as an under-world road, where the Sun crosses the Milky Wayat the winter solstice, which is the longest night ofthe year.40CONTEMPORARY MAYA IMAGES OF THE HEAVENS"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Milky Way with Scorpius is associated with dryness,probably because the Tzotzil usually observe stars inthe predawn hours, and Scorpius is seen to reappearon the eastern horizon at dawn in December.

Tedlock 1985 : 65). The other Quiche ́Maya name for this side of the Milky Way is the‘‘underworld road’’ (xibalba be), running from thevicinity of Sagittarius and Scorpius as far north asthe Northern Cross (Cygnus), where the rift closes.The opposite side is the ‘‘white road’’ (saki be;B. Ted-lock 1985 : 84; 1992a : 29). The Yucatec Maya of ChanKom also call the Milky Way ‘‘white road,’’ the samename given to ancient roads. Other Yucatec namesfor the Milky Way include ‘‘the road of the small liz-ard’’ and ‘‘the small path in the forest.’’ Among theCakchiquel, the Milky Way is the ‘‘road of the seaturtle’’ (a Pacific loggerhead turtle or Atlantic greenturtle; Weldon Lamb, personal communication 1997).The Lacando ́ n say that the Milky Way is the‘‘white way of our true lord,’’ Hacha ̈kyum, who isthe lord of the heaven where the Lacando ́ n go whenthey die (Duby and Blom 1969 : 295; Ra ̈tsch 1985 :37). This implies that the Lacando ́ n go to the MilkyWay when they die. A similar link with the realm ofthe dead is clear in the Quiche ́ name for the rift sec-tion of the Milky Way,xibalba be,an underworldroad. The Yucatec Maya say that the dead travelalong the Milky Way at night (Sosa 1985 : 432). TheDay of the Dead, celebrated in early November, iswidely recognized as a time when the dead can re-turn to earth. The Milky Way is especially prominentat this time of year when it arches over the sky fromeast to west at dusk.The Chortı ́ also refer to the Milky Way as theRoad of Santiago, their god of thunder and light-ning, and they predict rainfall by watching the MilkyWay and the Moon. The position of the Milky Wayon the Dı ́a de Santiago (July 25) is a sign that therains will temporarily abate during canicula, allow-ing the fields to be prepared for the second planting.Among the Quiche ́ , the planting of valley maize atthe time of the Feast of the Holy Cross (Day of theCross) is heralded by the reappearance in May of thedark rift of the Milky Way in the ‘‘underworld road’’(B. Tedlock 1992b : 181, 189).A relationship between the Milky Way and theMoon is expressed in a number of ways. The Quiche ́are particularly interested in the seasonal variationsin the Moon’s path, noting when the Moon passesthrough the rift of the Milky Way and predictingrainfall accordingly (B. Tedlock 1983 : 66 – 67; 1992b :191). A tale of ill-fated lovers collected among theKekchı ́ of Guatemala closely links the Moon and theMilky Way. The Sun tries to steal the Moon from herold father, covering her with a turtle shell, but theold man hits the Sun with a pellet from his blowgun,and the Sun drops the lunar maiden. She smashes topieces in the sea. Small fish gather the pieces andpatch them with their silvery scales; they form a netand lift the Moon into the sky. The fish remain be-hind and become the Milky Way (Thompson 1967 :33; 1970b : 365). The Kekchı ́ tale explains why theMoon disappears (the Sun drops it) during conjunc-tion, and how the Moon rises up again (with thehelp of ocean creatures). The Milky Way as a netmade to lift up the Moon may be represented by thenetted skirt of the Moon Goddess in PrecolumbianMaya imagery (Chapter 4).The Milky Way, with its dense band of stars, mostoften suggests a path across the sky or the more ani-mate form of a celestial serpent. The stars of theMilky Way are watched to predict seasonal change,and the Moon’s position crossing the Milky Wayseems to be of interest. Some Maya groups connectthe Milky Way to the dead. The Milky Way itself mayembody the road of the dead, and its countless starsmay represent the souls of the dead.OTHER CELESTIAL PHENOMENAComets are called ‘‘tail of the star’’ and are consid-ered omens of pestilence among the Quiche ́ (B. Ted-lock 1992b : 180). They are ‘‘windy tail’’ and ‘‘fire –ill-omened star’’ in Colonial Yucatec sources citedby Barbara Tedlock. Among the Tzotzil, cometsare calledyol,which can mean ‘‘arrow,’’ ‘‘bow,’’ orOTHER CELESTIAL PHENOMENA41"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"scribe five different Chacs — marking the four direc-tions and the center —who ride across the sky withtheir leader,kunku-chac,the great rain god, underorders from St. Michael. The rain aspect of Chac isseen also in Mopan legends, where he is said to bethe thunder god (Thompson 1930 : 128).The Yucatec Maya say that the rainbow (chel)isthe flatulence of the demons, rising out of dry wellsrepresenting the anus of a demon called Metal (Red-field and Villa Rojas 1962 : 206). An evil rainbowrises from thexab(sinkhole or well), where an evil,snakelike monster resides in its depths, according tothe Tzotzil of Chenalho ́ ; the snake is a companionof the rainbow because both are striped, and there isa serpent under every rainbow (Guiteras Holmes1961 : 203, 235, 288). Rainbows bring an end to rain,according to Maya accounts. The Chortı ́ identify therainbow as the body of a Chicchan serpent stretchedacross the sky. Even though the Chicchan serpent ofthe north brings rain, the rainbow aspect of theChicchan does not let the rain fall (Fought 1972 :388; Wisdom 1940 : 392 – 395). Similarly, the Tzotzilsay that rainbows across the sky signify the end ofrain (Laughlin, personal communication 1995).In sum, it seems that temporary sky phenomena,such as comets, meteor showers, storms, winds, andrainbows, are usually considered malevolent, mostprobably because of their unpredictable nature. TheMaya still believe rainbows have a demonic quality.Contrary to the Western tradition, rainbows are con-sidered unlucky, probably because they are believedto hold back the life-giving rain. Meteors are associ-ated with war and obsidian. Comets seem to be dis-tinguished from meteors, especially in accounts thatdescribe their long tails.CONTEMPORARY MAYA ASTRONOMYIN CULTURAL CONTEXTThere is diversity in modern Maya beliefs about as-tronomy, but there is also an underlying unity thatcan be detected when studying linguistically relatedgroups, most notable when comparing the Lacando ́nand Yucatec Maya astronomical terms. A belief inthe layered cosmos is widespread, but sometimes thelayers seem more like steps along the sun’s daily‘‘crossbow’’ (Lamb n.d.b). A different image is pre-sented by the Tzotzil of Chalchihuita ́ n, who say thatthe comet is a ‘‘starbeam’’ (Ko ̈ hler 1991a : 319). Hal-ley’s comet, which was particularly bright in the earlypart of this century, is mentioned in a number ofMaya accounts (Ko ̈ hler 1989 : 292). It may be thecomet with a ‘‘long tail’’ in one Yucatec account(Burns 1983 : 89).The Maya watch for shooting stars, the annualfireballs in meteor showers. The Tzotzil describe afalling star as a ‘‘torch’’ (ch’ob;Lamb n.d.b; Laughlin1975 : 137). Shooting stars seen in the east are thecigarette butts of the Chacs among the Yucatec Mayaof Quintana Roo (Villa Rojas 1945 : 102). Such im-ages seem related to cigars smoked by the HeroTwins in the Popol Vuh, according to Barbara Ted-lock (1992b : 180 –181). However, she sees a strongermythic tradition in the association of meteors withobsidian. She suggests that the link between meteors,obsidian, war, death, and human sacrifice relates topast use of obsidian in implements of warfare, sac-rifice, and bloodletting. The Lacando ́ n name formeteors is ‘‘arrowheads,’’ and the Yucatec name is‘‘arrow stars.’’ A Colonial Quiche ́ term for meteorsis the ‘‘star that makes war.’’ Obsidian points andblades found by the Quiche ́ in the fields of Momos-tenango are said to be the remains of falling stars(B. Tedlock 1992b : 180 –181). The Tzotzil also de-scribe obsidian as excrement that drops from shoot-ing stars as they fall (Laughlin 1975 : 93). More com-monly, the Maya describe meteors themselves as starexcrement (Ko ̈ hler 1989 : 295 – 296; Trenary 1987 –1988, table l).Like many other Maya groups, the Tzotzil of Zi-nacanta ́ n believe that shooting stars have a malevo-lent quality. The soul of an evil person may take theform of a falling star. A falling star seen at duskmakes the leg swell; however, when seen after mid-night, a falling star marks the place where treasure ishidden (Laughlin 1975 : 232, 284, 513).Mention should be made of the many sky beingsassociated with changing winds and weather. The Yu-catec Maya believe that rain deities riding on horse-back pour water from an inexhaustible calabash. Therain gods reside behind a door in the eastern sky, andthey come to earth in the cenotes.

Other images of the layered cosmos assignthe sun to a specific layer, often separate from thefixed stars. Watching the moon when planting andharvesting seems to be widespread, although the lu-nar phases for agricultural activities differ amongvarious Maya groups. Assigning a masculine genderto the sun and a feminine gender to the moon seemsto be the norm, but the moon may be transformedinto a male in order to take a role as a farmer in someaccounts, especially when the moon is visualized asa sibling of the sun. A female sun and a male moonare variations in the pattern evident among the Chol,who occupy a region at the core of the area of theClassic Maya civilization.The planet Venus has somewhat malevolent ornegative associations in a number of Maya cultures,as indicated by beliefs that the Venus deity is ugly,lazy, or adulterous. Venus is often the master of theanimals, and some accounts imply that the planetcauses eclipses. Information on the other planets isvery scarce, but some folktales speak of a monkeyplanet named as the younger brother of Venus andthe Sun. Mars and Jupiter seem to be the only otherplanets that have been documented in ethnographicaccounts.Constellation names preserved in a number ofcommunities indicate that the principal constella-tions are often the star groups that are most easilyseen in the sky and those that mark important sea-sonal transitions. The Milky Way is widely connectedto a serpent or to a road or a path, sometimes specifi-cally linked with the realm of the dead.The weather phenomena are sometimes personi-fied, and the beings responsible for these temporaryevents seem to interact or even overlap with astro-nomical deities. Thus in one account, the MoonGoddess is one of the Chacs, the deities responsiblefor rainfall and thunder. Rainbows issue from wellsthat are also the home of the Moon Goddess duringconjunction. And the Venus serpent may overlap insome way with the Chicchan serpents responsible forrain and rainbows.CONTEMPORARY MAYA ASTRONOMY IN CULTURAL CONTEXT43"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"2NAKED-EYE ASTRONOMYThe motions of the heavens can be mystifying to those not trained in astronomy. Tounderstand Precolumbian astronomical imagery, we have to see the heavens fromthe perspective of naked-eye astronomy, quite unlike the view through a telescope.Here I describe the events from a dual perspective, both what you see from Earthand what actually happens in the sky in a Sun-centered solar system. A glossary atthe end of the book will be helpful to those unfamiliar with astronomical terms.Aveni’sSkywatchers of Ancient Mexicois an invaluable companion text to this chap-ter, as are H. A. Rey’sThe Stars: A New Way to See Themand E. C. Krupp’sEchoes ofthe Ancient Skies: The Astronomy of Lost Civilizations.TRACKING THE SOLAR SEASONSFrom a geocentric perspective, the sun seems to be moving eastward through thebackground of stars over the course of the seasons. It takes a full year for the sun to‘‘return’’ to the same stars along its annual path, known as the ecliptic. The earth’smovement in its orbit around the sun makes the sun seem to move, and the earthspinning on its axis creates night and day.The true length of the solar year is 365.2422 days; but our solar calendar approxi-mates the solar year by using a period of 365 days with a day added every four years.Watching the sun over the course of several years from a fixed location, one can seethe sun on the horizon at the same spot at the same time of year (Fig. 2.1a). Thisposition can be noted in relation to a mountain or building in the distance, as in thediagram.North of the equator, the sun reaches its northern extreme on the horizon at thesummer solstice in June and the southern extreme at the winter solstice in December(see glossary). At the two solstices, the sun seems to stop moving along the horizon,just prior to turning in the opposite direction in its annual cycle (Fig. 2.1a). InFIG. 2.1.a:Daily motion of Sun over course of year from June 21 (summer solstice) toDecember 22 (winter solstice), with Z marking true zenith in tropics of Mesoamerica andobserver at low northern latitude (after drawing by P.

In fact, the tropic ofCancer marks the northern limit of Mesoamerica atthe archaeological site of Alta Vista (Aveni 1980 :226 – 229). A shared 260-day calendar, one of thedefining characteristics of Mesoamerica, may relateto the specific geographical location of Mesoamerica.Agricultural and weather patterns tied to the lati-tude of the northern Tropics probably influencedthe early development of the 260-day calendar stillused to measure the length of the agricultural seasonin Mesoamerica.Clearly the solar zenith plays a central role in uni-fying Mesoamerica, for this culture area does not ex-tend north of where the sun achieves a true zenith.The zenith position of the sun can be determined bywatching for the day when the sun casts no shadowat noon. The shortening length of the shadow atnoon could be used to predict the zenith date. Withtheir structured calendar and long-distance traderoutes, the ancient Maya were certainly aware thatthe date the sun reached its zenith varied as theytraveled north and south. Indeed, architectural com-plexes show orientations that are keyed to the localhorizon position of the sun on the zenith date(Chapter 3).The first solar zenith occurs near the onset of therainy season throughout much of Mesoamerica. Incentral Mexico and the northern Maya area of Yu-cata ́ n, from 197Nto217N latitude, the solar zenithdate falls near the end of May, coinciding closelywith the onset of the rains (Pl. 1). The seasonalpattern is quite extreme in Yucata ́ n, with rainfallclustering in the period from late May through No-vember, dividing the year into two distinct seasons(Pe ́ rez 1945 : 89). The first solar zenith in the centralPete ́ n, on May 8 around 177N latitude, announcesthe coming rains. Rainfall in the Pete ́ n follows asimilar pattern to that of Yucata ́ n, with peak rain-fall from June through October and a slight abate-ment during August (Aveni and Hotaling 1996 : 362,fig. 1). Rainfall is exceptionally low from Decemberthrough April, and it is relatively dry through May,creating a six-month dry season like that of Yucata ́n.Rainfall patterns are more variable in Belize, butgenerally the entire Maya area experiences a ratherlong dry season.northern latitudes, the winter solstice occurs aroundDecember 22, when the sun is 231⁄27south of theequator on the longest night of the year, and thesummer solstice occurs around June 21, when thesun is 231⁄27north of the equator on the longest dayof the year. The intervals between the solstices weremore even in the fifteenth century (at about 182days) than they are today (181.77 and 183.47 days),and the midpoint between the solstices was offsetfrom the time of the true equinox by only 2.1 days(Dearborn and White 1989 : 468). The tilt of theearth’s axis at 231⁄27is what accounts for the way thesun seems to travel north and south from one hori-zon extreme to another. These horizon extremes aremarked by the tropic of Cancer at the latitude of231⁄27N and the tropic of Capricorn in the south at231⁄27S, the latitudes that delimit the tropical zoneson earth.The two annual equinoxes (around September 20and March 21) take place approximately midway be-tween the solstices, when the viewer on earth sees thesun rise due east and set due west, and the days andnights are of equal length. As will be seen in Chap-ter 3, the Maya built structures oriented toward thehorizon positions of the sun at the equinoxes andsolstices, confirming a relationship between archi-tecture and solar observations. The equinox orien-tations translate into azimuths of 907for sunrise and2707for sunset; you can approximate the solstice ori-entations by adding 231⁄27to the equinox azimuthsfor the summer solstice, and subtracting the samefigure for the winter solstice. Anthony Aveni (1980,table 9) gives the precise azimuths based on differenthorizon elevations at the latitude of the northern ex-treme of the Maya area.In the Tropics, the sun reaches a true overheadposition at noon on the day of the solar zenith(Fig. 2.1a). Within tropical Mesoamerica, the sun isin the northern sky at noon on the summer solsticeand reaches a zenith position twice a year on eitherside of the summer solstice. At the southern limit ofMesoamerica, at about 147N latitude, the solar zen-iths occur in late April and mid-August. At the tropicof Cancer, there is only one solar zenith, which takesplace on the summer solstice. When the observer isnorth of the tropic of Cancer, the noon sun always46NAKED-EYE ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Just as the first solar zenith is important because itcoincides approximately with the onset of the rainyseason in Mesoamerica, a complementary eventknown as the second solar nadir coincides with thebeginning of the dry season (Pl. 1). For example, atthe latitude of Chiche ́ n Itza ́ (207418) the sun reachesits solar nadir on November 22 and on January 21in the Gregorian (N.S.) calendar. Further south, at187N latitude, the second solar nadir falls on January30 N.S. As noted in Chapter 1, the contemporaryQuiche ́ Maya determine the date of the nadir bywatching the full moon pass overhead at midnight.LUNAR POSITIONS AND PHASESDuring the twenty-nine to thirty days of the synodiclunar month (29.53059 days), the moon changesphases because it changes position relative to theearth. The moon passes in front of the sun duringthe new moon, a period of conjunction that lastsfrom two to three days (Aveni 1980 : 69). As themoon pulls away from the sun, you begin to see asliver of the moon, known as the first crescent. Thefirst visible crescent appears just above the westernhorizon at dusk, and it sets almost immediatelythereafter. As the month progresses, the waxingmoon is visible higher in the sky each night at dusk,and it is seen for a longer time before setting. At thefirst quarter, half of the moon can be seen overheadat dusk, and the moon sets some three hours later.Over the next days, the moon grows rounder duringits gibbous stage and appears further to the eastwhen viewed at dusk. This is because the sun illu-minates more and more of the moon as it moves far-ther away from the sun. Around the fifteenth day ofthe lunar month, the moon rises opposite to the set-ting sun, and thus it reaches the full moon phase.During the night, the full moon moves across the skyuntil it sets at dawn, still in opposition to the sun.Over the next seven days, the moon is again in itsgibbous stage, but now it is seen in the predawn sky.By the waning quarter, the moon is overhead atdawn. A few days later, the waning crescent moon isvisible in the eastern sky in the early morning, eachnight closer to the eastern horizon, until it finallyrises just before sunrise. On the next day, the moondisappears in the sun’s glare at the time of conjunc-tion (the new moon), but because it drops down tothe eastern horizon, it seems as if it disappears intothe earth as it moves between the earth and the sun(Fig. 2.1b).The most profound effect of the lunar phases onearth is seen in the tides, which bear a direct relation-ship to the moon. The moon seems to carry the tideswith it. When viewed over the course of the month,the moon seems to rise fifty minutes later each night,thus the high and low tides are almost an hour latereach day. The moon’s path or orbit also profoundlyinfluences the tides. The moon’s orbit around theearth is elliptical, and it moves closest to the earth(perigee) every 27.55 days. When the moon is atperigee at the time of the new moon, the lowest tidesof the year occur, and perigee at the full moon bringsthe highest tides; gravitational pull is strongest atthese times (Cleere 1994 : 96).Whereas the sun is relatively easy to track, servingas a model of orderly motion that defines the dayand solar year, the moon has much more complexcycles because twelve lunar months do not fit exactlyinto the solar year (12329.530595354.36708).The difference each year accumulates at a rate ofabout eleven days a year, resulting in the need to addan extra lunar month at certain intervals in any sea-sonal calendar that includes lunar observations. Theactual interval that it takes the full moon to return tothe same date in the calendar year is the metonic cy-cle of nineteen years, a cycle of 235 lunations or6,939.6 days that seems to be recorded in at least oneMaya codex (Chapter 4).The disappearance interval during conjunctionvaries from two to three days, with the shortest dis-appearance interval occurring in the spring. There isalso seasonal variation in the altitude of the moonon first visibility and in the orientation of the cres-cent when the moon first emerges from invisibility(MacPherson 1987; Ottewell 1990). The crescentmoon appears to be tipped over during the rainy-season months in Mesoamerica and lies horizontallyduring the dry-season months, positions noted bythe modern Maya (Chapter 1).Because the full moon rises opposite to the settingsun, it has a seasonal position opposite to the sun.LUNAR POSITIONS AND PHASES47"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"the ecliptic. Every 18.61 years the nodes return to thesame position. This is also the interval between ma-jor standstills of the moon, when you will see themoon reach its maximum northern and southernpositions during a month, and it will repeat theseapproximate positions over several months (Aveni1997 : 33, 88; Krupp 1991 : 156).ECLIPSESIf the moon is full when it crosses a node, there maybe a lunar eclipse, but if it crosses during the newmoon, a solar eclipse may occur (Aveni 1980 : 77 –78). Since the moon continually wanders north andsouth, the node crossings rarely occur at the timeof a full moon or new moon. Solar eclipses occurwithin eighteen days of a node passage, whereas lu-nar eclipses occur within twelve days of a node pas-sage (V. Bricker and H. Bricker 1989 : 239). Lunareclipses are spaced at least six months apart, and notevery year has a lunar eclipse; on the other hand,there are at least two solar eclipses a year, and some-times as many as five (Ortiz 1997 : 22). Even thoughsolar eclipses are more common, lunar eclipses aremore often seen because they are visible over thehalf of the earth turned toward the moon, whereassolar eclipses are seen only in a narrow band wherethe new moon’s shadow falls on earth as the moonpasses between the earth and the sun.John Teeple (1930 : 90) provides a good descrip-tion of solar eclipses:The sun has its path in the sky which we call the eclip-tic; the moon also has a path which is inclined about57to the ecliptic, hence twice a year the sun is in boththe ecliptic and the moon’s path where they cross, at apoint which we may call the node. If a new moon oc-curs while the sun is at that point, or in fact withinabout 18 days either side of the node, then the moonwill obscure some part of the sun and there will be aneclipse of the sun visible somewhere on earth. If thenodes were stationary, the sun would reach one everyFor example, in the Quiche ́ area, the full moon’sposition at midnight zenith coincides with the timeof the sun’s nadir in November, just as the midnightzenith of the full moon in February marks the timeof the second solar nadir (B. Tedlock 1992b : 189).The moon at the fall equinox rises at approximatelythe same position as the sun at the spring equi-nox. The full moon at the winter solstice rises at duskin approximately the same position as the rising sunon the summer solstice; similarly, the full moon onthe summer solstice rises at dusk in the position ofthe winter-solstice sunrise.The moon completes a circuit of the sky in onesidereal month (27.32166 days; Aveni 1980 : 69 –72).Over the course of a sidereal month, the moonmoves rapidly, advancing around thirteen degrees intwenty-four hours, so that it appears to jump for-ward each night (Fig. 2.2a). The moon passing by anindividual star or star group marks the sidereal po-sition of the moon. The full moon, which is about1⁄27in diameter, on some occasions actually coversstars or even clusters of stars; indeed its diameter isjust large enough to cover the Pleiades. Such an oc-cultation places the moon in a precise sidereal posi-tion and also marks an exact position along themoon’s inclined orbit.The moon’s orbit is tipped by about 57with re-spect to the ecliptic, so that it moves back and forthacross this plane (Fig. 2.1b). The two points of inter-section with the ecliptic are called the nodes. Whenthe new or full moon crosses a node, the moon, theearth, and the sun lie on a straight line. The moonpasses through a node (crosses the ecliptic) every13.7 days. From a geocentric perspective, the nodecrossings represent the moon moving north andsouth of the sun’s ecliptical path.Each month the moon mimics the annual cycle ofthe sun, rising at northern and southern extremes onthe horizon, but the inclined lunar orbit changes thelocation of the moon relative to the ecliptic. Conse-quently, the nodes change position (regress) along48NAKED-EYE ASTRONOMYFIG. 2.2.a:Moon moves 3607around sky, crossing backand forth across ecliptic over course of one month; herecrossing points (lunar nodes) occur on days 7 and 21.b:Selected positions of Venus in relation to Earth andSun (after Closs 1979, fig. 4)."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"ECLIPSES49"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"THE PLANETSLike the moon, planets are lit by reflection, distin-guishing them from stars, which are actually distantsuns in other solar systems. Planets are generallybrighter than the stars and give off a steady light,whereas stars seem to twinkle. Mercury, however,can fool the eye and sometimes twinkles like a starwhen it is near the horizon. The stars represent afixed background in the sky, like a geographic map.Although this stellar map slowly rotates, the stars re-main in the same relationships, serving as signpostsfor the motion of the planets, called the ‘‘wanderers’’in classical antiquity (Aveni 1992b : 25 – 26).Just as the earth’s year is based on the time it takesto orbit around the sun, the sidereal cycle of a planetrepresents the time it takes to orbit around the sun,passing entirely around the background of stars.From a geocentric perspective, another cycle seemsmore pronounced, that of the synodic period — thetime it takes for the planet to return to the same po-sition relative to the earth and the sun. The synodicperiod has certain subsets, the most notable of whichare the period of retrograde, the day of opposition,and the day of heliacal rise at dawn (see glossary).The heliacal rise date, the day when the planet be-comes visible again after being lost in the sun’s glareduring conjunction, is clearly the most striking andnotable event in the synodic period. Predicting theheliacal rise and set dates requires considerable ex-pertise. Calculating the timing of this event is notsimply a matter of determining the degree of sepa-ration between the sun and the planet in terms ofcelestial longitude, because the degree of separationrequired for first visibility varies with the seasons(V. Bricker and H. Bricker 1986b : 60). Furthermore,although modern computer programs have made iteasier to determine when these events occurred inthe past, these programs do not precisely re-create apast event because they cannot account for localweather conditions that could change the date theplanet first became visible.Astronomers call Venus and Mercury inferiorplanets because their orbits are closer to the Sunthan that of Earth. They have the inside track, so tohalf year, but there is a regression of the nodes, suchthat the sun crosses the moon’s orbit on the average ofonce in 173.31 days, the eclipse half year.Solar eclipses are only visible within a limitedgeographic range, especially total eclipses. There arethree types of solar eclipses: (1) Apartialsolar eclipseoccurs when the moon covers only part of the sunbecause the new moon is not exactly at the node butis sufficiently close that it hides part of the sun (Rey1976 : 138). (2) Atotaleclipse occurs when the newmoon is crossing a node and it is also close to theearth because of its position in the elliptical orbit, sothat the moon’s backlit disk appears large enough tocompletely cover the sun, leaving only a circle of raysaround the dark lunar disk. (3) Anannulareclipseoccurs if the new moon moves directly in front ofthe sun when it is more distant from the earth, so itdoes not completely cover the sun but leaves a ringof light all the way around the new moon.Lunar eclipses can be seen in a wide geographicarea; all that is required is that the eclipse occursometime between dusk and dawn in the locale.During a lunar eclipse, the moon undergoes a dra-matic transformation but does not disappear com-pletely. As the eclipse proceeds over the course ofseveral hours, the appearance of the moon trans-forms from the full moon to a crescent moon as theearth’s shadow falls on the moon, until it is com-pletely covered by a shadow that makes it look like adisk that is colored coppery red or a darker shade. Itretains this color for up to an hour and forty-fiveminutes as the earth passes directly between the sunand the moon, preventing sunlight from illuminat-ing the moon’s surface. Then the phases repeat inreverse order, with the crescent emerging again, fol-lowed by the moon gradually filling out until it re-sumes its appearance as the silvery full moon. If onlypart of the moon passes through the earth’s shadow,you see a partial lunar eclipse. The rounded shadowof the earth falling on the moon at the time of a lu-nar eclipse was what led Aristotle to recognize thespherical shape of the earth. A similar discoveryeluded the Maya, and even today they describe therounded shadow as a bite taken out of the moon byan eclipse monster.50NAKED-EYE ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"speak. They appear to be attached to the Sun, neverseeming to stray far from the Sun’s position. Aveni(1992b : 27) points out that Mercury is never seenmore than two handspans from the Sun, and Venusno more than four. They have a unique relationshipwith the viewer on Earth, seeming to swing back andforth, almost like a yo-yo moving toward and awayfrom the Sun. This means that their position abovethe horizon is closely linked to the horizon positionof the Sun (Aveni 1979, fig. 1).Because the orbital plane of each planet is tippedslightly with respect to Earth’s orbit, the planets seemto migrate north and south of the Sun’s position.This motion is most noticeable with Mercury andVenus because they have the largest orbital inclina-tion, 77and 37248respectively (Aveni 1980 : 92 – 93).Among the celestial wanderers, Mercury strays far-thest from the Sun’s path, rising and setting up to77north and south of the Sun’s extreme horizonpositions.Venus and Mercury appear as celestial twins or‘‘body doubles’’ because they have a similar patternof visibility. They can only be seen in the east arounddawn or in the west around dusk. This gives them adouble personality. The two inferior planets are alsosimilar because they are the only planets that havefour-part synodic periods: a Morning Star phase; aphase of invisibility around superior conjunction;an Evening Star phase; and an inferior conjunctionphase. When Venus and Mercury pass in front of theSun around the time of inferior conjunction, theirdisappearance is relatively short. When they pass be-hind the Sun at the time of superior conjunction, theperiod of invisibility is much longer. This is becausethe viewing angle from Earth creates a wider arc ofinvisibility as the planet moves to the opposite sideof the Sun (positions 5 –7 in Fig. 2.2b).Mercury’s synodic period (115.9 days) is punctu-ated by periods of invisibility around inferior andsuperior conjunction, averaging five and thirty-fivedays respectively. As the planet closest to the Sun,Mercury is invisible for almost a third of its totalsynodic period. Whereas Venus reaches a maximumelongation (angular distance) from the Sun of 477,Mercury has a maximum elongation from the Sunof no more than 267, meaning that Mercury staysrelatively close to the Sun, making it very difficultto track (Aveni 1980 : 85, 325 n. 14). Many ancientpeople in the Old World applied the term ‘‘burner’’or ‘‘sparkler’’ to Mercury, because it seems to twinklenear the horizon (Aveni 1992b : 53). Aveni reportsthat Mercury was characterized as a trickster, be-cause it would elude anyone in pursuit by disappear-ing so frequently. For similar reasons, the Greekssaid Mercury was a swift-footed messenger (Her-mes) who conducted souls of the dead into the un-derworld (Krupp 1991 : 174). Mercury’s speedy na-ture is no doubt due to its short sidereal cycle, for ittakes only eighty-eight days to make a circuit aroundthe sky.The four-part synodic period of Venus averages583.92 days, including two periods of invisibility thataverage 8 and 50 days. In practice, the disappearanceintervals vary in length according to the season. Theinferior conjunction interval for Venus can rangefrom a few days around February to as many as20 days in August (Aveni 1991 : 314, fig. 4; 1992b : 97,table 3.2).It is possible to see Venus move through all theconstellations of the zodiac during its period of visi-bility in the morning or evening sky. This is becauseits average period as either Morning or Evening Staris 263 days, whereas the sidereal cycle of Venus isshorter, just under 225 days. The sidereal cycle maybe important in the eight-year Venus cycle docu-mented in the Dresden Codex (Chapter 5).Venus returns to the same position in the sky atthe same time of year in the same phase every eightyears. This means that it returns to the same stargroup at the same time of year. Five synodic periodsof Venus are approximately equal to eight solar yearsand ninety-nine lunar months, theoctaeteriscycle(meaning eightfold) used by the Greeks (Aveni1992b : 95). The length of the five Venus synodic pe-riods also follows a symmetrical sequence in termsof the number of days in each cycle: 587, 583, 580,583, and 587 days, repeating at intervals of eightyears. Similarly, the disappearance intervals follow aseasonal patterning over the eight-year period (Aveniand Hotaling 1994 : S25).THE PLANETS51"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"bright but not easily seen because it is so close to theSun and only a thin crescent is illuminated (thisshape, however, can only be seen with a telescope).Just a few weeks before it disappears as Evening Starand just a few weeks after it reappears as MorningStar more of the planet is illuminated, making itmost brilliant (Fig. 2.3a; Aveni 1991 : 310; 1992b : 32).Venus is the brightest of the planets, occasionallyeven visible in daylight. And in some rare instances,Venus can be seen to pass in front of the Sun duringinferior conjunction. At this time, Venus is seen as ablack dot moving across the face of the Sun, almostlike a sunspot (Aveni 1980 : 85). As yet, we have noevidence that these transits of Venus were observedby the ancient Maya, but the subject has not beenadequately explored.Venus has a retrograde period that averages forty-two days, beginning just prior to inferior conjunc-tion (Roth 1970 :104 –105). Its retrograde motion isdifferent from that of the superior planets (thoseplanets that orbit the Sun beyond Earth’s orbit) be-cause it is less obvious, for the midpoint of its ret-rograde period coincides with inferior conjunctionwhen the planet is not visible. This motion does notseem to be of great interest in Classic Maya texts.The superior planets show a different pattern ofmotion than the inferior planets; they are not oftenseen close to the sun, and when in opposition to thesun, they behave like the full moon, rising at duskand setting at dawn. Their synodic periods involvelong periods of visibility in the night sky, punctuatedby a single period of invisibility during conjunction.In a single synodic period, a superior planet movesacross the sky in a predictable fashion, making asingle disappearance just after it reaches the westernhorizon at dusk. A superior planet rises earlier andearlier each day in the predawn sky, working its wayacross the sky until it again reaches the western ho-rizon at dusk (Aveni 1992b : 26 – 30, fig. 2.3).The planets follow an eastward motion amid thebackground of the stars, like the sun and the moon.From time to time, as the earth passes by a planet,Just as the horizon positions of Venus repeat in acycle every eight years, Venus also seems to followfive different patterns in its motion above the horizonas Morning Star, and it displays a similar set of mo-tions as Evening Star over the course of eight years(Aveni 1991, fig. 1). One pattern resembles a figure-eight loop, another the capital letterD(Fig. 2.3a).Near the vernal equinox, Venus reaches its highestposition of all the five cycles. This event occurs veryclose to the time of maximum elongation, when theplanet is positioned farthest away from the Sun.However, maximum elongation does not often co-incide with highest altitude, as can be seen in plotsof these two Venus events throughout the planet’scycle (H. Bricker 1996, figs. 3, 5, 6). Harvey Bricker’s(1996, fig. 8) work shows that the longest intervalof days between the highest altitude and maximumelongation occurs near the autumnal equinox. Al-though Venus at maximum elongation will usuallybe high in the sky, the precise elongation point can-not be seen in the sky; it must be calculated by celes-tial longitude. Bricker supports Aveni’s (1991) con-clusion that the emphasis on maximum elongationsof Venus given in studies of Maya calendrics prob-ably tells us more about what is of interest to West-ern astronomers than what was of interest to Pre-columbian Maya observers.Plotting the intervals of the Morning Star’s ascentand descent in all its seasonal patterns indicates thatVenus seems to shoot up in the sky to attain maxi-mum altitude in approximately 80 days, but then itfollows a more leisurely course in its descent, aver-aging about 180 days. The opposite is true in theEvening Star phase, when the descent from maxi-mum altitude occurs relatively rapidly over 80 days.Venus also appears to change size during its syn-odical cycle. It seems to be six times wider when it isnearest the horizon; this makes it especially largewhen it is about to disappear as Evening Star andafter its first appearance as Morning Star. AlthoughVenus seems to be very large as it is about to movein front of the Sun in inferior conjunction, it is52NAKED-EYE ASTRONOMYFIG. 2.3.a:One of eight seasonal paths of Venus as Morn-ing Star (after Aveni 1992b, fig. 2-4).b:Intersecting paths of Milky Way and ecliptic fromgeocentric perspective."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Maximum Heightin the Pre-Dawn SkyTHE PLANETS53"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"tion event is expected to occur in early April of theyear 2000.The synodic periods of the planets are based onthe observed relationship with the earth’s motionaround the sun. The time to complete a synodicrevolution appears to decrease for planets more dis-tant from the sun. Aveni (1980 : 88) notes that Sat-urn, the most distant of the planets visible with thenaked eye, ‘‘scarcely moves a few degrees on its orbitaround the sun before the earth has gained a lap onit.’’ Thus its synodic period is relatively close to oneyear. Saturn’s synodic period is 378.1 days, and themean interval it is visible in the morning or inthe evening is 353 days, with a mean disappearanceinterval of 25 days. Its mean retrograde period is140 days. Saturn takes 29.45 years to make a circuitaround the sky (sidereal cycle of 10,758.9 days).Jupiter is the largest and brightest of the three su-perior planets. Jupiter’s synodic period is 398.9 days,and its mean retrograde period is 120 days. Jupiter isgone from view for about a month (mean disappear-ance interval 32 days). Since Jupiter is visible ap-proximately 367 nights, its motions can be noted inrelationship to the solar year. Each successive helia-cal rise would occur about a month later (3992365534 days). This places Jupiter in a different stargroup every year, until it finally completes a siderealcycle in 4,332.5 days or about twelve years (just 50.5days short of twelve years; Aveni 1980 : 89, table 6).Because of the planet’s unique red color, Mars iseasy to find as it moves among the stars. Mars com-pletes its sidereal cycle in 687.1 days, a period aboutequal to the mean interval of its visibility (660 days).Thus Mars can be seen to move through all the con-stellations of the zodiac in a single synodic period, apattern it shares with Venus.The synodic period of Mars can vary from 770 to800 days, but the average cycle is 780.0 days or pre-cisely 33260 days, a period that may be linked withthe unique 260-day calendar of Mesoamerica. Themean retrograde period of Mars is relatively short,an average of 75 days, and the interval can fluctuateas much as 10 days from the quoted value (Aveni1980, table 6). Retrograde follows heliacal rise afteran average of 292 days (Justeson 1989 : 100, table 8.5).the planet will appear to move backward (westward)amid the stars, a phenomenon called retrograde mo-tion. The planet continues to orbit in the same direc-tion as the earth, but it seems to move backwardbriefly as the earth passes by, just as a moving carwill seem to drop back abruptly as a faster car passesit. Retrograde motion invariably occurs at a timewhen the superior planet is visible for a relativelylong period of time over the course of the night. Theapproximate midpoint of retrograde motion for thesuperior planets coincides with opposition, whenthe earth is directly between the sun and the planet,which means the planet rises at sunset and sets atdawn. At the time of opposition, a superior planet isusually at its brightest and it is visible for the longestperiod of time during the night; the precise timingof opposition varies with the seasons.The stationary points in retrograde motion areeasily observed, although the exact duration is notreadily detected. Astronomers call these stops thefirst stationary and second stationary, and opposi-tion is the approximate point in time or space be-tween the two (Aveni and Hotaling 1994 : S39). AsBryant Tuckerman’s (1964) tables indicate, the plan-ets do not apply their brakes from full speed to deadstop overnight; rather, they behave more like a gooddriver slowing gradually to a stop. The retrogradeloop is visible as an east-to-west motion in the back-ground of stars (Aveni 1992b : 26, 29 – 30). The entireretrograde period can last for two months in the caseof Mars and over four months for Jupiter and Saturn(Aveni 1980, table 6).In terms of the sidereal cycle, the more distantplanets are exceptionally slow (Aveni 1980, table 6).The superior planets could be visualized as running arace around the Sun. Mars is on the inside track run-ning laps around slower Jupiter and Saturn. Uranusis even slower but lies at the threshold of visibility.Conjunction events involving all three superiorplanets visible with the naked eye, when Mars, Jupi-ter, and Saturn come together in the sky, are rela-tively rare, normally being separated by hundreds ofyears. And a great conjunction of all five planets vis-ible with the naked eye occurs approximately every516.33 years (Pankenier 1997 : 34). Such a conjunc-54NAKED-EYE ASTRONOMY"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"As with the other planets, the timing of the retro-grade period of Mars varies from cycle to cycle, be-cause it is determined by the time when Mars is inopposition to the Sun during its synodic period.The exact timing of the first stationary point is notobservable because the planet is moving so slowlyjust before and after the precise stationary point(V. Bricker and H. Bricker 1986b : 58). Mars showsthe greatest variation in brightness of all the planetsand occasionally can be seen to be almost as brightas Venus (Aveni 1992b : 32). Its maximum brillianceoccurs during retrograde motion when it is in op-position, rising around dusk and visible all nightlong.Mars has the longest period of visibility in themorning or evening sky, lasting an average of 660days before disappearing behind the Sun for approxi-mately 120 days, notably longer than the mean dis-appearance interval of other planets. Heliacal rise(dawn rise) after the period of invisibility is an eventof great significance in the Mars cycle; however, evenusing modern astronomical tables, the exact dateof heliacal rise of Mars during a given synodic pe-riod cannot be predicted, especially during the spring(V. Bricker and H. Bricker 1986b : 65 – 66). Trackingthe conjunction of Mars with the Sun indicates aconjunction sequence that returns the planet at thesame time of year to the same ecliptical positionamid the background of stars every 205 years (Bur-gess 1991, fig. 1).THE STARS AND THE SEASONSOver the centuries, the solar seasons provide thestable framework for the yearly rhythms in the day-time sky; these seasonal cycles are echoed by stars atnight that serve as seasonal markers. Unlike the sun,which meets its appointed schedule without fail yearafter year over the centuries, the stars lag behind thesolar clock. Due to the effects of precession, a slowwobble in the tilt of the earth’s axis, an individualstar near the ecliptic will be seen to rise an average offive to seven days later every five hundred years, butthe degree of shift varies considerably for individualstars (Aveni 1980, table 10).The dawn, or heliacal, rise of a star is importantbecause it marks the reappearance of a star after in-visibility, just as the heliacal set (dusk set) is signifi-cant because it is the last time the star is visible be-fore disappearing in conjunction. Over the course ofseveral years’ observation, the date of these eventscan be determined with some accuracy. However,predicting heliacal rise and set dates of stars withexact precision is a difficult task. Projections backthrough time are even more problematical. Never-theless, astronomers are able to determine past starevents with reasonable accuracy, and many computerprograms are based on these calculations. BradleySchaefer (1987) notes that calculations made bymodern astronomers rely on observational data re-corded by the Babylonians and the Egyptians, andon Ptolemy’s method using thearcus visionis,a mea-sure of the minimum vertical separation required fora planet or star to be visible. He confirms the impor-tance of heliacal rise and set dates, but he finds thatachronical rise (the last day a star is seen to rise aftersunset) is unobservable if the observation took placeexactly at sunset, or ill defined if the observation wasmade at twilight, because this time of night cannotbe precisely defined.The disappearance interval averages about amonth for constellations near the ecliptic. By divid-ing the stars along the ecliptic, Old World astrono-mers developed the zodiac, the twelve constellationsthat serve as ‘‘signs’’ of the months. Western astrolo-gers did not take precession into account, for theyfixed the position of the sun at the spring equinox inAries and then from that point they counted offtwelve equal sections representing the zodiacal signs,despite the variation in size of the constellations. Thezodiacal signs were determined to be of equal di-mensions, each marking the position of the sun dur-ing one month, a system still used by astrologerstoday.Over the course of two thousand years the rela-tionship with the seasons has changed. WhereasAries marked the Sun’s position at the spring equi-nox in Greco-Roman times, for the last two thou-sand years, the spring equinox has been located inPisces. Astrologers tell us that we are entering theTHE STARS AND THE SEASONS55"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"ancient astronomers could have focused on the sameconstellations from the time of the Olmecs up to theconquest, a span of over 2,500 years. For example,the dawn rise of Antares in Scorpius fell in Novem-ber for over 1,500 years (Aveni 1980, table 10). ThePleiades made their dawn rise on May 7 in 500b.c.,announcing the coming rains in late May; bya.d.1500, they rose at dawn on May 29, so that their risecoincided with the onset of the rainy season (Aveni1980, table 10). By adjusting the observation timefrom a dawn rise to dusk set, this stellar clock couldbe used for several thousand years. Today the samestar group sets at dusk on May 3 and rises at dawnon June 4, thus dusk set is seen to announce thecoming rains, and the dawn rise coincides with theactual onset of the rainy season.Other seasonal events played out across the back-ground of stars are the annual meteor showers(‘‘shooting stars’’), generally seen after midnight.The fireballs in a meteor shower occur when theearth passes through the path of an ancient comet,and they are an annually occurring event because theearth encounters the cometary path in the same areaof the sky as it orbits around the sun. These meteorshowers can be quite spectacular, such as the greatLeonid meteor shower of November 13, 1833. Theshowers can be seen in specific constellations at cer-tain times of year. Among the most spectacular arethe Aquarids visible in Aquarius around May 5 andJuly 29; the Perseids in Perseus between August 9and 14; the Orionids in Orion between October 16and 22; the Taurids in Taurus between Novem-ber 1 and 7; and the Leonids in Leo between No-vember 14 and 18. The Geminids in Gemini aroundDecember 14 is a spectacular meteor shower thatproduces about a hundred meteors per hour (Krupp1993 : 67). Meteor showers produce intermittent dis-plays lasting only seconds, whereas a comet may beseen to move across the sky over the course of amonth or more.Comets, which orbit in and out of our solar sys-tem, shine because they reflect sunlight and becausesunlight ionizes their gases. They are of uncertainorigin and have meteoric material as well as gases.Some comets have no tails; others have tails thatspread over millions of miles. The tail, formed by‘‘age of Aquarius,’’ because the position of the Sun atthe spring equinox is shifting to Aquarius, the con-stellation next to Pisces. The entire cycle of preces-sion takes 26,000 years; the starry sky is expected toreturn to the same seasonal position it had in Greco-Roman times some 24,000 years in the future (Aveni1980, fig. 40). Precession results from the changingposition of the celestial pole as Earth wobbles likea top on its axis, currently at a 231⁄27tilt, but point-ing to different stars in the north celestial pole. Thechanging position of the celestial pole does not af-fect the ecliptic, but it does change the positionof the celestial equator and therefore the two equi-nox points where the ecliptic and celestial equatorintersect.The latitude of the observer determines whichstars are visible and which are most prominent.In Mesoamerican latitudes, approximately 147Nto231⁄27N latitude, a number of bright stars cross themeridian very close to the true zenith. Despite slightshifts in position when comparing the Precolumbianskies to those of today, generally these stars can beseen overhead in Mesoamerica today. The Pleiadescrossed the zenith in central Mexico and northernYucata ́ n in Precolumbian times (precise zenith at197218N latitude ina.d.1507; Krupp 1982 : 10). InMesoamerica, most of the circumpolar stars are seento rise and set, except for those right around thepole star. Mesoamerican skies also display southernconstellations not visible in the more northerly lati-tudes of Europe and the United States. Among themost important is the Southern Cross, a cross-shaped constellation that is visible for the longestperiod of time in April, when it is identified as thesign of the night by the Quiche ́ (Chapter 1). TheSouthern Cross marks the southernmost point ofthe Milky Way, a dense band of stars discussed inChapter 7.In the Tropics of Mesoamerica, certain stars onthe Milky Way serve as seasonal indicators of the al-ternation between the rainy and dry seasons. Themost important constellations in this regard are thePleiades, which have marked the beginning of therainy season for thousands of years, and Scorpius,located at the opposite side of the sky, marking theonset of the dry season (Fig. 2.3b).

Halley’scomet’s passing in 1910 was particularly dramatic,but its last appearance in 1986 was disappointing. Itis hard to predict whether a comet’s display will beespecially dramatic, and a similar problem occurswith predictions about annual meteor showers. Nev-ertheless, some astronomers predict a spectacularLeonid meteor shower will be visible on November18, 1999, in Europe and Africa (Upton 1977).

Maya solar imagery featuresthe sun as a ruler of time and space. Ancient cosmic diagrams and solar calendarsevoke a direct connection with concepts that survive today. Solar orientations inPrecolumbian architecture show how the Maya integrated time and space in theirsolar cult.Sun worship translated into political imagery during the Classic Maya period(a.d.250 – 800), when the ruler or a ruling lineage became identified with the sun.Bya.d.1000, the end of the Terminal Classic period, solar lineages faded from view,and solar worship shifted to calendar ceremonies involving the annual festival cal-endar. In the Postclassic period, the Sun God is one of the principal gods mentionedin the sequence of four years of the annual year-bearers’ cycle of the Post-classicperiod, but he is surprisingly rare in the almanacs of the codices and is consideredmalevolent because of an association with drought.Despite the changes over time in the role of the Sun God, Kinich Ahau (sun-facedlord), his visual imagery shows a surprising degree of continuity, for some elementscan be traced from Postclassic back to Preclassic times. Hun Ahau, later known asHunahpu in the Early Colonial period, seems to embody the underworld sun incombination with the Morning Star as far back as the Classic period. Some special-ized aspects of the sun are more limited to certain areas or time periods, such asGIII of the Palenque Triad, a Late Classic manifestation of the underworld sun foundprimarily at this site.Animals and plants could represent the sun in certain contexts. The sun glyphitself symbolized a flower, most probably thePlumeria rubra.Jaguars may belinked with the sun in some contexts. The puma, golden like the sun, representeda solar animal in central Mexican art and possibly also in parts of the Maya area.Although not actually embodying the sun, a monkey sometimes substituted forthe sun during the Classic Period. A scarlet macaw embodied the noonday sun,his red color evoking the solar flames, according to Colonial period accounts. Post-classic codices show the solar macaw carrying a torch. These variations in solar im-agery reflect subtle differences that conveyed specific meanings to the Precolum-bian Maya.This chapter begins with study of the seasonal cycle, the solar calendar, and solarorientations in ancient architecture.

The Chilam Balam of Chumayel, written in1782 in Yucata ́ n, mentions a number of seasonalevents linked with the calendar (Roys 1967 : 23, 85).Xul is the time that fish spawn around early Novem-ber. Yaxkin is the time that the cornstalks are bentdouble in late November. Zac is when the whiteflowers bloom in early February. Mac is when theturtles lay their eggs in late March. Muan is whenthere is a ring around the sun in May. Ralph Royspoints out that the ring around the sun is probablycaused by the smoke from the burning fields inpreparation for planting at the beginning of therainy season. The Chilam Balam text places the firstof Pop on July 16 (Julian, or O.S.), as does FriarLanda’s account dated to the 1560s (Tozzer 1941 :151–153 n. 15). This date corresponds to July 26 inour Gregorian (N.S.) calendar, and is the day of thesecond solar zenith at 197378, the latitude of Edzna ́in the state of Campeche.The sixteenth-century Maya agricultural calendarfollowed the rhythm of the solar seasons, a practicalnecessity for all agricultural peoples. Landa observedthat from the middle of January to April the YucatecMaya collected and burned refuse in the fields (Toz-zer 1941 : 97). Then they sowed at the beginning ofthe rainy season in May, making a hole in the groundwith a pointed stick and dropping in five or sixgrains of maize. In all likelihood, the planting cyclewas coordinated with the first solar zenith in May, asit is today.Landa also recorded a 260-day count beginningin Yax (January 22 –February 10 N.S.). Alfred Toz-zer (1941 : 151–152) presumes that this statementsimply refers to a new 260-day count starting duringthis month, but it may instead refer to the fixed 260-day count that survives today (Milbrath 1981 : 278).Yax overlaps with the date that begins the countamong the Chortı ́ and Mopan (February 8) and thatfound among the Tzotzil (February 5). As discussedin Chapter 1, the 260-day Tzolkin calendar is welladapted to the length of the maize planting cycle inthe Maya area, and it is noteworthy that any pre-diction made for a specific Tzolkin date would notrepeat in the same agricultural cycle. Indeed, prog-nostications using the 260-day ritual calendar inthe codices sometimes show a relationship with thesolar year and the planting cycle (V. Bricker andH. Bricker 1986a; Justeson 1989 :113).The Madrid Codex, a Postclassic Yucatec Mayapainted screenfold book, records a 260-day Tzolkinthat probably was used to determine the best days foragricultural activities in relation to the fixed 260-dayagricultural calendar (Fig. 7.3 and color cover). Inmy opinion, pages 13b –18b refer to a 260-day agri-cultural calendar beginning in Yax, the month whena new 260-day count began, according to Landa’saccount. The month Yax coincides with the onsetof the fixed agricultural calendar in early Februaryfound today among the Maya. And counting 260days brings the calendar to late October, coincidingwith the month Xul (to end) in Landa’s calendar(Milbrath 1981 : 276).The dominant image of the sequence of pages12b –18b is the Chicchan Serpent, so named becausemarkings on its body resemble the day sign Chic-chan. The snake appears with the rain god (Chac)amid a background of rainfall on page 12b. On pages13b –18b there are five other manifestations of theserpent, all associated with falling water. This evokesa direct connection with the multiple aspects ofthe Chicchan serpent, a rain serpent known todayamong the Chortı ́ (Chapter 1). The Pleiades may beimplicated because two of the serpents wear rattletails like the glyph for the Yucatec constellationknown as the ‘‘rattlesnake’s rattle’’ (Chapter 7).The 260-day count begins on page 13b with theday sign Imix, the day that normally begins theTzolkin. Since the fixed agricultural calendar couldbegin on any day of the 260, placing Imix as the firstday shows an idealized beginning point for the fixedcalendar.

If the upper sections areto be read separately, as is usually the case on pageswith almanacs divided in upper and lower sections,another form of calculating the appropriate subdivi-sions in the lower section must be found.Counting the actual number of day signs on eachpage may provide the key to determining the inter-vals representing subdivisions of the 260-day period.The number of day signs on each page is unequal,except for pages 15b –17b, which each show a totalof 40 day signs, indicating a 40-day period not unlikethe contemporary count called ‘‘the feet of the year’’(Miles 1965 : 272). Page 13b displays 32 days (438),and page 14b shows 36 days (439). Pages 15bthrough 17b total 120 days (334310). The result-ing subdivisions are not that different from thoseoriginally proposed, but they give a more convinc-ing result in terms of the intervals between eclipsesshown by winged Kin panels on pages 13b and 17b,widely recognized as eclipse glyphs (Chapter 4).It has been suggested that Madrid Codex pages12b –18b represent an eclipse almanac that predictseclipses in the early tenth century, although HarveyBricker et al. (1997) point out that none of the pre-dicted eclipses were actually seen in the Maya area.They propose that the warning table applied to arelatively brief period of time froma.d.924 to 926.This interpretation runs contrary to the generally ac-cepted Late Postclassic date assigned to the MadridCodex (Taube 1992b : 3). Archaeological evidencesuggests that the codex dates to arounda.d.1350,based on comparison with murals in Tancah Struc-ture 44 (Love 1994 : 9). Another problem with theBrickers’ analysis is that they do not explain the sig-nificance of the Chicchan serpent, the predominanceof weather-related imagery, and the apparent narra-tive sequence of events. I am convinced that myoriginal interpretation of pages 12b –18b remainsvalid, except for minor revisions in the subdivisionsof the Tzolkin discussed above. As will be seen, theMadrid Codex almanac relates to the seasonal cycleof rains. It was reused each year, following the pat-from left to right across the page. The layout showsthe normal sequence of 20 days: Imix, Ix, Akbal,Kan, Chicchan, Cimi, Manik, Lamat, Muluc, Oc,Chuen, Eb, Ben, Ix, Men, Cib, Caban, Etz’nab,Cauac, and Ahau, extending over to page 15b, wherea new cycle of 20 days repeats as the Chicchanserpent reverses direction. The sequence continuesthrough page 18b, but there are only fifty-two signson the first row. The same is true of the other threerows. The unfinished signs on the last page suggestthat each row was intended to have sixty-five signs,completing a layout of 4365 days to divide the 260-day calendar into quarters. Apparently, the artist didnot have room to finish the last day signs, some ofwhich are blocked out but not filled in, a very rare oc-currence in a Maya codex. Perhaps the missing daysare supplied on page 12b, where a black number be-low the Chicchan serpent indicates the appropriateinterval of 13 days. The red number on the same pageindicates a coefficient of 13, presumably to be linkedto one of the 20 day signs that follow. According toHarvey and Victoria Bricker and Bettina Wulfing(Bricker et al. 1997:S29), page 13b shows Imix with acoefficient of one. However, instead of the expectedred number, I see only a black mark, probably addedinadvertently.The pages show a narrative sequence involving aChicchan Serpent that changes its position and ap-pearance over the 260-day period. The overall ar-rangement of the Tzolkin clearly divides the 260 daysin four quarters of 65 days each across the four rows,but smaller subdivisions are suggested by the waythe calendar is arranged on the six pages. Since 260days cannot be divided equally by six, it is clear thatthe intervals on each page must be unequal. Wemust try to reconstruct these intervals, since they areevidently important in understanding the narrativesequence of events shown across the six pages. Origi-nally I proposed that the upper section of pages 14 –18 provided information on the intended intervals,most representing approximately 52 days, except thelast page in the sequence, representing a 27-day pe-riod (Milbrath 1980b, 1981). In addition to provid-ing subdivisions of 52 days, the upper section of eachpage refers to a complete Tzolkin count repeatingthe same sequence of days at 52-day intervals, as seen60PRECOLUMBIAN AND COLONIAL SOLAR IMAGES"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"tern of the fixed 260-day cycle in the agricultural cal-endar today.The eclipse signs in the Madrid Codex probablywarn of eclipses, but they seem to focus attention oneclipses at a specific time of year. Using the subdivi-sions of days determined for each page, the totalnumber of days counting from page 13b to the be-ginning point of page 17b is 148 days (32, 36, 40 plus40), a true eclipse interval like that recorded in theDresden Codex (Chapter 4). Thus, the intervals rep-resented between the two eclipse signs on pages 13band 17b are at an appropriate distance to be aneclipse interval. And if we extend the count to in-clude the 40 days on page 17b, then we have a totalof 188 days, embracing the other eclipse interval of177 days recorded in the Dresden Codex. Therefore,if there was an eclipse in the month that opened thefixed 260-day period shown on page 13b, anothercould be expected to occur around the time of thenew year in Yucata ́ n, during the 40-day period rep-resented on page 17b.The solar eclipse signs on page 12 are not associ-ated with the almanac, and therefore they may floatin time or be emblematic symbols announcing theeclipse sequence to follow. The latter seems likely,given that page 12b actually shows a pair of identicalsolar eclipse signs, which certainly could not refer totwo eclipses at the same time. Indeed, the time pe-riod between two solar eclipses is often the above-mentioned eclipse interval of 148 days.Page 12b serves as an introductory page, showingthe important elements in the pages to come: eclipseglyphs, the sky band, Chac, the Chicchan Serpent,and rainfall. It may also introduce the astronomicalyear beginning around the winter solstice or perhapsslightly earlier on the November solar nadir in theYucatec month Yaxkin (new sun), a name suggestinga beginning point.The fixed 260-day count probably begins on Feb-ruary 8, as in the modern fixed agricultural cycleof the Chortı ́ and coinciding with Landa’s 260-daycount beginning in Yax (January 22 to February 10N.S.). Such a correlation helps us to place the solarevents in relation to the sequence of pages. The startof the fixed 260-day agricultural period appears onpage 13b. If the calendar begins on February 8 onpage 13b with a 32-day period, page 14b with a 36-day period coincides with the spring equinox. As Inoted in previous publications, page 14b shows amale deer without horns, appropriate for March, thetime of year when deer shed their horns in Yucata ́n(Milbrath 1980b : 451; 1981 : 280 – 281). The 40 daysrepresented on page 15b carry the calendar forwardfrom April 17 to May 26, a period coinciding withthe first solar zenith in Yucata ́ n and the disappear-ance of the Pleiades, appropriate because the Chic-chan serpent has lost its rattles on this page. Furthersupport for this placement is seen in the sky band,which represents the intersection point of the MilkyWay and the ecliptic, now prominently positionedabove the western horizon (Chapter 7). Adding thenext period of 40 days on page 16b extends the cal-endar from May 27 to July 5, incorporating the sum-mer solstice. The 40-day count on page 17b beginson July 6 and ends on August 14, coinciding with thesecond solar zenith in Yucata ́ n (Pl. 1). Page 18, thelast page, is incomplete but would certainly incor-porate the fall equinox, and the close of the calen-dar in late October would be supplied by a missingpage or implied by the 13-day interval on page 12(Fig. 7.3). This revised arrangement of the subdivi-sions of the 260-day calendar means that pages 16bto 18b are shifted earlier in time than was presentedin my previous publications, but it does not substan-tially modify the interpretations relating to the Pleia-des, for they remained invisible at dusk for the entireperiod represented by pages 15b –18b.The Madrid Codex probably dates sometime froma.d.1350 to 1450. If there was no intercalation, themonths or festivals Landa recorded at the time of theconquest, more than a century after the codex waspainted, would have to be adjusted. Any given festi-val would be around twenty-six days later in relationto the solar events arounda.d.1450, and fifty-twodays arounda.d.1350. However, I am presumingthat there was some form of intercalation in the LatePostclassic festival calendar, which was created afterthe tenth Baktun came to a close ina.d.1224, atwhich point the Long Count was no longer used inthe codices. I make this assumption because the im-agery shown in the Madrid Codex calendar on pages13b –18b depicts events that parallel Landa’s Yuca-THE SEASONAL CYCLE AND THE SOLAR CALENDAR61"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"century, apparently survived in some form untilmodern times. It is clear that the months were re-lated to seasonal activities in Landa’s time and inlater epochs of the Colonial period. In the nine-teenth century, Pı ́o Pe ́ rez records an association be-tween the new year and the solar zenith in Yucata ́n,falling on July 16 in the Julian calendar (Aveni 1980 :42 – 43). Despite a clear link between the beginningof the new year in Pop and the July 16 date (July 26N.S.) over many centuries, scholars cannot agree onwhether there was a mechanism for intercalation(such as a leap year) to keep the festivals in a fixedrelationship with the solar seasons. Nonetheless, asnoted in Chapter 1, the Tzotzil festival calendar hasremained fixed over the last three hundred years,even though no intercalation is formally acknowl-edged (Berlin 1967).Daniel Flores (1995) has developed a possiblesolution to how the Postclassic Yucatec Maya inter-calated the calendar. He proposes that Landa’s fouryear-bearers, with their associated colors and di-rections, encode a way to intercalate the calendarseamlessly. He concludes that the Maya changed thetime of day that the New Year ceremony was per-formed by rotating ahead one-quarter day everyyear; after four years had elapsed, a full day had beenadded with no real record of an intercalation.Flores notes that in the years named Kan, associ-ated with the south and the color yellow, the cere-mony began at dawn and ran until noon. He pro-poses that the priest positioned himself to the southto observe the sun until it reached its noon position,symbolized by yellow for the resplendent sun over-head. In the next year, a Muluc year associated withthe east and red, the ceremonies began at noon andran until sunset. Now the priest positioned himselfto the east and looked to the west to observe the set-ting sun, associated with the color red because of thered glow of sunset. Then followed an Ix year, sym-bolized by the north and black; the ceremony beganat sunset and continued to midnight. At this time,the priest positioned himself to the north and fo-cused his attention on the underworld, waiting forthe sun to reach its lowest position at midnight, sym-bolized by the color black (however, Landa specifiesthe color of the Ix year-bearer as white; Tozzer 1941 :tec Maya festival calendar. And festivals described byLanda seem related to events in the solar year andthe agricultural calendar.Page 13b apparently overlaps with the month ofYax in Landa’s calendar (January 12 – 31 O.S.), whichwould end on February 10 in our Gregorian calen-dar, around the beginning of the agricultural cal-endar recorded today among the Maya. An incenseburner suggests a link with the incense ceremony inYax; Chac shown with an overturned jar and a flam-ing bundle evokes the festival of the Chacs in Chenor Yax (Milbrath 1981 : 280; Tozzer 1941 : 161).On page 14b, a death god holds a torch up to adeer, suggesting the sacrifice of a deer by fire in Mac,a monthly festival that ran from March 13 to April 1O.S. (March 23 to April 11 N.S.; Milbrath 1981 :280 – 281). During Mac, the Maya hunted wild ani-mals, removed their hearts and burned them, andthen doused the flames with water. Tozzer (1941 :162 –163) points out that the ceremony is appropri-ately namedtup kaak,meaning ‘‘put out the fire.’’The fire ritual probably also refers to fires set in thefields to clear them in preparation for planting.On page 15b, the merchant God M correspondsto the Muan festival honoring the merchant gods inMay (Milbrath 1981 : 281; Tozzer 1941 : 164). At thistime, merchants probably returned from their ex-tended trading expeditions, for the coming rainswould make long-distance trade difficult.Page 17b coincides with the New Year ceremoniesin Pop, which began on July 16 O.S. in Landa’s cal-endar. Although there does not seem to be a specificreference to the New Year events in the imagery, themultiple Chacs on page 17b are appropriate to therepeated references to the Chacs in Landa’s accountof the month Pop (Tozzer 1941 : 151–153). Page 18bbegins on August 5 (August 15 N.S.), marking a40-day period that overlaps with the beginning ofLanda’s month Uo on August 6 (August 16 N.S.). Al-though there is no clear link with the events de-scribed for that month, the preceding page shows afrog that might be linked with Uo, for this is theYucatec name for a variety of small frogs (Thompson1960 :108).Landa’s festival calendar, documenting the sea-sonal events and ceremonies in the mid-sixteenth62PRECOLUMBIAN AND COLONIAL SOLAR IMAGES"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"138). In the last year of the four-year sequence, aCauac year represented by the west and white, theceremony began at midnight and ended at dawn;the priest positioned himself to the west to observethe rising sun, associated with white because thatis the usual color of the dawn sky (however, Landaspecifies the color in Cauac years as black).Although the colors Landa assigns to the northand west are different from those in the model pre-sented by Flores, there are certain aspects of Landa’scalendar that confirm the associations proposed byFlores. Landa describes Cauac New Year ceremoniesas a nocturnal event, just as Flores suggests a noctur-nal association for observations made in the CauacNew Year ceremony (Tozzer 1941 : 147 –149). Fur-thermore, Cauac involved intoxication, which wasprobably restricted to nocturnal ceremonies if theYucatec Maya followed practices like those of the Az-tecs, who were prohibited from drinking intoxicatingbeverages before dusk. The Ix New Year ceremony, anocturnal event according to Flores, also involvedintoxication.Flores’s proposal that the Postclassic Yucatec Mayaadded a quarter day every year over 4 years explainshow a leap day would accumulate after 4 years. Fur-thermore, moving the ceremonies forward by sixhours each year would explain why Landa states thatthe Yucatec Maya have a year of 365 days and sixhours (Tozzer 1941 : 133). However, a major prob-lem with this interpretation remains. The New Yearday is fixed on July 16 O.S., but the divination cal-endar (the Tzolkin) ran continuously without break.Rotating ceremonies forward one-quarter day everyyear would mean that 4 years hence, when the nextCauac year occurred, a full day would have accumu-lated. This means that the year-bearer day sign Cauacwould not fall on the first day of the year, but wouldinstead fall on the last day of the Uayeb (the five daysat year end). It is possible that during the Postclassicperiod the months were simply shifted without re-gard for the Tzolkin, so that the first day of Pop andthe new year always fell on July 16, and the year-bearer date was allowed to slip slowly through theyear, occurring five days earlier every 20 years. After52 years, the year-bearer would fall thirteen days be-fore the July 16 date, which may have been the timewhen an adjustment was made to realign the year-bearer. Or perhaps there was a shift to a new year-bearer set over the centuries, for different sets seemto be used in codices that presumably date to differentepochs, such as the Dresden Codex and the MadridCodex. Landa’s year-bearers (Kan, Muluc, Ix, andCauac) are like those of the Madrid Codex (34 – 37).The Madrid Codex New Year pages each feature asky band. On page 34, we find a priest-astronomerlooking at the night sky in the Cauac years, indicat-ing that the ceremony is nocturnal, as in Flores’s in-terpretation and Landa’s descriptions of the Cauacceremony (Tozzer 1941 : 147 –149). On page 37, wesee a dog howling at a crescent moon in the Ix years,another appropriate nocturnal image if New Yearceremonies took place from dusk to midnight, asproposed by Flores (Fig. 5.1i).There are other lines of evidence indicating aninterest in the solar year in the codices. The DresdenCodex seems to refer to the stations of the Haab(365-day year), the summer solstice, meteorologicalevents, and Yucatec Maya agricultural activities, ac-cording to Victoria and Harvey Bricker (1992). Theseevents are positioned in relation to intervals that aresubsets of the 260-day calendar, most often subdi-vided in five sets of 52 days or four sets of 65 days.The most common subdivisions of the 260-daycalendar in Yucatec Maya codices are groups of 52days, and in northern Yucata ́ n such subsets could beused in conjunction with a solar count from one so-lar zenith to the next. At Dzibilchaltu ́ n (217068N), atthe northern limits of the Maya area in Yucata ́ n, theinterval between the first solar zenith (May 25) andthe second (July 17) is exactly 52 days, a period thatseems to be recorded in architectural orientations(Coggins and Drucker 1988 : 24).Periods of fifty-two days seem to relate to intervalsin the solar cycle beyond the Maya area as well. Theobservatory or zenith tube at Xochicalco (18788N)marks an interval of fifty-two days from when the sunfirst enters the chamber on April 29/30 to the sum-mer solstice (Morante Lo ́ pez 1995 : 47, 60). Rube ́nMorante Lo ́ pez points out that similar configura-tions may be evident near the northern limit of theMaya area at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ (207408N), where theOsario has a zenith tube that remains to be tested. InTHE SEASONAL CYCLE AND THE SOLAR CALENDAR63"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"took place throughout history. Indeed, Edmonson(1988 : 99, 124 –127, 148) has traced a number of cal-endar changes in Mesoamerican history. He suggeststhat Edzna ́ ’s calendar derives from a revised solarcalendar that is first seen at Uxmal ina.d.649.The Tzolkin provides the framework for a cal-endar count tied into a 364-day computing yearthat may have keyed to the solstices and equinoxes.Dresden Codex pages 61– 69 record intervals of91 days, the closest integral approximation of themean length of time between the solstices and equi-noxes (V. Bricker and H. Bricker 1989 : 239). Suchintervals are actually quite common in the DresdenCodex, sometimes forming part of a larger cycle of1,820 days (73260520391). The Paris Codex(23 – 24) also incorporates an 1,820-day cycle di-vided into 364-day periods (Chapter 7). Edmonson(1988 : 111) postulates that the earliest form of solarcalendar in Mesoamerica was a year based on obser-vations of the two solstices and the two equinoxes,calculated at 91-day intervals, yielding a calendar of364 days.David Kelley (1983; 1989 : 66 –71) proposes thatrecords of the tropical year on Classic Maya monu-ments allow approximate determination of the equi-noxes and solstices. Linda Schele (1990a :145 –146)finds tropical year anniversaries recorded at Palen-que in the Classic period. Andrea Stone (1982; 1995b :164, table 4) notes that seasonal cycles are apparentin the Classic period dates recorded for rituals in aGuatemalan cave called Naj Tunich. She points outthat some dates are separated by four years minusone day, and an expression deciphered as ‘‘he ar-rived’’ (hul-i) coincides with dates around the wintersolstice. Calendar Round dates record recurring so-lar events at Yaxchila ́ n. Carolyn Tate (1992) notesthat some Yaxchila ́ n glyphic inscriptions focus on ze-nith passage dates, and ball-game events seem tocluster in October. A ritual involving a staff withbanner (known as a ‘‘flap-staff ’’) and a fire event areboth linked with dates clustering around the sum-mer solstice at Yaxchila ́ n (Tate 1992, app. 2). NikolaiGrube (1992 : 207 – 208) interprets these scenes as adance performed by a ruler in warrior costume. Thissuggests that the warrior dance is linked with theOaxaca, to the west of the Maya area, the subdivisionof sixty-five days may be significant. At Monte Alba ́n(177038N), the zenith tube in Structure P seems tomark an interval of sixty-five days from the pointthat the sun first enters the tube on April 17 to thesummer solstice, and another sixty-five days passuntil it is last visible in the tube (Morante Lo ́ pez1995 : 55).The intervals between the solar zeniths can alsobe related to the 260-day calendar. Vincent Malm-stro ̈ m (1997 : 52 –53, table 3, fig. 10) argues thatIzapa (14788N), near the southern limit of the Mayaarea, was the origin of the 260-day calendar becauseit is here that the days from the second zenith pas-sage to the first total exactly 260. He places the originof the 260-day almanac at 1359b.c., when 1 Imixcoincided with the August 13 zenith passage date atIzapa. However, there are no early Tzolkin recordsat Izapa that predate the eighth Baktun. Further-more, Munro Edmonson (1988 : 119) cautions thatthe idea of linking the zero point of the calendar onAugust 13 to the zenith passage at Izapa works onlyif you use the 584,285 correlation. Nonetheless, hesupports Malmstro ̈ m’s conclusion that a division ofthe year into segments of 105/260 is evident in theplacement of the zenith date at Izapa. I would addthat the interval of 105 days between the two solarzeniths may also refer to the growing period of theprincipal maize crop, which is planted following thefirst solar zenith at the end of April and first maturesaround the second solar zenith in mid-August.Malmstro ̈ m (1991 : 42 – 45; 1997, fig. 35) suggeststhat Edzna ́ (197378N) in Campeche was where the365-day calendar originated because here the zenithsun coincides with July 26 (July 16 O.S.), the begin-ning of the year in Yucata ́ n recorded by Landa. Heconcludes that the solar calendar was not interca-lated, and calculates its origin date asa.d.48, whenthe beginning of Pop coincided with the zenith sun.His ideas are intriguing, but we do not find veryearly solar calendar inscriptions at Edzna ́ . His con-clusions rest on the notion of a continuous solarcalendar traced back fifteen hundred years fromLanda’s sixteenth-century descriptions, an unlikelysituation given the calendar reforms that certainly64PRECOLUMBIAN AND COLONIAL SOLAR IMAGES"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"summer solstice, perhaps related to capture eventsaround this time of year.Werner Nahm (1994) notes that capture eventsduring the Classic period are more common in therainy season, whereas full-scale star wars —wars des-ignated with star-glyph verbs — cluster from Novem-ber through January. Few star wars took place atplanting time, and none at all occurred during theharvest between mid-September and late October.Seasonal patterning of star-war dates in Classic Mayainscriptions indicates that the preferred time for war-fare was between the autumn equinox and the springequinox, according to John Justeson (1989 : 107), whonotes that mature corn in the fields provided a foodsupply for the warriors at this time of year. AnthonyAveni and Lorren Hotaling (1994 : S45 – S46) statisti-cally demonstrate a marked clustering of star-warevents in the dry season. Hotaling (1995) records apaucity of star-war dates from June through Novem-ber. Joyce Marcus (1992 : 430 – 421, table 11.1) notesthat warfare events concentrated in the dry season,especially between November 13 and May 5. Sea-sonality also played a part in the dates selected forwarfare during the Postclassic period, for the dry sea-son was preferred for warfare by the Aztecs and theYucatec Maya (Milbrath 1988c; Torquemada 1943,2 : 299; Tozzer 1941 : 217). Indeed, this pattern sur-vived into the nineteenth century, when the Maya ofYucata ́ n abruptly abandoned their fight in the CasteWar to return to their fields at the beginning of therainy season to prepare for planting (Reed 1964 : 99).The Classic Maya must have had an annual cycleof festivals, but the festivals were not closely linkedwith the 20-day months, which slowly shifted posi-tion relative to the solar year (tropical year) of365.2422 days. As we have seen, tropical-year eventsseem to be recorded in a number of calendric inscrip-tions on Maya monuments at Yaxchila ́ n, reflecting aninterest in the seasonal cycle. Also, events in the livesof rulers were linked with important solar events. Ac-cession anniversaries at Palenque follow a pattern co-ordinated with the solar year (Justeson 1989 : 113).In one case, it seems that the burial of a Copa ́ n rulerwas delayed for five days to coincide with the sum-mer solstice (Schele and Larios 1991 : 3 – 4).Karl Taube (1988b : 333 – 334) recognizes a springceremony in Classic Maya imagery showing a deer-man in a scaffold sacrifice scene. He proposes thatthe ceremony incorporates three distinct agricul-tural events: torching the victim’s back representsthe milpa burning in March; spearing his flesh rep-resents the planting in May; and the blood flow sym-bolizes the rains of May. He correlates the ceremonywith sixteenth-century descriptions of the monthsMac and Pax in Landa’s calendar and suggests a pos-sible relationship with a central Mexican ceremonydedicated to Xipe Totec. It is likely that many otherseasonal ceremonies appear in Classic Maya imagery,but research in this area has been scanty.This brief survey indicates that we are only begin-ning to understand the importance of the seasonalcycle among the Precolumbian Maya. In the latePostclassic period, there is evidence of an interca-lated 260-day agricultural calendar and an intercal-ated festival calendar that follows the solar seasonsand agricultural events, like some of the calendarspreserved among the Maya today. Seasonal ceremo-nies and events may be reconstructed from study ofLanda’s festival calendar and from specific imagesthat seem connected with this calendar, especiallythose seen in the Madrid Codex. The Early Postclas-sic and Classic period inscriptions do not show afixed solar calendar, but certain dates show patternsand clusters of events linked to the tropical year.SOLAR ORIENTATIONSIN ARCHITECTUREThe Maya probably performed solar rituals in archi-tectural complexes with alignments keyed to specificsolar events. The horizon position of the sun on theequinoxes, zenith passages, and solstices was impor-tant in the alignment of Maya architecture (Aveni1980 : 258 – 286). Anthony Aveni and Horst Hartung(1986, table 3) developed a hypothetical solar calen-dar for the Maya area based on orientations centeredaround the zenith passage dates. A number of ori-entations reflect an alignment toward sunset twentydays before the zenith passage. They also present aSOLAR ORIENTATIONS IN ARCHITECTURE65"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"equinox complex erected to honor the end Katun9.13.0.0.0 (3/16 /692 N.S.), just before the springequinox.

Further study of this temple’sorientations is required.Equinox orientations occur at other Classic pe-riod sites in Yucata ́ n. Recent studies of the Labyrinth(the Sanunsat) at Oxkintok (207348N) indicate thata number of small openings in the west wall are ori-ented toward the equinox, or within a few days ofthe equinox (Ferra ́ ndez 1990, table 1). Kaba ́ h mayalso show equinox alignments (Aveni and Hartung1989 : 453).The Classic period Castillo at Chiche ́ n Itza ́(207408N), also known as the Pyramid of Kukulcan,expresses a relationship with the solar year in its ori-entations and in the four staircases with 91 steps perside, which, when added to the temple platform asthe final step, total 365. At sunset on the equinoxes,shadows formed by the nine levels or stages of thepyramid create serpent markings all along the ser-pent balustrade on the north side of the Castillo(Aveni 1980, fig. 104; Krupp 1997 : 268 – 269). On thesouth side, a similar effect takes place at dawn (Mo-rales 1990 : 31). My research indicates that the east-west alignment of the temple on top of the pyramidexpresses a relationship with the solar zenith and so-lar nadir (Fig. 3.1a). The west face and doorway ofthe pyramid temple is aligned with a 2917azimuthtoward the zenith sunset on May 25 and July 20 atthe latitude of Chiche ́ n Itza ́ (Milbrath 1988c).

Fromthe vantage point of a Preclassic pyramid known asE-VIIsub, one sees three temples on a raised plat-form. The summer solstice sun rises behind thenorthern temple, the equinox sun rises behind thecentral one, and the winter solstice sun rises behindthe southern temple (Aveni 1980 : 277 – 280, fig. 100).At nearby Tikal, there is a similar observatory in thePreclassic complex of the Mundo Perdido group,where the Great Pyramid (5C-54) faces a terracesupporting three temples that mark the positions ofthe rising sun at solstices and equinoxes (Agurciaand Valde ́ s 1994 : 112 –113; Fialko 1988b). Struc-ture VI at Calakmul also seems to be part of a Pre-classic observatory complex like that of Group E atUaxactu ́ n (Folan et al. 1995, fig. 4).Dzibilchaltu ́ n, located at 217068N, has an east-west causeway (sacbe) aligned toward architecturalgroups that appear to be part of a complex of solarobservatories (Aveni and Hartung 1989, table 35.3;Coggins and Drucker 1988).

When viewed from Stela3, the equinox sun rises where the tower of thetemple meets the flat roof, forming a sort of ‘‘seat’’for the rising sun (Coggins and Drucker 1988, figs.3, 11).

Aveni and Hartung (1986, table2; 1991, table 1) point out that at the latitude of Ux-mal (207228N), the solar zeniths (May 22 and July 22N.S.) are spaced one lunar month from the summersolstice on June 21. The doorway of the lower templeof the Pyramid of the Old Woman has a zenith sun-set orientation (2917588). And the orientation of theChenes temple (2797298azimuth) on the west faceof the Pyramid of the Magician anticipates the firstsolar zenith by forty days (two Uinals). Anotheralignment from the pyramid crossing the Nunnerycourtyard to the Platform of Stelae marks the posi-tion of the setting sun on the summer solstice.At Tikal (177138N), alignments between templesshow an interest in solar events. The facade on Tem-ple III is aligned with an azimuth of 1087168, facingthe solar nadir (antizenith) sunrise (Aveni and Har-tung 1988, table 2). A line running from Temple IIIto Temple I has an azimuth (897548) oriented to theequinox sunrise. The facade of Temple I faces west(2807358) toward sunrise 20 days before the solar ze-nith. Another alignment from Temple IV lookingeast to Temple I marks the azimuth (1047) of sunriseon February 14 and October 29, dates that approxi-mate a division of the year into two segments of 105and 260 days. It is noteworthy that these dates arevery close to the beginning and end of the fixed 260-day agricultural calendar preserved among the Mayatoday.Tikal is located at the ideal latitude for a struc-tured calendar count of Uinals linking the zenithpassages, equinoxes, and solstices (Aveni 1989 : 238).The spring equinox is 2320 days before the firstsolar zenith, and the summer solstice is 2320 daysbefore the second solar zenith. The 40-day periodtoward the nadir sunrise on November 22 and Janu-ary 21 (1117azimuth). The November solar nadirsunrise coordinates with the onset of the dry season,the beginning of the harvest, and the season of war(Milbrath 1988c : 62 – 63).The Caracol at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ , constructed towardthe end of the Classic period, has several solar align-ments (Fig. 3.1b; Aveni 1980, figs. 89 – 91; Aveni et al.1975, table 1, fig. 5). The tower of the circular struc-ture has a window oriented to observe the settingsun at the equinoxes, a stairway niche with one wallaligned at an azimuth of 2927548(227548north ofwest), facing the position of the setting sun on thesolar zenith. The Caracol platform is irregularlyshaped so that the northeast corner points towardthe rising sun at the summer solstice and the south-west corner points to the winter solstice sunset.The orientation of the Temple of the Four Lintelsat Chiche ́ n Itza ́ reflects an azimuth of 2927478(227478north of west), facing the setting sun on thesolar zenith (Aveni 1980, table 9; Aveni, personalcommunication 1988). Lintel 1 on the temple fea-tures a Kin-marked bird whose wings bear markingslike the day sign Etz’nab (Krochock 1988 : 51, 153,231– 232; 1989, fig. 4; G. Stuart 1989, fig. 3). Thelintel records a ball-game event on 9 Lamat 11 Yax,a Calendar Round date reconstructed as 10.2.12.1.8(7/7/881 O.S.; 7/11/881, N.S.). The ball game tookplace nine days before the second solar zenith(July 20). A date this close to the solar zenith, cou-pled with the zenith orientation, may confirm thatthe structure was somehow dedicated to rituals in-volving the solar zenith.Other orientations at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ reflect an in-terest in dates about a month before and after thesolar zenith (Fig. 3.1a). In the Upper Temple of theJaguars, facing a 2867azimuth, the setting sun castsa circle of light at the center of the back wall onApril 29 and August 13 (N.S.). Jesu ́ s Galindo (1994 :127) suggests that this indicates an alignment thatdivides the calendar into two sections of 105 daysand 260 days. August 12 –13 has calendric impor-tance because it falls 52 days after the summer sol-stice throughout Mesoamerica, and it coincides withthe second solar zenith at Teotihuaca ́ n, a site thatmay have influenced the development of the calen-68PRECOLUMBIAN AND COLONIAL SOLAR IMAGES"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"survives today as the interval the Maya refer to as the‘‘feet of the year.’’ The Chilam Balam of Chumayelsays that the Uinal of 20 days was created by measur-ing the footstep of our Lord, apparently equated withthe sun in this eighteenth-century manuscript (Roys1967 : 116).The two zenith dates divide the calendar into 105/260-day intervals at the latitude of Copa ́ n (147528N).Zenith orientations are not clearly evident fromAveni’s (1980, app. A) measurements of Copa ́nalignments, but a sight line running for about fourmiles from Copa ́ n Stela 12 to Stela 10 provides abaseline that anticipates the first solar zenith date by20 days. When viewed from Stela 12, the sun passesbehind Stela 10 on April 12, one Uinal before thefirst solar zenith, and again on September 1, oneUinal after the second solar zenith (Aveni 1980 :240 –243, fig. 78). This baseline is also seen in the windowof Structure 22, which also seems to be aligned toobserve Venus events (Chapter 5).A division of the 365-day calendar into two un-equal segments of 105 and 260 days is suggested bythe orientations found at a number of sites, includ-ing Palenque (177308N; Anderson et al. 1981; Gal-indo 1994 : 128, 169). A T-shaped window in thetower of the Palace on the west side casts a beam oflight on an oblique wall for 105 days, from April 30to August 12, dates also seen in the alignments atChiche ́ n Itza ́ and Teotihuaca ́ n, as noted earlier. TheT-shaped light pattern reaches its maximum width,extending completely across the wall, on the sum-mer solstice.Other alignments at Palenque involve the play oflight and shadow or sight lines from one building toanother. The winter solstice sun sets in a line run-ning from the Palace tower to the center of the Tem-ple of the Inscriptions, which houses the tomb of Pa-cal II (Schele 1977 : 49). The Temple of the Sun isoriented toward the rising sun at the winter solsticeso that sunlight would shine into the entrance of thetemple (Aveni 1992b : 66; Carlson 1976 : 110). Tem-ple XIV also faces the winter solstice sunrise, andHouse D of the Palace faces the zenith sunset, whichoccurs in early May and early August at the latitudeof Palenque (Aveni and Hartung 1979 : 173 –174,fig. 1, table 1). A line from the Temple of the Crossto the Temple of the Inscriptions marks the summersolstice sunset over the tomb. Aveni and Hartungalso note that House E has an azimuth of 157348, likethat at Teotihuaca ́ n. Perhaps the alignment allowsthe setting sun to illuminate Pacal’s image on theOval Tablet of Pacal. The throne below records hisaccession on 9.9.2.4.8 5 Lamat 1 Mol (7/27/615 N.S.),a date close to the August 12 date linked with theTeotihuaca ́ n orientation.Solstice orientations are prominent at Yaxchila ́n(167578N), where they occur on structures that beardates referring to the solstices, according to CarolynTate (1989: 417, 425, table 32.2; 1992 : 111–112,fig. 43). Every temple Bird Jaguar IV built expresseda relationship with the summer and winter solsticesunrise axes. Structure 33 was oriented so that thesummer solstice sunrise bathed the sculpture of BirdJaguar IV in light (Fig. 3.1c; Tate 1989 : 418). Struc-tures with orientations toward the summer solsticeand the winter solstice at Yaxchila ́ n are set slightlyoutside the path of the sun, allowing for only a fewminutes of illumination of the interior of the build-ing on the solstices.The pattern of solar orientations seen in Classicarchitecture survives in Postclassic times at Tulum(207128N). The Temple of the Diving God (Struc-ture 5) faces the azimuth (292748) of the setting sunon the solar zenith (Galindo 1994 : 170). And a beamof light enters through the east-facing window, illu-minating the area beneath the Diving God at sunrisearound the winter solstice (Iwaniszewski 1987 : 212).Since there is a long-standing tradition of align-ments toward the solar zenith sun, we should askhow these observations were made before any archi-tecture was set in place. The zenith sun position isdetermined by observing the day that the sun castsno shadow at noon. A stela, stick, or even the humanbody could be used to measure whether there is ashadow at noon. Another form of measurement isimplied in a Colonial period account in the CodexPe ́ rez that alludes to May 20 (around the first solarzenith) as a ‘‘good day to measure the height of thesun’’ (Craine and Reindorp 1979 : 28, 147).At Tikal, a columnar sculpture surmounted by astone ring could have been used to measure shadowlength and as a sighting station for observations ofSOLAR ORIENTATIONS IN ARCHITECTURE69"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"in the third, while the Chumayel does not positionthe sun, but places a god called Esperas in thesixth, no doubt the equivalent of Hesperas, a Eu-ropean name for Venus as the Evening Star. RalphRoys (1967 : 110 –111) points out that the crystal-line layers recall the classical system of Ptolemaicastronomy imported from Europe in the Early Co-lonial period. Another section of the manuscriptalludes to thirteen lay-ers of heaven, but does notposition the Sun in any specific layer (Roys 1967 :99, n. 3; Villa Rojas 1969 : 274 – 275). The text de-scribes how nine malevolentbolontiku ́seized thethirteenoxlanhuntiku ́,after which there was a greatflood and the sky fell at the end of the world age;one passage implies that theoxlanhuntiku ́are lay-ers of heaven, but another suggests that they are acount of time or days (Roys 1967 : 94 n. 5). Thelayers of heaven and the underworld may reflectthe time-space continuum seen in the Sun’s move-ment through the sky and underworld, as in mod-ern Tzotzil accounts. Indeed, Mayan directions arenot discrete cardinal or intercardinal directions;rather, they are trajectories relating to the Sun’sdaily course that are inseparable from the passageof time (B. Tedlock 1992b : 178).Colonial period diagrams incorporate the notionof a quadripartite time-space continuum involvingthe Sun. The Chilam Balam of Chumayel depictsthe motion of the Sun in a diagram with a series ofdots positioned in a ring around the circular earth;the outer ring has four black areas creating a cruci-form design with Earth in the center (Roys 1967 : 87,fig. 7). In the Chilam Balam of Kaua, the Katunwheel has a round earth in the center, quartered toshow the cardinal directions; diagonal lines intersectin the center and extend beyond the earth to showthe horizon extremes at the solstices (Aveni 1980 :155 –156, fig. 57a). The diagonals or intercardinalpoints end in star glyphs that may refer to Venus,suggesting a connection with both the horizon ex-tremes of the Sun and Venus. Between the intercar-dinal points, the diagram notes the names of fourdirections, with east (lakin) at the top, north (xa-man) to the right, west (chikin) below, and south(nohol) to the left; their placement suggests the car-dinal points. A cardinally oriented cross accompa-the sun or stars on the horizon. It is usually identi-fied as a ball-court marker, but it actually was origi-nally positioned on Altar 48-sub, suggesting a fixedobservation point like Stela 3 at Dzibilchaltu ́ n (Fi-alko 1988a, fig. 4a). A figurine in the Museum of An-thropology in Me ́ rida shows an aged deity or priestholding a sighting device similar in design, but muchsmaller (Fig. 3.1d).We can conclude that architecture provided thefixed vantage point for observations of specific so-lar positions. Some structures clearly have observingstations such as niches, windows, or vertically posi-tioned stones, such as stelae. The featureless hori-zon in many areas of Yucata ́ n would have made solarobservatories essential for marking the solar calen-dar. In more mountainous areas to the south, how-ever, the sun was probably observed in relation toindividual mountains. Even there, solar orientationsin architecture probably remained important be-cause the Maya conducted solar rituals in these com-plexes. Having the sun reach its proper position dur-ing a public ritual helped to confirm the power ofthe ruler, showing participation in cosmic events.Furthermore, solar observations may have been theprincipal means of fixing festival dates during theClassic Maya period.THE SUN IN PRECOLUMBIANMAYA COSMIC DIAGRAMSAccording to Colonial period accounts, the Sunmoves through a layered heaven. The Chilam Balamof Manı ́, which reflects a strong element of Europeaninfluence, places the Moon in the first layer or can-opy of heaven, Venus in the third, the Sun and Mer-cury in the fourth, Mars in the fifth canopy, and Ju-piter and Saturn in the sixth (Craine and Reindorp1979 : 49 –50). The only feature that distinguishesthis account from the Ptolemaic system of crystal-line spheres is that the European model placesMercury in the second layer and Saturn in theseventh.The Chilam Balam of Kaua illustrates a layeredcosmos with the Sun in the fourth layer and Venus70PRECOLUMBIAN AND COLONIAL SOLAR IMAGES"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"nies the notation for east, and the Katun sequence isin a clockwise rotation (13 Ahau, 11 Ahau, etc.), withEuropean-style faces substituting for the traditionalMaya Ahau glyphs. The east is ‘‘up,’’ conformingwith some modern Maya accounts (Chapter 1).The Postclassic Madrid Codex (75 –76) shows theunion of time and space with a quadripartite dia-gram (Fig. 3.2a). Unlike the Katun wheel, the diagramplaces west in the ‘‘up’’ position with respect to thepage layout. In the Madrid Codex, the directionalglyphs for east and west both incorporate a variantof the Kin glyph known as T544 in Eric Thompson’s(1962) system of notation. A cupped hand is addedfor west (T671) and an upside-down Ahau face foreast. North incorporates a simian face resemblingGod C, and the glyph for south is partially effacedbut seems to conform to the conventional Postclassicglyph compound for south. Twenty day signs are ar-ranged around a square enclosing the central image;but instead of following the conventional sequence,they begin with four-day intervals and rotate in acounterclockwise fashion rather than clockwise, ason the Katun wheel. Around the perimeter, the datesin the 260-day calendar also move in a counterclock-wise fashion (i.e., 13 Chicchan followed by 1 Cimito lower right of central square). Dots between theday signs represent sets of 13 days. The total designevokes the quadripartite completion sign that may belinked with the cycles of the Sun and Venus (Coggins1980; Coggins and Drucker 1988). Footsteps mark-ing the diagonal axes seem to chart a time-spacecontinuum, most probably related to the course ofthe Sun. The footsteps suggest comparison with con-temporary Maya counts of 40 days known as the‘‘feet of the year.’’The Madrid Codex diagram and the one on Co-dex Feje ́ rva ́ ry-Mayer 1 both share a similar format,for they combine two different types of crosses, eachenclosed by dots representing days. The diagonalcross, usually described as a St. Andrew’s Cross, ispositioned between the arm of a rectilinear cross re-ferred to as a Maltese Cross (compare Figs. 3.2a and4.4i). Aveni (1980 : 154 –157) notes that the diagonalSt. Andrew’s Cross represents the horizon extremesat the solstices, and the Maltese Cross depicts thecardinal directions with the zenith at the center.Some notable differences can be seen in the two dia-grams. Whereas the Madrid Codex places God Q, agod of human sacrifice, and the Death God in thenorth, Codex Feje ́ rva ́ ry-Mayer 1 shows the MaizeGod and Death God in the south (linked with theyear sign Rabbit, symbolizing the south). In the Ma-drid Codex, the directional glyphs appear within thearms of a Maltese Cross. On the other hand, the Co-dex Feje ́ rva ́ ry-Mayer establishes the directions at thecorners of the St. Andrew’s Cross, marking intercar-dinal directions with different year-bearer glyphs,each carried by a different bird. Like the Aztec sys-tem, these follow conventional Postclassic patterns,with the year-bearer Reed for east, Knife (flint) fornorth, House for west, and Rabbit for south.Ulrich Ko ̈ hler (1980 : 587) says that the year-bearer dates at the corners symbolize the solsticeextremes at the intercardinal directions in both dia-grams. However, the Madrid Codex places the direc-tions at cardinal points, on vertical and horizontalaxes. Furthermore, the Madrid Codex does not seemto treat the dates as year-bearers, because we find thedate 1 Cauac on page 76 associated with the north(with God Q to the right), whereas the year-bearer 1Cauac is linked with west, as are all Cauac dates onthe New Year page 34 in the Madrid Codex. Futurestudy should involve a more detailed comparison ofthe two diagrams, for although visually similar, theyclearly show somewhat different constructs that maybe significant in revealing variations in concepts oftime and space.Scholars agree that in Maya glyphic writing eastis linked with sunrise and west with sunset, corre-sponding to contemporary Maya concepts, but theydisagree about the glyphs referring to the other twodirections. Some interpret these as north and south,referring to cardinal directions or, more generally,the sides of heaven associated with these cardinaldirections. Others visualize cosmic directions in ver-tical space, with north and south linked with aboveand below or zenith and nadir. Barbara Tedlock(1992b :173) says that the directional glyphs in theClassic inscriptions and Postclassic codices can beread phonetically in Yucatec Maya as east (lak’ k’in),west (chik’ k’in), zenith (yax), and nadir (mal).The zenith and nadir readings can be debated, forTHE SUN IN PRECOLUMBIAN MAYA COSMIC DIAGRAMS71"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"72PRECOLUMBIAN AND COLONIAL SOLAR IMAGES"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Justeson (1989 : 119, 126 n. 41) recognizes glyphs forsix directions on Madrid Codex 77 –78, noting thatin addition to the four traditional glyphs, there aretwo that include the sign for earth (kab), which heinterprets as zenith and nadir, and he readsxamanas north.Glyphs for the four directions painted on an EarlyClassic period tomb at Rı ́o Azul show that east andwest clearly refer to horizon positions of the sun(Fig. 3.2b). On the east wall, to the right in the figure,the superfix over Kin (the main sign) is another Kinglyph enclosed in what seems to be a bowl, a substi-tute for the upside-down Ahau head in the com-pound designating east in the Madrid Codex dia-gram. This bowl form is T183 or T546, a glyphinterpreted aslak’in(east) by a number of scholars.The main sign for the west is a Kin cartouche with ahand marked with Kin as the superfix. The positionof the fingers differs from the Postclassic hand rep-resenting the western direction, but both versionsprobably signify essentially the same expressionchik’k’in.The head of the Maize God is the main sign onthe north wall (Fig. 3.2b, top). A shell is the mainsign on the south wall, perhaps the counterpart forthe compound glyph for the south seen in the Ma-drid Codex. On all four walls of the tomb, thedirections appear with a second glyph compoundshowing God C’s head as the main sign. Each wallsubstitutes a different sign as the superfix over GodC’s brow. All the superfixes incorporate an elementfrom the T168 glyph, most often used in expressionsreferring toahaw,meaning ‘‘lord.’’ The variable ele-ments all seem to represent astronomical symbols.The east has a Kin glyph (T544) and the west hasan element from the Akbal glyph (T504), meaning‘‘darkness’’ or ‘‘night,’’ suggesting that the opposi-tion of east and west is also the contrast of light anddark. On the north wall, we find the Moon glyph(T683), and on the south wall a Venus glyph. Victo-ria Bricker (1983, 1988a) concludes that these glyphsrefer to the zenith and nadir, specifically marking thelocation of the Moon near zenith and Venus at nadiron March 6,a.d.502, a date reconstructed from aCalendar Round record in the tomb. On the otherhand, the placement of the glyphs on the walls sug-gests cardinal directions, with north and south rep-resenting ‘‘sides’’ of the sky, as in some contempo-rary Maya accounts. If this is the case, the Moon maybe on the north side of the sky and Venus at thesouth side.Four faces on a Late Preclassic earflare from Po-mona evoke four directions (Fig. 3.2c). Two of thefaces depict north and south or zenith and nadir, ac-cording to Norman Hammond (1987). The Sun God(Kinich Ahau) represents the east (to the right inthe diagram), and west is marked by a deity headinfixed with an element from the Akbal (T504)glyph, suggesting the same kind of Kin-Akbal oppo-sition seen in the Rı ́o Azul tomb. Hammond rec-ognizes another variant of Kinich Ahau as north(bottom of diagram). In this case, ‘‘north’’ couldsymbolize the overhead position of the sun at noonor perhaps the seasonal zenith.

ArthurMiller (1982 : 92 – 95) interprets this as a sort of cos-mic umbilical cord, and he suggests a connectionwith a cord represented in the codices and in theTulum murals (Fig. 3.3b). He does not, however,point out that this cord is shown as the path of thesun in the codices. Madrid Codex 19 shows a sunglyph (Kin) rolling along a sky cord, and Paris Codex21 depicts the sun glyph suspended from a sky cordcolored blue-green like a vine (Fig. 3.4a – b). In thecodices, the cosmic cord seems to represent theecliptic. A related image appears in the Yucatec Mo-tul dictionary of the Colonial period, which notesthat the sun’s rays areu tab kin,‘‘the cords of thesun’’ (Thompson 1960 : 142).The ecliptical path of the Sun is represented as acotton cord in Mixtec-Puebla art. The Codex Borgia(33) shows the Sun and the Moon traveling in thesky along a white cord representing the ecliptic(Fig. 3.3a; Milbrath 1989). The Sun and planetarygods move along a similar cord in the Mixtec muralsof Mitla (Fig. 5.6h). Especially intriguing is a figurewho grabs the rope as he pulls himself out of a cleftopening in the sky band. This evokes a link with aVenus god emerging from a similar cleft and de-scending on a cord on Codex Vindobonensis 48(Fig. 5.4f; Milbrath 1988a). On Santa Rita Mound 1,murals on the east half of the north wall depict dif-ferent astronomical gods pulling themselves along acord (Quirarte 1982, fig. 21). These scenes representthe ecliptical cord guiding the Sun, the Moon, andthe planets as they move through the sky.In Postclassic Maya representations, the eclipticalcord can be colored white like a cotton thread, as inGod in the south position, indicating a possible par-allel (Fig. 4.4i).From this survey of cosmic diagrams, we see themost common forms show a quadripartite division,with the east associated with sunrise and the westwith sunset. The other two directions may be gener-ally linked with the overhead position and the un-derworld position, zenith and nadir, or the northand south sides of heaven associated with the car-dinal directions. This same variability mirrors thelack of uniformity in contemporary Maya images ofquadripartite space. Nonetheless, we can concludethat the sun defines the cosmic diagram by deter-mining the directions east and west. Colonial pe-riod diagrams of vertical space show the sun in alayered universe, but these models clearly show ele-ments of European influence. One Precolumbianmodel traces the sun’s passage through time andspace with footsteps along a path. There are a num-ber of other models for how the sun moves throughthe cosmos.CONCEPTS OF THE SUN’S MOTIONSky ropes or cords in Colonial period accounts linkheaven and earth, and it seems that the cord definesthe sun’s movement. A cord ties the womb of heavenand the womb of earth in the Popol Vuh, which re-cords the ancient creation legend of the Quiche ́ (Ed-monson 1971 : 7 – 8). The Popol Vuh also says thatthe sun’s motion defines the four quarters of the uni-verse, but they actually were set in place before thesun was created, when a cord was stretched in thesky and on earth at the time of creation (D. Tedlock1985 : 72). This cord seems to symbolize the fourcorners of the cosmos representing the extreme ho-rizon positions of the sun at the solstices.74PRECOLUMBIAN AND COLONIAL SOLAR IMAGESFIG. 3.3.a:Postclassic temple with sun disk andU-shaped moon symbols positioned overhead on white cordrepresenting ecliptic (Codex Borgia 33; after Seler 1960 –1961, 4 : 82, fig. 61).b:Late Postclassic Mural 1 of Tulum Structure 5 (Tem-ple of the Diving God) showing rayed sky band, seatedMoon Goddess in two aspects, Chac (God B), and MaizeGod all positioned on ecliptical cord ending with serpentheads; God N in his turtle aspect is in sea below (afterMiller 1982, pl. 28).c:Late Classic ceramic vessel showing two double-headed serpents with twisted bodies serving as eclipticalcord for three astronomical gods (after Quirarte 1979,fig. 1)."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"world waters emerge from caves or openings in theearth. The earth itself is visualized as a giant croco-dilian floating in water, as seen in the crocodiledraped with water lilies on Copa ́ n Altar T (Maudslay1889 –1902, 1, pl. 95). Tracing the imagery back toPreclassic Izapa, Stela 25 depicts a crocodile with acosmic tree sprouting from his body (Norman 1976,pls. 41, 42). Natural history may explain this image,for crocodilians pile up earth amid water to makemounds where they lay their eggs. Trees take rootin these mounds, forming miniature models of theearth.Other Classic Maya images refer to different ani-mals serving as modes of transport for the sun dur-ing different seasons. A modern Maya account dis-cussed in Chapter 1 tells us that the sun travelsslowly, conveyed by peccaries in the long summerdays (rainy season), whereas the winter sun movesswiftly across the sky on a deer (dry season). Theseimages of the summer and winter sun can be tracedback to the Classic Maya period, and they may referto the sun in conjunction with specific animal con-stellations (Chapter 7).We can conclude that there is considerable varietyin Maya imagery showing how the sun moves acrossthe sky. A celestial cord is connected with the sunin Colonial period accounts, and Postclassic imagesshow the sun moving along a cord. In the Classicthe Tulum murals (Fig. 3.3b), or a darker color rang-ing from blue-green to brownish-red, as in the co-dices (Fig. 3.4a – b). The cord in the Madrid Codexperforates the penises of five gods (Schele 1976 : 24).Consequently it is both a path for the sun and a con-duit for feeding blood to the sun. Indeed, blood sac-rifice is required for the sun to move, according toAztec cosmology (Dura ́ n 1971 : 179; Sahagu ́ n 1950 –1982, 7 : 8).The ecliptical cord may also appear on a Late Clas-sic black-background vase (Fig. 3.3c). Two double-headed serpents with twisted cord bodies serve asthe path for three gods. Jacinto Quirarte (1979 :103) notes that the bicephalic creature provides theground, stage, and conveyance of the sun in its jour-ney through the underworld.Another way the sun moves through the under-world seems to be expressed in a Classic period vasefrom the American Museum of Natural History thatshows a solar god (to the right) climbing a tree thatrises up from the underworld (Figs. 3.4c, 4.10d).This evokes connections with Lacando ́ n accountsof the sun passing into the underworld along theroots of a tree. A shell at the base of the tree seems tobe linked with the notion of a watery underworld,also seen among the contemporary Maya. Likewise,the underworld is connected with water in ClassicMaya vase painting (Hellmuth 1987).

A scene on Dresden Codex 42c, pre-dicting drought associated with the southern direc-tion, shows the Maize God bound up in preparationfor sacrifice, perhaps indicating his death is due todrought.The T544 Kin glyph of the Classic period placesthe quadripartite design on a diagonal axis with cut-out areas at the cardinal positions (Fig. 3.4e). Thequadripartite design of Kin glyphs evokes the cosmicdiagram, but it also resembles a four-petaled flower.The T646 Kin glyph in Classic times, a closed car-touche showing cardinally oriented double lines(Fig. 3.4f ), more closely resembles Postclassic Kinglyphs. It seems to be linguistically connected withflowers, for T646 is interpreted asnicte,meaning‘‘flower’’ (Hellmuth 1988 : 169; Stone 1995a). AnAhau glyph (T533), the day sign that is a counterpartfor the twentieth Aztec day sign ‘‘flower’’ (Xochitl),is found at the center of some Classic period T646glyphs. Although Ahau (ahaw) means ‘‘lord,’’ here itseems to be the center of a solar flower. The ChilamBalam of Tizimin refers to the ‘‘flower sun’’ (nictekin) in the year 11 Ahau (Edmonson 1982b : 72). InYucatec,nikte’(nicte) is the ‘‘flor de mayo’’ or, morespecifically, the red plumeria,Plumeria rubra(Bar-rera Va ́ squez 1980). The Chilam Balam of Chumayelrefers to the red plumeria as the flower of east (Roys1967 : 65). Although plumeria flowers have five pet-als, Thompson (1960 : 142) suggests that the Kinglyph shows a plumeria with only four petals becausefour is the number over which the Sun God rules.T646 is interchangeable with T544 in a number ofClassic period images, according to Nicholas Hell-muth (1988 : 169). However, not all the contexts areclearly solar. God H, a Venus god, sometimes has theT646 flower on his brow (Chapter 5; Taube 1992b,fig. 26b). Some T646 variants have a quatrefoil out-line and a central Mexican – style star in the center,as on House E at Palenque (Robertson 1985a, pl. 30).Perhaps these are images of the night sun or someother nocturnal symbol.The interpretation of the Kin glyph varies accord-ing to its context. Kin represents the concept of a dayperiod, the cord may take on serpentine qualities,suggesting that serpents may be equated with thepath of the sun in some contexts. More rarely, theSun God climbs up a tree in his ascent from the un-derworld. In Chapter 4, we will see that the solar godtravels in a canoe with a lunar companion, perhapsas a mode of transport through the waters of the un-derworld. Various animals also carry the sun, per-haps as representatives of constellations marking theseasons, an idea explored further in Chapter 7.THE PRECOLUMBIAN KIN GLYPHMiguel Leo ́ n-Portilla (1988 : 112) relates the sun tochronovision, ‘‘the conception of a universe in whichspace, living things, and mankind derive their realityfrom the ever-changing atmosphere ofkinh.’’K’inmeans ‘‘sun,’’ ‘‘day,’’ or ‘‘time’’ in most Mayan lan-guages (B. Tedlock 1992b : 176 –177; Vogt 1969 : 446).The Kin glyph (T544) used as an artistic motifidentifies the context as solar. Sometimes the Kinglyph represents the sun disk itself, as in Postclassicimages of the sun moving along the ecliptical cord(Fig. 3.4a – b). The Postclassic variant of T544 showsa cartouche quartered by single or double lines,most often set at right angles rather than diagonally(Fig. 3.4d, g).It is interesting to note that in the cosmic diagramof the Madrid Codex, the Postclassic Kin symbolsshow two different orientations (Fig. 3.2a). Radi-ating lines on the Kin glyph are diagonally orientedin the eastern direction, suggesting an intercardinalorientation associated with the four horizon posi-tions of the sun at the solstices. In the west, the Kinglyph has double lines on the same axis as the dir-ectional glyphs, which seem to be placed in the car-dinal directions, representing either the four sidesof heaven or the four positions of the sun over thecourse of the day (sunrise, noon, sunset, and mid-night).In glyphic writing, Kin often names the Sun God,such as the Postclassic Sun God known as ‘‘lordsun’’ (Fig. 3.4g). Kin and Cauac paired with the Tunglyph and aleaffix signifiesk’intunyaabil,meaning‘‘drought,’’ as on Dresden Codex 45c (Fig. 5.9f;Thompson 1972 : 106). The glyphs on Dresden Co-78PRECOLUMBIAN AND COLONIAL SOLAR IMAGES"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Other combinations with the Kin glyph may referto places where the sun is located. Sometimes Kin ispaired with Caban, the earth sign, probably as a ref-erence to the sun at night beneath the earth (MadridCodex 28c). When Kin and Caban appear with thesky glyph, the expression is interpreted as ‘‘sun athorizon’’ or ‘‘sunrise,’’ when the sun ‘‘divides theearth and sky’’ (Fig. 3.4h; Thompson 1960 : 172, 174,fig. 31, nos. 41–51). Heinrich Berlin (1977 : 61) notesthat the Pete ́ n Classic period version of this com-pound with a prefix of one (I.561[544] : 526) indicatesa difference of one day in distance numbers. Perhapsthis is read as a count from one sunrise to another.Sky bands in both the Postclassic and Classic Mayaperiods often depict the Kin symbol (Fig. 3.4j). Pre-vious studies of sky bands have not shown any spe-cific significance to the positioning of Kin glyphsrelative to other astronomical symbols (Carlson1988; Carlson and Landis 1985; Collea 1981). None-theless, the sky band itself does seem to allude to aspecific place in the sky at the intersection of theMilky Way and the ecliptic (Chapter 7).A Kin glyph with four radiating serpent heads onParis Codex 21 (Fig. 3.4a) evokes links with earlierprototypes at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ , Tikal, Palenque, and Yax-chila ́ n (Figs. 3.4k, 3.5i; Love 1994 : 81; Tate 1992 : 61,fig. 23). The serpent-sun combination seems to beconnected with ancestors in the Classic Maya period(see below). Taube (1994 : 234) suggests that sunsymbols surrounded by radiating serpents are solarmirrors. In Chapter 7, I explore the possibility thatthis image may allude to a specific solar position.From this survey we can see that the Kin glyph,meaning ‘‘day’’ or ‘‘sun,’’ is the paramount solarsymbol in Classic and Postclassic times. Wheneverwe see Kin, we can recognize a solar connection. Thefour-part Kin design evokes the sun’s quadripartitecosmic diagram. When oriented diagonally, the dia-gram seems to refer to the solstice extremes; whenaligned vertically, it seems to designate cardinal di-rections linked with the four sides of heaven. Kinalso alludes to a solar flower (Plumeria rubra?), anatural connection, since many flowers turn theirfaces toward the sun.THE SUN GOD IN THE COLONIALAND POSTCLASSIC PERIODSThe Colonial periodRitual of the Bacabsrefers tothe colors of the sun in the context of curing rituals.Colors mentioned include the yellow-faced sun, thered-faced sun, and the red-ringed sun (Roys 1965 :14 –15, 21). In addition, the sun is named Kin ChacAhau (‘‘sun red lord’’ or ‘‘sun great lord’’) andKinich Kakmo (sun-eye fire-macaw) in this source(Roys 1965 : 7, 10).Visual representations of the Sun God in the Co-lonial period tend to follow a European format, de-picting the sun as a rayed face. On the cave walls ofDzibiche ́ n, European-style sun disks appear along-side Ahau faces emblematic of the Katun cycle (Stone1995b : 81, 84, figs. 4.73b – c). Rayed faces also rep-resent the sun in the Chilam Balam of Chumayel(Roys 1967, figs. 8 – 9). Sometimes this manuscriptmerges a European-style sun disk with an Ahau face,as in the image of the Lord of Katun 13 Ahau (Stone1995b, fig. 4.80).The Postclassic Sun God has long been identi-fied as God G in painted screenfold books (Fig.3.5a – d). God G is represented infrequently in thecodices (Schellhas 1904 : 27 – 28). In the DresdenTHE SUN GOD IN THE COLONIAL AND POSTCLASSIC PERIODS79when used with a numeral coefficient to give a totalnumber of days in calendar records, the most com-mon usage in the Classic period (Thompson 1960,fig. 26, nos. 49 –57). The day count also has a per-sonified form represented by a profile head thatbears the Kin glyph and the features of the Sun God(Thompson 1960, fig. 27, nos. 60, 62).Kin is also a component of theveintena(month)sign Yaxkin, variously translated as ‘‘new sun,’’‘‘green sun,’’ ‘‘first sun,’’ or ‘‘dry season’’ (Fig. 3.4i;Thompson 1960 : 110). In the Postclassic period, thismonth coincided with the beginning of the dry sea-son around November. Landa represents the monthKankin with a Kin glyph (Tozzer 1941 : 164). Al-though Kin is not seen in Classic and Postclassicperiod glyphs for the month Kankin, Thompson(1960 : 113 –114) interprets Kankin as ‘‘yellow sun.’’A yellow sun may allude to the extremely dry con-ditions common in Kankin, which coincides withApril in Landa’s calendar."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"80PRECOLUMBIAN AND COLONIAL SOLAR IMAGES"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Codex, God G appears only eleven times, com-pared with fifty-two images of the young MoonGoddess (Thompson 1972 : 27). The Sun God is al-most always malignant in the codices, often beingassociated with drought or destructive lightning andstorms (Thompson 1970b : 238; 1972 : 44, 69). Evenin the imagery of God G holding T506, symbolizingmaize, the associated glyphs indicate malevolence(Fig. 3.5b; Thompson 1972 : 61).The Postclassic God G often wears a Kin glyph onhis head, or, more rarely, it is seen on his body, as onDresden Codex 11c and 22c (Fig. 3.5b). The SunGod’s name is ‘‘lord sun’’ (ahaw k’in) or ‘‘sun lord’’(k’inich ahaw) in both the Classic and Postclassic pe-riods (Fig. 3.4g; Lounsbury 1973 : 138 –139). Some-times Kin appears paired with the head of God C inexpressions that would be translated as ‘‘holy sun,’’according to recent interpretations of the God Cglyph askuorch’u(Madrid Codex 36; Taube1992b : 30).The Sun God of the codices is not a youth, forhe usually shows attributes of age such as a beardor a sunken jaw with only a few teeth remaining(Fig. 3.5a – d; Taube 1992b : 50, 52, 140; Thompson1970b : 237 – 238). In the Madrid Codex, he is asnaggletoothed old god (Fig. 3.5a). In the DresdenCodex, he seems more like a middle-aged god exceptin the eclipse table, which represents him as an oldbearded god (Fig. 3.5d). God G’s aged aspect con-trasts with the youthful appearance of the centralMexican Sun God (Fig. 3.5e; Taube 1992b : 140).God G’s beard indicates maturity, but it also repre-sents solar rays, which are referred to as ‘‘the beardof the sun’’ (mex kin) in the Motul dictionary(Thompson 1960 : 142).Sometimes the Postclassic Sun God has volutes orfangs at the corners of his mouth, a trait that goesback to the Early Classic period (Figs. 3.5c, 3.7c). Inthe Dresden Codex, he has a pegged, up-curling vo-lute on his nose and a similar one on his headdress,a trait sometimes seen on Classic period representa-tions of the Sun God (Figs. 3.5b, 3.6a, 3.7a). Occa-sionally he has the central tooth (‘‘egg tooth’’) char-acteristic of the Classic period Sun God (Figs. 3.5c,3.7c). His eyes are surrounded by a beaded volute,apparently the Postclassic insignia of ‘‘god-eye.’’Different aspects of the Sun God are associatedwith two of the four directions mentioned in Landa’sdescriptions of the New Year ceremonies, recordedshortly after the conquest (Tozzer 1941 : 144 –147).The ceremonies for Muluc years of the eastern direc-tion honor Kinich Ahau (sun-faced lord), whereasKinich Ahau Itzamna is associated with the northerndirection in Ix years.The Sun God of the Dresden Codex appears inPostclassic New Year ceremonies associated with thenorth.

This central Mexi-can Venus serpent is the counterpart of Kukulcan.The solar figure is a deified ruler known as Kakupa-cal, whose name means ‘‘fire shield.’’ Jeff Kowalski(1987 : 238) notes that Kakupacal was a local rulerwho led the Itza ́ and assumed power at Chiche ́ n Itza ́by abouta.d.866 or 869. Kukulcan, presumably aforeign ruler who came to Chiche ́ n Itza ́ from centralMexico, is the counterpart of Quetzalcoatl (Chap-ter 5). In the murals, he is surrounded by rays rep-resenting the light of Venus (Fig. 5.5h, right), andthe lintel shows him with a star glyph that representsVenus (Fig. 5.5e, next to the water-lily monster).Kakupacal bears a solar title that suggests the sun it-self was visualized as a shield of fire. Kakupacal andKukulcan may be ancestors or representatives of twolineages that ruled Chiche ́ n Itza ́ jointly in the lateninth century, one claiming descent from the Sun,the other from Venus (Milbrath 1988c).Both celestial rulers carry darts and dart throwers.Kakupacal’s darts represent solar ‘‘arrowshafts,’’ likethose representing solar rays among the Chol today(Chapter 1). And those of Kukulcan symbolize thedangerous rays Venus hurls when it first rises asthe Morning Star, as described in central Mexicanchronicles (Aveni 1980 : 150). The fact that these im-ages of the Sun and Venus are found in a structureoverlooking the Great Ball Court suggests a relation-ship to the ballplayers on the Great Ball Court. Theballplayers seem to represent two celestial teams.Turquoise mosaic collars and flower headbandson one team may evoke the Sun, whereas cross-sectioned conch shells (possibly symbolizing starpendants) on two members of the other team mayrefer to Venus as Quetzalcoatl-Kukulcan (Marquina1964, lam. 266).Ball-game reliefs from the Pacific Slope of Guate-mala, roughly contemporary with those of the GreatBall Court complex at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ , show a similarinterest in astronomical imagery. El Castillo Monu-ment 1, probably dating to the Terminal Classic pe-riod, shows a ballplayer climbing up a celestial cordlined with teeth that serve as a stairway to a Sun God,surrounded by a solar disk with pointed rays, one ofthe earliest known examples of this type of sun diskhuman hearts, probably an offering to the sunmuch like the hearts offered to the sun in Aztecaccounts. God G is similarly associated with thenorthern direction in the sequence of twenty deitiesin the Dresden Codex Venus table (Kelley 1976,fig. 28).From this brief survey we see that the PostclassicSun God known as God G is rare in the codices.Many of his manifestations are aged, showing abeard and a snaggletoothed jaw. Sometimes he hasfangs and a volute on his Roman nose. His eyes areusually framed by a beaded volute. When God G hasa directional aspect, he is most often linked with thenorth. His name glyph designates him as ‘‘lord sun,’’a name still found among the Maya today. Colonialperiod imagery represents a radical transformationof the Sun God into a European image of a roundrayed face, but a link with Kinich Ahau is maintainedin some contexts.THE SUN GOD AT CHICHE ́N ITZA ́Images at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ depict a solar deity framedby a central Mexican – style sun disk with pointedrays, like that in Mixteca-Puebla codices and murals(Fig. 3.5e – i; Thompson 1970a : 473). Many of thesescenes blend central Mexican elements with Mayatraits typical of the Terminal Classic Maya period,froma.d.800 to 1000. In the Upper Temple of theJaguars, central Mexican sun disks frame solar fig-ures armed with darts and anatlatl,a dart throwercommon in central Mexico (Figs. 3.5g, 5.5e; Tozzer1957 : 120). Taube (1992b : 142; 1994 : 224) points outthat this solar warrior has the costume and regaliaof Terminal Classic Maya kings, but he also resem-bles Tonatiuh, the Late Postclassic Sun God of cen-tral Mexico, sharing the rayed sun disk and eventhe yellow hair in some cases (Figs. 3.5e, 5.5h). Nodoubt the yellow hair alludes to the yellow orb ofthe sun.Images at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ pair the solar warrior witha feathered serpent (Fig. 5.5e, h). Miller (1977 : 220)originally identified them as historical figures, nam-ing them Captain Sun Disk and Captain Serpent.Subsequently, Coggins (1984 : 160 –161) identifiedCaptain Sun Disk as a Maya ruler who met his defeat82PRECOLUMBIAN AND COLONIAL SOLAR IMAGES"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"(Fig. 3.5j; Parsons 1969, pl. 59a; Taube 1992b : 140).The ballplayer’s speech scroll indicates that he praysor sings to the Sun God. The Sun God wears a flowerheadband, an appropriate solar motif, and a tall matheaddress. The mat probably symbolizes the sun’srole as a ruler, for it is a headdress worn by a numberof Maya rulers, and the mat itself is the ruler’s throneamong the Aztecs. To be seated upon the mat was anAztec metaphor for accession to the throne (Heyden1985 : 149 –150). A mat headdress also characterizesthe Sun God on Bilbao Monument 3 (Parsons 1969,pl. 32a). He is similarly positioned on high, but herehis solar orb has undulating rays of fire. A ballplayeroffers him a human heart, a practice reminiscent ofPostclassic Aztec offerings to the Sun God.In sum, the style of sun disk prominent in solarimagery at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ reflects a link with centralMexico. Connections with the Pacific Slope are seenin an association with the ball game; however, thesolar images at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ also may be closely af-filiated with politics. The solar imagery associatedwith Kakupacal is part of a widespread tradition inMesoamerica linking the ruler to a solar lineage oridentifying the ruler himself as a ‘‘sun king.’’THE SUN KINGSolar cartouches at Tikal, Palenque, and Yaxchila ́n,often referred to as ancestor cartouches, resemblethe sun-disk figures in the images at Chiche ́ n Itza ́.In the eastern gallery of Palenque House A, thirteenblue medallions probably originally represented so-lar cartouches framing ancestor figures. One well-preserved example has a Kin sign surrounded by fourskeletal snakes, sometimes referred to as snaggle-toothed dragons (Fig. 3.4k). This serpent-sun com-bination may have a specific seasonal significance(Chapter 7). Similarly, the west facade of Structure10L-29 at Copa ́ n represents a giant Kin glyph withfour radiating serpent heads (Andrews and Fash1992, fig. 10). Tikal Stela 5 depicts a Late Classic rulerwearing a backrack that bears a solar cartouche re-sembling T646, but with the corners cut back toaccommodate four radiating serpents with scrollsnouts (Jones 1977, fig. 13).Classic period dynastic sculptures from the Mayaarea frequently allude to the Sun God in some way.Sometimes the ruler holds the Sun God or variouslywears his attributes. Floyd Lounsbury (1985 : 47 – 49;1991 : 817) points out that many Maya rulers at Pal-enque carry the titlemah k’ina,an integral part ofthe name for the Palenque solar god known as GIII.He suggests that this title can be read as ‘‘great sun.’’Events in the lives of Palenque rulers can be con-nected with solar events. Pacal’s birthday (3/22 /603N.S.) coincided with the spring equinox (Lounsbury1991 : 818). Chan Bahlum’s heir-designation eventfell only a few days before the summer solstice. An-other ceremony followed five days later on the sum-mer solstice, leading Schele to suggest that the heirto the throne ‘‘became the sun’’ around the time ofthe summer solstice (Lounsbury 1989 : 257 n. 11;table 19.1).A solar headdress clearly links Palenque rulerswith the Sun God in House A. Chan Bahlum II, whoruled froma.d.684 to 702, appears on Pier D wear-ing a blue mosaic helmet bearing a sky band andthe head of the Sun God with Kin signs on his cheekand brow (Fig. 3.6a, right; Robertson 1985b : 20).Another ruler, possibly Pacal, wears a similar solarheaddress on Pier C (Fig. 3.6a, left).In the Temple of the Sun at Palenque, a small fig-ure stands on the back of a crouched god with a Ro-man nose, a mirror brow, a T-shaped tooth, and thecrossed eyes of the Sun God (Fig. 3.6b; Schele 1974 :45). The crouching solar god supports the youngruler Chan Bahlum during his heir-designationevent when he was six years old (Robertson 1991 :20 – 21). Apparently the young ruler draws his powerfrom the sun.The ruler on Copa ́ n Stela A (Fig. 3.6c, Pl. 20)is surrounded by figures of the Sun God. Claude-Franc ̧ ois Baudez (1985, 1986) points out that thisruler takes the role of a ‘‘sun king.’’ Variously re-ferred to as 18 Rabbit, 18 Jog, or Waxaklahun UbahK’awil, this ruler’s name glyph is actually a short-eared rodent paired with the number 18. TatianaProskouriakoff (1993 : 127 –128) finds the text diffi-cult to decipher, and identifies only the emblemglyphs, cardinal directions, the name 18 Jog, and thedates. On the other hand, Elizabeth Newsome (1991 :279 – 281, 330) concludes that the text makes anTHE SUN KING83"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"extensive reference to the apotheosis of Butz’ Chan,a deceased ruler who bears the name of the Sun Godin the texts. She notes that the imagery of the deadruler’s apotheosis as the Sun God recalls a solar an-cestor depicted on Tikal Stela 31 (Fig. 3.7a). Perhapsthe royal lineages at Copa ́ n and Tikal traced their an-cestry to the sun or a solar ruler.At Copa ́ n, the ruler Mat Head is named with asolar portrait: a conventional Sun God face with Kincheek markings, crossed eyes, and fangs at the cor-ners of the mouth. According to William Fash (1991,fig. 37), his name is Popol Hol K’inich, translated as‘‘Mat Head, Fire Eye.’’ An alternate name would be‘‘Mat Head, Sun Eye.’’ The links between the sunand the ruler’s mat are clearly part of a metaphor forsolar rulership. Another solar metaphor is seen onStela 63, where Mat Head’s title incorporates a headof the Hun Ahau Headband Twin, a god of the un-derworld sun and the Morning Star (see below). Thistitle is translated as Izt’at Ahau, meaning ‘‘man ofletters lord’’ (Fash 1991, fig. 3.7).Early explorers named a zoomorph from Copa ́nAltar U, but it may actually have been a solar throne(Fig. 3.7i). David Stuart (1986) interprets Altar U asa throne or pedestal, and he suggests that the textsmentioning a sun-eyed stone refer to the name ofthe throne itself. The text links the throne to YaxPac’s accession (Schele 1986). Apparently, his seat ofpower was a solar throne. The throne depicts a jaw-less zoomorph with Kin eyes and Ahau pupils; araised snout bearing a row of three teeth; and anelongated, cross-hatched forehead ornament resem-bling bound reeds or a rolled mat, evoking the royalmat as a throne. Schele (1992b : 54) notes that AltarU is literally a ‘‘sun-eyed throne-stone,’’ a play onwords linking the termk’inich(sun-eye) to Kin sym-bols in the eyes of the throne zoomorph.A giant jaguar protector looms over a Late Classicruler with a Sun God headdress on Lintel 3 fromTemple I at Tikal (Fig. 3.6d). Temple I is the ruler’sfunerary monument, and it seems likely that Lintel 3represents his apotheosis as the Sun God under theprotection of the Water-lily Jaguar. Originally knownas Ruler A, this ruler’s name is now read as HasawKan K’awil I (Coggins 1975 : 450 – 451; Schele andMathews 1998 : 320).An ancestral ruler may be apotheosized as the SunGod on the Early Classic Tikal Stela 31, which bearsa dedicatory date ina.d.445 of 9.0.10.0.0 7 Ahau3 Yax. This monument has a very long text recordinga number of dates, including the inauguration dateof Curl Snout ina.d.379. Looming above StormySky (K’awil Chaan), a figure with features of the SunGod wears a headdress personifying Curl Snout (YaxAin I), Stormy Sky’s father (Fig. 3.7a – b; Coggins1980 : 186; Taube 1992b : 55). The floating face lacksKin markings, but it has the Roman nose and squinteyes of the Classic Maya Sun God, as well as a sharplyupturning nose ornament sometimes seen on Post-classic images of the Sun God (Fig. 3.5b). The Ley-den Plaque, probably from Tikal, represents an EarlyClassic image of the Sun God dating toa.d.320(Pl. 2). It depicts a ruler known as Moon Zero Birdholding a double-headed serpent that bears Kawil(God K) and the Sun God with all his diagnostictraits, including the Kin sign.We can conclude that solar rulers are especiallycommon in the Classic period. At sites like Palenqueand Copa ́ n, the living ruler is identified with the sun.Dead rulers were also linked with the sun, a patternFIG. 3.6.a: Left,Youthful Sun God on mosaic helmetworn by ruler (Pacal?) on Pier C;right,Chan Bahlum IIon Pier D wears mosaic helmet bearing sky band that endsin monstrous head of Sun God with Kin signs on hischeek and brow (House A, Palenque Palace; after Robert-son 1985b, figs. 38, 70).b: Left,mirror-browed solar deity with spotted cheekserves as base for young Chan Bahlum;right,adult ChanBahlum holds God K;center,Jaguar War God shield (LateClassic Temple of Sun, Palenque; after Robertson 1991,fig. 95).c:Ruler known as 18 Rabbit carries serpent bar withfigures of Sun God on Late Classic Copa ́ n Stela A (afterdrawing by A.

Clearlythe Maya had lineages connected with the sun, andthe king himself, living or dead, could embody the‘‘sun king.’’CLASSIC MAYA IMAGES OF THESUN GOD AND EARLIER PROTOTYPESIn Maya imagery from the Classic period, the SunGod is characterized by a Kin glyph, a Roman nose,and a central notched or T-shaped tooth, some-times described as an egg tooth (Fig. 3.7c; Thompson1960 : 142; 1970b : 236; Hammond 1987 : 13). The SunGod is also characterized by crossed eyes (squinteyes), a sign of beauty among the Maya (Tozzer1941 : 88). The Sun God invariably wears male cloth-ing when his full figure is shown.The Sun God is represented with a number oftraits that can be traced from the Postclassic all theway back to the Preclassic epoch, indicating conti-nuity in both form and meaning (Taube 1992b : 56).An upturned volute in the nasal area and Kin mark-ings are seen on both early and late images of the SunGod (Figs. 3.5b, 3.6a).The epigraphic head variants of the number four(T1010) are the clearest and most consistent repre-sentation of the Sun God in the Classic period(Taube 1992b : 52). The Sun God as the personifiednumber four often has his brow or cheek infixedwith a Kin glyph or, more rarely, with a mirror(Fig. 3.7f; Thompson 1960 : 133). T1010 is a portraitof the Sun God used interchangeably with Kin toenumerate the number of days in Initial Series in-scriptions, in the name for the month Yaxkin, andin representations of the number four (Lounsbury1985 : 47 – 49, fig. 2). This solar-deity name is one ofa number of different head forms of the Kin glyph(Thompson 1960, fig. 27).The Sun God as the head variant of the numberfour on Yaxchila ́ n Lintel 48 is especially intriguing(Fig. 3.7d). Although he lacks Kin markings, hiscentral tooth is characteristic of the Sun God, as ishis role as the god of the number four. He wears aheadband with an Ahau sign and a Jester God, sonamed because his headdress looks like a floppycourt jester’s hat. The Jester God may be the coun-terpart of a jade mask found on the headdress ofTonatiuh, the central Mexican Sun God (Fig. 3.5e;Taube 1994 : 224). He has cheek spots and mouthvolutes seen on a number of solar deities.Some images of the Sun God have cheek spotsgrouped in sets of three, often interpreted as jaguarCLASSIC MAYA IMAGES AND EARLIER PROTOTYPES87FIG. 3.7.a:Ancestral ruler known as Curl Nose apotheo-sized as Sun God (detail of Early Classic Tikal Stela 31;after A.

As notedearlier, Pier D depicts a Sun God mounted on asky band attached to a mosaic helmet crowned bytwin Jester Gods (Fig. 3.6a, right). He has crossedeyes and square pupils, a Kin brow and cheek, anotched central tooth, and a volute at the corner ofhis mouth — all traits that resemble the aged SunGod of the codices. The Sun God on Piers C and Ehas the same crossed eyes and central tooth but lacksthe Kin infix and monstrous features (Fig. 3.6a, left).Robertson recognizes this figure as the youthful vari-ant of the Sun God, and the one on Pier D as theaged Sun God.Thompson (1970b : 237) also identifies the Kin-marked Sun God as aged, noting that he takes therole of Kin, whereas the youthful Sun God substi-tutes for Ahau. Most personified Ahau variants arenow recognized as the spotted Headband Twin, thecounterpart of Hunahpu in the Popol Vuh (Fig.3.10h – i; Coe 1989). In rare instances, the T1010Kin-marked Sun God represents the day sign Ahau(Fig. 3.8b; Lounsbury 1985). Although a number ofscholars have identified the Kin-marked Sun God asaged, the only glyphic aspect of the Sun God to showobvious signs of age is the personified G9, one of theNine Lords of the Night characterized by a sunkenface with lines around the mouth (Fig. 3.7g; Thomp-son 1960 : 210, fig. 34, nos. 46 –57). Thompson iden-tifies G9 as the night sun, based on comparisons withthe nine ‘‘lords of the night’’ in central Mexico; how-ever, his presumed counterpart (Xochipilli) is not anaged deity. Berlin (1977 : 66) notes that representa-tions of G9 are frequently associated with the end ofthe Tun, a period that approximates the solar year.This being the case, G9 may represent the sun grow-ing old at year end. Alternatively, his aged featurescould suggest that the sun grows old each night, abelief recorded among the Aztecs (Sahagu ́ n 1950 –1982, 1 : 82).Some images at Palenque have been interpreted asthe Sun God wearing a mirror sign like the glyphT617a (Fig. 3.8a; Schele and J. Miller 1983 : 20). Thisvariant of the Sun God lacks the Kin sign but has thetypical solar eye form, a mouth with a T-shaped cen-tral tooth, and volutes at the corners of the mouth.spots, based on the markings characteristic of theday sign Ix, traditionally interpreted as representingthe skin or ear of a jaguar (Thompson 1960 : 89).Cheek spots appear on the Kin-marked Sun God inan Early Classic mural from Rı ́o Azul (Fig. 3.7c).The Sun God has spotted cheeks in glyphic texts onthe Early Classic Tikal ball-court marker, dating toa.d.378 (Fialko 1988a). The Sun God climbing theworld tree on a Late Classic vessel at the AmericanMuseum of Natural History also has spotted cheeks(Fig. 3.4c). The solar god representing Curl Snout onTikal Stela 31, discussed earlier, has similar cheekspots (Fig. 3.7a).On Yaxchila ́ n Lintel 48, the solar god representingthe head variant of the number four has spots highon his cheek, whereas his jaguar companion (YaxBalam), representing the personification of num-ber nine, has jaguar spots around the mouth (Fig.3.7d – e). This distinction suggests that the solarcheek spots may not be jaguar spots. In murals onthe walls of the Naj Tunich cave, these spots aredeath markings indicating an underworld aspect.The spotted Headband Twin wears a cluster of threeor four spots on the cheek, apparently replacing thesingle death spot more commonly seen on this deity(Fig. 3.10j; Stone 1995b : 149, fig. 6.43). Three cheekspots are also seen on the monkey variant of the full-figure Kin glyph (Coe 1978a, fig. 16). These clustereddeath spots are not limited to the Sun God, and arealso seen on a Venus god known as GI, freely sub-stituting for a single death spot on the cheek(Fig. 5.10h – i; Chapter 5).Having established some general traits in the im-agery of the Sun God, we can now turn to represen-tations at different sites that help to expand our un-derstanding of his solar nature. A sculptured panelon the West Court of the Palace at Palenque depictsthe Sun God, with his characteristic crossed eyes andKin brow, in a frontal pose that clearly places him ina position of prominence, for he is flanked by twoprofile heads (Fig. 3.7h). One head probably repre-sents a lunar deity wearing aposign, a glyph linkedto the moon (Chapter 4). Profile serpent masks atthe upper corners and two peccary heads may referto constellations (Chapter 7).The stucco piers of House A in the Palace at Pa-88PRECOLUMBIAN AND COLONIAL SOLAR IMAGES"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Like the solar gods already described, the mirror-browed solar deity occasionally has spotted cheekmarkings, as seen on the crouching figure support-ing Chan Bahlum in the Temple of the Sun (Fig.3.6b). Mirror markings of the Sun God evoke a linkwith a Kekchı ́ tale that says sunlight is the reflectionof a mirror in the center of the sky (Chapter 1).The sky band of Pier B in House A at Palenquedepicts a mirror-browed head with a central toothand crossed eyes that Robertson (1985b : 16, fig. 24)identifies as the Sun God. The face lacks a lower jawbut has an element trailing from the upper jaw thatRobertson identifies as a beard, which suggests linkswith the aged Sun God of the codices. She notes thatat some time in the past the color of the mirror andbeard were changed from blue to red. This is intrigu-ing because both colors relate to solar imagery butmay have had different meanings.On Yaxchila ́ n Stela 1, the Sun God positioned be-low the ruler has the classic solar features, includingtwo notched teeth forming a T-shaped central tooth,volutes at the corners of the mouth, and crossed eyeswith square pupils (Fig. 3.8c; Tate 1992 : 66). He hasKin body markings and a brow cartouche inscribedwith a Kin glyph, not visible in the drawing pub-lished by Tate (1992). According to Stuart (1988 :181), a profile figure on the sky band above the rulerrepresents another Sun God. Both solar figures weara laterally suspended pectoral with trilobe ends andcrossed bands in the middle. As will be seen, thismay be an insignia reserved exclusively for celestialluminaries and rulers playing the part of these dei-ties. The god overhead is in a profile pose that showsthe Roman nose and squint eyes typical of the SunGod, but he lacks Kin markings and he wears an un-usual skeletal headdress and has lines around themouth that give him an aged aspect. Perhaps the sunis shown in two different sky positions on Stela 1.The Sun God appears on two or three differentcosmic levels on the front of Copa ́ n Stela A (Fig.3.6c, Pl. 20; Baudez 1994 : 23). Texts on the back ofthe stela refer to the sun, the full moon, and the me-tonic cycle, which links the lunar month to the tropi-cal year (Chapter 4). The Sun God has typical fea-tures: a Kin glyph on his brow, crossed eyes withsquare pupils, and a central notched tooth. At themiddle level, a ceremonial bar held by the ruler hastwo serpent heads at either end, each bearing thehead of a Sun God. The Sun God’s face is the sameon both sides, but one has the markings for flint andthe other bears the Akbal sign (Newsome 1991 : 282 –283). Newsome points out that another pair of ser-pent heads carry underworld images of the Sun Godat the ruler’s feet. She notes that here one solar deitywears a headdress with a scroll-eyed deity with anImix glyph representing a water lily, and the otherwears a similar headdress with a trilobe element thatlinks him with Uc-Zip, the god of hunting. At thetop level of the monument, two figures holdingskeletal serpents also appear to be solar gods withKin glyphs decorating their brows, now destroyedbut visible in an early drawing published by A. P.Maudslay (1889 –1902, 1, pl. 26). The serpents on allthree levels of the stela are skeletal snakes, the samecreatures that frame the Kin sign in the ancestor car-touches at Palenque.The finest image of the Sun God from Copa ́ n ap-pears in a group of seven different celestial deitiesrepresented on a bench from Las Sepulturas, an eliteresidential area at Copa ́ n. The Sun God has a Romannose, a notched central tooth, and a Kin glyph on hisback and arms (Pl. 19). His domed forehead has acircular cartouche that probably represents a mirror.What makes this bench figure especially interestingis that he is a companion of other celestial deities,part of an assembly of astronomical gods that in-cludes the Moon God and a Venus god with a scor-pion tail (Chapter 6).Early Classic solar masks, revealed in 1992 exca-vations on the west side of Rosalila at Copa ́ n, depictthe Sun God with rectangular eyes, cross-eyed pup-ils, and three spots on each cheek. Although Kinsigns are not apparent, the deity attributes seemto fit into the solar pattern. A date on the stairs(9.6.17.3.2) indicates that the temple was commis-sioned by Moon Jaguar, the tenth ruler of Copa ́n(Agurcia and Valde ́ s 1994 : 82).Another Early Classic monumental facade atEdzna ́ has two different images of the Sun God (Be-navides 1996 : 30 – 31). Both wear large earflares thatmay represent Kin signs and both have crossed eyes,but the one on the northwest side has rectangularCLASSIC MAYA IMAGES AND EARLIER PROTOTYPES89"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"90PRECOLUMBIAN AND COLONIAL SOLAR IMAGES"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"pupils and a nose ornament, whereas the one on thenortheast side has circular pupils. Perhaps the twovariants pertain to different seasons or directions ofthe sun.Kin markings can be traced back to the Late Pre-classic period. The Sun God with a Kin sign on thecheek peers down on Stela 2 in a Late Preclassic im-age from Abaj Takalik (Taube 1992b : 55, fig. 23a).The figure wears a mat headdress like the Classic pe-riod Sun God from Bilbao, and the volute projectingfrom the face is also a trait seen on other solar gods.On Structure 5C-2nd at Cerros in Belize, a PreclassicSun God has Kin signs on his cheeks, crossed eyes,and a downturned mask below his nose (Fig. 3.8e;Schele and Freidel 1990 : 113 –114; Schele and Miller1986 : 106). Although the two heads are identical,Schele and her colleagues interpret them as the risingand setting sun. Nonetheless, the cosmic diagramsanalyzed earlier show that these two directions aredistinguished by different images. The two heads onthe upper tier of the pyramid, which Linda Scheleand David Freidel (1990, fig. 3 : 12) identify as theMorning and Evening Star, are also identical. Each iscrowned by a trefoil design interpreted as the JesterGod’s headband.The Pomona Flare discussed earlier representstwo Late Preclassic heads of the Sun God, one cer-tainly symbolizing the east and the other represent-ing either the north or the zenith (Fig. 3.2c). Thereare minor differences in the eye forms, ear plugs, andfangs that may be significant. Hammond (1987 : 13,fig. 1) says that a T60 knot in the text, associated withthe Sun God of the east, refers to the birth or ap-pearance of the sun in the east, being read as*jo:k’,‘‘to appear,’’ here substituting for the T740 birthglyph. He notes that the head representing the northor zenith position is associated with the numberfour, reinforcing the role of the Sun God as patronof the number four. This variant of the Sun Godappears with a T301 footprint indicating a clock-wise movement, the same footprint used with theMaize God and the number eight in the south ornadir position.There are few known images of the Sun Godon Classic Maya vase paintings. A polychrome vaseshows Kinich Ahau wearing Kin body markings anda headband, a diagnostic element of a number of as-tronomical deities (Fig. 3.8d). The Vase of the SevenGods depicts what seems to be a previously unrecog-nized representation of the Sun God (Pl. 7). The fig-ure on the lower left is a male with a Roman nose,rectangular crossed eyes, and a central T-shapedtooth. He may originally have had a Kin glyph on thebrow that was destroyed by a break in that area, vis-ible in early photographs but not in the drawingpublished by Michael Coe (1973, no. 49).A Protoclassic image of the Sun God appears on astone vessel carved with two ‘‘swimming’’ figures(Coe 1973, no. 2). One of the swimmers has a sunglyph in an open hand on his headdress; his centraltooth and the volute at the corner of the mouthare appropriate to a solar deity. His rectangular eyehas a paw-wing design instead of the cross-eyedpupils typical of the Sun God. The paw-wing designprovides a bridge to Preclassic Olmec iconography,where this form is seen on headdresses and thronesas early as 1200b.c.(Joralemon 1971, figs. 101, 192,194; Milbrath 1979 : 16, table 2, figs. 42 – 43).In sum, the Classic Maya worshiped a masculineSun God, following the predominant pattern seenamong the Maya today. Continuity in solar imageryover time is evident from the fact that the Kin-FIG. 3.8.a:Late Classic Sun God with mirror glyph(T617a) on brow, symbolizing sun as ‘‘day’’ mirror (afterSchele and Miller 1983, fig. 3f ).b:Sun God with central tooth and fangs as Late ClassicAhau variant (Temple XVII, Palenque; after Lounsbury1985, fig. 4d).c:At base, Sun God with Kin brow holds skeletal ser-pent; overhead double-headed sky serpent has God K inits jaws (Late Classic Yaxchila ́ n Stela 1; modified after Tate1992, fig. 124).d:Sun God Kinich Ahau wearing Kin body markingsand headband of Headband Twins (Late Classic vase; afterTaube 1992b, fig. 22g).e:Sun God with Kin signs on cheeks, crossed eyes, anddownturned mouth (Preclassic Structure 5C-2nd at Ce-rros, Belize; after Schele and Freidel 1990, fig. 3 : 12).CLASSIC MAYA IMAGES AND EARLIER PROTOTYPES91"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"notes that some full-figure variants of this formclearly overlap with the imagery of the monkeyscribes on Classic Maya vase painting (Fig. 3.9e).A Yaxchila ́ n Kin variant with monkey features isespecially intriguing (Fig. 3.9a). Originally describedas a spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) by Coe (1978a :346), this monkey is identified as a capuchin mon-key (Cebus capucinus) by Mary Baker (1992 : 219,225), an interpretation that remains controversialbecause this species of monkey is not found in theMaya lowlands. Many Kin variants are especially dif-ficult to identify in terms of species, although theirsimian aspect is clear (Fig. 3.9c).It seems these Kin variants are not the sun itself,but relate to the passage of time counted by the sun.It is not known at what point the Classic Maya nor-mally started counting a new day, but it may havebeen at sunrise or at midday, as among the Aztecs(Codex Telleriano-Remensis, fol. 48; Thompson1960 : 177). The Kin-variant monkey may representa count of days beginning at dusk, the time that themonkey’s sun shines, according to the Tzotzil Maya.They say that when the sun disappears at sunset,there is a red glow of sunset called the ‘‘monkey’ssun’’ (Laughlin 1977 : 253; Laughlin and Karasik1988 : 249). This long-tailed monkey (max) is clearlydistinguished from a howler monkey (batz’). It maybe a spider monkey, noted for its long tail and a colorthat sometimes has a red quality. Another Tzotzilimage of dusk is‘ik-‘mach’an,meaning ‘‘black mon-key’s face’’ (Laughlin 1975 : 57).Monkey scribes, an important theme in Mayamarked body identifies the Sun God over a span ofmore than a thousand years. Classic and Protoclassicimages of the Sun God sometimes have Kin mark-ings and volutes at the corners of the mouth, likePostclassic images of the Sun God. Although theKin-marked Sun God has been interpreted as aged,the only Classic period solar deity who consistentlyshows signs of age is the Lord of the Night (G9), rep-resenting either the old sun at dusk or the sun at yearend. The Classic Maya Sun God with Kin markingshas crossed eyes, a sign of beauty. Sometimes he hasspots on his cheeks, often identified as jaguar mark-ings that indicate a nocturnal aspect, but these spotsmay actually be death spots showing an associationwith the underworld, similarly indicating a noctur-nal aspect. Apparently the death and rebirth of thesun take place in the darkness of the underworld.Another group of Classic period solar deities have amirror brow, a metaphor for a shiny quality appar-ently expressing the solar rays.THE MONKEY’S SUNDavid Stuart (1988 : 201) recognizes a simian aspectof the sun, but he notes that the monkey face inMaya art never has Kin markings, and it does notsubstitute for the Sun God in inscriptions. The onlyclear substitution is seen in Kin variants representingmonkeys, but these are not marked with Kin glyphs(Fig. 3.9a – c). Coe (1978a : 341, fig. 16) suggests thatall personified Kin variants that are not clearly theSun God are in fact a Monkey-Man god, and he92PRECOLUMBIAN AND COLONIAL SOLAR IMAGESFIG. 3.9.a:Full-figure Kin glyph representing mon-key (Late Classic Yaxchila ́ n Lintel 48; after Tate 1992,fig. 62).b:God of Zero holding skeletal snake alongside full-figure Kin glyph representing howler monkey with starglyph on ear (Late Classic Copa ́ n Stela D; after Coe 1978a,fig. 15).c:Monkey Kin variants of Classic period are not char-acterized by Kin markings; possibly they refer to count ofdays initiated after sunset or before sunrise (after Coe1978, fig. 13).d:Throne figure with face of Sun God and lips of LordT231 (Late Classic Tablet of Slaves at Palenque; afterSchele 1991b, fig. 1).e:Howler-monkey artists as pair (Late Classic vase; af-ter Coe 1978b, fig. 10).f:Late Postclassic Sun God with macaw headdress andmacaw title (Madrid Codex page 89a; after Villacorta andVillacorta 1977).g:(1)–(5): Glyphs naming GIII of Palenque Triad rep-resent specialized form of Classic Maya Sun God (afterLounsbury 1985, figs. 2a – e).

The monkey imagery will be analyzedfurther in relation to specific planets in Chapter 6.SOLAR BIRDS AND SOLAR FIREThe hummingbird is an avian aspect of the sunamong the Maya. With their iridescent feathers,these small birds look like glints of sunlight as theydart back and forth (Benson 1997 : 77 –78). Hum-mingbirds are especially attracted to flowers of redcolor, a color that evokes the sun. Thompson (1939;1970a : 368) first recognized that the Gann vase, aClassic period (Tepeu 2) pot from Yalloch, repre-sents a Maya tale about the Sun God in a humming-bird disguise. Subsequently, Hammond (1985) iden-tified a number of Classic Maya vessels that seem toshow aspects of the sun’s transformation into a hum-mingbird. Among the Aztecs, the aggressive qualitiesof the hummingbird apparently suggested a naturalconnection with the solar warrior, Huitzilopochtli(Benson 1989). Huitzilopochtli, whose name means‘‘hummingbird of the south’’ (the left hand of thesun), is a solar god who is reborn each November atthe beginning of the dry season, when the sun is inthe southern sky (Milbrath 1980a).The Yucatec Maya worshiped the macaw as an im-age of the sun called Kinich Kakmo (‘‘sun-faced firemacaw’’ or ‘‘sun-eyed fire macaw’’). Colonial periodaccounts, most notably Diego Lo ́ pez de Cogolludo’s(1954), tell us that the Sun God of Izamal (KinichKakmo) was a macaw who descended with the fieryrays of the sun at noon to consume the offeringsmade by people suffering from illness, especiallypestilence. Today the Yucatec Maya pray to the sunat noon for healing, suggesting comparison withprayers to Kinich Kakmo. And the noon sun is the‘‘fire’’ sun among the Lacando ́ n, the same link we seebetween fire and the noonday sun in the imagery ofKinich Kakmo. The termkak(fire) orkakal(fiery),often used in contemporary Maya names for thesun, reinforces the imagery of solar fire (Thompson1970b : 236).Macaws are certainly appropriate solar symbols,being diurnal animals that are quite noisy at day-break. They can be seen in treetops as the sun risesvase painting, are characterized by a deerlike ‘‘extraear,’’ and some have a cluster of three spots on thecheek, reminiscent of certain images of the Sun Godand the Venus god known as GI (Figs. 3.9e, 5.10i).The monkey-man scribes may be related to the olderbrothers of the Hero Twins in the Popol Vuh, whowere transformed into monkeys by the Hero Twins.One of the two brothers (Hun Batz) has a namelinked with the howler monkey; the other (HunChouen) may also be a howler monkey (D. Tedlock1985 : 353). Indeed, some of the monkey scribes arerepresented with the beards characteristic of malehowlers (Fig. 3.9e, left; Coe 1978a : 346). Coe (1978a :342 – 345) notes that Venus is involved in the im-agery because the same Monkey-Man god with anextra ‘‘deer ear’’ appears as one of the manifesta-tions of the Morning Star on Dresden Codex 48b(Fig. 5.3c, center). This aspect of the Morning Starseems to be a howler monkey, characterized by a flatface, prominent teeth, and a beard.A throne figure on the Tablet of the Slaves at Pa-lenque may represent a howler-monkey deity with asolar aspect (Fig. 3.9d). The throne figure has theface of the Sun God and the lips of Lord T231, ac-cording to William Ringle and Thomas Smith-Stark(1996 : 55). In glyphic expressions, T231 is most of-ten identified as the howler monkey (batz’;Kurb-juhn 1989 : 42).As noted earlier, the Pomona Flare links a monkeywith the west, the place of sunset, evoking the sunsetglow of the Tzotzil ‘‘monkey’s sun’’ embodied by along-tailed monkey that may be a spider monkey.The Lacando ́ n link the Sun with a spider monkeyand the moon with a howler monkey (Chapter 1). Inother Maya tales, the spider monkey takes the role ofa planet. In Mopan Maya accounts of three celestialbrothers, the Sun’s youngest brother is transformedinto a spider monkey, variously identified as Mars,Jupiter, or Venus (Chapter 1).We can conclude that monkeys are connectedwith the sun, but they do not seem to be the sunitself. As Kin substitutes, monkeys may signal acount of nights. Howler monkeys may be connectedwith the Morning Star visible before dawn. Similarly,the spider monkey may take a role like the sun, butit actually seems to represent a planet, perhaps one94PRECOLUMBIAN AND COLONIAL SOLAR IMAGES"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"overhead. At dusk they gather and fly around incircles before retiring for the night; thus their activi-ties seem to mirror those of the sun. Tozzer (1941: n.689, 904) identifies Kinich Kakmo as theAra macao(the scarlet macaw), predominantly red in color,with yellow and blue on its wings. Red evokes thefiery rays of the sun, yellow the sun itself, and bluethe daytime sky.Kinich Kakmo, a solar bird linked with one of thefounders of Izamal, is mentioned repeatedly in theChilam Balam of Chumayel, especially in texts de-scribing the descent of Kinich Kakmo’s shield (thesolar orb?) (Roys 1967 : 66, 82, 160, n. 2). The ma-caw aspect of the sun marks the arrival of the usurperof royal power in the Chilam Balam books (Leo ́n-Portilla 1988 : 30). The divine macaw plays a bene-ficial role by bringing maize to humankind (Roys1967 : 111–112; Thompson 1960 : 86). This echoesthe close connection between maize and the sunamong the Maya today.The Sun God wears a macaw headdress and ap-pears with a macaw title (ah kak[a] mo) in the Post-classic Madrid Codex, leading Kelley (1976 : 6) andother scholars to identify him as Kinich Kakmo(Fig. 3.9f; Fox and Justeson 1984 : 26). The solar ma-caw, bearing the glyphic name Kinich Kakmo, is rep-resented on Dresden Codex 40b with torches, ap-propriate symbols of the scorching sun (Thompson1960 : 270; 1972 : 100). Thompson notes that KinichKakmo can be traced back to the Classic period onstelae that represent the Kin glyph prefixed to themacaw head. A macaw found buried with four vul-tures at Tikal may represent the sun in a cosmic dia-gram (Benson 1997 : 88).Structure 10, associated with the Classic periodBall Court A-III at Copa ́ n, originally had sixteenmacaws (Fash 1991 : 126, pl. 80). The modernreconstruction shows the macaw with serpent-faced wings carrying an Akbal glyph surmounted bymaize. The link with maize evokes the divine macawwho brought the world maize. Akbal is a nocturnalsymbol, and it has been suggested that the macawrepresents the sun in the underworld, a role appro-priate to ball-game imagery (Kowalski and Fash1991 : 65).Thompson (1960 : 167) suggests that some birdvariants of the Kin glyph may represent an eagle. Al-though common in Aztec iconography, the image ofthe sun as an eagle seems to be rare in Maya iconog-raphy. The connection between the eagle and the sunmay be because the eagle seems to soar toward thesun and is able to look directly at the sun, a trait thatwas noted by Sahagu ́ n’s Aztec informants (Benson1997 : 79).We can conclude that birds most commonlylinked with the sun are the hummingbird and themacaw. The macaw may be a solar bird not only be-cause of its color, which suggests solar fire, but alsobecause it tends to fly out of its rookery around dawnand return at dusk. The macaw sun, linked with thenoonday sun, can cause illness, just as the noon sunis connected with illness among the modern Maya.Another solar bird, the hummingbird, symbolizesboth glinting sunlight and a connection between thesun and flowers.THE SUN AND FELINESThe puma has a golden coat and is active primarilyin the daytime, like the sun. In fact, the solar felineof central Mexico is clearly a puma. The solar pumacan be seen in a puma with a crown of solar raysat Teotihuaca ́ n (Miller 1973, fig. 289). The Sun Godsits with a puma on a throne in the Codex Laud (14),a codex that blends central Mexican and Mayantraits. The solar symbolism of pumas may have ex-tended into the Maya area. Just as the sun has higherstatus than the moon in contemporary Maya ac-counts, the Tzotzil give the puma higher status thanthe jaguar (Braakhuis 1987 : 247).A puma aspect of the sun may appear on a ClassicMaya vase (Fig. 3.11c). H. E. M. Braakhuis (1987)interprets a puma head attached to a deer body as apuma disguised as a deer, evoking the deer disguiseof the sun in a contemporary Maya tale about themoon’s adultery with King Vulture. He points outthat the vase seems to show a sequence of actionsrelated to Landa’s month Pax, the month that honorswarriors and a puma god probably representing thesun as a war leader.Feline thrones are quite common in Maya im-agery, and many thrones clearly show a spotted jag-THE SUN AND FELINES95"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"moon as the ‘‘jaguar sun’’ (Chapter 4). The Sun Goddecapitates the moon during a lunar eclipse in thelegend of Coyolxauhqui in central Mexico (Milbrath1995a, 1997).We can conclude that there is some link betweenjaguars and solar imagery in the Maya area, but wecannot be sure the jaguar represents the sun. Indeed,Chapter 4 presents evidence that certain jaguar dei-ties represent the moon. In some cases, the solar fe-line seems to be a puma. The Maya probably notedthat the golden color and diurnal cycle of the pumawas analogous to the sun, just as the nocturnal traitsof the jaguar and its coat spotted as if by stars evokedthe moon and the night.HUNAHPU AND HUN AHAUHunahpu is the twin who becomes the sun at the endof the story of the Hero Twins in the Popol Vuh. Heand his brother, Xbalanque, play ball with the lordsof the underworld, and when the Hero Twins die,they are resurrected as the sun and the moon (D.Tedlock 1985 : 160). Coe (1989 : 180) points out thatHunahpu and Xbalanque are always mentioned inthat order, and because the sun is mentioned beforethe moon in the description of the celestial transfor-mation, it is reasonable to suppose that Hunahpu isthe sun and Xbalanque the moon. The order of theseevents, with the sun transformed before the moon,is the same as in Aztec legends (Sahagu ́ n 1950 –1982,7 : 6). Clearly, the Hero Twins are ballplayers repre-senting the sun and the moon in a celestial ballgame. At several points in the tale, they decapitateeach other in the underworld, a type of imagery thatsuggests eclipse cycles (Chapter 4).Thompson (1960 : 77, 87 – 89, 219, fig. 11, nos.17 – 29; 1970b : 234, 237, 367, 368) suggests conflict-ing identities for Hunahpu. The Popol Vuh says thatHunahpu and Xbalanque were transformed into thesun and the moon, but does not say which is which.This uncertainty allows Thompson to suggest thatHunahpu was transformed into the moon, an opin-ion not shared by other scholars. He sees this patternof a male moon as the result of Postclassic centralMexican influence, and he suggests that Hunahpuwas originally the Morning Star in Classic Mayauar pelt covering the throne (Fig. 3.11c, Pls. 5, 7, 17).At Palenque, the Palace Oval Tablet shows Pacal re-ceiving his crown on a throne representing a felinewith two heads (Robertson 1985a, fig. 91). Althoughspots are not represented, the head ornamentsclearly designate the Water-lily Jaguar. In the interiorof the Castillo pyramid at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ , archaeolo-gists found a red feline throne with jade spots and aturquoise sun disk on its back (the turquoise mosaicwas stolen in the 1960s). This suggests that otherfeline thrones at the site may be jaguars, such as thethrone supporting the solar ruler in two templesof the Great Ball Court complex at Chiche ́ n Itza ́(Fig. 3.5g – h). In these temples, however, we cannotbe sure whether a puma or a jaguar is intended. Andeven when the throne bears jaguar skin, the signifi-cance can be lunar, as in the case of the thronemarked withpo(moon) markings that supports GodD on a Late Classic Maya vase (Fig. 3.11c).Scholars often identify the jaguar as an alter egoof the sun, but research presented here and in Chap-ter 4 indicates that the jaguar is more commonly anaspect of the moon. The jaguar is nocturnal and likesto swim and fish, thus it is naturally linked with themoon and the watery underworld. Thompson (1960 :11, 107, 135) developed the now widely accepted no-tion that the sun at night is a jaguar associated withthe underworld. His strongest evidence for this as-sociation comes from the Kekchı ́, who say that thesun isxbalamque(jaguar sun), but there seems tobe no mention of a link with the night or the sun inthe underworld (Thompson 1967 : 32). Furthermore,the same name may be applied to a manifestationof the moon among the Quiche ́ (Chapter 4; D. Ted-lock 1985 : 368 – 369). Another reason for ascribing ajaguar nature to the Sun God are the spots on hischeek, interpreted as jaguar markings (see Taube1992b). However, the discussion presented above in-dicates that they are probably death spots (compareFig. 3.10e, f, j, k).A Preclassic relief from Chalchuapa depicts theKin-marked Sun God holding a decapitated headthat may represent a jaguar (Taube 1992b, fig. 23e).Here it is the Sun God who is the decapitator and thejaguar is his victim. Rather than being a solar sym-bol, the decapitated jaguar head may symbolize the96PRECOLUMBIAN AND COLONIAL SOLAR IMAGES"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"times. He notes that Ahau, meaning ‘‘lord’’ in anumber of Mayan languages, is connected with theyoung Sun God, but when it occurs with the numberone, it becomeshun ahaw(Hun Ahau) in the low-lands, the counterpart ofhun ahpuamong theQuiche ́ in the highlands, a name linked with theMorning Star. Thompson is clearly inconsistent, forhe also identifies Hunahpu as the youthful Sun God,noting that the personified Ahau head is almost cer-tainly Hunahpu as the young Sun God. He bases thisin part on the fact that Ahau is the counterpart forthe central Mexican day sign ‘‘flower’’ (Xochitl), un-der the patronage of Xochipilli, the young Sun God.Xochipilli’s role as one of the Nine Lords of theNight has been interpreted as that of the night sun,in other words, an underworld sun. Hunahpu mayalso play a similar role, for the major events in thePopol Vuh take place in the underworld.The Hero Twins play a role in agricultural fertility.The twins plant maize stalks in their grandmother’shouse, saying that she should watch the plants as asign of their fate in the underworld. Later, when Hu-nahpu’s head is decapitated in the house of bats, thecreators make a false head for him, which dropsseeds when it is hit, permitting the plants to sprout.The Hero Twins take the role of hunters at severalpoints in the tale, the best known being an episodewhen they shoot down Vucub Caquix, a bird whowanted to be the sun.Hunmeans ‘‘one,’’ and theahpupart in Hunahpu’s name means ‘‘hunter withthe blowgun’’ or ‘‘he with the blowgun,’’ a namefor the sun, according to Thompson (1970b : 234,237). Dennis Tedlock (1985 : 341– 342) translatesHunahpu’s name as ‘‘1 Blowgunner.’’ Most scholarsidentify Hunahpu with a Precolumbian god named1 Ahau (Hun Ahau), known from both the Classicand Postclassic periods.Prior to their transformation into the Sun and theMoon, Hunahpu and his twin brother are said to‘‘control’’ the Morning Star (D. Tedlock 1985 : 342).Today the Morning Star is named Junajpu (Hu-nahpu) among the modern Quiche ́ (B. Tedlock1992a : 28; 1992b : 180). Perhaps Hunahpu symbol-izes both the Sun and the Morning Star because thetwo are intimately linked when the Morning Star an-nounces sunrise. Also, Venus and the Sun are oftenpositioned together during conjunction, an eventthat recurs about every 260 days, the same intervalfor repetitions of the day sign 1 Ahau, a day appar-ently linked with Hunahpu.Coe (1989) identifies Hun Ahau (1 Ahau) as theClassic and Postclassic counterpart of Hunahpu; andhe sees both as closely related solar beings. Taube(1992b : 115) proposes that a new designation (GodS) be used for the Postclassic god with the Hun Ahautitle. A Postclassic version of Hun Ahau, enthronedon page 50 of the Dresden Codex Venus pages, iscovered with death spots (Fig. 3.10e; Schele andMiller 1986 : 51; Taube 1992b : 117). Here Hun Ahaulacks the conventional spot on the cheek but has eyemarkings similar to the spotted Headband Twinwho represents Hun Ahau in the Classic period(Taube 1992b, fig. 61d). On Dresden Codex 2a, adeath-spotted god named Hun Ahau is bound as acaptive and decapitated, a feature also seen on a fig-ure of Hun Ahau on Dresden 3a (Fig. 3.10d; Coe1989 : 179; Taube 1992b : 115 –116). This recalls im-agery of the twins decapitating each other in thePopol Vuh, possibly an allusion to the eclipse cycle.The connection is strengthened by the fact that theHun Ahau on Dresden Codex 2a wears a ball-gamebelt, indicating that he takes the role of a ballplayerlike the Hero Twins. Taube (1992b : 116 –117) pointsout that in the Dresden Codex and in ethnohistor-ical accounts, Hun Ahau is strongly identified withdeath, sacrifice, and the underworld. Landa notesthat Hun Ahau is ‘‘Lucifer, prince of all the devils’’and ruler of Metnal, the Maya underworld (Tozzer1941 : 132). Thus Hun Ahau is a god of the under-world, apparently representing the underworld sun,closely connected with the Morning Star as the heraldof the rising sun. The same associations with deathand the underworld are seen in the Classic periodHun Ahau, for he wears death spots on his cheek.Coe (1989 : 167 –167) identifies the Classic periodHun Ahau as the spotted Headband Twin. He bearsthe name Hun Ahau (1 Ahau), written with thenumber one and the T1000 Ahau sign (Fig. 3.10f ).This T1000 variant, representing the phoneticahaw,is a head with a single large death spot on the cheek(Fig. 3.10b – c). When the T1000 head is enclosedin a cartouche, it functions as a day sign, just as aHUNAHPU AND HUN AHAU97"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"98PRECOLUMBIAN AND COLONIAL SOLAR IMAGES"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"cartouche distinguishes Ahau when it is used as a daysign (Fig. 3.10a, i; Thompson 1960, fig. 11, nos. 17 –29). There are also full-figure variants of the day signAhau with attributes of the spotted Headband Twin(Fig. 3.10h).Monumental depictions of Hun Ahau are rare.Unlike Kinich Ahau, Hun Ahau has human features,and sometimes he wears a ball-game belt, indicatinghe is a ballplayer like the Hero Twins (Fig. 3.10g).On the central ball-court marker of Copa ́ n, the ball-player on the left, named Hun Ahau, is the Classic pe-riod counterpart of Hunahpu (Schele 1987a; Scheleand Miller 1986 : 251– 252). His companion, the Godof Zero, may be a lunar deity (Chapter 4).A cave painting at Naj Tunich also represents HunAhau as a ballplayer (Fig. 3.10j). Stone (1995b : 151,fig. 6-44) suggests that Hunahpu (Hun Ahau) playswith a ball symbolizing his brother Xbalanque, be-cause the mural shows Hunahpu with a ball bearingthe number nine, evoking Xbalanque as the personi-fication of the number nine. Coe (1989 : 171) identi-fies the ballplayer as Hunahpu wearing death spotson his cheek and a straw hunter’s hat appropriate tothe role of a blowgunner. Here Hun Ahau has a clus-ter of four cheek spots that resemble the markingson his garment, which are usually interpreted as jag-uar spots but could also represent death spots, rein-forcing his role as the underworld sun, hidden in acave. The hat is linked with Hunahpu’s role as ahunter, but it also may carry a solar significance, forthe yellow straw brim could be a metaphorical imageof the solar rays surrounding his face.Tikal Stela 31 depicts the ruler Stormy Sky (K’awilChaan) in the guise of the spotted Headband Twin,Hun Ahau, according to Taube (1992b : 119), whonotes that he has Hun Ahau’s eye and mouth ele-ments, and a similar death aspect seen in the crest ofbones on his head (Fig. 3.7b). Andrea Stone (per-sonal communication 1996) points out that he bearsa death spot at the crook of his elbow. The fact thatCurl Snout appears overhead in the guise of KinichAhau confirms that Hun Ahau plays a different rolethan the Sun God, although he appears to be closelyconnected with the Sun. In this image, the ruleras Hun Ahau may be an earthly aspect of the Sunclosely linked with the Morning Star. Perhaps he isdestined to be transformed into the Sun, like his fa-ther before him. The Initial Series date (9.0.10.0.0;10/16 /445) corresponds to a time when Venus hadjust completed its retrograde and was near its maxi-mum brilliance as the Morning Star (usually reachedabout two weeks after the second stationary point).Perhaps Stormy Sky is compared to Venus at itsgreatest brilliance, second only to the Sun, payinghomage to his deified solar father.Ceramic vessels depict Hun Ahau in roles char-acteristic of the Hero Twins in the Popol Vuh. Ascene on one pot shows Hun Ahau, wearing a strawhunter’s hat, aiming his blowgun at a bird on a tree(Fig. 3.10k).

The context of the cavesuggests that Hun Ahau may be the sun about toemerge from the underworld.Hun Ahau performs bloodletting in some ceramicpaintings. On a pot from Huehuetenango, he isamong a triad of gods shown in the act of drawingblood from the penis (Coe 1989, fig. 17). Anotherpot shows him enthroned on a Cauac symbol, hold-ing a bloodletter shaped like a deity head (the Per-forator God; Coe 1989 : 173, fig. 18).We can conclude that Hun Ahau and his latermanifestation, Hunahpu, seem to be linked with theMorning Star in the dawn sky before sunrise andwith the underworld sun. Whereas Kinich Ahau isthe sun up in the sky, Hun Ahau may symbolize thesun in its nightly journey or the sun prior to itstransformation into the sun of this age, just as Hu-nahpu in the Popol Vuh became the sun only afterhe had passed through the underworld and had beenkilled by the lords of death. Hun Ahau has nocturnaland death associations, most notable in the deathspots. As a ballplayer, he takes part in a celestial ballgame that also involves his twin brother, the moon.Hunahpu is solar, but as the sun of a previous worldage or the underworld sun, he may be merged withthe Morning Star.GIII: THE SUN AS THEMIDDLE BROTHERThe most intriguing solar deity of the Late ClassicMaya is one of the three brothers referred to in sev-enth-century dynastic sculpture at Palenque. GIII isgenerally accepted as the Palenque version of theMaya Sun God. His name incorporates the Kin glyph(Fig. 3.9g; Lounsbury 1985; 1991 : 813). The analy-sis presented here confirms Kelley’s (1965) initialconclusion that GIII represents the underworld sun,(1982 : 56 –57, no. 20) identify the scene as a specificepisode from the Popol Vuh when Hunahpu (HunAhau) shoots the bird Vucub Caquix in a nance tree,an interpretation that has gained wide acceptance(Coe 1989 : 169). Hun Ahau as a hunter may embodythe early dawn hours, the optimal time for hunting,according to the Maya. Hun Ahau also wears a head-band beneath his hunter’s hat, the insignia of theHeadband Twins. The headband itself seems to bean insignia of ballplayers (Chapter 6).Hun Ahau, the spotted Headband Twin, is some-times paired with his jaguar-spotted twin on paintedceramics. The Headband Twins are the Classic pe-riod counterparts of Hunahpu and Xbalanque (Coe1973, 1978b), discussed in greater detail in Chap-ter 4. The Headband Twins wear the same headbandknotted at the back, but they have different head-dress ornaments and body markings (Fig. 3.11a – b).Death spots mark the Hun Ahau twin, and the jaguarspots appear on the jaguar twin. Sometimes even thisdistinction is blurred, as on the Blom plate (Coe1989, fig. 12).Another pot, known as Princeton 8, shows HunAhau aiming his blowgun at a reclining vulture(Fig. 3.11c; Coe 1978b : 58 – 60, no. 8). Here HunAhau wears a headband without the straw hunter’shat. The scene has been interpreted as a representa-tion of a folktale that tells how the Sun God retrievedhis wife, the Moon Goddess, when he made KingVulture fall asleep by shooting him with a blowgun(Braakhuis 1987 : 246).A pot known as Princeton 16 may represent HunAhau wearing a straw hunter’s hat as he sits in a qua-trefoil cave (Coe 1978b : 108, no. 16). Although Coedoes not identify the figure in the straw hat, hepoints out a lunar companion, the young MoonGoddess with her characteristic lunar crescent. Thiswould seem to show the underworld sun and the100PRECOLUMBIAN AND COLONIAL SOLAR IMAGESFIG. 3.11.a:Headband Twins, representing sun andmoon, pull Maize God up from crack in turtle shell (LateClassic vessel; after Hellmuth 1987, fig. 438).b:Hero Twins, Hun Ahau and Yax Balam; Yax Balam,at right, pours water on Maize God (Hun Nal), whosprouts from turtle shell (Late Classic Resurrection plate;after Taube 1988a, fig. 8b).c:Puma aspect of sun with Chac holding axe and GodDonpo(‘‘moon’’) throne; second vignette shows HunAhau shooting vulture with blowgun (Late Classic Mayavase; after Braakhuis 1987, fig. 1)."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"GIII: THE SUN AS THE MIDDLE BROTHER101"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"that he is right about GIII’s aspect as the underworldsun. GIII appears to be closely linked with Hunahputhrough a name pattern that incorporates Hun Ahau.GIII is namedmah k’ina,meaning ‘‘great sun’’(Lounsbury 1985 : 49, figs. 2a – e; Schele 1992b : 157).This name is followed by a T239 Ahau face with aspot on the cheek, resembling the T1000 Ahau variantrepresenting the spotted Headband Twin, suggestinga link with the underworld sun (Fig. 3.9g). Lounsbury(1985 : 51) reads this compound (T239.594[:130]) as‘‘lord sun,’’ but Coe (1989 : 168) questions his read-ing of the woven mat sign (T594). Kelley (1976 : 6)interprets T239 asxib(youth) and T594 (a checker-board design) asbalba(shield), indicating that GIII’sname should be read as ‘‘Lord of Xibalba.’’ It seemstherefore that GIII has an underworld connection,because this name could refer to the sun at night, anunderworld sun.A rare glyph at E4 in the texts of the Temple of theInscriptions may represent GIII as a cross-eyed fig-ure with a Roman nose, a T-shaped central tooth,and a mouth volute — all features that evoke the SunGod (Fig. 3.9g(6); Lounsbury 1985). In place of theKin markings, the figure has a mirror on his brow. Aface like that of the GIII portrait glyph appears atboth ends of an earth band in the central panel ofthe Temple of the Sun at Palenque (Robertson 1991,fig. 95). This face, possibly another image of GIII,can be distinguished from the simian faces with mir-ror markings that alternate with Caban glyphs on theearth band itself. The crouching figure to the left,previously discussed as a solar deity with mirrormarkings, may also depict GIII (Fig. 3.6b). The factthat this figure is positioned on an earth band mayindicate that he is an earthly or underworld sun.We can conclude that GIII is a specialized aspectof the Sun belonging to a mythic tradition thatnames the Sun as the middle child in a family ofthree celestial brothers. Best known from Palenque,the tradition was certainly once widespread, for itsurvives today among the Mopan. GIII may be rep-resented with a mirror brow in one glyphic expres-sion of his name, but more often he is named withan Ahau variant referring to the spotted HeadbandTwin. The associated Kin glyph indicates a solar con-a finding supported by other scholars (Robertson1991 : 43). GIII is probably similar to Hunahpu ofthe Popol Vuh; however, being one of three siblings,he belongs to a different mythic complex than thatrecorded in the tale of the Hero Twins.Scholars designate the Palenque Triad as GI, GII,and GIII because the texts often list them in this or-der, but their birth order is different. As the secondborn in the Palenque Triad, GIII parallels the roleof the Sun God as the second born in the modernMopan tale (Thompson 1930 : 120 –123). The eldestbrother in this tale is Venus, corresponding to GI.This correlation is intriguing because independentlines of evidence have led Schele and Freidel (1990 :245) to conclude that GI is Venus and GIII is theSun. The youngest brother is GII, the same birth or-der ascribed to a monkey character who is Mars orJupiter in one Mopan account. The uncertain iden-tity of the younger brother may reflect a loss ofknowledge about the superior planets in moderntimes (Chapter 1). Apparently, the Mopan tale pre-serves a story of three celestial brothers that goesback to arounda.d.700 at Palenque. This triadmay be known beyond Palenque, for Proskouriakoff(1978 : 116) notes that the ‘‘3-god indicator’’ appearsat Caracol and at Tikal in the time of transition be-tween the Early Classic and Late Classic periods. Shesuggests they represent three matrilineal clans asso-ciated with heavenly ancestors.GIII’s birthday (1.18.5.3.6 13 Cimi) correspondsto a time when a lunar eclipse could have occurred,because it coincides with the day of the full moon on11/12 /2360b.c.(O.S.). It is possible that his birthdayin November alludes to a seasonal aspect of the sun.In terms of parallel, it is intriguing that Huitzilo-pochtli’s birthday was also celebrated around thesame time of year, at the beginning of the dry seasonin November, and his birth may coincide with a lu-nar eclipse (Milbrath 1980a, 1995a, 1997).A solar title used for GIII may refer to the under-world sun. Dennis Tedlock (1991 : 168 n. 6; 1992 :264) proposes that GIII is the eclipsed sun or theunderworld sun. Certain details of Tedlock’s inter-pretation are questionable, such as the link he makesbetween GIII and Xbalanque, but it seems certain102PRECOLUMBIAN AND COLONIAL SOLAR IMAGES"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"text, and a glyph with a checkerboard design mayrefer to the underworld. Such names suggest thatGIII may be related to Hun Ahau as an underworldaspect of the Sun closely linked with Venus.THE SUN IN THE PRECOLUMBIANMAYA WORLDVIEWSolar orientations in architecture emphasize certainseasonal positions of the sun, especially equinoxes,solstices, and solar zeniths. Orientations that antici-pate these events may involve a count of Uinals orlunar months. Some orientations reflect a division ofthe year into segments of 105 and 260 days thatprobably synchronized the Tzolkin and the solarcycle.Animal images symbolizing the sun are not allthat common. In the Postclassic period, the red ma-caw carrying fire represents the noon sun, KinichKakmo, known from the Colonial period. A solarhummingbird appears in the Classic period, an im-age that survives in modern folktales. In some con-texts, a puma may represent the golden sun crossingthe daytime sky, whereas the jaguar takes the role ei-ther of the sun at night or of its close counterpart,the moon.In Postclassic imagery, the sun travels along acord, a metaphorical image of its ecliptical path.Other images evoke the symbolism of the solar raysand the color of the sun. The Sun God’s beard sug-gests the rays of the sun, as described in Colonialperiod accounts. The Kin sign relates the sun to aflower, most probably the red plumeria (Plumeriarubra) mentioned in Colonial period sources. InClassic and Postclassic times, the Kin sign marks thebody of the Sun God. A Classic period god with amirror brow may be an image of the shiny aspect ofthe sun related to modern Maya images of the sun asa mirror.The Classic period god of the daytime sun is Kin-ich Ahau or Ahau Kin, the lord of the number four,alluding to the four horizon positions of the suntraced out by the rising and setting sun at the sol-stices. The Sun God of the Maya is lord of time andspace, linked especially with the east and west in cos-mic diagrams. The sun also takes the overhead posi-tion of the noonday sun or the seasonal zenith incertain representations, such as the Pomona Flare.Some aspects of the Sun God show him as aged, per-haps as a seasonal metaphor for the sun aging overthe course of a day or the solar year. His crossed eyesreflect Maya aesthetics of beauty. Kinich Ahau, theSun God so prevalent on monumental sculpture ofthe Classic Maya, is relatively rare in painted ceram-ics, perhaps because the ceramics are more oftenconcerned with underworld imagery.Classic period ceramics seem to focus especiallyon a death-spotted solar god known as Hun Ahauor the spotted Headband Twin. He often wears abroad-brimmed straw hat that probably depicts a co-rona of solar rays around his face. An underworldcontext is suggested by death spots and an associa-tion with caves. Hun Ahau’s image on monumentalsculpture is usually confined to glyphs depictingAhau variants and to some rare representations ofthe Hun Ahau ballplayer. His counterpart in sculp-tures of Palenque may be GIII of the Palenque Triad,apparently representing the underworld sun born inmythical times into a family with astronomical sib-lings representing planets. The Ahau glyph in GIII’sname has the face of Hun Ahau, the counterpart ofHunahpu.In the Popol Vuh, Hunahpu plays the role of ahunter and a ballplayer in the underworld pittedagainst the lords of death in Xibalba. Classic Mayaimagery shows Hun Ahau wearing a ball-game beltand shooting his blowgun, confirming roles seen inthe Popol Vuh. A connection with the Morning Staris implied by modern Quiche ́ accounts linking Hu-nahpu (Junajpu) to the Morning Star. The frequentconjunctions of the Sun and Venus, separated by ap-proximately the same interval that separates repeti-tions of the day 1 Ahau (Hun Ahau), may have in-spired imagery that links Hunahpu to both the Sunand the Morning Star.Changes in solar imagery over time are notable.One clear difference is that the cult of solar ancestorsseems to disappear in the Postclassic period.

Many of these images are expressed in a metaphorical context. The im-portance of metaphor in recording observations of natural history in Mesoamericahas been noted by a number of scholars. This chapter explores images of the moonthat may be based on observations of the lunar season and the moon’s phases, posi-tion, and motion.Eric Thompson’s (1939) seminal study concluded that a number of beliefs aboutthe Moon Goddess were shared by the Maya and the people of central Mexico: shewas a wife of the sun or the sun’s mother or grandmother; she was also a patronessof weaving, divination, pregnancy, childbirth, sexual license, the earth, crops, andwater. He explored these associations in subsequent publications and also deter-mined that a youthful goddess was associated with the waxing moon, while an aginggoddess represented the waning moon. The analysis presented here and in my pre-vious publications on the Moon Goddess supports many of his interpretations andprovides further elaboration through study of naming patterns and ethnographicanalogy. His interpretation of the lunar complex among the Precolumbian Mayadoes require substantial modifications in some respects. He concluded that therewas only a weak link between the Maya moon deity and water, but it is clear that theconnection is in fact quite strong. Thompson also failed to explore a rather consis-tent relationship between the Moon Goddess and serpents. He also underplayed therole of masculine imagery in the lunar complex, suggesting that instances of a maleMoon God were the result of central Mexican influence in the Maya area. In fact,male lunar imagery seems intrinsically Maya and is closely connected with ball play-ing and the maize complex.The moon seems to be exceptionally important among the Precolumbian Maya,but its role is too often overlooked by scholars. This chapter draws extensively onmy previous studies exploring images of lunar phases and seasonal aspects of themoon (Milbrath 1995a, 1996). In these studies, I conclude that in the Postclassiccodices weaving goddesses relate to the dry season, and water-pouring goddesses tothe rainy season. The youthful goddesses seem to depict the moon from first ap-pearance through the full moon, whereas the aged goddesses represent the waningmoon through the new moon, a phase sometimes represented by an eclipse mon-ster. The cult of the aged goddesses seems most highly developed in the Postclassicperiod, especially at sites like Tulum, facing the sea to the east, where the waningmoon disappears into the waters of the underworld.

The table probably was applied pri-marily to eclipse prediction, as we will see in theupcoming discussion. The relationship between theTzolkin and the lunar month was built into a cycleof approximately thirty-three years in the DresdenCodex eclipse table (11,960 days54632605405lunations). This allowed Maya astronomers to pre-dict the new moon with an error of no more than aday, resulting in a lunar month of 29.5308642 days(Aveni 1980 : 169). The table also incorporates lunarintervals registered in an inscription of 19.4.19 thattotals 6,939 days (235 lunations), a close approxi-mation of nineteen tropical years, the metonic cyclethat brings the solar year and lunar cycle into re-newed alignment (Berlin 1977 : 75). For example, afull moon on the summer solstice would be seenagain nineteen years later. Their use of the metoniccycle indicates that the Maya were interested in theseasonal position of eclipses.Evidence for the metonic cycle on Copa ́ n Stela A isassociated with a text naming the Sun God (T1010)and the Moon Goddess (C7 –D7; Pl. 20). Pairingtheir names in this fashion recalls couplets in theChilam Balam of Tizimin that sayk’inil-uil,meaning‘‘the period of the sun, the period of the moon’’ (Ed-monson 1982b : 264 n. 10). As noted in Chapter 1,the contemporary Maya often pair the sun and themoon. On Stela A the pairing seems to refer to thesun and the full moon, for the Initial Series date of9.14.19.8.0 12 Ahau 18 Cumku (1/28/731) falls onthe full moon, and it is followed by the date 4 Ahau18 Muan (9.14.19.5.0; 11/29/730), also the day of thefull moon (a date recorded on Stela H). The Calen-dar Round 4 Ahau 18 Muan at E2 –F2 may refer tothe metonic cycle, because it is 9.15.0 days (6,940days) after the Katun ending 9.14.0.0.0 6 Ahau (adate not given in the text). As Heinrich Berlin (1977 :75 –76) notes, this interval gives a value close tothe solar year (365.263 days) and the lunar month(29.532 days).Martha Macri proposes that basic units of thenew interpretations of Classic period jaguar imag-ery, linking a number of different jaguar deities tothe moon, including the Jaguar Paddler, the Water-lily Jaguar, and possibly the Jaguar War God, alsoknown as the Jaguar God of the Underworld.I begin the chapter with the moon’s role in thePreconquest calendar. There follows a section oneclipses and one on the moon symbol in variousforms and contexts. The next sections treat animalimages of the moon. The remaining sections focuson various lunar deities as manifestations of differentaspects of the moon, especially those that show ce-lestial positions, lunar phases, and seasons.LUNAR CALENDARSAccording to Landa, the Yucatec Maya had a year of365 days and six hours ‘‘as perfect as our own,’’which was divided into two kinds of months, one a20-day festival ‘‘month’’ and the other a true monthof 30 days. Probably the latter alternated between29 and 30 days because Landa says ‘‘they calledeach month V [u], which means moon, and theycounted it from the time it came out new until itdid not appear’’ (Tozzer 1941 : 133). Here ‘‘new’’ re-fers to the first crescent, which apparently repre-sented the beginning of the month. As we will see,the Classic Maya may have counted the beginningof the month from different starting points at dif-ferent sites.The core of the lunar calendar is the synodic lunarmonth tracking the changing lunar phases. Search-ing the Colonial period Yucatec dictionaries, WeldonLamb (1981 : 238, 246 – 248) found a number ofdifferent names for the lunar phases. The phrase‘‘within the earth is the moon’’ commonly refersto the moon in conjunction. ‘‘Serpent-fang moon’’(dzay can u) and ‘‘child moon’’ (paal u) refer to thefirst crescent moon, while ‘‘fat moon’’ (nuc u)isthe name for the waxing moon. The full moon is the‘‘old moon’’ or the ‘‘ear of maize moon’’ (yiih[u]) inthe Motul dictionary.Lunar reckonings are clearly important in thePostclassic Venus table of the Dresden Codex, whichrefers to intervals associated with the synodic lunarmonths (Chapter 5).

The 13-day period of the waxingmoon is linked with the personified numbers onethrough thirteen, including many that represent lu-nar deities (Macri 1982). Adding 7 days takes thecount through the waning quarter and completesthe cycle of twenty personified numbers; adding the9-day cycle (Glyphs G1– G9) brings the lunar monthto a close at the time of the new moon. These inter-vals are found on monuments with Initial Series in-scriptions that record a repeating cycle of thirteennumbers in the Tzolkin dates and the Supplemen-tary Series cycle of 7 days and another of 9 days,similar to the nine lords of the night in central Mex-ico (Justeson 1989 : 77 –79; Thompson 1960 : 208 –212; 1978 :17 –18). In rare instances, the three cyclesare combined in an 819-day cycle that reflects theleast common multiple of the numbers seven, nine,and thirteen. The cycle of 9 days, a standard featureof the Supplementary Series, also forms a long cyclethat does not repeat for 468 years (9352), whencombined with the 52-year Calendar Round.In 1915, Sylvanus Morley published the first ex-tensive study of the Supplementary Series, designat-ing letters to identify different glyphs in the series(Glyphs A– G, and X, Y, and Z; cited in Aveni 1980 :161–171). When referring only to the lunar data,scholars tend to use the term Lunar Series (Berlin1977 : 69). John Teeple (1930 : 51, 63) first recognizedthat Glyph A of the Lunar Series gives the length ofthe current lunar month, and he also realized thatGlyphs D and E record the age of the moon. GlyphA with a coefficient of nine or ten indicates whetherthe month is counted as twenty-nine or thirty dayslong (Fig. 4.1k, right). It usually is a moon sign witha dot in the center (T683a), but sometimes a moonface or another variable element may take its place,and the number ten can be represented by a skeletalface (Fig. 4.1d). Glyph D has a numeral coefficientof up to nineteen to show the actual age of the moonwhen it is less that twenty days old. It is usuallyrepresented by T683a, sometimes combined with ahand pointing a finger (Fig. 4.1f, right); an am-phibian face may be substituted for T683a or, morerarely, a simian face (Fig. 4.1f, left). Possibly this pat-tern of substitution indicates months counted fromdifferent starting points. Glyph E, a T683a moonsign sometimes stylized as a human face, representsthe moon age when it is twenty days or more, thenumber of days being indicated by coefficients ofzero to nine (Fig. 4.1g). When paired with GlyphE, Glyph D does not carry a numerical coefficient.Glyph D accompanies Glyph E in a Piedras Negrasinscription that shows Glyph E with the numberseven, indicating the twenty-seventh day of themonth, and Glyph A with the number nine to indi-cate that the month is counted as twenty-nine ninedays long (Fig. 4.1k). Anthony Aveni (1980 : 163)notes that when Glyph E and Glyph D are seen to-gether without coefficients, a new moon is implied.Some variants of Glyph D are almost identical toGlyph E, and this presents a problem in distinguish-ing the two, as can be seen when comparing GlyphD, representing a moon age of nine days (9D), andGlyph E, representing a moon age of twenty-six days(6E; Fig. 4.1f – g).The Lunar Series also includes Glyph C, whichcounts the number of a specific lunation in a cycle ofsix moons (177 days) known as a ‘‘lunar semester.’’Glyph C is a compound with a flat hand and a moonsign with three dots in the center (the T683b glyph)combined with a third element, a deity portrait headthat has three variants, indicating three different lu-nar semesters in an eighteen-month cycle used topredict eclipses (Fig. 4.1e; Justeson 1989 : 87 – 88, 91;Linden 1996). John Justeson points out that froma.d.350 to abouta.d.687 (9.12.15.0.0) at least five differ-ent systems of counting the lunations were used, in-cluding two different notations for numbering themoons in a set of six lunations. Most centers used arelatively simple system of moon numbers, with themajority following the pattern of enumerating cur-rent months seen at Tikal; but around the Usuma-cinta area, the Maya chose to count elapsed months,resulting in numbers smaller by one than those ofTikal. The so-called period of uniformity is actuallynot a single period, but involves several differentperiods and different core areas with variant num-bering systems for Glyph C.

Heinrich Berlin (1977 : 70)extends the period of uniformity to 9.16.10.0.0, not-ing that this date is associated with an inscription of1C throughout the Maya area. This seems significantbecause it is the date of the new moon in the 584,283correlation, and Glyph C is now known to be part ofa cycle used for tracking eclipses.Some of the more enigmatic Lunar Series glyphsmay be connected with the lunar calendar. Glyph X,also part of the Lunar Series, is part of an eighteen-month lunar calendar linked with Glyph C, whichrecords the semesters in an eighteen-month eclipsecycle (Fig. 4.1h; Linden 1986, 1996). When a five-month semester was used, the cycle was apparentlyreduced to seventeen months (Justeson 1989 : 90 –91). The twelve different forms of Glyph X mayfunction as month names, since they lack numeralcoefficients.

There is a spreadof about seven days in the calculated age of the moonin different Maya inscriptions. Linton Satterthwaite(1967 : 142, 152) concluded that variant systems werein place at different centers, with Yaxchila ́ n and Pie-dras Negras using a different zero date than Quiri-gua ́ . The 584,283 correlation adopted by Thompson(1960 : 236, 310) in his later work would indicatethat usually the Maya reckoned their months fromthe disappearance of the old moon or conjunction.Thompson seems to favor a count from the disap-pearance of the moon, the method of counting thatis still current in some Tzeltal, Chol, and Tzotzilvillages of Chiapas. Perhaps there were different lu-nar glyphs used to designate different starting pointsfor counting the lunar month. David Kelley (1976 :35) suggests that the Glyph D variant with a handand T181 should be counted from last visibility,whereas the variant with an amphibian face knownas the ‘‘upended frog’’ (T740) marks a count begin-ning with the first visible crescent (4D and 10D inFig. 4.1f ).The Classic Maya may have timed dynastic ritu-als by lunar observations made in conjunction withthe solar calendar. For example, Floyd Lounsbury(1989) notes that Chan Bahlum’s heir-designationdate at Palenque falls on the new moon just prior tothe summer solstice. Only the 584,285 correlationprovides this link with the astronomical new moon;shifting to the 584,283 correlation would indicatean observation of the last crescent before the sum-mer solstice. Since the last crescent may be the be-ginning of the lunar month, it still could be astro-nomically significant. As we will see, there are manyother astronomical events that correlate with theheir-designation dates (Chapters 6 and 7).We have only scratched the surface of the lunarcalendar among the Precolumbian Maya. It is clearthat a number of different lunar counts existed si-multaneously, and some lunar cycles can be tracedback to the Preclassic period (Justeson 1989 : 79, 87).By the Classic period, the Lunar Series included in-formation about the current lunar phase (Glyphs DJusteson notes that any given form of Glyph X onlyoccurs with two moon numbers, and with any givenmoon number associated with Glyph C, only twopossible variants of Glyph X occur (Teeple 1930 : 61–62). Glyph X must be studied on a site-by-site basisbecause there is so much variability in the moonnumber system at different centers.The meanings of some glyphs in the Supplemen-tary Series are not as well understood. Previousresearch had suggested that Glyphs Y and Z rep-resented dawn and the night (Aveni 1980 : 165).More recent studies suggest that these glyphs maybe linked with the 819-day count (Justeson 1989 : 78,103 –104). Glyph Y, which has T739 as its mainsign, is a rare and enigmatic glyph in the Supplemen-tary Series that involves coefficients numbering twothrough six (A6; Pl. 20). Justeson points out that ifthe 819-day count was used to record the behaviorof planets, Glyph Y may hold the key to understand-ing how they tracked the planets. Glyph Z, formerlyidentified as a separate glyph, is now understood tobe simply a numeral coefficient of Glyph Y, essen-tially an elaborate spelling of the numeral five (Jus-teson 1989 : 103; Linden 1996).Glyph F of the Supplementary Series, anotherenigmatic glyph, is never used without Glyph G,which records the cycle of nine days (Thompson1960 : 212, fig. 34). Glyph F has symbolic forms thatresemble a tied knot or a jaguar skin, and a headform that shows considerable variety.Inscriptions recorded on Classic period monu-ments indicate that the Maya were able to calculatethe length of the month with considerable accuracy.Based on research by Teeple, it has been understoodthat dates recorded at Palenque give an interval of81 synodic lunar months (6.11.12), indicating anaverage lunar month of 29.53086 days, very closeto the true length of the month (29.53059 days; Av-eni 1980 : 169). However, you will not actually findthe interval 6.11.12 recorded at Palenque; as Berlin(1977 : 71–72) points out, the number 6.11.12 is im-plied in the recorded interval of 1.13.4.0, or 11,960days, equaling 405 lunations (536.11.12). Teeplealso suggests that a formula of 12.4.0, or 149 synodicmonths of 29.53020 days, was used during the pe-riod of uniformity at Copa ́ n, but Berlin cautions that110LUNAR IMAGES AND DEITIES"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"and E), the length of the current or previous lunarmonth (Glyph A), and the position of the lunarmonth in the lunar half-year or semester (Glyph C).The length of the lunar month was calculated withprecision, as seen in sets of five and six months usedin eclipse predictions. In both Classic and Postclassictimes, the Maya recorded cycles of 405 months, andprobably also understood the metonic cycle of 235lunations.COLONIAL AND POSTCLASSICECLIPSE IMAGERYEclipse prediction was especially important in theEarly Postclassic period (a.d.900/1000 –1250), butby the Late Postclassic and Colonial periods thisknowledge may have been lost. Some Colonial pe-riod accounts of eclipses seem to show an under-standing that the position of the moon relative to thesun is what causes eclipses, but the majority speak ofa monster devouring the sun or the moon. Eclipsedemons in theRitual of the Bacabsinclude a snake,a lizard, and a scorpion (Roys 1965 : 31, 134; Lambn.d.a). The Chilam Balam of Chumayel describes aneclipse in Katun 8 Ahau as follows: ‘‘Then the face ofthe sun was eaten; then the face of the sun was dark-ened; then its face was extinguished’’ (Roys 1967 :76). The Vienna dictionary names an eclipse god asa supreme deity called Colup-u-uich-kin (snatcherof the eye of the sun; Roys 1965 : xvii). In theRitualof the Bacabs,this being is the agent of solar eclipses,just as Colup-u-uich-akab (snatcher of the eye of thenight) is the agent of lunar eclipses (Roys 1965 : xvii,17, 145). Michael Closs (1989 : 399) believes thatthese two are not distinct eclipse deities, but con-trasting aspects of the same deity.Accounts of the Colonial period often attributeeclipses to animals eating the sun and the moon,and usually the agent of eclipse is an ant or afeline (Closs 1989). The chronicler Diego Lo ́ pezde Cogolludo (1954) describes accounts of antscalledxibalwho attack the sun and eat it, noting thatthe Yucatec Maya made noise to scare them away.Contemporary Yucatec Maya descriptions say thesun is being bitten during an eclipse (Barrera Va ́s-quez 1980; Closs 1989 : 390; Redfield and Villa Rojas1962 : 206).Closs (1989 : 396 – 398) concludes that Venus wasthe agent of eclipses among the Maya in Precolum-bian times, based on ethnographic accounts identi-fying Xulab, a god described as Venus in some ac-counts, as the cause of eclipses. He also notes thatthis connection is indicated by the prominence ofVenus in the Dresden Codex eclipse table on page58a (Fig. 5.1a; Pl. 3). Here there is a descending fig-ure whose head is replaced by a Lamat glyph oftenlinked with Venus (Chapter 5). Closs (1989) notesthat this is an eclipse monster representing Venus.A skeletal figure on page 53a of the Dresden Co-dex eclipse table may be Venus as another form ofeclipse monster (Pl. 3). The glyphic passage over-head, immediately preceding the name of the DeathGod, records the nameah tzul ahaw,a name for Ve-nus as the Evening Star (Closs 1989 : 409, fig. 31.5a).This may indicate that the Death God bears a Venustitle in his role as an eclipse monster. A similar nameappears on Dresden Codex 47 (Fig. 5.7r). Closs sug-gests that this names Lahun Chan, but it may moregenerally refer to the scorpion aspect of Venus. Thediving figure on 58b is clearly an eclipse monsterrepresenting Venus with the sameah tzul ahawname(Fig. 5.1a).Serpents devouring eclipse signs on pages 56b and57b may refer to another aspect of Venus as aneclipse monster (Pl. 3). The remaining pictures inthe eclipse tables depict the eclipsed sun or moon.Five of the ten pictures in the Dresden Codexeclipse table include ‘‘winged’’ Kin glyphs that referto eclipses (Pl. 3). The last picture includes both awinged Kin and a winged T682 lunar glyph. Thelast picture is also distinguished from the othersby a chronological glyph recording 13 Tuns (4,680days) at the top of the last glyph column. This givesthe picture and text a larger scope referring tolonger cycles of time, namely, the eclipse half-year(173.333332754,680 days) and eight Venus cycles(835841854,680 days). This reinforces the con-nection between Venus and eclipses seen in the as-sociated eclipse monster.The winged Kin is usually interpreted as a solar-eclipse symbol.

The notion that a constel-lation devours the sun during an eclipse probably re-sulted from the fact that constellations near the sunbecome visible during solar eclipses.A concern with the seasonal position of eclipsesamidst the background of stars seems to be evidentin the 260-day agricultural almanac on Madrid Co-dex 12b –18b (Fig. 7.3). A pair of identical solar-eclipse glyphs appear on page 12b of the MadridCodex, a configuration that suggests an emblematicgrouping rather than real eclipse events. Eclipse in-tervals are evident if you count the actual number ofdays represented on pages 13b –16b, as discussed inChapter 3. The solar-eclipse sign on page 13b isseparated by an interval of 148 days from the solar-eclipse sign on page 17b the same eclipse interval re-corded in the Dresden Codex before most of theeclipse pictures (Pl. 3). And if you include the 40-day period on page 17b, the interval is extended to188 days, which would include the six-month eclipseintervals of 177 and 178 days recorded in the Dres-den Codex eclipse tables (Pl. 3). Since the almanacclearly was designed to be reused, the eclipse sym-bols warned that if there was an eclipse near the be-ginning of the fixed agricultural calendar in earlyFebruary, there could be another around the newyear in late July (Chapter 3).Solar-eclipse glyphs often appear alone in theDresden Codex, but lunar-eclipse symbols are invari-ably paired with a solar-eclipse sign (45b, 56a, 58b,66a). Although the aged face in the lunar-eclipseglyph is of uncertain gender, it probably refers to themoon with an honorific title like ‘‘GrandmotherMoon,’’ a name found among the contemporaryMaya. Clearly, solar eclipses are more prominentthan lunar eclipses in the imagery and glyphs of theeclipse table.There are a number of images that may refer tolunar eclipses in Dresden Codex almanacs that focuson the Moon Goddess. Lunar eclipses have a muchwider range of visibility, thus they are seen more of-ten than solar eclipses. This may be why there areso many images of the dead Moon Goddess in theDresden Codex lunar almanacs. The almanacs onthe black and white winged eclipse glyphs. On page56b, the winged Kin has a crossed design formed bytwo eyeballs with veins attached. The extruded eye-balls recall Colonial period accounts describing howthe eclipse monster is the ‘‘snatcher of the eye of thesun.’’ Page 55a shows the bearded face of the agedSun God (God G) surrounded by extruded eyes, anapt image for a solar eclipse that may also carry theunderworld connotation of ‘‘death eyes’’ (Fig. 3.5d).A goddess with her eyes closed and her neckstrangled by a cord on page 53b represents theeclipsed moon (Fig. 4.7c; Pl. 3; Thompson 1970b :301). This is a total eclipse of the moon, accordingto Lounsbury (1978 : 797 –798), who notes that thestrangled Moon Goddess is shown with glyphs over-head that refer to the death and darkening of themoon. Charles Hofling and Thomas O’Neil (1992 :103) point out that her closed eyes evoke contem-porary Yucatec Maya descriptions of the eclipsed sunor moon with its eye blinded. This follows a generalpattern seen elsewhere in the Dresden Codex, withlunar eclipses represented by a death aspect of theyoung Moon Goddess with closed eyes.A glyphic reference to a solar eclipse may appearin the Dresden Codex on pages 54b (last column)and 55b (first column). A glyph compound pairs Kinwith a net glyphpa(T586) and T568, read asluby anumber of scholars but also a logographic referenceto piercing with a weapon (Kurbjuhn 1989 : 76). Vic-toria Bricker and Harvey Bricker (1995 : 97) inter-pret the first part of the compound aspaal,the ad-jectival form of the verbpa‘to break.’ They read theglyphs aspaal u kin,or ‘‘the sun was broken,’’ agraphic description of what happens to the sun dur-ing an eclipse.In the Paris Codex (23 – 24), the eclipse signs areKin glyphs framed by winged panels, one coloredblack, the other red (Fig. 7.2a). Bruce Love (1994 :93) describes these as symbols of the sun’s positionbetween the night sky and day sky, denying anyconnection with eclipses. He interprets the animalsbiting these solar symbols as constellations influenc-ing the sun rather than eclipse images. Nevertheless,the devouring act suggests a different interpretation.Harvey and Victoria Bricker (1992 : 174) proposethat animals biting the solar-eclipse symbols refer to112LUNAR IMAGES AND DEITIES"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Dresden Codex 16 – 23 show a number of differentdeath aspects of the Moon Goddess.

Another possible lunar-eclipse image ap-pears on Dresden Codex 61, where the lunar rabbitis devoured by a serpent.We can conclude that the eclipse monsters de-scribed in Colonial period accounts are also evidentin the Postclassic period. Venus seems to be one of theeclipse monsters. Postclassic lunar and solar eclipsesare represented similarly with winged panels anddeath imagery. The lunar-eclipse symbol usually de-picts an aged face, probably representing Grand-mother Moon. Personified lunar eclipses, especiallycommon in the lunar almanacs, usually depict a deathaspect of the youthful Moon Goddess, representingher with closed eyes and death spots. Solar eclipsesseem to be of greater interest in the Dresden Codexeclipse table, since there is only one pictorial image ofthe eclipsed moon and the only lunar-eclipse glyphsare those paired with solar-eclipse symbols.THE DRESDEN CODEX ECLIPSE TABLEThe eclipse table in the Dresden Codex (51–58)shows eclipse glyphs and intervals during which aneclipse could occur somewhere, generally referredto as eclipse windows (Pl. 3). After an associatedLong Count date in red (10.19.6.1.8, first column51a), there follows a set of multiples of 1.13.4.0(11,960 days) in seven columns on 51a –52a withan opening inscription of 1.9.18.0.0 that is 18311,960 days. The interval of 11,960 days equals 46Tzolkins and is very close to 405 synodic months. Aperiod of 1,820 days, equaling five computing years(53364) and seven Tzolkins (73260), appears onpage 52a in a Uinal-Tun notation.Black numbers at the top of pages 53a –58b ofthe table show cumulative totals that carry forwarda count of lunar synodic months over a periodof 11,958 days, equaling approximately thirty-threeyears (Aveni 1980 : 177, table 17). This part of thetable uses an average lunar month of 29.52592 days,only seven minutes away from the modern value(Aveni 1980 : 183). The Tzolkin dates (almanac days)below the cumulative totals indicate the dates end-ing five- or six-month periods over the course of405 lunar months or 11,959 days (Lounsbury 1978 :table 2). The long cycle was developed so that as-tronomers could reuse the canonical 12 Lamat basedate, orlub,because 463260 equals 11,960 days,which is very close to the 11,958-day period indi-cated in the cumulative totals and the 11,959-day pe-riod in the Tzolkin dates. The true length of 405 lu-nar months is 11,959.88814 days (a month equals29.530588 days).The table is read across the top from pages 51a to58a, and then across the bottom beginning with page51b. Intervals are recorded with red numbers for the20-day periods (Uinals) and black numbers for theindividual days (Kins), an unusual format becausered numbers are usually reserved for coefficients forTzolkin dates (red numbers are outlined and theblack are solid on Pl. 3).Pages 53a –58a of the table alternates counts of177 days (six months) and 148 days (five months).Intervals of 148 days (recorded as 7.8 in vertical col-umns) precede all the eclipse pictures except onpages 57a and 58b, where the number is 8.17 (177days, below Tzolkin date). The cumulative total inblack over the Tzolkin date on 57a shows that thenumber should be 7.8. In other columns, the cu-mulative totals show errors of no more than 20 days,except for 5.10.16 on 54a, which should be 5.14.16(2,096 days). Discrepancies also occur in the inter-vals and the cumulative totals. For example, an in-terval of 8.18 (178 days) appears on 57a (column A,below Tzolkin date), but the cumulative total above(11.1.6) indicates 177 days. Adding all the intervalstogether yields 11,959 days, a figure in accord withthe Tzolkin dates.Dates from the sacred almanac appear as sets ofthree consecutive Tzolkin dates (read from top tobottom) placed above the recorded intervals.

Aveni (1980 :180) emphasizes the importance of lunar eclipses inthe table. Justeson (1989 : 81– 85) also favors link-ing the table with lunar eclipses. Both scholars pointout that only twenty to thirty years of observationswould produce a system of successful lunar predic-tion, whereas it would take hundreds of years tostructure a solar-eclipse table; and the success ratefor predicting solar eclipses would be only about6 percent. Nonetheless, the table seems to empha-size glyphs and representations referring to solareclipses, and both solar and lunar eclipses were ap-parently important in the recorded intervals (Aveni1997 : 111–114, 200).Even though the table is not a record of observedeclipses, it is important to determine the historicalcontext of the table. Lounsbury (1978 : 775, 811)notes that the initial epoch of the system in the Dres-den Codex dates to arounda.d.755, but the arrange-ment of the table must date to some three hundredyears later. He maintains that a calculation involvinga ring number suggests a record of eclipses goingback toa.d.683. The Brickers (1983 : 18, 21) say thatthe table covers a thirty-three-year period in the sec-ond half of the eighth century; however, its predic-tive powers extended into the fourteenth centuryand even beyond. In my opinion, the table was cre-ated in the thirteenth century, but it incorporateshistorical reference points that go back to the Classicperiod.Thompson (1972 : 71) suggests that the first col-umn (A) on page 51a refers to 13.0.0.0.0 4 Ahau 8Cumku as a starting point, to which eight days areadded to reach 12 Lamat (13.0.0.0.8), and then theLong Reckoning (LR) distance number of 9.16.4.10.0,shown in black (with the Baktun incorrectly notedas 8), is added to reach the Long Count date of9.16.4.10.8 12 Lamat, which is a black number alter-nating or ‘‘interwritten’’ with a red number in thelast column on 52a (column F). All the Long Countdates appear in alternating colors of the ‘‘inter-written’’ style. As Thompson notes, interwritten be-tween the black LR in the first column of page 51 isa red Long Count inscription that records a date of10.19.6.1.8 12 Lamat (the number one over time hasAlmanacs. Moving from one column to the next re-sults in the interval seen at the bottom of the column(i.e., 1 Imix to 6 Muluc equals 148 days on 53a, col-umns B – C). There is only one error in the Tzol-kin notations (Lounsbury 1978 : 793). The Tzolkindates mark potential eclipse positions. Thompson(1972) points out that glyphs referring to death andcrop failure in the eclipse table indicate that eclipsescould bring disaster.As Teeple (1930 : 87 – 90) pointed out long ago, theTzolkin itself is suited to recording the eclipse half-year, because the sum of two periods of 260 days(520) is almost equal to three eclipse half-years (33173.315519.93). Nevertheless, the eclipse half-yearcannot be made to fit precisely in the intervals thatmake up the groups of five and six synodic monthsrecorded by the Tzolkin dates and associated inter-vals (Martin 1993).Most scholars agree that the table deals with pre-dictions, because there was no series of nine or teneclipses visible in Yucata ́ n that corresponds to the re-corded intervals (Aveni 1992b : 77; Kelley 1976 : 43).There has been debate about whether the table fo-cuses on lunar or solar events. Thompson (1972 : 71–77, 108; 1974 : 88 – 90) concludes that rather than be-ing a record of actual solar eclipses, the table wasused to predict solar eclipses. He implies that thetable also indicates an interest in lunar eclipses be-cause a picture was included after each group of fivelunations to indicate that when two solar eclipses oc-curred at intervals of 148 days, they were followed bya lunar eclipse (however, only one of the picturesseems to show a lunar eclipse). A number of scholarsconcur with Thompson that solar eclipses are em-phasized in the table, although they note evidencethat lunar eclipses are also represented (H. Brickerand V. Bricker 1983; Lounsbury 1978 : 789, 798 –799). On the other hand, Frederick Martin (1993)argues that the table could be an actual record ofeclipses referring to pairs of solar and lunar eclipses.Aveni (1980 : 80 – 81, 173 –183, tables 18 –19)points out that a number recorded in column D on52b gives the cumulative total of 18.5.5 (6,585) days,which is the Saros cycle of 223 lunations, resulting ina cycle of solar eclipses that recurs after a period of6,585.32 days (18.03 years). After four repetitions of114LUNAR IMAGES AND DEITIES"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"shifted to black). Thompson identifies three moreLong Count dates that can be derived from the al-ternating black and red numbers interwritten in thelast two columns of page 52. These are 9.16.4.11.3 1Akbal (column F in red); 9.16.4.11.18 3 Etz’nab (col-umn E in black, mistakenly recorded with 10 Uinals);and 9.19.8.7.8 7 Lamat (column E in red), which is aninaccurate date according to Thompson (1972 : 71).The Long Count dates in the table seem to spanmore than four hundred years. The black date in col-umn F of page 52a (9.16.4.10.8 12 Lamat) corre-sponds to the last visibility of the waning moon inthe 584,283 correlation, followed 17 days later by alunar eclipse on 11/23/755 (Oppolzer 1962). Theinterval between this 12 Lamat date in the eighthcentury (11/6 /755) and the thirteenth-century date(10.19.6.1.8) in red on page 51a is a lunar interval.The date 10.19.6.1.8 12 Lamat (9/18/1210) is one daybefore the new moon, virtually replicating the eventsof 9.16.4.10.8 12 Lamat (11/6 /755). Both dates couldrelate to the last visible crescent before the newmoon (Goldstine 1973). A focus on the last crescentwould help to confirm Thompson’s (1960 : 310) the-ory that the ancient Maya counted from the last vis-ible crescent moon. The date ina.d.1210 may alsoinvolve Venus events, for Venus was in conjunctionwith Jupiter just above the western horizon at duskat that time.In sum, the Dresden Codex eclipse table is con-cerned with predicting solar eclipses and lunareclipses. The purpose of the table seems to be divina-tory, to correlate the eclipse events with the sacredTzolkin. The Long Count dates mark a period froma.d.755 toa.d.1210, recording historical observa-tions from the Classic Maya period along with cur-rent observations made around the time the codexwas painted in the thirteenth century. The way thetable is structured also allows for future predictionsover long periods of time.CLASSIC PERIOD ECLIPSEIMAGERY AND EVENTSThe imagery of solar and lunar eclipses in the Classicperiod remains elusive. Santa Elena Poco Uinic Stela3 has the only known example (at B7) of an eclipseglyph of the type common in the Postclassic period.The associated date (9.17.19.13.16) coincides witha total eclipse on 7/16 /790, but only if you usethe 584,286 correlation (Kelley 1976 : 38; Louns-bury 1978 : 815 – 816). Clearly, this single inscrip-tion seems aberrant, and there must have been otherways of recording eclipses. Victoria and HarveyBricker (1995 : 97, fig. 2) note that a Classic periodlintel from the Nunnery Annex at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ re-cords a Kin glyph following a T1023 face that may beread aspaal u kin(the sun was broken), a form ofeclipse record also seen in the Dresden Codex eclipsetable.On Classic period monuments, eclipse intervalsare commonly recorded in the Lunar Series, whichcan refer to both lunar and solar eclipses (Aveni1980 : 163 –164). On the Hauberg Stela, dating to thesecond centurya.d., Glyph C at A5 bears a coeffi-cient of 17, providing the earliest known evidence ofthe eighteen-month lunar synodic period (Fig. 6.4c;Justeson 1989 : 87). John Linden’s (1996) analysis ofthe Lunar Series indicates that three deity head vari-ants of Glyph C record different six-month semes-ters (Fig. 4.1e). These deity head variants form a se-quence of three semesters of six synodic monthseach (totaling eighteen synodic lunar months), a cal-endar useful in keeping track of eclipses. Lindenpoints out that the period of 177 days (six synodicmonths) inherent in the Classic period Glyph C isvery close to the eclipse half-year of 173.31 days,which explains why Glyph C was recorded in cyclesof six months in the Classic period.Eclipse intervals were also recorded in dynastichistory. For example, Kelley (1989 : 72 – 83) notes thatChan Bahlum I’s birth and death dates are spaced atan interval of 21,320 days, commensurate with aneclipse interval (11,960 days plus 9,360 days).Actual eclipse records seem to be very rare. Kelley(1977a, fig. 1) notes that a solar eclipse correspondsto a 9.17.0.0.0 date associated with a star glyph and a‘‘split’’ sun and moon glyph at B20 on Stela E at Qui-rigua ́ (Monument 5). The eclipse was barely visibleat Quirigua ́ , because there was only a 4.7 percent ob-scuration beginning at 13 : 28 and ending at 15 : 14 on1/20/771. Despite the fact that the eclipse was barelyCLASSIC PERIOD ECLIPSE IMAGERY AND EVENTS115"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"at length later in the text, but here it is important topoint out that imagery of decapitated jaguars some-times may be linked with the date of a lunar eclipse,as on a Yaxchila ́ n lintel discussed later. (Fig. 4.2b).Architectural orientations may encode actual ob-servations of lunar standstills, which could be use-ful in predicting eclipses. The moon rises in thesame position once every 18.61 years (6,797 days;Aveni 1997 : 33,88). This interval is close to the Saroseclipse cycle, a cycle of similar eclipses that recursafter about 18.03 years (6,585.32 days; Aveni 1980 :100). Arnold Lebeuf (1995 : 260 – 261) points outthat the northern and southern limits in the moon’smonthly lunar motion are directly related to theecliptical longitude of the nodes, positions useful inpredicting eclipses. In the Maya area, Paalmul andEdzna ́ both have architectural orientations towardlunar extremes. The oval pyramid at Paalmul facesto the northwest, closely aligned with the northernstandstill that marks the northern extreme of themoon setting (3007488azimuth; Aveni 1980 : 270;Galindo 1994 : 143). At Edzna ́ , the sanctuary of thefive-storied pyramid has a similar orientation (Ga-lindo 1994 :168 –169; Malmstro ̈ m 1991: 45). This ho-rizon position is marked by the Northwest Pyramid(La Vieja), which in turn serves as an observationpost to watch the southern standstill over the five-storied pyramid known as Cinco Pisos. The pairingof structures to observe the horizon extremes is sig-nificant, because when the moon reaches a horizonextreme in a given month, in the next month it willreach the opposite extreme.Other forms of construction may have been usedto predict eclipses. An artificial cave with a zenithtube in the Osario at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ is intriguing,not only for its potential for solar observations butalso because lunar observations through such a tubecould help to predict eclipses, as at Xochicalco, acentral Mexican site of the Classic period that showsclear evidence of Maya influence (Lebeuf 1995; Mor-ante 1995).We can conclude that during the Classic periodthe Maya had architectural orientations that indi-cate an understanding of the Saros cycle. They couldpredict when there was the potential for an eclipse,visible, Linda Schele and Matthew Looper (1994)maintain that the monument records the eclipse be-cause it coincided with the Katun ending, and a lu-nar eclipse fifteen days later would have confirmed9.17.0.0.0 as an eclipse station. Using the 584,283correlation, Anthony Aveni and Lorren Hotaling(1994, table 1, n. 58) note the date is three days be-fore a visible solar eclipse and eighteen days before alunar eclipse.Linda Schele and Nikolai Grube (1995 : 39 – 40)recognize a number of war events on Lintel 3 of TikalTemple IV, some of which may be connected witheclipses, although no conventional eclipse glyphsare represented (Pl. 15). Using the 584,285 correla-tion, they link a solar eclipse on 7/25/743 with theday of a star-war event (at B4) on 11 Ik 15 Chen(9.15.12.2.2; 7/26 /743) recorded at B3 – C4. The starwar occurred one day after a visible solar eclipse.The star-war event, recorded as a star-over-shellglyph, is interpreted as a symbol of a war against thesettlement of Yaxha. Schele and Grube conclude thatgenerally the eclipse events at Tikal seem to precedethe war events, and they suggest that the war eventsmay have been stimulated by eclipses. It is note-worthy that the 11 Ik 15 Chen war event falls in therainy season, not the normal time of year for war-fare (Chapter 3). Astrological portents may haveprompted the Maya to go to war at a time of yearnormally reserved for agricultural activities.Aveni and Hotaling’s (1994 : S43) chi-square anal-ysis of Classic period dates recorded with astro-nomical glyphs or ‘‘tags’’ did not reveal a high cor-respondence with eclipse events using the 584,283correlation, but they note this does not mean thatsome of the dates were not intended to recordeclipses. Indeed, they were the first to point out thatthe 9.15.12.2.2 date on Lintel 3 follows shortly aftera visible total eclipse.Decapitation may also be part of Classic periodeclipse imagery. A jaguar is the agent of solar andlunar eclipses in a number of Colonial period andcontemporary accounts (Closs 1989), but in Classicperiod imagery, the jaguar seems to be the victim ofdecapitation, suggesting that he is the eclipsed body.The link between jaguars and the moon is discussed116LUNAR IMAGES AND DEITIES"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"but it is not clear whether they could actually pre-dict whether an eclipse would be visible in theirarea. Raids may have followed shortly after visiblesolar eclipses, especially at Tikal. The nature ofimagery and glyphs that symbolize Classic periodeclipses remains enigmatic, but there is some evi-dence that jaguar decapitation may represent lunareclipses. Surprisingly few secure eclipse records arepreserved on Classic Maya monuments, but this maybe because we do not fully understand the types ofglyphs used to designate eclipses.MAYA MOON GLYPHS AND SYMBOLSThe glyph for ‘‘moon’’ and the number twenty in thePostclassic period is T682 (Fig. 4.1c; Justeson 1984 :351). The T682 glyph bears a certain resemblance tosome Postclassic variants of the Yucatec day signMen, which depicts an aged face with an eye markedby dots and a pair of teeth covering the lower lip(Thompson 1960 : 89, fig. 9, no. 45). Thompson sug-gests that Men represents the aged Moon Goddess.If T682 symbolizes the aged goddess and the num-ber twenty, it may be because twenty days after themonth begins the moon is ‘‘old.’’ The twentieth dayof the month could correspond to the full moon ina count starting with the last day of visibility, or tothe waning moon in a lunar month beginning at thenew moon or first crescent. In terms of the phaserepresented by T682, it can be noted that an eclipsepanel on Dresden Codex 58b frames T682, whichsignals a lunar eclipse at the full moon (Pl. 3). Al-though William Ringle and Thomas Smith-Stark(1996) have reclassified T682 as a variant of T181, Ithink this may be premature in light of its role inlunar eclipse glyphs.The T682 moon face appears on a tin disk in aPostclassic offering from the Cenote of Sacrifice atChiche ́ n Itza ́ (Fig. 4.1o). Another metal offering ofapproximately the same size represents the sun as agilded copper disk embossed with the Kin glyph(Fig. 3.4d). The moon disk is darker and less shinythan the sun disk, evoking Aztec accounts that ex-plain why the moon is not as bright as the sun (Sa-hagu ́ n 1950 –1982, 7 : 7).Another lunar glyph common in the Postclassicperiod is the T171 curl, representing the phoneticsoundu(moon) in Friar Landa’s syllabary, usuallyinterpreted as the word for ‘‘moon’’ (Fig. 4.1j, left;Justeson 1984 : 328; Kurbjuhn 1989 : 32). As we willsee, T171 is used in the name of the Moon Goddess,and it has secondary associations with the earth andhoney, both connected with the moon. The T171 lu-nar glyph can be traced back to the Classic period inthe name Jaguar Moon Lord (Fig. 4.5g).The Postclassic Maya moon symbol is only rarelyrepresented as a crescent form. The lunar crescentis wrapped around the Moon Goddess on DresdenCodex 49a (Fig. 4.7i). A different form of lunar cres-cent appears on the New Year pages of the MadridCodex (37a) in a scene of a dog howling at the moon(Fig. 5.1i).The crescent moon appears on war shields in thearchitecture of Chiche ́ n Itza ́ during the Late Clas-sic and Terminal Classic periods. Shields decoratedwith crescent moons appear in reliefs from theNunnery (Bolles 1977 : 232). In the murals of theUpper Temple of the Jaguars, a chief standing witha feathered serpent carries a shield with multiplecrescents, and some of the enemy warriors carryshields with a single crescent moon (Coggins 1984,fig. 205; Tozzer 1957, fig. 60). The same temple’scornice reliefs depict shields with lunar cres-cents, perhaps representing a political group claim-ing affiliation with the moon (Fig. 5.5i; Milbrath1988b : 35).Shields with lunar symbols also appear on Clas-sic Maya images. An Early Classic double vessel de-picts a bird (a vulture or a quetzal-macaw?) with aT683 shield on its back; one wing bears a Kin glyphand the other a trefoil design, perhaps symbolizingthe Jester God (Coe 1989, fig. 14). At Copa ́n, anEarly Classic relief on the Margarita building, con-structed by Copa ́ n’s second ruler, depicts a T683aglyph on a shield beneath a macaw intertwined witha quetzal, forming a logograph for the name of thefounder, K’inich Yax K’uk’ Mo’ (G. Stuart 1997 :384 – 85).

Thompson(1962 : 285) lists only a few examples of T683c, allfrom Yaxchila ́ n and all with a T109 affix (‘‘red’’ or‘‘great’’). Carolyn Tate (1992, app. 3) reads these aspart of a title (he of twenty captives) used by Bird Jag-uar IV. The glyph for ‘‘captives’’ may have some lunarconnection, for Peter Mathews (1990 : 96) notes thatthe word ‘‘Bak,’’ used to designate captives, can alsomean ‘‘bone’’ or ‘‘heron,’’ and it also appears in thename of the mythical Moon Mother known as ZacBak at Palenque (Fig. 4.10e).T181 is used as a postfix attached to the mainglyph in verbs and in the Lunar Series Glyphs Cand D (Fig. 4.1a, e, f, right). The T181 postfix alsoappears in various names and titles and in the‘‘birth’’ glyph compound (Fig. 4.1n). Stephen Hous-ton (1997 : 292 – 293) proposes a phonetic readingofja(ha), regardless of position, revising earlierphonetic readings of bothahandha.Kathryn Josser-and (1995 : 293) interprets T181 as usually indicatingpassive voice in hieroglyphic texts.A doughnut-shaped glyph (T687a) means ‘‘moon’’(po) in Kekchı ́, Pokomchı ́, and Pokomam (Juste-son 1984 : 352; Taube 1992b : 67 – 68). T687a appearsin emblem glyphs and in the term ‘‘lord’’ (ah-po),where it possibly also has a lunar significance (Fig.4.1r – s). The Moon God on the Pearlman Trumpetsits on a throne marked with the glyphpo(Fig.4.5g). Hun Ahau and his lunar twin visit an under-world palace framed by mirrors marked withpoglyphs, an image that has been described as the‘‘House of Mirrors’’ (Taube 1992a : 58, fig. 3). Thepo-marked mirrors may symbolize a lunar mirrorlike the one described in ethnographic accounts(Chapter 1).In sum, the crescent design is one of the mostprominent lunar symbols in the Classic period. Bestknown in the glyphs T181 and T683, the crescentform was used to represent the moon in art imagesand in glyphic writing and calendars. The T687glyph is linked withpo,meaning ‘‘moon’’ in severalhighland Maya languages; it may be a special variantreferring to the moon in connection with rulership,for it frequently appears on thrones and in the ex-pression ‘‘lord.’’ In the Postclassic period, T171 rep-resents the word for ‘‘moon’’ in Yucatec Maya, andLunar Series (Fig. 4.1k, right). At Copa ́ n, however,the design is not part of a glyphic text, and it is ac-companied by a pair of footprints, a glyphic symbolthat goes back to Olmec times. The context isclearly astronomical because a sky band frames thescene and the Cosmic Monster wraps around theside. The macaw is a solar bird and the quetzal islinked with Venus; when joined with the lunar sym-bol, a triad of astronomical symbols is represented.The lunar crescent appears in a number of con-texts that are clearly astronomical. A T683 lunarcrescent flanks a jawless god on an astronomicalfrieze at Xunantunich dating to the Late Classic pe-riod (MacKie 1985, pl. 6). A Late Preclassic monu-ment from Kaminaljuyu ́ (Stela 25) depicts a celestialdeity riding on a lunar crescent above the open jawsof an earth monster, a composition not unlike IzapaStela 3 (Norman 1976, fig. 3.4; Parsons 1988 : 18,fig. 1.6).In the Classic period, a lunar crescent with asingle dot in the center (T683a) is read ask’al,meaning ‘‘twenty,’’ and it symbolizes the numbertwenty in Glyph A and Glyph E of the Lunar Series(Fig. 4.1b, left, 4.1g; Justeson 1984 : 351). The roleas the number twenty suggests links with the Post-classic T682, a glyph that also symbolizes the moonin a number of contexts (Fig. 4.1c). Despite this par-allel, most scholars do not attribute a lunar signi-ficance to any of the variants of T683 (Kurbjuhn1989). This seems illogical, in my opinion.T683b, a lunar crescent with multiple dots in thecenter, is usually read as the phonetic sign forah(Fig. 4.1b, center; Justeson 1984 : 351). It often sym-bolizes the moon in sky bands. In Rı ́o Azul Tomb 12,T683b represents the moon in the north or over-head direction (Fig. 3.2b). T683b also can substitutefor the Moon Goddess in her role as patroness ofthe month Chen (cenote) in Initial Series inscrip-tions (Fig. 4.1i). It obviously represents the moonin pictorial contexts, but oddly enough, the T683bglyph is not generally identified as a logograph for‘‘moon.’’The simple crescent form (T683c) has an undeter-mined meaning, and may not be the same glyph asthe other two variants, according to Justeson (1984 :351). Ringle and Smith-Stark (1996), however, do118LUNAR IMAGES AND DEITIES"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"an aged face (T682) apparently replaces variants ofthe Classic period T683 lunar crescent as a symbolfor the moon and the number twenty.LUNAR SYMBOLISM OF FISH, FROGS,TOADS, AND SHELLSFish, mollusks, toads, frogs, and water birds are allconnected with the moon, because the moon con-trols tides and all bodies of water on earth (Chap-ter 1). Croaking frogs signal rain, which is under thecontrol of the moon. One of the titles of the moonin Yucatec is Virgin Rain Frog (Edmonson 1982a :181). Thompson (1960 : 47 – 48) notes that the moon,frogs, and toads all bear the namepo,a lunar namein highland Mayan languages. There seems to be anatural connection between water, birth, and frogsand toads, because these animals give birth in a wa-tery environment. In light of the fact that the MoonGoddess oversees childbirth, according to contem-porary Maya accounts, it is noteworthy that theglyph for birth (T740) in the Classic Maya has beeninterpreted as a frog with a T181 postfix, a linguisticmarker for the passive voice, but its role in this com-pound is unclear (Fig. 4.1n). The ‘‘upended frog’’birth glyph may actually represent a salamander-likeanimal with teeth and gills (two attributes seen onthe glyphic head), an amphibian that lives in watersources in caves (Josserand and Hopkins 1993 : 41).In any case, the watery world of amphibians such assalamanders and frogs was probably closely relatedto the moon.The Yucatec Maya say that the moon disappearsinto a well during conjunction, implying that it dis-appears into a watery underworld. In the Initial Se-ries introductory glyph, the Moon Goddess appearsas the patroness of the month Chen, which means‘‘cave’’ or ‘‘cenote’’ (Fig. 4.1i, center; Thompson1960 : 111). Another variant of this glyph shows fishframing the Moon Goddess and her moon symbol(Fig. 4.1m).Sometimes the youthful Moon Goddess offersfish, a food resource especially associated with thetides controlled by the moon (Fig. 4.7e). Fish-eatingbirds may also be lunar symbols. A heron (T793)appears in the name for the ancestral Moon Goddessat Palenque (Fig. 4.10e). A similar bird, a variantof T793, oddly represented with teeth, substitutesfor the lunar rabbit in the Palenque emblem glyph(Fig. 4.1s; Schele 1977 : 52). The T793 glyph is usu-ally interpreted as a heron (Kurbjuhn 1989).THE MOON AND RABBITS119Thompson (1960 : 49, 133 –134, 173) notes thatthe conch symbolizes the Moon Goddess, night,darkness, water, and the earth or underworld, buthe points out that the shell is a generative symbolrelating to birth rather than death. The shell evokesa connection with the underworld, the place wherethe moon dies and is reborn. The Mixtec CodexNuttall depicts the rayed moon disk with a shell inthe center framed by the horseshoe-shaped lunarsymbol (Fig. 4.1p). The central Mexican Codex Tel-leriano-Remensis (folio 19r) tells us that a shell as-sociated with a lunar deity symbolizes the womb thatgives birth. Marine shells bring to mind the sea andtides controlled by the moon. The Moon Goddessframed by a lunar crescent on Dresden 49a poursseawater from a conch shell, linking the moon withthe tides and the sea. This scene recalls the GreatGoddess of Teotihuaca ́ n, with her lunar crescent is-suing seawater (Milbrath 1995a, 1996).This brief survey indicates that the Maya linkedthe moon with watery creatures, most notably toads,frogs, mollusks, fish, and fish-eating birds. The MoonGoddess controls the tides by pouring water from herconch shell in one Postclassic image. Another showsher offering fish from her watery domain. The moonand frogs are closely linked in Classic period glyphs,and metaphorical images allude to the moon’s con-trol over childbirth and rainfall. The Moon Goddessherself is patron of the month Chen, associated withthe watery world of caves and cenotes.THE MOON AND RABBITSPrecolumbian Maya people visualized the rabbit asan alter ego of the moon, an association that survivestoday among the Maya people, who see the image ofa rabbit on the face of the moon. When the moon isfull, it is possible to see the dark shape of a rabbit(Schele and Miller 1983, fig. 18d). The silvery colorof rabbits evokes the moon. Rabbits are more activearound dawn and dusk, and in hot weather they"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"may function logographically to describe a rabbit onthe surface of the moon (Fig. 4.1q; Schele and J. Mil-ler 1983 : 46). Here the lunar rabbit has ears that bearthe Etz’nab (Knife) sign, a detail repeated on Mayavase painting (Coe 1978b, no. 1). In Classic Mayarepresentations, the metaphor could have a doublemeaning referring both to the rabbit’s ears as knife-shaped and to a ‘‘knife-shaped’’ moon, perhapsdescribing the gibbous moon. The gibbous mooncould also be represented by a knife-moon in thecentral Mexican Codex Borgia (50).In sum, the characteristics metaphorically linkingthe rabbit to the moon include its silver color, cre-puscular activity, and proverbial fertility. It is notclear whether there was a specific phase associatedwith the lunar rabbit, but its image is most easilyseen on the full moon. The rabbit often appears inthe arms of a lunar deity, acting as a sort of alter ego.The lunar rabbit is best known from the Classic pe-riod. Although the Postclassic Maya codices do notshow clear evidence of the lunar rabbit, the traditionmust have lived on, given contemporary Maya ac-counts of the lunar rabbit.THE WATER-LILY JAGUARIn the Chilam Balam of Tizimin from Colonial pe-riod Yucata ́ n, the moon is called ‘‘jaguar head’’ (Ed-monson 1982b :187 –188). In the Quiche ́ area to thesouth,El Tı ́tulo de Totonicapa ́n(7v) identifies thejaguar twin, Xbalanquej, as the moon (Carmack andMondloch 1983 : 21). Among the major jaguar dei-ties of the Precolumbian Maya, the Water-lily Jaguar,identified by his water-lily head ornament, seems toexpress the moon’s connection with water (Fig. 4.2a,d, e). A good swimmer, the jaguar often stalks itsprey along waterways (Benson 1997 : 46). Its eyesglow in the darkness at night, and by day it sleeps incaves or crevices, seeming to hide from the light. Thejaguar’s nocturnal nature suggests a natural connec-tion with the moon, and jaguar spots suggest thestars of the night sky.On page 8a of the Postclassic Dresden Codex, theWater-lily Jaguar appears with a jaguar name glyph,prefixed by T109, the glyph for ‘‘red’’ or ‘‘great’’(Fig. 4.2a; Thompson 1972 : 35). On page 47 of theforage primarily at night, behavioral characteristicsrelated to the nocturnal world of the moon. Theprodigious fertility of rabbits indicates a lunar con-nection because of the moon’s association with fer-tility. Their gestation period of about a month mayalso indicate a correlation with the moon. Further-more, rabbits hop just like the moon, which jumpsforward each night as it moves through the back-ground of stars at the rate of about 13 degrees a day(Chapter 2).The lunar rabbit is rare in Postclassic Maya co-dices. The Postclassic Maya Moon Goddess does notappear with a lunar rabbit, which seems surprisingin light of contemporary Maya accounts that say therabbit is the pet of the Moon Goddess. An imageof the lunar rabbit may appear on Dresden Codex61, where a serpent biting a rabbit may allude toa lunar eclipse at the full moon. The rabbit is seenin a lunar crescent in Postclassic images depictingthe central Mexican Moon Goddess, Tlazolteotl(Fig. 4.9c).Although Thompson (1967 : 38) suggests that therabbit on the moon was a central Mexican conceptintroduced among the Maya during the Colonialperiod, there is ample evidence that the lunar rab-bit goes back to Classic Maya times. The lunar cres-cent frames a lunar rabbit on Bonampak Altar 2(Fig. 4.6a; Schele and Miller 1983 : 46). The Las Se-pulturas bench depicts a group of astronomical dei-ties, among which we find a lunar deity holding arabbit (Pl. 19). Jaina-style figurines show the MoonGoddess holding a rabbit (Miller 1975, fig. 9). On avessel from the American Museum of Natural His-tory, the Moon Goddess holds her lunar rabbit, andnearby a mirror-marked lunar rabbit with a boundhank of hair blows a shell trumpet (Fig. 4.10d; Scheleand Miller 1986 : 308).The lunar rabbit is especially prominent at Pa-lenque. A skeletal rabbit at the entry of Temple XIIhas led to its being designated as the ‘‘Temple of theDying Moon’’ (Robertson 1991 : 65). A variant ofthe Palenque emblem glyph with a skeletal rabbithead may be read as the ‘‘place of the dead moon’’(Fig. 4.1r; Schele 1977 : 55 –56). On the Tablet of the96 Glyphs from Palenque, a rabbit appears in thecenter of a lunar glyph, T181, in a compound that120LUNAR IMAGES AND DEITIES"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Venus pages, a wounded feline bears a vegetal headornament and a name glyph identifying him as theWater-lily Jaguar in the spearing phrase above theVenus god (Column E; Fig. 5.3b). Although this fe-line has a brown body, it clearly bears the same nameas the Water-lily Jaguar on Dresden 8a (Fig. 4.2a).In the layout of the Venus pages discussed in Chap-ter 5, the jaguar on page 47 represents the full moonspeared by the newly risen Morning Star on 8/26 /1222 during the rainy season. As we will see, imageryof the Water-lily Jaguar is associated with the rainyseason, when water lilies flower.Only a small number of Classic period monu-ments represent the Water-lily Jaguar, but each isworth investigating to study the pattern of seasonalimagery. Among the most impressive images is Lin-tel 3 of Temple I at Tikal (Fig. 3.6d). The jaguar’sname at D2 follows the date 12 Etz’nab 11 Zac (9/12 /695), indicating that this jaguar was invoked dur-ing the rainy season, when the water lilies bloomed.Lintels 6 and 43 at Yaxchila ́ n depict a Yaxchila ́nruler wearing a Water-lily Jaguar headdress, and theheaddress on Lintel 6 clearly has an astronomical as-pect because it has a star eye (Tate 1992, fig. 44). Thescene on both is a dance involving the display of GodK on a basket staff. Both Lintels 6 and 43 beara single date in mid-October, coinciding with therainy season (Tate 1992, app. 2).Yaxchila ́ n Lintel 26 shows the head of the Water-lily Jaguar, representing either a headdress or a de-capitated jaguar head (Fig. 4.2b). Shield Jaguar Iholds a knife in his right hand, suggesting that he cutoff the jaguar head to use it in a ritual or for a head-dress. Most of the dates on Lintel 26 fall in the rainyseason, suggesting the Water-lily Jaguar head maysymbolize the moon at the time of the rains. A frag-mentary Initial Series date, which Tate (1992 : 208)reconstructs as 9.14.14.13.16, corresponds to thesummer solstice in the 584,285 correlation, but usingthe preferred 584,283 correlation, it coincides with alunar eclipse that occurred on 6 /19/726 (Oppolzer1962). Thus the decapitated jaguar may refer to a lu-nar eclipse, correlating with other images of decapi-tation linked with lunar eclipses in central Mexico(Milbrath 1995b, 1997).A circular relief from La Esperanza (Chinkultic),Chiapas, depicts a ballplayer with a headdress bear-ing a water lily, a shell, and a jaguar tail (Fig. 4.2c).He also has a bound hank of hair and a headband,suggesting to Jeff Kowalski (1989 : 16 –17) that he islinked with the Headband Twins (Fig. 4.5b), theClassic period counterparts of the Hero Twins in thePopol Vuh. Kowalski also notes that the ballplayerplays with a ball inscribed with a Chicchan variantof the Ahau glyph (compare Fig. 3.10c). He inter-prets this as a reference to Hunahpu (Hun Ahau),suggesting parallels with the episode in the PopolVuh when Xbalanque uses Hunahpu’s head as a ball.The widespread ‘‘rolling head’’ myth, describing adecapitated head that moves around by rolling, linksdecapitation to the ball game and to the periodicityof the sun and the moon (Gillespie 1991 : 330). De-capitation imagery in the context of a ball court mayallude to eclipses in Aztec iconography, especiallyto those occurring at times of seasonal change (Mil-brath 1995b, 1997). An Initial Series inscription of9.7.17.12.14 on the border of the La Esperanza reliefcorresponds to 5/17/591, near the end of the dry sea-son. Although this is not an eclipse date, it is linkedwith seasonal transition.Some images of the Water-lily Jaguar in ceramicarts show a distinct relationship with the HeroTwins, who embody the sun and the moon. A platefrom Burial 190 at Tikal depicts an anthropomor-phic Water-lily Jaguar wearing a headband like theone worn by the Headband Twins (Coggins 1975,fig. 102; Valde ́ s et al. 1994 : 69). Ceramic paintingsclearly show the jaguar as the victim of decapita-tion, a theme seen in legends of the Hero Twins.Some pots show a decapitated Water-lily Jaguar head(Valde ́ s et al. 1994 : 69). On one vessel, his head isattached to a jaguar-skin pillow (Coe 1973, no. 13).The celestial nature of the Water-lily Jaguar is seenin Classic period ceramics depicting the jaguar sur-rounded by stars (Pl. 4). Other pots link the Water-lily Jaguar with sky bands. The pot known as Prince-ton 14 depicts the jaguar as one of three celestialcreatures in sky-band backracks worn by dancingfigures called the Holmul Dancers, alluding to simi-lar themes on vessels from the site of Holmul(Coe 1978b, no. 14). All the dancers are identical;only the enthroned figure in the sky band differs.THE WATER-LILY JAGUAR121"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The hieroglyphic name of the enthroned jaguar as IxBalam; the other two are 6 Sky and a monkey super-natural called 10 Chuen (Reents-Budet 1991 : 220 –221, figs. 1, 7). This assembly of gods is discussedfurther in Chapter 6.Ceramic vessels sometimes show the Water-lilyJaguar wrapped in water lilies (Fig. 4.2d). More oftenhe is identified only by a hornlike appendage thatseems to be the leaf and stem of a water-lily plant(Fig. 4.2e). Usually he wears a peculiar neck scarf de-scribed as the sacrificial scarf because it is sometimesassociated with scenes of sacrifice (Coe 1973 : 28). Inone such scene, the Water-lily Jaguar faces a deathgod who is decapitating himself (Pl. 4). Here a boawraps around the jaguar in a fashion almost identicalto images of the Moon Goddess discussed later. An-other Water-lily Jaguar wearing the sacrificial scarf isunusual because he bears a Kin sign on his chest ashe marches ahead of a snake (Fig. 4.2e; Coe 1973,no. 3). Images such as this one have led scholars toidentify the Water-lily Jaguar as the sun (Schele andMiller 1986 : 51). His name glyph (T832) on this ves-sel is a decapitated jaguar, a glyph sometimes inter-preted as a reference to an eclipse (Kurbjuhn 1989 :122). The combination of solar and lunar imagerycould suggest a lunar eclipse or lunar conjunction.Alternatively, the Kin-Jaguar image may allude to the‘‘jaguar sun,’’ a name for the moon in the Popol Vuh(D. Tedlock 1985 : 368 – 369).Dennis Tedlock suggests the jaguar is linked withthe full moon, but in my opinion, the jaguar can re-fer to the moon in all phases. A preliminary study ofthe decapitated jaguar glyph (T832) indicates that itis not consistently associated with dates that coincidewith specific lunar phases or with eclipses (full moonor new moon) in either of the two correlations. Forexample, on Yaxchila ́ n Stela 18, T832 appears with adate (7/8/729) falling around the first quarter.Images of jaguars with a rope around the neck,found beyond the central Maya area, may representa concept similar to the jaguars wearing the scarf ofsacrifice, all part of a lunar cult linked with jaguarsacrifice. Censers depicting jaguars with a knottedrope around the neck, found in the waters of LakeAmatitla ́ n, may symbolize the connection betweenwater, jaguars, and the moon (Berlo 1984, pls. 213 –215). This link is also apparent at Cacaxtla, a Classicperiod site in Tlaxcala that combines central Mexi-can and Mayan traits. Here murals depict two jaguarmen wearing ropes around their necks and pouringwater that cascades in droplets like rain (McVicker1985, figs. 3 – 4).FIG. 4.2.a:Water-lily Jaguar probably representing rainy-season moon (Dresden 8a; after Villacorta and Villacorta1977).b:Water-lily Jaguar representing either headdress ordecapitated jaguar head on Yaxchila ́ n Lintel 26 (after Tate1992b, fig. 18).c:Lunar ballplayer with headdress bearing water lily,shell, and jaguar tail on relief from La Esperanza (Chink-ultic), Chiapas (after Tozzer 1957, fig. 486).d:Water-lily Jaguar wrapped in water lilies and wearingscarf associated with sacrifice (after Robicsek and Hales1981, vessel 30).e:Water-lily Jaguar with Kin sign on his belly, probablyalluding to lunar eclipse or full moon as ‘‘jaguar sun’’ (af-ter Coe 1973b, no. 3).f:Jaguar War God, also known as Jaguar God of Num-ber Seven, probably representing dry-season moon (Lin-tel 2 of Temple IV at Tikal; after Jones 1977, fig. 12).g:War shield representing Jaguar War God, alsoknown as Jaguar God of Underworld (Late Classic Templeof the Sun, Palenque [see Fig. 3.6b]; after Robertson 1991,fig. 95).h:Jaguar War God shield, war equipment of SmokingSquirrel (Naranjo Stela 21; after Proskouriakoff 1950,fig. 32l).i:Two Jaguar War God heads are attached to starglyphs suspended from sky band (Yaxchila ́ n Stela 4; afterTate 1992, fig. 24c).j:Day sign Cib represented as Jaguar War God withnocturnal Akbal cheek marking and headband of Head-band Twins (Late Classic Yaxchila ́ n Lintel 48; after Tate1992, fig. 62).k:Sun God with Kin cheek and T646 solar flower onheadband also has traits of Jaguar War God, includingjaguar ear and cruller; two gods may be merged togetheras symbol of new moon (Tikal Stela 31; after Hellmuth1987, fig. 650).THE WATER-LILY JAGUAR123"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"into the earth. Here the lunar connection may bethrough the world of frogs. He is also the patron ofthe number seven and sometimes appears with thatnumber inscribed on his cheek (Fig. 4.2f ).Linda Schele and Mary Miller (1986 : 50 –51)point out that the cruller-nosed jaguar god (JGU)sometimes has the same Roman nose, scalloped eye-brows, square eyes, and pointed front tooth as GI ofthe Palenque Triad, who apparently represents Ve-nus (Chapter 5). The only difference they note is thatthe jaguar’s scroll-eye form extends upward from thelower lid rather than downward, as on GI. The Jag-uar War God may embody a conceptual pairing be-tween the Moon and Venus, often seen together inthe sky. He appears with star glyphs that may repre-sent Venus in the East Court at Copa ́ n and on Stela 4at Yaxchila ́ n (Fig. 4.2i; Miller 1988 : 175). AlthoughVenus may be significant in the imagery of the Jag-uar War God, preliminary study does not reveal aconsistent pattern of specific kinds of Venus events.There is, however, a notable clustering of the datesin the dry season.Aguateca Stela 2, prominently depicting a JaguarWar God shield, bears the date 8 Kan 17 Muan(9.15.4.6.4; 11/27/735; Houston 1993, fig. 4-20). Thisdate is linked with a star-war event coinciding withthe heliacal rise of the Evening Star (Aveni and Ho-taling 1994, table 2).A sky band with seven Jaguar War God faces ap-pears on Yaxchila ́ n Stela 10, a monument bearing adate tentatively reconstructed as 10 Chen 18 Pop(9.16.15.0.0; 2 /13/766; Tate 1992 : 233, fig. 130c).On this date, the Morning Star and the Moon wereabout to disappear in conjunction.Naranjo Stela 21 represents Smoking Squirreldressed with the nose cruller and shield of the JaguarWar God (Maler 1908, pl. 35; Proskouriakoff 1993 :73 –74). The monument bears a dry season date(9.13.14.4.2 8 Ik 0 Zip; 3/22 /706). This date, just fol-lowing the spring equinox, marks a time when Venuswas in conjunction with Mars and the waxing cres-cent Moon was in conjunction with Saturn, thus Ve-nus and the Moon were engaged in similar events.Another dry-season date (9.13.15.0.0; 12 /25/706) onthe monument coincides with the last visibility ofthe Morning Star just following the winter solstice.We can conclude that jaguars embody the moonin a number of contexts, and one of the clearest ex-pressions of the relationship is seen in the Water-lilyJaguar of Classic and Postclassic times. He often isassociated with sacrifice by decapitation. Althoughthe Classic monuments provide only a limited sampleof dates useful in interpreting imagery of the Water-lily Jaguar, most of the dates coincide with the rainyseason, which explains why the Water-lily Jaguar iscrowned by rainy season vegetation.THE JAGUAR WAR GODA jaguar god, known only from the Classic period,seems to embody a more warlike deity frequently rep-resented on war shields. He has the Roman nose andegg tooth (the central notched or filed tooth) of theSun God, but he can be distinguished by his ‘‘cruller’’nose ornament, scroll eye, and jaguar ears; often healso has a bound hank of hair (Fig. 4.2g; Coe 1973 :83). Thompson (1960 : 11, 107, 134) originally namedthis deity the Jaguar God of the Underworld (JGU),the sun in the underworld or the night sun, designat-ing him as a deity of ‘‘night, darkness, and the inte-rior of the earth.’’ This jaguar god is connected withthe day sign Akbal, meaning ‘‘night,’’ according toThompson (1960 : 74, table 4). Many scholars havesupported Thompson’s interpretations. Nevertheless,in a number of contexts this jaguar god appears in thesky overhead rather than in the underworld. MaryMiller (1988 : 175 n. 29) notes that his associationswith the underworld are no stronger than for anyother deity, and in fact he is more closely connectedwith war. In this light, it may be more appropriate tocall him the Jaguar War God. His lunar character isapparent in his role as a manifestation of the moonin Glyph C of the Lunar Series (Fig. 4.1e, center).On Yaxchila ́ n Lintel 48, the Jaguar War Godstands for the day sign Cib, his nocturnal aspectnoted with an Akbal cheek marking, and his head-band evokes a connection with the Jaguar Hero Twinrepresented on Classic period ceramics (Fig. 4.2j;Tate 1992, fig. 62). The Jaguar War God may alsoappear as the patron of the month Uo, a monthname that Thompson (1960 : 107 –108) notes is thesame as the name for a small black frog that burrows124LUNAR IMAGES AND DEITIES"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"On Yaxchila ́ n Stela 4, two Jaguar War God headsare attached to star glyphs that hang from a skyband (Figs. 4.2i, 4.10b).

On top of the sky band, another beardedJaguar War God appears between two ancestors, onea female framed in a lunar symbol, the other a malein a mirror cartouche that probably represents thesun disk.A dry-season association is also seen in the InitialSeries date on Stela 1 at Yaxchila ́ n, a monument thatdepicts two faces of the Jaguar War God hangingfrom a sky band (Fig. 3.8d; Tate 1992, app. 2). Thisperiod-ending date, 9.16.10.0.0 1 Ahau 3 Zip (3/11/761), falls in a very dry time of year. It is also the dayof the new moon, but the lunar phase does not seemto be significant in the imagery of Jaguar War Gods.Generally there is no consistent pattern linking theJaguar War God with a specific lunar phase.The Jaguar War God is represented on war shieldswith some frequency on monuments bearing dry-season dates. Aguateca Stela 2, Bonampak Stela 1,Naranjo Stela 21, Yaxchila ́ n Lintel 3 and Stela 11,and the Palenque Temple of the Sun all record dry-season dates (Fig. 4.2g – h; Mathews 1980, fig. 3;Proskouriakoff 1950, figs. 32, k, l, p, r). Three ofthese also note rainy-season dates, but the JaguarWar God’s association with the dry season is madeclear in the Temple of the Sun. Here, the dry-seasondate (8 Oc 3 Kayab; 1/5/684) is positioned just abovethe jaguar shield (Fig. 3.6b). Indeed, among all themonuments tested with similar shields, all but one(Calakmul Stela 89) bears a dry-season date.The Jaguar War God embodies the number sevenin the full-figure glyphs used at some sites, and some-times the god himself is inscribed with the numberseven. Lintel 2 of Temple IV at Tikal depicts an an-thropomorphic Jaguar God of the Number Seven,with the number inscribed on his cheek (Fig. 4.2f;Jones 1977, fig. 12, table 1). Schele and Grube (1995 :42 – 43) read a glyph compound at B12 — a jaguarhead paired with the sun glyph — as K’in Balam or‘‘sun jaguar,’’ referring to the jaguar protector. Thetext on Lintel 2 has four Calendar Round dates, butthe one at B8 associated with a star-war event on7 Ben 1 Pop (9.15.12.11.13; 2 /2 /744) seems to belinked with the jaguar name. The Jaguar War God isthe patron of dry-season warfare. This date is also theday of the full moon, a phase that is linked with thejaguar, according to a contemporary Quiche ́Mayaaccount (Chapter 1; D. Tedlock 1985 : 369).In the crook of his arm, Stormy Sky (K’awilChaan) holds a head with traits of the Jaguar WarGod on Tikal Stela 31 (Fig. 3.7b). A Tikal emblemglyph on the jaguar head indicates that this deity isespecially important to the lineage of Tikal. Its jaguarear and headband point to a link with the JaguarHeadband Twin; however, the cruller nose is that ofthe Jaguar War God. Linda Schele and David Freidel(1990 : 211) identify the head as the jaguar god of theHero Twins. The jaguar head on Stela 31 has alsobeen identified as the severed head of an ancestor(A. Miller 1986 : 46). It may actually represent a sev-ered jaguar head, part of the complex of decapitatedjaguar imagery linked with the moon. Stela 31’s Ini-tial Series date (9.0.10.0.0; 10/16 /445) correlates withthe new moon, when the moon disappeared in con-junction. In central Mexico, decapitation can sym-bolize the moon losing its head during conjunctionor during a lunar eclipse (Milbrath 1995b, 1997).Another head on Stormy Sky’s belt ornament rep-resents the Sun God with traits of the Jaguar WarGod (Fig. 4.2k). Attributes of the Sun God includea Kin-flower (T646) headband, rectangular crossedeyes, and the Kin sign on the cheek. It also has acruller nose and jaguar ears like the Jaguar WarGod. This head has been interpreted as the sun inthe underworld (A. Miller 1986 : 46; Schele and Mil-ler 1986 : 50, fig. 35). Nicholas Hellmuth (1987 : 369,fig. 650) identifies the head as a conflation of Ah Kin,patron of the number four, and the Jaguar War God,patron of the number seven. Here the sun may ap-pear with the traits of a lunar god because the twobodies are in conjunction, as indicated by the InitialSeries date.The Jaguar War God is also represented on EarlyClassic architecture. Tikal Structure 5D-22-3rd de-picts a cruller-nosed mask that resembles the JaguarWar God. Arthur Miller (1986 : 39, 49, fig. 11) iden-tifies this as Kinich Ahau, but it is clearly an EarlyTHE JAGUAR WAR GOD125"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"1982 : 42, no. 15). Perhaps this image depicts a lunareclipse or the new moon. Michael Coe (1978b : 34,no. 4) identifies a reclining jaguar baby on the Met-ropolitan Museum vase as the Jaguar God of the Un-derworld, the counterpart of our Jaguar War God(Pl. 8). A 7 Muluc 7 Kayab date on the vessel may beof astronomical significance, according to Coe. ThisCalendar Round date correlates with a dry-seasondate throughout the Classic period, and if the potdates near the beginning of the Late Classic, theCalendar Round coincides with the new moon (1/23/627), when the moon ‘‘lost its head’’ as it joinedthe sun in conjunction. This may be why the jaguarhas some solar traits, such as the squint eyes of theSun God.In sum, the Jaguar War God is associated with thedry season, the epoch of warfare. His lunar aspectappears on Glyph C of the Lunar Series. His imageoften appears on war shields in the central Mayaarea, perhaps the counterpart for lunar crescents onwar shields in the northern Maya lowlands. Dates onmonuments with the Jaguar War God do not consis-tently correlate with a specific lunar phase, but themajority coincide with the dry season. Monumentsdepicting the Jaguar War God often bear dates thatcoincide with Venus events, but there is no clear pat-terning in this respect. Perhaps the Jaguar War Godand Venus are directly connected (Chapter 5). InClassic period ceramics, the Jaguar War God’s war-like aspect is less pronounced, and he is more closelylinked with the ball game and decapitation imagery.THE JAGUAR PADDLER:THE MOON PAIRED WITH THE SUNThe Jaguar Paddler may represent the moon pairedwith the sun in scenes that show the two paddlingor engaged in similar activities. In some sense, heis a counterpart of the Jaguar War God (Hellmuth1987 : 368, fig. 626; Stuart 1988 : 189). Both deitiesare known only from the Classic period, and they areclosely related to the lunar jaguar, Yax Balam, laterknown as Xbalanque (see below). The jaguar-spottedClassic form of the Jaguar War God. A lunar con-nection is reinforced by the T683 moon glyph belowthe head.In the realm of the ceramic arts, the Jaguar WarGod is especially popular in the Late Classic period.At Palenque, incense-burner stands represent an-thropomorphic, fleshed zoomorphic, or skeletal zoo-morphic forms of the god (Freidel and Schele 1988 :63 – 64). These flanged stands are usually found dis-carded at the rear of temples, cached in the terracesof temple substructures, or placed in regional caves.Perhaps they were used in fire ceremonies performedannually or at the end of important calendar cyclessuch as Katuns and Calendar Rounds.A Jaina figurine depicts the Jaguar War God seatedon the earth monster represented by a crocodilian,flanked by two Venus glyphs (Miller 1975). This im-age may represent the crescent Moon and Venus po-sitioned together on the horizon, a pairing that cancommonly be seen around dawn or dusk.On the Vase of the Seven Gods, the Jaguar WarGod is at the head of two rows of gods paying hom-age to God L, who is seated on a jaguar-skin throne(Pl. 7). The Jaguar War God gestures in submissionwith one arm and rests the other on the earth-starbundle. His name glyph, mentioned last in the text,has a jaguar ear, the distinctive cruller nose, andan Akbal (night) marking on the cheek (Coe 1973 :108 –109, no. 49). As we will see, he is part of anassembly of gods representing the Sun, the Moon,and five naked-eye planets (Chapters 5 and 6).The Jaguar War God appears in other astronomi-cal scenes on painted ceramics. A vase depicting aball game represents a black Jaguar War God stand-ing on the head of Hunahpu, a scene that surely hasastronomical symbolism (Coe 1982 : 32, no. 10). Onanother pot, two identical figures of the Jaguar WarGod tip jars over (Coe 1982 : 40, no. 14). Instead ofcontaining water, the jars seem to issue volutes ofsmoke, perhaps indicating the empty water jars of thedry season. The two are distinguished only by theirthrones, one a Cauac throne and the other a thronewith crossed bands, possibly designating two differ-ent positions in the sky.The Jaguar War God is a decapitated head held inthe beak of the Muan bird on a painted vase (Coe126LUNAR IMAGES AND DEITIES"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"paddler travels in a canoe with another deity calledthe Stingray Paddler, characterized by a stingrayspine bloodletter piercing his nose (Fig. 4.3a). Scheleand Freidel (1990 : 413) refer to the Paddler Twins asthe Old Stingray God of the day and the Old JaguarGod of the night.Tikal bone MT38a from Burial 116 shows the Jag-uar Paddler at the prow of a canoe and the StingrayPaddler at the stern (Fig. 4.3a). The notion of the twotraveling in a canoe suggests a trip through the wa-tery underworld. David Freidel et al. (1993, figs. 2 :25, 2 : 26) propose that the canoe is the Milky Way.In this light, it is worth investigating whether theMilky Way is involved in some way with imagery ofthe Paddler Twins. As we will see in Chapter 7, theMilky Way may be a divine river in some contexts,and a canoe is required for the crossing. Scholarsdo not agree on the Long Count equivalent for theCalendar Round date (6 Akbal 11 Zac) recorded onthe bone, so it is premature to discuss any possiblerelationship with astronomical events involving theMilky Way.Patterns of substitution in glyphic passages indi-cate that the Paddler Twins are paired in Kin andAkbal texts: the Akbal glyph can substitute for theJaguar Paddler, and the Kin glyph for the StingrayPaddler (Schele and Miller 1986, fig. 40; Stuart 1984,fig. 9). David Stuart (1988 : 190, fig. 5.19) notes thattheir hieroglyphic names can be represented withportrait glyphs and specific suffixes, or the glyphsKin and Akbal can substitute for the portrait heads.The Jaguar Paddler is named with the Akbal glyphand anasuffix, an intriguing combination becauseAkbal andnatogether approximate the name ofthe Lacando ́ n Moon Goddess (Akna or A ̈kna’;Chapter 1). It also should be noted that Kin is pairedwith Akbal in specific contexts that seem to refer tothe moon, as on the Early Classic Tikal Stela 31,where the text at B9-A10 shows the lunar Glyph Dfollowed by Glyph E as a reference to the new moonon 9.0.10.0.7 (Jones 1984 : 55). An early pairing ofKin and Akbal is seen on the wings of a Late Pre-classic bird deity on Kaminaljuyu ́ Altar 10 (Parsons1988 :15, fig. 1.3). And in the Postclassic period, wesee Kin paired with Akbal in texts associated with theaging Moon Goddess on Dresden Codex 39b and67a (discussed below). Akbal can also appear in thecenter of a lunar-eclipse glyph, as on Dresden Codex45b (Fig. 6.1a, over third sky beast).On Ixlu Stela 2, the floating Paddler Twins ap-pear as ‘‘cloud riders’’ (Fig. 4.3b). The associateddate is the Katun ending 10.1.0.0.0 5 Ahau 3 Kayab(11/24 /849). This Katun ending was marked by a‘‘scattering rite,’’ possibly a blood offering, whenVenus was the Evening Star near its maximum alti-tude (Aveni and Hotaling 1994, table 1; Schele andFreidel 1990 : 446). The Sun was crossing the MilkyWay in Scorpius, and the waxing Moon was posi-tioned at a distance in Aquarius. As we will see, thedates on the Paddlers monuments studied here sug-gest an association with the dry season (late Novem-ber to late May), and many can be linked to timeswhen either the Sun or the Moon were positioned inthe Milky Way.Although the Paddlers are not represented as amain theme on Dos Pilas Stela 14 (formerly Stela25), the text refers to the birth of the Paddler Twins(Houston 1993 : 111, tables 3-1, 4-1, fig. 3.24; Stuart1984 : 14; 1988 : 192). Their birth is recorded on theInitial Series date 9.14.0.0.0 6 Ahau 13 Muan, a Ka-tun ending (11/29/711). The Sun was in Scorpius,crossing the Milky Way, and the Moon was also inthe Milky Way in Taurus. The date coincides with theday of the full Moon, locking the Katun ending to alunar event. Eight Katuns later the period wouldend on the new Moon, recorded on Jimbal Stela 1,another monument that bears the Paddlers (Stuart1984 : 11, fig. 7a). This interplay of the lunar cycleson a Paddlers monument marking the Katun endingcertainly merits study in the future.Another Paddler text appears on Copa ́ n Stela6 (Fig. 5.8e; Maudslay 1889 –1902, pls. 105 –107;Schele 1987c; 1989b : 32, 93). An Initial Series dateof 9.12.10.0.0 9 Ahau 18 Zotz (5/5/682) is followedby 8 Ahau, probably referring to the close of theKatun at 9.13.0.0.0 8 Ahau 8 Uo (3/13/692). ThePaddlers are mentioned just following the 8 Ahaudate ending the Katun. On this date, the waningMoon was crossing the Milky Way in Scorpius,positioned overhead at dawn, when all five planetscould be seen strung out like beads on a chain downto the eastern horizon.

The Jag-uar Paddler on the left has the cruller nose of theJaguar War God. Stela P bears a Lahuntun endingdate of 9.9.10.0.0 2 Ahau 13 Pop (3/16 /623), a timewhen the waxing Moon was in Cancer, just emergingfrom the Milky Way. The proximity to the springequinox may also have been of interest.Stela 7, another Copa ́ n monument erected byButz’ Chan, also shows the Paddler Twins in thejaws of the double-headed serpent bar (Schele 1987c,fig. 5a). The text names the Jaguar Paddler and theStingray Paddler three times. The first text representsthe Jaguar Paddler with a jaguar headdress and theStingray Paddler with a Xoc fish headdress and a Kincartouche on his forehead (Schele 1987c, fig. 8a).Another mention of the Paddlers occurs at C8-D8,followed by a third text at F2, where the Jaguar isinscribed with Akbal on his cheek as a reference tothe night and Kin appears on the cheek of the Sting-ray Paddler (Fig. 4.3c). The only date is an Initial Se-ries inscription recording the Katun ending 9.9.0.0.03 Ahau 3 Zotz (5/7/613), when the waning Moonwas in Libra, at the edge of the Milky Way, and theSun was passing through the Milky Way in Taurus.One of the earliest known images of the Paddlersis seen on the Tikal ball-court marker dating toa.d.378 (Schele and Freidel 1990, fig. 4 : 19). TheSun God is paired with an Akbal-browed figure ina compound that seems to refer to the PaddlerTwins. There follows the name of an enigmatic godwith his eyes covered by a trident design, not unlikethe head in the serpent’s jaw on the Hauberg Stela(Fig. 6.4c). Instead of the Katun or Lahuntun endingdates seen on most of the Paddlers monuments dis-cussed above, the ball-court marker bears an InitialSeries date of 8.17.1.4.12 11 Eb 15 Mac (1/13/378).The waning Moon was in Sagittarius, crossing theMilky Way, and the Sun was nearby in Capricorn atthe edge of the Milky Way (Chapter 7).Schele (1992b : 123 –124) suggests that the Pad-dlers are personifications of night and day at thefirst moments of creation. She translates a passageon Quirigua ́ Stela C as ‘‘they seated the stone, thePaddler Gods, it happened at House Five-Sky, Jag-uar-Throne-Stone.’’ This is part of a larger text thatrefers to the original creation of the universe on4 Ahau 8 Cumku. She proposes that the Paddlers arethe artists who drew the constellations in the sky,the counterparts for the Shaper and the Modelerin the Popol Vuh, two of the original creator gods(Schele 1992b :140). However, if the Stingray Pad-dler somehow represents the sun, as proposed here,this scenario seems unlikely. In the creation epics ofMesoamerica, the sun appears relatively late in thenarrative sequence dealing with the creation of theuniverse (Taube 1993).The Paddler Twins appear only rarely in ceramicarts. A Late Classic vessel from Duke University’s col-lection shows the Paddlers in separate canoes posi-tioned in quatrefoil designs that may represent acavelike entry to the underworld (Fig. 4.3f; Reents-FIG. 4.3.a:Jaguar Paddler at prow and Stingray Paddlerat stern, part of assembly of seven gods on incised bones(MT38a) from tomb of HaSawa Chaan K’awil (Burial 116at Tikal; after Schele and Miller 1986, fig.

Tedlock 1985 : 158 –160). Then they riseup to become the sun and the moon. Their ascentseems to be linked to their being burned in an oven,echoing an Aztec legend of how the sun and themoon were created when they rose up from a hearthfire at Teotihuaca ́ n (Sahagu ́ n 1950 –1982, 7 : 3 –7).The Popol Vuh says the twin boys are transformedinto the sun and the moon, but it does not spec-ify which is which (D. Tedlock 1985 : 160). On theother hand,El Tı ́tulo de Totonicapa ́n(7v) states thatXbalanquej is a female ballplayer who is the moon(Carmack and Mondloch 1983 : 21, 28 – 29, 174, 213n. 74). Dennis Tedlock (1985 : 368 – 369) notes: ‘‘Ifthe name Xbalanque literally means ‘Little JaguarSun’...itcould refer specifically to the full moon,which is metaphorically called ‘sun’ by contempo-rary Quiche ́ s.’’ Karen Bassie-Sweet (1992 : 190 –191)finds Tedlock’s interpretation convincing and addsthat the jaguar is a good counterpart for the fullmoon because he emerges from a den at sunset andretreats at dawn, just like the full moon.The ballplaying Hero Twins decapitate each otherin the Popol Vuh (D. Tedlock 1985 : 150, 153). Thistype of act suggests eclipse imagery, which wouldinvolve the new moon in the case of a solar eclipseand the full moon during a lunar eclipse. Xbalanquedecapitating his twin brother would play the role ofthe new moon covering the sun’s light during a solareclipse. But Hunahpu decapitating Xbalanque sug-gests a lunar eclipse, indicating the phase would bethe full moon. The full moon is a natural ‘‘twin’’ ofthe sun, similar in both size and shape, and its mo-tions mirror those of the sun, for the full moon risesas the sun sets, and vice versa. The seasonal motionsof the full moon are like those of the rising sun, butthey take place at the opposite side of the sky in theopposite season.God CH is the Postclassic counterpart ofXbalanque (Fig. 4.4e – g; Taube 1992b : 63). Usually,God CH has a jaguar-spotted mouth like that of Te-peyollotl, the central Mexican jaguar god who is analter ego of Tezcatlipoca in his lunar aspect (Milbrath1995a). God CH is sometimes merged with the Ton-sured Maize God, evoking Xbalanque’s role as amaize farmer (Fig. 4.4e; Taube 1992b : 60). Otherroles seen in the Popol Vuh are not prominent in theBudet 1994, fig. 6.47). An Early Classic cache vesselfrom Tikal shows the Paddler Twins at oppositeends of an undulating double-headed serpent heldby the Maize God (Fig. 4.3d). These two heads havebeen interpreted as the rising and setting Sun, ornight and day (Coggins 1980; Schele 1992b :150).I would suggest instead that the image depicts theSun and the Moon as they are passing througha double-headed serpent that represents the MilkyWay (Chapter 7).We can conclude that the Paddler Twins mayrepresent a conceptual pairing of the sun and themoon, but no specific lunar phase is implicated inthe pairing. In Late Classic times, the Paddlers mostoften are associated with period-ending rites mark-ing Katun endings or Lahuntun endings. Paddlerstexts on monuments from Tonina ́ and Piedras Ne-gras (Schele 1987c, 1989b : 32) are not analyzed here,but the sample of monuments studied indicates apattern of dates that fall in the dry season, most oftencoinciding with times when the Sun or the Moonwas crossing the Milky Way. As we will see, the MilkyWay seems to be significant in the imagery of thePaddler Twins (Chapter 7).THE LUNAR TWIN: XBALANQUEThe best-known lunar jaguar is Xbalanque, pairedas a twin of the sun in the Popol Vuh, the sameway we see the Paddler Twins paired as representa-tions of the sun and the moon in Maya art. In theancient Quiche ́ tale of the Popol Vuh, Hunahpu andXbalanque are twin brothers who are blowgun hunt-ers. In one episode they shoot down a bird pretend-ing to be the sun. Subsequently, they take the role ofmaize farmers using magical farming implements,but they find that farming is not their natural voca-tion. They become ballplayers, using the equipmentof their dead father and uncle. As they are playingball, the noise annoys the lords of the underworld(Xibalba), and they summon the twins to the landof death. Before the twins go, they plant maize toserve as a sign of their fate in the underworld. Even-tually their grandmother sees the corn dry up whenthey are burned in an oven in Xibalba, but the cornplants grow again when the twins defeat the lords of130LUNAR IMAGES AND DEITIES"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"codices. Only one Postclassic image seems to showGod CH wearing a ball-game belt (Fig. 4.4g). Onlyone scene shows him with Hun Ahau, the counter-part of Hunahpu (Fig. 4.4h).God CH is one of four gods marking the cosmicquarters around a world tree on Dresden Codex 3a(Fig. 4.4h). His name glyph has a jaguar-spottedmouth, but instead of the usual Yax prefix, here hisportrait head has a prefix of one (Fig. 4.4b). He ispositioned diagonally opposite a partially effaced fig-ure of Hun Ahau, or God S (Coe 1989 : 179, fig. 28;Taube 1992b :115). God K and the Maize God markthe other two directions. In the center, the worldtree grows out of the gaping abdominal wound of asacrificed individual resting on the earth monster.The astronomical symbolism remains enigmatic butdoes bear some resemblance to the Codex Feje ́ rva ́ ry-Mayer 1, which positions the solar and lunar deitiesat opposite sides of a cosmic diagram, with the othertwo directions marked by the Maize God and Tez-catlipoca, the counterpart of God K (Fig. 4.4i).God CH’s Postclassic name usually has ayaxpre-fix and a head with a jaguar-spotted mouth, prob-ably signifyingyax balam,a name retained from theClassic period (Figs. 4.4a, d, e, 4.5d; Coe 1989 : 168,fig. 8; Schele and Freidel 1990 : 117). He is the Chic-chan God, and he has a Chicchan marking like theday sign Chicchan, associated with a celestial snake(Thompson 1960, table 4). The spoked Chicchansign crowning his head is usually crosshatched like anet, but occasionally it is marked by three spots(Fig. 4.4b).Yax Balam is the Classic period counterpart ofXbalanque and God CH of the codices. In calendarrecords he is the jaguar-spotted god of the numbernine (Figs. 4.4d, 4.5a). This link is intriguing becausepersonified numbers may represent an ancient lunarcount (Macri 1982 : 18, 49 –54). He can substitute forthe Moon Goddess in the Classic period lunar GlyphC (Kelley 1976 : 92, fig. 32). It is noteworthy that,aside from Yax Balam’s role as the number nine, thisdeity is not well represented in monumental sculp-ture. Indeed, he is seen primarily in ceramics andcave paintings.The Hero Twins appear in the deep recesses of thecave at Naj Tunich, the jaguar twin clearly markedby body patches with jaguar spots (Fig. 4.5b; Stone1995b :149). Both twins have a bound hank of hairand they are seated in a similar fashion. Hunahpuwears a ball-game belt and clusters of three spots onhis cheek and body. These seem to be variant formsof the single death spot more often seen on thisdeity. He touches his lunar twin, whose eyes seem tobe closed in death. The death aspect of the lunardeity could indicate the new-moon phase or a lu-nar eclipse. The Hero Twins together in a caveappear to be fellow travelers to the underworld,bringing to mind modern accounts of the new moondisappearing to a cave in conjunction (Chapter 1).Xbalanque’s connection with the night and the un-derworld is made clear in an account by Antonio deFuentes y Guzma ́ n, who records that in the Guate-malan highlands the dead were buried at night, whenofferings were made to Ixbalanque so that he wouldaccompany the deceased (Ruz 1968 : 68).The Hero Twins are known as the HeadbandTwins in Classic period ceramics (Taube 1992b : 60,63). Hun Ahau, the solar Headband Twin, seemssomehow also linked with the Morning Star (Chap-ter 3). The Headband Twins appear with some fre-quency in scenes related to maize agriculture. Sincethe Headband Twins embody the sun and the moon,their association with maize is very appropriatein light of contemporary Maya beliefs about therole the sun and the moon play in maize agricul-ture (Chapter 1). The Headband Twins hold diggingsticks that resemble paddles as their companion, theMaize God, rises out of a bowl that looks curiouslylike a canoe (Fig. 4.5f; Hellmuth 1987, figs. 444, 446).This suggests some conceptual overlap in the im-agery of paddling and planting. In another scene, theHero Twins pull up the Maize God from a crack ina turtle shell (Fig. 3.11a). A parallel scene on a vesselknown as the Resurrection Vase depicts the Head-band Twins flanking the Maize God —who appar-ently is the counterpart of Hun Hunahpu, the fatherof the Hero Twins in the Popol Vuh — as he sproutsfrom a turtle shell marked with an Akbal sign signal-ing darkness (Fig. 3.11b; Coe 1989 : 177 –178).

Another vessel depicts the twins holdingoverturned vases from which issue different kindsof snakes, here reflecting an archetypal metaphor,for the undulating body of a snake suggests a streamof water (Fig. 4.5c; Benson 1997 : 109).A court scene depicts the spotted Headband Twin(Hun Ahau), the Maize God, and the lunar twin, hisjaguar markings now eroded (Coe 1978b, no. 2).The three gods have come to pay homage to an en-throned male wearing a headdress representing thelily-pad monster, not unlike the glyphic sign forturtle (ak’;Houston 1989 : 40). This may be oneof a number of scenes representing the Sun andthe Moon, the cycles of maize cultivation, and theturtle constellation located in the stars of Orion(Chapter 7).A variety of intriguing scenes hint at other celes-tial events involving the Headband Twins. On onepot, the twins dance around a water-lily monsterwith a Kan Cross on its brow, like the deity at thebase of the celestial cross in the Temple of the Foli-ated Cross at Palenque (Fig. 4.5e; Pl. 11). The HunAhau twin adopts the pose sometimes used by ball-players, although in this case he lacks the ball-gamebelt. Nonetheless, the headband itself may be a suf-ficient link with the game, for the Popol Vuh speci-fies that the headband is part of the equipmentneeded to play ball (D. Tedlock 1985 : 340).A polychrome plate depicts the lunar HeadbandTwin, Yax Balam, seated on a throne formed by twopoglyphs (Coe 1989 : 176, fig. 24; Hellmuth 1987,fig. 435). Coe identifies the double-pothrone as asymbol forpop,meaning ‘‘mat’’ or ‘‘rulership.’’ Themat connection is reinforced by the twisted elementon Yax Balam’s back, resembling the mat in themonth glyph Pop, signifying ‘‘straw mat’’ in almostall Mayan languages and dialects (Thompson 1960 :107). Another alternative is that the throne may referto the moon becausepois a name for the moon in anumber of Mayan languages (Thompson 1960 : 47).Thrones bearing thepoglyph are covered by a jaguarpelt in a number of Maya vase paintings. On theProtoclassic La Mojarra Stela, Martha Macri andLaura Stark (1993 : 6) identify a hide withpoin itscenter as a lunar symbol. Probably the hide is meantto be a jaguar skin, an apparent allusion to the jaguaraspect of the moon.A lunar crescent frames the Moon God sitting onapothrone on the Pearlman Trumpet, an incisedconch shell trumpet from the Early Classic period(Fig. 4.5g; Schele and Miller 1986 : 308 – 309; Taube1992b : 67).

Even thoughhe wears a costume typical of Classic Maya women,they point out that this garb is also worn by malesinvolved in bloodletting. The gender ambiguity inthe figure’s costume is not surprising in light ofthe female and male variants of Xbalanque in twodifferent versions of the Hero Twins tale discussedabove. Indeed, a number of Classic Maya lunar dei-ties seem to be of ambiguous gender, a pattern simi-lar to central Mexican lunar iconography (Milbrath1995a).We can conclude that Hun Ahau (Hunahpu) andYax Balam (Xbalanque) represent the sun and themoon in the underworld, like the Hero Twins in thePopol Vuh. They are most often seen in Classic pe-riod ceramic paintings. They wear ball-game equip-ment, and they appear to be involved in maize agri-culture, pointing to a link with the activities of theHero Twins in the Popol Vuh. Yax Balam may of-ten represent the masculine full moon, which playsan important role in the Quiche ́ maize cycle today(Chapter 1). In the Postclassic period, God CH con-tinues to have Yax Balam’s jaguar aspect and lunarnature and is similarly associated with maize. How-ever, he is rarely represented in the codices withHun Ahau. Apparently, the mythic exploits of theHero Twins received less emphasis in the codices,probably because these focused on agricultural andweather cycles rather than on mythological events.The paucity of Postclassic representations of the HeroTwins may also relate to regional differences, reflect-ing a greater emphasis on female lunar deities in Yu-cata ́ n, evident at sites like Tulum (see below).THE CLASSIC PERIOD MOON GODIN MONUMENTAL ARTThe Moon God in Classic period monumental art isrelatively rare. The known examples do not exhibitobvious jaguar traits. Perhaps the most intriguingimage is seen on Bonampak Altar 2, where a lunarcrescent frames the Moon God dressed in a ball-game belt and holding his lunar rabbit (Fig. 4.6a).He has a cruller nose like the Jaguar War God butlacks apparent jaguar traits.A ball-court marker from Quirigua ́ known asMonument 18 (Altar R) shows a quatrefoil caveframing the moon symbol and the Moon God, whois wearing a ball-game belt (Fig. 4.6c). This imageevokes the new moon in conjunction hiding in acave.

Oc-casionally this hairdo is also worn by the MoonGoddess (Fig. 4.10g). The downturned mask is likethat worn by the Moon God on the Pearlman Trum-pet (Fig. 4.5g). Although the gender is ambiguous, Igroup the Piedras Negras figure with the Moon God.One of the finest monumental images of themoon appears on a bench from Las Sepulturas atCopa ́ n. The lunar deity in a T683 lunar crescentholds a lunar rabbit (Pl. 19). The deity is probably amale because it has a downturned serpent mask seenon other images of the Moon God (Fig. 4.5g).On a Copa ́ n ball-court marker, Hun Ahau (HunAhaw) kneels with the God of Zero, identified by hisportrait glyph at the top of the right-hand column ofglyphs (Fig. 3.10g; Schele and Miller 1986 : 251, 257).Schele (1987a) refers to the God of Zero as a deathgod embodying sacrificial death. However, he mayalso be connected with the moon, since he holds ahandstone representing the lunar rabbit. His deathaspect may also be linked with the moon. A Mayavase depicts a female with death attributes and ahand on her chin, as the God of Zero has, (Kerr1990 : 229, no. 2286). Possibly she has a death aspectlinked with the moon, like the skeletal heads in thelunar Glyph C.A deity embodying the Classic period versionof the Death God, known as God A8in the codices,seems to be linked with the moon in some con-texts. In the Temple of the Foliated Cross, a passagenaming astronomical gods includes the PalenqueTriad (O9-O10), and then names Ek’ Way Chak andGod A8(Fig. 4.6e; Schele 1992b : 170). This death godhas a Cimi (death) sign on the cheek, a dark bandacross the eyes, and a lunar glyph attached to hishead. His name appears before Hun Ahaw, suggest-ing a pairing like that seen on the Copa ́ n Ball-courtmarker.Another skeletal god clearly is also linked with alunar crescent on Quirigua ́ Monument 4 (Stela D).Here Kelley (1977b : 61) identifies a moon symbolframing a skeletal face as the symbol for a lunareclipse, but it could represent the Moon disappear-ing in conjunction. The Initial Series date on Monu-ment 4 (9.16.15.0.0; 2 /13/766) is not even close tothe day of a lunar eclipse, but it is one day before thenew Moon. Perhaps the Moon in conjunction (in theunderworld) is represented in a skeletal form. An-other alternative is that the configuration shows Ve-nus as a skeletal Morning Star framed by the Moon,because this date marks the last appearance for bothbodies in the morning sky. As we will see, the skeletalMorning Star seems to represent Venus in superiorconjunction in other contexts (Chapter 5).In sum, the most easily recognized aspect of theMoon God is the ballplayer in his lunar crescent.Ball-game belts on two such figures suggest that thisaspect of the moon belongs to the masculine realmof the Hero Twins. Scenes involving partial figuresin a lunar crescent are more ambiguous in gender,reflecting a trend seen throughout the lunar com-plex. The God of Zero may represent a death aspectof the moon. Other death aspects of the moon mayappear in portrait glyphs that include the lunar cres-cent and a face bearing the Cimi sign, showing thenatural connection between the moon and the realmof the underworld, also noted in modern Maya ac-counts.

Thompson (1960 : 231) notes that the con-fusion between the sun’s wife and the mother of thesun in contemporary Maya accounts may reflecttwo different phases of the moon. In a like fashion,he proposes that in the codices a youthful goddessevokes the waxing moon, whereas an aged goddess isidentified with the waning moon (Thompson 1960 :83). My own research confirms his findings (Mil-brath 1995a, 1996a).Goddess I of the codices is the young Moon God-dess. In the Dresden Codex, the name for the youth-ful Goddess I invariably uses the T1026 female por-trait head inset with a curled design resembling T171(Fig. 4.7a; Thompson 1972 : 47 – 48, 51). The T171curl refers to the sounduin Landa’s syllabary, whichalso is the word for ‘‘moon.’’ Standing alone, T1026seems to signify ‘‘moon lady’’ (Milbrath 1996a). TheT1026 name may be prefixed by T171, which appar-ently adds emphasis to her lunar quality (Figs. 4.1j,the moon paired with the underworld sun. Under-world imagery is appropriate to the moon, whichspends up to three days each month invisible in theunderworld during conjunction.THE YOUNG MOON GODDESS INCOLONIAL AND POSTCLASSIC TIMESThe moon has multiple aspects in the Popol Vuh. Themale ballplayer, Xbalanque, may take the role ofthe full moon; the youthful Blood Woman may be thewaxing moon; and the aged Grandmother (Xmu-cane) is probably the waning moon (B. Tedlock1992a : 31; 1992b :183 –184). After Blood Woman isimpregnated by the decapitated head of Hun Hu-nahpu, the Maize God, she carries a net to collectcorn. Her net leaves an imprint in the floor of Xmu-cane’s house, a magical sign that shows she is preg-nant with the offspring of Hun Hunahpu (D. Ted-lock 1985 : 118 –119; 1991 : 166).

In the codices,Goddess I is shown paired with many different malefigures (Fig. 4.7f – g). These represent sexual unionsthat symbolize conjunction. Thompson (1972 : 57 –60) notes that these scenes often have a glyph com-pound with crossed bands (T552) that refers to herunion with another god, indicating conjunction as aform of marriage. This compound may refer toya-tanbil,a Yucatec word for ‘‘wife’’ (Barrera Va ́ squez1980). The Sun God (God G), traditionally namedas her husband in Maya legends, is not among herconsorts; instead she joins with God N in two scenes,and in other scenes her consorts are death deitiesand a dog symbolizing Venus, as on Dresden Codex21b. It seems that the Moon has so many lovers be-cause it moves rapidly through the sky, making fre-quent encounters with planets as it circles aroundthe sky in only 271⁄3days (Milbrath 1996a).A voluptuous woman seated on a sky-band throneis the Moon Goddess ‘‘par excellence’’ on DresdenCodex 49a (Fig. 4.7i). A moon symbol wraps aroundher waist, and she pours water from a vase deco-rated with a conch shell, suggesting parallels with lu-nar symbolism in central Mexican cultures (Mil-brath 1995a). Thompson (1972 : 68) identifies her asthe youthful Goddess I, and Taube (1992b : 64) con-curs, although he points out that she has a differentname glyph. Her name glyph is a variant with anaged female face infixed with the lunar glyph T181.Andrea Stone (1990) suggests that she is Grand-mother Moon, a name common among the contem-porary Maya. The goddess on Dresden Codex 49amay be linked to childbirth through imagery of theconch shell, described as a metaphorical womb in anAztec account discussed earlier. As a lunar deity, shealso controls the tides when she pours seawater fromher conch shell. In another scene, Goddess I offersfish, her bounty from the sea (Fig. 4.7e).We can conclude that Goddess I, the youthfulMoon Goddess of the codices, is probably the wax-ing moon. The waxing moon is visualized as ayouthful mother goddess associated with young chil-dren. She also offers various foods essential to sus-tenance, such as maize and fish. On the other hand,she has a malevolent side because she brings certaindiseases. She is also lascivious, for she has many lov-4.7a, right). When T1026 is prefixed by T58 (zacorsak), her name becomes ‘‘white moon lady’’(Fig. 4.7a, left). This name appears with a number ofrepresentations of the goddess, including one whowears the symbol for white as a headdress (Fig. 4.7b).140LUNAR IMAGES AND DEITIESThompson (1960 : 83) notes that the young MoonGoddess was the mother goddess and patronessof medicine, weaving, sexual license, the earth, andcrops. He identifies virtually all youthful female fig-ures on pages 16 – 23 of the Maya Dresden Codex asthe Moon Goddess (Thompson 1972). Usually she isbare breasted and wears a skirt of varying lengths,sometimes as short as a man’s hip cloth. Her skirt isnetted in a number of images (Dresden Codex 18c),which is intriguing because legends speak about themoon being lifted up in a net made of fish duringthe waxing moon (Chapter 1). The net skirt alsosuggests a connection with the netted bag used togather maize, an activity sometimes timed by the fullmoon (Chapter 1).On Dresden Codex 16 – 23, Goddess I appearsvariously in amorous scenes or carrying burdens ormaking offerings that include maize symbols andfish (Fig. 4.7d – g; Thompson 1972 : 47). Her burdensshow her role as the archetypal mother. Strapped toher back or in her arms, she carries small deities rep-resenting her divine children. In one case, she carriestwo children who may be siblings of different ages(Fig. 4.7f; Thompson 1972 : 48). Sometimes she car-ries birds that represent disease (koch) that are con-trolled by the Moon Goddess (Fig. 4.7h; Thompson1972 : 51). This calls to mind ethnographic accountsdescribing how the waxing moon brings illnessessuch as infections, tumors, or pustules (Chapter 1).On Dresden Codex 16 – 23, Hofling and O’Neil(1992) recognize death aspects of Goddess I, withclosed eyes or death spots linked to lunar-eclipseintervals. On page 19b, she has death spots, then29 days later (one lunar month) she is paired withher lover, a death god covered with death spots(Fig. 4.7g). She has similar death spots and closedeyes like the eclipsed Moon Goddess in the eclipsetable (Fig. 4.7c).Amorous scenes indicate that the Moon Goddesshas a roving eye, just as contemporary folktales char-acterize the Moon Goddess as a deity with many ro-"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"ers, apparently because her rapid movement throughthe sky results in many conjunction events. She maybe the wife of the sun, but this role is not clearly rep-resented in the codices. Although the full moon maybe male in some contemporary Maya accounts, thecodices more often show the youthful Goddess I in adeath aspect to represent the eclipsed full moon. Thechoice of a feminine form for the full moon may bea Postclassic phenomenon, reflecting the popularityof female lunar cults at this time in Yucata ́n.THE AGED MOON GODDESS INCOLONIAL AND POSTCLASSIC TIMESColonial period accounts indicate that the moongrows old as it wanes, an image that is echoed inmodern Maya accounts. In the Popol Vuh, the grand-mother of the Hero Twins, Xmucane, has been iden-tified as the waning moon (Girard 1979 : 52, 167, 287;B. Tedlock 1992b : 31). Mary Preuss (1988 : 8) trans-lates Xmucane’s Quiche ́ name as ‘‘she who is coveredup,’’ an apt name for the waning moon. Xmucanetakes the role of an aged midwife and diviner (D. Ted-lock 1985 : 40, 369). This suggests comparison withthe Yucatec goddess Ix Chel described in Landa’s ac-count, the same name associated with the Lacando ́nMoon Goddess (Chapter 1).Landa describes Ix Chel as the goddess of child-birth, medicine, and divination, although he doesnot specifically identify her as the moon (Tozzer1941 : 129). Ix Chel’s lunar nature is apparent in afestival held in her honor on the sixth day of Zipinvolving a dance calledokot uil,meaning ‘‘danceof the moon’’ (Thompson 1970b : 242). Ix Chel wasthe grandmother of the Bacabs, which makes her anold goddess (Thompson 1939 : 137). As a goddess ofchildbirth, Ix Chel takes the role of an old midwiferather than that of the youthful mother giving birthand carrying children (a role reserved for the youngGoddess I).In light of recent glyphic research that links IxChel to the Postclassic Goddess O, the identificationof Ix Chel with the moon has been questioned bysome (Taube 1992b : 105) and reaffirmed by others(Schele and Freidel 1990 : 366). Taube identifies theaged Goddess O as Landa’s Ix Chel, describing her asthe goddess of weaving, curing, and divination. Hedistinguishes her from an aged variant of Goddess Irepresenting the old Moon Goddess (Taube 1992b :68 – 69). Nonetheless, Stone (1990) points out thatthese old goddesses are closely related and can belinked by hybrid names. My research suggests thatthese aged goddesses are all aspects of the waningmoon (Milbrath 1996a). There are three primary var-iants of the aged Moon Goddess: the aged Goddess I,the aged Goddess O, and an aged goddess with vari-ous hybrid names (termed here Goddess I-O). Prob-ably we should abandon the letters designating theaged goddesses, visualizing them instead as aspects ofthe old Moon Goddess assigned to different roles.Nevertheless, here I retain letter designations to in-corporate previous research. All the codical goddessesare linked in a manner similar to the ‘‘Marı ́a system’’of the Tzutujil, which represents the Marı ́as as differ-ent lunar months (Stone 1990; Tarn and Prechtel1986 : 176, 185 n. 7). Future research on the namesassociated with the various lunar deities in the codi-ces may help to identify different lunar months.Because the aged Goddess I is usually recognizedas an image of the moon, we will begin with studyof her character. The name glyph of old Goddess I isan aged lunar face (T1027) with the T171 ‘‘moon’’infix. Her T1027 name may mean ‘‘old lunar lady’’or perhaps ‘‘Grandmother Moon.’’ Thezac(white)prefix used in the name of the youthful Goddess I isalso sometimes used to name the aged Goddess I(T58.1027; Fig. 4.7j – k; Milbrath 1996a).The old Goddess I with the T58.1027 name isshown as a beekeeper in the Madrid Codex (Fig.4.7j). Her beehive is marked by a Caban glyph, sig-nifying a play on the word for ‘‘bee’’ and ‘‘honey’’(cab). John Bolles (1982) records an incantation toprotect the beehive that refers to a number of god-desses, includingcolel cab(lady bee). Like the god-desses who guard the beehive in modern YucatecMaya lore, the old Moon Goddess is the keeper ofthe beehive. Here she is harvesting the honey, forthe beehive is open to reveal its honeycomb, an ac-tivity associated with the waning moon, according toethnographic accounts (Ba ́ ez-Jorge 1988 : 247 – 248).THE AGED MOON GODDESS IN COLONIAL AND POSTCLASSIC TIMES141"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"a hybrid goddess (Fig. 4.7m).

Mary Ciaramella (n.d.)identifies the goddess aschac cheland the activity assewing, also confirmed by a reading of the associatedglyphs by James Fox and John Justeson (1984 : 66).Many of the goddesses involved in the weavingcomplex seem to have hybrid titles linking GoddessI and Goddess O. An aged goddess with a hybridname on Madrid Codex 102d uses a weaving battento work on a textile mounted on a wooden frame(Fig. 4.7l). Ciaramella (n.d.) identifies the activity asweaving, the act of moving the weft thread throughthe warp. Her name glyph incorporates the portraithead of aged Goddess I (T1027) and the T145.612compound that spellschel,a component in thename of the aged Goddess O, a close counterpartof Landa’s Ix Chel (Milbrath 1996a : 382). Ix is usu-ally translated as ‘‘lady’’ in Colonial period texts(Thompson 1970b : 206 – 207). T1027 can be seen asa logograph for ‘‘old lunar lady,’’ and it also may bethe glyphic counterpart for Ix. If so, we may have anactual representation of the name Ix Chel on MadridCodex 102d.Goddess O is usually namedchelorchac chel(Fig. 4.8b – c; Taube 1992b : 105). Although Taubedoes not recognize a lunar connection, he notes thata phonetic reading links Goddess O to the goddessIx Chel described by Landa. Goddess O can alsobe equated with the Lacando ́ n Ix Chel, the MoonGoddess, in her role as goddess of childbirth. As anaged midwife, Goddess O is the goddess of child-birth who prognosticates the future of the newborn.Among the contemporary Quiche ́ , the moon is in-volved with childbirth because midwives follow acount from full moon to full moon (B. Tedlock1992a : 30).An old water-pouring goddess on Madrid Codex10b has the most complete form of Goddess O’sname known from the codices (Fig. 4.8b; Milbrath1996a : 386; Taube 1992, fig. 10c). Her name is readThis provides support for linking the aged goddesswith the waning moon.Thompson (1939 : 130 –132; 1960 : 83 – 84) longago reached the conclusion that a number of god-desses linked to weaving seem to be counterparts ofthe moon, but he did not explore the iconography ofthe weaving complex in any detail. He says that theyoung Moon Goddess is the patroness of weaving,but this does not seem to be the case, because all thescenes related to weaving in the codices involve oldwomen (Ciaramella 1994, fig. 6, table 3; n.d.; Mil-brath 1996a). The aged Goddess I and hybrid forms,referred to here as Goddess I-O, are most prominentin activities related to weaving, including warping(attaching the warp threads), weaving, brocading,and sewing or embroidery (Figs. 4.7k– m, 4.9a).The Moon Goddess is a natural weaver, movingback and forth across the path of the sun (Fig. 2.2a).In a previous study (Milbrath 1996a : 379 – 384, 389),I have discussed the seasonal symbolism of themoon’s weaving complex. The moon’s weaving ac-tivity seems to refer to the motion of the moon dur-ing the dry season. According to ethnographic evi-dence (Earle 1986 : 160), weaving is a dry-seasonactivity, no doubt based on practical considerations,because weaving is done out-of-doors.On Madrid Codex 102c, the aged Goddess I wearsa headdress with a coil of cotton used in weaving asshe lays out the warp threads (Fig. 4.7k; Milbrath1996a). Her name is prefixed by the color white(zac), which is the color of cotton. White may alsorefer to the white color of the moon or, more specifi-cally, to a visible phase of the moon. Her name(T58.1027) may mean ‘‘white old lunar lady.’’On Madrid Codex 30a, an unnamed goddess wear-ing a headdress with a cotton coil and spindles pourswater on a Chicchan Serpent (Fig. 4.8a). She has linesaround her mouth, suggesting that she is at leastmiddle aged. She wears a net skirt like that of GoddessI, but her activity of pouring water links her withGoddess O. The cotton coil in her headdress could berelated to either goddess, but the spindle is more typi-cal of Goddess O and the hybrid goddess I-O.An aged lunar goddess working with a textile onDresden 2b and having achac(red) title also may be142LUNAR IMAGES AND DEITIES"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"aschac chel,with thechelformed phonetically byT145 (che) and T612 (le).Chelis a Yucatec term forthe ‘‘arch of heaven’’ or ‘‘rainbow’’ (Barrera Va ́ squez1980).Chaccan mean either ‘‘red’’ or ‘‘great.’’ Herechacmay refer to a red lunar goddess.

The Tzutujil say that serpent rain-bows surrounding the moon are a sign that there willbe rain (Tarn and Prechtel 1986 : 176). Stone (1990)compares Goddess O’s serpent headdress with theophidian rainbows around Grandmother Moon de-scribed by the Tzutujil.Central Mexican goddesses show specific overlapswith the imagery of Goddess O (Milbrath 1995a;1996 : 383; Taube 1992b : 103 –105). Toci and Tlazol-teotl, two closely related lunar goddesses connectedwith weaving, curing, divining, and childbirth, over-lap to some degree with Goddess O (Fig. 4.9c).Goddess O in her role as a water-pourer suggestsa direct connection with the Aztec water goddess,Chalchiuhtlicue, who is sometimes shown withweaving implements (Milbrath 1996a : 383). GoddessO seems even more closely connected with Cihua-coatl (serpent lady), a warlike goddess who bran-dishes a weaving batten like a weapon (Fig. 4.9b).Goddess O and Cihuacoatl share an association withserpents, death imagery, and implements associatedwith weaving. Cihuacoatl, also known as Tonan,is the counterpart of Tonantsi, a contemporaryNa ́ hua goddess who represents the moon within theearth, an image of lunar conjunction because themoon seems to disappear into the earth around thetime of the new moon (Milbrath 1995a, 1996).In a previous study (Milbrath 1996a : 395 – 386), Ihave identified Goddess O on page 74 of the DresdenCodex as the new moon threatening to eclipse thesun (Figs. 4.8f, 7.4d). Goddess O pours rainwatermarked with glyphs referring to an 1,820-day cycle,the same cycle associated with imagery of solareclipses on Paris Codex 23 – 24 (Fig. 7.2a; Chapter 7).Goddess O has an especially monstrous quality, withher sharp claws and her skirt with crossed bones. Theclawed hands and feet seem to be those of a jaguar.Dresden Codex 74 shows Goddess O with eclipsesigns. This makes her a counterpart of the Aztec god-dess Cihuacoatl, who takes on a monstrous aspectwhen she takes the role of an eclipse demon knownas atzitzimimethreatening to eclipse the sun (Mil-brath 1995a, 1997). The Postclassic Maya probablyshared the contemporary Lacando ́ n view that eclip-ses would bring the end of the world, a belief alsorecorded among the Aztecs (Milbrath 1995b; 1997).On Dresden 67a, Goddess O has a jaguar-spottedeye and feline claws (Fig. 4.8e). Like Goddess Oon Dresden Codex 74, she wears a knotted-serpentheaddress and pours water from her vase, and shehas other similar monstrous features. The old (jag-uar?) Moon Goddess may represent the new moonwhen the sun and the moon are joined together,a dangerous time for potential solar eclipses. Thisnew-moon aspect of Goddess O can be distinguishedfrom imagery of the waning moon, such as the oldGoddess O with human hands and feet seen onDresden Codex 39b (Fig. 4.8c; Milbrath 1996a : 386).The texts on both 39b and 67a show a glyph com-pound with Kin and Akbal, suggesting the sun andthe moon are involved, paired in a manner similarto texts associated with the Paddler Twins.The serpent headdress found on a number of rep-resentations of the old goddess pouring water seemsto be linked with the rainy season (Fig. 4.8c – f; Mil-brath 1996a). The Madrid Codex (30b, 32b) depictsa related image in the old goddesses with serpentheaddresses and streams of water issuing from theirbodies (Fig. 4.8g – h). They do not bear thechacpre-fix typical of Goddess O, but they are shown emit-ting water from their bodies, suggesting a link withGoddess O pouring water during the rainy season.The unnamed Moon Goddess on Madrid Codex 32bwears a serpent belt and a composite headdress withTHE AGED MOON GODDESS IN COLONIAL AND POSTCLASSIC TIMES143"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"a serpent, a spindle, and a cotton coil (Fig. 4.8h). Theserpent and cotton coil in the headdress of the lunardeity are not often seen together. She has human fea-tures, but one of her eyes is torn from its socket. Thisrecalls a Maya belief recorded by Thompson (1970b :235) that the moon is less bright than the sun be-cause the sun plucked out one of her eyes whenpeople complained that they could not sleep at nightbecause of the light. In the blue liquid flowing be-tween her legs, a black bar represents a period of fivedays and a red coefficient refers to a date with thenumber nine; and on her chest there is a red datecoefficient of four and a black interval of thirteendays. The number thirteen is linked with the moonin a number of contexts (Milbrath 1996a : 382). Forexample, theRitual of the Bacabsdescribes thir-teen balls of colored thread that belong to Ix Chel(Thompson 1939 : 148).Another old lunar goddess on Madrid Codex108c wears both a serpent and a cotton coil in herheaddress (Fig. 4.7j). She harvests honey, indicatingan activity that possibly took place in Tzec (Oc-tober 14 –November 3 N.S.), for Landa notes thatowners of the hives gave honey in abundance for thisfestival (Tozzer 1941 : 157). This would indicate thehoney harvest took place near the end of the rainyseason, correlating with the honey harvest recordedin Pom in a nineteenth-century Tzeltal calendar(Seler 1990 –1996, 1 : 220). Seasonal transitions mayalso be implied by her composite headdress. Anothergoddess wears a cotton coil and spindle in her head-dress, a headdress associated with the dry-seasonweaving complex, but here the lunar goddess pourswater (Fig. 4.8a). Another transitional combinationis seen in an old goddess, wearing a knotted snakeheaddress, who brocades on a backstrap loom (Fig.4.9a; Milbrath 1996a : 382). This headdress is usuallyassociated with goddesses pouring water, but herethe image may represent the moon at a time of sea-sonal change.Water pouring, a rainy-season activity, is morecommonly associated with old lunar ladies wear-ing a serpent headdress (Fig. 4.8c – f ), whereas dry-season activities linked with weaving usually involvethe old Moon Goddess wearing a cotton coil head-dress (Fig. 4.7k– m). The moon pours water duringthe rainy season, and the wriggling serpent suggeststhe undulating path of the moon during the rainyseason when snakes are active (Milbrath 1996a).During the dry season the moon weaves across thesky, and the spinning and weaving of cotton threadmay describe the undulating path of the moon dur-ing the dry season.The aged Moon Goddess wearing her serpentheaddress expresses a connection with the rainy sea-son. In a like fashion, the Tzutujil Maya Moon God-dess wears ophidian rainbows as a sign of rain duringthe rainy season. The link between a halo (rainbow)around the moon and rainfall in Tzutujil accountsseems to be based on actual observations (Chapter 1).This demonstrates that Maya imagery involves meta-phors that encode observations of nature.FIG. 4.8.a:Old Moon Goddess, wearing headdress withcotton coil and spindles, pours water on Chicchan Ser-pent (Madrid Codex 30a; after Villacorta and Villacorta1977).b:Old Moon Goddess pouring rainwater; she bears thenamechac chel(T109.T145 : 612) at top of second column(Madrid Codex 10b; after Villacorta and Villacorta 1977).c:Goddess O, named withchactitle at top of secondcolumn, is aged Moon Goddess who pours rainwater(Dresden Codex 39b; after Villacorta and Villacorta1977).d:Old Moon Goddess (Goddess O) pouring rainwaterwears typical knotted-serpent headdress (Dresden Codex43b; after Villacorta and Villacorta 1977).e:Goddess O as water-pourer has jaguar-spotted eyeand feline paws, suggesting monstrous image of newmoon (Dresden 67a; after Villacorta and Villacorta 1977).f:Monstrous Goddess O (new moon?) pours waterbearing glyphs that refer to period of 1,820 days (DresdenCodex 74; after Villacorta and Villacorta 1977).g:Old lunar goddess wearing serpent headdress issuesstreams of water (Madrid Codex 30b; after Villacorta andVillacorta 1977).h:Water streams from monstrous lunar goddess withextruded eye, death collar, and composite headdress withserpent, cotton coil, and spindle (Madrid Codex 32b; afterVillacorta and Villacorta 1977).THE AGED MOON GODDESS IN COLONIAL AND POSTCLASSIC TIMES145"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The Moon Goddess wears a serpent in her head-dress in Aztec central Mexico and on the PacificSlope of Guatemala, indicating a widespread tradi-tion. Coyolxauhqui sometimes wears a coral snakein her headdress, a snake seen in one image of theaged Goddess I (Fig. 4.7j; Milbrath 1997 : 188, fig. 1).Coyolxauhqui seems to symbolize the rainy-seasonmoon, and her decapitation is linked to a myth ofseasonal transition, for the water dries up on theball court when she is decapitated (Milbrath 1995a,1997). A Classic period monument from Guatemala,Bilbao Monument 4, depicts the Moon Goddesswearing a knotted-snake headdress, surrounded byflowering vines as an expression of the moon’s asso-ciation with rainy-season fertility (Fig. 4.9d; Milbrath1996a : 388). A lunar crescent fits tightly around herbody in the manner of a yoke, which could representa symbolic link with the stone ball-game yokes foundin the Bilbao region and in Veracruz.We can conclude that the aged Goddess I, the oldGoddess O, and hybrid variants of the two are allaspects of the moon, most likely associated with thewaning moon. A more monstrous form of the oldgoddess is reserved for images of the new moon,which can threaten the sun with eclipse. There seemto be seasonal differences in the imagery of the agedgoddesses associated with the moon. The aged God-dess I and the hybrid Goddess I-O are often associ-ated with activities related to weaving, a dry-seasonactivity. Aged Goddess O, in both human and mon-strous aspects, is frequently associated with water-pouring during the rainy season. The imagery ofwater-pouring goddesses may also indicate that thewaning moon and new moon were believed to pro-duce the most rainfall.THE MOON IN THE POSTCLASSICMURALS AT TULUMMural paintings from Tulum may depict differentaspects of the aged Moon Goddess on Structures 5and 16, dating sometime aftera.d.1400 (Miller1982 : 54, pls. 28, 37).

Miller (1982 :92, 97) interprets this design as a cosmic umbilicalcord like the Kusansum, the marvelous rope or path-way in the sky known from a Maya ethnographic ac-count recorded in Quintana Roo. He notes that thetwisted cord in the Tulum murals can simultane-ously be an image of the umbilical cord, a twinedcord, and intertwined serpents (Miller 1982 : 95).The cord seems to refer to the path of the sun, themoon, and the planets, like that seen in the codices(Fig. 3.4a – b).Although nothing in the imagery expressly refersto childbirth, the aged goddesses of Tulum may belinked with a lunar cult dedicated to midwives, whowere usually aged women, making them the coun-terparts of the waning moon. Tulum was part ofa pilgrimage route associated with female cults es-pecially connected with childbirth. The Spaniardsnamed the nearby island Isla Mujeres (island ofwomen) because female figurines were so abundant(Miller 1982 : 85, 96). Just to the south, Ix Chel’sprincipal shrine was located at the island of Cozu-mel, a pilgrimage site for pregnant woman. Theshrine was used in the Late Postclassic period, whenthe island played a prominent role in long-distancetrade networks, but the shrine itself may have origi-nated in Classic period times (Sabloff and Rathje1975 : 27).We can conclude that Tulum was dedicated to acult of the lunar goddesses, especially the aged as-pects of the moon associated with the waning moondescending into the waters of the Caribbean. Muralpaintings seem to show the moon’s transformationas it descends to the eastern horizon. The waningmoon is represented by an aged goddess at Tulum,a patroness of midwives who assisted in childbirthand a counterpart to Goddess O in the codices andIx Chel in Landa’s time. For this reason, the sitemay have been a center of pilgrimage for pregnantwomen who sought the assistance of the moon in heraspect as a patroness of midwives.LUNAR DEITIES AT CHICHE ́N ITZA ́Lunar deities such as Ix Chel may have been wor-shiped at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ , the most important Yucatecpearance in conjunction, dipping into the waters ofthe Caribbean.Tulum Structure 16, also known as the Temple ofthe Frescoes, depicts the aged Goddess O wearing acomposite spindle and knotted-serpent headdress inthe lower band of Mural 2 (Fig. 4.9e; Miller 1982,pls. 37, 38; Taube 1992b :101). The aged goddess car-ries a serpent staff in her hands and a maize symbolon her back, suggesting an association with agricul-ture. She seems to be near the end of her life cycle,for she has lines covering her entire face. The agedTulum goddess is the waning moon as it descendsinto the waters of the underworld, just prior toconjunction. The complete mural shows that sheis about to be devoured by the reptilian jaws ofthe earth monster, rendered in a style that seemsstrongly influenced by central Mexico. The earthmonster also swallows the sea beneath her. The seais filled with marine creatures such as a stingray anda fish. According to Miller (1982 : 91), the goddess isin a liminal state between the world of the living andthe world of the dead. Above her, another goddesscrowned by lunar rays may be the moon in thewaning quarter. This goddess has a line around hermouth, indicating age, but she is not so aged as thegoddess floating on the sea. These images suggesta narrative sequence involving the waning moon,which ages as it descends toward the horizon andfinally disappears into the sea as it drops into thejaws of the earth monster.The Temple of the Diving God (Structure 5) de-picts a sky band framing a scene with two goddessesseated on sky-band thrones (Fig. 3.3b). The sky bandoverhead has Venus glyphs alternating with solarrays. Both goddesses wear costumes decorated withshells, and they have earrings with rays that may rep-resent lunar light. The one to the right has a linearound her mouth, indicating that she is the moreaged of the two. She wears an element around herwaist similar to the burden pack of the possums inthe New Year pages of the Dresden Codex (25a –28a). Again, a narrative sequence may be impliedby the youthful and aged variants of the MoonGoddess.All the Tulum goddesses described above areseated on twined cords wrapped around star sym-148LUNAR IMAGES AND DEITIES"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Maya site in the Terminal Classic and Early Postclas-sic periods. Andrea Stone (1990) has identified animage of the Moon Goddess framed by a large lunarglyph on Column 39S of the Northwest Colonnadein the Temple of the Warriors (Morris et al. 1931, pl.105). Other lunar deities seem to be related to theMoon Goddess on Madrid Codex 30a (Fig. 4.8a).Snakes slither up behind four images of the MoonGoddess on the four sides of the north column inthe Lower Temple of the Jaguars, part of the ball-court complex dating to the Terminal Classic period(Fig. 4.9f – i). On the north side of the column, thegoddess has her arms held aloft in the manner of anAtlantean (Fig. 4.9g). On the other three sides, theupper columns are effaced, but presumably all sidesdepicted Atlantean figures, because no arms areshown on the lower columns. Despite the similari-ties, the four goddesses show differences in details ofcostume and body form that suggest the four lunarphases.Taube (1992b :101, fig. 51b) identifies the northfigure as the aged Goddess O,chac chel(Fig. 4.9g).She has a skeletal face and wears a beaded collar; thedamaged chest area shows outlines that could be askeletal rib cage. Her long skirt has three rows oflarge circles (stars?) beneath crossed bones. This fig-ure evokes a connection with Goddess O on DresdenCodex 74 (Fig. 4.8f ). The skeletal Moon Goddessprobably represents the monstrous aspect of the newmoon. On the south side of the column (Fig. 4.9i),the goddess wears a skirt with death eyes betweencrossed bones, and she has pendulous breasts, a de-tail omitted in Tozzer’s (1957, fig. 195) drawing. Thisgoddess may represent Goddess O in her more hu-man manifestation as the waning moon of the lastquarter.On the east side of the column, the figure hasmore rounded and youthful breasts than the figureon the south side (Fig. 4.9f ). Her skirt suggests a netpattern made of jade beads. Net skirts are character-istic of youthful and aged aspects of Goddess I andthe hybrid Goddess I-O in the codices of a differentdesign. The west figure also wears a skirt with a netpattern (Fig. 4.9h). Perhaps the two different formsof net skirt reflect two different aspects of the moonin the first half of its cycle: from the first quarter tothe full moon. As previously noted, a Mopan Mayalegend describes how the moon was lifted up in afishing net during its waxing phase. On the otherhand, a net bag used to gather maize in Quiche ́ ac-counts implies a connection with the full moon, theideal time to gather the first ears of maize (Chap-ter 1).Four related goddesses representing four lunarphases also may be seen in the four Ix Chels, eachassociated with different colors and world directionsin theRitual of the Bacabs(Roys 1965 : 14, 28). An-other quadripartite division is suggested by four re-lated goddesses worshiped in ancient times at IslaMujeres who were known as Aixchel, Ix Chelbeliax,Ixhunie ́ , and Ixhunieta (Tozzer 1941 : 9 –10).The four lunar goddesses have counterparts ormates in the four aspects of God N on the south col-umn of the Lower Temple of the Jaguars. These rep-resentations of God N also have their arms raised inan Atlantean pose, and they are similarly positionedin front of undulating serpents (Schele and Mathews1998, fig. 6.11). The faces are missing on two sides,but the other two show aged features and three showa headdress with a netted cap. On each of the foursides, God N wears a costume representing a differ-ent animal: a conch on the east side, a snail on thenorth side, and a turtle on the south side. The im-agery on the west side is more enigmatic, but it mayrepresent a winged insect, based on comparison withthe four aspects of God N on the Iglesia facade(Taube 1992b; Tozzer 1957, figs. 266, 615). God Nmay be an astronomical god with a quadripartite na-ture. Indeed, a round column from Structure 6E1 atChiche ́ n Itza ́ depicts four God N figures with stardesigns (Taube 1992b : 94).A phonetic reading of God N’s name spellspatun,a term that clearly refers to the Pauahtuns describedby Landa, each associated with a different color, di-rection, and year-bearer (Tozzer 1941 : 137). Somescholars say that the aged Pauahtuns support theearth, whereas youthful Bacabs support the sky. Onthe other hand, Taube (1992b : 92 – 94, fig. 47a) pointsout that there are no explicit images showing God Nholding up the earth in Maya art, and sometimes heis seen supporting a sky band or the Cosmic Monsterrepresenting the sky (Fig. 7.5d; Copa ́ n Structure 22).LUNAR DEITIES AT CHICHE ́N ITZA ́149"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"play the role of Venus (Fig. 5.3c; Chapter 5). Mer-cury might present a possible counterpart for God N.Perhaps God N is seen holding up the sky becauseMercury is always seen close to the horizon. An-other alternative is that God N is the aged Sun rep-resenting the dying year in a sequence of four years.Future study of God N should involve the mysteri-ous God N events recorded in Classic period texts(Schele 1990a :147 –151).We can conclude that Chiche ́ n Itza ́ features fourfemale aspects of the moon, probably representingfour lunar phases, paired with four aged aspects ofGod N, an astronomical god of uncertain identityconnected with the old year. The imagery at Chiche ́nItza ́ provides a bridge between the Postclassic andClassic periods, for it carries on a tradition first es-tablished in the Classic period. As we will see, imagesof God N paired with the Moon Goddess and anundulating serpent appear on Late Classic ceramicpaintings that suggest a myth referring to the youth-ful Moon Goddess and her aged lover, a pairing re-peated in later times in the codices, although the ser-pent is no longer present.THE CLASSIC MAYA MOON GODDESSThe Classic period Moon Goddess often appearswith a lunar crescent, and she sometimes has a rabbitcompanion (Fig. 4.10d2, g). She often wears a netskirt, and she seems to be a counterpart of the youth-ful Goddess I of the codices (Taube 1992b : 64 – 69).The Classic Maya Maize God can substitute forthe Moon Goddess in Glyph C of the Lunar Series(Fig. 4.10a; Kelley 1976 : 92, fig. 32). The two deitiestake identical roles, marking the same six-monthlunar semester in the eighteen-month synodic lu-nar calendar (Linden 1996, fig. 2l, table 2). Taube(1992b : 68) notes that the Moon Goddess often wearsthe latticed or net skirt of beads, face markings, andthe coiffure of the Tonsured Maize God. He suggeststhat they are merged or conflated in some contexts,pointing out that the moon, the earth, and maizeare collectively known as ‘‘Our Mother’’ among thehighland Mam. The Yucatec Maya say that the VirginMary in her aspect as the Moon Goddess is ‘‘beauti-He sees little reason for distinguishing the Pauahtunsfrom the Bacabs and suggests that the terms ‘‘Mam’’and ‘‘Bacab’’ are simply epithets for Pauahtun.After the great flood, the four Bacabs were placedin four parts of the world to hold up the heavens,and each was associated with a different year-bearer,color, and direction (Tozzer 1941 : 136 –137). TheYucatec Maya worshiped the Bacabs and Pauahtunsin the Uayeb festival, the five-day period marking theend of the old year, honoring a different Bacab andPauahtun in each of the four years of the year-bearercycle. Alfred Tozzer (1941 : 137 n. 638) notes thatColonial period sources designate the Pauahtuns asangels of the winds linked with the Uayeb ceremo-nies. The Pauahtuns and Bacabs are clearly distin-guished from the Uayeb gods represented by clay orwooden idols destroyed at year end (Tozzer 1941 :139 n. 646). The Uayeb god seems to be equivalentto the Mam, a piece of wood dressed and then dis-carded or buried at year end, according to Cogo-lludo. God N’s name seems to relate him specificallyto the Pauahtuns. Nonetheless, Taube (1989b : 355)suggests that God N may be linked with the Uayebpossum gods representing the old year at the top ofthe New Year pages in the Dresden Codex (25 – 28),for God N sometimes has possum traits. In any case,God N’s counterpart took part in the ceremoniesduring the five-day Uayeb period at the end of theold year.In his role as a god of the year’s end, God N’s vari-ous guises could relate to symbols connected withthe four different directions associated with the year-bearers. His varying attributes could also be linkedwith four different lunar phases. When viewed overa four-year cycle, the Moon at year end would be ata different point in its 29.5-day cycle each year, be-cause twelve synodic lunar months fall about 11 daysshort of the 365-day year. Perhaps God N representsa male aspect of the Moon linked with the year end.Other alternatives could explain God N’s four differ-ent aspects. Two of the planets also are characterizedby a quadripartite nature in their four phases. Venuscomes to mind first, but the fact that God N appearsin the Venus pages of the Dresden Codex positionedabove the Morning Star suggests that he does not150LUNAR IMAGES AND DEITIES"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"ful lady, embracer of maize’’ (Thompson 1954 : 28).The ‘‘ear-of-maize’’ moon is a term used to referto both the full moon and the waning moon invarious Colonial period Yucatec dictionaries (Lamb1981 : 247).On Copa ́ n Stela H, a royal figure wears a long net-ted skirt, a guise linked with both the Maize God andthe Moon Goddess (Baudez 1994, figs. 23 – 24). Eliz-abeth Newsome (1991 : 276 – 279) interprets the fig-ure as the ruler 18 Rabbit (18 Jog) dressed as theMaize God. On the other hand, Tatiana Proskour-iakoff (1993 : 127) identifies the figure as a woman,most probably the wife of the ruler. Claude-Franc ̧ oisBaudez (1994 : 62) says the figure is probably a maledressed as a female, because a loincloth covers thefigure’s skirt. The stela bears the date 4 Ahau 18Muan (9.14.19.5.0; 11/29/730), which coincides withthe full moon. In my opinion, the royal figure takesthe guise of the Moon Goddess merged with theMaize God because the full moon’s gender is am-biguous around the full moon, when it transformsto a male, according to contemporary Quiche ́ ac-counts. A cob of fully developed corn appears inthe headdress, suggesting the ripened corn readyfor harvest in November. The monument may referto harvesting practices like those that survive todayamong the Tzotzil and Quiche ́ Maya, who time themaize harvest by the full moon.Sometimes the lunar symbol surrounds an an-cestor figure visualized as a transformation of themoon, as on Yaxchila ́ n Stela 4 (Fig. 4.10b; Tate 1986 :65; 1992 : 61). Here the moon symbol has cross-hatched design (netting?), a detail characteristic ofmany lunar symbols. The companion cartouchewith a solar ancestor has mirrors. Perhaps the deifiedancestors of the ruling family were compared to thesun and the moon as a conjugal couple, a relation-ship that survives in Maya folklore today.At Palenque, inscriptions compare the mother ofPacal II to the legendary moon mother, who was thefirst ruler of Palenque (Robertson 1985b, table III;Schele and Freidel 1990 : 227, 244 – 245). Schele andFreidel note that the moon was the mother of thegods at Palenque. She was married to GI8(First Fa-ther), who established the order of time and spacejust after the fourth world creation on 4 Ahau8 Cumku. Their children were born 754 years afterthe beginning of the epoch, but the lunar goddess(First Mother) and her husband were born in theprevious epoch or age. First Mother was 760 yearsold when she gave birth to three divine children overan eighteen-day period. Research suggests that theeldest of the three is Venus (GI), the second born isthe Sun God (GIII), and the youngest (GII) is an-other planet, just as modern Maya legends identifythe Moon Goddess as the mother of the Sun and hisplanetary siblings (Chapters 1, 3, 5). About 35 yearslater First Mother acceded to the throne of Palenqueas the first ruler on a date recorded in the Temple ofthe Cross (2.1.0.14.2 9 Ik 0 Yax; Lounsbury 1991 :813; Robertson 1985b, table III). This mythologicalrecord relates to Thompson’s (1960 : 83) belief that theyoung Moon Goddess represented the first woman inthe world.Alfonso Arellano (1995) notes that Pacal II inher-ited the throne from his mother, which was an un-usual line of descent; therefore, he probably wantedto legitimize her lineage and his right to the throneby claiming direct descent from the gods through hismother’s line. His mother and the founding goddessbear the same name: Sak Bak’, or Zac Bak in the Co-lonial period orthography (Fig. 4.10e). Dennis Ted-lock (1992 : 254) reads this name as Lady Egret (sakbak’ ha’), referring to the snowy egret. On the otherhand, Mathews (1990 : 96) says that Bak can mean‘‘heron’’ or ‘‘bone.’’ I would suggest her name is‘‘white heron.’’ Arellano (1995) proposes that thename glyph of the goddess was transformed into theemblem glyph of Palenque, making the lords of Pal-enque the ‘‘sacred lords of the lineage of the whiteheron.’’ The heron apparently substitutes for the lu-nar rabbit in the Palenque emblem glyph, suggestinga lunar connection. An Aztec account notes that theMoon God wore a heron-feather headdress (Saha-gu ́ n 1950 –1982, 7 : 5).Glyphic representations of the Moon Goddesson monumental sculpture from Palenque depict aportrait head glyph with an ‘‘IL’’ sign on the cheekand a lunar crescent (T683) framing the back of thehead (Fig. 4.10c). The same face, without the lunarTHE CLASSIC MAYA MOON GODDESS151"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"crescent, is used for the head variant of the numberone (T1000). Martha Macri (1982) proposes thatdifferent head-variant numbers relate to different lu-nar phases, the head variant of the number one re-ferring to the first visible crescent.In the Naj Tunich cave, a Classic period paint-ing depicts a lunar deity copulating with God N(Fig. 4.10f ). The figure has hair worn in a long curl,like Goddess I of the codices, but the headdress andbody shape seem masculine, making the gender am-biguous. Originally identified as the Moon Goddess,the figure is now believed to be a male impersonat-ing a female as part of a ritual performance (Stone1995b :143 –145). Such impersonations occur in amodern Tzotzil Maya festival in which a Chamulaman found guilty of sexual infractions is dressed asa woman when he plays both a clown and the Span-ish Lady of Passions representing the moon / VirginMary deity (Gossen 1986 : 233).Some terra-cotta figurines show the youthfulMoon Goddess wrapping her arm around the shoul-ders of her animal alter ego, variously represented asa rabbit or a feline (Romain 1988, pls. 38, 39, 52).Others show her as the industrious weaver workingon her backstrap loom or as a licentious courtesanembracing the old God N (Schele and Miller 1986 :143 –144, pls. 51–52). These amorous couples havea counterpart in conjugal pairings of Goddess I withvarious gods in the codices (Fig. 4.7f – g). It is pos-sible that the scenes involving God N refer either toan astronomical body in conjunction with the moonor to a male alter ego of the moon.Maya vase paintings depict the young Moon God-dess in amorous scenes with God N (Taylor 1992 :523). Often she appears as a ‘‘dragon lady’’ wrappedin a snake while God N peers from the serpent’sjaws and fondles her breasts or makes her an of-fering (Fig. 4.10h; Kerr 1990 : 210, no. 2067; Rob-icsek and Hales 1981, vessels 8 –12). Sometimesshe kneels in submission to God N cradled in thesnake’s jaws (Kerr 1990 : 272, no. 2715). The giantserpent recalls scenes showing the lunar jaguarwrapped in a snake (Pl. 4; Robicsek and Hales1982, no. 16).An incised vessel from the American Museum ofNatural History shows a mirror-marked snake car-rying a lunar crescent that encloses the Moon God-dess (Fig. 4.10d; Schele and Miller 1986 : 303). Thislooped snake is discussed in Chapter 7. She wears ashort latticed bead skirt and a maize foliation in herheaddress, attributes that suggest she is merged withthe Maize God (Taube 1992b : 68).In Classic period Maya vase painting, the MoonGoddess may be seated on a sky-band throne withthe lunar crescent, or she may have the moon signtucked under her arm, like the Postclassic MoonGoddess on Dresden Codex 49a (Fig. 4.7i; Coe1978b, nos. 7, 16; 1982, no. 12). In one such scene,she seems to have traits of the Jaguar War God, in-cluding a cruller wrapping around her eyes andFIG. 4.10.a:Maize God substituting for Moon Goddessin lunar Glyph C of Lunar Series (after Thompson 1960,fig. 29, no. 17).b:Lunar symbol used for female ancestor (Yaxchila ́nStela 4; after Tate 1992, fig. 86).c:Glyphic representations of Moon Goddess with ‘‘IL’’marking on cheek and lunar crescent framing back ofhead (Palenque Temple XVIII; after Schele and Mathews1979, nos. 446, 471).d1:Mirror-marked snake wrapped around lunar cres-cent enclosing Moon Goddess and her lunar rabbit, whileanother lunar rabbit with mirror sign blows trumpet;d2:detail of Moon Goddess and her lunar rabbit (AmericanMuseum of Natural History vase; after Schele and Miller1986, pl. 120a).e:Palenque ancestor named White Heron (Zac Bak)may be ancestor with lunar connections (Temple ofCross, Palenque; after Robertson 1991, fig. 9).f:Late Classic lunar deity copulating with God N(Drawing 18, Naj Tunich, Guatemala; after Stone 1995b,fig. 6.28).g:Moon Goddess with cruller nose and bound hankof hair seen on Jaguar War God (after Taube 1992b,fig. 43d).h:Snake wraps around Moon Goddess as ‘‘dragonlady’’ in amorous scene with God N, who emerges fromjaws of snake with tail ending in image of God K (afterStone 1995b, fig. 6-30).THE CLASSIC MAYA MOON GODDESS153"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"A codex-style vase shows masculine and feminineaspects of the moon in separate narrative vignettes(Pl. 6). The lunar twin, Yax Balam (Xbalanque),holds up a plate that contains the decapitated headof Hun Nal (Hun Hunahpu), symbolizing his fatherthe Maize God (Coe 1989 : 178, fig. 27; Taube 1985,fig. 1). In my opinion, this image refers to the maizeharvest. Another scene shows the dark-faced MoonGoddess seated before an ipthyphallic Maize Godwith liquid dripping from his penis. Taylor (1992 :522 –523) identifies this scene as the resurrection ofmaize, with the Maize God perforating his penis incelebration of his rebirth. She notes that the MoonGoddess offers him a Xoc head (a fish?) and a Spon-dylus shell symbolizing the moon’s role in helping inthe rebirth of maize. This interpretation can be car-ried further because blood is equated with semenand seeds. The semen is a symbol for the maize seedsoffered to the young Moon Goddess, who holds upa Spondylus shell that may be symbolic of her womband regeneration. Even though Freidel and Schele(1988) identify the Sun and Venus as the primaryicons of sacrifice and regeneration in Maya theology,it seems that the Moon is also important in imageryof cosmic rebirth. The date associated with the phal-lic scene is 13 Muluc 8 Zip (Schele 1992b :127). Thisis not a viable date, owing to the structure of the cal-endar; possibly this date should be 13 Muluc 7 Zip,corresponding to April 21, 626 (N.S.), near when themaize seeds would be planted.Quiche ́ agricultural practices explain the iconog-raphy on this vessel. The annual maize planting isdone during the waxing moon, when the moon isfemale, but the first ears of corn are picked at the fullmoon, when the moon is male (B. Tedlock 1992b :183 –185). The vase shows that the young MoonGoddess receives the Maize God’s seed during thewaxing moon, and subsequently the masculine fullmoon, Yax Balam, picks the harvested maize.Some Classic period vessels seem to show theMoon Goddess as a water carrier, a role connectedwith Goddess O in the codices. Coe (1982, no. 12)identifies a female holding a water jar on her shoul-der as the young Moon Goddess. Her role as a watercarrier is more like codical images of the aged Moonbound hank of hair (Fig. 4.10g). Here she wears thetraditional netted skirt, and the lunar rabbit is hercompanion. God L’s headdress with the numberthirteen is placed before her throne. This is one of anumber of scenes that suggest that she or her lunarrabbit has taken God L’s regalia (Taube 1992b : 85).She holds out beads, seeming to hand them to anaged god (God D?), evoking a connection with Co-lonial period glosses that say the word for moon(u) also means ‘‘necklace of glass beads’’ (Lamb1981 : 246).Ceramic paintings of the Moon Goddess mosttypically depict a lunar eye crescent, an underarmcrescent, and a rabbit (Taylor 1992 : 519 –521). How-ever, Dicey Taylor points out that many lunar figuresdo not conform to these features. Sometimes theMoon Goddess is named with a female portrait head(T1000) bearing a hair knot above the brow and aT683 lunar crescent (Pl. 5).A polychrome vase first published by FrancisRobicsek and Donald Hales (1982, no. 1) shows anarrative sequence that represents different aspectsof the moon (Pl. 5). Taylor (1992 : 521) interpretsthis as multiple views of the Moon Goddess, show-ing her descent into the underworld at dawn, whereshe joins the aged Moon lord. An interesting de-tail, not discussed by Taylor, is the ball-game beltshe wears as she descends through the sky band.This makes her a female lunar ballplayer, apparentlya counterpart for the female aspect of Xbalanqueknown in one version of the Popol Vuh. Subse-quently, she is transformed into a lunar queen over-seeing her court. Here the Moon Goddess has awater-lily headdress and a lunar name (T1000 aboveT683). The sequence may represent the transforma-tion of the moon from a ballplayer to a water-lilygoddess, perhaps an image of seasonal change orphase changes. Male companions in the scene in-clude God N figures and an aged Moon Lord with alunar title, who is seated on a jaguar-skin thronebearing what may be stylizedpo(moon) glyphs.He may be the full moon, sometimes represented asmale in contemporary Maya accounts. The sky bandrepresents the place where the ecliptic crosses theMilky Way (Chapter 7).154LUNAR IMAGES AND DEITIES"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Goddess. She has a shell painted on her garment,evoking lunar connections, and the dark face paint-ing around the eye may also be a lunar trait.Taube (1992b : 51c) illustrates a rare Classic pe-riod image of the aged Goddess O on a painted ves-sel. Here the old goddess has a jaguar ear like theone symbolizing the day sign Ix and a spotted eye(Thompson 1960 : 89). She vomits liquid, much likethe moon produces menstrual blood and rainwater,according to contemporary Maya accounts. This re-calls another scene that shows a Water-lily Jaguarvomiting liquid into a jar (Kerr 1992 : 405, no. 3312)and Postclassic images of Goddess O issuing liq-uids from her body (Fig. 4.8g). Given the parallels,the Classic period Goddess O might be the waningmoon during the rainy season. In light of the felinetraits associated with the she-jaguar, the lunar twinin theEl Tı ́tulo de Totonicapa ́n(7v), it is certainlyintriguing that the aged Goddess O may have jaguarfeatures in the Classic and Postclassic periods.In sum, the Moon Goddess in Classic Maya art isoften accompanied by her lunar crescent, but thiselement is not necessarily the defining feature in hericonography. Often her lunar traits are more subtle,expressed in costume and coiffure that link her withthe lunar complex. Her headdress may include a wa-ter lily or maize foliation. Her skirt sometimes has alattice of jade beads, much like the net skirt wornby the more youthful aspects of the Moon Goddessat Chiche ́ n Itza ́ . She is only rarely represented inmonumental sculpture, most commonly in glyphicinscriptions with a lunar infix, such as Glyph C ofthe Lunar Series. Other aspects of the Moon God-dess are linked with royal ancestors and lineages onmonumental sculpture. The lunar lineage seems tobe especially important at Palenque, where a layeredmetaphor refers to the ancestral Moon Goddess asthe founder of a dynasty. Maya vase paintings areideal for study of lunar imagery because they shownarrative scenes that sometimes involve multiple im-ages of the moon, apparently referring to changingphases and seasons of the moon. An aged aspect ofthe Classic Maya Moon Goddess is occasionally rep-resented, but the youthful goddess is much more of-ten represented in this medium.THE EVER-CHANGING MOONThis chapter shows that we have only begun to un-ravel the mystery of the moon among the Maya.There is considerable variety in the lunar complex,quite possibly a reflection of images representing dif-ferent phases and lunar seasons. The metaphor forchanging lunar phases is a woman growing up andgrowing old, best seen in youthful and aged variantsof the Moon Goddess in the codices of the Postclas-sic period. The youthful Goddess I may represent themoon from first visibility to the full moon. The wan-ing moon is represented by an aged aspect of God-dess I, a hybrid variant (I-O), and Goddess O in hermore human form. The aged Goddess O as the wan-ing moon lacks monstrous features because the wan-ing moon is not considered particularly malevolent.Only at the new moon does she take on a monstrousform with feline claws.The two most important Postclassic lunar imagesare those relating to weaving and serpents, bothapparently metaphorical images of lunar motion.During the dry season, the moon weaves like aweaver as it moves back and forth across the ecliptic.The dry-season Moon Goddess, usually representedby aged Goddess I or the hybrid Goddess I-O,weaves through the sky on a cotton cord, her un-dulating motion connected with the weaving activi-ties of the dry season. The rainy-season Moon God-dess, usually Goddess O or hybrid forms of thegoddess (I-O), pours water and wears a snake head-dress symbolizing undulating lunar motion.Metaphorical images in the codices define attri-butes and roles of the young Moon Goddess. Themoon’s rapid motion through the sky is seen in im-ages of Goddess I as a licentious lover visiting hermany sky lovers. Goddess I’s connection with medi-cine is evident in scenes showing her carrying birdssymbolizing various diseases. Her role as a mothergoddess is clear in scenes showing her carrying herdivine children. Judging from the frequency of deityimages in the Postclassic period, the moon was moreimportant than the sun. The reverse seems to be truein the Classic period.Color symbolism is another element distinguish-THE EVER-CHANGING MOON155"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Coe (1989 : 166) notes that jaguar figures onClassic period ceramics show an ‘‘almost proteanvariability.’’ Such variability may reflect transforma-tions associated with the changing lunar seasons orphases. The Jaguar War God, also known as the Jag-uar God of the Underworld, is seemingly connectedwith the Moon, Venus, and the dry season, the sea-son of warfare. On the other hand, the Water-lilyJaguar is a deity that may embody the rainy-seasonMoon draped with seasonal vegetation. Other jaguaraspects of the Moon include Yax Balam, the counter-part to Xbalanque and God CH of the codices.A number of animals are metaphorically linkedwith the moon. Fish, mollusks, frogs, and toads areconnected with the moon’s watery nature, for themoon seems to control all bodies of water. The lu-nar rabbit embodies the moon in a number of ways,and its hopping motion may even be another meta-phor expressing rapid motion and the way the moonjumps back and forth across the ecliptic.Seen in the light of natural history, lunar imageryis transformed from a bewildering array of incon-sistencies to a more cohesive picture reflecting thechanging aspects of the moon. The moon has re-mained mysterious because scholars have been look-ing forthemoon. In fact, there are many moons. Ifwe consider the four lunar phases and thirteen lunarmonths, there may be fifty-two different moons!ing the lunar goddesses of the codices. Different col-ors of the moon may relate to seasonal imagery.White often appears in the name of an old lunargoddess involved in weaving and in the name ofa youthful goddess of the waxing moon associatedwith sexual pleasures, children, or symbols of dis-eases. The color red is used for aged goddesses linkedwith water pouring and rainbows.The eclipsed full moon is sometimes representedby an aged face in Postclassic times, but more com-monly it is a youthful female with death attributes.On the other hand, the new moon can take on amonstrous aspect closely linked with the aged God-dess O, especially when the moon threatens the sunwith eclipse at the time of the new moon. Imagery ofGoddess O is relatively rare in the Classic period butseems to be increasingly important in the TerminalClassic period in monumental images such as thosefrom Chiche ́ n Itza ́ . Classic period images of solarand lunar eclipses are poorly understood. The key totheir imagery may lie embedded in the Lunar Seriesglyphs that track the eclipse cycle.During the Classic period, changing lunar phasesseem to be indicated by different genders. Some-times the Moon God is merged with the Maize Godin imagery that seems to refer to the full moon, ap-parently reflecting a special link between the fullmoon and the maize harvest still seen today. Themasculine moon, visualized as a jaguar ballplayerwho is the twin of the sun, may also symbolize thefull moon.156LUNAR IMAGES AND DEITIES"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"5VENUS AND MERCURY:THE BODY DOUBLESOf all the planets, Venus is clearly the most important in Maya art, cosmology, andcalendrics. Like the Moon, Venus has multiple personalities. Different Venus godsembody various phases and seasonal aspects. Some manifestations of Venus seem tobe connected with the rainy season and agricultural fertility; others reflect warfareand the dry season. A Venus cult linked with central Mexico emphasizes the feath-ered serpent. Central Mexican influence also is evident in a Tlaloc cult connectedwith Venus warfare during the Classic period. Chac, a Yucatec Maya deity mergedwith Tlaloc in some contexts, is also associated with Venus. Sometimes Venus andthe Sun are conflated in imagery that suggests conjunction, as in the case of HunAhau, who is linked with both the underworld Sun and Venus.Except for possible links with owl imagery, we have little information on Mercury,and it is difficult to identify Mercury in Maya art. The reader should be cautioned,however, that some images identified as Venus deities may actually refer to Mercury.And, in this context, we should not ignore the possibility that God N, discussed inChapter 4, may be linked with Mercury.This chapter begins with an analysis of the type of Venus observations made bythe Maya and follows with a look at Colonial period accounts of Venus. PostclassicVenus images discussed include the Dresden Codex Venus table representing fivedifferent deities that show the Morning Star rising at different times of year. Thechapter also incorporates a study of central Mexican Venus images and their rela-tionship to Maya Venus images; an examination of Venus connections with dynastichistory and the role of warfare in the Venus cult; an analysis of images that mayincorporate information about the sidereal position of Venus and images that pairthe Moon and Venus. It concludes with a short section on Mercury.VENUS OBSERVATIONS AMONG THE PRECOLUMBIAN MAYAThe first and last visibility of Venus were certainly of great interest to the Maya, withthe first visibility being especially important in the Dresden Codex. In calculatingthese events, the Dresden Codex uses canonical intervals for the different phases,rather than recording observations of the real intervals. The reappearance of theMorning Star, however, does seem to be keyed to actual observations. The DresdenCodex records the eight-year Venus Almanac, noting 584 days as the average lengthof an individual Venus cycle, quite close to the true average. The phases of the syn-odic period are modified to create canonical intervals, and only the 8-day period"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Since the average period when Venus was visiblein the morning and evening sky is close to the lengthof one Tzolkin (260 days), the Maya may have usedsubsets of the Tzolkin to record intervals withinthe period of visibility. The period of ascent as theMorning Star is quite rapid (about 80 days), andthe Evening Star phase involves a rapid descent whenVenus seems to dive down in only 80 days. Venus isespecially bright during the period of descent, but itstime of greatest brilliance is when it makes its ascentin the Morning Star phase. Both the phases are rep-resented by specific images in Maya art discussed inlater sections.Scholars have proposed that the Maya observedmaximum elongations, that is, when Venus is far-thest removed from the Sun (about 477). LindaSchele and David Freidel (1990 : 444 – 446) claimthat a significant position is reached when the datein question is within 17of maximum elongation. Onthe other hand, Venus remains near maximum elon-gation for relatively long periods of time. This fact,along with the difficulty of ascertaining the exacttime of greatest elongation without modern com-puter-generated tables, makes the greatest elongationan unlikely candidate for naked-eye observations.Nonetheless, the Maya could have noted that Venusrises three hours before the Sun around the timeof maximum elongation and is therefore positionedrelatively high in the sky (Aveni 1980 : 85). Andaround the spring equinox, the maximum altitudeof Venus approximately coincides with its maximumelongation (H. Bricker 1996, fig. 8).Anthony Aveni and Lorren Hotaling (1994 : S31)believe that the Maya observed Venus when it wasat its maximum altitude. In their analysis of a setof ninety-eight Classic Maya dates with astronom-ical ‘‘tags’’ (star glyphs or related iconography), theyfound that the dates often correlated with timeswhen Venus was high in the sky (Aveni and Hota-ling 1994 :S34 – S35). Furthermore, the astronomicaldates more often coincide with Evening Star visibil-ity, with 70 percent of the dates corresponding tothat period. The Classic Maya evidently focused onthe Evening Star, a conclusion confirmed in studiesby Ivan Sprajc (1993a, 1993b).of inferior conjunction can be considered accurate.The codex records 90 days for superior conjunction,when the true average for this period is around 50days, and it notes the Morning Star interval as 236days and the Evening Star period as 250 days, al-though in reality these phases are approximately thesame length, averaging around 263 days. As we willsee, the Postclassic Maya chose canonical intervals forVenus phases in order to lock in with the lunar cycles.The Venus Almanac of the Dresden Codex is liketheoctaeterisof classical antiquity, linking eight solaryears, five Venus synodic periods, and ninety-ninelunar months (Aveni 1992b : 104). In the discussionthat follows, we will see architectural reliefs that in-corporate the numbers five and eight as a referenceto this Venus Almanac. Ceremonies alluding to theeight-year Venus Almanac are not yet documented,but records may be embedded in Maya texts. A simi-lar interval is evident today in Lacando ́ n rituals per-formed every eight years (McGee 1990 : 51). Further-more, the Venus Almanac is apparent in the AztecAtamalcualiztli festival, which can be traced back toClassic period Teotihuaca ́ n (Milbrath 1995d).Clearly the Maya observed and recorded thechanging horizon positions of Venus in relation tothe eight-year Venus Almanac (Aveni 1991). The ho-rizon extremes of Venus correlate with the beginningand end of the rainy season in Mesoamerican lati-tudes; the greatest northern extreme occurs in lateApril or early May and the southern extreme in lateOctober or early November (Aveni 1979; 1980 : 93 –94, fig. 37; Sprajc 1987 –1988 : 94). Evidence for suchorientations is seen at Uxmal (discussed below). AtChiche ́ n Itza ́ , an oblique line from the inner left tothe outer right of Window 1 of the Caracol observa-tory points to the northern extreme of Venus as theEvening Star at 287538north of west, whereas anoblique line from inner left to outer right in Win-dow 2 points to its southern extreme at 277498southof west (Fig. 3.1b). The lunar standstill alignmentsillustrated by Sharer (1994 : fig. 7.6) are not valid;they are based on fieldwork from the 1930s that hasbeen disproved by Aveni’s work (Aveni 1975, 180,fig. 4, table 4; 1980 : 258–267, figs. 90–91; Aveni et al.1975).158VENUS AND MERCURY: THE BODY DOUBLES"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Floyd Lounsbury (1982 : 163) notes that the retro-grade period of Venus was important in the Classicperiod. The two stationary points bracket the shortperiod of inferior conjunction, and maximum bril-liance as Morning Star follows only a few weeks afterthe second stationary point, just as the Evening Staris most brilliant a few weeks before the first station-ary point.This summary of observational features associatedwith Venus serves as a departure point for discussionof Venus imagery. All of these Venus cycles may beevident in Maya dates and images. As will be seen,the greatest emphasis was placed on the Venus Al-manac of five Venus cycles in eight solar years. Studyof astronomically tagged dates suggests that the Eve-ning Star was of greater importance during the Clas-sic period, but the Dresden Codex shows that theMorning Star received great emphasis in the Post-classic period.VENUS IN THE POPOL VUHDuring the Colonial period, Venus is referred to asthe ‘‘sun passer’’ and the ‘‘great star’’ (nima ch’umil)in a section of the Popol Vuh dealing with the fourthcreation or world age, the historical epoch of theQuiche ́ (Edmonson 1971 : 159). In previous worldages, Venus seems to have had different names.Dennis Tedlock (1985 : 40, 111, 134; 1991) sug-gests that in a previous world age two brothersknown as Hun Hunahpu and Vucub Hunahpu rep-resented the Morning Star playing ball on the easternhorizon. When the lords of death called them to theunderworld, they were killed and the Morning Stardisappeared. Tedlock interprets Hun Hunahpu’s de-capitated head, placed in a tree by order of the deathgods, as a symbol of the first visibility of the EveningStar above the horizon in the west. Hun Hunahpu’shead produces semen that fertilizes the young MoonGoddess, Xquic (Blood Woman), giving birth to Hu-nahpu and Xbalanque. According to Tedlock, priorto their rebirth as the Sun and the Moon — an eventthat issues in the fourth world age — the Hero Twinstook the role of the Morning Star, replacing theirfather and uncle (Tedlock 1991 : 166 –168). He rec-ognizes five episodes involving decapitated headsor balls representing heads and interprets these asfive cycles in the Venus Almanac (Tedlock 1991 :172 –173).Hun Hunahpu’s head on the ball court may be aVenus symbol. The Popol Vuh recounts that whenthe Hero Twins saw their father (Hun Hunahpu), hishead now transformed into a calabash fruit hangingin the fork of a tree in Xibalba, they put him backtogether and left him at the Place of Ball Game Sac-rifice to be worshiped by future generations (D. Ted-lock 1985 : 113, 159). Michael Closs (1989 : 397) as-signs the role of Morning Star to Hun Hunahpu,noting that he stays behind to rule the underworld asthe Morning Star when his son Hunahpu is trans-formed into the Sun.Citing the fact that Hun Hunahpu’s name incor-porates 1 Ahau, Michael Coe (1973 : 93; 1975b : 90)identifies Hun Hunahpu as the Morning Star andVucub Hunahpu as the Evening Star. He notes that1 Ahau implies heliacal rise, and Vucub Hunahpu’sname (equivalent to 7 Ahau) falls 240 days later inthe Tzolkin, suggesting a transformation into theEvening Star. Sprajc (1993a : 40 – 41, 53) questionsthis conclusion, pointing out that the interval fromthe first of the Morning Star and the first of theEvening Star is 313 days on average (or 326 daysin the canonical period of the Dresden Codex). Heconcludes that both Hun Hunahpu and Vucub Hu-nahpu represented the Morning Star — until theirdeath, when Hun Hunahpu’s severed head became asymbol of the Evening Star with its fertilizing pow-ers. Another possibility is that the period of 240 daysapproximates the interval between the first and lastday of the Morning Star (given as 236 in the DresdenCodex), in which case Hun Hunahpu could repre-sent the first of the Morning Star and Vucub Hu-nahpu the Morning Star as it disappears.David Kelley (1980 : S26) identifies Hun Hunahpuas the Maize God and the embodiment of Venus,noting that his name means 1 Ahau (Hun Ahau)in Yucatec. Karl Taube (1992b : 48) agrees that theMaize God is the counterpart of Hun Hunahpu,but he distinguishes Hun Ahau as a separate entitylinked with Hunahpu.

Among the most intrigu-ing ischac ec,a reddish wasp that does not sting,used as a reference to the Morning Star in theRitualof the Bacabs(Roys 1965 : 132, 135). Some dictio-nary references allude to the Evening Star aspect,such asah oczah kin(he who makes the sun enter[the underworld]) andho ́zan ek,glossed as ‘‘the starof the evening,’’ named as the black Bacab of thewest (Lamb 1981 : 235, 242 – 243). Dictionary entriesglossed simply as ‘‘Morning Star’’ or ‘‘Evening Star’’are usually interpreted as Venus, even though theplanet is not always named.Some terms seem to refer to Venus in both morn-ing and evening skies. Among the recorded namesarenoh ek(big star),chac ek(red or great star),chacnoh ek(red, big star), andxux ek(wasp star; Lamb1981 : 242 – 243). All these names appear in contem-porary Yucatec dictionaries (Barrera Va ́ squez 1980).Noh ich,meaning ‘‘great eye,’’ is a name for Venusthat implies a dual nature becauseichcan also mean‘‘twin’’ (Galindo 1994 : 81).Arthur Miller (1982 : 86) describes sky-bandthat Hun Ahau in his death aspect is the same as thechief demon of the underworld known as Hun Ahauin Landa’s Colonial period account (Tozzer 1941:132n. 618). The Motul dictionary glosses a similar name(Cumhau) as ‘‘Lucifer, prince of the devils.’’ EricThompson (1970b : 303) points out that Lucifer de-notes both devil and the Morning Star. This mayalso explain why the Morning Star is sometimeslinked with the devil in Maya ethnographic accounts(Closs 1989 : 395). Taube’s interpretation finds sup-port in the fact that Hunahpu (Junajpu) is namedas the Morning Star by the contemporary Quiche ́(Chapter 1). If this is the case, the Popol Vuh impliesthat the Morning Star is transformed into the Sun atthe beginning of the fourth world age.In sum, one or more sets of brothers may play therole of Venus in the Popol Vuh. The situation is notclear because there are conflicting points of view andevidence can be marshaled to support identifyingboth Hun Hunahpu and Hunahpu with the MorningStar. Whether their brothers were also aspects of Ve-nus remains debatable. Based on evidence presentedin Chapter 3, it seems that Hunahpu symbolizes theunderworld Sun, closely linked with the MorningStar, which announces the Sun’s emergence from theunderworld. Perhaps this image also represents Ve-nus in inferior conjunction with the Sun. This wouldhelp account for the underworld aspect of Hunahpu.Hun Hunahpu may take the role of Venus in the160VENUS AND MERCURY: THE BODY DOUBLESFIG. 5.1.a:Venus as diving god with insect traits (eclipsetable on Dresden Codex 58; after Villacorta and Villacorta1977).b:Tulum diving god adopts pose similar to images ofMaya bees (Structure 25; after Tozzer 1957, fig. 256a).c:Diving god holding honeycomb, probably represent-ing Venus as Evening Star (Late Postclassic ceramic vessel,Mayapa ́ n, Regional Museum of Anthropology, Me ́ rida).d:Diving-bee god (Madrid Codex 80; after Tozzer1957, fig. 256b).e:Postclassic Mixteca-Puebla images of insects withstar-tipped wings (Codex Nuttall 19, 38; after Seler 1960 –1961, 4 : 729, figs. 919, 923).f:Morning Star as Lahun Chan (‘‘10 Sky’’) with scor-pion carapace on torso and stinger terminating in Venusglyph (T510f ); maize-foliation headdress may refer toseason of ripening maize (Dresden Codex 47b; after Seler1904a, fig. 101i).g:Striped star warriors suspended from sky band withOllin sun and Venus glyphs with rays alternating withlobed designs that represent star-tipped insect wings (Co-dex Nuttall 21; after Seler 1960 –1961, 3 : 219, fig. 15).h:Evening Star, Xolotl, faces Sun descending into un-derworld with skeletal Morning Star disappearing in con-junction (Codex Borbonicus 16; after Se ́ journe ́ 1976,fig. 26).i:Nocturnal new-year ceremonies of Ix years with cres-cent moon and howling dog bearing T559 design on ribcage (T559 also in companion glyphic text), probably re-fers to Evening Star as Tzul Ahau, or Tsul Ahaw in revisedorthography (Madrid Codex 37; after Villacorta and Vil-lacorta 1977)."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"71). Closs (1989 : 405 – 406) suggests that Venus actsas the cause or agent of eclipse in this image.A Venus god plays the role of a Bacab raising theheavens after the great flood. The Chilam Balam ofChumayel notes that Lahun Chan (10 Sky) went tothe west, where the black tree of abundance waslocated, when the four Bacabs took their positionat cardinal points to raise the sky after the greatflood. Roys (1967 : 100 –101, 171) suggests that La-hun Chan’s placement in the west equates him withthe Bacab called Hozanek, a name for the EveningStar in Colonial period sources. Lahun Chan is thesame as Lakunchan, an idol with very ugly teeth andclaws described by Diego Lo ́ pez de Cogolludo (Roys1967 : 101 n. 2). From various accounts, Thompson(1960 : 77, 218) concludes that Lahun Chan had thehead of a jaguar and the body of a dog, and hewalked like a drunkard. As we will see, Lahun Chanis more closely connected with the Morning Star.The flood account may indicate that the MorningStar was sent to the west in a time of turmoil.In the Dresden Codex, the glyphic name 10 Skyidentifies Lahun Chan, the same name used in Co-lonial period accounts (Fig. 5.1f ). Maize foliation onhis headdress leads Closs (1989 : 397) to comparehim to Xolotl, the Aztec god of the Evening Starwho brought maize to humankind, according to theAnales de Cuauhtitla ́n.The Codex Borbonicus pairsthe canine Xolotl with the Sun descending into theunderworld, clearly indicating a role as the EveningStar (Fig. 5.1h). Closs suggests that Lahun Chan isthe counterpart of a Maya dog deity named TsulAhaw (Tzul Ahau), because of the resemblance ofLahun Chan’s rib cage to T559, a glyph interpretedlogographically as ‘‘dog’’ (tsulortzul). One of theNew Year pages in the Madrid Codex clearly showsa dog with a similar T559 rib cage howling at theMoon (Fig. 5.1i). Indeed, the name Tsul Ahaw ap-pears as the last glyph compound on the page, aname apparently linked with the Evening Star (Fig.5.7r; Closs 1989, fig. 31.5). The Evening Star may beTsul Ahaw as Closs proposes, but this name, associ-ated with a canine figure and a diving insect in thecodices, is not used for Lahun Chan (Fig. 5.1a). La-hun Chan clearly plays the role of the Morning Starin the Dresden Codex, and he has a different glyphicdesigns on Postclassic murals from Santa Rita andTulum as stylized images of Venus as the ‘‘wasp star’’(Fig. 3.3b). Stanislaw Iwaniszewski (1987 : 211) sug-gests that a relief on Structure 5 represents Venus asa diving figure (Marquina 1964, pl. 399). Ralph Roys(1967 : 63 n. 7) identifies the Tulum diving figures asthe Maya bee god, Ah Muzencab. Structures 5, 16,and 25 all depict similar figures that resemble Mayaimages of bees (Fig. 5.1b, d). Indeed, at the RegionalMuseum of Anthropology in Me ́ rida, a Late Post-classic ceramic vessel depicts a similar diving godholding a honeycomb framed by stacked log hives(Fig. 5.1c). The Mixteca-Puebla Codex Nuttall de-picts bees and possibly wasps with pairs of gauzywings (Fig. 5.1e). The connection between Venusand bees and wasps is evident because the wings arevery similar to Venus symbols in sky bands of thesame codex. These have a star in the center radiatingtwo gauzy wings that alternate with three red rays(Fig. 5.1g). The Venus glyph seems to represent theinsect aspect of Venus. The five radiating elementsallude to the ‘‘fiveness’’ of Venus implicit in the Ve-nus Almanac’s five synodic periods.Although Arthur Miller (1982 : 87, 89 – 91, 97)links the Tulum diving figures to the cult of theMorning Star, they seem more closely connectedwith imagery of the Evening Star. The diving poseevokes Venus making its rapid descent over thecourse of 80 days. These diving gods are positionedon the west face of the temple structures, and thetemples themselves have a west-facing entry, a pat-tern that would seem to be linked with the EveningStar (Sprajc 1993a, 1993b). Maize foliation on theheaddress of the diving god at Tulum is appropriatein light of a pattern linking maize and the EveningStar noted by Sprajc (Fig. 5.1b). Cords attached tothe diving gods probably symbolize the eclipticalcord linking the sky and Earth, as well as a pathof descent for Venus moving into the underworld.This is reminiscent of images of Venus as Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl descending on a cord in the Codex Vin-dobonensis (Fig. 5.4f; Milbrath 1988a).In the Dresden Codex eclipse table (58b), a bee orwasp aspect of Venus is represented by a diving godwith a Venus glyph as its head and a knifelike tail thatsuggests an insect abdomen (Fig. 5.1a; Aveni 1992b :162VENUS AND MERCURY: THE BODY DOUBLES"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"name (10 Sky; Fig. 5.1f ). Indeed, Lahun Chan doesnot even have canine traits. On close inspection wecan see that Lahun Chan’s torso is the scorpion tho-rax seen on other Venus gods, such as God L in theMadrid Codex (Fig. 5.11b). This is made clear by thefact that Lahun Chan’s headdress has a beaded ele-ment representing the scorpion’s segmented tail, hereterminating with a Venus glyph. The ‘‘rib cage’’ onthe dog of the Evening Star is a scorpion thorax(Fig. 5.1i).In sum, the Colonial period accounts relate toPostclassic imagery of Venus, most notably in the in-sect aspects of Venus. A diving bee or wasp may belinked with imagery of the Evening Star’s rapid de-scent. Venus is also equated with a sky-bearer or Ba-cab (Hozanek) associated with the Evening Star. La-hun Chan, named in Colonial period records, has hiscounterpart in Postclassic representations of Venus asthe Morning Star, where he has scorpion traits alsoseen on the canine Evening Star. As we will see, thebest single source of evidence for imagery of the Post-classic Venus god is found in the Dresden Codex.THE DRESDEN CODEX VENUS PAGESThe Dresden Codex Venus pages (46 –50) depict themost intriguing astronomical images in the Mayacodices (Fig. 5.3). This section of the codex has longbeen recognized as a Venus Almanac, but its rela-tionship to the chronology of the Yucatec Maya hasbeen debated.John Teeple (1926) showed that the Maya ad-justed for the difference between the true length ofthe synodic period and the canonical Venus Round(VR) of 584 days by including corrections so that theTzolkin calendar of 260 days and the Venus calen-dar would synchronize with the rise of the MorningStar on a day 1 Ahau.

The Tzolkin dates are on lines 1–13,and the subdivisions of the 584-day Venus cycle areon line 26. The Venus cycle incorporates four ca-nonical intervals: 236 days as Morning Star, 90 daysof invisibility around superior conjunction, 250 daysas Evening Star, and 8 days of invisibility around in-ferior conjunction, an interval that actually can varyfrom 0 days up to a few weeks (Aveni and Hotaling1994 : S25). Aveni (1980 : 184 –187) points out thatonly the 8-day period of inferior conjunction ap-proximates the average interval for the correspond-ing Venus event. The other intervals used in the tableare far off the mark. He notes that the Venus periodsin the Dresden Codex are rounded off to conformwith lunar intervals (Aveni 1992a; Justeson 1989).This cycle joins the Sun, the Moon, and Venusin a celestial dance that repeats its sequence everyeight years (Aveni 1997 : 123 –124). Aveni (1991 : 315;1992a : 89 – 90) notes that the table expresses the oc-currence of Venus events in lunar time units, allow-ing the Moon to be observed in relation to Venus.Teeple (1930) pointed out that the canonical Morn-ing Star interval of 236 days has a lunar significance(23658329.5). Thus the Moon would be in thesame phase at the end of this period as it was whenVenus rose at dawn. The 90-day interval for supe-rior conjunction is three lunar months plus 1.5 days,a leeway reflecting differences in the length of thelunar month (29.5 days registered as alternating pe-riods of 29 or 30 days). Justeson (1989 : 94 – 95)points out that the 90th day is the first date that theEvening Star was visible when the Moon was in thesame lunar phase as when Venus rose as the Morn-ing Star. He suggests that the unusual 90-day intervalfor superior conjunction was a Postclassic inventiontriggered by a particular eclipse, following Aveni’s(1990 : 315) discovery that the historical base dates ofthe Venus table are linked to a cycle of eclipses visiblein Yucata ́ n. Justeson (1989 : 95) adds that the numberof lunar months incorporated in the table (813lunar months and 318.5 lunar months) are ‘‘spansfrequently separating, respectively, pairs of visible lu-nar eclipses and a lunar-solar or solar-lunar eclipsesequence.’’ It is no coincidence that the length of theVenus table equals the length of three eclipse tablessubtracting four days at the end of sixty-one VenusRounds (35,624 days or 97.5 years) or by subtractingeight days at the end of fifty-seven Venus Rounds.Scholars disagree as to whether the table shows areal ephemeris used to predict observable positions ofthe planet. Closs (1992) argues that the table repre-sents idealized Venusian synodic periods, represent-ing the mean motions of the planets. On the otherhand, Lounsbury’s (1983) study places the Venustable in the context of Postclassic Maya chronology,correlating the heliacal rise events with specific dates.I favor the latter interpretation and believe that it maybe possible to relate the table to observations of Ve-nus at heliacal (dawn) rise as part of a seasonal cycle.The reference to Long Count dates in the intro-duction and the Calendar Round dates in the alma-nac itself present the possibility of placing the imagesof five Venus gods in the setting of real time, helpingto reveal their seasonal associations. The DresdenCodex Venus pages (46 –50) represent five differentgods of the Morning Star hurling a dart with an at-latl. Eduard Seler (1904b) recognized that the formatof five Venus gods spearing victims with atlatls par-allels scenes in the Postclassic codices of the Borgiagroup. Each of the five manifestations is separatedfrom the next by an interval of 584 days, closely ap-proximating the synodic period of Venus. Each sub-sequent dawn rise occurs about a year and sevenmonths later, and the entire cycle repeats every eightyears.John Justeson (1989 : 100 –101) notes that the useof fixed stations for the Venus cycle in the vague year(365 days) arose because the canonical Venus Roundof 584 days does not accommodate well to the 260-day Tzolkin, repeating only after a prohibitively longperiod of time (104 years), whereas the eight-yearintervals provide a relatively short period for repeats.This suggests that the Venus Almanac developed intandem with the solar calendar.Ernst Fo ̈ rstemann (1906), a German librarian inDresden, first recognized that pages 46 –50 repre-sent a Venus calendar approximating the averagesynodic period of Venus (583.92 days). The layoutof the pages in Dresden Codex 46 –50 presentedby Thompson (1960 : 222; 1972 : 66) shows that eachline running across five pages totals eight years (Fig.166VENUS AND MERCURY: THE BODY DOUBLES"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"plus eight cycles of 260 days, for the Maya relatedlunar and Venus phenomena (Aveni 1992b : 104).After five Venus Rounds, the seasonal cycle of Ve-nus repeats (53584583365), establishing a pat-tern linking each Venus Round to different times ofyear. Over time there would be shift, but the slippagebetween Venus events and the associated solar datesoccurs rather slowly, for the planet appears an aver-age of 5.2 days earlier every two Calendar Rounds(104 years; Lounsbury 1983 : 4, 9). The Maya ad-justed by stopping short of a complete run throughthe table at an earlier 1 Ahau date that was found tobe closer to heliacal rising of the Morning Star. Thisnew date then served as a new base for the table. Theoriginal base was 1 Ahau 18 Kayab (Fig. 5.3f – j, lines13 and 20), and the last time this base was used wasina.d.1038 (10.10.11.12.0). By this time a 5.2-dayerror had accumulated from the previous heliacalrise on 1 Ahau 18 Kayab 104 years earlier (65VR) ina.d.934. By the next pass through the table on the57th VR (line 12, Fig. 5.3g), the table would call fora heliacal rise on 9 Lamat, but the heliacal rise hadslipped back so that it was closer to a 1 Ahau date8 days earlier. At this point they shifted to 1 Ahau18 Uo on lines 12 and 20 (10.15.4.2.0; 12 /4 /1129O.S.). This replacement base involved an 8-day cor-rection. Around the time the table was actually inuse, a new base was introduced involving a 4-daycorrection that shifted the heliacal rise to 1 Ahau 13Mac ina.d.1227 (lines 13 and 14). Subsequently an-other 4-day correction would realign the Venus Al-manac on 1 Ahau 3 Xul ina.d.1324. These dates arecalled bases because they are the ‘‘day zero’’ for aspecific calendar sequence.The introduction to the Venus table on pages 46 –50 of the Dresden Codex appears on page 24. Al-though the page numbers imply that the introduc-tion was separated from the table, Thompson (1972 :18) notes that the codex was split in two and im-properly numbered. He rearranges the pages in hiscommentary to the codex but retains the earlier pagenumbers because of long-standing use.Page 24 opens with glyphic texts referring to a listof Venus names (column A5 –A9, Fig. 5.2) pairedwith the names for regents (column B5 –B9), along-side a third column that names victims speared bythe Morning Star (last five names in column C).Each column closes with a series of calendric inscrip-tions (Table 5.1). Using X to mark the place of non-calendric texts, we can diagram the calendar periodsto be read from top to bottom (lines 1– 27) acrosscolumns A– G. Calendar Round dates appear in col-umns A– C at the bottom, and presumably also at thetop, but here they no longer survive except for thedate 8 Cumku at C2. Figures in parentheses indicatethe total number of days or Venus Rounds.The numbers begin with 6.2.0 displayed verticallyin column A (lines 21– 24), followed by 9.9.16.0.0 incolumn B (lines 14 –19), and 9.9.9.16.0 in column C(lines 18 – 24). The Calendar Round date of 1 Ahau18 Kayab at the bottom of Column B belongs with aLong Count date, displaced by one column appar-ently because there was not sufficient space. Col-umns D through G display multiples of 584 days,except for lines 7 –12, which are correction or cal-culation factors (Table 5.1). The 6.2.0 inscriptionin Column A is a Ring Number, with a ring arounda shell representing zero, indicating it is to be usedin addition or subtraction of an interval totaling2,200 days.The date 9.9.9.16.0 1 Ahau 18 Kayab correspondsto 2 /4 /623 (in the 584,283 correlation preferred here;2 /6 /623 in Lounsbury 1983). This is the earliest datein the table. It is designated as Base A, the first of aseries of fixed dates that mark entry points in thetable (Lounsbury 1983, table 3). Base A falls morethan two weeks before the heliacal rise of Venus, butLounsbury (1983 : 4, fig. 1) considers this an accept-able error because the date was calculated back to atime centuries before the table was recorded. It maybe that the Base A date is not an error, but insteadrefers to a lunar observation made prior to the helia-cal rise of Venus. Aveni (1992, table 3.2) notes thatthe 9.9.9.16.0 date was one of a number of the baseskeyed to lunar eclipses. The 9.9.9.16.0 date, one daybefore the new moon on 2 /5/623, represents the lastvisibility of the Moon in the month following a lunareclipse on 1/22 /623 (Goldstine 1973). The last vis-ible crescent may have begun the lunar month inClassic Maya times (Chapter 4).The 9.9.16.0.0 inscription in column B is usuallyinterpreted as a Long Reckoning (LR) distance num-THE DRESDEN CODEX VENUS PAGES167"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"1980 : 192; 1981:S3 – S4; Lounsbury 1978; McCluskey1983 : 96, 99; Thompson 1960 : 226).

Lounsbury (1992b) proposes that each of thecorrection factors involves subtracting a multiple of2,340 days from a multiple of 65 VR.

Thus the table relates theVenus cycle to the solar year and the Great Cycle oftwo Calendar Rounds (2352 years). The VenusRound interval of 584 days is slightly longer than thetrue length of the Venus cycle (583.92 days), so anerror of approximately 5 days accumulated over 104years (Lounsbury 1983 : 9).Thompson (1960 : 77, 218, 299; 1972 : 65) notesthat the idealized Venus cycle always ended on the day1 Ahau, a day that probably named Venus at heliacalrise. Because two columns of Tzolkin dates on page 47include 1 Ahau dates, a new 1 Ahau base could beadopted when the calendar strayed too far fromthe real heliacal rise date (Fig. 5.3g). Apparently, theMaya waited to make correction until they wereabout to complete 65 Venus Rounds in the secondrun through the table so that they could reuse the 1Ahau Tzolkin date (Lounsbury 1983 : 4 –11, table 3;Thompson 1972 : 62 – 63). With a mean drift of 5.2days after 65 Venus Rounds (104 years), they couldwait until the next cycle on the 57th Venus Round,when the total would be around 8 days, allowing themto recover the 1 Ahau date. They did so by shifting the1 Ahau day assigned to the last visibility of the Eve-ning Star to the first rise of the Morning Star, takingadvantage of the 8-day interval that occurs betweenthose dates on page 47 in the table. This required ashift in the corresponding month as well.Lounsbury notes that betweena.d.934 and 1129,the table shifted from 1 Ahau 18 Kayab (used inBases A–D) to 1 Ahau 18 Uo (Base F). Through suchcalculations a series of base dates have been recon-structed for the table as follows: 9.9.9.16.0 1 Ahau18 Kayab (Base A), 9.14.15.6.0 1 Ahau 18 Kayab(Base B), 10.0.0.14.0 1 Ahau 18 Kayab (Base C),10.5.6.4.0 1 Ahau 18 Kayab (Base D), 10.10.11.12.0 1Ahau 18 Kayab (Base E), 10.15.4.2.0 1 Ahau 18 Uo(Base F), 11.0.3.1.0 1 Ahau 13 Mac (Base G), withthe last base on 11.5.2.0.0 1 Ahau 3 Xul falling inthe fourteenth century. In the layouts proposed byLounsbury (1983, table 3) and Aveni (1992, table 4),the base dates fall at the end of a 104-year runthrough the table, marking the transition from onelowed a foreshortened run through the table, per-mitting a new base to be located on the date 1 Ahauwhen the heliacal rise of Venus strayed too far fromthe canonical 1 Ahau date. On the other hand, bothCloss (1977 : 92) and Justeson (1989 : 93, 97 – 98)consider the 1.5.5.0 interval to be a calculation factorreferring to 15 Venus Rounds plus 340 days, equiva-lent to the interval from canonical setting of theMorning Star to the subsequent canonical setting ofthe Evening Star (153584190125059,100days). Justeson also notes that this interval is use-ful in calculating eclipse cycles between base dates(1 Ahau 18 Kayab base to 1 Ahau 13 Mac base59.11.7.0 days [column E]; 9.11.7.021.5.5.052,025lunar months). Closs says the calculation factorspans the interval from heliacal rise on 1 Ahau 18Kayab in 9.9.9.16.0 forward to the heliacal rising ofthe Evening Star on 1 Ahau 13 Pax, a date not amongthe recorded bases on page 24, but given in the al-manac section on page 47.The bottom three tiers (lines 13 – 27, Columns D –G) refer to even multiples of Venus cycles, each as-sociated with an Ahau date that would be reached byadding the given multiple to the 1 Ahau base (Table5.1). The last tier ends with the inscription 8.2.0,equaling five Venus Rounds and eight years (2,920days). This inscription leads in to pages 46 –50,which represent sets of five Venus Rounds. The Cal-endar Round dates on pages 46 –50 place the five Ve-nus Rounds in relation to eight solar years.In sum, we can see that the introduction to thetable places the Venus events in historical perspective,referring back to a Long Count date of 9.9.9.16.0, thehistorical base of the table in the seventh centurykeyed to the last visible crescent just before the helia-cal rise of Venus. The introduction also provides theframework for counting forward in time from theearly Postclassic period, when the codex was in useat the time of the 1 Ahau 13 Mac base ina.d.1227.THE LAYOUT OF PAGES 46 –50In Dresden Codex 46 –50, each of the five pages cov-ers 584 days, with a cumulative total across five pagesof 2,920 days, equaling five Venus cycles or eight so-lar years of 365 days (Fig. 5.3a – e).

Thus inThompson’s layout (Fig. 5.3j), 1 Ahau in line 13 islinked with 13 Mac in line 14 to form the date11.5.2.0.0, with 18 Kayab in line 20 to form the date10.0.0.14.0, and with 3 Xul in line 25 to form thedate 11.5.2.0.0.Lounsbury (1983 : 11) and Justeson (1989 : 93)agree that the Venus table is contemporary with the1 Ahau 13 Mac base, which they correlate with theLong Count date of 11.0.3.1.0 in June ofa.d.1227(Base G). This dating is generally confirmed by thePostclassic style of the codex, ca. 1150/1250 –1450(Paxton 1990). Furthermore, the two central Mexi-can deities represented in the Venus pages (dis-cussed below) clearly pertain to the Postclassic epoch(Taube 1992b, figs. 56e – g; 67a). Their closest stylis-tic counterparts are seen in Borgia Group manu-scripts, especially Codex Borgia 12 –13, and there isno evidence of deities with similar iconographic de-tails in Classic period imagery from central Mexico.The 13 Mac date is associated with a verb, a flathand (T713a) and mirror (T24 or T617a) com-pound on line 15 just above the glyph for ‘‘east’’on line 16 in the last column before the pictures onpage 50 (Figs. 5.3e; 5.7a). In the Venus table, thiscompound is used to signal times when Venus is vis-ible, including days when Venus first appeared as theMorning Star and canonical dates when it was lastvisible as the Evening Star. The lower section of eachpage shows two other sets of month dates (Fig. 5.3f –j, lines 20 and 25). There are no mirror-hand glyphsassociated with these dates. The associated base datessuggest that line 20 refers to past events and line 25to future events.Lounsbury (1983 : 11) proposes that 1 Ahau 18Kayab was reused repeatedly in base dates froma.d.623 (9.9.9.16.0) througha.d.1038 (10.10.11.12.0).By 1129, the actual Venus events lagged eight daysbehind the heliacal rise dates recorded on line 20, sothe astronomers were able to shift the heliacal riseevent to a date previously used for the last visibil-ity of the Evening Star (1 Ahau 18 Uo; lines 12 and20; Fig. 5.3g), resulting in a new base by 1129(10.15.4.2.0 1 Ahau 18 Uo). This base was reuseduntil 1 Ahau 13 Mac became the base in 1227(11.0.3.1.0). It was recognized that another base shiftwould be required in the future, resulting in a newbase that would be in use bya.d.1324 (11.5.2.0.0 1Ahau 3 Xul). Line 25 predicts the dates when the he-liacal rise would take place in the period 1318 –1324.In other words, the table contains dates for actualVenus events in the past, present, and future.Even though Lounsbury (1983 : 11–16, fig. 1) ac-cepts that 1 Ahau 13 Mac (a.d.1227) is the end pointof the current run of the table, he focuses his analysison the earlier bases. He notes that the 1 Ahau 18 Uo(12 /4 /1129) heliacal rise was significant because Ve-nus was in conjunction with Jupiter as it rose, anevent that had not been seen sincea.d.244 (Louns-bury 1983 : 16 –17, fig. 3). However, he maintainsthat the 1 Ahau 18 Kayab base ina.d.934 is the onlyone to accurately peg the heliacal rise on 11/20/934(Lounsbury 1983 : 8 –13, 17, fig. 2). He finds this es-pecially significant because this date also coincideswith the heliacal rise of Mars, a pairing that had notoccurred sincea.d.6. Despite this intriguing associa-tion with planetary conjunctions, the question re-mains: Why would the table accurately record theheliacal rise ina.d.934 and not ina.d.1227 whenthe table was in use? Dennis Tedlock (1992 : 268)notes that Lounsbury’s reconstruction of the tableusing the 584,285 correlation would mean that ‘‘Ma-yan astronomers let their Venus calendar run a dayor two late,even in the act of correcting it’’ (emphasisin original). He points out that the solution is to ap-ply the 584,283 correlation, which produces not onebut two heliacal rises that fall right on target. Thiscorrelation gives an unbroken chain of events fromthe Postclassic into the Early Colonial period, asThompson (1960 : 305) recognized when he adoptedthe GMT2 correlation in his later work. Further-more, the 584,283 correlation is in accord with theQuiche ́ calendar of today and the Aztec calendar ofthe sixteenth century, a correspondence recognizedby Lounsbury (1992a : 199 – 204).Aveni (1992, table 3.2) compares the canonicaldates with actual heliacal rise dates. Of all the bases,only the dates ina.d.934 (Base D),a.d.1129 (BaseF), anda.d.1227 (Base G) place the canonical eventin proximity (within two days) to the actual heliacalrise. Using Lounsbury’s preferred correlation factor(584,285), he notes that thea.d.934 base is only oneTHE LAYOUT OF PAGES 46 – 150171"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"cuses on current events in the thirteenth century, in-corporating past events as points of reference. Thecurrent run of the table is the eight-year Venus-solarcycle that began in 1219 and closed in 1227 with 1Ahau 13 Mac. In addition to synchronizing the solarand Venus cycles, this run of the table also incorpo-rates a supremely important calendric event. The10th Baktun (11.0.0.0.0; 5/18/1224) came to a closeduring the Morning Star period covered by the firstcolumn on page 49. At this time, Venus was near itsmaximum altitude as Morning Star (reached 28 dayslater; Aveni and Hotaling 1994, table 1).Laying out the table with the first page correlatingwith 5 Kan 7 Xul and the last with 1 Ahau 13 Macgives us five points that record the heliacal rise ofVenus on a specific Calendar Round date in the thir-teenth century (Table 5.2). Both the first and lastCalendar Round dates precisely match with the ac-tual heliacal rise dates of Venus on January 19, 1221,and June 13, 1227 (Aveni 1992, table 3.2). In this lay-out, the last of the five synodic periods of Venus fallstwo days before the summer solstice.In sum, the Calendar Round dates on pages 46 –50 refer to current heliacal rise dates, as well as thosein the past and future, spanning a period from thetenth through the fourteenth centuries. The lock-inpoint for the table is 1 Ahau 13 Mac, just before thesummer solstice ina.d.1227. Although the 584,285correlation provides a close fit with the summer sol-stice ina.d.1227, there seems to be greater precisionin recording the Venus events if we use the GMT2day off, and the 1 Ahau 18 Uo (a.d.1129) and 1Ahau 13 Mac (a.d.1227) bases are each two days off.But if we shift to the 584,283 correlation, now pre-ferred by Aveni, we find that the last two bases (F andG) are perfect matches with the heliacal rise eventson December 4, 1129, and June 13, 1227. This meansthat the previous run of the table (104 years earlier)and the current run ina.d.1227 are both preciseobservations of the event, as would be expected in arecord of recent historical events. As noted previ-ously, the base on 1 Ahau 18 Uo ina.d.1129 islinked to a significant planetary event. When Venusfirst appeared as Morning Star, it was in conjunctionwith Jupiter. Furthermore, the Moon was at lastquarter, locking in a lunar event. Of all the proposedbases, only the 1 Ahau 13 Mac base on June 13, 1227,places the heliacal rise in proximity to an impor-tant solar event. The summer solstice took place on6 /15/1227 in the Julian calendar or 6 /22 /1227 inthe Gregorian calendar (Aveni, personal communi-cation 1995). Since the summer solstice can shift be-tween June 21 and 22 from year to year, the base wasprobably visualized as falling just before the summersolstice. The 1 Ahau 13 Mac base therefore synchro-nizes an important Venus event with a significantevent in the tropical year. Such a link would be ex-pected because the calendar is laid out to show therelationship between five Venus cycles and eight so-lar years.Rather than being a copy of a Classic period table,as has been commonly assumed, the Venus table fo-172VENUS AND MERCURY: THE BODY DOUBLESTABLE 5.2.

The Dresden Codex Ve-nus pages provide a template for understanding theseasonal aspects of five Venus gods representing thenewly emerged Morning Star over the course of aneight-year cycle that was tracked over hundreds ofyears.THE SEASONAL ASPECTS OF VENUSHaving established the probable dates for each page,we can turn to the visual imagery to identify the Ve-nus gods and their companions in relation to theseasonal cycle. The five Venus gods represent theMorning Star in different seasonal aspects. All arepoised with dart throwers in hand, having justspeared their victims below (Fig. 5.3a – e). Seated onsky-band thrones overhead, the regents watch theevents from a distance.On page 46, the first Venus god represents thenewly risen Morning Star in the guise of God L(Fig. 5.3a; Schellhas 1904 : 34 – 35). God L’s name(T1054) is a black-faced portrait glyph with an Imixprefix, a name paired with a Venus glyph on page 46(columns E –F). God L’s warlike nature may be em-phasized in the Dresden Codex, for he is the onlyone of the five shown holding a war shield. He hasan eye volute and a shell beard, attributes that over-lap with those of the Jaguar War God, a god spe-cifically associated with war shields in Classic Mayaiconography (Chapter 4, Fig. 4.2g). Placing the 1Ahau 13 Mac date on page 50 just prior to the sum-mer solstice in 1227 indicates that God L on page 46represents Venus at heliacal rise on 1/19/1221 (Table5.2). He embodies the first appearance of the Morn-ing Star during the height of the dry season, a timeof year for warfare among the Aztecs and the Yuca-tec Maya (Milbrath 1988b : 63; Torquemada 1943, 2 :299). He may also represent the entire period of theMorning Star’s rapid ascent. Taking eighty days as anaverage for the interval from heliacal rise to maxi-mum western altitude provides an idealized periodfor ascent ending on 4 /9/1221 O.S., still well withinthe dry season, the epoch of warfare.Lahun Chan (10 Sky) on page 47 is the secondseasonal manifestation of the Morning Star (Figs.5.1f, 5.3b; Thompson 1972 : 68). The markings onhis torso are the segments of a scorpion thorax, andhis headdress is a scorpion’s tail tipped by a starglyph in place of the stinger, as can be seen by com-paring the image of God L representing Venus onMadrid Codex 79a (Fig. 5.11b). Lahun Chan’s head-dress also has a prominent maize element like that ofGod E. This seems significant because the heliacalrise date on 8/26 /1222 coincides with a time whenthe maize was ripening. If he also embodies theascending Morning Star, the eightieth day falls on11/13/1222 O.S. (11/20/1227 N.S.), coinciding withthe first solar nadir at 197N latitude, a date linkedwith the maize harvest at the onset of the dry season(Milbrath 1988b : 61– 63).Page 48 shows a monkey as the third seasonal as-pect of the Morning Star (Fig. 5.3c). Here the Morn-ing Star has the beard of a male howler and the deerear seen on a number of howler images in ClassicMaya art (Coe 1978a : 345 – 346). The monkey godwears the vulvateoyohualli,an ornament relatinghim to the central Mexican gods of song and dance(Seler 1960 –1961, 2 : 167). When howlers awakebetween 5 and 6a.m., the troop howls to the ris-ing sun, just as the rising Morning Star announcessunrise. Gordon Whittaker (1986 : 57) identifies theglyphic name of the Morning Star god in column Eastawisikala(T96 : 277 : 146.25 : 140), linking it withthe first syllables in Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, a namefor the central Mexican god of the Morning Star. Ve-nus, as a howler monkey rising at dawn on 4 /1/1224,hurls his dart, killing the Maize God at the driesttime of year when all the maize has been harvestedand the stalks are burned, undergoing a form ofdeath. This death is the preface to the rebirth ofmaize. The ascent of the Morning Star over the nexteighty days parallels the rise of the maize plant outof the ground during the first months of the rainyseason.Karl Taube and Bonnie Bade (1991 : 18) were thefirst to recognize the Morning Star god on Dresden49 as a representation of Xiuhtecuhtli, the centralMexican Fire God (Fig. 5.3d). Here the god of theMorning Star bears a phonetic name ofchak xiw(i)teithat resembles the name Xiuhtecuhtli (‘‘turquoiseTHE SEASONAL ASPECTS OF VENUS173"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"marked the beginning of frosts in central Mexico(Nicholson 1971, table 4; Sahagu ́ n 1950 –1982, 2 :121, 7 : 19). Frost is not found in lowland Yucata ́n,where the Dresden Codex was painted, but possiblyItztlacoliuhqui’s association with that time of yearwas retained when his cult was imported from cen-tral Mexico. If we view the Venus god on DresdenCodex 50 as ruling a period of eighty days, his reignlasted until the beginning of September, around thetime of year his festival began in central Mexico. InYucata ́ n, this is the time for doubling over the earsof maize (maı ́z menudo).We can conclude that there are five seasonal as-pects of Venus in the Dresden Codex almanac. Per-haps all the Morning Star gods in the Dresden Codexrule not only the day of heliacal rise but also a periodof up to eighty days associated with the ascent of theMorning Star. If this is the case, we would have a five-part division of the year, with God L on page 46 rulingfrom late January through March, a period associatedwith the season of warfare. The howler monkey onpage 48 reigns from April through mid-June, the sea-son of planting. The blindfolded god on page 50 rulesfrom the summer solstice through the end of August,when the crops are maturing. Lahun Chan on page 47rules from September to early November, when themain harvest began around the end of the rainy sea-son. The central Mexican Fire God on page 49 rulesfrom mid-November through mid-January, a seasonassociated with the beginning of the dry season andFire God rituals in central Mexico.REGENTS AND VICTIMSIN THE VENUS PAGESOn each of the five pages of the Venus Almanac, aregent deity looks over the Venus god spearing a vic-tim (Fig. 5.3a – e). Four of the regents clearly have acelestial quality, because they are seated on sky-bandthrones. All hold overturned jars, but only some ofthe jars seem to hold water. The regents are namedin the second column of page 24 (B5 –B9) in a se-quence beginning with a Pauahtun (God N), who isthe regent on page 48 (his name prefixed by thenumber four). The list ends with the Death God re-gent of page 47 (his name prefixed by a mirrorlord’’ or ‘‘year lord’’). The Morning Star aspect ofXiuhtecuhtli wears axiuhuitzollicrown with thexiuhtototlbird and a medallion that resembles theheadpiece of Quetzalcoatl on Dresden Codex page 4a(Taube 1992b : 125). Xiuhtecuhtli is primarily a cen-tral Mexican deity, but a Postclassic mural fromTulum shows he was also known in the Maya area(Taube 1992b : 125, fig. 67d). On page 49, Xiuhte-cuhtli shoots the turtle at a time of year coincidingwith the beginning of the dry season, for the heliacalrise date corresponds to 11/6 /1225 O.S. (11/13/1225N.S.). Over the next eighty days, as the Morning Starascended, the rains abruptly ceased. Spearing theturtle victim, a patron of rain, proclaims drought,according to Thompson (1972 : 69). The associationwith the onset of the dry season also provides a linkwith the central Mexican Fire God, who is promi-nent in dry-season festivals taking place after themaize harvest (Nicholson 1971, table 4).Thompson (1960 : 220) proposes that the blind-fold worn by the Morning Star god on page 50 of theDresden Codex refers to the planet moving back-ward ‘‘blindly’’ in retrograde motion (Fig. 5.3e). In-deed, the heliacal rise of Venus always coincides withretrograde motion. The god on page 50 most closelyresembles Tezcatlipoca-Itztlacoliuhqui-Ixquimilli, acentral Mexican god who wears a blindfold over hiseyes and twin plumes in his headdress on CodexVaticanus B 39 and on Codex Feje ́ rva ́ ry-Mayer 33(Fig. 5.6a; Taube 1992b : 110 –112; Thompson 1972 :69). Itztlacoliuhqui is the central Mexican god offrost associated with the Venus cult (Sprajc 1993a :32 – 33; Sullivan 1976 : 256). In the Codex Feje ́ rva ́ ry-Mayer, he wears a rayed corona on the top of hisheaddress and a smoking mirror on one foot, the in-signia of Tezcatlipoca, as he makes an offering to apossum in the temple of the north. We also find Itz-tlacoliuhqui associated with the temple of the northin the Codex Borgia (50). It seems significant thatin the Dresden Codex Itztlacoliuhqui’s counterpartrepresents the Morning Star rising on 1 Ahau 13 Mac(6 /13/1227 O.S.), positioned close to the sun at itsnorthern extreme at the summer solstice. Nonethe-less, in the Aztec festival calendar, Itztlacoliuhquiplayed a prominent role as god of frost in the Septem-ber festival of Ochpaniztli (9/2 – 9/21 O.S.), which174VENUS AND MERCURY: THE BODY DOUBLES"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"glyph). The same names appear on lines 17, 21, and22 on pages 46 –50 in Thompson’s (1972 : 66) table,which assigns letters of the alphabet to list the namesof the gods (these bear no connection with the Post-classic gods identified by letters of the alphabet). Thesequence invariably links the regents with the easterndirection (Fig. 5.3f – j; Kelley 1976, fig. 28). One enig-matic aspect in the sequence of names is that eachregent’s name actually appears in the middle sectionof the previous page. Thus the Moon Goddess regenton page 49 is named on page 48 in the column as-sociated with the heliacal rise of the Morning Star.The analysis presented links the regents with theevents represented on the page they are pictured on,but it is possible that they represent astronomicalevents 584 days earlier.Only the Moon Goddess on page 49 has been se-curely identified, so our analysis should begin withher. She is named in the column associated with theheliacal rise date 4 /1/1224 (page 48). On this date,the waxing Moon was located in Leo. On the otherhand, if we look at the regent on page 49 as a repre-sentation of the Moon on the heliacal rise date re-corded on the same page (11/6 /1225), we find thewaxing Moon above the western sky at dusk in Cap-ricorn on the edge of the Milky Way. In my opinion,the most important feature locating the Moon God-dess in the sky is her sky-band throne. As we will seein Chapter 7, the layout of the Paris Codex zodiacreveals that all the constellations attached to the skyband are located where the ecliptic crosses the MilkyWay or at locations framing the crossing point (Cap-ricorn and Libra). Based on this pattern, I have as-signed the regent Moon Goddess to the heliacal riseon page 49, rather than 584 days earlier. It wouldseem that the other regents on sky-band thrones inthe Venus pages may also correspond to astronomi-cal gods located on or at the edge of the Milky Way.The regent on page 46 might be associated insome way with Mars because he wears a headdressvery much like the Mars Beast (Dresden 45b). Pre-suming the image relates to the Morning Star risingon the 5 Kan 7 Xul date recorded on page 46 (1/19/1221), we find a good correspondence because Marsand Venus were rising together in the dawn sky,echoing the conjunction event on 1 Ahau 18 Kayabina.d.934 considered so important by Lounsbury(1983). The Mars regent’s sky-band throne may rep-resent the Milky Way. On the heliacal rise date asso-ciated with page 46, Mars was in Capricorn at theedge of the Milky Way.The skeletal regent on page 47 cannot be iden-tified in terms of an astronomical counterpart(Fig. 5.3b). Harvey and Victoria Bricker (1992) havelinked a skeletal figure in the Paris Codex with Pi-sces, but the regent of the Venus pages seems to bedifferent. His closest counterpart is seen on DresdenCodex 12b, where God A wears a similar animalheaddress.In a departure from the pattern seen for other re-gents, the regent on page 48 is seated on a rooftop,clearly representing a different location than the sky-band throne (Fig. 5.3c). Here a Pauahtun, designatedas God N by Schellhas, is seated on a roof decoratedwith death eyes, which may signal he is close to thehorizon or in the underworld. He has a quadripartitenature in other contexts, best seen in his four guisesat Chiche ́ n Itza ́ (Schele and Mathews 1998, fig. 6.11;Tozzer 1957, figs. 261– 264, 266). As noted in Chap-ter 4, God N may be linked in some fashion with thefour phases of the Moon or the four synodic aspectsof the inferior planets (Venus and Mercury). The factthat he appears on the same page with the MorningStar suggests that he must be an entity other thanVenus. His identity, however, remains enigmatic.Page 50 shows two regents associated with the Ve-nus cycle ending 1 Ahau 13 Mac at the time of helia-cal rise on 6 /13/1227, just before the summer sol-stice. The Maize God appears with Hun Ahau, apairing also seen on Dresden Codex 2a (Fig. 4.4h,left). Indeed, Taube (1992b : 116) notes that the twoappearing together is consistent with Classic Mayaimagery of the Popol Vuh, for the Maize God is theClassic period version of Hun Hunahpu, the fatherof Hunahpu and Xbalanque. Hun Ahau, the Classicperiod counterpart of Hunahpu, is related to boththe Sun and its clarion, the Morning Star (Chapter3; B. Tedlock 1992a : 28; D. Tedlock 1991 : 160, 342).The sky-band throne is appropriate because both theSun and Venus were crossing the Milky Way on thedate of heliacal rise (the Sun in Gemini, Venus inOrion).

Thompson (1972 : 69) identifiesT608 as a fish tail, leading him to conclude that thisgod is associated with fishing (Figs. 5.3e, 5.7b, lowerleft). Even though T608 is now more commonly in-terpreted as a penis (Kurbjuhn 1989), it is interest-ing to note that the victim may be linked with Sagit-tarius, which correlates with a fish-snake in the ParisCodex zodiac (H. Bricker and V. Bricker 1992, table6.5). On 6 /13/1227, when Venus rose at dawn, Sag-ittarius was in opposition to the Morning Star, per-haps symbolized by the victim positioned in oppo-sition to the rising Morning Star on page 50.Although the victims on pages 49 and 50 may rep-resent constellations, other victims may be planets.The God K victim on page 46 seems to represent Ju-piter, which was in opposition to the rising MorningStar and undergoing retrograde motion on 1/19/1221 (Fig. 5.3a). This identification is in accord withmy previous research on Classic period images ofGod K associated with dates when Jupiter was in ret-rograde motion (Milbrath 1996b; Chapter 6).The victim on page 47 represents the Moon set-ting opposite the rising Morning Star (Fig. 5.3b).The Moon sometimes takes the form of a jaguar, es-pecially around the full Moon (Chapter 4). At thetime Venus rose heliacally on 8/26 /1222, the Moonwas three days past full (8/23/1222; Goldstine 1973).The seasonal aspect of the Moon on page 47 may beimportant. The red feline bears a water-lily head-dress and the same name as the Water-lily Jaguar onDresden 8a (Chac Bolay; Thompson 1972 : 35, 68,70). Study of Classic period inscriptions indicatesthat the Water-lily jaguar may be a rainy-season as-pect of the Moon (Chapter 4). Representation of theMoon in the Venus Almanac is not surprising, giventhe fact that lunar cycles are built in to the calendricstructure of the table.Page 48 represents the Maize God as a victim whodies on 4 /1/1224 (Fig. 5.3c). It seems appropriatethat the victim is the Maize God at a time of yearwhen the maize seeds are about to be placed in theearth, a form of burial that may be linked with theannual descent of the Maize God into the under-world. Apparently, a specific seasonal aspect of themaize crop sprouting in the rain-soaked fields of lateJune, for the glyphs on page 50 refer to an abun-dance of maize (Thompson 1972 : 69).The victims of the five Venus gods are named onpage 24 in column C beginning at C8, the victimshown on page 46 (Fig. 5.3a). The list conforms tothe sequence of images appearing on the bottomof pages 46 –50. The second victim is a feline. TheMaize God is the third victim. The turtle is thefourth victim. The fifth victim is identified byThompson as a fishing god. In the middle of eachpage (46 –50), above the pictures of the MorningStar gods, a set of glyphs pairs the victim’s name withthe spearing-event glyph (T653). This glyph pair im-mediately follows glyphs referring to the heliacal riseof the Morning Star. Thus the spearing act is directlyrelated to the rise of the Morning Star. In fact, Venusis the agent of the spearing event.The turtle victim on page 49 is especially interest-ing (Fig. 5.3d). Thompson (1972 : 64, 69 –70) linksthe name (T743[281].227) of the speared victim onpage 49 to T227 in the list on page 24 at C11, point-ing out that the seated manikin in a ‘‘siesta’’ pose isa dwarf (ac), a homonym for the turtle, which is alsocalledac,a relationship reinforced by the turtle-headprefix joined with T227 on page 49. Although Closs(1989 :406, 411, fig. 31.3) identifies T227 as part ofthe name for Venus as lord of the underworld, itclearly names the victim in the Dresden Codex. Thevictim on page 49 seems to be a turtle constellation.Analysis of the Paris Codex ‘‘zodiac’’ on pages23 – 24 indicates that there is a turtle constellation inthe region of Orion (H. Bricker and V. Bricker 1992;Love 1994). Although Thompson (1972 : 67) sug-gested that the speared victims are constellations inconjunction with the rising Morning Star, the turtleconstellation was actually at the opposite side of thesky when Venus rose at dawn on 11/6 /1225. Thus thespearing event refers to opposition in the sky ratherthan conjunction. In the seasonal cycle of Venus, therise of the Fire God aspect of the Morning Star ush-ered in the dry season when the turtle constellationdied at dawn. The turtle constellation had to die anddescend to the underworld in the west so that thedry-season Morning Star could rise in the east.The last victim in the Venus pages is named with176VENUS AND MERCURY: THE BODY DOUBLES"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Morning Star is responsible for the death of maize,just as certain seasonal positions of the Evening Starwere believed to promote maize fertility (Closs et al.1984; Sprajc 1993a, 1993b). A link between Venuspositions and maize agriculture survived into theeighteenth century, as documented in a Quiche ́ co-dex that describes Venus observations in relation tothe agricultural cycle (Tedlock 1994).In sum, several of the victims in the Dresden Co-dex Venus pages seem to represent constellations,the Moon, and planets positioned in opposition tothe Morning Star. As Venus rose, it hurled its atlatldart across the sky, killing the astronomical deity atthe opposite side of the sky. The regents enthronedon the top of the page may show astronomical bod-ies positioned at the intersection of the Milky Wayand the ecliptic, represented as a sky-band throne.The regents include the Maize God and his co-regentHunahpu, the Moon Goddess, and a regent possiblyconnected with Mars, as well as two others whoseastronomical identities remain enigmatic. Venus re-mains the central character in the drama, but thescenes of the victims and regents indicate an interestin the positions of other astronomical bodies as theMorning Star emerged from inferior conjunction.QUETZALCOATL-KUKULCAN: THEVENUS GOD FROM CENTRAL MEXICOA Venus cult connected with Quetzalcoatl seemsto have been imported from central Mexico to theMaya area at a relatively early time, well before thecomplex of central Mexican Morning Star gods seenin the Dresden Codex. There is evidence of a cult toQuetzalcoatl-Kukulcan in the Classic period archi-tecture of Uxmal, and Jeff Kowalski (1990 : 51–53)says that the feathered-serpent symbolism probablyspread from Chiche ́ n Itza ́ betweena.d.850 and 900.Just when the cult first arrived in Yucata ́ n is debat-able, but the chronicles imply the cult centered ona form of worship linked to a central Mexican rulernamed Quetzalcoatl who died in Yucata ́ n. A six-teenth-century source says that Quetzalcoatl led hispeople from Tollan to Tabasco and then on toCampeche and Yucata ́ n, because he wanted to avoidwarfare (Torquemada 1943, 1 : 255 – 256). In a sev-enteenth-century chronicle, Cogolludo (1954 : 352)identifies Kukulcan of Yucata ́ n as the same indi-vidual called Quetzalcoatl in Cholula. According toLanda, the Itza ́ settlers at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ were ruled byKukulcan, who came from central Mexico, wherehe was worshiped as the god Quetzalcoatl (Tozzer1941 : 20 – 23 n. 128). In the year 1 Reed, Quetzalcoatldied and was transformed into the Morning Star inthe ‘‘land of writing,’’ alluding to the Maya area,according to one central Mexican source (Anales deCuauhtitla ́n;Seler 1960 –1961, 2 : 740). The whitecircle in the sky mentioned in the Chilam Balamof Chumayel is a reference to the planet Venus,which is connected with the return of Quetzalcoatl-Kukulcan in the Katun 11 Ahau (Thompson 1960 :219). Quetzalcoatl-Kukulcan is apparently a Toltecruler who was apotheosized as Venus. His historycan also be seen in Mixteca-Puebla codices, where heis similarly identified with Venus (Milbrath 1988a).QUETZALCOATL-KUKULCAN177A number of early chronicles link round struc-tures to a cult connected with Quetzalcoatl-Kukulcan(Tozzer 1941 : 25 n. 134). Landa describes a roundstructure at Mayapa ́ n, a city reportedly founded byKukulcan after he left Chiche ́ n Itza ́ (Tozzer 1941 :23 – 25). As noted earlier, the most famous roundstructure, the Caracol at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ , has windowswith oblique angles oriented toward the northernand southern horizon extremes of Venus. The stair-way to the main platform also has a stylobate nichewith one wall aligned to the setting Sun, but the cen-ter point from the rear wall faces the northernmostsetting point of Venus (Fig. 3.1b). The back of theniche has a pair of columns; one was painted red, theother black. The red and black coloration providesan intriguing link with the cult of Quetzalcoatl, forthe Aztecs said that Quetzalcoatl died in the ‘‘landof writing’’ (tlilan tlapallan), meaning literally ‘‘theland of red and black,’’ the colors used in Maya writ-ing (Seler 1960 –1961, 2 : 740).Round structures are also connected with Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl in Guatemala and in central Mexico.Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl, the central Mexican Wind Godcharacterized by a beaklike mask, appears in the Clas-sic Maya area as early as the 10th Baktun on SeibalStela 19 (Schlak 1996, fig. 3). Seibal has a roundtemple dedicated to this deity. It faces west, as do the"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Taube (1992b : 60, 137) concurs and adds that thefigure wears a turquoise headdress disk like that seenon Postclassic images of Quetzalcoatl from centralMexico. This god leads off a series of twenty deitiesin Almanac 8 of the Dresden Codex (4a –10a) asso-ciated with Tzolkin dates that define a period of 5352 days (Hofling 1988). Seler (1960 –1961, 1 : 700,figs. 28 – 29; 1990 –1996, 1 : 215 – 216) also recognizesimages of Quetzalcoatl-Kukulcan planting maizeseeds in the Madrid Codex (26b, 35a). Fertility andplant growth are probably part of God H’s domain,for he shares traits with Goddess I and the MaizeGod. God H is also linked with God D in the codices,as in scenes on Dresden Codex 12c and 15c, whereGod D appears with God H’s flower title (Stone1995a; Taube 1992b : 63).Taube (1992b : 63) links God H with the Water-lilySerpent and with the head variant of the numberthree, believed to be a wind god because of an asso-ciation with the Ik glyph. In the Dresden Codex (50),Ik is a day sign associated with the emergence of theEvening Star (Fig. 5.3e). The Ik symbol at Palenqueis interpreted as a reference to the Evening Star(Lounsbury 1974 : 11; Robertson 1985b, fig. 243).Zoomorphs (serpent faces?) from Palenque markedwith Ik symbols may be representations of the Eve-ning Star (Fig. 5.7m – n). In the Codex Borgia (9),Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl is the patron of the day Wind,the counterpart of Ik. This suggests that God H, theround temples dedicated to Quetzalcoatl-Kukulcanin Yucata ́ n. Sprajc (1993a : 5) points out that thisorientation suggests a link with the Evening Star,whereas the central Mexican round temples face easttoward the Morning Star. Such a temple is found atCalixtlahuaca, a round temple built in four stages,with the oldest level dating back to Teotihuaca ́ntimes, which housed a magnificent sculpture ofEhecatl-Quetzalcoatl (Marquina 1964, pl. 91). Per-haps such round structures were symbolically linkedto Quetzalcoatl-Kukulcan as a coiled serpent.Stephen Houston and David Stuart (1984 : 799 –800) identify a coiled serpent on Dresden Codex 36bas Kukulcan (Fig. 5.4c). Although the serpent is notfeathered, it bears a five-pointed star, a design thathas clear connections with Venus, as we will see inthe discussion to follow. The associated sky glyphsuggests a link with a ‘‘quetzal-sky’’ compoundfound on a Uaxactu ́ n vessel identified by Houstonand Stuart (1984 : 799 – 800, figs. 17, 18a) as the onlyknown hieroglyphic reference to Kukulcan duringthe Classic period.The anthropomorphic God H seems to be thecounterpart of Quetzalcoatl-Kukulcan in the codi-ces. Seler (1960 –1961, 1 : 698 –702; 1990 –1996, 1 :214) noted long ago that a figure that Schellhas iden-tifies as God H on Dresden Codex 4a is probablyQuetzalcoatl-Kukulcan with a snail-shell necklace, aquetzal on his back, and a snake in hand (Fig. 5.4a).178VENUS AND MERCURY: THE BODY DOUBLESFIG. 5.4.a:Quetzalcoatl-Kukulcan with snail-shell neck-lace, quetzal on his back, and snake in hand (Dresden Co-dex 4a; after Taube 1992b, fig. 27a).b:Venus God Quetzalcoatl with conical hat, long beak,and beard (Aztec Codex Telleriano-Remensis 9; afterTaube 1992b, fig. 27b).c:Vulture attacks coiled serpent representing Venus asKukulcan (Dresden Codex 36b; after Villacorta and Villa-corta 1977).d:Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl, holding implements of priest,watches as skeletal Morning Star descends into under-world carrying implements of war; possibly representsEvening Star rising when Morning Star was no longer vis-ible, hence its skeletal or underworld aspect (Codex Bor-gia 19; after Seler 1960 –1961, 3 : 256, fig. 48).e:Twin Venus serpents, holding twin Ehecatl-Quetzal-coatl figures in their jaws, form center of radiant disk rep-resenting planet Venus with red and black rays and stareyes (Codex Borgia 30; after Seler 1963, 2).f:Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl descends on celestial cordthrough fleshy opening in sky band decorated with Venusglyphs, showing Venus passing through Milky Way onecliptical cord (Codex Vindobonensis 48; after Gonza ́ lezTorres 1975, fig. 5).g:Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl lifts up sky band with watermotifs and five Venus glyphs, one of sixteen differenttransformations of Venus in creation epic of this Mixteca-Puebla codex (Codex Vindobonensis 47b; after Baird1989, fig. 33).h:Half-star Venus symbol on Classic feathered rattler(Maltrata, Veracruz; after Baird 1989, fig. 39)."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"them. As Xolotl dances, the skeletal Morning Star,pierced by a dart, descends into the jaws of the earthmonster. Perhaps this scene and the one in the Co-dex Borgia tell us that the Morning Star must de-scend to the underworld when the Evening Star rises.This is the reverse of the transformation representedin the chronicles, where the priest-ruler Quetzalcoatldies when the warlike Morning Star rises as Tlahuiz-calpantecuhtli (Lord of Dawn), reflecting a transfor-mation from one phase to another.Throughout the Codex Borgia, there are many Ve-nus transformations representing Quetzalcoatl andTlahuizcalpantecuhtli (Milbrath 1989). In my opin-ion, pages 29 – 46 represent the motions of Venus ina pattern substantially different from that originallyproposed by Seler (1963, 2 : 9 – 61). My research in-dicates that this eighteen-page sequence correlateswith the eighteen months of the festival calendar,with each page representing a different 20-day pe-riod; the Venus cycle is integrated into this calendricsequence (Milbrath 1989, fig. 1).The first page (29) refers to days 20 – 40 of theMorning Star phase, when Venus is clearly visiblerising above the horizon. The wriggling figures ofEhecatl-Quetzalcoatl emerging from the ashes of aburning bundle apparently symbolize the transfor-mation of Venus as it becomes the Morning Star,recalling an account in the chronicles saying thatQuetzalcoatl was burned when he was transformedinto the Morning Star.Page 30 represents days 40 – 60 of the MorningStar phase, when Venus reaches its maximum bril-liance as it rapidly ascends in the dawn sky. Therayed disk on page 30, often referred to as the ‘‘nightsun,’’ is actually the resplendent planet Venus (Fig.5.4e; Milbrath 1989). The rayed disk frames inter-twined star serpents representing Ehecatl figures inthe jaws of the twin Ehecatl serpents, evoking thedual nature of the planet Venus. The Venus disk is a360-degree version of Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl’s head-dress, characterized by a fan of red rays with squaredends on a nocturnal corona of black inlaid with stars(Fig. 5.4d). The red rays alternating with black raysrepresent the crepuscular light of Venus. In subse-quent scenes (pages 39 – 40), Venus enters the un-derworld, disappearing into the jaws of the earthWater-lily Serpent, and Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl are allrelated by an association with Venus and the wind.The evidence for associating Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatlwith a specific Venus phase, however, remainsdebatable.At the dawn of the fifth world age, Quetzalcoatland Ehecatl faced to the east to await the sunrise,which would suggest a Morning Star association (Sa-hagu ́ n 1950 –1982, 4 : 7, 52). Some texts, however,refer to Quetzalcoatl as He ́ spero, a name for the Eve-ning Star (Sprajc 1993a : 28 – 29). Aztec legends haveQuetzalcoatl traveling to the east, where he is trans-formed into the Morning Star, at which point he be-comes Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli. This suggests perhapsthat Quetzalcoatl is a god of the Evening Star whochanged identity when he became the Morning Star.The most comprehensive inventory of PostclassicVenus imagery is found in the Codex Borgia, be-lieved to be from the area of Tlaxcala or Puebla(home to Cholula’s cult to Quetzalcoatl). Here wesee a great variety of images of Quetzalcoatl. Some-times he takes the form of Ehecatl, with a long-beaked wind god mask, or he can be a starry Venusserpent wearing the same mask (Fig. 5.4e). SomeCodex Borgia images depict Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl asan anthropomorphic being with a conical hat, a longbeak, a shell necklace, and a beard (Fig. 5.4d). Simi-lar images of Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl are represented inMixtec and Aztec codices (Fig. 5.4b, f, g).Codex Borgia 19 may represent contrasting im-ages of Venus as a warrior and a priest (Fig. 5.4d).Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl watches as the skeletal ‘‘lord ofdawn’’ (Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli) descends into the un-derworld. The imagery suggests that one aspect ofVenus is replaced by another. Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatlholds the bloodletting implements of a priest, whilethe dying Morning Star holds an atlatl and a shield,perhaps indicating a contrast between the MorningStar as a warrior and the Evening Star as a priest.A similar scene in the Codex Borbonicus depictsthe Evening Star, Xolotl, watching the Sun carry themummy bundle of the skeletal Morning Star into theunderworld (Fig. 5.1h). Both Venus figures wear verysimilar headdresses with a star center and stackedknots that may be related to Venus.

A similar concept may be found as far backas the Preclassic period, for Izapa Stela 11 depicts abearded god (Venus?) surrounded by rays positionedin the jaws of the earth monster (Norman 1976,fig. 3.11).At Chiche ́ n Itza ́ , the cult of the feathered serpentis associated with images of warriors armed withweapons in the Terminal Classic and Early Postclas-sic periods, spanning the period froma.d.800 to1250 (Fig. 5.5c, e). In light of Quetzalcoatl’s directlink with Chiche ́ n Itza ́ in the chronicles, it is not sur-prising that his images are very common at the site(Taube 1992b : 136). Taube suggests that feathered-serpent images refer to the Morning Star aspect ofVenus, because Quetzalcoatl was transformed intothe Morning Star in the chronicles.Venus glyphs in a non-Maya style appear with im-ages of the feathered serpent in a variety of contexts.A bench in the Mercado depicting a scene of captivesand sacrifice has two feathered serpents on theta-blero,with Venus glyphs grouped in sets of five alongthe sides of each serpent, suggesting a link with thefive Venus cycles in the eight-year Venus Almanac(Fig. 5.5d). Here the Venus glyphs have five rays, aform that also probably symbolizes the five Venuscycles (Carlson 1991). In the Northwest Colonnade,a warrior wearing a Venus symbol as a star belt hasthe feathered serpent as his alter ego (Fig. 5.5c). Ajadeite plaque from the Cenote shows a serpent car-rying a warrior with a star belt and an armed dartthrower, an image that may represent the warlike Ve-nus as it rises as the Morning Star (Tozzer 1957,fig. 131). Although this serpent does not have feath-ers on its body, it does have a design of concentriccircles that may represent stars (Chapter 7).An unusual image on the Venus Platform shows aface in the jaws of a feathered reptile, representedfrontally with clawed feet. Seler (1990 –1996, 1 : 211,fig. 14) identifies the reptile as Quetzalcoatl, notingthat it appears alongside Venus glyphs on a panel re-lated to the Venus cycle (Fig. 5.5a). Such an imagerecalls the Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl serpents with clawedfront feet that represent aspects of Venus in the Co-dex Borgia (Fig. 5.4e). The Chiche ́ n Itza ́ image alsoevokes comparison with the front head of the Cos-mic Monster, which sometimes has clawed front feetand a deity face in its jaws (Fig. 7.5e).The Upper Temple of the Jaguars, dated betweena.d.800 and 900, has a lintel that depicts a warriorframed by a sun disk and another cradled by a feath-ered serpent, with a water-lily monster and a Mayastar glyph between the two warriors (Fig. 5.5e). Inthe temple interior, a reclining goddess emits twofeathered serpents from her abdomen, alluding tothe twin nature of Venus; a similar image is pre-served in the North Temple of the Great Ball Court(Fig. 5.5f – g). Her body may represent the MilkyWay (Chapter 7; compare Fig. 7.4a).The feathered serpent warrior is seen repeatedly inmurals of the Upper Temple of the Jaguars. The cen-tral mural scene opposite the doorway depicts twoastronomical warriors (Fig. 5.5h). The solar warrioron the left, representing a local Maya ruler, wearsMaya-style costume elements, including a jade nosebar and a jade mask on the front of his headdress,whereas the serpent warrior seems to be a foreignerwearing a gold pectoral (Coggins 1984 : 160 –163,fig. 17). The serpent warrior emanates darts and rays,a non-Maya image suggesting the fiery rays of theMorning Star that may involve a Na ́ huatl play onwords that links darts and rays of light (Taube 1994 :223, fig. 11c). Arthur Miller (1977) identifies thefeathered-serpent figure as Captain Serpent, a for-eigner leading his troops against Captain Sun Disk,a Maya leader. On the other hand, Charles Lincoln(1988) says the two warriors are Kakupacal (fireshield) and Kukulcan (sprouting serpent), acting asdual rulers of Chiche ́ n Itza ́ . They are linked with twolineages or cults honoring the Sun and Venus (Mil-brath 1988c : 65 – 66). The feathered serpent warriormay be the historical Kukulcan-Quetzalcoatl whobrought the Venus cult from central Mexico.The feathered serpent appears with an astronomi-cal warrior in a number of battle scenes in the UpperTemple of the Jaguars (Coggins 1984, figs. 17 – 20).Often the solar warrior is also represented, but themural scenes do not show the two in close proximity.A landscape on the east wall depicts warfare takingplace in the red hills of the Puuc area; in the scene aVenus god is emerging from the jaws of a serpent(Coggins 1984 : 159; Wren 1991 : 55).

Once again thesolar warrior appears with a star warrior, but thistime the serpent seems to be colored yellow.Clemency Coggins (1984 : 157 –165) relates the se-quence of murals to a single synodic period of Venusbeginning with heliacal rise on the east wall. She sug-gests that Venus appears in superior conjunction onthe north wall and in inferior conjunction on thesouth wall, with the four walls giving a quadripartitedivision of the 584-day Venus cycle. Nonetheless, theformat of the mural sequence is better suited to acycle showing Venus in its different aspects over thecourse of eight solar years. There is actually an eight-part division of the mural sequence, suggesting anassociation with the Venus Almanac, with one scenefor each solar year. If the campaign of battles shownin the murals took place over the course of eightyears, then each scene may show a different Venusposition in the eight-year Venus Almanac. The Mayaof Chiche ́ n Itza ́ clearly had knowledge of this cycle,for five Venus cycles is equated to eight solar years inthe inscriptions of the Venus Platform (Fig. 5.5a).Some aspects of Quetzalcoatl and his featheredserpent alter ego are closely linked with originmyths. Quetzalcoatl took part in the original eventsof creation pictured in the Mixteca-Puebla CodexVindobonensis. On page 48 of that codex, Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl descends on a celestial cord through afleshy opening in a sky band decorated with Venusglyphs in a scene that refers to his rebirth with divineattributes (Fig. 5.4f; Milbrath 1988a). Here Quetzal-coatl descends slowly along a cord, perhaps imitat-ing the slow descent of the Morning Star phase. OnCodex Vindobonensis 47b, he lifts up a sky bandwith water motifs and half-star glyphs representingVenus, a scene that is part of a creation epic involv-ing sixteen different transformations of the deity(Fig. 5.4g; Furst 1978 :102 –108).Coggins (1988b : 76 –77, fig. 8) suggests that Quet-FIG. 5.5.a:Venus Platform at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ depicts pre-dominantly central Mexican images (year bundle, yearsign, half star, fleshy opening, and number eight) pairedwith Maya number five as symbol of Venus Almanacequating ninety-nine lunar months and five Venus cycleswith eight solar years (after Seler 1960 –1961, 5, fig. 243).b:Star warrior with Venus belt combining rays andlobes like Mixteca-Puebla Venus glyphs (Terminal Classicmural on southeast wall in Upper Temple of Jaguars,Chiche ́ n Itza ́ ; after Miller 1989 : 294).c:Venus warrior wearing star belt has feathered serpentas his alter ego (Northwest Colonnade at Chiche ́ n Itza ́;after Tozzer 1957, fig. 595).d:Venus glyphs grouped in sets of five along sides oftwo feathered serpents evoke five Venus cycles in VenusAlmanac of eight years (Mercado bench at Chiche ́ n Itza ́;after Tozzer 1957, fig. 598).e:Solar warrior (Kakupacal) framed by sun disk andVenus warrior (Quetzalcoatl-Kukulcan) cradled in feath-ered serpent (Terminal Classic lintel in Upper Templeof Jaguars, Chiche ́ n Itza ́ ; after Maudslay 1889 –1902, 3,pl. 35).f:Two feathered serpents, alluding to dual nature ofVenus, pass through abdomen of reclining sky goddess(Milky Way?), evoking links with Mixteca-Puebla imagesthat depict Quetzalcoatl emerging from Milky Way (Up-per Temple of Jaguars, Chiche ́ n Itza ́ ; after Seler 1960 –1961, 5 : 355, fig. 227).g:On North Temple of Great Ball Court at Chiche ́nItza ́ , two Bacabs flank twin Venus serpents emerging fromabdomen of reclining sky goddess, whose body may rep-resent Milky Way (after Seler 1960 –1961, 5 : 321, figs.195 –196).h:Solar warrior (Kakupacal) wearing Maya headdressfaces Venus warrior surrounded by feathered serpent (de-tail from murals of Upper Temple of Jaguars, Chiche ́nItza ́ ; after Schele and Matthews 1998, fig. 6.30.B7A).i:Cornice of Upper Temple of Jaguars depicts shieldswith crescent moons flanked by felines and feathered ser-pents; entry to temple guarded by two giant feathered rat-tlesnakes (Great Ball Court complex at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ ; afterTozzer 1957, fig. 85).QUETZALCOATL-KUKULCAN183"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"pent known as Xiuhcoatl among the Aztecs, favoringan identification proposed by Caso and Bernal in the1950s.

Taube (1992a : 54 –55, 59 – 60, fig. 5) identifiesthe reptile as a headdress representing the War Ser-pent, a Classic period counterpart of Xiuhcoatl, theserpent of the Fire God. In terms of cosmic symbol-ism, it is noteworthy that Codex Rı ́os (folios 6r, 6v),an Aztec codex showing the world destructions, de-picts the fire serpent and the feathered serpent asrepresentatives of two sequential world ages.

In a like fashion, representationsof the feathered rattler at Teotihuaca ́ n float in sea-water on the Temple of Quetzalcoatl (Fig. 5.6g). Thecorona of luminescent quetzal feathers around theserpent’s face may symbolize the shining rays of Ve-nus. The placement of the temple complex may in-corporate units of measure that allude to the Venuscycle (Sugiyama 1993 : 114). The deity images wereintentionally destroyed, apparently as part of a reli-gious or political conflict (Sugiyama 1989 : 104).This form of representation predates the quetzal-rattlesnake images associated with blood sacrifice inTeotihuaca ́ n Zone 5-A murals, suggesting that theVenus cult changed over time (Fig. 5.6d). PerhapsQuetzalcoatl’s role as a creator god was subordinatedto a Venus cult connected with warfare and sacrificein the later periods of Teotihuaca ́n.Quetzalcoatl is paired with a jawless reptile headbearing reflective mica mirrors in its eyes and twinrings on its brow on the Temple of Quetzalcoatl(Fig. 5.6g). Coggins (1996 : 24) interprets the twinrings as a reference to the morning and eveningphases of Venus.

Baird notes that thehalf star at Teotihuaca ́ n has its counterpart in theMaya star glyph, and although they are different inform, they have a similar meaning.The platform at Tikal shows central Mexican –style Venus glyphs with five radiating elements likethe five-pointed half stars at Cacaxtla and Teotihua-ca ́ n (Fig. 5.6d – f; Carlson 1993, figs. 8.1a, 8.9a; Miller1973, figs. 137, 156, 197; Sugiyama 1993, fig. 6). TheClassic period Teotihuaca ́ n half stars in turn re-semble a cross-sectioned conch with five points in awater band at Cacaxtla (Carlson 1993, fig. 8.11). Theconch-star connection is certainly intentional, as canbe seen in the five-pointed conch pectoral, worn ex-clusively by Venus gods such as Quetzalcoatl andXolotl in the Mixteca-Puebla codices of the Post-classic period (Figs. 5.1h, 5.4d).The star belt is worn by warriors at both Tula andChiche ́ n Itza ́ (Fig. 5.5b; Miller 1989, fig. 20.28). AtChiche ́ n Itza ́ , the star belt combines rays and a lobeddesign that evokes the combination of elements seenin Mixteca-Puebla Venus glyphs that represent star-tipped wings of a bee or wasp (Figs. 5.1e, g, 5.4f – g).A star belt with five lobes appears on a Venus de-ity with a scorpion tail at Cacaxtla (Carlson 1993,fig. 8.6b). In the center there is a horseshoe-shapeddesign framing a star eye, similar to the Venus sym-bol worn by Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli in the Codex Va-ticanus B (Fig. 5.6c). The horseshoe frame around astar may represent Venus glyphs at Maya sites over awide geographical area (Fig. 5.8k– l).The Venus Platform at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ combines cen-tral Mexican and Maya Venus imagery (Fig. 5.5a). AMexican-style Venus glyph is tied to a bar symboliz-ing the number five in Maya glyphic writing. TheVenus glyph is framed by a fleshy opening resem-bling the clefts through which Quetzalcoatl passes inMixteca-Puebla imagery (Milbrath 1988a). Along-side there is a year sign, a year bundle, and eight dotsrepresenting eight years, all rendered in the centralMexican style. The equation is eight years equalingfive Venus cycles, if we take into account the Maya-style number five. Carlson (1993 :209) says that theyear sign embodies the eight-year Venus Almanac.for the twin circles above the eyes of the Teotihua-ca ́ n second reptile. The alternating symbols indicatesome form of duality that seems related to Venus.We can conclude that Quetzalcoatl represents theplanet Venus, and his imagery does not seem tobe confined to a single phase in the Venus cycle. Thechronicles and codices provide clear evidence of theconnection between Quetzalcoatl-Kukulcan and Ve-nus. The confirmation of his migration legend inchronicles from two different culture areas suggestshistorical events somehow related to Venus events.In the Maya codices of the Postclassic period, Quet-zalcoatl-Kukulcan is represented by the anthropo-morphic God H, possibly associated with agricul-ture. He also is represented as a starry serpent in thecodices. At Chiche ́ n Itza ́ , the feathered serpent is as-sociated with Venus glyphs, sometimes representedin groups of five. Venus glyphs also appear on abuilding with an eight-part mural sequence linked tothe eight-year Venus Almanac. Warfare is predomi-nant in this Terminal Classic mural. In late Teotihua-ca ́ n times, this cult of Venus warfare may have sup-planted a cult devoted to Venus as a creator god.CENTRAL MEXICAN VENUS SYMBOLSIN THE MAYA AREAJohn Carlson (1991, 1993) suggests that the half-starsymbol is part of a cult of Venus-regulated warfareimported from Teotihuaca ́ n to the Maya area. TheTeotihuaca ́ n half-star symbol of the Classic periodusually has five points, indicating a link with the fiveVenus cycles in the eight-year Venus Almanac (Fig.5.6d – e; Carlson 1991, 1993). The half-star symbol isoften associated with images of death, war, and sac-rifice in the later phases of Teotihuaca ́ n, after arounda.d.550, according to Ellen Baird (1989 : 118 –119).Late Teotihuaca ́ n murals from Zone 5-A depict halfstars on a path traveled by priests wearing owl cos-tumes; they carry knives with bloody hearts that in-dicate human sacrifice (Fig. 5.6d). In the surround-ing frame, Quetzalcoatl appears as a rattlesnake withquetzal heads, half stars, and footprints along itsbody. The half-star symbol is also associated with186VENUS AND MERCURY: THE BODY DOUBLES"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"On the other hand, Seler (1960 –1961, 5 : 366, 375;1990 –1996, 1 : 211) proposes that a ceremony likethe Aztec New Fire Ceremony is represented by theyear bundle, signifying a bundle of 52 reeds (onefor each year in the Calendar Round), which is tobe multiplied by eight to yield 260 Venus Rounds.Clemency Coggins and David Drucker (1988 : 23)suggest that the Venus Platform commemorates aspecific calendar ceremony aligning the Maya andcentral Mexican calendars, referring to both the NewFire Ceremony and the end of the ninth Maya Bak-tun falling on the day 7 Ahau (3/9/830), a date thatwas followed by the end of the 52-year CalendarRound at the heliacal rise of Venus on the day 1 Ahauon the winter solstice.Another central Mexican – style Venus symbol,quincunx face painting, appears in the Codex Borgiaand the Codex Vaticanus B (Fig. 5.6b – c). All fivevariants of Tlauhuizcalpantecuhtli representing thenewly risen Morning Star spearing victims can beseen in the Codex Vaticanus B on pages 80 – 84. Tla-huizcalpantecuhtli’s face painting displays five dots(two on the cheeks, and one each on the nose, brow,and chin), a quincunx design that probably refers tothe ‘‘fiveness’’ of Venus in the five Venus cycles of theVenus Almanac. The same face painting is found onheads framed by Venus glyphs at Mitla (Fig. 5.6h;Seler 1960 –1961, 3 : 403). According to Thompson(1960 : 170 –172, fig. 31, nos. 33 – 40), the Mayaquincunx glyph (T585a) may represent a variant ofthe central Mexican Venus sign. It has considerableantiquity, having been found on an Olmec scorpionsculpture (Monument 43) from San Lorenzo datedbefore 900b.c.(Joralemon 1971, fig. 12).In sum, the half-star glyph in the Maya area seemsto be of central Mexican origin, most probably fromTeotihuaca ́ n. The origin point for the star belt ismore difficult to determine, but one of its earliestmanifestations is at Cacaxtla, where it is a five-partrayed design evoking a connection with the five Ve-nus cycles in the Venus Almanac. A number of theVenus symbols have five rays or five parts, suggest-ing the ‘‘fiveness’’ of Venus. The quincunx design,clearly associated with Venus in some contexts, iswidespread and quite ancient.MAYA GLYPHS AND SYMBOLSREPRESENTING VENUSCentral Mexican influence is evident in some formsof Maya Venus imagery, but the Maya Venus glyphhas distinctive elements derived from Maya sym-bolism. Thompson (1960 : 77, 229) identifies Lamat(T510a), the eighth day in the Maya calendar, asthe sign for the planet Venus (Fig. 5.7c). A similarform without the day-sign cartouche is identifiedas T510b, meaning ‘‘star’’ (*e:k’;Justeson 1984 : 339).In the Dresden Codex Venus pages, T510b is pairedwith the T109 glyph in a glyphic compound mean-ingchac ek(T109.510b), orchak ek’in the revisedorthography, a term for Venus as both the Morningand Evening Star (Fig. 5.7a, bottom row). It has acruciform design surrounded by four doughnut-likecircles, often interpreted as symbols for jade or waterbut here probably connoting the luminescent qual-ity of a star. The fact that there are four circlesin a cross-shaped frame naturally suggests the fourphases of Venus associated with four different direc-tions. However, the same type of symbol can alsorefer to bright stars, as in the turtle constellation ofBonampak Room 2 (Fig. 7.1k).Heinrich Berlin (1977 : 139 –140) notes that anumber of Venus intervals recorded in Palenque’sTemple of the Inscriptions involve Lamat dates. Hepoints out that the west tablet of the Temple of theInscriptions records an interval that counts fromPacal II’s accession on 5 Lamat 1 Mol forward toanother 5 Lamat 1 Mol date, which is separated byan exact Venus interval (80318,980 days) fromthe accession date. A more general study of Lamatdates should be undertaken to see if there is any Ve-nus patterning. Indeed, Thompson (1960 : 299 – 300)notes that prognostications on the day 8 Lamat seemto refer to Venus in the Tizimin manuscript.The Lamat glyph sometimes represents a half starwith a stylized water lily (Imix), resembling a variantof the star glyph known as T510e (Fig. 5.7f; Ringleand Smith-Stark 1996 : 303). The T510e form ap-pears in the eye of the Cosmic Monster in House Eat Palenque, with the water lily serving as an eyelid(Fig. 5.7g).MAYA GLYPHS AND SYMBOLS REPRESENTING VENUS187"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"A truncated star glyph, sometimes referred to asthe half Lamat glyph, has been classified as T510fby William Ringle and Thomas Smith-Stark (1996).Sky bands often incorporate the T510f star glyph or,less commonly, the T510b variant seen in the skyband on page 74 of the Dresden Codex (Fig. 7.4d).Both forms, usually paired with the Chac prefix, areused to refer to Venus in the Dresden Codex Venuspages 46 –50 (Fig. 5.3a – e). On page 47 the T510fglyph also appears in the headdress of Lahun Chan(Fig. 5.1f ), where the two circles are rendered in afashion similar to central Mexican star glyphs, likered-lidded circular eyes.In Classic period Initial Series dates, the T510fstar also serves as the introductory glyph for Yax, amonth that may be connected with Venus, accordingto Thompson (1960 : 111–112). Sometimes a long-snouted ‘‘dragon’’ substitutes instead (Fig. 5.7h). Oneparticularly fine example has a mirror insert in thesnout and the T510f star in its eyes (Fig. 5.7h, lowerright). Coggins (1988c :101) suggests that this Yaxvariant is a Venus serpent, but it also seems toresemble the front head of the Cosmic Monster(Fig. 5.7g).Climbing the stairs of the Tower at Palenque, onecannot help but notice a prominent T510f star glyphpainted over the stair passage leading to the secondfloor (Aveni 1992b, fig. 3.4c). This astronomicalglyph has been interpreted as a giant introductoryglyph for the month Yax, the rest of which is de-stroyed (Robertson 1985b : 77). The glyph does notnecessarily refer to Venus, for similar star glyphs ap-pearing in other architectural contexts at Palenqueseem to refer to other planets (Chapter 6).

Sprajc (1993a) argues thatthe alignment is in the opposite direction (azimuthof 2887228), with the palace serving as the backsightfor observing the northern extreme of Venus settingas the Evening Star, as viewed from the top of theprincipal pyramid at Cehtzuc, located 4.5 km fromUxmal. Aveni (1995 : S79; 1997) now recognizes thatCehtzuc marks the alignment, but he stands by hisoriginal interpretation that the principal alignmentfaces east, noting that the House of the Governorfaces outward from the predominantly north-southaxis of other buildings, and it is skewed by 207inrelation to other buildings.A sky-band throne on the facade of the Governor’sPalace shows constellations, the Sun, the Moon, andVenus in a configuration that may suggest the ap-pearance of the sky in the early tenth century. Harveyand Victoria Bricker’s (1996 : 204, fig. 3) interpreta-tions of the imagery are adapted to fit observationsof both the northerly and southerly extremes of Ve-nus. If the Aveni hypothesis is correct, they maintainthat the sky band shows a zodiac band replicating thesky at the time Venus rose at its southerly extremebefore sunrise ina.d.912 (4 /29/912 O.S.). Theynote that one of the sky-band glyphs (T510f ) mostprobably alludes to Venus. They suggest that the starglyph has an asymmetrical variant of T109 as a su-perfix, denotingchac ek,a name for Venus. Thebuilding facade itself has many Chac masks withT510f star glyphs over the eyes, perhaps forming akind of rebus for Venus aschac ek.On northeastand northwest corners of the fourth platform, thesemasks have the number eight inscribed in the eye-brow, alluding to the eight-year Venus Almanac andpossibly also to the eight-day inferior conjunctionperiod (Aveni 1991: S9, fig. 1; 1992b : 197; Aveni andHartung 1986, fig. 6f; Kowalski 1987, fig. 60; Sprajc1993b : S47).The western facade of the Chenes Temple in thePyramid of the Magician also has a mask with T510fstar glyphs and the number eight, evoking the Ve-The T510f star appears as part of an event glyphin a number of Maya texts and is often interpretedas a reference to Venus (Closs 1977; Lounsbury1982). It appears in a compound known as the ‘‘shellstar,’’ which is associated with warfare (Fig. 5.7o).After studying twenty-five shell-star dates, ArthurSchlak (1996 : 186, table 1) concluded that all refer toa time when Venus was moving slowly relative to theSun, a phenomenon that occurs at specific timesin its synodic period (during superior conjunction,during its descent as the Morning Star, and duringits ascent as Evening Star). I would add that visu-al imagery helps support this interpretation, for theshell seems to be that of a mollusk, a slow-movingcreature. Furthermore, the shell-star image contrastswith the insect image of Venus, discussed at the be-ginning of the chapter, which seems to represent Ve-nus when it is moving rapidly as the descending Eve-ning Star.Among the Maya, the star/ Venus glyph appearsin a number of contexts, most commonly to indicatea Venus alignment, to note a date when a Venusphenomenon occurred, or as part of general star-war imagery (Miller 1988 : 180). Less common, butnonetheless intriguing, are sets of Venus symbolsthat allude to the ‘‘fiveness’’ of Venus, no doubt sym-bolizing the Venus Almanac of five Venus cycles cor-relating with eight solar years.On the north side of the Nunnery at Uxmal, theVenus Temple facade depicts five star glyphs —re-sembling truncated Lamat glyphs (T510f )— thatsymbolize Venus (Pl. 22; Kowalski 1990 : 46, 49 –50).Like other buildings in the Nunnery Quadrangle, theVenus Temple is believed to date to arounda.d.900.Although no specific Venus alignment has beendocumented for the south-facing Venus Temple, thegrouping of five Venus symbols confirms an associa-tion with the ‘‘fiveness’’ of Venus. Other Puuc-stylearchitectural structures at Uxmal show similar glyphsassociated with sets of five Chac masks, as notedbelow.The House of the Governor (Governor’s Palace)at Uxmal is the best-known example of a buildingwith star/ Venus glyphs and an alignment toward aVenus position (Aveni 1980 : 273 – 276; 1991 : 78).

The temple actually faces sunseton April 12 and August 13 (azimuth 2797178). Aveni(1991 : 79 – 80) notes that this orientation may bepart of a count involving the zenith dates at Uxmal,for April 12 is two lunar months before the solar ze-nith on May 22, and adding three Uinals (60 days)brings you to the second solar zenith on July 22. Ob-servations from the temple probably integrated theVenus cycle, the solar year, and the lunar months aspart of the eight-year Venus Almanac.The East Building of the Nunnery, another build-ing at Uxmal with Chac masks bearing star glyphs,also seems to allude to the eight-year Venus Almanac(Aveni 1991 : 78; Lamb 1980). The facade has stackedChac masks flanked by groups of double-headed ser-pents on a background ofX-shaped mosaics. Theaverage number ofX-shaped blocks bounded by thefive sets of double-headed serpent bars is 584, sug-gesting an equation with the synodic period of Venus(Lamb 1980). The serpent bars are grouped witheight bars in each set, symbolizing the eight solaryears that make up the Venus-solar calendar. Oneach group of bars there is a mask that may representan owl (Kowalski 1990 : 48). As we will see, owls ap-pear in imagery linked with Venus, but the owl itselfdoes not seem to be a Venus god.Mary Miller (1988 : 180) suggests that the Venusglyph (T510b) on the Jaguar Stairway at Copa ́ n maysymbolize the Evening Star, because of its positionon the western side of the East Court, although noVenus alignment has been documented to date. Theglyph frames the face of the Jaguar War God, linkedwith both the Moon and Venus (Chapter 4).Venus glyphs decorate a window in Copa ́ n Struc-ture 22 designed to observe Venus during the reignof 18 Rabbit (Aveni 1991 : 318). The west windowwas aligned to observe the northerly extremes of Ve-nus as the Evening Star, which invariably occurredin late April or early May in the eighth and ninthcenturies (Closs et al. 1984 : 234, table 1). Furtherstudy indicates that the Evening Star’s last appear-ance before inferior conjunction was always pre-ceded by quite a long span of visibility through thewindow, which included both the maximum bril-liancy and the stationary point of the planet (Sprajc1987 –1988 : 92 – 94; 1993a : 50 –53). The window alsofunctioned as a viewing aid to locate the Evening Starat its first visibility after superior conjunction ateight-year intervals, when its appearance in the win-dow served as a sign for the burning of the fields inApril.Analysis of glyphs and dates recorded on Copa ́nStructure 11, built in the reign of Yax Pac, suggests ithas a Venus association (Schele and Miller 1986 :122 –123). David Kelley and Ann Kerr (1973 : 185 –186)point out that this structure has one of the few knownClassic period ‘‘great star’’ (chac ek) inscriptions thatclearly refers to Venus, for it is associated with thesame verb seen in the Venus table. The date given(5 Cib 10 Pop) is not a viable calendar date, and it isusually interpreted as 5 Cib 9 Pop (9.15.15.12.16).Linda Schele and Mary Miller (1986 : 123) point outthat the text is partly written in reverse order, andthey translate the text as ‘‘it shined, the great star,’’referring to the first appearance of the Evening Star.Lounsbury (1982 : 154 –155) notes that this dateprobably marks an heir-designation ceremony coin-ciding with the first visibility of Venus as an EveningStar on 2 /11/747. Aveni and Hotaling (1994, table 1)adjust this date to the 584,283 correlation and pointout that the Evening Star actually rose five days ear-lier, but this does not diminish the likelihood thatVenus was important in timing the ceremony.A ‘‘smoking’’ skull on Copa ́ n Stela A, another of18 Rabbit’s monuments (Fig. 3.6c; Pl. 20), may rep-resent Venus at the first visibility of the Evening Star.This stela is inscribed with the dedication date of9.14.19.8.0 12 Ahau 18 Cumku (1/28/731), coincid-ing with a time when Venus reappeared as the Eve-ning Star, according to my analysis. This was also theday of the full Moon. Another interplay betweenthe Moon and Venus is evident on Stela C, anotherstela commissioned by 18 Rabbit.

Indeed, a Venus phe-nomenon occurring on one date will recur threeKatuns later, which may explain the sets of three Ka-tuns recorded at Palenque in the Temple of the In-scriptions (Berlin 1977 : 123).

Here it is paired with a shell motifsignifying the direction south or the underworld. Onthe north wall, the Moon glyph is linked with animage of the Maize god, apparently symbolizing theoverhead direction, or north (Fig. 3.2b; Chapter 3).Victoria Bricker (1988a) interprets the mural sceneas a representation of astronomical events thatplaced the Moon overhead when Venus was at theopposite side of the sky, close to its nadir.An early form of the T510b star appears on the LaMojarra Stela, dated to the Protoclassic period, in as-sociation with calendar dates representing nine Ve-nus cycles of 584 days (Justeson and Kaufman 1993 :1708; Macri and Stark 1993 : 6). The design has acruciform center inscribed in a diamond. Differentvariants show four dots or four rays arranged aroundthe center. The Venus glyph may be traced back toaround 800b.c.at Copa ́ n, where an Olmecoid vesseldepicts a cross pattern with star symbols positionedin the four quarters, possibly alluding to the fourphases of Venus (Fig. 5.7l).The stucco piers of House D at Palenque may de-pict two images of Venus as the Evening Star, distin-guished by their Ik insignia (Fig. 5.7m – n; Robertson1985b, fig. 243).

Asnoted earlier, Lounsbury (1974 : 11) links the daysign Ik with the cult of the Evening Star, because thisis the canonical day for the rise of the Evening Starin the Dresden Codex Venus table. It is interesting toending 9.14.0.0.0 (11/29/711; Lounsbury 1982 : 156 –157; Schele and Matthews 1998 : 146, fig. 4.16). Atoothy-skull glyph appears in a text associated withthe Katun end. Although Lounsbury associated itwith the first visibility of the Evening Star at the Ka-tun end, Venus actually rose four days later (Aveniand Hotaling 1994, table 1). The toothy-skull glyphmay actually refer to Venus in superior conjunction,which would be appropriate because the skeletalform may refer to the underworld. The Katun endingis also the night of the full Moon (6 : 16a.m., 11/30/711; Goldstine 1973). Tikal Stela 16, which depictsthe ruler wearing a mosaic headdress with a toothyskull backed by a Venus or star glyph, also recordsthe Katun ending 9.14.0.0.0, when the Moon was fulland Venus was about to reemerge as Evening Star(Fig. 5.7j). This type of skeletal imagery may relate toVenus when it was still invisible in superior conjunc-tion. Parallel images occur in central Mexico, for theCodex Borgia image discussed earlier shows Xolotl(the Evening Star) watching the skeletal MorningStar disappear into the underworld, indicating thatthe Morning Star was no longer visible and the Eve-ning Star was ascendant (Fig. 5.4d). In a study of thesequence of Venus images in Codex Borgia 29 – 46, Iconcluded that the skeletal Morning Star representstimes when Venus was invisible in superior conjunc-tion and times when the Morning Star was not vis-ible because the Evening Star had emerged (Milbrath1989 : 112, fig. 1).A number of Copa ́ n monuments with Katun-ending dates may be associated with the first visibil-ity of the Evening Star (Schele 1991a; Schele andFash 1991). Smoke Imix God K, who came to powerina.d.628 as the twelfth ruler of Copa ́ n, initiateda program of sculpture that focused on the helia-cal rise of the Evening Star at the Katun ending9.11.0.0.0 (10/9/652), recorded on Copa ́ n Stelae 2,3, 10, 13, 19, and 23. Certainly the rise of the Eve-ning Star so close to the Katun ending would havebeen considered an auspicious beginning for the newKatun, since the Evening Star was associated withagricultural fertility (Sprajc 1993a, 1993b). Louns-bury (1982 : 156) discovered that the Katun end-ing 9.11.0.0.0 coincides with the heliacal rise of theEvening Star in the Temple of the Inscriptions at Pa-192VENUS AND MERCURY: THE BODY DOUBLES"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"note that Copa ́ n Stela 7 names the Paddler Twinsand an Ik god who may be Venus on a date asso-ciated with the maximum altitude as Evening Star(9.9.0.0.0; 5/7/613; Aveni and Hotaling 1994, table 1;Schele 1987c). Further testing of the association be-tween Ik and the Evening star is called for.Venus imagery may appear in a different form onthe Palenque Palace Oval Tablet. Pacal II wears anIk glyph pectoral that may be a Venus reference(Lounsbury 1985 : 56; Robertson 1985a, fig. 91). Thepanel was set in a background that has a dancing fig-ure with a star glyph. Venus events coincide withevents in Pacal’s life in a surprising fashion. His birthdate may be linked with the first appearance of Ve-nus as the Evening Star (Du ̈ tting 1985 : 269). His ac-cession date ina.d.615 (9.9.2.4.8) corresponds tothe first appearance of Venus as the Morning Star(Berlin 1977 : 140). Such coincidences have led schol-ars to conclude that Pacal manipulated the dates ofhis life history to correspond to astronomical events(Marcus 1992 : 346).In sum, a number of monuments and architec-tural facades with star glyphs (usually T510b orT510f ) are linked with dates or orientations relatedto Venus events. Groupings of five such glyphs ortheir association with the number eight suggest theVenus Almanac. Katun endings in the Late Classicperiod coinciding approximately with the first ap-pearance of the Evening Star are associated with starglyphs and skeletal imagery, possibly an allusion to aspecific Venus phase. Not all star glyphs are relatedto Venus images and events, and not all Venus im-agery depicts star glyphs. The Ik symbol and certainstar-eye forms may be related to Venus. The starglyph seems to symbolize Venus in the day sign La-mat, in the Initial Series introductory glyph for themonth Yax, and in glyphic passages where it is pairedwith thechacprefix. The shell-star compounds mayalso refer specifically to Venus at times when theplanet is moving slowly through the sky.VENUS WARFAREFloyd Lounsbury (1982) was the first to associate Ve-nus specifically with warfare. His research demon-strates that warfare or raids are expressed with com-pounds involving stars, usually T510f over an earthsymbol, a shell, or a place-name (Fig. 5.7o – q). Hisstudy of the distribution of star-war dates indicatesthat war imagery is linked with the first visibility ofVenus in the morning and evening sky, as well aswith the short period of inferior conjunction. Thetiming of the Venus-war events indicates that theycluster in the dry season, the time of year preferredfor warfare, whereas raids could take place duringthe rainy season (Aveni and Hotaling 1994; Nahm1994). Apparently, warfare was avoided when Venuswas invisible in superior conjunction.John Justeson (1989, table 8.8) surveyed the star-glyph dates and found that star-war events wereuncommon during the canonical period of superiorconjunction, an artificially long period of ninetydays that overlaps with the last visibility of theMorning Star and the first visibility of the EveningStar. Justeson (1989 : 123 n. 20) concludes that someterritorial wars began at special points in the Venuscycle, but many more were timed by a lunar countbeginning with the heliacal rise of Venus. As far backas Protoclassic times, Venus was linked with warfare,for the La Mojarra Stela indicates that battles weretimed by Venus and the Venus-star glyph (*matza)was used as a warrior title (Justeson and Kaufman1993 : 1705, fig. 7c).The Venus warfare cult, found at a number ofMaya sites with imagery of a goggle-eyed deity laterknown as Tlaloc, apparently originated in Teoti-huaca ́ n (Carlson 1991, 1993). Venus warfare can betraced at least as far back as sixth-century Teotihua-ca ́ n, where the cult is linked with Tlaloc and the at-latl, a spear-thrower common in central Mexico. TheTeotihuaca ́ n trapeze-and-ray year sign, often associ-ated with this deity in the Maya area, may encode theVenus Almanac, according to Carlson (1993 : 212).Monochrome red murals in Teotihuaca ́ n’s Tepan-titla compound depict goggle-eyed warriors ema-nating flames who are framed by a corona of rays(Fig. 5.8a). Laurette Se ́ journe ́ (1976 : 106) identifiesthese as the warrior aspect of the Morning Star car-rying an atlatl. Although these figures do not haveTlaloc’s monstrous mouth, they have goggled eyesand may be connected with Venus imagery.A recently discovered stucco relief in the NorthVENUS WARFARE193"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Group at Palenque shows a goggle-eyed figure car-rying an atlatl, a counterpart for the storm god ofTeotihuaca ́ n, indicating a warrior cult linked withTlaloc at Palenque (Pl. 14). This relief probably rep-resents Venus in a warrior aspect.Schele (1991a) notes that a complex of symbolsborrowed from Teotihuaca ́ n accompanies the Mayastar-war complex. These include the goggle-eyedwar deity called Tlaloc by the Aztecs; a trapeze-and-ray sign symbolizing the Mexican ‘‘year sign’’; a full-bodied jaguar suit; a spherical ‘‘balloon’’ headdress;a War Serpent mask in a mosaic pattern; owls; andspear-throwers (Fig. 5.8c – d). Linda Schele and Da-vid Freidel (1990 : 444 – 446, fig. 4 : 17) propose thatthe Tlaloc warfare complex on Classic Maya monu-ments is associated with significant planetary posi-tions of Jupiter, Saturn, and Venus, especially Venusas an Evening Star.Aveni and Hotaling (1994) provide an excellentsynthesis of the star-war dates associated with spe-cific star-glyph compounds (Fig. 5.7o – q), plottingthem in terms of their proximity to Venus events,retrograde periods, and eclipses. They also plotteddates associated with the Tlaloc-war complex (Fig.5.8c – d) and thetsul ahaw(tzul ahau) glyph (Fig.5.7r). They use a chi-square statistical model to testwhether these ‘‘astronomically tagged’’ dates have adistribution that confirms a relationship with Venusevents. Testing ninety-eight dates, they found that96 percent matched times when Venus was visible,suggesting that the dates are not randomly distrib-uted. The majority of dates (70%) correlate with theEvening Star period. Of these, an unusually highpercentage correspond to the first appearances of theEvening Star (84%), if one allows a five-day windowon either side of the actual Venus event. Aveni andHotaling found that when there is not an appropri-ate Venus event, the dates can often be correlatedwith the first appearance of Mercury or with retro-grade motion of the superior planets.A convincing connection with Venus events is evi-dent in a star-war date recorded on Dos Pilas Stela 2(formerly known as Stela 16) and Aguateca Stela 2(Fig. 5.8c – d). Both monuments bear a ‘‘star-over-Seibal’’ glyph compound that refers to a war eventon 9.15.4.6.4 (11/27/735), which corresponds to thefirst appearance of the Evening Star (Fig. 5.7q; Aveniand Hotaling 1994, table 1; Lounsbury 1982, table1). Schele and Freidel (1990 : 445) link these monu-ments to an astronomical cult related to Tlaloc.

A second date (9.18.1.2.0; 11/9/791) corresponds to the first appearance of Venusas the Evening Star and to a ritual designating theheir to the throne. However, there are no clear ex-amples of the star glyph in the Initial Series inscrip-tions of Room 1 (M. Miller 1986 : 29).We can conclude that Venus was closely con-nected with warfare among the Maya. The pattern-ing of dates suggests that warfare was avoided duringtimes when Venus was invisible in superior conjunc-tion. There was also a seasonal cycle in the warfare,for the star-war dates seem to cluster in the dry sea-son. Although not all of these dates specifically relateto Venus, it seems that Venus was the most promi-nent planet in events involving warfare. Venus war-fare may be closely linked to Tlaloc imagery, andprobably was part of a cult imported from Teotihua-ca ́ n. As we will see, this cult seems to be associatedwith lineage founders at a number of sites, suggest-ing that foreigners bringing the cult may also havefounded dynasties in the Maya area.LINEAGE FOUNDERSAND THE VENUS CULTVenus may be linked with the founders of someMaya lineages. The ‘‘founder glyph’’ appears on Yax-chila ́ n Lintel 25, depicting a double-headed serpentbearing a ruler wearing a Tlaloc mask (Fig. 5.8f ).Peter Mathews (1990 : 91) identifies the masked fig-ure as an ancestral portrait. Tatiana Proskouriakoff(1993 : 90, 169) refers to the figure as an ancestor ofuncertain identity. Schele says the ancestor figure isYat Balam, the founder of a Yaxchila ́ n lineage or dy-nasty (Schele 1989a; Schele and Freidel 1990 : 266 –267, fig. 7 : 3b). The text alongside the serpent endswith a phrase that Carolyn Tate (1992 : 276) tran-scribes as ‘‘It is recorded, [the] alter ego [in?] [of ?]the house of the Founder of the Lineage.’’ Themasked figure seems to be a lineage founder con-nected with a goggle-eyed deity later known asTlaloc. His warlike stance hurling a spear evokes Ve-nus warfare. Another Tlaloc face appears in the jawsof the second serpent head at the base of the lintel.war event coincides with the beginning of the dryseason, the epoch of warfare. On both monuments,the ruler wears a Tlaloc mask and a headdress witha Mexican-style year sign, which is associated with avariant of Tlaloc known as Tlaloc A at Teotihuaca ́n(Pasztory 1974). Both rulers wear a goggle-eyed in-signia on the torso and an owl pendant as a war in-signia. Carlson (1993, fig. 8.2c) calls this bird theWar Emblem Owl, noting that it wears a five-pointedVenus symbol on the Dos Pilas stela. Given the linkbetween owl imagery and Mercury discussed at theend of this chapter, it is interesting to note thatMercury had just dipped below the horizon for itslast visibility as the Evening Star. Essentially the twoplanets traded places on 11/27/735.There is also evidence of Venus warfare in thenorthern Maya area at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ . The murals ofthe Upper Temple of the Jaguars show war eventsthat may relate to the Venus Almanac, as noted ear-lier. Venus may be linked with warfare and the dryseason on Lintel 4 of the Temple of Four Lintels.Michel Davoust (1991 : 156) reads the associated textasek’ tok’ pakal u kaban mah,translated as ‘‘Venusknife shield (war), his land dried.’’In Room 2 of Structure 1 at Bonampak, a battlescene is associated with a partial Calendar Roundthat Lounsbury (1982 : 149, 164) reconstructs as9.18.1.15.5 13 Chicchan 13 Yax, the day Venus wasin inferior conjunction and the date of the secondsolar zenith at the site. If we shift to the 584,283correlation, the date (7/31/792) marks the midpointof the planet’s disappearance interval around infe-rior conjunction, a few days before the solar zenith(Aveni and Hotaling 1994, table 1). Because the datesare problematical, we must be cautious in interpret-ing the nature of the Bonampak star-war events(Marcus 1992 : 426, 431). In any case, the astronomi-cal symbols in the ceiling of Room 2 show that astrol-ogy was important in timing the battle (Fig. 7.1i – j).Ultimate victory remained beyond their grasp, forwarfare caused Bonampak to be abandoned abruptlybefore the artists could complete the murals ofStructure 1, the last building constructed at the site.Venus is also implicated in the Calendar Rounddates that Lounsbury (1982 : 146, 158, 163, table 1)reconstructs for Room 1 at Bonampak. One date196VENUS AND MERCURY: THE BODY DOUBLES"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"The double-headed serpent on Lintel 25 intertwineswith a volute bearing a heavy-lidded eye framed byfive radiating elements, a form of Venus symbol thatmay refer to Venus as the ‘‘big eye.’’ The CalendarRound date 4 Imix 4 Mac (9.12.9.8.1; 10/18/681)marks a time when Venus was relatively high in thesky as the Evening Star.Venus seems to be the alter ego, orway,of Copa ́n’sroyal lineage (Andrews and Fash 1992 : 101). Schele(1992a : 141–142) notes that the founder is not ac-tually the first ruler at Copa ́ n, but he founded a spe-cific lineage traced back to the early fifth century.The lineage founder at Copa ́ n, who bears the nameYax K’uk’ Mo’, seems to be connected with Tlalocimagery, for he has goggled eyes on Copa ́ n Altar Q.Here he is associated with a founding event on 5 Ca-ban 15 Yaxkin (8.19.10.10.17; 9/3/426), when Venuswas approximately at its maximum altitude as theMorning Star (Schele 1989a : 2; Schele and Fash1991). It may also be significant that the full Moonwas setting while Mars, Mercury, and Jupiter wereall grouped close together on the eastern horizon atdawn on that date.The upper temple of Structure 16 at Copa ́ n hasthe founder glyph and goggle-eyed lineage founderYax K’uk’ Mo’ wearing a headdress with his birdspirit, a quetzal-macaw, as on Altar Q (Schele 1989a :5; Schele and Fash 1991). The Margarita Buildingdepicts a macaw intertwined with a quetzal, symbol-izing the name of the founder, K’inich Yax K’uk’ Mo’(Stuart 1997 : 84 – 85). This avian image evokes a linkwith murals from Teotihuaca ́ n that show a birdcombining attributes of both species (Berrin 1988,pls. 17 –19). One of these murals shows a quetzal-macaw holding a dart and a war shield, suggesting aguise of Venus (Miller 1973, fig. 363). The foundermay be linked with avian Venus imagery broughtfrom Teotihuaca ́ n (Coggins 1988c : 98 – 99).One example of the founder glyph compound atCopa ́ n depicts goggled eyes with pupils that take thesame form as central Mexican stars, recalling Tlaloc’sstar eyes in central Mexican art (Fig. 5.8i; Milbrath1980a). The main sign (T600) in the founder glyphhas been identified as a logograph referring to lin-eage (Grube, cited in Kurbjuhn 1989 : 82). Coggins(1993) suggests that the T600 glyph representsbound bundles like those used in the Aztec New FireCeremony, performed every 52 years at the end of aCalendar Round when the ‘‘vague year’’ and divina-tion calendar realigned. In fact, a longer cycle of timeis suggested because the bundles in the founder’sglyph are in pairs, suggesting instead the Great Cycleof about 104 years that links the Tzolkin, Venuscycles, and solar calendar (Fig. 4.8h – i).As mentioned earlier, there may be two lineages atChiche ́ n Itza ́ , one linked with the Sun, the other withVenus. The cycles of these two astronomical bodiesare connected in the Venus Almanac of 8 years andthe Great Cycle of 104 years. Goggle-eyed figureshold burning year bundles on the Temple of the War-riors, and year bundles appear as part of a calendarinscription on the Platform of Venus (Fig. 5.5a). TheGreat Cycle is recorded in the Dresden Codex, amanuscript that may have been painted arounda.d.1250 before Chiche ́ n Itza ́ was abandoned.We can conclude that the founder at two Mayasites is associated with a foreign cult with visualtrappings of the Tlaloc complex imported fromTeotihuaca ́ n, most probably connected with Venus.This complex involves the goggle-eyed deities anddeified lineage founders whose attributes suggestcentral Mexican connections. These founders maybe historical figures somehow connected with a Ve-nus cult imported from Teotihuaca ́ n, or they maybe mythological Venus figures that legitimize the di-vine ancestry of lineages claiming an affiliation withTeotihuaca ́n.TLALOC AND THE STORM GODSince the founder and Venus imagery are both con-nected with Tlaloc in the Maya area, we need tobetter understand the role this storm god plays incentral Mexico. The chronicles allude to Tlaloc’s as-tronomical nature. TheHistoria de los mexicanos porsus pinturas(1973 : 35) notes that Tlaloc is the fatherof the Moon. In another account, Tlaloc and theMoon rule the lowest heaven, beneath the heaven ofthe Sun (Codex Rı ́os, folios 1v – 2r). Tlaloc’s positionin the lowest heaven could allude to an inferiorplanet; only the Moon and the inferior planets passin front of the Sun, and in an Earth-centered cos-TLALOC AND THE STORM GOD197"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"thirteen vague years of 365 days beginning with 1Reed, linked with the day 1 Crocodile.

And if we continue the count to theend of the year 1 Rabbit, we have a total of forty yearsor five Venus Almanacs equaling 538 years or 5399 lunar months, implying a symbolic link with thefive Tlalocs. The year 1 Rabbit may have had specialsignificance because it was the year of the New FireCeremony in the epoch of the Codex Borgia, priorto a change made in Aztec times (Milbrath 1989 :117). Presumably the entire fifty-two-year cycle isalso represented because the next page (28) bringsthe count again to 1 Reed, the year that opened thecount on page 27.Page 28 has a similar composition to that seen onpage 27, but this time the five Tlalocs are associatedwith a cycle that runs for about five years. The se-quence begins with a date reconstructed as the year1 Reed, paired with the day 4 Movement, and runsthrough the year 5 Reed and the day 1 Water, record-ing a total interval of three synodic cycles of Venus(33584 days), according to Seler (1963, 1 : 263 –265), who notes that this is just seventy-three daysshort of five solar years. He concludes that this pagereflects an interest in comparing the solar year withthe Venus cycle, probably counted from the supe-rior-conjunction phase when Venus and the Sun arejoined together. I would add that counting from theend of the year 1 Rabbit on page 27 to the beginningof 5 Reed, the last year on page 28, gives a total ofsixteen years, or a double Venus Almanac, againlinking the cycles of the Sun, the Moon, and Venus.On page 28, each of the five Tlalocs is associated witha different kind of rain and a different fate for maize.Seler points out that each Tlaloc has different facepaint. In the year 1 Reed, symbolizing the easterndirection, Tlaloc wears the face paint of Tezcatlipoca,a god who is sometimes associated with Venus, es-pecially in the cult of Mixcoatl (Nicholson 1971 :426). In the year 2 Knife, representing the north,Tlaloc has the face paint of Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli,the god of the Morning Star. In the year 3 House,mos, they would seem to be in a layer beneath theSun. Tlaloc could symbolize either Venus or Mer-cury, but the evidence seems stronger for linkingTlaloc with Venus.Cecelia Klein’s (1980) extensive study of Tlaloc in-dicates that he controlled thunder and lightning; hewas closely associated with the calendar and time;and he may be especially linked with period endingsinvolving the Sun and Venus. She suggests that theyear sign in his headdress alludes to such period end-ings. Carlson (1993 : 212) proposes that the trapeze-and-ray year sign, when it appears in Tlaloc’s Venuswarfare complex, alludes to the Venus Almanac offive Venus cycles in eight solar years. Klein (1980 :178 –180) suggests that Tlaloc is the counterpart ofthe Maya bee Bacab Hobnil, connected with the Eve-ning Star. There are some images that seem to showhim with insect attributes (Klein 1980, fig. 9). Evi-dence presented earlier indicates bees and wasps maybe aspects of the Evening Star connected with theperiod of its rapid descent. Although it seems pre-mature to link Tlaloc with a specific Venus phase, theevidence linking him with Venus seems intriguing.Klein (1980) identifies Tlaloc’s eyes as mirrors,presumably with goggles representing the mirrorrim. In the Codex Borgia (25), his eyes are encircledby goggles made of turquoise, the same materialused for pendants, collars, and mirror backs. InAztec art, Tlaloc’s eyes are actually stars encircledby goggles (Codex Magliabecchiano, folios 34r, 44r;Milbrath 1980a). Stars and mirrors may overlap intheir imagery, for both share a shiny quality, andmirrors symbolize astronomical bodies in a numberof different contexts.Codex Borgia 27 shows five figures of Tlaloc thatEsther Pasztory (1974 : 7 –10) identifies as variants ofthe Teotihuaca ́ n storm god known as Tlaloc A, mostoften characterized by a headdress with knots or ayear sign. The Tlaloc figure positioned in the centerhas a year-sign headdress and the red striped bodypaint of the star gods (Fig. 5.8b). The four Tlalocssurrounding him appear with year signs marking asequence of years, each associated with a differentcardinal direction and different pests and weatherpatterns affecting the maize crop.

If Se-ler is correct, there could be an overlap with imageryof Xiuhtecuhtli as the Morning Star on Dresden Co-dex 49. In the year 4 Rabbit, Tlaloc has the facepainting and beard of Quetzalcoatl, another Venusgod. In the year 5 Reed, he has the face of Xochipilli,a god who conflates imagery of the Sun and Venusin some contexts (Klein 1976 : 11).The Miniature Temple in the Atetelco compoundat Teotihuaca ́ n has murals depicting feathered ser-pents framing a panel with multiple images ofTlaloc, represented with goggled eyes, fangs, and abifurcated serpent tongue (Miller 1973, fig. 346).The layout suggests that there were originally fiveTlaloc heads in a panel, implying a connection withthe Venus Almanac. Murals from the Patio of theJaguars in Zone 2 at Teotihuaca ́ n depict Tlaloc’s facesuperimposed on a design that is both a cross-sec-tion of a conch shell and a five-pointed star symbol-izing the ‘‘fiveness’’ of Venus (Fig. 5.8g; Miller 1973,rograde (5/5/682; Meeus n.d.). Since the planet’smaximum brilliance as the Morning Star followsabout two weeks after the end of retrograde, the in-creasing brilliance of the planet would be notable.This date appears with a heavy-lidded eye (T819)that may be a symbol representing Venus as a ‘‘bigeye,’’ appropriate to the name for Venus recorded inColonial period texts (Fig. 5.8j).At Copa ́ n, a jawless Tlaloc mask from Structure 26is flanked by heavy-lidded eyes framed by horseshoedesigns with radiating elements representing rays(Fig. 5.8k; Fash 1991, fig. 91). Images of a radiantVenus eye may also be seen at Acance ́ h, where thehorseshoe eye form is similarly surrounded by rays(Fig. 5.8l). Similar forms are seen in a set of five eyeson the Five-story Palace (Structure 5D-52) at Tikal,no doubt related to the ‘‘fiveness’’ of Venus (Pl. 18).This arrangement in turn can be linked to the fiveMaya-style Venus glyphs on the facade of the VenusTemple at Uxmal (Pl. 22).We can conclude that the storm god known asTlaloc in Aztec times is an astronomical deity whomoves in the same layer of heaven as the Moon andis the father of the Moon. Both Quetzalcoatl andTlaloc may represent complementary aspects of Ve-nus. Tlaloc is connected with the Venus Almanaclinking the Venus cycles to the cycles of the Sun andMoon, especially when he appears in sets of five. Onesuch set in the Codex Borgia shows Tlaloc conflatedwith various Venus gods in scenes associated with in-tervals appropriate to the Venus Almanac. His coun-terpart in the Maya area may be linked with datesthat mark significant positions of Venus. Rays and a‘‘horseshoe’’ element frame an eye form appearingwith Tlaloc imagery on several monuments, appar-ently a Maya glyph for Venus as the ‘‘big eye.’’CHAC AND GOD B IN COLONIALAND POSTCLASSIC YUCATA ́NIn the past it has been assumed that Chac and Tlalocare essentially the same entity in different culturalcontexts (Tozzer 1941 : 138). Today scholars seem re-luctant to identify Chac and Tlaloc as the same deity(Kowalski 1987 : 192; Taube 1992b : 22). Is Tlaloc thesame as Chac? They control the same realms: rainfallfigs. 24, 26, 30).The Classic period storm god with a headdressbearing a year sign or knots is the Teotihuaca ́ n godmost often seen in the Maya area (Tlaloc A; Fig. 5.8c –f ). Carlson (1993 : 204, 209) connects the variant ofTlaloc with the year sign with the Venus Almanac,and notes that the central Mexican Tlaloc representsa Venus cult of warfare and sacrifice. This variant ofTlaloc is clearly associated with a date marking thefirst appearance of the Evening Star on the monu-ments from Dos Pilas and Aguateca discussed ear-lier (Fig. 5.8c – d; Schele and Freidel 1990 : 147, 444 –445). Other Maya monuments with Tlaloc A seemto record different patterns in relation to Venus, asnoted in the discussion of the lineage founders.On Copa ́ n Stela 6, the ruler Smoke Imix God Kwears a jawless Tlaloc headdress with a knot and ayear sign (Fig. 5.8e). Jawless Tlaloc A faces, resem-bling the patron of the Maya month Pax, emergefrom either end of a double-headed serpent in theruler’s arms. This monument has Venus associations,according to Schele and Freidel (1990 : 445), whonote that the Initial Series date 9.12.10.0.0 9 Ahau 18Zotz is related to the retrograde of Venus.

Both Tlaloc and Chac (God B) hold alightning serpent and an axe, possibly symbolizingthe sound of thunder (Figs. 5.8b, 5.9a; compare withCodex Vaticanus B 43 – 48). Page 12 of the MadridCodex shows Chac wearing a modified year sign likethat on Tlaloc A, indicating that the two are mergedas a single deity (Fig. 7.3). There are five Chacs onpages 11–18. On the mask towers of the UxmalNunnery, the role of the fifth Chac is played byTlaloc, shown at the top of a stack of four Chacmasks (Fig. 5.9g). One tower illustrated by Kowal-ski (1990 : 52) depicts Tlaloc with a year sign in hismouth like the headdress of Tlaloc A. Both Chac andTlaloc are found in similar sets of five. It seems clearthey are essentially the same deity, but rendered indifferent styles.An axe glyph has been interpreted as the wordch’ak,a close counterpart for Chac’s name, althoughChac’s Postclassic name glyph does not actually in-corporate an axe. Chac’s T668 (cha) glyph has a T109affix that meanschac,orchakin the revised orthog-raphy, translated as ‘‘red’’ or ‘‘great’’ in Yucatec(Fig. 5.9b – c, e – f ). In the Postclassic Dresden CodexVenus pages, the planet is referred to aschac ek,‘‘greatstar’’ (Fig. 5.7a, bottom row). This pattern of namingsuggests a link between Chac and Venus, for the sameterm often refers to Venus in contemporary Maya ac-counts (Chapter 1).Chac’s title among the Maya is ‘‘the Chac whomakes brilliant the sky,’’ usually interpreted as animage of lightning, but also possibly an image ofbrilliant light (Thompson 1960 : 147). This would bean appropriate title for Venus, the brightest planet inthe sky. Studies of Venus imagery suggest that ‘‘theultimate power over the rains is held by Venus,’’ andthe northerly extreme of Venus coincided with theonset of the rainy season (Closs et al. 1984 : 230).Sprajc (1993a, 1993b) makes a strong case for link-ing the Evening Star aspect of Venus with rain-bring-ing and agricultural fertility. Chac may be linkedwith Venus in this aspect.In contemporary Yucatec Maya accounts, Chac’sprimary association is with weather and rainfall. In-formants from Quintana Roo say the Chac of theeast is red and sends rain; the Chac of the northis white and sends cold; the Chac of the west isblack and sends sickness and death; the Chac of thesouth is yellow and sends wind, appropriate becausethe predominant winds in Yucata ́ n come from thesoutheast (Barrera Marı ́n et al. 1976 : 483 – 484). Inanother Yucatec account, Chac is responsible forbringing rain, and four aspects of the god dwell inthe ‘‘trunk of heaven’’ in the eastern sky during thedry season (Redfield and Villa Rojas 1962 : 116). OnJune 2 they get their instructions from the archangelSaint Michael and they ride forth on four horses inFIG. 5.9.a:Postclassic Chac (God B), decorated withmirror body markings, holds lightning serpent and axesymbolizing sound of thunder (Dresden Codex 66a; afterVillacorta and Villacorta 1977).b:Postclassic Chac, bearing atlatl and darts like gods ofMorning Star (Dresden Codex 65b; after Villacorta andVillacorta 1977).c:Postclassic Chac seated on sky-band throne wearingshell earring topped by owl feather, recalling insignia ofother Venus gods (Dresden Codex 66b; after Villacortaand Villacorta 1977).d:Chac with water-lily headdress and serpent bodycovered with stars, evoking links with God H (Quetzal-coatl-Kukulcan), and water-lily serpent representingClassic period head variant of number thirteen (DresdenCodex 35b; after Villacorta and Villacorta 1977).e:Chac paddling his canoe in east, carrying merchantpack and owl headdress of God L, with an associatedprognostication of abundant maize (Dresden Codex 43c;after Villacorta and Villacorta 1977).f:In west, Chac holds torches and sits astride deaddeer, with an associated prognostication of drought anddeath (Dresden Codex 45c; after Villacorta and Villacorta1977).g:Stacked Chac heads with fifth Chac replaced byTlaloc face (mask tower of north building of Nunnery,Uxmal).h:Chac figure with war shield, serpent axe, and snakein mouth (mural from Terminal Classic Temple of ChacMool, Chiche ́ n Itza ́ ; after Taube 1992b, fig. 5c).i:Chac figure with snake in mouth carries spear andwar shield (relief from Terminal Classic Lower Temple ofJaguars, Chiche ́ n Itza ́ ; after Taube 1992b, fig. 5d).CHAC AND GOD B IN COLONIAL AND POSTCLASSIC YUCATA ́N201"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"days, one reaches the day beginning the next Venuscycle of 584 days. This means that each scene couldrefer to Venus events that repeat after 584 days haveelapsed. Thus the last picture with Chac in the cavemight refer to Venus disappearing in the underworldat the close of a period of visibility — an event thatwould recur every 584 days, or two Tzolkins plus 65days. In this case, the four previous pictures of Chacwould represent Venus positions prior to the planet’sdisappearance.On pages 42c – 45c of the Dresden Codex, Chacappears in five guises. Each scene shows black num-bers that begin with an interval of 17 days followedby numbers totaling 48 days (638 days), complet-ing a count of 65 days. Thus the four scenes togethertotal 260 days or one Tzolkin; however, the subdivi-sion into four sets of 65 days suggests an interest inVenus calculations. Each page has a glyph columnbeginning with a glyph compound referring to oneof the four cardinal directions. On page 42c, Chacdecapitates the Maize God in the south. On 43c,Chac paddles his canoe in the east, carrying the mer-chant pack and owl headdress of God L, a god of theMorning Star in the Dresden Codex Venus pages(Fig. 5.9e). Page 44c shows Chac as a fishing god inthe north. On the last page of the series (45c), Chacholds torches as he rides a deer in the west, the di-rection of the Evening Star (Fig. 5.9f ). The textseems to refer to drought and death (Thompson1972 : 106). The Chac of the west also brings death inmodern accounts. Chac wears an owl feather in threescenes, and in the fourth he carries an owl headdressin his boat. As we will see, the owl may be a guise forMercury, and the Venus god wearing an owl head-dress may refer to the close relationship betweenVenus and Mercury.Dresden Codex pages 30c – 33c cover a periodof 2,340 days, equaling four Venus cycles and nineTzolkin cycles. The scenes show Chac located on asky band and in trees, and in watery locations. Thecount begins on 11 Ahau on page 30c; intervals of 13days associated with each of the nine locations bringsthe total to 117 days, a period that approximates thesynodic period of Mercury. When the run is com-pleted five more times, as indicated by the first col-umn of day signs on page 30c, the total is 585 days.four different directions. The descriptions suggestthat these horses are different-colored clouds asso-ciated with different weather phenomena. The arch-angel may represent the fifth Chac, the one in thecenter who controls the clouds associated with thefour Chacs. They apparently send different kinds ofrain, suggesting a link with the five Tlalocs on CodexBorgia pages 27 and 28.In Yucatec Maya accounts, the rain gods arethe Grandfather Chacs (Nucuch Yum Chacob), oldbearded gods who are fond of smoking (Tozzer1941 : 138 n. 639). They bear a close relationship withthe Mams, gods of the mountains and of the rains,each linked with a color and a cardinal direction.Tozzer compares the Chacs to the Lacando ́ n deityNoho Chac Yum, who is one of four brothers asso-ciated with different cardinal directions. Their fatheris Chac Nicte. He may be the fifth Chac, the one atthe center.The god originally identified as God B of the codi-ces is now recognized as the Postclassic Chac. He isthe most frequently depicted god in the Dresden Co-dex, represented 134 times (Thompson 1972 : 27).Occasionally, Chac’s body is marked by mirrors, in-dicating his shiny aspect (Fig. 5.9a). Chac appears ona road in scenes that Thompson (1972 : 83) interpretsas references to Chac’s journey across the sky at thestart of the rainy season, carrying the rains to the fourcorners of the sky. Other scenes show him mountingsky bands and walking through water, suggestingmovements through the sky and the watery under-world (Fig. 5.9c). Sometimes he paddles across thewater, like the Paddler Twins (Fig. 5.9e).Five Chacs appear on Dresden Codex pages 29a –30a; four are situated on world trees that Thompson(1972 : 94) identifies as the four trees of the cardinalpoints; the fifth scene with Chac in a cave representsthe central direction. This imagery evokes the fiveChacs known from modern lore and the five Tlalocsin the Codex Borgia. The interval between each ofthe five scenes in the Dresden Codex is 13 days for atotal of 65 days (5313), an interval useful in cal-culating Venus periods. The dates at the beginning ofthe almanac indicate four sets of 65 days for a totalof 260 days.

Using the slightly largervalue of 117 days to approximate the Mercury cyclewould have allowed them to equate five Mercurycycles with one Venus cycle (V. Bricker 1988b : 84).Jesu ́ s Galindo (1994 : 88) points out that the intervalof 117 days may also be integrated with four lunarmonths. I would add that each column is spaced at aninterval of 65 days from the next, which suggests aperiod useful for Venus calculations, as noted above.Chac’s association with thirteen different loca-tions on Dresden Codex pages 65b – 69b is sugges-tive of thirteen different heavens (Fig. 5.9b – c). Kel-ley (1976 : 102, fig. 35) has been able to identify theglyphs of thirteen different localities on these pages.The sequence begins on page 65b with Chac pad-dling like the Paddler Twins, perhaps indicating a lo-cation on or near the Milky Way (Chapter 7). In theadjacent scene, he has an atlatl and darts, like godsof the Morning Star (Fig. 5.9b). In the next scene, hewalks on a road carrying a merchant pack. On thenext page (66b), he sits on a sky-band throne, justone of many scenes that show him on a sky band(Fig. 5.9c). Victoria and Harvey Bricker (1988; 1992 :51–52) relate this scene to June 21, 950, one day be-fore the summer solstice; however, following inter-pretations stated in their 1989 publication, this sec-tion could relate to the summer solstice ofa.d.1244(1989 : 241). Placing this table in the first half of thethirteenth century is in keeping with the date of thecodex indicated by the Venus pages. On the summersolstice ina.d.1244, Venus was the Evening Star ex-iting the Milky Way near Gemini. As in the DresdenCodex Venus pages, the sky band may refer to theintersection point of the Milky Way and the ecliptic,here serving as a throne for Venus. It should benoted, however, that such interpretations are validonly if we assume that the almanacs without calen-dar dates can be fixed at a specific point in time, adebatable proposition.Thompson (1972 : 83) relates this almanac to theone above on pages 65a – 69a because both total 91days each, referring to one quarter of the comput-ing year of 364 days. One full run through the upperand lower almanacs equals 182 days, and two runsapproximate a year of 364 days (V. Bricker and H.Bricker 1989, 1992). The Brickers (1992 : 51) main-tain that the text and pictures on 65a – 69a refer to a182-day period beginning in July ofa.d.949, and thelower table covers a similar span beginning in Mayofa.d.950. They note that whereas the upper tablecorrelates the eclipse seasons with the vernal equinoxand the Maya New Year, the lower table is concernedwith the relationship between the summer solsticeand the midpoint of the Haab. The Brickers (1989 :241) align the scene on page 68a showing twin Chacson a sky-band throne with the vernal equinox on3/20/950, N.S. (3/15/950 O.S.); the same seasonalposition for the almanac is evident ina.d.1243. Ve-nus was near the maximum altitude as Evening Starand positioned very close to the Pleiades on 3/20/1243 N.S. (3/13/1243 O.S.). During the Classic andPostclassic periods, Venus passed by the Pleiades al-ways between the spring equinox and the summersolstice, predicting or coinciding with the beginningof the rainy season (Milbrath 1988c). Twin Chacs onthe sky band may be Venus crossing the Milky Waynear the Pleiades. Venus may be represented by thetwin Chacs because Venus embodies duality as the‘‘star’’ of the morning and the evening skies.On Dresden Codex pages 35b – 37b, intervals to-taling fifty-two days accompany scenes that showChac in different aspects. The sequence begins onpage 35b, where Chac’s head appears on a serpentbody (Fig. 5.9d). Chac seems to be shown in a ser-pent guise that may be the counterpart of the centralMexican feathered serpent. Like the Water-lily Ser-pent on Classic period ceramics and the serpent onthe Early Classic Temple of the Seven Dolls at Dzi-bilchaltu ́ n, Chac on page 35b has a water-lily head-dress and a serpent body covered with ring-shapeddesigns that may represent stars (Chapter 7; Hell-muth 1987, figs. 321– 322). Taube (1992b : 56 –59)links the figure on Dresden 35b to God H, a Post-classic counterpart to the Classic period Water-lilySerpent representing the head variant of the numberthirteen. He also suggests a relationship with Quet-zalcoatl, who is an aspect of God H on Dresden Co-dex 4a (Fig. 5.4a). Taube adds that Classic periodimages link this serpent with the Ik sign.

Kowalski (1987 : 202)notes that there is compelling evidence for associat-ing these masks with the long-snouted God B whorepresents Chac in the codices. These masks, fre-quently grouped in sets of five, seem to allude to the‘‘fiveness’’ of Venus, representing five cycles of 584days that repeat at intervals of eight years (Aveni1991 : 315, 317). On the North Building of the Nun-nery at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ , there is a group of five Chacmasks with T510f star symbols under the eyes. Simi-larly, at the House of the Governors at Uxmal, thereare sets of five Chac masks and masks infixed withstar glyphs (Kowalski 1987, figs. 151, 153).At Chiche ́ n Itza ́ , four or five figures wearing Chacmasks appear in murals on the Temple of the ChacMool (Fig. 5.9h; Morris et al. 1931: Pl. 133). Al-though only partially preserved, these Chac figuresall appear to carry shields and burning serpent axes,the latter a form of lightning axe, according to Taube(1994 : 220). The Lower Temple of the Jaguars rep-resents another Terminal Classic Chac figure carry-ing a spear and a shield (Fig. 5.9i). All these Chacfigures wear a broad-brimmed hat like that on a rulerof the Terminal Classic period known as Lord Chac,seen on Uxmal Stela 14 (Taube 1992b, fig. 4e). Ux-mal Stela 14 depicts this ruler wearing a Chac maskand a headdress with towering tiers of feathers.Lord Chac is associated with astronomical glyphson the House of the Governor at Uxmal. His backrack is a stack of sky bands representing eightdouble-headed serpents, and it bears glyphic textsthat refer to the Sun and the Moon as well as a starglyph often linked with Venus (Kowalski 1987 : 180 –181, figs. 113 –115). The grouping of eight serpentsreflects an overlap with the East Building of theNunnery, where eight double-headed serpents arearranged in five sets, referring to the eight solar yearsit takes to complete five Venus cycles (Lamb 1980).As noted earlier, the lattice crosses within thesegroupings add up to 584, the number of days inone Venus cycle. In a previous section, I also notedthat Chac masks carved with the number eight onthe fourth platform of the Governor’s Palace atUxmal are related to the Venus cycle, designatingthe eight-year Venus Almanac and possibly also theinferior conjunction disappearance interval.Chac’s T668 name glyph. The Water-lily Serpent, inmy opinion, is a Venus image linked with a serpentaspect of Chac. Only Chac’s head is represented inthis imagery. A related image may be seen in a Ter-minal Classic period relief at Uxmal that depictsa Chac head in the jaws of the feathered serpent(Taube 1992b : 138, fig. 76b). Perhaps this complexcan be traced back to the Tlaloc heads with featheredserpents at Teotihuaca ́ n (Miller 1973, fig. 346).Chac may also have some connection with theMilky Way, called the ‘‘Vı ́a de Santiago’’ by thoseMaya people who use traditional Spanish terminol-ogy. It should be noted that Santiago is the name forthe Morning Star among the Quiche ́ and the Cakchi-quel (Cook 1986 : 149; Sprajc 1993a : 39). Among theChortı ́, the weather god is Santiago, who rules theMilky Way as a god of thunder and lightning; thismakes him the modern-day counterpart of Chac (Gi-rard 1962 : 251; Milbrath 1980b : 455). Schele (1992b :170) suggests a link between Chac and the MilkyWay in the context of an inscription in the Templeof the Foliated Cross that pairs Chac’s name with thegate to the Milky Way (Ek’ Way Chak). Perhaps Chacwas Venus as ruler of the Milky Way in the Classicperiod.We can conclude that Chac clearly represents anastronomical being associated with storms and rain-fall. His glyphic name (T109.668) may be read aschachac.There are sections of the Dresden Codexthat link Chac with the solar year, suggesting the so-lar cycle is somehow implicated in Chac’s imagery.Perhaps Chac is the Venus god that rules the rainyhalf of the year. His travels through the sky and intocaves suggests that he is one of the celestial wan-derers symbolizing a planetary god. His representa-tion in sets of five suggest that he embodies Venus.He is associated with almanacs that can be used toderive intervals that approximate the synodic pe-riod of Venus.

Images of Chac and GI sometimes share thesame type of ornaments: a shell diadem, Spondylusshell earflares, and a pectoral with trilobe ends(Fig. 5.10b – c; Schele and Miller 1986 : 275). Chac issometimes identified as the zoomorphic counterpartof GI, but their relationship is still poorly under-stood (Taube 1992b : 24). The Temple of the FoliatedCross at Palenque names Chac and GI as separatedeities (Fig. 4.6e; Schele 1992b : 170). Here both por-trait heads have a Spondylus shell earflare, but Chac’sface is zoomorphic.Typically, GI has scalloped eyebrows over squareeyes, a Roman nose, fish barbels on his cheeks, shellearflares, and a front tooth replaced by a shark’stooth or a tooth filed into aT-shape (Fig. 5.10g;Schele and Miller 1986 : 48 – 49). In contrast, theClassic period Chac’s face normally has an elongatedupper lip, and occasionally a serpent issues from hisjaws (Figs. 5.9h – i, 5.10a; Taube 1992b, figs. 5c – d,6c – e). Some examples of the Lamat glyph depictChac’s face with an infixed star glyph, suggestinglinks with Venus (Fig. 5.7d – e).GI is a fish god of some sort. Tom Jones (1991 :249 – 253, fig. 5) links GI to the old Fish (Stingray)Paddler, the solar deity of the Paddler Twins (Chap-ter 4). He identifies the fish traits as those of Xoc, ashark monster, suggesting that the fish barbels GIhas around his mouth are those of a nurse shark. Henotes that the central tooth of GI on the Rı ́o Azulmask is a combined form representing both a shark’stooth and a stingray spine, and the same insignia canappear in the quadripartite badge on GI’s headdress(Fig. 5.10h). This tooth is also found on the Xocmonster, a creature who also shares the same scrolleyebrows. On the other hand, Taube (1992b : 24)identifies GI’s face markings as catfish barbels, mak-ing him a catfish god instead of a shark.A number of scholars identify GI of the PalenqueTriad as a Classic period Venus god. Kelley (1965;1976 : 97) equates GI’s birthday on 9 Ik with 9 Wind,the birthday traditionally assigned to Quetzalcoatl,the Venus god of central Mexico. GI clearly belongsto an astronomical family; his mother is the MoonGoddess and one of his brothers is the Sun God(GIII). In establishing a connection between Venusand GI, Lounsbury (1985) points out that Venus isthe older brother in Maya folklore, just as GI is theolder brother in the Palenque Triad. The elderbrother is called Lord Xulab, referring to an ant thatis sometimes named as an eclipse monster linkedwith Venus, or Nohoch Ich (big eye /face), a nameoften applied to Venus. Following the birth ordergiven in the Classic period inscriptions and the iden-tifications in the Mopan tale, the eldest brother (GI)is Venus, the middle brother (GIII) is the Sun, andthe youngest brother (GII) is Mars or Jupiter.Schele and Miller (1986 : 306 n. 3) propose that GIis a Venus god with solar associations, linking himwith representations of Hun Ahau. Such an identifi-cation can be explained in astronomical terms, be-cause there is a close link between Venus and theSun. The Morning Star is the herald of the risingSun, and the Evening Star announces sunset.The connection between Venus and the entry andexit to the underworld may be one reason the de-ceased ruler was sometimes dressed as GI. This guiseis apparent in the jade funerary mask from Rı ́o Azul(Fig. 5.10h). Proskouriakoff (1993 : 58 – 60) suggeststhat Copa ́ n Stela I depicts a deceased ancestor of theroyal house impersonating GI of the Palenque Triad(Fig. 5.10j). This monument, erected in the reign ofSmoke Imix God K (a.d.628 – 695), bears an InitialSeries date of 9.12.3.14.0 (3/17/676), a time when Ve-nus was high in the sky and the Sun was exactly atthe vernal equinox (Schlak 1996 : 182).Deceased rulers also take the guise of Chac, as onthe Dumbarton Oaks Relief Panel 2 (Fig. 5.10d).Schele and Miller (1986 : 274 – 276) note that KanXul (K’an Hok’ Chitam II) dances in Xibalba wear-ing the costume of Chac Xib Chac.

On this date, Mars and the first visible cres-cent Moon were near Venus, just above the westernhorizon. This fortuitous interlocking of the three as-tronomical cycles at the end of the Katun 12 Ahauwas certainly noteworthy. Another Calendar Rounddate, 9 Manik 5 Muan (9.14.11.2.7; 11/18/722),seems to be the date of the ruler’s apotheosis, whenhe was transformed in heaven (Lounsbury 1985 : 55 –56). The dead ruler apparently took on the guise ofChac when the Morning Star Venus was about todisappear in conjunction, entering the underworldlike the deceased ruler.Monuments 23 and 24 from Quirigua ́ depict Chacin images that may also be linked with the ruler’sapotheosis (Fig. 5.10c; Baudez 1988, fig. 12). An-drea Stone (1983) shows that the two monumentsare closely related, since both depict Chac passingthrough a Cauac-marked opening. Monument 23(Altar of Zoomorph O) depicts Chac in profile, andMonument 24 (Altar of Zoomorph P) depicts Chacfrontally, with his mouth issuing long bands that endin skeletal zoomorphic heads with Ik eyes. On bothmonuments, Chac passes through a cleft openingframed by an Ik sign, a glyph some scholars relate tothe Evening Star. Venus may be implicated by detailsin the imagery on Monument 23: Chac’s shell beardand his stacked knot headdress evoke a connectionwith gods of the Morning Star on Dresden Codexpages 46 and 50 (Figs. 5.3a, e, 5.10c). Taube (1986,fig. 3) identifies the figure on Monument 23 as Chacopening the rock of sustenance with lightning. Onthe other hand, Baudez (1988 : 143 –144) argues thatMonuments 23 and 24 show a dead ruler swallowedby a crack in the earth. It is possible that both mon-uments show the resurrection or apotheosis of adead ruler in the guise of Chac, echoing the imageryof the resurrected Maize God emerging from a cleftopening (Fig. 3.11a – b). With so many dates on thesetwo monuments, it is difficult to pinpoint the as-sociated astronomical events. Nonetheless, the Ini-tial Series date on Monument 23, the date of SkyXul’s accession on 9.17.14.16.18 9 Etz’nab 1 Kankin(10/9/785), indicates that astronomy was probablyof interest, for on this date Jupiter and Venus werein conjunction in Scorpius, positioned just abovethe first crescent Moon. The Initial Series date onMonument 24 is a period-ending 9.18.5.0.0 4 Ahau13 Ceh (9/9/795), when Venus was once again theEvening Star, but now positioned in the adjacentconstellation (Libra) in conjunction with Mars.Naranjo Stela 21 seems to represent the livingruler Smoking Squirrel with deity attributes, includ-ing a shell beard and a stacked knot headdress seenon Venus gods (Maler 1908, pl. 35). According toProskouriakoff (1993 : 73 –74), Smoking Squirrel isFIG. 5.10.a:Classic portrait glyph of Chac has elongatedupper lip, Spondylus shell ear, and serpent in mouth (af-ter Taube 1992b, fig. 5e).b:Chac emerges from cavelike opening (Creation Tab-let from Palenque; after Robertson 1991, fig. 268).c:Chac, wearing stacked knot headdress of Venus gods,emerges from Cauac-marked opening in image of apo-theosis (Quirigua ́ Monument 23, Altar of Zoomorph O;after Baudez 1988, fig. 9).d:Kan Xul’s apotheosis in guise of Chac on Novem-ber 18, 722 (Julian), when Venus was rising at dawn inScorpius; his ancestors hold deity figures that may refer toplanets (Dumbarton Oaks Relief Panel 2; after Schele andMiller 1986, fig.

If so, he may be apotheosizedas Venus in the guise of Chac.A scene of Chac or GI emerging from water is rep-resented on Copa ́ n Structure 11. As noted earlier, arelief on the east door records an heir-designationevent associated with a ‘‘great star’’ inscription thatis only five days after the first appearance of the Eve-ning Star. The relief on the top step of the south fa-cade represents GI as if he were standing shoulderhigh in the waters of the underworld with two mon-key gods holding rattles, according to Schele andMiller (1986 : 122 –125). This would seem to be animage of the Evening Star just reemerging from thewaters of the underworld.Chac appears as a being with multiple aspectson the Tikal bones (MT 51A, 51B) from Burial 116in Temple I, the funerary monument of Ruler A(Fig. 5.10e – f ). His shell diadem and Spondylus shellearrings are characteristic features. The paired boneseach show a water scene with two Chacs in a canoeand one in water. In each scene, one Chac paddlesas the other two hold fish. The paddler scenes evokea link with the Paddler Twins. Chac’s activities as afishing god are also seen in the Postclassic DresdenCodex (44c). Chac appears in this role as far back asthe Preclassic period, as seen on Izapa Stela 1 (Coe1978b : 77).A figure sacrificing a jaguar baby on the Metro-politan Museum vase has been variously identifiedas GI or Chac Xib Chac, or an anthropomorphic im-age of Chac (Pl. 8; Schele and Miller 1986 : 49; Taube1992b : 24). The figure wears the Spondylus shell ear-flare typical of both GI and Chac. He has an anthro-pomorphic face like GI, but he carries an axe likeChac. His face ornament could be interpreted as ashell beard or the fish barbels of GI, for it is some-times difficult to distinguish the two. The two godscould be considered to be aspects of the same deitywere it not for the clear separation of Chac and GI inthe deity list at Palenque (Fig. 4.6e). The sacrificer onthe Metropolitan Museum vase seems ready to de-capitate a jaguar god who conflates a solar and lunardeity, suggesting the image of an eclipse (Chapter 4).This places the decapitator in the role of an eclipsemonster, a role appropriate to Venus.A black-background vase may represent one ofrepresented as a warrior at eighteen years of age. Theking wears the nose cruller of the Jaguar War Godand the shell earflares of Chac or GI, and he holdsa Jaguar War God shield (Fig. 4.2h). As noted inChapter 4, the dates on the monument are appropri-ate to imagery of the dry-season Moon, but they alsosignal an interest in Venus. The Initial Series date of9.13.14.4.2 (3/22 /706) marks the time when Venuswas the Evening Star in conjunction with Mars, justfollowing the spring equinox. Venus was also inretrograde motion, having reached its first station-ary point only five days earlier. A later date, recon-structed as a period-ending 9.13.15.0.0 13 Ahau 18Pax (12 /25/706), relates to the last visibility of Venusas the Morning Star following the winter solstice.Another date, 9.13.1.3.19 5 Cauac 2 Xul (5/23/693),associated with Smoking Squirrel’s childhood, alsorelates to Venus. At this time Venus was especiallybrilliant as the Evening Star and was approaching itsfirst stationary point (5/30/693; Meeus n.d.). Smok-ing Squirrel may have had a special connection withVenus, because battle dates on other Naranjo mon-uments seem to link his exploits in battle to signifi-cant positions of Venus (Schele and Freidel 1990 :191–193).Another ruler with traits of Chac appears at Yax-chila ́ n (Tate 1992, fig. 136). On its rear side facingStructure 40, Stela 11 depicts a Chac-masked rulerstanding before kneeling captives. The ruler has beenidentified as Bird Jaguar IV dressed as Chac Xib Chac(Schele and Miller 1986 : 215 – 216, fig. V.5a). Tate(1992 : 126 –128) interprets the masked figure on theback of the monument as Bird Jaguar masqueradingas GI to represent the newly emerged Evening Starin a lineage event. The date above the figure is 1 Imix19 Xul, reconstructed as 9.15.19.1.1 (5/29/750), atime when the Evening Star had been visible forabout a month. On the front of the monument, Tatenotes that Bird Jaguar and the deceased Shield JaguarI perform a period-ending event on 9 Ahau 18 Xul(9.15.15.0.0; 5/29/746). This event took place afterShield Jaguar’s death on 9.15.10.17.14 6 Ix 12 Yaxkin(6 /13/742) and before Bird Jaguar’s accession, anevent recorded with the Initial Series date 9.16.1.0.011 Ahau 8 Zec (4 /27/752).

Allthree are positioned on a celestial cord that may rep-resent the ecliptic (Chapter 3). The figures have beencompared to the Sun moving through the under-world in three different aspects, one representing GIof the Palenque Triad (Quirarte 1979). The threecould instead represent the transformation of Venusas it moves along the ecliptical cord.Early Classic cache vessels depict GI wearing aheaddress that represents either the Xoc monster orthe Quadripartite God (Fig. 5.10i). Hellmuth (1987 :351– 353, 369) points out that the front tooth of GIis itself a perforator for blood offerings, and GI’scache vessels are often found with stingray spine per-forators inside. Perhaps these vessels were buried af-ter blood offerings were made to Venus at importantpoints in the calendar. A number of these cache ves-sels show GI with face spots like those seen on theSun God and the Hun Ahau twin.In sum, both Chac and GI may be related to im-agery of Venus, but the relationship between GI andChac remains puzzling. Whereas Chac is shown fish-ing, GI seems to embody a fish, a distinction thatremains enigmatic. Perhaps they are different aspectsof Venus. GI may have a secondary association withthe Sun, just as Hunahpu is linked with both the Sunand the Morning Star. Deceased rulers can take theguise of either Chac or GI, transformations that mayhave to do with the ruler’s apotheosis in the sky.THE SIDEREAL POSITION OF VENUSThe eight-year Venus Almanac, probably in use bythe Classic period, indicates that the Maya must alsohave tracked the sidereal position of Venus. Theeight-year period that coordinates the solar year withthe synodic period of Venus also refers to the siderealcycle, because Venus follows a specific pattern ofconjunctions with constellations that will repeat ev-ery eight years. Even without the Venus Almanac, si-dereal positioning was certainly observed. The rela-tively short sidereal cycle of Venus (an average of224.7 days) means that the planet can be seen tomove through all the star groups of the zodiac, be-cause the planet’s sidereal cycle is shorter than themean period of its visibility in either the morning orevening sky (263 days).Dennis Tedlock (1991 : 172) has found evidencethat the position of Venus in the background of starsis important in the Popol Vuh. Cycles of the VenusAlmanac are suggested by the five houses where theHero Twins undergo ordeals in the underworld.These are as follows: the House of Darkness, theHouse of Cold, the House of the Jaguar, the Houseof the Bat, and the House of the Knife. Revising anearlier interpretation, Tedlock suggests that the fivehouses refer to five different sidereal positions of Ve-nus, reflecting the relationship of Venus’s synodicperiods to eight solar years. In support of this inter-pretation, I note that at least two of these houses (Batand Jaguar Houses) coordinate with animal constel-lations represented in Paris Codex 23 – 24 (Fig. 7.6;Chapter 7).Dennis Tedlock (1985 : 40, 111, 134; 1991) inter-prets Hun Hunahpu and Vucub Hunahpu positionedat a crossroads in the underworld as Venus crossingthe Milky Way near the rift between Scorpius andSagittarius, the same sidereal position reached whenthe Hero Twins arrive at the crossroads in the under-world later in the narrative. Since they are not yettransformed into the Sun and the Moon, Tedlockproposes that Hunahpu and Xbalanque replace theirfather and uncle as gods of the Morning Star, andwhen they take their trip to the underworld, theyrepresent Venus at the time the planet disappears insuperior conjunction. In their descent, they take theblack road of Xibalba, indicating the sidereal posi-tion of Venus in the rift of the Milky Way near Sag-ittarius. The rift represents a form of portal into theunderworld for Venus as it disappears as the Morn-ing Star, a sidereal position that recurs at this phaseapproximately every eight years.The different guises of the Morning Star in theDresden Codex Venus pages may well relate to dif-ferent sidereal positions of Venus. Using the sea-sonal pattern for the Dresden Codex Venus table dis-cussed above, we can see that over the course of eightyears (a.d.1219 –1227) the newly risen MorningStar on 1/19/1221 was in Capricorn (page 46); at thenext heliacal rise it moved to Leo (page 47), then toTHE SIDEREAL POSITION OF VENUS209"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"brath 1988c, table 1). For well over a thousand years,Venus passed by the Pleiades (approximate conjunc-tion) only during a three-month window announc-ing the coming rains or coinciding with the onsetof the rains. I believe that this sidereal position cameto be seen as a sign of rain, perhaps inspiring im-ages of the feathered serpent (Venus) wearing rattles(the Pleiades) and an association with agriculturalfertility.The Upper Temple of the Jaguars at Chiche ́ n Itza ́,featuring the feathered serpent with a rattle tail, ex-presses the relationship between Venus and the Ple-iades (Fig. 5.5e; Milbrath 1988c). The doorway is ori-ented with an azimuth of 2857398(Galindo 1994 :127); from the vantage point of the inner temple, theobserver could see a view very much like that seenthrough Window 1 of the Caracol, which has vir-tually the same azimuth of orientation (2857558).Arounda.d.900, the Pleiades were framed by theright side of the inner window as they were last seensetting in late April. A similar effect took place in thedoorway of the Upper Temple of the Jaguars. The Ple-iades setting at dusk during the Late Classic periodannounced that the time for planting was approach-ing with the onset of the rains (Milbrath 1988c : 69).The doorway probably also incorporates a diagonalaxis like that of Window 1 in the Caracol, which hasan oblique view oriented to the northern extreme ofVenus (Fig. 3.1b; Aveni 1980 : 263 – 264, figs. 91– 93).The sidereal position of Venus as it set in its northernextreme would repeat at the same time of year ateight-year intervals. The northern extreme of Ve-nus as Evening Star was probably important in pre-dictions about rainfall throughout Mesoamerica be-cause it occurred between April and May during theLate Classic period (Sprajc 1993a, 1993b).An Early Classic stucco relief at Acance ́ h in Yuca-ta ́ n represents a rattlesnake with Venus glyphs inwhat appears to be a zodiac sequence (Fig. 5.11a;Chapter 7). This may be the image of Venus in con-junction with the Pleiades at the onset of the rains.The Venus glyphs are half stars with five rays, likethose on the feathered serpents from Teotihuaca ́nand Maltrata, Veracruz (Figs. 5.4h, 5.6d). VirginiaMiller (1991 : 42 – 43, pl. 4) also notes that the Acan-Pisces (page 48), next to Libra (page 49), and on toTaurus (page 50). These Venus positions may influ-ence the attributes of the Venus gods in the DresdenCodex.At the time of the conquest, the Yucatec Maya ob-served Venus, Gemini, and the Pleiades to ‘‘tell thetime of night’’ (Tozzer 1941 : 132 –133). Thus, we canbe sure that they were aware of the periods when Ve-nus was in conjunction with Gemini and the Pleia-des. Although I have not made any extensive studyof Venus in conjunction with Gemini, such an eventwould tend to occur during the rainy season. Such aconjunction event might be represented on Lintel 41from Yaxchila ́ n, which shows Bird Jaguar wearing aTlaloc headdress represented with a large star-eyewith five points, evoking the ‘‘fiveness’’ of Venus(Tate 1992, fig. 148). A ‘‘star-over-shell’’ glyph isnoted with a 7 Imix 14 Zec date (9.16.4.1.1; 5/3/755),but there is no Venus station close at hand. The slowmotion of the Evening Star at this time may accountfor the shell-star compound, if we accept Schlak’shypothesis, but the headdress might allude to Ve-nus, now especially prominent in conjunction withGemini. Perhaps the dual nature of Venus gave it aspecial connection with Gemini, the brightest twinstars in the sky.The Yucatec Maya today see a special connectionbetween Venus and the Pleiades, for they say that theEvening Star is the ‘‘fire’’ of the Pleiades (Redfieldand Villa Rojas 1962 : 206). In Precolumbian times,the Maya also placed special emphasis on the timeswhen Venus passed by the Pleiades, calledtzab,the‘‘rattlesnake’s rattle,’’ in Yucata ́ n (Milbrath 1988c).At Teotihuaca ́ n and Xochicalco, a feathered rattlerappears on Classic period buildings oriented towardthe Pleiades setting at dusk, which coincided withthe onset of the rains; a similar pattern is apparentat Chiche ́ n Itza ́ during the terminal Classic period(Milbrath 1988c). These structures may express acalendar cycle linking Venus and the Pleiades. Areview of the dates during the Late Classic and Post-classic period when Venus passed by the Pleia-des (approximate conjunctions) indicates that all fallwithin a three-month span from the spring equinox(March 21) to the summer solstice (June 21; Mil-210VENUS AND MERCURY: THE BODY DOUBLES"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"ce ́ h star designs bear a resemblance to the Mayacompletion sign, and Coggins and Drucker (1988 :18) relate the completion sign to the Venus calendar.Venus passes by the bright red star Antares inScorpius, located 1807away from the Pleiades, be-tween the fall equinox and the winter solstice, over-lapping with the onset of the dry season. Because thePleiades and Scorpius are at opposite sides of the sky,the seasonal associations are reversed. In some cases,imagery linking Venus with a scorpion may reflectVenus in conjunction with stars in our constellationScorpius, represented as a scorpion in the Paris Co-dex zodiac, an unusual case of an overlap with West-ern astronomy (Fig. 7.7; Chapter 7).Images connecting Venus and a scorpion are ap-parent over a long span of time (Baus Czitrom 1990;Carlson 1991, 1993). If we accept the quincunx as anOlmec form of a Venus symbol, one of the earliestexamples of the connection between Venus and thescorpion constellation may date back to 900b.c.,asseen on San Lorenzo Monument 43. One of the lat-est known examples, dating betweena.d.1350 and1450, is on page 79a of the Madrid Codex, whereGod L is depicted with a scorpion tail and thorax,possibly a symbol of Venus in conjunction with thescorpion constellation or a seasonal aspect of Venus(Fig. 5.11b).A Classic period bench from Las Sepulturas atCopa ́ n depicts the Venus god with a scorpion tailand his arm laced through a T510f glyph (Pl. 19;Krupp 1997 : 265). A polychrome plate depicts aT510b glyph with a Venus-scorpion man having at-tributes of the Maize God (Carlson 1993, fig. 8.6d).This image may be explained by the fact that Venuspasses by the heart of the scorpion constellation dur-ing the season of the maize harvest.Analyzing Venus-scorpion imagery, John Carlsonsees the scorpion as one of the ‘‘faces’’ of Venus, not-ing that a scorpion constellation may appear in theDresden Codex Venus pages, which show a glyphiccompound that spellssinan,meaning ‘‘scorpion’’(Fig. 5.11c). The table divides twenty deity names(Fig. 5.3f – j, A–T) among the five synodic periods,with four deities for every cycle, each associated witha different Venus phase. Thompson’s (1960 : 220) lay-out places the scorpion (B) on line 17 at the end of thecanonical period of superior conjunction, when theEvening Star became visible on day 326 of the 584-day cycle. In the layout of the Venus pages describedearlier, day 326 fell on 5/25/1220, coinciding withthe solar zenith in northern Yucata ́ n and the monthwhen Scorpius was visible for the longest period oftime. Here the scorpion may be named because itrose at dusk when the Evening Star was in the west.In sum, we have only scratched the surface of pos-sible stellar images linked to the seasonal cycle ofVenus. Preliminary evidence indicates an interest inthe conjunction of Venus with the Pleiades and Scor-pius. In addition, Venus probably had five stellarhouses associated with constellations that markedimportant Venus stations in the eight-year almanac.These may appear in the Popol Vuh.VENUS AND THE MOONScholars have noted that the 260-day divination cal-endar seems to link the length of a human pregnancywith the approximate period Venus is visible ineither the morning or evening sky. John Burgess(1991 : 63) has proposed a more specific correlationbetween Venus and the Moon. He notes that the in-terval from the Moon’s conjunction with Venus afterthe planet has emerged from superior conjunctionto another such conjunction after inferior conjunc-tion averages 260 days, and he suggests that theTzolkin may owe its origin to this relationship.Calendric cycles linking the Sun, the Moon, andVenus are built into the structure of the DresdenCodex Venus table, for the Venus Almanac equatesfive Venus cycles with ninety-nine lunar months andeight solar years (Aveni 1992b : 104). The eclipsecycle could be integrated over the longer run of thetable (104 years). Through their lunar-based Venuscalendar, Mayan astronomers kept track of lunareclipses (Aveni 1992b : 107 –108). Each of the six basedates that served as starting points for the calendarin the Venus table was immediately preceded by alunar eclipse.One of the Venus gods in the Dresden CodexVenus pages, God L, appears with the aged MoonVENUS AND THE MOON211"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"212VENUS AND MERCURY: THE BODY DOUBLES"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Goddess in her role as an eclipse monster on Dres-den Codex page 74 (Fig. 7.4d; Chapter 4). He isshowered by water poured by Goddess O, who maybe the new Moon during the rainy season. AlthoughGod L represents the dry-season Morning Star in theVenus Almanac, his portrayal on page 74 suggests heis not exclusively a god of the dry season.God L is involved in imagery that suggests con-junction of the Moon and Venus. On page 14c of theDresden Codex, God L is paired with the Moon inan amorous scene (Fig. 5.11d). Like God N, he is anaged god lover with only a few remaining teeth. GodL holds the young Moon Goddess, who offers thesymbol of maize tortillas, represented by the T506glyph (wah;Justeson 1984 : 339). This image alludesto the close connection between Venus, the Moon,and maize. His broad-brimmed hat is crowned byan owl with another T506 glyph and maize foliationin place of a tail (compare Taube 1992b, fig. 17f ).God L embracing the youthful Moon Goddess prob-ably refers to the waxing Moon joining Venus in itsaspect as God L. The link with the waxing Moonwould suggest that here God L takes the role of theEvening Star. The maize imagery recalls the connec-tion between the Evening Star and maize noted bySprajc (1993a, 1993b). As Carlson (1991 : 24) pointsout, ‘‘Venus and the Moon form a Maya structuralpairing within the Maize God complex.’’Thompson (1960 : 228 – 229) notes that the Mayamay have recorded Venus conjunctions with theMoon on Classic Maya monuments. He suggeststhat a date on the Palenque Tablet of the 96 Glyphs,associated with glyphs for Venus and the Moon,represents their conjunction on this date (9.16.13.0.79 Manik 15 Uo; H1-G2). This is a case where the584,285 correlation seems more compelling, for thedate would be 3/4 /764 O.S., when the Moon was justabove Venus. In this scenario, Venus was be-ing ‘‘mooned’’ as the crescent Moon passed by Ve-nus (Aveni, personal communication 1993). On theother hand, Ringle and Smith-Stark (1996 : 37, 44)interpret this passage quite differently, and furtherresearch is required to confirm possible records ofthe Moon’s conjunction with Venus.A number of scholars have noted that the Moonand Venus seem to play a role in imagery of resurrec-tion (Ashmore 1991 : 212; Du ̈ tting 1984, 1985). OnYaxchila ́ n Lintel 25, the ancestor figure seems to rep-resent Tlaloc in his aspect as Venus. Lady Xoc mayplay the role of the first crescent Moon just emergingon the Calendar Round date recorded on the monu-ment (5 Imix 4 Mac; 10/18/681). On this date, thefirst crescent Moon appeared beneath the EveningStar. Perhaps this spatial relationship is representedby the ruler hovering over Lady Xoc. The ancestorwearing the Tlaloc mask aims his spear at Lady Xoc,who holds up bloodletting equipment and an of-fering of blood (Schele and Miller 1986 : 177). Thebloodletting act is appropriate as an offering to Ve-nus, for the principal god of penance, sacrifice, andbloodletting among the Aztecs was the Venus godknown as Quetzalcoatl (Coe 1988 : 226).A painted vase known as Grolier 42 depicts lunardeities with Venus in its aspect as God L (Fig. 5.11e;Coe 1973, no. 42; 1978b, no. 1). Here he sits on athrone with the lunar rabbit acting as his scribe. Theowl in his headdress has extremely long tail feathers,reminiscent of a quetzal.

Nodoubt Maya artists explored this imagery, but wehave only begun to understand the nature of thisiconography and the calendar cycles implicit in con-junction events involving the two.MERCURY IN MAYA IMAGERYAND CALENDRICSEvidence of Mercury cycles is difficult to documentin calendar records. Thompson (1960 : 215) notesthat ‘‘it is very doubtful that the Maya paid any at-tention to the synodic revolution of Mercury, whichis short and difficult to observe accurately.’’ Never-theless, they certainly must have been aware ofMercury, because its movements are similar to thoseof Venus, the most important planet in Maya cos-mology. Indeed, it is not inconceivable that someof the ethnographic and Colonial period referencesto the Morning Star or the Evening Star may actuallyrefer to Mercury.Mercury is mentioned by its European name insome Colonial period accounts. In the ChilamBalam of Manı ́, Mercury is connected with illness,death, robbery, debt, and drunkenness, and theplanet is said to control the lungs (Craine and Rein-dorp 1979 : 49 –50). Further study of these attributesin relation to medieval European astrology is re-quired to sort out whether there is any Precolumbiancontent.Dennis Tedlock (1985 : 154, 347, 361) concludesthat the Popol Vuh represents Mercury as an owl;there are actually four owls, two of which may be themorning aspect of Mercury and the other two theevening aspect. As the Military Keepers of the Matfor the Lords of Xibalba, Macaw Owl and ShootingOwl have an underworld association appropriate toMercury. According to Tedlock (1985 : 154, 347),Macaw Owl (Caquix Tucur) is Mercury as the mes-senger of Xibalba. The role of Mercury as a messen-capitate a seated deity bearing the same god mark-ings. The Calendar Round date of the sacrifice (8 Ca-ban 5 Ceh) is reconstructed as 9.14.4.15.17 (9/20/716) by Arthur Schlak (1996 : 197), who proposesthat the imagery is linked with the autumn equinox,when Venus had just emerged as the Evening Star.The astronomical new Moon took place about threehours before dusk (Goldstine 1973). Perhaps thesacrificer symbolizes Venus, and the Moon God isabout to lose his ‘‘head.’’ The scene with God Lshows the lunar rabbit, perhaps alluding to a differ-ent lunar phase.A pot known as Regal Rabbit Vase shows God Lstripped of his regalia, unclothed and gesturing insubmission to a lunar rabbit who holds his owl hatmarked with the glyph 13 Sky (Pl. 9, right). The be-ginning of the sequence, designated by the openingglyph of the Primary Standard Sequence, has a sub-sidiary set of glyphs that may refer to God L as aPauahtun (T64 : 761v : 59). This leads Dieter Du ̈ ttingand Richard Johnson (1993) to conclude that some-how God L is transformed into God N when he loseshis regalia. They reconstruct an associated CalendarRound date (13 Oc 18 Uo, far left) as 9.13.8.2.10,when Venus was the Morning Star, and they interpretthe lunar imagery based on the 584,285 correlation.Nonetheless, the 584,283 correlation provides a moreinteresting picture, for the date (3/21/700) correlateswith a time when the waning Moon and Venus werein conjunction. This could explain why the lunarrabbit holds God L’s regalia, and why the two seemto have changed attributes, for God L has a rabbitpaw in place of his left hand, and the rabbit has GodL’s hand in place of a paw. The two celestial deitiesmay have merged attributes while in conjunction.A second scene on this vase shows God L kneelingin submission to the Sun God. Du ̈ tting and Johnson(1993) link the 7 Akbal date to events thirty-threedays later. Here, too, I find an interesting pictureby using the 584,283 correlation, for on 4 /23/700the Moon disappeared in conjunction with the Sun(new Moon on 4 /24 /700; Goldstine 1973). Thiswould explain why the lunar rabbit is now hidingbehind the Sun God seated on a jaguar skin throne.At the same time, Venus moved into conjunctionwith Mars, which might be represented by the deer214VENUS AND MERCURY: THE BODY DOUBLES"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"ger to the underworld seems apt, because Mercuryspends so much time invisible in conjunction. Ted-lock says that Macaw Owl is the Classic Maya Muanbird, which he identifies as an owl with a macaw tail.Kelley (1976 : 6) links a table on Dresden Co-dex 69 –73 with Mercury intervals, but he cannotidentify a glyph for Mercury. On page 69, a blackChac emerges from the jaws of a feathered serpent.Since Kelley (1980 : S20) identifies both Quetzalcoatl-Kukulcan and Chac as Mercury, he presumablywould identify these as Mercury images. Nonethe-less, the evidence presented in this chapter indicatesboth are associated with Venus.In the past, scholars have proposed that intervalsof 115 and 117 days are approximations of Mercury’s115.9-day cycle. Beth Collea (1981 : 216) notes thatthe 115-day period Ernst Fo ̈ rstemann identified as aMercury interval has proved invalid. The 117-dayinterval supported by Yurii Knorozov (1982) and Je-su ́ s Galindo (1994 : 88) seems to be too far from thetrue length of Mercury’s synodical cycle. Nonethe-less, over the short term, 117 may be a useful ap-proximation, especially in situations where Mercuryis integrated with other calendar cycles. The intervalof 117 days is an even multiple of synodic lunarmonths (11754329.25), and it also approximatesone-fifth of the synodical cycle of Venus. As notedearlier, almanacs of 117 days appear in sets of fivein the Dresden Codex (30c – 33c), for a total of 585days, an interval that brings the Venus cycle andMercury into renewed alignment. Chac is the maincharacter on these pages.Owl imagery may suggest a link with Mercury. OnDresden Codex 43c, Chac carries God L’s owl (Mer-cury?) hat in his canoe (Fig. 5.9e). In other se-quences, Chac wears an owl feather, possibly indicat-ing a connection with Mercury, as on pages 45c and65 – 69 (Fig. 5.9a, c, f ).On a Classic period vase, God L’s owl holds theJaguar War God’s head in his beak, suggesting an-other image of astronomical conjunction (Coe 1982,no. 15). God L’s bird has a celestial aspect, for he isnamed with a 9 Sky title on the Vase of the SevenGods (Pl. 7). On the Regal Rabbit Vase, this bird isnamed 13 Sky, interpreted as a reference to the high-est heaven (Pl. 9; Du ̈ tting and Johnson 1993 : 168).Owls represented in the Dresden Codex (7c, 10a)sometimes also bear the 13 Sky title (Grube andSchele 1994 : 12). The name 13 Sky is one of the as-tronomical gods marking the southern direction inthe Venus pages of the Dresden Codex (Kelley 1976,fig. 28). A related owl bears the name 13 Muan in ascene where he is carried by the Moon Goddess(Dresden Codex 18b).Taube (1992b : 85) identifies God L’s bird as theMoan (Muan) owl, and agrees with Thompson thatthis bird with a feather crest is a screech owl or ahorned owl. Thompson (1960 : 49, 114 –115) identi-fies the bird with the 13 Sky title as the Muan bird,the main sign for the month Muan (T748 : 116), amonth he associates with rainfall. He notes that theMuan owl must be distinguished from thecui,a birdof ill omen representing another species of owl. Thisis the same one that Grube and Schele (1994 : 10 –12)identify as thekuyowl of warfare; they conclude thatthe Muan bird is a hawk, whereas God L’s compan-ion bird is thekuyowl, a Ferruginous Pygmy Owl(Glaucidium brasilianum). They note that God L’sowl was associated with Tlaloc-Venus warfare in theClassic period and generally had an ominous nature.God L’s bird, apparently an owl with a negative as-pect, may be Mercury, which makes frequent trips tothe underworld. This bird may appear as God L’s hat,because Venus and Mercury are closely related intheir motions. If this is the case, the Muan bird mayrepresent a bird constellation (Chapter 7).Aveni and Hotaling (1994 : S38 – S39, table 1) as-sessed ninety-eight dates that have astronomical tags,including dates associated with the Tlaloc-war com-plex that involve an owl-like bird that may representMercury. Eighteen of the ninety-eight dates showeda correlation with Mercury events. They suggest thatsometimes the Mercury event was substituted whenVenus was not in the appropriate position. Morethan half correspond to times when Mercury firstappeared in the evening sky simultaneously with thefirst appearance of Venus as the Evening Star.Arthur Schlak links the planet Mercury with GodK and GII of the Palenque Triad.

Itztlacoliuhqui is the aspect ofVenus linked with the rainy season around the sum-mer solstice, the time that maize sprouts. LahunChan embodies Venus during the rainy-season pe-riod in August when the early maize crop matures. Ahowler monkey represents Venus during the dry-season period in April when the fields are preparedfor planting. The central Mexican Fire God depictsVenus at the onset of the dry season in Novemberwhen the harvest begins. If all the gods of the Morn-ing Star rule the eighty-day period of the planet’srapid ascent, the last two deities can be linked withthe season associated with their central Mexicancounterparts. As Venus rose it hurled its atlatl dartacross the sky, killing the astronomical deity at theopposite side of the sky. The victims at the bottomof each page seem to represent astronomical bodiesin opposition to the Morning Star. The turtle prob-ably represents stars in the region of Orion, and afish god may refer to stars in Sagittarius. God Kseems to symbolize Jupiter in retrograde. The Water-lily Jaguar may be a rainy-season aspect of the moon.The enthroned regents may show astronomical godspositioned at the intersection of the Milky Way andthe ecliptic depicted by a sky-band throne. Their as-sociation with the east derives from their link withthe emerging Morning Star.There seems to be an unbroken chain of imageryfrom the Classic period through today that makesVenus part of a triad. Birth order makes him theolder brother of the Sun. GI, the elder brother in thePalenque Triad, may be identified with Venus. Chacseems closely related to GI. Other elements link Chacand his Postclassic counterpart, God B, to Venus, in-cluding an association with sets of five and the num-ber eight, embodying the Venus Almanac of eightyears. Chac in turn is linked with Tlaloc, associatedwith rainfall and the cycle of maize. Tlaloc and Chacalso have a warlike aspect in Maya art. Venus is anagent both of warfare and of agricultural fertility,two apparently opposed associations that must beunderstood in light of the changing nature of Venus.The Dresden Codex shows that the Morning StarIn sum, interpretations of the Popol Vuh suggestthat Mercury may be a subsidiary figure, possibly anocturnal bird that is an avian messenger to theunderworld. In Postclassic images, Chac sometimesalso seems to be associated with an owl, but here isrepresented more subtly as a feather ornament in hisheaddress. Mercury may be an owl on God L’s head-dress, expressing the close relationship between Ve-nus and Mercury that extends back to the Classic pe-riod. Mercury also may be an owl represented as awarbird with Tlaloc in Classic period representations.THE INFERIOR PLANETSIN THE MAYA WORLDVIEWExcept for a possible connection with owl imagery,relatively little is known about Mercury’s avatars inMaya art. It may be that one of the gods now thoughtto represent Venus may in fact refer to Mercury. Infuture studies, we should bear in mind that Mercuryis frequently invisible, so we should expect to findMercury imagery connected with the underworld.For Venus, we have almost too much informationto condense in a single chapter. Even so, this studyhas only begun to reveal the multiple personalities ofVenus, with its different seasonal aspects, siderealpositions, and phases. Venus is best described as amaster of transformation, taking on different guisesin its changing relation to the seasons. The DresdenCodex Venus pages provide a template for under-standing the seasonal aspects of the Morning Starduring the Postclassic period. Here five Venus godsrepresent the newly emerged Morning Star over aneight-year cycle that was tracked over hundreds ofyears. The codex seems to show real-time events dat-ing to the mid-thirteenth century, as well as histori-cal references that go back to the seventh century.The historical data are recorded in Long Count in-scriptions, whereas the current events are given inCalendar Round dates.

Like players on a stage performing in front of different sets,the planets move through the changing background of stars in different sections ofthe sky. Given that they are such dynamic actors, we should not be surprised to findthem as characters in folktales and visual imagery. Venus, the most brilliant planet,clearly takes the leading part, but the superior planets also play roles in the celestialdrama.Although contemporary tales preserve very little information on planets otherthan Venus, there are a few that indicate that one of the superior planets plays therole of younger brother of Venus and the Sun. Folktales provide a clue to the identityof the youngest member of the Palenque Triad. As we will see, Jupiter is linked withGII of the Triad, the counterpart of God K in the Postclassic codices. Study of thecodices indicates that Mars may be a deer monster. Monkeylike creatures in Classicperiod Maya art may also represent planets. There are a number of celestial deitiesthat may prove to be linked with the superior planets, but at present they cannot beidentified with any certainty due, in part, to a lack of information about the superiorplanets in the Colonial period sources.This chapter begins with a discussion of Colonial period information on planets.There follows an analysis of Precolumbian Maya images of Mars, including the well-known Mars Beast. The chapter also explores the role of monkeys in imagery of theplanets. God K and his Classic period counterpart are featured in another sectionthat explores links with the planet Jupiter. The chapter closes with sections on Clas-sic Maya calendar inscriptions related to Jupiter and a study of images that depictgroups of planetary gods.COLONIAL PERIOD IMAGES OF THE SUPERIOR PLANETSColonial period dictionaries provide relatively little information on the planets.Some names reflect European influence, such as the termplanetob,combining aEuropean word with the Yucatec plural ending-ob(Coe 1975a :19). Others seem toembody native constructs, such aslacam ek,meaning ‘‘big star’’ or ‘‘great star,’’glossed as ‘‘banner star’’ and ‘‘somersault star’’ (Lamb 1981 : 242). The latter suggeststhe retrograde motion of a planet that seems to ‘‘roll over’’ in the opposite direction"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"before resuming forward motion. Another intrigu-ing Yucatec reference is the ‘‘female crocodile star,’’identified as Saturn (Lamb 1981 : 242). Anotherterm,chachac ek,refers to the seven planets of me-dieval times, derived from classical antiquity, repre-senting the Sun, the Moon, and five planets visibleto the naked eye (Roys 1967 :150 n. 4).The superior planets may appear as characters inthe Popol Vuh. Dennis Tedlock (1991) identifies twofalcon messengers as Jupiter and Saturn, but this in-terpretation is based on analysis of their roles ratherthan on direct identifications made by the Quiche ́.Tedlock (1985 : 336, 346) concludes thatuoc(falcon)may correspond to Jupiter. Laughing Falcon (uac),who brings a message to the Hero Twins at one pointin the tale, may be Saturn. Tedlock notes that Marsprobably is represented by the two monkeys whoare the elder half brothers of the Hero Twins in thePopol Vuh (Tedlock 1985 : 353; 1991 : 174). This talerecounts that the future Sun and Moon were mis-treated by their simian brothers, who gave them al-most no food and even tried to kill the twins. TheHero Twins convince the half brothers to climb atree to get down a bird, and there they turn theminto monkeys. As monkeys, they danced and didacrobatics while Hunahpu and Xbalanque played atune called ‘‘Hunahpu Monkey.’’ Tedlock (1985 : 342)believes that this episode is re-created in Momo-stenango in the Monkey Dance, in which two mendressed as monkeys with stars on their bodies climba high pole and do acrobatics on a tightrope.In sum, the Colonial period Maya sources provideus very few hints about the planets. We only have themost general information on the planets recorded inthe early dictionaries. It is possible that falcons andmonkeys may play the role of planets in the PopolVuh, but their identities cannot be confirmed until amore thorough study of Precolumbian Maya im-agery is undertaken.MARS AMONG THEPRECOLUMBIAN MAYAFortunately, the Postclassic codices help to identify atleast one of the superior planets. Our main source ofinformation on Mars imagery comes from represen-tations in the Mars table in the Dresden Codex pages43b – 45b (Fig. 6.1a). Robert Willson (1924 : 22 – 25)first recognized that the table deals with intervals of780 days, approximating the mean synodic period ofthe red planet, and that the almanac section refers toa 78-day period that is very close to the average retro-grade period (75 days) of the planet Mars. He notesthat the table begins with a Ring Number (17.12, or352 days) that is close to the interval between theplanet’s conjunction with the Sun and its first station-ary point, or between the second stationary point andconjunction (35217613525780 days). His con-clusions are now widely accepted (Aveni 1980 : 195 –199; H. Bricker and V. Bricker 1997; Justeson 1989 :110; Knorozov 1982 : 163). David Kelley (1983 : 178)supports the association with Mars and points outthat a Mars table in the context of a Tzolkin almanacis appropriate because over time the mean synodicperiod of Mars shifts only slowly from a givenTzolkin date, although the actual conjunctions ofMars with the Sun can vary up to about plus or mi-nus 30 days from the mean.In his commentary to the Dresden Codex, EricThompson (1972 : 22 – 23, 107 –109) attempts to re-fute Willson’s analysis of the table, arguing that the780-day intervals refer to three complete Tzolkins(33260) and the content deals primarily withweather. Because the table is not structured like theVenus table, Thompson maintains that it cannot bea planetary table. However, John Justeson (1989 :98 – 99) points out that the structure of the Venustable is inappropriate for a Mars table, and becausethe 780-day Mars cycle is inherently related to atriple Tzolkin, the proper format is a divinatory al-manac. Victoria and Harvey Bricker (1986b) explorethe relationship with Mars in great detail, suggest-ing additional patterns not noted by Willson. BruceLove (1995) questions their findings, but they havemounted a spirited defense of their position thatdeals effectively with many of the issues raised byLove (H. Bricker and V. Bricker 1997). Justeson(1989 : 98) supports the Brickers in linking the tablewith Mars. He also agrees with their analysis of theaberrant numbers in the multiplication table, al-though he differs in the details of how these mul-tiples functioned in relation to heliacal rise dates. HeMARS AMONG THE PRECOLUMBIAN MAYA219"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"proposes that the aberrant multiples refer not to thesynodic period but rather to multiples of 260 daysused to recapture approximate dates of heliacal rise(1989 : 100). Those that the Brickers identify as mul-tiples involving a 520-day addition (columns six andeight, Fig. 6.1a) Justeson sees as multiples show-ing subtraction of 260 days. For example, instead of1637801520 on page 44b, Justeson sees 1737802260. His model provides a more uniform methodof adjustment and seems preferable to the model of-fered by the Brickers.The opening inscription is 3 Lamat, followedby the Mars Beast glyph, then an inscription of9.19.8.15.0, which Thompson (1972 : 107) interpretsas a Long Reckoning giving the interval from the be-ginning of the era on 13.0.0.0.0 4 Ahau 8 Cumku,although only 4 Ahau is noted at the bottom of thecolumn. This calculation brings the base date ofthe calendar to 9.19.7.15.8 3 Lamat, correlating withMarch 24, 818, in the Gregorian calendar (3/20/818O.S.). Although only the 3 Lamat date is actuallynoted, scholars generally agree with Thompson thatthis is the base date for the table.The retrograde of Mars in the yeara.d.818 beganon 5/13/818, when the planet was positioned in theMilky Way in Sagittarius fifty days after the proposed3 Lamat base of the table. At the end of retrograde,Mars was within one degree of its original positionon the base date (3/20/818). Indeed, the entire ret-rograde period (5/13/818 to 7/7/818) took placewhile Mars was in Sagittarius. The Mars Beast in allfour pictures is suspended from a sky band, con-forming to a pattern that links the sky band withthe place where the ecliptic crosses the Milky Way(Chapter 7). This suggests that the base date corre-lates with a time when Mars crossed the Milky Way.After the introductory column, there follows a se-ries of Tzolkin dates that mark the day reached whenadding an interval given in the same column to theday 3 Lamat found at the beginning of the table. Twocolumns show errors in the intervals recorded, butthe Tzolkin dates are correct. All the multiples of780 days correlate with 3 Lamat dates, including theone that is 13780 or 10378; all other multiplesof 78 bear different Tzolkin dates. The multiples of78 days are apparently to be used with the pictorialalmanac that incorporates an interval of 78 days, ex-pressed horizontally with the numbers 19, 19, 19,and 21. The almanac’s associated glyphic texts seemto refer to weather events, suggesting the planet’sretrograde motion was somehow connected withweather changes. Thompson (1960 : 258) notes that‘‘there are good grounds for believing that this beastis a symbol of rain or, conceivably, of some planet orconstellation regarded as a sender of rain.’’Harvey and Victoria Bricker (1997) point out thatthe Mars almanac is unique in the sequence of inter-vals expressed, and it is the only one known to addup to 78 days, a close approximation of the averageretrograde period of Mars. The almanac could be re-used with the ten different Tzolkin dates that accom-pany the multiples of 78 days in the table to the leftFIG. 6.1.a:Postclassic Mars table with multiples of 780days representing synodic period of Mars and 78-dayperiods approximating retrograde of Mars; Mars Beastssuspended from sky bands may refer to periods whenMars was moving in retrograde motion while crossingMilky Way (Dresden Codex pages 43b – 45b; modified af-ter H.

Once again the beast issuspended from a sky band, suggesting the retro-grade period coincides with Mars crossing the MilkyWay. A similar configuration appears on DresdenCodex 68a (Fig. 6.1c). It would seem that Marscrossing the Milky Way may bring rainfall.Mars crossing the Milky Way may also be linkedwith Venus events in the Dresden Codex Venuspages. On page 46, a sky band serves as a throne foran aged god wearing a headdress that resembles theMars Beast (Fig. 5.3a). The Mars Beast glyph (T794)names this deity in the first column of the lower sec-tion (T on line 21, Fig. 5.3f ). In light of the sky-bandassociation, it is noteworthy that this page correlateswith 1/19/1221, when the Morning Star rose withMars moving in retrograde motion at the edge of theMilky Way. Mercury was also nearby in the MilkyWay, and perhaps this is why the sky band has anowl head attached.The first of the Mars Beasts on Dresden Codex44b has a star eye that resembles central Mexicanstar symbols, and all of the beasts have a distinctivefret-nosed snout, like the Mars Beast glyph (T794)named in each of the associated glyph columns (Fig.6.1a). The cleft hooves have led to the beast beingvariously identified as a deer, a tapir, or a peccary.Thompson’s (1972 : 57) identification as a deer seemsto be correct. The Mars Beast has volutes emergingfrom its head that could be stylized horns. On Dres-den Codex 44b – 45b, the Mars Beast has the samestyle of cleft hooves and stippled underbody seen onthe deer on Dresden Codex 45c (Fig. 5.9f ). Even theMars Beast on 68a, which seems to have a back andtail like those of an iguana, has the same stippledunderbody (Fig. 6.1c). Like the Mars Beast, deerare often colored white in the Dresden Codex (13c,60b). And, in a similar fashion, deer can appear onsky bands, as seen on Madrid Codex 40c and 47a(Fig. 6.1d). The celestial deer suggests a connectionwith an account in the Chilam Balam of Chumayeldescribing the deer as ‘‘that which hooks the sky’’of the almanac. Justeson (1989 : 81) says that the al-manac of 78 days is re-entered ten times for a totalof forty stations spanning 780 days. In this model,the multiples of 78 could be coordinated with the 19-and 21-day intervals in a variety of ways. He pro-poses that this layout is required in order to ac-commodate the 78-day almanac to the other stationsof the Mars cycle, especially heliacal rise and set,and the two stationary points bracketing retrogrademotion.In analyzing the almanac, Victoria and HarveyBricker (1986b : 59 – 60) suggest that it refers to spe-cific Mars events in the ninth century, a position thatis considered controversial. They maintain that thealmanac begins with 3 Cimi (the last date before thealmanac begins), which falls 78 days after the 3 La-mat base. The 3 Cimi date fell within a historicalretrograde period ina.d.818, but not at the begin-ning of retrograde motion. On the other hand, Jus-teson (1989 : 124 n. 28) says that 3 Cimi is simply thelowest multiple of 78, and he finds the Brickers’ ideathat the pictures refer to a specific 78-day span un-acceptable. In any case, given that the base date isgenerally accepted to be in the ninth century, themultiples of 780 could extend the table into the Post-classic period. The highest multiple (1943780 daysor around 414 years) carries the table forward froma.d.818 toa.d.1232, only a few years after the dateproposed for the Dresden Codex Venus table.The almanac probably focuses on events that hadthe potential of recurring together again. Eclipseglyphs above the third Mars Beast suggest that thealmanac represents a solar eclipse followed by a lu-nar eclipse, both occurring during the retrogrademotion of Mars. The historical retrograde ina.d.818 coincided with a solar eclipse followed fifteendays later by a lunar eclipse, an eclipse pair that oc-curred near the time of the second stationary pointof Mars (V. Bricker and H. Bricker 1986b : 55). Thismay be the historical reference point setting a pat-tern that was to be significant in the future. Indeed,Kelley (1980 :S18 – S19, table V) notes that every al-ternate repetition of the synodic period of Mars willshow a similar pattern of eclipses over a long periodof time.

This hooking action might refer tothe retrograde motion of the deer planet.The Mars Beast glyph (T794) is a fret-nosed ani-mal head resembling the patron of the month Zip(Fig. 6.1f; Kelley 1980 : S30). Among the YucatecMaya of Chan Kom, there is a class of forest spiritscalled ‘‘zip,’’ who are associated with deer hunt-ing (Redfield and Villa Rojas 1962 : 117 –118). Themonth Zip was the principal festival of the huntersin Landa’s time (Tozzer 1941 : 154 –156). The MarsBeast is probably a deer monster related to the pa-tron of the month Zip in Initial Series introductoryglyphs (Thompson 1960, fig. 22). The Zip Monsteris also represented in Classic period sky bands andin glyphic inscriptions as T1021 (Fig. 6.1e).The Mars Beast also appears in Classic Maya cal-endar inscriptions. At Palenque, the Temple of the In-scriptions west panel links Pacal II’s accession to Mars(F9-H3; Lounsbury 1991 : 818 n. 7). Floyd Lounsburynotes that the text refers to Mars (T1021a at G1) be-cause Pacal’s accession on 9.9.2.4.8 5 Lamat 1 Mol (7/24 /615) was timed by the planet’s first stationarypoint (8/4 /615; Meeus n.d.). His accession also coin-cided with Jupiter’s conjunction with the Sun. Otherreferences to Mars appear in the Palenque texts, as inthe Temple of the Sun, where the Mars Beast is pairedwith GIII (D5-D6) in texts referring to the birth ofthe Sun in the distant past, on 1.18.5.3.6 13 Cimi 19Ceh in 2697b.c.The Mars event is part of mytho-logical history, but it would be expected to repeaton 13 Cimi because of the coincidence between onesynodic period of Mars and three Tzolkins.The Mars Beast (T1021a at A10) is named on Lin-tel 2 of Temple IV at Tikal following a 6 Caban date(Pl. 16). This date falls sixty-five days after the ‘‘star-war’’ (at B8) on 7 Ben 1 Pop (2 /2 /744), when Jupiterdeparted from its second stationary point (Louns-bury 1989 : 255). Although Mars was not in retro-grade motion on 6 Caban, it did pass by Jupiter dur-ing the sixty-five-day period. Linda Schele andNikolai Grube (1994, 1995) refer to the Mars Beastas the ‘‘Square-nosed Beastie,’’ proposing that thebeast names the divine founder of Naranjo. As wehave seen, Venus appears as a founder of lineages ata number of sites, and it is possible that Mars plays arole in the lineage of Naranjo.Justeson (1989 : 103, table 8.7) points out that theClassic period Maya inscriptions place special im-portance on a 13-Tun period that equates exactlywith six synodic periods of Mars. Analysis of Classicperiod inscriptions indicates that a high percentageof dates with possible astronomical associations co-incide with a time when Mars was visible in the sky,and usually the planet was in a morning or eveningperiod of visibility (Aveni and Hotaling 1994). Fur-ther study is required to see whether the Mars Beastis somehow connected with these dates.In sum, the Mars table displays sets of 780 daysthat were used to calculate multiples of the synodicperiod of Mars, and it includes a companion alma-nac referring to the period of retrograde motion. The78-day almanac may focus special attention on timeswhen Mars was crossing the Milky Way during ret-rograde motion. Such recurring cycles apparentlywere linked with weather predictions. Multiples inthe table carry the cycle forward from the histori-cal base date in the ninth century to the Early Post-classic period, contemporary with the Venus table.The Postclassic Mars Beast is a deer monster closelyassociated with the planet’s retrograde motion, butnot all images of the beast correspond to times whenthe planet was in retrograde. The patron of themonth Zip associated with hunting seems to be theClassic period counterpart for the Mars Beast, butthe details of the connection are poorly understood.MONKEY DEITIES AND THE PLANETSMonkeys, our almost-human brothers, seem to playan important part in the astronomical tales of theMaya (Chapter 1). Among the Lacando ́ n, the spidermonkey represents the Sun (Bruce 1976 : 77). Onthe other hand, the spider monkey is the youngerbrother of the Sun and Venus and later becomesthe Evening Star, according to a Mopan account(Thompson 1970b : 361). In another Mopan versionof this tale, the youngest brother is a spider monkey(T’up) who becomes Mars or Jupiter (Thompson1930 : 120 –123). This tale apparently represents adifferent tradition from the one recounted in the Po-pol Vuh, which tells how the jealous elder brothersof the Hero Twins were transformed into monkeys.MONKEY DEITIES AND THE PLANETS223"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"224THE CELESTIAL WANDERERS"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Dennis Tedlock (1985 : 353) proposes that thePopol Vuh links Mars with the monkey brothersrepresented by howler monkeys. He notes thatbatzmeans ‘‘howler monkey’’ in Quiche ́ , and HunChouen is ‘‘one artisan,’’ butchouenmeans ‘‘howlermonkey’’ in archaic Yucatec. Michael Coe (1978a :328) says that the monkey brothers are both named1 Howler Monkey, and they are connected with thearts, playing the same role as in central Mexico. Onthe other hand, Thompson (1970b : 360) says thattheir names refer to two different species of mon-keys, with Hun Batz as a howler monkey (batz) andHun Chouen as a spider monkey. He relates HunChouen to the Maya calendar day Chuen, the coun-terpart for Ozomatli in central Mexico, a calendarname referring to a spider monkey (Codex Borgia13). A magnificent Aztec sculpture in the Muse ́e del’Homme in Paris depicts a spider monkey (Ozo-matli?) wearing the shell ornaments of Quetzalcoatland Xolotl, indicating a connection with Venus.The Postclassic God C was originally identified asa simian deity by Paul Schellhas (1904), an identifi-cation reaffirmed by some contemporary scholars(Fig. 6.2c; Kelley 1976; Ringle 1988). Although KarlTaube (1992b : 27) says that God C does not closelyresemble any living creature, one attribute of thegod is a small curled nose most often seen on mon-keys in Maya art (Fig. 6.2j). Several images of God Care bearded, suggesting a representation of the malehowler monkey (Fig. 6.2c, e). An embossed gold andcopper disk recovered in the 1961 dredging of theCenote at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ shows a bearded God Cwearing rayed earrings like those worn by celestialdeities at Tulum (Da ́ valos Hurtado 1961 : 540). Theinscribed dates include a 4 Ahau date that seems torefer to the Katun cycle. On Madrid Codex 50c,God C is seated on a series of Ahau thrones that rep-resent dates marking a sequence of Katun endingsalternating with Lahuntun endings (Fig. 6.2c).God C appears in contexts that suggest he is anastronomical deity. God C’s face is one of the sym-bols found on sky bands in Postclassic images (Fig.6.2a). On Madrid Codex 11c, God C sits on a sky-band throne, indicating a clear astronomical con-nection (Fig. 6.2e). Madrid Codex 53c shows himwalking on a road carrying a merchant pack, perhapsindicating he is traveling in a specific section of thesky associated with a sacred road. On Madrid Codex18a, God B emerges from God C’s open jaws, an in-triguing image that could show celestial conjunction(Fig. 6.2d). Kelley (1976, fig. 35) notes that on Dres-den Codex 68b, God C’s glyph marks Chac’s positionin the tenth heaven. David Kelley and Ann Kerr(1973 : 201) rather tentatively identified God C withSaturn, although this identification is not repeated ina more recent publication (Kelley 1980).God C’s glyphic name has an affix often referredto as the water group, but it may actually representblood (Fig. 6.2b; Taube 1992b : 30 – 31). Based onphonetic readings, God C’s glyph (T1016) is inter-FIG. 6.2.a:God C’s face on Late Postclassic sky band (Ma-drid Codex 35; after Villacorta and Villacorta 1977).b:Postclassic God C’s glyphic name (T1016) with affixthat may represent blood (after Taube 1992b, fig. 10a).c:Postclassic God C seated on 10 Ahau throne holdingmaize symbol (T506) (Madrid Codex 50c; after Taube1992b, fig. 10c).d:Postclassic God B emerges from God C’s open jaws,possibly referring to celestial conjunction (Madrid Codex18a; after Villacorta and Villacorta 1977).e:Postclassic God C shown in sea, on Cauac place sign,and on sky band over path marked with footprints (Ma-drid Codex 11c; after Villacorta and Villacorta 1977).f:Postclassic God C offers maize symbol (T506 or Kan)amid rain falling from eclipse glyphs suspended fromsky band (Dresden Codex 68a; after Villacorta and Villa-corta 1977).g:Classic glyph G1 of ‘‘nine lords of night’’ incorpo-rates God C’s face and number nine (after Aveni 1980,fig. 58).h:Early Classic God C glyph with sky glyph (T561) onbrow (Tikal Stela 31; after Taube 1992b, fig. 11c).i:Simian glyph with star infix and mirror representingmonkey star or planet (after Kelley and Kerr 1973 : 198).j:Classic spider-monkey face similar to that of God C(after Robicsek and Hales 1981, vessel 48).k–l:Classic monkey gods wear ‘‘rolled-napkin’’ head-dresses like aged God N; one monkey paints codex, an-other (male howler monkey?) holds up mirror as hedances (after Miller and Taube 1993 : 135, 138).MONKEY DEITIES AND THE PLANETS225"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"God C, for both are characterized by a vertical bandinset with beaded elements (Fig. 6.2h). In my opin-ion, these simian creatures are not the Sun God, butthey may be a planet representing a ‘‘false sun’’ thatappears at sunset, the time when the monkey’s sunshines, according to contemporary Maya accounts.On the central panel in the Temple of the Sun atPalenque, a basal band depicts Caban (earth) sym-bols alternating with a jawless simian face with amirror brow, crossed eyes, and a monkey-curl nose(Fig. 3.6b). The earth band seems to represent thehorizon, and the simian face may represent a planetassociated with the horizon and sunrise or sunset.As noted in Chapter 3, Kin variants representmonkeys of different species. These may refer to acount of days begun at dawn or at dusk, with howlermonkeys used for counts beginning at dawn and spi-der monkeys for those beginning at dusk.A Classic period vase painting shows a simian facealternating with the Kin glyph in a sky band. Al-though John Carlson (1988 : 288, fig. 9.11) interpretsthe simian face as the sun, the fact that the face alter-nates with a Kin glyph suggests that it is somethingother than the sun.A dusk configuration is suggested by a goggle-eyed spider monkey with an Akbal infix, represent-ing the time or place of sunset on the Pomona Flare(Fig. 3.2c; Hammond 1987 : 22). Clearly, the creatureis something other than the sun. This monkey maybe a planet representing a sort of false sun. Perhapsthe planet takes the place of the sun after sunset.One of the Tikal bones (MT38a) from Burial 116depicts the spider monkey as a passenger in a canoeconveyed by the Paddler Twins, who represent thesun and the moon (Fig. 4.3a). If they are guiding thecanoe through waters that lead to the underworld, asunset configuration is suggested.Whereas spider monkeys can be linked with sunsetimagery, a howler monkey clearly is associated withdawn in the Dresden Codex Venus pages (Fig. 5.3c;Chapter 5). This connection with dawn may comefrom the fact that the howler’s cries announce the ris-ing sun, just as the Morning Star precedes sunrise.The Dresden Codex howler has the same deerlikeear seen on some Classic period monkey artists(Coe 1978a : 345). Other monkey artists wear ‘‘rolled-preted as the wordkuorch’u,implying that his namesignifies something divine or holy (Houston andStuart 1996; Ringle 1988). Because of this glyphicreading, Taube (1992b : 31) maintains that God C isactually not a deity, but rather an embodiment ofgodliness. Nonetheless, his conclusion can be ques-tioned, because God C is represented sitting on a skyband and moving through geographical locations,like other astronomical gods. He even offers a Kansymbol symbolizing maize, an action repeated byother astronomical gods (Fig. 6.2f ).Classic period images also suggest God C’s astro-nomical connection. God C appears in Glyph X ofthe Lunar Series (Fig. 4.1k). On the eaves of HouseC at Palenque, the simian God C and God K arenamed in an important passage that seems to referto four planets, according to Schele (1992b : 185).Glyph G1 of the Nine Lords of the Night depictsGod C’s face in a hand with the number nine as anaffix (Fig. 6.2g). Taube (1992b, fig. 11c) notes thatGod C’s glyph has a sky-glyph infix on Tikal Stela 31(Fig. 6.2h). A God C glyph compound accompaniessigns referring to the Sun, the Moon, and Venus indirectional imagery of Rı ́o Azul Tomb 12 (Fig. 3.2b).Kelley and Kerr (1973 : 198) link a simian face with astar-glyph infix to God C (Fig. 6.2i). Although thisglyph differs from God C in some significant details,it certainly refers to a monkey star or planet.The Temple of the Foliated Cross at Palenque de-picts a maize plant crowned by a bearded monkeywith a mirror brow, an image interpreted as God Cin the role of the monkey sun or the Sun God him-self (Pl. 11; Coggins 1988a :139; Robertson 1991 : 51;Schele 1976). The face has rectangular eyes withcrossed pupils and aT-shaped tooth, like the SunGod, but this tooth form is also seen on Classic pe-riod images of God C (Taube 1992b, fig. 11b). Thefigure has a simian nose and a ruff of fur like a spidermonkey, but its beard evokes a link with howlermonkeys. A similar face with a ‘‘monkey-curl’’ nose,located at the base of the tree on Pacal’s SarcophagusLid, has been identified as the God C aspect of theSun God with a mirror brow (Pl. 10; Stuart 1988 :201). The mirror brows on these two Late ClassicPalenque images seem to be related to the sky glyphon the brow of an Early Classic representation of226THE CELESTIAL WANDERERS"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"napkin’’ style headdresses, like the aged God N(Fig. 6.2k; Reents-Budet 1994 :41– 46, figs. 2.5, 2.15,2.22a – b). The characteristic beard of a male howlermonkey is evident on a number of these monkeys, in-cluding a dancing monkey looking at his reflection ina mirror (Fig. 6.2l). Classic period howler-monkeyartists sometimes appear in pairs (Figs. 3.9e, 6.2k).These allude to a connection with two brothers trans-formed into howler monkeys in the Popol Vuh.The monkey artists belong to a larger complex ofartist gods named in texts asits’at,meaning ‘‘artist,sage, man of letters,’’ an epithet also used to nameGod D and the Paddlers (Reents-Budet 1994 : 49).The role of the astronomer who studies and recordsthe motions of the heavens certainly was linkedwith the sage and ‘‘man of letters.’’ Indeed, theplanetary gods may reveal the key to understandingplanetary cycles recorded in the codices.We can conclude that there was probably morethan one monkey planet in Maya cosmology. Thehowler-monkey aspect of the Morning Star is wellknown. Tedlock suggests that the howler monkey inthe Popol Vuh plays the role of Mars. The spidermonkey may also be linked with a planet, perhapsone observed at sunset. God C is a simian characterwhose astronomical nature is not yet understood.Clearly more research is required to sort out themonkey planets.GOD K IN THE COLONIALAND POSTCLASSIC PERIODSGod K can be identified as the sky god called BolonDzacab in Colonial period sources. This identifica-tion, first proposed by Eduard Seler (1960 –1961, 1 :376 – 477) at the turn of the century, is now widelyaccepted (Taube 1992b : 73). Thompson (1970 : 281)notes that a passage from the Chilam Balam ofChumayel describes Bolon Dzacab taking the seedsof edible plants to the thirteenth layer of heaven atthe time of the great flood. The Motul dictionaryglosses Bolon Dzacab as ‘‘perpetual thing,’’ meaning‘‘eternal’’; however, Thompson (1972 : 90) translatesGod K’s name as ‘‘nine generations.’’ Thompson(1970b : 227, 280) proposes that this name may havesomething to do with the nine lords of the under-world who ruled over a repeating sequence of ninenights. When combined with other calendar cycles,the nine lords may refer to a long interval of time,such as those used in astronomical calculations in-volving the planets.Landa described Bolon Zacab (Bolon Dzacab) asa god worshiped at New Year ceremonies performedannually in the month of July. His counterpart,God K, is involved in some way with the new year.God K may be linked with the year as a representa-tive of Jupiter because the planet is visible in the skyfor about one year (mean interval 367 days) duringeach synodic period.God K is prominent in ceremonies associatedwith years named Ben and Etz’nab in the DresdenCodex New Year ceremonies. God K is linked with acolumn of Ben glyphs marking the year-bearer as-sociated with the eastern direction on Dresden Co-dex 25b (Fig. 6.3f; Thompson 1972 : 90 – 93). His po-sition in the middle register shows that he presidesover ceremonies to avert calamity on the first day ofPop, the month beginning the year (Chapter 3). As-sociated glyphs say that cacao is God K’s food. Cacao,the chocolate bean, was the principal currency forMesoamerica, hence God K is a deity associated withgreat wealth. This is probably why God K is sur-rounded by cacao pods on a capstone from Chiche ́nItza ́ dating to the Terminal Classic period (Fig. 6.3g).On page 26c of the Dresden Codex, in the yearsnamed Etz’nab, God K offers a beheaded turkey anddrops of liquid that are probably turkey blood (Fig.6.3c). An associated inscription with the numbernine recalls God K’s association withbolon,meaning‘‘nine.’’ God K’s position in the lower register indi-cates that he presides over renewal ceremonies per-formed during the month of Pop (Chapter 3).God K’s celestial nature is evident in many Mayaimages. Taube (1992b : 69) notes that a winged GodK is found in a number of contexts that suggest anassociation with the sky. A Postclassic mural paintingat Tulum, dating aftera.d.1400, depicts a sky bandwith a winged God K (Fig. 6.3b). A similar associa-tion is seen in a winged God K with a sky band arch-ing overhead on a painted capstone from the Templeof the Owls at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ (Fig. 6.3g).Looking at the alphabetical list of gods, originallyGOD K IN THE COLONIAL AND POSTCLASSIC PERIODS227"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"developed by Paul Schellhas (1904) and recently re-vised by Taube (1992b), suggests that God K isnamed as one of nineteen or twenty different deitiesin the Postclassic codices. The Dresden Codex Venuspages also list twenty gods, among which we find theSun, the Moon, and God K (Kelley 1976, fig. 28).This number evokes the twenty day patrons in thePrecolumbian codices of central Mexico, which in-clude gods of the Sun and the Moon as well as Tez-catlipoca, who most likely is a counterpart of God K(Codex Borgia 9 –13).In Postclassic images, God K is characterized by along snout with branching elements, sometimes in-set with a mirror, as on Dresden Codex page 12a(Fig. 6.3e). God K’s portrait head glyph also has anelongated snout with a smoking mirror (Fig. 6.3d).The mirror itself may be an astronomical image, formirrors are prominent in expressions referring toVenus positions in the Dresden Codex Venus pages(46 –50).Page 46 of the Dresden Codex Venus table showsGod K as a victim of the Morning Star god at heliacalrise (Fig. 5.3a; Thompson 1972 : 66 – 67). Study ofthe Venus pages indicates that Venus spearing a vic-tim symbolizes opposition rather than conjunction(Chapter 5; Milbrath 1995c). For this reason, theVenus god kills his victims with an atlatl — a long-distance projectile weapon. On 1/19/1221 (5 Kan7 Xul), the date recording the heliacal rise on page46, Jupiter and the emerging Morning Star were atthe opposite sides of the sky. This date also coincideswith the retrograde period of Jupiter.

Tezcatlipocais a god with so many astronomical aspects and as-sociations that he may be the lord of the sky in somesense. One of Tezcatlipoca’s aspects is the lunar jag-uar known as Tepeyollotl (Milbrath 1995a). HenryNicholson (1971 : 412, 426) points out that Tezcatli-poca is also fused with the lunar god Metztli. Amonghis multiple aspects, we also find one linked with Ve-nus as Mixcoatl and another with the solar god Huit-zilopochtli. Nicholson notes that one early accountrefers to him as ‘‘another Jupiter.’’ Others say he wastransformed into Ursa Major at the end of the firstworld age. Among Tezcatlipoca’s many guises, theblack Tezcatlipoca seems to be closest to God K. Theblack Tezcatlipoca, linked with the southern direc-tion, is the victim of the Morning Star on CodexBorgia 54 (Seler 1963, 2 : 121). And it seems signifi-cant that the Venus pages of the Dresden Codexname God K as a victim of the Morning Star, alsoassociating him with the southern direction (Kelly1976, fig. 28).Tezcatlipoca and God K both share an associationwith mirrors and serpents. Tezcatlipoca has a smok-ing mirror on his head and a serpent foot in a Colo-nial period Aztec codex known as the Codex Rı ́os(Codex Vaticanus A, folios 3v, 44v). Although a ser-pent foot is not common in Late Postclassic images ofGod K, he apparently retains an ophidian aspect inthe Madrid Codex (31b). At Chiche ́ n Itza ́ , TerminalClassic and Early Postclassic reliefs depict gods withsevered legs or one leg terminating in a serpent thatseems to be related to both Tezcatlipoca and God K(Morris et al. 1931, 2, pl. 31; Robertson and Andrews1992, fig. 21; Tozzer 1957, fig. 138). A Terminal Clas-sic relief of God K at Sayil has both the serpent legand the smoking mirror of Tezcatlipoca (Fig. 6.3h).These traits seem to appear earlier in the Maya areathan in central Mexico, indicating that some aspectsof the cult first developed among the Maya.Taube (1992b : 73, 78) points to links betweenGod K and God B, the Postclassic Chac, suggestingthat the two share traits and even substitute for oneanother. Jeff Kowalski (1990 : 63) notes that God Kmay also be a rain and storm deity like Chac, andsee, Classic period monuments representing God Kbear dates that correlate with Jupiter’s position inretrograde.In Late Postclassic murals of Mound 1 at Santa Ritain Belize, God K is bound like a prisoner or a victimdestined for sacrifice, a role similar to that of God K inthe Venus pages (Fig. 6.3a). The murals display Mayadates in a sequence that links God K with 1 Ahau(Thompson 1960 : 198). This is especially interestingin light of a pattern linking Jupiter events to Classicperiod Katuns ending in 1 Ahau (Thompson 1960 :228). Owing to the structure of the Katun cycle, eachof the 13 Katuns is associated with a different Ahaudate. The whole Katun series represents approxi-mately 256.25 years (133203360 days).God K plays a prominent role in Katun ceremo-nies in the Paris Codex (2 –12). His head, presentedto different Katun lords seated on sky-band thrones,is the insignia of the Lord of the Katun (Love 1994 :17). Carrying God K’s head to the new ruler in theKatun ceremonies may allude to a change in politicalor religious authority, recalling Classic period acces-sion scenes and dynastic rites involving the presen-tation of God K (Hellmuth 1987 : 372, fig. 662 – 664;Taube 1987).Each Katun lord ruled a period of 19.71 years(203360 days), very close to the interval betweensuccessive Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions. The con-junction of Jupiter and Saturn approximately every20 years cannot be expected to align with a specificdate in the Katun cycle over long periods of time, butthose instances when there was a conjunction at aKatun ending certainly would have been notable be-cause the event would repeat at the next Katun end.In the conjunctions between Jupiter and Saturn, Ju-piter is the dynamic actor in the scenario, runninglaps around the slower-moving Saturn. The God Khead carried to the enthroned Katun lord in the ParisCodex may symbolize Jupiter transported across thesky to a new encounter with Saturn. The interval ofthe Katun approximates the period between succes-sive conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn; and everythree Katuns (approximately every 59 years) the con-junction event would be expected to occur in thesame part of the sky (Kelley 1985 : 238).Many scholars conclude that God K is related to230THE CELESTIAL WANDERERS"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"he recognizes possible representations of God K incorner masks of the Great Pyramid at Uxmal dat-ing to the Late Classic period. Perhaps Tlaloc is alsoinvolved in the equation, for a rare image from Co-pa ́ n shows Tlaloc with a smoking-mirror headdress(Taube 1992b, fig. 72a). Nevertheless, such confla-tion of deity traits does not mean direct equation.God K and Chac / Tlaloc may share general traits asplanetary gods, but they may be conflated in specificcontexts to indicate they are planets seen together inconjunction.We can conclude that Colonial and Postclassicdata suggest a possible relationship between God Kand Jupiter. In the Postclassic Katun cycle, God Kmay represent Jupiter moving around the sky tomeet Saturn at intervals of approximately twentyyears, the length of one Katun. God K’s role in theNew Year ceremonies of the annual cycle may relateto Jupiter’s year-long period of visibility each syn-odic period. God K seems to be the counterpart ofthe black Tezcatlipoca, a central Mexican god who issimilarly associated with a smoking mirror and ser-pent traits.THE CLASSIC PERIOD GOD K AND GIIThere is clear continuity tracing the imagery of GodK back through time, but there are stylistic modifi-cations, the most notable of which is that the smok-ing mirror changes position between the Postclassicand Classic periods (Fig. 6.3h – u). In the Classic pe-riod, God K carries a mirror on his brow rather thanon his snout. Sometimes a smoking torch emanatesfrom the mirror, its smoke resembling cigar smoke orthe smoke from fires (Fig. 6.3h – k). In other images,a smoking celt bearing markings similar to the skyglyph emanates from God K’s mirror (Fig. 6.3q – r).God K’s nocturnal nature is evident in images fromthe Palenque Palace that show the mirror-browedGod K wearing a star (Fig. 6.3r, s). One of the ear-liest known images of God K has a smoking sky celtemerging from a nocturnal mirror with Akbal mark-ings (Fig. 6.3u). Here on Tikal Stela 31, God K mayhave simian traits, with monkey paws and a monkey-curl nose over an elongated upper lip.God K’s Classic period glyph is the head of God Kwith a mirrored brow, or sometimes a smoking mir-ror by itself can name God K (Fig. 6.3m; Taube 1992b,fig. 32c). A number of glyphs show God K’s nameassociated with the number nine, providing a linkwith the Colonial period Bolon Dzacab (Thompson1970b, fig. 7). Schele (1984 : 304) first recognized that‘‘God K’s mirror-in-hand’’ (T1030d : 670) is a glyphcompound usually denoting the presentation of GodK at the time of an heir designation at Palenque. Thisis just one of many Classic Maya contexts that indi-cate God K was important as a god of lineage andrulership.Thompson (1970b : 226, 289) emphasizes God K’sassociation with vegetation, and he proposes that theColonial period God K was known as Kauil, mean-ing ‘‘surplus of our daily bread [maize].’’ David Stu-art’s (1987 : 15) phonetic reading of God K’s name ask’awil(kauil) provides support for linking God Kwith maize (Taube 1992b : 78). Copa ́ n Stela 11 de-picts the ruler Yax Pac in the guise of God K withmaize foliation on his brow, suggesting an aspect ofGod K that may be linked withk’awil(Fash 1991,fig. 108). Nonetheless, more recent interpretations ofk’awilsuggest that the term refers to stone sculp-tures, flint, and stone axeheads associated with light-ning (Freidel et al. 1994 : 194 – 200). K’awil’s name isalso linked with serpents. Schele (1992b :120) notesthat on Copa ́ n Stela 11, an 819-day passage refers tothe serpent foot as God K’sway,or alter ego.Although K’awil is now more commonly used intranslating God K’s name, it should be noted that hisname has also been read as Tahil, based on linguisticconnections with the word for obsidian (tahortoh),suggesting a connection with Tohil, the Quiche ́ godof lightning and storms (Taube 1992b : 75 –76; Ted-lock 1985 : 365). Tohil was lord of a Quiche ́ lineageat the time of the conquest. Indeed, God K is simi-larly connected with lineage and lightning. As Taubepoints out, God K’s headdress elements — mirrors,fire, burning axes, torches, and cigars — all may al-lude to lightning. In my opinion, God K is a planetlinked with meteorological phenomena, especiallystorms and lightning.God K appears as GII of the Palenque Triadin mythological texts recording the birth of threebrothers. The Cross Group records GII’s birth dateTHE CLASSIC PERIOD GOD K AND GII231"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"pears on a sky glyph as Stormy Sky’s personal nameworn as a costume accessory (Coggins 1990 : 84).On Maya lintels and stelae, God K frequently ap-pears in the jaws of a double-headed serpent thatMaya rulers used as a royal insignia (Cohodas 1982 :113; Stuart 1984 : 19). On architectural reliefs fromPalenque, God K’s head emerges from the jaws ofa double-headed serpent flanking the portrait of aruler (Fig. 6.3t). Whereas God K’s serpent foot oftenseems to represent a naturalistic snake, the double-headed serpent with an upturned bulbous noseseems to be linked with the front head of the CosmicMonster discussed in Chapter 7.Ceramic vessels depict God K with other astro-nomical deities. God K appears with the Moon God-dess in scenes featuring a large snake (Fig. 4.10h).Typically, God N emerges from the serpent’s mouth,the serpent’s body wraps around the Moon God-dess, and the tail carries God K. Occasionally thesnake is represented as an extension of God K’s leg,like God K’s serpent foot on the lintel from Sayil(Fig. 6.3h). A number of relief-carved pottery vesselsshow God K in a specific relationship with God L,a god of the Morning Star in the Dresden Codex(Chapter 5). God L wears God K on his cape onsome relief vessels (Robicsek 1978 : 173, figs. 188 –189). Another vessel depicts God L offering the headof God K (Coe 1973 : 116, no. 56). Small bottles rep-resent God K seated facing God L with an offeringbetween them (Robicsek 1978, fig. 210, pl. 238).God K has multiple aspects most clearly seen inceramic representations. A painted pot depicts twoaspects of God K, one with the smoking-mirrorheaddress, the other with a flower positioned on hisbrow (Coe 1982 : 47, no. 19). Another pot shows afigure holding a glyph compound referring to BolonDzacab and another figure holding a head of God Kwith a smoking mirror (Coe 1982 : 118, no. 62).God K is even shown as quadripartite in some rep-resentations (Coe 1982 : 54).We can conclude that the Classic period repre-sentations of God K connect him with lineage, rul-ership, lightning, and thunder. His imagery ofteninvolves celestial associations, including sky mon-sters, sky glyphs, and stars. His mirror may also be acelestial symbol. He appears in scenes with theas 1.18.5.4.0 1 Ahau 13 Mac (2697b.c.).GII glyphsare like those naming God K, but they show the fullfigure in a reclining posture (Fig. 6.3n). HeinrichBerlin (1963 : 93) named this god GII because he isthe second one listed in texts that name all threebrothers of the Triad; however, his mythic birthdaymakes him the youngest of the brothers in the Triad(Schele 1976 : 10). In a modern Mopan tale, Mars orJupiter takes the role of the youngest brother, T’up,transformed into a spider monkey (Chapter 1).Dennis Tedlock (1992 : 250 – 258, 266 – 267) pro-poses that Mars is closely linked with GII in the Triadand Hun Hunahpu in the Popol Vuh. He recon-structs Hun Hunahpu’s birthday as 8.5.0 before thecurrent Maya epoch, concluding that this god sharesGII’s 1 Ahau birthday, a date he associates with theheliacal rise of Mars, although he provides no con-vincing evidence of this association. Tedlock notesthat the birth dates of both gods give intervals thatare evenly divisible by 780, the mean synodic periodof Mars. He also finds a link between Vucub Hu-nahpu and Jupiter, but here his evidence for thatconnection is even more tenuous. Furthermore, itshould be pointed out that these interpretations con-tradict his earlier identification of a falcon characteras Jupiter and the monkey brothers as Mars (Tedlock1985). As will be seen, the pattern of Classic perioddates provides strong evidence linking GII /God Kwith Jupiter. Furthermore, God K is specificallynamed in a cycle known to refer to Jupiter.God K is featured prominently in an 819-day cycleassociated with a high incidence of Jupiter and Sat-urn events in the Classic period inscriptions (Juste-son 1989 : 103). The 819-day phrases often nameGod K in the fifth position (Kelley 1976 : 57 –58,fig. 17). A companion glyph (T739) in the fourth po-sition is also used as Glyph Y of the SupplementarySeries, where it is governed by a 7-day cycle that maybe a ‘‘planetary week’’ (Yasugi and Saito 1991).There is a clear link between God K and rulership.It is interesting to note that a number of Maya rulersincorporate God K in their personal names or titles.God K is seen in the headdress of Stormy Sky (K’awilChaan) on Tikal Stela 31, a fifth-century monumentthat records his accession to the throne (Figs. 3.7b,6.3u; A. Miller 1986 : 54, 82). Here God K’s torso ap-232THE CELESTIAL WANDERERS"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Moon Goddess and the Morning Star, images thatmay show celestial conjunction. He also is part of the819-day inscriptions that seem to relate to Jupiterand Saturn events, pointing to a likely associationwith one of these two planets. As we will see, there isa consistent association between God K and Jupiterevents in the Classic period inscriptions.JUPITER EVENTS AND GOD KON CLASSIC MAYA MONUMENTSLate Classic monuments with God K images oftenbear dates that coincide with Jupiter’s retrogrademotion. When Jupiter is not in a significant position,a Saturn event may be substituted. Often the datesare associated with dynastic rituals or rituals relat-ing to Katun events. As noted above, the Katun cycleitself reflects the pattern of intervals between suc-cessive conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn.At Naj Tunich, a God K portrait glyph appearswith the date 13 Ahau, referring to the Katun end-ing 9.17.0.0.0 13 Ahau 18 Cumku (1/18/771; Stone1995b : 142, fig. 6.27). This is especially intriguingbecause God K’s head is represented in the Katun-ending ceremonies of the Postclassic. The 13 Ahaudate falls less than three weeks after the first station-ary point of Jupiter (1/1/771; Meeus n.d.). Saturnwas also in retrograde motion then. As we will see,such correlations led the Maya to focus on observa-tions of these two planets at the Katun end for hun-dreds of years.By studying a pattern of dates in the life of ChanBahlum II, Lounsbury (1989, table 19.1) correlatesPalenque monuments with Jupiter’s retrograde, al-though he does not identify specific imagery that re-fers to Jupiter. At six years of age, the young rulerwas designated as heir to the throne on 9 Akbal 6 Xul(9.10.8.9.3; 6 /12 /641), a date that correlates with Ju-piter’s departure from its second stationary pointand Saturn’s approach to its first stationary point(Lounsbury 1989, table 19.1; Meeus n.d.). Somethirty years later, the ruler began his reign under thepatronage of Jupiter. At the time of Chan Bahlum’saccession on 8 Oc 3 Kayab (1/5/684), Jupiter had justpassed its second stationary point and was crossingthe meridian at dusk (second stationary point on 12 /23/683; Meeus n.d.). Both his heir designation andaccession were timed by Jupiter’s departure from thesecond stationary point (Lounsbury 1989).The small figure on the central panels of templesin the Cross Group, previously interpreted as Pacal(Schele 1976 : 13 –14), is now recognized as ChanBahlum at six or seven years of age when he wasdesignated heir to the throne (Robertson 1991 : 20).The date of the heir-designation event is positionednear the young Chan Bahlum, whereas the accessionevent is linked with the taller figure representingChan Bahlum as an adult. All three temples show dif-ferent aspects of God K, indicating there may be atleast three manifestations of God K at Palenque. Inthe Temple of the Sun, Chan Bahlum holds a God Kmanikin with a smoking brow at the time of his acces-sion (Fig. 3.6b). The Temple of the Cross depicts theyoung Chan Bahlum standing on a skeletal head withan elongated snout and the number nine (bolon), al-luding to the Bolon Dzacab aspect of God K (Pl. 12;compare Thompson 1970b, figs. 9p – q). This imageis captioned by the heir-designation event above thesmaller figure of Chan Bahlum. The Temple of theFoliated Cross depicts God K emerging from a spiralshell with a maize plant in hand (Pl. 11; Du ̈ tting1984 : 23; Robicsek 1979 : 115; Stuart 1978 : 167). Theyoung Chan Bahlum stands on God K’s shell, indi-cating a direct link with the maize aspect of God K.Temple XIV at Palenque shows that after hisdeath, Chan Bahlum continued his relationship withGod K and the planet Jupiter (Pl. 13). The text openson the left with a 9 Ik 10 Mol date, followed by astatement that God K was displayed under the aus-pices of the Moon Goddess; then the date is repeatedon the right after an interval of almost 100,000 years(Schele and Miller 1986 : 272, fig. VII.2). The displayof God K is mentioned again, followed by a refer-ence to 9 Ahau 3 Kankin (9.13.13.15.0; 10/31/705),a date that falls about three years and nine monthsafter the death date (33365 days1260 days).Lounsbury (1989 : 250, fig. 19.5) links this posthu-mous date with Jupiter’s departure from its secondstationary point (second stationary point on 10/21/705; Meeus n.d.). Saturn was in retrograde, and theMoon passed Jupiter a few hours before dusk. Thelunar event is especially significant because ChanJUPITER EVENTS AND GOD K233"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"the full Moon on that night (full Moon 4 /31/820;Goldstine 1973).On Bonampak Stela 1, God K appears on theheaddress of an ancestor figure emerging from a cleftin a Cauac (Witz) monster on the base of a monu-ment that marks the first Lahuntun ending of ChaanMuan’s reign, recorded in a fragmentary Initial Seriesdate of 9.17.10.0.0 (11/26 /780; Mathews 1980 : 64,fig. 3; Proskouriakoff 1993 : 163 –164). At this time,Jupiter had been in retrograde motion for threeweeks (first stationary point on 11/5/780; Meeusn.d.). Jupiter, visible high above the eastern horizonat dawn, was especially brilliant because it was pre-cisely in conjunction with Uranus, a planet that wasbright enough at this time to be seen with the nakedeye. Meanwhile, Saturn was invisible in conjunctionwith the Sun.Lintel 4 from Bonampak Structure 6 depicts aruler holding a double-headed God K serpent bar(Schele and Grube 1994 : 109, fig. 180). Both im-ages of God K have mirrored brows with axe inserts,and one has Akbal markings on the mirror, sug-gesting an opposition of light and dark. The onlysurviving date on the monument, 7 Chuen 4 Zotz(9.8.9.15.11; 5/11/603), does not correspond to Ju-piter’s retrograde, but Saturn was in retrograde mo-tion. Saturn may also be significant in the imagery ofGod K, probably because God K encodes the rela-tionship between Jupiter and Saturn in his role as aKatun god.Bahlum’s deceased mother is compared to the MoonGoddess in the texts. Apparently Lady Ahpo Heltakes the role of the Moon on the panel, for sheholds the God K manikin, just as the Moon holdsJupiter in conjunction.The most important image of apotheosis involv-ing Jupiter is seen on the Sarcophagus Lid of theTemple of the Inscriptions at Palenque, a pyramidthat houses the tomb of Chan Bahlum’s father, Pacal(Fig. 6.3p; Pl. 10). God K and the Jester God emergefrom either end of a bicephalic serpent bar, and Pa-cal appears in the guise of God K at the base of acosmic tree (Schele 1976 : 17; Robertson 1991 : 18).This scene has an astronomical context, for Pacal issurrounded by a sky band. On the edge of the lid,his death or some other event related to his death isrecorded on the Calendar Round 6 Etz’nab 11 Yax(9.12.11.5.18; 8/26 /683). David Stuart has deci-phered the event glyph as ‘‘he entered the road’’ (ochbih;Mathews 1991 : 161; Schele 1992b:133). Hein-rich Berlin (1977 : 137) notes that this event (T100 :585) refers to the end of a reign, and it may signaldeath or apotheosis. This expression probably refersto Pacal’s apotheosis rather than his death. Coggins(1988b : 74 –75) suggests that Pacal is shown dancingout of his tomb on the Sarcophagus Lid, suggest-ing an image of apotheosis. The apotheosis date isonly two days short of Jupiter’s first stationary point(8/28/683; Meeus n.d.). It is noteworthy that Pacal’sson, Chan Bahlum, was not inaugurated as the newruler until Jupiter had begun to move forward again,four months later.Jupiter also appears to be involved with the post-humous portrait of Yax Pac of Copa ́ n. On Stela 11,Yax Pac appears in a guise of God K, one of only twoknown portraits of a deceased ruler in this guise(Fash 1991 : 177, fig. 108). Like Pacal’s image of apo-theosis as God K, the Copa ́ n monument is also as-sociated with the retrograde period of Jupiter. Thestela bears the date 8 Ahau, inferred to be that of theLahuntun ending on 9.19.10.0.0 8 Ahau 8 Xul, mark-ing the halfway point of the Katun cycle. On this date(4 /30/820), Jupiter was on the eastern horizon atdusk, approximately at the midpoint of its retro-grade motion (from 2 /18/820 to 6 /21/820; Meeusn.d.). Furthermore, Jupiter was in conjunction with234THE CELESTIAL WANDERERSDos Pilas Stela 14 shows a ruler displaying a God Kmanikin scepter (formerly Stela 25; Houston 1993,tables 3-1, 4-1; fig. 3-24). Two passages have a glyphcompound mentioning God K (F2, H4). The stela hasan Initial Series date of 9.14.0.0.0 6 Ahau 13 Muan(11/29/711) and a Calendar Round of 8 Ix 2 Cumku(9.14.5.3.14; 1/15/717) associated with a ‘‘shell star’’compound. As noted in Chapters 4 and 5, the InitialSeries date corresponds to the full Moon. It alsomarks a time when the Evening Star was about toreemerge. Neither date correlates with Jupiter’s ret-rograde, but the Katun-ending date marks a timewhen Jupiter was overhead at dawn and it coincidesprecisely with Saturn’s first stationary point (11/29/711). The second date also approximates Saturn’sfirst stationary point (1/29/717; Meeus n.d.).

Another date (9.14.9.10.131 Ben 16 Tzec; 5/13/721) coincides with Saturn’s ret-rograde motion.Dates on some Dos Pilas monuments depictingGod K cannot be related to the retrograde of eitherJupiter or Saturn, but they do record subdivisionsof the Katun that could be related to observations ofJupiter and Saturn. Among such examples, we findDos Pilas Stela 11 (formerly Stela 22) depicting thedisplay of the God K scepter on a Calendar Rounddate of 12 Ahau 8 Kankin (9.14.5.0.0; 11/2 /716;Houston 1993, table 3-1; fig. 3-27).Monuments from Yaxchila ́ n clearly link God Kand Jupiter events. On Stela 1, God K emerges fromopen jaws of a double-headed serpent representedwith a sky-band body and deer attributes (Fig. 3.8d).The Initial Series date on the monument is 9.16.10.0.01 Ahau 3 Zip (3/11/761; Proskouriakoff 1993 : 112).This date coincides with the new Moon falling abouttwo weeks after Jupiter’s first stationary point (2 /27/761; Meeus n.d.). A fragmentary Calendar Rounddate, reconstructed as 1 Oc 18 Pop (9.16.8.16.10;2 /14 /760), records an 819-day event that is also alittle over two weeks after Jupiter’s first stationarypoint (1/27/760; Meeus n.d.). The two dates may bepurposefully paired to show Jupiter’s retrograde intwo sequential synodic cycles.Yaxchila ́ n Lintel 30 names God K in an 819-dayevent on 1 Ben 1 Chen (9.13.16.10.13; 7/20/708), adate reached by counting back 397 days from thebirth of Bird Jaguar IV recorded on 8 Oc 13 Yax(8/21/709; 9.13.17.12.10; Tate 1992, apps. 2 – 3, fig.57). Although neither date pertains to the period ofJupiter’s retrograde, the distance number is a closeapproximation of the synodic period of Jupiter(398.9 days). The 819-day event on 1 Ben 1 Chenrefers to the east and red before mentioning God Kat A5. At this time, Jupiter and Saturn were inGemini in the east at dawn, and the waning Moonwas in conjunction with Saturn above the easternhorizon, while Venus was on the eastern horizon inCancer, about to disappear as the Morning Star. Onesynodic period later, Jupiter was once again in theeast at dawn at the time of Bird Jaguar’s birth ina.d.709. Now Mars was approximately at the midpointof its retrograde motion, above the eastern horizonin Leo (second stationary point on 9/10/709; Meeusn.d.). At this time, Jupiter and Saturn were preciselyin conjunction in Cancer, and Venus was only a fewdegrees away, now also in Cancer. This massing ofthree planets above the eastern horizon at dawn mayhave been considered an auspicious omen for theruler’s birth, and the count backward could relate toa symmetry seen in the previous synodic period withanother celestial triad formed by Jupiter, Saturn, andthe Moon in Gemini at dawn.A ruler holding the God K manikin appears onthe back of Stela 11 with a 1 Imix 19 Xul date(9.15.19.1.1; 5/29/750) that falls at the midpoint ofJupiter’s period of retrograde motion (Tate 1992,fig. 136). Another date (9 Ahau 18 Xul), exactly fouryears earlier, is positioned in a like fashion just abovethe ruler on the other side of the stela; this date co-incides with the time that the Moon passed by asJupiter and Mars were precisely in conjunction. Onboth dates Saturn was in retrograde motion.Surveying all the dated Yaxchila ́ n monumentsprovides a test for the link between God K imageryand Jupiter events. At Yaxchila ́ n, eight of the fifteenmonuments (53%) that have God K images and leg-ible dates refer to events that coincide with Jupiter’sretrograde, allowing a seven-day window on eitherside of retrograde (Table 6.1). This percentage seemssignificant in terms of statistical analysis, becauseeven allowing a generous thirty-day window on ei-ther end of the period, Jupiter’s mean retrograderepresents 45 percent of the planet’s synodic period(Aveni and Hotaling 1994 : S40). And calculating thepercentage of Jupiter’s mean period of retrograde us-ing a seven-day window indicates it is only 33 per-cent of its synodic period (1201717 or 134 daysout of 399 days total).

Lintels 32 and 53 re-cord a Calendar Round date of 6 Ben 16 Mac(9.13.17.15.13; 10/23/709) that Carolyn Tate (1992,app. 2) correlates with the position of Saturn andJupiter aligned together at stationary points. The factthat Jupiter and Saturn were close together (within27) is certainly significant. This date is less thanthree weeks before Jupiter’s first stationary point on11/10/709, and is even closer to Saturn’s first station-ary point on 11/2 /709 (Meeus n.d.). Since the supe-rior planets slow down as they approach retrograde,it seems that an approximation of the Jupiter eventis acceptable.God K events are noted in texts on four Yaxchila ́nmonuments, all of which depict a ruler holding aGod K manikin (Lintels 3, 7, 42, 52; Tate 1992,chila ́ n show a relatively high percentage of suchdates.

Lintels 7 and 42 bear dates linked with a sta-tionary point of Jupiter, and the date on Lintel 42relates to a time when Saturn was also at its first sta-tionary point (Table 6.1). The God K event on Lintel52 coincides with Saturn’s second stationary point(2 /3/766; Meeus n.d.). Lintel 3 records a Hotun end-ing (9.16.5.0.0; 4 /6 /756), and the same Hotun end-ing appears on Lintel 54, also depicting the rulerholding a God K manikin. Neither Jupiter nor Sat-urn was in retrograde on the Hotun date recordedon these two monuments, but the date is a subdivi-sion of the Katun that could be used to track the po-sition of Jupiter in relation to Saturn.In dynastic affairs, Saturn’s stationary point mayhave been considered a suitable substitute if Jupiterwas not at the appropriate position for a royal ritualinvolving God K. Lintel 1, showing Bird Jaguar IVwith the God K manikin, has a date that approxi-mates Saturn’s first stationary point (4 /2 /752; Meeusn.d.). The recorded event on this date is his accessionon 11 Ahau 8 Zec (9.16.1.0.0; 4 /27/752). Mars wasin retrograde on this date (second stationary pointon 5/5/752; Meeus n.d.).Allowing a twenty-one-day window on either sideof retrograde indicates that thirteen of fifteen monu-ments with God K imagery have dates relating to theretrograde periods of Jupiter or Saturn. Six corre-spond to the retrograde periods of both planets (Lin-tels 6, 32, 42, 43, 53, Stela 11). Five bear dates linkedonly with the retrograde of Jupiter (Lintels 7, 38, 39,40, Stela 1), and two other God K monuments relateonly to Saturn’s retrograde (Lintels 1, 52).On other Yaxchila ́ n monuments that bear datescoinciding with Jupiter’s retrograde, the imageryseems to emphasize events related to the ball game,warfare, and blood offerings, instead of representa-tions of God K. Step VII from Structure 33 relates aball-game event on 9.15.13.6.9 to Jupiter’s stationarypoint (Tate 1992 : 96 – 97, app. 2, fig. 111). A blood-letting event (9.12.9.8.1) on Yaxchila ́ n Lintel 25 co-incides with Jupiter’s departure from second sta-tionary point and the first stationary point of Mars(Fig. 5.8f ). On Stela 18, Shield Jaguar appears with acaptive, and the text records a capture event on 3 Eb14 Mol (9.14.17.15.12; 7/11/729) followed by refer-ence to God K as a sky god (C3) and a bloodlettingevent at C6 (Tate 1992, apps. 2 – 3, fig. 145). A cap-ture event (B7) and a fire event are linked with Ju-piter’s retrograde period ina.d.808 on Lintel 10(Tate 1992, fig. 47).Looking at the entire sample of dates Tate pub-lished for Yaxchila ́ n, 27 percent of the total (29 ofthe 109 dates) fall in Jupiter’s retrograde period orwithin seven days on either side of retrograde. Thisfigure falls below the expected random frequency of33 percent, using a seven-day window, but when wenarrow our focus to those monuments depictingGod K, the percentage bearing dates relating to Ju-piter’s retrograde is relatively high at 53 percent.Turning to the site of Tikal, we find another setof monuments to test for a possible pattern link-ing God K images to Jupiter’s retrograde period.Although I will not analyze the monuments sta-tistically, a pattern similar to the one at Yaxchila ́nstands out, especially on monuments that have onlyone date.Tikal Stela 20 shows Yaxkin Chaan K’awil (RulerB) wearing a headdress crowned by God K; his fret-ended mouth mask (possibly a stylized serpent jaw)is decorated with a star glyph (Pl. 17). The inscribeddate records the first Katun ending of his reign on2 Ahau 13 Zec (9.16.0.0.0; 5/3/751; Jones 1977 : 45).This stela is paired with Altar 8 in Twin-pyramidComplex P (Group 3D-2), one of the many twin-pyramid complexes probably devoted to Katun cere-monies. The Katun ending 9.16.0.0.0 provides a verygood correlation with Jupiter’s first stationary point(5/2 /751; Meeus n.d.). Saturn was also in retrogrademotion, and Mars rose at dawn, while Venus wasvisible near its maximum altitude. This was an aus-picious interlocking of astronomical and calendriccycles at the period ending. This Katun ending wassurely the focus of major ceremonies involving Ju-piter, for the planet stood still to honor the ruler onthe first Katun completed in his reign.A lintel from Structure 5D-52 shows YaxkinChaan K’awil holding a God K manikin scepter; aneroded date probably refers to the Lahuntun endingon 3 Ahau 3 Mol (9.15.10.0.0, 6 /24 /741; Jones 1977 :52, fig. 17).

It is followed by a reference to the Water-lilyJaguar, which Schele and Grube (1994 : 180) read asNu Balam Chaknal, naming the deity on the palan-quin. They suggest that the glyph passage names theWater-lily Jaguar as a deity image captured from thevanquished enemy, but it seems more likely that itrepresents a lunar deity who is the patron of the Ti-kal ruler.Stela 5 from Tikal probably also features God K,although here the manikin scepter is almost com-pletely effaced (Jones 1977, table 1, fig. 13).

The date also coin-cides with Saturn’s retrograde motion, and it ap-proximates the time when Venus was most brilliantas the Evening Star. This date appears with a distancenumber (9.11.12) that counts forward to 4 Ahau 8Yaxkin (9.15.13.0.0; 6 /8/744), a period ending that isthe dedicatory date of the monument. Since 9.11.12is a lunar interval, the Moon was once again at thelast quarter. At this time, Jupiter was in conjunctionwith the Sun and Saturn was departing from its sec-ond stationary point (5/17/744; Meeus n.d.). Thesetwo dates seem to correlate with events involving theMoon, Jupiter, and Saturn.As early as the mid-fifth century, Tikal dynasticmonuments link God K with Jupiter’s retrogrademotion. On the Early Classic Tikal Stela 1, a rulerholds a serpent bar bearing a God K hatchet manikinwith a snake leg, the prototype for the serpent-leggedGod K manikin scepter of the Late Classic period(W. Coe 1970 : 92; Proskouriakoff 1993 : 16; Taube1992b, fig. 37c). Because Chac is probably linkedwith Venus, it may be significant that Chac appearsat the other end of the serpent bar. The monumentis believed to date to the reign of Stormy Sky (K’awilChaan), or shortly thereafter. The fragmentary datesremain debatable, but one reconstruction suggests aabout to enter retrograde (first stationary point on7/10/741; Meeus n.d.). This Lahuntun ending ap-proximates Jupiter’s first stationary point, and itmarks a halfway point leading up to the exceptionalKatun 9.16.0.0.0, when Jupiter reached its first sta-tionary point at the end of the Katun.The same 3 Ahau 3 Mol Lahuntun date opens theinscription on Lintel 3 of Temple IV, which featuresGod K in the jaws of a Cosmic Monster arching overthe ruler’s head (Fig. 6.3o, Pl. 15; Jones 1977 : 36).Of the four Calendar Round dates on Lintel 3, onlythe Lahuntun ending on 3 Ahau 3 Mol shows a re-lationship with Jupiter’s retrograde, approximatingthe planet’s first stationary point. The lintel depictsGod K displaying a mirror glyph in his hand, posi-tioned like the flat-hand mirror compound used tomark Venus positions in the Venus table of the Dres-den Codex (Fig. 5.7a).The Lahuntun ending 3 Ahau 3 Mol, which opensthe inscription on Lintel 2 from Temple IV, alsocoincides with Jupiter’s first stationary point. HereYaxkin Chaan K’awil (Ruler B) holds his God Kmanikin scepter as a Jaguar War God protectorlooms over him (Pl. 16; Jones 1977, fig. 12). Thelatest date on Lintel 2 (9.15.15.14.0 3 Ahau 13 Uo;3/5/747) falls within retrograde periods of both Ju-piter and Saturn. Schele and Grube (1994 : 187; 1995 :40 – 46) note that a solar eclipse on 1/19/744 was aprelude to the star-war event recorded on the lintelat B8. According to Lounsbury (1989 : 255), the star-war event was timed by Jupiter’s departure fromits second stationary point. This war event dates to7 Ben 1 Pop (9.15.12.11.13; 2 /2 /744), coincidingwith Saturn’s retrograde period and with a time onlytwo weeks after Jupiter’s second stationary point(1/17/744; Meeus n.d.). Justeson (1989, table 8.8)points out that a number of war events coincide withthe retrograde periods of at least one of the superiorplanets.On Lintel 3 of Temple I, a Water-lily Jaguar loomsover another Tikal ruler carrying the God K scepteras an insignia of lineage and authority (Fig. 3.6d;Jones 1977, table 1). Originally designated as RulerA, he is variously called Ah Cacao Caan Chac, AhCacau, or, more recently, Hasaw Kan K’awil.

At this time, Saturn was in retrograde (1/18/451 to 6 /7/451) and Jupiter was approaching its sec-ond stationary point (5/9/451; Meeus n.d.). Jupiter,Saturn, and Mars were all clustered together in Virgoto the east, while the Evening Star was making itsfirst appearance in Taurus to the west.Stela 31 from Tikal is one of the first knownimages associating God K with a living ruler fromTikal (Figs. 3.7b, 6.3u; Coggins 1990 : 85). The rulerStormy Sky wears a headdress that includes an imageof God K, which, interestingly, also forms part of hispersonal name. Perhaps Jupiter was Stormy Sky’s pa-tron planet in the Early Classic Period, just as Jupiterguided events in the lives of Late Classic rulers, es-pecially at Palenque and Yaxchila ́ n. The Initial Seriesdate recorded on Stela 31 (9.0.10.0.0 7 Ahau 3 Yax;10/16 /445) corresponds to a time when Jupiter wasapproaching its second stationary point (11/23/445;Meeus n.d.). This date also approximates the heliacalset of Mars. Other coordinating events, discussed inChapters 3 and 4, include the new Moon and Venusapproaching its maximum brilliance as the MorningStar. The ruler himself seems to be compared to HunAhau, the underworld Sun linked with the MorningStar, while his father seems to be apotheosized as theSun God overhead (Chapter 3).One of the earliest known images of God K ap-pears on the Leyden Plaque, probably from Tikal(Pl. 2). Here the ruler Moon Zero Bird holds adouble-headed serpent bearing God K and the SunGod in its jaws (Schele and Miller 1986 : 121). Therecorded date, 8.14.3.1.12 1 Eb 0 Yaxkin (9/14 /320O.S.), corresponds approximately to Jupiter’s helia-cal rise just prior to the fall equinox. Jupiter’s dawnrise so close to the fall equinox links the cycles of theSun and Jupiter.Arthur Schlak (1989) correlates dates on monu-ments depicting God K manikin figures with periodswhen Mercury was visible, using maximum elonga-tion as a key to determining visibility. His sample isrelatively small, and he concentrates on manikin-scepter imagery, excluding many of the God K im-ages discussed here. When these monuments are in-cluded, a link with Jupiter events emerges. Amongthe twenty dates that Schlak correlates with the visi-bility of Mercury, eight coincide with Jupiter’s ret-rograde motion, allowing a seven-day window. Ofthose that do not, a significant number come frommonuments with multiple dates. If we are free to se-lect another date, we often find one that correlateswith Jupiter’s retrograde motion. Since Mercury isvisible 65 percent of the time (Aveni and Hotaling1994 : S39), a statistical study should be done with acomplete corpus of God K monuments from severalsites to determine whether there is an unusually highpercentage of God K monuments that correspond totimes when Mercury was visible.In a more recent study, Schlak (1996, table 4)takes his original twenty dates and adds another vari-able to his analysis — altazimuth —which measuresMercury’s height above the horizon. He also addstwelve mores dates linked with God K glyphs (Schlak1996, table 3). Even with this expanded list, Schlakhas omitted a number of monuments with God Kimages that are incorporated in this study. He makesno claim that any of the dates are precisely maxi-mum altitude or maximum elongation, only thatthey coincide with Mercury’s visibility. One-third arewithin five days of one of Jupiter’s stationary points(Dates 3, 9, 10, 12). All but three dates can be linkedwith times when either Jupiter or Saturn was inretrograde.Clemency Coggins (1990 : 84 – 85, fig. 5.1a) sug-gests that God K represents Venus as a god of light-ning connecting the earth with the sky. She believesthat Stormy Sky’s personal name is a pun for K’uk’Ka’an (bird-serpent), referring to Kukulcan as Ve-nus. Although a link with lightning seems likely, theconnection between God K and the feathered ser-pent seems tenuous, especially since Coggins makesno attempt to link God K to dates recording signifi-cant Venus positions.In sum, God K seems to embody the planet Jupi-ter, and the Katun cycle involving Jupiter and Saturnin the Classic period. Jupiter events were apparentlyimportant in the lives of Classic Maya rulers, whooften appear with the insignia of God K. Jupiterevents are implicated in the dates associated with twoimages of a dead ruler in the guise of God K. At Yax-chila ́ n, Palenque, and Tikal, God K monuments usu-ally bear dates coinciding with Jupiter’s retrogradeJUPITER EVENTS AND GOD K239"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Saturn. Kelley (1985 : 238) points out that the inter-val between successive Jupiter-Saturn conjunctionsis between nineteen and twenty years (the approxi-mate length of a Katun), and every sixty Tuns, a con-junction or opposition takes place in the same partof the sky. This may explain why astronomical dataare included in the records of Katun-ending rituals.Lounsbury (1991 : 817) notes that the Katun prophe-cies are essentially astrological texts.The Classic Maya tracked the motions of Jupiterand Saturn using the 819-day cycle. This cycle firstappears in the middle of the Classic period (Louns-bury 1978 : 811). The 819-day cycle has a commonfactor (21) with synodical periods of Jupiter and Sat-urn, and there seems to be a correlation with Ju-piter and Saturn events and the 819-day countsrecorded in the inscriptions (Justeson 1989 : 103).Dennis Tedlock (1992) notes that Palenque recordsshow an idealized 399-day Jupiter cycle that can bedivided into 21-day segments, a division that givesthe planet a systematic link with the 819-day cycle.The 819-day count is particularly common at Pa-lenque, and it was probably invented there and laterspread to other sites (Berlin 1977 : 78 –79). This cy-cle continued to be recorded as late as 10.2.0.0.0(Stela 11 at Tikal). Eric Thompson (1960 : 212 – 216)first recognized that through the interplay of twentyday signs, colors, and directions, the 819-day cyclebreaks down into sets: red-east-Imix; north-white-Ik; west-black-Akbal, and yellow-south-Kan. Therelationship of these divisions to planetary cycles re-mains enigmatic.A mythological text on the left side of the centralpanel in Palenque’s Temple of the Sun refers to an819-day station on 1 Ik 10 Tzec (1.6.14.11.2; 8/12 /2587b.c.) that was not to repeat again for more than3,200 years (63352 vague years; Lounsbury 1989 :247 – 248, fig. 19.2). There is an oblique reference toa sacred Jupiter event associated with the 819-day-count clause in this mythological text, according toSchele (1990 : 143). Lounsbury points out that thenext occurrence of the same 819-day station on 1 Ik10 Tzec took place sixty-three Calendar Rounds lateron a date (9.12.16.2.2; 5/15/688) recorded in the Me-dallion Series of the Temple of the Inscriptions. Atthat time, Jupiter and Mars were both just pullingmotion. God K might have more than one plane-tary aspect, for when a Jupiter event is not apparent,Saturn seems to act as a substitute. Between Katun9.15.10.0.0 and 9.17.0.0.0 there seems to be intenseinterest in recording dates that coincide with Jupi-ter’s and Saturn’s retrograde, probably because theKatun 9.16.0.0.0 links the retrograde periods of bothJupiter and Saturn and precisely marks the first sta-tionary point of Jupiter.CLASSIC PERIOD CALENDAR RECORDSRELATING TO THE SUPERIOR PLANETSThe Tzolkin calendar has a built-in capacity to mea-sure the synodic periods of planets because three sa-cred rounds of 260 days equal one synodic period ofMars (780 days), sixteen sacred rounds equal elevenSaturn synodic periods (plus 1 day), and twenty-three sacred rounds are three days less than fifteenJupiter synodic periods (Justeson 1989 : 82, tables8.5, 8.6). Since five sacred rounds are just sixteenhours short of forty-four lunar months, the Moon isalso involved. Justeson notes that in less than sixteenyears, the 260-day calendar provides the interval thataligns the synodic period of the Moon and of all thevisible planets to within 4.31 days.Justeson (1989 : 102, table 8.6) points out that it isnot possible to structure a table of positions for Mer-cury, Jupiter, or Saturn in terms of the number ofCalendar Rounds (52 vague years) that would becommensurate with any of the average synodic pe-riods. Apparently the Maya used the 360-day civilyear (Tun) to correlate the cycles of the superiorplanets (Justeson 1989 : 102 –103, table 8.7).Jupiter observations may have been linked to the360-day Tun, because the mean period it spends aseither the Morning or the Evening Star is 367 days.During one complete Tun, Jupiter would be seen inthe same sector of the sky at approximately the sametime of night. The period of twelve Tuns (4,320 days)is relatively close to the sidereal period of Jupiter(4,332.5 days), separated by about 13 days or onetrecena.The Katun cycle of twenty Tuns may have beenused in Classic Maya times to track Jupiter and240THE CELESTIAL WANDERERS"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"away from conjunction and simultaneously begin-ning forward motion after retrograde. Although notnoted by Lounsbury, Saturn was in retrograde at thistime, approaching its second stationary point (6 /23/688; Meeus n.d.). This may be significant because thecycles of Jupiter and Saturn are linked through the819-day count.A number of monuments seem to record mul-tiples of the synodic intervals of Jupiter and Saturn(Kelley and Kerr 1973, table 2). These may be rec-ords of actual observations rather than canonical orpredicted cycles (Justeson 1989 : 82). A Saturn inter-val of 377.75 days appears on the Temple of theCross at Palenque and on Caracol Stela 3, Lintel 3of Tikal Temple I, Tikal Stela 5, Naranjo Stela 12, andQuirigua ́ Zoomorph G. A Jupiter interval calculatedat 398.867 days appears on the Hieroglyphic Stair-way of Naranjo, Yaxchila ́ n Lintel 41, Copa ́ n Stela I,Caracol Stela 3, and Quirigua ́ Monument 7 (Zoo-morph G). The Caracol Stela 3 date (9.9.18.16.3) alsocoincides with the first appearance of the Eve-ning Star.Thompson (1960 : 227 – 229) says that even though1 Ahau and the heliacal rise of Venus are connectedin the Dresden Codex, Classic period Katuns endingwith 1 Ahau seem to be linked with Jupiter intervalsin the Maya inscriptions. He notes that the Hiero-glyphic Stairway of Naranjo records a star glyph ona Katun-ending 1 Ahau (9.10.0.0.0), and a distancenumber (2.5.7.12) separating this date from an ear-lier one recorded on the stairs (9.7.14.10.8) equalstwenty-eight synodic revolutions of Venus and forty-one synodic periods of Jupiter; thus Venus and Ju-piter were in the same position in the sky on thetwo dates. The earlier date may be linked with Jupi-ter’s heliacal rise. Although it was a few days afterJupiter’s dawn rise in Aries, it may have been the firstday the planet was visible. Venus was the MorningStar in the neighboring constellation (Pisces) andwas relatively high in the sky, having dropped about47from maximum altitude (Aveni and Hotaling1994, table 1). On the Lahuntun date, 9.10.0.0.0 1Ahau 8 Kayab (1/22 /633), Jupiter was again visiblejust above the horizon at dawn, but this time in Cap-ricorn, and Venus was once again high in the sky asthe Morning Star in the neighboring constellation(Sagittarius). On this second date there was a con-junction between Venus, Saturn, and the waningMoon.Stationary points of Jupiter apparently signaledaccession-related rituals at Palenque, and planetaryconjunctions also seem to be significant in timingthese events (Lounsbury 1989, 1991). As noted ear-lier, Jupiter’s departure from its second station-ary point coincided with Chan Bahlum II’s heir-designation event at Palenque on 9 Akbal 6 Xul(9.10.8.9.3; 6 /12 /641). This royal ritual coincideswith the third in a series of conjunctions involvingJupiter and Mars. The three conjunctions markedthe beat of Jupiter’s retrograde period: the first co-incided with Jupiter’s first stationary point; the sec-ond with the opposition of Jupiter and Mars to theSun; and the third with Jupiter’s departure from itssecond stationary point (Lounsbury 1989 : 251– 252,fig. 19.6). Chan Bahlum’s accession ceremony wasalso timed by Jupiter’s departure from its second sta-tionary point. This suggests that dynastic ceremoniesat Palenque were considered especially auspiciouswhen Jupiter was resuming its forward motion.Jupiter observations were also important on theanniversaries of dates associated with Chan Bahlum,who apparently had an obsession with the planet Ju-piter (Aveni 1992b : 78; Lounsbury 1989). The mostcommon target seems to be those times when Jupiterreached its stationary point and was beginning ‘‘for-ward’’ motion once again (departure from the sec-ond stationary point). Many of the dates studied byLounsbury also fall on or very near a conjunction ofMars with Jupiter.Dumbarton Oaks Relief Panel 1, a posthumousportrait of a ruler holding a spear, is associated withthe time of retrograde motion for Mars, Jupiter, andSaturn. James Fox and John Justeson (1978 : 55 –56)note that the ruler’s date of death on 6 Akbal 11 Pax(9.15.1.6.3; 12 /11/732) is a few days from Saturn’ssecond stationary point (12 /15/732; Meeus n.d.),and an interval at the end of the inscription counts378 days (the length of Saturn’s synodic period) to9.15.2.7.1, when Saturn was once again at its secondstationary point (12 /29/733; Meeus n.d.). More re-cently, Justeson (1989 : 109) points out that the deathdate is also connected with the first stationary pointCALENDAR RECORDS RELATING TO SUPERIOR PLANETS241"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"associated with Jupiter’s retrograde is also seen onthe Chicago Ball-court Panel.War events recorded at Piedras Negras (Lintels 2and 4, Stela 35) are also linked with Jupiter’s retro-grade motion (Schele and Freidel 1990 : 445). An-other war date (9.10.17.2.14, from Tortuguero) in-volved retrograde of all three planets (Justeson 1989;Tuckerman 1964). Studying star-war dates in theMaya inscriptions, Justeson (1989 : 109, table 8.8)concludes that warfare events cluster during the dryseason, and three-quarters of them occur at signifi-cant points in the cycles of Saturn or Jupiter. Hepoints out that the results of his analysis indicate thatthere are more star-war events involving Saturn orJupiter than there are associated with Venus events.There is a statistically significant correlation betweenthe clusters of star-war events relating to the retro-grade periods of Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars (Justeson1989 : 110, 123 n. 20). He notes, however, that Marsevents seem to be only rarely recorded in Classic pe-riod records (Justeson 1989 : 109).Some war events may relate to planetary conjunc-tions. On the date of a war event recorded on Nar-anjo Stela 23 (9.13.18.9.15 1 Men 13 Yaxkin; 6 /22 /710), all five planets visible to the naked eye wereclustered in Leo within 67of each other, and onlyJupiter remained beyond a 17radius (Aveni and Ho-taling 1994 : S53 n. 56). Indeed, this was the closestclustering of these five planets in five millennia (Ol-son and White 1997 : 64).Conjunction events involving more than twoplanets are exceedingly rare (Aveni and Hotaling1994 : S42). For example, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturngot together only twice during the entire course ofthe Classic period: ina.d.690 and again ina.d.828.Such conjunctions may involve planets passing oneanother more than once. In the case of the tripleconjunction ofa.d.690, the last of the conjunctionsoccurred on or near 2 Cib 14 Mol, when Chan Bah-lum performed rites to honor the gods, which wererecorded on several Palenque monuments (Aveniand Hotaling 1994 : S42 – S43, S47 – S48; Du ̈ tting1982; Lounsbury 1989 : 248, fig. 19.1). Since theplanets were actually closer together ten days afterthe recorded event, the determining factor for the 2of Mars (12 /18/732; Meeus n.d.). It should be notedthat the date also coincides approximately with thetime of opposition, the midpoint of Jupiter’s retro-grade motion (10/19/732 to 2 /15/733; Meeus n.d.).Fox and Justeson suggest that astrology played a rolebecause astronomical events were of significancewhen they coincided with historical events. On theother hand, Joyce Marcus (1992 : 440) maintains thatthe historical events sometimes were manipulated tofit the astronomical events. In my opinion, the deathevent may actually refer to the ruler’s apotheosis, forsuch an event could be adjusted to fit the proper as-trological conditions.Tate (1989, table 32.3; 1992 : 93, 272) points to aninterest in stationary points of Jupiter and Saturnand in Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions on Yaxchila ́nmonuments. She refers to a number of dates thatcoincide with Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions. Tate alsonotes parallels in the type of events commemorated,for the verbs referring to the ceremonies — blood-letting verbs and a rare God N verb —were usedat both Palenque and Yaxchila ́ n (Tate 1989 : 422 –423). Although I have suggested that God N’s quad-ripartite nature could be linked with the Moon orone of the inferior planets, it is also possible that hecould be connected with the quadripartite divisionimplied in the four directional aspects of the 819-day cycle known to be connected with Jupiter andSaturn.As noted earlier, ball-game events seem to belinked with Jupiter’s retrograde period. Yaxchila ́nStep VII from Structure 33 depicts Bird Jaguar’s ballgame, an event coinciding with Jupiter’s retrogrademotion (Tate 1992 : 96 – 97, app. 2, fig. 111). Thegame and associated bloodletting event on 3 Muluc17 Mac (9.15.13.6.9; 10/15/744) is about a week be-fore the first stationary point of Jupiter (10/23/744;Meeus n.d.). A ball-game event on 7/7/881(10.2.12.1.8 9 Lamat 11 Yax) recorded on Lintel 1 ofthe Temple of the Four Lintels at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ fallsvery close to the solar zenith, but in terms of ball-game imagery, it may be more significant that thisdate coincides with Jupiter’s retrograde motion(Chapter 3). Linda Schele and David Freidel (1990 :445) note that a ball-game sacrifice and bloodletting242THE CELESTIAL WANDERERS"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Cib 14 Mol event has been taken to be the Moon’sposition passing Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars, all lo-cated less that 57apart in the constellation Scorpiuson July 19 – 20.Linda Schele (1992b : 94, 167 –170) interprets the2 Cib 14 Mol event as First Mother, the goddess ofthe moon, reuniting with the Palenque Triad repre-senting her three planetary children (see also Scheleand Freidel 1990 : 256, 473 – 474 n. 41). Nonetheless,the Triad gods are not named together with the2 Cib 14 Mol date. In the Temple of the FoliatedCross, this date is associated with a god with a shellbeard and a jaguar ear (a Venus god or the JGU?)and with GII named at L4-M4 (Pl. 11). The Templeof the Sun at Palenque names only GIII (at O6) inassociation with this event. The event is not men-tioned in the Temple of the Cross. Furthermore, thenotion of the Triad being the superior planets is in-compatible with Schele’s identification of GI as Ve-nus and GIII as the Sun. Finally, it must be notedthat the date of the Moon passing by the planets hasbeen determined using the 584,285 correlation, butin the 584,283 correlation, the Moon was still posi-tioned at some distance from the planets on thisdate (7/18/690). I would argue that the most im-portant factors are Jupiter’s and Saturn’s departurefrom the second stationary point, events that are es-sentially the same in either of the two correlations.Studying the twelve-year anniversary of the eventrecorded on 1 Cib 14 Mol (7/15/702), Lounsbury(1989 : 249 – 250, figs. 19.1, 19.4) points out that bothrituals took place at a time when Jupiter was in thesame part of its synodic period and was located inthe same region of Scorpius. Apparently, Chan Bah-lum kept a record of Jupiter’s sidereal position.Chan Bahlum’s accession and apotheosis eventsare within fifteen days of the second stationary pointof Jupiter (Lounsbury 1989, table 19.1, fig. 19.3).Jupiter’s dawn rise was also of interest. The eight-year anniversary of Chan Bahlum’s accession on 5Eb 5 Kayab (9.12.19.14.12; 1/5/692) coincided withthe heliacal rising of Jupiter, when the planet re-appeared after more than a month of invisibility(Lounsbury 1989 : 252). The anniversary may alsoreflect an interest in Venus, for that planet was nearits maximum altitude (Aveni and Hotaling 1994).Marcus (1992 : 440) believes that political propa-ganda played a role in the dates selected to documentthe important points in the lives of rulers. In somecases, events in a ruler’s life were forced into a pat-tern to fit the astronomical events. As noted earlier,Dumbarton Oaks Relief Panel 1 records the apo-theosis of a ruler (9.15.1.6.3) in a context that seemsto be timed by astrology, for the date (12 /11/732)can be linked with the retrograde motion of allthree superior planets. Similarly, there are instancesin which Venus events seem to guide the choiceof dates marking historical events (Chapter 5). An-thony Aveni and Lorren Hotaling (1994 : S22) notethat if astronomical reference points prove to be soimportant in the lives of rulers, perhaps the conclu-sions about the nature of Maya inscriptions reachedby an earlier generation of scholars are not so faroff the mark. In other words, in some cases historyseems to be subordinate to the astronomical cycles,and historical events were being ‘‘adjusted’’ to fit theskies.Aveni and Hotaling’s (1994 : S40) chi-square sta-tistical test of ninety-eight Maya dates with astro-nomical ‘‘tags’’ indicates that 38 percent of the datesfall during a retrograde period of two of the supe-rior planets (usually Jupiter and Saturn); this is stat-istically significant because the anticipated randompercentage would be 24 percent, using a gener-ous thirty-day window. Moreover, twenty-nine datesthat do not correspond to one of the four Venusstations fall very close to the appearance or dis-appearance of one of the other planets. Since thestudy grouped a number of different types of datedevents, further research is needed in the future tosort out patterns that may distinguish events in-volving the superior planets from those referring toVenus.In sum, a number of Classic period calendarcycles lend themselves to records involving the su-perior planets, including the 260-day sacred roundor Tzolkin, the Katun cycle, and the 819-day count.Jupiter and Saturn intervals are recorded in a num-ber of Classic Maya inscriptions, suggesting that theMaya observed these planets in tandem.

One wears a tri-lobed pendant like GI’s, and another represents Chac(Venus?) wielding an axe. A third deity has a serpentfoot that links him with God K (Jupiter). A skeletalgod with a death collar may be a lunar deity. Theothers are difficult to identify, but the total of sevensuggests a grouping of the Sun, the Moon, and thefive planets visible to the naked eye (Chapter 7).Chac is one of six deities on the limbs of the CauacMonster on Quirigua ́ Monument 16, also known asZoomorph P (Fig. 6.4a). The assembly includes twovariants of Chac, the Sun God with a mirror browand the Moon God with white markings (Fig. 4.6b).One deity is effaced and another is difficult to iden-tify. The ruler in the jaws of the Cauac Monster holdsa God K scepter, perhaps completing the quorum ofthe seven ‘‘planets’’ of classical antiquity.The central panel of Palenque’s Temple of the Sunhas an intriguing group of deities (Fig. 3.6b). Asnoted in previous chapters, we see a Jaguar War Godshield (the dry-season moon), a crouching Sun Godwith a mirror brow, and God K (Jupiter) as a mani-kin held by Chan Bahlum at the time of his accessionon 1/5/684. Another crouching figure on the rightbears body markings representing God C, who maybe linked with a monkey planet, as noted earlier.God L, who represents the dry-season Morning Starin the Dresden Codex, here supports a double-headed bar portraying a zoomorph; an enigmaticfigure who shares many of God L’s attributes sup-ports the other end of the bar. Although we cannotspecifically identify all of these gods as astronomicaldeities, it is noteworthy that the accession date showsa number of interesting planetary positions. In ad-dition to a correlation with Jupiter’s departure fromKatun itself relates to the interval between succes-sive conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn. Jupiter maybe linked with the Tun because the planet’s periodof visibility is relatively close to one Tun. At Pa-lenque, Chan Bahlum’s accession and apotheosisevents were timed by Jupiter’s departure from itssecond stationary point. Observations of Jupiter andSaturn may be connected with ball games, blood-letting ceremonies, star wars, and accession anni-versaries at a number of Maya sites. In some cases,the dates of Classic Maya history were manipulatedto fall into alignment with astronomical events,placing the lives of rulers in the context of mythichistory.ASSEMBLY OF THE GODSWe can only identify a small percentage of planetarygods with any degree of certainty. If we see any ofthese among a group of deities, we could be lookingat an image showing an assembly of planets. Theirastronomical nature is sometimes shown by sharedinsignia, such as a pendant with trilobe ends or aheadband.The Las Sepulturas bench from Copa ́ n representsan assembly of astronomical gods (Pl. 19). Venus ap-pears as a scorpion-man (Chapter 5). The cross-eyedSun God and the Moon deity with the lunar crescentand rabbit are easy to pick out. An anthropomorphicdeity with a deer ear may represent Mars as the deerplanet. Two heads, resembling the Principal BirdDeity, may represent a King Vulture (Benson 1997 :91). The Principal Bird Deity is the avian counter-part of God D, a deity whose astronomical identityremains uncertain.Copa ́ n’s Structure 22 depicts seven different dei-244THE CELESTIAL WANDERERSFIG. 6.4.a:Assembly of six deities on body of Late ClassicCauac Monster includes Sun, Moon, Chac in two aspects,and two other unknown deities (Quirigua ́ Zoomorph P;after Maudslay 1889 –1902, 2, pl. 64).b:Early Classic list of nine gods that includes sky god(God C), earth deity, Paddler Twins, Ik God (T1082), GodD variant, solar god, and aged Bacab (Tikal Stela 31; afterA.

Next we find an Ik God (T1082), thecounterpart of the personified number three, pairedwith a long-nosed god, possibly an early form ofGod D. There follows a god with attributes of theSun God, but lacking the Kin infix, and an aged Ba-cab with raised hands who seems to emerge from astar glyph. A jawless head seems to be a variant ofthe Uinal sign (T521) prefixed by the number one.The passage ends with a compound incorporatingthe number nine, which is exactly the number ofgods named.On the Protoclassic Hauberg Stela, a group ofsmall deities may be one of the earliest known Mayarepresentations of the Sun, the Moon, and the plan-ets (Fig. 6.4c). The astronomical context of this im-agery is clear, because the uppermost figure climbingthe celestial serpent wears a star headdress. Chac, thelowest of four climbers, carries an axe in his hand,much like God B, the Postclassic god of rain andstorms (Stuart 1988, fig. 5.48; Taube 1992b, fig. 7b).The serpent is a representation of the ecliptic, ac-cording to Schele (1992b : 143 –144), who identifiesthe climbing figures as constellations. It seems morelikely that they are planetary gods, but their head-dresses could refer to specific constellations. Threeclimbers wear headbands, evoking the HeadbandTwins. There are seven figures in total if we add thegroup of descending figures led by the figure wear-ing a Kin headdress. The descending gods are dead,their severed torsos spewing blood. Linda Schele andMary Miller (1986 : 191, pl. 66) reconstruct the dateas 3 Ahau 13 Xul (10/8/199; the month Xul has anerroneous coefficient of twelve), one of two datesoriginally proposed by Schele (1985). There is noth-ing particularly notable about this date in termsof astronomy, except perhaps that the first visiblecrescent probably corresponds to this date. Schlak(1996 : 182, fig. 1) proposes that the ruler on this stelaimpersonates Venus as GI, although here he lacks thecharacteristic shell earrings. Schlak relates the imageto a time when Venus was relatively high as theMorning Star on 8.8.0.7.0 3 Ahau 13 Xul.Painted vases depicting the Holmul Dancer thememay show an assembly of astronomical gods at thetime of an accession ceremony or Katun event. Thevase known as Princeton 14 shows three dancing fig-its second stationary point, noted previously, Marswas in retrograde motion (second stationary pointon 2 /8/684; Meeus n.d.), Mercury was just visible inthe dawn sky, and Venus was approaching its maxi-mum altitude as Morning Star (reached twenty dayslater).Lists of astronomical gods are known from Pa-lenque. In addition to the group of four deities onthe eaves of House C, discussed earlier in relation toGod C, there is a list of six gods in the Temple of theFoliated Cross at Palenque (Fig. 4.6e). One of the sixis a vulture paired with the personified number one;because the vulture lacks a day-sign cartouche, thereference is to a deity name rather than to the vulturevariant of the day sign Ahau seen in other inscrip-tions (Thompson 1960, fig. 11, nos. 30, 31). The vul-ture might be a planet, because he takes an activerole in the affairs of the Moon Goddess, being theMoon Goddess’s lover in folktales and in the codices(Dresden Codex 19a). Schele (1992b : 170) takes the2 Cib 14 Mol event to be the key to the imagery ofthe six gods, but this date is not directly associatedwith the list. The six gods are named directly follow-ing a distance number of 6.11.6 linked to the Calen-dar Round 8 Oc 3 Kayab (9.12.11.12.10; 1/5/684),the date of Chan Bahlum’s accession, when Jupiterhad just departed from its second stationary pointand Mars was in retrograde motion. The distancenumber (6.11.6) prefixed by T126 calls for subtrac-tion, alluding to an earlier date of 9.12.5.1.4 1 Kan7 Yaxkin (6 /24 /677) not recorded in the text. Themost interesting thing about this interval is that itcounts back precisely to the first stationary point ofMars (Meeus n.d.). Despite the Mars connection, theMars Beast is not among the gods named. The listincludes the Triad and a lunar deity discussed inChapter 4, as well as Chac and the vulture god calledHun Ahaw. It is puzzling that the list includes thenames of both GI and Chac, who seem to be linkedwith Venus in some manner.A list of gods on the Early Classic Tikal Stela 31could refer to an assembly of gods (Fig. 6.4b). Theearth god, his head marked by a Cab (earth) sym-bol, is paired with God C, who has a sky glyph in-fixed on his head (for greater detail, see Fig. 6.2h).The names for the Paddler Twins follow just below246THE CELESTIAL WANDERERS"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"ures with backracks holding deities that carry in-verted heads of God K (Coe 1978b : 94, no. 14). Asnoted earlier, these scenes show the sky-band back-racks framing God K’s head, suggesting parallels withthe transfer of power at the end of the Katun repre-sented on Paris Codex pages 2 –12. Dorie Reents-Budet (1991 : 220 – 221, fig. 7) points out that threedifferent deities are represented in the backracks,each identified by glyphic names. Ix Balam is theWater-lily Jaguar linked with the Moon in Chap-ter 4. The monkey deity, 10 Chuen, could be a mon-key planet. A furry animal called 6 Sky evokes thegod named 6 Sky, listed among the five gods of thewest in the Dresden Codex Venus table (Kelley 1976,fig. 28).The Vase of the Seven Gods shows an assembly ofseven gods associated with the creation date 4 Ahau8 Cumku (Pl. 7; Coe 1973 : 107 –108, no. 49). God Lappears as the ruler of a court of gods who gesturein submission. He smokes a cigar, like his counter-part in the relief panel on the right side of the Tem-ple of the Cross at Palenque (Schele 1977, fig. 4.2).This aspect of God L is different from his guise as amerchant with a merchant pack and a staff (Taube1922b, fig. 40). The Jaguar War God heads the toprow of gods but is named last in the glyph column.The Sun God brings up the rear on the bottom row(Chapter 3). Most of the gods are named with glyphsintroduced by God C’s glyph compound accompa-nied by the water/ blood group prefix, here designat-ing their sacred status. The only name without sucha title is the jawless God of T1058 (the patron ofPax?), whose name stands alone before the Calen-dar Round date. Other names include Bolonyocte(IX.765 : 87), who appears as one of the planetarygods on the eaves of House C at Palenque andwas especially revered at Palenque (Berlin 1977 : 150;Schele 1992b : 185).The date 4 Ahau 8 Cumku on the vessel is usuallyinterpreted as a reference to the beginning of time inthe Maya calendar (13.0.0.0.0; Closs 1979 : 151; Coe1973 : 108; Du ̈ tting 1981 : 221). Another alternative isthat the vase shows a commemoration of an anniver-sary event when the Calendar Round date repeatedduring the Late Classic period. All 4 Ahau 8 Cumkudates in the Late Classic period fall in the dry season,which seems appropriate for the imagery of the Jag-uar War God symbolizing the dry-season. Half of thedates also coordinate with the periods when Venuswas the Morning Star. The vessel has been dated be-tweena.d.750 and 800 on stylistic grounds (Fields1994 :319). This would make the 4 Ahau 8 Cumkuanniversary date of 1/4 /785 the most likely, coincid-ing with when Venus was the Morning Star. Thisseems appropriate because God L represents the dry-season Morning Star in the Dresden Codex, an as-sociation also seen in Classic period times in Palen-que’s Temple of the Sun.We can conclude that the assembly of gods is animportant theme represented in a variety of media.Several images depict sets of seven gods, presumablyindicating the seven planets of classical antiquity.Such groups suggest iconic imagery alluding to allthe major powers of the sky rather than to specificobservations of the planets in sky positions. None-theless, we should not ignore the possibility thatsome planetary data are conveyed in such images.Such groupings provide another key to identifyingthe more enigmatic planetary gods.THE CELESTIAL WANDERERSAS PLANETARY GODSSome twenty-five years ago, Thompson (1974 : 88)said: ‘‘We know neither names nor glyphs of anyplanet other than Venus.’’ The situation has im-proved somewhat, because we can now definitivelyidentify the Mars Beast, and there seems to be strongevidence associating God K with Jupiter. Perhaps thebest approach for solving the problem of planetaryidentities is to look for patterning in dates and cal-endar periods associated with specific deities. Suchan approach has helped to reveal the planetary iden-tity of God K.God K imagery correlates with dates coincidingwith the retrograde period of Jupiter at a number ofmajor Maya sites, such as at Palenque, Tikal, andYaxchila ́ n. Two posthumous portraits of rulers in-corporate God K images and dates that coincide withJupiter’s retrograde motion, suggesting that Jupiter’sposition was significant in the dates chosen for theapotheosis of Maya rulers.

Theplanet’s animal counterpart is a deer monster knownas the Mars Beast. Another aspect of Mars may besimian, possibly connected with the spider monkey.A closely related being is God C, a monkey deity whomay be connected with a planet, but his astronomi-cal nature is poorly understood. A howler monkeyseems to be connected with the Morning Star, and itis possible that a number of the planets may havemonkey alter egos.Unfortunately, there is still insufficient evidenceto identify the god representing Saturn. Saturn’s slowmovement could be represented by an aged being,but as yet no clear candidate has emerged. There isstill a great deal to do in terms of identifying theplanets and their various alter egos. Although ani-mals may play a role in the imagery of planets, wewould expect anthropomorphic deities, includingour simian relatives, to predominate. Indeed, sincethe creatures of the zodiac are mostly animals (Chap-ter 7), the planets may be distinguished by their an-thropomorphic guises.on monuments recording subdivisions of the Katun,a time period that may have been used to track Ju-piter and Saturn. Postclassic evidence also points toa link between God K and Jupiter, especially appar-ent in God K’s role in the Katun cycle. The Jupiterassociation is bolstered by God K’s role as a victim ofthe Morning Star in the Dresden Codex at a timewhen Jupiter was in retrograde motion disappearingbelow the horizon as the Morning Star rose.God K is also a god of thunder and lightning,sharing the same role that Jupiter had in ancientGreece and Italy. Perhaps this notion has an expla-nation in nature, one that is connected with folklorelinking Jupiter to storms. God K’s role as the god ofMaya rulers also presents an overlap with ancientEuropean traditions identifying Jupiter as the planetof kings. There is a natural basis for the associationwith kings, since Jupiter seems to dominate the nightsky and is second only to Venus in brilliance. Jupiteris rarely absent from the sky (mean disappearanceinterval532 days). Steady, strong, and ever-present,Jupiter makes a perfect celestial ruler, the counter-part to the good ruler on Earth.Groupings of six or seven different gods on Clas-sic period monuments usually include the Sun andthe Moon and planetary companions, suggesting aniconic grouping like that of classical antiquity. A248THE CELESTIAL WANDERERS"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"7STARS, THE MILKY WAY,COMETS, AND METEORSThis chapter explores Precolumbian Maya imagery of temporary celestial phe-nomena, stars, constellations, and the Milky Way. We have surprisingly little infor-mation on comets, meteors, and supernovas. Comets and meteors seem to be ofsecondary importance, appearing not as gods themselves, but as their cigars. Meta-phorical images allude to the multitude of stars as jaguar spots, flowers, fireflies, andthe ‘‘eyes of the night.’’ Topographical features such as sacred trees represent crossconstellations that serve as signposts in the celestial landscape. More often the con-stellations are starry animals appearing as companions to the Sun, the Moon, andthe planets. A Postclassic ‘‘zodiac’’ from Yucata ́ n helps to identify thirteen constel-lations, including bird constellations, a jaguar or ocelot, two snakes, a peccary, aturtle, and various other creatures. Some of these Precolumbian Maya constellationshave at least one first-magnitude star that could be tracked even in bright moonlight.Individual stars were also named, but we are able to identify only a few from Colo-nial period sources. Architectural orientations help to identify which constellationswere important to the Classic Maya.Constellations located at the intersection points of the Milky Way and the eclipticseem to be especially important in Precolumbian Maya cosmology. The Pleiades arerepresented by the rattlesnake’s rattle in Yucata ́ n, an image that is also found incentral Mexico. Orion’s Belt represents a turtle constellation, but other stars in Orionmay be linked with the Hearthstones of Creation. Scorpius is a scorpion in thenorthern Maya area, but to the south it may be a skeletal serpent known as theWhite-Bone-Snake. There is a fish-snake constellation in the region of Sagittarius, astar group associated with the Quadripartite God forming the rear head of the Cos-mic Monster. The Cosmic Monster itself seems to embody the Milky Way, and thetwo areas where it intersects the ecliptic represent opposite seasons. Itzamna, de-scribed extensively in Colonial period accounts, may symbolize the entire sky, hisfour bodies formed by the two sides of the Milky Way and the two sides of theecliptic. A similar configuration is suggested by the four roads of the Popol Vuh.The relationship of the stars to the seasons has shifted slightly due to precession,but the starry sky we see today is not too different from that of Classic and Post-classic Maya times. Although we look for precise events, such as a star’s heliacal risedate, most probably the Maya looked for a more general association with the sea-sons. I should note that the Precolumbian constellations are not configured with thesame stars as our Western constellations. Even though I use the European designa-tions for convenience, the reader should be cautioned that I refer only to stars in"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"stars with different colors. For example, the Perseidshave a marked yellow cast. Viewed over long periodsof time, meteors undergo changes in intensity thatcan be connected with comets, such as the Leonidshower that has a period of intensity related to the33.17-year period of the comet Tempel-Tuttle fromwhich it derives (Trenary 1987 –1988 : 110, fig. 7).Some contemporary Maya accounts say that ob-sidian is the excrement dropped from shooting stars,but more commonly the meteors themselves are de-scribed as excrement of the stars, paralleling ac-counts recorded in recent Mixtec and Na ́ huatl texts(Chapter 1; Trenary 1987 –1988, table 1). The an-cient heritage of this image is evident in graphicscenes of star excrement in Mixteca-Puebla codices(Codex Borgia 26; Trenary 1987 –1988, fig. 2). Par-allel scenes involving star excrement in the Mayacodices are not apparent; however, Maya images in-volving obsidian, cigars, and torches should be stud-ied for a possible relationship with seasonal meteorshowers. Contemporary Maya people say that mete-ors are connected with discarded celestial cigars andcigarettes, torches, and ancient arrowheads made ofobsidian (Chapter 1).A number of contemporary Maya terms do notdistinguish between comets and meteors (Tedlock1992b : 181). This may also have been true in earliertimes. The Colonial period termchamal dzutan(ci-gar of the devil) is interpreted as a comet, but Jesu ́sGalindo (1994 : 111) suggests that when these cigarsare discarded, they are transformed into meteors.The Colonial period Maya dictionaries do not con-tain an entry for meteors, but Ulrich Ko ̈ hler (1989 :295) notes that there are a few entries undercometathat seem to refer to meteors. Among these he in-cludesu halal dzutan(arrow of the devil), which isglossed as ‘‘ignited comet’’ (Lamb 1981 : 245 – 246).Other terms for comets noted by Weldon Lamb in-cludehalal ek(arrow star), referring to a ‘‘comet thatruns’’;kak tamay,glossed as ‘‘carbuncle’’; andkaknoh ek(fire big star), glossed as ‘‘big comet.’’In the Colonial period, the Yucatec Maya associ-ated comets with bad omens (Tedlock 1992b : 180).The contemporary Maya link comets to fire andarrows (Chapter 1). Although the last appearanceof Halley’s comet in 1986 was rather disappointing,the region of these constellations rather than a stargroup conforming to the European definition. Forexample, the constellation we know as Sagittariuswas probably divided into two constellations in Pre-columbian times.This chapter begins with a discussion of tem-porary sky phenomena, including comets, meteors,and supernovas. Subsequent sections focus on im-agery of the stars, the Maya zodiac, and individ-ual constellations, most often connected with ani-mals. Cross constellations are described in relationto specific temple orientations and rituals at Pa-lenque. The following sections focus on the im-agery of the Milky Way, including discussion of theCosmic Monster and Itzamna. The closing sectionplaces Maya astronomy in the context of worldastronomy.COMETS, METEORS, AND SUPERNOVASSupernovas are considered quite spectacular by as-tronomers using modern telescopes, but they arevery transitory events that apparently were not com-monly recorded in the inscriptions. Only one knownClassic Maya date coincides with a historically docu-mented supernova (a.d.393; Justeson 1989 : 104,115). Aveni (1980 : 97) notes that the Crab NebulaSupernova seen in early July ofa.d.1054 was excep-tionally bright; however, it occurred after the LongCount ceased to be recorded on monuments. Norecord of it can be documented in the codices.Comets and meteors were no doubt important tothe ancient Maya, and they may have distinguishedthe two because of their different patterning. Thecycles of comets involve relatively long periods oftime, varying according to the comet involved. Forexample, Halley’s comet reappears approximately ev-ery seventy-six years. Meteor showers, also known asshooting stars, recur in the same constellation at thesame time of year. As annual events, they are morepredictable and therefore less ominous than the re-turn of comets.Since meteor showers emanate from the constel-lation for which they are named, images of them maybe combined with the imagery of their ‘‘parent’’ con-stellation. The Maya may also have linked shooting250STARS, THE MILKY WAY, COMETS, AND METEORS"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"there have been spectacular displays of the comet inthe past, such as the 1910 passage still rememberedby older residents of communities in the Mayan andcentral Mexican area. Ko ̈ hler (1989 : 292) points outthat since the Mexican Revolution followed shortlyafter this comet, the historical events confirmed theancient fears of calamities following comets. Simi-lar notions probably existed in Precolumbian times.Comets, calledcitlalinpopoca(star that smokes) inthe Aztec chronicles, are often linked with the deathof a noble or ruler (Aveni 1980 : 27).The Aztec Codex Telleriano-Remensis representsVenus as a smoking star ina.d.1533, linking Venusto imagery of comets (Aveni 1980 : 27). A Maya textin the Songs of Dzitbalche seems to identify Venusas a smoking star (Edmonson 1982a : 183). Theremay be a natural connection between Venus andcomets. Carlos Trenary (1987 –1988 : 110) points outthat comets are usually first noticed as they approachor recede from the Sun, which positions them closeto Venus. He notes that this may explain why anancient Chinese source states that comets originatefrom Venus.Several unpublished studies have linked the imageof God L smoking a cigar in the Temple of the Crossat Palenque with the passage of Halley’s comet ina.d.684 (Robertson 1991, fig. 43). Although God Lis clearly a Venus god, his cigar could represent acomet. The Hero Twins in the Popol Vuh smoke ci-gars, possibly alluding to a connection with comets.Since the cigar smoking takes place in Xibalba, iden-tified as a southern section of the Milky Way wherethe rift is located, Barbara Tedlock’s (1992b : 181) in-terpretation of the cigars as meteors seems unlikelybecause this is not an area of the sky characterizedby meteor showers.Comets appear in historical records in Asian andEuropean sources that date well before the time ofChrist (Hasegawa 1980, table 1). It seems reasonableto assume that comets would also have been impor-tant in the historical records of the Maya; how-ever, few published studies include interpretationsof comets in Classic period times. Justin Shrove andAlan Fletcher (1984, app. B) compiled a list of com-ets recorded in written records dating froma.d.1to1000 that could be useful in further studies of therole of comets in Classic Maya iconography andcalendrics.David Kelley (1976 : 42, 133, fig. 9) notes that astar glyph prefixed by a man’s head with a tubularpipe in his mouth (at B10) on Tikal Stela 5 may beread asbudz ek(smoking star), a Yucatec term fora comet. The glyph compound is apparently unique,and Kelley was not able to confirm an associationwith a known comet. In the Colonial period, the termbudz ekwas glossed as ‘‘maned comet like the onethat appeared in the year 1577’’ (Lamb 1981 : 245).In sum, temporary celestial events such as cometsand meteors clearly need further study. A rare Mayatext referring to a smoking star evokes connectionswith Aztec descriptions of comets. Comets may becigars smoked by Maya gods; but a discarded cigarcould refer to a meteor, more commonly known asa shooting star. Meteor showers are seasonal events,an association that may help to define their iconog-raphy. Since meteor showers are visualized as arrow-heads and torches, however, it may be difficult todistinguish shooting-star images from imagery re-lated to warfare and fire.IMAGES OF STARSThe Yucatec dictionaries contain a number of meta-phorical terms for stars.Ek(ek’) can refer to a star orthe spots on a jaguar and a deer (Lamb 1981 : 234,241). Indeed, a jaguar skin was the symbol of thestarry sky (Thompson 1972 : 64 n. 1). The ChilamBalam of Chumayel describes a star asu lol akab,‘‘the flower of the night,’’ and refers to the night skyasnicen(hal) caan,meaning ‘‘flowering sky’’ (Roys1967 : 27, 94). Early dictionaries compare a rising starto a plant sprouting (hokol ek;Lamb 1981 : 241).The ‘‘queen of the stars’’ is a firefly (cocay), ac-cording to one Colonial Yucatec source, and firefliesare said to carry ‘‘lights from the stars’’ (Lamb n.d.a).‘‘Firefly’’ is also a ritual term used to refer to a cigaror smoking tube in the Chilam Balam of Chumayel(Roys 1967 : 30, 97). As we have seen, comets are alsocompared to cigars.Stars are the ‘‘eyes of the night’’ in a Postclassicscene from the Madrid Codex (34) interpreted asan astronomer looking out at the night sky (Fig.IMAGES OF STARS251"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"252STARS, THE MILKY WAY, COMETS, AND METEORS"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"7.1a; Aveni 1980, fig. 1). The astronomer’s eyeballstretched from its socket resembles a ‘‘death eye.’’ Hesits in a nocturnal circle surrounded by death eyesrepresenting stars. In the Classic period, disembod-ied eyes and crossed bones represent the night skyand the starry underworld on the Vase of the SevenGods (Pl. 7). Michael Coe (1973 : 83) points out thatthe deities of the underworld and the luminaries ofthe night sky may actually be the same. In this light,‘‘death collars’’ formed by a circle of disembodiedeyes probably represent stars, indicating an associa-tion with both the night sky and the underworld.These death eyes evoke central Mexican images ofstars, represented as a stylized eye bisected by a redlid, as seen in the Death God holding up the nightsky on Codex Borgia 51 (Fig. 7.1b). He wears acrown of stars and his eyes are actually stars.Concentric rings can be used as signifiers for wa-ter or stars, depending on the context. Designsof small circles or rings may be star symbols (Coe1973 : 83, no 37; 1982 : 32, no. 10). The same formsappear in the star glyph (T510f ), which resemblesthe letterWorMframing two rings (Ringle andSmith-Stark 1996 : 303). This form is used as a starglyph in texts and as a symbolic element in imagesrepresenting bright stars and planets. The T510fglyph sometimes shows the starry aspect of an ani-mal constellation (Fig. 7.1i). Venus and other planetsare depicted by a cruciform design framing fourrings (T510b). Occasionally this glyph is used forbright stars, as in the turtle constellation at Bonam-pak (Fig. 7.1k).Individual stars may be represented by birds. To-day the Yucatec Maya say that Theta Taurus ischa-mukuy,the name of a small bird (Sosa 1985 : 341).TheRitual of the Bacabsspeaks of the Ix Ko-ti-tzablocated in the fifth layer of the sky, which is the‘‘ko-bird-in-the-rattles constellation,’’ interpreted asa bird star in the Pleiades (Roys 1965 : 7, 42, 136,155). The Lacando ́ n say that Rigel and Sirius arewoodpeckers (Bruce et al. 1971 : 15), and wood-peckers do appear in starry contexts in Maya art,most notably in imagery of sky bands (Coe 1982 : 32,no. 10; Houston et al. 1992 : 502; Kerr 1992 : 498,no. 4464).In sum, the imagery of stars in PrecolumbianMaya art is still poorly understood. Many designsconventionally interpreted as death eyes may actu-ally represent stars. Birds can also symbolize stars,but their celestial nature is not easily recognized, ex-cept when they are placed on sky bands.

He explains that slippage in the posi-tions of constellations occurs because the table isbased on multiples of 364 days, while the constella-tions reappeared in the same position relative to thehorizon at sunset every 365.25 days. It was necessaryto move the Tzolkin days forward 20 days to bringthem into alignment with the constellations. TheMaya did so by changing the bar-and-dot coeffi-cient. For example, by adding 20 days, 3 Kan wouldbecome 10 Kan (Appendix 3). Thus the observationtime would shift to 20 days later, by which timethe constellation would have reached the appropriateposition on the horizon.Kelley (1976 : 45 –50) proposes that the Paris Co-dex animals represent constellations spaced at 168-day intervals, because the number 8.8 appears be-tween the animals. Given the apparent solar motionin the background of stars of about 17a day, afteran interval of 168 days the Sun is almost halfwayaround the sky, and the next interval of 168 daysbrings it back to a position only 29 days short of thesolar year. This would place the constellations thatare next to one another in the codex at opposite sidesof the sky. Kelley’s proposed zodiac, however, de-parts from the long-standing association betweenthe Pleiades and the rattlesnake among the Maya ofYucata ́ n. He also suggests that the animals biting theeclipse signs refer to eclipse events. The 168-day in-terval is very close to the ‘‘eclipse half-year’’ (173.25days), indicating that the table was probably usedfor eclipse prediction. It also should be noted thatthe table could chart the position of the Moon, be-cause the 168-day interval is halfway between theeclipse half-year and six draconic months (6327.215163.26 days14.745168 days). Furthermore, theaverage between the synodic lunar month and theTHE MAYA ZODIACOur best evidence of formal constellations amongthe Maya comes from a sequence of celestial figuresin the Postclassic Paris Codex (23 – 24), long recog-nized as a form of zodiac representing thirteen stargroups (Fig. 7.2a; Gates 1910 : 31). These same ce-lestial animals also appear in the Madrid Codex,although not in a formal zodiac sequence (Knoro-zov 1982).The Paris Codex table shows five rows of Tzolkindates with red numerals spaced at intervals of 28days (Fig. 7.2a; Appendix 3). The reading order isright to left, as indicated by the ‘‘mirror writing’’with the glyphs facing opposite to the normal direc-tion, a pattern first noted by Eduard Seler (1904b :21). With thirteen dates per row (some now effaced),each row completes a period of 13328 days totaling364 days, a computing year which falls 6.282 daysshort of five sidereal years (H. Bricker and V. Bricker1992 : 152). Five rows constitute five computingyears, equal to 1,820 days or seven complete Tzolkins(73260), bringing the computing year and theTzolkin into renewed alignment.In the upper row, between each zodiac figure,black numbers record intervals of 8.8 in Long Roundnotation (168 days), representing six ‘‘months’’ (6328 days). A similar set was probably recorded below,although there are some perplexing variations in thenotations, including three that seem to record onlythe number eight (H. Bricker and V. Bricker 1992 :158). Alongside the intervals of 168 days, blue-greennumbers record correction factors that serve to re-align the Tzolkin calendar dates with the solar yearand the position of the constellations. Seler (1904b :21) recognized these as factors used to add 20 daysto the Tzolkin dates.

Another interpretation that has not founda following among scholars is Severin’s (1981 : 20, 23)notion that the blue-green numbers are modifyingcoefficients that refer to the Katun cycle.Bruce Love (1994 : 89 –102) notes that, given thedivision of the stars into thirteen constellations, ar-ranging the dates in thirteen sets of 28 days makessense because the average time for one constellationto replace another relative to the horizon is 28 daysforming a sidereal ‘‘month’’ (133285365 days).Like Severin, Love links the turtle with Orion andthe rattlesnake with the Pleiades, and he also pro-poses that the animal constellations represent adja-cent star groups. He maintains, however, that theParis Codex does not represent a true zodiac becausesome of the constellations are beyond the relativelynarrow band of the ecliptic (about 187wide). Lovecompares the layout to the Quiche ́ constellations,and he points out that half of the constellations ob-served by the Quiche ́ are not on the ecliptic. TheQuiche ́ star groups serve as ‘‘signs of the night’’ dur-ing the period of longest visibility, as opposed to ourEuropean zodiac that identifies constellations withthe month of solar conjunction.Harvey and Victoria Bricker (1992) provide anintriguing solution to the layout of constellations inthe Paris Codex. The Brickers note that some pairedconstellations represent adjacent constellations, fol-lowing the principle of a 28-day sidereal month, butothers represent constellations at opposite sides ofthe sky in accord with the 168-day intervals of sixsidereal months, as suggested by Kelley. Tables 7.1and 7.2 reconstruct the associated constellations andthe dates of their positions at both dawn rise anddawn set. The star groups paired from Novemberthrough April in Table 7.2 reproduce the zodiac se-quence. Like Kelley, the Brickers note that the sepa-ration of solar-eclipse glyphs by 168-day (8.8) inter-vals reflects a period close to the eclipse half-year.Nonetheless, the eclipse signs do not show eclipsesin those specific constellations (Harvey Bricker, per-sonal communication 1996).Another form of zodiac is seen in the facade of theNunnery (Las Monjas) at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ . In additionto a series of animals, some with T510f glyphs, thereis a lunar glyph (T683), an Imix glyph, and a T510fglyph standing alone (Fig. 7.2b). Seler 1960 –1961,5 : 228 – 231) proposes that the Nunnery shows Ve-nus represented in a sequence of positions amid thebackground of stars. The order of the constellationsshows that only some overlap with the Paris Codex(Kelley 1976, fig. 14). The Brickers (1992 : 166) notethat the blocks may be out of order, but even re-arranging them, they could find no extensive corre-spondence with the Paris Codex zodiac. There area total of twenty-five different elements in the skyband, twelve of which are variants of the sky glyphand seven correspond to figures in the Paris Codex,including a turtle, a scorpion, a peccary, two birds, asnake, and a skeletal figure (H. Bricker and V. Bricker1992, table 6.3). The skeletal figure is associated withPisces in the Paris Codex. Pisces marked the springequinox in the Classic and Postclassic periods, an in-triguing correlation, given the abundance of skeletalimages in Maya art.A zodiac-like sequence is represented on the northfacade of the Palace of the Stuccoes at Acance ́h, Yu-cata ́ n, dating toa.d.600 –700 (Miller 1991 : 15, pls.3 – 6; Seler 1960 –1961, 5, pl. 11). Animals noted fortheir nocturnal activities, such as the frog, the bat, thefeline, and the gopher, wear eye rings (Miller 1991 :35). Some of the same animals — the bat, the owl,and the rattlesnake — are seen in the Paris Codex(Fig. 7.1d). A spider monkey evokes the monkeyplanet. A howler monkey might be related to theMorning Star in the Dresden Codex. A blue figuremay be the Classic period counterpart of Hunahpu(Miller 1991 : 45). The facade has twenty-one figures,suggesting thirteen constellations grouped with theSun, the Moon, and the planets, possibly with two dif-ferent gods representing the dual aspects of Venus.In sum, there is strong evidence for a zodiac inClassic and Postclassic Yucata ́ n. The Paris Codexzodiac suggests dawn observations made during thedry season. All the constellations are on the eclipticor nearby. The zodiac may refer to the moon’s posi-tion crossing the node, indicating a potential foreclipses at intervals spaced approximately six monthsapart.

Landa notes that the Yucatec Maya ob-served the Pleiades (tzab) to tell the time of night(Tozzer 1941 : 133, 220). Thetzabwere special insig-nia of the priests, who carried a short stick withrattlesnakes’ tails attached to it (Tozzer 1941 : 105).Representations of God D from the codices and inthe murals of Santa Rita show him holding a staffshaped like a rattlesnake (Taube 1992b, fig. 14).The Paris Codex confirms the association betweenthe Pleiades and the rattlesnake in Postclassic times(Fig. 7.2a).TheRitual of the Bacabsdescribes the red Sunwith the snake-rattles constellation, clearly an imageof their celestial conjunction in May (Roys 1965 :147,159).

By this time, their rise coincidedwith the planting season. Today, they disappear inearly May, just prior to the planting.The disappearance of the Pleiades around plant-ing time may be the subject of a legend in the PopolVuh. The Pleiades are the four hundred boys whotrick Zipacna (a crocodile) into digging a hole for agiant post in their house.

As it happens, the width of the Moon isjust sufficient to cover the Pleiades, so there mayhave been a special focus on the relationship betweenthe two.The Pleiades glyph (T207), depicting rattlesnakes’rattles, appears in calendar cycles that are still poorlyunderstood. Kelley (1976 : 253, fig. 89) points outthat the serpent numbers of Dresden Codex 61 areaccompanied by a text with the Pleiades glyph, fol-lowed by a glyph for one pictun equaling 8,000 Tuns.On Dresden Codex 70, glyphs representing a Katunand a Tun are linked with T207 (Fig. 7.1c). EricThompson (1972 : 85) notes that in the same columnthere are calendar entries that still elude inter-pretation. These are preceded by the serpent num-bers on page 69 associated with an interval of morethan 30,000 years. Such large intervals evoke a con-nection with the precession of the equinox (26,000years).My study of Madrid Codex pages 12 –18 showsthat the 260-day calendar on these pages coordinateswith a stellar cycle marked by the changing positionof the Pleiades, which is represented by a rattlesnakethat changes its form and position (Fig. 7.3; Milbrath1980b, 1981). On page 12b, the sequence opens withthe serpent emerging from the sky band. As we willsee in subsequent discussions, the sky band marksthe intersection point of the Milky Way and theecliptic, a crossroads where the Pleiades are located.The sky band is featured because this intersectionpoint is positioned on the eastern horizon aroundthe winter solstice. Indeed, the sky band appearsonly on pages that correspond to times when thecrossroads of the Milky Way and the ecliptic is onthe horizon at dusk. Page 12b marks the beginningof the astronomical year, when the Pleiades wereseen in the east at dusk around the winter solstice.The next six pages represent a fixed 260-day agricul-tural calendar running from February to late Octo-ber. The calendar overlies a sequence of serpents thatshow the movement of the Pleiades over the courseof the planting cycle in the fifteenth century, theepoch of the Madrid Codex. For discussion of thesolar dates and agricultural events, see Chapter 3.The layout indicates that the agricultural calendarbegins in early February on page 13b with the Pleia-des overhead at dusk at the beginning of the fixed260-day agricultural cycle. By the March equinox,the Pleiades are past the meridian at dusk, beginningtheir descent, as seen on page 14b. The sequencecontinues on page 15b, where the Chicchan serpentloses its rattles as a sign that the Pleiades have be-come invisible at dusk at the onset of the rainy sea-son in May. The intersection point of the Milky Wayand the ecliptic touches the western horizon, andthis is why the sky band is represented prominentlyon page 15. And when the crossroads of the eclipticand the Milky Way begins to emerge above the east-ern horizon in late August, the sky band reappearson page 17.

The Chicchanserpents bear serpent markings like the day signChicchan, implying a link with Maya horoscopesthat give the prognostication (mut) for the days Kanand Chicchan asah tzab ti can,meaning ‘‘the rattle-snake rattle in the sky’’ (Lamb n.d.a).The Chicchan serpent, a rain serpent associatedwith agricultural fertility in contemporary Maya ac-counts, may be linked with the Madrid Codex ser-pent, which has a feathered crest and a rattle tail. Itis possible that the Pleiades represented as the rattle-snake’s rattle can be traced back to Olmec times. Asearly as 900 – 400b.c., we see Olmec images of therattler with a feathered crest, as on La Venta Monu-ment 19 (Milbrath 1979, table II, fig. 70).The Chicchan serpent is linked with the day signChicchan and the Pleiades, and it is possible that Ve-nus is also part of the image. The serpent’s rattle tailmay show that the Pleiades are closely related withVenus in its manifestation as a feathered serpent.Karl Taube (1992b : 140, fig. 76e) suggests that theChicchan serpents in the Madrid Codex are one of agroup of ‘‘crested’’ serpents that may be linked withQuetzalcoatl, noting that the serpent aspect of Quet-zalcoatl has a strong connection with water and fer-tility. The rattles certainly represent the Pleiades, butthe serpent might be the counterpart of Quetzalcoatlas the planet Venus. Venus observations may alsohave been coordinated with a 260-day cycle repre-senting the fixed agricultural calendar. Indeed, Dan-iel Flores (1989) finds a direct connection betweenthe 260-day interval and Venus observations. For ex-ample, he notes that counting the average intervalfrom the first appearance of Venus as Evening Starto the last day of visibility gives an average of 259.87days. A link with Venus is also suggested because theMadrid Codex displays the 260-day calendar in fourrows of 65 days, an arrangement convenient for cal-culating Venus events such as heliacal rise dates (Mil-brath 1981 : 277).As noted in Chapter 5, Venus passing by the Ple-iades is a sign associated with rain, for this occursinvariably from mid-March through mid-June. Rainappears as a background in the Madrid Codexserpent sequence because the calendar relates toweather patterns presented in relation to observa-tions of the Pleiades and possibly also of Venus.The Chicchan serpents in the Madrid Codex seem tobe the counterparts of the Chortı ́ Maya Chicchanserpents, especially the northern Chicchan that isthe chief who directs the Chicchans in their rain-making activities (Wisdom 1940 : 393 – 396). IvanSprajc (1993a : 27) suggests that the northern Chic-chan reflects the observed coincidence of Venus innortherly extremes with the onset of the rains. Thenorthern extreme of Venus may have been linkedwith the Pleiades, because they are relatively farnorth on the ecliptic. Furthermore, if we considerPerseus to be part of the serpent constellation, asI proposed in my original study, the constellationextends quite far north.The Chicchan serpent takes a peculiar form inthe Madrid Codex, resembling a hook (Fig. 7.3).This form led me to study stars in the vicinity of thePleiades to see if the serpent’s body could be a nearbystar group. Plotting the movements of Perseus andthe Pleiades shows a good correspondence with thechanging positions of the Chicchan serpent in theMadrid Codex. The Pleiades and Perseus are a natu-ral pair, forming a sort of bent serpent like that inthe Madrid Codex (Aveni 1980, fig. 70; Milbrath1980b, 1981). Yucatec lore describes the Pleiades asthe rattler’s tail, but the Paris Codex zodiac shows thecomplete serpent, indicating a larger constellation.This star group probably included the neighboringstars of Perseus, a constellation to the north of theecliptic with a bright binary star, Algol.FIG. 7.3.Chicchan serpent withtzabtail (‘‘rattlesnake’srattle’’) in sequence showing changing position of Ple-iades in relation to 260-day agricultural calendar andTzolkin at 207latitude ca.a.d.1450.

The accession event was probablyguided by other astronomical events, most notablythe first stationary point of Jupiter (6 /18/776), thesecond stationary point of Saturn (6 /19/776), andthe conjunction of Mars and Venus, when the Eve-ning Star was near its maximum elongation and itsmaximum altitude (Aveni and Hotaling 1994, table 1;Lounsbury 1982 : 159; Meeus n.d.; Schele and Freidel1990 : 446).The Pleiades bag is also represented on Yaxchila ́nStela 18, which has one of the few representationsof thetzabglyph (T207) in the central Maya areaduring the Classic period.

The Long Count corresponds to a datein early July (7/8/729) when the Pleiades were over-head at dawn and Jupiter and Saturn were nearbyundergoing retrograde motion in Pisces. Jupiter andSaturn moved in tandem, reaching their second sta-tionary points together in late October, by whichtime the Pleiades were overhead at midnight. Aglyph for ‘‘sky center’’ appears with the Pleiadesglyph preceding a Katun 5 Ahau expression associ-ated with a fire event (D1-E2; Tate 1992, fig. 145,app. 3).

Chac mounts the Chic-chan serpent in the same way that the five Chacs ridehorses representing different kinds of clouds andweather in modern Yucatec Maya lore (Chapter 5).Indeed, there are five Chacs on pages 12b –18b.In my original study of the Madrid Codex, I sug-gested that Chac may be connected with Gemini,marking the Sun’s position at the onset of heavyrains in June (Milbrath 1980b, 1981). Subsequent re-search points toward Chac having a planetary iden-tity; nonetheless, Chac’s planet could have a stellar‘‘home’’ in Gemini (Chapter 5). Indeed, all the plan-ets probably had astrological ‘‘homes’’ in differentconstellations (Kelley 1985 : 236). Landa reports thatVenus, the Pleiades, and Gemini were the most im-portant bodies observed by the Maya. On page 12b,Chac has the year-sign headdress of Tlaloc A, sug-gesting that he is involved in the eight-year VenusAlmanac, an idealized cycle that brings a Venus eventinto alignment with specific solar, lunar, and stellarevents. Venus passes by Gemini during the rainy sea-son, an association similar to that seen with the Ple-iades. When the Sun enters the Pleiades, it is the timeof the solar zenith when the rains begin in Yucata ́n;and when the Sun enters Gemini, the rains are attheir maximum intensity and the Sun is at its north-ern extreme. Conversely, when Gemini is in opposi-tion to the Sun, visible for the longest period of time,it is the time of the winter solstice. The Pleiades arein opposition to the Sun around the beginning of thedry season in November, the time of the solar nadirin Yucata ́ n.

At this time, the Pleiades wereoverhead at dusk; more significant, Saturn was inconjunction with the Pleiades, an event that wouldrecur approximately every twenty-nine years (oneand a half Katuns).Yaxchila ́ n Lintel 10 has atzabreference associatedwith an 18 Zotz inscription (D8) tentatively recon-structed as 9.18.17.13.10 5 Oc 18 Zotz (4 /3/808; Tate1992, app. 2). This date coincides approximately withthe dusk set of the Pleiades at the latitude of Yaxchila ́nif we presume a slightly raised horizon. At this time,Jupiter was undergoing retrograde motion, and pos-sibly this was also noteworthy in the inscriptions.The Pleiades were also recognized as far west asPalenque, for an inscription on Temple XIV recordsa variant of T207 (Pl. 13; Ringle and Smith-Stark1996 : 292). This glyph is interpreted as a reference tothe apotheosis of Chan Bahlum on 9 Ahau 3 Kankin(9.13.13.15.0; Schele and Miller 1986 : 272). His apo-theosis on 10/31/705 coincided with events involv-ing Jupiter, Saturn, and the Moon (Chapter 6). It isnoteworthy that Saturn, having just passed its firststationary point, was undergoing retrograde near thePleiades.The Yucatec rattlesnake constellation may alsohave been represented in the Pete ́ n during the EarlyClassic at Tikal (Stela 1; Coe 1970 : 92). Tikal Stela 1depicts Stormy Sky framed by feathered standards,with a rattlesnake and a feline climbing the standardon the left, and a fish-snake and a fragmentary figureclimbing on the right. The two standards may rep-resent two sides of the sky, with the Pleiades on oneside and Sagittarius on the other side.In the central and southern Maya area, we wouldexpect to find images linking the Pleiades with san-dals, the Chol name for the Pleiades (Chapter 1).Such imagery is much more difficult to pinpoint, be-cause sandals often appear on royal figures, and noglyphic expression for the wordsandalsis recognizedto date. Arthur Schlak (1989) concludes that jaguar-pelt sandals appear on rulers represented on monu-ments bearing dates related to significant Pleiadespositions. However, since he links any number ofjaguar costume elements with the Pleiades, the anal-ysis is not sufficiently refined to determine whetherjaguar sandals are depicted at a specific time in thecycle of the Pleiades. Also, his sample of figures withjaguar sandals is by no means sufficient to concludethat there is a connection with the Pleiades.Observations of the Pleiades in relation to theSun and Venus are documented in orientations atChiche ́ n Itza ́ . A stairway niche in the Caracol showsan alignment (paralleling Window 1) to the northernextreme of Venus and another to the zenith sunset(Fig. 3.1b). And Window 1 was used to view the Ple-iades in late April as they set heliacally at dusk, beforethe onset of the rains at the time of the first solarzenith in late May (Aveni 1980 : 266, fig. 93). Thewindow has a broad enough opening so that the Ple-iades could be seen setting prior to the zenith sun-set over a relatively long period of time, despite theshift in their setting position from 2887azimuth ina.d.500 to 2907ina.d.1000 (Aveni 1980, table 9).A similar orientation is seen in the doorway of theinner temple in the Upper Temple of the Jaguars(Milbrath 1988b, 1988c). As noted in Chapter 5, thefeathered-serpent columns in the portico of thistemple represent Venus in conjunction with thePleiades, an event that invariably occurs betweenMarch 21 and June 21. This calendric image is re-inforced by the orientation of the temple, whichfaces sunset on April 29, midway between the springequinox and the summer solstice (Chapter 3). Theorientation underscores a connection between theVenus serpent, the Pleiades, and a time of year asso-ciated with the rains to come. The feathered-serpentcolumns with rattle tails also frame the entrance tothe Temple of the Warriors, a structure oriented pre-cisely to the setting Pleiades ina.d.1000 (2907). An-other Pleiades image may appear in the rattlesnakeaccompanying a warrior on the north jamb of thewest doorway of the Castillo (Cohodas 1978, fig. 68).The west face is oriented precisely to the position ofthe zenith sunset (2917) marking the onset of therains (Milbrath 1988c).In sum, the most easily identifiable image of thePleiades is the rattlesnake’s rattle, especially com-mon in Yucata ́ n.

A scene on Madrid Codex 11a shows theold Moon Goddess wearing a scorpion tail, perhapsan image of the Moon in conjunction with Scorpius.Madrid Codex 79a depicts the Venus God L with ascorpion body, suggesting another image of celestialconjunction (Fig. 5.11b).John Carlson (1991) notes that one of the twentydirectional aspects of Venus in the Dresden CodexVenus pages may refer to a scorpion constellation.As noted in Chapter 5, the scorpion constellation isnamed in columns B and C on page 46 of the Dres-den Codex Venus pages (Figs. 5.3a, 5.11c). Thescorpion constellation (B) is linked with day 326and the west, referring to the canonical day the Eve-ning Star would reemerge. In the Postclassic layoutdescribed in Chapter 5, day 326 fell on 5/7/1220,and in Postclassic northern Yucata ́ n this was themonth when Scorpius was visible for the longestperiod of time, making it the ‘‘sign of the night’’(Table 7.2). The list of twenty deities also names theSun, God K (Jupiter), and the five regent gods, in-cluding the Moon Goddess and God N. It may wellbe that the total number comprises thirteen dif-ferent constellations, five planets, and the Sun andthe Moon.In the Classic Period, the scorpion may be por-trayed as a segmented snake with a skeletal snout,only very rarely showing a scorpion stinger, as on Co-pa ́ n Stela A (Fig. 7.1f ). The segmented body recallsrepresentations of the Aztec Xiuhcoatl, a star-snoutedserpent apparently linked with Scorpius (Fig. 7.1g;Milbrath 1980a, 1995b, 1997). The date on Stela A(9.14.19.8.0; 1/28/731) corresponds to a time whenScorpius was overhead at dawn. Perhaps this is whythe Sun God holds the snake over his head.On the west face of Copa ́ n Structure 10L-29, skele-tal snake heads appear in sets of four, framing car-touches that may originally have held solar symbols(Andrews and Fash 1992, fig. 10). The diving figuresat the bases of the cartouches recall imagery of theEvening Star. The skeletal serpent, which LindaSchele (1992b) calls the White-Bone-Snake (formerlythe snaggletoothed dragon), may be an image of Scor-pius, located at the intersection of the Milky Way andthe ecliptic. A background ofS-shaped scrolls evokethe cloudy aspect of the Milky Way (see below).classic Madrid Codex shows a Pleiades calendar cor-responding to the agricultural season. Other codicesshow that longer cycles of time are linked with thePleiades. Both dawn and dusk observations of thePleiades were important in certain Classic Maya in-scriptions and architectural orientations.THE SCORPION AND SKELETALSNAKE CONSTELLATIONSAs noted in Chapter 1, ethnographic accounts givevarying identifications for the scorpion constella-tion: Ursa Major (Tojolabal area in Chiapas), Scor-pius (Tzotzil area in Chiapas and Yucatec area inQuintana Roo), a large constellation running fromGemini to Sirius (Yucatec area southeast of Valla-dolid), and a constellation running from Orion toSirius (Yalcoba ́ in Yucata ́ n). This gives us perhapstoo many options to work with when interpretingMaya images of celestial scorpions.The Colonial period dictionaries from Yucata ́nidentifyzinaan ek(scorpion stars) as the sign ofScorpio (Justeson 1989 : 116; Lamb 1981 : 244; Roys1972 : 96). The Chilam Balam books also list the‘‘black scorpion’’ (ek chuuah) among the stellar dei-ties involved in Katun prophecies (Kelley 1976 : 103;Roys 1967 : 151 n. 3). A centipede labeledch’apat,another form of stinging insect, represents the zodia-cal sign of Scorpio in the Chilam Balam of Kaua(Lamb n.d.a).The layout of the Paris Codex indicates that Scor-pius represents a scorpion constellation in Postclas-sic Yucata ́ n. Although Scorpius appears next to aturtle on the sky band, it is actually at the other sideof the sky, meaning that its seasonal associations areopposite (Fig. 7.2a). At Chiche ́ n Itza ́ , the lintel of theeastern doorway of the Nunnery depicts a text thatshows a celestial scorpion, and the Nunnery at Ux-mal represents the scorpion constellation on a skyband (Fig. 7.2b; V. Bricker and H. Bricker 1995 : 98,figs. 1– 2).We also find a stellar scorpion in the Madrid Co-dex on pages 44 and 48. A series of images show ascorpion holding a rope tied to a deer, suggestingpossibly celestial conjunction with a deer planet orperhaps proximity to a deer star or deer constellation264STARS, THE MILKY WAY, COMETS, AND METEORS"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"At Palenque, there are a number of representa-tions of the skeletal snake. Four skeletal snakes frameKin symbols on the thirteen ancestor cartouches ofHouse A (Fig. 3.4k; Robertson 1985b, figs. 112 –138). Their arrangement radiating from the Sunsymbol is like that of Xiuhcoatl’s framing the Sundisks at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ (Fig. 3.5i). Such images mayshow the Sun in conjunction with Scorpius, reflect-ing the Sun’s position in November at the beginningof the dry season. The Sun God is conceptuallylinked with the White-Bone-Snake in Classic Mayaancestor cartouches, evoking comparison with theimage of Xiuhcoatl framing the Sun God at Chiche ́nItza ́ and that of Xiuhcoatl held by the Aztec solar godHuitzilopochtli (Fig. 3.5i; Milbrath 1980a).The central panel of the Temple of the Sun depictsskeletal snake heads on crossed spears, indicating aconnection with warfare (Fig. 3.6b). The date (1/5/684) directly above corresponds to a time whenScorpius was high above the eastern horizon at dawnwith the morning star (Table 7.2).On Pacal’s Sarcophagus Lid, the skeletal snake isa portal to the otherworld in the Milky Way (Pl. 10;Freidel et al. 1993 : 269 – 270, fig. 6 : 11b). Schele(1992b : 133, 137) notes that the jaws correspond tothe glyph for ‘‘hole’’ in the codices and the glyph forthe five-day Uayeb, and she interprets the creatureas the White-Bone-Snake representing a place oftransformation and an entry to the underworld in therift branch of the Milky Way. I would add that theskeletal snake represents Scorpius in the underworldsection of the Milky Way. The date (8/26 /683) of Pa-cal’s apotheosis recorded on the Sarcophagus corre-sponds to a time when Scorpius was seen high abovethe western sky at dusk, marking the portal to theunderworld in the rift of the Milky Way (Fig. 7.8c).Yaxchila ́ n Lintel 25 also depicts the skeletal snakewith hooked teeth at the end of the snout and a seg-mented body, as on Copa ́ n Stela A, but a secondhead replaces the scorpion’s tail (Fig. 5.8f ). Herethe tail is visualized as a form of jaw, just as the scor-pion stinger around the eclipse glyph in the ParisCodex zodiac substitutes for the animal jaws bitingthe eclipse glyphs seen in the other constellations(Fig. 7.2a). Schele and Miller (1986 : 187 –188, pl. 63)originally designated this snake as a Vision Serpent,but more recently Taube (1992a : 59 – 68) suggeststhat it is a War Serpent linked with a mosaic serpentheaddress seen on the Temple of Quetzalcoatl atTeotihuaca ́ n and worn by warriors in Maya art (Fig.5.6g, Pl. 15). The Yaxchila ́ n snake has a skeletaljaw, suggesting links with the White-Bone-Snake onPacal’s Sarcophagus and on the spears in Palenque’sTemple of the Sun. The ringed designs on the snake’sbody may represent the stars of Scorpius markingthe rift branch of the Milky Way, the underworldroad ofxibalba be(Chapter 1). This section of theMilky Way may be the place where dead ancestorsenter the underworld, and this may be why Lintel 25shows the serpent jaws holding an ancestor with theattributes of Tlaloc, a god who may be linked withVenus. Tlaloc in the serpent’s jaws may represent Ve-nus in Scorpius. On the date carved on Lintel 25 (10/18/681), Venus was visible as the Evening Star pass-ing by Antares, the brightest star in Scorpius. Such aconjunction event during the Classic period tookplace from September through December, overlap-ping with the onset of the season of warfare. Thismay account for the warlike imagery in the scene.Other Yaxchila ́ n images involve what may be sym-bolic pairings rather than actual images of celestialconjunction with Scorpius. On Yaxchila ́ n Lintel 39,for example, a skeletal snake with a segmented bodybears God K (Jupiter) in its jaws, but this pairingdoes not seem to represent conjunction. On therecorded date (9.15.10.0.1; 6 /25/741), Jupiter roseafter midnight and was about to enter retrograde,while Scorpius was at the opposite side of the skyabove the western horizon. Yaxchila ́ n Stela 1 depictsthe Sun God holding a skeletal snake forming a ser-pent bar (Fig. 3.8d). The dates on Stela 1 (2 /14 /760and 3/11/761) do not refer to the Sun in conjunctionwith Scorpius, but the image embodies a link be-tween the dry-season Sun and Scorpius.On Tikal Stela 22, Ruler C at the time of his acces-sion wears a backrack with a cartouche framed byskeletal snakes, resembling the ancestor cartouchesof Yaxchila ́ n and Palenque (Jones 1977 : 36, fig. 3;Tate 1992, fig. 23).

For over one thousandyears Castor and Pollux remained in conjunctionwith the Sun on the summer solstice (Aveni 1980,table 10). Gemini is next to Orion, so they sharesimilar seasonal associations. Orion’s Belt has thebrightest group of three stars in the sky. Orion is po-sitioned overhead when it crosses the meridian inthe latitudes of Mesoamerica. The three stars arevery close to the celestial equator, dividing the sky intwo halves. The belt rotates in an interesting fashion,positioned roughly east to west when rising andnorth to south when setting.The importance of Orion in Quiche ́ cosmology isattested to by a number of temples oriented towardthe setting points of stars in Orion at Utatla ́ n, a Post-classic Quiche ́ site (Freidel et al. 1993 : 103). In thisarea of Mesoamerica, the stars of Orion are seen in atrue zenith position. This may be why they expressthe notion of centrality among the Quiche ́ Maya,who associate Orion with a deity known as Heart ofSky. Juan de Leo ́ n (1945 : 44 – 45) notes that in an-cient times the Quiche ́ linked Orion with Jun Raka ́n(Huraca ́ n or Hunraca ́ n) of the Popol Vuh, an iden-tification supported by Carmack (1981 : 356). Hura-ca ́ n is another way of referring to Hurricane, one ofthe three aspects of Heart of Sky, who appears withthe plumed serpent in the creation epic (D. Tedlock1985 : 72 –75, 341, 343, 365). His aspect as a one-legged god can be deduced from the name Hurri-cane, which means ‘‘1 Leg’’ (hu[n]rakan;Edmonson1971 : 11–12). Hurricanes are also associated withspecific positions of the Big Dipper (see below).The idea of centrality may be seen in the hearth-stones of the home fire in the Popol Vuh, which sym-bolize a triangular group of stars in Orion (Alnitak,Saiph, and Rigel) that form the three celestial hearth-stones still recognized by the Quiche ́ (D. Tedlock1985 : 261). The three stones seem to be mentionedin the creation mythology of the Chilam Balam ofChumayel, which speaks of ‘‘the three-cornered pre-cious stone of creation’’ (Looper 1995 : 24; Roys 1967 :drops seeds or liquid (blood?) from his right hand.Bloodletting is the last event named in the inscrip-tions, just following the date of 11 Kan 12 Kayab(9.16.17.16.4; 12 /23/768). This date is one month af-ter Antares emerged from solar conjunction. At thistime Venus was in Scorpius, an interesting overlapwith the planet’s sidereal positioning on the date re-corded on Yaxchila ́ n Lintel 25, another monumentfeaturing a bloodletting event (Fig. 5.8f ).In Maya vase painting, Scorpius may be repre-sented by a naturalistic scorpion in some contexts.The Blowgunner’s Pot shows Hunahpu shooting abird in a tree with a scorpion at its base (Fig. 3.10k).On the opposite side of the pot, a rattlesnake ap-pears with a ‘‘Cauac cluster’’ on his tail. Somescholars identify the scorpion as Scorpius and therattlesnake as Sagittarius (Freidel et al. 1993 : 102,figs. 2 : 7c, 3 :33; Schele 1992b : 131). They identifythe tree as the Milky Way. I, on the other hand, linkthe tree with stars in Sagittarius that form a sort ofcelestial cross alongside Scorpius (see below). ThePleiades are the rattlesnake’s Cauac tail. The scor-pion is Scorpius positioned at the opposite side ofthe sky. The Calendar Round date on the vessel is1 Ahau 3 Kankin (Coe 1989 : 170). On every repeti-tion of this date during the Late Classic period, Scor-pius was visible near the eastern horizon arounddusk, and by dawn it had moved to the western ho-rizon. Thus the scorpion represents Scorpius on thehorizon.We can conclude that there is strong evidence thatScorpius was visualized as a scorpion in the Post-classic period. In earlier times, scorpion traits maybe seen on a skeletal snake representing Scorpius.Sometimes the snake has a segmented body like ascorpion. The skeletal serpent may be equated withthe War Serpent and the White-Bone-Snake. Certaindates on Classic Maya monuments with the skeletalserpent indicate an interest in significant positions ofScorpius or times when the planets pass throughScorpius. Other images seem to be symbolic repre-sentations, showing the Sun or a solar deity associ-ated with the skeletal snake, perhaps indicating aspecial association between the Sun and Scorpius notunlike that seen later in Aztec art.266STARS, THE MILKY WAY, COMETS, AND METEORS"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"107). On page 71a of the Madrid Codex, a turtle rep-resenting stars in Orion carries three Cauac signs(Fig. 7.1h). These are the ‘‘three stones of creation,’’known as the ‘‘three-stone place’’ in Classic periodinscriptions at Palenque and Quirigua ́ (Freidel et al.1993 : 82 – 83, fig. 2.16; Tedlock 1995 : 119 –120).A constellation known as the fire drill, suggest-ing a connection with the seat of the fire in the threehearthstones of creation, seems to be linked withOrion or Gemini. The Colonial period Motul dictio-nary glossesmehem ek(semen star) as ‘‘theastillejos,a constellation in the sky’’;astillejos(fire drill) is aSpanish term referring to Orion in the Nebrija dic-tionary of the Colonial period (Lamb 1981 : 236,344). Thompson (1972 : 68) says that this fire-drillconstellation refers specifically to Orion’s Belt. Heequates it with the Aztec fire-drill constellation(mamalhuaztli), but this is identified as Castor andPollux of Gemini by Arthur Anderson and CharlesDibble (Sahagu ́ n 1950 –1982, 7 : 60). Alfred Tozzer(1941 : 133 n. 623) says that theastillejosare Gemini.Similarly, modern Spanish dictionaries link the termfire drillwith Castor and Pollux (Lamb 1981 : 237).We must conclude that the fire drill could be locatedin Orion or Gemini. Since they are adjacent in thesky, there could have been some confusion amongthe chroniclers between the astrological ‘‘sign’’ andthe constellation itself. Floyd Lounsbury (1982 : 166)points out that the zodiacal sign of Gemini actuallyincluded the stars of Orion and much of Taurus inthe sixteenth century, for the signs remained fixedwhile the stars shifted with precession. This also mayaccount for different identifications made for theturtle constellation.Landa identifiesac ek(the turtle star) as one ofthe two most important constellations in the Mayacalendar (Tozzer 1941 : 132 –133). Tozzer and otherscholars link Landa’s turtle constellation with Gem-ini (Knorozov 1982 : 204). The Motul dictionarysays thatac ekis a constellation formed by threestars in the sign of Gemini that, with others, make aturtle (Lounsbury 1982 : 166 –167). The Lacando ́nand the Yucatec Maya of Chan Kom also identifythe turtle as Gemini (Chapter 1). On the otherhand, Thompson (1960 : 111, 116) notes that a Yuca-tec Maya informant described the square of Orionthat includes Rigel and Betelgeuse as a turtle con-stellation (ac). Furthermore, the Paris Codex layoutlinks Orion with a turtle and Gemini with a bird(Table 7.1). As noted below, this bird is probablyan owl.As discussed in Chapter 5, the turtle victim onDresden Codex 49 seems to represent Orion settingin opposition to the rising Morning Star in No-vember of 1225 (Fig. 5.3d). Equating the DresdenCodex turtle with a tortoise, Thompson notes thatthe Yucatec Maya say that the tortoise weeps for rain.They recount that when the woods are wet and theearth moist, the tortoise is not seen, whereas whenthe land is thirsty, the tortoise walks about (Redfieldand Villa Rojas 1962 : 207). Apparently, the tortoiseis seen on land when the celestial turtle is prominentat the time of the dry season. Orion has its longestvisibility in December during the dry season (Table7.2). The speared victim on Dresden Codex 49 bearsa title with a seated manikin (T227) that may repre-sent a dwarf (ac) (Thompson 1972 : 64, 69 –70). It ispaired with a turtle-head glyph referring to the turtleconstellation. This turtle head is essentially the sameglyph used for the month Kayab, and both show aKan Cross in the turtle’s eye, which can be seen inthe first glyph at the bottom of page 46 noting 19Kayab (Fig. 5.3a). The glyph for Kayab incorporatesa turtle head that may be linked with the turtle con-stellation (Thompson 1960 : 116).The turtle constellation could also be representedby a turtle head with a water-lily headband. Thisturtle is a logograph forac(ak) in Maya glyphic writ-ing (Houston 1989 : 40). Ralph Roys (1965 : xxii –xxiii) notes thatacis a homonym with five differentmeanings in Yucatec, including a certain grass, aturtle, a boar peccary, a dwarf, and stars in Gemini.Star-marked dwarfs on the Yaxchila ́ n HieroglyphicStep VII of Structure 33 bring to mind the wordplaybetweendwarfand theacstars in Gemini (Tate 1992,fig. 111).

Gemini and Orion,two neighboring constellations, sometimes bear thesame name in Colonial period dictionaries, probablyreflecting a confusion between the European con-stellation and the astrological sign.THE PECCARY CONSTELLATIONWe do not have direct evidence for the peccary con-stellation in Colonial period accounts, but the La-cando ́ n speak of a peccary formed by bright stars inOrion, with nearby stars as the piglets (Chapter 1).The nameacin early dictionaries has caused confu-sion because it is applied to a peccary and a turtle,as well as star groups in both Gemini and Orion, asnoted in the previous discussion. Such confusionmay be why David Freidel, Linda Schele, and Joy Par-ker (1993 : 85, figs. 2 : 15, 2 : 19, 2 : 33) identify Geminias both a peccary and a turtle, and at another pointthey say that Orion is also linked with a peccary.It is noteworthy that modern Maya accounts saythat two collared peccaries convey the Sun on thelong, slow days around the summer solstice (Thomp-son 1967 : 38). This suggests a connection with Gem-ini, marking the summer solstice, or possibly an-other nearby star group. One possible candidate isLeo, based on the layout of the Paris Codex zodiac(Table 7.3). Leo’s brightest star (Regulus) disappearsin conjunction with the Sun a few weeks after thesummer solstice.The Paris Codex zodiac has a partially effaced fig-ure that may be a peccary constellation linked withLeo (H. Bricker and V. Bricker 1992 : 171–172, 178).Although the Brickers originally proposed that Leowas divided into two constellations, it seems morelikely that the frog constellation they identify aswestern Leo actually refers to stars in Cancer (Tables7.1, 7.2; Milbrath 1996a).Two stellar peccaries are painted in the vault ofRoom 2 in Structure 1 at Bonampak (Fig. 7.1i). Fol-lowing the patterning from the Paris Codex zodiac,Harvey and Victoria Bricker (1992 : 178, fig. 6.11)link the Bonampak peccaries with Leo. AlthoughLounsbury (1982 : 166 –167, table 3) does not iden-tify the star peccaries, he reconstructs a battle dateMuluc 17 Mac date (9.15.13.6.9; 10/15/744) with Ju-piter’s first stationary point (10/23/744; Meeus n.d.).At this time, Jupiter passed by Castor and Pollux,which may be represented by the two star dwarfsnext to the ballplayer.Other representations of the turtle constellationappear in Classic Maya imagery. A celestial turtle ap-pears in the sky band on the Nunnery facade atChiche ́ n Itza ́ (Fig. 7.2b). The Bonampak murals de-pict a stellar turtle with three bright stars on its back,calling to mind Orion’s Belt (Fig. 7.1k; H. Bricker andV. Bricker 1992: 177; Freidel et al. 1993 : 80, fig. 2 : 15).The painted pot known as the Resurrection Vasedepicts the Hero Twins (the Sun and the Moon)pouring water on the Maize God as he sprouts froma turtle shell (Fig. 3.11b). Although this turtle is of-ten interpreted as a representation of the earth (Ben-son 1997 : 97; Coe 1989), Schele proposes that it rep-resents stars in Orion and that the Maize God is theMilky Way represented in the form of a tree (Freidelet al. 1993 : 82, fig. 2 : 17). Although I disagree withidentifying the Maize God with the Milky Way, thereis a strong link between the turtle constellation inOrion and the cycle of maize. For thousands of years,the period that Orion (the turtle) was invisible inconjunction with the Sun coincided with the timeof maize planting, and its reemergence in June cor-related with the sprouting maize (Tables 7.2, 7.3).In Mesoamerican latitudes, Orion’s Belt disappearedfrom the sky from April 29 to June 17 arounda.d.0;bya.d.1000 the disappearance interval had shiftedonly slightly, running from May 11 to June 28 in theGregorian calendar (Aveni 1980, table 10). Perhapsthe birthplace of maize is in the turtle constellation,for the Chilam Balam of Chumayel tells us that thetender green maize shoot was born in heaven (Roys1967 : 112).We can conclude that both the Classic and Post-classic Maya linked the turtle and the celestial hearth-stones with stars in Orion. A long-standing associa-tion between the period of Orion’s conjunction andmaize planting can be seen in Classic Maya imagerythat shows maize sprouting from the celestial turtleassociated with Orion.

On theother hand, if the peccaries represent Leo, the vaultcould show the underworld sky on the battle date.Using the 584,283 correlation, the date (7/31/792) isprecisely the day Venus was in inferior conjunction,four days before Venus would rise at dawn (Aveniand Hotaling 1994, table 1). At this time, Venus andthe Sun were positioned in Leo. The star deity aim-ing a spear at the celestial turtle could be Venus, whomust kill the Orion turtle in order to rise at dawnfour days later.We have a great number of peccary images thatcould be identified with the peccary constellation. Acelestial peccary appears in the sky band on the Nun-nery facade at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ (Fig. 7.2b). The WestCourt at Palenque depicts two celestial peccariesframing the aged Sun God, evoking the long days ofsummer when the Sun moves with the celestial pec-caries (Fig. 3.7h). Similar images in portable artshow a peccary with a Kin symbol (Freidel et al.1993, fig. 2 : 19; Hellmuth 1987, fig. 593). One suchvase illustrated by Coe (1973, no. 66) has a peccaryand a deer on opposite sides, suggesting that the twosides symbolize opposite seasons; unlike the slow-moving peccaries, the deer carries the Sun quicklyacross the sky during the winter (Chapter 1). Thedeer constellation remains enigmatic, but it might bethe Hyades, aV-shaped configuration in Taurus thatresembles deer horns.On a peccary skull from Tomb 1 at Copa ́ n, celes-tial ballplayers seated in a cavelike opening appearwith three peccaries that may represent a constella-tion (Fash 1991, fig. 24). Two ballplayers in the cen-ter of the composition are Venus twins, according toClemency Coggins (1986; 1988c : 106, fig. 7). Thepeccaries are arranged at one corner of the compo-sition; at another we see a spider monkey wearing aheadband (a monkey planet?). The spotted felinealongside could be the jaguar moon. A vulture belowcould be a planet or a bird constellation. A deerstanding on the baseline next to a skeletal ballplayerwith deer features evokes imagery of a celestial deer(a constellation or the deer planet?). The skull bearsa 1 Ahau 8 Chen Calendar Round date, but the cor-responding date is not certain, so it is not possible toaccurately reconstruct the astronomical events.Discussing the Vase of the Seven Gods (Pl. 7), Coe(1973 : 107) suggests that the peccary with a deathcollar is a constellation. (But see Taube 1992b, fig.39b.) The 4 Ahau 8 Cumku date may be an anniver-sary of the creation date. This date invariably falls inthe dry season during the Late Classic period. Asnoted in Chapter 6, the Calendar Round anniversaryof 4 Ahau 8 Cumku in December 785 is suggested onstylistic grounds. At this time, Leo was above theMorning Star in the dawn sky, mirroring the posi-tion of the animal over God L’s head on the vase.We can conclude that the peccary constellationprobably represents Leo in the Postclassic period,and possibly also in Classic period times. Anotheralternative is that the peccary relates to Gemini.There are many peccary images in Maya art that maydepict stellar imagery. In any case, the peccary seemsto be a constellation marking the position of the Sunduring the summer.BIRD CONSTELLATIONSBirds, the paramount rulers of the sky, representplanets, constellations, and individual stars in Mayacosmology — but it is difficult to sort out which iswhich. Our best evidence for bird constellationscomes from the Paris Codex zodiac, where Harveyand Victoria Bricker (1992 : 171, table 6.5) identifythree different bird constellations. Bird 3, a fragmen-tary bird to the left on the upper row, probably de-picts Capricorn (Fig. 7.2a; Table 7.1). Gemini is rep-resented by Bird 2, a form of owl in the upper band.Bird 1, all but effaced on the far right in the upperrow, is linked with Libra.One of the partially preserved birds in the zodiacBIRD CONSTELLATIONS269"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"one of the two other zodiac birds that represent Libraand Capricorn.CROSS CONSTELLATIONS ANDSTELLAR TREESBirds naturally bring us to trees and their celestialcounterparts — stellar crosses. Cosmic crosses andcelestial trees representing cross constellations ap-pear in ethnographic accounts (Chapter 1). Amongthe Lacando ́ n, the Southern Cross is a ceiba tree,the place where souls of the dead ascend to heaven(Bruce 1979 : 155). Colonial period records tell usthat the Yucatec Maya believed that the ceiba shadedthe souls of the dead in a land of milk and honey(Thompson 1970b : 301). Among the Yucatec Maya,the ceiba is represented by a wooden cross paintedgreen (Sosa 1989 : 137). Although not explicitly de-scribed as astronomical, these crosses may be asso-ciated with stellar crosses imbued with Christian im-agery. The Yucatec Maya say that the Southern Crossiscruz ek(cross star), representing the cross of Jeru-salem at the southern edge of the world (Redfieldand Villa Rojas 1962 : 206; Villa Rojas 1945 : 150,156). A location in Jerusalem is implied by the de-scription of the Quiche ́ cross constellations, becauseas ‘‘thieves’ crosses’’ they flank Christ’s cross atCalvary.The Quiche ́ of Momostenango, in the departmentof Totonicapa ́ n, identify two thieves’ crosses; one isthe Southern Cross and the other is in Sagittarius(Tedlock 1992a : 29). These two stellar crosses arein the Milky Way in the southern sky. Because theSouthern Cross is visible exclusively during the rainyseason, it is called the rainy-season thieves’ cross(B. Tedlock 1985 : 83). The dry-season thieves’ crossis a seven-star asterism in Sagittarius. Judith Rem-ington (1977 : 85 – 87) collected data on three crossconstellations found among the Quiche ́ in the de-partment of Quetzaltenango and among the Cakchi-quel in the department of Guatemala. One is theSouthern Cross; the second is a star cross centeredon the delta star in Sagittarius — two identificationsthat apparently overlap with the two Quiche ́ constel-lations recorded in Momostenango — and a thirdcross was recorded by Remington but remains un-could be a vulture, which appears prominently in as-tronomical contexts. On Dresden Codex page 36b, avulture perches on a starry snake that may depict Ve-nus, perhaps representing the planet in conjunctionwith a vulture constellation (Fig. 5.4b). Similarly, avulture perches on a star or Venus symbol in theNunnery sky band at Chiche ́ n Itza ́ (Fig. 7.2b).In the Paris Codex zodiac, Bird 2 representingGemini is an important constellation because it is the‘‘sign of the night’’ in December, the month of thewinter solstice, and at the summer solstice it is inconjunction with the Sun. It is also the only zodiacbird sufficiently well preserved in the Paris Codex todiscuss in terms of iconography. The Brickers followSeler (1960 –1961, 4 : 642) in describing the bird asthecoxbird, a black pheasant in the Motul dictio-nary (Tozzer 1941 : 202 n. 1115), but Bird 2 is clearlyan owl. Its mottled feathers and tuft of head feathersare traits of owls found in Mexico, such asBubo vir-ginianusorOtus asio.Stars on the tail identify Bird 2as a nocturnal creature. The brightest twin stars in thesky, Castor and Pollux in Gemini, probably evokedthe owl’s eyes. Love (1994, fig. 10.7) identifies theParis Codex owl as the Maya Muan bird, named afterthe bird representing the month Muan. Thompson(1960 : 114 –115) says that the Muan bird is a Yuca-tecan horned owl or a screech owl, both character-ized by tufts of feathers on the head. He notes thatthe Muan bird often is represented on or above thecelestial dragon. The Paris Codex (10) also depicts asimilar bird, a symbol of Katun 12 Ahau, identifiedby Taube (1987) as the Muan bird representing ascreech owl or a horned owl, a companion of God L(‘‘Moan owl’’ in Taube 1992b : 85). On the otherhand, Nikolai Grube and Linda Schele (1994 : 10 –12)identify the Muan bird as a hawk and God L’s com-panion bird as thekuyowl, a Ferruginous PygmyOwl (Glaucidium brasilianum) associated with war-fare in the Classic period. Chapter 5 presents evi-dence linking God L’s owl to Mercury.In sum, there are multiple birds represented inthe Paris Codex zodiac, and clearly we have a wealthof possible bird constellations. Bird 2 is an owl asso-ciated with Gemini. The relationship of this bird tothe bird representing the month Muan and to GodL’s owl is not yet clear. A vulture may be linked with270STARS, THE MILKY WAY, COMETS, AND METEORS"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"identified. Although the Northern Cross is not men-tioned in ethnographic accounts, its cross configu-ration is easily seen in the sky (Fig. 7.8b, northwest).It is clearly important in the orientation of a templeat Palenque.In light of the imagery of cross constellations inthe Quiche ́ area, it is noteworthy that a Protoclassicsculpture from Santa Cruz de Quiche ́ in Guatemala(now in the National Museum of the American In-dian [9/6718]) depicts a crosslike form with circulardesigns that probably represent stars. On the crosswe see a zoomorphic head with a mirror brow, along front tooth, and scroll eyebrows; the head restson a bound bundle with trilobe ends, not unlike thependant worn by astronomical gods.Seventh-century Classic Maya monuments fromPalenque also seem to represent cross constellations.Two magnificent tree-crosses are found in the CrossGroup at Palenque (Pls. 11–12). These images seemto represent stellar crosses. The orientations of theTemple of the Cross and the Temple of the FoliatedCross help reveal the nature of these celestial crosses.The alignment of the temples indicates an interest incelestial crosses located at northern and southernsections of the Milky Way. The Temple of the Crossis oriented toward the southwest to an azimuth of2117458(Aveni and Hartung 1979, table 1, fig. 1).With a mountainous horizon like that on the southside of Palenque, Beta Crucis in the Southern Crosscould be seen setting through the doorway of the in-ner sanctuary (with a horizon elevation of 37, BetaCrucis set at 2117078circaa.d.500; Aveni 1980,table 9). The Temple of the Foliated Cross has a3127308azimuth facing toward the northwest, wherethe horizon is relatively flat, but the sight line passesover the Temple of the Sun, artificially raising thehorizon. Thus the temple is aligned toward the set-ting point of Deneb, the brightest star in the North-ern Cross (with a horizon elevation of 37, Deneb setat 3127488circaa.d.500; Aveni 1980, table 9). Giventhese associations and the importance of cross con-stellations today, we can conclude that the Templeof the Foliated Cross is a temple dedicated to theNorthern Cross, and the Temple of the Cross is dedi-cated to the Southern Cross.The principal themes of the panels in the Templeof the Cross and the Temple of the Foliated Crossare heir designation and accession. Both temples de-pict the heir apparent, young Chan Bahlum, in hisbloodletting costume (Pls. 11–12). Although eventsin Chan Bahlum’s life seem to be linked with Jupiter’sretrograde motion, as noted in Chapter 6, star posi-tions also seem to be significant in the dates selectedfor these events. Schlak (1996) notes that the heir des-ignation on 6 /12 /641 (9.10.8.9.3) coincided with thesunset rise of Deneb (Alpha Cygnus), the brighteststar in the Northern Cross. And the accession date (1/5/684; 9.12.11.12.10) can be linked with Deneb’s riseat dawn. Although not noted by Schlak, the South-ern Cross also shows a relationship with the heir-designation and accession dates. The Southern Crosswas crossing the meridian above the mountainoussouthern horizon at dusk on the heir-designationdate ina.d.641. And some forty years later, theSouthern Cross was again positioned above thesouthern horizon at dawn at the time of Chan Bah-lum’s accession ina.d.684.The tree-cross in the Temple of the FoliatedCross, actually a maize plant, seems to be linked tothe Northern Cross, whereas the one in the Templeof the Cross symbolizes the Southern Cross. In theTemple of the Cross, Chan Bahlum’s heir-designa-tion date (9 Akbal 6 Xul) is inscribed above theyoung ruler, who faces a celestial tree representingthe Southern Cross. His temple is aligned so that theSouthern Cross was seen from the inner sanctuaryaround dusk when Chan Bahlum was designatedheir on 6 /12 /641 (Pl. 12). The Temple of the Foli-ated Cross faces the setting position of the NorthernCross when Chan Bahlum was crowned king on1/5/684 (Deneb set at dusk on 1/25/500 N.S., at217N latitude; Aveni 1980, table 10). In this temple,the accession date associated with the mature ChanBahlum is clearly the main focus, because the heir-designation date is not even represented with theyoung Chan Bahlum (Pl. 11). At the time of his ac-cession, King Chan Bahlum faces a celestial crossrepresenting the Northern Cross as a maize plant.At age forty-nine, the newly crowned Chan Bah-lum is metaphorically compared to a mature maizeplant, for the foliated cross is a maize plant with itsears doubled over in preparation for harvest.

The cosmic power of this constel-lation streamed into the inner temple just beforesunrise on the January accession date. Stars in Sag-ittarius form a cross constellation described in con-temporary Maya accounts as centered on delta Sag-ittarius, equivalent to the bow in the Sagittariusarcher’s hand (Fig. 7.8a, lower center).In the Temple of the Sun, a celestial cross is sug-gested by the crossed spears (Fig. 3.6b). As notedearlier, the spears bear skeletal snakes that may sym-bolize Scorpius, a constellation adjacent to Sagit-tarius. Since only part of Sagittarius is seen as a ce-lestial cross today, it seems that the constellationmay have been divided into two different asterismsin times past. The rest of Sagittarius may be rep-resented by a fish-snake serpent bar below, thecounterpart of the fish-snake in the Paris Codex(Fig. 7.2a). The Temple of the Sun depicts God Lsupporting a zoomorphic bar that bears two heads ofa shark monster known as Xoc, one at either end. AsAndrea Stone (1992) points out, zoomorphic barsare often referred to as thrones because people sit onthem, but they actually represent supernatural lo-cales. In this case, the Xoc zoomorph evokes the fish-snake in Sagittarius located adjacent to the celestialcross in Sagittarius, probably represented by thecrossed spears.Stellar imagery is also prominent in an importantimage of apotheosis in the Temple of the Inscrip-tions at Palenque, a pyramid that houses the tombof Chan Bahlum’s father, Pacal II. As noted in Chap-ter 6, Pacal’s apotheosis as God K coincided with Ju-piter’s first stationary point (8/28/683). Instead ofdescribing a death event, the text says ‘‘he enteredthe road,’’ referring to an astrologically timed apo-theosis. As noted earlier, the giant maw framing GodK and his celestial tree is none other than the skeletalsnake embodying Scorpius, the entry to the MilkyWay — thexibalba bein the southern sky (Pl. 10).The cosmic tree on the Sarcophagus Lid shows acontext for Pacal’s apotheosis. The tree has similarattributes to the one in the Temple of the Cross, alsomaize is ripe and ready to serve as food for thepeople, just as the ruler is mature and ready to servethe people. The metaphor extends into the sky,bringing the stars into play. At the time of ChanBahlum’s accession in January of 684, the NorthernCross stood erect over the horizon to the northwestat dusk, and its light streamed into the inner cham-ber of the Temple of the Foliated Cross. Thus theNorthern Cross is the embodiment of the maturemaize drying on the stalk in January. Indeed, theNorthern Cross itself has bent arms, just like thebent maize ears on a dried stalk ready for harvest.The foliated cross reflects the image of the NorthernCross on the horizon, just as the cross in the Templeof the Cross mirrors the Southern Cross as it makesits brief transit across the sky. The two structurespresent a perfect harmony between temple orienta-tion, iconography, and dated events signaling two ofthe most important ceremonies in the reign of ChanBahlum.272STARS, THE MILKY WAY, COMETS, AND METEORSConnecting royal rituals to the position of a con-stellation may seem to be fanciful to some people,but here again we have to turn to the modern Mayafor instruction. The Cakchiquel of Chinautla stillsend young boys out when they turn six or seven tofight for the stars of a cross constellation called theThieves’ Dagger so that they will gain the properskills to become an adult (Remington 1977 : 87). Itseems more than coincidence that at six years of age,the young Chan Bahlum is shown with a cross con-stellation in a ceremony to make him ready to as-sume his proper role as the future king.A third structure in the Cross Group at Palenquesignals a relationship with a cross constellation. Inthe Temple of the Sun, Chan Bahlum’s accession dateis the focus of the imagery because it is placed in thecenter of the composition (Fig. 3.6b). His accessiondate was timed by Jupiter’s departure from its secondstationary point, and Jupiter may be represented bythe God K manikin held by the ruler on the right(Chapter 6). As in the case of the other temples ofthe Cross Group, the iconography of the Temple ofthe Sun bears a relationship to the temple’s align-ment. The accession date tells us the day of observa-tion, and the orientation tells us where to look onthe horizon. The time of observation is most prob-"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"depicting the Quadripartite God at the base. As wewill see, the skeletal Quadripartite God may repre-sent the place where the ecliptic crosses the MilkyWay at its southern extreme. The imagery suggeststhe tree is the Southern Cross located in the south-ern sky on the southern part of the Milky Way, wherethe souls of the dead ascend. Among the Lacando ́n,the Southern Cross is a stellar ceiba, which the deadclimb to reach heaven. In light of contemporaryMaya beliefs that the souls of the dead become stars(Thompson 1960 :85), it may be that the stars of theMilky Way were seen as the spirits of the dead trav-eling along the soul’s road.In sum, cross constellations seem especially im-portant in the imagery of seventh-century rulers atPalenque. Study of the Sarcophagus Lid suggeststhat the deceased Pacal entered the Milky Way nearScorpius and ascended to heaven on the SouthernCross to reach his planet Jupiter. The imagery, dates,and orientations of Chan Bahlum’s temples indicatespecific associations with cross constellations repre-senting world trees located in the Milky Way. ChanBahlum stands in the Temple of the Foliated Crossalongside an image of the Northern Cross, a giantmaize plant representing a cosmic tree that bestoweda blessing on his reign at his accession in January ofa.d.684. In a like fashion, at his heir designationwhen he was six years old, he appears with theSouthern Cross, another cosmic tree, but this onein the Temple of the Cross. This temple focuses onthe heir-designation date in June, and it is orientedto the Southern Cross setting at this time, whereasthe Temple of the Foliated Cross focuses on the ac-cession date in early January when the NorthernCross could be seen setting from the temple interior.The accession event is also featured prominently inthe Temple of the Sun, but here the temple is ori-ented to a third celestial cross in Sagittarius that roseat dawn in January. Like the other two temples, thecentral image here can be related to a cross constel-lation in the Milky Way.THE NORTH STAR AND THE ‘‘DIPPERS’’Precession brought Polaris to the position of a truePole Star for the Northern Hemisphere in medievaltimes. Today it still remains the pivot of the sky fix-ing the north point. Its elevation above the horizoncan be used to determine latitude. At 157latitude,Polaris is approximately 157above the horizon. Itis so low on the horizon in tropical latitudes ofMesoamerica that in mountainous regions it wouldbarely be visible. The best place for observing thePole Star in the Maya area is northern Yucata ́n,where the flat horizon gives optimum visibility. In-deed, it may be that some rare north-facing struc-tures in this area were used for such observations,the most notable being Structures 1 and 2 in theNorthwest Quadrangle at Uxmal (Aveni 1980, app.A; Aveni and Hartung 1986, table 1).Some Yucatec dictionaries of the Colonial periodnamexaman ekas ‘‘star of the north’’ and ‘‘guide ofthe merchants,’’ referring to the North Star (Polaris)in Ursa Minor; others use this term to refer to thewhole constellation, glossing it as ‘‘guards of thenorth’’ (Lamb 1981 : 243).Chimal ek(shield star) isthe ‘‘star of the north’’ (Polaris) in Yucatec dictionar-ies, but this name sometimes also applies to UrsaMinor and neighboring stars (D. Tedlock 1985 : 330).Paul Schellhas (1904 : 20) originally identified GodC of the codices as the North Star, and this interpre-tation is still repeated today (Coggins 1988a : 140;Galindo 1994 : 100; Sharer 1994 : 535). Schellhaspoints out that the glyph for north has a face thatresembles God C, but he also notes that on DresdenCodex pages 29c – 30c, all four directions are asso-ciated with the God C head (Schellhas 1904 : 21).Similarly, on the Rı ́o Azul tomb, God C appears as-sociated with all four directions (Fig. 3.2b). Taube(1992b : 27) points out that God C never serves as themain sign for north in the Dresden Codex, the mostcarefully painted of the Maya manuscripts. Kelley(1976 : 630) notes that God C’s role as a representa-tive of the North Star seems highly questionable. InChapter 6, God C is identified as a monkey planet.Perhaps he is also lord of the four directions.Schele (1990 : 151–152, fig. 9.7) also proposes thatPolaris is mentioned in Classic period mythologicaltexts in the Temple of the Cross at Palenque (Pl. 12).She identifies the date 13 Ik 0 Chen as a creationevent in 3112b.c.linked to a Long Count set at thebeginning of the epoch (1.9.2). She suggests that anTHE NORTH STAR AND THE ‘‘DIPPERS’’273"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"per’s descent in the dusk sky marks the beginning ofthe hurricane season, just as its rise marks the onsetof the dry season.In terms of astronomy, it is noteworthy that theBig Dipper has been linked with Principal BirdDeity, an alter ego of God D named Itzam-Yeh (Frei-del et al. 1993 : 79, 89, 112, 449, fig. 2 : 13; D. Tedlock1985 : 90 – 91). Tedlock interprets a Classic periodscene showing the Hun Ahau twin killing the Prin-cipal Bird Deity as the death of Vucub Caquix(Fig. 3.10k). Elizabeth Benson (1997 : 91– 92) tenta-tively identifies the Principal Bird Deity as a KingVulture. She notes that Vucub Caquix is the ances-tor of the scarlet macaws, but his representation inthe Classic period is complex and partly vulturine.Vucub Caquix loses a tooth in the Popol Vuh, whichsuggests a connection with a modern Maya accountthat describes how King Vulture was forced to giveup the Moon when the Sun caused him to have atoothache (Benson 1996 : 311– 312). On the otherhand, Nicholas Hellmuth (1987 : 365) reaches theconclusion that the Principal Bird Deity is not VucubCaquix, but is instead a hawk mentioned in a secondshooting incident of the Popol Vuh.We can conclude that the identification of north-ern stars and constellations in Precolumbian Mayaart remains elusive. The Colonial period Yucatecsources provide some evidence to suggest that theLittle Dipper or Polaris was visualized as a shield, butno direct connection with Precolumbian Maya im-agery has been demonstrated to date. The often-repeated notion that God C represents the NorthStar is untenable. Identifications of the Big Dipperamong the Precolumbian Maya are by no meansconclusive, despite recent research linking this stargroup to Vucub Caquix and to the Principal BirdDeity.CENTRAL MEXICAN IMAGESOF THE MILKY WAYThe Aztecs of central Mexico visualized the MilkyWay as a white road created when Tezcatlipoca andQuetzalcoatl walked across the sky (Historia de losmexicanos por sus pinturas1973 : 32). TheHistoriade Me ́xico(1973 : 105) says that Tezcatlipoca andexpression she translates as ‘‘entering or becomingthe sky’’ (och ta chaan) is paired with the establish-ment of a house named ‘‘raised up sky of the north’’(wakah chaan xaman), translatingwakas ‘‘some-thing raised on high’’; however,wakmore com-monly refers to the number six. She proposes thatthis image refers to lifting up the sky from the sea,withxamanreferring to the sky pivoting around Po-laris. This interpretation remains highly speculative,and the text may alternatively be translated as ‘‘sixsky in the north.’’Linda Schele and Mary Miller (1986 : 277) suggestthat the clustering of burial sites to the north of Tikaland the north-facing burials at Palenque indicatethat the ancestral dead rose to occupy the north sky.Be that as it may, it seems clear that the dead enteredthe sky to the south, in thexibalba besection of theMilky Way (see below).Surprisingly, terms for the Big Dipper or UrsaMajor do not appear in Colonial period Yucatec dic-tionaries, except for an erroneous reference tochimalekas Ursa Major. Lamb (1981 : 243, 245) proposesthat Ursa Major is linked with the starry ball-courtconstellation calledekel ek(darkness stars), glossedas ‘‘game of ball.’’ Modern Yucatec references to theBig Dipper or Ursa Major as the ‘‘seventh sacra-ment’’ seem to link the Big Dipper to the Catholiclast rites performed just before death (Redfield andVilla Rojas 1962 : 206). Another Yucatec term forUrsa Major,noria ek(water wheel star), also clearlyrefers to Postconquest imagery, naming a Europeaninvention.Quiche ́ Maya dictionaries identify Ursa Major asVucub Caquix, meaning ‘‘seven macaw’’ (Alvarado1975 : 73;gucup cakixin Leo ́ n 1954 : 33). Dennis Ted-lock (1985 : 36, 91, 330, 360) says that Vucub Caquixis the Big Dipper, a seven-star configuration in UrsaMajor. In the Popol Vuh, Vucub Caquix moves up ina tree to proclaim himself as the Sun, but Hunahpushoots him down, ending his reign as the false Sun.His wife is Chimalmat, a Nahua-derived name thatTedlock notes is linked withchimal ek,a name forUrsa Minor, a constellation close to the Big Dipper.A calendar regulated by positions of the Big Dippermay be implied in the ascent and descent of VucubCaquix, for Tedlock (1991) notes that the Big Dip-274STARS, THE MILKY WAY, COMETS, AND METEORS"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Ehecatl made the heavens by entering the earth god-dess (Tlalteutl) and joining together to form a lowheaven, which the other gods helped them raise up.The next year, the stars were created, including theMilky Way, represented as a male and female pairknown as Citlaltonac (where the stars shine) andCitlalicue (star skirt). In both accounts, the worldwas restored after a great flood, and the sky had tobe raised before the Milky Way was created in theworld age of the Aztecs. This was the epoch of thefifth sun, for the destruction of the world had beenrepeated four times. In another account, however,the Milky Way creation sequence is reversed, forQuetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca are among the manydivine children of Citlalicue (Gonza ́ lez Torres 1975 :130). The gods were born when Citlalicue gave birthto a stone knife that she threw to earth. Although theMilky Way has a male and female aspect, Citlalicueis most often named by herself in legends and invo-cations referring to the Milky Way (Gonza ́ lez Torres1975 : 129 –133).On Codex Vindobonensis 47b, Ehecatl-Quetzal-coatl holds up a band of celestial water on a skyband with Venus glyphs, possibly alluding to theMilky Way as a celestial river (Fig. 5.4g). And Co-dex Vindobonensis 48 shows Quetzalcoatl emerg-ing through a cleft opening in a sky band with Ve-nus glyphs in a scene representing his rebirth in theheavens (Fig. 5.4f; Milbrath 1988a : 158 –159). Theimage of Quetzalcoatl emerging through a cleft skyband parallels scenes in the Codex Borgia (29 – 46)that show Quetzalcoatl passing through a sky bandforming the body of a figure that Karl Nowotny(1976) describes as a sky goddess (Fig. 7.4a – b). Ihave identified this goddess as the Milky Way, notingthat she is probably the counterpart of the MilkyWay goddess known as ‘‘star skirt’’ (Citlalicue) inAztec mythology (Milbrath 1988a : 160 –164; 1989).The goddess bears stars and Venus signs, much likethe sky bands in Mixtec codices. The cleft in herbody marks the place where the ecliptic crosses theMilky Way, which is also the place where the Ve-nus deity, Quetzalcoatl, is reborn (Milbrath 1988a;1989). A similar construct appears in the imageryof Chiche ́ n Itza ́ (Fig. 5.5f – g). Here the featheredserpent emerges from the abdomen of an elon-gated goddess. Taube (1992b : 129 –131) links theseChiche ́ n Itza ́ murals with a myth in theHistoria deMe ́xico(1973 : 108) that describes how Tezcatlipocaand Quetzalcoatl tore apart the earth goddess bytransforming themselves into two great serpents andsqueezing the earth in the middle. The myth statesthat her lower body rose up to the sky — hence thecelestial associations of this goddess are quite appro-priate. In the murals, her body is covered with blue-green jade disks, implying a shiny quality, for jadesparkles like water. In central Mexican imagery, jadesymbols appear in representations of water, but theymay also allude to stars in some contexts.We can conclude that in some Aztec accounts,Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca are responsible for cre-ating the Milky Way, variously described as a celestialroad, a divine star couple, or, more specifically, a starskirt. In others, the goddess of the Milky Way givesbirth to Quetzalcoatl, Tezcatlipoca, and a multitudeof other gods. Central Mexican and Mixtec codicesshow Venus-Quetzalcoatl positioned at the intersec-tion of the ecliptic and the Milky Way. Quetzalcoatlemerges from the abdomen of a star-skirted goddessof the Milky Way in the Codex Borgia, suggestinga form of celestial rebirth. At Chiche ́ n Itza ́ , centralMexican influence is evident in images that show thefeathered serpent emerging from the elongated bodyof a sky goddess who may represent the Milky Way.Mixtec scenes show the rebirth of Quetzalcoatl as heemerges from a cleft in a sky band that probablyshows where the ecliptic crosses the Milky Way. Inother scenes, the Venus deity holds up sky watersthat may be the Milky Way.THE COSMIC MONSTERAND THE MILKY WAYA zoomorph that Andrea Stone (1985) dubbed theCosmic Monster sometimes has an elongated sky-band body that evokes a link with the central Mexi-can goddess of the Milky Way (Fig. 7.4a – b). OnParis Codex 22, the ecliptical cord crosses over thesky-band body of the Cosmic Monster, serving as asky rope connecting six deities, among which wefind two death gods and four gods representingdifferent aspects of God N (Fig. 7.4c). AnotherTHE COSMIC MONSTER AND THE MILKY WAY275"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Postclassic image from the Dresden Codex shows theCosmic Monster with reptile skin, a sky-band body,and deer feet (Fig. 7.4d). The monster is positionedat the top of the composition, like sky bands in Clas-sic Maya art. In Classic period representations, Frei-del, Schele, and Parker interpret the Cosmic Monsteras the Milky Way monster, but they identify the skyband as the ecliptic bearing symbols of planets andconstellations (Freidel et al. 1993 : 67, 422 n. 34).On the other hand, a number of scholars have sug-gested that the sky band is the Milky Way (Galindo1994 : 103; Robertson 1985a : 27). Both interpreta-tions have an element of truth because the sky bandrefers to the place where the ecliptic crosses theMilky Way.My study of the Paris Codex zodiac layout indi-cates that all the constellations suspended from thesky band are either on the Milky Way or at the edgeof the Milky Way (Figs. 7.2a, 7.6; Table 7.1). The sec-ond group of constellations, suspended from a whiteband with zigzag lines (the ecliptical cord?), consistsof constellations on the ecliptic that are not near theMilky Way. The image of the sky band as the placewhere the ecliptic crosses the Milky Way is con-firmed by independent analysis of the Dresden Co-dex Venus pages, where the Sun, the Moon, andplanets crossing the Milky Way are represented asgods on sky-band thrones (Chapter 5).The Cosmic Monster with a sky-band body ap-pears at the top of various stelae at Yaxchila ́ n (Ste-lae 1, 4, 10; Figs. 3.8c, 4.2i; Tate 1992, fig. 130).Stela 1 represents the Cosmic Monster with the samehead at either end of a sky-band body. Serpent barsheld by Classic Maya rulers take a similar form.David Stuart (1984 : 15) suggests that these double-headed serpent bars may be images of the MilkyWay. The Milky Way is clearly related to serpent im-agery in contemporary Maya accounts (Chapter 1;Girard 1949 : 458). The Cosmic Monster incorpo-rates serpent imagery, but it also seems to includeother animals.The Cosmic Monster has a variety of body forms,most often covered with reptile skin bearing a skyband or scrolls (cloud symbols), or more rarely netmarkings (Fig. 7.5a – e; Stone 1983 : 171–173). Thenet design could be stylized reptile skin or it mayrefer to an actual net, recalling a Maya myth that al-ludes to a net of fish transformed into the Milky Way(Chapter 1). If a watery context is implied, the allu-sion may be to the Milky Way as a celestial river orocean, as seen in the Codex Vindobonensis (Fig.5.4g). The Cosmic Monster overlaps in some sensewith the Cauac Monster (Stone 1983 : 186). Cauacmarkings, like an inverted pyramid of beads, havebeen variously interpreted as a symbol of rain orstorm (Thompson 1960 : 89), but more recent inter-pretations of the Cauac Monster suggest that he isthe Witz Monster symbolizing the mountains (Stu-art, cited in Fash 1992 : 92, figs. 4 –5).The Cosmic Monster on Copa ́ n Structure 22 iscovered with cloud symbols, which are related to thecloudy aspect of the Milky Way (Fig. 7.5d).

Seven supernatural figures along the bodyprobably represent the Sun, the Moon, and fiveplanets (Chapter 6). Such figures are described as‘‘cloud-riders’’ by Proskouriakoff (1993 : 98, 185 –187, 192). TheseS-shaped scrolls are usually de-scribed as clouds or smoke (Andrews and Fash 1992 :74; Reilly 1996). The scrolls have also been inter-preted as blood (Stuart 1988). In my opinion theyrepresent a cloudy aspect of the Milky Way. Starsymbols interlace with two of the scrolls coveringthe body of the Cosmic Monster on Copa ́ n Struc-ture 22.Although anS-shaped scroll in a beaded frame(T632) has commonly been interpreted as a cloud,based on an image in the Dresden Codex that showsit as a source of rainfall (Fig. 7.4f ), we cannot besure that this is the only meaning for this symbol.The Cosmic Monster embodying an aspect of theMilky Way also seems to be a source of rainfall orcelestial water (Figs. 5.7g, 7.5a). Furthermore, an Ol-mec petroglyph from the Preclassic epoch suggeststhat rain clouds and theS-shaped scroll were distin-guished at an early time, for Chalcatzingo Relief 1depicts a ruler holding a ceremonial bar bearing anS-shaped scroll, also on his throne, but the cloudsissuing rain above are quite different in form (Fig.7.4g). Here the ruler’s ceremonial bar can be com-pared with the serpent bar that invokes Milky Wayimagery in later times.David Stuart and Stephen Houston (1994 : 44)identify T632 as the symbol for clouds (muyal),and they note thatmuyaloften appears in celestialcontexts. On the other hand, Stone (1992; 1996)identifies themuyalcompound as a supernatural lo-cale. Themuyalplace may be located on the MilkyWay, andmuyalitself seems to refer to the cloudi-ness of the Milky Way or to a cloudy place on theMilky Way.In a broad study of Precolumbian imagery, Ter-ence Grieder (1982 : 100 –104, 126 –128) links theS-shaped scroll to Scorpius. Another possibility isthat it represents anS-shaped dark cloud in the MilkyWay that runs from Canis Major to the SouthernCross, identified by the Quechua as the snake Ma-chacuay (Urton 1981, fig. 33). This is the area ofCanopus, an especially bright star that certainlywould have attracted some attention (Aveni 1980 :108). The association with rainfall seen in the Dres-den Codex can be explained by the fact that this darkcloud would be prominent at dusk at the onset of therainy season. On the other hand, if theS-shaped de-sign alludes to Scorpius, it could be associated withclouds and rainfall, because this star group is seen inthe evening sky during the rainy season. Alterna-tively, the T632 scroll may be a more general refer-ence to the cloudy aspect of the Milky Way.Variations in body forms of the Cosmic Monstermay allude to different parts of the Milky Way. In-deed, there may be an underworld-upperworld di-chotomy in the imagery of the Cosmic Monster’sbody. Reptile body markings predominate on theFIG. 7.5.a1:Late Classic Cosmic Monster with sky-bandbody terminating in two heads that represent seasonal du-ality;a2:monster frames doorway, giving view of northernsky (House E, Palace, Palenque; after Maudslay 1889 –1902, 4, pl. 43).b:Upside-down rear head of Cosmic Monster (hereshown upright) with skeletal jaw, Kin brow, and head-dress with shell, bloodletter, star symbol, and stream ofblood; also known as Quadripartite Monster, this deitymay allude to Sun crossing rift (underworld) section ofMilky Way at winter solstice during dry season (House E,Palenque; after Robertson 1985a, fig. 89).c:Reptile variant of Cosmic Monster frames east sub-terranean doorway in House E (Palace, Palenque; afterRobertson 1985a, fig. 115).d1:Cosmic Monster covered with cloud symbols;d2:Cosmic Monster, supported by two aged figures of God N,carries seven deities in cloud volutes (Late Classic Struc-ture 22, Copa ́ n; after Maudslay 1889 –1902, 1, pl. 12).e:Late Classic double-headed Cosmic Monster withskin and feet like crocodile (Altar 41 at Copa ́ n; afterMaudslay 1889 –1902, 1, pl. 114).f:Double-headed Cosmic Monster with rear head inform of skeletal snake (Late Classic Altar G1 at Copa ́n;after Schele 1987b).THE COSMIC MONSTER AND THE MILKY WAY279"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Cosmic Monsters framing the entries to subterra-nean passages of House E at Palenque (Fig. 7.5c;Robertson 1985a, fig. 109; Stone 1985 : 48). On theother hand, a Cosmic Monster with a sky-band bodyon House E frames a doorway that gives a clear viewof the sky (Fig. 7.5a).A deer ear on one head of the Cosmic Monster onHouse E is typical of the deer features associated withthe front head (Fig. 5.7g). Such attributes may al-lude to a deer constellation (Hyades?) located on theMilky Way. The front head in House E has a heavy-lidded eye inset with the T510f star, evoking a linkwith ‘‘big eye,’’ a Maya name for Venus (Chapter 5).Indeed, some scholars link the front head of the Cos-mic Monster to Venus (Miller 1988 : 179 –180; Scheleand Miller 1986 : 45).The sky-band body on House E wraps around toconnect with an upside-down rear head markedwith a Kin glyph (Fig. 7.5a – b). The front and rearheads seem to represent an opposition of sorts.There may also be a dichotomy in the liquids asso-ciated with the two heads on House E. In MerleGreene Robertson’s reconstruction of the colors in areplica made for the Florida Museum of NaturalHistory, the rear head issues a liquid from the browthat is predominantly red, whereas the front headdisgorges a liquid that is predominantly blue, likethe water flowing from the Cosmic Monster’s mouthon Dresden Codex page 74 (Fig. 7.4d). As noted inChapter 4, page 74 seems to show rainy-season im-agery of the Moon, and the rain comes from thefront head of the Cosmic Monster. The water flowmay indicate that the front head is linked with therainy-season side of the Milky Way.The rear head of the Cosmic Monster representsthe Quadripartite God, a skeletal god who carries aquadripartite badge: a shell, a bloodletter, a Kin sym-bol, and a fourth element usually including a tri-lobed design reminiscent of the pendants worn byGI and other planetary gods (Fig. 7.5b). The skeletalimagery of the rear head refers to the death and theresurrection of the Sun (Stone 1983 : 204). This is inaccord with Schele’s (1976 : 17) suggestion that therear head may be linked with the Sun at the wintersolstice. The monster has a death aspect seen in itsskeletal jaw and in the Cimi sign associated withdeath that sometimes replaces the Kin sign. The Kinsymbol may be the glyphic counterpart of T546, aKin bowl that is sometimes interpreted aslak’in,thesymbol of east (Chapter 3). The bloodletter in theheaddress, a stingray spine, is sometimes replacedby a shark’s tooth also used in bloodletting (Jones1991). This symbol may allude to the shark-like Xocmonster evoking Sagittarius as a fish-snake in the zo-diac of the Paris Codex. In my opinion, the Quadri-partite God with its skeletal face and prominent solarglyph probably depicts the Sun in Sagittarius. Therear head seems to represent the place where theecliptic crosses the Milky Way in the southern sky atthe winter solstice. And here the Sun is reborn atdawn on the winter solstice, following the longestnight of the year, when the Sun passes through thexibalba besection of the Milky Way. Perhaps this iswhy the quadripartite monster’s Kin symbol appar-ently symbolizes the east.Sometimes the rear head is replaced by a skeletalsnake, as on Altar G1 at Copa ́ n (Fig. 7.5f; Schele1987b). This serpent (Schele’s White-Bone-Snake)represents Scorpius marking the Sun’s position at theonset of the dry season in November, as noted ear-lier. Thus the rear head of the Cosmic Monster maybe associated with Scorpius and Sagittarius, constel-lations that track the Sun’s position from the begin-ning of the dry season through the winter solstice,when the Sun dies and is reborn after the longestnight of the year (Fig. 7.6).

This figure seemsto represent stars in Scorpius, marking the Sun’s po-sition at the onset of the dry season.SERPENT FORMS OF THE MILKY WAYColonial period dictionaries of Yucata ́ n may helpto identify the serpent associated with the CosmicMonster. One of the serpent names for the MilkyWay,tamacaz,refers to the fer-de-lance, an ex-tremely deadly pit viper (Coe 1975 : 27; Lamb 1981 :245). Because of its yellow chin, the fer-de-lanceis calledbarba amarilla(yellow beard) in LatinAmerica. It is noteworthy that the Cosmic Monstersometimes has a beard, which suggests a link withthe fer-de-lance (Figs. 5.7g, 7.5a – b).The species of fer-de-lance still found in QuintanaRoo,Bothrops atrox,is characterized by lattice mark-ings on its body formed by a design of diamonds ofdark against light. A relief-carved vessel from theNational Museum of the American Indian depictsbearded serpents with fer-de-lance body markings(Pl. 21). Schele and Miller (1986 : 193 –194, pls. 73,73a) describe them as Vision Serpents invoked byhallucinations during a bloodletting rite, an interpre-tation that has been questioned because blood lossdoes not cause hallucinations (Stross and Kerr 1990).As I noted in theStar Gods of the Ancient Americasex-hibit (1982), these serpents seem to be images of theMilky Way held by the Sun God (Pl. 21, far right). Hewears a skeletal snake headdress that indicates hisposition in Scorpius, where the ecliptic crosses theunderworld branch of the Milky Way known asxib-alba beamong the contemporary Quiche ́ . One of theserpents has a skeletal zoomorph kneeling in front ofa decapitated head (to far left, Pl. 21). The serpent’sfront head has a skeletal death god riding on itssnout (Schele and Miller 1986, pl. 73a). The deathassociations of this serpent are appropriate to theunderworld branch of the Milky Way in the southernsky, the left hand of the Sun in modern Maya cos-mology. The other serpent, in the Sun’s right hand,symbolizes thesaki beor rainy-season half of theMilky Way. With this serpent, we see a turtle depict-ing stars in Orion.lations associated with the position of the front headare the Pleiades and Orion, star groups that mark theSun’s position at the onset of the rainy season, andGemini, which designates the Sun’s northernmostposition at the summer solstice. Venus may also belinked with the front head of the monster becausethat planet passing by the Pleiades is a sign of rain,and the northern extreme of Venus (reached onlywhen it is in the northern section of the ecliptic) isassociated with the onset of the rains (Chapter 5).Lamanai Stela 9 depicts an Early Classic image ofthe Cosmic Monster’s front head, here with deerantlers and a T510f star symbol on the creature’sdeer ear and another in its heavy-lidded eye (Stone1983 : 198 – 200, fig. 128b). This is in accord withother images of the front head showing deer attri-butes and heavy-lidded eyes. The deer attributes callto mind the horned serpent in a Tzotzil account,apparently related to the Chicchan Serpent of theChortı ́ (Chapter 1). As noted earlier, the ChicchanSerpent of Yucata ́ n may be linked with Venus, espe-cially when it is in the northern sky crossing theMilky Way.We can conclude that the Cosmic Monster is oneof the main images of the Milky Way in both Classicand Postclassic times. During the Classic period, itstwo heads represent a form of opposition that seemsto reflect seasonal duality. The reptilian front headprobably represents the place where the Sun movesto the northern sky, crossing the Milky Way at theonset of the rains in May through June. The fronthead is closely associated with the northern Chic-chan Serpent (a deer-serpent?), who brings rain per-haps associated with Venus in the northern sector ofthe Milky Way. The rear head, with its skeletal as-pect, represents the Sun crossing the southern partof the Milky Way, when it passes through Scorpiusat the beginning of the dry season and Sagittarius atthe winter solstice. Here death imagery is appropri-ate because the vegetation dries up and the Sun de-scends to the underworld at the winter solstice, thelongest night of the year. The rear head is usually rep-resented by the Quadripartite God wearing a head-dress that includes a bloodletter, sometimes a sym-bol of the Xoc monster that may embody Sagittariusas a fish-snake. Occasionally the rear head is accom-282STARS, THE MILKY WAY, COMETS, AND METEORS"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Ceramic vessels also show other variations in im-agery of the Cosmic Monster. A tripod plate depictsthe Cosmic Monster wrapping around the edge, withthe rear head bearing the insignia of the Quadri-partite God (Schele and Miller 1986 : 312, pl. 122c).Here the Cosmic Monster arches over a serpentemerging from a cosmic plant sprouting from Chac’shead. Perhaps this is the serpent aspect of Venus.A scene on a painted vase depicts the bearded ser-pent rising out of a canoe infixed with the Kin glyphon the head of a long-lipped god (Coe 1982 : 91,no. 46). This long-lipped deity apparently is the rearhead of the Cosmic Monster in a free-form style re-served for pottery painting. It conforms to Scheleand Miller’s (1986 : 44) description of the rear headof the Cosmic Monster as the ‘‘half-skeletal zoo-morph with a sun-bowl on its forehead.’’ Thebearded serpent takes the place of the front head ofthe Cosmic Monster.An incised vessel from the American Museum ofNatural History depicts a serpent emerging abovethe front head of the Cosmic Monster, positioned ina stepped cleft opening (Fig. 4.10d1). The CosmicMonster has a crocodilian aspect and deer feet, butits eye form is similar to the serpent emerging fromits jaws, which has eyes with half-closed lids and longlashes (deer eyes?). Ring-shaped designs on the ser-pent’s body, interpreted as jade disks by Schele andMiller (1986 : 308), may in fact be stars, their lumi-nous quality enhanced by shiny mirrors alongside.The serpent twines around the Moon Goddess, mak-ing her a ‘‘dragon lady,’’ a scene frequently repeatedin painted pottery (Chapter 4). A monkey planet andother planetary deities ride along the serpent’s coiledbody. The stepped cleft with Akbal zoomorphs is anopening to the underworld. Here we see the Sun Godand two other gods climbing a tree. This tree maydepict Sagittarius as a cross constellation at the inter-section of the Milky Way and the ecliptic, markingthe place where the Sun ascends at sunrise after thelongest night of the year.On the Protoclassic Hauberg Stela, probably dat-ing toa.d.199, a deified ruler or a god (GI?) appearswith four climbers and three divers who trail bloodfrom their severed bodies (Fig. 6.4c). The total ofseven figures, among which we find the Sun andChac (Venus?), evokes the classical planets of antiq-uity, as noted in Chapter 6. A Wak Chan (6 Sky) titleon the eyebrows of the serpent arching overheadnames the sky serpent with a play on words, forChan can mean both ‘‘sky’’ and ‘‘serpent.’’ Schele(1992b : 143) says the snake is the ecliptic, whereasshe identifies the form framing the ruler as a treerepresenting the Milky Way. This element seemsmore like a stream of liquid, as we can see by com-paring it with images such as the one on DresdenCodex 74 (Fig. 7.4d). As such it may embody theMilky Way as a stream of blood flowing from thesevered bodies, recalling the blood stream associatedwith the rear head of the Cosmic Monster on Pa-lenque’s House E. The snake overhead may refer tothe Milky Way in its serpent aspect, apparentlyclosely linked with the front head of the CosmicMonster. It is noteworthy that the snake is bearded,once again evoking the fer-de-lance aspect of theMilky Way. Its tail may carry an early form of theupside-down rear head of the Cosmic Monster.In sum, contemporary and Colonial period Mayaaccounts refer to the Milky Way as a serpent, estab-lishing a connection with the serpent imagery mostoften seen in the front head of the Cosmic Monster,but early forms of the monster may associate the ser-pent’s tail with the rear head of the Cosmic Monster.The Cosmic Monster is characterized by a beard thatseems to link him with imagery of the fer-de-lance —known as ‘‘yellow beard’’ in Mesoamerica — a ser-pent equated with the Milky Way.FOUR ROADS IN THE SKYAND FOUR ITZAMNASThe snake is not the only image of the Milky Wayknown from Colonial period accounts. The PopolVuh describes the Milky Way as a road, recalling Az-tec accounts. When the Hero Twins reached a cross-roads in the underworld and chose the black road ofXibalba, they went along thexibalba be,or ‘‘under-world road,’’ a branch of the Milky Way with a riftor cleft (from the Northern Cross south to Sagit-tarius); at the opposite side of the Milky Way we findthe ‘‘white road’’ (saki be;Chapter 1). Dennis Ted-lock (1985 : 111, 134, 334; 1991 : 172) points out thatFOUR ROADS IN THE SKY AND FOUR ITZAMNAS283"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"wax (Sosa 1985 : 435). Apparently, the essence ofItzamna (itz) was visualized as liquid drops or dewin the sky — an image completely appropriate to theMilky Way. This notion is preserved among the Ja-calteca Maya, who call the Milky Way the ‘‘dewroad’’ (La Farge and Byers 1931 : 130).Yucatec Maya lore also describes a white road thatmay be an image of the rainy-season side of theMilky Way. According to the Kusansum legend, in aprevious world age thesacbe(white road) was a cordfilled with blood that stretched across the sky fromTulum and Coba ́ to Chiche ́ n Itza ́ and Uxmal. ArthurMiller (1982 : 92 – 95) links this mythical cord to theimagery of a twined cord in the murals at Tulum(Fig. 3.3b). Chapter 3 demonstrated that twinedcords represent the ecliptic. The serpent heads onthe Tulum cords add another dimension, for theyform double-headed serpents with twined-cord bod-ies, not unlike those on a black-background vase ofthe Classic period (Fig. 3.3c). These evoke the inter-twined paths of the Sun, the Moon, and the planets.The serpent-cords wrap around the composition,enclosing the celestial figures in sacred space. Thesame notion of enclosure is evident in the imageryof the god Itzamna.Piedras Negras accession monuments show theCosmic Monster with its sky-band body wrappingaround the enthroned ruler, who is positioned nearthe top of the monument. These niche-figure stelaerefer to world creation and the agricultural and as-tronomical cycles (Stone 1989 : 155; Taube 1988b).The footprint path below the ruler suggests a pos-sible link with the Milky Way as a road or path inthe sky.Many scholars link the Classic period double-headed serpent with Itzamna. According to MichaelCoe (1978b : 28; 1982 : 91), the Bearded Dragon isthe serpent guise of Itzamna, who takes a double-headed form when represented as the ceremonialbar held by Maya rulers. Sharer (1994 : 530) notesthat the Milky Way is depicted as a two-headed ser-pent that is probably another manifestation of It-zamna, whose body represents the Milky Way or thesky. In many contexts, the double-headed serpentrepresents the front head of the Cosmic Monster induplicate form.the crossroads is the point where the ecliptic crossesthe rift or cleft in the Milky Way. Since there are ac-tually two crossroads at different points in the nar-rative, I would suggest that a second crossroads is lo-cated at the opposite side of the sky (Fig. 7.6a). Thetwo crossroads form four paths that intersect at op-posite sides of the sky. The Popol Vuh says the roadsare four different colors, providing a key to their na-ture. The white and black roads, actually two sides ofthe Milky Way, form a giant ring in the sky encirclingthe earth. The ecliptic is another giant celestial ringthat crosses the Milky Way at two places, creating twocrossroads. The red road is probably the Sun’s pathduring the dry season, the epoch of warfare andbloodshed. The fourth road is green at one cross-roads and yellow at the other. This seems to bethe Sun’s path during the rainy season. The greenroad symbolizes the road of newly green vegetation,whereas the yellow road is that of mature maize.Just as there are four different colored roads, thecreator god, Itzamna, has four aspects assigned toworld colors and directions in theRitual of the Ba-cabs:the red to the east, the white to the north, theblack to the west, and the yellow to the south (Roys1965 : 23 n. 23; Thompson 1970b : 212). In my opin-ion, Itzamna’s four bodies are equated with the fourcelestial roads of the Quiche ́ coming together in thesky to enclose our world. The two crossroads markthe two heads of Itzamna, the intersection points ofthe Milky Way and the ecliptic. His white body prob-ably refers to the rainy-season side of the Milky Way,just as his black body evokes the underworld side ofthe Milky Way linked withxibalba be.Itzamna is translated as ‘‘iguana house’’ in theVienna dictionary, but other Yucatec dictionariessuggest different translations. Alfredo Barrera Va ́s-quez (1975 : 205) suggests that Itzamna means the‘‘magician who has the knowledge of creative power,’’whereas Itzam-cab-aı ́n means ‘‘magician who givesbirth to life on earth.’’ He translatesitzamas ‘‘wizardof the water.’’ The chronicler Lizana notes that It-zamna (Itzamat Ul) describes himself as the dewand the sustenance of the sky and clouds (cited inThompson 1970b : 211).

He interprets Itzamnaas a double-headed creature representing a sectiondrawing of the monster, whose body had four sidesforming Itzamna. He notes that Itzamna is a beingwith four bodies, each occupying a quarter of thesky. He suggests that by joining two of the four It-zamnas together rear to rear, Maya artists developedthe two-headed monster now generally referred to asthe Cosmic Monster. I would add that the two headsof the Classic Maya Cosmic Monster are the cross-roads in the sky where the ecliptic crosses the MilkyWay (Fig. 7.6b).According to Thompson (1970b : 209 – 233), It-zamna was the creator and the chief god in Yucata ́n,and he came close to incorporating most of the othermajor gods in his various aspects. His main roles arereflected in his many names, among which we findItzamna Kinich Ahau (a solar aspect) and ItzamnaCab (an earth aspect). Thompson proposes that Bo-lon Dzacab, a name for God K, is a manifestation ofthe vegetal aspect of Itzamna associated with imagesof sprouting maize, whereas God D is Itzamna in hisrole as a creator god. Schele (1992b : 125) sees It-zamna’s divine dew manifested in God D. Taube(1989a : 9) identifies Itzamna as an earth caiman (It-zam Cab Ain in the chronicles) and a manifestationof God D, without resolving the problem of howthis identification relates to God D’s zoological alterego — the Principal Bird Deity. The face of the Prin-cipal Bird Deity is represented on the sky bandforming the back of the Cosmic Monster over thedoorway in House E at Palenque (Fig. 7.5a). In Post-classic codices, God D appears in the jaws of the Cos-mic Monster, as on Dresden Codex 4b –5b (Thomp-son 1970b : 228 – 229, fig. 4b). But God D is only oneof a number of deities associated with Itzamna. Iwould suggest that God D, the Sun God, and God Kbecome aspects of Itzamna when they are located inthe Milky Way. The Cosmic Monster –Itzamna car-ries celestial gods in his mouth because he is carryingthe Sun, the Moon, and the planets as they cross theMilky Way.The earth aspect of Itzamna may relate to theposition of the Milky Way below the horizon or,more specifically, to the region of the Milky Waylinked with the celestial hearthstones. TheRitualof the Bacabsgives an incantation for opening thehearth (pib), telling Itzam Cab to open his mouth asthe earth is removed for the fire (Roys 1965 : 49 –50).The text says that Itzam Cab has the hearthstones ashis head, a blazing fire as his tongue, and the fire-wood as his thighs, and he stands erect over thehearth fire of the house (Thompson 1970 : 230). Thismay be explained by the fact that the hearthstonestars of Orion are located on the head of Itzamna,associated with the front head of the Cosmic Mon-ster in Classic times. He stands erect over the hearthfire because the stars of Orion are positioned close tothe zenith in the Maya area.Other stellar references link Itzamna to constella-tions on the Milky Way. The Chilam Balam of Chu-mayel mentions Itzam Tzab, an image that links thePleiades with Itzamna. The text notes that ItzamTzab is Itzamna’s face during the Katun 13 Ahau, atime of hunger due to locusts (Roys 1967 : 134).We can conclude that the Itzamna of the chron-icles has a quadripartite body. The four colored bod-ies of Itzamna relate to the four celestial roads inQuiche ́ accounts. The image of four roads in thePopol Vuh reveals a cosmic diagram describing theintersecting paths of the ecliptic and the Milky Way.In Maya art, this translates into zoomorphic imagery,with a double-headed Cosmic Monster being thecounterpart of Itzamna. Itzamna’s celestial dew is thesubstance of clouds that are the essence of the MilkyWay. Different aspects of Itzamna in the chroniclesseem to reflect a relationship with the Sun, the Moon,and the planets, perhaps symbolizing when thesebodies were seen in the Milky Way. Important stargroups located where the ecliptic crosses the MilkyWay are also mentioned in relation to Itzamna.CLASSIC PERIOD MONUMENTSWITH IMAGES OF THE MILKY WAYWe can now turn to Classic Maya monuments thatdepict celestial ancestors and deities passing throughthe Milky Way.

As noted in Chapter 4, the Jaguar God andthe Fish God appear as the Paddler Twins on mon-uments bearing dates that coincide with times wheneither the Sun or the Moon was crossing the MilkyWay. In the imagery of the Paddlers, the Milky Wayis a celestial river that carries the Paddlers acrossthe sky.Schele (1992b : 153) suggests that the number sixattached to anS-shaped scroll (T632) recorded inTomb 12 at Rı ́o Azul refers to the ruler’s burial placeat ‘‘six-raised-up-cloudy-sky.’’ Stuart and Houston(1994 : 44) interpret the inscriptionwak kaan muyalnalas the terrestrial location of Tomb 12. Stone(1992) describes it as a celestial locale. In my opin-ion, it refers to the Milky Way or, more specifically,to a location in thexibalba besection of the MilkyWay. In any case, its context in a burial is interestingin light of imagery discussed above that suggests thatdeceased rulers travel through the Milky Way.Quirigua ́ Monument 7 (Zoomorph G) may rep-resent the deceased ruler’s connection with the MilkyWay. Claude-Franc ̧ ois Baudez (1988 : 140) identi-fies the imagery as the accession of Sky Xul on9.17.14.16.18, one of the latest dates recorded on themonument. On the other hand, Stone (1983 : 90)identifies both sides of the zoomorph as posthumousportraits of Cauac Sky, carved after his death on9.17.14.13.0, a date also on the monument. Anotherdate records an Initial Series date of 9.17.15.0.0 (10/31/785), and Stone (1992) points out that the Pad-dler Twins celebrated this period ending at a celestialplace calledwak muyal(6 cloud), a supernatural lo-cale associated with deceased rulers at both Quirigua ́and Rı ́o Azul. Thewak muyalcompound may ap-pear in the funerary text as a reference to the MilkyWay, the place where the dead king ascended afterdeath. It is noteworthy that the Sun reached the riftof the Milky Way, entering Scorpius, at the time thePaddler Twins celebrated the period-ending rites.Jupiter was visible at dusk in Scorpius, and Venuswas near its maximum altitude in Sagittarius.On Quirigua ́ Monument 23, Chac dances amidbeaded scrolls beside aT-shaped Cauac openingbear dates that signal an astronomical body pass-ing through the Milky Way. Setting these aside atthis time, we turn to the cloud riders, an image thatmay refer to positioning in the Milky Way. In somecases, it is difficult to distinguish deities amid theclouds from apotheosized ancestors. Patricia Mc-Anany (1995b : 44 – 46) describes images of ancestorswreathed in clouds from Ucanal and Jimbal, butthese cloud riders are identified as deities by DavidStuart (1984 : 11). In any case, we should bear inmind that clouds and the substance of the Milky Waymay be interchangeable in some contexts, especiallyin the imagery of rulers ascending to the heavens totake on attributes of the gods.On Jimbal Stela 1, two cloud riders appear amidstscrolls with beaded borders (Fig. 7.4e). AlthoughStuart (1984 : 11–12; 1988 : 203) refers to these asthe Jaguar God and the Fish God, the details of theirfacial features are by no means clear. Even thoughthe Sun and Moon were not passing through theMilky Way, on the Katun ending recorded on thismonument (10.2.0.0.0; 8/11/869), all the planetswere crossing the Milky Way except for Mercury,which was invisible in conjunction with the Sun andthe Moon in Leo. Thus we have no shortage ofplanetary gods in the Milky Way. Furthermore, Ju-piter and Saturn were in conjunction in Sagittarius,and both planets were in retrograde motion, withJupiter precisely at its second stationary point (8/10/869; Meeus n.d.).The Paddler Twins, mentioned as celebrants ofthe new cycle at the creation some five thousandyears ago on Ixlu Stela 2, are represented floatingamidS-shaped scrolls (Fig. 4.3b; Stuart 1984 : 11–13). This monument bears a Katun-ending date(10.1.0.0.0; 11/24 /849) that correlates with a num-ber of astronomical events, including Jupiter andSaturn both approaching their second stationarypoints, the Evening Star near its maximum altitude,and the Pleiades crossing overhead at midnight.David Stuart (1988) describes the solar deity as theFish God. It is noteworthy that on this date the Sunwas in the Milky Way entering Sagittarius, the con-stellation that would later mark the position of theSun at the winter solstice, when it reached its south-ernmost position crossing the Milky Way.

The beaded scrolls suggest a correspon-dence with the cloud riders. A similar image ap-pears on Quirigua ́ Monument 24 (Baudez 1988,fig. 12). If Chac is Venus, as suggested in Chapter 5,it is significant that each of the two monuments re-cords an Initial Series date that corresponds to atime when Venus was crossing the Milky Way, if weconsider Libra as the edge of the Milky Way. Bau-dez (1988 : 143 –144) says that Monuments 23 and24 show a dead ruler, and it is possible that bothmonuments show the resurrection or apotheosis ofa dead ruler here in the guise of Chac as Venuscrossing the Milky Way.Kan Xul’s apotheosis event on the DumbartonOaks Relief Panel 2, dated to 9 Manik 5 Muan(9.14.11.2.7; 11/18/722), corresponds to a time whenVenus was just above the eastern horizon in Scorpius(Fig. 5.10d; Chapter 5). Apparently, the dead ruler inthe guise of Chac represented Venus about to disap-pear in superior conjunction. His planet Venus waslocated in Scorpius, a constellation associated withthe underworld branch of the Milky Way. The ruler’sshell diadem could represent the curve of stars inScorpius.On the Sarcophagus Lid, the jaws framing Pacalembody stars in Scorpius, and the tree represents theSouthern Cross, both star groups in the southernsection of the Milky Way, thexibalba be(Pl. 10). TheSouthern Cross tree grows from the rear head of theCosmic Monster (the Quadripartite God), markingthe southernmost point of the ecliptic crossing theMilky Way. At the time of his apotheosis on 8/26 /683, Pacal seems to have taken a trip on the MilkyWay. The phrase ‘‘he entered the road,’’ associatedwith Pacal’s apotheosis, evokes his travel along theunderworld road of the Milky Way road to reach Ju-piter at its first stationary point (Chapter 6). Pacal’sjourney to apotheosis may be reconstructed as fol-lows: When the Milky Way rift opened like a mawinto the underworld at dusk, he passed to the rearhead of the Cosmic Monster and on through thejaws of the Scorpius serpent. From here he moved toascend the Southern Cross. Then, as the SouthernCross disappeared below the horizon, thesaki be,or‘‘white road,’’ of the Milky Way rose overhead atdawn. Apparently, Pacal traveled along the under-world branch of the Milky Way to reach the otherside of the sky, where he joined his planet Jupiter atits first stationary point, located precisely in con-junction with the Pleiades overhead at dawn.Milky Way imagery that appears on Copa ́ n Stela Idepicts the apotheosized ruler in the guise of GI,with the skeletal rear head of the Cosmic Monster asa headdress (Fig. 5.10j; Baudez 1985 : 37; Proskour-iakoff 1993 : 58 –59). An inscription with 10 Ahau ispartially destroyed, but it is worth noting that Venuswas in the Milky Way or on its edge on both 10 Ahaudates proposed by Proskouriakoff (8/22 /627 and9/3/659). If the second date is correct, the monu-ment could refer to the apotheosized ruler as Venus-GI in the Milky Way. On the second date, Venusand Saturn were in conjunction in Libra on theedge of the underworld section of the Milky Way.The Quadripartite God headdress suggests that Ve-nus was positioned in the underworld section of theMilky Way. Perhaps the ruler took the form of Ve-nus when it crossed the Milky Way in the regionknown asxibalba be.As noted in Chapter 4, Copa ́ n Stela H portrays aroyal person who seems to embody the full Moonof the maize harvest, either a royal woman or theruler 18 Rabbit (Baudez 1994, figs. 22 – 24). Theruler may embody the Moon deity merged with theMaize God wearing a netted skirt. An inscriptionreferring to the date 4 Ahau 18 Muan (9.14.19.5.0;11/29/730) marks a time when the full Moon wascrossing the Milky Way in Orion.

The Sun reaches theMilky Way in May at the beginning of the Mesoam-erican rainy season. At this point, the Sun is in zenithposition around the time it moves into conjunctionwith the Pleiades in Taurus. Then the Sun passes tothe next constellation, where Gemini marks the Sun’sposition at the summer solstice in June, and the Sunreaches its northern extreme on the ecliptic. At thistime the Sun exits the Milky Way and travels aroundto the opposite side of the sky, where the eclipticagain crosses the Milky Way. Now the Sun is in con-junction with Scorpius at the onset of the dry seasonin November. Passing through the Milky Way, theSun reaches Sagittarius at the winter solstice in De-cember at the southern extreme of the ecliptic.In interpreting the relationship of Maya images tothese seasonal configurations of the Milky Way, wemust bear in mind that the observation time is im-portant in defining the configuration, for the MilkyWay can rotate dramatically during the course of onenight. On the other hand, The Milky Way graduallychanges position when observed at the same time ofnight over the course of the year.In terms of the Mesoamerican seasons, there seemto be four important seasonal orientations. TheMilky Way arches overhead running southeast tonorthwest at dusk in March, around the spring equi-nox (Fig. 7.7a). This type of configuration, placingthe hearthstone stars of Orion overhead, can be seenat different times of night from October throughApril, making it a sign of the dry season. Around thesummer solstice in June, the Milky Way surroundsthe horizon like a cosmic ocean at dusk (Fig. 7.7b).Such a configuration can be seen at different times ofnight from mid-January through mid-June, bridg-ing the transition into the rainy season. Around thefall equinox, the Milky Way arches overhead fromnortheast to southwest at dusk, with the dark rift inthe Milky Way running overhead and down to thethe Milky Way. The Principal Bird Deity (God D’sbird) perching on the bloodletter may also be an as-tronomical deity. Preliminary study indicates thatVenus may be represented by this bird deity, essen-tially a bird with snake attributes, just as Quetzal-coatl is a snake with bird attributes. The Venus as-sociation is reinforced by the fact that Venus wascrossing the Milky Way in Sagittarius on the re-corded date.On Tikal Stela 5, the ruler’s backrack has a skeletalface in a Kin cartouche that may represent the Sunin the month of the winter solstice (Jones 1977,fig. 13). The fragmentary Calendar Round date, re-constructed as 3 Lamat 6 Pax (9.15.3.6.8; 12 /6 /734),refers to a time when the Sun was in Sagittarius. Theskeletal face is a symbol associated with the Sun’sposition at the winter solstice, when it descends tothe underworld in Sagittarius on the longest night ofthe year. Skeletal snakes surrounding the Kin car-touche probably represent Scorpius, the star groupadjacent to Sagittarius in the southern sector of theMilky Way.We can conclude that a number of Classic periodmonuments record dates that place the Sun, theMoon, and the planets in the Milky Way. The cloudriders may allude to any of these celestial bodiescrossing in the Milky Way. A favored time for theapotheosis of dead rulers was when one of the plan-ets was positioned on the Milky Way. This type ofimagery is most often linked with the southern ex-treme of the ecliptic where it crosses the Milky Wayin the region of Sagittarius and Scorpius. The livingruler may also appear with imagery of the MilkyWay, placing the ruler at the center of the cosmos.ROTATING THE MILKY WAYWhen the Sun enters the Milky Way, the seasonschange; and when the Sun starts to move out of the288STARS, THE MILKY WAY, COMETS, AND METEORSFIG. 7.7.A:Night sky seen from latitudes 307,207, and107N; dry-season aspect of Milky Way at dusk near springequinox arches overhead from southeast to northwest;same position seen at different times of night from Octo-ber to April (after Rey 1976 : 100).B:Night sky seen from latitudes 307,207, and 107N;Milky Way surrounds horizon like cosmic ocean at dusknear summer solstice in June; same position seen at differ-ent times of night from January to June, moving from dryseason to rainy season (after Rey 1976 : 100)."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"southern horizon (Fig. 7.8a). This type of sky is seenat different times of night from April to October, co-inciding with the rainy season. Several months later,around the winter solstice, the Milky Way archesover the sky in an east-west configuration at dusk,and the rift has moved from the overhead positionto the western horizon (Fig. 7.8b). This type of skycan be seen at different times of night from July toJanuary, bridging the transition from wet to dry.Schele (1992b : 135 –136) says that we see the Cos-mic Monster aspect of the Milky Way (east-west) atdusk during winter, a conclusion that is supportedby the analysis presented here. Imagery associatedwith the east-west position of the Milky Way at duskon the winter solstice may be linked with the deathof the Sun, seen especially in representations of theCosmic Monster’s rear head marking the rift inthe underworld branch of the Milky Way (Fig. 7.8bPl. 10). The gap in the Milky Way makes it look al-most like a monster with a mouth positioned to thewest. The Sun passes through the rift on the longestnight of the year. On the following day at dawn,when the Sun reappears, the Milky Way has changedposition dramatically, resembling a cosmic oceansurrounding the horizon, an image of renewal. Nowthe rift opening is to the east (Fig. 7.7b).Schele (1992b : 131–132) hypothesizes that thesoutheast-to-northwest configuration of the MilkyWay represents a tree associated with the image ofthe Milky Way at sunset around the summer sol-stice. This idea was probably inspired by Eva Hunt’s(1977 : 205) notion that the Milky Way is anaxismundithat can be compared with tree trunks, um-bilical lines, rivers, and roads. More recently, Freideland Schele (1995 : 134) document a Lacando ́ n ac-count that says that the roots of the tree are in theMilky Way south of Scorpius. I would add that thisis the area where we find a celestial tree incorporat-ing stars in Sagittarius, and further to the south wesee another tree in the Southern Cross, described asa sacred ceiba by the Lacando ́ n. Clearly there are ce-lestial trees with their roots on the Milky Way, butSchele’s notion that the Milky Way itself is a treeseems untenable. The tree stands ‘‘up’’ only if youconsider it in relation to modern sky maps that shownorth as up, and the top of the tree is actually quitelow on the horizon (Tedlock 1995 : 119). The celes-tial trees on the Milky Way may hold up the sky,but trees were not responsible for raising the MilkyWay, nor do we find trees representing the MilkyWay in accounts describing the creation of theMilky Way in central Mexican sources discussedearlier.In sum, the rotation of the Milky Way was clearlyimportant in Maya iconography. Different seasonalconfigurations were certainly recognized, but wehave yet to determine what observation time wasused, a detail that is crucial to such interpretations.The Cosmic Monster is best seen in the east-westposition of the Milky Way seen at dusk, when therift-mouth of the monster is on the western horizonas the Sun sets into the underworld on the wintersolstice. Future research may help to define imagesof the Milky Way as a cosmic ocean, a position thatmakes the Milky Way seem to surround the horizon.If dusk was the observation time, this could alludeto the rainy season, when the Milky Way and its liq-uid descend to the earth. The association, however,would be with the dry season if the observation timewas at dawn.THE MAYA IN THE HISTORYOF WORLD ASTRONOMYMaya images of the Milky Way as a celestial riverand a sky serpent may reflect ancient archetypes, forTHE MAYA IN THE HISTORY OF WORLD ASTRONOMY291FIG. 7.8.A:Night sky seen from latitudes 307,207, and107N; Milky Way arches overhead from northeast tosouthwest at dusk near fall equinox, with dark rift inMilky Way running overhead and down to southern ho-rizon; same position visible at different times of nightfrom April to October during rainy season (after Rey1976 : 101).B:Night sky seen from latitudes 307,207, and 107N;Milky Way arches over sky in east-west configuration atdusk on winter solstice, with rift above western horizon;same position seen at different times of night from July toJanuary, bridging transition from wet to dry (after Rey1976 : 101)."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"ticed horizon astronomy, tracking the horizon ex-tremes of these celestial bodies, a form of observa-tion that requires fixed observation points, usuallyinvolving monumental architecture.The scholars of earlier generations noted that theClassic Maya were fascinated by calendrics and as-tronomy. We now know that they were recordingthe histories of lineages and rulers, but history seemsto be integrated with observation of astronomicalevents. This is not surprising because astronomy andpolitical events are inextricably linked in many an-cient civilizations, especially those of Mesopotamiaand China. Indeed, recent research suggests thatchanges in dynasties in ancient China were timed byplanetary conjunctions (Pankenier 1997).David Kelley (1960; 1972; 1974 : 136 – 342; 1976 :92) sees a resemblance between the Mesoamericanand Eurasian concepts of time and astronomy. Helinks the Mesoamerican cycle of the Lords of theNight to the Hindu planetary week of nine days thatrefers to five planets, the Sun, the Moon, and twoinvisible planets believed to cause eclipses. Otherparallels include the organization of time into fourworld ages associated with different colors, and theidea of cyclical destructions of the world. Kelley alsonotes a link between the Mesoamerican calendar andthe Hindu lunar mansions that track the position ofthe Moon amid the stars. Transpacific contacts areone way of explaining such similarities. More likely,a similar worldview developed because both culturesare located in tropical latitudes, where there is amarked contrast between the rainy and dry seasons,and the seasons are similarly linked to the positionsof certain stars.The seasonal associations of specific constellationscould have been maintained for almost two thou-sand years by shifting from an observation of dawnrise in Preclassic times to a dusk-set observation inthe Postclassic period. There is evidence for bothdawn-rise and dusk-set observations in the Postclas-sic period. A constellation’s position in oppositionwas also important, rising at dusk and setting atdawn, as seen in the Aztec New Fire Ceremony,which focuses on the longest visibility of the Pleia-des, a ritual that may also be represented among theMaya of Yucata ́ n during the Terminal Classic period.such images are quite widespread across the world.Among the Quechua of South America, such imagesare particularly well developed; there the Milky Wayis a celestial river that circulates the waters of thecosmos (Urton 1981). The association of the MilkyWay with the dead is also common. Edward Krupp(1993) notes that among the Lapps, the Milky Wayis the road for the dead leaving earth, and similarimages are found in the transformational notions inSiberia, where the Milky Way is a path of migratingbirds whose departure is compared to the soul’s de-parture from Earth. Indeed, the link between theMilky Way and the realm of death is so widespreadthat it may have been part of the traditions broughtover during the Pleistocene migrations.Like the people of classical Greece and early Re-naissance Europe, the Maya visualized an earth-centered universe with celestial heroes travelingfrom the sky to the underworld. The Popol Vuh is anastronomical legend like the classical Greek mythsthat account for the location of constellations and re-late the adventures of astronomical gods represent-ing the Sun, the Moon, and the planets. In a curiousoverlap, the planet Jupiter is a god linked with rulersand the weather in both cultures. Jupiter is the planetof kings in both cultures; however, among the Maya,Jupiter was not king of the sky but rather one ofthree brothers who formed a celestial triad with theSun and the Morning Star. And although the Mayapictured God K with an axe that may symbolizethunder, rainfall was apparently controlled by Chac,a god who may represent Venus.Other similarities in the ancient astronomies aredue to independent invention resulting from observ-ing similar patterns in the sky. The Maya discoveredtheoctaeteris,an eight-year period of Venus eventsmeshed with ninety-nine lunar months, a cycle alsoknown in classical Greece and Mesopotamia. Andlike the Greeks of classical times, the Maya appar-ently also recognized the metonic cycle, which indi-cates that these cycles were developed independentlyin the New World as a result of direct observation(Krupp 1995 : 72). Like the Old World astronomers,Maya starwatchers studied positional astronomy totrack the position of the Sun, the Moon, and theplanets in the background of stars.

Constellations in oppositionto the Sun also mark the location of the full Moon,which suggests comparison with the lunar mansionsof Asia. The Paris Codex zodiac seems to be basedon both dawn rise and dawn set observations.Although there are few demonstrable overlapsin terms of star terminology of the Chinese lunarmansions, the most intriguing is the twentieth lunarmansion (tsui), which is a turtle star in Orion (Need-ham 1959, table 24). Indeed, worship of certain con-stellations may be so ancient that they date back tothe time of Asian migrations to the New World.Grieder (1982 : 100 –104, 126 –128) argues that wor-ship of Scorpius in the Americas and in Asia pertainsto a very ancient stratum of beliefs apparent in theShang Dynasty dating as far back as 3100b.c.ThePleiades and Scorpius may be among the first stargroups to be used in calendars of the New World.Their roles as seasonal markers in Mesoamerica aremirrored in the central Andes, but the seasonal as-sociations are reversed (Dearborn and White 1982 :252; Urton 1981).Given the imagery of quadripartite space in Me-soamerican cosmology, it is interesting to note thatthe Chinese also divided the sky into quarters. Theydistributed the lunar mansions among four star ani-mals ranging all the way around the equatorial circle:the blue dragon of the east (including Spica in Virgoand stars of Scorpius), the vermilion bird of thesouth, the white tiger of the west (including Taurusand Orion), and the black tortoise of the north,which includes stars in Capricorn (Needham 1959 :242). The blue dragon represents spring, when thestars in Scorpius and Virgo were visible for the lon-gest period of time. The ancient association of thedragon with spring continues today in the ChineseNew Year celebration, when the dragon is paradedthrough the streets. This colorful pageant probablyoriginated as a dramatization of events involvingstars of the Spring Dragon, spanning one quarter ofthe heavens. In Han times, the full Moon rose inbetween the two horns of the Spring Dragon duringthe festivities for the new year, hence the oft-re-peated image of the dragon and its pearl — the Moon(Needham 1959 : 252, fig. 95, table 24).We are only beginning to understand the role ofastronomy in Maya imagery. Through iconographicstudies focusing on astronomy, decipherment ofMaya hieroglyphs, and study of traditions preservedby the Maya today, it may be possible to recognize awealth of seasonal images and rituals dating back tothe Classic Maya period. Such studies will add amissing piece of the puzzle in world history, allowingus to compare images of the universe across theglobe, and someday we will recognize Maya imagesevery bit as colorful as the Chinese Spring Dragonand its lunar pearl.THE MAYA IN THE HISTORY OF WORLD ASTRONOMY293"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 1GUIDE TO ASTRONOMICAL IDENTITIESCosmic Monster:Milky Way with heads at crossingpoints of eclipticGod A8:Male Moon?God B (Chac):Venus?God C:Monkey planetGod CH:Male MoonGod E:Maize God linked with Moon and possiblyalso VenusGod G:SunGod H:Counterpart to central Mexican Venus godQuetzalcoatlGod K:JupiterGod L:Venus (especially in dry season?)God S (1 Ahau):Solar god linked with MorningStar;

This circle is the celestial counterpart of theterrestrial equator.Celestial longitude:Position of the sun, moon, or anindividual planet when measured along the eclipticin degrees counting from a zero point at the vernalequinox.Conjunction:Position of two or more celestial bod-ies close to one another (usually within 27of celes-tial longitude). When the Sun is involved in a con-junction event, the other celestial body cannot beseen. The Moon disappears for up to 3 days whenin conjunction with the Sun. For the superior plan-ets, the mean disappearance intervals are 25 daysfor Saturn, 32 days for Jupiter, and 120 days forMars. On the other hand, the inferior planetsexhibit two periods of conjunction (inferior andsuperior conjunction). The exact midpoint of thedisappearance interval is conjunction, but the termis often used more generally to refer to the entireperiod of invisibility.Declination:Angular distance measured from thecelestial equator to a star along the star’s hour circle,measured in positive degrees to the north of theequator and negative to the south, like latitude ona terrestrial map.Draconic month:Interval between successive pas-sages of the moon by a given node in its orbit;27.21222 days.Eclipse year:Interval between successive passages ofthe sun by the same node of the lunar orbit (346.62days), also known as the draconitic year. One-halfof the eclipse year (173.31 days) is the eclipse half-year, the time it takes for the sun to move from onenode to another (ascending node to descendingnode or vice versa; see Fig. 2.2a).Ecliptic:Apparent seasonal path of the sun throughthe background of stars along a plane angled at231⁄27relative to the celestial equator. This angle haschanged very slightly from about 227to a little over247over the course of a cycle that repeats every41,000 years. Currently the angle is diminishing,and it is expected to begin increasing in about15,000 years.Elongation:Angular distance between the sun andthe moon or the sun and a planet."},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"Metonic cycle:Period of 6939.6 days (about nineteenyears) that returns the full moon to the same date inthe calendar year.Nadir: SeeZenith.Nodes:Points of intersection of the plane of themoon’s orbit around the earth and the 231⁄27planeof the earth’s orbit around the sun, known as theplane of the ecliptic (see Fig. 2.1b).Occultation:Eclipse of a star or planet by the moonor another planet.Opposition:Configuration of a body when it is oppo-site the sun, at 1807elongation, so that it rises atdusk and is seen overhead at midnight, when theearth is positioned between that body and the sun.Precession:Slow conical motion of the earth’s axisof rotation about the poles of the ecliptic, resultingin a motion of the celestial poles among the stars ina cycle of approximately 26,000 years.Regression of nodes:Westward (backward) move-ment of the nodes (of the lunar orbit) along theecliptic, one cycle being completed in 18.61 years.Lunar standstills, most noticeable in regions beyondthe Tropics, reflect this 18.61-year cycle by markingthe extreme positions in the north-south movementof the moon along the horizon at rising or setting.See alsoNodes.Retrograde motion:Apparent westward motion ofa planet in the sky relative to the stars. Mean retro-grade interval for Venus is 42 days; Mars, 75 days;Jupiter, 120 days; and Saturn, 140 days.Right ascenscion:Position of a star in the equatorialsystem of celestial coordinates (similar to longitudein the system of terrestrial coordinates), used withdeclination to locate a star’s position on the celestialsphere, which is fixed regardless of the observer’slocation. Right ascension (R.A.) is measured east-Ephemeris:Table that lists the position of a celestialbody at different times.Equinox:Point on the celestial sphere at which thesun crosses the celestial equator in its apparentannual motion. The spring or vernal equinox iswhen the sun crosses the equator moving northaround March 21; the autumnal equinox is when itmoves from north to south around September 21.Actual date varies by a day or two depending on theleap year cycle.Heliacal rise:Day a planet or star reappears after aperiod of invisibility in conjunction with the sun,usually at dawn.Heliacal set:Day a planet or star is last visible beforeconjunction with the sun, usually at dusk.Hour circles:Great circles passing through the celes-tial poles, dividing up the sky into sections like anorange.Inferior conjunction:Configuration of a planet inwhich it is obscured by passage in front of the Sun.This only occurs for inferior planets, which circlebetween the Sun and Earth in their orbits. Meaninferior conjunction intervals for the two inferiorplanets are three days for Mercury and eight daysfor Venus.Lunar standstill: SeeRegression of nodes.Lunation:One full synodic period of the moon,comprising one lunar month of 29.530588 days.Maximum elongation:Greatest angular distance ofa planet or the moon from the sun, most often ofinterest in reference to the position of an inferiorplanet.Meridian:Great circle that passes through thezenith and the north and south celestial poles.310STAR GODS OF THE MAYA"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"ward from the zero point at the vernal equinox andgiven in hours, minutes, and seconds with 24 hourscorresponding to 3607.Saros cycle:Cycle of similar eclipses that recurs aftera period of about 18.03 years or 223 lunations(6,585.32 days).Sidereal cycle or period:Time it takes for a celestialbody to return to the same part of the sky whenobserved from Earth against the background ofstars.
